<text>Oneonta ( ) is a city in southern Otsego County, New York, United States. It is one of the northernmost cities of Appalachia. Oneonta is home to the State University of New York at Oneonta and Hartwick College. SUNY Oneonta began as a normal school and a teacher&#x27;s college in 1889, and Hartwick College moved into the city in 1928. The approximately 5,800 students from SUNY Oneonta and the approximately 1,500 students at Hartwick make up a significant percentage of the population of Oneonta. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, Oneonta had a population of 13,079. Its nickname is &quot;City of the Hills.&quot; While the word &quot;oneonta&quot; is of undetermined origin, it is popularly believed to mean &quot;place of open rocks&quot; in the Mohawk language. This refers to a prominent geological formation known as &quot;Table Rock&quot; at the western end of the city.

The city is surrounded by the town of Oneonta, a separate municipal and political jurisdiction. Oneonta Municipal Airport (N66) is north of the city.

== History ==
Indigenous ancestors of Algonquin and Iroquoian-speaking Native Americans inhabited the land in the territory of Oneonta before European colonists settled in the area. The Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy are believed to have emerged and gained dominance prior to the 15th century; they were in place at the time of early French and Dutch colonization.
The area&#x27;s early European-American settlers did not arrive until around 1775 and consisted mainly of ethnic Palatine German and Dutch settlers moving out of the Hudson and eastern Mohawk valleys. The first such settler in the area now known as the Town of Oneonta was Henry Scramling (b. ~1743; d. 1808). He had secured a grant of 1,000 acres in the Susquehanna Valley, moved from German Flatts and settled about 1773 in the Oneonta Plains near the mouth of the Otego Creek. He left during the Revolution and returned after the conflict with his brothers, George and David Scramling, and his brothers-in-law, John and David Young. Their farms were not far from the mouth of the Otego Creek.
The army led by General James Clinton passed through the area in order to join the Sullivan Expedition in 1779 against Iroquois settlements.

The first hamlet developed around 1800 and was later known as &quot;Milfordville.&quot; In 1830, the Town of Oneonta was formed from parts of two other Towns in the county. Milfordville changed its name to Oneonta in 1832. In 1848, it was incorporated as a village within the Town.

In the mid-19th century, the Albany &amp; Susquehanna Railroad reached Oneonta, soon after was leased in perpetuity to the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company. The arrival of the railroad stimulated development as a railroad center and attracting new industries. Oneonta was once home to the largest locomotive roundhouse in the world.

The earliest known account of Oneonta&#x27;s history was written by Willard Vincent Huntington. Published in 1891, &quot;Oneonta Memories and Sundry Personal Recollections of the Author&quot; is, as the title suggests, a combination memoir and history of Oneonta&#x27;s early formation, its geography, economic fortunes, and social life. In 1896, Edgar Luderne Welch&#x27;s &quot;Oneonta Historical Souvenir&quot; was published covering the new normal school and other institutions in the community. Dudley M. Campbell wrote and published &quot;History of Oneonta&quot; in 1906. This book is a straightforward historical account of the area which concerns itself with politics, economics, and notable events and figures.

The village incorporated as a city in 1908. In February 1991 Mayor David Brenner of Oneonta, New York and Mayor Danny Hicks of Oneonta, Alabama officially recognized their cities as sister cities at a centennial celebration for Oneonta, Alabama.

==Geography==
Oneonta is located at (42.456003, -75.062302).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The city lies between Binghamton and Albany.

==Architecture==
The architecture of Oneonta consists of a variety of Victorian and 20th-century commercial and domestic styles, including low-rise commercial buildings. Oneonta currently has very few industrial complexes. Because of its location, Oneonta does not serve as a prime industrial city.
There are several historic buildings that were originally homes of prominent people. The Fairchild Mansion was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and was formerly the home of George Winthrop Fairchild, one of the original partners with Thomas Watson. Fairchild and Watson were the founders of what eventually became IBM. Also, George I. Wilber House is a historic home located in the city. It was built in two phases, 1875 and about 1890. It is a three-story wood-frame structure on a stone foundation in the Late Victorian style. It features a three-story, round corner tower, cross gabled roof, and a large, very decorative wrap-around porch with a porte-cochere. In 1997 it became home to the Upper Catskill Community Council of the Arts (now the Community Arts Network of Oneonta). It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.
Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are: Bresee Hall, Chapin Memorial Church, Ford Block, Fortin Site, Municipal Building, Oneonta Armory, Stonehouse Farm, Oneonta Theatre, Old Post Office, Oneonta Downtown Historic District, and Walnut Street Historic District.

The tallest building in Oneonta is Nader Towers. Standing nine stories high, the building is owned by the City of Oneonta Housing Authority and is operated as a senior citizens&#x27; housing facility.

<doc id="520284" wikidata="Q3822044" url="?curid=520284" title="Helpers at the nest">
<text>Helpers at the nest is a term used in behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology to describe a social structure in which juveniles and sexually mature adolescents of either one or both sexes remain in association with their parents and help them raise subsequent broods or litters, instead of dispersing and beginning to reproduce themselves. This phenomenon was first studied in birds where it occurs most frequently, but it is also known in animals from many different groups including mammals and insects. It is a simple form of co-operative breeding. The effects of helpers usually amount to a net benefit, however, benefits are not uniformly distributed by all helpers nor across all species that exhibit this behaviour. There are multiple proposed explanations for the behaviour, but its variability and broad taxonomic occurrences result in simultaneously plausible theories.

The term &quot;helper&quot; was coined by Alexander Skutch in 1935 and defined more carefully in 1961 in the avian context as &quot;a bird which assists in the nesting of an individual other than its mate, or feeds or otherwise attends a bird of whatever age which is neither its mate nor its dependent offspring.&quot; The term has been criticised as being anthropomorphic, but it remains in use. Other terms used especially in mammals, depending on the specific contexts, are non-maternal (care by other than the mother), alloparental (care by other than the parents), cooperative (care by non-breeding helpers) and communal (care by other breeding females) care.

== Examples ==
It occurs in between three and eight percent of bird species worldwide (estimates vary), but is much more common in Australia and Southern Africa. Bird species in which this behaviour is found include the common moorhen, the house sparrow, the acorn woodpecker, and the apostlebird. Humans, damarland mole rats and meerkats are examples of mammals that exhibit this behaviour. It is also seen in a number of species of bee such as carpenter bees (note this is distinct from the behaviour of the European honey bee, where the worker bees are sterile and incapable of reproducing).

== Evolution ==
Three explanations for the occurrence of helpers at the nest have been put forward; they are not mutually exclusive, and in any particular species an investigation of the exact benefits and costs will be needed to see what combination of these factors may have driven the evolution of helping.

*Advantage to the helpers, who may be protected from predation, or gain skills that they will need when they subsequently reproduce, as a result of staying in the parental nest.
*Kin selection: since subsequent litters or broods from the same parents will be full siblings to the helpers, they are as closely related genetically as their own offspring would be. Helping their parents is therefore as productive for the juveniles as reproducing themselves would be, and if their parents are better able to reproduce, the balance of advantage may be greater.
*Delayed advantage to the helpers, in particular because they stand to inherit their parents&#x27; territory; this explanation is particularly compelling if suitable territories are in short supply, but requires specific quantitative conditions to be met, favouring a stable queue of potential heirs.

== Misconceptions ==
Although it is frequently assumed that helpers are non-breeders, molecular evidence suggests that this may happen, and the term &quot;secondary helper&quot; is sometimes used in this case to indicate helpers that mate with or are not related offspring of the pair being assisted. The term &quot;primary helper&quot; being used for the commoner case of the helper being offspring of the pair and not involved in mating. Extrapair mates are chosen by the females and are these then contribute to the care of the young who may be sired by them.

Juveniles living in association with their parents cannot automatically be regarded as helpers. In a number of species, such as the logrunners and the Siberian jay, young remain in the parental territory, but never help feed nestlings. However the delayed advantage explanation for the juveniles&#x27; association with their parents can still work in the absence of effective helping, whereas the kin selection explanation cannot.

== Associated effects ==

=== Reproductive success ===
Effects on reproductive success can be but are not always positive, and the strength of that positive correlation varies by species. Sometimes, the energy benefits to breeders, instead of being invested in improving reproductive performance, are used to offset reductions in reproductive performance. However, in many species, nestling survival rates are increased from helper investments. Further reproductive success benefits include better quality offspring, and nestling immune response.

=== Parental investment ===
Helpers at the nest can provide advantageous plasticity in the amount of investment parents need to give to their eggs and chicks. The presence of helpers can be associated with lower investments as the helpers can be depended on to provide certain elements of care and raising. For example, in the superb fairy-wren, nests with helpers present exhibit different average egg sizes than those without helpers. This plasticity can be seen in reference to change in climate conditions. In unfavourable conditions there is a need for female parents to maintain high egg investment, but in favourable conditions, egg investment by mothers declines as helpers can assist with some of the care-load. Superb fairy-wrens with helpers at the nest see average egg sizes increase in dry and hot conditions and decrease in colder conditions compared to nests without helpers.

== Helper variability ==
Generally, helpers provide a net benefit to parents raising offspring, but this benefit is not necessarily distributed uniformly. There can be an uneven distribution of benefits between species, or even between sexes within a species. Benefits provided by one sex may more heavily fluctuate according to various factors such as food availability. In acorn woodpeckers, while helpers of both sexes provide relatively the same benefit to reproductive success, male helper behaviour fluctuates. This fluctuation is dependent upon the size of recent acorn crops. Large acorn crops translate to increased behavioural effects from male helpers such as higher rates of granary tending and time spent in the home territory.

== Benefits and consequences for helpers ==
Helpers often also benefit from joining a breeding couple. After unsuccessfully breeding, juveniles may join breeding couples to become helpers. By opting to become helpers while still juveniles and having poor breeding prospects, helpers can benefit from increased survival rates. A trade-off of this increased survival over non-helper juveniles is that their successful breeding rate after becoming helpers decreases compared to non-helpers.

<text>A hearing aid is a device designed to improve hearing by making sound audible to a person with hearing loss. Hearing aids are classified as medical devices in most countries, and regulated by the respective regulations. Small audio amplifiers such as personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) or other plain sound reinforcing systems cannot be sold as &quot;hearing aids&quot;.

Early devices, such as ear trumpets or ear horns, were passive amplification cones designed to gather sound energy and direct it into the ear canal. 

Modern devices are computerised electroacoustic systems that transform environmental sound to make it audible, according to audiometrical and cognitive rules. Modern devices also utilize sophisticated digital signal processing, aiming to improve speech intelligibility and comfort for the user. Such signal processing includes feedback management, wide dynamic range compression, directionality, frequency lowering, and noise reduction.

Modern hearing aids require configuration to match the hearing loss, physical features, and lifestyle of the wearer. The hearing aid is fitted to the most recent audiogram and is programmed by frequency. This process, called &quot;fitting&quot;, can be performed by the user in simple cases, by a Doctor of Audiology (an AuD) - also called an audiologist, or by a Hearing Instrument Specialist (HIS) or audioprosthologist. The amount of benefit a hearing aid delivers depends in large part on the quality of its fitting. Almost all hearing aids in use in the United States of America are digital hearing aids, as analog aids are phased out. Devices similar to hearing aids include the osseointegrated auditory prosthesis (formerly called the bone-anchored hearing aid) and cochlear implant.
==Uses==
Hearing aids are used for a variety of pathologies including sensorineural hearing loss, conductive hearing loss, and single-sided deafness. Hearing aid candidacy was traditionally determined by a Doctor of Audiology, or a certified hearing specialist, who will also fit the device based on the nature and degree of the hearing loss being treated. The amount of benefit experienced by the user of the hearing aid is multi-factorial, depending on the type, severity, and etiology of the hearing loss, the technology and fitting of the device, and on the motivation, personality, lifestyle, and overall health of the user. Over-the-counter hearing aids, which address mild to moderate hearing loss, are designed to be adjusted by the user.

Hearing aids are incapable of truly correcting a hearing loss; they are an &quot;aid&quot; to make sounds more audible. The most common form of hearing loss for which hearing aids are sought is sensorineural, resulting from damage to the hair cells and synapses of the cochlea and auditory nerve. Sensorineural hearing loss reduces the sensitivity to sound, which a hearing aid can partially accommodate by making sound louder. Other decrements in auditory perception caused by sensorineural hearing loss, such as abnormal spectral and temporal processing, and which may negatively affect speech perception, are more difficult to compensate for using digital signal processing and in some cases may be exacerbated by the use of amplification. Conductive hearing losses, which do not involve damage to the cochlea, tend to be better treated by hearing aids; the hearing aid is able to sufficiently amplify sound to account for the attenuation caused by the conductive component. Once the sound is able to reach the cochlea at normal or near-normal levels, the cochlea and auditory nerve are able to transmit signals to the brain normally.

Common issues with hearing aid fitting and use are the occlusion effect, loudness recruitment, and understanding speech in noise. Once a common problem, feedback is generally now well-controlled through the use of feedback management algorithms.

== Candidacy and acquisition ==
There are lots of ways of evaluating how well a hearing aid compensates for hearing loss. One approach is audiometry which measures a subject&#x27;s hearing levels in laboratory conditions. The threshold of audibility for various sounds and intensities is measured in a variety of conditions. Although audiometric tests may attempt to mimic real-world conditions, the patient&#x27;s own every day experiences may differ. An alternative approach is self-report assessment, where the patient reports their experience with the hearing aid.

Hearing aid outcome can be represented by three dimensions:
# hearing aid usage
# aided speech recognition
# benefit/satisfaction

The most reliable method for assessing the correct adjustment of a hearing aid is through real ear measurement. Real ear measurements (or probe microphone measurements) are an assessment of the characteristics of hearing aid amplification near the ear drum using a silicone probe tube microphone.

Current research is also pointing towards hearing aids and proper amplification as a treatment for tinnitus, a medical condition which manifests itself as a ringing or buzzing in the ears.

==Types==
There are many types of hearing aids (also known as hearing instruments), which vary in size, power and circuitry.
Among the different sizes and models are:
===Body-worn===
Body worn aids were the first portable electronic hearing aids, and were invented by Harvey Fletcher while working at Bell Laboratories. Body aids consist of a case and an earmold, attached by a wire. The case contains the electronic amplifier components, controls and battery, while the earmold typically contains a miniature loudspeaker. The case is typically about the size of a pack of playing cards and is carried in a pocket or on a belt.
Without the size constraints of smaller hearing devices, body worn aid designs can provide large amplification and long battery life at a lower cost. Body aids are still used in emerging markets because of their relatively low cost.

===Behind the ear===
Behind the ear hearing aids are one of two major classes of hearing aids – behind the ear (BTE) and in the ear (ITE). These two classes are distinguished by where the hearing aid is worn. BTE hearing aids consist of a case which hangs behind the pinna. The case is attached to an earmold or dome tip by a traditional tube, slim tube, or wire. The tube or wire courses from the superior-ventral portion of the pinna to the concha, where the ear mold or dome tip inserts into the external auditory canal. The case contains the electronics, controls, battery, and microphone(s).The loudspeaker, or receiver, may be housed in the case (traditional BTE) or in the earmold or dome tip (receiver-in-the-canal, or RIC). The RIC style of BTE hearing aid is often smaller than a traditional BTE and more commonly used in more active populations.

BTEs are generally capable of providing more output and may therefore be indicated for more severe degrees of hearing loss. However, BTEs are very versatile and can be used for nearly any kind of hearing loss. BTEs come in a variety of sizes, ranging from a small, &quot;mini BTE&quot;, to larger, ultra-power devices. Size typically depends on the output level needed, the location of the receiver, and the presence or absence of a telecoil. BTEs are durable, easy to repair, and often have controls and battery doors that are easier to manipulate. BTEs are also easily connected to assistive listening devices, such as FM systems and induction loops. BTEs are commonly worn by children who need a durable type of hearing aid.

===In the ear===
In the ear aids (ITE) devices fit in the outer ear bowl (called the concha). Being larger, these are easier to insert and can hold extra features. They are sometimes visible when standing face to face with someone. ITE hearing aids are custom made to fit each individual&#x27;s ear. They can be used in mild to some severe hearing losses. Feedback, a squealing/whistling caused by sound (particularly high frequency sound) leaking and being amplified again, may be a problem for severe hearing losses. Some modern circuits are able to provide feedback regulation or cancellation to assist with this.
Venting may also cause feedback. A is a tube primarily placed to offer pressure equalization. However, different vent styles and sizes can be used to influence and prevent feedback.
Traditionally, ITEs have not been recommended for young children because their fit could not be as easily modified as the earmold for a BTE, and thus the aid had to be replaced frequently as the child grew. However, there are new ITEs made from a silicone type material that mitigates the need for costly replacements.
ITE hearing aids can be connected wirelessly to FM systems, for instance with a body-worn FM receiver with induction neck-loop which transmits the audio signal from the FM transmitter inductively to the telecoil inside the hearing instrument.

Mini in canal (MIC) or completely in canal (CIC) aids are generally not visible unless the viewer looks directly into the wearer&#x27;s ear. These aids are intended for mild to moderately severe losses. CICs are usually not recommended for people with good low-frequency hearing, as the occlusion effect is much more noticeable. Completely-in-the-canal hearing aids fit tightly deep in the ear. It is barely visible. Being small, it will not have a directional microphone, and its small batteries will have a short life, and the batteries and controls may be difficult to manage. Its position in the ear prevents wind noise and makes it easier to use phones without feedback. In-the-canal hearing aids are placed deep in the ear canal. They are barely visible. Larger versions of these can have directional microphones. Being in the canal, they are less likely to cause a plugged feeling. These models are easier to manipulate than the smaller completely in-the-canal models but still have the drawbacks of being rather small.

In-the-ear hearing aids are typically more expensive than behind-the-ear counterparts of equal functionality, because they are custom fitted to the patient&#x27;s ear.
In fitting, the audiologist takes a physical impression (mold) of the ear.
The mold is scanned by a specialized CAD system, resulting in a 3D model of the outer ear.
During modeling, the venting tube is inserted.
The digitally modeled &quot;shell&quot; is printed using a rapid prototyping technique such as stereolithography.
Finally, the aid is assembled and shipped to the audiologist after a quality check.

===Invisible-in-canal hearing aids===
Invisible-in-canal hearing aids (IIC) style of hearing aids fits inside the ear canal completely, leaving little to no trace of an installed hearing aid visible. This is because it fits deeper in the canal than other types, so that it is out of view even when looking directly into the ear bowl (concha). A comfortable fit is achieved because the shell of the aid is custom-made to the individual ear canal after taking a mold.
Invisible hearing aid types use venting and their deep placement in the ear canal to give a more natural experience of hearing. Unlike other hearing aid types, with the IIC aid the majority of the ear is not blocked (occluded) by a large plastic shell. This means that sound can be collected more naturally by the shape of the ear, and can travel down into the ear canal as it would with unassisted hearing. Depending on their size, some models allow the wearer to use a mobile phone as a remote control to alter memory and volume settings, instead of taking the IIC out to do this. IIC types are most suitable for users up to middle age, but are not suitable for elderly people with unsteady hands.

===Extended wear hearing aids===

Extended wear hearing aids are hearing devices that are non-surgically placed in the ear canal by a hearing professional. The extended wear hearing aid represents the first &quot;invisible&quot; hearing device. These devices are worn for 1–3 months at a time without removal. They are made of soft material designed to contour to each user and can be used by people with mild to moderately severe hearing loss. Their close proximity to the ear drum results in improved sound directionality and localization, reduced feedback, and improved high frequency gain. While traditional BTE or ITC hearing aids require daily insertion and removal, extended wear hearing aids are worn continuously and then replaced with a new device. Users can change volume and settings without the aid of a hearing professional. The devices are very useful for active individuals because their design protects against moisture and earwax and can be worn while exercising, showering, etc. Because the device&#x27;s placement within the ear canal makes them invisible to observers, extended wear hearing aids are popular with those who are self-conscious about the aesthetics of BTE or ITC hearing aid models. As with other hearing devices, compatibility is based on an individual&#x27;s hearing loss, ear size and shape, medical conditions, and lifestyle. The disadvantages include regular removal and reinsertion of the device when the battery dies, inability to go underwater, earplugs when showering, and for some discomfort with the fit since it is inserted deeply in the ear canal, the only part of the body where skin rests directly on top of bone.

===CROS hearing aid===

A CROS hearing aid is a hearing aid that transmits auditory information from one side of the head to the other side of the head. Candidates include people who have poor word understanding on one side, no hearing on one side, or who are not benefiting from a hearing aid on one side. CROS hearing aids can appear very similar to behind the ear hearing aids. The CROS system can assist the patient in sound localization and understanding auditory information on their poor side. While CROS hearing aids can be quite effective, the long-term solution for those with hearing issues on one side is to use a BiCROS system. This creates more of a balance for wearers.

===Bone-anchored===

A bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) is a surgically implanted auditory prosthetic based on bone conduction. It is an option for patients without external ear canals, when conventional hearing aids with a mold in the ear cannot be used. The BAHA uses the skull as a pathway for sound to travel to the inner ear. For people with conductive hearing loss, the BAHA bypasses the external auditory canal and middle ear, stimulating the functioning cochlea. For people with unilateral hearing loss, the BAHA uses the skull to conduct the sound from the deaf side to the side with the functioning cochlea.

Individuals under the age of two (five in the USA) typically wear the BAHA device on a Softband. This can be worn from the age of one month as babies tend to tolerate this arrangement very well. When the child&#x27;s skull bone is sufficiently thick, a titanium &quot;post&quot; can be surgically embedded into the skull with a small abutment exposed outside the skin. The BAHA sound processor sits on this abutment and transmits sound vibrations to the external abutment of the titanium implant. The implant vibrates the skull and inner ear, which stimulate the nerve fibers of the inner ear, allowing hearing.

The surgical procedure is simple both for the surgeon, involving very few risks for the experienced ear surgeon. For the patient, minimal discomfort and pain is reported. Patients may experience numbness of the area around the implant as small superficial nerves in the skin are sectioned during the procedure. This often disappears after some time. There is no risk of further hearing loss due to the surgery. One important feature of the BAHA is that, if a patient for whatever reason does not want to continue with the arrangement, it takes the surgeon less than a minute to remove it. The BAHA does not restrict the wearer from any activities such as outdoor life, sporting activities etc.

A BAHA can be connected to an FM system by attaching a miniaturized FM receiver to it.

Two main brands manufacture BAHAs today – the original inventors Cochlear, and the hearing aid company Oticon.

===Eyeglass aids===

During the late 1950s through 1970s, before in-the-ear aids became common (and in an era when thick-rimmed eyeglasses were popular), people who wore both glasses and hearing aids frequently chose a type of hearing aid that was built into the
temple pieces of the spectacles. However, the combination of glasses and hearing aids was inflexible: the range of frame styles was limited, and the user had to wear both hearing aids and glasses at once or wear neither. Today, people who use both glasses and hearing aids can use in-the-ear types, or rest a BTE neatly alongside the arm of the glasses. There are still some specialized situations where hearing aids built into the frame of eyeglasses can be useful, such as when a person has hearing loss mainly in one ear: sound from a microphone on the &quot;bad&quot; side can be sent through the frame to the side with better hearing.

This can also be achieved by using CROS or bi-CROS style hearing aids, which are now wireless in sending sound to the better side.

====Spectacle hearing aids====
These are generally worn by people with a hearing loss who either prefer a more cosmetic appeal of their hearing aids by being attached to their glasses or where sound cannot be passed in the normal way, via a hearing aids, perhaps due to a blockage in the ear canal. pathway or if the client experiences continual infections in the ear.
Spectacle aids come in two forms, &quot;bone conduction spectacles&quot; and &quot;air conduction spectacles&quot;.

====Bone conduction spectacles====
Sounds are transmitted via a receiver attached from the arm of the spectacles which are fitted firmly behind the boney portion of the skull at the back of the ear, (mastoid process) by means of pressure, applied on the arm of the spectacles. The sound is passed from the receiver on the arm of the spectacles to the inner ear (cochlea), via the bony portion. The process of transmitting the sound through the bone requires a great amount of power. Bone conduction aids generally have a poorer high pitch response and are therefore best used for &quot;conductive hearing losses&quot; or where it is impractical to fit standard hearing aids.

====Air conduction spectacles====
Unlike the bone conduction spectacles the sound is transmitted via hearing aids which are attached to the arm or arms of the spectacles. When removing your glasses for cleaning, the hearing aids are detached at the same time. Whilst there are genuine instances where spectacle aids are a preferred choice, they may not always be the most practical option.

====Directional spectacles====
These &#x27;hearing glasses&#x27; incorporate a directional microphone capability: four microphones on each side of the frame effectively work as two directional microphones, which are able to discern between sound coming from the front and sound coming from the sides or back of the user. This improves the signal-to-noise ratio by allowing for amplification of the sound coming from the front, the direction in which the user is looking, and active noise control for sounds coming from the sides or behind.
Only very recently has the technology required become small enough to be fitted in the frame of the glasses. As a recent addition to the market, this new hearing aid is currently available only in the Netherlands and Belgium.

=== Stethoscope ===
These hearing aids are designed for medical practitioners with hearing loss who use stethoscopes. The hearing aid is built into the speaker of the stethoscope, which amplifies the sound.

=== Hearing aid applications ===
Hearing aid applications (HAA) are software which, when installed on mobile computational platforms, transforms them into hearing aids.

The principle of HAA operation corresponds to the basic principles of operation of traditional hearing aids: the microphone receives an acoustic signal and converts it into a digital form. Sound amplification is achieved by the means of a mobile computational platform, in accordance with the degree and type of the user&#x27;s hearing loss. The processed audio signal is transformed into an audio signal and output to the user into the headphones/headset. Signal processing is implemented in real time.

Constructional features of mobile computational platforms imply preferred use of stereo headsets with two speakers, which allows carrying out binaural hearing correction for the left and right ear separately. HAAs can work with both wired and wireless headsets and headphones.

As a rule, HAAs have two operation modes: setup mode and hearing aid mode. Setup mode involves the user passing an in situ-audiometry procedure, which determines the user&#x27;s hearing characteristics. Hearing aid mode is a hearing correction system that corrects the user&#x27;s hearing in accordance with the user&#x27;s hearing thresholds. HAAs also incorporate background noise suppression and acoustic feedback suppression.

The user can independently choose a formula to enhance the sound, as well as adjust the level of the desired amplification to their wishes.

HAAs have several advantages (compared to traditional hearing aids):
* HAAs do not cause any psychological inconvenience;
* it is possible to achieve the highest sound pressure level and get high sound quality (due to large speakers and a long battery life);
* it is possible to use more complex audio signal processing algorithms and a higher sampling rate (because of capacious battery);
* the possibility to implement more convenient application control functions for people with poor motor skills;
* resistance to ingress of earwax and moisture;
* software flexibility;
* the large distance between the microphone and the speaker prevents the occurrence of acoustic feedback;
* the set up of HAAs in simple cases does not require special equipment and qualifications;
* the user does not need to purchase and carry any separate device;
* various types of headphones and headsets can be used.

HAAs also have some disadvantages (compared to traditional hearing aids):
* because the microphone is not located in the ear, it does not use the functional advantages of the auricle and the natural acoustics of the outer ear.
* they are more noticeable and less comfortable to wear.

==Technology==

The first electrical hearing aid used the carbon microphone of the telephone and was introduced in 1896. The vacuum tube made electronic amplification possible, but early versions of amplified hearing aids were too heavy to carry around. Miniaturization of vacuum tubes lead to portable models, and after World War II, wearable models using miniature tubes. The transistor invented in 1948 was well suited to the hearing aid application due to low power and small size; hearing aids were an early adopter of transistors. The development of integrated circuits allowed further improvement of the capabilities of wearable aids, including implementation of digital signal processing techniques and programmability for the individual user&#x27;s needs.

===Compatibility with telephones===

A hearing aid and a telephone are &quot;compatible&quot; when they can connect to each other in a way that produces clear, easily understood sound. The term &quot;compatibility&quot; is applied to all three types of telephones (wired, cordless, and mobile). There are two ways telephones and hearing aids can connect with each other:
* Acoustically: the &quot;sound&quot; from the phone&#x27;s speaker is picked up by the hearing aid&#x27;s microphone.
* Electromagnetically: the &quot;signal&quot; inside the phone&#x27;s speaker is picked up by the hearing aid&#x27;s &quot;telecoil&quot; or &quot;T-coil&quot;, a special loop of wire inside the hearing aid.

Note that telecoil coupling has nothing to do with the radio signal in a cellular or cordless phone: the audio signal picked up by the telecoil is the weak electromagnetic field that is generated by the voice coil in the phone&#x27;s speaker as it pushes the speaker cone back and forth.

The electromagnetic (telecoil) mode is usually more effective than the acoustic method. This is mainly because the microphone is often automatically switched off when the hearing aid is operating in telecoil mode, so background noise is not amplified. Since there is an electronic connection to the phone, the sound is clearer and distortion is less likely. But in order for this to work, the phone has to be hearing-aid compatible. More technically, the phone&#x27;s speaker has to have a voice coil that generates a relatively strong electromagnetic field. Speakers with strong voice coils are more expensive and require more energy than the tiny ones used in many modern telephones; phones with the small low-power speakers cannot couple electromagnetically with the telecoil in the hearing aid, so the hearing aid must then switch to acoustic mode. Also, many mobile phones emit high levels of electromagnetic noise that creates audible static in the hearing aid when the telecoil is used. A workaround that resolves this issue on many mobile phones is to plug a wired (not Bluetooth) headset into the mobile phone; with the headset placed near the hearing aid the phone can be held far enough away to attenuate the static. Another method is to use a &quot;neckloop&quot; (which is like a portable, around-the-neck induction loop), and plug the neckloop directly into the standard audio jack (headphones jack) of a smartphone (or laptop, or stereo, etc.). Then, with the hearing aids&#x27; telecoil turned on (usually a button to press), the sound will travel directly from the phone, through the neckloop and into the hearing aids&#x27; telecoils.

On 21 March 2007, the Telecommunications Industry Association issued the TIA-1083 standard, which gives manufacturers of cordless telephones the ability to test their products for compatibility with most hearing aids that have a T-Coil magnetic coupling mode. With this testing, digital cordless phone manufacturers will be able to inform consumers about which products will work with their hearing aids.

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has a ratings scale for compatibility between hearing aids and phones:
* When operating in acoustic (Microphone) mode, the ratings are from M1 (worst) to M4 (best).
* When operating in electromagnetic (Telecoil) mode, the ratings are from T1 (worst) to T4 (best).

The best possible rating is M4/T4 meaning that the phone works well in both modes. Devices rated below M3 are unsatisfactory for people with hearing aids.

Computer programs that allow the creation of a hearing aid using a PC, tablet or smartphone are currently gaining in popularity. Modern mobile devices have all the necessary components to implement this: hardware (an ordinary microphone and headphones may be used) and a high-performance microprocessor that carries digital sound processing according to a given algorithm.
Application configuration is carried out by the user themselves in accordance with the individual features of their hearing ability. The computational power of modern mobile devices is sufficient to produce the best sound quality. This, coupled with software application settings (for example, profile selection according to a sound environment) provides for high comfort and convenience of use.
In comparison with the digital hearing aid, mobile applications have the following advantages:
* acoustic gain is up to 30 dB (with a standard headset);
* complete invisibility (smartphone is not associated with a hearing aid);
* ease of use (no need to use additional devices, batteries and so on.);
* Fast switching between the external headset and phone microphone;
* free distribution of applications.
* High duration of the battery;
* high sampling frequency (44.1 kHz) providing for excellent sound quality;
* high wearing comfort;
* low delay in audio processing (from 6,3 to 15,7 ms – depending on the mobile device model);
* No loss of settings when switching from one gadget to another and back again;
* No need to get used to it, when changing mobile devices;
* user-friendly interface of software settings;
It should be clearly understood that &quot;hearing aid&quot; application for smartphone / tablet cannot be considered a complete substitution of a digital hearing aid, since the latter:
* is a medical device (exposed to the relevant procedures of testing and certification);
* is adjusted using audiometry procedures.
* is designed for use by doctor&#x27;s prescription;
Functionality of hearing aid applications may involve a hearing test (in situ audiometry) too. However, the results of the test are used only to adjust the device for comfortable working with the application. The procedure of hearing testing in any way cannot claim to replace an audiometry test carried out by a medical specialist, so cannot be a basis for diagnosis.
* Apps such as Oticon ON for certain iOS (Apple) and Android devices can assist in locating a lost/misplaced hearing aid.

===Wireless===
Recent hearing aids include wireless hearing aids. One hearing aid can transmit to the other side so that pressing one aid&#x27;s program button simultaneously changes the other aid, so that both aids change background settings simultaneously. FM listening systems are now emerging with wireless receivers integrated with the use of hearing aids. A separate wireless microphone can be given to a partner to wear in a restaurant, in the car, during leisure time, in the shopping mall, at lectures, or during religious services. The voice is transmitted wirelessly to the hearing aids eliminating the effects of distance and background noise. FM systems have shown to give the best speech understanding in noise of all available technologies.
FM systems can also be hooked up to a TV or a stereo.

2.4 gigahertz Bluetooth connectivity is the most recent innovation in wireless interfacing for hearing instruments to audio sources such as TV streamers or Bluetooth enabled mobile phones. Current hearing aids generally do not stream directly via Bluetooth but rather do so through a secondary streaming device (usually worn around the neck or in a pocket), this bluetooth enabled secondary device then streams wirelessly to the hearing aid but can only do so over a short distance. This technology can be applied to ready-to-wear devices (BTE, Mini BTE, RIE, etc.) or to custom made devices that fit directly into the ear.
In developed countries FM systems are considered a cornerstone in the treatment of hearing loss in children. More and more adults discover the benefits of wireless FM systems as well, especially since transmitters with different microphone settings and Bluetooth for wireless cell phone communication have become available.

Many theatres and lecture halls are now equipped with assistive listening systems that transmit the sound directly from the stage; audience members can borrow suitable receivers and hear the program without background noise. In some theatres and churches FM transmitters are available that work with the personal FM receivers of hearing instruments.

===Directional microphone===
Most older hearing aids have only an omnidirectional microphone. An omnidirectional microphone amplifies sounds equally from all directions. In contrast, a directional microphone amplifies sounds from one direction more than sounds from other directions. This means that sounds originating from the direction the system is steered toward are amplified more than sounds coming from other directions. If the desired speech arrives from the direction of steering and the noise is from a different direction, then compared to an omnidirectional microphone, a directional microphone provides a better signal-to-noise ratio. Improving the signal-to-noise ratio improves speech understanding in noise. Directional microphones have been found to be the second best method to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (the best method was an FM system, which locates the microphone near the mouth of the desired talker).

Many hearing aids have both an omnidirectional and a directional microphone mode. This is because the wearer may not need or desire the noise-reducing properties of the directional microphone in a given situation. Typically, the omnidirectional microphone mode is used in quiet listening situations (e.g. living room) whereas the directional microphone is used in noisy listening situations (e.g. restaurant). The microphone mode is typically selected manually by the wearer. Some hearing aids automatically switch the microphone mode.

Adaptive directional microphones automatically vary the direction of maximum amplification or rejection (to reduce an interfering directional sound source). The direction of amplification or rejection is varied by the hearing aid processor. The processor attempts to provide maximum amplification in the direction of the desired speech signal source or rejection in the direction of the interfering signal source. Unless the user manually temporarily switches to a &quot;restaurant program, forward only mode&quot; adaptive directional microphones frequently amplify the speech of other talkers in a cocktail party type environments, such as restaurants or coffee shops; this can also be helpful during business meetings. The presence of multiple speech signals makes it difficult for the processor to correctly select the desired speech signal. Another disadvantage is that some noises often contain characteristics similar to speech, making it difficult for the hearing aid processor to distinguish the speech from the noise. Despite the disadvantages, adaptive directional microphones can provide improved speech recognition in noise.

FM systems have been found to provide a better signal-to-noise ratio even at larger speaker-to-talker distances in simulated testing conditions.

===Telecoil===

Telecoils or T-coils (from &quot;Telephone Coils&quot;) are small devices installed in hearing aids or cochlear implants. An audio induction loop generates an electromagnetic field that can be detected by T-coils, allowing audio sources to be directly connected to a hearing aid. The T-coil is intended to help the wearer filter out background noise. They can be used with telephones, FM systems (with neck loops), and induction loop systems (also called &quot;hearing loops&quot;) that transmit sound to hearing aids from public address systems and TVs. In the UK and the Nordic countries, hearing loops are widely used in churches, shops, railway stations, and other public places. In the US, telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common. Audio induction loops, telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common also in Slovenia.

A T-coil consists of a metal core (or rod) around which ultra-fine wire is coiled. T-coils are also called induction coils because when the coil is placed in a magnetic field, an alternating electric current is induced in the wire (Ross, 2002b; Ross, 2004). The T-coil detects magnetic energy and transduces (converts) it to electrical energy. In the United States, the Telecommunications Industry Association&#x27;s TIA-1083 standard, specifies how analog handsets can interact with telecoil devices, to ensure the optimal performance.

Although T-coils are effectively a wide-band receiver, interference is unusual in most hearing loop situations. Interference can manifest as a buzzing sound, which varies in volume depending on the distance the wearer is from the source. Sources are electromagnetic fields, such as CRT computer monitors, older fluorescent lighting, some dimmer switches, many household electrical appliances and airplanes.

The states of Florida and Arizona have passed legislation that requires hearing professionals to inform patients about the usefulness of telecoils.

====Legislation affecting use====
In the United States, the Hearing Aid Compatibility Act of 1988 requires that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ensure that all telephones manufactured or imported for use in the United States after August 1989, and all &quot;essential&quot; telephones, be hearing aid-compatible (through the use of a telecoil).

&quot;Essential&quot; phones are defined as &quot;coin-operated telephones, telephones provided for emergency use, and other telephones frequently needed for use by persons using such hearing aids.&quot; These might include workplace telephones, telephones in confined settings (like hospitals and nursing homes), and telephones in hotel and motel rooms. Secure telephones, as well as telephones used with public mobile and private radio services, are exempt from the HAC Act. &quot;Secure&quot; phones are defined as &quot;telephones that are approved by the U.S. Government for the transmission of classified or sensitive voice communications.&quot;

In 2003, the FCC adopted rules to make digital wireless telephones compatible with hearing aids and cochlear implants. Although analog wireless phones do not usually cause interference with hearing aids or cochlear implants, digital wireless phones often do because of electromagnetic energy emitted by the phone&#x27;s antenna, backlight, or other components. The FCC has set a timetable for the development and sale of digital wireless telephones that are compatible with hearing aids. This effort promises to increase the number of digital wireless telephones that are hearing aid-compatible. Older generations of both cordless and mobile phones used analog technology.

===Audio boot===

An audio boot or audio shoe is an electronic device used with hearing aids; hearing aids often come with a special set of metal contacts for audio input. Typically the audio boot will fit around the end of the hearing aid (a behind-the-ear model, as in-the-ear do not afford any purchase for the connection) to link it with another device, like an FM system or a cellphone or even a digital audio player.

===Direct audio input===

Direct audio input (DAI) allows the hearing aid to be directly connected to an external audio source like a CD player or an assistive listening device (ALD). By its very nature, DAI is susceptible to far less electromagnetic interference, and yields a better quality audio signal as opposed to using a T-coil with standard headphones. An audio boot is a type of device that may be used to facilitate DAI.

===Processing===
Every electronic hearing aid has at minimum a microphone, a loudspeaker (commonly called a receiver), a battery, and electronic circuitry. The electronic circuitry varies among devices, even if they are the same style. The circuitry falls into three categories based on the type of audio processing (analog or digital) and the type of control circuitry (adjustable or programmable). Hearing aid devices generally do not contain processors strong enough to process complex signal algorithms for sound source localization.

====Analog====
Analog audio may have:
* Adjustable control: The audio circuit is analog with electronic components that can be adjusted. The hearing professional determines the gain and other specifications required for the wearer, and then adjusts the analog components either with small controls on the hearing aid itself or by having a laboratory build the hearing aid to meet those specifications. After the adjustment the resulting audio does not change any further, other than overall loudness that the wearer adjusts with a volume control. This type of circuitry is generally the least flexible. The first practical electronic hearing aid with adjustable analog audio circuitry was based on US Patent 2,017,358, &quot;Hearing Aid Apparatus and Amplifier&quot; by Samual Gordon Taylor, filed in 1932.
* Programmable control: The audio circuit is analog but with additional electronic control circuitry that can be programmed by an audiologist, often with more than one program. The electronic control circuitry can be fixed during manufacturing or in some cases, the hearing professional can use an external computer temporarily connected to the hearing aid to program the additional control circuitry. The wearer can change the program for different listening environments by pressing buttons either on the device itself or on a remote control or in some cases the additional control circuitry operates automatically. This type of circuitry is generally more flexible than simple adjustable controls. The first hearing aid with analog audio circuitry and automatic digital electronic control circuitry was based on US Patent 4,025,721, &quot;Method of and means for adaptively filtering near-stationary noise from speech&quot; by D Graupe, GD Causey, filed in 1975. This digital electronic control circuitry was used to identify and automatically reduce noise in individual frequency channels of the analog audio circuits and was known as the Zeta Noise Blocker.

====Digital====

Digital audio, programmable control: Both the audio circuit and the additional control circuits are fully digital. The hearing professional programs the hearing aid with an external computer temporarily connected to the device and can adjust all processing characteristics on an individual basis. Fully digital circuitry allows implementation of many additional features not possible with analog circuitry, can be used in all styles of hearing aids and is the most flexible; for example, digital hearing aids can be programmed to amplify certain frequencies more than others, and can provide better sound quality than analog hearing aids. Fully digital hearing aids can be programmed with multiple programs that can be invoked by the wearer, or that operate automatically and adaptively. These programs reduce acoustic feedback (whistling), reduce background noise, detect and automatically accommodate different listening environments (loud vs. soft, speech vs. music, quiet vs. noisy, etc.), control additional components such as multiple microphones to improve spatial hearing, transpose frequencies (shift high frequencies that a wearer may not hear to lower frequency regions where hearing may be better), and implement many other features. Fully digital circuitry also allows control over wireless transmission capability for both the audio and the control circuitry. Control signals in a hearing aid on one ear can be sent wirelessly to the control circuitry in the hearing aid on the opposite ear to ensure that the audio in both ears is either matched directly or that the audio contains intentional differences that mimic the differences in normal binaural hearing to preserve spatial hearing ability. Audio signals can be sent wirelessly to and from external devices through a separate module, often a small device worn like a pendant and commonly called a &quot;streamer&quot;, that allows wireless connection to yet other external devices. This capability allows optimal use of mobile telephones, personal music players, remote microphones and other devices. With the addition of speech recognition and internet capability in the mobile phone, the wearer has optimal communication ability in many more situations than with hearing aids alone. This growing list includes voice activated dialing, voice activated software applications either on the phone or on the internet, receipt of audio signals from databases on the phone or on internet, or audio signals from television sets or from global positioning systems. The first practical, wearable, fully digital hearing aid was invented by Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley Jr. and Gerald R Popelka. Their work resulted in US Patent 4,548,082, &quot;Hearing aids, signal supplying apparatus, systems for compensating hearing deficiencies, and methods&quot; by A Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley Jr. and Gerald R Popelka, filed in 1984. This patent formed the basis of all subsequent fully digital hearing aids from all manufacturers, including those produced currently.

The signal processing is performed by the microprocessor in real time and taking into account the individual preferences of the user (for example, increasing bass for better speech perception in noisy environments, or selective amplification of high frequencies for people with reduced sensibility to this range). The microprocessor automatically analyzes the nature of the external background noise and adapts the signal processing to the specific conditions (as well as to its change, for example, when the user goes outside from the building).

In speech enhancement, for example using neural networks, finds application in hearing aids. Problems may arise if these methods filter out emergency sounds such as fire alarms and car horns.

==== Difference between digital and analog hearing aids ====
Analogue hearing aids make all the sounds picked up by the microphone louder. For example, speech and ambient noise will be made louder together. On the other hand, digital hearing aid (DHA) technology processes the sound using digital technology. Before transmitting the sound to the speaker, the DHA microprocessor processes the digital signal received by the microphone according to an algorithm. This allows certain-frequency sounds to be made louder according to the individual user&#x27;s settings (personal audiogram), and the DHA can automatically adjust to various environments (noisy streets, quiet room, concert hall, etc.).

For users with varying degrees of hearing loss, it is difficult to perceive the entire frequency range of external sounds. DHAs with multi-channel digital processing allow a user to &quot;compose&quot; the output sound by fitting a whole spectrum of the input signal into it. This gives users with limited hearing abilities the opportunity to perceive the whole range of ambient sounds, despite the personal difficulties of perception of certain frequencies. Moreover, even in this &quot;narrow&quot; range the DHA microprocessor is able to emphasize desired sounds (e.g. speech), lowering unwanted loud, high, etc., sounds at the same time.

According to research DHAs have a number of significant advantages compared to analogue hearing aids:
* &quot;Self-learning&quot; and adaptive adjustment. They can implement adaptive selection of amplification parameters and processing.
* Effective acoustic feedback reduction. The acoustic whistling common to all hearing aids can be adaptively controlled.
* Effective use of directional microphones. Directional microphones can be adaptively controlled.
* Extended frequency range. A larger range of frequencies can be implemented with frequency shifting.
* Flexibility in selective amplification. They can provide more flexibility in frequency specific amplification to match the individual hearing characteristics of the user.
* Improved connection to other devices. Connection to other devices such as smartphones and televisions is possible.
* Noise reduction. They can reduce the background noise level to increase user comfort in noisy environments.
* Speech recognition. They can distinguish the speech signal from the overall spectrum of sounds, which facilitates speech perception.

These advantages of DHAs were confirmed by a number of studies relating to the comparative analysis of digital hearing aids of second and first generations and analog hearing aids.

==== Difference between digital hearing aids and hearing aid applications ====
Smartphones have all the necessary hardware to perform the functions of a digital hearing aid: microphone, AD converter, digital processor, DA converter, amplifier, and speakers. External microphone and speakers can also be connected as a special headset.

The operational principles of hearing aid applications correspond to general operational principles of digital hearing aids: the microphone perceives an acoustic signal and converts it to digital form. Sound amplification is achieved through hardware and software in accordance with the user&#x27;s hearing characteristics. Then, the signal is converted to analog form and received in the headphones by the user. The signal is processed in real time.

Stereo headsets with two speakers can be used, which allows separate binaural hearing correction for the left and right ear.

Unlike digital hearing aids, the adjustment of hearing aid applications is an integral part of the application itself. Hearing aid applications are adjusted in accordance with the user&#x27;s audiogram. The whole adjustment process is automated so that the user can perform audiometry on their own.

The hearing correction application has two modes: audiometry and correction. In the audiometry mode, hearing thresholds are measured. In the correction mode, the signal is processed with respect to the obtained thresholds.

Hearing aid applications also provide for different computational formulas for the calculation of sound amplification based on the audiometry data. These formulas are intended for maximum comfortable speech amplification and best sound intelligibility.

Hearing aid applications allow the user to save different user profiles for different acoustic environments. Thus, in contrast to the static settings of digital hearing aids, the user can quickly switch between the profiles depending on the acoustic environment.

One of the most important characteristics of the hearing aid is acoustic feedback. In hearing aid applications, there is a significant hardware delay, so hearing aid applications use a signal processing scheme with the minimum possible algorithmic delay to make it as short as possible.

== Difference between PSAP and digital hearing aids ==
Personal sound amplification products (PSAP) are classified by the FDA as &quot;personal sound amplification devices&quot;. These compact electronic devices are designed for people without hearing loss. Unlike hearing aids (which the FDA classifies as devices to compensate for hearing impairment), the use of PSAP does not require a medical prescription. Such devices are used by hunters, naturalists (for audio observation of animals or birds), ordinary people (for example, to increase the volume of the TV in a quiet room), etc. PSAP models differ significantly in price and functionality. Some devices simply amplify sound. Others contain directional microphones, equalizers to adjust the audio signal gain and filter noise. In modern days, some people refer to these devices as OTC hearing aids.

== Evolution of hearing aid applications ==
There are audio players designed specifically for the hard-of-hearing. These applications amplify the volume of the reproduced audio signal in accordance with the user&#x27;s hearing characteristics and act as a music volume amplifier and assistive hearing aid. The amplification algorithm works on the frequencies that the user hears worse, thus restoring natural hearing perception of the sound of music.

Just as in hearing aid applications, the player adjustment is based on the user&#x27;s audiogram.

There are also applications that not only adapt the sound of music but also include some hearing aid functions. Such applications include a sound amplification mode in accordance with the user&#x27;s hearing characteristics as well as a noise suppression mode and a mode allowing the user to hear ambient sound without pausing the music.

Also, some applications allow the hard-of-hearing to watch video and listen to the radio with comfort. The operational principles of these applications are similar to those of hearing aid applications: the audio signal is amplified on the frequencies that the user hears worse.

== Hearing aid adaptation ==
A person using a hearing aid for the first time often cannot make use of all its advantages quickly. The structure and characteristics of hearing aids are thoroughly devised by specialists in order to make the adjustment period as simple and quick as possible. However, despite this, a beginning hearing aid user certainly needs time to get used to it.

The process of adjusting to hearing prostheses consists of the following steps:
* Initial adjustment of the device
* Fine adjustments
* Adaptation to the new sound

Due to the plasticity of the central nervous system, inactive hearing centers in the brain&#x27;s cortex switch over to processing auditory stimuli in another frequency and intensity. The brain starts to perceive sounds amplified by the hearing aid immediately after the initial adjustment; however, it may not process them correctly right away.

Feeling the hearing aid in the ear may seem unusual. It also takes time to adapt to a new way of hearing. The ear has to be gradually adjusted to the new sound. The sound may seem unnatural, metallic, too loud or too quiet. A whistling sound may also appear, which can be unpleasant.

Hearing aids do not provide immediate improvement. The adjustment period can last from several hours to several months.

Patients are offered an initial schedule to wear their hearing aid, ensuring gradual adaptation to it. If the patient wears the hearing aid continually from the beginning, the unfamiliar sound may cause a headache, and as a result, the user may refuse to wear a hearing aid despite the fact that it helps. Audiologists often run a quick preparation course for the patients. As a rule, users have inflated expectations of hearing aids. They expect that hearing aids will help them to hear in the same way as before hearing loss, but it is not the case. Training sessions help hearing aid users to get accustomed to the feeling of new sounds. Users are strongly recommended to regularly visit an audiologist, including for the purposes of additional hearing aid adjustment.

Hearing aid applications, in contrast to traditional hearing aids, allow the implementation of options such as a built-in adaptation course.

The functions of the course may include:
* control of the amount of time spent on learning;
* control over the sequence of exercises;
* daily reminders to do the exercises.

The goal of the course is to help a user adapt to using a hearing aid application.

The adaptation course includes a certain number of stages, starting from listening to a set of low everyday sounds in a quiet environment, getting accustomed to one&#x27;s own speech and other people&#x27;s speech, getting accustomed to speech among background noise, etc.

==History==
The first hearing aids were ear trumpets, and were created in the 17th century. Some of the first hearing aids were external hearing aids. External hearing aids directed sounds in front of the ear and blocked all other noises. The apparatus would fit behind or in the ear.

The movement toward modern hearing aids began with the creation of the telephone, and the first electric hearing aid, the &quot;akouphone&quot;, was created about 1895 by Miller Reese Hutchison. By the late 20th century, digital hearing aids were commercially available.

The invention of the carbon microphone, transmitters, digital signal processing chip or DSP, and the development of computer technology helped transform the hearing aid to its present form.

===History of digital aids===
The history of DHA can be divided into three stages. The first stage began in the 1960s with the widespread use of digital computers for simulation of audio processing and for the analysis of systems and algorithms. The work was conducted with the help of the very large digital computers of that era. These efforts were not actual digital hearing aids because the computers were not fast enough for audio processing in real time and their size prevented them from being described as wearable, but they allowed successful studies of the various hardware circuits and algorithms for digital processing of audio signals. The software package Block of Compiled Diagrams (BLODI) developed by Kelly, Lockbaum and Vysotskiy in 1961 allowed simulation of any sound system that could be characterized in the form of a block diagram. A special phone was created so that a person with a hearing impairment could listen to the digitally processed signals, but not in real time. In 1967, Harry Levitt used BLODI to simulate a hearing aid on a digital computer.

Almost ten years later the second stage began with the creation of the hybrid hearing aid, in which the analog components of a conventional hearing aid consisting of amplifiers, filters and signal limiting were combined with a separate digital programmable component in a conventional hearing aid case. The audio processing remained analog but it was controlled by the digital programmable component. The digital component could be programmed by connecting the device to an external computer in the laboratory then disconnected to allow the hybrid device to function as a conventional wearable hearing aid.

The hybrid device was effective from a practical point of view because of the low power consumption and compact size. At that time, low-power analog amplifier technology was well developed in contrast to the available semiconductor chips able to process digital audio in real time. The combination of high performance analog components for real time audio processing and a separate low power digital programmable component only for controlling the analog signal led to the creation of several low power digital programmable components able to implement different types of control.

A hybrid hearing aid was developed by Etymotic Design. A little later, Mangold and Lane created a programmable multi-channel hybrid hearing aid. Graupe with co-authors developed a digital programmable component that implemented an adaptive noise filter.

The third stage began in the early 1980s by a research group at Central Institute for the Deaf headed up by faculty members at Washington University in St. Louis MO. This group created the first fully digital wearable hearing aid. They first conceived a complete, comprehensive full digital hearing aid, then designed and fabricated, miniaturized full digital computer chips using custom digital signal processing chips with low power and very large scale integrated (VLSI) chip technology able to process both the audio signal in real time and the control signals, yet able to be powered by a battery and be fully wearable as a full digital wearable hearing aid able to be actually used by individuals with hearing loss in real-world environments. Engebretson, Morley and Popelka were the inventors of the first full digital hearing aid. Their work resulted in US Patent 4,548,082, &quot;Hearing aids, signal supplying apparatus, systems for compensating hearing deficiencies, and methods&quot; by A Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley Jr. and Gerald R Popelka, filed in 1984 and issued in 1985. This full digital wearable hearing aid also included many additional features now used in all contemporary full digital hearing aids including a bidirectional interface with an external computer, self-calibration, self-adjustment, wide bandwidth, digital programmability, a fitting algorithm based on audibility, internal storage of digital programs, and fully digital multichannel amplitude compression and output limiting. This group created several of these full digital hearing aids and used them for research on hearing impaired people as they wore them in the same manner as conventional hearing aids in real-world situations. In this first full DHA all stages of sound processing and control were carried out in binary form. The external sound was picked up by a microphone positioned in an ITE ear module to take advantage of the acoustic effects of the pinna, then converted into binary code, digitally processed and digitally controlled in real time, then converted back to an analog signal sent to two miniature loudspeakers positioned in the same ITE ear module. The ITE module also contained an inward facing microphone to measure the sound actually generated in the ear canal, a precursor to separate probe tube measures now routinely used for hearing aid fitting. The necessary electronic components, including batteries, to support this arrangement were situated in a BTE module that could be supplemented with a body worn module. These specialized hearing aid chips continued to become smaller, increase in computational ability and require even less power. Now, virtually all commercial hearing aids are fully digital and their digital signal processing capability has significantly increased. Very small and very low power specialized digital hearing aid chips are now used in all hearing aids manufactured worldwide. Many additional new features also have been added with various on-board advanced wireless technology.

==Regulation==

=== Canada ===
Hearing aids are Class II regulated medical devices under Canada&#x27;s Food and Drugs Act.

Under Health Canada, the Medical Devices Directorate (MDD) regulates the safety, quality, and effectiveness of hearing aids. All hearing aids imported and sold in Canada are subject to a pre-market review. Post-market, Health Canada monitors the performance of the hearing aid and any consumer complaints.

Hearing aid financial assistance is available at both the federal and provincial level. Provincial hearing aid assistance and coverage can vary widely depending on the province and territory.

In Canada, a prescription is required to purchase hearing aids. Only licensed audiologists, Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) doctors, hearing instrument practitioners (where the profession exists), and &quot;audioprothésistes&quot; (in Quebec) can prescribe hearing aids. Over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids are currently not available for sale in Canada.

Canadian taxpayers can claim tax relief for hearing aids as a medical expense.

===Ireland===
Like much of the Irish health care system, hearing aid provision is a mixture of public and private.

Hearing aids are provided by the state to children, OAPs and to people whose income is at or below that of the state pension. The Irish state hearing aid provision is extremely poor; people often have to wait for two years for an appointment.

It is estimated that the total cost to the state of supplying one hearing aid exceeds €2,000.

Hearing aids are also available privately, and there is grant assistance available for insured workers. For the fiscal year ending 2016, the grant stands at a maximum of €500 per ear.

Irish taxpayers can also claim tax relief at the standard rate as hearing aids are recognised as a medical device.

Hearing aids in the Republic of Ireland are exempt from VAT.

Hearing aid providers in Ireland mostly belong to the Irish Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists.

===United States===
Ordinary hearing aids are Class I regulated medical devices under Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules. A 1976 statute explicitly prohibits any state requirement that is &quot;different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable&quot; to regulated medical devices (which includes hearing aids) which relates &quot;to the safety and effectiveness of the device&quot;. Inconsistent state regulation is preempted under the federal law. In the late 1970s, the FDA established federal rules governing hearing aid sales, and addressed various requests by state authorities for exemptions from federal preemption, granting some and denying others. The Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act (OTC Act) was passed under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, creating a class of hearing aids regulated by the FDA available directly to consumers without involvement from a licensed professional. This law&#x27;s provisions are expected to go into effect in 2020.

In August 2022, the FDA issued a final rule to improve access to hearing aids. The action establishes a new category of over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, enabling consumers with perceived mild to moderate hearing impairment to purchase hearing aids directly from stores or online retailers without the need for a medical exam, prescription or a fitting adjustment by an audiologist. The FDA action amends existing rules that apply to prescription hearing aids for consistency with the new OTC category, it repeals the conditions for sale for hearing aids, and it includes provisions that address some of the effects of the FDA OTC hearing aid regulations on state regulation of hearing aids. The FDA also issued the final guidance, Regulatory Requirements for Hearing Aid Devices and Personal Sound Amplification Products (PSAPs), to clarify the differences between hearing aids, which are medical devices, and PSAPs, consumer products that help people with normal hearing amplify sounds.

==Cost==
Several industrialized countries supply free or heavily discounted hearing aids through their publicly funded health care system.

===Australia===
The Australian Department of Health and Ageing provides eligible Australian citizens and residents with a basic hearing aid free-of-charge, though recipients can pay a &quot;top up&quot; charge if they wish to upgrade to a hearing aid with more or better features. Maintenance of these hearing aids and a regular supply of batteries is also provided, on payment of a small annual maintenance fee.

===Canada===
In Canada, health care is a responsibility of the provinces. In the province of Ontario, the price of hearing aids is partially reimbursed through the Assistive Devices Program of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term care, up to $500 for each hearing aid. Like eye appointments, audiological appointments are no longer covered through the provincial public health plan. Audiometric testing can still easily be obtained, often free of charge, in private sector hearing aid clinics and some ear, nose and throat doctors offices. Hearing aids may be covered to some extent by private insurance or in some cases through government programs such as Veterans Affairs Canada or Workplace Safety &amp; Insurance Board.

===Iceland===
Social Insurance pays a one time fee of ISK 30,000 for any kind of hearing aid. However, the rules are complicated and require that both ears have significant hearing loss in order to qualify for reimbursement. BTE hearing aids range from ISK 60,000 to ISK 300,000.

===India===
In India hearing aids of all kinds are easily available. Under central and state government health services, the poor can often avail themselves of free hearing devices. However, market prices vary for others and can range from Rs 10,000 to Rs 275,000 per ear.

===United Kingdom===
From 2000 to 2005 the Department of Health worked with Action on Hearing Loss (then called RNID) to improve the quality of NHS hearing aids so every NHS audiology department in England was fitting digital hearing aids by March 2005. By 2003 over 175,000 NHS digital hearing aids had been fitted to 125,000 people. Private companies were recruited to enhance the capacity, and two were appointed – David Ormerod Hearing Centres, partly owned by Alliance Boots and Ultravox Group, a subsidiary of Amplifon.

Within the UK, the NHS provides digital BTE hearing aids to NHS patients, on long-term loan, free of charge. Other than BAHAs (bone anchored hearing aid) or cochlear implants, where specifically required, BTEs are usually the only style available. Private purchases may be necessary if a user desires a different style. Batteries are free.

In 2014 the Clinical Commissioning Group in North Staffordshire considered proposals to end provision of free hearing aids for adults with mild to moderate age related hearing loss, which currently cost them £1.2m a year. Action on Hearing Loss mobilised a campaign against the proposal.

In June 2018 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence produced new guidance saying that hearing aids should be offered at the first opportunity when hearing loss affects the individual&#x27;s ability to hear and communicate, rather than waiting for arbitrary thresholds of hearing loss to be reached.

===United States===
Most private healthcare providers in the United States do not provide coverage for hearing aids, so all costs are usually borne by the recipient. The cost for a single hearing aid can vary between $500 and $6,000 or more, depending on the level of technology and whether the clinician bundles fitting fees into the cost of the hearing aid. Though if an adult has hearing loss which substantially limits major life activities, some state-run vocational rehabilitation programs can provide upwards of full financial assistance. Severe and profound hearing loss often falls within the &quot;substantially limiting&quot; category. Less expensive hearing aids can be found on the internet or mail order catalogs, but most in the under-$200 range tend to amplify the low frequencies of background noise, making it harder to hear the human voice.

Military veterans receiving VA medical care are eligible for hearing aids based on medical need. The Veterans Administration pays the full cost of testing and hearing aids to qualified military veterans. Major VA medical facilities provide complete diagnostic and audiology services.

The cost of hearing aids is a tax-deductible medical expense for those who itemize medical deductions.

Research involving more than 40,000 US households showed a convincing correlation between the degree of hearing loss and the reduction of personal income. According to the same research, hearing aids were shown to mitigate the impact of income loss by 90%–100% for those with milder hearing losses and from 65%–77% for those with severe to moderate hearing loss.

==Batteries==
While there are some instances that a hearing aid uses a rechargeable battery or a long-life disposable battery, the majority of modern hearing aids use one of five standard button cell zinc–air batteries. (Older hearing aids often used mercury battery cells, but these cells have become banned in most countries today.) Modern hearing aid button cell types are typically referred to by their common number name or the color of their packaging.

They are typically loaded into the hearing aid via a rotating battery door, with the flat side (case) as the positive terminal (cathode) and the rounded side as the negative terminal (anode).

These batteries all operate from 1.35 to 1.45 volts.

The type of battery a specific hearing aid utilizes depends on the physical size allowable and the desired lifetime of the battery, which is in turn determined by the power draw of the hearing aid device. Typical battery lifetimes run between 1 and 14 days (assuming 16-hour days).

<text>The two-color system of projection is a name given to a variety of methods of projecting a full-color image using (only) two different single-color projectors. James Clerk Maxwell first suggested he had discovered such a projection system, but it was not reproduced until the 1950s, when Edwin Land accidentally noticed a similar effect while working on his three-color system of projection.

Despite Land&#x27;s later work on the subject, the physics behind the success of this system of projection (and similar methods of apparent full-color projection involving only one color of light, sometimes in different polarizations) is not clearly understood since it involves not only the projected light but also the human visual system&#x27;s response to it.

<text>CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) is an independent information security certification granted by the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, also known as ISC2.

As of July 2022, there were 156,054 ISC2 members holding the CISSP certification worldwide.

In June 2004, the CISSP designation was accredited under the ANSI ISO/IEC Standard 17024:2003. It is also formally approved by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in their Information Assurance Technical (IAT), Managerial (IAM), and System Architect and Engineer (IASAE) categories for their DoDD 8570 certification requirement.

In May 2020, The UK National Academic Recognition Information Centre assessed the CISSP qualification as a Level 7 award, the same level as a master&#x27;s degree. The change enables cyber security professionals to use the CISSP certification towards further higher education course credits and also opens up opportunities for roles that require or recognize master&#x27;s degrees.

== History ==
In the mid-1980s, a need arose for a standardized, vendor-neutral certification program that provided structure and demonstrated competence. In November 1988, the Special Interest Group for Computer Security (SIG-CS), a member of the Data Processing Management Association (DPMA), brought together several organizations interested in this goal. The International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium or &quot;ISC2&quot; formed in mid-1989 as a non-profit organization.

By 1990, the first working committee to establish a &quot;Common Body of Knowledge&quot; (CBK) had been formed. The first version of the CBK was finalized by 1992, and the CISSP credential was launched by 1994.

In 2003 the CISSP was adopted as a baseline for the U.S. National Security Agency&#x27;s ISSEP program.

== Certification subject matter ==
The CISSP curriculum breaks the subject matter down into a variety of Information Security topics referred to as domains. The CISSP examination is based on what ISC2 terms the Common Body of Knowledge (or CBK). According to ISC2, &quot;the CISSP CBK is a taxonomy – a collection of topics relevant to information security professionals around the world. The CISSP CBK establishes a common framework of information security terms and principles that allow information security professionals worldwide to discuss, debate and resolve matters pertaining to the profession with a common understanding.&quot;

On April 15, 2024, a refreshed exam outline applies. The updates are the result of the Job Task Analysis (JTA), which is an analysis of the current content of the credential evaluated by ISC2 members on a triennial cycle. The impact of the change is limited to the weighting of the domains; the domains themselves did not change.

On 1 May 2021 there was a domain refresh that impacted the weighting of the domains; the domains themselves did not change.

From 15 April 2018, the eight domains covered are :
#Security and risk management
#Asset security
#Security architecture and engineering
#Communication and network security
#Identity and access management (IAM)
#Security assessment and testing
#Security operations
#Software development security

From 2015 to early 2018, the CISSP curriculum was divided into eight domains similar to the latest curriculum above. The only domain to have changed its name was &quot;Security Engineering&quot;, which in the 2018 revision was expanded to &quot;Security Architecture and Engineering&quot;.

Before 2015, it covered ten domains:

# Operations security
# Telecommunications and network security
# Information security governance and risk management
# Software development security
# Cryptography
# Security architecture and design
# Access control
# Business continuity and IT disaster recovery planning
# Legal, regulations, investigations and compliance
# Physical (environmental) security

== Requirements ==
* Possess a minimum of five years of direct full-time security work experience in two or more of the ISC2 information security domains (CBK). One year may be waived for having either a four-year college degree, a master&#x27;s degree in Information Security, or for possessing one of a number of other certifications. A candidate without the five years of experience may earn the Associate of ISC2 designation by passing the required CISSP examination, valid for a maximum of six years. During those six years a candidate will need to obtain the required experience and submit the required endorsement form for certification as a CISSP. Upon completion of the professional experience requirements the certification will be converted to CISSP status.
* Attest to the truth of their assertions regarding professional experience and accept the CISSP Code of Ethics.
* Answer questions regarding criminal history and related background.
* Pass the multiple choice CISSP exam (three hours, between 100 and 150 questions, in a computer adaptive test) with a scaled score of 700 points or greater out of 1000 possible points, you must achieve a pass in all eight domains.
* Have their qualifications endorsed by another ISC2 certification holder in good standing.

== Member counts ==
Number of CISSP members as of July, 2022 is 156,054.

== Concentrations ==
Holders of CISSP certifications can earn additional certifications in areas of speciality. There are three possibilities of the concentrations as listed below.

=== Information Systems Security Architecture Professional (CISSP-ISSAP) === 
It is an advanced information security certification issued by (ISC)² that focuses on the architecture aspects of information security. The certification exam consists of 125 questions covering six domain areas:
# Identity and Access Management Architecture
# Security Operations Architecture
# Infrastructure Security
# Architect for Governance, Compliance, and Risk Management
# Security Architecture Modeling
# Architect for Application Security

As of July, 2022, there were 2,307 ISC2 members holding the CISSP-ISSAP certification worldwide.

=== Information Systems Security Engineering Professional (CISSP-ISSEP) === 
It is an advanced information security certification issued by (ISC)² that focuses on the engineering aspects of information security across the systems development life cycle. In October 2014 it was announced that some of its curricula would be made available to the public by the United States Department of Homeland Security through its National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies program. Both ZDNet and Network World have named ISSEP one of tech&#x27;s most valuable certifications. The certification exam consists of 125 questions covering 5 domain area:
# Security Engineering Principles
# Risk Management
# Security Planning, Design, and Implementation
# Secure Operations, Maintenance, and Disposal
# Secure Engineering Technical Management

As of July, 2022, there were 1,382 ISC2 members holding the CISSP-ISSEP certification worldwide.

=== Information Systems Security Management Professional (CISSP-ISSMP) === 
It is an advanced information security certification issued by (ISC)² that focuses on the management aspects of information security. In September 2014, Computerworld rated ISSMP one of the top ten most valuable certifications in all of tech. The certification exam consists of 125 questions covering 6 domain areas:
# Leadership and Business Management
# Systems Lifecycle Management
# Risk Management
# Threat Intelligence and Incident Management
# Contingency Management
# Law, Ethics, and Security Compliance Management

As of July, 2022, there were 1,458 ISC2 members holding the CISSP-ISSMP certification worldwide.

== Fees and ongoing certification ==
The standard exam costs $749 US as of 2021. On completion of the exam, to gain certification you need to complete an endorsement process to evidence at least five years experience within a mix of the domains. A dispensation can be claimed for one year with the relevant academic qualification. The final step is payment of the annual maintenance fee of $135 (as of 2024).

The CISSP credential is valid for three years; holders renew either by submitting 40 Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits per year over three years or re-taking the exam.

CPE credits are gained by completing relevant professional education.

== Value ==
In 2005, &quot;Certification Magazine&quot; surveyed 35,167 IT professionals in 170 countries on compensation and found that CISSPs led their list of certificates ranked by salary. A 2006 &quot;Certification Magazine&quot; salary survey also ranked the CISSP credential highly, and ranked CISSP concentration certifications as the top best-paid credentials in IT.

In 2008, another study came to the conclusion that IT professionals in the Americas holding the CISSP (or other major security certifications) and at least 5 years of experience had salaries of up to 26% higher than IT professionals with similar experience levels who did not have such certificates. Note that any actual cause-and-effect relationship between the certificate and salaries remains unproven.

ANSI certifies that CISSP meets the requirements of ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard 17024, a personnel certification accreditation program.

<doc id="520294" wikidata="Q2066608" url="?curid=520294" title="Spray painting">
<text>Spray painting is a painting technique in which a device sprays coating material (paint, ink, varnish, etc.) through the air onto a surface. The most common types employ compressed gas—usually air—to atomize and direct the paint particles. 

Spray guns evolved from airbrushes, and the two are usually distinguished by their size and the size of the spray pattern they produce. Airbrushes are hand-held and used instead of a brush for detailed work such as photo retouching, painting nails, or fine art. Air gun spraying uses generally larger equipment. It is typically used for covering large surfaces with an even coating of liquid. Spray guns can either be automated or hand-held and have interchangeable heads to allow for different spray patterns. 

Single color aerosol paint cans are portable and easy to store.

==History==
Spraying paint with compressed air can be traced back to its use on the Southern Pacific Railroad in the early 1880s In 1887 Joseph Binks, the maintenance supervisor at Chicago&#x27;s Marshall Field&#x27;s Wholesale Store developed a hand-pumped cold-water paint spraying machine to apply whitewash to the subbasement walls of the store. Francis Davis Millet, the decorations director for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, used Binks and his spray painting system to apply whitewash consisting of a mix of oil and white lead to the buildings at the Exposition, taking considerably less time than traditional brush painting and turning it into what has been called the White City. In 1949, Edward Seymour developed a type of spray painting, aerosol paint, that could be delivered via a compressed aerosol in a can.

==Types==

===Air gun spraying===
This process occurs when the paint is applied to an object through the use of an air-pressurized spray gun. The air gun has a nozzle, paint basin, and air compressor. When the trigger is pressed the paint mixes with the compressed air stream and is released in a fine spray.
Due to a wide range of nozzle shapes and sizes, the consistency of the paint can be varied. The shape of the workpiece and the desired paint consistency and pattern are important factors when choosing a nozzle. The three most common nozzles are the full cone, hollow cone, and flat stream.
There are two types of air-gun spraying processes. In a manual operation method the air-gun sprayer is held by a skilled operator, about from the object, and moved back and forth over the surface, each stroke overlapping the previous to ensure a continuous coat. In an automatic process the gun head is attached to a mounting block and delivers the stream of paint from that position.
The object being painted is usually placed on rollers or a turntable to ensure overall equal coverage of all sides.

====High volume low pressure====
High volume low pressure (HVLP) is similar to a conventional spray gun using a compressor to supply the air, but the spray gun itself requires a lower pressure (LP). A higher volume (HV) of air is used to aerosolize and propel the paint at lower air pressure. The result is a higher proportion of paint reaching the target surface with reduced overspray, materials consumption, and air pollution.

A regulator is often required so that the air pressure from a conventional compressor can be lowered for the HVLP spray gun. Alternatively, a turbine unit (commonly containing a vacuum cleaner type motor, reverse mounted) can be used to propel the air without the need for an airline running to the compressor.

A rule of thumb puts two-thirds of the coating on the substrate and one third in the air. True HVLP guns use 8–20 cfm (13.6–34 m3/h), and an industrial compressor with a minimum of output is required. HVLP spray systems are used in the automotive, aviation, marine, decorative, architectural coating, furniture finishing, scenic painting, and cosmetic industries.

====Low volume low pressure====
Like HVLP, low volume low pressure (LVLP) spray guns also operate at a lower pressure (LP), but they use a low volume (LV) of air when compared to conventional and HVLP equipment. This is a further effort at increasing the transfer efficiency (amount of coating that ends up on the target surface) of spray guns while decreasing the amount of compressed air consumption. 

===Electrostatic spray painting===
Electrostatic painting was first patented in the U.S. by Harold Ransburg in the late 1940s. Harold Ransburg founded Ransburg Electrostatic Equipment and discovered that electrostatic spray painting was an immediate success as manufacturers quickly perceived the substantial materials savings that could be achieved. In electrostatic spray painting or powder coating, the atomized particles are made to be electrically charged, thereby repelling each other and spreading themselves evenly as they exit the spray nozzle. The object being painted is charged oppositely or grounded. The paint is then attracted to the object giving a more even coat than wet spray painting, and also greatly increasing the percentage of paint that sticks to the object. This method also means that paint covers hard to reach areas. The whole may then be baked to properly attach the paint: the powder turns into a type of plastic. Car body panels and bike frames are two examples where electrostatic spray painting is often used.

There are three main technologies for charging the fluid (liquid or powders):
*Direct charging: An electrode is immersed in the paint supply reservoir or the paint supply conduit.
*Tribo charging: This uses the friction of the fluid which is forced through the barrel of the paint gun. It rubs against the side of the barrel and builds up an electrostatic charge.
*Post-atomization charging: The atomized fluid comes into contact with an electrostatic field downstream of the outlet nozzle. The electrostatic field may be created by electrostatic induction or corona, or by one or more electrodes (electrode ring, mesh, or grid).

====Rotational bell====

With this method the paint is flung into the air by a spinning metal disc (&quot;bell&quot;). The metal disc also imparts an electrical charge to the coating particle.

===Electric fan===
There is a variety of hand-held paint sprayers that either combine the paint with air or convert the paint to tiny droplets and accelerate these out of a nozzle.

====Hot spray====
By heating the full-bodied paint to 60-80 °C, it is possible to apply a thicker coat. Originally the paint was recirculated, but as this caused bodying up, the system was changed to direct heating on line. Hot spraying was also used with Airless and Electrostatic Airless to decrease bounce-back. Two-pack materials usually had premix before tip systems using dual pumps.

====Air assisted airless spray guns====
These use air pressure and fluid pressure to achieve atomization of the coating. This equipment provides high transfer and increased application speed and is most often used with flat-line applications in factory finish shops.

The fluid pressure is provided by an airless pump, which allows much heavier materials to be sprayed than is possible with an air spray gun. Compressed air is introduced into the spray via an air nozzle (sometimes called air cap) similar to a standard conventional spray gun. The addition of compressed air improves the fineness of atomization. Additionally, unlike a pure airless spray gun, an AA gun has some control over fan spray to round spray. Some electric airless sprayers (Wagner and Graco) are fitted with a compressor to allow the use of an air-assisted airless gun in situations where portability is important.

===Airless spray guns===
These operate connected to a high-pressure pump commonly found using pressure to atomize the coating, using different tip sizes to achieve the desired atomization and spray pattern size. This type of system is used by contract painters to paint heavy duty industrial, chemical, and marine coatings and linings.

Advantages of airless spray are:
*The coating penetrates better into pits and crevices.
*A uniform thick coating is produced, reducing the number of coats required.
*A very &quot;wet&quot; coating is applied, ensuring good adhesion and flow-out.

Most coatings can be sprayed with very little thinner added, thereby reducing drying time and decreasing the release of solvent into the environment.

Care must be used when operating, as airless spray guns can cause serious injury, such as injection injuries, due to the paint ejecting from the nozzle at high pressure.

Airless pumps can be powered by different types of motor: electric, compressed air (pneumatic), or hydraulic. Most have a paint pump (also called a lower) that is a double-acting piston, in which the piston pumps the paint in both the down and the upstroke. Some airless pumps have a diaphragm instead of a piston, but both types have inlet and outlet valves.

Most electric-powered airless pumps have an electric motor connected through a gear train to the paint piston pump. The pressure is achieved by stopping and starting the motor via a pressure sensor (also called a transducer); in more advanced units, this is done by digital control in which the speed of the motor varies with the demand and the difference from the pressure set-point, resulting in very good pressure control. Some direct drive piston pumps are driven by a gasoline engine with pressure control via an electric clutch. In electric diaphragm pumps, the motor drives a hydraulic piston pump that transmits the oil displaced by the piston, to move the diaphragm.

Hydraulic and air-powered airless pumps have linear motors that require a hydraulic pump or an air compressor, which can be electric or gasoline-powered, although an air compressor is usually diesel-powered for mobile use or electric for fixed installations. Some airless units have the hydraulic pump and its motor, built onto the same chassis as the paint pump.

Hydraulic or air-powered airless provide a more uniform pressure control since the paint piston moves at a constant speed except when it changes direction. In most direct drive piston pumps, the piston is crankshaft driven in which the piston will be constantly changing speed. The linear motors of hydraulic or compressed air drive pumps are more efficient in converting engine power to material power than crankshaft-driven units.
All types of paint can be painted using an airless method.

===Automated linear spray systems===

Manufacturers who mass-produce wood products use automated spray systems, allowing them to paint materials at a very high rate with a minimum of personnel. Automated spray systems usually incorporate a paint-saving system that recovers paint not applied to the products. Commonly, linear spray systems are for products which are lying flat on a conveyor belt and then fed into a linear spray system, where automated spray guns are stationed above. When the material is directly below the guns, the guns begin to paint the material. Materials consist of lineal parts usually less than wide, such as window frames, wood molding, baseboard, casing, trim stock, and any other material that is simple in design.
These machines are commonly used to apply the stain, sealer, and lacquer. They can apply water- or solvent-based coatings. In recent years ultraviolet-cured coatings have become commonplace in profile finishing, and there are machines particularly suited to this type of coating.

===Automated flatline spray systems===

Mass-produced material is loaded on a conveyor belt where it is fed into one of these flatline machines. Flatline machines are designed to specifically paint material that is less than thick and complex in shape, for example, a kitchen cabinet door or drawer front. Spray guns are aligned above the material and the guns are in motion to hit all the grooves of the material. The guns can be moved in a cycle, circle, or can be moved back and forth to apply the paint evenly across the material. Flatline systems are typically large and can paint doors, kitchen cabinets, and other plastic or wooden products.

===Spray booth===

A spray booth is a pressure-controlled closed environment, originally used to paint vehicles in a body shop. Its effective design promotes efficient paint application, minimizing contamination and maximizing the quality of the finished product. To ensure the ideal working conditions (temperature, airflow, and humidity), these environments are equipped with ventilation, consisting of mechanical fans driven by electric motors, and optionally burners to heat the air to speed paint drying. Toxic solvents and paint particles are exhausted outside, possibly after filtering and treatment to reduce air pollution. Prevention of fires and dust explosions is also a high priority. To assist in the removal of the over sprayed paint from the air and to provide efficient operation of the down-draft, water-washed paint spray booths utilize paint detackifying chemical agents.

Artists may also make use of spray booth facilities to enable them to use spray paints (including automotive finishes) efficiently and safely. They may rent space and time in auto body shops or set up their facilities in association with schools or artist cooperatives.

==Safety==
Spray painting poses health hazards that affect the respiratory, nervous, and circulatory systems. Similarly, using solvents to clean one&#x27;s hands of paint marks and residue may cause skin irritation or even more serious issues since many are carcinogenic or neurotoxic. There are risks involved in working with substances such as paint and thinner, which contain compounds that are potentially harmful to health, or even fatal.

Appropriate training for personnel who are responsible for conducting the painting procedures is important, which may be from a professional training provider or the product supplier. There are also hazards related to the disposal of wastes and materials that are contaminated with potentially harmful chemicals. Decontamination procedures and Material Safety Data Sheets for various products are important. Safety is improved through:

*Personal protective equipment (PPE) use: PPE must be used when handling spray paint materials, particularly PPE that offers protection to the skin. Some of the essential personal protective equipment are overalls with a hood, protective goggles for the eyes, half-mask respirators, and single-use nitrile gloves. One of the most essential types of PPE is respiratory protective equipment (RPE). Nevertheless, basic RPE does not offer ample protection from the negative effects of isocyanates in human tissue. Paint products containing isocyanates must be handled while donning an air-fed RPE that has a 20 or higher APF (assigned protection factor). Air-fed respiratory protective equipment needs extra attention since they provide breathable air to the user. When in use, measures must be implemented to prevent contamination of the air supply since there is a risk of harmful substances entering the intake valve if it is not positioned outside of the spray area.
*Health monitoring: To avoid the development of illnesses associated with exposure to isocyanates, health authorities recommend that people who use spray paint products that contain the substance provide a urine sample after a work shift at least once a year, with high frequencies in first few months on the job. A urine sample with ascertain levels of exposure, not the presence of disease associated with harmful chemicals.
*Proper storage: Since paints and thinners are fire hazards, extra care must be taken not only while they are in use. Fire safety should also be considered when storing paint supplies. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provides guidelines for the proper storage of flammable materials. Many products used in spray paint are flammable such that fire risk is likely within a distance of 15 cm from the nozzle. As such, ignition sources must be placed at a safe distance. Also, there is a risk of dust explosions when finely-divided paint particles become airborne.
*Proper recordkeeping: One of the basic tenets of risk control is the maintenance of updated health records of personnel handling spray paint products. Confidential data on biological monitoring results must be appropriately kept. Records of the schedule and result of testing procedures should also be kept. Some of the most important tests to be conducted regularly are air quality testing, testing of pressure systems and electrical systems, and testing of compressor reservoir air filters.

== Chemical hazards ==
There are several types of paints in the market which are customized for different applications. Their components varying according to the application needs but often contain substances that can be toxic when inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Painters, and other workers in his or her proximity a are exposed primarily to solvents. The mechanical removal of paint can lead to exposure to pigments and fillers. Two common components include:

=== Acetone ===
Spray paints contain hazardous chemicals that can expose a worker to possible side effects. One of the most commonly used chemicals in spray paints includes acetone. Acetone is a clear, heavily scented liquid that is used in common industrial products but also found organically. The chemical is on the ‘Right to Know Hazardous Substance’ list as well as the ‘Special Health Hazard Substance List.’ It is highly flammable and should be treated with mindful handling. In the workplace, exposure can come from inhalation or direct contact, like dermal or oral. There are current regulations regarding the exposure to acetone in the workplace due to the possible health risks. When inhaled, irritation to the nose, throat, and lungs have been found to occur. Dermal contact can also result in skin irritation along with dryness and redness. If the chemical is of high concentration, side effects such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, and loss of consciousness can occur. Long term impacts have been minimally studied with a current consensus of the liver and kidney being affected. Prolonged contact with acetone is discouraged. 

In the workplace, prevention of exposure is recommended. When storing acetone, it should be handled in a closed container, stored in a location that maintains safe temperatures, and away from possible flame exposures. For dermal exposure prevention, PPE such as gloves or garments that can act as a barrier is recommended. Inhalation exposure can be prevented by regulating air circulation as well as using protection such as filters or respirators. 

=== Xylene ===
Xylene is a solvent that is often used in paints including spray paint and therefore found in many spray-painting environments. Xylene is a colorless and flammable liquid that is also a hazard to the wellbeing of many humans. Xylene is harmful when exposed to human skin or, in more extreme cases, eyes, nose, and throat. Symptoms of xylene exposure can come in many forms including headaches; dizziness; confusion; loss of muscle coordination; and in high doses, even death. Workers who are exposed can show an array of various symptoms, but the severity of these symptoms ultimately depends on the duration of exposure, consistency, and what protective measures are used to prevent the harmful effects of xylene. This can be a big issue for spray painters who are exposed every day especially if individuals are not wearing proper equipment to combat these fumes. At high levels of exposure, xylene can have effects on the central nervous system. This can cause extreme fatigue and nausea and potentially lead to unconsciousness. Unfortunately for many avid spray painters, the effects of xylene only grow more severe with extended and consistent exposure. 

Long term exposure to xylene may contribute to many chronic health issues. It can potentially affect certain organs within the human body including the liver, kidneys, and even cognitive functions relating to the brain. Xylene has shown to have negative effects on memory and concentration. To reduce these risks, it is essential that safety equipment such as good ventilation, protective wear, and safe handling practices are used when handling spray paint. 

==Problems with the finishing==
*Orange peel, an undesirable rippled texture
*Fisheye, blemishes caused by contamination such as oil or water

==Other applications==

One application of spray painting is graffiti. The introduction of inexpensive and portable aerosol paint has been a boon to this art form, which has spread all over the world. Spray painting has also been used in fine art. Jules Olitski, Dan Christensen, Peter Reginato, Sir Anthony Caro, and Jean-Michel Basquiat have used airbrushes, for both painting and sculpture.

<doc id="520298" wikidata="Q7728843" url="?curid=520298" title="The Dancing Wu Li Masters">
<text>The Dancing Wu Li Masters is a 1979 book by Gary Zukav, a popular science work exploring modern physics, and quantum phenomena in particular. It was awarded a 1980 U.S. National Book Award in category of Science. Although it explores empirical topics in modern physics research, &quot;The Dancing Wu Li Masters&quot; gained attention for leveraging metaphors taken from eastern spiritual movements, in particular the Huayen school of Buddhism with the monk Fazang&#x27;s treatise on the Golden Lion, to explain quantum phenomena and has been regarded by some reviewers as a New Age work, although the book is mostly concerned with the work of pioneers in western physics down through the ages.

The toneless pinyin phrase &quot;Wu Li&quot; in the title is most accurately rendered in Chinese characters, one Chinese translation of the word &quot;physics&quot; (wù lǐ 物理) in the light of the book&#x27;s subject matter. This becomes somewhat of a pun as there are many other Chinese characters that could be rendered as &quot;wu li&quot; in atonal pinyin, and chapters of the book are each titled with alternative translations of &quot;Wu Li&quot;, such as &quot;Nonsense&quot; (wú lǐ 無理), &quot;My Way&quot; and &quot;I Clutch My Ideas&quot;. Zukav participated as a journalist in a 1976 physics conference of eastern and western scientists at Esalen Institute, California; and he used the occasion as material for his book. At the conference, it was said that the Chinese term for physics is &#x27;Wu Li&#x27;, or &quot;patterns of organic energy.&quot; Zukav, among others, conceptualized &#x27;physics&#x27; as the dance of the Wu Li Masters – teachers of physical essence. Zukav explains the concept further:

:&quot;The Wu Li Master dances with his student. The Wu Li Master does not teach, but the student learns. The Wu Li Master always begins at the center, the heart of the matter...&quot;

<text>Big Ben (April 20, 1976 – December 11, 1999) was a world champion show jumping horse and famous Belgian Warmblood.

==Birth and acquisition by Ian Millar==
First named &quot;Winston&quot;, Big Ben was born at the van Hooydonk Farm in Kalmthout (northern Belgium). Although his dam was only , Big Ben grew to be a very large horse standing high. Soon after, he was purchased for Canadian equestrian Ian Millar for $45,000 and permanently relocated to Millar Brooke Farm in Perth, Ontario, Canada. Several lucrative offers were made to buy Big Ben throughout his career, but the ownership group, as well as Ian Millar, had such a strong bond with him that they refused all offers.

==Career==
In 1984, the horse began competing in show jumping events, touching off what would become a long and successful career. Millar rode Big Ben to more than 40 Grand Prix titles including six Spruce Meadows Derbys, as well as taking the world cup show jumping championship two years in a row - the first World Cup Final coming at Gothenburg, Sweden in 1988, and then again the next year in Tampa, Florida. In 1989 he won the Grand Prix of Bordeaux, France and the Grand Prix of Stuttgart, Germany, ranking Millar number one in the world. Millar and Big Ben also won the du Maurier International twice, in 1987 and 1991, the world&#x27;s richest grand prix event at that time.

In 1992 Big Ben survived two bouts with colic and an accident in which his horse trailer overturned on a highway after a head-on collision with a car. Two other horses died, and a third became unrideable due to its injuries. A fourth would never enter a trailer again. Big Ben won a Grand Prix only 2 months later. After much talk about his mounting injuries, he would go on to win his sixth Spruce Meadows Derby in front of 50,000 spectators. This was his final derby appearance. 
==Retirement and death==

After 11 years of competition, Big Ben was retired to Millar Brooke Farm in 1994. On December 11, 1999, two veterinarians informed Millar that Big Ben was suffering from a third, untreatable case of colic. He was euthanized at Millar Brooke Farm at 23 years of age. He was buried on a knoll overlooking the farm.

==Honours and memorials==
In 1999, Big Ben was recognised as a Canadian icon when Canada Post honoured him with his own stamp. Big Ben was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame and joined Thoroughbred racehorse Northern Dancer as the only other horse in the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. His story is told in the book titled &quot;Big Ben&quot;, by author Lawrence Scanlan.

In 2000, Big Ben&#x27;s personal groom, Sandra Patterson, wrote a tribute to Big Ben in the book titled &quot;An Apple a Day: A Heartwarming Collection of True Horse Stories&quot; edited by Kimberly Gatto. In 2005, the Perth and District Chamber of Commerce erected a bronze statue of Big Ben, with Ian Millar riding, in a park on the banks of the Tay River in downtown Perth, Ontario. Big Ben&#x27;s image lives on as a Breyer model horse.

In 2011, a book titled Unbridled Passion: Show Jumping&#x27;s Greatest Horses and Riders, written by Jeff Papows, featured Big Ben and his owner and rider, Ian Millar. The book documented the challenges, such as the two bouts of life-threatening colic surgery, that Big Ben faced inside and outside the competitive ring. It features original research and interviews with Ian Miller and Big Ben&#x27;s personal groom, Sandi Patterson.

* One of only two horses inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame.

==Pedigree==
Big Ben&#x27;s sire was Etretat, a or French chestnut stallion who was 3⁄4 Thoroughbred, and 1⁄4 Selle Français, registered as a Selle Français. His dam, Oekie, was a chestnut mare who was 3⁄4 Gelderlander and 1⁄4 Selle Français, registered as a Belgian Warmblood. Similar Selle Français, Gelderlander, and Thoroughbred crosses were used to create the closely-related Dutch Warmblood horse breed.

Big Ben was descended in the male line from Precipitation (1933 – 1957), an influential British-bred Thoroughbred stallion who is found in the pedigrees of many racehorses and sport horses today. Precipitation was responsible for helping maintain the Matchem (1748 – 1781) and Godolphin Arabian sireline. Big Ben&#x27;s dam, Oekie, was descended in the male line from Furioso (1939 – 1968), an influential Thoroughbred sire of sport horses who was also sired by Precipitation.

It is unclear where Big Ben&#x27;s large height came from in his pedigree. His ancestors ranged from to , based on registration and studbook records.

<text>Law and Justice ( , PiS) is a right-wing populist and national-conservative political party in Poland. The party is a member of European Conservatives and Reformists Group. Its chairman had been Jarosław Kaczyński since 18 January 2003. 

It was founded in 2001 by Jarosław and Lech Kaczyński as a direct successor of the Centre Agreement after it split from the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS). It won the 2005 parliamentary and presidential elections, after which Lech became the president of Poland. It headed a parliamentary coalition with the League of Polish Families and Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland between 2005 and the 2007 election. It placed second and they remained in the parliamentary opposition until 2015. It regained the presidency in the 2015 election, and later won a majority of seats in the parliamentary election. They retained the positions following the 2019 and 2020 election, but lost their majority following the 2023 Polish parliamentary election.

During its foundation, it sought to position itself as a centrist Christian democratic party, although shortly after, it adopted more culturally and socially conservative views and began their shift to the right. Under Kaczyński&#x27;s national-conservative and law and order agenda, PiS embraced economic interventionism. It has also pursued close relations with the Catholic Church, although in 2011, the Catholic-nationalist faction split off to form United Poland. During the 2010s, it also adopted right-wing populist positions. After regaining power, PiS gained popularity with more populist and social policies.

It is a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists, and on national-level, it heads the United Right coalition. It currently holds 190 seats in the Sejm and 34 in the Senate.

It has attracted widespread international criticism and domestic protest movements for allegedly dismantling liberal-democratic checks and balances.

==History==
===Formation===
The party was created on a wave of popularity gained by Lech Kaczyński while heading the Polish Ministry of Justice (June 2000 to July 2001) in the AWS-led government, although local committees began appearing from 22 March 2001. The AWS itself was created from a diverse array of many small political parties. In the 2001 general election, PiS gained 44 (of 460) seats in the lower chamber of the Polish Parliament (Sejm) with 9.5% of votes. In 2002, Lech Kaczyński was elected mayor of Warsaw. He handed the party leadership to his twin brother Jarosław in 2003.

===In coalition government: 2005–2007===

In the 2005 general election, PiS took first place with 27.0% of votes, which gave it 155 out of 460 seats in the Sejm and 49 out of 100 seats in the Senate. It was almost universally expected that the two largest parties, PiS and Civic Platform (PO), would form a coalition government. The putative coalition parties had a falling out, however, related to a fierce contest for the Polish presidency. In the end, Lech Kaczyński won the second round of the presidential election on 23 October 2005 with 54.0% of the vote, ahead of Donald Tusk, the PO candidate.

After the 2005 elections, Jarosław should have become prime minister. However, in order to improve his brother&#x27;s chances of winning the presidential election (the first round of which was scheduled two weeks after the parliamentary election), PiS formed a minority government headed by Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz as prime minister, an arrangement that eventually turned out to be unworkable. In July 2006, PiS formed a right-wing coalition government with the agrarian populist Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland and the nationalist League of Polish Families, headed by Jarosław Kaczyński. Association with these parties, on the margins of Polish politics, severely affected the reputation of PiS. When accusations of corruption and sexual harassment against Andrzej Lepper, the leader of Self-Defence, surfaced, PiS chose to end the coalition and called for new elections.

===In opposition: 2007–2015===

In the 2007 general election, PiS managed to secure 32.1% of votes. Although an improvement over its showing from 2005, the results were nevertheless a defeat for the party, as Civic Platform (PO) gathered 41.5%. The party won 166 out of 460 seats in the Sejm and 39 seats in Poland&#x27;s Senate.

On 10 April 2010, its former leader Lech Kaczyński died in the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash. Jarosław Kaczyński became the sole leader of the party. He was the presidential candidate in the 2010 elections. In the 2010 election, Jarosław gathered 46.99% of the vote, losing to Civic Platform candidate Bronislaw Komorowski, who won with 53.01%.

===In majority government: 2015–2023===


The party won the 2015 parliamentary election, this time with an outright majority—something no Polish party had done since the fall of communism. In the normal course of events, this should have made Jarosław Kaczyński prime minister for a second time. However, Beata Szydło, perceived as being somewhat more moderate than Kaczyński, had been tapped as PiS&#x27;s candidate for prime minister.

The party supported controversial reforms carried out by the Hungarian Fidesz party, with Jarosław Kaczyński declaring in 2011 that &quot;a day will come when we have a Budapest in Warsaw&quot;. PiS&#x27;s 2015 victory prompted creation of a cross-party opposition movement, the Committee for the Defence of Democracy (KOD). Law and Justice has Proposed 2017 judicial reforms, which according to the party were meant to improve efficiency of the justice system, sparked protest as they were seen as undermining judicial independence. While these reforms were initially unexpectedly vetoed by President Duda, he later signed them into law. In 2017, the European Union began an Article 7 infringement procedure against Poland due to a &quot;clear risk of a serious breach&quot; in the rule of law and fundamental values of the European Union.

The party has caused what constitutional law scholar Wojciech Sadurski termed a &quot;constitutional breakdown&quot; by packing the Constitutional Court with its supporters, undermining parliamentary procedure, and reducing the president&#x27;s and prime minister&#x27;s offices in favour of power being wielded extra-constitutionally by party leader Jarosław Kaczyński. After eliminating constitutional checks, the government then moved to curtail the activities of NGOs and independent media, restrict freedom of speech and assembly, and reduce the qualifications required for civil service jobs in order to fill these positions with party loyalists. The media law was changed to give the governing party control of the state media, which was turned into a partisan outlet, with dissenting journalists fired from their jobs. Due to these political changes, Poland has been termed an &quot;illiberal democracy&quot;, &quot;plebiscitarian authoritarianism&quot;, or &quot;velvet dictatorship with a façade of democracy&quot;.

The party won reelection in the 2019 parliamentary election. With 44% of the popular vote, Law and Justice received the highest vote share by any party since Poland returned to democracy in 1989, but lost its majority in the Senate.

===In opposition: 2023–present===
The United Right alliance placed first for the third straight election and won a plurality of seats but fell short of a Sejm majority. The opposition, consisting of the Civic Coalition, Third Way, and The Left, achieved a combined total vote of 54%, managing to form a majority coalition government. Although PiS would be unable to govern on its own, the Polish president Andrzej Duda stated his intention to re-appoint the incumbent Mateusz Morawiecki as prime minister due to the existing albeit unofficial convention of nominating a member of the winning party. The four opposition parties criticized Duda&#x27;s decision as a delay tactic. The opposition parties subsequently signed a coalition agreement on 10 November, de facto taking over control of the Sejm, and agreed to nominate former prime minister and European Council President Donald Tusk as their candidate. Morawiecki&#x27;s new cabinet, dubbed &quot;two-week government&quot; and &quot;zombie government&quot; by the media due to its anticipated short-livedness, was sworn in on 27 November 2023. As expected, the Morawiecki&#x27;s government was defeated in the Sejm on 11 December 2023, effectively ending its tenure.

===Breakaways===
In January 2010, a breakaway faction led by Jerzy Polaczek split from the party to form Poland Plus. Its seven members of the Sejm came from the centrist, economically liberal wing of the party. On 24 September 2010, the group was disbanded, with most of its Sejm members, including Polaczek, returning to Law and Justice.

On 16 November 2010, MPs Joanna Kluzik-Rostkowska, Elżbieta Jakubiak and Paweł Poncyljusz, and MEPs Adam Bielan and Michał Kamiński formed a new political group, Poland Comes First (&quot;Polska jest Najważniejsza&quot;). Kamiński claimed that the Law and Justice party had been taken over by far-right extremists. The breakaway party formed following dissatisfaction with the direction and leadership of Kaczyński.

On 4 November 2011, MEPs Zbigniew Ziobro, Jacek Kurski, and Tadeusz Cymański were ejected from the party, after Ziobro urged the party to split further into two separate parties – centrist and nationalist – with the three representing the nationalist faction. Ziobro&#x27;s supporters, most of whom on the right-wing of the party, formed a new group in Parliament called Solidary Poland, leading to their expulsion, too. United Poland was formed as a formally separate party in March 2012, but has not threatened Law and Justice in opinion polls.

United Poland which would later become Sovereign Poland merged with Law and Justice on 12 October 2024 during PiS congress in Przysucha.

==Base of support==


Like Civic Platform, but unlike the fringe parties to the right, Law and Justice originated from the anti-communist Solidarity trade union (which is a major cleavage in Polish politics), which was not a theocratic organisation. Solidarity&#x27;s leadership wanted to back Law and Justice in 2005, but was held back by the union&#x27;s last experience of party politics, in backing Solidarity Electoral Action.

Today, the party enjoys great support among working class constituencies and union members. Groups that vote for the party include miners, farmers, shopkeepers, unskilled workers, the unemployed, and pensioners. With its left-wing approach toward economics, the party attracts voters who feel that economic liberalisation and European integration have left them behind. The party&#x27;s core support derives from older, religious people who value conservatism and patriotism. PiS voters are usually located in rural areas and small towns. The strongest region of support is the southeastern part of the country. Voters without a university degree tend to prefer the party more than college-educated voters do.

Regionally, it has more support in regions of Poland that were historically part of western Galicia-Lodomeria and Congress Poland. Since 2015, the borders of support are not as clear as before and party enjoys support in western parts of country, especially these deprived ones. Large cities in all regions are more likely to vote for a more liberal party like PO or .N. Still, PiS receives good support from poor and working class areas in large cities.

Based on this voter profile, Law and Justice forms the core of the conservative post-Solidarity bloc, along with the League of Polish Families and Solidarity Electoral Action, as opposed to liberal conservative post-Solidarity bloc of Civic Platform. The most prominent feature of PiS voters was their emphasis on decommunisation.

==Ideology==

The ideological roots of Law and Justice go back to the late 1980s to a Christian-democratic and nationalist wing of the Solidarity movement. The party derives from a dissident faction of Solidarity which felt alienated from the economically liberal policies of the post-communist Polish establishment. This faction was centered around Jarosław Kaczyński as well as President Lech Wałęsa, and was powerful, albeit briefly, in the early 1990s when the capitalist transition was in its early stages. However, it suddenly lost all influence when Kaczyński&#x27;s party, Centre Agreement, failed to reach the newly-established 5% electoral threshold in the 1993 Polish parliamentary election. This led the political movement that would later form PiS to spend the rest of the 1990s with only marginal political influence. It slowly started to re-establish itself in the late 1990s, as this period marked the strongest and most persistent wave of public dissatisfaction with economic liberalism and corruption.

For the first years after its foundation, Law and Justice was characterized as a moderate, single-issue party narrowly focused on the issue of &#x27;law and order&#x27;, appealing to voters concerned about corruption and high crime rates. In its 2002 assessment of Poland, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate led by the UK government described Law and Justice as &quot;basically a law and order party&quot;. In 2003, German political scientist Nikolaus Werz classified Law and Justice as a centrist, law-and-order party that &quot;advocates a strong state, the fight against corruption and the tightening of criminal law&quot;. Werz contrasted the moderation of PiS with the radicalism of League of Polish Families, which he described as a nationalist and &#x27;Catholic-fundamentalist&#x27; party.

The party then started radicalizing and broadening its program following its victory in the 2005 Polish parliamentary election. In 2006, Chicago Tribune wrote that &quot;President Kaczynski&#x27;s Law and Justice Party ran on a populist reform platform but veered sharply to the right after its victory&quot;. The same year, Polish journalist Krzysztof Bobiński wrote: &quot;When they started out, the Kaczynski brothers were fairly mainstream … but now they&#x27;ve gotten into bed with the League of Polish Families and Samoobrona. They are moving to the right, and it&#x27;s a pretty intolerant right.&quot; The party had undergone a radical ideological change, abandoning its centrist position towards an increasingly populist and nationalist political orientation. This change was also marked by a pivot on the party&#x27;s position towards the European Union - initially strongly supportive of European integration, PiS became an Eurosceptic party that criticized the EU from nationalist, protectionist, and anti-neoliberal perspectives.

According to Polish political scientists Krzysztof Kowalczyk and Jerzy Sielski, Law and Justice had moved from a single-issue party in 2001 to a staunchly and broadly conservative one by 2006. They noted that by 2006 the party started calling for a &quot;conservative revolution&quot; that would restore traditional values to Poland, and gradually adopted right-wing populist rhetoric characterized by a &quot;somewhat leftist&quot; economical policy to undercut the appeal of far-right anti-capitalist League of Polish Families (LPR), agrarian socialist Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (Samoobrona) and the agrarian Polish People&#x27;s Party (PSL). The populist pivot of PiS is credited with causing the electoral blowout of Samoobrona and LPR in the 2007 Polish parliamentary election.

Initially, the party was broadly pro-market, although less so than the Civic Platform. It has adopted the social market economy rhetoric similar to that of western European Christian democratic parties. In the 2005 election, the party shifted to the protectionist left on economics. As prime minister, Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz was more economically liberal than the Kaczyńskis, advocating a position closer to Civic Platform. In 2005, Law and Justice made Civic Platform its main ideological opponent despite their previous closeness - Law and Justice posed a difference between Civic Platform&#x27;s &quot;liberal Poland&quot; and its &quot;social Poland&quot;. The former was marked by economic liberalism, austerity, deregulation and &quot;serving the rich&quot;. In contrast, Law and Justice stressed its &quot;social&quot; character, pledging policies that would help the poor. The party attacked Civic Platform&#x27;s flat tax proposal and advocated a much more active role of the state in the economy. Law and Justice also made &quot;an offer to the left&quot;, stressing its economically left-wing policies. This pivot led the leader of far-left Samoobrona, Andrzej Lepper, to endorse Lech Kaczyński in the 2005 Polish presidential election, arguing that left-wing voters must vote against the neoliberalism of Civic Platform; Lepper also justified his decision on the basis of Kaczyński&#x27;s declarations in support of funding social welfare, fighting unemployment and taking a tougher stance towards the European Union.

On foreign policy, PiS is Atlanticist and less supportive of European integration than Civic Platform. The party is soft eurosceptic and opposes a federal Europe, especially the Euro currency. In its campaigns, it emphasises that the European Union should &quot;benefit Poland and not the other way around&quot;. It is a member of the anti-federalist European Conservatives and Reformists Party, having previously been a part of the Alliance for Europe of the Nations and, before that, the European People&#x27;s Party. Although it has some elements of Christian democracy, it is not a Christian democratic party. The party is commonly placed on the right wing of the political spectrum, although its economic ideology is also classified as left-wing, or left-leaning. It combines conservative, egalitarian and populist elements in its ideology.
==Platform==

===Economy===

The party supports a state-guaranteed minimum social safety net and extensive state intervention in the economy, and argues that a &quot;more socially sensitive and less market-dominated&quot; economic system is necessary. It advocates progressive taxation that would redistribute the wealth from the wealthy to the poor, and it supports a large-scale social housing program. The party promised and implemented tax and welfare benefits to married couples and family. It also adheres to the principles of economic nationalism, postulating state control over key sectors of the economy. It seeks to increase healthcare spending to 6% of the Polish GDP, and nationalize hospital debts. During the 2015 election campaign, it proposed tax rebates related to the number of children in a family, as well as a reduction of the VAT rate (while keeping a variation between individual types of VAT rates). In 2019, the lowest personal income tax threshold was decreased from 18% to 17%.

PiS opposes cutting social welfare spending, and also proposed the introduction of a system of state-guaranteed housing loans. The party also opposes foreign ownership of crucial industries and businesses, and proposed buying back the largest convenience store chain in Poland, Żabka, from its foreign owners. It also supports state provided universal health care. PiS has been also described as statist, protectionist,&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_2015/10/26&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; solidarist, and interventionist. It also holds agrarianist views. Given the redistributive and protectionist agenda of the party as well as its focus on welfare and nationalization, some political scientists classify Law and Justice as economically left-wing. Stephen Park Turner likewise classified it as left-wing. It has also been described as economically left-leaning by the Centre for European Reform, Reuters, and The Routledge Handbook of East European Politics. Political economist Cédric M. Koch wrote that PiS combines &quot;political communitarianism with neo-socialist economic views&quot;.

The economic views and policies of Law and Justice derive from the Polish political party Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (Samoobrona) led by Andrzej Lepper. Law and Justice appropriated the economic rhetoric and views of Samoobrona following its complete collapse in the 2007 Polish parliamentary election. Samoobrona is an economically far-left party, much further left than parties of post-communist origin such as the social-democratic Democratic Left Alliance. After Samoobrona and the far-right anti-capitalist League of Polish Families (LPR) formed a coalition with PiS in 2006 in order to prevent the neoliberal Civic Platform from coming to power, Law and Justice managed to claim the voters of both parties by &quot;taking up economically inclusionary discourse from the originally left-wing Self-Defence and outbidding the LPR on cultural conservatism&quot;. 

Ever since, Law and Justice has been critical of the capitalist transformation in Poland, accusing the 1990s Polish cabinets of &#x27;choosing the wrong path of transformation after the 1989 system change&#x27; and leading to &#x27;beneficiaries under such capitalist conditions [having] become undeservedly privileged&#x27;. Rakib Ehsan argues that PiS pursues a &quot;brand of ‘red and blue’ politics – social-democratic economics combined with socio-cultural conservatism&quot;. Similarly, Polish political scientist Marek M. Kamiński described PiS as &quot;culturally conservative, economically social democratic&quot;. Foreign Affairs remarked that the program of PiS &quot;amounts to a very leftist (or, rather, a Catholic socialist) set of economic policies&quot;, listing policies such as increasing minimum wage, abolishing short-term job contracts, limiting self-employment contracts abused by employers to avoid benefit payments, decreasing retirement age, increasing family benefits, implementing social payments for large families, and enacting a special tax on foreign banks&#x27; assets and foreign big stores.

The party claims to represent the &quot;marginalised vast majority of Poles&quot; who had to bear the costs of capitalist transformation, and states that its main goal is to provide the &quot;common man its fair economic share of societal resources&quot;. Law and Justice is highly critical of neoliberalism, describing it as &quot;anti-family&quot; and arguing that neoliberal policies are responsible for social inequality, as well as maximizing profit at the cost of the &quot;ordinary people&quot; and &quot;Catholic values&quot;. The party proposes increasing social benefit payments, raising the minimum wage, increasing expenditures on child nutrition and benefits to worse-off families. It also postulates more subsidies and state control of the Polish infrastructure, and expansion of the healthcare and education system. The party also opposes privatization, stating: &quot;We cannot deprive the state of influence and responsibility for the social order, in particular for the weakest social groups whose situation as a result of the transformation has been rapidly deteriorating.&quot;

===National political structures===

PiS has presented a project for constitutional reform including, among others: allowing the president the right to pass laws by decree (when prompted to do so by the Cabinet), a reduction of the number of members of the Sejm and Senat, and removal of constitutional bodies overseeing the media and monetary policy. PiS advocates increased criminal penalties. It postulates aggressive anti-corruption measures (including creation of an Anti-Corruption Bureau (CBA), open disclosure of the assets of politicians and important public servants), as well as broad and various measures to smooth the working of public institutions.

PiS is a strong supporter of lustration (&quot;lustracja&quot;), a verification system created ostensibly to combat the influence of the Communist era security apparatus in Polish society. While current lustration laws require the verification of those who serve in public offices, PiS wants to expand the process to include university professors, lawyers, journalists, managers of large companies, and others performing &quot;public functions&quot;. Those found to have collaborated with the security service, according to the party, should be forbidden to practice in their professions.

===Diplomacy and defence===
The party is in favour of strengthening the Polish Army through diminishing bureaucracy and raising military expenditures, especially for modernisation of army equipment. The party supports Polish membership in NATO, arguing that Poland should fulfill its military obligations and aspire to become one of the countries that shape NATO policy. In its 2001 program, the party called for maintaining compulsory military service, but shortening it as much as possible, writing: &quot;PiS will strive to shorten the duration of compulsory military service to the extent possible, so that it is limited to the conscript training process. Universal military service should be imposed on the best conscripts, raising the level of the reserves and creating appropriate social role models. We will support the development of an attractive military training programme for students and a military class programme in secondary schools, together with an appropriate incentive system.&quot; 

Later the party abandoned its support of military draft - it planned to introduce a fully professional army and end conscription by 2012; in August 2008, compulsory military service was abolished in Poland. It is also in favour of participation of Poland in foreign military missions led by the United Nations, NATO and United States, in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq. The party moderated its policies in the wake of its coalition with far-left Samoobrona and far-right LPR in 2006, as both parties demanded withdrawal of Polish troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, and distancing Poland from the European Union.

Ever since its founding in 2001, Law and Justice had a catalogue of complex reforms in the sphere of defence and national security, which it also connected to economic matters. The party postulates a national security law that would expand the legal capabilities of special and public security services. Law and Justice proposed monitoring key industries such as energy, telecommunications, banking as well as stock exchange, including taking note of the ownership situation in these economic sectors and the main companies operating in these fields. The national security act and extensive monitoring of the economy were to provide the basis for the Polish government to safeguard economic security by partial or complete compulsory state buyouts of companies &quot;whose operation on the market creates a direct or potential threat to national security&quot;. In this way, the party connected its anti-privatization views with its law-and-order proposals.
PiS is eurosceptic, although the party supports integration with the European Union on terms beneficial for Poland. It supports economic integration and tightening cooperation in areas of energy security and military operations, but is sceptical about closer political integration. It is against the formation of a European superstate or federation. PiS is in favour of a strong political and military alliance between Poland and the United States.

In the European Parliament, it is a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists, a group founded in 2009 to challenge the prevailing pro-federalist ethos of the European Parliament and address the perceived &quot;democratic deficit&quot; existing at a European level.

They have frequently expressed anti-German, and anti-Russian stances.

Law and Justice has taken a hardline stance against Russia in its foreign policy since the party&#x27;s foundation. The party vocally advocated for military aid to Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, but announced it would halt arms transfers in September 2023 following disagreements over the export of Ukrainian grain to Poland. The party has been described as divided between pro-Ukrainian and anti-Ukrainian factions.

Though the PiS government initially advocated a pro-Israel policy, relations with Israel deteriorated following the 2018 Amendment to the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance and subsequent diplomatic incidents. In opposition, PiS called for the expulsion of the Israeli Ambassador following the World Central Kitchen drone strikes and criticized the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip.

The PiS government supported accession of Turkey to the European Union. PiS also advocates for a strong relationship with Hungary under Viktor Orbán, though they diverged over the Russo-Ukrainian War. Law and Justice criticised the Polish government&#x27;s decision in 2008 to recognise the independence of Kosovo from Serbia.

===Social policies===
The party&#x27;s views on social issues are much more traditionalist than those of social conservative parties in other European countries, and its social views reflect those of the Christian right. PiS has been described to hold right-wing populist views.

====Family====
The party strongly promotes itself as a pro-family party and encourages married couples to have more children. Prior to 2005 elections, it promised to build three million inexpensive housing units as a way to help young couples start a family. Once in government, it passed legislation lengthening parental leaves.

In 2017, the PiS government commenced the so-called &quot;500+&quot; programme under which all parents residing in Poland receive an unconditional monthly payment of 500 PLN for each second and subsequent child (the 500 PLN support for the first child being linked to income). It also revived the idea of a housing programme based on state-supported construction of inexpensive housing units.

Also in 2017, the party&#x27;s MPs passed a law that bans most retail trade on Sundays on the premise that workers will supposedly spend more time with their families.

==== Abortion ====

The party is anti-abortion and supports further restrictions on Poland&#x27;s abortion laws which are already one of the most restrictive in Europe. PiS opposes abortion resulting from foetal defects which is currently allowed until specific foetal age.

In 2016, PiS supported legislation to ban abortion under all circumstances, and investigate miscarriages. After the black Protests the legislation was withdrawn.

In October 2020, the Constitutional Court ruled that one of three circumstances (foetal defects) is unconstitutional. However, many constitutionalists argue that this judgement is invalid.

The party is against euthanasia and comprehensive sex education. It has proposed a ban of in-vitro fertilisation.

====Disability rights====
In April 2018, the PiS government announced a PLN 23 billion (EUR 5.5 billion) programme (named &quot;Accessibility+&quot;) aimed at reducing barriers for disabled people, to be implemented 2018–2025.

Also in April 2018, parents of disabled adults who required long-term care protested in Sejm over what they considered inadequate state support, in particular, the reduction of support once the child turns 18. As a result, the monthly disability benefit for adults was raised by approx. 15 per cent to PLN 1,000 (approx. EUR 240) and certain non-cash benefits were instituted, although protesters&#x27; demands of an additional monthly cash benefit were rejected.

====Gay rights====

The party opposes the LGBT movement and many of its postulates, in particular same-sex marriages and any other form of legal recognition of same-sex couples. In 2020, Poland was ranked the lowest of any European Union country for LGBT rights by ILGA-Europe. The organisation also highlighted instances of anti-LGBT rhetoric and hate speech by politicians of the ruling party. A 2019 survey by Eurobarometer found that more than two-thirds of LGBT people in Poland believe that prejudice against them has risen in the last five years.

On 21 September 2005, PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński said that &quot;homosexuals should not be isolated, however they should not be school teachers for example. Active homosexuals surely not, in any case&quot;, but that homosexuals &quot;should not be discriminated otherwise&quot;. He has also stated, &quot;The affirmation of homosexuality will lead to the downfall of civilization. We can&#x27;t agree to it&quot;. Lech Kaczyński, while mayor of Warsaw, refused authorisation for a gay pride march; declaring that it would be obscene and offensive to other people&#x27;s religious beliefs. He stated, &quot;I am not willing to meet perverts.&quot; In &quot;Bączkowski and Others v. Poland&quot;, the European Court of Human Rights unanimously ruled that the ban of the parade violated Articles 11, 13 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The judgement stated that &quot;The positive obligation of a State to secure genuine and effective respect for freedom of association and assembly was of particular importance to those with unpopular views or belonging to minorities&quot;.

In 2016, Beata Szydło&#x27;s government disbanded the Council for the Prevention of Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Intolerance, an advisory body set up in 2011 by then-Prime Minister Donald Tusk. The council monitored, advised and coordinated government action against racism, discrimination and hate crime.

Many local towns, cities, and Voivodeship sejmiks comprising a third of Poland&#x27;s territory have declared their respective regions as LGBT-free zones with the encouragement of the ruling PiS. Polish President Andrzej Duda, who was the Law and Justice party&#x27;s candidate for presidency in 2015 and 2020, stated that &quot;LGBT is not people, it&#x27;s an ideology which is worse than Communism.&quot; During his successful 2020 election campaign, he pledged he would ban teaching about LGBT issues in schools; he also proposed changing the constitution to ban LGBT couples from adopting children.

====Nationalism====

Academic research has characterised Law and Justice as a partially nationalist party, but PiS&#x27;s leadership rejects this label. Both Kaczyńskis look up for inspirations to the pre-war Sanacja movement with its leader Józef Piłsudski, in contrast to the nationalist Endecja that was led by Piłsudski&#x27;s political archrival, Roman Dmowski. However, parts of the party, especially the faction around Radio Maryja, are inspired by Dmowski&#x27;s movement. Polish far-right organisations and parties such as National Revival of Poland, National Movement and Autonomous Nationalists regularly criticise PiS&#x27;s relative ideological moderation and its politicians for &quot;monopolizing&quot; official political scene by playing on the popular patriotic and religious feelings. However, the party does include several overtly nationalist politicians in senior positions, such as Digital Affairs Minister Adam Andruszkiewicz, the former leader of the All-Polish Youth; and deputy PiS leader and former Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz, the founder of the National-Catholic Movement. It has been also described as national-conservative.

==== Refugees and economic migrants ====
PiS opposed the quota system for mass relocation of immigrants proposed by the European Commission to address the 2015 European migrant crisis. This contrasted with the stance of their main political opponents, the Civic Platform, which have signed up to the commission&#x27;s proposal. Consequently, in the campaign leading to the 2015 Polish parliamentary election, PiS adopted the discourse typical of the populist-right, linking national security with immigration. Following the election, PiS sometimes utilised Islamophobic rhetoric to rally its supporters.

Examples of anti-migration and anti-Islam comments by PiS politicians when discussing the European migrant crisis: in 2015, Jarosław Kaczyński stated that Poland can not accept any refugees because &quot;they could spread infectious diseases.&quot; In 2017, the first Deputy Minister of Justice Patryk Jaki stated that &quot;stopping Islamization is his Westerplatte&quot;. In 2017, Interior minister of Poland Mariusz Błaszczak stated that he would like to be called &quot;Charles the Hammer who stopped the Muslim invasion of Europe in the 8th century&quot;. In 2017, Deputy Speaker of the Sejm Joachim Brudziński stated during the pro-party rally in Siedlce; &quot;if not for us (PiS), they (Muslims) would have built mosques in here (Poland).&quot;

==Structure==
===Internal factions===
Law and Justice is divided into many internal factions, but they can be grouped into three main blocs.

The most influential group within PiS is unofficially named &quot;Order of the Centre Agreement&quot;. It is led by leader is Jarosław Kaczyński, and its main members are Joachim Brudziński, Adam Lipiński and Mariusz Błaszczak.

The second major group is a radical, religious and hard Eurosceptic right-wing faction focused around Antoni Macierewicz, Beata Szydło that has close views to United Poland party of Zbigniew Ziobro. This faction opts for radical reforms and is supported by Jacek Kurski and Tadeusz Rydzyk.

The third major group is a Christian-democratic, republican and moderate social conservative faction focused around Mateusz Morawiecki, Łukasz Szumowski, Jacek Czaputowicz that has close views to The Republicans party of Adam Bielan. Although not officially a party member, Polish president Andrzej Duda can also be placed in this faction.

<text>Ussuriysk () is a city in Primorsky Krai, Russia, in the valley of the Razdolnaya River. The city is north of Vladivostok, the administrative center of the krai, and about from both the China–Russia border and the Pacific Ocean.

It was previously known as &quot;Nikolskoye&quot; (until 1898), &quot;Nikolsk-Ussuriysky&quot; (until 1935) and &quot;Voroshilov&quot; (until 1957).

==History==
===Medieval history===
The area of what now is Ussuriysk was settled by Yulou Mohe tribes. From the mid-9th century, it became Solbin-bu of the Balhae Kingdom. It is then populated by the Dōnghǎi Jurchens, under control of Liao dynasty. The city then become capital of Jīn Dynasty&#x27;s Sùpín circuit (速頻路). Then it went under control of Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties respectively and known as ().

===Modern era===

In 1866, the settlement of Nikolskoye () was founded on the area of today&#x27;s Ussuriysk, named after Saint Nicholas. Due to its advantageous geographic location at the crossing of the transportation lines, the village experienced rapid growth during the 1870s, turning into a trade center. Its role increased after the railroad connecting Khabarovsk and Vladivostok (now a part of the Trans-Siberian Railway) was built, and in 1898 it was granted town status and renamed Nikolsk-Ussuriysky ().

By the beginning of the 20th century the town&#x27;s population totaled 15,000 people, and the annual turnover of its trade enterprises was equal to three million rubles. After the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, Nikolsk-Ussuriysky became one of the most important commercial and economic centers of the Russian Far East. In 1913, the city ranked fourth after Vladivostok, Blagoveshchensk, and Khabarovsk in terms of population. 

Enterprises were established processing agricultural products such as mills, dairies, soap-boiling plants, and tanneries, as well as macaroni and sausage factories and breweries. Brick factories, quarries, and saw-mills were also built.

The central part of the city began to be built up with two- and three-story masonry buildings. In 1914, there were fourteen educational institutions, a theater, a circus, and three movie-theaters in Nikolsk-Ussuriysky.

After the October Revolution of 1917, the city&#x27;s economy experienced rapid growth. The city specialized in processing agricultural products. The name of the city was changed to Voroshilov in 1935 after Kliment Voroshilov. With Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s ascent to power after Stalin&#x27;s death the city&#x27;s name was changed in 1957 to &quot;Ussuriysk&quot; after the Ussuri River, which is more than 140 km away.

Until the 1980s, the city ranked second in the krai in population, having only recently yielded to Nakhodka. Ussuriysk is still second only to Vladivostok as a theatrical and higher-educational center (it is home to the Pedagogical and Agricultural Institutes, and the Higher Military School).

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with thirty-seven rural localities, incorporated as Ussuriysk City Under Krai Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Ussuriysk City Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Ussuriysky Urban Okrug.

==Demographics==
Ethnic composition (2010):
* Russians – 91%
* Koreans – 3%
* Ukrainians – 2.4%
* Tatars – 0.5%
* Others – 3.1%

==Economy==

The city&#x27;s industry is represented by twenty-eight enterprises, including twelve of the food industry, two of light industry, six of metal industry, and four of construction industry. Ussuriysk has always specialized in the production of consumer goods. That is why at present it is in a more favorable situation as compared with other large cities of Primorye where enterprises of war industry prevailed. 

The largest enterprises of light industry are &quot;Primorsky Sakhar&quot; (which provides the Russian Far East with sugar, producing 160,000 tonnes per year), &quot;Dalsoya&quot; (which produces vegetable oil, margarine, and soap), &quot;Ussuriysky Balsam&quot; (24 kinds of liqueur and vodka products, and balsams made of a blend of dozens of herbs). Five articles of &quot;Ussuriysky Balsam&quot; were given diplomas of the first and the second degrees at all-Russian competition of alcohol products.

One more economic feature of Ussuriysk is its wholesale trade. There are approximately thirty specialized and multipurpose trade bases, many of which had developed contacts with foreign partners before the external economic policy was liberalized in Russia.

Among the city&#x27;s other enterprises are the &quot;Grado&quot; firm which annually produces up to 600,000 pairs of footwear, and the Locomotive Repairing Plant. The annual industrial output of Ussuriysk equals 8% of Primorsky Krai&#x27;s production. Besides, the city is the crossing point of all major highways and railroads of the krai.

== Sport ==
=== Ice hockey ===
Ice hockey takes place at the Ledovaya Arena, located on Krasnoznamennaya Ulitsa, 161а. The ice hockey team Primorye Ussuriysk played there from 2009 until they were dissolved in 2011.

=== Speedway ===
Ice speedway and motorcycle speedway takes place at the Sergei Petrovich Shevchenko Stadium (other names, Patriot Stadium or Meliorator Stadium), located at Komsomol&#x27;skaya Ulitsa, 87А, which is adjacent on the south side of the Ledovaya Arena. The Vladivostok Speedway team competed at the stadium during the 1990s in the Russian Team Speedway Championship, when their own stadium was unavailable. 

==Theaters==

The &quot;Ussuriysk Drama Theater&quot; of the Eastern Military District is located at #31 Sovyetskaya Street. The theater was founded in 1937 and is one of the two theaters of the Russian Army (the other is the Central Theater of the Russian Army in Moscow). 

The &quot;Ussuriysk Drama Theater&quot; is located at #33 Volodarskogo Street. It was opened in 1937. The theater is of classical tendencies. Plays are staged both for adults and children. The hall can accommodate 428 people.

==Architecture and monuments==
The central part of the city, including Lenina, Chicherina, Krasnoznamyonnaya, and Ageyeva Streets, is of historic value. The city&#x27;s oldest hotel (#28 Lenina St.) was constructed in 1880. #53 Lenina St., which houses the city&#x27;s oldest movie-theater &quot;Grand-Illyuzion&quot;, was built in 1908.

On the central square there is a monument to the Red Guards and partisans, who died in the battles at Ussuriysk in June 1918. A monument to Vladimir Lenin is on the Railway Station Square.

Steam locomotive YeL 629 is set on plinth as a memorial to three Bolshevik revolutionaries (Lazo, Lutsky, and Sibirtsev) who were allegedly burned alive by the White Guards in its firebox in 1920.
The Intercession Church at #80A Chicherina St. was built in 1914. It is the only religious building in the krai that has been kept without any reconstruction since 1917 and is used for its original purpose.
==Landscape==
Ussuriysk is very green because of many trees (such as poplars, elms, and jasmine, that were transplanted here from the taiga) and ranked third after Arsenyev and Vladivostok.

==Notable people==
*Aleksandr Dvornikov (born 1961), army general
*Nikos Kavvadias (1910-1975), Greek poet
*Renata Kambolina (1998-2015), Famous suicidal girl.

<doc id="520323" wikidata="Q272309" url="?curid=520323" title="Rika Izumi">
<text>is a Japanese model, actress and singer. She formerly used the stage name when she was with Snow Rabbits Productions. After Izumi returned to the modeling world in 2008, she used both 泉里果 and 泉里香 as stage names; both are pronounced &quot;Izumi Rika&quot;.

==Life==
Isumi was born in Kyoto. Her first major acting role was as Ami Mizuno (Sailor Mercury) in the live action &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;.

In Act Zero and the Special Act, she was credited as &quot;Rika&quot; (梨華; note different kanji than her current stage name).

She released a CD &quot;single&quot;, containing two songs, for her character Sailor Mercury: &quot;Mi Amor&quot; (Spanish: &quot;my love&quot;) and &quot;Yakusoku&quot; (約束, meaning &quot;promise&quot;).

Before PGSM, Izumi&#x27;s only television work was on an Idol special on Sky PerfecTV Japan called &quot;Being Junior, Go!&quot; She has also modeled in magazines called &quot;Monthly De-View&quot; (Winter 2002–2003). &quot;Pichi Lemon&quot; (Summer 2003), &quot;For Lillie&quot; (April 2003), &quot;Up-To-Boy&quot; (November 2003), and &quot;Melon&quot; (July 2003 to June 2005, when it stopped publication). She was on the cover of three consecutive issues of &quot;Pure Pure&quot; or &quot;Pure²&quot;, a magazine aimed at the under-fifteen crowd (Issues 17 to 19, her photos were along with those of many other like-aged idols). She had released a single in November 2003 for a song entitled &quot;Koisuru Soldier&quot; (&quot;Kanojo wa Ijiwaru&quot; [&quot;Nasty Girl&quot;] was the other song on that CD; it was released on her agency&#x27;s label and distributed by Windsong). She was also in a magazine called &quot;Bomb!&quot; with Miyuu Sawai and Keiko Kitagawa in character as Sailor Mercury.

After PGSM, Izumi&#x27;s career went on hiatus for two years as she finished high school. No new photos of her surfaced, and when she attended PGSM cast reunions, her ex-castmates were careful not to post her full name in blogs nor post photos of her. When she was accepted at Meiji University as a literature major in 2007 (the same university ex-PGSM castmate Kitagawa attended), she resumed her career.

In June 2008, Rika returned to the modeling world after years of inactivity. She was in the top twelve in a competition for the title of &quot;Pinky Princess&quot; (total number of entrants: 5,427).

She signed with Sun Music Brain agency on June 1, 2008. New photos of her appeared in the August 2008 issue of &quot;Ray&quot; magazine, and she has appeared in subsequent issues. The ban her former castmates had of posting photos of her was lifted; she was photographed with Sawai, Kitagawa, Mew Azama, and Ayaka Komatsu at a party celebrating Komatsu&#x27;s twenty-second birthday, and Komatsu posted the photo on her blog on August 7, 2008. In December 2008, she appeared in a commercial for Nissin Food Products. In May 2010, she moved from Sun Music Brain to Sun Music Productions, another division within the same agency.

She has been mentioned as being in the casts of three movies: &quot;The Go Master&quot; (2006), &quot;Clearness&quot; (2008), and &quot;Go Seigen&quot; (&quot;Five Restrictions&quot;) (2008). The Sun Music Brain bio lists a November 2007 movie with Izumi in the cast. It was called &quot;Oh Kiyohara&quot;.

Rika has also done runway modeling since her 2008 return. In 2011, she had a cameo in the movie &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot; in which she was reunited with her ex-PGSM castmate Kitagawa.

In 2013 she played the role of Akira Kazuraba (Kota&#x27;s sister) in &quot;Kamen Rider Gaim&quot;.

She is currently signed with Stardust Promotion, her official profile page on Stardust states she is part of the cast of the 2016 movie &quot;Scoop!&quot;.

<text>Broomhill and Sharrow Vale — which includes the districts of Broomhill, Broomhall, Crookesmoor, Endcliffe, Sharrow Vale and Tapton Hill — is one of the 28 electoral wards in City of Sheffield, England. The ward was created following the 2015 local government boundary review out of parts of the old Broomhill, Central and Nether Edge wards. It is located in the western part of the city. The population of the Broomhill ward in 2011 was 16,966 people in 5,708 households, covering an area of 2.7 km2. Broomhill &amp; Sharrow Vale is one of the wards that make up the Sheffield Central Parliamentary Constituency.

==History==
According to E. Wilkinson: &quot;Most of what is now Broomhill was used as the Crookesmoor Racecourse from 1711 to 1781, the races only being discontinued when the commons of Ecclesall Bierlow were enclosed between 1778 and 1789. Part of Broomhill lay in Nether Hallam, the common land of which was enclosed in 1791. (The parts lying in Nether Hallam are from the north side of Whitham Road to the east side of Crookes Road, and from the bottom of Endcliffe Crescent, Endcliffe Vale Road, Endcliffe Avenue, Oakholme Road, Westbourne Road from below the old Radio Sheffield building and No. 27, Southbourne Road and the north side of Clarkehouse Road from the bottom of Southbourne Road to Brocco Bank.)

There were a few houses within this area, some of them encroachments on the common land, and a huddle of cottages to the east of the present Botanical Gardens, including an inn &quot;The Ball in the Tree&quot;, demolished in 1870. The suburb takes its name from the house built by William Newbould on land to the east of Newbould Lane in 1792, to which he gave the name of &quot;Broomhill&quot;, for the simple reason that it was the first house above Broomhall, and was on a hill.
A few more large houses with considerable grounds were built during the next 30 years, but the real beginning of Broomhill was when the turnpike road to Glossop was opened in 1821. Terraces as well as bigger houses followed the road and the first back-to-back houses were built in Peel Street in 1827. Houses also crept down from Crookes as far as Hoole Road, this area being known as Mount Pisgah, a pun on the biblical reference of Moses viewing the holy land from there, since all the land that could be seen to the east was owned by the Holy family. By the early 1830s Broomhill had five public houses, the Ball, Broomhill Tavern, Fox &amp; Duck, Southseas and the Travellers Inn plus a few shops. Whilst growth was steady, the 1840s were years of depression and growth only really resumed in the 1850s when the land above and along Fulwood Road was developed. Most of the former household names in the steel and cutlery industry lived or passed through Broomhill, as did many of the founders of the stores in town, brewers, solicitors and medical practitioners. There was always a fairly substantial population of artisans and small shopkeepers, to service the bigger houses. The shopping centre was the best suburban one and probably reached its peak during the second world war when several stores and shops that had been bombed out in the city came to Broomhill, the foremost being John Walsh Ltd., which moved into the Mount.

The district inspired the former poet laureate Sir John Betjeman to write a poem entitled &#x27;An Edwardian Sunday, Broomhill, Sheffield&#x27; which draws on the large stone houses, steel industry and hilly landscapes of the city.

Most of the Halls of Residence of the University of Sheffield are in the area, and it is also home to many other students in privately owned accommodation. One property that is now a student residence, &quot;Fairholme&quot;, 18 Oakholme Road, was a large private house converted during World War II for human experimentation on conscientious objectors by the Sorby Research Institute.
&#x27;Oakbourne&#x27; at 26 Oakholme Road was used from 1940-41 as the HQ for Sheffield and Rotherham Army Command. Considerable bomb damage occurred in the street behind - Westbourne Road - during the December 1940 Sheffield Blitz.
The name &#x27;Broomhill&#x27; is often taken to refer to the parade of shops on Fulwood Road which includes Sheffield&#x27;s oldest independent cafe Vittles, a collection of takeaways, four pubs, a Morrisons supermarket and many other local shops and banks.

A concise and detailed history of Broomhill can be found on the Independent Broomhill website History of Broomhill, Sheffield S10 created by Jonathan Bagge.

==Districts of Broomhill and Sharrow Vale ward==
===Broomhill===

Broomhill () is a western suburb of Sheffield. Largely developed in the nineteenth century, its prominent buildings include Broomhill Church, The Mount and King Edward VII School, the latter two listed buildings both designed by William Flockton. The area lies west of the main campus of the University of Sheffield and has a large student population, including popular areas such as Parkers Road, and was identified in 2003 as the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth.

The centre of Broomhill is a conservation area, while numerous hospitals and the Sheffield Botanical Gardens lie on its borders. In January 1981, the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, was arrested on the district&#x27;s Melbourne Avenue, which runs through the middle of Sheffield High School. The 2011 Census recorded the area&#x27;s population as 1,943.

===Broomhall===
Broomhall () is a district of Sheffield to the west of the city centre. It occupies the land that once belonged to Broom Hall, a historic mansion still in existence today, which dates from at least the 15th century when it was the principal residence of the Swift family, who had inherited from the Wickersleys. In 1791, the hall was owned by the reverend James Wilkinson, vicar of Sheffield, when it was attacked and set on fire by a mob rioting against the Enclosure of land act.

In 1973, David Mellor began manufacturing his own cutlery designs here. To house his factory he renovated a large historic mansion, Broom Hall. The building was then derelict. The machines were moved into the extensive Georgian wing. The conversion of the building received a European Architectural Heritage Award. As well as introducing new concepts in cutlery he rethought the traditional methods of production. Workers in the Sheffield cutlery industry had up to then specialised in a single operation, but he introduced a new system whereby his cutlery makers rotate from task to task, increasing job satisfaction through a sense of involvement in the project as a whole.

The Broomhall Park Association was formed in 1967 by residents living in Broomhall who wanted to ensure that - at a time when the area was threatened with unrestricted developments - the special character of Broomhall was maintained and enhanced for the future. Broomhall is close to the University of Sheffield and is a diverse area, mixing larger houses and student accommodation. Parts of it once had a reputation for being a red-light district some years ago and it is now home to a large Somali community. It has local transport connections to Meadowhall, Hillsborough, Stannington and Chapeltown.

===Crookesmoor===
Crookesmoor () lies immediately north of the University of Sheffield&#x27;s main campus housing the University&#x27;s Crookesmoor library, S10 Gym and sports centre, east of Crookes and south of Walkley. A residential area, it consists largely of terraced houses, has a significant student population and is home to Crookes Valley Park which also includes the Dam House. This park contains a lake, the last in what was a chain of reservoirs.

A racecourse lay in Crookesmoor from at least 1711 until 1781, when the land was enclosed. The racecourse had a sizeable grandstand, lying near Fulwood Road.

===Endcliffe===
Endcliffe () lies south west of Broomhill and north of Hunter&#x27;s Bar and is a wealthy residential area. It includes Birkdale School (a private school) and part of the &quot;Endcliffe Student Village&quot;, containing brand new flats, as well as old halls of residence, all owned by the University of Sheffield. The suburb contains the 36 room mansion Endcliffe Hall built for the steel magnate John Brown in the 1860s.

===Sharrow Vale===
Sharrow Vale () is a district in the southwestern portion of Sheffield. It straddles the Porter Brook and Ecclesall Road (A625). Hunter&#x27;s Bar, at the junction of Ecclesall Road, Brocco Bank, Sharrow Vale Road and Junction Road, was formerly a toll bar on the 18th century Sheffield to Hathersage Turnpike — the toll house is long gone but the toll gate can still be seen. To the north of this neighbourhood is the Sheffield Botanical Gardens, and the historic Sheffield General Cemetery lies to the east. To the west is Endcliffe Park, the first in a series of parks that follow the Porter Brook out of Sheffield.

===Tapton Hill===
Tapton Hill is a district of the suburb of Crosspool. The Tapton Hill transmitting station and Tapton Hall are located here.

<doc id="520345" wikidata="Q218990" url="?curid=520345" title="Shuttle Carrier Aircraft">
<text>The Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) are two extensively modified Boeing 747 airliners that NASA used to transport Space Shuttle orbiters. One (N905NA) is a 747-100 model, while the other (N911NA) is a short-range 747-100SR. Both are now retired.

The SCAs were used to ferry Space Shuttles from landing sites back to the Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center. The orbiters were placed on top of the SCAs by Mate-Demate Devices, large gantry-like structures that hoisted the orbiters off the ground for post-flight servicing then mated them with the SCAs for ferry flights.

In approach and landing test flights conducted in 1977, the test shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; was released from an SCA during flight and glided to a landing under its own control.

== Design and development ==
The Lockheed C-5 Galaxy was considered for the shuttle-carrier role by NASA but rejected in favor of the 747. This was due to the 747&#x27;s low-wing design in comparison to the C-5&#x27;s high-wing design, and also because the U.S. Air Force would have retained ownership of the C-5, while NASA could own the 747s outright.

The first aircraft, a Boeing 747-123 registered N905NA, was originally manufactured for American Airlines. With a decline in air traffic and failure to fill their 747s, American Airlines sold it to NASA. It still wore the visible American cheatlines while testing &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the 1970s. It was acquired in 1974 and initially used for trailing wake vortex research as part of a broader study by NASA Dryden, as well as Shuttle tests involving an F-104 flying in close formation and simulating a release from the 747.

The aircraft was extensively modified for NASA by Boeing in 1976. While first-class seats were kept for NASA passengers, its main cabin and insulation were stripped, and the fuselage was strengthened. Mounting struts were added on top of the 747, located to match the fittings on the Shuttle that attach it to the external fuel tank for launch. With the Shuttle riding on top, the center of gravity was altered. Vertical stabilizers were added to the tail to improve stability when the Orbiter was being carried. The avionics and engines were also upgraded.

An internal escape slide was added behind the flight deck in case of catastrophic failure mid-flight. In the event of a bail-out, explosives would be detonated to make an opening in the fuselage at the bottom of the slide, allowing the crew to exit through the slide and parachute to the ground. The slide system was removed following the Approach and Landing Tests because of concerns over the possibility of escaping crew members being ingested into an engine.

Flying with the additional drag and weight of the Orbiter imposed significant fuel and altitude penalties. The range was reduced to , compared to an unladen range of , requiring an SCA to stop several times to refuel on a transcontinental flight. Without the Orbiter, the SCA needed to carry ballast to balance its center of gravity. The SCA had an altitude ceiling of and a maximum cruise speed of Mach 0.6 with the orbiter attached. A crew of 170 took a week to prepare the shuttle and SCA for flight.
Studies were conducted to equip the SCA with aerial refueling equipment, a modification already made to the U.S. Air Force E-4 (modified 747-200s) and 747 tanker transports for the IIAF. However, during formation flying with a tanker aircraft to test refueling approaches, minor cracks were spotted on the tailfin of N905NA. While these were not likely to have been caused by the test flights, it was felt that there was no sense taking unnecessary risks. Since there was no urgent need to provide an aerial refueling capacity, the tests were suspended.By 1983, SCA N905NA no longer carried the distinct American Airlines tricolor cheatline. NASA replaced it with its own livery, consisting of a white fuselage and a single blue cheatline. That year, after secretly being fitted with an infrared countermeasures system to protect it from heat-seeking missiles, it was also used to fly &quot;Enterprise&quot; on a tour in Europe, with refueling stops in Goose Bay, Canada; Keflavik, Iceland; England; and West Germany. It then went to the Paris Air Show.

In 1988, in the wake of the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident, NASA procured a surplus 747SR-46 from Japan Airlines. Registered N911NA, it entered service with NASA in 1990 after undergoing modifications similar to N905NA. It was first used in 1991 to ferry the new shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; from the manufacturers in Palmdale, California to Kennedy Space Center.

Based at the Dryden Flight Research Center within Edwards Air Force Base in California the two aircraft were functionally identical, although N911NA has five upper-deck windows on each side, while N905NA has only two.

The rear mounting points on both aircraft were labeled with humorous instructions to &quot;attach orbiter here&quot; or &quot;place orbiter here&quot;, clarified by the precautionary note &quot;black side down&quot;.

Shuttle Carriers were capable of operating from alternative shuttle landing sites such as those in the United Kingdom, Spain, and France. Because Shuttle Carrier&#x27;s range is reduced while mated to an orbiter, additional preparations such as removal of the payload from the orbiter may have been necessary to reduce its weight.

Boeing transported its Phantom Ray unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) demonstrator from St. Louis, Missouri, to Edwards on a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft on December 11, 2010.

== Approach and Landing Tests ==


The Approach and Landing Tests were a series of taxi and flight trials of the prototype Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot;, conducted at Edwards Air Force Base in 1977. They verified the shuttle&#x27;s flight characteristics when mated to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and when flying on its own, prior to the Shuttle system becoming operational. There were three taxi tests, eight captive flight tests and five free flight tests where the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was released from the SCA during flight and glided to a landing under its own control.

== Ferry flights ==


During the decades of Shuttle operations, the SCAs were most often used to transport the orbiters from Edwards Air Force Base, the shuttle&#x27;s secondary landing site, to the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) at the Kennedy Space Center where the orbiter was processed for another launch. The SCAs were also used to transport the orbiters between manufacturer Rockwell International and NASA during initial delivery and mid-life refits.

At the end of the Space Shuttle program the SCA was used to deliver the retired orbiters from the Kennedy Space Center to their museums.

&quot;Discovery&quot; was flown to the Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum at the Dulles International Airport on April 17, 2012, making low-level passes over Washington, D.C. landmarks before landing. &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which had been on display at the Smithsonian was transported to the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum in New York City on April 27, 2012, making low-level passes over the city&#x27;s landmarks, before landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport, where it was transferred by barge to the museum.

The last ferry flight took &quot;Endeavour&quot; from Kennedy Space Center to Los Angeles between September 19 and 21, 2012 with refueling stops at Ellington Field and Edwards Air Force Base. After leaving Edwards the SCA with &quot;Endeavour&quot; performed low level flyovers above various landmarks across California, from Sacramento to the San Francisco Bay Area, before finally being delivered to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). From there the orbiter was transported through the streets of Los Angeles and Inglewood to its final destination, the California Science Center in Exposition Park.

== Retirement ==
Shuttle Carrier N911NA was retired on February 8, 2012, after its final mission to the Dryden Flight Research Facility at Edwards Air Force Base in Palmdale, California, and was used as a source of parts for NASA&#x27;s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) aircraft, another modified Boeing 747. N911NA is now preserved and on display at the Joe Davies Heritage Airpark in Palmdale, California as part of a long-term loan to the city from NASA.

Shuttle Carrier N905NA was used to ferry the retired Space Shuttles to their respective museums. After delivering &quot;Endeavour&quot; to the Los Angeles International Airport in September 2012, the aircraft was flown to the Dryden Flight Research Facility, where NASA intended it to join N911NA as a source of spare parts for NASA&#x27;s SOFIA aircraft, but when NASA engineers surveyed N905NA they determined that it had few parts usable for SOFIA. In 2013, a decision was made to preserve N905NA and display it at Space Center Houston with the mockup Space Shuttle &quot;Independence&quot; mounted on its back. N905NA was flown to Ellington Field where it was carefully dismantled, ferried to the Johnson Space Center in seven major pieces (a process called The Big Move), reassembled, and finally mated with the replica shuttle in August 2014. The display, called Independence Plaza, opened to the public for the first time on January 23, 2016.

<doc id="520346" wikidata="Q229932" url="?curid=520346" title="4-bit computing">
<text>4-bit computing is the use of computer architectures in which integers and other data units are 4 bits wide. 4-bit central processing unit (CPU) and arithmetic logic unit (ALU) architectures are those that are based on registers or data buses of that size. A group of four bits is also called a nibble and has 24 = 16 possible values, with a range of 0 to 15.

4-bit processors were widely used in electronic calculators and other roles where decimal math was used, like electronic cash registers, microwave oven timers, and so forth. This is because a 4-bit value holds a single binary coded decimal (BCD) digit, making it a natural size for directly processing decimal values. As a 4-bit value is generally too small to hold a memory address for real-world programs or data, the address bus of these systems was generally larger. For instance, the canonical 4-bit microprocessor, the Intel 4004, had a 12-bit address format.

4-bit designs were used only for a short period when integrated circuits were still expensive, and were found primarily in cost-sensitive roles. While 4-bit computing is mostly obsolete, 4-bit values are still used in the same decimal-centric roles they were developed for, and modern implementations are generally much wider and process multiple 4-bit values in parallel. An example of such a system is the HP Saturn design of the 1980s. By the 1990s, most such uses had been replaced by general purpose binary designs.

== History ==

A 4-bit processor may seem limited, but it is a good match for calculators, where each decimal digit fits into four bits.

Some of the first microprocessors had a 4-bit word length and were developed around 1970. The first commercial microprocessor was the binary-coded decimal (BCD-based) Intel 4004, developed for calculator applications in 1971; it had a 4-bit word length, but had 8-bit instructions and 12-bit addresses. It was succeeded by the Intel 4040, which added interrupt support and a variety of other new features.

The first commercial single-chip computer was the 4-bit Texas Instruments TMS 1000 (1974). It contained a 4-bit CPU with a Harvard architecture and 8-bit-wide instructions, an on-chip instruction ROM, and an on-chip data RAM with 4-bit words.

The Rockwell PPS-4 was another early 4-bit processor, introduced in 1972, which had a long lifetime in handheld games and similar roles. It was steadily improved and by 1975 been combined with several support chips to make a one-chip computer.

The 4-bit processors were programmed in assembly language or Forth, e.g. &quot;MARC4 Family of 4 bit Forth CPU&quot; (which is now discontinued) because of the extreme size constraint on programs and because common programming languages (for microcontrollers, 8-bit and larger), such as the C programming language, do not support 4-bit data types (C, and C++, and more languages require that the size of the codice_1 data type be at least 8 bits, and that all data types other than bitfields have a size that is a multiple of the character size).

The 1970s saw the emergence of 4-bit software applications for mass markets like pocket calculators. During the 1980s, 4-bit microprocessors were used in handheld electronic games to keep costs low.

In the 1970s and 1980s, a number of research and commercial computers used bit slicing, in which the CPU&#x27;s arithmetic logic unit (ALU) was built from multiple 4-bit-wide sections, each section including a chip such as an Am2901 or 74181.

The Zilog Z80, although it is an 8-bit microprocessor, has a 4-bit ALU.

Although the Data General Nova is a series of 16-bit minicomputers, the original Nova and the Nova 1200 internally processed numbers 4 bits at a time with a 4-bit ALU, sometimes called &quot;nybble-serial&quot;.

The HP Saturn processors, used in many Hewlett-Packard calculators between 1984 and 2003 (including the HP 48 series of scientific calculators) are &quot;4-bit&quot; (or hybrid 64-/4-bit) machines; as the Intel 4004 did, they string multiple 4-bit words together, e.g. to form a 20-bit memory address, and most of the registers are 64 bits wide, storing 16 4-bit digits.

In addition, some early calculators such as the 1967 Casio AL-1000, the 1972 Sinclair Executive, and the aforementioned 1984 HP Saturn had 4-bit datapaths that accessed their registers 4 bits (one BCD digit) at a time.

== Uses ==

One bicycle computer specifies that it uses a &quot;4 bit, 1-chip microcomputer&quot;. Other typical uses include coffee makers, infrared remote controls, and security alarms.

The processor in Barbie typewriters that can encrypt is a 4-bit microcontroller.

Several manufacturers used 4-bit microcontrollers in their early electronic games:
* Mattel&#x27;s Funtronics Jacks, Red Light Green Light, Tag, Plus One and Dalla$.
* Milton Bradley Lightfight and Electronic Battleship 1982. 
* Coleco Head to Head Basketball.
* National Semiconductor Quiz Kid Racer.
* Entex Space Invader.
* Texas Instruments My Little Computer.
Western Digital used a 4-bit microcontroller as the basis for their WD2412 time-of-day clock.

The Grundy Newbrain computer uses a 4-bit microcontroller to manage its keyboard, tape I/O, and its built-in 16 character VF alphanumeric display.

== Details ==
With 4 bits, it is possible to create 16 different values. All single-digit hexadecimal numbers can be written with four bits.

Binary-coded decimal is a digital encoding method for numbers using decimal notation, with each decimal digit represented by four bits.

<doc id="520349" wikidata="Q5420972" url="?curid=520349" title="Expedition to the Barrier Peaks">
<text>Expedition to the Barrier Peaks is a 1980 adventure module for the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game written by Gary Gygax. While &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) is typically a fantasy game, the adventure includes elements of science fiction, and thus belongs to the science fantasy genre. It takes place on a downed spaceship; the ship&#x27;s crew has died of an unspecified disease, but functioning robots and strange creatures still inhabit the ship. The player characters fight monsters and robots, and gather the futuristic weapons and colored access cards that are necessary for advancing the story.

&quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; was first played at the Origins II convention in 1976, where it was used to introduce &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; players to the science fiction game &quot;Metamorphosis Alpha&quot;. In 1980, TSR published the adventure, updated for first edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules. The adventure was not updated for later rules systems, but a Wizards.com article did provide a conversion to &quot;Future Tech&quot;. It included a separate booklet of illustrations, in both color and black and white. The adventure is an old-time favorite of many &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fans, including Stephen Colbert. It was ranked the fifth-best &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventure of all time by &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine in 2004, and received positive reviews from &quot;White Dwarf&quot; and &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; magazines. The other adventures in the &quot;S&quot; series include S1 &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot;, S2 &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot;, and S4 &quot;The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; takes place on a spaceship in the Barrier Peaks mountain range of the &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; campaign setting. In the adventure&#x27;s introduction, it is explained that the Grand Duchy of Geoff is under constant attack by a succession of monsters that have been emerging from a cave in the mountains. The Grand Duke of Geoff has hired the characters to discover the origin of the creatures, and stop their incursions.

The cave is actually an entrance to a downed spacecraft whose inhabitants have succumbed to a virus, leaving them dead. Many of the ship&#x27;s robots are still functioning, however, and the players must either avoid or defeat them; some may also be ignored. As later seen in video games, &quot;plot coupons&quot; need to be collected. The adventure requires the players to gather colored access cards (the &quot;coupons&quot;) to advance to the next story arc: entering restricted areas, commanding robots, and other actions are all dependent on the cards. &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; comes with a booklet of 63 numbered illustrations, depicting the various monsters, high tech devices, and situations encountered in the adventure. Much of the artwork for the adventure, including the cover, was produced by Erol Otus. Several of his contributions were printed in full color. Jeff Dee, Greg K. Fleming, David S. LaForce, Jim Roslof and David C. Sutherland III provided additional illustrations for the adventure.

&quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&#x27;s&quot; 32-page adventure guide is divided into six sections. These describe the crew&#x27;s quarters, the lounge area, the gardens and menagerie, and the activity deck. Along the way, the characters find colored access cards and futuristic devices such as blaster rifles and suits of powered armor that they can use to aid their journey. The first two sections involve various monsters, vegepygmys—short humanoid plant creatures—who have commandeered the crew&#x27;s quarters, and a repair robot that follows instructions before its batteries run out. There is also a medical robot trying in vain to find a cure for the virus that killed the ship&#x27;s crew. In the lounge area, a &quot;Dining Servo Robot&quot; still works, although the &quot;food&quot; it serves is now moldy poison.

The gardens and menagerie area includes an encounter with a &quot;cute little bunnyoid on the stump&quot;. It looks like a horned rabbit on a tree stump, but when approached, the stump develops fangs and its roots become tentacles, which it then uses to attack the characters. The next encounter involves a froghemoth, a large alien frog-like creature with tentacles and three eyes on an eyestalk. In the sixth and final section, the activity deck, the players&#x27; characters must contend with various sports robots, including a &quot;boxing and wrestling trainer&quot; and a &quot;karate master&quot;. If the characters can communicate with the karate master and tell it that boxing is superior to karate, it will attack the boxing robot until both are destroyed, else they will both attack the characters. The last area of the activity deck is the loading area, where the characters can leave the spaceship. The adventure then ends, with no postscript.

==Publication history==

While &quot;D&amp;D&quot; is a fantasy roleplaying game, &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; introduces science fiction elements into the game. Work on the adventure began in 1976, when TSR was considering publishing a science fantasy role playing game. James M. Ward had shown them his rough notes on &quot;Metamorphosis Alpha&quot;. Gary Gygax thought it would be a good idea to introduce science fiction/science fantasy concepts to D&amp;D players through the use of a tournament scenario at the 1976 Origins II gaming convention in Baltimore, Maryland. Gygax started with his old Greyhawk Castle campaign material and added a spaceship, which Rob Kuntz helped him populate with monsters. Kuntz is further credited for &quot;inspiration&quot; for the module; his &quot;Machine Level&quot; having been incorporated into Greyhawk Castle and Tim Kask having played in a D&amp;D game with science fantasy content run by Kuntz at GenCon VII in 1974.

According to Gygax, both the scenario that became &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; and &quot;Metamorphosis Alpha&quot; were successful at the convention. Although &quot;Metamorphosis Alpha&quot; became available to the general public in mid-1976, only a few copies of the &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; tournament adventure survived after the convention.

When &quot;Metamorphosis Alpha&quot; was updated and expanded into &quot;Gamma World&quot;, it seemed the right time for Gygax to reintroduce &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; to the public. Said Gygax, &quot;What could be more logical than to make available a scenario which blends the two role playing approaches into a single form?&quot; Gygax updated the scenario to &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (AD&amp;D) rules, hoping it could serve as a primer on how to integrate science into one&#x27;s fantasy role playing game. In 1980, the updated version was published as &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot;. At the time of &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot;&#x27;s release, each &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. The 32-page adventure bears the code &quot;S3&quot; (&quot;S&quot; for &quot;special&quot;). The module included a 36-page book and a 32-page book, with two outer folders; it was one of the earliest published deluxe adventure modules, and came with a book featuring illustrations intended to be revealed to the players as the game progressed, including four color paintings. This module was included as part of the &quot;Realms of Horror&quot; abridged compilation produced in 1987. Although an article on the Wizards.com web site did provide a conversion to &quot;Future Tech&quot;, the adventure never received an official sequel and was not updated for the D&amp;D version 3.5 rules (Wizards of the Coast periodically alters the rules of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and releases a new version). The adventure has also been referenced in the Nodwick comic series. Unlike the other S series adventures, &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; was not included in the &quot;Dungeon Survival Guide&quot; by author Bill Slavicsek because to him it was a &quot;wonderful adventure&quot;, but not &quot;a D&amp;D adventure. Once you add ray guns and power armor to the game, you have a fundamentally different experience.&quot; Other products that have introduced futuristic elements into D&amp;D include the adventure &quot;City of the Gods&quot; (1987) and the campaign boxed set &quot;Tale of the Comet&quot; (1997).

All four modules of the S-series were included as part of the &quot;Dungeons of Dread&quot; hardcover collection, released on March 19, 2013. Lawrence Schick wrote in the foreword: &quot;Vegepygmies and robots. What more could you need to hear? Let’s go! &quot;S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; was Gary in full-on funhouse mode, having a high old time mixing elements of Jim Ward&#x27;s Gamma World with fantasy to create a rollicking and memorable AD&amp;D adventure.&quot;

As part of Extra Life 2018, Wizards of the Coast released &quot;Lost Laboratory of Kwalish&quot;, a new adventure set in the Barrier Peaks, which has story connections to the original &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; adventure and was inspired by its mix of fantasy and technology.

In December 2019, Goodman Games published &quot;Original Adventures Reincarnated #3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; under license from Wizards of the Coast. This hardback contains reprints of the 1980 and 1981 editions, and a 5th edition update of the adventure.

A remastered version of the adventure will be published in the anthology &quot;Quests from the Infinite Staircase&quot; for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition on July 16, 2024.

==Reception==
In the August 1980 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 30), Tim Byrd gave a favorable review, stating that it &quot;successfully combines fantasy with SF&quot; and that it was &quot;extremely fun to play [...] one of the best modules TSR has published&quot;. Six issues later, in the February 1981 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue 36), Kirby Griffis noted that the adventure was full of &quot;surprises and new monsters&quot;, and felt that its one drawback was that Gygax presented standard &quot;D&amp;D&quot; monsters as natives of other planets. In summary, he found it interesting and &quot;full of spice and flavor&quot;, and recommended it to anyone interested in &quot;something new&quot; or wanting to include science fiction in their &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game.

In the August 1981 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (Issue #26), Marcus L. Rowland said in that he found the adventure &quot;very enjoyable, with ideas and creatures eminently suitable for wider use&quot;. He gave it 9/10 overall, but complained that some of the maps were printed on both sides of the same sheet, making them useless as a Dungeon Master&#x27;s shield (a visual barrier that allows dice rolls and other activities to be conducted without the players knowing the outcome.)He recommended at least a week&#x27;s study by the Dungeon Master before attempting to play it. He also noted that the cover &quot;reveals the secret of the creatures&quot;.

In 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the publication of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine published a list of &quot;The 30 Greatest &quot;D&amp;D&quot; Adventures of All Time&quot; and ranked &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; as 5th. Judge Bill Slavicsek felt the adventure was a &quot;classic clash of genres&quot;. It was not something he felt should be done often, but it made a &quot;memorable diversion&quot;. Judge Mike Mearls described how he felt the first time he read &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot;. &quot;I had this terrible, terrible conflict within myself to immediately tell my friends about it at war with a maniacal, desperate drive to keep it hidden at all costs.&quot; Judge Keith Baker was most impressed with the adventure&#x27;s art. He liked that it came with a separate book of art; in particular the before and after illustrations of the carnivorous plant with a &quot;built-in bunny lure&quot;. This was later featured in a Wizards.com &quot;Ask Wizards&quot; segment. According to the &quot;Dungeon&quot; editors, the adventure&#x27;s defining moment was its froghemoth creature, and its full-page color illustration.

According to Creighton Broadhurst, author of &quot;Exemplars of Evil: Deadly Foes to Vex Your Heroes&quot;, the adventure is one of the most popular &quot;old time&quot; Greyhawk adventures. Game designer Daniel Kaufman remembers &quot;the famous backward-firing guns&quot; as one of the adventure&#x27;s highlights. Television personality Stephen Colbert, who played &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; as a child, chose this adventure as his personal favorite.

Aaron Starr for &quot;Black Gate&quot; said &quot;The best &#x27;official&#x27; genre bending I ever saw was an adventure module for AD&amp;D [...] called &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot;. In this module the players would pit their magic and fantasy know-how against the contents of a huge derelict spaceship. This caused a few problems, in practice, since A.) everyone usually knew they were playing this module, and B.) suppressing their knowledge of technology is pretty hard to do. Pretending dangerous ignorance for your characters is tough sledding, as it turned out, and exhausting to boot. &quot;Expedition&quot;, for all its promise, is one module I remember getting consistently poor results with.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath commented on the effect this adventure had on fantasy role-playing, saying, &quot;Taken in sum, the invasion of science fiction in &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; seems like an invitation. If Gygax, who was so often interested in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;″s uniformity, can flip the script with robots and lasers, and generally embrace this silly romp for what it is, imagine what typical players can do with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Anything they want.&quot;

<doc id="520367" wikidata="Q3487910" url="?curid=520367" title="Swiss Bank Corporation">
<text>Swiss Bank Corporation (French: &quot;Société de banque suisse&quot;; German: &quot;Schweizerischer Bankverein&quot;) was a Swiss investment bank and financial services company located in Switzerland. Prior to its merger, the bank was the third largest in Switzerland, with over CHF 300 billion of assets and CHF 11.7 billion of equity.

Throughout the 1990s, SBC engaged in a large growth initiative, shifting its focus from traditional commercial banking into investment banking, in an effort to match its larger Swiss rival Credit Suisse. As part of this strategy, SBC acquired US-based investment bank Dillon Read &amp; Co. as well as London-based merchant bank S.G. Warburg in the mid-1990s. SBC also acquired Chicago-based Brinson Partners and O&#x27;Connor &amp; Associates. These acquisitions formed the basis for a global investment banking business.

In 1998, SBC merged with Union Bank of Switzerland to form UBS, the largest bank in Europe and the second largest bank in the world. The company&#x27;s logo, which featured three keys, symbolizing &quot;confidence, security, and discretion&quot;, was adopted by UBS after the 1998 merger. Although the combination of the two banks was billed as a merger of equals, it quickly became evident that from a management perspective, it was SBC that was buying UBS. Nearly 80% of the top management positions were filled by legacy Swiss Bank professionals. Today, what was SBC forms the core of many of UBS&#x27;s businesses, particularly UBS Investment Bank.

==History==
Swiss Bank Corporation traces its history to 1854. In that year, six private banking firms in Basel, Switzerland, pooled their resources to form the &quot;Bankverein&quot;, a consortium that acted as an underwriting syndicate for its member banks. Among the original member banks were Bischoff zu St Alban, Ehinger &amp; Cie., J. Merian-Forcart, Passavant &amp; Cie., J. Riggenbach and von Speyr &amp; Cie. The establishment of joint-stock banks in Switzerland such as Swiss Bank&#x27;s earliest predecessors (often structured as a Swiss Verein) was driven by the industrialization of the country and the construction of railroads in the mid-19th century.

The Basler Bankverein was formally organized in 1872 in Basel, replacing the original Bankverein consortium. Basler Bankverein was founded with an initial commitment of CHF 30 million, of which CHF 6 million of initial share capital was paid in. Among the Bankverein&#x27;s early backers was the Bank in Winterthur, one of the early predecessors of the Union Bank of Switzerland. The bank experienced initial growing pains after heavy losses in Germany caused the bank to suspend its dividend in favor of a loss reserve. By 1879, Basler Bankverein has accumulated enough capital to resume dividends, initially at an 8% annual rate and then increasing to 10% in 1880.

Basler Bankverein later combined with Zürcher Bankverein in 1895 to become the Basler &amp; Zürcher Bankverein. The next year, Basler Depositenbank and Schweizerische Unionbank were acquired. After the take-over of the Basler Depositenbank, the bank changes its name to Schweizerischer Bankverein (Swiss Bank). The English name of the bank was changed to Swiss Bank Corporation in 1917.

===1900–1939===

SBC continued to grow in the early decades of the 20th century, acquiring weaker rivals. In 1906, SBC purchased Banque d&#x27;Espine, Fatio &amp; Cie, establishing a branch in Geneva, Switzerland, for the first time. Two years later, in 1908, the bank acquired Fratelli Pasquali, a bank in Chiasso, Switzerland, its first representation in the Italian-speaking portion of the country. This was followed by the 1909 acquisition of Bank für Appenzell (est. 1866) and the 1912 acquisition of Banque d&#x27;Escompte et de Dépots.

The onset of World War I put a hold on much of the bank&#x27;s development. Although SBC survived the war intact, it suffered the loss of its investments in a number of large industrial companies. Nevertheless, the bank surpassed CHF 1 billion for the first time at the end of 1918 and grew to 2,000 employees by 1920. In 1918, SBC purchased Métaux Précieux SA Métalor to refine precious metals and produce bank ingots. the company would be established as a separate subsidiary in 1936 and spun off in 1998. The impact of the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression would be severe, particularly as the Swiss franc suffered major devaluation in 1936. The bank would see its assets fall from a 1929 peak of CHF 1.6 billion to its 1918 levels of CHF 1 billion by 1936.

In 1937, SBC adopted its three keys logo symbolizing confidence, security and discretion. The logo was designed by a Swiss artist and illustrator, Warja Honegger-Lavater.

===Activities in World War II===
On the eve of World War II, SBC was the recipient of large influxes of foreign funds for safekeeping. Just prior to the outbreak of World War II, in 1939, Swiss Bank Corporation made the timely decision to open an office in New York City. The office was able to begin operations, located in the Equitable Building, just weeks after the outbreak of the war and was intended as a safe place to store assets in case of an invasion. During the war, the bank&#x27;s traditional business fell off and the Swiss government became its largest client. Overall, SBC saw its business grow as a result of its wartime government underwriting business.

Decades after the war, it was demonstrated that Swiss Bank Corporation likely took an active role in trading stolen gold, securities and other assets during World War II.

In 1997, the World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks (WJC) was launched to retrieve deposits made by victims of Nazi persecution during and prior to World War II. Negotiations involving SBC&#x27;s successor UBS, Credit Suisse, the World Jewish Congress and Stuart Eizenstat, on behalf of the US, ultimately resulted in a settlement of US$1.25 billion in August 1998 paid by the two large Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse. The settlement, which coincided with UBS&#x27;s merger with Swiss Bank, together with the bank&#x27;s embarrassment in the Long Term Capital Management collapse in 1998 brought a degree of closure to the issue.

===1945–1990===
Swiss Bank Corporation found itself in relatively strong financial condition at the end of World War II, with CHF 1.8 billion of assets. By contrast, the Basler Handelsbank (Commercial Bank of Basel), founded in 1862 and one of the largest banks in Switzerland, was insolvent at the end of the war and was consequently acquired by SBC in 1945. SBC remained among the Swiss government&#x27;s leading underwriters of debt in the post-war years. However, by 1947 SBC was shifting its focus back to its traditional business of lending money principally to private companies as part of the postwar rebuilding of Europe. Meanwhile, the firm continued its expansion to international markets, particularly the United States where SBC focused primarily on commercial banking for corporate clients. Within Switzerland, SBC remained a full-service bank with a domestic retail banking network and an asset management business.

SBC prospered throughout the 1950s and embarked on a period of sustained growth. The bank, which had entered the 1950s with 31 Branch Offices in Switzerland and three abroad, more than doubled its assets from the end of the war to CHF 4 billion by the end of the 1950s and doubled assets again by the mid-1960s, exceeding CHF 10 billion in 1965. SBC acquired Banque Populaire Valaisanne, Sion, Switzerland, and the Banque Populaire de Sierre. The firm continued to open new offices in the US in the mid-1960s and it was also at this time that SBC began to expand into Asia and opened representative offices throughout Latin America. The bank opened a full branch office in Tokyo in 1970. The bank also made a number of acquisitions to enhance its position in various products. SBC acquired a controlling interest in Frei, Treig &amp; Cie. in 1968, Warag Bank in 1970 and Bank Prokredit in 1979 (later sold to GE Capital in 1997). All three banks focused on consumer lending. Similarly, SBC acquired a number of banks in the private banking sector, including Ehinger &amp; Cie. in 1974; Armand von Ernst &amp; Cie. and Adler &amp; Co. in 1976; and a majority interest in Geneva-based Ferrier Lullin &amp; Cie. in 1978. The bank continued its consolidation of Swiss banks acquiring Banque Commerciale de Sion in 1978 and in 1979 acquired Handwerkerbank Basle, the Banca Prealpina SA and Bank für Hypothekarkredite.

As its own home market was highly competitive, SBC focused on commercial banking for American and other multinational companies. Through 1979, SBC was consistently the largest of the three major Swiss Bank by assets, except for short periods in 1962 and 1968 when UBS temporarily moved ahead of SBC. After 1979, although its balance sheet had grown to CHF 74 billion of assets, the bank would typically rank second to UBS which firmly established itself as the largest Swiss bank in the 1980s. SBC would retain this position for the next 15 years until Credit Suisse leapfrogged into the top spot following its 1995 acquisitions of Schweizerische Volksbank and Winterthur Group.

===Aggressive acquisitions (1990–1998)===
Swiss Bank began the 1990s as the weakest of the &quot;Big Three&quot; Swiss banks but by the end of 1997 would be the driving force behind the merger with Union Bank of Switzerland. SBC had been impacted by losses on its real estate investments and a series of minor controversies, despite the bank&#x27;s historically conservative posture. Beginning in the 1980s, SBC along with its Swiss peers began to embrace a more aggressive strategy to keep up with competitors in the US, Japan, Germany and the UK. The bank signaled its new posture in 1990 when it opened its new US headquarters, Swiss Bank Tower, a 29 floor building on 49th Street, adjoining Saks Fifth Avenue.

SBC shifted its focus from traditional commercial banking toward investment banking with an emphasis on building its trading operations. To bolster its trading initiative, in 1992, SBC acquired O&#x27;Connor &amp; Associates, a Chicago-based options trading firm, with an expertise in financial derivatives. O&#x27;Connor was founded in 1977 by mathematician Michael Greenbaum and was named for Edmund (Ed) and Williams (Bill) O&#x27;Connor. The O&#x27;Connor brothers had made a fortune trading grain on the Chicago Board of Trade and founded a First Options, a clearing house business. The O&#x27;Connors provided Greenbaum, who had run risk management for First Options, with the capital to start his own firm. SBC had established a strategic relationship with O&#x27;Connor, which was the largest market maker in the financial options exchanges in the US, beginning in 1988. O&#x27;Connor had been looking to partner with a larger financial institution and in 1989 entered into a currency joint venture with SBC that proved to be the first step towards a sale of O&#x27;Connor to SBC. Following the merger, O&#x27;Connor was combined with SBC&#x27;s money market, capital market and currency market activities to form a globally integrated capital markets and treasury operation. A number of O&#x27;Connor executives were brought into key positions within the bank in an attempt to cultivate a more entrepreneurial culture at SBC.

In 1994, SBC followed up its acquisition of O&#x27;Connor by acquiring Brinson Partners an asset management firm focused on providing access for US institutions to global markets. Founded by Gary P. Brinson, an innovator in financial management, Brinson Partners had emerged as one of largest managers of pension plans and also managed a series of mutual funds. Brinson was a pioneer in the development of the theory of asset allocation which had largely become conventional wisdom among money managers in the 1980s and 1990s. Brinson had begun working at First Chicago Corporation in the 1970s and by 1981 began building the business that would become Brinson Partners. In 1989, Brinson led a US$100 million management buyout of his firm from First Chicago Corporation and over the next five years built up the firm to approximately US$36 billion of assets under management. SBC paid US$750 million to acquire Brinson Partners, which resulted in a profit to Brinson and his partners of US$460 million on the sale of their 75% stake in the company. Following the acquisition of Brinson Partners, Gary Brinson ran SBC&#x27;s asset management business and after the merger with UBS, Brinson was named chief investment officer of UBS Global Asset Management.

SBC&#x27;s next made a major push into investment banking with the acquisition of S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. a leading British investment banking firm in 1995 for US$1.4 billion. S.G. Warburg was founded by Siegmund Warburg, a member of the Warburg banking family. After World War II, S.G. Warburg established a reputation as a daring merchant bank that grew to be one of the most respected investment banks in London. Following a flawed and costly expansion into the US, in 1994 a merger was announced with Morgan Stanley, but the talks collapsed. The following year S.G. Warburg was purchased by Swiss Bank Corporation. The bank merged S.G. Warburg with its own existing investment banking unit to create SBC Warburg, which became a leading player in global investment banking.

Two years later, in 1997, SBC paid US$600 million to acquire Dillon, Read &amp; Co., a white shoe US investment banking firm considered to be a member of the bulge bracket. Dillon, Read, which traced its roots to the 1830s was among the powerhouse firms on Wall Street in the 1920s and 1930s and by the 1990s had a particularly strong mergers and acquisitions advisory group. Dillon Read had been in negotiations to sell itself to ING which owned 25% of the firm already, however Dillon Read partners balked at ING&#x27;s integration plans. After its acquisition by SBC, Dillon Read was merged with SBC-Warburg to create SBC-Warburg Dillon Read. The Dillon Read name was discontinued after the merger with Union Bank of Switzerland although it was brought back in 2005 as Dillon Read Capital Management, UBS&#x27;s ill-fated hedge fund operations.

===Merger with Union Bank of Switzerland===

Aggressively pushing ahead its various acquisitions, UBS was mired in a series of entanglements with activist shareholders who were critical of bank&#x27;s relatively conservative management. Martin Ebner, through his investment trust, BK Vision became the largest shareholder in UBS and attempted to force a major restructuring of the bank’s operations. The groundwork for the merger of SBC and UBS was actually laid by their mutual competitor, Credit Suisse which had approached UBS about a merger that would have created the second largest bank in the world in 1996. UBS&#x27;s management and board unanimously rebuffed the proposed merger. Ebner, who supported the idea of a merger, led a major shareholder revolt that resulted in the replacement of UBS&#x27;s chairman, Robert Studer. Studer&#x27;s successor Mathis Cabiallavetta would be one of the key architects of the merger with SBC.

On December 8, 1997, Union Bank of Switzerland and SBC announced an all-stock merger. At the time of the merger, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation were the second and third largest banks in Switzerland, respectively, both trailing Credit Suisse. Discussions between the two banks had begun several months earlier, less than a year after rebuffing Credit Suisse&#x27;s merger overtures.

The all-stock merger resulted in the creation UBS AG, a huge new bank with total assets of more than US$590 billion. Also referred to as the &quot;New UBS&quot; to distinguish itself from the former Union Bank of Switzerland, the combined bank became the second largest in the world, at that time, behind only the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Additionally, the merger pulled together the banks&#x27; various asset businesses to create the world&#x27;s largest money manager, with approximately US$910 billion in assets under management.

The merger, which was billed as a merger of equals, resulted in SBC&#x27;s shareholders receiving 40% of the bank&#x27;s common shares and Union Bank&#x27;s shareholders receiving 60% of the combined company. SBC&#x27;s Marcel Ospel was named chief executive officer while Union Bank&#x27;s Mathis Cabiallavetta became chairman of the new bank. However, it quickly became evident that from a management perspective, it was SBC that was buying UBS as nearly 80% of the top management positions were filled by legacy Swiss Bank professionals. Additionally, UBS professionals suffered more headcount reductions, particularly in the investment banking unit where there were heavy cuts in the corporate finance and equities businesses. Prior to the merger, Swiss Bank Corporation had built a global investment banking business, Warburg Dillon Read through its acquisitions of Dillon Read in New York and S.G. Warburg in London. SBC was generally considered to be further along than UBS in developing its international investment banking business, particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where Warburg Dillon Read was considered to be the more established platform.

After the merger was completed, it was widely speculated that a series of losses suffered by UBS on its equity derivative positions in late 1997 provided SBC with the leverage it required to consummate the merger. It would become clear that the derivatives losses prompted UBS to accept the terms proposed by SBC more readily than they otherwise would have.

===After the merger===

UBS, the successor of the Union Bank of Switzerland, is among the largest diversified financial institutions in the world. As of 2010, UBS operated in all of the major financial centers worldwide with offices in over 50 countries and 64,000 employees globally.

In November 2000, UBS merged with Paine Webber an American stock brokerage and asset management firm led by chairman and CEO, Donald Marron. The acquisition pushed UBS to the top Wealth and Asset Management Firm in the world. Initially the business was given the divisional name &quot;UBS PaineWebber&quot; but in 2003 the 123-year-old name Paine Webber disappeared when it was renamed &quot;UBS Wealth Management USA.&quot;

The bank would grow considerably in the 2000s, building a large investment banking franchise to compete with the major US and European bulge bracket firms. However, UBS suffered major setbacks in 2007, 2008 and 2009. UBS suffered among the largest losses of any European bank during the subprime mortgage crisis and the bank was required to raise large amounts of outside capital from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, the Swiss government and through a series of equity offerings in 2008 and 2009.

===Acquisition history===
Swiss Bank Corporation, prior to its merger with Union Bank of Switzerland was the result of the combination of dozens of individual firms, many of which date to the 19th century. The following is an illustration of the company&#x27;s major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors, although this is not necessarily a comprehensive list:

<text>NHIndustries (NHI) is a helicopter manufacturing company specifically established to be NATO Helicopter Management Agency&#x27;s prime contractor for the design and development, industrialisation, production and logistic support of the NHIndustries NH90 series of helicopters.

Established in 1992, NHIndustries was formed as a partnership between Eurocopter of France and Germany (now Airbus Helicopters), Agusta of Italy (now Leonardo) and Stork Fokker Aerospace of the Netherlands (now Fokker Aerostructures).

==History==
The NHIndustries NH90 is a medium-sized, twin-engine, multi-role military helicopter developed in response to NATO requirements calling for a battlefield helicopter which would also be capable of being operated in naval environments. Both development and manufacture of the rotorcraft has been principally handled by NHIndustries, a collaborative company. It is presently owned by Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo (formerly AgustaWestland) and Fokker Aerostructures.

In 1985, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom teamed to develop a NATO battlefield transport and anti-ship/anti-submarine helicopter for the 1990s. The United Kingdom left the team in 1987. On 1 September 1992, NH Industries signed an NH90 design-and-development contract with NAHEMA (NATO Helicopter Management Agency). This agency represented the four participating nations: France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Portugal later joined the agency in June 2001.

Design work on the helicopter started in 1993. The first prototype, PT1, made the type&#x27;s first flight on 18 December 1995. The second prototype, PT2, first flew on 19 March 1997 and the third prototype, PT3, on 27 November 1998. On 12 December 2002, PT3 became the first helicopter to fly exclusively with fly-by-wire controls following the removal of mechanical back-up controls.

The NH90 was developed into two main variants: the Tactical Transport Helicopter (TTH) and the NATO Frigate Helicopter (NFH). These two main variants share about 75% commonality with each other. Many of the operators have requested specific configurations to their own helicopter fleets, thus each nation&#x27;s NH90 is effectively customized to the end-user&#x27;s requirements. During the development phase of the programme in the 1990s, both technical and funding problems were experienced. In June 2000, the partner nations placed a large production order for the type, valued at US$8.6 billion, for a total of 366 helicopters. Additional orders have since followed from customers in Europe, Asia, and Australia. By April 2013, a total of 529 NH90s of all variants were on order by various customers.

The NH90 was initially intended to be produced at three exporting final assembly lines (FAL); Cascina Costa in Italy for AgustaWestland, Marignane in France and Donauwörth in Germany for Airbus Helicopters. The Nordic and Australian contracts stipulated production locally (the Nordic ones at Patria in Finland and the Australian ones in Brisbane). Spain has a final assembly line at Albacete. The Marignane assembly line can reportedly complete up to 22 NH90s per year.

The production responsibilities were divided amongst the major sections/components amongst each of the shareholding companies:
* Airbus Helicopters France 31.25% (Engines, Rotors, the Electrical, flight control and the core avionics systems)
* Airbus Helicopters Deutschland 31.25% (Forward and centre fuselage, the fuel, communications and avionics control systems)
* Fokker 5.5% (Tail structure, doors, sponsons, landing gear and the intermediate gearbox)
* AgustaWestland 32% (Rear fuselage, main gearbox, hydraulic system, automatic flight control and plant management systems, power plant and the NFH mission system)
Once fabricated, items are shipped from these companies to the six final assembly facilities, at Marignane, France; Tessera, Italy; Donauwörth, Germany; Halli, Finland; and Brisbane, Australia.

During 2007, the NH90 first entered operational service with the German Army. During April 2010, the Royal Netherlands Navy was the first customer to receive the navalised NH90 NFH variant. In order to speed up delivery and reduce the complexity of manufacturing a large number of variants, NH Industries proposed the adoption of a simplified baseline airframe which could be configured to the individual customer&#x27;s requirements. Between 2004 and 2016, the production lead times for the NH90 had reduced from 18 months to 7.5 months. During 2014, worldwide production of the NH90 peaked at 53 helicopters. By January 2017, the NH90 had logged 127,000 flight hours in the armed forces of thirteen nations.

<doc id="520380" wikidata="Q3418128" url="?curid=520380" title="Ralliement créditiste">
<text>Historically in Quebec, Canada, there were a number of political parties that were part of the Canadian social credit movement. There were various parties at different times with different names at the provincial level, all broadly following the social credit philosophy; at various times they had varying degrees of affiliation with the Social Credit Party of Canada at the federal level.

The greatest success achieved by a provincial social credit party in Quebec was the Ralliement créditiste du Québec, which won 12 seats in the 1970 Quebec provincial election.

==Union des électeurs==
The Union des électeurs (UE) (in English: &quot;Union of Electors&quot;) was founded in 1939 by Louis Even and Gilberte Côté-Mercier. It was the first &quot;créditiste&quot; political movement to be active in Quebec. It ran two candidates, Even and Armand Turpin in the 1940 federal election as part of the Canada-wide New Democracy movement. Even won 17% of the vote and placed third in the riding of Lake St-John—Roberval. Turpin placed second with over 31.8% of the vote in Hull. Even and the Union attended the founding convention of the Social Credit Association of Canada in 1944 and opposed the bid of the western Canada-based Social Credit federal caucus to establish a central party under the leadership of Solon Low. While Even&#x27;s group ran candidates in the 1945 federal election under the national Social Credit banner and again in subsequent by-elections, by 1949 the Quebec créditistes were again running candidates under the Union des électeurs banner as they were also doing in the Quebec provincial elections.

The Union was accused of anti-Semitism and of distributing the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; in Quebec. The Canadian Jewish Congress referred to it as &quot;fast becoming the rallying point of the numerous Jew-haters in French Canada&quot;.

The Union des électeurs&#x27; electoral philosophy was that it was not a partisan political party but an organization which marshals voters to enforce their wishes on their elected representatives. Even&#x27;s belief, like that of social credit originator C.H. Douglas, was that parties were corrupt and that the party system should be replaced by a &quot;union of electors&quot; who would compel elected officials to follow the popular will. Even and the Union broke with the national Social Credit organization in 1947 due to Ernest Manning&#x27;s increasingly hostile attitude towards them and his purge of anti-Semites from the movement. The Union influenced some Social Crediters outside of Quebec, including the Social Credit Association of Ontario which stood its candidates in the 1948 Ontario elections under the name &quot;Union of Electors&quot;. In British Columbia, there was a &quot;Union of Electors&quot; party which ran as a rival to the British Columbia Social Credit League in the 1949 provincial election.

With Réal Caouette and then P. Ernest Grégoire as leader, the Quebec provincial party contested seats in the 1944 provincial election but won no seats and the 1948 provincial election when it managed to get 9.25% of the popular vote, but again won no seats. It also ran candidates federally: Caouette was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1946 by-election under the Social Credit banner. He failed to win re-election in the 1949 federal election as a Union des électeurs candidate, when the party ran a total of 56 candidates. None were successful.

The Union des électeurs faded away as a political party after 1949. In the 1950s, Caouette contested seats in various by-elections against the wishes of Even and Côté-Mercier. In 1958, Caouette broke with Even and Côté-Mercier and founded the Ralliement des créditistes, which ran candidates in federal elections in the 1950s and 1960s and was, at times, the Quebec branch of the Social Credit Party of Canada. In 1970, the federal Ralliement des créditistes founded a distinct provincial branch, the Ralliement créditiste du Québec.

In 1939, Even and Côté also founded a lay Catholic group called the &quot;Pilgrims of Saint Michael&quot;, based in Rougemont, Quebec, that continues to promote social credit monetary policy coupled with conservative Catholicism. The Pilgrims publish &quot;The Michael Journal&quot; in English and &quot;Vers Demain&quot; in French. The group was founded in 1939 and is nicknamed &quot;the White Berets&quot; for the headgear worn by members.

==Candidats des électeurs==
Réal Caouette ran under this label in the 1957 and 1958 federal elections, but failed to win a seat.

==Candidats libéral des électeurs==
In the 1962 and 1963 federal elections, a small breakaway from Social Credit ran a single candidate under the name Candidat libéral des électeurs without success. The 1962 candidate, J.-Edouard Pharon, received 1,800 votes – 500 more than the Social Credit candidate.

==Ralliement des créditistes du Canada==
Réal Caouette had been a social credit stalwart since the joining the movement in 1939, running as a candidate for the Union des électeurs. He won a seat in the House of Commons in a by-election, but lost it in the next general election. He was a true believer in social credit theory and a charismatic, almost evangelical speaker.

In 1958, he broke with Union des électeurs founders Louis Even and Gilberte Côté-Mercier, and formed the Ralliement des créditistes du Canada as the Quebec wing of the Social Credit Party of Canada on May 4, 1958. Caouette was named leader of the new organization. His party political broadcasts on Quebec television developed a great following. Caouette ran for the leadership of the Social Credit Party of Canada in 1961, but was defeated by Robert N. Thompson.

Driven by Caouette&#x27;s fiery oratory, the Social Credit Party achieved a breakthrough in the 1962 federal election, winning 26 seats in Quebec. Only four Social Credit MPs were elected in the rest of Canada.

Thompson insisted on remaining national party leader after 1962, even though the Social Credit caucus was overwhelmingly from Quebec and regarded Caouette as its leader. Thompson accepted Caouette as his deputy leader.

This tension led to a split: in 1963, the Quebec wing became independent from the party in the rest of country as the Ralliement des créditistes, or Social Credit Rally in English. Of the 20 Social Credit MPs elected in Quebec in the 1963 federal election, 13 followed Caouette into the Ralliement, five ran in the next election as independents and two joined the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.
The Ralliement ran as a separate party in the 1965 federal election. Nine of its candidates were elected in Quebec in 1965. It went on to win 14 seats in Quebec in 1968, and then creditiste leader Caouette became leader of the Social Credit Party. The party took seats in Quebec in the 1970s.

In 1968, Thompson joined the Progressive Conservative Party.

===General election results – Ralliement des créditistes===

==Ralliement créditiste==

In October 1967, the Ralliement des créditistes changed its name to Ralliement créditiste.

In the 1968 federal election, the Social Credit Party won no seats in the House of Commons, while Caouette&#x27;s Ralliement créditiste returned 14 MPs.

In 1969, the federal Ralliement créditiste entered provincial politics by running candidates in four Quebec by-elections. The candidates appeared on the ballot without party designation, as the party did not run candidates in the last general election. All were defeated. A dissident group opposed to Caouette&#x27;s leadership founded the Parti crédit social uni in this period.

The Ralliement créditiste du Québec was created in January 1970 and fielded candidates in the 1970 and 1973 provincial elections.

In 1971, Caouette and the Ralliement créditiste rejoined the Social Credit Party of Canada, and Caouette was elected national leader.

The Social Credit Party under Caouette&#x27;s leadership won 15 seats in 1972 and 11 in 1974. Under Fabien Roy’s leadership it won 6 in 1979. It won no seats in 1980.

<text>John Miller Andrews (17 July 1871 – 5 August 1956) was the second Prime Minister of Northern Ireland from 1940 to 1943.

==Family life==
Andrews was born in Comber, County Down, Ireland in 1871, the eldest child in the family of four sons and one daughter of Thomas Andrews, flax spinner, and his wife Eliza Pirrie, a sister of Viscount Pirrie, chairman of Harland and Wolff.

He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. In business, Andrews was a landowner, a director of his family linen-bleaching company and of the Belfast Ropeworks. His younger brother, Thomas Andrews, who died in the 1912 sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, was managing director of the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast; another brother, Sir James Andrews, 1st Baronet, was Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland.

In 1902 he married Jessie (died 1950), eldest daughter of Bolton stockbroker Joseph Ormrod at Rivington Unitarian Chapel, Rivington, near Chorley, Lancashire, England. They had one son and two daughters. His younger brother, Sir James, married Jessie&#x27;s sister.

==Political career==
Andrews was elected as a member of parliament in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, sitting from 1921 until 1953 (for County Down constituency from 1921 to 1929 and for Mid-Down from 1929 to 1953). He was a founder member of the Ulster Unionist Labour Association, which he chaired, and was Minister of Labour from 1921 to 1937. He was Minister of Finance from 1937 to 1940, succeeding to the position on the death of Hugh MacDowell Pollock; on the death of Lord Craigavon, in 1940, he became leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the second Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Andrews was an opponent of the Irish language and called for it to be banned in schools.

In April 1943 backbench dissent forced him from office. He was replaced as Prime Minister by Sir Basil Brooke. Andrews remained, however, the recognised leader of the UUP for a further three years. Five years later he became the Grand Master of the Orange Order. From 1949, he was the last parliamentary survivor of the original 1921 Northern Ireland Parliament, and as such was recognised as the Father of the House. He is the only Prime Minister of Northern Ireland not to have been granted a peerage; his predecessor and successor received hereditary viscountcies, and later Prime Ministers were granted life peerages.

Throughout his life he was deeply involved in the Orange Order; he held the positions of Grand Master of County Down from 1941 and Grand Master of Ireland (1948–1954). In 1949 he was appointed Imperial Grand Master of the Grand Orange Council of the World.
Andrews was a committed and active member of the Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland. He regularly attended Sunday worship, in the church built on land donated by his great-grandfather James Andrews in his home town Comber. Andrews served on the Comber Congregational Committee from 1896 until his death in 1956 (holding the position of Chairman from 1935 onwards). He is buried in the small graveyard adjoining the church.

He was named after his maternal great-uncle, John Miller of Comber (1795–1883).

<text>The Ruhleben barracks () is part of the German naval establishment located in Plön, Holstein, Germany.

From 1940 to 1945 it was home to the III U-Boat Training Division (&quot;III Untersee-Boot Ausbildungsabteilung&quot;). On April 22, 1945 Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz moved the headquarters of the Naval High Command (&quot;Oberkommando der Marine&quot;) there. As of April 30, 1945 until May 2, 1945, following Dönitz being named head of the German Reich, it was the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Germany.

On May 7, 1945, the installation was captured by British forces who installed themselves there and renamed it the Connaught Barracks. Towards the end of formal British occupation, the British set up the King Alfred School on March 10, 1948, to teach the children of the British military service personnel stationed in Germany.

Following the re-establishment of the German Navy, the barracks reopened as the home of the Naval NCO School (&quot;Marineunteroffizierschule Plön&quot;) on September 9, 1960.

<doc id="520401" wikidata="Q1132439" url="?curid=520401" title="The Practice">
<text>The Practice is an American legal drama television series created by David E. Kelley centering on partners and associates at a Boston law firm. The show ran for eight seasons on ABC, from March 4, 1997, to May 16, 2004. It won an Emmy in 1998 and 1999 for Outstanding Drama Series, and spawned the spin-off series &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, which ran for five more seasons (from 2004 to 2008).

Conflict between legal ethics and personal morality was a recurring theme with light comedy being occasionally present. Kelley claimed that the show was intended to be something of a rebuttal to &quot;L.A. Law&quot; and its romanticized treatment of the American legal system and legal proceedings.

== Overview ==
In season 1, Robert Donnell and Associates features Bobby Donnell as the sole senior partner in a firm that he started a decade prior with his receptionist Rebecca Washington. Ellenor Frutt, Eugene Young and Lindsay Dole are his associates. Jimmy Berluti is hired as an associate after losing his job in finance in an attempt to help Donnell and Associates with a loan.

In season 2, Eugene, Lindsay and Ellenor become partners after Lindsay insists on equity. Robert Donnell and Associates becomes Donnell, Young, Dole and Frutt. Helen Gamble, an assistant district attorney, becomes regularly entangled in the cases and personal lives of the employees of the firm. She is a personal friend of Lindsay and viewers learn several episodes into the season that Bobby and Lindsay have had an on-again/off-again secret affair. Her romantic relationship with Bobby ends after a high-profile murder case pits them against one another.

In season 3, Rebecca Washington, who had been attending law school in secret, becomes an associate after passing the bar exam. Lucy Hatcher is then hired as the new receptionist.

In season 4, Assistant District Attorney Richard Bay, like Helen, becomes a frequent ally and opponent of Donnell, Young, Dole and Frutt.

In season 8, Donnell, Young, Dole and Frutt has been renamed to Young, Frutt and Berluti. Eugene has taken Bobby&#x27;s place as a senior partner. Lucy has left the firm to become a full-time rape crisis counselor. Rebecca has also left the firm for unknown reasons. Helen is no longer present at the firm&#x27;s cases. Tara Wilson is hired as a paralegal, and Alan Shore becomes an associate. After firing Alan and Tara – as well as being sued by the former – Young, Frutt and Berluti dissolve. Eugene then becomes a judge. Ellenor focuses her attention on motherhood. Jimmy and Jamie begin a new firm. Alan and Tara are hired by another firm, Crane, Poole and Schmidt and their story is continued in &quot;Boston Legal&quot;.

== Budget reduction and major revamp ==
By the end of the seventh season, faced with sagging ratings, ABC conditioned the show&#x27;s renewal on a drastic budget reduction. As a result, Dylan McDermott, Kelli Williams, Lara Flynn Boyle, Chyler Leigh, Marla Sokoloff, and LisaGay Hamilton were fired as regulars. McDermott and Sokoloff reappeared as special guest stars and a recurring character respectively in the eighth season. The addition of James Spader and Rhona Mitra to the cast somewhat revived the ratings as Spader went on to win an Emmy for his appearance. However, ABC announced that &quot;The Practice&quot; would not return for a ninth season on March 11, 2004. Instead, Kelley would create a new spin-off series called &quot;Boston Legal&quot; which starred Spader, Mitra, Lake Bell, William Shatner and Candice Bergen.

== Episodes ==

&quot;The Practice&quot; had 8 seasons and a total of 168 episodes.
=== Crossovers ===

* &quot;Axe Murderer&quot; (S02E26) – The lawyers of Robert Donnell and Associates work with the lawyers of Cage &amp; Fish on a case in which a woman is accused of killing a wealthy client who may have been Lizzie Borden in a past life. The case had begun on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;: &quot;The Inmates&quot; (S01E20).
* &quot;The Day After&quot; (S05E14) – Ellenor Frutt and Jimmy Berlutti are hired to represent Coach Riley, who&#x27;s been fired from Winslow High for withholding information about Milton Buttle&#x27;s affair. The hearing happens on &quot;Boston Public&quot;: &quot;Chapter Thirteen&quot; (S01E13).
* &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Crossover&quot; (S05E16) – When Ellenor Frutt has trouble with her pregnancy, Dr. Ben Gideon helps out in &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Crossing&quot;: &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (S01E17).

Additionally, Bobby Donnell (Dylan McDermott) appears in the &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; season 1 finale &quot;These Are the Days&quot;, while Lara Flynn Boyle and Michael Badalucco each make cameos in &quot;Making Spirits Bright&quot; and &quot;I Know Him by Heart&quot;.

Lara Flynn Boyle had an uncredited guest appearance as a rebuttal witness, opposite of guest star Heather Locklear&#x27;s character in the season 5 episode &quot;Tom Dooley&quot;.

== Home media ==
&quot;The Practice&quot;, Volume 1, was released as a four-disc DVD set in North America on June 12, 2007. The set includes all six episodes of season 1 and the first seven episodes of season 2. It also includes a featurette, &quot;Setting Up The Practice&quot;. The set was also released in Region 4 on June 6, 2007 and in Region 2 on June 29, 2008.

On January 3, 2014, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1 and would release the final season on DVD on April 15, 2014.

<doc id="520402" wikidata="Q860308" url="?curid=520402" title="Liquid-propellant rocket">
<text>A liquid-propellant rocket or liquid rocket uses a rocket engine burning liquid propellants. (Alternate approaches use gaseous or solid propellants.) Liquids are desirable propellants because they have reasonably high density and their combustion products have high specific impulse (&quot;I&quot;sp). This allows the volume of the propellant tanks to be relatively low.

== Types ==
Liquid rockets can be monopropellant rockets using a single type of propellant, or bipropellant rockets using two types of propellant. Tripropellant rockets using three types of propellant are rare. Liquid oxidizer propellants are also used in hybrid rockets, with some of the advantages of a solid rocket. Bipropellant liquid rockets use a liquid fuel such as liquid hydrogen or RP-1, and a liquid oxidizer such as liquid oxygen. The engine may be a cryogenic rocket engine, where the fuel and oxidizer, such as hydrogen and oxygen, are gases which have been liquefied at very low temperatures.

Most designs of liquid rocket engines are throttleable for variable thrust operation. Some allow control of the propellant mixture ratio (ratio at which oxidizer and fuel are mixed). Some can be shut down and, with a suitable ignition system or self-igniting propellant, restarted.

Hybrid rockets apply a liquid or gaseous oxidizer to a solid fuel. 

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The use of liquid propellants has a number of advantages:
* A liquid rocket engine can be tested prior to use, whereas for a solid rocket motor a rigorous quality management must be applied during manufacturing to ensure high reliability.
* Liquid systems enable higher specific impulse than solids and hybrid rocket motors and can provide very high tankage efficiency.
* A liquid rocket engine can also usually be reused for several flights, as in the Space Shuttle and Falcon 9 series rockets, although reuse of solid rocket motors was also effectively demonstrated during the Shuttle program.
* The flow of propellant into the combustion chamber can be throttled, which allows for control over the magnitude of the thrust throughout the flight. This enables real-time error correction during the flight along with efficiency gains.
* Shutdown and restart capabilities allow for multiple burn cycles throughout a flight.
* In the case of an emergency, liquid propelled rockets can be shutdown in a controlled manner, which provides an extra level of safety and mission abort capability.
Use of liquid propellants can also be associated with a number of issues:

* Because the propellant is a very large proportion of the mass of the vehicle, the center of mass shifts significantly rearward as the propellant is used; one will typically lose control of the vehicle if its center mass gets too close to the center of drag/pressure.
* When operated within an atmosphere, pressurization of the typically very thin-walled propellant tanks must guarantee positive gauge pressure at all times to avoid catastrophic collapse of the tank.
* Liquid propellants are subject to &quot;slosh&quot;, which has frequently led to loss of control of the vehicle. This can be controlled with slosh baffles in the tanks as well as judicious control laws in the guidance system.
* They can suffer from pogo oscillation where the rocket suffers from uncommanded cycles of acceleration.
* Liquid propellants often need ullage motors in zero-gravity or during staging to avoid sucking gas into engines at start up. They are also subject to vortexing within the tank, particularly towards the end of the burn, which can also result in gas being sucked into the engine or pump.
* Liquid propellants can leak, especially hydrogen, possibly leading to the formation of an explosive mixture.
* Turbopumps to pump liquid propellants are complex to design, and can suffer serious failure modes, such as overspeeding if they run dry or shedding fragments at high speed if metal particles from the manufacturing process enter the pump.
* Cryogenic propellants, such as liquid oxygen, freeze atmospheric water vapor into ice. This can damage or block seals and valves and can cause leaks and other failures. Avoiding this problem often requires lengthy &quot;chilldown&quot; procedures which attempt to remove as much of the vapor from the system as possible. Ice can also form on the outside of the tank, and later fall and damage the vehicle. External foam insulation can cause issues as shown by the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Non-cryogenic propellants do not cause such problems.
* Non-storable liquid rockets require considerable preparation immediately before launch. This makes them less practical than solid rockets for most weapon systems.

== Principle of operation ==
Liquid rocket engines have tankage and pipes to store and transfer propellant, an injector system and one or more combustion chambers with associated nozzles.

Typical liquid propellants have densities roughly similar to water, approximately . An exception is liquid hydrogen which has a much lower density, while requiring only relatively modest pressure to prevent vaporization. The density and low pressure of liquid propellants permit lightweight tankage: approximately 1% of the contents for dense propellants and around 10% for liquid hydrogen. The increased tank mass is due to liquid hydrogen&#x27;s low density and the mass of the required insulation.

For injection into the combustion chamber, the propellant pressure at the injectors needs to be greater than the chamber pressure. This is often achieved with a pump. Suitable pumps usually use centrifugal turbopumps due to their high power and light weight, although reciprocating pumps have been employed in the past. Turbopumps are usually lightweight and can give excellent performance; with an on-Earth weight well under 1% of the thrust. Indeed, overall thrust to weight ratios including a turbopump have been as high as 155:1 with the SpaceX Merlin 1D rocket engine and up to 180:1 with the vacuum version. Instead of a pump, some designs use a tank of a high-pressure inert gas such as helium to pressurize the propellants. These rockets often provide lower delta-v because the mass of the pressurant tankage reduces performance. In some designs for high altitude or vacuum use the tankage mass can be acceptable.

The major components of a rocket engine are therefore the combustion chamber (thrust chamber), pyrotechnic igniter, propellant feed system, valves, regulators, propellant tanks and the rocket engine nozzle. For feeding propellants to the combustion chamber, liquid-propellant engines are either pressure-fed or pump-fed, with pump-fed engines working in a variety of engine cycles.

== Pressurization ==
Liquid propellants are often pumped into the combustion chamber with a lightweight centrifugal turbopump. Recently, some aerospace companies have used electric pumps with batteries. In simpler, small engines, an inert gas stored in a tank at a high pressure is sometimes used instead of pumps to force propellants into the combustion chamber. These engines may have a higher mass ratio, but are usually more reliable, and are therefore used widely in satellites for orbit maintenance.

==Propellants==

Thousands of combinations of fuels and oxidizers have been tried over the years. Some of the more common and practical ones are:

===Cryogenic===
* Liquid oxygen (LOX, O2) and liquid hydrogen (LH, H2) – Space Shuttle main engines, Space Launch System core stage, Ariane 5 main stage and the Ariane 5 ECA second stage, the BE-3 of Blue Origin&#x27;s New Shepard, the first and second stage of the Delta IV, the upper stages of the Ares I, Saturn V&#x27;s second and third stages, Saturn IB, and Saturn I as well as Centaur rocket stage, the upper stages of the Long March 3, Long March 5, Long March 8, the first stage and second stage of the H-II, H-IIA, H-IIB, and the upper stage of the GSLV Mk-II and GSLV Mk-III. The main advantages of this mixture are a clean burn (water vapor is the only combustion product) and high performance.
* Liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid methane (CH4, liquefied natural gas, LNG) – the Raptor (SpaceX) and BE-4 (Blue Origin) engines. (See also Propulsion Cryogenics &amp; Advanced Development project of NASA, and Project Morpheus.)

One of the most efficient mixtures, oxygen and hydrogen, suffers from the extremely low temperatures required for storing liquid hydrogen (around ) and very low fuel density (, compared to RP-1 at ), necessitating large tanks that must also be lightweight and insulating. Lightweight foam insulation on the Space Shuttle external tank led to the &#x27;s destruction, as a piece broke loose, damaged its wing and caused it to break up on atmospheric reentry.

Liquid methane/LNG has several advantages over LH. Its performance (max. specific impulse) is lower than that of LH but higher than that of RP1 (kerosene) and solid propellants, and its higher density, similarly to other hydrocarbon fuels, provides higher thrust to volume ratios than LH, although its density is not as high as that of RP1. This makes it specially attractive for reusable launch systems because higher density allows for smaller motors, propellant tanks and associated systems. LNG also burns with less or no soot (less or no coking) than RP1, which eases reusability when compared with it, and LNG and RP1 burn cooler than LH so LNG and RP1 do not deform the interior structures of the engine as much. This means that engines that burn LNG can be reused more than those that burn RP1 or LH. Unlike engines that burn LH, both RP1 and LNG engines can be designed with a shared shaft with a single turbine and two turbopumps, one each for LOX and LNG/RP1. In space, LNG does not need heaters to keep it liquid, unlike RP1. LNG is less expensive, being readily available in large quantities. It can be stored for more prolonged periods of time, and is less explosive than LH.

===Semi-cryogenic===
* Liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 (kerosene) – Saturn V&#x27;s first stage, Zenit rocket, R-7-derived vehicles including Soyuz, Delta, Saturn I, and Saturn IB first stages, Titan I and Atlas rockets, Falcon 1 and Falcon 9, Long March 5, Long March 6, Long March 7 and Long March 8 first stages. 
* Liquid oxygen (LOX) and alcohol (ethanol, C2H5OH) – early liquid rockets, like German (World War II) A4, aka V-2, and Redstone
* Liquid oxygen (LOX) and gasoline – Robert Goddard&#x27;s first liquid rocket
* Liquid oxygen (LOX) and carbon monoxide (CO) – proposed for a Mars &quot;hopper&quot; vehicle (with a specific impulse of approximately 250s), principally because carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced by Zirconia electrolysis from the Martian atmosphere without requiring use of any of the Martian water resources to obtain Hydrogen.

=== Non-cryogenic/storable/hypergolic ===
Many non-cryogenic bipropellants are hypergolic (self igniting).
* T-Stoff (80% hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 as the oxidizer) and C-Stoff (methanol, , and hydrazine hydrate, as the fuel) – used for the Hellmuth-Walter-Werke HWK 109-509A, -B and -C engine family used on the Messerschmitt Me 163B Komet, an operational rocket fighter plane of World War II, and Ba 349 &quot;Natter&quot; crewed VTO interceptor prototypes.
* Nitric acid (HNO3) and kerosene – Soviet BI-1 and MiG I-270 rocket fighter prototypes, Scud-A, aka SS-1 SRBM
* Inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA, HNO3 + N2O4) and unsymmetric dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH, (CH3)2N2H2) – Soviet Scud-C, aka SS-1-c,-d,-e
* Nitric acid 73% with dinitrogen tetroxide 27% (AK27) and kerosene/gasoline mixture (TM-185) – various Russian (USSR) cold-war ballistic missiles (R-12, Scud-B,-D), Iran: Shahab-5, North Korea: Taepodong-2
* High-test peroxide (H2O2) and kerosene – UK (1970s) Black Arrow, USA Development (or study): BA-3200
* Hydrazine (N2H4) and red fuming nitric acid – MIM-3 Nike Ajax Anti-aircraft missile
* Unsymmetric dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) – Proton, Rokot, Long March 2 (used to launch Shenzhou crew vehicles.)
* Aerozine 50 (50% UDMH, 50% hydrazine) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) – Titans 2–4, Apollo lunar module, Apollo service module, interplanetary probes (Such as Voyager 1 and Voyager 2)
* Monomethylhydrazine (MMH, (CH3)HN2H2) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) – Space Shuttle orbiter&#x27;s orbital maneuvering system (OMS) engines and Reaction control system (RCS) thrusters. SpaceX&#x27;s Draco and SuperDraco engines for the Dragon spacecraft.

For storable ICBMs and most spacecraft, including crewed vehicles, planetary probes, and satellites, storing cryogenic propellants over extended periods is unfeasible. Because of this, mixtures of hydrazine or its derivatives in combination with nitrogen oxides are generally used for such applications, but are toxic and carcinogenic. Consequently, to improve handling, some crew vehicles such as Dream Chaser and Space Ship Two plan to use hybrid rockets with non-toxic fuel and oxidizer combinations.

==Injectors==
The injector implementation in liquid rockets determines the percentage of the theoretical performance of the nozzle that can be achieved. A poor injector performance causes unburnt propellant to leave the engine, giving poor efficiency.

Additionally, injectors are also usually key in reducing thermal loads on the nozzle; by increasing the proportion of fuel around the edge of the chamber, this gives much lower temperatures on the walls of the nozzle.

===Types of injectors===
Injectors can be as simple as a number of small diameter holes arranged in carefully constructed patterns through which the fuel and oxidizer travel. The speed of the flow is determined by the square root of the pressure drop across the injectors, the shape of the hole and other details such as the density of the propellant.

The first injectors used on the V-2 created parallel jets of fuel and oxidizer which then combusted in the chamber. This gave quite poor efficiency.

Injectors today classically consist of a number of small holes which aim jets of fuel and oxidizer so that they collide at a point in space a short distance away from the injector plate. This helps to break the flow up into small droplets that burn more easily.

The main types of injectors are
* Shower head
* Self-impinging doublet
* Cross-impinging triplet
* Centripetal or swirling
* Pintle

The pintle injector permits good mixture control of fuel and oxidizer over a wide range of flow rates. The pintle injector was used in the Apollo Lunar Module engines (Descent Propulsion System) and the Kestrel engine, it is currently used in the Merlin engine on Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.

The RS-25 engine designed for the Space Shuttle uses a system of fluted posts, which use heated hydrogen from the preburner to vaporize the liquid oxygen flowing through the center of the posts and this improves the rate and stability of the combustion process; previous engines such as the F-1 used for the Apollo program had significant issues with oscillations that led to destruction of the engines, but this was not a problem in the RS-25 due to this design detail.

Valentin Glushko invented the centripetal injector in the early 1930s, and it has been almost universally used in Russian engines. Rotational motion is applied to the liquid (and sometimes the two propellants are mixed), then it is expelled through a small hole, where it forms a cone-shaped sheet that rapidly atomizes. Goddard&#x27;s first liquid engine used a single impinging injector. German scientists in WWII experimented with impinging injectors on flat plates, used successfully in the Wasserfall missile.

===Combustion stability===

To avoid instabilities such as &quot;chugging,&quot; which is a relatively low speed oscillation, the engine must be designed with enough pressure drop across the injectors to render the flow largely independent of the chamber pressure. This pressure drop is normally achieved by using at least 20% of the chamber pressure across the injectors.

Nevertheless, particularly in larger engines, a high speed combustion oscillation is easily triggered, and these are not well understood. These high speed oscillations tend to disrupt the gas side boundary layer of the engine, and this can cause the cooling system to rapidly fail, destroying the engine. These kinds of oscillations are much more common on large engines, and plagued the development of the Saturn V, but were finally overcome.

Some combustion chambers, such as those of the RS-25 engine, use Helmholtz resonators as damping mechanisms to stop particular resonant frequencies from growing.

To prevent these issues the RS-25 injector design instead went to a lot of effort to vaporize the propellant prior to injection into the combustion chamber. Although many other features were used to ensure that instabilities could not occur, later research showed that these other features were unnecessary, and the gas phase combustion worked reliably.

Testing for stability often involves the use of small explosives. These are detonated within the chamber during operation, and causes an impulsive excitation. By examining the pressure trace of the chamber to determine how quickly the effects of the disturbance die away, it is possible to estimate the stability and redesign features of the chamber if required.

==Engine cycles==
For liquid-propellant rockets, four different ways of powering the injection of the propellant into the chamber are in common use.

Fuel and oxidizer must be pumped into the combustion chamber against the pressure of the hot gasses being burned, and engine power is limited by the rate at which propellant can be pumped into the combustion chamber. For atmospheric or launcher use, high pressure, and thus high power, engine cycles are desirable to minimize gravity drag. For orbital use, lower power cycles are usually fine.

;Pressure-fed cycle: The propellants are forced in from pressurised (relatively heavy) tanks. The heavy tanks mean that a relatively low pressure is optimal, limiting engine power, but all the fuel is burned, allowing high efficiency. The pressurant used is frequently helium due to its lack of reactivity and low density. Examples: AJ-10, used in the Space Shuttle OMS, Apollo SPS, and the second stage of the Delta II.
;Electric pump-fed: An electric motor, generally a brushless DC electric motor, drives the pumps. The electric motor is powered by a battery pack. It is relatively simple to implement and reduces the complexity of the turbomachinery design, but at the expense of the extra dry mass of the battery pack. Example engine is the Rutherford designed and used by Rocket Lab.
;Gas-generator cycle: A small percentage of the propellants are burnt in a preburner to power a turbopump and then exhausted through a separate nozzle, or low down on the main one. This results in a reduction in efficiency since the exhaust contributes little or no thrust, but the pump turbines can be very large, allowing for high power engines. Examples: Saturn V&#x27;s F-1 and J-2, Delta IV&#x27;s RS-68, Ariane 5&#x27;s HM7B, Falcon 9&#x27;s Merlin.
;Tap-off cycle: Takes hot gases from the main combustion chamber of the rocket engine and routes them through engine turbopump turbines to pump propellant, then is exhausted. Since not all propellant flows through the main combustion chamber, the tap-off cycle is considered an open-cycle engine. Examples include the J-2S and BE-3.
;Expander cycle: Cryogenic fuel (hydrogen, or methane) is used to cool the walls of the combustion chamber and nozzle. Absorbed heat vaporizes and expands the fuel which is then used to drive the turbopumps before it enters the combustion chamber, allowing for high efficiency, or is bled overboard, allowing for higher power turbopumps. The limited heat available to vaporize the fuel constrains engine power. Examples: RL10 for Atlas V and Delta IV second stages (closed cycle), H-II&#x27;s LE-5 (bleed cycle).
;Staged combustion cycle: A fuel- or oxidizer-rich mixture is burned in a preburner and then drives turbopumps, and this high-pressure exhaust is fed directly into the main chamber where the remainder of the fuel or oxidizer undergoes combustion, permitting very high pressures and efficiency. Examples: SSME, RD-191, LE-7.
;Full-flow staged combustion cycle: Fuel- and oxidizer-rich mixtures are burned in separate preburners and driving the turbopumps, then both high-pressure exhausts, one oxygen rich and the other fuel rich, are fed directly into the main chamber where they combine and combust, permitting very high pressures and high efficiency. Example: SpaceX Raptor.

===Engine cycle tradeoffs===
Selecting an engine cycle is one of the earlier steps to rocket engine design. A number of tradeoffs arise from this selection, some of which include:
==Cooling==

Injectors are commonly laid out so that a fuel-rich layer is created at the combustion chamber wall. This reduces the temperature there, and downstream to the throat and even into the nozzle and permits the combustion chamber to be run at higher pressure, which permits a higher expansion ratio nozzle to be used which gives a higher &quot;I&quot; and better system performance. A liquid rocket engine often employs regenerative cooling, which uses the fuel or less commonly the oxidizer to cool the chamber and nozzle.

==Ignition==
Ignition can be performed in many ways, but perhaps more so with liquid propellants than other rockets a consistent and significant ignitions source is required; a delay of ignition (in some cases as small as a few tens of milliseconds) can cause overpressure of the chamber due to excess propellant. A hard start can even cause an engine to explode.

Generally, ignition systems try to apply flames across the injector surface, with a mass flow of approximately 1% of the full mass flow of the chamber.

Safety interlocks are sometimes used to ensure the presence of an ignition source before the main valves open; however reliability of the interlocks can in some cases be lower than the ignition system. Thus it depends on whether the system must fail safe, or whether overall mission success is more important. Interlocks are rarely used for upper, uncrewed stages where failure of the interlock would cause loss of mission, but are present on the RS-25 engine, to shut the engines down prior to liftoff of the Space Shuttle. In addition, detection of successful ignition of the igniter is surprisingly difficult, some systems use thin wires that are cut by the flames, pressure sensors have also seen some use.

Methods of ignition include pyrotechnic, electrical (spark or hot wire), and chemical. Hypergolic propellants have the advantage of self igniting, reliably and with less chance of hard starts. In the 1940s, the Russians began to start engines with hypergols, to then switch over to the primary propellants after ignition. This was also used on the American F-1 rocket engine on the Apollo program.

Ignition with a pyrophoric agent: Triethylaluminium ignites on contact with air and will ignite and/or decompose on contact with water, and with any other oxidizer—it is one of the few substances sufficiently pyrophoric to ignite on contact with cryogenic liquid oxygen. The enthalpy of combustion, ΔcH°, is . Its easy ignition makes it particularly desirable as a rocket engine ignitor. May be used in conjunction with triethylborane to create triethylaluminum-triethylborane, better known as TEA-TEB.

==History==

===Russia–Soviet Union===
The idea of a liquid-fueled rocket as understood in the modern context first appeared in 1903 in the book &quot;Exploration of the Universe with Rocket-Propelled Vehicles&quot; by the Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. The magnitude of his contribution to astronautics is astounding, including the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, multi-staged rockets, and using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen in liquid propellant rockets. Tsiolkovsky influenced later rocket scientists throughout Europe, like Wernher von Braun. Soviet search teams at Peenemünde found a German translation of a book by Tsiolkovsky of which &quot;almost every page...was embellished by von Braun&#x27;s comments and notes.&quot; Leading Soviet rocket-engine designer Valentin Glushko and rocket designer Sergey Korolev studied Tsiolkovsky&#x27;s works as youths and both sought to turn Tsiolkovsky&#x27;s theories into reality. 

From 1929 to 1930 in Leningrad Glushko pursued rocket research at the Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL), where a new research section was set up for the study of liquid-propellant and electric rocket engines. This resulted in the creation of ORM (from &quot;Experimental Rocket Motor&quot; in Russian) engines to . A total of 100 bench tests of liquid-propellant rockets were conducted using various types of fuel, both low and high-boiling and thrust up to 300 kg was achieved.

During this period in Moscow, Fredrich Tsander – a scientist and inventor – was designing and building liquid rocket engines which ran on compressed air and gasoline. Tsander investigated high-energy fuels including powdered metals mixed with gasoline. In September 1931 Tsander formed the Moscow based &#x27;Group for the Study of Reactive Motion&#x27;, better known by its Russian acronym &quot;GIRD&quot;. In May 1932, Sergey Korolev replaced Tsander as the head of GIRD. On 17 August 1933, Mikhail Tikhonravov launched the first Soviet liquid-propelled rocket (the GIRD-9), fueled by liquid oxygen and jellied gasoline. It reached an altitude of . In January 1933 Tsander began development of the GIRD-X rocket. This design burned liquid oxygen and gasoline and was one of the first engines to be regeneratively cooled by the liquid oxygen, which flowed around the inner wall of the combustion chamber before entering it. Problems with burn-through during testing prompted a switch from gasoline to less energetic alcohol. The final missile, long by in diameter, had a mass of , and it was anticipated that it could carry a payload to an altitude of . The GIRD X rocket was launched on 25 November 1933 and flew to a height of 80 meters.

In 1933 GDL and GIRD merged and became the Reactive Scientific Research Institute (RNII). At RNII Gushko continued the development of liquid propellant rocket engines ОРМ-53 to ОРМ-102, with powering the RP-318 rocket-powered aircraft. In 1938 Leonid Dushkin replaced Glushko and continued development of the ORM engines, including the engine for the rocket powered interceptor, the Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1. At RNII Tikhonravov worked on developing oxygen/alcohol liquid-propellant rocket engines. Ultimately liquid propellant rocket engines were given a low priority during the late 1930s at RNII, however the research was productive and very important for later achievements of the Soviet rocket program.

===Peru===

Peruvian Pedro Paulet, who had experimented with rockets throughout his life in Peru, wrote a letter to &quot;El Comercio&quot; in Lima in 1927, claiming he had experimented with a liquid rocket engine while he was a student in Paris three decades earlier. Historians of early rocketry experiments, among them Max Valier, Willy Ley, and John D. Clark, have given differing amounts of credence to Paulet&#x27;s report. Valier applauded Paulet&#x27;s liquid-propelled rocket design in the Verein für Raumschiffahrt publication &quot;Die Rakete&quot;, saying the engine had &quot;amazing power&quot; and that his plans were necessary for future rocket development. Hermann Oberth would name Paulet as a pioneer in rocketry in 1965. Wernher von Braun would also describe Paulet as &quot;the pioneer of the liquid fuel propulsion motor&quot; and stated that &quot;Paulet helped man reach the Moon&quot;. Paulet was later approached by Nazi Germany, being invited to join the Astronomische Gesellschaft to help develop rocket technology, though he refused to assist after discovering that the project was destined for weaponization and never shared the formula for his propellant. According to filmmaker and researcher Álvaro Mejía, Frederick I. Ordway III would later attempt to discredit Paulet&#x27;s discoveries in the context of the Cold War and in an effort to shift the public image of von Braun away from his history with Nazi Germany.

===United States===
The first &quot;flight&quot; of a liquid-propellant rocket took place on March 16, 1926 at Auburn, Massachusetts, when American professor Dr. Robert H. Goddard launched a vehicle using liquid oxygen and gasoline as propellants. The rocket, which was dubbed &quot;Nell&quot;, rose just 41 feet during a 2.5-second flight that ended in a cabbage field, but it was an important demonstration that rockets using liquid propulsion were possible. Goddard proposed liquid propellants about fifteen years earlier and began to seriously experiment with them in 1921. The German-Romanian Hermann Oberth published a book in 1923 suggesting the use of liquid propellants.

===Germany===
In Germany, engineers and scientists became enthralled with liquid propulsion, building and testing them in the late 1920s within Opel RAK, the world&#x27;s first rocket program, in Rüsselsheim. According to Max Valier&#x27;s account, Opel RAK rocket designer, Friedrich Wilhelm Sander launched two liquid-fuel rockets at Opel Rennbahn in Rüsselsheim on April 10 and April 12, 1929. These Opel RAK rockets have been the first European, and after Goddard the world&#x27;s second, liquid-fuel rockets in history. In his book &quot;Raketenfahrt&quot; Valier describes the size of the rockets as of 21 cm in diameter and with a length of 74 cm, weighing 7 kg empty and 16 kg with fuel. The maximum thrust was 45 to 50 kp, with a total burning time of 132 seconds. These properties indicate a gas pressure pumping. The main purpose of these tests was to develop the liquid rocket-propulsion system for a Gebrüder-Müller-Griessheim aircraft under construction for a planned flight across the English channel. Also spaceflight historian Frank H. Winter, curator at National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC, confirms the Opel group was working, in addition to their solid-fuel rockets used for land-speed records and the world&#x27;s first crewed rocket-plane flights with the Opel RAK.1, on liquid-fuel rockets. By May 1929, the engine produced a thrust of 200 kg (440 lb.) &quot;for longer than fifteen minutes and in July 1929, the Opel RAK collaborators were able to attain powered phases of more than thirty minutes for thrusts of 300 kg (660-lb.) at Opel&#x27;s works in Rüsselsheim,&quot; again according to Max Valier&#x27;s account. The Great Depression brought an end to the Opel RAK activities. After working for the German military in the early 1930s, Sander was arrested by Gestapo in 1935, when private rocket-engineering became forbidden in Germany. He was convicted of treason to 5 years in prison and forced to sell his company, he died in 1938. Max Valier&#x27;s (via Arthur Rudolph and Heylandt), who died while experimenting in 1930, and Friedrich Sander&#x27;s work on liquid-fuel rockets was confiscated by the German military, the Heereswaffenamt and integrated into the activities under General Walter Dornberger in the early and mid-1930s in a field near Berlin. Max Valier was a co-founder of an amateur research group, the VfR, working on liquid rockets in the early 1930s, and many of whose members eventually became important rocket technology pioneers, including Wernher von Braun. Von Braun served as head of the army research station that designed the V-2 rocket weapon for the Nazis. 

By the late 1930s, use of rocket propulsion for crewed flight began to be seriously experimented with, as Germany&#x27;s Heinkel He 176 made the first crewed rocket-powered flight using a liquid rocket engine, designed by German aeronautics engineer Hellmuth Walter on June 20, 1939. The only production rocket-powered combat aircraft ever to see military service, the Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot; in 1944-45, also used a Walter-designed liquid rocket engine, the Walter HWK 109-509, which produced up to 1,700 kgf (16.7 kN) thrust at full power.

===Post World War II===
After World War II the American government and military finally seriously considered liquid-propellant rockets as weapons and began to fund work on them. The Soviet Union did likewise, and thus began the Space Race.

In 2010s 3D printed engines started being used for spaceflight. Examples of such engines include SuperDraco used in launch escape system of the SpaceX Dragon 2 and also engines used for first or second stages in launch vehicles from Astra, Orbex, Relativity Space, Skyrora, or Launcher.

<doc id="520403" wikidata="Q4940726" url="?curid=520403" title="Proposed bombing of Vietnam's dikes">
<text>During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff considered and rejected some additions to strategic bombing campaigns that would include targeting a series of dikes and dams along Vietnam&#x27;s Red River delta. A classified 1965 USAF report suggested that the Red River flood control system could probably not be destroyed by conventional aerial bombing.

In 1966, John McNaughton, Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, proposed the destruction of the Red River Valley dams and dikes in order to flood rice paddies, disrupt the North Vietnamese food supply, and leverage Hanoi during negotiations; then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, however, rejected the idea.

==Background==

The dike and dam system on the Red River had been expanded steadily since independence was declared and by 1972 consisted of nearly 2500 miles of dikes, levees, dams and sluices. Heavy monsoon rains coupled with the preoccupation of the civilian population that normally maintained the water works, led to extensive flooding in 1971. In an attempt to garner international opposition against the newest U.S. strategic bombing campaign, Rolling Thunder, the North Vietnamese Government began a propaganda campaign using images of the flood to allege that the U.S. had begun a strategic bombing campaign against the Red River dikes. Given the North Vietnamese tactic of forcing U.S. aircraft to jettison their bombloads and abort their missions, the dikes undoubtedly were their point of impact on occasion, as they may have been for some downed U.S. aircraft.

==Combatants==

===North Vietnam===

As the North Vietnamese called on the local population to maintain the military lines of communication, labor was drawn away from dike maintenance. The problem was exacerbated by the placement of air defense equipment (AA and GCI) on the dikes and the resulting deterioration caused by the vibration of the guns. North Vietnamese SAMs that missed their mark often fell back to earth before exploding, causing additional damage to the dikes. As the dikes deteriorated, however, the North Vietnamese sought a way to continue to fight the war and maintain the dikes. In order to extract a greater effort from their population, they turned the issue into one that would rally the people, alleging that the United States was bombing the dikes intentionally in order to flood the entire delta. Foreign visitors were provided tours of damaged dikes — photographic coverage indicates that most visitors were taken to the same &quot;damaged&quot; dike over a period of several years — to exploit the issue in the foreign press.

===United States===

President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger discussed bombing the dike network in a 1972 conversation on Operation Linebacker II, later published by Daniel Ellsberg:
Nixon: We&#x27;ve got to quit thinking in terms of a three-day strike [in the Hanoi-Haiphong area]. We&#x27;ve got to be thinking in terms of an all-out bombing attack - which will continue until they - Now by all-out bombing attack, I am thinking about things that go far beyond. I&#x27;m thinking of the dikes, I&#x27;m thinking of the railroad, I&#x27;m thinking, of course, the docks.
Kissinger: I agree with you.
President Nixon: We&#x27;ve got to use massive force.
&quot;Two hours later at noon, H. R. Haldeman and Ron Ziegler joined Kissinger and Nixon:&quot;&lt;br&gt;
President: How many did we kill in Laos?
Ziegler: Maybe ten thousand - fifteen?
Kissinger: In the Laotian thing, we killed about ten, fifteen.
President: See, the attack in the North that we have in mind, power plants, whatever&#x27;s left - POL [petroleum], the docks. And, I still think we ought to take the dikes out now. Will that drown people?
Kissinger: About two hundred thousand people.
President: No, no, no, I&#x27;d rather use the nuclear bomb. Have you got that, Henry?
Kissinger: That, I think, would just be too much.
President: The nuclear bomb, does that bother you?...I just want you to think big, Henry, for Christsakes.
U.S. investigation into the North Vietnamese claims revealed that U.S. bombing had caused minor damage to the dikes but none of the damaged structures were part of the system protecting Hanoi, and none of the damage was severe enough to cause a major breach. Further complicating matters was the North Vietnamese placement of anti-aircraft radars, surface to air missiles, and artillery atop dike structures. The dike system was also part of the North Vietnamese transportation network, with roads and rail lines in close proximity to the dikes. Although authorization was given during Operation Linebacker II to attack these sites, only the use of napalm, cluster bombs, and other antipersonnel weapons were permitted to be used in an attempt to minimize structural damage.

==International reaction==

The North Vietnamese used these incidents as part of their propaganda campaign. Actress Jane Fonda is often credited with helping publicize the bombing, for which then U.S. Ambassador to the UN George H. W. Bush accused her of lying. Columnist Joseph Kraft who was also touring North Vietnam, believed that the damage to the dikes was done in error and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi, and that if the U.S. Air Force were &quot;truly going after the dikes, it would do so in a methodical, not a harum-scarum way.&quot; Others, like Jean Thoraval of Agence France-Presse, reported personally witnessing a U.S. bombing raid where a dozen planes had dropped bombs and fired rockets on a nearby dike, concluding that &quot;the attack was aimed at a whole system of dikes.&quot; Sweden&#x27;s Ambassador to Hanoi, Jean-Christophe Öberg, along with two Swedish journalists, described the damage to the dikes as &quot;methodic.&quot;

An investigation into the bombing of the dikes carried out by a French geographer, Yves Lacoste, concluded that the bombing was based on a systematic policy to flood the eastern part of the delta. According to the investigation, the eastern part was targeted more than the western part which had more military targets (for instance, Hanoi). The investigation stated that the overwhelming majority of dike bombing also occurred on the concave sections of dike, the most vulnerable to such bombing and that the effects of the bombing were profound, as &#x27;minor damage&#x27; actually severely weakened the dike structure through sub-surface cracking, which increased vulnerability during periods of high discharge.

<doc id="520411" wikidata="Q44756" url="?curid=520411" title="Catamarca Province">
<text>Catamarca () is a province of Argentina, located in the northwest of the country. The province had a population of 429,556 as per the , and covers an area of 102,602 km2. Its literacy rate is 95.5%. Neighbouring provinces are (clockwise, from the north): Salta, Tucumán, Santiago del Estero, Córdoba, and La Rioja. To the west it borders the country of Chile.

The capital is San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca, usually shortened to Catamarca. Other important cities include Andalgalá, Tinogasta, and Belén.

==Geography==
Eighty percent of Catamarca&#x27;s territory of 102,602 square kilometers (2.7% of the country total), is covered by mountains, which can be grouped into four clearly differentiated systems: the Pampean sierras, in the east and center; the Narváez-Cerro Negro-Famatina system, in the west; the cordilleran-Catamarca area of transition, in the western extreme; the Puna, an elevated portion, in the northwest.

The scarce water resources in Catamarca&#x27;s arid and semi-arid climate zone determine the human settlement pattern. Agricultural activities are concentrated in pockets and valleys between the mountains. In the east the population is concentrated around a number of water courses, from which water is distributed by canals and irrigation ditches.

===Climate===
The province is located in the semi–arid region of Argentina. Mean annual precipitation of the province is around which decreases significantly to the west. The province is characterized by the presence of different microclimates based on variations in altitude. In general, there are three different climatic zones found within the province.

The northeastern parts of the province have a subtropical highland climate that is characterized by abundant rainfall and high temperatures. Summers are hot while winters are mild with abundant humidity. At the highest peaks of Sierra del Aconquija, snow cover is permanent.

Most of the province and its intermontane valleys have an arid climate. Within these valleys which includes the provincial capital, the climate is characterized by its extreme aridity, large thermal amplitudes (different between day and night temperatures) and strong northeastern winds. The region is characterized by abundant sunshine with winds predominantly coming from the northeast and southeast. Nonetheless, there is large variation between different locations owing to differences in altitude and differences in the relief and altitudes of the surrounding mountains that enclose the valleys. Mean annual precipitation ranges from in the eastern parts of the region (some areas receive more than ) to less than in the west. In the arid valleys, mean annual precipitation is around . Most of the precipitation occurs during summer, falling as short but heavy bursts with the rest of the year being dry. Mean annual temperatures range between with eastern and central parts having mean annual temperatures of . In summer, the mean temperature is although they can reach up to . Winters, with a mean temperature of are characterized by frequent frosts. Locations in the west experience colder winters due to their higher altitudes with temperatures that can decrease to . During winter, the Zonda wind occasionally occurs, leading to very dry conditions that can lead to dust storms.

In the extreme west of the province is the Puna region, mostly located in the Antofagasta de la Sierra Department. The region has a desert climate with very low precipitation; most of it is concentrated during summer. This is due to the mountains that block moist air from Pacific Ocean. Mean annual precipitation decreases from north to south and from east to west; some areas receive an annual rainfall of . Owing to its high altitude, the climate is characterized by low temperatures. The thermal amplitude is large, reaching up to due to the combination of low humidity and high solar radiation.

==History==

Before the arrival of the Spanish conquest, most of today&#x27;s Catamarca was inhabited by the Diaguitas indigenous people, including the fierce Calchaquí tribe. In 1558 Juan Pérez de Zurita founded &quot;San Juan de la Ribera de Londres&quot;, but since it was constantly under attack by indigenous people its population remained small; it was re-founded several times at new sites with new names. The sixth foundation was by Fernando de Mendoza Mate de Luna on July 5, 1683, with the name &quot;San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca&quot;.

When the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata was created in 1776, Catamarca obtained the title of &quot;Subintendencia&quot; under the Salta intendency. In 1821, the province claimed its autonomy, and Nicolás Avellaneda y Tula (grandfather of Nicolás Avellaneda) was elected as the first governor of the province.

The name is believed to come either from Quechua &#x27;slope&#x27; and &#x27;fortress&#x27;, or from Aymara &#x27;small&#x27; and &#x27;town&#x27;.

Catamarca remained isolated from the rest of Argentina by its mountains until 1888, when the rapidly expanding railways first appeared in the province. Attracting immigrants with its spacious, fertile valleys and dry, agreeable weather, Catamarca was soon favored by immigrants from Lebanon and Iran, who found Catamarca reminiscent of the fertile, orchard-lined mountain valleys of the homes they left behind.

One such family, the Saadis, became prominent in local commerce and politics (much as the Syrian Menems in neighbouring La Rioja). In 1949, the newly designated province elected Vicente Saadi as governor. Eventually, Saadi, a Peronist, would become indispensable to local politics (a &quot;Caudillo&quot;), exerting influence mostly by proxy. Upon his death in 1988, he was succeeded by his son Ramon. In 1990, however, close friends of the Saadis were involved in the brutal murder of a local teenager, ; this &quot;cause cèlebre&quot; cost Gov. Saadi much of his popularity and, in 1991, his office, when Catamarca (for the first time) voted in a Radical Civic Union (UCR) candidate, . Elected to the Senate by his still considerable following, Saadi is today an ally of President Cristina Kirchner, though the governor&#x27;s seat remains in the UCR&#x27;s column.

==Demography==
According to the 2022 Argentine national census, the Province of Catamarca has 429,556 inhabitants. Annual growth rate is 2.35‰, while density amounts to 2.6 inhabitants per square kilometer. Urban population represents 70%. (1991).

==Economy==
Catamarca&#x27;s economy is Argentina&#x27;s smallest, though still developed. Its 2006 economy was estimated at US$1.728 billion, or, US$5,284 per capita, 40% below the national average.
Less diversified than most in Argentina, agriculture has never played an important role in the Catamarca economy (contributing less than 5% to its output). The province&#x27;s livestock includes around 200,000 head of cattle, 100,000 sheep, and 150,000 goats, with an annual production of 7,000 tonnes of beef, 5 tonnes of mutton/lamb, and 10 tonnes of pork, although outbreaks of foot and mouth disease has kept at times the production from reaching full potential. Large numbers of cattle, fattened in the alfalfa fields of Pucara, Tinogasta and Copacabana, were historically driven into northern Chile across the San Francisco pass and mules were bred for the Bolivian market in the 1910s. 

Mining was important in the past. After becoming less active in the early 1990s, grew to now account for over 20% of the economy. Catamarca is home to one of the largest copper gold mines in the world, Bajo de la Alumbrera, which produces approximately 600,000 ounces of gold and 190,000 tonnes of copper annually. The mine employs over 1,000 people and contributes hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes and royalties to the federal and provincial governments.

The agriculture of Catamarca focuses on wood (walnut), vineyards, olive, citrus, cotton and tobacco, for which the government gives tax cuts to facilitate economic growth , but so far with poor results and no oversight. 
Tourism is a lesser contributor to the economy in Catamarca, with more than 3,465 beds in hotels and other types of accommodation. Although high hopes are focused in this industry, lack of infrastructure, service-oriented and trained businesses and an overall endemic corruption culture, tourism has yet to become a strong element the local economy. Mountains and geological formation are the main attraction, with sights such as Antofagasta de la Sierra, Balcones del Valle, the Snow-Covered Summits of Aconquija, and the San Francisco Pass. The road over the San Francisco Pass, an endeavor developed during the Castillo Administrations (1991–2003) at a high cost in public funds has failed to bring trade and tourism to the underdeveloped Tinogasta county. 
Cultural attractions include the city of Catamarca, the archaeological park &quot;Las Huellas del Inca&quot;, prehistoric petroglyphs, local music, handcrafts and wines.

==Transport==

Major highways include Ruta 33 from Catamarca 98 km south to San Martin, 38 from Catamarca north via San Pedro 228 km to Tucuman, 60 north-west from Córdoba Province 577 km from La Guardia north-west (partly through La Rioja) to Chile by the Paso de San Francisco (4722 m), 64 west from Santiago del Estero to join 38 and 157 north from La Guardia 103 km to Frias where it connects with 89 west from Villa San Martin (Santiago del Estero), and north to Tucuman province at San Pedro, connecting with 64 near Las Cañas.
There is an airport at Catamarca, the Coronel Felipe Varela International Airport.

==Government and politics==
The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court and completed by several inferior tribunals.

The Constitution of Catamarca Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Catamarca Provincial Police.

Since its foundation in 1991 by the Catamarcan branch of the Radical Civic Union and minor local parties the Civic and Social Front of Catamarca has dominated state politics. It has held the governor&#x27;s house in Catamarca, first with Arnoldo Castillo (1991–1999), then with his son Oscar Castillo (1999–2003), and now with the present governor, Eduardo Brizuela del Moral.

<text>David Schulthise (September 16, 1956 – March 10, 2004), also known as Dave Blood, was an American musician best known as the original bass guitarist for the punk band The Dead Milkmen. Schulthise was born in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. He helped form the band in 1983 along with fellow pseudonymous musicians Joe Jack Talcum, Dean Clean, and Rodney Anonymous. Prior to this he was a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Purdue University.

He stopped playing music in 1995 after the band broke up as the result of developing tendinitis in both hands.

Schulthise visited Yugoslavia while on tour with the Milkmen and became fascinated with Serbia, its culture and people. After the band disbanded, he enrolled at Indiana University to study Serbo-Croatian language, literature, and history. He moved to Serbia for work and study in 1998, but in the wake of the NATO bombing campaign there he was forced to return to the US.

In late 2003, he told an interviewer that his favorite bassists were Mike Mills (R.E.M.), Johnny Gayden (Albert Collins Band) and Charles Mingus.

Schulthise died by suicide from a drug overdose on March 10, 2004, at age 47.

<text>Alexander Petrovich Karpinsky (, trl. Aljeksandr Pjetrovič Karpinskij; 7 January 1847 O.S. 26 December 1846] – 15 July 1936) was a prominent Russian and Soviet geologist and mineralogist, and the president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and later Academy of Sciences of the USSR, in 1917–1936.

==Biography==
Karpinsky was born in Turyinskiye Rudniki, Perm Governorate (now Krasnoturyinsk, Sverdlovsk Oblast), in the Ural Mountains, into a family of mining engineers. From 1857 to 1866 he studied at the mining school in St. Petersburg, and in 1863-1866 he also attended the Mineralogical Institute. From 1866 to 1869 he worked in his home area in the Urals as a mining engineer.

He was invited to the Mining Institute, St. Petersburg in 1869 as an Assistant Professor, whilst also doing further studies and research. He was given full professorship in 1877. He stayed there until 1885. He was the imperial director of mining research from 1885 to 1916. Karpinsky was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1886, was elected its president in May 1917, and held this title until his death. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1897. His main research was chiefly done in the Ural Mountains, and he completed the first geological map of European Russia. He was able to preserve much scientific equipment and many invaluable records during the turmoil, and looting, of the Russian Revolution.

Karpinsky died on 15 July 1936 in Moscow, at the age of 89 and was cremated and an urn with his ashes lies in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow, and is the oldest (by the date of birth) person to be so.

<doc id="520421" wikidata="Q7765964" url="?curid=520421" title="The Spitting Image">
<text>The Spitting Image: Myth, Memory and the Legacy of Vietnam is a 1998 book by Vietnam veteran and sociology professor Jerry Lembcke. The book is an analysis of the widely believed narrative that American soldiers were spat upon and insulted by anti-war protesters upon returning home from the Vietnam War. The book examines the origin of the earliest stories; the popularization of the &quot;spat-upon image&quot; through Hollywood films and other media, and the role of print news media in perpetuating the now iconic image through which the history of the war and anti-war movement has come to be represented.

Lembcke contrasts the absence of credible evidence of spitting by anti-war activists with the large body of evidence showing a mutually supportive, empathetic relationship between veterans and anti-war forces. The book also documents efforts of the Nixon Administration to drive a wedge between military service members and the anti-war movement by portraying democratic dissent as a betrayal of the troops. Lembcke equates this disparagement of the anti-war movement and veterans with the similar stab-in-the-back myth propagated by Germany and France after their war defeats, as an alibi for why they lost the war. Lembcke details the resurrection of the myth of the spat-upon veteran during subsequent Gulf War efforts as a way to silence public dissent.

==Origins==
A persistent but unfounded criticism leveled against those who protested in opposition to the Vietnam War is that they spat upon and otherwise derided returning soldiers, calling them &quot;baby-killers&quot;. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, years after the Vietnam War ended, the proliferation of these spitting stories increased greatly. As both a Vietnam veteran and a member of the anti-war movement, Lembcke knew this criticism ran counter to what he personally experienced and witnessed. To the contrary, one of the hallmarks of the period&#x27;s anti-war movement was its support for the troops in the field and the affiliation of many returning veterans with the movement. Lembcke was motivated to look further into the truth and origins of this spat-upon veteran myth, and the contradiction between historical fact and popular collective memory. Other observers had already noticed the proliferation of stories and questioned whether the spitting stories even made sense. In 1987, columnist Bob Greene noted:

Even during the most fervent days of anti-war protest, it seemed that it was not the soldiers whom protesters were maligning. It was the leaders of government, and the top generals—at least, that is how it seemed in memory. One of the most popular chants during the anti-war marches was, &quot;Stop the war in Vietnam, bring the boys home.&quot; You heard that at every peace rally in America. &quot;Bring the boys home.&quot; That was the message. Also, when one thought realistically about the image of what was supposed to have happened, it seemed questionable. So-called &quot;hippies,&quot; no matter what else one may have felt about them, were not the most macho people in the world. Picture a burly member of the Green Berets, in full uniform, walking through an airport. Now think of a &quot;hippie&quot; crossing his path. Would the hippie have the nerve to spit on the soldier? And if the hippie did, would the soldier—fresh from facing enemy troops in the jungles of Vietnam—just stand there and take it?

By 1992, the Director of the Connelly Library and curator of the Vietnam War Collection at LaSalle University listed the spitting myth as one of the &quot;Top Six Myths&quot; from the Vietnam era, and observed the myth &quot;derives from the mythopoeic belief that returning GIs were routinely spat upon at some time during their repatriation to the USA. This particular round of tales has become so commonplace as to be treated reverently even among otherwise wisely observant veterans.&quot; In 1994, scholar Paul Rogat Loeb wrote, &quot;to consider spitting on soldiers as even remotely representative of the activist response is to validate a lie&quot;, and noted that myths like that of anti-war activists spitting on soldiers have rewritten or &quot;erased history&quot;. An academic study into the making and shaping of a collective memory found that evidence of antiwar activists targeting troops was virtually nonexistent. Instead, it found popular memory was manipulated by national security elites and a complicit news media by frequently labeling resistors to U.S. war efforts as &quot;anti-troop&quot;. As observed by Clarence Page after interviewing Lembcke and Greene, &quot;the stories have become so widely believed, despite a remarkable lack of witnesses or evidence, that ironically the burden of proof now falls on the accused, the protesters; not their accusers, the veterans. Antiwar protesters must prove the episodes didn&#x27;t happen, instead of the veterans having to prove they did.&quot;

Given this complete lack of evidence that spitting occurred, but acknowledging that it is impossible to prove something never happened, Lembcke set out:

to show how it is possible for a large number of people to believe that Vietnam veterans were spat upon when there is no evidence that they were. In effect, my strategy was to set aside the question of whether or not such acts occurred and to show why even if they did not occur it is understandable that the image of the spat-upon veteran has become widely accepted. Indeed, given the manipulation of information and images that began with the Nixon administration and continued at the hands of filmmakers and the news media during the 1970s and 1980s, it would be remarkable if a majority of Americans had not come to believe that Vietnam veterans were abused by the anti-war movement.

==Synopsis==
At the time he wrote &quot;The Spitting Image&quot;, Lembcke had not found a single substantiated media report to support the now common claims of spitting. He theorizes that the reported &quot;spitting on soldiers&quot; scenario was a mythical projection by those who felt &quot;spat upon&quot; by an American society tired of the war; an image which was then used to discredit future anti-war activism and serve political interests. He suggests that the manufactured images of pro-war antipathy against anti-war protesters also helped contribute to the myth. Lembcke asserts that memories of being verbally and physically assaulted by anti-war protesters were largely conjured, noting that not even one case could be reliably documented. He further suggests the &quot;baby-killer&quot; and &quot;murderer&quot; components of the myth may have been reinforced, in part, by the common chants by protesters aimed at President Lyndon Baines Johnson, like &quot;Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?&quot;

&quot;The Spitting Image&quot; asserts that the image of abuse of soldiers by anti-war demonstrators only really became ingrained in the American consciousness years after the war had come to a close. Lembcke attributes part of the legend&#x27;s growth to films relating to Vietnam, notably &quot;First Blood&quot;, in which a &quot;spat-upon veteran&quot; image is popularized. He writes that the myth of the spat-upon veteran was later revived by President George H. W. Bush as a way to help suppress dissent when selling the Gulf War to the American people. Lembcke believes that resurrection of the myth was useful in promoting the yellow ribbon &quot;Support our Troops&quot; campaign, as it implies that for one to support the troops, one must also support the war. It conflates the ideas of anti-war sentiment and anti-troop sentiment, despite a common anti-war chant being &quot;Support the Troops: Bring them Home!&quot;

The &quot;spat-upon veteran&quot; meme became so pervasive that some found it hard not to believe. In 1989, Bob Greene&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; reprinted letters he had solicited, asking to hear from veterans if they had been spat upon. Greene&#x27;s book includes 63 alleged accounts involving spitting, and 69 accounts from veterans who do not believe anyone was spat upon after returning from Vietnam, among other stories. Greene admits he couldn&#x27;t validate the authenticity of the accounts in the letters he received, but he did believe spitting must have occurred, stating, &quot;There were simply too many letters, going into too fine a detail, to deny the fact.&quot; Greene concluded, &quot;I think you will agree, after reading the letters, that even if several should prove to be not what they appear to be, that does not detract from the overall story that is being told.&quot; &quot;Greene was too willing to suspend disbelief&quot;, says Lembcke, who cited Greene&#x27;s book as an example of how prolific the stories had become and also for the patterns that appeared in them. Lembke said, &quot;These stories have to be taken very seriously, but as historical evidence they are problematic. In the first place, stories of this type didn&#x27;t surface until about ten years after the end of the war. If the incidents occurred when the story tellers say they did, in the closing years of the war, why is there no evidence for that? Moreover, many of the stories have elements of such exaggeration that one has to question the veracity of the entire account.&quot;

Lembcke points out that there were several newspaper accounts of pro-war demonstrators spitting on anti-war demonstrators and suggests that these oral accounts could easily have been reinterpreted and inverted and made into stories about activists spitting on veterans. He highlights the contradictions between the collective memory of today and contemporaneous historical records, like the results from a 1971 poll showing over 94% of returning Vietnam soldiers received a &quot;friendly&quot; welcome. Lembcke also notes how it was older vets from previous wars who most often scorned the returning Vietnam Vets; in 1978 the Vietnam Veterans of America vowed in its founding principle: &quot;Never again will one generation of veterans abandon another&quot;.

In &quot;The Spitting Image&quot;, Lembcke acknowledges that he cannot prove the negative—that no Vietnam veteran was ever spat on—saying it is hard to imagine there not being expressions of hostility between veterans and activists. &quot;I cannot, of course, prove to anyone&#x27;s satisfaction that spitting incidents like these did not happen. Indeed, it seems likely to me that it probably did happen to some veteran, some time, some place. But while I cannot prove the negative, I can prove the positive: I can show what did happen during those years and that that historical record makes it highly unlikely that the alleged acts of spitting occurred in the number and manner that is now widely believed.&quot;

==Reception and influence==
===Reviews===
A review published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reads: &quot;The image is ingrained: A Vietnam veteran, arriving home from the war, gets off a plane only to be greeted by an angry mob of antiwar protesters yelling, &#x27;Murderer!&#x27; and &#x27;Baby killer!&#x27; Then out of the crowd comes someone who spits in the veteran&#x27;s face. The only problem, according to Jerry Lembcke, is that no such incident has ever been documented. It is instead, says Lembcke, a kind of urban myth that reflects our lingering national confusion over the war.&quot;

A review published in &quot;The Berkshire Eagle&quot; called the book &quot;Well-argued and documented.&quot; Maurice Isserman of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;The myth of the spat-upon veteran is not only bad history, but it has been instrumental in selling the American public on bad policy.&quot; A review published in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; argued that &quot;Lembcke builds a compelling case against collective memory by demonstrating that remembrances of Vietnam were almost at direct odds with circumstantial evidence.&quot; Peace activist David Dellinger referred to the book as the &quot;best history I have seen on the impact of the war on Americans, both then and now.&quot;

Karl Helicher of &quot;Library Journal&quot; wrote that Lembcke &quot;presents a stunning indictment of this myth, an illusion created, he maintains, by the Nixon-Agnew administration and an unwitting press to attribute America&#x27;s loss in Vietnam to internal dissension. In fact, the antiwar movement and many veterans were closely aligned, and the only documented incidents show members of the VFW and American Legion spitting on their less successful Vietnam peers. But Lembcke&#x27;s most controversial conclusion is that posttraumatic stress disorder was as much a political creation—a means of discrediting returning vets who protested the war as unhinged—as it was a medical condition. The image of the psycho-vet was furthered through such Hollywood productions as &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; and &quot;Coming Home&quot;. This forceful investigation challenges the reader to reexamine assumptions about the dark side of American culture that glorifies war more than peace. Highly recommended for large public libraries and for all academic peace studies collections.&quot;

Christian G. Appy of &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; wrote that &quot;Lembcke&#x27;s debunking of the spitting stories is quite persuasive. But he has much broader aims. Not only was there no spitting, he argues, but there was no hostility or tension at all between veterans and protesters. In fact, he characterizes their relationship as &#x27;empathetic and mutually supporting.&#x27; ... My own view is that the spitting stories are largely mythic, but that the myth itself reflects the deep anger and animosity that many veterans harbored toward the antiwar movement. Their anger often reflected a sense of class injustice that gave their more privileged peers greater freedom to avoid the war. ... I base my conclusions on extensive interviews I have conducted with Vietnam veterans since the early 1980s. Lembcke, however, gives no credence to the possibility that veterans themselves played a role in creating the myth of antiwar spitters, or that the myth teaches us anything meaningful about the class and wartime experiences of veterans. For him, the myth is almost entirely a product of Hollywood and right-wing politicians.&quot;

Mary Carroll of &quot;Booklist&quot; wrote that Lembcke &quot;makes a strong case that tales of antiwar activists spitting at returning vets are myth. ... He notes that contemporary media, government, and polling data show no evidence of antiwar spitting incidents; the few events reported had supporters of the war targeting opponents. But later studies reported hostility toward veterans; &quot;the spitting image&quot; epitomized that narrative. Similar images were common in post-World War I Germany and France after Indochina; Lembcke suggests the Nixon administration cultivated this notion of betrayal because it stigmatized both the antiwar movement and veterans against the war.&quot;

===Online debate and investigation===
In 2000, 2004, and again in 2007, journalist Jack Shafer rekindled firestorms when he berated news media outlets for uncritically repeating the myth of the spat-upon veteran. Shafer&#x27;s &quot;Slate Magazine&quot; online articles on the matter, which frequently cited Lembcke&#x27;s research, generated enormous feedback; the May 2000 article alone received nearly 300 postings on the subject in just a few days, one of its largest-ever responses.

According to Shafer, the myth persists primarily because:

# &quot;Those who didn&#x27;t go to Vietnam—that being most of us—don&#x27;t dare contradict the &#x27;experience&#x27; of those who did;
# The story helps maintain the perfect sense of shame many of us feel about the way we ignored our Vietvets;
# The press keeps the story in play by uncritically repeating it, as the Times and U.S. News did;
# Because any fool with 33 cents and the gumption to repeat the myth in his letter to the editor can keep it in circulation. Most recent mentions of the spitting protester in Nexis are of this variety.&quot;

Shafer acknowledges that it&#x27;s possible that a Vietnam veteran somewhere might have been spat upon during the war years, and notes that Lembcke concedes as much because nobody can prove something never happened. Shafer announced a challenge to his readers, &quot;Indeed, each time I write about the spit myth, my inbox overflows with e-mail from readers who claim that a spitting protester targeted them while they were in uniform. ... If you can point me to a documented case of a returning Viet vet getting spat upon, please drop a line.&quot;

Likewise, Lembcke joined the discussion and also commented on it in the &quot;Humanity &amp; Society&quot; journal, saying the stories just keep getting better, and asking for any evidence to be raised. The discussions spawned yet another round of more than 60 stories, yet only one was credible.

Northwestern Law School professor James Lindgren also joined the discussions and, after a review of contemporary news sources, found many news accounts from the 1960s and 1970s that discussed spitting incidents against servicemembers, contrary to Lembcke&#x27;s claims that stories about spitting only began occurring in 1980. Lembcke provided an 18-point response to Lindgren&#x27;s research, offering rebuttals to most of his claims and expressing interest in one of them. A December 27, 1971 &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; report on veteran Delmar Pickett who said he was spat at in Seattle appeared, according to Lembcke, to have some validity as a claim.

Some second-hand news accounts that mention spitting do actually exist, although there has been no evidence to support the narrative that anti-war demonstrators were responsible. Documented accounts exist where the anti-war demonstrators were actually the victims, not the perpetrators. Other commentators have since addressed the myth to various degrees, even referencing the debate spawned by the Slate files.

In his 2009 book &quot;War Stories&quot;, historian and Vietnam veteran Gary Kulik devoted a whole chapter to the myth of &quot;Spit-upon veterans&quot;. He closely examined Greene&#x27;s book of letters and the Slate files, as well as the research by Lindgren and Lembcke. Kulik noted the contradictory nature of the stories in Greene&#x27;s book and concluded that Greene arrogantly dismissed the &quot;surprising number&quot; of veterans who &quot;refuse to believe&quot; the spitting stories, and wrote, &quot;Greene was not just credulous, but negligently irresponsible.&quot; Kulik also criticized Lindgren&#x27;s research, writing, &quot;Lindgren&#x27;s evidence includes only one single first-person (&quot;I was spit upon&quot;) account—the stories that are at the heart of Lembcke&#x27;s book—and it appears the none of the accounts he cites were actually witnessed by a reporter. Moreover, Lindgren does not cite a single case of a Vietnam veteran spit upon as he returned home, and that was the story that would ultimately be repeated and believed.&quot; Kulik concluded that the spitting stories were formulaic and unbelievable, and were propagated to serve the political goals of those who wished to vilify the anti-war movement. &quot;The image of &#x27;hippie&#x27; men and women hawking up gobs of phlegm to hurl at the ribbons of veterans, as a pervasive and commonplace act, is surely false.&quot;
Specialist in civil-military relations and advisor to the National Institute of Military Justice, Diane Mazur, also examined the works by Greene, Lembcke and Lindgren, and concluded: &quot;There is no contemporaneous evidence that Americans who opposed the war expressed those beliefs by spitting on or otherwise assaulting returning Vietnam Veterans. ... The idea, however, that spitting on or mistreating Vietnam veterans was in any way typical or representative of anything in that era is completely false. ... It is by far the most powerful Vietnam War meme—a cultural unit of information passed from one person to another, like a biological gene—because it can be deployed instantly to silence difficult but necessary conversations about the military. For that reason alone the conventional wisdom is important, because it explains much about our civil-military dynamic today. It is also important, however, to understand why that accepted memory is untrue, and who benefits most from keeping it alive. The myth of the spat-upon Vietnam veteran is a difficult one to challenge. ... One intrepid soul, Professor Jerry Lembcke, ... stepped into the fray ... Every time he discusses his findings in a public forum, a hail of angry responses follows, but his explanations and conclusions are compelling and unsettling.&quot;

<doc id="520434" wikidata="Q7140345" url="?curid=520434" title="Parti national populaire">
<text>The Parti national populaire (; PNP; ) was a minor political party in Quebec, Canada that operated in the 1970s.

The PNP was created by a split in the Ralliement créditiste du Québec after Fabien Roy was expelled from the party. Roy was one of the two &quot;créditiste&quot; Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) that were elected in the 1973 Quebec general election.

On December 14, 1975, Roy teamed up with former Liberal minister Jérôme Choquette to form the Parti national populaire under Choquette&#x27;s leadership. In August 1976, the PNP and the conservative Union Nationale party, led by Rodrigue Biron, announced the merger of their two parties, but the idea was abandoned by the Union Nationale one month later.

In the November 15, 1976 general elections, Fabien Roy was the only PNP candidate elected, while Choquette was defeated, placing third in his riding with 14.2% of the vote, behind the Liberal and Parti Québécois candidates. Choquette resigned as party leader on March 29, 1977, and was succeeded by Roy.

Roy was appointed leader of the federal Social Credit Party of Canada on March 30, 1979, and resigned his National Assembly seat on April 5, 1979.

The PNP ceased its activities in 1980, and its status as an authorized political party was revoked by the Director-General of Elections for Québec on 31 December 1983.

==Proposed merger with Union Nationale==

On August 3, 1976, the UN leader in the National Assembly, Maurice Bellemare, leaked to the media that the UN and the PNP had been holding secret negotiations for several weeks to create a single regrouping of conservative, federalist forces. The negotiations were aimed at developing a new name, policy, party structures and financing. Bellemare had suggested &quot;Union Nationale Populaire&quot;. Bellemare told reporters that Jérôme Choquette would serve as parliamentary leader of the new party, and UN party leader Rodrigue Biron would serve as party leader.

Choquette&#x27;s PNP movement had failed to catch on, and Biron&#x27;s leadership of the UN had not been successful. Choquette was described by the Montreal Gazette as a “leader without a party”, while the UN was described as “a party without a leader”.

The next day, the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; reported that Choquette would be named “interim leader”, responsible for developing the new party&#x27;s policy and program, while Biron would be responsible for administrative and organizational issues. Officially, the two leaders would be considered equals, and each would continue to lead his own party until the new party&#x27;s leadership convention, scheduled for October 1976, but it had become clear that Choquette had the support of Bellemare. Choquette was described as Quebec&#x27;s third most popular political leader in a &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; editorial Bellemare was the UN&#x27;s sole Member of the National Assembly. The party&#x27;s $750,000 election fund was controlled by Mario Beaulieu, a Bellemare loyalist. Bellemare was seen as using Choquette to push Biron out of the UN leadership without getting blood on his own hands.

A dispute between Biron and Choquette emerged quickly. Biron favoured eliminating Bill 22, the language law that established French as the sole official language of Quebec, and required that children whose parents were not educated in English be educated in French. Choquette, on the other hand, had quit the Liberal Cabinet because he wanted stricter enforcement of the education rules. The dispute erupted, however, when Choquette changed his position, and spoke out in favour of allowing parents to have the choice of language of instruction, saying that it would be impossible to regulate parents’ choices. Biron, who favoured applying the rule only to non-Anglophone immigrants, said that Choquette “went too far” and that he would seek a revision to Choquette&#x27;s statement. Biron went further, and stated that as he had been elected leader of the UN “with a great majority”, he would continue in that role into the election and past it and that the new party would be called the Union Nationale, indicating that the PNP would be absorbed by the UN, rather than a merger creating a new party.

The merger attempt was called off in September 1976.

==1976 election==

The 1976 election caught the PNP by surprise, and it lacked local organization, money and a platform. The party quickly assembled a mainstream platform by drawing heavily from those of other parties, especially the Union Nationale. Choquette presented the party as being a liberal party: “The present government has forgotten the principles of liberalism for which it stands. The new party that I represent becomes the true liberal party, not in name, but in deeds.”

Of the PNP&#x27;s candidates, only two won more than 1,000 votes: Fabien Roy who was re-elected with 17,600 (69% of the total) in Beauce-Sud, and Choquette, who won only 3,726 votes (14% of the total) in his former riding of Outremont.

<text>The Parti crédit social uni (, PCSU; English: United Social Credit Party) was a provincial political party in the Canadian province of Quebec. It existed on two occasions, from 1969 to around 1971 and from 1979 to 1994. The party&#x27;s leader in both periods was Jean-Paul Poulin. The PCSU was not formally aligned with the Social Credit Party of Canada.

==First period, 1969–71==
The Parti crédit social uni emerged via a split in the Quebec social credit movement. Its origins appear to be in the Ralliement national (RN), a social credit and Quebec nationalist party that contested the 1966 provincial election without the approval of Ralliement des créditistes leader Réal Caouette. The RN merged into the Parti Québécois in 1968; the group that became the PCSU appears not to have approved of this decision.

Caouette&#x27;s party fielded candidates at the provincial level for the first time in 1969. A group of dissidents opposed this decision and founded the PCSU as a rival group, citing a lack of confidence in Caouette&#x27;s leadership. Poulin was chosen as the PCSU&#x27;s leader; he had previously been a RN candidate in the 1966 provincial election and a &quot;Créditiste&quot; candidate in the 1968 Canadian federal election. During this time, he indicated his support for a &quot;strong Quebec in a united Canada.&quot; 

The PCSU ran candidates in three 1969 by-elections, in the 1970 provincial elections, and in further by-elections in 1971. None were elected. The party was not registered with the provincial government, and its candidates appeared on the ballot without affiliation.

The party seems to have disappeared after 1971. Poulin joined the re-united Social Credit Party of Canada under Caouette&#x27;s leadership and was a party candidate in the 1974 federal election.

==Second period, 1979–1994==

The provincial Ralliement créditiste du Québec, which was aligned with the federal party, dissolved itself in 1978. The PCSU was subsequently re-established, again under Poulin&#x27;s leadership; it was accredited as a provincial political party for the first time on September 13, 1979. The PCSU nominated candidates in the 1981 election, 1985 election, and 1989 election, each time winning less than 0.1% of the popular vote. The last time it fielded a candidate was in a by-election in Anjou held on January 20, 1992. The party was deregistered on August 27, 1994, by the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec.

During the 1981 provincial election, the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; described the PCSU as a &quot;hard core&quot; Créditiste faction and identified Poulin as a follower of Major C.H. Douglas&#x27;s economic theories. When interviewed by the &quot;Gazette&quot;, Poulin held up a copy of his party&#x27;s manifesto and said, &quot;This was written in 1966 and I haven&#x27;t had to change a word.&quot;

<text>Corrientes (, ‘currents’ or ‘streams’; ), officially the Province of Corrientes (; ) is a province in northeast Argentina, in the Mesopotamia region. It is surrounded by (from the north, clockwise): Paraguay, the province of Misiones, Brazil, Uruguay, and the provinces of Entre Rios, Santa Fe and Chaco.

==History==

Before the arrival of the Spanish conquest, the Kaingang, Charrua and Guaraní lived in a big area that also covered most of the current province of Corrientes. The city of Corrientes was founded on 3 April 1588 by Juan Torres de Vera y Aragón as a mid-stop between Asunción and Buenos Aires; the city flourished thanks to the traffic from the route. Jesuits erected missions in the north of the province, where they dedicated themselves to the expansion of the faith.
In the wars of independence from Spain, Corrientes joined Artigas&#x27; &quot;Liga de los Pueblos Libres&quot; (1814–1820). The attack of Paraguayan forces on the province in 1865 marked the start of the War of the Triple Alliance.

In 1919 the National University of the Littoral was founded, which in 1956 became the National University of the Northeast.
Corrientes is legendary in the world of philately for the postage stamps it issued from 1856 to 1880. These are among the very early or &quot;classic&quot; postage stamps of the world (the first, from Great Britain, were issued in 1840; those by the United States in 1847). The Corrientes stamps were close copies of the first issue of stamps from France, which depicted the profile head of Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture, and were individually crudely engraved by hand, so that each die is noticeably different, and were printed in small sheets. The first issues, from 1856 to 1860, bore the denomination in the lower panel; in 1860, the value panel was erased; the different denominations thereafter being indicated by the color of the paper used. As locally produced &quot;primitives&quot;, the early Corrientes stamps have long been prized by collectors. After 1880, stamps of Argentina were used.

For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, politics in Corrientes were dominated by the Romero Feris family, prominent local landowners who still control most of the province&#x27;s tobacco output. During most of this time, the Romero Ferises created one of Argentina&#x27;s most bloated government payrolls (over 10% of total employment) and suppressed dissent and efforts at even modest land reform. Following contentious election results in 1991, however, public protest forced President Carlos Menem to remove Governor Raúl &quot;Tato&quot; Romero Feris from office and, though he was elected mayor of the province&#x27;s capital in 1997, Romero Feris was ultimately indicted for embezzlement of public funds in 1999. He was sentenced to seven years in prison in May 2002. 
Corrientes had a significant impact in national politics in subsequent years. A UCR-led alliance defeated the Romero Feris machine in the 2001 governor&#x27;s race, but the Corrientes UCR&#x27;s continued support for President Néstor Kirchner led to a rebuke from the national committee of the UCR itself, and this triggered a revolt from the Corrientes chapter of the party, as well as a number of others&#x27; (notably in Mendoza Province). These differences led to the appearance that year of UCR governors and other lawmakers allied to President Kirchner.

The northeastern tip of Corrientes Province was chosen as the site for Yacyretá Dam following an agreement between President Juan Perón and Paraguayan President Alfredo Stroessner in 1974. Yacyretá, whose 20-year-long construction and US$11 billion cost far exceeded initial estimates, is one of the largest hydroelectric dams in the world. Currently, an agreement is being pursued with Paraguay which would allow reservoir expansion works that could double the facility&#x27;s current installed electric capacity of 4,050 MW.

==Culture==

Culture in Corrientes has been primarily informed and influenced by its European and Guarani roots; an example of this is the chamamé genre of music.

Famous &quot;correntinos&quot; were independence hero General Don José de San Martín (born in 1778 in Yapeyú) and Juan Bautista Cabral (born in Saladas), who (according to popular legend) died for the general in the Battle of San Lorenzo.

Tourist destinations in the Corrientes Province include the Iberá Wetlands and the Mburucuyá National Park.

===Official languages===
On 22 October 2004, Provincial Law No. 5598 (Decree 2326/2004) declared Guaraní to be an official language of Corrientes, alongside Spanish. It was the first Argentine province to officialize a language other than Spanish, followed in 2010 by Chaco.

==Geography==
Corrientes is surrounded by two rivers – the Uruguay River to the east, and the Paraná River to the northwest – that contour the shape of the province. The low shore of the Paraná produces frequent floodings. After a specially destructive one in 1982, a protective system has been started with the construction of barriers.

The province is for the most part a plain, with the highest points in the east. To the west, a series of descending platforms go down to the Paraná River. The Iberá Wetlands, an area of lagoons and swamps, is a vast depression from volcanic flow, covered later with fluvial and eolic sediments.

===Climate===
The climate is predominantly subtropical with no dry season. The mean annual temperature is with monthly mean temperatures ranging from in July to in January. Temperatures are hot for most of the year while precipitation is abundant and evenly distributed throughout the year. There are four seasons: winter, spring, summer, and autumn. Winters are short although occasional incursions of cold, polar air from the south can produce frosts. In contrast, temperatures during summer can reach to . Mean annual precipitation ranges from which decreases from northeast to southwest. Autumn is the rainiest season while winter is the driest.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2022 Argentine national census, the Province of Corrientes has 1,197,553 inhabitants.

== Economy ==
Corrientes, like much of the Argentine north, has long had a relatively underdeveloped economy. Its 2006 output was estimated at US$4.2 billion (which shall be around US$6.7 billion in 2011, according to Argentina&#x27;s economic growth), or, US$4,540 per capita (around US$6,600 in 2011), nearly 40% below the national average.

Agriculture is still one of the main activities in the province, adding 15% to its output. It is centred in citrus, tobacco, rice, tea, cotton and yerba mate, exported internationally. The timber industry uses 1,400 km2 of pine and eucalyptus forests.

Bovine cattle has problems standing the heat and the low quality of the grass specially in the north of the province. For that reason, the Brangus breed is the most common in the area. In the south, different breeds can be found. 70,000 km2 of the province&#x27;s land are used for more than 4 million heads of cattle.

Among Corrientes&#x27; productive (non-services) activities, tobacco and its processing earns 45% of the province&#x27;s gross income, food and derivates, 30%, and textiles, 16%.

On the Paraná River, near the city of Ituzaingó, the Yaciretá dam provides energy not only to the province, but to both Argentina and Paraguay.

Tourism has been growing in Corrientes Province due to the relevance that Esteros del Ibera has for ecotourism and birdwatching travelers. Iberá National Park was created in 2018. Golden dorado fishing has long attracted both local and outside tourism to Corrientes.

==Political division==
The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court. The legislative branch is a bicameral body composed of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Legislature is charged with introducing and passing local laws. 

The Constitution of Corrientes Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Corrientes Provincial Police.
The province is divided into 25 departments (&quot;departamentos&quot;):

<doc id="520442" wikidata="Q1072385" url="?curid=520442" title="Nichrome">
<text>Nichrome (also known as NiCr, nickel-chromium or chromium-nickel) is a family of alloys of nickel and chromium (and occasionally iron) commonly used as resistance wire, heating elements in devices like toasters, electrical kettles and space heaters, in some dental restorations (fillings) and in a few other applications.

Patented in 1906 by Albert Marsh (US patent 811,859), nichrome is the oldest documented form of resistance heating alloy.

The A Grade nichrome alloy is 80% nickel and 20% chromium by mass, but there are many other combinations of metals for various applications.

== Properties ==

C Grade Nichrome is consistently silvery in color, is corrosion-resistant, has a high melting point of approximately , and has an electrical resistivity of around 1.12 μΩ·m, which is around 66 times higher resistivity than copper of 16.78 nΩ·m. Some nichrome formulations have a resistivity as low as 1.0 μΩ·m or as high as 1.5 μΩ·m.

Almost any conductive wire can be used for heating, but most metals conduct electricity with great efficiency, requiring them to be formed into very thin and delicate wires to create enough resistance to generate heat. When heated in air, most metals then oxidize quickly, become brittle and break. Nichrome wire, when heated to red-hot temperatures, develops an outer layer of chromium oxide, which is thermodynamically stable in air, is mostly impervious to oxygen, and protects the heating element from further oxidation.

Nichrome alloys are known for their high mechanical strength and their high creep strength. The properties of nichrome vary depending on its alloy. Figures given are representative of typical material and are accurate to expressed significant figures. Any variations are due to different percentages of nickel or chromium.

=== Standard compositions ===
Nichrome alloys for use in resistance heating are described by both ASTM and DIN standards. These standards specify the relative percentages of nickel and chromium that should be present in an alloy. In ASTM three alloys that are specified contain, amongst other trace elements:

* 80% Ni, 20% Cr
* 60% Ni, 16% Cr
* 35% Ni, 20% Cr

=== Properties by composition ===
Each standard composition of nichrome has unique material properties. Some general ones are given as follows: 
== Uses ==

Because of its low cost of manufacture, strength, ductility, resistance to oxidation, stability at high temperatures, and electrical resistance, nichrome is widely used in electric heating elements in applications such as hair dryers and heat guns. Typically, nichrome is wound in coils to a certain electrical resistance, and when current is passed through it the Joule heating produces heat.

Nichrome is used in the explosives and fireworks industry as a bridgewire in electric ignition systems, such as electric matches and model rocket igniters.

Industrial and hobby hot-wire foam cutters use nichrome wire.

Nichrome wire is commonly used in ceramic as an internal support structure to help some elements of clay sculptures hold their shape while they are still soft. Nichrome wire is used for its ability to withstand the high temperatures that occur when clay work is fired in a kiln.

Nichrome wire can be used as an alternative to platinum wire for flame testing by colouring the non-luminous part of a flame to detect cations such as sodium, potassium, copper, calcium, etc.

Other areas of usage include motorcycle mufflers, in certain areas in the microbiological lab apparatus, as the heating element of plastic extruders by the RepRap 3D printing community, in the solar panel deployment mechanism of spacecraft LightSail-A, and as the heating coils of electronic cigarettes.

The alloy price is controlled by the more expensive nickel content. Distributor pricing is typically indexed to market prices for nickel.

Nickel allergies are common; while the wire in heating elements is rarely directly touched by users of devices, some uses of nichrome are, and a 1984 study by the University of Puerto Rico showed that 28.5% of people tested had some kind of allergic reaction following contact with nickel.

<doc id="520448" wikidata="Q44829" url="?curid=520448" title="Tucumán Province">
<text>Tucumán () is the most densely populated, and the second-smallest by land area, of the provinces of Argentina.

Located in the northwest of the country, the province has the capital of San Miguel de Tucumán, often shortened to Tucumán. Neighboring provinces are, clockwise from the north: Salta, Santiago del Estero and Catamarca. It is nicknamed El Jardín de la República (&quot;The Garden of the Republic&quot;), as it is a highly productive agricultural area.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Tucumán&quot; probably originated from the Quechua languages. It may represent a deformation of the term &quot;Yucumán&quot;, which denotes the &quot;place of origin of several rivers&quot;. It can also be a deformation of the word &quot;Tucma&quot;, which means &quot;the end of things&quot;. Before Spanish colonization, the region lay in the outer limits of the Inca empire.

==History==


Before the Spanish colonization, this land was inhabited by the Diaguitas and Tonocotes.
In 1533, Diego de Almagro explored the Argentine Northwest, including Tucumán.
In 1549 the Peruvian governor Pedro de la Gasca granted Juan Núñez de Prado the territory of Tucumán.
Prado established the first Spanish settlement at the town of Barco on the Dulce River.
Prado named his province &quot;Tucumán&quot; after Tucumamahao, one of the leaders of the local people who formed an alliance with him.
In 1552, Francisco de Aguirre was dispatched to take possession of the territory for Chile.
Aguirre followed a repressive policy, triggering a rebellion by the native people.
Outnumbered, the colonists were forced to move in 1553 to a new location, where they founded the town of Santiago del Estero.

By 1565, Diego de Villaroel founded &quot;San Miguel de Tucumán&quot; and the &quot;Provincia de Tucumán, Juríes y Diaguitas&quot; was organized. Because of frequent attacks by the indigenous peoples, the Malones, in 1685, San Miguel de Tucumán was moved by Miguel de Salas some 65 km from its first location, where it was redeveloped.
The aborigines of the region presented a strong resistance to the Spanish, who decided to move the defeated tribes toward Buenos Aires. The most noted of these relocations was the case of the Quilmes, who were moved to the city of Quilmes.

Tucumán was a midpoint for shipments of gold and silver from the Viceroyalty of Peru to Buenos Aires. It produced cattle, textiles, and wood products that provided supplies for the convoys on their way to Buenos Aires. Because of its important geographical position, and as head of the civil and Catholic governments, it acquired special importance during the 18th century.

The creation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776 meant the end of the convoys from Perú to Buenos Aires. Tucumán, with 20,000 inhabitants by that time, suffered also from the British imports from the newly opened customs of Buenos Aires, no longer under the monopoly of the Spanish Crown.

In 1783, the Intendancy of Tucumán was divided; Tucumán was set under the control of the Intendancy of Salta del Tucumán, with its centre in Salta. José de San Martín arrived in Tucumán in 1813 and installed the military school. In 1814, the Intendancy of Salta was divided into the present provinces.

On July 9, 1816, at the Congress of Tucumán, the &quot;Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata&quot; (&quot;United Provinces of the Río de la Plata&quot;) declared their independence from Spain. Internal conflicts delayed the final fusion of the provinces into the &quot;República Argentina&quot;.

Following the failure of Argentina&#x27;s first independence-era government, the Directorio, Governor Bernabé Aráoz on March 22, 1820, proclaimed the creation of the Federal Republic of Tucumán. The experiment collapsed, however, when the neighboring provinces of Catamarca and Santiago del Estero withdrew the following year.

The beginning of the 20th century, with the customs restrictions and the arrival of the railway, brought prosperous economic times for the province and its sugarcane production. Numerous landmarks were built, such as Ninth of July Park and the Tucumán Government Palace, and a daily newspaper founded in 1912, &quot;La Gaceta&quot;, became the most circulated Argentine daily outside Buenos Aires, but the sugar price crisis of the 1960s and President Juan Carlos Onganía&#x27;s order to have 11 large state-owned sugar mills closed in 1966, hit Tucumán&#x27;s economy hard, and ushered in an era of instability for the province.

In 1975, President Isabel Perón declared a state of emergency in the province. The decree led to Operation Independence, an official military campaign at least as brutal on local magistrates, lawmakers, and faculty as it was on its stated target, the ERP. Violence did not fully abate until the appointment of General Antonio Domingo Bussi, the operation&#x27;s commander, as governor at the behest of the dictatorship that deposed Perón in 1976. Efficient as well as ruthless, Bussi oversaw the completion of several stalled public works, but also presided over some of the worst human rights abuses during that painful 1976-77 period. Retaining a sizable following, Bussi was elected governor in his own right in 1995, but lost much of his earlier popularity during his four-year tenure.

Life in Tucumán has since returned to a certain normality. Its economy has recovered strongly during the expansive period Argentina has had in the decade since 2002. José Alperovich, elected governor in 2003, has presided over record investment in public works while reaping criticism for attempts to eliminate term limits for his office.

==Geography==

Despite Tucumán&#x27;s small size, it has two main different geographical systems. The east is associated with the Gran Chaco flat lands, while the west presents a mixture of the Sierras of the Pampas to the south and the canyons of the Argentine Northwest to the north. The &quot;Cerro del Bolsón&quot; is the highest peak at an elevation of .

The Salí is the province&#x27;s main river. Tucumán also has four dams that are used for hydroelectricity and irrigation: El Cadillal on Salí River, the province&#x27;s most important dam; Embalse Río Hondo on the Hondo River; La Angostura on de los Sosa River; and Escaba on the Marapa River. The Santa María River crosses the Valles Calchaquíes.

===Climate===
Tucuman lies at the convergence of temperate climates and tropical climates further north, retaining characteristics of both in the lowlands. Furthermore, it is highly monsoonal, and depends also on elevation. As a rule of thumb, the far east is drier and hotter, whereas the Piedmont has many storms in the summer which moderate temperatures. The first foothills are very humid, supporting a dense jungle, and as altitude increases, a thick forest and then cool grasslands. The westernmost areas are once again a bit dryer because of a rain shadow.

The eastern parts have an average annual temperature of . Summers are hot with mean temperatures averaging between while in winter, the mean temperatures are between . Easternmost parts of the province, which borders the Chaco region are home to the highest and lowest temperatures in the province where absolute maximum temperatures can exceed while absolute minimum temperatures can reach close to owing to the accumulation of cold air that descends from the mountains. At higher altitudes, the climate is cooler with summer temperatures averaging and winter temperatures averaging . The annual temperature in the higher altitudes is at an altitude of above sea level. Within the valleys located between the mountains, temperatures are cooler with a mean annual temperature of (summers average while winters average ) in the Tafi valley.

Precipitation in the lowlands ranges from 600 mm (24 in) in the east, to close to 1,200 mm in the foothills (48 in), in a very monsoonal pattern with 4-5 completely dry winter months, and a peak of about 200 mm (7.9 in) in the rainiest summer month.

The eastward-facing slopes concentrate not only the heaviest precipitation, with spots around 1,800 mm (71 in) falling mostly in the 5 months of the summer monsoon, but also have a unique characteristic, which is that during part of the year, they are constantly immersed in a thick fog, providing humidity for the development of a thick jungle. The climate quickly becomes decidedly temperate with altitude, supporting different kinds of forest which even receive some snow every winter, finally reaching high-altitude grasslands with cool, windy weather year-round.

The abundant precipitation creates a wide area of abundant vegetation and justifies Tucumán&#x27;s title of &quot;Jardín de la República&quot; (Garden of the Republic).

==Economy==

Long among the most underdeveloped Argentine provinces, Tucumán Province has been growing strongly, and its economy, the nation&#x27;s seventh-largest, reached US$7.2 billion in 2006. Its per capita output of US$5,400 (around US$7,900 in 2011) was nearly 40% below the national average, but compares favourably with that of most of its neighbors. In 2012, the per capita income of the province is of 8,000 dollars

Known internationally for its prodigious sugarcane (with 2,300 km2, and the sugar production, 60% of the country&#x27;s), Tucumán&#x27;s economy is quite diversified, and agriculture accounts for about 7% of output. After the sugar crisis of the 1960s, Tucumán tried to diversify its crops, and now cultivates, among others, lemons (world first producer), strawberries, kiwifruit, beans, banana, maize, alfalfa, and soybeans.

Cattle, sheep, and goats are raised mainly for local consumption.

Manufacturing in Tucumán initially centered on sugar production, but has diversified significantly since 1960. Sugar mills comprise about 15% to the total economy. Besides the industrialisation of the sugarcane into sugar, paper, and alcohol, food, textile, automotive, and metallurgical industries are present. Among the latter, the freight-truck assembly operated by the Volkswagen Group-controlled Swedish Scania company is probably the best known. Mining is a minor activity, centered on salt, clay, lime, and other non-metallic extractions. The province is also big in lemons and blueberries, exporting almost 80% of the harvest to other countries.

Cultural and sport tourism is common in the province, and attracts a number of Argentine tourists every year. The Panamerican Highway (Route 9) crosses San Miguel de Tucumán, and connects it with Santiago del Estero and Buenos Aires. The city also serves as a mid-stop for tourists visiting other provinces of the Argentine Northwest. The Teniente General Benjamín Matienzo International Airport has regular flights to Buenos Aires, Lima, Santiago, Cordoba and São Paulo, and receives almost 800,000 passengers every year.

The most visited destinations of the Province are the Campo de los Alisos National Park, Valles Calchaquíes, Tafí del Valle, Ruins of Quilmes, the Diaguita community of Amaicha del Valle, and the city of San Miguel de Tucumán.

Four important universities are in the province: Universidad Nacional de Tucumán (with 60,000 students), Universidad Tecnológica Nacional, Universidad del Norte Santo Tomás de Aquino, and Universidad de San Pablo-T.

== Government ==

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Tucumán Provincial Police.
The provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution of Tucumán Province forms the formal law of the province.

==Political division==
The province is divided into 17 departments (Spanish departamentos).

==Towns and villages==
* Anca Juli
* Los Ralos (settlement)
* San Pedro de Colalao (settlement)

<text>The Pacific plate is an oceanic tectonic plate that lies beneath the Pacific Ocean. At , it is the largest tectonic plate.

The plate first came into existence as a microplate 190 million years ago, at the triple junction between the Farallon, Phoenix, and Izanagi plates. The Pacific plate subsequently grew to where it underlies most of the Pacific Ocean basin. This reduced the Farallon plate to a few remnants along the west coast of the Americas and the Phoenix plate to a small remnant near the Drake Passage, and destroyed the Izanagi plate by subduction under Asia.

The Pacific plate contains an interior hot spot forming the Hawaiian Islands.

==Boundaries==
The north-eastern side is a divergent boundary with the Explorer plate, the Juan de Fuca plate and the Gorda plate forming respectively the Explorer Ridge, the Juan de Fuca Ridge and the Gorda Ridge. In the middle of the eastern side is a transform boundary with the North American plate along the San Andreas Fault, and a divergent boundary with the Cocos plate. The south-eastern side is a divergent boundary with the Nazca plate forming the East Pacific Rise. 

The southern side is a divergent boundary with the Antarctic plate forming the Pacific–Antarctic Ridge. 

The western side is bounded by the Okhotsk microplate at the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench and the Japan Trench. The plate forms a convergent boundary by subducting under the Philippine Sea plate creating the Mariana Trench, has a transform boundary with the Caroline plate, and has a collision boundary with the North Bismarck plate. 

In the south-west, the Pacific plate has a complex but generally convergent boundary with the Indo-Australian plate, subducting under it north of New Zealand forming the Tonga Trench and the Kermadec Trench. The Alpine Fault marks a transform boundary between the two plates, and further south the Indo-Australian plate subducts under the Pacific plate forming the Puysegur Trench. The southern part of Zealandia, which is to the east of this boundary, is the plate&#x27;s largest block of continental crust. Hillis and Müller are reported to consider the Bird&#x27;s Head plate to be moving in unison with the Pacific plate, but Bird considers them to be unconnected.

The northern side is a convergent boundary subducting under the North American plate forming the Aleutian Trench and the corresponding Aleutian Islands (see also: Aleutian Arc).

==Paleo-geology of the Pacific plate==

The Pacific plate is almost entirely oceanic crust, but it contains some continental crust in New Zealand, Baja California, and coastal California.

The Pacific plate has the distinction of showing one of the largest areal sections of the oldest members of seabed geology being entrenched into eastern Asian oceanic trenches. A geologic map of the Pacific Ocean seabed shows not only the geologic sequences, and associated Ring of Fire zones on the ocean&#x27;s perimeters, but the various ages of the seafloor in a stairstep fashion, youngest to oldest, the oldest being consumed into the Asian oceanic trenches. The oldest part disappearing by way of the plate tectonics cycle is early-Cretaceous (145 to 137 million years ago).

The Pacific plate originated at the triple junction of the three main oceanic plates of Panthalassa, the Farallon, Phoenix, and Izanagi plates, around 190 million years ago. The plate formed because the triple junction had converted to an unstable form surrounded on all sides by transform faults, due to the development of a kink in one of the plate boundaries. The &quot;Pacific Triangle&quot;, the oldest part of the Pacific plate, created during the initial stages of plate formation, is located just east of the Mariana Trench. The growth of the Pacific plate reduced the Farallon plate to a few remnants along the west coast of the Americas (such as the Juan de Fuca plate) and the Phoenix plate to a small remnant near the Drake Passage, and destroyed the Izanagi plate by subduction under Asia.

<text>Hoyt Sanford Vandenberg (January 24, 1899 – April 2, 1954) was a United States Air Force general. He served as the second Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and the second Director of Central Intelligence.

During World War II, Vandenberg was the commanding general of the Ninth Air Force, a tactical air force in England and in France, supporting the Army, from August 1944 until V-E Day. Vandenberg Space Force Base on the central coast of California is named after him. In 1946, he was briefly the U.S. Chief of Military Intelligence. He was the nephew of Arthur H. Vandenberg, a former U.S. Senator from Michigan.

==Early life==
Vandenberg was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Pearl Kane and William Collins Vandenbergh, both from Dutch ancestry. He grew up in Lowell, Massachusetts, spending his teenage years there. While there he was one of the first Eagle Scouts in the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s Lowell Council. He graduated from the United States Military Academy on June 12, 1923, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Air Service.

==Military career==
Vandenberg graduated from the Air Service Flying School at Brooks Field, Texas, in February 1924, and from the Air Service Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field, Texas, in September 1924.

Vandenberg&#x27;s first assignment was with the 90th Attack Squadron, part of the 3rd Attack Group at Kelly Field. (In 1926 Lt. Van was also a stunt pilot for the silent film &quot;Wings&quot; which was filming in San Antonio. &quot;Wings&quot; won the first Academy Award for a motion picture.) Vandenberg was appointed commander of the 90th AS on January 1, 1926. In 1927, he became an instructor at the Air Corps Primary Flying School at March Field, Calif. In 1928 he was promoted to first lieutenant. In May 1929 he went to Wheeler Field, Hawaii, to join the 6th Pursuit Squadron, and assumed command of it the following November.

Returning in September 1931, Vandenberg was appointed a flying instructor at Randolph Field, Texas, and became a flight commander and deputy stage commander there in March 1933. He entered the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama, in August 1934, and graduated the following June. Two months later he enrolled in the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; he completed the course in June 1936 and was promoted to the rank of captain. He then became an instructor in the Pursuit Section of the Air Corps Tactical School, where he taught until September 1936, when he entered the Army War College, where he specialized in air defense planning for the Philippines.

After graduating from the War College in June 1939, Vandenberg was assigned to the Plans Division in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps, selected personally by its head, Brigadier General Carl Spaatz, whom he had met at the Command and General Staff College. In September 1939 and the autumn of 1940, Vandenberg developed two air plans for the Philippine Department, the second based on Royal Air Force interceptor operations in the Battle of Britain, but neither was adopted by the War Department when the Roosevelt Administration reaffirmed its long-standing opposition to any plan that called for extensive reinforcement of the defenses in the Philippines. In 1940 Vandenberg was promoted to major and in 1941 to lieutenant colonel.

A few months after the United States entered World War II, Vandenberg was promoted to colonel and became operations and training officer of the Air Staff. For his services in these two positions he received the Distinguished Service Medal.

In June 1942, Vandenberg was assigned to the United Kingdom and assisted in the organization of the Air Forces in North Africa. While in Great Britain he was appointed the chief of staff of the Twelfth Air Force, which he helped organize. In December 1942 Vandenberg earned the promotion to brigadier general. On February 18, 1943, Vandenberg became the chief of staff of the Northwest African Strategic Air Force (NASAF), which was under the command of Major General James Doolittle. NASAF was the strategic arm of the new Northwest African Air Forces (NAAF) under Lieutenant General Carl Spaatz. With NASAF, Vandenberg flew on numerous missions over Tunisia, Pantelleria, Sardinia, Sicily, and Italy. He was awarded both the Silver Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his services during this time. For his organizational ability with the Twelfth Air Force and his work as chief of staff of the NASAF, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. In August 1943, Vandenberg was assigned to Air Force headquarters as Deputy Chief of Air Staff. In September 1943, he became head of an air mission to Russia, under Ambassador Harriman, and returned to the United States in January 1944. In March 1944, he earned the promotion to major general and then he was transferred to the European theater; in April 1944, he was designated the Deputy Air Commander in Chief of the Allied Expeditionary Forces and the Commander of its American Air Component.

In August 1944, Vandenberg assumed command of the Ninth Air Force. On November 28, 1944, he received an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his part in planning the Normandy invasion. He was promoted to lieutenant general in March 1945.

Vandenberg was appointed the Assistant Chief of Air Staff at the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) headquarters in July 1945. In January 1946, he became Director of Intelligence on the War Department general staff where he served until his appointment in June 1946, as Director of Central Intelligence, a position he held until May 1947.

Vandenberg returned to duty with the Air Force in April 1947, and on June 15 became the Deputy Commander in Chief of the Air Staff. Following the division of the United States Department of War into the Departments of the Army and the Air Force, Vandenberg was designated the Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force on October 1, 1947, and promoted to the rank of general.

Even when Vandenberg was at the pinnacle of his military career, his boyish good looks and outgoing personality often made him the target of attacks on his credibility and experience. However, the attention that his appearance brought on was not all bad. He appeared on the covers of &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; once described him as &quot;the most impossibly handsome man on the entire Washington scene,&quot; and Marilyn Monroe once named Vandenberg, along with Joe DiMaggio and Albert Einstein, as one of the three people with whom she would want to be stranded on a deserted island.

On April 30, 1948, Vandenberg became the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, succeeding General Carl Spaatz. He was renominated by President Harry S. Truman for a second term as Air Force Chief of Staff on March 6, 1952. The nomination was confirmed on April 28, with Vandenberg serving until June 30, 1953.

A controversy arose while Vandenberg was the Air Force Chief of Staff, when he opposed the United States Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson on a proposed $5 billion budget reduction for the Air Force. Vandenberg maintained that the cut backed by Wilson would reduce military aviation to a &quot;one-shot Air Force,&quot; inferior to that of the Soviet Union. He said it was another instance of &quot;start-stop&quot; planning of a kind that had impeded Air Force development in previous years. The cut in appropriations went into effect in July 1953, immediately after his retirement from the Air Force.

==Later life==

A scratch golfer, he spent much time on golf courses. He was also a lover of movies, Westerns, and scotch. Vandenberg retired from active duty on June 30, 1953, and he died nine months later, at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center of prostate cancer at the age of 55. He is interred in Section 30 of Arlington National Cemetery.

His wife, Gladys Merritt (Rose) Vandenberg (1898–1978), started the concept of the Arlington Ladies while he was Air Force Chief of Staff. The program provides that a woman of the appropriate military service represents the service chief at all military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery. She was buried, alongside her husband, in Arlington National Cemetery upon her death on January 9, 1978. They are survived by their children, Gloria Vandenberg Miller (1925-2022) and Hoyt S. Vandenberg, Jr.

==Namesakes==
On October 4, 1958, the missile and space base at Camp Cooke in Lompoc, California, was renamed Vandenberg Air Force Base (which was redesignated Vandenberg Space Force Base in 2021). In July 1963, the instrument ship was renamed at Cape Canaveral, Florida, for duty on the Eastern Space and Missile Range in the Atlantic. One of the two cadets&#x27; dormitories at the United States Air Force Academy, Vandenberg Hall, is also named in his honor. In addition, a popular enlisted &quot;hangout&quot; for technical school Airmen at Keesler AFB, Mississippi, is named in his honor, as was the Vandenberg Esplanade, along the Merrimack River in Lowell, Massachusetts and part of the Lowell Heritage State Park.

<doc id="520454" wikidata="Q44764" url="?curid=520454" title="Jujuy Province">
<text>Jujuy is a province of Argentina, located in the extreme northwest of the country, at the borders with Chile and Bolivia. The only neighboring Argentine province is Salta to the east and south.

==Geography==

There are three main areas in Jujuy:
*The Altiplano, a plateau high with peaks of , covers most of the province.
*The Río Grande of Jujuy cuts through the Quebrada de Humahuaca canyon, of heights between .
*To the southeast, the sierras descends to the Gran Chaco region.
The vast difference in height and climate produces desert areas such as the Salinas Grandes salt mines and subtropical Yungas jungle.

The terrain of the province is mainly arid and semi-desertic across the different areas, except for the &quot;El Ramal&quot; valley of the San Francisco River. Temperature difference between day and night is wider in higher lands, and precipitation is scarce outside the temperate area of the San Francisco River.

The Grande River and the San Francisco River flow to the Bermejo River. The San Juan, La Quiaca, Yavi and Sansana Rivers flow to the Pilcomayo River.

==History==
Pre-Columbian inhabitants known as the Omaguacas and Ocloyas practiced agriculture and domesticated the guanaco. They had huts made of mud, and erected stone fortresses to protect their villages. An example of such fortresses is Pucará de Tilcara, Pucará meaning &quot;fortress&quot; (word also used for the Argentine combat aircraft Pucara). Omaguacas and Ocloyas were later conquered by the Incas during their expansion period.

The name &quot;Jujuy&quot; derives from a type of Inca provincial governor (&quot;xuxuyoc&quot;) encountered there by the Spanish in the late 16th century.

In 1593, a small settlement (current San Salvador de Jujuy) was erected in the Jujuy valley by the effort of Francisco de Argañaraz y Murguía. Colonial forces fought the resistance by the indigenous Calchaquíes and Omaguacas, so that the European population eventually consolidated in the village.

At the end of the 17th century, the customs to the Viceroyalty of Peru was transferred from Córdoba to Jujuy.

With the separation from Peru and the creation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, Jujuy lost its importance and its population started to diminish.

During the May Revolution and the battles for the independence of the &quot;United provinces of the South&quot;, many confrontations took place in Jujuy because the Spanish concentrated their forces in Peru. The people of Jujuy had to endure the Jujuy Exodus, a massive evacuation with a scorched earth policy, led by General Manuel Belgrano. Eventually the Spanish surrendered, but the war had seriously affected the economy of the area.

After a series of internal conflicts, the province declared its autonomy from Tucumán and Salta Provinces on November 18, 1834. Jujuy started a gradual process of economic and social improvement, and at the end of the 19th century the sugarcane industry arose. At the beginning of the 20th century, the railway connected the province with Buenos Aires, and La Paz, Bolivia.

In 1945, heavy industry first arrived in Jujuy at the hand of General Manuel Savio, a presidential economic advisor who, had Argentina&#x27;s first modern steel mill installed in Jujuy. In 1969, Jujuy joined oil-rich neighboring Salta Province with the discovery of petroleum by the state-owned YPF.

The Gobernador Horacio Guzmán International Airport has operated since 1967.

==Indigenous people==
The Colla people are indigenous people who have been living in Jujuy for centuries, practicing subsistence living, farming with llamas and goats. A group of small producers from Suqueños have been fighting in defense of Pachamama and their rights as members of Atacama people. Thirty-three villages have united to oppose the lithium extraction as it requires much water which the region has very little of. As of 2019, at a single salt lake 10 billion liters of water were being pumped up from 450 meter depth into solar ponds. They also claim that lithium operations have contaminated the air with residuals of chemicals used to extract lithium, such as lye, hydrated sodium carbonate and others. The dust irritates the eyes of llamas and can cause blindness.

==Economy==
Jujuy&#x27;s economy is moderately underdeveloped, yet very diversified. Its 2006 economy was an estimated US$2.998 billion, or, US$4,899 per capita (over 40% below the national average).

===Agriculture===
Jujuy is, despite its rural profile, not particularly agrarian. Agriculture contributes about 10% to output and the main agricultural activity is sugarcane. Its processing represents more than half of the province&#x27;s gross production, and 30% of the national sugar production. The second agricultural activity is tobacco, cultivated in the Southeastern valley, as a major national producer.

Other crops include beans, citrus and tomatoes, and other vegetables for local consumption. Cattle and goats are raised on a small scale, mainly for local dairies, and llamas, vicuñas and guanacos are raised in significant numbers for wool.

Manufacturing is more prominent in Jujuy than in some neighboring provinces, adding 15% to its economy. Jujuy is the second largest Argentine producer of iron, used by the &quot;Altos Hornos Zapla&quot; steel mill.

===Mining===
Other industrial activities include mining for construction material, petroleum extraction at &quot;Caimancito&quot;, salt production from &quot;Salinas Grandes&quot; salt basin, and paper production fed by the Jujuy&#x27;s forests with 20% of the industrial product of the province.

Argentina is the world&#x27;s second largest lithium brine producer which is located in Jujuy (e. g. Salar de Olaroz and Salinas Grandes mines). The so-called Lithium Triangle, consisting of NW Argentina, Bolivia and NE Chile holds more than half the world&#x27;s supply.

==Tourism==

After the financial crisis of 2001 in Argentina, citizens were encouraged to explore their own country as opposed to travelling abroad. Tourism in the area is still a growing activity and brings a number of Argentine tourists (80%), tourists from other South American countries (12%) and Europeans (7%). Most tourists head for San Salvador de Jujuy to start their exploration of the province. The Horacio Guzmán International Airport, 34 km from San Salvador, connects the province with Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and some destinations in Bolivia.

Apart from the fantastic contrast of land colours and formations, tourists are attracted also by the strong aboriginal roots in the culture of Jujuy. Salta wineries growing in popularity have attracted tourists, combining province traditions with &quot;cosmopolitan culture&quot;. Aymará and Quechua cultures coexist in the area, and ruins of the Incas are well conserved.

Tourists who come to Jujuy visit the area of the Quebrada de Humahuaca and its Cerro de los Siete Colores, Pucará de Tilcara, &quot;Salinas Grandes&quot; and many small towns. Other less frequent destinations include the Calilegua National Park in the Yungas jungle, La Quiaca, &quot;Laguna de Pozuelos&quot;, and &quot;Laguna Guayatayoc&quot;.

== Government ==

The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution of Jujuy Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Jujuy Provincial Police.

<text>The Indianapolis metropolitan area is an 11-county metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Indiana. Its principal cities are Indianapolis, Carmel, Greenwood, and Anderson. Other primary cities with populations of more than 50,000 include Fishers, Noblesville, and Westfield. Located in Central Indiana, it is the largest metropolitan area entirely within Indiana and the seventh largest in the American Midwest.

There are two official metropolitan boundaries for the Indianapolis metro area: the Indianapolis–Carmel–Greenwood, IN Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Indianapolis–Carmel–Muncie, IN Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The two regions are identical except for the addition of three metropolitan areas (Columbus, Kokomo, and Muncie) and six micropolitan statistical areas (Crawfordsville, Greencastle, Greensburg, Seymour, New Castle, and Peru) to the Indianapolis–Carmel–Muncie CSA that are not included in the Indianapolis–Carmel–Greenwood MSA.

<text>The Act to Protect the Province Against Communistic Propaganda (), commonly known as the &quot;Padlock Law&quot; or &quot;Padlock Act&quot; (), was a law in the province of Quebec, Canada that allowed the Attorney General of Quebec to close off access to property suspected of being used to propagate or disseminate communist propaganda. The law was introduced by the Union Nationale government of Maurice Duplessis and made it illegal to &quot;use [a house] or allow any person to make use of it to propagate Communism or Bolshevism by any means whatsoever&quot;. This included printing, publishing or distributing of &quot;any newspaper, periodical, pamphlet, circular, document or writing, propagating Communism or Bolshevism&quot;. Violations of the Act subjected such property to closure by the Attorney General, including the locking of access doors with padlocks, against any use whatsoever for a period of up to one year and any person found guilty of involvement in prohibited media activities could be incarcerated for three to thirteen months.

The law was extremely vague; it did not define Communism or Bolshevism in any concrete way. It denied both the presumption of innocence and freedom of speech to individuals. There were also concerns that the law would be used in order to arrest individual activists from international trade unions. Two union leaders were nearly arrested in that period. The law was used against Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses for distributing their publications, most commonly as a &quot;prextext for search and seizure&quot;.

The federal government under Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King could have used its power of disallowance to nullify the Padlock Law, as it had done to overturn equally controversial laws that had been passed by Alberta&#x27;s Social Credit government around the same time. However, King chose not to intervene in Quebec.

The Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s 1957 decision in &quot;Switzman v Elbling&quot; struck down the law as &quot;ultra vires&quot; of the provincial government because it was an attempt by the province to enact a statute respecting criminal law, which is the exclusive domain of the federal parliament under the Constitution of Canada. In their concurrence, justices Ivan Rand, Roy Kellock and Douglas Abbott also argued the law was &quot;ultra vires&quot; because it contravened an implied bill of rights that underlies the Canadian constitution, but this view was not shared by the rest of the majority.

This double-decked truss bridge, built in 1954, was to originally carry I-95 through Boston from southwest to northeast in tandem with the Tobin Bridge, built in 1950. The I-95 project and several other highway projects in and around Boston, including both the highly controversial Inner Belt (I-695) and the Southwest Corridor, completing the right-of-way intended to bring I-95 into Boston from Providence, Rhode Island, were cancelled due to heavy public opposition in the early 1970s. I-93 was allowed to be completed from the Yankee Division Highway (Route 128) to the foot of the Charlestown High Bridge in 1969, and the I-93 designation was extended onto the bridge and the Central Artery in the early 1970s.

Originally intended to carry 75,000 vehicles per day in the 1950s, the Charlestown High Bridge carried upwards of 200,000 vehicles per day in the 1990s. For years, the bridge was a major traffic bottleneck that affected southbound commuters from Boston&#x27;s North Shore and southern New Hampshire for miles. Travelling northbound, due to a poorly planned lane drop to accommodate incoming vehicles from Storrow Drive, traffic backups leading to the High Bridge threatened to cause hours of daily gridlock in downtown Boston. These problems were addressed in the planning and construction of the $14.6 billion Big Dig project. The cable-stayed Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge, which opened fully to traffic in December 2003, replaced the Charlestown High Bridge, which was demolished in 2004.

<text>Salta () is a province of Argentina, located in the northwest of the country. Neighboring provinces are from the east clockwise Formosa, Chaco, Santiago del Estero, Tucumán and Catamarca. It also surrounds Jujuy. To the north it borders Bolivia and Paraguay and to the west lies Chile.

==History==

Before the Spanish conquest, numerous native peoples (now called Diaguitas and Calchaquíes) lived in the valleys of what is now Salta Province; they formed many different tribes, the Quilmes and Humahuacas among them, which all shared the Cacán language. The Atacamas lived in the Puna, and the Wichís (Matacos), in the Chaco region.

The first conquistador to venture into the area was Diego de Almagro in 1535; he was followed by Diego de Rojas. Hernando de Lerma founded San Felipe de Lerma in 1582, following orders of the viceroy Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa; the name of the city was soon changed to &quot;San Felipe de Salta&quot;. By 1650, the city had around five hundred inhabitants.
An intendency of &quot;Salta del Tucumán&quot; was created within the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. In 1774, San Ramón de La Nueva Orán was founded between Salta and Tarija (Tarija was added to the intendency later, in 1807). In 1783, in recognition of the growing importance of the city, the capital of the intendency of Salta del Tucumán was moved from San Miguel de Tucumán to Salta.

The battle of Salta in 1813 freed the territory from Spain, but occasional attacks were mounted from the Viceroyalty of Peru as late as 1826. Gervasio de Posadas created the province of Salta in 1814, containing the current provinces of Salta, Jujuy, and parts of southern Bolivia and northern Chile.

Exploiting internal Argentine conflicts that arose after the Argentine Declaration of Independence, Bolivia annexed Tarija in 1826. In 1834, Jujuy withdrew from Salta and became a separate province. The borders of Salta were further reduced in 1900, with the loss of Yacuiba to Bolivia.

The National Government of Los Andes, constituted from the province in 1902 with a capital at San Antonio de los Cobres, was returned to Salta Province in 1943 as the Department of Los Andes.

Antonio Alice&#x27;s painting, &quot;La muerte de Güemes&quot;, which received a gold medal at the Centenary Exposition, is on display at the offices of the Salta Provincial Government.

==Geography==


The total land area of the province is , making it the sixth largest province by area in Argentina. The main rivers of the province are the Pilcomayo, Bermejo, and the Juramento, which later becomes the Salado River. Salta Province is located at a geologically active region, and suffers from occasional earthquakes. There have been four earthquakes of note in the province:
*In 1692, registering 7.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, and at IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale, 
*In 1844, registering 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale, and VII (Very strong) Mercalli intensity,
*In 1948, registering 7.0 on the Moment magnitude scale (MMS), and IX (Violent) Mercalli intensity, and
*In 2010, registering 6.1 or 6.3 (MMS), and VI (Strong) Mercalli intensity.
The 1692 earthquake was the inspiration for Salta&#x27;s annual citywide festival, held on 16 September, in honor of El Señor y la Virgen del Milagro.

===Climate===
Although Salta Province is located near the Tropic of Capricorn, it has a wide range of climates due to variation in altitude and the influence of orography. The orientation of the Andes influences the distribution of precipitation within the province.

The easternmost parts of the province have a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;) with a rainy season in the summer. The mean annual temperature and precipitation are and . Temperatures can reach up to during summer, while they can fall down to during winter.
The first slopes of the Andes force the moist, easterly winds to rise, provoking very high condensation leading to the formation of clouds that generate copious amounts of rain. The eastern slopes of the mountains receive between of precipitation a year, although some places receive up to of precipitation annually owing to orographic precipitation. Most of the precipitation is concentrated in the summer, with winters being dry. The high rainfall on these first slopes creates a thick jungle that extends in a narrow strip along these ranges, creating an area of great species diversity. At higher altitudes on these slopes, the climate is cooler and more humid, with the vegetation consisting of deciduous and pine trees.

Between the high altitudes to the west and the low plains to the east lie the valleys. The climate of these valleys is either humid subtropical with dry winters (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;) or subtropical highland (&quot;Cwb&quot;), favouring human settlement and agricultural activities. Mean annual precipitation is around , most of it during summer. Mean temperatures exceed during the summer, while during winter, they are below .
Further west, the Altiplano is a plateau at above sea level. This region has a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;): high temperatures vary little (since the warmer season is cloudy, and the cooler sunny), ranging from ; night temperatures go from in midsummer, to in midwinter, and extremes under might be recorded. All rain falls exclusively in the summer, with annual totals between . Several salt flats exist in this area.

The highest altitudes found in the western parts of the province have a cool arid climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;), with large diurnal ranges (temperature range between day and night).

==Economy==
Salta&#x27;s economy is relatively underdeveloped, yet diverse. Its economy in 2006 was estimated at US$5.141 billion or, US$4,764 per capita, 45% below the national average. In 2012, its economy was estimated at $30.613 billion pesos (about US$6.743 billion) or $23,971 pesos (about US$5,280) per capita.

Manufacturing plays a significant role in Salta, adding 20% to the economy. Gas and petroleum from the Tartagal, Aguas Blancas, Madrejones and Campo Durán centres is transported to Buenos Aires and Rosario by pipes. There is also an oil refinery located at Campo Durán. Mining includes uranium at Iruya, La Poma and San Carlos; and silver at the Diablillos mine.

Agriculture and its derived industries are still an important activity in the province, adding over 10% to output. Tobacco, sugar cane and viticulture are the most important and produce most of the exports from the area. Other crops mostly for local consumption are maize, beans, citrus, bananas, and tomatoes. The sugar cane is processed in plants in Salta before it is sent to the rest of Argentina and other countries. The plant in San Martín de Tabacal is the most important of them. The famous wines of the Valles Calchaquíes region (mainly Torrontés, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon) near Cafayate are produced in numerous vineyards of diverse sizes. American breeds of cattle are raised only on the humid subtropical east, along with some sheep and goats.

==Tourism==

The Salta province is home to a number of natural, social and historic attractions.

The provincial capital city, also named Salta and nicknamed &quot;La Linda&quot; (&quot;The beautiful&quot;) is both an important tourist destination, and the centre point for visiting the rest of the province. The city holds different attractions; among them are its colonial houses and cathedral, and the Museum of High Altitude Archaeology (Spanish:&quot;Museo de Arqueología de Alta Montaña de Salta&quot;) that holds the three frozen Inca mummies found at the Llullaillaco volcano and known as the Children of Llullaillaco .

The Tren a las Nubes (&quot;Train to the Clouds&quot;) crosses canyons and cliffs before arriving at the 3,775 metres altitude (12,500 feet) of San Antonio de los Cobres. The red-rock formations of the Valles Calchaquíes and the wine-town of Cafayate are the second most visited place in the province. Many visit the Cachi mountains and the villages (such as Payogasta) around it.

There are three national parks in Salta: El Rey National Park in the Yungas jungle, Baritú National Park and Los Cardones National Park.

==Demographics==


According to the results from the , the province has a population of 1,214,441. It constitutes 3.0% of the total population in Argentina. This represented a 12.5% increase in the population compared to which had 1,079,051 inhabitants. 6.5% of the population or 79,204 persons declared themselves as having Indigenous background, making it one of the provinces that has a high percentage of indigenous people, being ranked 5th behind Chubut, Neuquén, Jujuy and Río Negro. The most populous indigenous groups in the province are the Wichí, which make up 24.9% of the total indigenous population followed by the Kolla (21.6%), and the Guaraní (13.7%). As well, only 4,189 persons declared themselves to be Afro-Argentine.
The province hosts a diverse foreign community: Christian Levantines of Syrian-Lebanese origin, Spaniards and Italians make up the largest groups. A small Ukrainian community has been there since the collapse of the Soviet Union and an Indian Sikh community has been living in Rosario de la Frontera since the 1940s. Other foreign people settled in the province are the Greek Cypriots, the Chinese, the Germans, the Francs, the Chileans, the Bolivians, the Paraguayans and the Slavs from the Adriatic (mainly Serbs and Croats). The Jewish community has a synagogue and the Muslims have a mosque, both in Salta City. Salta&#x27;s Jews are mostly of Ashkenazim origin, but there are also a few Sefardim families.

==Politics==

The province is governed as representative and republican form of government. The provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution of Salta Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Salta Provincial Police.

==Political division==

The province is divided in 23 departments (), containing 59 municipalities (). The capital of the province is the city of Salta, which is where the provincial government is located at.

<text>Guacanagarix (alternate transcriptions: Guacanacaríc, Guacanagarí) was one of five Taíno caciques of the Caribbean island henceforth known as Hispaniola at the arrival of the Europeans in 1492. This was contemporaneous with the first of the voyages of Christopher Columbus.

He was the chief of the cacicazgo of Marién, which occupied the northwest of the island.

Guacanagarix received Christopher Columbus after the &quot;Santa María&quot; was wrecked during his first voyage to the New World. He allowed Columbus to establish the settlement of La Navidad near his village. The colonists that remained there were killed by a rival tribe before Columbus returned on his second voyage.

Guacanagarix refused to ally himself with other caciques, who were trying to expel the Spaniards from the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo, and many times served as an informant and spy for the European settlers.

==Guacanagarix complex==
In the Dominican Republic, the term (Spanish: &quot;complejo de Guacanagarix&quot;) has been used to describe a Dominican who is considered more interested in foreign culture than in his own country.

<doc id="520482" wikidata="Q1699902" url="?curid=520482" title="Will Hay">
<text>William Thomson Hay (6 December 1888 – 18 April 1949) was an English comedian who wrote and acted in a schoolmaster sketch that later transferred to the screen, where he also played other authority figures with comic failings. His film &quot;Oh, Mr Porter!&quot; (1937), made by Gainsborough Pictures, is often cited as the supreme British-produced film-comedy, and in 1938 he was the third highest-grossing star in the UK. Many comedians have acknowledged him as a major influence. Hay was also a keen amateur astronomer.

==Early life==
Hay was born at 23 Durham Street in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham. He was one of two sons and three daughters of William Robert Hay (1859–1920) and his wife, Elizabeth (1859–1910) (née Ebden). When Will Hay Jr. was less than a year old the family moved to Lowestoft in Suffolk. By his late teens, Hay had become fluent in Italian, French and German and secured employment as an interpreter.

==Career==
===Early career===
Hay decided to become an actor when he was 21 after watching W. C. Fields perform a juggling act in Manchester. In the early years of the twentieth century Hay experienced some moderate success as a stand-up comedian and an after-dinner speaker. Hay&#x27;s first professional job came when he was offered a contract to perform at a theatre in Belper. In 1914 Hay began working with the impresario Fred Karno who had previously helped Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin achieve success. He worked with Karno for four years. He first performed his schoolmaster character in 1910 which he based upon a colleague of his sister, who was a teaching mistress. The characterisation was initially performed in drag as a schoolmistress, but he transferred the character to a headmaster.

The acts in which Hay performed the schoolmaster sketch became known as &quot;The Fourth Form at St. Michael&#x27;s&quot;. Hay toured with the act and appeared in the United States, Canada, Australia and South Africa (where he added Afrikaans to his languages). His wife, Gladys, often played a schoolboy or the character Harbottle in his sketches. The Harbottle character was one of the most appreciated in Hay&#x27;s act, a dim-witted, nearly deaf old man who is still in school because he&#x27;s so backward. The character later featured in Hay&#x27;s films portrayed by Moore Marriott. In a 1976 interview, Val Guest, who served as a screenwriter for many of Hay&#x27;s films, recalled transposing Harbottle from school into other everyday situations. He famously performed the schoolmaster routine at the 1925 Royal Command Performance before King George V and Queen Mary.

Hay published a magazine piece entitled &quot;Philosophy of Laughter&quot;, in which he discussed the psychology of comedy. In the essay he rhetorically asks, &quot;Why does every one of us laugh at seeing somebody else slapped in the face with a large piece of cold custard pie? Is it because we&#x27;re all naturally cruel? Or is it because there&#x27;s something inherently funny in custard pies? Or in faces? Or in throwing things? No, no, and no! The real reason why we laugh is because we are relieved. Because we are released from a sense of fear. Wherever we may happen to be – in the cinema, theatre, or music-hall – we tend to identify with the actors we are watching. So that when a custard pie is thrown we fear for a moment that it has been thrown at us. And then, immediately we realise that it hasn&#x27;t hit us, we experience a feeling of relief, and we laugh&quot;.

From 1934 to 1943, he was a prolific film star in Britain and was ranked the third highest grossing star at the British box office in 1938, behind George Formby and Gracie Fields. He is widely regarded as one of the most prolific and influential British comedians of all time.

Hay worked with Gainsborough Pictures from 1935 to 1940, during which time he developed a partnership with Graham Moffatt, playing an insolent overweight schoolboy, and Moore Marriott as a toothless old man. Hay&#x27;s 1937 film, with Moffatt and Marriott, &quot;Oh, Mr Porter!&quot; was credited by &quot;The Times&quot; as being &quot;a comic masterpiece of the British cinema&quot;, while the writer Jimmy Perry cited the film as an influence on key character development for &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;.

Hay often portrayed incompetent authority figures who attempt to conceal their incompetence but whose true traits are gradually exposed. As well as being incompetent, his characters are often immoral; for example, a clergyman involved in horse betting in &quot;Dandy Dick&quot;, a fraudster who lies about his career as a distinguished sea captain in &quot;Windbag the Sailor&quot;, and a prison warden, Dr Benjamin Twist, in &quot;Convict 99&quot;, who obtains his job under false pretences. He is often compared to W. C. Fields, who typically portrayed characters similar to those of Hay, being misanthropic, self-centered scoundrels who nevertheless remain sympathetic.

===Elstree Studios===
Hay had become interested in film making while touring in the United States in the 1920s, although, at the time he doubted he had a future in this field. Having returned to Britain, Hay started work at Elstree Studios in 1934 where he made three films, &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;, &quot;Radio Parade of 1935&quot; and &quot;Dandy Dick&quot;.

===Gainsborough Pictures===
Hay&#x27;s work at Gainsborough was his most successful, and source of his reputation as a great comic actor. During this period he became one of the most prolific film stars in Britain. On three occasions, British film exhibitors voted him among the top ten box office stars in an annual poll run by the Motion Picture Herald. He was ranked 8th in 1936, 4th in 1937 and 3rd in 1938. He particularly thrived under the studio management of Ted Black.

His first film for the studio was &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot;, whose screenplay was written by Hay himself. The movie&#x27;s satire on the public school system was loosely based on the Narkover vein of humour in the work of &quot;Daily Express&quot; columnist, Beachcomber. Hay&#x27;s film was widely seen as subversive towards authority, and it was granted an &#x27;A&#x27; (adult) certificate by the British Board of Film Classification. &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot; is widely regarded as Hay&#x27;s break-out film. Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Graham Greene described the film as &quot;very amusing&quot;, and Hay&#x27;s portrayal of Dr Smart as &quot;competent&quot;, though Greene thought Claude Dampier&#x27;s portrayal of Second Master Finch (Hay&#x27;s adversary) was the film&#x27;s &quot;finest performance&quot;. Many years later, the &quot;Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot; three stars out of five, observing that the film contains &quot;the blend of bluster and dishonesty that makes his films irresistible&quot;.

During his time with Gainsborough Hay worked with Marcel Varnel, Val Guest, Charles Hawtrey, and Marriott Edgar, as well as Moore Marriott and Graham Moffatt, who were Hay&#x27;s straight men in a number of his films. Moffatt played Albert, the overweight, insolent schoolboy reminiscent of Billy Bunter, while Marriott was the toothless old Harbottle. The trio appeared in six films together between 1936 and 1940, &quot;Windbag the Sailor&quot;, &quot;Oh, Mr Porter!&quot;, &quot;Convict 99&quot;, &quot;Old Bones of the River&quot;, &quot;Ask a Policeman&quot; and &quot;Where&#x27;s That Fire?&quot;.

Hay&#x27;s 1937 film alongside Moffatt and Marriott, &quot;Oh, Mr Porter!&quot; is often considered to be one of the greatest British comedy films of all-time. The British Film Institute included the film in its 360 Classic Feature Films list; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine described the movie as &quot;amusing, if over-long&quot;, noting that there was &quot;no love interest to mar the comedy&quot;; and the cult website TV Cream listed it at number 41 in its list of cinema&#x27;s Top 100 Films. The director Marcel Varnel considered the film as among his best work, and it was described in 2006, by &quot;The Times&quot; in its obituary for writer Val Guest, as &quot;a comic masterpiece of the British cinema&quot;. Jimmy Perry, in his autobiography, wrote that the triumvirate of Captain Mainwaring, Corporal Jones and Private Pike in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; was inspired by watching &quot;Oh, Mr Porter&quot;.

Both Moffatt and Marriott were absent from Hay&#x27;s 1938 film, &quot;Hey! Hey! USA&quot; with American comedy actor Edgar Kennedy being cast as Hay&#x27;s sidekick instead; the film was a somewhat unsuccessful attempt to crack the American market. In his Gainsborough films, Hay wore a wig, which made it appear as if he was balding.

Hay decided to break up the partnership with Moffatt and Marriott after their 1940 film &quot;Where&#x27;s That Fire?&quot; due to his concern that their act was becoming repetitive. He was known to dislike working with the pair, describing their partnership as &quot;a three legged stool&quot;. He had also expressed concern that Moore Marriott, who portrayed Harbottle, received a bigger reaction from audiences than he did. He had been seeking to break up their partnership in previous years, and it was only due to his film &quot;Hey! Hey! USA&quot; being somewhat unsuccessful that the writers and producers successfully talked him into bringing Moffatt and Marriott back.

===Ealing Studios===
Hay left Gainsborough and began working with Ealing Studios in 1940, in an attempt to break up his partnership with Moffatt and Marriott. Claude Hulbert and Charles Hawtrey were Hay&#x27;s sidekicks in his first film for Ealing, &quot;The Ghost of St. Michael&#x27;s&quot; (1941). Both would return to act with Hay in subsequent films - Hawtrey in &quot;The Goose Steps Out&quot; (1942) and Hulbert in Hay&#x27;s final film, &quot;My Learned Friend&quot; (1943). John Mills, who had appeared in Hay&#x27;s first film, &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; returned to act as his sidekick in &quot;The Black Sheep of Whitehall&quot;. &quot;The Goose Steps Out&quot; (1942) for Ealing was an effective piece of anti-Nazi slapstick. In the film, Hay acts as a British spy posing as a Nazi agent and teaches Nazi students about British customs. When lecturing them on this topic, he tells the students that the V sign (often used in Britain as an insult) is a mark of respect, and instructs the class to make a synchronised V sign to a portrait of Adolf Hitler. This scene is often considered one of the most iconic from a British comedy film.

During Hay&#x27;s tenure with Ealing he was credited as a director in three of his films, &quot;The Black Sheep of Whitehall&quot;, &quot;The Goose Steps Out&quot; and &quot;My Learned Friend&quot;. In all three, he co-directed with Basil Dearden. In 1942, he starred in a short information film, &quot;Go to Blazes&quot; alongside Thora Hird and Muriel George. The film was set during the Blitz and his role was a dim-witted father who tried unsuccessfully to defuse a bomb which had landed near his house, the bomb is only defused through the help of his daughter, portrayed by Hird. Also in 1942, he made an appearance in the propaganda film, &quot;The Big Blockade&quot; among other prolific actors of the time, including Leslie Banks, John Mills and Michael Redgrave.

His final film, &quot;My Learned Friend&quot; in 1943 has been described as a masterpiece of black comedy and has been cited as paving the way for the future Ealing comedy films &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955). Due to ailing health, &quot;My Learned Friend&quot; was Hay&#x27;s final film.

Hay was scheduled to star in another film for Ealing in 1943, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Your Uncle&quot;, but his diagnosis of cancer prevented him from proceeding.

Hay&#x27;s tenure with Ealing was a box office success and his films were critically acclaimed, but have been described as not at the level of his Gainsborough films with Moffatt and Marriott.

===Radio career===
The half-hour weekly Will Hay Programme began in August 1944, and was broadcast live from the BBC Paris Theatre in Lower Regent Street. With him in his schoolmaster role, were his pupils, Charles Hawtrey playing the cheeky Smart, John Clark as the class swot D&#x27;arcy Minor, and Billy Nicholls playing the dumb Beckett. The series lasted for four months and was cancelled, it is said, due to Hay&#x27;s dispute with the BBC over the quality of the scripts. Just before Christmas, the show went live at the Victoria Palace for six weeks.

The sketch was performed one more time at a gathering of variety entertainers at midnight on 4 May 1945 (4 days before VE Day) before the royal family and many military notables. This was at a private function at the Life Guards barracks in Windsor. It was not publicised in the newspapers due to security concerns. Hay&#x27;s character during his radio series was called Dr Muffin, a name chosen so that the students could mock him with the name &quot;Old Crumpet&quot;.

==Astronomy==
In June 1932 he joined the British Astronomical Association, in November of the same year he became a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. He is noted for having discovered a Great White Spot on the planet Saturn in 1933.

Hay kept his career in astronomy separate from his comedy career and published &quot;Through My Telescope&quot; under the name of W.T. Hay, using the same title when giving lectures on astronomy. Hay was an advocate for education on astronomy and considered those who had an interest in astronomy &quot;the only men who see life in its true proportion&quot;. In a 1933 interview with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; he stated &quot;If we were all astronomers, there&#x27;d be no more war.&quot; He was a friend of William Herbert Steavenson, who would go on to become the President of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1957.

Just before Hay died, a few items of his equipment were donated to the British Astronomical Association.

He also has an asteroid named in his honour - Asteroid 3125 Hay.

==Personal life==
In 1907 Hay married Gladys Perkins (1889–1982), whom he had known since he was 15. They legally separated on 18 November 1935. However, they never divorced and Gladys cited the reason for this was that she was a Roman Catholic. They had two daughters and a son: Gladys Elspeth Hay (1909–1979), William Edward Hay (1913–1995) and Joan Athol Hay (1917–1975). Following his separation from Gladys in 1935, he was in a long-term relationship with Randi Kopstad, a native of Norway.

Off-screen, Hay was described as being something of an eccentric, and a very serious and private man, and some thought he may have had a dark side due to his demeanour. Peter Ustinov, who made his film debut in &quot;The Goose Steps Out&quot; as a straight man to Hay, said in a 1990 interview when asked about working with him &quot;Well, Will Hay wasn&#x27;t very funny but I found that very few comics are&quot;; he also said &quot;And Will Hay was always wrapped in a blanket at certain hours and had his tea, and we all stopped talking while he was having his tea, and then we went on shooting. I don&#x27;t remember him saying anything memorable, nothing I could remember at all. He was very funny when you saw him on the screen, but in life all those people are very, very strange.&quot;

He was known to be a hypochondriac, and would often complain of illness to his colleagues when working.

Hay was a passionate aviator, and gave flying lessons to Amy Johnson.

In 1946 while on holiday, Hay suffered a stroke which left the right side of his body crippled and also affected his speech. He was told by his doctors that he would in all likelihood only make a partial recovery. Following his stroke, he spent time in South Africa on the advice of his doctors, because of the climate. His health had improved slightly by the following year, when he had plans to become a film producer but, in 1947, his friend Marcel Varnel, who had directed many of Hay&#x27;s films, died in a car accident, and Hay postponed his plans.

==Death==
He made his last public appearance on Good Friday (15 April) 1949. Hay died at the age of 60 on 18 April 1949 after suffering a stroke at his flat in Chelsea, London. His body was buried in Streatham Park Cemetery in London. Those who were present at Hay&#x27;s final appearance described him as showing no sign of illness, and said he had discussed his plans for the future.

==Influences==
Comedians who have cited Hay as an influence include Ken Dodd, Eric Morecambe, Tommy Cooper, Harry Worth, Harry Enfield, Jimmy Perry and David Croft. Ronnie Barker also cited Hay as an influence, and in 1976 hosted a documentary on BBC Radio that discussed Hay&#x27;s life and career.

==Legacy==

&#x27;The Will Hay Appreciation Society&#x27; was founded in 2009 by British artist Tom Marshall and aims to preserve Hay&#x27;s legacy and bring his work to a new generation of fans. As of October 2023, the organisation has over 8000 members. &quot;The Will Hay Appreciation Society&quot; unveiled a memorial bench to Will Hay, Moore Marriott and Graham Moffatt in October 2018, in Cliddesden, Hampshire, the filming location for &#x27;Buggleskelly&#x27; in &quot;Oh, Mr Porter!&quot;. The bench was unveiled by Pete Waterman.

The humour of Hay&#x27;s films has been described as subversive and similar to that of fellow English comedian Frank Randle. His films are often characterised as exhibiting traits of anti-authoritarianism and having a satirical approach towards how authority figures are portrayed. This is notable with Hay himself, who often played an incompetent authority figure who struggled not to be found out, but whose idiocy was discovered by those around him.

In 2009 a biography of Hay by Graham Rinaldi was published with a foreword by Ken Dodd. Hay never published an autobiography during his lifetime; however, when ill in the 1940s, he had begun writing one, entitled &quot;I Enjoyed Every Minute&quot;. Excerpts from this unpublished autobiography were included in the 2009 book.

Roy Hudd defined Hay as the &quot;supreme master&quot; of sketch comedy.

<doc id="520490" wikidata="Q122714" url="?curid=520490" title="Hydroplane (boat)">
<text>A hydroplane (or hydro, or &quot;thunderboat&quot;) is a fast motorboat, where the hull shape is such that at speed, the weight of the boat is supported by planing forces, rather than simple buoyancy.

A key aspect of hydroplanes is that they use the water they are on for lift rather than buoyancy, as well as for propulsion and steering: when travelling at high speed water is forced downwards by the bottom of the boat&#x27;s hull. The water therefore exerts an equal and opposite force upwards, lifting the vast majority of the hull out of the water. This process, happening at the surface of the water, is known as &#x27;foiling&#x27;.

==Hydroplane design==
Early designs of the 1920s were often built by amateurs, who employed the lightest materials available to them at the time, which were often glued timber boarding or plywood on the floor, plywood topsides, and varnished canvas decks. Most were about long and stepped hulls were employed with a step to induce air under the hull, to enable the boat to float on air bubbles. The principle behind &#x27;planing&#x27; was not fully understood. Thus, hulls were flat bottomed with an upward curve at the bow and the step of the way aft. The sheer weight of a 100 hp. engine was enough to keep the bow from digging in. In Ireland the sport was managed by the Motor Yacht Club of Ireland which had a base at the Lough Ree Yacht Club near Athlone.

One of the earliest examples can be seen in the May 1935 &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; issue. &quot;Mile A Minute-Thrills of the Water&quot; tells the story of the &quot;No-Vac&quot; by LeRoy F. Malrose Sr. aka. Fred W. McQuigg (pen name). Malrose was the lead design illustrator for &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; magazine, which at the time was located in Chicago. The &quot;No-Vac&quot; design and build actually began in 1933, when Malrose conceptualized an airfoil hull surface design which proved to produce far less drag than conventional &quot;V&quot; style boat hull designs of the time. In June 1933 the &quot;No-Vac&quot; was put to the test with professional racing driver Jimmy Rodgers at the helm. That day the &quot;No-Vac&quot; set the world water speed record for an outboard powered boat of .

The basic hull design of most hydroplanes has remained relatively unchanged since the 1950s: two sponsons in front, one on each side of the bow; behind the wide bow, is a narrower, mostly rectangular section housing the driver, engine, and steering equipment. The aft part of the vessel is supported in the water by the lower half of the propeller, which is designed to operate semi-submerged at all times. The goal is to keep as little of the boat in contact with the water as possible, as water is much denser than air, exerting more drag on the vehicle. Essentially the boat &#x27;flies&#x27; over the surface of the water rather than actually traveling through it.

One of the few significant attempts at a radically different design since the three-point propriding design was introduced was referred to as &quot;Canard&quot;. It reversed the width properties, having a very narrow bow that only touched the water in one place, and two small outrigger sponsons in the back.

Early hydroplanes had mostly straight lines and flat surfaces aside from the uniformly curved bow and sponsons. The curved bow was eventually replaced by what is known as a &quot;pickle fork&quot; bow, where a space is left between the front few feet of the sponsons. Also, the centered single, vertical tail (similar to the ones on most modern airplanes) was gradually replaced by a horizontal stabilizer supported by vertical tails on either side of the boat. Later, as fine-tuning the hydrodynamics became more important, the bottoms of the main hull have subtle curves to give the best lift.

== Unlimited hydroplane engines ==
The aviation industry has been the main source of engines for the boats. For the first few decades after World War II, they used surplus World War II-era internal-combustion airplane engines, typically Rolls-Royce Merlins or Griffons, or Allison V-1710s, all liquid-cooled V-12s. The loud roar of these engines earned hydroplanes the nickname &quot;thunderboats&quot; or &quot;dinoboats&quot;.

The Ted Jones-designed &quot;Slo-Mo-Shun IV&quot; three-point, Allison-powered hydroplane set the water speed record (160.323 mph) in Lake Washington, off Seattle, Washington&#x27;s Sand Point, on June 26, 1950, breaking the previous (ten-plus-year-old) record ( by almost . Donald Campbell set seven world water speed records between 1955 and 1964 in the jet engine hydroplane, &quot;Bluebird&quot;.

Starting in 1980, they have increasingly used Vietnam War-era turboshaft engines from helicopters (in 1973–1974, one hydroplane, &quot;U-95&quot;, used turbine engines in races to test the technology). The most commonly used turbine is the Lycoming T55, used in the CH-47 Chinook.

Efforts have occasionally been made to use automotive engines, but they generally have not proven competitive.

The &quot;limited&quot; classes of inboard hydroplane racing are organized under the name Inboard Powerboat Circuit. These classes utilize automotive power, as well as two-stroke power. There are races throughout the country from April to October. Many Unlimited drivers got their start in the &quot;limited&quot; classes.

Prior to 1977, every official water speed record had been set by an American, Briton, Irishman or Canadian. On November 20, Australian Ken Warby piloted his &quot;Spirit of Australia&quot; purely on the jet thrust of its Westinghouse J34 turbojet to a velocity of to beat Lee Taylor&#x27;s record. Warby, who had built the craft in his back yard, used the publicity to find sponsorship to pay for improvements to the &quot;Spirit&quot;. On October 8, 1978, Warby travelled to Blowering Dam, Australia, and broke both the and barriers with an average speed of .

As of 2018, Warby&#x27;s record still stands, and there have only been two official attempts to break it.

<text>604 Records (stylized as VIOIV Records) is a music production company. It is named after area code 604 of the Lower Mainland, where the company&#x27;s offices are located.

==History==
The company was co-founded by Nickelback lead singer Chad Kroeger and attorney Jonathan Simkin, founder of Simkin Artist Management, in 2001, and launched in 2002. Their records are distributed in Canada by Warner Music Group.

Simkin launched the companion label Light Organ Records in 2010 to release music by indie rock bands who he felt did not fit with 604&#x27;s image.

In 2014, mainly due to the revenue from the success of Carly Rae Jepsen&#x27;s Call Me Maybe, 604 Records relocated to a larger office and opened 604 Studios, a multimedia production facility featuring two recording studios, soundstage and in-house production team.

In March 2022, the company announced plans to launch an NFT platform.

<doc id="520495" wikidata="Q44821" url="?curid=520495" title="Santa Cruz Province, Argentina">
<text>Santa Cruz Province (, , &quot;Holy Cross&quot;) is a province of Argentina, located in the southern part of the country, in Patagonia. It borders Chubut Province to the north, and Chile to the west and south, with the Atlantic coast to the east. Santa Cruz is the second-largest province of the country (after Buenos Aires Province), and the least densely populated in mainland Argentina.

The indigenous people of the province are the Tehuelches, who despite European exploration from the 16th century onwards, retained independence until the late 19th century. Soon after the Conquest of the Desert in the 1870s, the area was organised as the Territory of Santa Cruz, named after its original capital in Puerto Santa Cruz. The capital moved to Rio Gallegos in 1888 and has remained there ever since. Immigrants from various European countries came to the territory in the late 19th and early 20th century during a gold rush. Santa Cruz became a province of Argentina in 1957.

==History==
The Tehuelches inhabited these lands before the arrivals of the Spanish colonisation. In 1520 Ferdinand Magellan arrived to what is currently known as &quot;San Julián Bay&quot;.
15 years later Martín de Alcazaba explored the area near the Chico River, which he named Gallegos River. Because of the attacks of British privateers, and after the visit of Francis Drake in 1578, the Spaniards sent Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa to fortify and map the Strait of Magellan and prevent access to Spanish posts in the Pacific.

In the middle of the 18th century, the Jesuits settled in the area, establishing a few missions. When the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata was created in 1776, the region was set under the rule of Buenos Aires. Antonio de Biedma founded &quot;Nueva Colonia&quot; near present Puerto Deseado and &quot;Floridablanca&quot; not far from Puerto San Julián, both of them shut down later by Viceroy Vertíz.

Between 1825 and 1836 there were a series of explorations of the regions, including that of Charles Darwin in 1834. In 1860 commander Luis Piedrabuena established a base on Isla Pavón in the estuary of Puerto Deseado.

In 1878 the Government of Patagonia was created, with capital in Viedma, but six years later it was split into smaller entities, with the territory declared &quot;National Government of Santa Cruz&quot;, whose capital was the city of Santa Cruz. In 1901 the capital was moved to its current location at the city of Río Gallegos.

At the beginning of the 20th century, a large European immigration began to arrive to the almost uninhabited zone; Spanish, Germans, British and Slavs were the most numerous among them. They came mainly to escape the growing conflicts of World War I, and were attracted by the wool industry of the area. The beginning of the war meant a sharp reduction in the amount of exports, bringing a serious economic crisis to Santa Cruz.
The ideals of progressivism, brought by the Spanish immigrants, grew among the workers who, working in Santa Cruz&#x27;s harsh environment under often sub-human conditions, decided to strike in 1922. The strike was severely and harshly repressed by the government, culminating in the events of the &quot;Patagonia Trágica&quot; (&quot;Tragic Patagonia&quot;), the execution of dozens of strikers.

In 1944, the &quot;Military zone of Comodoro Rivadavia&quot; was created, which encompassed the northern part of the &quot;National Government of Santa Cruz&quot; and the southern part of Chubut Province. This jurisdiction lasted until the abolition of the measures in 1955. The Territory of Santa Cruz acquired province status in 1957. 

In 1973, voters in Santa Cruz elected Jorge Cepernic, a Peronist. An advocate of labor rights, Gov. Cepernic worked with film maker Osvaldo Bayer to make &quot;&quot; (&#x27;&quot;Rebellion in Patagonia&quot;), a documentary drama on the ill-fated 1922 sheep ranch laborers&#x27; strike. For this, Gov. Cepernic was imprisoned following the March 1976 coup.

The return to democracy in Argentina in 1983 brought new, mostly young leadership to Santa Cruz&#x27;s elected posts, among them a well-known local country lawyer named Néstor Kirchner, elected that year to the Río Gallegos City Council. Elected mayor in 1987 and governor in 1991, Kirchner helped negotiate a US$535 million payout for his province following the 1993 privatization of the state-owned oil concern YPF. Earning plaudits for his careful administration of the funds, Kirchner was elected president of Argentina in April 2003, following the withdrawal of Carlos Menem from a runoff which Kirchner was projected to win handily.

Presiding over four years of expansion totalling 42% (the best performance for the Argentine economy since the 1880s), Pres. Kirchner steered record spending into public works (particularly those in his province, as is customary for Argentine presidents).

 In the Province there is a border dispute with Chile in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, in 1898 the border was defined and wasn&#x27;t objected during the 1902 Arbitral award of the Andes which defined most of the border on the current Province territory. Both experts, Francisco Pascasio Moreno from Argentina and Diego Barros Arana from Chile agreed on the border between Mount Fitz Roy and Cerro Daudet. However the border started being questioned by Argentina later on which started the dispute between both countries. In 1998 a border redraw is agreed, being pending to this day the part between Mount Fitz Roy and Cerro Murallón, however a new border was drawn between Cerro Murallón and Cerro Daudet.

In the 20th century both countries had another dispute over the Del Desierto Lake which was resolved in favor of Argentina in 1994 and had its climax in 1965 when Lieutenant Hernán Merino Correa was killed by Argentine Gendarmerie.

==Geography==

The province is generally divided into 2 distinct regions: The Andes in the west and the plateaus in the centre and east. In the Andes, there are numerous lakes such as Buenos Aires Lake (2,240 km2, 881 km2 in Argentina), Cardiel Lake (460 km2), Viedma Lake (1,082 km2), Argentino Lake (1,560 km2), Pueyrredón Lake, Belgrano Lake and San Martín Lake (1,013 km2). One characteristic of the Andean region is the presence of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field that covers the central part of the Andes.

From the centre to the Atlantic coast in the east, the landscape is dominated by plateaus. These plateaus are made up of basalt rock occur in stepped sequences. The plateaus are of different ages with the older –of Neogene and Paleogene age– being located at higher elevations than Pleistocene and Holocene lava plateaus and outcrops. There are isolated pockets of hills and depressions within this region. In &quot;Gran Bajo de San Julián&quot;, the &quot;Laguna del Carbón&quot; is 105 meters below sea level, and is the lowest point in the Western and Southern Hemispheres. On the Atlantic coast, it is characterised by cliffs.

===Hydrography===
The main rivers in the province are the Deseado River (), Chico River (), Santa Cruz River (), Coig River (), and the Gallegos River (). These rivers all originate from the Andes which then drain into the lakes before moving eastwards to empty into the Atlantic Ocean.

===Climate===
The Andes block most of the incoming frontal systems and as a result, most of the rainfall occurs in the western side of the mountains, with precipitation rapidly decreasing eastward. As a result, except for the westernmost parts of the province where precipitation is abundant and under more influence from the Pacific, much of the province is dry. Unlike the Northern Hemisphere where there are large land masses to allow cold temperatures, cold fronts, which usually originate from the southwest and move northeast are moderated by the Pacific Ocean, resulting in less intense cold temperatures. Similar to much of Patagonia, the climate of the province is characterized by strong westerlies, which also enhances evapotranspiration. In general, the southern parts of the province are colder than the north.

====Temperatures====
The mean temperatures for the province are relatively cold for its latitude due to the cold Falkland Current. The extreme northeast coast is by far the mildest area, with annual temperatures around with temperatures inland being 1 °C to 2 °C lower. The coldest temperatures are found in the southern parts of the province with an annual mean of although in the western parts of the province which are at higher altitudes, the mean can be below and even below at the highest elevations. In the summer, mean temperatures range from in the North to around in the south. However, temperatures can reach up to in all parts of the province except at the highest elevations. Winters are cold throughout the province, with more uniform temperatures than during the summer; July temperatures average in the North to in the southern parts. Temperatures can plummet below in the interior while at the coast, it infrequently drops below .

====Precipitation====
Owing to the Andes, they block most of the incoming frontal systems and as a result, most of the rainfall occurs in the western side of the Andes, in which precipitation rapidly decreases eastward. Much of the province receives less than of precipitation a year while in the Andean region which is under more influence from the Pacific, it can receive more than . Precipitation mainly falls in the form of light rain with heavy rain and thunderstorms being rare, with these two only occurring during the summer. In all parts of the province, more precipitation occurs in the winter than in the summer.

====Wind====
The prevalent wind directions are from the west, southwest and northwest and together, these occur 60% of the time. Northern parts of the province tend to have more northwest winds than the southern parts of the province. With few landmasses south of 46°S, the province is dominated by strong winds throughout the year. Summers are windier than winters. The strongest winds are found in the Andean region while the weakest are found in the coastal areas. With a mean wind speed of , the province is the windiest in Argentina. Gusts can reach up to in some places.

====Sunshine==== 
Although most of the province is dry, the province is relatively cloudy. The percent of cloudy days ranges from 50% in the north to 60% in the south. Average daily sunshine hours range from 6 hours/day in the North to 4 hours/day in the south with the lowest in the coastal areas in the south.

====Statistics====

== Demographics ==

According to the 2022 Argentine national census, the Province of Santa Cruz has 333,473 inhabitants.

==Economy==

Santa Cruz, with a small population and rich in natural resources, has long had one of Argentina&#x27;s most prosperous economies. Its 2006 output was estimated at US$3.3 billion or a per capita income of US$16,553. In 2011 Santa Cruz had the highest per capita income of Argentina, US$36,550.

Its economy, with the possible exception of Neuquen&#x27;s, is the country&#x27;s least diversified, however. Fully half its output is accounted for by the extractive sector (petroleum, gas and mining), with an annual production of 4.5 million m3 of petroleum and 3 million m3 of gas, mainly in the &quot;Pico Truncado&quot;, &quot;Cañadón seco&quot; and &quot;Cerro Redondo&quot; extracting facilities. Cerro Negro mine by Gold Corp. has in recent years contributed to the growth of population of Santa Cruz through its Gold mining operations and subsidies to local public education and private sector.

The coal production at &quot;Río Turbio&quot;, Argentina&#x27;s only active coal mine, is of around one million m3 per year. Mining includes gold (&quot;Cerro Vanguardia Mine&quot;), clay, gypsum, salt and others.

The second most important productive activity is that associated with sheep. With 7 million heads, Santa Cruz is the second main producer of wool and meat after the Province of Chubut, most of which is designated for export. Sheep farming revived in 2002 with the devaluation of the peso and firmer global demand for wool (led by China and the EU). Still there is little investment in new abattoirs (mainly in Rio Gallegos), and often there are phytosanitary restrictions to the export of sheep meat. Livestock also includes small numbers of cattle, and in lesser numbers pigs and horses.

Sea fishing, and its later industrialization at the fishing ports of Puerto Deseado, Puerto San Julián, Puerto Santa Cruz and Río Gallegos produces prawn, squid, hake and dozens of others. Most of the production is frozen and exported.

There is little agriculture due to the arid nature of the soil. There is a small timber industry fed by both forests and planted trees, of which the wood of the lenga is the most exploited.

==Tourism==

Santa Cruz&#x27;s most visited destination is Los Glaciares National Park and a number of glaciers of which the Perito Moreno Glacier is the most famous. Nearby El Calafate has an airport that connects the area with Buenos Aires and Trelew.

Some 200 kilometres north of El Calafate is the village of El Chaltén at the feet of the Cerro Torre and Mount Fitz Roy. Still not very developed, El Chaltén serves as a hub for various trekking routes including walks on the Viedma Glacier.

600 kilometres further north of El Chaltén, by the dirt road Ruta 40, the Cueva de las Manos near the town of Perito Moreno allows the few tourists who venture to this point to see the prehistoric wall paintings in the caves near the Pinturas River.

Perito Moreno National Park and its lakes, north of Los Glaciares, are rarely visited. Besides trekking, other sports practised on the west side of the province are sport fishing, rafting and climbing.

In the east, the National Route 3 follows the Atlantic coastline, by which buses connect the coastal cities, and take passengers both south to Tierra del Fuego and north to Chubut Province and Buenos Aires. The most visited places are the cities of Río Gallegos, the Bosques Petrificados National Monument petrified forest, and the depression of &quot;Laguna del Carbón&quot; near Puerto San Julián.

== Government ==
The provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution of Santa Cruz Province, Argentina forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Santa Cruz Provincial Police.

==Political division==

The province is divided into the following 7 departments:

Department (Capital)

# Corpen Aike (Puerto Santa Cruz)
# Deseado Department (Puerto Deseado)
# Güer Aike (Río Gallegos)
# Lago Argentino (El Calafate)
# Lago Buenos Aires (Perito Moreno)
# Magallanes (Puerto San Julián)
# Río Chico (Gobernador Gregores)

==Sports==
&quot;Boxing Club de Río Gallegos&quot; is the only side that competes in national leagues. The club currently plays in the &quot;Torneo Federal B&quot;, the regionalized fourth-tier in Argentine football league system. At the 2015 season it reached the second phase.

<text>Villa Park is a football stadium in Aston, Birmingham, with a seating capacity of 42,785. It has been the home of Premier League club Aston Villa since 1897. The ground is less than a mile from both Witton and Aston railway stations and has hosted sixteen England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899 and the most recent in 2005. Villa Park has hosted 55 FA Cup semi-finals, more than any other stadium, and it is the 10th largest in England.

In 1897, Aston Villa moved into the Aston Lower Grounds, a sports ground in a Victorian amusement park in the former grounds of Aston Hall, a Jacobean stately home. The stadium has gone through various stages of renovation and development, resulting in the current stand configuration of the Holte End, Trinity Road Stand, North Stand and Doug Ellis Stand.

Before 1914, a cycling track ran around the perimeter of the pitch where regular cycling meetings were hosted as well as athletic events. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen various concerts staged along with other sporting events including boxing matches and international rugby league and rugby union matches. In 1999, the last final of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup took place at Villa Park. Villa Park also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, as Wembley Stadium was in use for the final of the Olympic football tournament.

Aston Villa have plans to redevelop the North Stand: this would increase the capacity of Villa Park from 42,785 to 52,500. Such plans also include the construction of an accompanying commercial and entertainment venue dubbed &quot;Villa Live&quot;. In December 2022, the plans were approved by Birmingham City Council. The renovations were planned to be completed by UEFA Euro 2028. However, in December 2023, President of Football Operations Chris Heck announced that the redevelopment plans had been indefinitely postponed.

==History==
Villa Park, formerly part of Aston Lower Grounds, was not the first home of Aston Villa F.C. Their previous venue, Wellington Road, faced increasing problems including an uneven pitch, poor spectator facilities, a lack of access and exorbitant rents. As a result, in 1894 Villa&#x27;s committee, led by Frederick Rinder began negotiations with the owners of the Aston Lower Grounds, &quot;the finest sports ground in the district.&quot; Situated in the former grounds of Aston Hall, a Jacobean stately home, the Lower Grounds had seen varied uses over the years.

Originally the kitchen garden of Aston Hall&#x27;s owner Sir Thomas Holte, after whom the Holte End stand was named, the Lower Grounds later became a Victorian amusement park with an aquarium and a great hall. The current pitch stands on the site of the Dovehouse Pool, an ornamental pond that was drained in 1889. In place of the pool, the owners of the Lower Grounds built a cycle track and sports ground that opened on 10 June 1889 for a combined cycling and athletics event before a crowd of 15,000. Negotiations continued for two years before the Villa committee reached agreement with the site&#x27;s owner, Edgar Flower, to rent the site for £300 per annum on a 21-year lease with an option to buy it at any point during the term.

Much of the credit for the design of Villa Park must to go to Villa Chairman Frederick Rinder, who as a trained Surveyor, is said to have laid down every &#x27;level and line&#x27; of the ground himself before construction began. The committee immediately engaged an architect who began preparing plans for the site, which included construction of a new cement cycle track to replace the existing cinder one. The main stand was to be built to the east on the Witton Lane side, with the track and pitch fully enclosed by banking. Construction of the final phase of the stadium began in late 1896 after negotiations with contractors over the price. Several months behind schedule, the almost-complete stadium opened with a friendly against Blackburn Rovers on 17 April 1897, which ended as a 3–0 win, one week after Aston Villa had completed the League and FA Cup &#x27;Double&#x27;. The process of fixing issues with the building work continued for several months. As built, the stadium could house 40,000 spectators, most of whom stood in the open on the banking.
After winning the league championship in 1899, Villa&#x27;s record-breaking average crowd of 21,000 allowed the club to invest in a two-stage ground improvement programme. The first stage extended the terrace covering on the Trinity Road side at the cost of £887; the second cost £1,300 and involved re-laying all terracing around the track to remedy a design flaw that caused poor sightlines for the majority of the crowd. In 1911, Villa bought the freehold of the ground for £8,250, the office buildings in the old aquarium and car park area for £1,500 and the carriage drive and bowling green for £2,000. This was the first stage in plans drawn up by Villa director Frederick Rinder that saw the capacity of Villa Park increased to 104,000.

In June 1914, another phase of enhancements began at Villa Park to compete with improvements at other grounds around the country, including Everton&#x27;s Goodison Park, where a new two-tiered stand had just been completed. The first stage of improvements saw the cycling track removed, new banking at the Holte Hotel End (Holte End), and a re-profiling of all the terracing to bring it closer to the newly squared-off pitch. Rinder turned to the renowned architect Archibald Leitch to design a new Villa Park. Their joint plans included large banked end stands at the Holte and Witton ends and the incorporation of the original Victorian Lower Grounds buildings, including the aquarium and the newly acquired bowling greens. The outbreak of the First World War severely hampered design and construction efforts.
As a result of inflation, 1919 quotes for the implementation of the pre-war construction plans came to £66,000, compared to the 1914 quote of £27,000. By March 1922 this price had reduced to £41,775, and the directors pushed ahead with the plans for the new Trinity Road Stand. Construction began in April 1922 with the stand partially opened in August. Construction continued throughout the 1922–1923 season, with the stand officially opened on 26 January 1924 by the then Duke of York, later King George VI. He commented to Rinder that he had &quot;no idea that a ground so finely equipped in every way—and devoted to football—existed.&quot;

On completion the Trinity Road Stand was considered one of the grandest in Britain, complete with stained glass windows, Italian mosaics, Dutch gables in the style of Aston Hall and a sweeping staircase. The Oak Room in the Trinity Road stand was the first restaurant at a British football ground. Several commentators including Simon Inglis consider it to be Leitch&#x27;s masterpiece; a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reporter described it in 1960 as the &quot;St Pancras of football.&quot; The final cost of the stand and associated 1922–1924 ground developments was calculated at £89,000, a sum that enraged the club&#x27;s directors who ordered an investigation into cost and in 1925 forced Rinder&#x27;s resignation.
Villa Park remained in much the same state for another 30 years, with no major developments until the late 1950s. During the 1930s the earth and timber terraces with wooden crash barriers were completely replaced by concrete terracing and metal barriers, a process first begun by Rinder. In 1936 he was voted back onto the board at the age of 78 after the club were relegated to the Second Division. Nearly 25 years after he had created his 1914 masterplan, Rinder resurrected it and looked to carry out the third phase of his developments. He died in December 1938 (Leitch had died in April), leaving his construction business to his son, Archibald Junior.

The complete redevelopment and extension of the Holte End began in early 1939, supervised by Archibald Junior. When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, all construction across the country stopped. Unusually, given the austerity measures in place at the time, Villa acquired a special permit to continue construction of the Holte End; Simon Inglis notes &quot;How they achieved this is not recorded&quot;. Work on the ground was completed by April 1940, and the stand was immediately mothballed as Villa Park switched to its wartime role. The Trinity Road Stand became an air-raid shelter and ammunition store while the home dressing room became the temporary home of a rifle company from the 9th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment. German bombs caused £20,000 worth of damage to the Witton Lane Stand, which was remedied by 1954.

In the late 1950s, four projects were announced. The old Bowling Green pavilion on the Trinity Road became a medical centre, the basement of the aquarium building was converted into a gym, four large floodlight pylons were installed, and a training ground was purchased from Villa Park. The floodlights were first used in November 1958 for a friendly match against the Scottish side Heart of Midlothian.

In mid-1962, £40,000 was spent on a roof for the Holte End, the first to provide cover for the ordinary terrace fans at Villa Park since 1922. The old barrel-shaped roof on the Witton Lane Stand, the only remaining feature of the 1897 Villa Park, was removed in the summer of 1963 and replaced with a plain sloping roof in the same style as the Holte End. Villa Park was chosen by FIFA to host three matches for the 1966 World Cup on the condition that the Witton Lane Stand became all-seater. The players&#x27; tunnel had to be covered with a cage while the pitch was widened by .

Regular ground developments and innovations began from 1969 under the direction of the new chairman, Doug Ellis, who set about redeveloping Villa Park for the modern era. Much of the stadium had fallen into disrepair and was in need of modernisation; Villa&#x27;s attendances and financial situation had also declined as a result of losing their First Division status in 1967 and going down to the Third Division for the first time in 1970. Ellis updated the infrastructure, installed a new public address system, carried out plumbing work which included installing new toilets, resurfaced the terraces, and built a new ticket office. His tenure saw executive lounges replace the old offices in the Trinity Road Stand.

Redevelopment of the Witton End stand began in the summer of 1976, a year after Villa returned to the First Division after eight years away. The stand had not seen any major work since 1924, and its rear remained a mound of earth. Initial renovations saw the levelling of the earth and new concrete terraces constructed on the lower tier in preparation for the construction of an upper tier. Stage two began in February 1977 and was officially opened in late October. The stand&#x27;s design and fittings were impressive for the time, including novelties such as an &#x27;AV&#x27; logo spelled out in coloured seats and a double row of executive boxes.

As well as the new Witton End stand, renamed the North Stand, Villa Park went through further renovations throughout the ground. The cost of the work was £1.3 million. As a result, and as with the construction of the Trinity Road Stand fifty years earlier, Villa were again burdened with debt. An internal investigation found that £700,000 of the £1.3 million worth of bills were unaccounted for. A later report by accountants Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells found that the bills were inflated by only 10% but that there were &quot;serious breaches of recommended codes of practice and poor site supervision&quot;.
In response to the Hillsborough disaster which resulted in 96 fatalities, the Taylor Report of January 1990 recommended that all major grounds be converted to become all-seater as a safety measure by August 1994. Within a few months of the Taylor Report being published, the first changes were made in line with the report. The North Stand saw the addition of 2,900 seats to the lower tier of the stand in place of terracing, the Holte End&#x27;s roof was extended in preparation for more seats, the Trinity Road Stand had its roof replaced, and the Witton Lane Stand had more corporate boxes added. By that time, all four floodlight pylons had been removed to make way for boxes or in preparation for seating, and new floodlights were installed on new gantries on the Trinity and Witton stands.

In February 1992, the club&#x27;s application to the council for permission to demolish the Holte Hotel was rejected. After several months of negotiations, Villa gained permission for a new stand to replace the Witton Lane Stand. The new design meant that the club had to realign Witton Lane and, as a condition of the planning permission, pay £600,000 to compulsory purchase the houses along Witton Lane and upgrade the road from a B to an A road, as well as moving its utilities. The stand was fully operational by January 1994 at the cost of £5 million with 4,686 seats, which brought Villa Park up to a capacity of 46,005. It was announced at the 70th birthday gala of chairman Doug Ellis that the stand was to be renamed the &quot;Doug Ellis Stand&quot;, a move that caused some controversy among Villa fans with some still referring to it as the Witton Lane Stand. Nevertheless, during the 1993–94 season, the newly rebuilt Witton Lane Stand became the Doug Ellis Stand.

The Holte End was the only remaining stand that did not meet the Taylor Report requirements, and a structural survey revealed that putting seats onto the existing terracing would be uneconomical. Instead, the decision was taken to build a new stand consisting of two tiers, just four years after construction of the new roof. The demolition of the stand began on the last day of the 1993–94 season. Its replacement began to open in August 1994 with 3,000 seats in the lower tier occupied for the first seating-only game at Villa Park. By December it was fully operational and had a capacity of 13,501 seats, bringing the Villa Park capacity to 40,310. Upon completion, the Holte was the largest single end stand in Britain.

The next development at Villa Park was the Trinity Road Stand in 2000. It had stood since 1922 and seen several renovations and additions. The demolition of the old stand began after the last game of the 1999–2000 season, an event met with an element of sadness from observers such as Simon Inglis who stated that &quot;the landscape of English football will never be the same.&quot; The new stand was larger than the old one, taking Villa&#x27;s capacity from 39,399 to its present 42,682. It was officially opened in November 2001 by Prince Charles; his grandfather George VI had opened the old stand, 77 years earlier, when he was still the Duke of York.

==Structure and facilities==

Villa Park has 42,682 seats, split between four stands. These four stands are the Holte End to the south, the Trinity Road Stand to the west, the Doug Ellis Stand opposite the Trinity Road Stand, and the North Stand behind the northern goal. All of the stands have two tiers except the Trinity Road Stand, which has three.

The Holte End is a large two-tiered stand at the south end of the stadium. Originally a large terraced banking with accommodation for more than 20,000 spectators, the current stand was constructed in 1994–1995 and consists of two tiers with no executive boxes. The two tiers are slightly curved in a parabola to provide good sightlines from all seats. Inside there are three levels of concourse and the Holte Suite, a large hospitality room for supporters. The roof is a variant of the &quot;King Truss&quot; system and the front third slopes slightly forward. Two large staircases, pediments, Dutch gables and a mosaic introduced in the 2007 season in the style of the old Trinity Road Stand make up the facade, itself inspired by Aston Hall. The Holte End is the most renowned stand at Villa Park amongst home and away team supporters. Traditionally, Villa&#x27;s most vocal and passionate supporters gather here, including members of Aston Villa hooligan firms.
Built in 2000, the main Trinity Road Stand is the most recently completed at Villa Park and houses the dressing rooms, club offices and director&#x27;s boxes. The stand is composed of three tiers with a row of executive boxes between the second and third tiers. Although much larger than the other stands, the stand has roughly the same roof level as the other three sides. The players&#x27; tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match are in the middle of the stand at pitch level. The press and the directors&#x27; VIP area are situated in the centre of the middle tier. The upper tiers of the stand extend over Trinity Road, the street that cuts behind the ground. Trinity Road passes through a tunnel formed by the Trinity Road Stand.
The oldest stand at Villa Park is the North Stand, formerly known as the Witton End, completed in 1977. It is a two-tiered stand, with a double row of 39 executive boxes running between the two tiers. Upper-tier seats are claret with &quot;AV&quot; written in blue; the lower tier consists of sky blue seats. The North Stand was &quot;the first major stand in Britain to use what is now broadly termed the &#x27;goalpost&#x27; structure.&quot; The facade of the stand is a &quot;textured concrete render&quot; typical of the time.

Since the segregation of supporters in the 1970s, away fans had been situated in the lower tier of the North Stand. Former manager Martin O&#x27;Neill expressed his desire to have Villa fans seated in the North Stand to improve the atmosphere at Villa Park. For the start of the 2007–2008 season the club released cut-price season tickets for the lower tier of the stand. This meant moving the away fans to the northern end of the Doug Ellis Stand across both tiers and since then the North Stand has been fully occupied by Villa supporters with the most vocal and fervent being housed in the lower tier.

The Doug Ellis Stand, formerly known as the Witton Lane Stand, is a two-tiered stand with a row of executive boxes between the tiers. The roof was originally planned to be a goalpost structure, the same as the Holte End and North Stand, but the plans were changed to a simpler cantilever design. It saw slight refurbishment before the 1996 European Championships to join the corners with the lower tier of the North Stand, improve legroom and increase the curve of the terracing to improve sightlines. The main television camera viewpoint is on the half-way line in the Doug Ellis Stand.

In the south-west corner, between the Holte End and the Trinity Road Stand, there is a three-storey pavilion-like structure, which is used for corporate hospitality. There is a large television screen. On 28 November 2009, a bronze statue of former Villa chairman and Football League founder William McGregor was unveiled outside the stadium. Behind the North Stand is the &quot;Villa Village&quot; made up of club and ticket offices as well as a club shop. The club bought the buildings from British Telecom in the 1990s. 

==Future==

Future redevelopment of Villa Park has been an ever-present topic, with previous owners of Aston Villa: notably Randy Lerner and Tony Xia, expressing support to increase capacity. However, no definitive redevelopment occurred in either case.

Under the current ownership of Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens, there has been concrete support for a long-term redevelopment of Villa Park. In December 2021, CEO Christian Purslow announced that redevelopment plans were forecasted to take &quot;two to ten years&quot;.

Preliminary plans to construct a new North Stand were announced in March 2022. Following a consultation process between June and September 2022, Aston Villa formally submitted plans to fully demolish and rebuild the North Stand, alongside developments to the Trinity Road Stand. The plans would see the construction of a new 13,074 capacity stand. Alongside minor seating adjustments to the Trinity Road Stand and Doug Ellis Stand, this would increase Villa Park&#x27;s capacity to approximately 50,065. Alongside these featured plans to develop a large indoor entertainment and retail venue called &quot;Villa Live&quot;, replacing the car park, academy building, and the current on-site retail store. This followed initial planning permission granted in 2019 to demolish the car park and academy building behind the North Stand. Within the aforementioned planning documents, Aston Villa alluded to potential further redevelopment via &#x27;configuration of the stands&#x27;, including the Doug Ellis Stand and the Holte End, to increase Villa Park&#x27;s capacity to between 52,000 and 53,000 at a later date. In December 2022, planning permission was granted by Birmingham City Council. However, in December 2023, President of Football Operations Chris Heck announced that plans to redevelop Villa Park had been paused.

==Other sporting uses==
Villa Park was the first English ground to stage international football in three centuries and has hosted matches in several international tournaments. Three 1966 World Cup matches were played at the ground and four matches during Euro &#x27;96. The ground has hosted England internationals, the first in 1899 and the most recent in 2005. Sixteen international matches have been hosted at the stadium in total.

Villa Park has been the venue for several Cup competitions. It has hosted 55 FA Cup semi-finals, more than any other stadium. The club hosted the League Cup Final in 1980–1981 when Liverpool beat West Ham 2–1 in a replay. In 1999, the stadium hosted the last final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in which Lazio beat Real Mallorca 2–1. During the construction of the new Wembley Stadium between 2001 and 2005, the FA Trophy Final was held at Villa Park. The 2012 Community Shield was held at Villa Park instead of Wembley due to Olympic Games at the stadium.

The venue has also hosted two first-class cricket matches. The first was the United North of England Eleven&#x27;s final first-class match against a London United Eleven in June 1879. The second was tour match played between Australia and an England XI side in May 1884. The ground also hosted a 1897 Minor Counties Championship match between Staffordshire and Northamptonshire and was the home ground for Aston Unity in the Birmingham and District Premier League from 1889 to 1954.

Many athletics and cycle events took place at the ground before the First World War, and boxing has been hosted on several occasions. On 28 June 1948, Dick Turpin, brother of Randolph Turpin, became the first non-white boxer to win a British title in a fight against Vince Hawkins in front of 40,000 spectators after the British Boxing Board of Control lifted their ban on non-whites challenging for titles. On 21 June 1972 Danny McAlinden defeated Jack Bodell in a British and Empire Heavyweight title fight.
Great Britain secured the first ever rugby league test series at the ground when they defeated the touring Australian Kangaroos side 6–5 on 14 February 1909 in front of a crowd of 9,000. A second rugby league game followed three years later on New Year&#x27;s Day 1912 when 4,000 people turned up to see Australia beat Great Britain 33–8. The stadium has seen several international rugby union tour matches. On 8 October 1924, a North Midlands XV lost 40–3 to the New Zealand side touring Europe and Canada at the time. The second game took place on 30 December 1953 when Midlands Counties played another New Zealand side on their 1953–1954 tour of United Kingdom, Ireland, France and North America. The Midlands side lost 18–3. On 26 August 1985, it played host to the first ever American football &quot;Summerbowl,&quot; intended to be the English equivalent to the Super Bowl. The game was played between the London Ravens and the Streatham Olympians, and the low attendance of 8,000 meant that the Summerbowl was not repeated in subsequent years.

Villa Park was originally listed as one of the six stadiums that would hold Olympic football matches in the 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2009 it was announced that the organising committee for the games and the football club had decided that uncertainty around expansion plans meant that the club were &quot;unable to commit fully to hosting matches&quot;.

Villa Park was chosen as the venue for two pool matches in the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The first was a Pool B match between South Africa and Samoa on 26 September 2015 with South Africa winning 46–6 with 39,526 in attendance. The second was a Pool A match between Australia and Uruguay the next day with Australia winning 65–3 in front of 39,605 spectators.

Birmingham hosted the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Though Villa Park was originally chosen to host the Rugby Sevens competition, the event was moved to the Ricoh Arena in Coventry. This was because the Premier League began in July while the games were on, in order to accommodate the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar at the end of the year.

==Non-sporting uses==
Villa Park has been a venue for musicians from multiple genres as well as preachers. The stadium has hosted several rock concerts, including Bruce Springsteen who played two concerts in June 1988 as part of his Tunnel of Love Tour, and again in June 2023 as part of his 2023 Tour, Bon Jovi in 2013 as part of the Because We Can: The Tour, and Pink in June 2023 during her Summer Carnival Tour. Duran Duran held a charity concert in 1983 to raise money for MENCAP. Other singers who have played at the ground include Belinda Carlisle, Rod Stewart and Robert Palmer. The American evangelist Billy Graham attracted 257,181 people to a series of prayer meetings held at the stadium in mid-1984. Archbishop Desmond Tutu held a religious gathering at the stadium in 1989.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that midwives from Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust would host maternity clinics at the ground, for expectant parents anxious about going into hospitals. From February 2021, Villa Park was used as a regional COVID-19 vaccination centre by the NHS. The vaccination centre was set up in the Holte End. Black Sabbath are set to perform a final concert called Back to the Beginning at the stadium on 5 July 2025.

==Average league attendances==
==Records==

The highest attendance recorded at Villa Park was 76,588, on 2 March 1946 in an FA Cup 6th round tie against Derby County. The highest attendance in the all-seater era was 42,824 for a Champions League game against Celtic on 29th January 2025. The highest attendance in a Premier League game was 42,788 on 29 December 2009 against Liverpool, but the overall record league attendance was 69,492 in a First Division match against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 27 December 1949. The highest average post-Second World War attendance at Villa Park was 47,168 in the 1948–1949 season; the lowest average post-war attendance was 15,237 in the 1985–1986 season.

Villa Park is within a short distance of two mainline railway stations. Witton railway station is approximately from Villa Park, and Aston railway station is approximately . Under former owner Randy Lerner, there have been discussions on changing the name of Witton Station to Villa Park as is the case with West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s local railway station, The Hawthorns. Aston Villa&#x27;s former CEO, Bruce Langham, has said that the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (Centro) are amenable to the idea as long as it is done at the expense of the club. No action has yet been taken.

The name &quot;koa&quot; in the Hawaiian language ultimately comes from Proto-Austronesian *&quot;teRas&quot; meaning &quot;core&quot; or &quot;ironwood&quot;; many names referring to certain ironwood or heartwood species in Southeast Asia and Oceania such as &quot;Vitex parviflora&quot; (&quot;tugás&quot; in Cebuano), &quot;Eusideroxylon zwageri&quot; (&quot;togas&quot; in Tombonuwo), and &quot;Intsia bijuga&quot; (&quot;dort&quot; in Palauan) descend from this root.

&quot;Koa&quot; also means brave, bold, fearless, or warrior.

==Description==
Koa is a large tree, typically attaining a height of and a spread of . In deep volcanic ash, a koa tree can reach a height of , a circumference of , and a spread of . It is one of the fastest-growing Hawaiian trees, capable of reaching in five years on a good site.

===Leaves===
Initially, bipinnately compound leaves with 12–24 pairs of leaflets grow on the koa plant, much like other members of the pea family. At about 6–9 months of age, however, thick sickle-shaped &quot;leaves&quot; that are not compound begin to grow. These are phyllodes, blades that develop as an expansion of the leaf petiole. The vertically flattened orientation of the phyllodes allows sunlight to pass to lower levels of the tree. True leaves are entirely replaced by long, wide phyllodes on an adult tree.

===Flowers===
Flowers of the koa tree are pale-yellow spherical racemes with a diameter of . Flowering may be seasonal or year round depending on the location.

===Fruit===
Fruit production start occurring when a koa tree is between 5 and 30 years old. The fruit are legumes, also called pods, with a length of and a width of . Each pod contains an average of 12 seeds. The long, wide seeds are flattened ellipsoids and range from dark brown to black in color. The pods are mature and ready for propagation after turning from green to brown or black. Seeds are covered with a hard seed coat, and this allows them to remain dormant for up to 25 years. Scarification is needed before &quot;A. koa&quot; seeds will germinate.

===Habitat===
Koa is endemic to the islands of Hawaii, Molokai, Maui, Lānai, Oahu, and Kauai, where it grows at elevations of . It requires of annual rainfall. Acidic to neutral soils (pH of 4–7.4) that are either an Inceptisol derived from volcanic ash or a well-drained histosol are preferred. Its ability to fix nitrogen allows it to grow in very young volcanic soils. Koa and ōhia lehua (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot;) dominate the canopy of Hawaiian mixed mesic forests. It is also common in wet forests.

==Uses==

The koa&#x27;s trunk was used by ancient Hawaiians to build &quot;waa&quot; (dugout outrigger canoes) and &quot;papa hee nalu&quot; (surfboards). Only &quot;paipo&quot; (bodyboards), &quot;kikoo&quot;, and &quot;alaia&quot; surfboards were made from koa, however; &quot;olo&quot;, the longest surfboards, were made from the lighter and more buoyant &quot;wiliwili&quot; (&quot;Erythrina sandwicensis&quot;). The reddish wood is very similar in strength and weight to that of Black Walnut (&quot;Juglans nigra&quot;), with a specific gravity of 0.55, and is now sought for use in wood carving and furniture. Koa is also a tonewood, often used in the construction of ukuleles, acoustic guitars, and Weissenborn-style Hawaiian steel guitars.
 B.C. Rich used koa on some of their electric guitars as well, and still uses a koa-veneered topwood on certain models. Fender made limited edition koa wood models of the Telecaster and the Stratocaster in 2006. Trey Anastasio, guitarist for the band Phish, primarily uses a koa hollowbody Languedoc guitar. Commercial silviculture of koa takes 20 to 25 years before a tree is of useful size. Taylor, Collings and Martin are few among the many other brands that use that tonewood for manufacturing acoustic guitars. 

==Relation to other species==
Among other Pacific Islands of volcanic (non-continental) origin, only Vanuatu has native &quot;Acacia&quot; species. &quot;A. heterophylla&quot;, from distant Réunion, is very similar and has been suggested to be the closest relative of koa. Genetic sequence analysis results announced in 2014 confirmed this close relationship; the estimated time of divergence is about 1.4 million years ago. &quot;A. heterophylla&quot; sequences nest within those of the more diverse &quot;A. koa&quot;, making the latter paraphyletic. Both species are thought to be descended from an ancestral species in Australia, presumably their sister species, &quot;Acacia melanoxylon&quot;. Dispersals most likely occurred via seed-carrying by birds such as petrels. Both species have very similar ecological niches, which differ from that of &quot;A. melanoxylon&quot;.

A closely related species, koaia or koaie (&quot;A. koaia&quot;), is found in dry areas. It is most easily distinguished by having smaller seeds that are arranged end-to-end in the pod, rather than side by side. The phyllodes are also usually straighter, though this character is variable in both species. The wood is denser, harder, and more finely grained than koa wood. Koaia has been much more heavily impacted by cattle and is now rare, but can be seen on ranch land in North Kohala.

==Conservation==
The koa population has suffered from grazing and logging. Many wet forest areas, where the largest koa grow, have been logged out, and it now comes largely from dead or dying trees or farms on private lands. Although formerly used for outrigger canoes, there are few koa remaining which are both large and straight enough to do so today. In areas where cattle are present, koa regeneration is almost completely suppressed. However, if the cattle are removed, koa are among the few native Hawaiian plants able to germinate in grassland, and can be instrumental in restoring native forest. It is often possible to begin reforestation in a pasture by disk harrowing the soil, as this scarifies seeds in the soil and encourages large numbers of koa to germinate. Experiments at the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge have shown that ōhia lehua (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot;) survives best in pasture when planted under koa. This is because koa trees reduce radiative cooling, preventing frost damage to ōhia lehua seedlings.

==Ecology==
Koa is the preferred host plant for the caterpillars of the green Hawaiian blue (&quot;Udara blackburni&quot;), which eat the flowers and fruits. Adults drink nectar from the flowers. Koa sap is eaten by the adult Kamehameha butterfly (&quot;Vanessa tameamea&quot;). The koa bug (&quot;Coleotichus blackburniae&quot;) uses its rostrum to suck the contents out of koa seeds. Koa is vulnerable to infection by koa wilt.

<text>Neuquén () is a province of Argentina, located in the west of the country, at the northern end of Patagonia. It borders Mendoza Province to the north, Rio Negro Province to the southeast, and Chile to the west. It also meets La Pampa Province at its northeast corner.

==History==
The Neuquén Province receives its name from the Neuquén River.
The term &quot;Neuquén&quot; derives from the Mapudungun a local dialect of the Mapuche language word &quot;Nehuenken&quot; meaning &quot;drafty&quot;, which the aborigines used for the river. The word (without the accentuation) is a palindrome.

Lácar Department in Neuquén Province has the southernmost known remains of maize before it was further diffused by the Inca Empire. Maize remains were found as far south as 40°19&#x27; S in Melinquina, with it being found inside pottery dated to 730 ±80 BP and 920 ±60 BP. This maize was probably brought across the Andes from Peru during the Inca Empire that also reached Chile.

Agriculture was practised in Pre-Hispanic Argentina as far south as southern Mendoza Province just north of Neuquén Province. Agriculture was at times practised beyond this limit in nearby areas of Patagonia but populations reverted at times to non-agricultural lifestyles. By the time of the Spanish arrival to the area (1550s) there is no record of agriculture being practised in northern Patagonia. The extensive Patagonian grasslands and an associated abundance of guanaco game may have contributed for the indigenous populations to favour a hunter-gathered lifestyle.

Inhabited by Tehuelches and Pehuenche at the time of European contact, the territory was initially explored by conquistadores coming from Chile. In 1670 Nicolás Mascardi, a Jesuit priest established in Chiloé Archipelago, founded the mission &quot;Nuestra Señora de Nahuel Huapi&quot; on the northern shores of Nahuel Huapi Lake. The Jesuit missions lasted few years and the last mission in Neuquén was destroyed in 1717. The suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1767 halted further missionary activity. 

===Royalist hideout===
During the independence wars initiated by José de San Martín the local natives&#x27; rumored the imminent arrival of Spanish Crown Loyalist troops to Patagonia, either from the Chilean port of Chiloé coming from Alto Peru or by the Spanish settlemts in The Patagonian Islands, were common among Mapuches indigenous peoples and of the northern Patagonia Pampas of Argentina. The last royalist armed group in what is today Argentina and Chile, the Pincheira brothers, moved from the vicinities of Chillán across the Andes into northern Neuquén as patriots consolidated control of the Spanish Crown colony of Capitania of Chile. The Pincheira brothers was a large mounted outlaw gang made of European Spanish, American Spanish, Mestizos and local indigenous peoples. This group was able to move to Patagonia thanks to its alliance with two indigenous tribes, the Ranqueles and the Boroanos. In Varvarco, far from the de facto territory of the Republic of Chile and the United Provinces, the Pincheira brothers established a permanent encampment with thousands of settlers. From this and other bases the Pincheira brothers led numerous raids into the countryside of the newly established republics.

In 1827 Chilean troops commanded by Jorge Beauchef retaliated by crossing the Andes and raided the royalist encampment. Chileans forced about three thousand people back across the Andes to repopulate Antuco.

===Integration to Argentina (1875–1955)===
The Neuquén area came under Argentine influence after explorer Perito Francisco Moreno made several trips to Patagonia and made accurate descriptions of the area in his book &quot;Viaje al Pais de las Manzanas&quot;, reaching Nahuel Huapi lake in 1875. In 1879 Julio Argentino Roca started the Conquest of the Desert (&quot;Conquista del Desierto&quot;) that finally broke the aboriginal resistance. In 1884 Patagonia&#x27;s political divisions were restructured and the &quot;Territory of Neuquén&quot; acquired its current boundaries. The capital of the province moved several times to &quot;Norquín&quot; (1884–85), &quot;Campana Mahuida&quot; (current Loncopué) (1885–1888), Chos Malal (1885–1901), and finally &quot;Confluencia&quot; currently known as Neuquén.

At the beginning of the 20th century the railway reached the city of Neuquén, and a new irrigation system was finished, facilitating the production and later transportation of crops. Petroleum was found in &quot;Plaza Huincul&quot; in 1918, giving Neuquén a new push forward.

Local politics have long been dominated by a single political party, the MPN or Movimiento Popular Neuquino founded by Elias Sapag, a prosperous businessman born in Lebanon.

Migrating to Argentina, the Sapag family arrived in Neuquén Territory around 1910 with the railroad, eventually making their home in Zapala, whose dry, fertile mountain valleys and orchards were reminiscent of their native Lebanon. Neuquén is rich in natural resources such as natural gas, petroleum, virgin forests and water resources suitable for electric power and tourism alike. These resources were formerly managed by the central National Government, which resulted in little local benefit at the time. Because of social unrest, Elias Sapag and two younger brothers, Felipe and Amado, started the MPN, an active political movement rooted in federalism and greater local rights over the territory and its resources.

===Argentine Province (1955–present)===
The territory was made a province on June 15, 1955, and its constitution promulgated on November 28, 1957. Felipe Sapag soon became politically prominent. Although he was elected governor in 1962 representing the Movimiento Popular Neuquino, a coup against progressive President Arturo Frondizi that March prevented Sapag from taking office. Eventually becoming governor in 1963-66 and 1973–76, he presided over one of Argentina&#x27;s fastest-growing provinces. The national government established the University of Neuquén in 1964, later incorporated into the new National University of Comahue in 1971. Removed as governor following the violent March 1976 coup against Isabel Perón, Felipe Sapag was returned to office in 1983-87 and 1995-99. His emphasis on public works and political independence from Buenos Aires have helped him and his successors with the MPN win every province-wide election since. His brother Elias Sapag became senator in 1963-66, 1973–76 and from 1983 until his death in 1993, becoming the longest-serving senator in national history. The MPN also elected Governors Pedro Salvatori (1987–91), Jorge Sobisch (1991–95 and 1999–2007) and current Governor Jorge Sapag (2007–11).

==Geography==


The province&#x27;s limits are the Colorado River to the northeast, separating it from the Mendoza Province, the Limay River to the southeast toward the Río Negro Province, and the Andes mountains to the west, separating it from Chile.

There are two main distinctive landscapes; the mountainous fertile valleys with forest on the west, and the arid plateau with fertile land only near the basins of the rivers on the east, mostly the Limay River and Neuquén River.

The lacustrine system includes other less-important rivers such as the Aluminé River, the Malleo, and the Picún Leufú River, and a series of lakes including Nahuel Huapi Lake (550 km2), shared with Río Negro Province, Aluminé Lake (58 km2), Lácar Lake (49 km2), Huechulaufquen Lake (110 km2), Lolog Lake (35 km2), Traful, Hermoso, Quillén, Ñorquinco, Tromen and Falkner.

The province is home to the magnificent Arrayanes &quot;(Luma apiculata)&quot; forest at the Los Arrayanes National Park. Other National parks include Lanín National Park and the Lanín extinct volcano, the Nahuel Huapí National Park shared with Río Negro Province, and the Laguna Blanca National Park.

===Climate===


Neuquén Province, being relatively far away from both the Atlantic coast and the Pacific ocean by the Andes mountains, which help to block most moisture coming from the Pacific Ocean results in a climate that is the most continental in Patagonia with large diurnal ranges.

====Temperature====
Mean temperatures are relatively cold for its latitude due to the high altitude. The warmest region is the eastern parts of the province where mean annual temperatures range from . The coldest areas are located in the Andean region where mean annual temperatures are below or even below at the highest peaks. During the summer months, mean December and January temperatures reach up to in the eastern parts although during heat waves, temperatures can exceed . In July, the mean temperature ranges from in the east to in the west at the foothills of the Andes.

====Humidity and precipitation====
Humidity throughout the province varies significantly, depending on the location. The Andean region has a mean humidity exceeding 60% or even 70% due to lower temperatures while in the eastern parts, humidity is lower owing to higher temperatures. In all locations, humidity is significantly lower during the summer than in the winter.

Because the Andes block most of the moisture from the Pacific Ocean from coming in, causing it to release most of the precipitation on its western slopes, most of the province is dry, averaging less than a year. Northern and eastern parts of the province have mean annual precipitation exceeding . In the western parts of the province, precipitation ranges from from the Andes to areas east of it. This area represents a transitional climate between the more arid east and the wetter climates to the west and has a Mediterranean like precipitation pattern, similar to central Chile. This is due to the seasonal migration of the South Pacific Anticyclone. Summer months are drier since the South Pacific high is more southwards, inhibiting rainfall. During the winter months, this high is displaced to the north, allowing frontal and low pressure systems from the west to come in, resulting in higher precipitation during this season. As such, most of the precipitation in this area falls during the winter months. In the southernmost parts of the province, some areas receive more than of precipitation a year.

====Wind and sunshine====
The winds in the province are moderately strong (slightly stronger in the south) and play a role in making most of the province arid by favoring evaporation. The predominant wind directions are from the west or southwest, which occur 40–50% of the time. In general, high altitude areas and flat areas receive stronger winds while summers tend to be windier than winters.

Cloud cover in the province varies widely with the eastern parts receiving less cloud cover than the Andean region which tends to be cloudier. Winters tend to be cloudier than summers with mean daily sunshine hours ranging from a high of 11 hours/day in January to a low of 3 hours in June.

== Demographics ==

According to the 2022 Argentine national census, the Province of Neuquén has 726,590 inhabitants.

==Economy==
Neuquen is one of Argentina&#x27;s most prosperous provinces, its estimated 47.648 billion Peso (about US$10.495 billion) economy in 2012, or, 80,566 pesos (US$17,744) per capita.

No province in Argentina, however, is as dependent on any one sector as is Neuquen&#x27;s. Roughly half its output is accounted for by its mining and extractive sector, mainly on account of its massive gas and petroleum production, the most important in Argentina. That dependency is only likely to increase: development of the province&#x27;s huge unconventional hydrocarbon reserves is beginning, above all in the Vaca Muerta formation.

The province generates a significant part of Patagonia&#x27;s electric power through the hydroelectric plants of Piedra del Águila, El Chocón, Pichi Picún Leufú, Planicie Banderita (in the Cerros Colorados Complex), and Alicurá. The town of Arroyito hosts the only heavy water plant in the country.

Another important activity is the production of apples, pears, peaches and others, specially in the Alto Valle area, shared with Río Negro.

The piquetero movement (organizations of unemployed workers) was born in Neuquén in the 1990s, during the presidency of Carlos Menem.

==Tourism==

== Government ==
The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

<text>Soft rock (also known as light rock) is a form of rock music that originated in the late 1960s in the United States and the United Kingdom which smoothed over the edges of singer-songwriter and pop rock, relying on simple, melodic songs with big, lush productions. Soft rock was prevalent on the radio throughout the 1970s and eventually metamorphosed into a form of the synthesized music of adult contemporary in the 1980s. The genre was pioneered by such artists as Fleetwood Mac, Elton John, James Taylor and Hall &amp; Oates.

==History==
===Mid- to late 1960s===
Softer sounds in rock music could be heard in mid-1960s songs, such as &quot;A Summer Song&quot; by Chad &amp; Jeremy (1964) and &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; by the Beatles and &quot;I Love My Dog&quot; by Cat Stevens, both from 1966.

By 1968, hard rock had been established as a mainstream genre. From the end of the 1960s, it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock, with both emerging as major radio formats in the US. The Bee Gees were considered soft rock in the late 1960s. 

===Early 1970s===
Major artists of that time included Bread, Carly Simon, Carole King, Cat Stevens and James Taylor.

The Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts became more similar again toward the end of the 1960s and into the early and mid-1970s when the texture of much of the music played on top 40 radio once more began to soften. The adult contemporary format began evolving into the sound that later defined it, with rock-oriented acts as Chicago, the Eagles and Elton John becoming associated with the format. The Carpenters&#x27; hit version of &quot;(They Long to Be) Close to You&quot; was released in the summer of 1970, followed by Bread&#x27;s &quot;Make It with You&quot;, both early examples of a softer sound that was coming to dominate the charts.

The soft rock album &quot;Tapestry&quot; by Carole King, released in February 1971, became one of the best-selling albums of all time. The lead double-sided single from the album, &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;/&quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot;, spent five weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 beginning in mid-June 1971.

Los Angeles station KNX-FM, under program director Steve Marshall, introduced a &quot;mellow rock&quot; format in 1971.

Albert Hammond scored a major hit single with &quot;It Never Rains in Southern California&quot; in 1972, which went top 10 in at least six countries including Canada and the U.S. at numbers 2 and 5, respectively.

In the spring of 1972, Neil Young scored his only number-one single with &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, from the album &quot;Harvest&quot;. Topping the charts in both the U.S. and Canada, this soft rock ballad featured backing vocals from Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor, heard near the end of the song.

In 1973, Paul McCartney and Wings had a U.S. number one with &quot;My Love&quot;, which also reached No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary charts of both the U.S. and Canada.

===Mid- to late 1970s===
Soft rock reached its commercial peak in the mid-to-late 1970s with acts such as Toto, England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley, Air Supply, Seals and Crofts, America and the reformed Fleetwood Mac, whose &quot;Rumours&quot; (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade.

Denver station KIMN-FM introduced a &quot;mellow rock&quot; album format in 1975. Program director Scott Kenyon told &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Michael Murphey&#x27;s &quot;Wildfire&quot; is a perfect example; it feels like Colorado, you can tell it came from this part of the country. There&#x27;s a sound of the Rockies... the best description is mellow rock. Take that kind of music and make it into a Colorado sounding station.&quot;

By 1977, some radio stations, notably New York&#x27;s WTFM and NBC-owned WYNY, had switched to an all-soft rock format. Chicago&#x27;s WBBM-FM adopted a soft rock/album rock hybrid format in 1977 and was known as &quot;Soft Rock 96&quot; presenting the &quot;Mellow sound of Chicago&quot;. Five years later, they would flip to a &quot;Hot Hits&quot; top 40 format.

By the 1980s, tastes had changed and radio formats reflected this change, including musical artists such as Journey.

A prominent counterpart of soft rock in the late 1970s and early 1980s came to be known as yacht rock; its name coined in 2005 by the makers of the online video series &quot;Yacht Rock&quot;. Originating from California&#x27;s session musicians, yacht rock only partially overlapped with soft rock; it could include soft to mid-level (but rarely ever purely hard) rock. Much of the &quot;West Coast sound&quot; of yacht rock bore similarity to some of the East Coast soft rockers of the era such as Rupert Holmes and Hall &amp; Oates, leading to the conflation.

===1980s===

In the early 1980s, the radio format evolved into what came to be known as &quot;adult contemporary&quot; or &quot;adult album alternative&quot;, a format that has less overt rock bias than its forebear radio categorization. In Los Angeles, KOST 103.5 FM, under program director Jhani Kaye, debuted its soft adult contemporary format in November 1982. 

===1990s===
Soft rock persisted in the 1990s, with artists from previous decades continuing to release new music, such as Genesis, whose 1992 soft rock single &quot;Hold on My Heart&quot; topped the Canadian singles chart and &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. Extreme&#x27;s 1991 single &quot;More Than Words&quot; was internationally successful, topping the national singles charts in at least five countries, including Canada and the United States. Mr. Big&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;To Be with You&quot; was a number one hit in at least twelve countries. Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; was also successful, topping the national singles charts in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and six other countries.

Richard Marx&#x27;s 1994 single &quot;Now and Forever&quot; topped the Canadian adult contemporary chart and peaked in the top ten of the national singles charts in that country, Norway, and the United States. New bands and artists emerged such as the Danish band Michael Learns to Rock, who saw massive popularity in Asia, with many singles becoming commercially successful in the continent starting with their 1991 hit &quot;The Actor&quot;, and Australian band Southern Sons, who enjoyed success on the ARIA Charts with three top 10 singles.
