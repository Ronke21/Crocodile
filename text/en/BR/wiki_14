The city is the administrative center of Ternopil Oblast (region), as well as of surrounding Ternopil Raion (district) within the oblast. It hosts the administration of Ternopil urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine.

Until 18 July 2020, Ternopil was designated as a city of oblast significance and did not belong to Ternopil Raion even though it was the center of the raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ternopil Oblast to three, the city was merged into Ternopil Raion.

==History==
The city was founded in 1540 by Polish commander and Hetman Jan Amor Tarnowski. Its Polish name &quot;Tarnopol&quot; means &#x27;Tarnowski&#x27;s city&#x27; and stems from a combination of the founder&#x27;s family name and the Greek term &quot;polis&quot;. The city served as a military stronghold and castle On 15 April 1540, the King of Poland, Sigismund I the Old, in Kraków gave Tarnowski permission to establish Tarnopol, near Sopilcze (&quot;Sopilche&quot;). protecting the eastern borders of Polish Kingdom from Tatar raids. In 1570, the city passed to the Ostrogski family, and in 1623 to the Zamoyski family. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, many residents of the city joined the ranks of the Cossack forces. During the 1672–1676 Polish–Ottoman War, Tarnopol was almost completely destroyed by Turkish forces of Ibrahim Shishman Pasha in 1675, then rebuilt by Aleksander Koniecpolski.

In 1772, after the First Partition of Poland, the city came under Austrian rule. In 1809, after the War of the Fifth Coalition, the city came under Russian rule, incorporated into the newly created &quot;Ternopol krai&quot;, but in 1815 returned to Austrian rule in accordance with the Congress of Vienna. In 1870 Tarnopol was connected by railway with Lemberg.

During World War I, the city passed from German and Austro-Hungarian forces to Russia several times. In 1917, the city and its castle were burned down by fleeing Russian forces. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the city was proclaimed as part of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic on 11 November 1918. After Polish forces captured Lwów during the Polish-Ukrainian War, Tarnopol became the country&#x27;s temporary capital. After the act of union between the West Ukrainian Republic and the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, Ternopil formally became part of the UPR. On 15 July 1919, the city was captured. by Polish forces. In July and August 1920, the Red Army captured Ternopil in the course of the Polish-Soviet War, and the city served as the capital of the short-lived Galician Soviet Socialist Republic. Under the terms of the Riga treaty, the area remained under Polish control.

As a consequence of the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Ternopil was incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic as part of Ternopol Oblast. On 2 July 1941, the city was occupied by the Nazis. Between then and July 1943, 10,000 Jews were killed by Nazi Germans, and another 6,000 were rounded up and sent to Belzec extermination camp. A few hundred others went to labor camps. During most of this time Jews lived in the Tarnopol Ghetto. Many Ukrainians were sent as forced labour to Germany. Following the Act of restoration of the Ukrainian state proclaimed in Lviv on 30 June 1941, Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) was active in Ternopil region and battled for the independence of Ukraine, opposing Nazis, Polish underground Armia Krajowa and People&#x27;s Army of Poland as well as the Soviets. In 1942 the Germans operated the Stalag 323 prisoner-of-war camp for French POWs in the city. During the Soviet offensive in March and April 1944, the city was almost completely destroyed by Soviet artillery. Finally, Ternopol was occupied by the Red Army on 15 April 1944. After the second Soviet occupation, 85% of the city&#x27;s living quarters were destroyed.

Following the Potsdam Conference in 1945, Poland&#x27;s borders were redrawn and Ternopil was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union. The ethnic Polish population of the area was forcibly deported to postwar Poland. In the following decades, Ternopil was rebuilt in a typical Soviet style and only a few buildings were reconstructed. 

Following the fall of the Soviet Union, Ternopil became part of the independent Ukraine as a city of regional significance. On 31 December 2013, the 11th Artillery Brigade, descendant of artillery units that had been based in the city since 1949, was disbanded. In 2020, as part of the administrative reform in Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ternopil Oblast to three, the city was merged into Ternopil Raion.

===Stadium naming controversy===
In 2021, Ternopil created international outrage, especially in the Jewish community, by deciding to name a city stadium in honor of Nazi collaborator Roman Shukhevych. Shukhevych was the military leader of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army during World War II and was known for his collaboration with the Nazi regime as well as his responsibility for the massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia. As a result, the City Council of Tarnów decided to suspend its partnership with Ternopil.

Joel Lion, the Israeli Ambassador to Ukraine, expressed Israel’s strong objection to the city&#x27;s choice to name the stadium in honor of Roman Shukhevych. Lion wrote, &quot;We strongly condemn the decision of Ternopil city council to name the City Stadium after the infamous Hauptman (Captain) of the SS 201st Schutzmannschaft Roman Shukhevych and demand the immediate cancellation of this decision&quot;.

The Eastern Europe Director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Efraim Zuroff wrote,
&quot;It is fully understandable that Ternopil seeks to honor those who fought against Soviet Communism, but not those behind the mass murder of innocent fellow citizens.&quot; in a statement attempting to convince Ternopil to reconsider the &quot;renaming of its stadium in honor of Nazi collaborator, Hauptmann of the SS Schutzmannschaft 201, Roman Shukhevych, an active participant in the mass murder of Jews and Poles in World War II.&quot;

===Russo-Ukrainian War===
In June 2022, due to full-scale Russian invasion and missile strikes from the territory of Belarus, Ternopil suspended its partnership with the city of Pinsk.

<text>Kovel (, ; ; ) is a city in Volyn Oblast, northwestern Ukraine. It serves as the administrative center of Kovel Raion within the oblast. Population: 

Kovel gives its name to one of the oldest runic inscriptions which were lost during World War II. The Kovel spearhead, unearthed near the town in 1858, contained text in Gothic.

==History==
The name Kovel comes from a Slavonic word for blacksmith hence the horseshoe on the town&#x27;s coat of arms. The rune-inscribed Spearhead of Kovel was found near Kovel in 1858. It dates to the early 3rd century, when Gothic tribes lived in the area.

Kovel (Kowel) was first mentioned in 1310. It received its town charter from the Polish King Sigismund I the Old in 1518. In 1547 the owner of Kowel became Bona Sforza, Polish queen. In 1564 starost of Kowel became Kurbski (d. 1584). From 1566 to 1795 it was part of the Volhynian Voivodeship. Kowel was a royal city of Poland. In 1792 the 3rd Polish Vanguard Regiment was garrisoned in Kowel, and later on also the 2nd Polish National Cavalry Brigade was stationed there.

After the Third Partition of Poland, in 1795, the town fell into the Russian Empire for over a hundred years. During the First World War, the city was a site of the Battle of Kowel between the Central Powers and the Russian Empire.

During the Polish–Soviet War, on September 12, 1920, it was the site of a battle between the Poles and Russians. The Poles won the battle, capturing a large amount of weapons and military equipment, including two armored trains and 26 cannons. In the interwar period, Kowel served as the capital of Kowel County in Wołyń Voivodeship of the Polish Republic. It was an important garrison of the Polish Army, here the headquarters of the 27th Volhynian Infantry Division was located. Furthermore, at the village of Czerkasy, a large depot of the Polish Army was located. In 1924, construction of the St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Roman Catholic church began.

In World War II, following the joint Nazi German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Kovel was occupied by the Soviet Union and had a large number of Jewish refugees from German-occupied Poland. The area had a large presence of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, and thus the Red Army was generally greeted as liberators. Subsequently, in 1941 Operation Barbarossa the Germans having conquered the town on 28 June 1941 murdered 18,000 Jews in Kovel, mostly during August and September 1942. The Germans operated the Stalag 301 POW camp, a subcamp of the Stalag 360 POW camp and a Dulag transit POW camp in the town.

About 8,000 Jews were murdered in the forest near Bakhiv on 19 August 1942 during the liquidation of the Kovel ghetto, established on 25 May 1942. Jewish victims were driven by train from Kovel to Bakhiv where pits were dug close to the railroads. Actually there were two ghettos, one within the city and another in the suburbs of Pyaski. Both ghettos had 24,000 Jews, including many refugees. The Jews from both ghettos were executed at different places and at different time. The Jewish community ceased to exist.

In March and April 1944 during the Soviet Polesskoe offensive, Kovel was a site of fierce fighting between the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking and the Red Army.

During the massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, the town was a shelter for ethnic Poles, escaping the massacres. In that period, Ukrainian nationalists murdered approximately 3,700 Polish inhabitants of Kovel county. In early spring 1944, the 27th Infantry Division of the Home Army operated in the area. Kovel was captured by the Red Army on 6 July 1944. In 1945, the Big Three, Great Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union, established new borders for Poland; the Polish population was forcibly resettled and Kovel was incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. It has been a part of sovereign Ukraine since 1991.

<text>Ivano-Frankivsk (, ), formerly Stanyslaviv, Stanislav and Stanisławów, is a city in western Ukraine. It serves as the administrative centre of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast as well as Ivano-Frankivsk Raion within the oblast. Ivano-Frankivsk also hosts the administration of the Ivano-Frankivsk urban hromada. Its population is 

Built in the mid-17th century as a fortress of the Polish Potocki family, Stanisławów was annexed to the Habsburg Empire during the First Partition of Poland in 1772, after which it became the property of the State within the Austrian Empire. The fortress was slowly transformed into one of the most prominent cities at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. After World War I, for several months, it served as a temporary capital of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. Following the Peace of Riga in 1921, Stanisławów became part of the Second Polish Republic. After the Soviet invasion of Poland at the onset of World War II, the city was annexed by the Soviet Union, only to be occupied by Nazi Germany two years later. With the liberation of Soviet Ukraine in 1944 and the shifting of borders, the city remained part of the Ukrainian SSR and was renamed in 1962 after Ivan Franko. With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the city become part of newly-independent Ukraine.

Ivano-Frankivsk is one of the principal cities of the Carpathian Euroregion. There are elements of various cultures intertwined in the city&#x27;s architecture, including the Polish city hall, the Austro-Hungarian city&#x27;s business centre, the Soviet prefabricated apartment blocks at the city&#x27;s rural–urban fringe, and others.

==Name==

The town was founded as a fortress known as &quot;Stanisławów&quot; where it was named after the Polish hetman Stanisław &quot;Rewera&quot; Potocki. Some sources claim it was named after his grandson Stanisław. Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the name was transliterated as &quot;Stanislau&quot; in German, as the city became part of the Austrian Empire, and later Austria-Hungary; however, after the Revolutions of 1848, the city carried three different linguistic renderings of its name: German, Polish, and Ruthenian (, ; , ; &quot;Stanislaviv&quot;, , or &quot;Stanyslaviv&quot;, ). Other spellings used in the local press media included &quot;Stanislavov&quot; and .

After World War II it was changed by the Soviet authorities into a simplified version Stanislav (, ; , ). In 1962, to honor the Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko on the city&#x27;s 300th anniversary, it was renamed &quot;Ivano-Frankivsk&quot; () or &quot;Ivano-Frankovsk&quot; (). It is sometimes colloquially called Franyk () by its residents.


==History==

The town of Stanisławów was founded as a fortress in order to protect the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from Tatar invasions and to defend the multi-ethnic population of the region in case of armed conflicts such as the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648. The fort was originally built next to Zabolotiv village (known since 1435), and Knyahynyn (1449). The village of Zabolotiv and the land around it were purchased by Andrzej Potocki from another Polish nobleman, Rzeczkowski. Stanisławów was issued by Potocki and his declaration establishing the city with Magdeburg rights on 7 May 1662; but the city and its rights, however, were not recognized by the Polish Crown until 14 August 1663, when John Casimir had finally approved it. By 1672, the fortress had been rebuilt from wood to stone, brick, and mortar. Also a new large fortified Potocki palace was erected in the place of an older wood structure. Today this building serves as the military hospital. In the same year Jews were granted the right to become permanent residents, who could work, conduct commerce and travel in and out of the city as they pleased.

Originally the city was divided into two districts: Tysmenytsia and Halych. Sometime in 1817–1819 the neighbouring village of Zabolottya, that had a special status, was incorporated into the city as a new district, while Tysmenytsia district was divided into Tysmenytsia and Lysets districts. Each district had its main street corresponded with its name: Halych Street (Halych district), Tysmenytsia Street which today is Independence Street (Tysmenytsia district), Zabolotiv Street – Mykhailo Hrushevsky Street and Street of Vasylyanok (Zabolottya district), and Lysets Street – Hetman Mazepa Street (Lysets district). Later the city was split into six small districts: midtown where the rich Catholic population and patricians lived, pidzamche (subcastle), and four suburbs – Zabolotiv, Tysmenytsia, Halych and Lysets where the plebeians lived.
In October 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed and the Western Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (ZUNR) was proclaimed. In the early months of 1919 (from January to May) the city became a temporary capital of the West Ukrainian National Republic, while still recovering from World War I. All state affairs took place in the building of &quot;Dnister Hotel&quot; where the Act Zluky (Unification Act) was composed and signed on 22 January 1919 by the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. The same year it was subjected to the Polish–Ukrainian and the Romanian-Ukrainian skirmishes eventually being annexed by Poland as part of the Second Polish Republic as the centre of the Stanisławów Voivodeship. It was occupied by the Romanian army for the summer months from 25 May to 21 August 1919. During the Polish–Soviet War in 1920, the Red Army took over the city for a brief period. After the Soviet retreat, Ukrainian troops loyal to Symon Petlura occupied the city for a few days. At this period of history the city was in complete disorder. It then became part of Poland until the start of World War II.

In the 1939 invasion of Poland by German and Soviet forces, the territory was captured by the Soviets in September 1939 and annexed to the Ukrainian SSR. Between September 1939 and June 1941, the Soviet regime ordered thousands of inhabitants of the city to leave their houses and move to Siberia, where most of them perished. Numerous people were taken out of the city prison and simply shot outside of the city when Soviet forces were leaving it in 1941. Ivano-Frankivsk was occupied by German forces from 2 July 1941 to 27 July 1944. There were more than 40,000 Jews in Stanisławów when it was occupied by the Nazis on 26 July 1941. The Stanisławów Ghetto was formed. During the occupation (1941–44), more than 600 educated Poles and most of the city&#x27;s Jewish population were murdered.

In early 1944, the city became part of the Soviet Union and was again renamed &quot;Stanislav&quot;. The Soviets forced most of the Polish population to leave the city, where most of them settled in the Recovered Territories. In 1962, the city was renamed &quot;Ivano-Frankivsk&quot; after the Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko.

During the post-war period, the city was part of the Carpathian Military District housing the 38th Army (70th Motor Rifle Division) that participated in Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.

Until 18 July 2020, Ivano-Frankivsk was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and the center of Ivano-Frankivsk Municipality. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast to six. The area of Ivano-Frankivsk Municipality was merged into the newly established Ivano-Frankivsk Raion.

Since the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the city is often bombed by Russian forces. On 24 February and 11 March 2022, Ivano-Frankivsk was struck by Russian missiles during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

===Sports===

Ivano-Frankivsk is home to a number of sports teams. Most notably, it was home to the football club FC Spartak Ivano-Frankivsk (Prykarpattya) that participated on the national level since the 1950s. Since 2007, the club only fields its youth team Spartak-93 and competes in the Children-Youth Football League of Ukraine. The former president of Spartak Anatoliy Revutskiy reorganized the local university (University of Oil and Gas) team in 2007 into the new &quot;FSK Prykarpattia&quot; with support of the city mayor Anushkevychus making it the main football club in the region and replacing Spartak. Previously during the interbellum period, the city was home to another football club based on the local Polish garrison and called Rewera Stanisławów (1908). That club competed at a regional level that had evolved at that period. With the start of World War II, that club was disbanded. During the Soviet period among several others there was another club &quot;Elektron&quot; that successfully participated at a regional level around the 1970s.

The city also is the home to a futsal team, PFC Uragan Ivano-Frankivsk, that competes in the Ukrainian Futsal Championship. They were the Ukrainian champions having won the 2010/11 season playoffs and therefore took part in the 2011–12 UEFA Futsal Cup for the first time.

The city had an ice hockey team, HC Vatra Ivano-Frankivsk, which previously played in the Ukrainian Hockey Championship.

Ivano-Frankivsk is also the hometown of Ukrainian gymnasts; one of them is Dariya Zgoba who won gold on the uneven bars in the 2007 European Championships and became a finalist on the Beijing Olympics; the other one is Yana Demyanchuk, who won gold on the balance beam at the 2009 European Championships.

<doc id="512808" wikidata="Q782593" url="?curid=512808" title="Stanisławów Voivodeship">
<text>Stanisławów Voivodeship () was an administrative district of the interwar Poland (1920–1939). It was established in December 1920 with an administrative center in Stanisławów. The voivodeship had an area of 16,900 km2 and comprised twelve counties (powiaty). Following World War II, at the insistence of Joseph Stalin during the Tehran Conference of 1943, Poland&#x27;s borders were redrawn, Polish population forcibly resettled and Stanisławów Voivodeship was incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic as Stanislav Oblast (later renamed as Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast).

==September 1939 and its aftermath==
Following German invasion on Poland, and in accordance with the secret protocol of Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland on September 17, 1939. As bulk of the Polish Army was concentrated in the west, fighting Germans, the Soviets met with little resistance and their troops quickly moved westwards. Polish authorities originally intended to organize anti-German resistance in Stanisławów Voivodeship &quot;(see: Romanian Bridgehead)&quot;, with Polish Army units planning to stand ground until the spring of 1940 when a French attack on Germany was expected. However, the Soviet invasion of Poland rendered these plans ineffectual. It is estimated that prior to Soviet counter-offensive in the latter part of World War II, over 18,000 Polish civilians in Stanisławów Voivodeship fell victims to OUN-UPA massacres.

==Demographics==
The Voivodeship&#x27;s capital was Stanisławów (now &quot;Ivano-Frankivsk&quot; in Ukraine). In 1921 was inhabited by 1,339,191 people, and its population density was 72.9 persons per km2. Ukrainians and Ruthenians constituted 70% of the population, especially in the countryside. Poles, distributed across the entire voivodeship, made around 22%, Polish Jews (mainly in towns), around 7%. Also, there were smaller communities of Galician Germans. In 1931 the population grew to 1,480,285 and the density to 88 persons per km2.

According to the census of 1921 the Stanisławów Voivodeship was inhabited by 1,339,191 people, of whom by nationality 70.2% were Ruthenian (Ukrainian), 21.8% were Polish, 6.8% were Jewish, 1.1% were German and 0.1% all others. By religion 74.3% were Uniate or Orthodox, 14.3% were Roman Catholic, 0.8% were Protestant and 10.6% were Jewish.

In 1931 the voivodeship had 1,480,285 inhabitants, of whom by mother tongue 68.8% spoke Ukrainian and Ruthenian, 22.4% spoke Polish, 7.4% spoke Yiddish and Hebrew, 1.1% spoke German and 0.3% spoke other languages. By religion 73% were Greek Catholic and Orthodox, 16.6% were Roman Catholic, 0.8% were Protestant, 9.4% were Jewish and 0.2% were others. 

The results of the 1931 census (questions about mother tongue and about religion) are presented in the table below:
==Geography==
The Stanisławów Voivodeship&#x27;s area was 16,894 square kilometers. It was located in south-eastern corner of the country, bordering Tarnopol Voivodeship to the northeast, Lwów Voivodeship to the west, Czechoslovakia (Between 1919 and 1938), Hungary (Between 1938 and 1939) and Romania to the south. It was in large part covered by forests of the Carpathian Mountains, with numerous mountain spas (Worochta, Skole, Dolina, Żabie, Sławsko, Woronienka, Jaremcza, Kuty). The landscape was hilly (in the north) and mountainous (in the south), with Hoverla in the Chornohora range as the highest peak (2060 meters above sea level). The other significant mountain range was the Gorgany.

The main river was the Dniester, which also marked border with the Tarnopol Voivodeship. Other rivers were: the Prut, the Stryj and the Cheremosh (the last one was at the same time bordering Poland from Romania).

==Administrative divisions==
Before the onset of World War II the Stanisławów Voivodeship consisted of 15 powiats (counties) (earlier 12), 29 towns, 904 villages and numerous smaller communities (&quot;futory, kolonie&quot;). Those were the same 12 powiats that were part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria with the addition of Turka powiat later on. Its capital Stanisławów was the largest city, with population of some 60,000 (as of 1931). Other important municipal centers of the voivodeship were: Kołomyja (pop. 33,800), Stryj (pop. 30,500), Horodenka (pop. 12,200), Kalusz (pop. 12,100), Sniatyn (pop. 10,800) and Bolechow (pop. 10,700).
The Stanisławów Voivodeship consisted of 12 powiats (counties):
# Dolina Powiat (2,397 km2)
# Horodenka Powiat (849 km2)
# Kałusz Powiat (1,137 km2)
# Kołomyja Powiat (1,339 km2), joined with Peczeniżyn Powiat
# Kosów Powiat (1,839 km2)
# Nadwórna Powiat (2,472 km2)
# Rohatyn Powiat (1,147 km2)
# Stanisławów Powiat (1,249 km2), joined with Bohorodczan Powiat
# Stryj Powiat (2,081 km2), joined with Skolski Powiat
# Śniatyń Powiat (567 km2)
# Tłumacz Powiat (934 km2)
# Żydaczów Powiat (883 km2)

==Railroads and industry==
The Stanisławów Voivodeship was located in the so-called Poland &quot;B&quot; region, which meant that it was underdeveloped, with low level of industry and considerable numbers of inhabitants living in poverty. Agricultural production was low due to poor quality of soil. Since mid-1930s, the area was quickly gaining popularity as a tourist destination, with numbers of visitors to mountain springs rising steadily year by year. Railroad network was well-developed in the north, with such important junctions as Stanisławów, Kołomyja and Stryj. In the south, however, rail connections were lacking.

On January 1, 1938, total length of railroads within Voivodeship&#x27;s boundaries was 755 kilometers (4.5 km. per 100 km2).

==Voivodes==

The local government of voivodeship and city was located at address Ulica Karpinskiego, 7 (today - vulytsia Halytska, 2).

<text>Abu ʿĀmir Muḥammad ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn Abi ʿĀmir al-Maʿafiri (), nicknamed al-Manṣūr (, &quot;the Victorious&quot;), which is often Latinized as Almanzor in Spanish, Almansor in Catalan and Almançor in Portuguese (c. 938 – 8 August 1002), was a Muslim Arab Andalusi military leader and statesman. As the chancellor of the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba and &quot;hajib&quot; (chamberlain) for Caliph Hisham II, Almanzor was effectively ruler of Islamic Iberia.

Born in Turrush to a family of Yemeni Arab origin with some juridical ancestors, ibn Abi ʿĀmir left for Córdoba when still young to be trained as a &quot;faqīh&quot;. After a few humble beginnings, he joined the court administration and soon gained the confidence of Subh, mother of the children of Caliph Al-Hakam II. Thanks to her patronage and his own efficiency, he quickly expanded his role.

During the caliphate of Al-Hakam II, he held several important administrative positions, including director of the mint (967), administrator for Subh and her children, administrator for intestate inheritances, and quartermaster for the army of General Ghalib ibn Abd al-Rahman (973). The death of the caliph in 976 marked the beginning of the domination of the Caliphate by this functionary, which continued beyond his death with the government of two of his sons, Abd al-Malik al-Muzaffar and Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo, up to 1009. As chamberlain of the caliphate (from 978), he exercised extraordinary power in the al-Andalus state, throughout the Iberian Peninsula and in part of the Maghreb, while Caliph Hisham II was reduced to near-figurehead status.

His portentous rise to power has been explained by an insatiable thirst for dominance, but historian Eduardo Manzano Moreno warns that &quot;it must be understood within the framework of the complex internal struggles that developed within the Umayyad administration.&quot; Deeply religious, he received the pragmatic support of Muslim authorities for his control of political power, though not without periodic tensions between them. The basis of his power was his defense of &quot;jihad&quot;, which he proclaimed in the name of the Caliph. His image as a champion of Islam served to justify his assumption of governmental authority.

Having monopolized political dominance in the caliphate, he carried out profound reforms in both foreign and domestic politics. He made numerous victorious campaigns in both the Maghreb and Iberia. On the peninsula, his bloody and very destructive incursions against the Christian kingdoms temporarily halted their advance southward.

== Origins and youth ==
Although there are doubts about the exact date of his birth, everything seems to indicate that it occurred around the year 939. He was born into an Arab landowning family of Yemeni origin, belonging to the al-Ma&#x27;afir tribe. They had been established since the conquest of Visigothic Iberia in Torrox, a farm by the mouth of the Guadiaro river, belonging to the &quot;cora&quot; (territorial subdivision) of &quot;al-Jazīrah&quot; (governed from &quot;al-Jazīrah al-Khaḍrāʾ الجزيرة الخضراء&quot;, the site of modern Algeciras). His family had received lands there from Tariq ibn Ziyad as reward to an ancestor, Abd al-Malik, who had distinguished itself in the taking of Carteia during the Umayyad conquest of Hispania.

Some of the family had served as Qadis and jurists. The family&#x27;s position improved significantly with the appointment of ibn Abi ʿĀmir&#x27;s paternal grandfather as Qadi of Seville and his marriage to the daughter of a vizier, governor of Badajoz and doctor to Caliph Abd al-Rahman III. ibn Abi ʿĀmir&#x27;s father, Abd Allah, was described as a pious, kind and ascetic man, who died in Tripoli while returning from his pilgrimage to Mecca. His mother, Burayha, also belonged to an Arab family. Even so, the family was middle class, modest and provincial.

== Ascent in the Caliphal Court ==

Though still very young, Ibn Abi ʿAmir moved to Córdoba, where he developed his studies in law and letters under the tutelage of his maternal uncle. This training was intended to facilitate entering the state administration, because the opportunities for advancement in the military were limited to Arabs. Like many other youth from wealthy families, he received training in interpretation of the Quran, prophetic tradition and application of Sharia, thus completing his education as a faqīh, with the intention of becoming a judge, and from this time he retained his taste for literature. Instructed by renowned masters of Islamic legal tradition and letters, he showed talent in these studies.

The death of his father and the bad family situation led him to abandon his studies and take the profession of scrivener. After occupying a modest position as a scribe along the &quot;alcázar&quot; and mosque of Córdoba – close to the offices of the Administration – to earn his livelihood, the youth soon stood out for his talent and ambition and he began his political career as a clerk in the audience chamber of the capital&#x27;s chief Qadi, Muhammed ibn al-Salim, an important advisor to the Caliph Al-Hakam II despite the fact that his positions were exclusively religious and not political. Ibn Abi ʿĀmir soon caught the attention of Vizier Ja&#x27;far al-Mushafi, head of the civil administration, who would introduce him to caliphal court, probably on the recommendation of Ibn al-Salim. Already noted for his knowledge and professional competence, he began to accumulate positions in the Administration. Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, in his thirties, was one of the young functionaries who took part in a generational turnover of the court at the beginning of Al-Hakam&#x27;s reign.
In late February of 967, he was given charge of Abd al-Rahman, son and heir of Al-Hakam II by his favorite, the Basque Subh (Aurora), a slave with very diverse training, from singing to Islamic jurisprudence to poetry, who owed her power to her ascendancy over the caliph as the mother of his children. With her, Ibn Abi ʿĀmir established a privileged relationship extremely beneficial for his career. Although his role was probably secondary, his responsibility managing the estates of the heir to the throne and those of his mother granted Ibn Abi ʿĀmir close proximity to the reigning family, and he quickly began to accumulate important positions. Seven months after his first appointment, and thanks to the intercession of the royal favorite, he became director of the mint, and in December 968, he was named treasurer of the vacant inheritances. The following year he was promoted to Qadi of Seville and Niebla, one of the most important in the state, and at the death of his charge Abd al-Rahman in 970, he was placed in the same role for the young heir, Hisham. By this time he had married the sister of the head of the caliphal guard, a client of the new heir, and began to accumulate wealth. A residence was built in al-Rusafa, near the former palace of Abd al-Rahman I, and he began to make sumptuous gifts to the Caliph&#x27;s harem. He was accused of embezzlement and removed from his post as head of the mint in March 972, but was helped financially to cover the alleged embezzlement. He obtained a police command and he retained his responsibility for the heir and intestate estates.

In 973, he undertook the logistical, administrative and diplomatic aspects of the caliphal campaign against the Idrisids in the Maghreb, with the official position of High Qadi of the Umayyad possessions in North Africa. The importance of the fleet in the campaign and its dependence on Seville, where Ibn Abi ʿĀmir was Qadi and therefore had responsibility for its facilities, and the confidence of the caliph himself and his chamberlain, facilitated his acquisition of this appointment. The commission brought with it authority over civilians and military personnel and, in practice, the supervision of the campaign. A primary responsibility of his role was to obtain the submission of the notables of the region by giving them formal gifts, the acceptance of which indicated their acceptance of the Caliph&#x27;s authority and a promise of loyalty. Along with military victories, this undermined the enemy&#x27;s position. 

Achieving victory against the Idrisids, Ibn Abi ʿĀmir returned sick to the Cordoban court in September 974, intending to recover and resume his duties. He never returned to North Africa. His experience as a supervisor of the enlisted troops for the Maghreb campaign gave him an appreciation for their possible political utility if he gained control. It also allowed him to establish relations with the tribal leaders of the area and with his future powerful father-in-law, Ghalib ibn Abd al-Rahman, who had led the military aspects of the operation. Ibn Abi ʿĀmir&#x27;s ability to manage organizational and economic aspects of the campaign was widely recognized, and rewarded months before with his reappointment as head of the mint, and was the beginning of his political success. In the last months of Al-Hakam&#x27;s illness, he appointed Ibn Abi ʿĀmir inspector of professional troops, which included the bulk of the Berbers brought from the Maghreb by the caliph to try to form a force loyal to his person, which guaranteed him access to the throne of the Caliph&#x27;s young son.

== Taking power ==
=== Elimination of pretenders and formation of triumvirate ===
The death of Caliph Al-Hakam II on 1 October 976 and the proclamation of his son Hisham as his successor inaugurated a new period in the political career of Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, and also represented a pivotal event in the history of the Caliphate, which thereafter was marked by his tenure and by the gradual withdrawal of the third Caliph. Al-Andalus went through a serious succession crisis at this time, because the designated successor, Hisham, born in 965, was too young to rule. He had been only eight or nine years old in 974 when his father first introduced him to the process of government, and was still a minor when his father died. This was an extraordinary situation because neither the emirate nor caliphate had previously been in the hands of a child. Some schools of Islamic jurisprudence rejected the possibility of a minor becoming Caliph, but the Umayyad Al-Andalus tradition had secured the inheritance from parent to child, while the case of Abd al-Rahman III set a precedent for primogeniture. Faced with this situation, and despite the efforts of Al-Hakam during the last years of his reign to ensure the succession of his son by associating him with the tasks of government, there was division on the succession. Some favored the appointment of a regent, the chamberlain al-Mushafi, while others preferred to give the caliphal title to one of the brothers of the deceased Caliph, the twenty-seven-year-old al-Mughira, who was the favorite younger son of Abd al-Rahman III.

Two prominent Eastern European slaves (&quot;saqaliba&quot;) occupying important court positions – one, the uncle of the new Caliph – who were present at Al-Hakam&#x27;s death decided to take action before this division was more widely known. They moved to place al-Mughira on the throne, with the condition that he name his nephew Hisham as his heir, and to remove the chamberlain, al-Mushafi, thereby giving them ascendance at court over the faction supporting Hisham. The two, who would nonetheless occupy prominent places in the ceremony proclaiming Hisham once their plan was thwarted, had the support of the thousand &quot;saqalibas&quot; of the court and control of the palace guard. The chamberlain, who was the real center of political power after the death of al-Hakam and even in the last years of his reign, had pretended to support the conspirators, only to subvert them thanks to the support of Berber troops. He quickly broke up the plot with the help of Subh, and instructed Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, then a senior official and member of the court with privileged access to the young Caliph and his mother, to murder the pretender. The support of Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, the right hand of Subh, for the young caliph was crucial to his rise to power.

A reluctant but obedient Ibn Abi ʿĀmir surrounded al-Mughira&#x27;s residence with a detachment of one hundred soldiers, broke in and notified al-Mughira of the death of al-Hakam and the enthronement of Hisham II. The young uncle of Hisham expressed his loyalty, and in the face of Almanzor&#x27;s doubts, demanded compliance with the order for his own assassination. Al-Mughira was then strangled in front of his family in the living room of his house, and hung on a beam of the roof of an adjacent structure as if he had committed suicide. Al-Mushafi and Ibn Abi ʿĀmir thus fulfilled the wishes of their late master to ensure the accession of Hisham. The young Caliph&#x27;s supporters relied on the Berber guard, created by al-Hakam for his son, to face the &quot;saqalibas&quot;, more than eight hundred of which were expelled from the palace as a result of the crisis.

Hisham II was invested as caliph on or about Monday, 1 October 976, with the title of &quot;al-Mu&#x27;ayyad bi-llah&quot;, (&quot;one who receives the assistance of God&quot;). Ibn Abi ʿĀmir participated in the ceremony, recording in the minutes the oaths of fidelity the attendees made before the cadí. A week later, 8 October 976, Hisham named al-Mushafi &quot;hajib&quot; – chamberlain or prime minister – and made the 36-year-old Ibn Abi ʿĀmir the vizier and delegate of the &quot;hajib&quot;. The latter thus maintained a position of singular importance as the link between the new Caliph&#x27;s mother, in practice representing the government during the minority of Hisham, and the administration headed by al-Mushafi. The power was effectively in the hands of a triumvirate formed by chamberlain al-Mushafi, the vizier Ibn Abi ʿĀmir and General Ghalib. Subh, who had been associated with them in the past and now ruled in a way on their behalf; this triumvirate reported all important matters to her and consulted her and acted with her permission. They knew very well that without her support they could not win and stay in power in the uncertain and dangerous political spiral of the court, so they tried very hard to please her. To boost the popularity of the new Caliph among the population, and strengthen their own positions, they abolished the unpopular oil tax.

=== Ruin of al-Mushafi ===

While the alliance between Ibn Abi ʿĀmir and al-Mushafi had undermined the traditional power of the court slaves, relations between the two soon deteriorated. The Chamberlain&#x27;s failure to address the loss of prestige due to the succession intrigue and Christian incursions that in 976 almost reached the capital allowed Ibn Abi ʿĀmir to gain control of army troops in the capital of the Caliphate after assuring Subh of his ability to restore that military prestige. Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, unlike the chamberlain, was inclined towards the military response to Christian incursions and was willing to command a retaliatory strike. Al-Mushafi, however, had advocated a defensive strategy, that, despite Cordoban military power, had conceded the territories north of the Guadiana to the Christian states. At the same time, and also thanks to the influence of Subh, Ghalib obtained the government of the Lower March and command of the border armies.

In February 977, Ibn Abi ʿĀmir left the capital for his first campaigning season in Salamanca, following the strategy of containment of the Christian states maintained during the previous reign. His appointment as warden – head of an army – of the capital&#x27;s troops drew him into alliance with Ghalib – the warden of the border armies – and brought about the end of the triumvirate that the two had formed with al-Mushafi. In his first campaign, lasting nearly two months, he plundered the outskirts of the baths at Baños de Ledesma. and brought two thousand captured prisoners to Córdoba, but failed to take any fortresses. In autumn, he attacked Salamanca.

Ibn Abi ʿĀmir won military prestige by repulsing Christian forces and attacking Cuéllar during a second 977 campaign, and Salamanca in the autumn of the same year, not for conquest, but to weaken the enemy and gain domestic popularity. This new prestige allowed him to apply for the post of prefect of Córdoba, a role until then filled by a son of al-Mushafi. The new military reputation of Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, with the support of the harem and of Ghalib, allowed him to obtain the position without the chamberlain&#x27;s consent. This led to open confrontation between Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, hitherto an apparent faithful and efficient servant of the chamberlain, and al-Mushafi. The latter owed his power to the support of the previous caliph, and lacked firm support, being considered an upstart by the leading families in Córdoba&#x27;s governing administration. He tried to counter the alliance between the other two members of the triumvirate by marrying another of his sons to Ghalib&#x27;s daughter, Asma. Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, who had won the favor of the cunning mother of the Caliph, of Ghalib, and of major families of the civil service, skillfully intervened, using the intercession of Subh and directly addressing Ghalib to encourage him to withdraw his initial approval and instead allow Ibn Abi ʿĀmir himself to wed Ghalib&#x27;s daughter. The magnificent wedding was held in the spring of 978, eight months after the signing of the marriage contract sealed the alliance between Ghalib and Ibn Abi ʿĀmir and marked the decline of the power of the chamberlain. A few days after the wedding, Ghalib and Ibn Abi ʿĀmir left for a new campaign targeting Salamanca. Military successes increased the power of the two allies and further undermined the chamberlain at court. The two wardens received new titles as reward for their victories, and Ibn Abi ʿĀmir was named &#x27;double vizier&#x27;, for Interior and Defense, the two most important vizierships. Ghalib had been given the title of chamberlain at the end of 977 – an unprecedented situation as there had never been two chamberlains at the same time – depriving al-Mushafi of most of his duties, and al-Mushafi was subsequently dismissed and imprisoned. His relatives and supporters in positions of the Administration were arrested and his possessions confiscated. Ibn Abi ʿĀmir succeeded the defeated al-Mushafi as a second chamberlain for the Caliphate. The most important supporting positions were held by trusted people, in some cases family members. The elimination of the old chamberlain reduced the visibility of the Caliph, and Ibn Abi ʿĀmir gradually became the intermediary between his lord and the rest of the world. Aware that his power emanated from Hisham, Mansur was careful, however, to continue to maintain the appearance of the minor&#x27;s sovereignty.

Dissatisfaction with the royal minority and the regency fueled a new rebellion organized by prominent members of the court at the end of 978. The conspirators intended to replace Hisham with one of his cousins, a grandson of Abd al-Rahman III. An improvised attempt to stab the Caliph to death failed and led to the brutal repression of the conspirators at the insistence of Subh and Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, not without overcoming the resistance of major legal advisors. This ended attempts to replace the Caliph with another member of the Umayyad dynasty, resulting in the flight of any possible pretender from the capital, the close surveillance of members of the Umayyad family, and the construction the following year of a new fortified residence for Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, (the &quot;Resplendent City&quot;), work that went on until 989. This new residence, located east of Córdoba, housed troops loyal to Ibn Abi ʿĀmir and the governmental administration and was the center of a sumptuous court. In addition, to calm the malaise among the &quot;faqīh&quot; caused by the repression of the conspirators against Hisham&#x27;s legitimacy, in which some had colluded, he established a commission to expunge Al-Hakam&#x27;s library.

As a chamberlain, in the summer he had directed a new campaign that lasted more than two months, this time in the northeast against Pamplona and Barcelona. In the fall he made a new incursion into Ledesma lasting just over a month. In May the following year, he directed a new campaign in this region. The next incursion, during the summer, marched to Sepulveda. In September 979, he sent troops from Algeciras to the aid of Ceuta, threatened by the victorious campaign of Buluggin ibn Ziri, supported by the Fatimids, against Umayyad clients in the Western Maghreb. Later, the city became the center of Algerian Maghreb politics.

=== Showdown with Ghalib ibn Abd al-Rahman ===
Having crushed the opposition at court, the two co-leaders soon clashed. The old general resented prostrating before Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, who had devoted himself to strengthening his power and controlling access to the caliph. Ghalib believed the maneuvers of his ally, including the construction of his new palatial residence, the reinforcement of the Berber military units, and his increasing control over the Caliph, would eventually damage the dynasty. For his part, Ibn Abi ʿĀmir viewed his father-in-law&#x27;s continued military prestige as obscuring his own military prowess, despite successive victorious campaigns. After several joint raids into Christian lands, mainly led by the veteran Ghalib despite the growing military experience of Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, a confrontation erupted in the spring of 980, over a campaign around Atienza. Betrayed by Ghalib and wounded, his life only saved through the intercession of the Qadi of Medinaceli, Ibn Abi ʿĀmir reacted by immediately attacking the fortress where his father-in-law&#x27;s family was, and looted it once taken. Almanzor continued north, but the confrontation with Ghalib, fortified in Atienza, ended the larger campaign, intended to be his second against Castile since 975. Ghalib was forced into exile in Christian territory. In the fall, Mansur led a new offensive against &#x27;Almunia&#x27;, which is unidentified. Then in 981, a year of great martial activity for Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, he sent five military campaigns north, the first in February and March.

After several clashes between the co-leaders that ended favorably for Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, in April of 981, Ghalib, allied with Castile and Pamplona, defeated him. In May, Ibn Abi ʿĀmir counterattacked after having united Berber troops, his own Cordoban men, and some of the border units that his enemy had long commanded. Ghalib, meanwhile, had the backing of another part of the Caliphate&#x27;s border forces and his Castilian and Navarese allies. On the verge of achieving victory over his son-in-law on in the Battle of Torrevicente on 10 July 981, Ghalib was found dead in a ravine without signs of violence. He may have died of natural causes, being almost eighty years old. The troops of his rival, disconcerted by the death of their leader, largely passed to Ibn Abi ʿĀmir&#x27;s flag. Ghalib&#x27;s body was severely mutilated, first by his own troops at the direction of Ibn Abi ʿĀmir, who wanted to prove his enemy&#x27;s death, and then exposed in Córdoba. Several of his main allies were also killed in the battle, which gave the winner the nickname, Almanzor, (&quot;the Victorious&quot;) by which he is known to history. The passing of Ghalib made him sole chamberlain and allowed him to eliminate any possible opponents at court, although his legitimacy came only from his position as regent and the tolerance of the Caliph&#x27;s mother. With the elimination of Ghalib, the power of the Caliph became concentrated in his person.

That same year, he looted Zamora and its surroundings in September. A month later, he attacked Portuguese lands, probably Viseu.

=== Alliance with the queen mother and troubled government ===
For twenty years, until the breakup of his alliance with the caliph&#x27;s powerful mother in 996, Ibn Abi ʿĀmir acted in part as her representative, advisor, treasurer, mediator, informant, and her commander of the armies and the police. It was she who made most of the decisions, in consultation with her son&#x27;s regents. She was aware of all the political developments of the government and the court and was a dominant force in factional struggles. Subh had a lot of trust and affection for Almanzor, and her support for him was so obvious to everyone that it caused rumors that they were in love. From the reign of Caliph Al-Hakam II to the new Caliph Hisham, it was Subh&#x27;s patronage, apart from his own ability, that promoted him and removed his opponents from the court. 

Despite years of competition at court for power and administration by others, however, the Caliph, upon reaching his majority, made no move to assume control, possibly due to some kind of illness or other inability to carry out the responsibilities of his position. The historian, Al-Dhahabi, attributes Almanzor&#x27;s locking up the Caliph to the latter being &quot;feeble minded, believing what can&#x27;t be true&quot;. For example, someone brought him a piece of rock, saying it is from Jerusalem&#x27;s site of the prophet&#x27;s ascent to heaven. The Caliph rewarded him with a lot of gold. In another instance, someone presented him with a donkey&#x27;s hoof, claiming it is Uzair&#x27;s donkey, and he was also rewarded. Yet another person brought him hair, claiming it is the prophet&#x27;s.

Almanzor not only assumed the caliphal power, but also roles as guardian of the incapacitated Caliph and guarantor of dynastic power. The fact that he merely controlled the administration and army on behalf of Hisham, however, made him expendable, so he took steps to strengthen his position. The capital was placed in the hands of a cousin of his, who controlled it tightly, and he elevated a series of supporters, generally unpopular and considered despotic, who managed to gain control of various Taifas after the disintegration of the Caliphate. He also allied himself with important border lords.

In 988 and 989 he had to face a double threat: a long drought that caused famine and forced him to apply some social measures to alleviate the shortage (delivery of bread or rescission of taxes, among others) and the emergence of a new rebellion against him in which his eldest son sought to replace him. Almanzor managed to disrupt the conspiracy, which had been joined by the governor of Zaragoza, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Muhammad of the Banu Tujib, and that of Toledo, an Umayyad descendant of Caliph Al-Hakam I, &#x27;Abd Allah bin Abd al-&#x27;Aziz al-Marwanid also known as Abdullah &quot;Piedra Seca&quot;, but his efforts to get his son to submit proved fruitless. The latter took refuge with the Castilians after the arrest of his fellow conspirators. Almanzor launched a successful campaign against Castile and took custody of his wayward son, who was tried and beheaded at dawn on 8 September 990. Almanzor, still reeling from his eldest son&#x27;s betrayal, disowned him, while also ordering those who had killed him at Almanzor&#x27;s command to themselves be executed. The governor of Zaragoza would be executed in his presence while he spared the life of &quot;Piedra Seca&quot;--perhaps because Almanzor did not want to stain his hands with Umayyad blood.

Almanzor also clashed with some of his enemy&#x27;s satirical poets, including Abu Yafar al Mushafi (d. 982) and Yûsuf ibn Hârûn al-Ramâdî (d. 1012–3), known as Abû Ceniza. Persecuted and subsequently forgiven, Abû Ceniza went to Barcelona in 986. Ibrahim ibn Idrís al-Hassani also paid for his satire of Almanzor with exile in Africa. Almanzor threw the poet Abu Marwan al-Jaziri in prison, where he died in 1003.

== Almanzor, leader of al-Andalus ==
=== Rupture with Subh and concentration of political power ===

With Ghalib eliminated and Hisham unable to perform his duties as Caliph, Almanzor began to weigh preparing for the succession, and even the possibility of officially taking power. In 989, he tried unsuccessfully to have the &quot;faqīhs&quot; accept his home, Medina Alzahara, as a major mosque. From 991 he positioned his son Abd al-Malik in a similar way as Al-Hakam had done with Hisham, appointing him chamberlain and supreme warden of the Caliphate&#x27;s armies, although Almanzor did not step aside from those roles himself. At the same time, he discreetly presented to the &quot;faqīhs&quot; who advised the senior Qadi the possibility that he himself might replace the Caliph because Hisham was incapable and no one else in the state could hold the position. The regency, formerly founded on Hisham&#x27;s minority, could no longer be justified by his mere inability to carry out his functions. The opinion of the &quot;faqīhs&quot;, however, was negative: if not Hisham, according to the legal experts, power should devolve to another member of the tribe of Muhammad. Almanzor reluctantly accepted the decision, and in the following years he gradually assumed even greater powers, corresponding to those of the Caliph: he confirmed the official appointments with his own seal rather than that of the Caliph, in spite of nominally acting on his behalf, he appointed a new mint official, appropriated new titles and moved part of the administration to . He also had his name mentioned after that of the Caliph in Friday prayers and maintained a court parallel to that of the sovereign at al-Zahira. In 991, under pressure from the chamberlain, the council of &quot;faqīhs&quot; changed their unfavorable opinion as to the conversion of Medina Alzahira into a major mosque, although its use continued to be frowned upon by many notable Cordobans.

His attempts to seize power ended the long alliance between Almanzor and Subh in 996. After twenty years as a representative of Subh, Almanzor confronted the Caliph&#x27;s mother and her supporters. After the collapse of the alliance, Subh tried with all her might to eliminate Almanzor and united with all his opponents and enemies and divided the court into two factions, a group supporting Almanzor and the survival of his power and another group supporting Subh whose goal was to take over the government by her son. The clash between the two cliques was triggered by Subh withdrawing eighty thousand dinars from the royal treasury to finance an uprising against the chamberlain. Almanzor discovered this thanks to his agents in the palace, and he reacted by successfully petitioning the council of viziers and &quot;Faqīhs&quot; to transfer the treasury to his residence, , characterizing Subh&#x27;s theft as a robbery by the harem. With Almanzor sick, Subh took over the palace and tried in vain to block the transfer. Abd al-Malik, Almanzor&#x27;s son, won the support of the viziers. The Caliph repudiated the rebellion of his mother in late May 996, and Abd al-Malik took custody of both him and the treasure. Though the rebellion she headed on the peninsula lost steam due to loss of funding and the rapid defeat of its few supporters, the money she had previously taken allowed Subh to finance a rebellion in the Maghreb. Although Almanzor had not yet managed to quell this revolt by fall 997, it failed to gain any support on the peninsula.

To reinforce his image and that of his son and successor, Almanzor organized a parade with the Caliph and his mother. The gesture served to dispel any doubts about the support of the Caliph for Almanzor, and thus refuted the allegations of Ziri ibn Atiyya, launched from the Maghreb. After the procession, Hisham was locked up – with all the comforts but without power – in , where his mother was probably also imprisoned. Having lost her confrontation with her former ally, she died shortly thereafter in 999. Almanzor, who had renewed his oath of allegiance to the Caliph with the proviso that he delegate his powers to his family, was strengthened. He sent his son to fight the North African rebellion, and took charge of all administrative power. He counted on the approval of the religious leadership who, fearing possible civil war, supported Almanzor&#x27;s position as guarantor of stability and of the throne of the impotent Hisham. State power was divided in two: with Almanzor blocking exercise of the symbolic and legitimate power of the Caliph, while that of the chamberlain and his successors, devoid of legitimacy for being Yemeni Mofarite and not of the Prophet&#x27;s blood, controlled the Caliphate&#x27;s policy.

=== Reform of army and administration ===
The separation between the temporal power, held by Almanzor, and the spiritual, in the hands of Hisham as Caliph, increased the importance of military force, a symbol – along with the new majesty of the chamberlain&#x27;s court, rival of that of the caliph himself – of the power of Almanzor, and an instrument to guarantee the payment of taxes.

Almanzor successfully continued the military reforms begun by Al-Hakam and his predecessors, covering many aspects. On one hand, he increased the professionalization of the regular army, necessary both to guarantee his military power in the capital and to ensure the availability of forces for his numerous campaigns, one of the sources of his political legitimacy. This policy de-emphasized levies and other non-professional troops, which he replaced with taxes used to support the professional troops—often &quot;saqalibas&quot; or Maghrebis—which freed the natives of al-Andalus from military service. Recruitment of &quot;saqalibas&quot; and Berbers was not new, but Almanzor expanded it. On the other hand, he created new units, unlike the regular army of the Caliphate, that were faithful primarily to himself and served to control the capital. Emir Abd al-Rahman I had already used Berbers and &quot;saqalibas&quot; for a permanent army of forty thousand to end the conflicts that hitherto had plagued the emirate. At the time of Emir Muhammad I, the army reached thirty-five to forty thousand combatants, half of them Syrian military contingents. This massive hiring of mercenaries and slaves meant that, according to Christian chroniclers, &quot;ordinarily the Saracen armies amount to 30, 40, 50, or 60,000 men, even when in serious occasions they reach 100, 160, 300 and even 600,000 fighters.&quot; In fact, it has been argued that, in Almanzor&#x27;s time, the Cordovan armies could muster six hundred thousand laborers and two hundred thousand horses &quot;drawn from all provinces of the empire.&quot;
In order to eliminate a possible threat to his power and to improve military efficiency, Almanzor abolished the system of tribal units that had been in decline due to lack of Arabs and institution of pseudo-feudalism on the frontiers, in which the different tribes each had their own commander and that had caused continuous clashes, and replaced it with mixed units without clear loyalty under orders from Administration officials. The nucleus of the new army, however, was formed increasingly by Maghrebi Berber forces. The ethnic rivalries among Arabs, Berbers and Slavs within the Andalusi army were skillfully used by Almanzor to maintain his own power--for example, by ordering that every unit of the army consist of diverse ethnic groups so that they would not unite against him; and thus preventing the emergence of possible rivals. However, once their centralizing figure disappeared, these units were one of the main causes of the 11th-century civil war called the &quot;Fitna of al-Andalus&quot;. Berber forces were also joined by contingents of well-paid Christian mercenaries, who formed the bulk of Almanzor&#x27;s personal guard and participated in his campaigns in Christian territories. Almanzor&#x27;s completion of this reform, begun by his predecessors, fundamentally divided the population into two unequal groups: a large mass of civilian taxpayers and a small professional military caste, generally from outside the peninsula.

The increase in military forces and their partial professionalization led to an increase in financial expenses to sustain them. This represented an additional incentive to carry out campaigns, which produced loot and land with which to pay the troops. These lands, when handed over to the soldiers as payment, were thereafter subject to tribute and ceased to operate under a system of border colonization. The Caliphal army was funded by the taxpaying farmers in exchange for military exemptions, and consisted of local recruits as well as foreign mercenaries – Berber militias, Slav and Black slaves, mercenary Christian companies and jihadi volunteers. At that time al-Andalus was known as &quot;Dar Jihad&quot;, or &quot;country of jihad&quot;, and attracted many volunteers, and though these were relatively few compared to the total army, their zeal in combat more than compensated for this.

According to modern studies, these mercenary contingents made it possible to increase the total size of the Caliphal army from thirty or fifty thousand troops in the time of Abd al-Rahman III to fifty or ninety thousand. Others, like Évariste Lévi-Provençal, argue that the Cordoban armies in the field with the Almanzor were between thirty-five thousand and seventy or seventy-five thousand soldiers. Contemporary figures are contradictory: some accounts claim that their armies numbered two hundred thousand horsemen and six hundred thousand foot soldiers, while others talk about twelve thousand horsemen, three thousand mounted Berbers and two thousand &quot;sūdān&quot;, African light infantry. According to the chronicles, in the campaign that swept Astorga and León, Almanzor led twelve thousand African and five thousand Al Andalus horsemen, and forty thousand infantry. It is also said that, in his last campaigns, he mobilized forty-six thousand horsemen, while another six hundred guarded the train, twenty-six thousand infantry, two hundred scouts or &#x27;police&#x27; and one hundred and thirty drummers. or that the garrison of Cordoba consisted of 10,500 horsemen and many others kept the northern border in dispersed detachments. However, it is much more likely that the leader&#x27;s armies, even in their most ambitious campaigns, may not have exceeded twenty thousand men. It can be argued that until the eleventh century no Muslim army on campaign exceeded thirty thousand troops, while during the eighth century the trans-Pyrenean expeditions totaled ten thousand men and those carried out against Christians in the north of the peninsula were even smaller.

In the time of Emir Al-Hakam I, a palatine guard of 3000 riders and 2000 infantry was created, all Slavic slaves. This proportion between the two types of troops was maintained until Almanzor&#x27;s reforms. The massive incorporation of North African horsemen relegated the infantry to sieges and fortress garrisons. This reform led to entire tribes, particularly Berber riders, being moved to the peninsula.

The main weapon of the peninsular campaigns, which required speed and surprise, was the light cavalry. To try to counteract them, the Castilians created the role of &quot;villain knights&quot; – ennobling those free men who were willing to keep a horse to increase the mounted units – through the &quot;Fuero de Castrojeriz&quot; of 974. For similar reasons, the Barcelonan count Borrell II created the figure of the &quot;homes of paratge&quot;- who obtained privileged military status by fighting against the Cordobans armed on horseback – after losing their capital in the fall of 985. In contrast to the prominent role the navy had played in previous decades under Abd al-Rahman III, under Almanzor it served only as a means of transporting ground troops, such as between the Maghreb and the Iberian Peninsula, or Alcácer do Sal&#x27;s ships in the campaign against Santiago de Compostela in 997.

During this time, military industry flourished in factories around Córdoba. It was said to be able to produce a thousand bows and twenty thousand arrows monthly, and 1300 shields and three thousand campaign stores annually.

As for the fleet, its network of ports was reinforced with a new base in the Atlantic, in Alcácer do Sal, which protected the area of Coimbra, recovered in the 980s, and served as the origin of the units that participated in the campaign against Santiago. On the Mediterranean shore, the naval defense was centered at the base of al-Mariya, now Almería. The dockyards of the fleet had been built in Tortosa in 944.

Initially the maritime defense of the Caliphate was led by Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Rumahis, a veteran admiral who had served Al-Hakam II and was Qadi of Elvira and Pechina. He repulsed raids by &quot;al-Magus&quot; (idolaters) or &quot;al-Urdumaniyun&quot; (&#x27;men of the north&#x27;, vikings), in the west of al-Andalus in mid-971; at the end of that year, when they tried to invade Al Andalus, the admiral left Almería and defeated them off the coast of Algarve. In April 973, he transported the army of Ghalib from Algeciras to subdue the rebellious tribes of the Maghreb and end Fatimid ambitions in that area. As in 997, when the Al Andalus fleet hit the Galician coast, in 985 it had ravaged the Catalans. During the Catalan campaign, Gausfred I, Count of Empurias and Roussillon, tried to gather an army to help the locals but then several flotillas of Berber pirates threatened their coasts, forcing them to stay to defend their lands.

To ensure control of the military, Almanzor eliminated the main figures who could have opposed his reforms: in addition to the death of Ghalib, the participation of the governor of Zaragoza in the plot of his eldest son served as a justification to replace him with another, more amenable, member of the same clan, the Banu Tujib. The admiral of the fleet, who maintained a significant budget, was poisoned in January 980 and replaced by a man faithful to Almanzor.

As in the Army he encouraged the recruitment of Berbers faithful to him, so in the Administration he favored the &quot;saqalibas&quot; to the detriment of native officials, again with the aim of surrounding himself with personnel loyal only to him.

Land transport routes were dotted with strongholds, since ancient Al Andalus dignitaries sought to control communications. Messengers were bought in Sudan and specially trained to handle Almanzor&#x27;s messages and to transmit the official reports that his foreign ministries wrote about the annual campaigns.

The Caliphate ruled by Almanzor was a rich and powerful state. According to Colmeiro, it is estimated that in a pre-industrial society, for every million inhabitants, ten thousand soldiers could be mustered. Even assuming the chronicles exaggerated tenfold the real numbers – these speak of eight hundred thousand soldiers – the caliphate could have had eight million inhabitants. Those who use more bullish criteria estimate between seven and ten million, but the population was probably much fewer. Traditionally speaking, around the year 1000, the caliphate occupied four hundred thousand square kilometers and was populated by three million souls. By comparison, the Iberian Christian states comprised one hundred and sixty thousand square kilometers and half a million people. By the 10th century, 75% of the population under the Umayyads had converted to Islam, a number reaching 80% two centuries later. By comparison, at the time of the Muslim invasion, Spain had about four million inhabitants, although there is no shortage of historians who would raise that estimate to seven or eight million.

His realm also had large cities like Córdoba, which surpassed one hundred thousand inhabitants; Toledo, Almería and Granada, which were around thirty thousand; and Zaragoza, Valencia and Málaga, all above fifteen thousand. This contrasted sharply with the Christian north of the peninsula, which lacked large urban centers.

=== Defense of religious orthodoxy and legitimation of power ===
One of the instruments Almazor used to strengthen his power was his court, at which writers and poets celebrated his virtues—praise that was used as propaganda among the people.
The stability and prosperity of the regime and its rigorous defense of Islam, which Almanzor showed through various pious gestures, gave him popular support. Also numbered among these gestures were copying a Koran that he took with him during his campaigns, and the expansion of the mosque of Cordoba (987–990). The political ambitions of the chamberlain had important repercussions on culture and religion, which he was forced to support. His image as Islam&#x27;s leader led to the censorship of some sciences considered non-Islamic, and to the purging from Al-Hakam&#x27;s important library of works considered heretical. His political interests required him to ingratiate himself with the lawyers when his power was still unsteady, and led him to censure logic, philosophy and astrology, despite his appreciation for culture. His meddling in religious matters led to the appointment of his own uncle, himself a veteran qadi, as the principal qadi after the death of the hostile Ibn Zarb, who had opposed some of his proposals. The main expression of his defense of religion, however, was his military campaigns against the Christian states, a method of legitimization that the caliphs had used before but which Almanzor took to extremes. Successive victories, despite their transient benefits to the realm, had a great propaganda effect, both in the Caliphate and in the enemy states of the north. To each crisis of his political career, he responded with large and/or multiple military campaigns.

The campaigns also had a beneficial economic effect because of the loot – especially abundant slaves – obtained by them and because of the security they granted to the borders.

=== The Maghreb campaigns ===
The meager Cordoban cereal production forced the Umayyads to obtain stocks from the Maghreb, and, thus, to oppose Fatimid expansion in the region, which jeopardized their supply. At stake was commercial control of the western Mediterranean. Unlike his campaigns on the Iberian Peninsula and with the exception of the one carried out jointly with Ghalib at the beginning of his career, Almanzor did not take a personal role in the fighting in the Maghreb, but simply a supervisory one. The effective direction of the fight was in the hands of subordinates, whom he would ceremonially accompany to Algeciras to see off the troops as they crossed the strait.

Abd al-Rahman III had conquered Ceuta and Tangier and fortified them in 951, but he had not been able to prevent the Fatimids from taking control of the Maghreb in 958–959, after burning the Umayyad fleet in Almería in 955. In 971, Umayyad clients suffered another heavy defeat. The Fatimid march to Egypt around 972 benefitted the Umayyads, who were left facing a Fatimid client, the Sanhaja Berber Buluggin ibn Ziri.
The Caliphate&#x27;s strategy began by the fortification of Ceuta, manned by a large garrison. In May of 978, the Zenata tribes seized the city of Sijilmasa, at the northern end of the trans-Saharan gold, salt and textile trading routes, and where they founded a pro-Córdoba principality ruled by Jazrun ibn Fulful, the city&#x27;s conqueror. The success of the Umayyad political machine, continued by Almanzor, allowed him to concentrate the offensive power of the Berber tribes on the expansion of the regions that recognized his legitimacy and limited clashes among those accepting Córdoba&#x27;s protection. This conquest, which gave great prestige to Hisham and Almanzor—and affronted the Fatimids because it was the city where its founder had appeared before the Berber Kutama tribe--allowed them to counteract the influence of the Fatimids who, after moving to Egypt, had left these regions under the control of the Zirid dynasty. Ibn Ziri launched a victorious campaign that temporarily disrupted the Zenata and allowed him to recover much of the Western Maghreb before besieging Ceuta. The refugees there asked for help from Almanzor, who sent a large army that he accompanied as far as Algeciras, to repulse Ibn Ziri, who decided to retire although he continued harassing Umayyad supporters until his death in 984. The effects of Ibn Ziri&#x27;s inroads, however, were transient: at his death most of the tribes of the region once again accepted Cordoban religious authority.

In 985, before the Idrisid Al-Hasan ibn Kannun, who had proclaimed himself Caliph, returned from his refuge in the Fatimid court in Egypt, Almanzor saw off a new army that crossed the Maghreb to confront him under command of his cousin. Reinforcements were later dispatched, commanded by the eldest son of Almanzor, and his father-in-law, the governor of Zaragoza. Overwhelmed, the Idrisid negotiated his surrender and proceeded to the Cordoban court, but Almanzor had him assassinated on his way to the city, and later executed his cousin who had granted safe conduct to the rebel.

The disagreements among the various tribal leaders loyal to the Umayyads did produce one crisis: the favor shown by Almanzor to Ziri ibn Atiyya of the Maghrawa Berbers upset other chiefs, who ended up rising in arms. They defeated the Cordoban governor of Fez, who died in combat, and Ibn Atiyya in April 991. After this defeat, Almanzor understood the need to grant control of the region to local Berber leaders instead of trying to govern through Iberian delegates. This strategy aimed to attract the support of local tribes to the Umayyads. Fundamentally, the fate of the campaigns depended on the changing loyalties of the various tribal leaders, although, in general, the Zenata supported the Umayyads while the Sanhaja supported the Fatimids. Almanzor unsuccessfully attempted to divide the territory between Ibn Attiya and another tribal chief who had abandoned the Fatimids—the uncle of al-Mansur ibn Buluggin, son and successor of Buluggin ibn Ziri. So, Almanzor gave all lands controlled by the Caliphate to Ibn Atiyya, who managed to defeat the rebels and supporters of the Fatimids in 994, and founded a small principality centered on Oujda.

The crisis between Almanzor and the royal family in 996–998 caused a confrontation between him and Ibn Atiyya, who considered Almanzor&#x27;s attitude towards the Caliph to be disrespectful. Seeing in Ibn Atiyya a threat to his power, Almanzor dismissed him and sent forces to combat him. The Banu Maghrawa, the Banu Ifran and Banu Miknasa joined the Al Andalus forces landing at Tangier, soon receiving reinforcements commanded by the Almanzor&#x27;s son, already chamberlain. At the beginning of August 998, Almanzor himself went to Algeciras with the numerous reinforcements destined to participate in the campaign. In October 998, Abd al-Malik managed to defeat Ibn Atiyya and put him to flight, although Almanzor still sought local support for the Umayyad administration. Until his death, however, the territorial government remained in the hands of successive Iberian officials.

The campaigns in the Maghreb also had an important consequence for Iberian politics: Almanzor brought Berber troops and warlords to the peninsula, both to form his personal troops and as contingents in the campaigns against Christian territories. Some of these leaders were even named viziers, which did not prevent their occasional fall from grace.

== Campaigns against Christians ==
=== Raids ===
==== General characteristics ====
Since the death of Ramiro II of León in 950, his kingdom along with the kingdom of Pamplona and the county of Barcelona had been forced to recognize Cordoba&#x27;s sovereignty through an annual tribute, with default resulting in reprisal campaigns. Almanzor began carrying these out in 977 and he continued to do so until his death in 1002, although most were concentrated in his later years when he was most powerful. In parallel with the Maghreb campaigns, Almanzor was devoted to the war against the Christian kingdoms of Iberia. Although the various sources are in conflict on the precise details, it is estimated that he made about fifty-six campaigns, twenty of these being in the first period from 977 to 985. In these offensives, Almanzor balanced attacks on centers of political and economic power with those against sites of religious importance. The famous raids, cavalry strikes and &quot;aceiphas&quot;, literally &quot;summer campaigns&quot; and called by the Christians &quot;cunei&quot;, had as their tactical and economic objective the taking of captives and cattle from the enemy; strategically they sought to generate a state of permanent insecurity that prevented Christians from developing an organized life outside of castles, fortified cities or their immediate vicinity. Their main feature was the short duration of the campaigns and the remoteness of the points reached by them. In spite of the military success of the many incursions, they failed to prevent in the long term ruin of the state. Although they halted the advance of Christian repopulation and dismantled important fortresses and cities, they failed to significantly alter the boundaries because Almanzor rarely occupied the territories he plundered.

The region most affected and vulnerable to the campaigns was the Douro valley. This was the destination for Christian settlers who were driven to repopulate it due to demographic pressure in Asturias, the heartland of the kingdom. This area was protected by the Cantabrian Mountains, a narrow strip of land that nonetheless could defend itself—unlike Leon or Galicia, which were more vulnerable to Moorish cavalry raids. In fact, Almanzor&#x27;s campaigns reached all of Christian Spain with the exception of the Cantabrian coast, and contributed to León and Galicia coming more solidly under the sovereignty of the Asturian Crown, but still with great autonomy, due to the weakness of the kingdom&#x27;s expansion.

==== First campaigns with Ghalib ====
The first eight campaigns were carried out with the support of his father-in-law Ghalib. Among them were three in the Salamanca lands (two in 977 and one in 978), another against Cuéllar (the same year), one against Pamplona and Barcelona (the long summer campaign of 978), one against Zamora (or maybe Ledesma, according to other authors, in the spring of 979) and one against Sepúlveda (in the summer of 979, which he could not take, although he razed its surroundings). The eighth was one in which he accompanied to Algeciras the forces destined to Maghreb, between September 979 and early 980.

The ninth campaign, in the spring of 980, was that during which the rupture between Almanzor and Ghalib took place and is known as &quot;the one of betrayal&quot; for Ghalib&#x27;s surprise assault on Almanzor&#x27;s son-in-law at Atienza. The confrontation followed a short raid through Castilla. The next four offensives (one in the fall of 980, two in the spring of the following year and one in the summer) took place during the conflict between the two rivals. During the last campaign – that of Almanzor&#x27;s victory over Ghalib, he regained control of the fortresses of Atienza and Calatayud, held by partisans of his rival.

==== Weakening of León and harassment of the Castilian border ====

As a result of the defeat of Ghalib in the summer of 981, Almanzor&#x27;s forces continued their advance, looting and destroying the lands around Zamora at the end of the summer. Later, they defeated Pamplona, León and Castile at the Battle of Rueda (or Roa) and recovered Simancas, which was razed. The loss of Simancas disrupted the Christian defensive line along the Duero, which later campaigns eventually dismantled. These losses, along with Almanzor&#x27;s support for rivals to the Leonine crown, first Bermudo against the weakened Ramiro III and later rival counts, one of which briefly took the throne, plunged León into a political crisis that it submitted to Almanzor for arbitration. In general, Almanzor supported the noble families opposed to the monarch of the moment to take advantage of intra-Leonese squabbles. From 977, he launched attacks into León&#x27;s territories almost annually.

The Galician and Portuguese counts, hostile to Ramiro III as they had been to his father, sought to appease Almanzor after the Trancoso and Viseu campaign of the beginning of the winter of 981 and for this they sought to impose a new king, Bermudo II, crowned in October 982 in Santiago while Almanzor pillaged the outskirts of León. Castile and León, continually exposed to Cordoban assaults, on the other hand, supported Ramiro. In 983, Almanzor plundered the area surrounding Salamanca in the fall, after failing to take it, and Sacramenia at the beginning of winter, slaughtering the men and taking the rest of the population captive. In his attempt to halt the Christian advance south of the Duero, he continued assailing the Leonese and Castilian positions in this area and the most important points of repopulation, such as Zamora (984) or Sepúlveda the same year, razed before he fell on Barcelona. The destruction of Sepúlveda forced Ramiro to submit to Córdoba in 985, the year of his death due to natural causes, as Bermudo had done before. Bermudo&#x27;s submission had been accompanied by that of other Portuguese and Galician counts. This imposed the presence of Cordoban forces on the Leonese kingdom, as a protectorate, which it remained until 987.

The expulsion of the Cordoban troops from León by Bermudo triggered the 988 campaign against Coimbra and the torching of the Monastery of San Pedro de Eslonza in the first retaliatory campaign in 986, in which he also took León, Zamora, Salamanca and Alba de Tormes before attacking Condeixa.


==== Attacks on Pamplona and the Catalan counties ====
In 982, he launched the &quot;campaign of the three nations&#x27; possibly against Castile, Pamplona and the Girona Franks, that forced the king of Pamplona, Sancho II to give to Almanzor a daughter, who would take the name Abda. This union would produce the last of Almanzor&#x27;s political dynasty, Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo. In 985, exploiting the subjugation of León and Castile, he attacked Barcelona, which he managed to take in early July, treating it harshly. Almanzor had previously attacked the region in the summer of 978, when for several months he ravaged the plains of Barcelona and parts of Tarragona, conquered by the Barcelona counts some decades earlier. In an almost three-month-long campaign, he captured the city with the help of the fleet, imprisoned Viscount Udalard I and Archdeacon Arnulf and sacked the monasteries of Sant Cugat del Vallés and Sant Pere de les Puelles.

==== New campaigns against León and Castile ====
In 987, he made two campaigns against Coimbra, conquering it during the second on 28 June. Unlike previous offensives, focused on looting and destruction, this time he repopulated the area with Muslims, who held the area until 1064. In 988 and 989, he again ravaged the Leonese Duero valley. He assaulted Zamora, Toro, León and Astorga, which controlled access to Galicia, and forced Bermudo to take refuge among the Galician counts.

After concentrating most of his attacks on León, he went on to launch his forces against Castile from 990, previously the object of only four of thirty-one campaigns. The west of León would, however, suffer one last attack in December 990, in which Montemor-o-Velho and Viseu, on the defensive line of the Mondego River, were surrendered, probably as punishment for the asylum that Bermudo had granted to the Umayyad &quot;Piedra Seca&quot;. The failed collusion of his son Abd Allah and the governors of Toledo and Zaragoza triggered a change of objective. Fearing his father&#x27;s anger over his participation in the plot along with the arrested governor of Zaragoza, Abd Allah had fled to take refuge with count García Fernández of Castile. As punishment and to force the surrender of his son, the chamberlain took and armed Osma in August. The broad raid achieved its goal and on 8 September, the Castilian count returned to Abdullah to his father in return for a two-year truce. Moving on from Castile, the following year he attacked the kingdom of Pamplona. Sancho II tried to appease the Cordoban leader with a visit to the capital of the Caliphate at the end of 992, but this failed to prevent his lands from being subject to a new foray in 994. The last half of the decade saw general submission of Pamplona to the Caliphate along with its repeated attempts to avoid any punitive Cordoban campaigns.

In 993 Almanzor attacked Castile again, for unknown reasons, but failed to take San Esteban de Gormaz, simply looting its surroundings. He succeeded in taking it the following year, along with Clunia. The loss of San Esteban dismantled Castilian defenses along the Douro, while the taking of Clunia endangered lands south of the Arlanza.

At the end of 994, on the occasion of the wedding between Bermudo II and a daughter of the Castilian count, Almanzor took León and Astorga, the Leonese capital since 988, and devastated the territory, perhaps also intending to facilitate a future campaign against Santiago de Compostela. In May 995, the Castilian Count Garcia Fernandez was wounded and taken prisoner in a skirmish near the Duero and, despite the care of his captors, he died in Medinaceli. He was succeeded by his prudent son Sancho, who had fought with Córdoba against his father and managed to maintain an informal truce with the Caliphate between 995 and 1000. The ties between Castile and the chamberlain were sealed with delivery of one of the new count&#x27;s sisters to Almanzor as a wife or concubine. Urraca Sanchez, nicknamed &quot;the Basque&quot;, adopted the Arabic name Abda after being given to Almanzor by her father Sancho II of Pamplona. Urraca and Almanzor had a single son, named Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo that became chief minister of Hisham II, Caliph of Córdoba. As retribution for the support of the former count by the Banu Gómez, counts of Saldaña and former allies of Córdoba, their seat of Carrión was attacked in a raid that reached the monastery of San Román de Entrepeñas. At the end of 995, a new incursion against Aguiar, southeast of Porto, forced Bermudo II to return the former Umayyad conspirator &quot;Piedra Seca.&quot;

==== Santiago de Compostela and his later campaigns ====
In 996, he again launched a raid on León and destroyed Astorga to force them to resume the tribute payments. In the summer of 997, he devastated Santiago de Compostela, after the Bishop, Pedro de Mezonzo, evacuated the city. In a combined operation involving his own land troops, those of Christian allies and the fleet, Almanzor&#x27;s forces reached the city in mid-August. They burned the pre-Romanesque temple dedicated to the apostle James the Great, and said to contain his tomb. The prior removal of the saint&#x27;s relics allowed the continuity of the Camino de Santiago, a pilgrimage route that had begun to attract pilgrims in the previous century. The campaign was a great triumph for the chamberlain at a delicate political moment, as it coincided with the breakdown of his long alliance with Subh. The Leonese setback was so great that it allowed Almanzor to settle a Muslim population in Zamora on his return from Santiago, while the bulk of the troops in Leonese territory remained in Toro. He then imposed peace terms on the Christian magnates that allowed him to forego campaigning in the north in 998, the first year this happened since 977.

In 999, he made his last foray to the eastern borderlands, where, after passing through Pamplona, he sacked Manresa and the plains of Bages. In April he attacked the County of Pallars, governed by the kin of the mother of count Sancho García of Castile. It is suggested that the attacks could have been triggered by the Pamplonan king and Catalan counts ceasing to pay tribute to Córdoba, taking advantage of Almanzor&#x27;s distraction in crushing Ziri ibn Atiyya.

Also in 999, the death of Bermudo II in September produced a new minority in León through the ascent to the throne of Alfonso V, but this did not prevent the formation of a broad anti-Córdoba alliance that united not just the people of Pamplona and Castile, but also the ancient Christian clients of Almanzor. Sancho of Castile, until then a faithful ally who had managed to avoid the incursions of Córdoba into his territory, joined the alliance and provoked Almanzor into launching an attack. To his great surprise, the Castilian Count assembled a large force bringing together his own troops and those of his allies, who intercepted the Córdoban units north of Clunia in a strong defensive position. In the hard-fought battle of Cervera (29 July 1000), Almanzor&#x27;s side gained the victory, after the rout of much of his army through the intervention of eight hundred cavalry.

After the victory, at the end of the year Almanzor made another strike at the western border, where he took Montemor-o-Velho on December 2, 1000, after overcoming fierce resistance. For its part, the kingdom of Pamplona suffered several attacks after the defeat of Cervera, in 1000 and again in 1001 and 1002. After Cervera, Almanzor accelerated the number of strikes, despite being sick and needing to be carried on a litter at times.

His last campaign, also victorious, was made in 1002, when he was mortally ill, having suffered from gouty arthritis for twenty years. He aimed to avenge the quasi-rout of Cervera and punish the Castilian count Sancho, architect of the alliance that almost defeated him. San Millán de la Cogolla, dedicated to the patron saint of Castile and in the territory of Pamplona, allied with Sancho, was sacked and burned; in Pamplona, Almanzor ordered a retreat due to his worsening health, and he died en route to Córdoba before reaching the capital.

The victorious campaigns of Almanzor were due to his skills as a military tactician and the army he commanded, which was a highly professionalized force of a size that dwarfed any counterattack that the Christian kings and counts could mount to meet him: &quot;rarely above 1000 knights or 2000 or 3000 men in total.&quot; They had few weeks in spring or summer to gather what was often no more than a few hundred knights and men. &quot;The most frequent average seems to have been a knight for every two or three auxiliary riders (squires and others) and one of these for every two or three peons.&quot; In those days an army of ten or fifteen thousand men – a third knights and the rest peons – was the maximum concentration of forces that a medieval ruler could muster when presenting battle. For example, Muslim campaigns had formations of only one thousand to ten thousand men. &quot;An army of ten or fifteen thousand men is considered in every way exceptional and few historians would be willing to admit that on some occasion that number was actually reached by a host during a battle.&quot;

In his campaigns Almanzor emphasized cavalry operations, so much so that he had reserved the islands of the Guadalquivir for horse breeding. These marshes around Seville, Huelva and Cádiz had suitable pastures for raising horses. Mules were imported from the Balearic Islands and camels from Africa, the latter raised in the semi-desert area between Murcia and Lorca. According to Vallvé, &quot;Normally participating in his campaigns were twelve thousand horsemen, enrolled in the military hierarchy and provided, in addition to that customarily due the usual soldier, with a horse with their harnesses, weapons, accommodation, payments and bonuses for various expenses, and fodder for their horses, based on their role.&quot;

==== Loot and slaves ====
Almanzor&#x27;s campaigns were a continuation of a policy from emirate times: the capture of numerous contingents of Christian slaves, the famous &quot;esclavos&quot; or &quot;francos&quot;, in Arabic &quot;Saqtïliba&quot; or &quot;Saqáliba&quot; (plural of &quot;Siqlabi&quot;, &quot;slave&quot;). These were the most lucrative part of the loot, and constituted an excellent method of paying the troops, so much so that many campaigns were little more than slave raids. From these came many eunuchs who were essential elements for handling harems; others were purchased already castrated in Verdun and disembarked in Pechina or Almería according to Liutprand of Cremona. However, the most valuable take was the beautiful girls, selected according to &quot;the predilection they had for the blonde and redhead Galicians, Basques and Franks,&quot; usually also described as having blue eyes, large breasts, wide hips, thick legs and perfect teeth that &quot;the gynaecea of the royal families and the aristocracy supplied as concubines and legitimate wives.&quot; As in the case of the eunuchs, some slaves were bought from pirates attacking the Mediterranean coast, others came from Slavic or Germanic populations passing through several hands from Vikings, and there were also blacks imported from Sudan. Most of these slaves, however, were children who would be Islamized and assigned to work at court, including the work of eunuchs. Jews and, to a lesser extent, Muslims were involved in this lucrative trade, thanks to their ability as interpreters and ambassadors.

During the rule of Almanzor&#x27;s Amirí regime, the already-rich Al-Andalus slave market reached unprecedented proportions. For example, the Moorish chronicles mention that after destroying Barcelona in July 985, Almanzor brought seventy thousand chained Christians to the great market of Córdoba and, after destroying Simancas in July 983, he captured seventeen thousand women and imprisoned ten thousand nobles. Obviously, these figures must be carefully evaluated, but likewise given the enormity this type of trade reached during his tenure, Almanzor is described as &quot;the slave importer&quot;. The commoners of Córdoba even asked his successor to stop the trade since, to get a good husband for their daughters they had to raise the dowries to exorbitant levels because the young Christian slaves were so numerous and cheap that many men preferred to buy them instead of marrying Muslims.

== Death and succession ==

Almanzor died on August 9, 1002 of illness at the age of about sixty-five in Medinaceli. During his last days, the dying chamberlain commended the government of the caliphate to his son, who hurried to Córdoba after his death to take his father&#x27;s position and avoid any fickle opposition from the supporters of the family of the Caliph. The &quot;Historia silense&quot; says:

His body was covered with the linen shroud that his daughters had woven with their own hands from raw material derived from the income of the estate inherited from their ancestors in Torrox, seat of their lineage. His remains were interred in the courtyard of the palace, covered by the dust his servants had shaken from their clothes after each battle against the Christians. According to the Arab historian Ibn Idari, the following verses were carved in marble as an epitaph:

The dynasty Almanzor founded continued with his son Abd al-Malik al-Muzaffar, and then his other son, Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo, who was unable to preserve the inherited power, and was murdered in 1009. The fall of the Amiris set off the Fitna of al-Andalus, a civil war that resulted in the disintegration of the centralized Caliphate into regional taifa kingdoms.

Later, the legend of a defeat immediately prior to his death in a Battle of Calatañazor appeared first in the &quot;Estoria de España&quot; and was later adorned in other documents. Tradition holds that &quot;in Calatañazor Almanzor lost the drum&quot; (&quot;en Calatañazor Almanzor perdió el tambor&quot;) a term indicating that he there lost his joy because of the defeat that was inflicted.

<doc id="512810" wikidata="Q373094" url="?curid=512810" title="James Wilson (Secretary of Agriculture)">
<text>James &quot;Tama Jim&quot; Wilson (August 16, 1835 – August 26, 1920) was an American politician who served as United States secretary of agriculture for sixteen years during three presidencies, from 1897 to 1913. He holds the record as the longest serving United States Cabinet member.

==Personal background and family==

Wilson was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, on August 16, 1835. One of 14 children, he grew up in a farming community near the birthplace of Robert Burns.

His family emigrated to America in 1852, settling in Connecticut before moving to Iowa in 1855, establishing a farm near Traer in Tama County. He attended the public schools and Iowa College (now Grinnell College) in Grinnell, Iowa. He married Esther Wilbur in May 1863. Together they had six children: Esther May, Peter McCosh, Flora Hanna, John Ward, George Wright and Jasper Abijah. Esther died on August 3, 1892; Wilson remained a widower for the remainder of his life.

==Elective office==
Wilson was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives in 1867, and served as speaker from 1870 to 1871 before becoming a professor of agriculture at what is now Iowa State University, where he encouraged the work of George Washington Carver. Wilson was also appointed to the Board of Trustees (now Regents) of Iowa&#x27;s public higher educational institutions, serving from 1870 to 1874.

In 1872, he was elected to represent Iowa&#x27;s 5th congressional district as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives. It was during this time that he became known as &quot;Tama Jim&quot; to distinguish him from the Iowa member of the senate, James F. Wilson. In 1874, Wilson was re-elected, serving a second term, but returned to Iowa in 1877. That year he was appointed to the Iowa State Railway Commission, where he served for six years. 

In 1882, he ran for Congress for the third time, this time against Democrat Benjamin T. Frederick. Wilson seemingly defeated Frederick in a very close race, but Frederick soon contested the election in the U.S. House. Wilson had been issued an election certificate by the State of Iowa, enabling him to be seated during the contest. The 1882 elections gave Frederick&#x27;s Democratic Party control of the House.

Through a prolonged evidentiary proceeding in 1883, followed by filibusters that delayed resolution of the contest until the final hours of the Forty-eighth Congress, Wilson&#x27;s Republican Party colleagues enabled him to retain in office until the final minutes before the end of the final session. Then, Wilson consented to end the filibuster against a vote on the contest, because it was also blocking action on a popular bill to enable former President Ulysses S. Grant to enjoy the financial benefits of a military retirement. On March 4, 1885, with Grover Cleveland&#x27;s inauguration festivities already starting, the House declared Frederick the winner of the 1882 race, unseated Wilson, seated Frederick, passed the Grant retirement bill, then adjourned. Returning to Iowa from Washington for the second time, Wilson rejoined the faculty at Iowa State, where he would serve as Professor (now Dean) of Agriculture and director of the agricultural experiment station from 1890 to 1897.

==Secretary of Agriculture==
Wilson rose to national prominence in early 1897 when newly elected President William McKinley nominated him as his Secretary for Agriculture. During sixteen consecutive years of Republican administrations, Presidents McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft retained him in that position. It was not until March 1913, following the election of a Democratic president (Woodrow Wilson) that Wilson left that office. In all, Wilson served as Secretary of Agriculture from March 6, 1897 to March 5, 1913—the longest duration served by any American cabinet official. The length of Wilson&#x27;s tenure is attributed to not only the same political party occupying the White House in three consecutive administrations, but also the similarity in political philosophy among the three presidents under which Wilson served.

His tenure as Secretary of Agriculture is known as a period of modernization of agricultural methods. He also organized greater food inspection methods, as well as great improvement of many roads across the country.

On the other hand, Wilson spent most of his long tenure attempting to limit the regulatory impact of the pure food movement, which had led to Congress&#x27;s adoption of the Food and Drugs Act of 1906. Frequently siding with incumbent business interests, Wilson consistently worked against issues pursued by his striving chief chemist, Harvey Wiley, who enjoyed a powerful grassroots following. These matters typically concerned the safety of food additives, their testing, and enforcement of the legislation.

==Later life, death and legacy==

After leaving office at age 78, Wilson retired in Iowa. He died in Traer, Iowa on August 26, 1920, ten days after celebrating his 85th birthday. He was interred next to his wife in Buckingham Cemetery, Traer, Iowa.

Wilson Hall, a residence hall at Iowa State University, was named in his honor, as was Washington State University&#x27;s Wilson Hall (renamed Wilson-Short Hall in 2009), originally built as the college&#x27;s agriculture building. His home, The Farm House (Knapp–Wilson House), now on the Iowa State University campus grounds, has been a National Historic Landmark since 1964 and opened as The Farm Museum in 1976. Wilson has also been commemorated in Washington, D.C. by a bridge linking the U.S. Department of Agriculture Administration Building to the U.S. Department of Agriculture South Building across Independence Avenue. In 1943, retired USDA artist Royal Charles Steadman painted a portrait of Wilson and gave the portrait to the department to hang in the Wilson arch between the Administration and South buildings.

<doc id="512811" wikidata="Q192980" url="?curid=512811" title="Lamia (city)">
<text>Lamia (, &quot;Lamía&quot;, ) is a city in central Greece. The city dates back to antiquity, and is today the capital of the regional unit of Phthiotis and of the Central Greece region (comprising five regional units). According to the 2021 census, the Municipality of Lamia has a population of 66,657 while Lamia itself has 47,529 inhabitants. The city is located on the slopes of Mount Othrys, near the river Spercheios. It serves as the agricultural center of a fertile rural and livestock area.

==Name==
One account says that the city was named after the mythological figure of Lamia, the daughter of Poseidon and queen of the Trachineans. Another holds that it is named after the Malians, the inhabitants of the surrounding area. In the Middle Ages, Lamia was called Zetounion (Ζητούνιον), a name first encountered in the 8th Ecumenical Council in 869. It was known as Girton under Frankish rule following the Fourth Crusade and later El Citó when it was controlled by the Catalan Company of mercenaries. In Turkish, it was sometimes called İzdin or İzzeddin. The city was also known as Zeitoun.

==History==

Archaeological excavations have shown the site of Lamia to have been inhabited since at least the Bronze Age (3rd millennium BC).

In antiquity, the city played an important role due to its strategic location, controlling the narrow coastal plain above Thermopylae that connected southern Greece with Thessaly and the rest of the Balkans. The city formed a polis (city-state). The city was therefore fortified in the 5th century BC, and was contested by the Macedonians, Thessalians and Aetolians until the Roman conquest in the early 2nd century BC. After Alexander the Great&#x27;s death in 323 BC, the Athenians and other Greeks rebelled against Macedonian overlordship. Antipatros, the regent of Macedon, took refuge behind the substantial walls of the city (Lamian War, 323–322 BC). The war ended with the death of the Athenian general Leosthenes, and the arrival of a 20,000-strong Macedonian army. Lamia prospered afterwards, especially in the 3rd century BC under Aetolian hegemony, which came to an end when Manius Acilius Glabrio sacked the city in 190 BC.

Little is known of the city&#x27;s history for a number of centuries after that. In Late Antiquity, the city was the seat of a bishop (attested since 431), suffragan of Larissa, but had declined to obscurity: for instance, it is not shown on the 5th-century &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot;. Some archaeological remains from the period have been found in the Castle (the city&#x27;s ancient acropolis), including a basilica, coins and marble inscriptions, while the walls of the Castle are thought to have been rebuilt under Justinian I in the 6th century. The &quot;Synecdemus&quot; of Hierocles includes Lamia among the 16 cities of the province of Thessaly.

The city was occupied by Slavs in the 7th century, and re-appears only in 869/70 under the name of &quot;Zetounion&quot; (Ζητοῦνιον), probably deriving from a Slavic word for &quot;grain&quot;. The city played once more a role in the Byzantine–Bulgarian wars of the late 10th century due to its vicinity to Thermopylae: it was near the town that the Byzantine general Nikephoros Ouranos scored a crushing victory over Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria in the Battle of Spercheios in 997. The city was visited by Emperor Basil II in his triumphal journey to Greece in 1018, and in 1165, the Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela recorded 50 Jewish families in the city and of raids by the neighbouring Vlachs.

Following the Fourth Crusade (1204), the city was captured by the Frankish crusaders. Initially, it was given as a fief to the Knights Templar, who rebuilt its fortress. In 1209–10 the Templars were evicted due to their support to the rebellion of the Lombard barons of the Kingdom of Thessalonica. The Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders confiscated the city (and neighbouring Ravennika) and made it an imperial domain under a &quot;bailli&quot;, possibly Rainerio of Travale. Under Frankish rule, it was the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop (&quot;Dioecesis Sidoniensis&quot; or &quot;Cythoniensis&quot;), probably a suffragan of the Latin Archbishop of Neopatras. In , or shortly after 1223, the two towns were captured by the Epirote Greeks. Lamia remained in Greek hands until it was surrendered again to the Franks of the Duchy of Athens in 1275 as part of the dowry of Helena Angelina Komnene, daughter of John I Doukas, ruler of Thessaly. It thereby again became a Catholic see.

The Catalans held the city from 1318 until 1391, when it passed to the Acciaioli Dukes of Athens. The fortress was razed by the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I in 1394. After the disastrous Battle of Ankara in 1402, the weakened Ottomans were forced to return some territories, including the region of Zetounion, to Byzantine rule. The Turks besieged the city for two years sometime before 1415, but the Byzantines resisted successfully. Sometime between 1424 and July 1426, however, the city had been once more conquered by the Turks. Apart from an attack by the troops of the Despotate of the Morea in 1444, which plundered the city, from then on the town remained under firm Ottoman control until it became part of the newly independent Kingdom of Greece in 1832. Until the annexation of Thessaly in 1881, it was a border city (the borders were drawn at a site known as &quot;Taratsa&quot; just north of Lamia).

==Climate==
Lamia has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) with humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) influences due to the lack of a distinct dry season. It has 4 distinct seasons: winter, spring, summer and autumn. The cold and wet period lasts from late October to mid April and the warm, moderately dry period from mid April to late October, with transitional phases in between. The record lowest temperature ever in Lamia is , recorded in December 2001 and the record highest is  °C, recorded during the summer of 1973.

<text>Lamia (; ), in ancient Greek mythology, was a child-eating monster and, in later tradition, was regarded as a type of night-haunting spirit or &quot;daimon&quot;.

In the earliest stories, Lamia was a beautiful queen of ancient Libya who had an affair with Zeus. Upon learning this, Zeus&#x27;s wife Hera robbed Lamia of her children, the offspring of her affair with Zeus, either by kidnapping or by killing them. The loss of her children drove Lamia insane, and in vengeance and despair, Lamia snatched up any children she could find and devoured them. Because of her cruel acts, her physical appearance changed to become ugly and monstrous. Zeus gave Lamia the power of prophecy and the ability to take out and reinsert her eyes, possibly because she was cursed by Hera with insomnia or because she could no longer close her eyes, so that she was forced to always obsess over her lost children.

The lamiai () also became a type of phantom, synonymous with the empusai who seduced young men to satisfy their sexual appetite and fed on their flesh afterward. An account of Apollonius of Tyana&#x27;s defeat of a lamia-seductress inspired the poem &quot;Lamia&quot; by John Keats.

Lamia has been ascribed serpentine qualities, which some commentators believe can be firmly traced to mythology from antiquity; they have found analogues in ancient texts that could be designated as &quot;lamiai&quot;, which are part-snake beings. These include the half-woman, half-snake beasts of the &quot;Libyan myth&quot; told by Dio Chrysostom, and the monster sent to Argos by Apollo to avenge Psamathe, daughter of King Crotopos.

In previous centuries, Lamia was used in Greece as a bogeyman to frighten children into obedience, similar to the way parents in Spain, Portugal and Latin America used the Coco.

==Etymology==
A scholiast to Aristophanes claimed that Lamia&#x27;s name derived from her having a large throat or gullet (; &quot;laimós&quot;). Modern scholarship reconstructs a Proto-Indo-European stem *&quot;&quot;, &quot;nocturnal spirit&quot;, whence also comes &quot;lemures&quot;.

==Classical mythology==
In the myth, the Lamia was originally a beautiful woman beloved of Zeus, but Zeus&#x27;s jealous wife Hera robbed her of her children, either by kidnapping and hiding them away, killing them, or causing Lamia herself to kill her own offspring. She became disfigured from the torment, transforming into a terrifying being who hunted and killed the children of others.

Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; (vii.5) refers to the lore of some beastly lifeform in the shape of a woman, which tears the bellies of pregnant mothers and devours their fetuses. An anonymous commentator on the passage states this is a reference to the Lamia, but muddlingly combines this with Aristotle&#x27;s subsequent comments and describes her as a Scythian of the Pontus (Black Sea) area.

According to one myth, Hera deprived Lamia of the ability to sleep, making her constantly grieve over the loss of her children, and Zeus provided relief by endowing her with removable eyes. He also gifted her with a shapeshifting ability in the process.

===De-mythologized===
Diodorus Siculus () gave a de-mythologized account of Lamia as a queen of Libya who ordered her soldiers to snatch children from their mothers and kill them, and whose beauty gave way to bestial appearance due to her savageness. The queen, as related by Diodorus, was born in a cave. Heraclitus Paradoxographus (2nd century) also gave a rationalizing account.

Diodorus&#x27;s rationalization was that the Libyan queen in her drunken state was as if she could not see, allowing her citizens free rein for any conduct without supervision, giving rise to the folk myth that she places her eyes in a vessel. Heraclitus&#x27;s euhemerized account explains that Hera, consort of Zeus, gouged the eyes out of the beautiful Lamia.

===Genealogy===
Lamia was the daughter born between King Belus of Egypt and Lybie, according to one source.

According to the same source, Lamia was taken by Zeus to Italy, and that Lamos, the city of the man-eating Laestrygonians, was named after her. A different authority remarks that Lamia was once queen of the Laestrygonians.

===Aristophanes===
Aristophanes wrote in two plays an identically worded list of foul-smelling objects which included the &quot;Lamia&#x27;s testicles&quot;, thus making Lamia&#x27;s gender ambiguous. This was later incorporated into Edward Topsell&#x27;s 17th-century envisioning of the lamia.

It is somewhat uncertain if this refers to the one Lamia or to &quot;a Lamia&quot; among many, as given in some translations of the two plays; a generic is also supported by the definition as some sort of a &quot;wild beast&quot; in the &quot;Suda&quot;.

==Hellenistic folklore==
===As children&#x27;s bogey===
The &quot;Lamia&quot; was a bogeyman or bugbear term, invoked by a mother or a nanny to frighten children into good behavior. Such practices are recorded by the 1st century Diodorus, and other sources in antiquity.

Numerous sources attest to the Lamia being a &quot;child-devourer&quot;, one of them being Horace. Horace in &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; cautions against the overly fantastical: &quot;[nor should a story] draw a live boy out of a Lamia&#x27;s belly&quot;. Lamia was in some versions thus seen as swallowing children alive, and there may have existed some nurse&#x27;s tale that told of a boy extracted alive out of a Lamia.

The Byzantine lexicon &quot;Suda&quot; (10th century) gave an entry for &quot;lamía&quot;, with definitions and sources much as already described. The lexicon also has an entry under &quot;mormo&quot; (), stating that Mormo and the equivalent &quot;mormolykeion&quot; are called lamía, and that all these refer to frightful beings.

&quot;Lamia&quot; has as synonyms &quot;Mormo&quot; and &quot;Gello&quot; according to the scholia to Theocritus.

Other bogeys have been listed in conjunction with &quot;Lamia&quot;, for instance, the Gorgo (), the eyeless giant Ephialtes, a Mormolyce ( named by Strabo.

===As a seductress===
In later classical periods, around the 1st century A. D., the conception of this Lamia shifted to that of a sultry seductress who enticed young men and devoured them.

====Apollonius of Tyana====
A representative example is Philostratus&#x27;s novelistic biography &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;.

It purports to give a full account of the capture of &quot;Lamia of Corinth&quot; by Apollonius, as the general populace referred to the legend. An apparition (&quot;phasma&quot; ) which in the assumed guise of a woman seduced one of Apollonius&#x27;s young pupils.

Here, Lamia is the common vulgar term and &quot;empousa&quot; the proper term. For Apollonius in speech declares that the seductress is &quot;one of the &quot;empousai&quot;, which most other people would call &quot;lamiai&quot; and &quot;mormolykeia&quot;&quot;. The use of the term &quot;lamia&quot; in this sense is however considered atypical by one commentator.

Regarding the seductress, Apollonius further warned, &quot;you are warming a snake (&quot;ophis&quot;) on your bosom, and it is a snake that warms you&quot;. It has been suggested from this discourse that the creature was therefore &quot;literally a snake&quot;. The &quot;empousa&quot; admits in the end to fattening up her victim (Menippus of Lycia) to be consumed, as she was in the habit of targeting young men for food &quot;because their blood was fresh and pure&quot;. The last statement has led to the surmise that this lamia/empusa was a sort of blood-sucking vampiress.

Another aspect of her powers is that this empusa/lamia is able to create an illusion of a sumptuous mansion, with all the accoutrements and even servants. But once Apollonius reveals her false identity at the wedding, the illusion fails her and vanishes.

====Lamia the courtesan====
A longstanding joke makes a word play between Lamia the monster and Lamia of Athens, the notorious &quot;hetaira&quot; courtesan who captivated Demetrius Poliorcetes (d. 283 BC). The double-entendre sarcasm was uttered by Demetrius&#x27;s father, among others. The same joke was used in theatrical Greek comedy, and generally. The word play is also seen as being employed in Horace&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot;, to banter Lucius Aelius Lamia the praetor.

====Golden Ass====
In Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; appear two Thessalian 
&quot;witches&quot;, Meroe and her sister Panthia, who are called &quot;lamiae&quot; in one instance.

Meroe has seduced a man named Socrates, but when he plots to escape, the two witches raid his bed, thrust a knife in the neck to tap the blood into a skin bag, eviscerate his heart, and stuff the hole back with sponge.

Some commentators, despite the absence of actual blood-sucking, find these witches to share &quot;vampiric&quot; qualities of the &quot;lamiae&quot; (&quot;lamiai&quot;) in Philostratus&#x27;s narrative, thus offering it up for comparison.

==Kindreds==
Lamia&#x27;s possible kindred kind appear in Classical works, but may be known by other names except for isolated instance which calls it a &quot;lamia&quot;. Or they may be simply unnamed or differently named. And those analogues that exhibit a serpentine form or nature have been especially noted.

===Poine of Argos===
One such possible lamia is the avenging monster sent by Apollo against the city of Argos and killed by Coroebus. It is referred to as Poine or Ker in classical sources, but later in the Medieval period, one source does call it a lamia (First Vatican Mythographer, century).

The story surrounds the tragedy of the daughter of King Crotopus of Argos named Psamathe, whose child by Apollo dies and she is executed for suspected promiscuity. Apollo as punishment then sends the child-devouring monster to Argos.

In Statius&#x27; version, the monster had a woman&#x27;s face and breasts, and a hissing snake protruding from the cleft of her rusty-colored forehead, and it would slide into children&#x27;s bedrooms to snatch them. According to a scholiast to Ovid, it had a serpent&#x27;s body carrying a human face.

In Pausanias&#x27;s version, the monster is called &quot;Poinē&quot; (), meaning &quot;punishment&quot; or &quot;vengeance&quot;, but there is nothing about a snake on her forehead.

One evidence this may be a double of the Lamia comes from Plutarch, who equates the word &quot;empousa&quot; with &quot;poinē&quot;.

===Libyan myth===
A second example is a colony of man-eating monsters in Libya, described by Dio Chrysostom. These monsters had a woman&#x27;s torso and beastly hands, and &quot;all the lower part was snake, ending in the snake&#x27;s baleful head&quot;. The idea that these creatures were &quot;lamiai&quot; seems to originate with Alex Scobie (1977), and to be accepted by other commentators.

==Middle Ages==
By the Early Middle Ages, &quot;lamia&quot; (pl. &quot;lamiai&quot; or &quot;lamiae&quot;) was being glossed as a general term referring to a class of beings. Hesychius of Alexandria&#x27;s lexicon () glossed &quot;lamiai&quot; as apparations, or even fish. Isidore of Seville defined them as beings that snatched babies and ripped them apart.

The Vulgate used &quot;lamia&quot; in Isaiah 34:14 to translate &quot;Lilith&quot; of the Hebrew Bible. Pope Gregory I (d. 604)&#x27;s exegesis on the Book of Job explains that the lamia represented either heresy or hypocrisy.

Christian writers also warned against the seductive potential of &quot;lamiae&quot;. In his 9th-century treatise on divorce, Hincmar, archbishop of Reims, listed &quot;lamiae&quot; among the supernatural dangers that threatened marriages, and identified them with &quot;geniciales feminae&quot;, female reproductive spirits.

==Interpretations==

This Lamia of Libya has her double in Lamia-Sybaris of the legend around Delphi, both indirectly associated with serpents. Strong parallel with the Medusa has also been noted. These, and other considerations have prompted modern commentators to suggest she is a dragoness.

Another double of the Libyan Lamia may be Lamia, daughter of Poseidon. Lamia by Zeus gave birth to a Sibyl according to Pausanias, and this would have to be the Libyan Lamia, yet there is a tradition that Lamia the daughter of Poseidon was the mother of a Sibyl. Either one could be Lamia the mother of Scylla mentioned in the Stesichorus (d. 555 BC) fragment, and other sources. Scylla is a creature depicted variously as anguipedal or serpent-bodied.

===Identification as a serpent-woman===
Diodorus Siculus (), for instance, describes Lamia of Libya as having nothing more than a beastly appearance. Diodorus, Duris of Samos and other sources which comprise the sources for building an &quot;archetypal&quot; picture of Lamia do not designate her as a dragoness, or give her explicit serpentine descriptions.

In the 1st-century &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot; the female &quot;empousa-lamia&quot; is also called &quot;a snake&quot;, which may seem to the modern reader to be just a metaphorical expression, but which Daniel Ogden insists is a literal snake. Philostratus&#x27;s tale was reworked by Keats in his poem &quot;Lamia&quot;, where it is made clear she bears the guise of a snake, which she wants to relinquish in return for human appearance.

Modern commentators have also tried to establish that she may have originally been a dragoness, by inference. Daniel Ogden argues that one of her possible reincarnations, the monster of Argos killed by Coroebus had a &quot;scaly gait&quot;, indicating she must have had an anguipedal form in an early version of the story, although the Latin text in Statius merely reads &quot;inlabi&quot; (declension of &quot;&quot;) meaning &quot;slides&quot;.

One of the doubles of Lamia of Libya is the Lamia-Sybaris, which is described only as a giant beast by Antoninus Liberalis (2nd century). It is noted that this character terrorized Delphi, just as the dragon Python had.

Close comparison is also made with the serpentine Medusa. Not only is Medusa identified with Libya, she also had dealings with the three Graeae who had the removable eye shared between them. In some versions, the removable eye belonged to the three Gorgons, Medusa and her sisters.

===Hecate===
Some commentators have also equated Lamia with Hecate. The basis of this identification is the variant maternities of Scylla, sometimes ascribed to Lamia (as already mentioned), and sometimes to Hecate. The identification has also been built (using transitive logic) since each name is identified with empousa in different sources.

===Stench of a lamia===
A foul odor has been pointed out as a possible common motif or attribute of the lamiai. The examples are Aristophanes&#x27;s reference to the &quot;lamia&#x27;s testicles&quot;, the scent of the monsters in the Libyan myth which allowed the humans to track down their lair, and the terrible stench of their urine that lingered in the clothing of Aristomenes, which they showered upon him after carving out his friend Sophocles&#x27;s heart.

===Mesopotamian connection===
Lamia may originate from the Mesopotamian demoness Lamashtu.

==Modern age==
Renaissance writer Angelo Poliziano wrote &quot;Lamia&quot; (1492), a philosophical work whose title is a disparaging reference to his opponents who dabble in philosophy without competence. It alludes to Plutarch&#x27;s use of the term in &quot;De curiositate&quot;, where the Greek writer suggests that the term &quot;Lamia&quot; is emblematic of meddlesome busybodies in society. Worded another way, Lamia was emblematic of the hypocrisy of such scholars.

From around the mid-15th century into the 16th century, the lamia came to be regarded exclusively as witches.

===Bestiary===
In Edward Topsell&#x27;s &quot;History of Four-footed Beasts&quot; (1607), the lamia is described as having the upper body (i.e., the face and breasts) of a woman, but with goatlike hind quarters with large and filthy &quot;stones&quot; (testicles) that smell like sea-calves, on authority of Aristophanes. It is covered with scales all over.

===Adaptations===
John Keats&#x27;s &quot;Lamia&quot; in his &quot;Lamia and Other Poems&quot; is a reworking of the tale in Apollonius&#x27;s biography by Philostratus, described above. In Keats&#x27;s version, the student Lycius replaces Menippus the Lycian. For the descriptions and nature of the Lamia, Keats drew from Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;. August Enna wrote an opera called &quot;Lamia&quot;.

English composer Dorothy Howell composed a tone poem &quot;Lamia&quot; which was played repeatedly to great acclaim under its dedicatee Sir Henry Wood at the London Promenade concerts in the 1920s. It has been recorded more recently by Rumon Gamba conducting the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra for Chandos Records in a 2019 release of British tone poems.

The 1982 novel &quot;Lamia&quot; by Tristan Travis sees the mythological monster relocated to 1970s Chicago, where she takes bloody vengeance on sex offenders while the cops try to figure out the mystery.

Lamia, also known as Ramia, also appears as a boss in the Nintendo DS action role-playing game &quot;Deep Labyrinth&quot;.

Lamia is the main antagonist in the 2009 horror movie &quot;Drag Me to Hell&quot; voiced by Art Kimbro. In the film, Lamia is described as &quot;the most feared of all Demons&quot; and having the head and hooves of a goat. A gypsy curse associated with him has Lamia torment the victim for three days before having its minions drag them into Hell to burn in its fires for all eternity.

Lamia appears as an antagonist in Rick Riordan&#x27;s &quot;The Demigod Diaries&quot;, appearing in its fourth short story &quot;The Son of Magic&quot;. She is depicted as the daughter of Hecate and as having glowing green eyes with serpentine slits, shriveled-up hands with lizard-like claws on them, and crocodile-like teeth.

In the anime &quot;Monster Musume&quot;, the character Miia is a lamia.

In Gerald Brom&#x27;s &quot;Lost Gods&quot;, Lamia serves as the primary antagonist, depicted as an ancient succubus who prolongs her life by drinking the blood of her children and grandchildren.

Lamias are featured in the progressive rock album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; by Genesis on the track &quot;The Lamia&quot;. They are depicted as female creatures with &quot;snake-like&quot; bodies and seduce the protagonist Rael in an attempt to devour him, but as soon as they &quot;taste&quot; Rael&#x27;s body, the blood that enters the lamias&#x27; bodies causes their death.

Lamia is mentioned several times in the Iron Maiden song &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; from their 1981 album &quot;Killers&quot;. The band often refer to mythology and mythical beasts in their compositions.

The American TV series &quot;Raised by Wolves&quot; features a character named Lamia, an android mother, who has removable eyes and the ability to shapeshift.

The 2024 British fantasy TV series &quot;Domino Day&quot;, set in modern-day Manchester, features Siena Kelly as the titular lead character, a witch who feeds on the energy of her dating-app hook-ups. She eventually realizes that she is actually a lamia.

===Modern folk traditions===
In modern Greek folk tradition, the Lamia has survived and retained many of her traditional attributes. John Cuthbert Lawson remarks &quot;the chief characteristics of the Lamiae, apart from their thirst for blood, are their uncleanliness, their gluttony, and their stupidity&quot;. The contemporary Greek proverb, &quot;της Λάμιας τα σαρώματα&quot; (&quot;the Lamia&#x27;s sweeping&quot;), epitomises slovenliness; and the common expression, &quot;τό παιδί τό &#x27;πνιξε η Λάμια&quot; (&quot;the child has been strangled by the Lamia&quot;), explains the sudden death of young children.

Later traditions referred to many &quot;lamiae&quot;; these were folkloric monsters similar to vampires and succubi that seduced young men and then fed on their blood.

===Fine arts===
In a 1909 painting by Herbert James Draper, the Lamia who moodily watches the serpent on her forearm appears to represent a &quot;hetaera&quot;. Although the lower body of Draper&#x27;s Lamia is human, he alludes to her serpentine history by draping a shed snakeskin about her waist. In Renaissance emblems, Lamia has the body of a serpent and the breasts and head of a woman, like the image of hypocrisy.

<text>Kalush (, ) is a city set in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (province) of western Ukraine. It is the administrative centre of Kalush Raion (district) and hosts the administration of Kalush urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Its estimated population was Some of its important local industries include chemicals and concrete.

==Geography==
Kalush is in the western portion of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, in the region of Western Ukraine at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. It stands on the Dniester tributary, the Limnytsia River that begins from the slopes of the Carpathians. The city is at the eastern border of the ethnographical region of Boyko Land.

==History==

The earliest known mention of Kalush is the accounting of a village of that name in a chronicle dated May 27, 1437. At that time, together with all Red Ruthenia, the village belonged to the Kingdom of Poland and was known under its Polish name, Kałusz. Until the mid-16th century, Kałusz was part of Halicz Land, Ruthenian Voivodeship. It was known for producing malt, its brewery, and salt mining. In 1469, King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk founded a Roman Catholic parish church there.

In 1549 Kalush was incorporated as a city by Crown Hetman Mikołaj Sieniawski on the authority of the Polish Crown (Magdeburg rights). Already then Kalush became also known as a city of chemical industry specializing in producing nitrate. The contemporary city coat of arms is derived from the Leliwa coat of arms of the Sieniawski family and is dedicated to the victory in the Battle of Vienna, while the upper portion of the shield contains three white salt furnaces. In 1595 Kalush, which had 55 houses, was ransacked by Crimean Tatars. Here, two important battles took place. In 1672, forces of Hetman Jan Sobieski clashed with Tatars of Selim I Giray, and three years later, Andrzej Potocki fought here with Turks. In 1772, following the Partitions of Poland, the town was seized by the Habsburg Empire, where it remained until 1918.
In 1912–13 prior to World War I near the city of Kalush an oil rig was built. However, instead of oil, the rig ended up extracting a natural gas. For a long time the gas was not utilized, but later was used for heating a potassium quarry and boilers in Boryslav and Drohobych.

In the Second Polish Republic, Kalush/Kalusz was the seat of a county in Stanislawow Voivodeship. Its population was 15,000, almost equal proportions of Poles, Ukrainians and Jews. Following the 1939 Invasion of Poland, the town was annexed by the Soviet Union. Occupied by the Third Reich from 2 July 1941 until 30 July 1944, it returned to the Soviet Union in 1944. During World War II the residents of the city witnessed many ethnocides. In 1940, the Soviets forced inhabitants of Kalush to leave the town and forcefully moved them to Siberia, many of whom were people of various nationalities: Poles, Ukrainians, and others. Then, in late 1941 and 1942, the majority of Kalush&#x27;s Jewish inhabitants were murdered by the Germans. Since the 16th century, a Jewish community had flourished in the city and at times constituted a majority of its population; however, in 1941, while under Nazi control, that community was virtually eliminated. Polish Home Army (AK) was active in the town and its area. The town itself was captured by the AK in mid-July 1944, during the Operation Tempest. In 1945, Polish residents of Kalush were expelled to the Recovered Territories.

On March 20, 1972, the city of Kalush became a city of regional importance.

Recently several renovations have taken place of several local temples such as the Temple of All Saints of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Kyiv Patriarchate), the Catholic Saint Valentine Church, and the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church of Saint Nicholas. Kalush residents presented a bust of Taras Shevchenko to Simferopol and erected the first monument to Kobzar on Crimean soil on August 21, 1997. A monument to Shevchenko was also presented to the city of Novohrodivka, Donetsk region, in honor of the 10th anniversary of Ukraine&#x27;s independence.

Until 18 July 2020, Kalush was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and served as the administrative center of Kalush Raion though it did not belong to the raion. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast to six, the city of Kalush was merged into Kalush Raion.

==Population==

===Language===
Distribution of the population by native language according to the 2001 census:
==Kalush city council in 2010==
Note: Percentage indicates correlation to the total number of seats in the city council which is 50. The results of the election were taken from kalush.net where they were published on 4 November 2010. Election was half and half, one (25 seats) by the &quot;majority rule&quot;, another (25 seats) – by &quot;party-list&quot;. There were 15 non-affiliated members, all of whom associated themselves with the Ukrainian Party (2006).
==Points of interest==

The city still contains an old rathaus which was declared as the National Landmark of Architecture #591. The previous Rathaus was destroyed during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. The new Rathaus served as a town hall and a directory of agriculture since the 20th century. The conditions of the landmark in 2010 were terrible and the Rathaus required some major renovations. A fire broke out ruins of the Rathaus in 2013.

In the city, there is a mount Vysochanka named after a colonel of the Lysyanka Regiment during the Cossack Hetmanate and a leader of the local uprising in 1648 Semen Vysochan.

<doc id="512826" wikidata="Q337489" url="?curid=512826" title="Ali al-Sistani">
<text>ʿAlī Ḥusaynī Sīstānī (; ; born 4 August 1930) is an Iranian-born Islamic scholar and the dean of the Hawza of Najaf in Iraq. A Grand Ayatollah and , Sistani is considered one of the leading religious leaders of Twelver Shia Muslims. Sistani has been a vocal critic of foreign interference in Iraqi affairs and has warned foreign actors against imposing their will on the Iraqi people.

Born in Mashhad, Iran (with the father as Dulan) to a Sayyid family, Sistani studied in Qom under Hossein Borujerdi and later in Najaf under Abu al-Qasim Khu&#x27;i. An Usuli, Sistani rose to the rank of &quot;mujtahid&quot; in 1960 and succeeded Abd al-A&#x27;la Sabziwari as Grand Ayatollah. Sistani was included in top positions of &quot;The Muslim 500: The World&#x27;s Most Influential Muslims&quot; from 2004 to 2024 and named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2004 and 2005.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sistani was born in 1930 in Mashhad, to a family of religious clerics who claim descent from Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad. His father was Mohammad-Baqir Sistani and his mother was the daughter of Ridha al-Mehrebani al-Sarabi.

Sistani began his religious education as a child, first in Mashhad in his father&#x27;s , and continuing later in Qom. In Qom he studied under Grand Ayatollah Hossein Borujerdi. Later in 1951, Sistani traveled to Iraq to study in Najaf under Grand Ayatollah Abu al-Qasim Khoei. Sistani rose to the rank of mujtahid in 1960 at thirty-one.

===Grand Ayatollah===
When Ayatollah Khoei died in 1992, Abd al-A&#x27;la Sabziwari briefly became the leading marja&#x27;. However, when he died in 1993, Sistani ascended to the rank of Grand Ayatollah through formal peer recognition of his scholarship. His role as successor to Khoei was symbolically cemented when he led funeral prayers for Khoei, and he also inherited most of Khoei&#x27;s network and following.

===Baath Party===
During the years of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule of Iraq through the Arab nationalist and Sunni dominated Baath Party, Sistani was untouched during the violent Baathist repression and persecution that killed many clerics including Muhammad al-Sadr in 1999, for which Saddam denied any involvement. Sistani&#x27;s mosque was forcefully shut down in 1994 and did not reopen until the 2003 American-led invasion of Iraq.

===Role in contemporary Iraq===
Since the overthrow of the Baath Party of Iraq in 2003, Sistani has played an increasingly prominent role in regional religious and political affairs and he has been called the &quot;most influential&quot; figure in post-invasion Iraq.

Shortly after the American invasion began, Sistani issued a fatwa advising Shia clergy to become engaged in politics to better guide the Iraqi people toward &quot;clearer decisions&quot; and to fight &quot;media propaganda.&quot; As the summer of 2003 approached, Sistani and his followers began petitioning the occupying forces for a constitutional convention. Later, Sistani called for a democratic vote of the people to form a transitional government. Observers described the move as being a path leading directly to Shia political dominance over Iraq&#x27;s government, as Shia Muslims make up approximately 65% of the total Iraqi population. Subsequently, Sistani criticized plans for an Iraqi government for not being democratic enough.

In early August 2004, Sistani experienced serious health complications related to a previously diagnosed heart condition. He traveled to London to receive medical treatment. It was, reportedly, the first time that Sistani had left Iraq in decades, and may have been due, in part, to growing concerns for his safety from sectarian violence. Though still recovering, Sistani returned later in the month to broker a military truce at the Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf where Muqtada al-Sadr and the Mahdi Army had been cornered by American and Iraqi forces. Sadr, who rose rapidly to prominence through a series of independent military actions beginning in 2004, has since actively challenged Sistani&#x27;s more progressive influence over Shia in the region.

Sistani&#x27;s edicts reportedly provided many Iraqi Shia cause for participating in the January 2005 elections—he urged, in a statement on 1 October 2004, that Iraqis recognize the election as an &quot;important matter,&quot; additionally, Sistani asked that the elections be &quot;free and fair ... with the participation of all Iraqis.&quot; Soon after, Sistani issued a fatwa alerting Shia women that they were religiously obligated to participate in the election, even if their husbands had forbidden them from voting. In an issued statement Sistani remarked that &quot;truly, women who go forth to the polling centers on election day are like Zaynab, who went forth to Karbala.&quot;

He has consistently urged the Iraqi Shia not to respond in kind to attacks from Sunni Salafists, which have become common in Sunni-dominated regions of Iraq like the area known as the &quot;Triangle of Death,&quot; south of Baghdad. Even after the destruction of the Shia Al-Askari Mosque in Samarra in February 2006, his network of clerics and preachers continued to urge calm and told their followers that &quot;it was not their Sunni neighbors who were killing them but foreign Wahhabis.&quot; Sistani&#x27;s call for unity after the bombing of the mosque helped to control a potentially dangerous situation, preventing the country from entering in a bloody sectarian war. Sistani did the same when the same mosque was bombed again in 2007.

An alleged plot to assassinate Sistani was foiled on 29 January 2007, when three Jund al-Samaa gunmen were captured at a hotel near his office. It is believed to have been part of a larger attack against several targets in Najaf.

In an online open poll 2005, Ali Sistani was selected as the 30th topmost intellectual person in the world on the list of Top 100 Public Intellectuals by &quot;Prospect&quot; (UK) and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; (US).

On 13 June 2014, Sistani appealed that Iraqis should support the government against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant militant group, which had taken over Mosul and Tikrit and was threatening Baghdad. Later in June 2014, Sistani revised his statement and issued a fatwa calling for &quot;citizens to defend the country, its people, the honor of its citizens, and its sacred places,&quot; against the ISIL.

Sistani said the Iraqi government and police were liable for killing protestors during the 2019–2021 Iraqi protests. He requested that the government prosecute those who gave the command to shoot protesters. The ayatollah rarely voices his opinion on politics except in extreme unrest. The protests have been described as Iraq&#x27;s worst violence since ISIL was militarily defeated in 2017. A month later in November 2019, in response to the death of three Iraqi protesters, Sistani said &quot;No person or group, no side with a particular view, no regional or international actor may seize the will of the Iraqi people and impose its will on them.&quot;

===Shia patronage===
As the leading cleric in Najaf, Sistani oversees sums amounting to millions of US dollars. His followers offer him a fixed part of their earnings (khums), which is used for educational and charitable purposes. Sistani&#x27;s office has reported that it supports 35,000 students in Qom, 10,000 in Mashhad, and 4,000 in Isfahan. It also oversees a network of representatives (wakil) &quot;who promote his views in large and small ways in neighborhoods, mosques, bazaars, and seminaries from Kirkuk to Basra&quot;.

In Iran, due to the post-invasion opening of the Iraqi cities of Najaf and Karbala to Iranians, many Iranians are said to return from pilgrimage in Iraq as supporters of Sistani.

Sistani sent nearly 1,000 aid packages, mostly food, but also other basic needs, to Balkhab, Afghanistan during the Balkhab uprising in 2022 to help out the displaced Hazaras.

A spokesperson for the al-Abbas Shrine confirmed that Sistani was overseeing the relief campaign conducted by the shrine for displaced Lebanese families amid the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in October 2024. The relief campaign has delivered at least 1,200 tons of aid as of 8 October 2024.

==Religious and political views==

According to scholar Vali Nasr, Sistani, like his mentor Khoei, sees Islamic scholars &quot;mainly as teachers and defenders of the faith&quot;. In government he saw the &quot;role of Islam as providing values and guidelines for social order&quot;.

He &quot;was not shy&quot; in confronting US occupation authorities about issues such as who had the authority to write Iraq&#x27;s new constitution and kept them at arm&#x27;s length, but also avoided &quot;Khomeini-style denunciations&quot; of the United States as the &#x27;Great Satan&#x27;. His supporters&#x27; demonstrations were &quot;impressively large but peaceful&quot;. He opposes both secularism and Shi&#x27;i sectarianism.

For Iraq, he &quot;put forth a simple model of government&quot; based &quot;on the principle of majority rule… accountable and representative government that would reflect and protect Shia identity&quot;.

At the same time he is conservative in matters of religious law, &quot;unaffected&quot; by the ideas of &quot;modernism&quot;.

Though his differences with Iraq&#x27;s larger and more powerful neighbor the Islamic Republic of Iran and their theory of Velayat-e-faqih are &quot;profound&quot; according to Nasr, Sistani has avoided &quot;entanglements&quot; with them and with the rivalries of Iranian politics, politics and clerics in Lebanon, and &quot;never tried to promote a rivalry&quot; between his religious center of Najaf and the Iranian center in Qom, a reflection, Nasr believes, of Sistani&#x27;s reluctance to become involved in politics. 

Sistani met with Pope Francis on 6 March 2021 during the latter&#x27;s visit to Iraq. They met for about 40 minutes in Sistani&#x27;s home in Najaf. 

In October 2023, during the Israel–Hamas war, Sistani issued a statement in which he &#x27;condemned Israel and called on the world to stand up to the “terrible brutality” in besieged Gaza.&#x27; On 23 September 2024, Sistani&#x27;s office issued a statement condemning the &#x27;brutal Zionist aggression&#x27; in Lebanon amidst an intensified Israeli airstrike campaign in the country, urging the international community to uphold the protection of civilians and restore peace in the region. On 28 September 2024, Sistani mourned the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and condemned his assassination in an Israeli airstrike the previous day.

=== Criticism of Sufism ===
Ayatollah Sistani does not support the mystic worldview inspired by Ibn Arabi. He has warned young students of the seminary against the increasing influence of Islamic mysticism.

=== Views on homosexuality ===
In 2005, Sistani issued a Fatwa, calling for homosexuals to be killed in &quot;the most severe way&quot;. Sistani then retracted the call in 2011. 

===Guardianship of Islamic Jurists (Wilayat al-Faqih)===
Perhaps because of his great influence, what exactly the position of Sistani is on Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s theory of rule of the Islamic jurist is disputed.

A number of sources include him as opposing the concept. Al-Monitor news service lists him as one of the &quot;four leading Marja&#x27; of Najaf (Bashir al-Najafi, Muhammad al-Fayadh, Muhammad Saeed al-Hakim being the others) who oppose Ruhollah Khomeini&#x27;s concept&quot; of rule by Islamic jurisprudence. Researcher Hayder Khoei writes that pro-Islamic Republic of Iran propagandists have gone to the trouble of publishing books with fabricated quotes by Sistani in favor of rule by jurists as one of their &quot;propaganda campaigns&quot; in Najaf, to obscure the fact that &quot;Sistani, like the vast majority of Shia clerics based in the city of Najaf, is well-known for his opposition to Wilayat al-Faqih&quot;.

Journalist Ali Muhammad quotes political analyst Abdul Wahhab al-Hussaini concerning Khomeini&#x27;s follower and successor Ali Khamenei: 
Vali Nasr calls his differences with ruling clerics in Iran &quot;profound&quot;, and his model of government based on majority rule. Ali Mamouri Medi Khalaji talks of him &quot;explicitly&quot; referring to &quot;&quot;velayat-e insan&quot; (state guardianship by the people), as opposed to &quot;velayat-e faqih&quot; (guardianship of the jurist)&quot;.

But according to the pro-Khomeini organization Ahl-ul-bayt Islamic Mission, there has been a &quot;West-based campaign&quot; to manipulate &quot;Shi’i public opinion&quot; concerning the &quot;character of Sayed ‘Ali Sistāni and jurists of the Najaf seminary&quot; and to claim the &quot;existence of a quietist and apolitical tradition of Shi’ism among the jurists&quot;.

An archived question and answer from his website has this to say on the subject:
On the specific question of obedience to a supreme leader, according to &quot;Ayatollah Watch&quot;, Sistani has said that any pronouncement given by a supreme leader &quot;supersedes all (including those given by other Maraji&#x27;) unless the pronouncements are proven to be wrong or the pronouncements are proven to be against what is in the Qur&#x27;an or in Religious Tradition&quot;.

Yet another interpretation of his statements comes from Sadegh Zibakalam, who states that Sistani has consistently avoided supporting a strict interpretation of the theory of velayat-e faqih, especially of absolute guardianship, and has not explicitly offered any substantive affirmation of the theory as a whole (including limited guardianship); thereby creating &quot;a major lacuna&quot; in the &quot;grand ideological scenario&quot; of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

==Criticism and controversy==
===Al Jazeera===
In May 2007, hundreds of Shias demonstrated publicly in Basra and Najaf to protest comments made by television presenter and journalist Ahmed Mansour during a Qatari broadcast of Al Jazeera television programming. While presenting, &quot;Bela Hodod&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Without Borders&quot;), Mansour voiced skepticism of Sistani&#x27;s leadership credentials while directing questions about the Iraqi-born cleric, to his guest, Shia cleric Jawad al-Khalsi. Mansour also suggested that Sistani was unaware of contemporary problems in Iraq and of prevailing post-war conditions, and he alleged that Sistani&#x27;s edicts were largely, written and disseminated by aides. At another point, Mansour asked Khalsi whether the United States was using Iraqi politicians, and also Sistani, to promote Western interests in Iraq.

=== Saudi criticism ===
In January 2010, during a Jumu&#x27;ah khutba (Friday sermon), an imam employed by the Saudi government, Mohamad al-Arefe, said Sistani was an &quot;obscene, irreligious atheist.&quot; The remarks prompted a protest by his followers in Iraq, Qom and Lebanon. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki rebuked the Saudi religious authorities. Lebanon-based Islamist organization Hezbollah also condemned the attack on Sistani, calling the speech &quot;inauspicious,&quot; while praising Sistani as one of Shia Islam&#x27;s &quot;most prominent religious references.&quot;

=== Channel 14 ===
In October 2024, right-wing Israeli news agency Channel 14 broadcast a list of &quot;axis of resistance&quot; leaders targeted for assassination, which displayed an image of Sistani under a red crosshair among Hezbollah and Hamas members. The image provoked outrage among the Iraqi public and condemnations from the Iraqi government and the United States&#x27; ambassador to Iraq, Alina Romanowski.

==Internet==
By working with Shia computer programmers and other specialists, Sistani sponsored the establishment of The Ahlulbayt Global Information Center, an international web resource, and he has since been called &quot;the electronic grand ayatollah par excellence.&quot;

===Cyber attacks===
On 18 September 2008, hackers attacked hundreds of Shia websites. The attacks were reportedly the work of a Muslim faction known as group-xp, based in the Arabian Peninsula and linked to Salafi and Wahhabi movements. They attacked an estimated three hundred Shia internet websites, including The Ahlulbayt (a.s.) Global Information Center. It was later dubbed the &quot;largest Wahhabi hacker attack&quot; in recent years.

After the attack, visitors to the site were greeted by a red attack banner bearing the slogan &quot;group-xp&quot; paired with a message in Arabic denouncing Shia beliefs and officials. Hackers also replaced a video of Sistani with one of comedian Bill Maher mocking Sistani.

However, the attack led to the retaliatory hacking of more than nine hundred Wahhabi and Salafi websites. One such successful attack was documented on video and uploaded to YouTube on 3 October 2008. The hacker, a Shia from the United Arab Emirates using the handle &quot;ShiaZone&quot;, was shown logging into email accounts of suspected members of group-xp. The hacked email accounts reportedly yielded group-xp&#x27;s contact information, information that was subsequently posted on Shia websites.

==Influence and legacy ==
Sistani is considered one of the world leaders of Shia Muslims. One of the most senior scholars of Twelver Shia with the rank of Grand Ayatollah and marja&#x27;, he has been described as the spiritual leader of Shia Muslims worldwide (as of 2003), &quot;the undisputed leader of Iraq&#x27;s Shias&quot;, included in top positions of &quot;The Muslim 500: The World&#x27;s Most Influential Muslims&quot;, from 2009 to 2024,&lt;ref name=&quot;themuslim500.com/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2004 and 2005.

=== Public appearances ===
Sistani has notoriously avoided public appearances, despite his widespread fame and not shying away from attention. In practice, Sistani never delivers public sermons or speeches and only releases official statements through &quot;official representatives&quot;. The statements are later transcribed and posted on Sistani&#x27;s official webpage, with the Grand Ayatollah&#x27;s official stamp, indicating the authenticity of the remarks. Though Sistani has appeared in a few short videos, he does not say anything in these videos and is usually motionless. The only public recording of Sistani&#x27;s voice is a short, Persian-language lecture by Sistani to students. Another video depicts Sistani in the back of a room conversing with a fellow cleric, again in Persian, and faintly captures sparse bits of Sistani&#x27;s vocalizations.

Sheikh Abdul-Mahdi Al-Karbalai is Sistani&#x27;s foremost representative and gives speeches in Sistani&#x27;s stead. Abdul-Mahdi Al-Karbalai is noted for having announced Sistani&#x27;s famous fatwa (edict) obligating Iraqis to vote, and with the rise of terrorism, to join the military to oppose ISIS.

==Personal life==
Sistani is married to the daughter of Muhammad Hasan Shirazi (d. 1972), the grandson of Mirza Shirazi. He has two sons, one of whom is Muhammad Rida.

<text>The Bizone () or Bizonia was the combination of the American and the British occupation zones on 1 January 1947 during the occupation of Germany after World War II. With the addition of the French occupation zone on 1 August 1948 the entity became the Trizone (; sometimes jokingly called Trizonesia (, )). Later, on 23 May 1949, the Trizone became the Federal Republic of Germany, commonly known as West Germany.

== History ==
=== Division of Germany into occupation zones ===
At the conclusion of World War II, the Allies began organising their respective occupation zones in Germany. The easternmost lands were permanently annexed to either Poland or the Soviet Union. The lands that were to remain &quot;German&quot; were divided four ways: The Americans occupied the South, the British the West and North, France the South-West, and the Soviets Central Germany (the future East Germany). Berlin was similarly divided into four zones.

=== Initial breakdown of four-zone cooperation ===
Cooperation between the four occupying powers broke down between 1945 and 1947. The Soviet Union, which encouraged and partly carried out the post-war expulsions of Germans from the areas under its rule, stopped delivering agricultural products from its zone in Germany to the more industrial western zones, thereby failing to fulfill its obligations under the Potsdam Agreements to provide supplies for the expellees, whose possessions had been confiscated. At Potsdam, it had been agreed that 15% of all equipment dismantled in the Western zones – especially from the metallurgical, chemical, and machine manufacturing industries – would be transferred to the Soviets in return for food, coal, potash (a basic material for fertilisers), timber, clay products, petroleum products, etc. The Western deliveries had started in 1946.

The Soviet deliveries – desperately needed to provide the eastern expellees with food, heat, and basic necessities, and to increase agricultural production in the remaining cultivation area – did not materialise. Consequently, the American military administrator, Lucius D. Clay, stopped the transfer of supplies and dismantled factories from the Ruhr area to the Soviet sector on 3 May 1946 while the expellees from the areas under Soviet rule were deported to the West until the end of 1948. As a result of the halt of deliveries from the western zones, the Soviet Union started a public relations campaign against American policy and began to obstruct the administrative work of all four zones.

=== Local governance by zone ===
The Soviets had established central administration in their zone for nutrition, transport, jurisdiction, finance, and other areas already in July 1945, before the participants of the Potsdam Conference had officially agreed to form central German administrations. The central administrations (Zentralverwaltungen) in the Soviet zone were not a form of German self-government, but were rather subdivisions of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SVAG), which had the legislative power. The states in the Soviet zone had only limited functions.

After Potsdam, in the summer of 1945, the Control Commission for Germany – British Element (CCG/BE) in Bad Oeynhausen created central offices (Zentralämter) for its zone. Its chairpersons were appointed by the British military government and were more influential than the minister-presidents of the states in the British zone, which at the time were administrative bodies rather than republics. After March 1946 the British zonal advisory board (Zonenbeirat) was established, with representatives of the states, the central offices, political parties, trade unions, and consumer organisations. As indicated by its name, the zonal advisory board had no legislative power, but was merely advisory. The Control Commission for Germany – British Element made all decisions with its legislative power.

In reaction to the Soviet and British advances, in October 1945 the Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS) encouraged the states in the US zone to form a co-ordinating body, the so-called Länderrat (council of states), with the power to legislate for the entire US zone. It created its own central bodies (Ausschüsse or joint interstate committees) headed by a secretariat seated in Stuttgart. While the British and Soviet central administrations were allied institutions, these US zone committees were not OMGUS subdivisions, but instead were autonomous bodies of German self-rule under OMGUS supervision.

France had not participated in the Potsdam Conference, so it felt free to approve some of the Potsdam Agreements and ignore others. Generally the French military government obstructed any interzonal administrations in Allied-occupied Germany; it even blocked interstate co-operation within its own zone, aiming at total decentralisation of Germany into a number of sovereign states. Therefore, the states in the French zone were given a high level of autonomy but under French supervision, inhibiting almost any interstate co-ordination.

=== Interzone efforts ===
At a conference of representatives of the states (&quot;Länder&quot;) within the American and British zones of occupation during 5-11 September 1946, decisions were taken on administrative bodies for the economy (Minden), transportation (Frankfurt am Main), food and agriculture (Stuttgart), postal and radio communications (Frankfurt am Main), and a German Finance Commission (Stuttgart). On 6 September, at the conference in Stuttgart, US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes delivered a Restatement of Policy on Germany, referring to the need for German economic unity and the development of its economic powers, as well as the strengthening of the Germans&#x27; responsibility for their own politics and economy, repudiating the Morgenthau Plan.

=== Formation of Bizonia ===
At the conference of minister-presidents of the &quot;Länder&quot; in the British and American zones on 4 October 1946 in Bremen, proposals were discussed for the creation of a German Länderrat (Länder Council), after the US example. In New York on 2 December 1946, British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin and his American counterpart James F. Byrnes agreed on the economic unification of the American and British zones, effective 1 January 1947.

The Americans and the British united their zones on 1 January 1947, creating the Bizone, in order to advance the development of a growing economy accompanied by a new political order in northwestern, western and southern Germany. In early 1947 the British zonal advisory board was restructured according to the example of the US zone Länderrat, so that the states in the British zone were empowered as autonomous legislating bodies, with the British military government confining itself to supervision. No agreement with the Soviets was possible. Allowing the states in the Soviet zone to govern the central administrations, then still subject to the SVAG, would have meant the end of communist rule in the east. If the state parliaments and governments were not clearly dominated by communists, as had resulted from the last somewhat free elections in the Soviet zone in 1946, the Soviet Union would have had to waive the establishment of a communist dictatorship in the Soviet zone. The Soviets had begun mass expropriations of entrepreneurs, real estate owners, and banks in September 1945, a process that had continued ever since.

The Bizone was the first step in coordinating the policies in at least two zones of occupation in Germany, which up to that time had operated mostly unconnected due to French obstructionism. The establishment of the Bizone became the nucleus of the future West Germany, ignoring for the time being the SVAG dominated policy in the Soviet zone and the anti-collaboration attitude imposed onto the states in the French zone. At the Washington Conference of Foreign Ministers (4–8 April 1949) France agreed to merge its zone with the Bizone into the Trizone. The unification of the three zones materialised only six weeks before the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany on 24 May 1949, with France only reluctantly having permitted the participants from its zone to join the necessary preparations.

The economic management of the two zones was handled by the Administrative Council for the Economy, based in Minden. Later, administrative cooperation expanded, paving the way to a West German rump state, even though many West German politicians were still strongly opposed to this. With the Bizone, the foundation for new constitutional and economic developments was laid, cemented by the currency reform of June 1948. On the other hand, Germany was now on a track to the eventual division into an East and a West. The United States and the United Kingdom had emphasised the administrative and economic nature of the Bizone, but it still counts as the basis for the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany, which took over the rights and duties of the administration of the Bizone (Article 133 of the Grundgesetz).

On 29 May 1947, the American and British military governments signed an agreement creating an Economic Council for the Bizone, to be based in Frankfurt am Main.

Lewkowicz argues that the establishment of the Bizone was the most significant factor in the creation of two blocs in Europe and therefore in the configuration of the Cold War international order.

=== Trizonia, end of inter-Allied control, and formation of West Germany ===
Bizonia governance was extended to include the French occupation zone on 1 August 1948 and the resulting structure was unofficially called either &quot;Trizonia&quot; or &quot;Trizonesia&quot;. Relations among the four occupying powers continued to deteriorate, and the quadripartite structures became unmanageable. In March 1948, the Allied Control Council ceased to operate and was replaced for the Trizone by the Allied High Commission. Subsequently, the Trizone became the Federal Republic of Germany, commonly known as West Germany, on 23 May 1949. The Soviet-sponsored Kommandatura ceased to operate in June 1948.

== Geography and population ==

The Bizone included the &quot;Länder&quot; Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, Bremen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse, Bavaria, and Württemberg-Baden – the northern part of the later Baden-Württemberg – but not the states of the French zone, to wit Württemberg-Hohenzollern, Baden, Rheinland-Pfalz, or those in the Soviet zone Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, and Saxony. Neither part of Berlin was part of the Trizone nor were any former parts of Germany, such as the Saarland, which, since February 1946, had not been under the joint allied (French) occupational control. The Bizone had a population of approximately 39 million people.

<text>Sir James Milne Wilson (29 February 1812 – 29 February 1880) was a colonial Australian politician who served as premier of Tasmania from 1869 to 1872.

==Biography==
Wilson was born in 1812 in Banff, Scotland; the third son of John Wilson, a shipowner, and his wife, Barbara Gray; maternal grandson of Alexander Gray and wife, Jean Bean (See Pedigree of Bean of Portsoy). Educated at Banff and Edinburgh, he emigrated to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (later Tasmania) in 1829, studied practical engineering and afterwards became a ship&#x27;s officer. He was connected with the Cascade Brewery for 14 years and became its manager. He entered politics in October 1859 as member for Hobart in the legislative council, and in January 1863 joined the Whyte cabinet as minister without portfolio. In 1868, at the time of the visit of the Duke of Edinburgh, Wilson was mayor of Hobart and on 4 August 1869 became premier and colonial secretary in a ministry which lasted until November 1872.

Anthony Trollope, who came to Australia in 1871, formed a high opinion of Wilson: &quot;I thought I had not met a sounder politician in Australia... Victoria is desirous of annexing Tasmania. Perhaps when she has done so, Mr Wilson will become premier for the joint colonies, and then great things may be expected.&quot; In 1872, Wilson was elected president of the Tasmanian Legislative Council, and held this position until his death on 29 February 1880, on his &quot;seventeenth&quot; birthday aged 68.

In 1847, he married Deborah Hope, daughter of Peter Degraves. Lady Wilson survived him with children. He was knighted in 1873 and created KCMG in 1878. He was a man of unbounded popularity, well known for his charities. He was president of the Southern Tasmanian Agricultural Society and chairman of committees and president of the Tasmanian Jockey Club. As a politician, Wilson showed wisdom in his advocacy of free-trade between the Australian colonies. Tasmania passed an intercolonial free trade act in 1870 during his premiership, but the question made no headway on the mainland.

In an extremely rare coincidence, he was born on 29 February (making him a leapling) and died on the same date at the age of 68.

<doc id="512842" wikidata="Q2621157" url="?curid=512842" title="Cheesecloth">
<text>Cheesecloth is a loose-woven gauze-like carded cotton cloth used primarily in cheesemaking and cooking. The fabric has holes large enough to quickly allow liquids (like whey) to percolate through the fabric, but small enough to retain solids like cheese curds.

== Grades ==

Cheesecloth is available in at least seven different grades, from open to extra-fine weave. Grades are distinguished by the number of threads per inch in each direction.

==Uses==

===Food preparation===
The primary use of cheesecloth is in some styles of cheesemaking, where it is used to remove whey from cheese curds, and to help hold the curds together as the cheese is formed. Cheesecloth is also used in straining stocks and custards, bundling herbs, making tofu and ghee, and thickening yogurt. Fruitcake is wrapped in rum-infused cheesecloth during the process of &quot;feeding&quot; the fruitcake as it ripens.

Queso blanco and queso fresco are Spanish and Mexican cheeses that are made from whole milk using cheesecloth. Italian Ricotta is made from cow, sheep or goat acidified whey, traditionally formed in cheesecloth cones. Quark is a type of German unsalted cheese that is sometimes formed with cheesecloth. Paneer is a kind of Indian fresh cheese that is commonly made with cheesecloth.

===Manufacturing, testing and preservation===
Cheesecloth can also be used for several printmaking processes including lithography for wiping up gum arabic. In intaglio, a heavily-starched cheesecloth called tarlatan is used for wiping away excess ink from the printing surface.

Cheesecloth #60 is used in product safety and regulatory testing for potential fire hazards. Cheesecloth is wrapped tightly over the device under test, which is then subjected to simulated conditions such as lightning surges conducted through power or telecom cables, power faults, etc. The device may be destroyed but must not ignite the cheesecloth. This is to ensure that the device can fail safely, and not start electrical fires in the vicinity.

Cheesecloth made to United States Federal Standard CCC-C-440 is used to test the durability of optical coatings per United States Military Standard MIL-C-48497. The optics are exposed to a 95–100% humidity environment at for 24 hours, and then a thick by wide pad of cheesecloth is rubbed over the optical surface for at least 50 strokes under at least . The optical surface is examined for streaks or scratches, and then its optical performance is measured to ensure that no deterioration occurred.

Cheesecloth is used in India and Pakistan for making summer shirts. Cheesecloth material shirts were popular for beachwear during the 1960s and 1970s in the United States.

Cheesecloth has a use in anatomical dissection laboratories to slow the process of desiccation. The cloth can be soaked with a preservative solution such as formalin then wrapped around the specimen or at other times simply wrapped first then sprayed with water.

Cheesecloth has been used to create the illusion of &quot;ectoplasm&quot; during spirit channelling or other ghost-related phenomena.

<doc id="512851" wikidata="Q247170" url="?curid=512851" title="Hemocytometer">
<text>The hemocytometer (or haemocytometer, or Burker&#x27;s chamber) is a counting-chamber device originally designed and usually used for counting blood cells.

The hemocytometer was invented by Louis-Charles Malassez and consists of a thick glass microscope slide with a rectangular indentation that creates a precision volume chamber. This chamber is engraved with a laser-etched grid of perpendicular lines. The device is carefully crafted so that the area bounded by the lines is known, and the depth of the chamber is also known. By observing a defined area of the grid, it is therefore possible to count the number of cells or particles in a specific volume of fluid, and thereby calculate the concentration of cells in the fluid overall. A well used type of hemocytometer is the &quot;Neubauer&quot; counting chamber.

Other types of hemocytometers with different rulings are in use for different applications. Fuchs-Rosenthal rulings, commonly used for spinal fluid counting, Howard Mold rulings used for mold on food and food packaging products, McMaster Egg Slide ruling used for counting microbial eggs in fecal material, Nageotte Chamber ruling for counting low levels of white cells in white cell-reduced platelet components, Palmer Nanoplankton ruling for counting smaller plankters. Petroff-Hausser counter using Improved Neubauer rulings is used for bacteria or sperm counts, and is offered with varying chamber depths. The Sedgwick-Rafter Cell ruling in a hemocytometer is primarily designed for use in the microscopy of drinking water.

==Principles==
The gridded area of the Improved Neubauer ruled hemocytometer consists of nine 1 x 1 mm (1 mm2) squares. These are subdivided in three directions; 0.25 x 0.25 mm (0.0625 mm2), 0.25 x 0.20 mm (0.05 mm2) and 0.20 x 0.20 mm (0.04 mm2). The central square is further subdivided into 0.05 x 0.05 mm (0.0025 mm2) squares. The raised edges of the hemocytometer hold the coverslip 0.1 mm off the marked grid, giving each square a defined volume (see figure on the right).
==Usage==
To use the hemocytometer, first make sure that the special coverslip provided with the counting chamber is properly positioned on the surface of the counting chamber. When the two glass surfaces are in proper contact Newton&#x27;s rings can be observed. If so, the cell suspension is applied to the edge of the coverslip to be sucked into the void by capillary action which completely fills the chamber with the sample. The number of cells in the chamber can be determined by direct counting using a microscope, and visually distinguishable cells can be differentially counted. The number of cells in the chamber is used to calculate the concentration or density of the cells in the mixture the sample comes from. It is the number of cells in the chamber divided by the chamber&#x27;s volume, which is known from the start, taking account of any dilutions and counting shortcuts:

formula_1 

formula_2

where the volume of the diluted sample (after dilution) divided by the volume of the original mixture in the sample (before dilution) is the dilution factor. For example, if the volume of the original mixture was 20μL and it was diluted once (by adding 20μL dilutant), then the second term in parentheses is 40μL/20μL. The volume of the squares counted is the one shown in the table at the top, depending on the size (see figure on the right). The number of cells counted is the sum of all cells counted across squares in one chamber. The proportion of the cells counted applies if not all inner squares within a set square are counted (i.e., if only 4 out of the 20 in a corner square are counted, then this term will equal 0.2). When counting large squares with a volume of 100 nanoliter (nL), a multiplication by 10000 leads to the desired cell count per milliliter.
For most applications, the four large corner squares are only used. The cells that are on or touching the top and left lines are counted, but the ones on or touching the right or bottom lines are ignored.

==Requirements==

The original suspension must be mixed thoroughly before taking a sample. This ensures the sample is representative, and not just an artifact of the particular region of the original mixture it was drawn from.

An appropriate dilution of the mixture with regard to the number of cells to be counted should be used. If the sample is not diluted enough, the cells will be too crowded and difficult to count. If it is too dilute, the sample size will not be enough to make strong inferences about the concentration in the original mixture.

By performing a redundant test on a second chamber, the results can be compared. If they differ more than 2 times the counting error (square root of the count), the method of taking the sample may be unreliable (e.g., the original mixture is not mixed thoroughly).

The counting chamber should be filled by capillary action after the chamber lid (special cover-slip with certified thickness and flatness) has been put in place. This avoids the risk that the cells could sediment/stick to the glass or some volume to evaporate before the cover-slip is placed on top and resulting in an overestimation of the cell concentration. Sedimentation is less of a problem with bacteria but evaporation, more prevalent in low-humidity air-conditioned laboratories, still has to be minimized.

==Applications==

*Blood counts: for patients with abnormal blood cells, where automated counters do not perform well.
*Sperm counts
*Urine microscopy
*Cell culture: when subculturing or recording cell growth over time.
*Beer brewing: for the preparation of the yeast.
*Phytoplankton cell counting
*Cell processing for downstream analysis: accurate cell numbers are needed in many tests (PCR, flow cytometry), while some others require high cell viability.
*Measurement of cell size: in a micrograph, the real cell size can be inferred by scaling it to the width of a hemocytometer square, which is known.

<text>The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) was a 2002 U.S. Act of Congress promoted by the presidency of George W. Bush. It reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and included Title I provisions applying to disadvantaged students. It mandated standards-based education reform based on the premise that setting high standards and establishing measurable goals could improve individual outcomes in education. To receive federal school funding, states had to create and give assessments to all students at select grade levels.

The act did not set national achievement standards. Instead, each state developed its own standards. NCLB expanded the federal role in public education through further emphasis on annual testing, annual academic progress, report cards, and teacher qualifications, as well as significant changes in funding. While the bill faced challenges from both Democrats and Republicans, it passed in both chambers of the legislature with significant bipartisan support.

Many provisions of the act generated significant controversy. By 2015, bipartisan criticism had increased so much that a bipartisan Congress stripped away the national features of No Child Left Behind. Its replacement, the Every Student Succeeds Act, turned the remnants over to the states.

== Background ==
Prior to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. Its goal was to provide additional resources to low-income students, but following its enactment, the nation repeatedly fell short of meeting the law&#x27;s goal of providing full educational opportunities to students. Fears concerning the American education system culminated with the 1983 release of a report entitled &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot;, written by President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s National Commission on Excellence in Education. This report suggested that America&#x27;s economic security would be severely compromised unless there were a complete reorientation of the education system and an increase in the set of academic standards that students were expected to achieve. Though many Republican groups historically opposed the active role of the federal government in education, lobbying efforts, public opinion, and other political developments in Washington (such as the Republican defeat in the 1996 presidential election) caused congressional Republicans to push for federal educational reforms that emphasized standardized testing and other accountability measures. At the time, increased attention was being paid to the state of education in the nation because prior to the 2000 United States presidential election, then-candidate George Bush made a number of campaign promises related to bipartisan education reform.

The increased focus in the United States on educational standards and accountability reflected international education policy developments and debates. After World War II, international organizations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Bank, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) devoted their attention to global educational development. From the 1960s onward, these organizations increasingly focused on learning outcomes and evaluation procedures that included the evaluation of education systems against defined standards of performance. The 2001 NCLB Act was part of this global movement toward greater accountability in education.

==Legislative history==
President George W. Bush first proposed the use of federal aid to create a plan by which to hold schools accountable for the educational outcomes of their students on January 23, 2001; however, as it was initially described, the Act faced significant criticism from interest groups such as the Education Trust because of its inclusion of vouchers. Vouchers would enable parents to choose a different school (public, private, or otherwise) for their child to attend if their district failed to meet state standards; however, critics stated that this move would take funds away from schools that needed the most funding. The NCLB Act was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on March 22, 2001, and it was coauthored by Representatives John Boehner (R-OH), George Miller (D-CA), and Senators Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and Judd Gregg (R-NH). As it made its way through the House of Representatives and the Senate, the bill faced a number of challenges, ranging from Democratic appeals for more funding, to Republican pushback on the increased role of the Federal government in the realm of education. Despite this, the Act garnered bipartisan support in both chambers of the legislature, and it was passed in the United States House of Representatives on December 13, 2001 (voting 381–41), and in the United States Senate on December 18, 2001 (voting 87–10). The Act was then signed into law by President Bush on January 8, 2002.

==Provisions of the act==
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 aimed to increase school accountability for student educational outcomes and reduce disparities between lower-performing and higher-performing students and districts. To achieve these goals, NCLB required all federally funded public schools to administer a standardized test annually to students in selected grades. To improve student outcomes, the act identified several strategies school districts could employ, such as teacher professional development, educational technology, and activities to involve parents. The act also required each local agency to determine the average number of students in daily attendance in the K-12 schools it served to allocate grant money effectively for NCLB programs. Additionally, the law emphasized improving the communication of information about student achievement and school performance to parents through reporting systems designed to reflect best educational practices.

Schools that receive Title I funding through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 must make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in test scores (e.g. each year, fifth graders must do better on standardized tests than the previous year&#x27;s fifth graders).

If the school&#x27;s results are repeatedly poor, then steps are taken to improve the school.
* Schools that miss AYP for a second consecutive year are publicly labeled as &quot;In Need of Improvement,&quot; and must develop a two-year improvement plan for the subject that the school is not teaching well. Students have the option to transfer to a higher performing school within the school district, if any exists.
* Missing AYP in the third year forces the school to offer free tutoring and other supplemental education services to students who are struggling.
* If a school misses its AYP target for a fourth consecutive year, the school is labelled as requiring &quot;corrective action,&quot; which might involve wholesale replacement of staff, introduction of a new curriculum, or extending the amount of time students spend in class.
* A fifth year of failure results in planning to restructure the entire school; the plan is implemented if the school unsuccessfully hits its AYP targets for the sixth consecutive year. Common options include closing the school, turning the school into a charter school, hiring a private company to run the school, or asking the state office of education to run the school directly.

States must create AYP objectives consistent with the following requirements of the law:
# States must develop AYP statewide measurable objectives for improved achievement by all students and for specific groups: economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and students with limited English proficiency.
# The objectives must be set with the goal of having all students at the proficient level or above within 12 years (i.e. by the end of the 2013–14 school year).
# AYP must be primarily based on state assessments, but must also include one additional academic indicator, which is defined by the states.
# The AYP objectives must be assessed at the school level. Schools that failed to meet their AYP objective for two consecutive years are identified for improvement.
# School AYP results must be reported separately for each group of students identified above so that it can be determined whether each student group met the AYP objective.
# At least 95% of each group must participate in state assessments.
# States may aggregate up to three years of data in making AYP determinations.

The act requires states to provide &quot;highly qualified&quot; teachers to all students. Each state sets its own standards for what counts as &quot;highly qualified.&quot; Similarly, the act requires states to set &quot;one high, challenging standard&quot; for its students. Each state decides for itself what counts as &quot;one high, challenging standard,&quot; but the curriculum standards must be applied to all students, rather than having different standards for students in different cities or other parts of the state.

The act also requires schools to let military recruiters have students&#x27; contact information and other access to the student, if the school provides that information to universities or employers, unless the students opt out of giving military recruiters access. This portion of the law has drawn a fair amount of criticism and has even led to political resistance. For instance, in 2003 in Santa Cruz, California, student-led efforts forced school districts to create an &quot;opt-in&quot; policy that required students affirm they wanted the military to have their information. This successful student organizing effort was copied in various other cities throughout the United States.

The act outlines programs and requirements that have the intended purpose of preventing drug and alcohol use by students, as well as programs that would deter students from committing acts of violence in schools. The act also provides funds to states in order to enable students who have been expelled from school for certain offenses to perform acts of community service.

===Title II – Mathematics and Science Partnerships===

Mathematics and Science Partnerships (MSP) is education policy from Title 2, Part B, Sections 2201–2203 of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The purpose of MSP is to increase student achievement in science and mathematics by partnering IHE science, math, and engineering departments with elementary and secondary science and math teachers in high-need local educational agencies (LEAs) in order to develop teachers&#x27; content knowledge and instructional performance. SEAs may apply for competitive grants and then IHEs and LEAs may apply for a subgrant of the SEA.

==Effects on teachers, schools, and school districts==

===Increased accountability===
Supporters of the NCLB claim one of the strong positive points of the bill is the increased accountability that is required of schools and teachers. According to the legislation, schools must pass yearly tests that judge student improvement over the fiscal year. These yearly standardized tests are the main means of determining whether schools live up to required standards. If required improvements are not made, the schools face decreased funding and other punishments that contribute to the increased accountability. According to supporters, these goals help teachers and schools realize the significance and importance of the educational system and how it affects the nation. Opponents of this law say that the punishments only hurt the schools and do not contribute to the improvement of student education.

In addition to and in support of the above points, proponents claim that No Child Left Behind:
* Links state academic content standards with student outcomes
* Measures student performance: a student&#x27;s progress in reading and math must be measured annually in grades 3 through 8 and at least once during high school via standardized tests
* Provides information for parents by requiring states and school districts to give parents detailed report cards on schools and districts explaining the school&#x27;s AYP performance; schools must inform parents when their child is taught by a teacher or para-professional who does not meet &quot;highly qualified&quot; requirements
* Establishes the foundation for schools and school districts to significantly enhance parental involvement and improved administration through the use of the assessment data to drive decisions on instruction, curriculum and business practices

The commonwealth of Pennsylvania has proposed tying teacher&#x27;s salaries to test scores. If a district&#x27;s students do poorly, the state cuts the district&#x27;s budget the following year and the teachers get a pay cut. Critics point out that if a school does poorly, reducing its budget and cutting teacher salaries will likely hamper the school&#x27;s ability to improve.

===School choice===
* Gives options to students enrolled in schools failing to meet AYP. If a school fails to meet AYP targets two or more years running, the school must offer eligible children the chance to transfer to higher-performing local schools, receive free tutoring, or attend after-school programs.
* Gives school districts the opportunity to demonstrate proficiency, even for subgroups that do not meet State Minimum Achievement standards, through a process called &quot;safe harbor,&quot; a precursor to growth-based or value-added assessments.

===Narrow definition of research===
The act requires schools to rely on scientifically based research for programs and teaching methods. The act defines this as &quot;research that involves the application of rigorous, systematic, and objective procedures to obtain reliable and valid knowledge relevant to education activities and programs.&quot; Scientifically based research results in &quot;replicable and applicable findings&quot; from research that used appropriate methods to generate persuasive, empirical conclusions.

===Quality and distribution of teachers===
Prior to the NCLB act, new teachers were typically required to have a bachelor&#x27;s degree, be fully certified, and demonstrate subject matter knowledge—generally through tests. Under NCLB, existing teachers—including those with tenure—were also supposed to meet standards. They could meet the same requirements set for new teachers or could meet a state-determined &quot;...high, objective, uniform state standard of evaluation,&quot; aka HOUSSE. Downfall of the quality requirements of the NCLB legislation have received little research attention, in part because state rules require few changes from pre-existing practice. There is also little evidence that the rules have altered trends in observable teacher traits. American educators have been struggling to identify which teacher traits are important contributors to student achievement. Currently, there is no consensus on what traits are most important and most education policy experts agree that further research is required.

==Effects on student assessment==
Several of the analyses of state accountability systems that were in place before NCLB indicate that outcomes accountability led to faster growth in achievement for the states that introduced such systems. The direct analysis of state test scores before and after enactment of NCLB also supports its positive impact. A primary criticism asserts that NCLB reduces effective instruction and student learning by causing states to lower achievement goals and motivate teachers to &quot;teach to the test.&quot; A primary supportive claim asserts that systematic testing provides data that shed light on which schools don&#x27;t teach basic skills effectively, so that interventions can be made to improve outcomes for all students while reducing the achievement gap for disadvantaged and disabled students.

==Improved test scores==
The United States Department of Education points to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) results, released in July 2005, showing improved student achievement in reading and math:
* More progress was made by nine-year-olds in reading in the last five years than in the previous 28 years combined.
* America&#x27;s nine-year-olds age group, posted the best scores in reading (since 1971) and math (since 1973) in the history of the report. America&#x27;s 13-year-olds earned the highest math scores the test ever recorded.
* Reading and math scores for black and Hispanic nine-year-olds reached an all-time high.
* Achievement gaps in reading and math between white and black nine-year-olds and between white and Hispanic nine-year-olds are at an all-time low.
* Forty-three states and the District of Columbia either improved academically or held steady in all categories (fourth- and eighth-grade reading and fourth- and eighth-grade math).

These statistics compare 2005 with 2000 though No Child Left Behind did not even take effect until 2003. Critics point out that the increase in scores between 2000 and 2003 was roughly the same as the increase between 2003 and 2005, which calls into question how any increase can be attributed to No Child Left Behind. They also argue that some of the subgroups are cherry-picked—that in other subgroups scores remained the same or fell. Also, the makers of the standardized tests have been blamed for making the tests easier so that it is easier for schools to sufficiently improve.

Education researchers Thomas Dee and Brian Jacob argue that NCLB showed statistically significant positive impact on students&#x27; performance on 4th-grade math exams (equal to two-thirds of a year&#x27;s worth of growth), smaller and statistically insignificant improvements in 8th-grade math exam performance, and no discernible improvement in reading performance.

===Criticisms of standardized testing===
Critics argue that the focus on standardized testing (all students in a state take the same test under the same conditions) encourages teachers to teach a narrow subset of skills that the school believes increases test performance, rather than achieve in-depth understanding of the overall curriculum. For example, a teacher who knows that all questions on a math test are simple addition problems (e.g., What is 2 + 3?) might not invest any class time on the practical applications of addition, to leave more time for the material the test assesses. This is colloquially referred to as &quot;teaching to the test.&quot; &quot;Teaching to the test&quot; has been observed to raise test scores, though not as much as other teaching techniques.

Many teachers who practice &quot;teaching to the test&quot; misinterpret the educational outcomes the tests are designed to measure. On two state tests, New York and Michigan, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) almost two-thirds of eighth graders missed math word problems that required an application of the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between two points. The teachers correctly anticipated the content of the tests, but incorrectly assumed each test would present simplistic items rather than higher-order items.

Another problem is that outside influences often affect student performance. Students who struggle to take tests may perform well using another method of learning such as project-based learning. Sometimes, factors such as home life can affect test performance. Basing performance on one test inaccurately measures student success overall. No Child Left Behind has failed to account for all these factors.

Those opposed to the use of testing to determine educational achievement prefer alternatives such as subjective teacher opinions, classwork, and performance-based assessments.

Under No Child Left Behind, schools and teachers were held almost exclusively accountable for levels of student performance. But that meant that even schools that were making great strides with students were still labeled as &quot;failing&quot; just because the students had not yet made it all the way to a &quot;proficient&quot; level of achievement. Since 2005, the U.S. Department of Education has approved 15 states to implement growth model pilots. Each state adopted one of four distinct growth models: Trajectory, Transition Tables, Student Growth Percentiles, and Projection.

The incentives for improvement also may cause states to lower their official standards. Because each state can produce its own standardized tests, a state can make its statewide tests easier to increase scores. Missouri, for example, improved testing scores but openly admitted that they lowered the standards. A 2007 study by the U.S. Dept. of Education indicates that the observed differences in states&#x27; reported scores is largely due to differences in the stringency of their standards.

==Intended effects on curriculum and standards==

===Improvement over local standards===
Many argued that local government had failed students, necessitating federal intervention to remedy issues like teachers teaching outside their areas of expertise, and complacency in the face of continually failing schools. Some local governments, notably that of New York state, have supported NCLB provisions, because local standards failed to provide adequate oversight over special education, and NCLB would let them use longitudinal data more effectively to monitor Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). States all over the United States have shown improvements in their progress as an apparent result of NCLB. For example, Wisconsin ranks first of all fifty states plus the District of Columbia, with ninety-eight percent of its schools achieving No Child Left Behind standards.

===Quality of education===
* Increases the quality of education by requiring schools to improve their performance
* Improves quality of instruction by requiring schools to implement &quot;scientifically based research&quot; practices in the classroom, parent involvement programs, and professional development activities for those students that are not encouraged or expected to attend college.
* Supports early literacy through the Early Reading First initiative.
* Emphasizes reading, language arts, mathematics and science achievement as &quot;core academic subjects.&quot;
Student performance in other subjects (besides reading and math) will be measured as a part of overall progress.

===Effect on arts and electives===
NCLB&#x27;s main focus is on skills in reading, writing, and mathematics, which are areas related to economic success. Combined with the budget crises in the late-2000s recession, some schools have cut or eliminated classes and resources for many subject areas that are not part of NCLB&#x27;s accountability standards. Since 2007, almost 71% of schools have reduced instruction time in subjects such as history, arts, language, and music to provide more time and resources to mathematics and English.

In some schools, the classes remain available, but individual students who are not proficient in basic skills are sent to remedial reading or mathematics classes rather than arts, sports, or other optional subjects.

According to Paul Reville, the author of &quot;Stop Narrowing of the Curriculum By Right-Sizing School Time,&quot; teachers are learning that students need more time to excel in the &quot;needed&quot; subjects. The students need more time to achieve the basic goals that should come by somewhat relevant to a student.

Physical education, on the other hand, is one of the subjects least affected. Some might find this confusing because like many electives and non-core classes, No Child Left Behind does not address Physical Education directly. Two reasons why Physical Education is not adversely affected include the obesity crisis in the United States that the federal government is trying to reverse through programs like First Lady Michelle Obama&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Move Campaign,&quot; which among other things, looks to improve the quantity and quality of physical education. Secondly, there is research, including a 2005 study by Dr. Charles H. Hillmam of The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that concludes that fitness is globally related to academic achievement.

The opportunities, challenges, and risks that No Child Left Behind poses for science education in elementary and middle schools—worldwide competition insists on rapidly improving science education. Adding science assessments to the NCLB requirements may ultimately result in science being taught in more elementary schools and by more teachers than ever before. 2/3 of elementary school teachers indicated that they were not familiar with national science standards. Most concern circulates around the result that, consuming too much time for language arts and mathematics may limit children&#x27;s experience—and curiosity and interest—in sciences.

==Effects on school and students==

===Gifted students===
NCLB pressures schools to guarantee that nearly all students meet the minimum skill levels (set by each state) in reading, writing, and arithmetic—but requires nothing beyond these minima. It provides no incentives to improve student achievement beyond the bare minimum. Programs not essential for achieving mandated minimum skills are neglected or canceled by those districts.

In particular, NCLB does not require any programs for gifted, talented, and other high-performing students. Federal funding of gifted education decreased by a third over the law&#x27;s first five years. There was only one program that helped improve the gifted: they received $9.6 million. In the 2007 budget, President George W. Bush zeroed this out. While NCLB is silent on the education of academically gifted students, some states (such as Arizona, California, Virginia, and Pennsylvania) require schools to identify gifted students and provide them with an appropriate education, including grade advancement. In other states, such as Michigan, state funding for gifted and talented programs was cut by up to 90% in the year after the Act became law.

A 2008 study by the Fordham Institute suggests that the lack of incentive for schools to meet the needs of high achieving students had serious consequences: while between 2000 and 2007 students in the lowest 10th percentile (low performers) had improved their average performance on the 4th grade reading portion of the National Assessment of Educational Progress by 16 points, the scores of the highest-performing students (90th percentile and above) hardly budged.

===Unrealistic goals===
&quot;There&#x27;s a fallacy in the law and everybody knows it,&quot; said Alabama State Superintendent Joe Morton on Wednesday, August 11, 2010. According to the No Child Left Behind Act, by 2014, every child is supposed to test on grade level in reading and math. &quot;That can&#x27;t happen,&quot; said Morton. &quot;You have too many variables and you have too many scenarios, and everybody knows that would never happen.&quot; Alabama State Board Member Mary Jane Caylor said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that No Child Left Behind has benefited this state.&quot; She argued the goal of 100 percent proficiency is unattainable. Charles Murray wrote of the law: &quot;The United States Congress, acting with large bipartisan majorities, at the urging of the President, enacted as the law of the land that all children are to be above average.&quot;

===Gaming the system===

The system of incentives and penalties set up a strong motivation for schools, districts, and states to manipulate test results. For example, schools have been shown to employ &quot;creative reclassification&quot; of high school dropouts (to reduce unfavorable statistics). For example, at Sharpstown High School in Houston, Texas, more than 1,000 students began high school as freshmen, and four years later, fewer than 300 students were enrolled in the senior class. However, none of these &quot;missing&quot; students from Sharpstown High were reported as dropouts.

===Variability in student potential and 100% compliance===
The act is promoted as requiring 100% of students (including disadvantaged and special education students) within a school to reach the same state standards in reading and mathematics by 2014; detractors charge that a 100% goal is unattainable, and critics of the NCLB requirement for &quot;one high, challenging standard&quot; claim that some students are simply unable to perform at the given level for their age, no matter how effective the teacher is. While statewide standards reduce the educational inequality between privileged and underprivileged districts in a state, they still impose a &quot;one size fits all&quot; standard on individual students. Particularly in states with high standards, schools can be punished for not being able to dramatically raise the achievement of students that may have below-average capabilities.

The term &quot;all&quot; in NCLB ended up meaning less than 100% of students, because by the time the 100% requirement was to take effect in 2015, no state had reached the goal of having 100% of students pass the proficiency bar. 

Simply being classified as having special education needs does not automatically exempt students from assessment. Most students with mild disabilities or physical disabilities take the same test as non-disabled students. Students who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) and who are assessed must receive the accommodations specified in the IEP during assessment; if these accommodations do not change the nature of the assessment, then these students&#x27; scores are counted the same as any other student&#x27;s score. Common acceptable changes include extended test time, testing in a quieter room or one-on-one with a proctor, translation of math problems into the student&#x27;s native language, receiving large print, or allowing a student to type answers (often on a plain-text editor on a locked-down computer without spell-check, dictionaries, and access to the internet) instead of writing them by hand.
In addition to not requiring 5% of students to be assessed at all, regulations let schools use alternate assessments to declare up to 1% of all students proficient for the purposes of the Act. States are given broad discretion in selecting alternate assessments. For example, a school may accept an Advanced Placement test for English in lieu of the English test written by the state, and simplified tests for students with significant cognitive disabilities. The Virginia Alternate Assessment Program (VAAP) and Virginia Grade Level Alternative (VGLA) options, for example, are portfolio assessments.

Organizations that support NCLB assessment of disabled or limited English proficient (LEP) students say that inclusion ensures that deficiencies in the education of these disadvantaged students are identified and addressed. Opponents say that testing students with disabilities violates the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) by making students with disabilities learn the same material as non-disabled students.

===Children with disabilities===
NCLB includes incentives to reward schools showing progress for students with disabilities and other measures to fix or provide students with alternative options than schools not meeting the needs of the disabled population. The law is written so that the scores of students with IEPs (Individualized Education Plans) and 504 plans are counted just as other students&#x27; scores are counted. Schools have argued against having disabled populations involved in their AYP measurements because they claim that there are too many variables involved.

===Aligning the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act===
Stemming from the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA) of 1975, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was enacted in its first form in 1991, and then reenacted with new education aspects in 2006 (although still referred to as IDEA 2004). It kept the EAHCA requirements of free and accessible education for all children. The 2004 IDEA authorized formula grants to states and discretionary grants for research, technology, and training. It also required schools to use research-based interventions to assist students with disabilities.

The amount of funding each school would receive from its &quot;Local Education Agency&quot; for each year would be divided by the number of children with disabilities and multiplied by the number of students with disabilities participating in the schoolwide programs.

Particularly since 2004, policymakers have sought to align IDEA with NCLB. The most obvious points of alignment include the shared requirements for Highly Qualified Teachers, for establishment of goals for students with special needs, and for assessment levels for these students. In 2004, George Bush signed provisions that would define for both of these acts what was considered a &quot;highly qualified teacher.&quot;

===Positive effects for students with disabilities===
The National Council on Disability (NCD) looks at how NCLB and IDEA are improving outcomes for students with Down syndrome. The effects they investigate include reducing the number of students who drop out, increasing graduation rates, and effective strategies to transition students to post-secondary education. Their studies have reported that NCLB and IDEA have changed the attitudes and expectations for students with disabilities. They are pleased that students are finally included in state assessment and accountability systems. NCLB made assessments be taken &quot;seriously,&quot; they found, as now assessments and accommodations are under review by administrators.

Another organization that found positive correlations between NCLB and IDEA was the National Center on Educational Outcomes. It published a brochure for parents of students with disabilities about how the two (NCLB &amp; IDEA) work well together because they &quot;provide both individualized instruction and school accountability for students and disabilities.&quot; They specifically highlight the new focus on &quot;shared responsibility of general and special education teachers,&quot; forcing schools to have disabled students more on their radar.&quot; They do acknowledge, however, that for each student to &quot;participate in the general curriculum [of high standards for all students] and make progress toward proficiency,&quot; additional time and effort for coordination are needed. The National Center on Educational Outcomes reported that now disabled students will receive &quot;...the academic attention and resources they deserved.&quot;

Particular research has been done on how the laws impact students who are deaf or hard of hearing. First, the legislation makes schools responsible for how students with disabilities score—emphasizing &quot;...student outcomes instead of placement.&quot; It also puts the public&#x27;s eye on how outside programs can be utilized to improve outcomes for this underserved population, and has thus prompted more research on the effectiveness of certain in- and out-of-school interventions. For example, NCLB requirements have made researchers begin to study the effects of read aloud or interpreters on both reading and mathematics assessments, and on having students sign responses that are then recorded by a scribe.

Still, research thus far on the positive effects of NCLB/IDEA is limited. It has been aimed at young students in an attempt to find strategies to help them learn to read. Evaluations also have included a limited number of students, which make it very difficult to draw conclusions to a broader group. Evaluations also focus only on one type of disabilities.

===Negative effects for students with disabilities===
The National Council for Disabilities had reservations about how the regulations of NCLB fit with those of IDEA. One concern is how schools can effectively intervene and develop strategies when NCLB calls for group accountability rather than individual student attention. The Individual nature of IDEA is &quot;inconsistent with the group nature of NCLB.&quot; They worry that NCLB focuses too much on standardized testing and not enough on the work-based experience necessary for obtaining jobs in the future. Also, NCLB is measured essentially by a single test score, but IDEA calls for various measures of student success.

IDEA&#x27;s focus on various measures stems from its foundation in Individualized Education Plans for students with disabilities (IEP). An IEP is designed to give students with disabilities individual goals that are often not on their grade level. An IEP is intended for &quot;developing goals and objectives that correspond to the needs of the student, and ultimately choosing a placement in the least restrictive environment possible for the student.&quot; Under the IEP, students could be able to legally have lowered success criteria for academic success.

A 2006 report by the Center for Evaluation and Education Policy (CEEP) and the Indiana Institute on Disability and Community indicated that most states were not making AYP because of special education subgroups even though progress had been made toward that end. This was in effect pushing schools to cancel the inclusion model and keep special education students separate. &quot;IDEA calls for individualized curriculum and assessments that determine success based on growth and improvement each year. NCLB, in contrast, measures all students by the same markers, which are based not on individual improvement but by proficiency in math and reading,&quot; the study states. When interviewed with the Indiana University Newsroom, author of the CEEP report Sandi Cole said, &quot;The system needs to make sense. Don&#x27;t we want to know how much a child is progressing towards the standards? ... We need a system that values learning and growth over time, in addition to helping students reach high standards.&quot; Cole found in her survey that NCLB encourages teachers to teach to the test, limiting curriculum choices/options, and to use the special education students as a &quot;scapegoat&quot; for their school not making AYP. In addition, Indiana administrators who responded to the survey indicated that NCLB testing has led to higher numbers of students with disabilities dropping out of school.

Legal journals have also commented on the incompatibility of IDEA and NCLB; some say the acts may never be reconciled with one another. They point out that an IEP is designed specifically for individual student achievement, which gives the rights to parents to ensure that the schools are following the necessary protocols of Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). They worry that not enough emphasis is being placed on the child&#x27;s IEP with this setup. In Board of Education for Ottawa Township High School District 140 v. Spelling, two Illinois school districts and parents of disabled students challenged the legality of NCLB&#x27;s testing requirements in light of IDEA&#x27;s mandate to provide students with individualized education. Although students there were aligned with &quot;proficiency&quot; to state standards, students did not meet requirements of their IEP. Their parents feared that students were not given right to FAPE. The case questioned which better indicated progress: standardized test measures, or IEP measures? It concluded that since some students may never test on grade level, all students with disabilities should be given more options and accommodations with standardized testing than they currently receive.

==Effects on racial and ethnic minority students==

===Attention to minority populations===
* The Act seeks to narrow the class and racial achievement gap in the United States by creating common expectations for all. NCLB has shown mixed success in eliminating the racial achievement gap. Although there is evidence to support the statement that test scores are improving, studies do not find evidence that racial achievement gaps have narrowed in a significant way since the legislation was enacted.
* NCLB requires schools and districts to focus their attention on the academic achievement of traditionally under-served groups of children, such as low-income students, students with disabilities, and students of &quot;major racial and ethnic subgroups&quot;. Each state is responsible for defining major racial and ethnic subgroups itself. Many previous state-created systems of accountability measured only average school performance—so schools could be highly rated even if they had large achievement gaps between affluent and disadvantaged students.

===State refusal to produce non-English assessments===
All students who are learning English would have an automatic three-year window to take assessments in their native language, after which they must normally demonstrate proficiency on an English-language assessment. However, the local education authority may grant an exception to any individual English learner for another two years&#x27; testing in his or her native language on a case-by-case basis.

In practice, however, only 10 states choose to test any English language learners in their native language (almost entirely Spanish speakers). The vast majority of English language learners are given English language assessments.

Many schools test or assess students with limited English proficiency even when the students are exempt from NCLB-mandated reporting, because the tests may provide useful information to the teacher and school. In certain schools with large immigrant populations, this exemption comprises a majority of young students.

NCLB testing under-reports learning at non-English-language immersion schools, particularly those that immerse students in Native American languages. NCLB requires some Native American students to take standardized tests in English. In other cases, the students could be legally tested in their native language, except that the state has not paid to have the test translated.

===Demographic study of AYP failure rates and requirement for failing schools===
One study found that schools in California and Illinois that have not met Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) serve 75–85% minority students while schools meeting AYP have less than 40% minority students. Schools that do not meet AYP are required to offer their students&#x27; parents the opportunity to transfer their students to a non-failing school within the district, but it is not required that the other school accepts the student. NCLB controls the portion of federal Title I funding based upon each school meeting annual set standards. Any participating school that does not make AYP for two years must offer parents the choice to send their child to a non-failing school in the district, and after three years, must provide supplemental services, such as free tutoring or after-school assistance. After five years of not meeting AYP, the school must make dramatic changes to how the school is run, which could entail state-takeover.

==Funding==
As part of their support for NCLB, the administration and Congress backed massive increases in funding for elementary and secondary education. Total federal education funding increased from $42.2 billion in 2001 (the fiscal year before the law&#x27;s passage) up to $55.7 billion in 2004. A new $1 billion Reading First program was created, distributing funds to local schools to improve the teaching of reading, and over $100 million for its companion, Early Reading First. Numerous other formula programs received large increases as well. This was consistent with the administration&#x27;s position of funding formula programs, which distribute money to local schools for their use, and grant programs, where particular schools or groups apply directly to the federal government for funding. In total, federal funding for education increased 59.8% from 2000 to 2003.

The act created a new competitive-grant program called Reading First, funded at $1.02 billion in 2004, to help states and districts set up &quot;scientific, research-based&quot; reading programs for children in grades K–3 (with priority given to high-poverty areas). A smaller early-reading program sought to help states better prepare 3- to 5-year-olds in disadvantaged areas to read. The program&#x27;s funding was later cut drastically by Congress amid budget talks.

Funding Changes: Through an alteration in the Title I funding formula, the No Child Left Behind Act was expected to better target resources to school districts with high concentrations of poor children. The law also included provisions intended to give states and districts greater flexibility in how they spent a portion of their federal allotments.

Funding for school technology used in classrooms as part of NCLB is administered by the Enhancing Education Through Technology Program (EETT). Funding sources are used for equipment, professional development and training for educators, and updated research. EETT allocates funds by formula to states. The states, in turn, reallocate 50% of the funds to local districts by Title I formula and 50% competitively. While districts must reserve a minimum of 25% of all EETT funds for professional development, recent studies indicate that most EETT recipients use far more than 25% of their EETT funds to train teachers to use technology and integrate it into their curricula. In fact, EETT recipients committed more than $159 million in EETT funds towards professional development during the 2004–05 school year alone. Moreover, even though EETT recipients are afforded broad discretion in their use of EETT funds, surveys show that they target EETT dollars towards improving student achievement in reading and mathematics, engaging in data-driven decision making, and launching online assessment programs.

In addition, the provisions of NCLB permitted increased flexibility for state and local agencies in the use of federal education money.

The NCLB increases were companions to another massive increase in federal education funding at that time. The Bush administration and congress passed very large increases in funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) at the same time as the NCLB increases. IDEA Part B, a state formula-funding program that distributes money to local districts for the education of students with disabilities, was increased from $6.3 billion in 2001 to $10.1 billion in 2004. Because a district&#x27;s and state&#x27;s performance on NCLB measures depended on improved performance by students with disabilities, particularly, students with learning disabilities, this 60 percent increase in funding was also an important part of the overall approach to NCLB implementation.

===Criticisms of funding levels===
Some critics claim that extra expenses are not fully reimbursed by increased levels of federal NCLB funding. Others note that funding for the law increased massively following passage and that billions in funds previously allocated to particular uses could be reallocated to new uses. Even before the law&#x27;s passage, Secretary of Education Rod Paige noted ensuring that children are educated remained a state responsibility regardless of federal support:
Various early Democratic supporters of NCLB criticize its implementation, claiming it is not adequately funded by either the federal government or the states. Ted Kennedy, the legislation&#x27;s initial sponsor, once stated: &quot;The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally in place, but the funds are not.&quot; Susan B. Neuman, U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s former Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education, commented about her worries of NCLB in a meeting of the International Reading Association:
Organizations have particularly criticized the unwillingness of the federal government to &quot;fully fund&quot; the act. Noting that appropriations bills always originate in the House of Representatives, it is true that during the Bush Administration, neither the Senate nor the White House has even requested federal funding up to the authorized levels for several of the act&#x27;s main provisions. For example, President Bush requested only $13.3 billion of a possible $22.75 billion in 2006. Advocacy groups note that President Bush&#x27;s 2008 budget proposal allotted $61 billion for the Education Department, cutting funding by $1.3 billion from the year before. 44 out of 50 states would have received reductions in federal funding if the budget passed as it was. Specifically, funding for the Enhancing Education Through Technology Program (EETT) has continued to drop while the demand for technology in schools has increased (Technology and Learning, 2006). However, these claims focused on reallocated funds, as each of President Bush&#x27;s proposed budgets increased funding for major NCLB formula programs such as Title I, including his final 2009 budget proposal.

Members of Congress have viewed these authorized levels as spending caps, not spending promises. Some opponents argue that these funding shortfalls mean that schools faced with the system of escalating penalties for failing to meet testing targets are denied the resources necessary to remedy problems detected by testing. However, federal NCLB formula funding increased by billions during this period and state and local funding increased by over $100 billion from school year 2001–02 through 2006–07.

In fiscal year 2007, $75 billion in costs were shifted from NCLB, adding further stresses on state budgets. This decrease resulted in schools cutting programs that served to educate children, which subsequently impacted the ability to meet the goals of NCLB. The decrease in funding came at a time when there was an increase in expectations for school performance. To make ends meet, many schools re-allocated funds that had been intended for other purposes (e.g., arts, sports, etc.) to achieve the national educational goals set by NCLB. Congress acknowledged these funding decreases and retroactively provided the funds to cover shortfalls, but without the guarantee of permanent aid.

The number one area where funding was cut from the national budget was in Title I funding for disadvantaged students and schools.

===State education budgets===
According to the book &quot;NCLB Meets School Realities&quot;, the act was put into action during a time of fiscal crisis for most states. While states were being forced to make budget cuts, including in the area of education, they had to incur additional expenses to comply with the requirements of the NCLB Act. The funding they received from the federal government in support of NCLB was not enough to cover the added expense necessary to adhere to the new law.

==Proposals for reform==
The Joint Organizational Statement on No Child Left Behind is a proposal by more than 135 national civil rights, education, disability advocacy, civic, labor, and religious groups that have signed on to a statement calling for major changes to the federal education law. The National Center for Fair &amp; Open Testing (FairTest) initiated and chaired the meetings that produced the statement, originally released in October 2004. The statement&#x27;s central message is that &quot;the law&#x27;s emphasis needs to shift from applying sanctions for failing to raise test scores to holding states and localities accountable for making the systemic changes that improve student achievement.&quot; The number of organizations signing the statement has nearly quadrupled since it was launched in late 2004 and continues to grow. The goal is to influence Congress, and the broader public, as the law&#x27;s scheduled reauthorization approaches.

Education critic Alfie Kohn argues that the NCLB law is &quot;unredeemable&quot; and should be scrapped. He is quoted saying &quot;[I]ts main effect has been to sentence poor children to an endless regimen of test-preparation drills&quot;.

In February 2007, former Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson and Georgia Governor Roy Barnes, Co-Chairs of the Aspen Commission on No Child Left Behind, announced the release of the Commission&#x27;s final recommendations for the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act. The Commission is an independent, bipartisan effort to improve NCLB and ensure it is a more useful force in closing the achievement gap that separates disadvantaged children and their peers. After a year of hearings, analysis, and research, the Commission uncovered the successes of NCLB, as well as provisions that must be significantly changed.

The Commission&#x27;s goals are:
* Have effective teachers for all students, effective principals for all communities
* Accelerate progress and achievement gaps closed through improved accountability
* Move beyond status quo to effective school improvement and student options
* Have fair and accurate assessments of student progress
* Have high standards for every student in every state
* Ensure high schools prepare students for college and the workplace
* Drive progress through reliable, accurate data
* Encourage parental involvement and empowerment

The Forum on Educational Accountability (FEA), a working group of signers of the Joint Organizational Statement on NCLB has offered an alternative proposal. It proposes to shift NCLB from applying sanctions for failing to raise test scores to supporting state and communities and holding them accountable as they make systemic changes that improve student learning.

==Obama reforms 2010==

President Barack Obama released a blueprint for reform of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the successor to No Child Left Behind, in March 2010. Specific revisions include providing funds for states to implement a broader range of assessments to evaluate advanced academic skills, including students&#x27; abilities to conduct research, use technology, engage in scientific investigation, solve problems, and communicate effectively.

In addition, Obama proposes that the NCLB legislation lessen its stringent accountability punishments to states by focusing more on student improvement. Improvement measures would encompass assessing all children appropriately, including English language learners, minorities, and special needs students. The school system would be re-designed to consider measures beyond reading and math tests; and would promote incentives to keep students enrolled in school through graduation, rather than encouraging student drop-out to increase AYP scores.

Obama&#x27;s objectives also entail lowering the achievement gap between Black and White students and also increasing the federal budget by $3 billion to help schools meet the strict mandates of the bill. There has also been a proposal, put forward by the Obama administration, that states increase their academic standards after a dumbing down period, focus on re-classifying schools that have been labeled as failing, and develop a new evaluation process for teachers and educators.

The federal government&#x27;s gradual investment in public social provisions provides the NCLB Act a forum to deliver on its promise to improve achievement for all of its students. Education critics argue that although the legislation is marked as an improvement to the ESEA in de-segregating the quality of education in schools, it is actually harmful. The legislation has become virtually the only federal social policy meant to address wide-scale social inequities, and its policy features inevitably stigmatize both schools attended by children of the poor and children in general.

Moreover, critics further argue that the current political landscape of this country, which favors market-based solutions to social and economic problems, has eroded trust in public institutions and has undermined political support for an expansive concept of social responsibility, which subsequently results in a disinvestment in the education of the poor and privatization of American schools.

Skeptics posit that NCLB provides distinct political advantages to Democrats, whose focus on accountability offers a way for them to speak of equal opportunity and avoid being classified as the party of big government, special interests, and minority groups—a common accusation from Republicans who want to discredit what they see as the traditional Democratic agenda. Opponents posit that NCLB has inadvertently shifted the debate on education and racial inequality to traditional political alliances. Consequently, major political discord remains between those who oppose federal oversight of state and local practices and those who view NCLB in terms of civil rights and educational equality.

In the plan, the Obama Administration responds to critiques that standardized testing fails to capture higher level thinking by outlining new systems of evaluation to capture more in depth assessments on student achievement. His plan came on the heels of the announcement of the Race to the Top initiative, a $4.35 billion reform program financed by the Department of Education through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

Obama says that accurate assessments &quot;...can be used to accurately measure student growth; to better measure how states, districts, schools, principals, and teachers are educating students; to help teachers adjust and focus their teaching, and to provide better information to students and their families.&quot; He has pledged to support state governments in their efforts to improve standardized test provisions by upgrading the standards they are set to measure. To do this, the federal government gives states grants to help develop and implement assessments based on higher standards so they can more accurately measure school progress. This mirrors provisions in the Race to the Top program that require states to measure individual achievement through sophisticated data collection from kindergarten to higher education.

While Obama plans to improve the quality of standardized testing, he does not plan to eliminate the testing requirements and accountability measures produced by standardized tests. Rather, he provides additional resources and flexibility to meet new goals. Critics of Obama&#x27;s reform efforts maintain that high-stakes testing is detrimental to school success across the country, because it encourages teachers to &quot;teach to the test&quot; and places undue pressure on teachers and schools if they fail to meet benchmarks.

The re-authorization process has become somewhat of a controversy, as lawmakers and politicians continually debate about the changes that must be made to the bill to make it work best for the educational system.

In 2012, President Obama granted waivers from NCLB requirements to several states. &quot;In exchange for that flexibility, those states &#x27;have agreed to raise standards, improve accountability, and undertake essential reforms to improve teacher effectiveness,&#x27; the White House said in a statement.&quot;
== Replacement ==
On April 30, 2015, a bill was introduced to Congress to replace the No Child Left Behind Act, the Every Student Succeeds Act, which was passed by the House on December 2 and the Senate on December 9, before being signed into law by President Obama on December 10, 2015. This bill affords states more flexibility in regards to setting their own respective standards for measuring school as well as student performance. While the No Child Left Behind Act mandated labels for lower performing schools, the ESSA allows for no labels to be put on the lowest performing schools. A school&#x27;s success is also determined by 4-year and 5-year graduation rates rather than the previous 4-year determination. This further enables flexibility in standards of student performance.

<text>Janus Green B is a basic dye and vital stain used in histology. It is also used to stain mitochondria supravitally, as was introduced by Leonor Michaelis in 1900.

The indicator Janus Green B changes colour according to the amount of oxygen present. When oxygen is present, the indicator oxidizes to a blue colour. In the absence of oxygen, the indicator is reduced and changes to a pink colour.

<text>Auskerry (; , east skerry) is a small island in eastern Orkney, Scotland. It lies in the North Sea south of Stronsay and has a lighthouse, completed in 1866.

==Description==
Auskerry is a small, flat, red sandstone islet, south of Stronsay. A standing stone and mediaeval chapel are signs of early settlement. The island was uninhabited for a time after the automation of the lighthouse in the 1960s. It was previously a popular location for hunting seals.

Auskerry has been inhabited for nearly 50 years by a family (of the reporter Hamish Auskerry) who keep a flock of rare North Ronaldsay sheep. There are three small wind turbines and four solar panels on the island, which provide most of the power. After a series of expansions and renovations, the single roomed stone bothy is now a modern house with four bedrooms, kitchen, shower room and living room. The chemical toilet is outdoors due to the complication of installing septic tanks. Mail is delivered from Stronsay, once a month, by a fishing boat.

==Lighthouse==
The lighthouse lights the north entrance to the Stronsay Firth. It was built in 1866 by engineers David and Thomas Stevenson. It is attached to two flats; the lower one is used all year as a store and the top one is used mainly in summer.

The &quot;Hastings County&quot;, a 116-metre Norwegian cargo ship, ran ashore on north west of Auskerry in 1926 during thick fog. The vessel broke in half and wreckage is spread over a wide area, with the engine on the beach.

==Wildlife==
Auskerry is designated a Special Protection Area due to its importance as a nesting area for Arctic tern and European storm petrel; 4.2% of the breeding population of European storm petrels in Great Britain nest on the island. The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant breeding populations of seabirds.

<text>Faray (Old Norse: &quot;Færey&quot;) is a small island in Orkney, Scotland, lying between Eday and Westray. Previously inhabited, the low-lying island is now a successful grey seal breeding colony.

==Geography==
Faray and Holm of Faray are formed of a ridge of Old Red Sandstone which extends southwards from Weather Ness at the southern tip of the island of Westray and almost connects Westray to Eday. The two islands are separated by the Lavey Sound.

==History==
Faray was known as Pharay (or North Pharay to distinguish it from South Pharay, now called Fara). Both names are derived from the Old Norse &#x27;faerey&#x27;, &quot;sheep island&quot;.

The only man-made relic of note is a chambered cairn beside Lavey Sound. Faray had a population of eighty-two in 1861, falling to fifty-eight by 1891. By the late 1930s there were eight families living on the island. They had crofts and supplemented their income by lobster fishing. World War II led to many departures. By 1947 the last islander had left Faray and, apart from occasional summer occupation, the island was deserted. A road still runs up the central spine of the island serving the scattered empty houses.
In December 1908 the &quot;Hope&quot;, a fishing vessel from Peterhead, ran aground on the Holm of Faray during a storm. The &#x27;Five Men of Faray&#x27; braved the storm to row across the Lavey Sound and rescue the crew stranded on the rocks. They were rewarded with a trip to the Scottish mainland to meet Edward VII at Balmoral, where they each received a medal, together with &quot;a good pipe and some tobacco&quot;.

==Conservation==
The island is now populated by sheep, seabirds, and grey seals. Faray and neighbouring Holm of Faray are designated a Special Area of Conservation for a well-established grey seal (&quot;Halichoerus grypus&quot;) breeding colony. The islands support the second-largest breeding colony in the UK, contributing around 9% of the annual UK pup production.

<doc id="512863" wikidata="Q1149158" url="?curid=512863" title="Microbody">
<text>A microbody (or cytosome) is a type of organelle that is found in the cells of plants, protozoa, and animals. Organelles in the microbody family include peroxisomes, glyoxysomes, glycosomes and hydrogenosomes. In vertebrates, microbodies are especially prevalent in the liver and kidney. Many membrane bound vesicles called microbodies that contain various enzymes, are present in both plant and animal cells

==Structure==

Microbodies are different type of bodies present in the cytosol, also known as cytosomes. A microbody is usually a vesicle with a spherical shape, ranging from 0.2-1.5 micrometers in diameter. Microbodies are found in the cytoplasm of a cell, but they are only visible with the use of an electron microscope. They are surrounded by a single phospholipid bilayer membrane and they contain a matrix of intracellular material including enzymes and other proteins, but they do not seem to contain any genetic material to allow them to self-replicate.

==Function==

Microbodies contain enzymes that participate in the preparatory or intermediate stages of biochemical reactions within the cell. This facilitates the breakdown of fats, alcohols and amino acids. Generally microbodies are involved in detoxification of peroxides and in photo respiration in plants. Different types of microbodies have different functions:

===Peroxisomes===
A peroxisome is a type of microbody that functions to help the body break down large molecules and detoxify hazardous substances. It contains enzymes like oxidase, react hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct of its enzymatic reactions. Within the peroxisome, hydrogen peroxide can then be converted to water by enzymes like catalase and peroxidase. Discovered and named by Christian de Duve. 

===Glyoxysomes===
Glyoxysomes are specialized peroxisomes found in plants and mold, which help to convert stored lipids into carbohydrates so they can be used for plant growth. In glyoxysomes the fatty acids are hydrolyzed to acetyl-CoA by peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes. Besides peroxisomal functions, glyoxysomes also possess the key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle.

== History ==

Microbodies were first discovered and named in 1954 by Rhodin. Two years later in 1956, Rouiller and Bernhard presented the first worldwide accepted images of microbodies in liver cells. Then in 1965, Christian de Duve and coworkers isolated microbodies from the liver of a rat. De Duve also believed that the name microbody was too general and chose the name of peroxisome because of its relationship with hydrogen peroxide. In 1967, Breidenbach and Beevers were the first to isolate microbodies from plants, which they named glyoxysomes because they were found to contain enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle.

<text>James Wilson (6 February 1836 – 6 November 1921) or Séamas Mac Liammóir&quot;,&quot; was an Irish Fenian and soldier of India. In 1867 he was transported as a convict to Western Australia and later escaped during the Catalpa rescue.

==Biography ==
Born James McNally in Newry, County Down, Ireland on 6 February 1836. He joined the British Army at the age of 17 (enlisting under a false name) to avoid arrest for the battery of a police officer.

He served in India before returning to Ireland where he became a Fenian, being sworn into the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1864. The following year he deserted, along with Martin Hogan, from the British Army in anticipation of an expected Fenian uprising.

On 10 February 1866, he was arrested by the police who discovered him hiding in a safe house in Dublin. They had been betrayed by an informant, Patrick Curran.
Wilson, along with other military Fenians was tried, found guilty of desertion and mutinous conduct, and sentenced to death. However, this sentence was later commuted to penal servitude for life, and they were transported to Western Australia. In October 1867, Wilson and sixty one other Fenians began the long sea voyage on board the &quot;Hougoumont&quot;. 

Life in Fremantle was hard. Wilson had been sentenced to penal servitude, and found the monotony and work involved so hard that he wrote to a New York City journalist, John Devoy entitling his letter, &quot;A Voice From the Tomb&quot;.

Devoy was moved enough by Wilson&#x27;s description of the conditions under which he and his colleagues laboured to begin collecting money from the American-Irish community to organise their rescue. When enough money had been collected and a whaling ship, the &quot;Catalpa&quot;, had been purchased, George Anthony was hired to captain the ship.

In 1876, the &quot;Catalpa&quot; sailed to Western Australia and rescued Wilson and five other Fenian prisoners. Initially two British ships sought to stop the progress of the &quot;Catalpa&quot; and recapture the men, but after receiving a warning shot, Anthony raised the American flag. After this, the two ships did not fire upon them again and the ship sailed unimpeded to New York, the journey taking some four months.

Wilson settled in Rhode Island, where he married and lived out the rest of his life. In 1920, Wilson met Éamon de Valera who was touring the United States, trying to gain support for his Irish Republic. Wilson died on 6 November 1921; his remains are buried in the cemetery on the grounds of St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

<text>Clinoclase is a hydrous copper arsenate mineral, Cu3AsO4(OH)3. Clinoclase is a rare secondary copper mineral and forms acicular crystals in the fractured weathered zone above copper sulfide deposits. It occurs in vitreous, translucent dark blue to dark greenish blue colored crystals and botryoidal masses. The crystal system is monoclinic 2/m. It has a hardness of 2.5–3 and a relative density of 4.3. Associated minerals include malachite, olivenite, quartz, limonite, adamite, azurite, and brochantite among others.

Clinoclase was discovered in 1830 in the county of Cornwall in England. Found at Broken Hill New South Wales, Australia and associated with copper ore deposits in Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah in the United States. Also found in France, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Romania, Russia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Abichite is another name for clinoclase.

The type locality for clinoclase is the Wheal Gorland mine at St Day, Cornwall in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="512878" wikidata="Q13586511" url="?curid=512878" title="Dealer's choice">
<text>Dealer&#x27;s choice is a style of poker where each player may deal a different variant. As the deal passes clockwise around the table, each player occupying the dealer position chooses a variant which is either played just for the current hand or for an entire orbit. It is a common choice for home games, where the tone of the game is usually more recreational than competitive. It is also rarely played online, due to the complexities involved in creating the appropriate algorithms that would allow the format of poker to change during each hand, or orbit.

Dealer&#x27;s choice games often break from the typical forms of poker through the use of wild cards and kill cards in addition to variations on betting structure. The majority of the dealer&#x27;s choice poker games were derived from children&#x27;s games.

Depending on house rules, dealers may also call card games that are not true poker variants, such as Acey Deucey, Screw Your Neighbor, and Guts.

There are two different approaches to a standard DC game:

* Per hand: In this type of format the player on the button (known as the dealer) selects the format of poker to play for that hand only. After the hand is over the dealer button moves to the left and the next player in that position chooses the next format of poker that will be played.
* Per orbit: In this type of format the player on the button (known as the dealer) selects the format of poker to play for the next orbit, which is an entire revolution of the table. So, for example, if the game was being played at a nine-handed table then an orbit would last nine hands.

== Poker variants ==
The varieties of poker wholly depend on the level of knowledge and understanding on the table that you are playing. In home games, players will agree in advance the types of games that can be chosen, and then they are selected at random by each player.

In casino games, the games are normally shown on a rolodex, and players can either choose a game from the rolodex, or it is spun in order for the choice of game to be entirely random.

The most popular form of poker in the world (No Limit Texas hold&#x27;em) is rarely played in Dealer&#x27;s Choice. There are many reasons for this, but the most common is the fact that people play Dealer&#x27;s Choice to get away from the regularity of playing No Limit Hold&#x27;em. That being said, it is a game that many beginners will choose to play if they are unfamiliar with the other mixed games.

<text>Bodil Malmsten (19 August 1944 – 5 February 2016) was a Swedish poet and novelist.

Malmsten was born in Bjärme, Östersund Municipality. Due to her parents&#x27; early separation, she grew up at her maternal grandparents and at foster care in Vällingby, Stockholm. Her paternal grandfather was designer and architect Carl Malmsten. She debuted as author in 1970 together with Peter Csihas (1945–2011) with their children&#x27;s book &quot;Ludvig åker&quot;. Csihas and Malmsten had a relationship during the 1960s and 70s and have a daughter, Stefania, born 1967, who is designer and actor.

The English translation of her novel, &quot;Priset på vatten i Finistère&quot; (&quot;The Price of Water in Finistère&quot;, translated by Frank Perry), was selected as a &quot;Book of the Week&quot; on BBC Radio 4. In the novel, having decided to pack up and leave her country of birth, she recounts the story her settling into her new home in the Finistère &quot;département&quot;, in Brittany. It is told in a series of vignettes about gardening, learning the language, dealing with French bureaucracy, and struggling with writer&#x27;s block.

She was awarded a doctorate &quot;honoris causa ad gradum&quot; (honorary degree) by the Faculty of Human Sciences at the Mid-Sweden University in Östersund in 2006.

Malmsten died of cancer at her home in Stockholm on 5 February 2016, aged 71.

<doc id="512886" wikidata="Q1248389" url="?curid=512886" title="Police corruption">
<text>Police corruption is a form of police misconduct in which law enforcement officers end up breaking their political contract and abusing their power for personal gain. This type of corruption may involve one or a group of officers. Internal police corruption is a challenge to public trust, cohesion of departmental policies, human rights and legal violations involving serious consequences. Police corruption can take many forms, such as: bribery, theft, sexual assault, and discrimination.
==Types==
Soliciting or accepting bribes in exchange for not reporting organized drug or prostitution rings or other illegal activities and violations of law, county and city ordinances and state and federal laws. 
Bribes may also include leasing unlawful access to proprietary law enforcement databases and systems.

Flouting the police code of conduct in order to secure convictions of civilians and suspects—for example, through the use of falsified evidence. There are also situations where law enforcement officers may deliberately and systematically participate in organized crime themselves.

Selective enforcement

In most major cities there are internal affairs sections to investigate suspected police corruption or misconduct, including selective enforcement, but there are situations where Internal Affairs also hides departmental and individual corruption, fraud, abuse and waste by individual officers, groups of officers or even unwritten departmental policies. There are also Police Commissions who are complicit in the same cover-ups, often to hide internal and departmental problems, both from public view, and also from inter-departmental reviews and investigations. Certain officers can be fired, then rehired by petition after they accrue enough signatures, often from the very criminals and violators from whom corrupt officers have garnered previous favors in exchange for officers &quot;turning a blind eye&quot;, resulting in selective enforcement of violations being deterred, but actually promoted.

Similar entities include the British Independent Police Complaints Commission. Police corruption is a significant widespread problem in many departments and agencies worldwide.

It is not possible to measure the level of corruption in a country. Surveys of police officers, citizens and businesses can be used to provide estimates on levels of corruption. These are often inaccurate, as respondents involved in corruption are reluctant to provide any information implicating themselves in criminal activity. Despite this limitation, information collected from International Crime Victim Surveys and surveys conducted by the Global Corruption Enumerated Barometer can be used to estimate the level of police corruption.

==Corrupt acts==

Police officers have several opportunities to gain personally from their status and authority as law enforcement officers. The Knapp Commission, which investigated corruption in the New York City Police Department in the early 1970s, divided corrupt officers into two types: &quot;meat-eaters&quot;, who &quot;aggressively misuse their police powers for personal gain&quot;, and &quot;grass-eaters&quot;, who &quot;simply accept the payoffs that the happenstances of police work throw their way.&quot;

There are multiple typologies of police corruption that have been asserted by academics. However, common corrupt acts that have been committed by police officers can be classified as follows:
*Death in custody: Murder of an accused or convicted person in custody by way of a beating. Corrections Officers who engage in this behavior are known as a “beat up squad.” Officers disabling Bodycams (visual, sound, or both) are often involved.
*Corruption of authority: When police officers receive free drinks, meals, and other gratuities, because they are police officers, whether intentionally or unintentionally, they convey an image of corruption.
*Extortion/bribery: Demanding or receiving payment for criminal offenses, to overlook a crime or a possible future crime. Types of bribery are protection for illegal activities, ticket fixing, altering testimony, destroying evidence, and selling criminal information. Bribery is one of the most common acts of corruption. 
*Theft and burglary is when an officer or department steals from a suspect, victim or corpse. Examples are taking drugs for personal use in a drug bust, and taking personal objects from a corpse at the scene of a crime. A theft can also occur within a department. An officer can steal property from the department&#x27;s evidence room or property room for personal use.
*Shakedowns: When a police officer is aware of a crime and the violator but accepts a bribe for not arresting the violator (Roebuck &amp; Barker, 1973).
*&quot;Fixing&quot;: Undermining criminal prosecutions by withholding evidence or failing to appear at judicial hearings, for bribery or as a personal favor.
*Perjury: Lying to protect other officers or oneself in a court of law or a department investigation.
*Internal payoffs: Prerogatives and prerequisites of law enforcement organizations, such as shifts and holidays, being bought and sold.
* Overtime Fraud: Obtaining large sums of overtime without being at work.
*The &quot;frameup&quot;: The planting or adding to evidence, especially in drug cases.
*Ticket fixing: Police officers cancelling traffic tickets as a favor to the friends and family of other police officers.

==Behavior==

Corrupted behavior can be caused by the behavioral change of the officer within the police &quot;subculture&quot;. A subculture is a group of individuals within a culture that share the same attitudes and beliefs. Police officers within the department share the same norms and that new behavioral development can be attributed through psychological, sociological, and anthropological paradigms.
* Psychological paradigm: The psychological paradigm suggests that behavior is based and structured through an individual&#x27;s early stages of life. Those attracted to the police occupation tend to be more &quot;authoritarian&quot;. The authoritarian personality is characterized by conservative, aggressive, cynical, and rigid behaviors. Corruption may involve profit or another type of material benefit gained illegally as a consequence of the officer&#x27;s authority. Psychological corruption can be a part of a department&#x27;s culture or from the certain individual.
* Sociological paradigm: The sociological paradigm focuses on individual exposure to a police training academy, regular in-service training, and field experience all shape occupational character. Police learn how to behave, discretion, morals and what to think from their shared experiences with other police officers. New recruits develop definitions with their peers either positive or negative. These definitions are then reinforced, positively or negatively, by the rewards or punishments (either real or perceived) that follow their behavior. For example, a new recruit may be given an order by his peer to arrest an individual sitting in the passenger seat for a DUI. This action can end up negatively or positively for the officer depending on how the situation is perceived by the court later on.
* Anthropological paradigm: When an individual&#x27;s social character is changed when an officer becomes part of the occupational culture. The term culture is often used to describe differences among large social groups where they share unique beliefs, morals, customs, and other characteristics that set them apart from other groups. Within the police culture, officers learn to be suspicious of the public. Police culture can also be quite racist, and shot through with assumptions about the criminal tendencies of certain minority groups, such as African Americans, or the competency of fellow officers from minority backgrounds, which can lead officers to make corrupted choices for personal benefits or gains.

==Prevalence==
Accurate information about the prevalence of police corruption is hard to come by, since the corrupt activities tend to happen in secret and police organizations have little incentive to publish information about corruption. Police officials and researchers alike have argued that in some countries, large-scale corruption involving the police not only exists but can even become institutionalized. One study of corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department (focusing particularly on the Rampart scandal) proposed that certain forms of police corruption may be the norm, rather than the exception, in American policing. In the UK, an internal investigation in 2002 into the largest police force, the Metropolitan Police, Operation Tiberius found that the force was so corrupt that &quot;organized criminals were able to infiltrate Scotland Yard &quot;at will&quot; by bribing corrupt officers ... and that Britain&#x27;s biggest force experienced &#x27;endemic corruption&#x27; at the time&quot;.

Where corruption exists, the widespread existence of a Blue Code of Silence among the police can prevent the corruption from coming to light. Officers in these situations commonly fail to report corrupt behavior or provide false testimony to outside investigators to cover up criminal activity by their fellow officers. The well-known case of Frank Serpico, a police officer who spoke out about pervasive corruption in the New York City Police Department despite the open hostility of other members, illustrates how powerful the code of silence can be. In Australia in 1994, by 46 votes to 45, independent politician John Hatton forced the New South Wales state government to override the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the advice of senior police to establish a ground-breaking Royal Commission into Police Corruption However, in a number of countries, such as China, Pakistan, Malaysia, Russia, Ukraine, Brazil or Mexico, police corruption remains to be one of the largest social problems facing their countries.

====China====
In mainland China, the collusion between corrupt police officers and gang bosses is a major concern, bringing legitimacy issues to the police as well as the ruling party. Since the 1990s, China&#x27;s anti-corruption campaigns have focused on serious organized crime and corrupt government officials who act as &#x27;protective umbrella&#x27; (protectors) for local gangsters. Criminal organizations who are not able seek protection from local police officers are very likely to be destroyed during China&#x27;s anti-crime campaigns, while criminal groups under police protection are able to survive and control illegal businesses (e.g. gambling, prostitution and drugs) in their territories.

==== Belgium ====
Belgium&#x27;s levels of corruption in police and business matters are considered to be low. A 2012 ranking specifically on police corruption rated Belgium 16 out of 176. The 2013 Special Eurobarometer stated that 67% percent of Belgium&#x27;s population felt general corruption, not just police-related, was widespread, compared to the EU average of 76%.

Respondents to the Global Corruption Barometer in 2014 stated that, on a scale of 1-5 (5 being extremely corrupt), police corruption was at 3.2. 11% of respondents felt police corruption had increased since 2011, 51% felt it had decreased. 61% of respondents felt the government&#x27;s response to police corruption was ineffective.

Two independent organizations deal with police corruption: the General Inspectorate of the Police (AIG) and the Committee P. There are also 196 internal control units within local police forces to deal with minor incidents and police misconduct in conjunction with the AIG and Committee P. In 2011, out of 1,045 investigations by the AIG, 6 were specifically corruption-based, with higher numbers of breaching professional confidence (44) or fraud (26), but lower (3) of abuse of police power. To maintain impartiality, the AIG has completely separate servers to the police, but draws on a number of databases for its investigations, as well as working together with the Committee P. The Committee P generally deals with the most important corruption cases, such as those relating to organized crime or torture. Belgium also has other institutions which deal with corruption, including police-related cases, on a wider scale: the Standing Police Monitoring Committee, and the Central Office for the Repression of Corruption (OCRC).

===== Case of Marc Dutroux =====
In 2004, the high-profile case of Belgian serial killer and child molester Marc Dutroux resulted in outrage in the community amidst allegations of police corruption and incompetence. Dutroux was meant to be under police surveillance the night he kidnapped two of his victims, but the police had programmed the camera to operate only during the day. The police failed to locate two living victims being held captive during a search of Dutroux&#x27;s home in 1995. A locksmith who was accompanying the police during the search said he heard children&#x27;s cries, but was dismissed by the police. The police claimed that they did not view seized videotapes of Dutroux constructing his &quot;dungeon&quot; as at the time they had no VCR. Dutroux claimed he was part of a sex ring that involved high-ranking members of Belgian police and government. The widespread anger over the continued failings of the police and Dutroux&#x27;s sex-ring allegations, as well as residing judge Jean-Marc Connerott&#x27;s dismissal, led to the &quot;White March&quot; in 1996, demanding reforms to Belgian police and judicial systems. Connerotte testified that the investigation was deliberately hampered by officials. Dutroux also escaped from police custody in 1998 before being apprehended. A parliamentary commission into the Dutroux case in 1998 found that the defendant benefited from police corruption and incompetence. Although police were cleared of direct compliance in Dutroux&#x27;s crimes, the report cited major gross negligence throughout Belgium&#x27;s police system, and an overhaul was called for. The case severely damaged the Belgian community&#x27;s trust in their police and law enforcement systems.

===== Case of Stefan P =====
In 2006, a Flemish, i.e. Dutch-speaking, Belgian police officer was sentenced to six months in jail for attempting to extort the equivalent of £160,000 from the parents of a missing woman in 2004, telling them they would be more likely to see their daughter again if they acquiesced. He confessed, but after serving his sentence successfully appealed his sacking from the police as the sacking had been done by a French-speaking officer. Belgium has laws in place to uphold the &quot;rights&quot; of the speakers of each language, including that of a police officer who is being disciplined to undergo questioning in their own language. The former officer was working on a compensation claim and calling for reinstatement as of 2012.

====Bulgaria====
Data from the 2011 Eurobarometer research places Bulgaria fourth in the European Union (EU) in terms of bribes paid to public officials. The main factor behind this ranking is bribes paid to police officers. According to the same research, Bulgaria sits first on the list of EU member states with widespread police corruption.

While much of the duties of safeguarding - largely through oppression - the communist rule in Bulgaria was undertaken by the Ministry of Interior (MoI), after 1989 its make-up changed dramatically. From 1990 to 1993, almost one quarter of the MoI&#x27;s staff were dismissed - between 12,000 and 19,000 police officers, 60-90% of which were officers at the medium and senior levels. Additionally, a role in the political conflicts of the 1990s led to further dismissals of national and regional police detectives and mass layoffs of middle ranking officers. Simultaneously, Bulgaria was undergoing a transition from the Soviet Communist regime to democracy, leading to a sharp increase in crime and criminal incidents (up to ten times in growth for some crimes), coupled with a severe economic downturn and the emergence of a large number of criminal groups. The effects of these drastic changes to the MoI and dramatic upheaval of Bulgaria&#x27;s political landscape culminated with the financial and economic crisis of 1996–97, during which police corruption rose on almost all levels.

Before these changes, during the period of 1944–1989, abuses within the MoI were investigated by the State Security - an almost exact replica of the Soviet KGB - who had total control of law enforcement. This was achieved by monitoring the political loyalty of MoI staff, but also by exceptional powers to investigate abuses; including the use of undercover agents and virtually unlimited powers to investigate. However, the considerable experience accumulated over these years was lost immediately after the democratic change in 1989, when the body was disbanded.

After Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007, the country was seriously challenged to eliminate instances of police corruption. As a result of this, the deputy-chief of a police service was dismissed over accusations of illicit contact with an alcohol producer, and police misconduct has been limited by institutional and legal changes.

However, Bulgaria continues to experience everyday police corruption, and the Bulgarian people continue to hold negative views of the nation&#x27;s police force. Corruption and conflicts of interest continue to offer a serious challenge to public perceptions of the Bulgarian police, attitudes that are not only encouraged by political scandals and frequent media coverage of police corruption, but also by the personal experiences of everyday Bulgarians. In 2013, 65% of respondents to Transparency International&#x27;s Global Corruption Barometer thought that the police were either corrupt, or extremely corrupt. However, comparing this to 86% who felt the same of the judiciary and 71% for the parliament/legislator, shows that Bulgarians are regaining trust in their police force, or at the very least, have more trust in them than other public officials who have some effect on their legal protection.

=====Bribery=====
In 2011, Eurobarometer research that asked respondents to report whether or not they have been pressured to pay bribes to the police ranked Bulgaria first in the EU, with 7% of respondents claiming that they had been. Within this research, it was found that 450,000 Bulgarians annually were asked for bribes by police, a number that did not change substantially between 2009 and 2011. According to the same research, 70% of Bulgarians believe that bribe-taking is widespread in the police force.

This perception was not aided by the arrest of seventeen traffic police officers on 27 September 2011 for charges of corruption and operating in organised crime groups. According to Sofia City Prosecutor Nikolai Kokinov, these officers were pooling the bribes they received at the end of their shifts and dividing the money between them, sometimes taking up to 500 liva a shift. According to Kokinov, police do not receive large bribes, but instead are given small ones regularly.

These arrests have not affected instances of bribing the police. Transparency International&#x27;s 2013 Global Corruption Barometer recorded 17% of respondents claiming that they paid a bribe to the police.

=====Challenges to Bulgarian Corruption=====
Bulgaria begun undergoing political stabilisation in the late 1990s/early 2000s, after which attempts were made to fill the watchdog and counter-corruption enforcement agency hole left by the State Security. A telephone hotline and internet site was open for the submission of complaints to be used by the MoI Inspectorate. The Inspectorate was also given controlling, preventive and disciplinary functions by the Ministry of Interior Act. It is split into two divisions: &quot;control of management&quot; and &quot;countering corruption in the Ministry of Interior&quot;. The 35 officers of the Inspectorate have a number of functions, ranging from assessing corruption risks, undertaking inspections aimed at reducing and preventing corruption, reviewing complaints received about the MoI and supervising the implementation of inspections. They report directly to the Minister of Interior.

In 2008, Bulgaria also introduced a new intelligence and counter-intelligence agency, the State Agency for National Security (SANS). It is directly subordinated to the Prime Minister and exists outside the MoI, which gives the agency a degree of independence if it is tasked with investigating corruption within the MoI, particularly regarding corruption among senior officers and management. However, SANS is purely intelligence-gathering, and has no police powers.

As a result of these two initiatives, 74 disciplinary sanctions were imposed against members of the Bulgarian police. Of these 74, six cases were referred to the prosecution, and the MoI was advised to dismiss officers accused to misconduct in a further seven of them.

2008 also saw the establishment of the Internal Security Directorate (ISD) of the MoI, the first service since 1990 that has multiple officers around the country, as well as the ability to combine covert methods with police powers. This means that for the first time since the dissolution of the State Security, a branch of the MoI had the ability to use surveillance techniques to expose police corruption, including a network of undercover agents, as well as take proactive measures - on the basis of risk analysis - to end corruption, actively seeking and collecting evidence on MoI staff without complaints being submitted, something that neither SANS nor the Inspectorate can do. In 2011, data from the ISD indicated that 1,200 complaints were followed up on that year, leading to around 300 infringements being substantiated and 100-120 officers were dismissed or indicted. This large upswing is due to the organisational changes undertaken in the MoI, which no longer allow complaints to remain within the division they were made, but instead must be referred to the ISD or the Inspectorate.

Further changes were undertaken to reduce police corruption in 2014, with all MoI cars being equipped with GPS systems, and then video cameras and microphones being fitted to all traffic police patrol cars that record what passes between traffic police and drivers. As part of this initiative, rules were changed that allowed an MoI vehicles to carry out roadside checks of motorists. As of 25 November, these checks have only been allowed to be undertaken by traffic police. Bulgarian Interior Minister Vesselin Vuchkov claimed these new measures were expected to cut corruption by 80% by reducing direct contact between police and motorists, and thus lowering the opportunity for police to receive bribes and participate in corruption.

==== Croatia ====
In 2002, accepting bribes was a common form of street police corruption in Croatia. According to the International Victim Crimes Survey, 15 out of 100 respondents reported paying a bribe within the last year – 44% of which were paid to police officers. This frequency was higher than most other East-European countries, with respondents suggesting that police in Croatia were targeted more frequently for successful bribes compared to other countries in East-Europe. These results indicated that police corruption, especially in regards to the acceptance of a bribe by a police officer, seemed to be more prevalent among Croatian police than among police in other East-European countries.

===== Controlling =====
Prosecution of corruption is based on the 1997 Criminal Code. Article 337 of the code states that &quot;a public official who abuses the office, oversteps the limits of official authority, or fails to perform the official duty with the aim of obtaining pecuniary gain or other non-pecuniary benefit could be charged criminally&quot;. As well as this, section 347 of the code prohibits the acceptance of a bribe by any public official, explicitly listing police officers. These two sections provide grounds for the prosecution of police for several forms of police corruption.

In order to establish a successful corruption-control system in Croatia it is essential that police be held responsible for corruption. There must be a legally sound basis for the punishment of corrupt police officers and legal tools to achieve this punishment. Section 337 and 347 makes this achievable, as do the sanctions listed in the Criminal Code. As well as this, these norms of not accepting police corruption should be enforced. That is, police officers must be held responsible for their actions and sanctions should be exercised.

==== Cyprus ====
Police corruption in Cyprus is unofficially monitored by the Independent Authority for the Investigation of Allegations and Complaints Against the Police. In 2013, the Authority heard a total of 145 complaints against the police by the public, from 132 complaints in 2012. However, there is no official, government-mandated authority to combat and monitor corruption, nor an official government anti-corruption strategy. Corruption within the Cyprus Police should be handled internally, as per the Cyprus Code of Police Ethics.

Corrupt activities among the police are typically defined as using a position of power to influence particular decisions, such as nepotism, the giving and taking of bribes, accessing information that is not directly related to an officer&#x27;s current work or investigation(s), and lower levels of organised crime are also commonly noted in cases of police corruption.

A Eurobarometer Report by the European Commission in 2009 indicated that the grand majority of Cypriots (94%) believe that corruption is widespread in the police and the wider public affairs sector at national, regional, and local levels. A follow-up survey in 2012 indicated that 97% of Cypriots believed that corruption was a major issue for the country.

The 2009 report also showed that 89% of Cypriots believed that corruption was widespread within the Cyprian Police Service involving bribes and the abuse of positions of power (nepotism), compared to an average of 39% of European Union citizens believing corruption is widespread among their own police services or institution. Additionally, 80% of Cyprian respondents to the Eurobarometer 2009 Report agreed that corruption is unavoidable within the public, police, and government sectors, whereas only 14% disagreed with the statement.

The 2013 Eurobarometer Report on Corruption indicated that the top three reasons for corruption occurring in Cyprus are; &quot;because politicians and government are not doing enough to fight corruption (88%), the lack of real punishment (87%), and the lack of meritocracy (87%)&quot;. Oddly, 65% of Cypriots have reported to have a strong level of confidence in the police in an unofficial 2013 survey comparing trust in the police across 50 countries. However, this disparity may be influenced by the continually changing perceptions of respondents based on recent experiences, or the political climate. Due to Cyprus&#x27; geographical composition as an island, corruption can spread across several networks, as high-ranking locals across several disciplines such as politics, law enforcement, judicial officials, and businessmen interact closely within the same social circles; whereas these relationships may be significantly diffused across larger mainland countries.

Transparency International (TI) has recommended that a Coordinating Body Against Corruption should be established under the Cyprian Attorney General, which is able to combat and enact strategic policies against corruption in the public and law enforcement sectors. Specifically, TI has recommended that an increase in police salaries, a reinforcement of the ethical code, and improved working conditions should be implemented to discourage the risk of accepting bribes to increase officers&#x27; own income. Additionally, a greater transparency in the disclosure of assets, or second jobs to supplement income, should be incorporated into the duties of high-ranking law enforcement officials, so that future conflicts of interest can be made aware of and monitored.

====Czech Republic====
Police corruption in the Czech republic can be perceived in two categories: petty everyday corruption (e.g. bribery and favouritism), and major economic corruption, involving foreign investments requiring both state support and subsidy decision-making.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tchequie / Czech Republic&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Within these areas sections 158 – 162 detail forms of corruption ranging from abuse of power by a public official, to indirect bribery.
The Czech Republic joined the EU in May 2004, following the splitting of Czechoslovakia in 1993. Since this split, corruption has made a steady incline. In 2001, 163 individuals were prosecuted with corrupt activity, of those 142 in relation to bribery. This in comparison to the 110 individuals prosecuted in 2000. In 1995 the number of ascertained crimes committed by officers with involvement in management and administration was calculated at 1,081, by 1999 this figure had jumped 10.1% to 5,081, which steadily declined into the 2000s.
Royalties gained through major economic corruption are largely conspicuous. Tied up in ostentatious villas, over budget public construction projects and local government offices^. These &quot;landmarks&quot; are prominent enough to prompt guided tours around Prague. Curious tourists are directed between structures funded through large sums of taxpayers&#x27; money. Money ending up in the pockets of civil servants and corrupt businessmen.

In 1991 the &quot;Service for the Protection of Economic Interests&quot; was set up, this later evolved into the &quot;Unit for Combating Corruption and Serious Economic Crime of the Criminal Police and Investigation Service&quot; in January 2002. Its function: to detect connections between corruption and organised crime, in cooperation with the &quot;Criminal Police Service and Investigation Unit of the Czech Police for Revealing Organised Crime&quot;. 
Similarly the &quot;Inspection Department of the Ministry of the Interior&quot; (IDMI), a police unit that deals with offences committed by police officers. This unit targets petty everyday corruption, involving low-level employees of the state who abuse their power for personal gain. 
Policemen earn a fraction the salary of a military officer. Where the Fire Brigade has 14 districts within the Czech Republic, the Police force only has 8, resulting in limited opportunity for climbing regional ranks. Policemen must also undergo far lengthier training than their better-paid Army and Fire Brigade colleagues. Such inequities prompt feelings of resentment among Police ranks.
As a result, systems are now in place to combat petty corruption. Including automated cameras at traffic lights sending infringements directly to a driver, avoiding any physical interaction with a policing officer.
At the same time, &quot;The Unit for Combating Corruption and Financial Crime&quot; (UOKFK), established by the Ministry of the Interior, also provides continuing education relating to domestic corruption and integrity of the Czech police force.
Police Corruption in the Czech Republic is an ongoing issue, however one that is actively combatted through state and local action.

====Denmark====
When asked specifically about public perceptions of police corruption, a rating of 2 was given (with 1 being least corrupt and 5 being most), which was lower than the perceived corruption in any other sector surveyed, other than education which also was rated a 2.

Danish police have a respectable reputation of not being associated with corruption and the public have great trust in the Danish police force. Although corruption is a rarity amongst Danish Police, there are effective procedures in place for the investigation and punishment of any police corruption. The Danish Independent Police Complaint Authority was formed to handle any allegations (corruption or other matters) made against the police force. The Police Complaints Authority council and chief executive deliberate and make decisions, based upon complaints of police misconduct, independently of police and prosecutors. To ensure transparency, the council consists of two members of the general public, as well as the chair, who is a High Court Judge, an attorney, and a professor of jurisprudence. This council is reappointed every four years. Outlined in a very clear and simple document, is a guide of how complaints can be made by oneself, a bystander or on behalf of another. The document explains how lodging a complaint is free of charge and can be made in writing online or in person, or over the telephone, within six months of the relevant incident.

In 2012, the Police Complaints Authority received 655 complaints, with most cases involving accusations of general misconduct such as traffic violations (e.g., speeding without activated police lights), excessive use of force during arrests, foul language, or illegitimate access to the police database (officers are only allowed to check the database in police cases they are directly involved in), whereas accusations of corruption were very rare. There were concerns surrounding the difficulty with the investigation of a number of the general misconduct incidents due to problems with identifying the involved officers. This resulted in the suggestion of police officers wearing identity numbers on their uniforms. Uniform numbers were introduced in 2016.

====Ecuador====
====Estonia====
Estonia&#x27;s experiences of corruption in general, and more specifically, corruption in the police force are low in comparison to the European Union&#x27;s average. While there are no specific anti-corruption agency or body which deals with corruption in Estonia, the Security Police Board and Police Board are in charge of investigating and regulating any instances of police corruption. The Security Police, established in 1993, is an impartial board within the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Their main aims are to gather intelligence, counter-terrorism, and enact anti-corruption measures. This board comprises four regional departments who mainly deal with corruption surrounding &quot;higher officials&quot;. The majority of their force have received higher education with &quot;specialised training in corruption investigations&quot;. Their primary purpose is to investigate instances of corruption crime, committed only by public servants. The achievements of this board, thus far, have been solving cases in significant white-collar crime and corruption in border and customs guard. 
In regards to the Estonian Police, in particular, while all police officers have to go through some initial anti-corruption training there are no yearly requirements they must fulfill in terms of continued training.

The general police are governed by the Police Board who have an Internal Control Division who are responsible for the investigation of misconduct and corruption. The Police board is in control of investigating smaller instances of corruption, as well as those cases concerning civic officials. These anti-corruption strategies and boards fall under multiple Anti-Corruption Strategies which have been implemented by the Ministry of Justice. The most recent of these strategies is the &#x27;Anti-Corruption Strategy 2013-2020&#x27;. The strategy crosses many private and public areas and sectors of Estonia. The aim of the strategy is to both raise awareness and educate the population of corruption and corruption-willingness. Within the guidelines of this strategy all decisions, regulations and policies implemented by the different ministries and boards must abide by the rule of transparency, whereby the public must be informed of what is occurring, how much it will cost and why. In the report for this strategy it is acknowledged there is a higher risk of corruption for those working in law enforcement agencies. Therefore, the Ministry of Justice pays close attention to these areas and have set about implementing strict measures and bodies to govern all law enforcement agencies. While the anti-corruption strategy has greatly assisted in decreasing levels of corruption in the general police force, the rate of corruption in the Border and Custom Guard Agency is still fairly high.

Due to Estonia&#x27;s position on the border of the European Union (EU) their Border and Customs Guards come in contact with a great deal of organised crime and immigrants wanting to cross the Eastern border of Estonia into the EU. The result being many officials in this agency see the opportunity to increase their wealth through corruption and in turn accept bribes to let immigrants into Estonia and the EU. These type of corrupt officials pose a serious threat to both national security and the security of the EU when they let in illegal immigrants, in particular those involved in organised crime. In the Permanent Mission of Estonia, the Estonian Government states the aim of all anti-corruption strategies set up in their country is to ensure their population is allowed full enjoyment of their human rights. Through the long-term anti-corruption strategies, the Estonian Government aims to rid their country of any sort of corruption which could infringe on people&#x27;s rights or pose a threat to national or international security.

====Finland====
Finland has been found to consistently be one of the world&#x27;s least corrupt nations. In 2012, the Corruption Perceptions Index rated the Finns as the world&#x27;s least corrupt country (tie with Denmark and New Zealand). However, they fell to third in 2013 and remained there the following year, losing only one point on the table in that time. The Finns believe that this is due to heavily ingrained societal values that are shared amongst the population, as well as there being adequate wages and low disparities of income for the majority of the country. The latter reduces the propensity to accept bribes and checks economic greed.

In terms of police corruption, regular surveys of the public are taken in order to gauge perceptions of transparency in law enforcement officials. The 2007 Police Barometer survey found that one in four Finns think that it is very likely that corruption exists in some form within the police. Further, one in six Finns think that the police might act in an unethical manner towards foreigners by misusing information or mistreating detainees. The survey also found that trust in police remains high, but whilst the public consider that law enforcement officers generally conduct themselves well in interactions with clients and citizens, the standard has deteriorated somewhat. This could be due to the high expectations Finns carry of the police, but it certainly shows that the public are of a high opinion of the transparency afforded them in the department of law enforcement.

More recent surveys show significant changes in the figures, however. In 2012, when Finland was at the top of the Corruption Perceptions Index, 27% of Finns believed that it was very likely that corruption existed in some form within the police. This figure is not dissimilar from the 2007 Police Barometer survey, yet the figure in the 2014 survey jumps to 42% of Finns. This is most likely due to the high-profile case of Jari Aarnio, the former chief investigator and head of Helsinki&#x27;s anti-drugs police, who spent 30 years in the anti-drugs force in Finland, but which was later revealed to be a drug lord himself. The story on Aarnio broke in September 2013, and in June 2015 the former head of the Helsinki drug squad was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment for aggravated abuse of office from 2009 to 2010 and for taking bribes from a private company. Prosecutors asked for a 13-year sentence during hearings.

====France====
France is a member of the Council of Europe which has many legal frameworks against corruption in place including GRECO (Group of States Against Corruption) which applies for all Council of Europe signatories. GRECO works by equally monitoring rights and obligations of the Council of Europe&#x27;s Member States. Police are bound by the Recommendations on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials and Criminal Law Convention on Corruption. In addition, France has its own Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen approved in August 1789 which outlines the rights of civilians inclusive of conduct applicable to public officials for fair treatment. In 1993, The Central Service for the Prevention of Corruption was also established in France to prevent corruption and transparency of economical life and public procedures. There are a number of bodies that monitor and investigate police corruption in France. The Inspection Générale de la Gendarmerie Nationale enables consistency, independency and impartiality of inspections carried out by the Gendarmerie Nationale.

Inspection Générale de la Police monitors and regulates police behaviour and the Commission Nationale de Deontologie de la Securite (CNDS) monitors ethical and moral codes required to be upheld by security forces in France. Other strategies such as disabling officers to be on duty in their originating neighborhood and prohibiting officers from working in private investigation for three years after leaving the police force are enforced to ensure impartiality.

There are limited studies or reports on police corruption within France because the issue is generally avoided by official institutions and no institution has a comprehensive understanding of its prevalence. This may be due to a lack of attention from media and other social science areas. It is a common assumption that police corruption in France is a rare occurrence in the area of organised crime. One explanation for institutional corruption in France is the hierarchical police system. This is due to higher rankings and specialised units having more discretion and being at higher risk of corruption.

Areas that have a heavy presence of organised crime, such as Marseille, are known to experience higher levels of police corruption.

=====Marseille=====
In 2012, twelve French police officers were apprehended after an internal complaint was lodged into suspected corruption within the elite anti-crime squad, also known as the Brigade Anti-Criminalite (BAC) that operates within the Marseille north. This region is known for high drug activity. Despite attention being brought to the head of Centrale Directorate of National Security, Pascal Ladalle, a full-scale judicial enquire was not undertaken until the new police chief of Marseille was appointed. A total of 30 officers from the squad have been suspended for allegedly seizing drugs, money, cigarettes and jewellery from dealers and letting them go. The seized narcotics, money and valuables were all found in a makeshift ceiling at their station after a few months of investigation and surveillance. Investigations are still pending.

=====François Stuber=====
François Stuber was a police captain and Deputy Head of the Drug Squad in Strasbourg, France. One of Stuber&#x27;s duties was to destroy drugs seized from operations; however between 2003 and 2007, the officer instead traded narcotics including marijuana, heroin and cocaine to an established drug network. In addition to this, Stuber also imported drugs from various other networks. The former captain had an intimate relationship with a worker from the local court, Laurence Hamon, where they would use court information to ensure his drug network associates were not under investigation. This method was also employed to avoid tracing mechanisms imposed by the Inspection Generale de la Police Nationale to detect any abuse of information. Stuber worked closely with Laurence, using her residence to store the seized drugs and her banking accounts to launder money. Stuber was jailed for the maximum term of 10 years.

====Germany====

In 2020 in the German city of Essen, in North Rhine-Westphalia, the homes of 30 racist Nazi police officers were raided by their colleagues brought together from several different German states. The Nazi cops shared images like swastikas, a depiction of refugees in a gas chamber, and Reich flags.

The substantial legislation covering corruption offences within the German Criminal Code is indicative of the importance placed on combating this type of crime in Germany. In general, corruption is construed as an individual offence, although it is possible to be prosecuted for actions committed on behalf of a corporation under the Administrative Offences Act.

Alongside civil servants, judges and other public officials undertaking or appointed a public administrative role, police officers may be held liable for criminal prosecution for corruption-related offences under Sections 331-338 of the German Criminal Code. Specifically, according to Section 331, a public official who requires, allows themselves to be promised, or accepts an advantage for themselves or a third party for the discharge of their duty is liable to criminal prosecution.

An advantage involves any type of benefit that may improve the individual&#x27;s financial, legal or personal standing, which they are not legally entitled to receive. Although there is no statutory minimum to what can be interpreted as an unlawful benefit, minor customary advantages that are unlikely to impact the perception or decision making process of the individual are not considered criminal.

Additionally, pursuant to Section 332 of the German Criminal Code, the past or future undertakings of an official act (e.g. lobbying of certain laws, services regulations, etc.) that violate official duties are considered unlawful. Penalties for this offence, as well as bribery in a public office in general, can range from fines to imprisonment, where the sanctions apply to each count of bribery, with a maximum sentence of 10 years for serious cases.

In addition to legislation, strategic approaches which target all German government bodies, including the police, are employed through the Federal Government Directive concerning the Prevention of Corruption in the Federal Administration. This directive recommends internal auditing, employment of a contact person for corruption related-issues rotation of staff and the principle of multiple controls in order to prevent and combat corruption within governmental bodies.

Beyond the domestic level, Germany is heavily involved in the creation and compliance to international anti-corruption standards via the United Nations, the World Bank, the Group of Eight (G8) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). German public institutions, such as the police, have also been acknowledged by the Council of Europe&#x27;s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) to have done considerable work to prevent corruption.

Public perception of police corruption is low among German citizens according to the 2013 Special Eurobarometer on Corruption report. German respondents (16%) were among the least likely (within European Union) to think that corruption, or the giving and taking of bribes and abuse of power for personal gain, is widespread among police and customs officers. More generally, 92% of German respondents do not feel personally affected by corruption in their daily lives, considerably higher than the 70% EU average. However, although more than half (59%) of respondents believe that corruption is prevalent within Germany, this is still considerably lower than the 76% EU average.

Despite the more than half of German respondents perceiving a prevalence of corruption in German society, the actual experience of corruption is quite low. Less than 1% of German respondents reported they were requested or expected to pay a bribe in the year of the report, while only 9% indicated they were personally aware of someone who had accepted bribes, respectively below the 4% and 12% average among European Union citizens.

==== Greece ====
Today, Greece experiences some of the highest levels of police corruption in Europe, with 99% of its citizens believing that corruption in the country is widespread.

Transparency International surveys show that Greece ranks high among European Union nations in terms of perceptions of corruption. From 2013 to 2016, during the height of the Greece&#x27;s debt crisis, the annual Transparency International reports showed that Greeks ranked second-most corrupt among EU countries, behind only Bulgaria. (the country&#x27;s relative position among European countries was more favorable before and after this period).

Bribing police officers is common in Greece. Citizens may offer the police monetary sums as a way of avoiding getting a ticket or in order to obtain a drivers license. 96% of Greek citizens believe that this is an acceptable practice and 93% believe that it is the easiest way of obtaining public services. The Hellenic Police Internal Affairs Unit has investigated cases of corruption among police, including police acceptance of bribes from traffickers. Human trafficking has become a more prominent issue in the realm of police bribery in recent times. Particularly as the state is an optimum destination for those seeking asylum, due to its many small islands and borders being difficult to patrol. It is not unusual for Greek police to provide fake documentation and plane tickets to illegal immigrants. A trafficker&#x27;s circuit was discovered in the Santorini police department as recently as June 2015. It was reported that airline employees contacted the local police, concerned about passengers who may be travelling to European countries using forged documents. However, the police performed only rudimentary checks, and permitted the migrants to board the flights. According to the US Department of State 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report, police also recently dismantled a sex trafficking ring involving two police officers, who were then suspended from duty.

Greece is a member of the European Partners Against Corruption (EPAC). It is housed in Greece within the Hellenic Police Internal Affairs division, established in 1999 and has 120 staff. The National Strategic Reference Framework has also put forth €340,000 to fund &quot;transparency and anti-corruption for good governance in public administration-police&quot; seminars. The program will be made available to graduates of the Police Officers Academy of Greece. However, only 14% of Greeks believe that the government&#x27;s efforts to combat corruption are effective. Furthermore, unlike other member states, the amount of corruption in Greece has increased rather than decreased, with its global ranking falling from 80th in 2011 to 94th in 2012. This is likely because of the states financial difficulties. Data collected by the Greek anti-corruption task-force in 2012 showed that corruption in the state had spiked, with 1,060 cases investigated – a 33% increase on 2011. Moreover, 710 (or 66.9%) of these were concerned with police officers.

==== Hungary ====
Hungarian criminologist Geza Finszter has named Hungary a fundamentally dishonest society. Due to this, real justice is nearly impossible to achieve. Government operations are not transparent. This leads to corruption which is reflected in many aspects of its society, including politicians, judges, and the police force. Police force corruption affects the criminal investigators who, have a greater amount of exposure to corruption than others. They are paid poorly, allowing well endowed criminals to corrupt them. This corruption in the lower level of the police is not the biggest problem when it comes to police corruption in Hungary.

In the National police Organised Crime Division, high-ranking officers, with possible underworld ties can choose to proceed or halt sensitive operations. In short if an investigation runs the risk of exposing political or other types of corruption they tend to more often than not be shut down without much delay. According to Transparency International, many state run institutions in Hungary are directed by government loyalists allowing for an easy spread of corruption. It was also found that when it came to reporting corruption in Hungary, 70% of the population would not report instances of corruption due to a mistrust of authorities and a fear of the consequences for doing so. Transparency International claims that the government discourages its citizens when it comes to reporting corruption as no adequate protection measures have been implemented to help whistle blowers.

Due to Hungary&#x27;s geographical position that is bordering the former Yugoslavia and, its political history it has become a major crossroads for the transportation of narcotics between Asia and Western Europe. According to the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report 2007, Hungarian border control and narcotics police seem to be tackling and resisting corruption to an extent. The report showed that education of border police was making some difference when it came to the issue of corruption. Contrary to this however it would appear when it comes to prosecuting high-profile cases involving organised crime, including drug trafficking, sentences tend to be lenient. It would appear that corruption is systematic and prevalent through the entirety of the Hungarian Criminal Justice system reaching as high as Judges and, not just its police force. After being ranked in the bottom third of countries when it comes to corruption, and when looking at the ineffectiveness of the new anti corruption laws that have been put in place it is all too clear that corruption seems to be an accepted practice in Hungary&#x27;s police force at least for the foreseeable future.

==== Indonesia ====

==== Italy ====
Italy ranks at the same level or below eastern European countries in the Corruption Perception rating.
The Italian Police Force is difficult to monitor in terms of corruption due to its decentralised nature. There are four different branches of the Italian policing system, broken up into the Carabinieri, the State Police, the Local Police and the Guardia di Finanza. Due to the delegation of responsibilities between the branches it is the case that monitoring all of them with one centralised and independent body becomes extremely logistical and difficult. The Guardia di Finanza is charged with the responsibility of regulating all financial dealings, within and outside of Italy. It can be seen, therefore, that this branch of the national police force may need the most attention and regulation, due to their constant dealings with money.

==== Kazakhstan ====
Kazakhstan ranks below many countries in the Corruption Perception Index. Official statistics of corruption charges within the police show 203 in 2014, 307 in 2017, and 165 in 2019. These campaign-style zigzagging trends are still minuscule considering the scale of police bribe-taking in Kazakhstan. The International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS) reported that in a one-year period (June 2017–May 2018), 5.2% of Kazakhstanis were victims of official bribe-seeking and in almost half of these cases the bribe-seeker was a police officer. Taking only the adult population of Kazakhstan into account, the ICVS police bribery figures suggest around 400,000 incidents of police bribery every year in Kazakhstan. These calculations are most likely very conservative in that they only capture when a bribe has been solicited and exclude instances of citizen-initiated bribery.

==== Latvia ====
Police corruption in Latvia is more prevalent than it is in other EU states. According to Transparency International, Latvia has a Corruption Perception Index score of 4.9 out of ten, indicating a high level of perceived corruption. Particularly concerning is that the judiciary and police received high scores (out of five) for public perceptions of corruption, being 3.2 and 3.3 respectively. Political parties and the legislature received scores of 4 and 3.7.

Police and customs have been identified as corruption hotspots in Latvia, with a majority (58%) of Latvians regarding it as widespread. In particular, road police has one of the lowest ratings for perceived honesty and integrity and is considered more corrupt than any other government institution. This stems from the common practice of demanding bribes, for example at traffic stops. In these situations a person has little option other than to pay the bribe (and thus avoid a fine or more severe penalty). The motivations for corruption are not entirely clear. Public officials point to low salaries, which may explain a significant proportion of bribery incidents. However, other public institutions, such as the postal service, have significantly lower salaries than police or customs, yet much lower rates of bribery and corruption. Since 2000, highway police are not allowed to levy on-the-spot fines, which is likely to reduce the incidence of bribery in that context.

Latvia began developing an anti-corruption policy in 1995, culminating in the Corruption Preventing and Combatting Bureau (KNAB – Korupcijas novēršanas un apkarošanas birojs) in 2002. KNAB is a multi-purpose anti-corruption body whose functions include investigating corruption offences, controlling activities of public officials and education and training on corruption risk. This is the most common example of a single-body approach to anti-corruption policy, with similar bodies existing in Hong Kong (on which KNAB is based) and Australia. KNAB operates as a pre-trial investigation body, with authority to refer matters to the public prosecutor. It has a broad jurisdiction, though most of its cases involve bribery offences. In 2001, a high-profile corruption case emerged when the then Deputy Chief of the Economic Police was arrested for receiving a bribe in an attempt to prevent the investigation of a smuggling and tax evasion case.

Latvia is a relatively new Member state of the European Union, having only joined in 2004. A recent survey found that people in new member state countries, especially Latvia, agree that bribery is the easiest way of obtaining certain public services than those in the original EU states. In 1998, a survey posed the following question to Latvian households: &quot;A system whereby people could anonymously report instances of corruption would not be successful because corruption is a natural part of our lives and helps solve many problems&quot;. Only 37% of respondents disagreed with the statement. Additionally, Latvia has one of the lowest reporting rates for corruption in the EU, and most Latvians do not believe the government&#x27;s anti-corruption efforts are likely to be successful.

==== Lithuania ====

Police corruption in Lithuania was considered to be prevalent in a 2002 study by OSI, a liberal NGO funded by the controversial billionaire George Soros. Corruption is considered to be a widespread issue in Lithuanian society in general, occurring during interactions in both the private and public sectors. Two thirds of people in Lithuania prosecuted for corruption related offences between 1995 and 1998 were police officers. In 2002 the Lithuanian Police Department admitted that they were aware of the high levels of corruption within the force. Despite this, some progress to combat police corruption in Lithuania has been made by 2002.

The Police Department of the Ministry of Interior is the national police agency of Lithuania. The Criminal Police Bureau and the Public Police Bureau are additional, separate agencies. The Criminal Police Bureau consists of various departments, including, but not limited to, the Organised Crime Investigation Services. The Public Police Bureau also has numerous departments, including, but not limited to, the Preventive Service and Traffic Control Service. The Traffic Control Service is considered to be one of the most corrupt criminal justice bodies in Lithuania.

Prior to 2002, Traffic Control officers used to be empowered to issue on the spot fines far greater than their own salaries. As such, a common form of police corruption was known to occur where members of the public bribe traffic officers to avoid receiving expensive fines. This particular power was one explanation to the high levels of police corruption specific to the Traffic Control Service. By 2002 the police force had put into place measures to prevent such corruption, including disciplinary measures that in extreme cases can lead to dismissal from service.

Lithuanian government&#x27;s stance against police corruption is evident through its creation of anti-corruption bodies as well as its introduction of various legislative measures. In the opinion of the BBC, targeting police corruption in Lithuania was connected to the country&#x27;s accession to the European Union in May 2004. Application and entrance to the EU saw Lithuania introduce numerous anti-corruption measures.

Lithuania&#x27;s anti-corruption system is considered compliant to the UN Convention against Corruption to which it signed in 2003 and ratified in 2006.
Compliance is met through Lithuania&#x27;s anti-corruption legal framework as well as the Special Investigation Service that is considered an independent anti-corruption law enforcement body.

The Special Investigative Services (SIS) is an independent national Lithuanian anti corruption body formed in 1997. In 2008 SIS was rated second, after the media, as the most effective anti corruption measure in Lithuania (by whom?). 
Previously SIS was a subordinate of the Ministry of Interior however in 2000 it became an independent agency. The SIS&#x27; responsibilities range from solving and preventing corruption, to developing Lithuania&#x27;s anti corruption strategy. Any member of the public can report potential cases of corruption to SIS.

Established in 1998, the Internal Investigation Service (IIS) is an internal police department that performs legal monitoring and is tasked with enforcing disciplinary sanctions when necessary. The IIS can investigate the actions of individual officers. The IIS reports to one of the Deputy Commissioner Generals and has the ability to investigate cases of police corruption.

As well as the Internal Investigation Service, the Immunity Service is responsible for preventing and investigating corruption within the Lithuanian police force. The Immunity Service reports to the Commissioner General of the Police.

Despite these measures, the issue of police corruption in Lithuania continues to be prevalent. The Special Eurobarometer 397 report on corruption found that 63% of Lithuanian respondents believed corruption within the police or customs to be widespread. Lithuania&#x27;s levels of police force corruption can be deemed particularly high when compared to other European Union states. The police force was considered to be the most trusted of all institutions in the majority of European Union member states; however, Lithuania was one of three exemptions to this (along with Latvia and Croatia).

The success of Lithuania&#x27;s anti-corruption methods has been difficult to measure. This was a main criticism made in a 2014 report by the European Commission measuring Lithuania&#x27;s implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Whilst Lithuania has put appropriate anti-corruption measures in place, the success of such measures is difficult to measure due to limited disclosure of statistics and further limited public release as to how such anti corruption institutions work in practice.

To form a balanced view of corruption in Lithuania, more comparative data would be required focusing on the Lithuanian SSR, the interwar Republic of Lithuania, Lithuania in the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Lithuania. Corruption perception might or might mot not be a valid measure of corruption, for example, underestimating corruption in countries (such as France, Germany, Italy or the United Kingdom) which have considerably less press freedom (as exemplified by the World Press Freedom Index).

====Luxembourg====
Luxembourg is fundamentally a transparent, and incorrupt country. This reflects within the actions of their public service personnel, including their police force. The European Union&#x27;s 2014 Anti Corruption report placed Luxembourg, along with Denmark and Finland, as having the lowest experiences of bribery in the European Union. Luxembourg was ranked in a 2013 report as being the 11th (out of 177) best country in regards to their perceived level of corruption existing in their public sectors. A perception survey published in 2013 suggested that 94% of respondents had not witnessed corruption in that past year and 92% of respondents did not feel that they had been affected by corruption in everyday life.

The results of these reports and perception surveys suggest that whilst there is instances of corruption within Luxembourg, the country&#x27;s assessment by the European Union suggests that mechanisms exist to combat these instances and promote ethical behaviour on the part of public officials. Whilst Luxembourg lacks a specific anti corruption strategy, soft law instruments such as the quasi-legal instruments of organisations like the European Union, inform judicial bodies and government officials when prosecuting. In recent years, their Anti Corruption framework has had a particular focus on efficient control of public institutions such as police and government bodies to avoid anti corrupt behaviours in these sectors. Criminal law was last amended in 2011 to accommodate anti-corruption legislation, although the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) recommended in August 2014 that more reform needed to implemented to modify their criminal policy framework (due to gaps in legislation regarding foreign bribery offences). Positively, an inter-ministerial committee, the Corruption Prevention Committee, was established in 2007 and meets annually, which shows a conscious effort on behalf of the country to keep anti corruption mechanisms on the forefront. A hotline has also been established which is run by Transparency International in Luxembourg. This hotline is an avenue for members of the public to submit claims of corruption and is a useful anti corruption mechanism employed by Luxembourg.

==== Malta ====
The Malta Police Force (MPF) is the main law enforcement authority in Malta. It is the responsibility of the MPF to &quot;preserve public order and peace, to prevent, detect and investigate offences, to collect evidence&quot;, and to ultimately bring the offenders before the court. Further, the MPF obtains the duty of maintaining efforts in investigating the abuse of police power and undertakings of corrupt activity.

Unfortunately, for the Maltese community, it is common practice that there is a &quot;code of silence&quot; within the MPF, where an officer may &quot;turn a blind eye&quot; to the misconduct performed by their fellow officer. Typically, this behaviour is customary regardless of the severity of the consequence, as it heightens the likelihood of the corrupt officer reciprocating assistance, trust and support when needed.

Whilst over one-third of Maltese citizens believe that the MPF engage in police corruption, particularly acts of bribery and abuse of their legitimate power, this figure has significantly reduced from 2014. A nation’s corruption level can be determined through the &quot;Corruption Perception Index&quot; (CPI). The CPI ranks countries on how corrupt their public sector is perceived by the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. Malta&#x27;s CIP is 5.7 out of ten, which indicates Malta is 54% better than the average. This achievement can be seen as an outcome of the Maltese Government initiating various preventive bodies and relevant legislation.

The &quot;Economic Crime Unit of the Malta Police Force&quot; was initiated in 1987, and is primarily involved in investigating and detecting a variety of corruption offences, including smuggling, fraud and bribery. The MPF and the Police Commissioner initiate all prosecutions in Malta. Thus, to ensure legitimacy across all prosecutions, the MPF are required to adhere to disciplinary rules and are bound by a Code of Ethics. Additionally, chapter 164 of the &quot;Maltese Police Act&quot; 1961 regulates the organisation, discipline and duties of the Malta Police Force. Specifically, section 7 of Article 33 Offences Against Discipline, provides a comprehensive list of activities undertaken by a member of the MPF that are considered to be &quot;corrupt practices&quot;. Such &quot;corrupt practices&quot; include, but are not limited to: receiving any bribe; failing to promptly return any money or property received; improperly using their position as a police officer for &quot;private advantage&quot;; or, directly or indirectly requesting or receiving any gratuity without the consent of the Commissioner.

As corrupt practices are considered to be a serious punitive offence within Malta, if a member of the public submits a complaint regarding a minor corruption practice of a police officer, the &quot;Internal Affairs Unit&quot; will investigate. Alternatively, where allegations regard serious police corruption offences, the &quot;Economic Crime Unit&quot; will intervene, investigate and may consequently initiate criminal proceedings. However, from 1998, there have been few cases of police officers charged with corruption offences, consisting of five bribery prosecutions and six unlawful arrest cases.

To further ensure societal security from police corruption, the &quot;Permanent Commission Against Corruption&quot; (PCAC) was established in 1988. The PCAC entirely deals with investigations for alleged or suspected police corruption practices. The PCAC comprises one chairman, and two members who are selected by the Malta President and act on advice of the Prime Minister. Article 4 of Chapter 326 &quot;Permanent Commission Against Corruption Act&quot; 1988 highlights the functions of the commission, these include: considering and investigating alleged or suspected corrupt practices; investigating &quot;the conduct of any public officer&quot;; investigating &quot;any person who is/has been entrusted with functions relating to the administration of a partnership where the Government has a controlling interest&quot; and the Commission believes such conduct may be corrupt; investigating &quot;practices and procedures of government departments where the Government has a controlling interest to facilitate the discovery of any corrupt practices&quot;; and, to &quot;instruct, advise and assist ministers who are entrusted with the administration of government departments where the government has a controlling interest on ways in which corrupt practices could be eliminated&quot;. Reports of the commission&#x27;s findings are then submitted to the Minister of Justice.

==== Poland ====

===== History =====
During the mid 1990s, widespread police corruption in Poznan became heavily publicized in newspaper reports, which lead to an investigation by central authorities. Poland&#x27;s police chief and his deputy offered to resign after being implicated in the newspaper reports. The investigation and the deputy minister of internal affairs at the time stated that there were breaches of duties by police and it was found there were certain discrepancies in police operations. However, the deputy vouched that there was no actual evidence of corruption. Nevertheless, the public remained distrustful of Poland&#x27;s institutions and towards the end of 1997, the minister of internal affairs and administration admitted that corruption was still a pervasive issue in the police force. Additionally, there are reports that Poland&#x27;s traffic police engaged in bribery during the 1990s.

=====Present=====
Transparency International is a global non-governmental organisation that provides oversight of corruption in the corporate and political sphere and publishes comprehensive reports annually. It tracks public opinion on corruption with the Global Corruption Barometer while the Corruption Perceptions Index derives its rankings of perceived levels of corruption from both public opinion surveys and expert assessments. Despite Poland being marked at a moderate level, it greatly falls behind its European counterparts such as Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway who are all consistently in the top 10 countries with the lowest perceived levels of corruption. As of 2014, Poland currently holds a ranking of 35 out of 175 countries, marking an almost decade long improvement in both score and ranking in the Index. The steady improvement can be attributed to the Poland&#x27;s efforts to combat corruption over the last decade with the establishment of the Central Anticorruption Bureau (CBA) in 2006, their participation in the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention in 2000 and the subsequent slow adoption of anti-corruption policies.

However, over the last decade or so, there have been limited reports on Polish police corruption, which indicates that it is possibly underreported, as corruption is difficult to detect and measure due to its deceptive, hidden nature. Additionally, there is currently no specific legislation to protect whistleblowers. The CBA has training courses, which encourage officers to identify corruption but there is a fear of retribution given the lack of legal protection. Furthermore, it is evident from reports and surveys that the population of Poland and the European Commission are still concerned with the issue of corruption throughout Poland&#x27;s public institutions, including the police department. It is noted that Poland has made considerable progress towards the eradication of corruption, however, there is a compelling need to increase these efforts and implement necessary reforms.

=====The Central Anticorruption Bureau=====
The CBA specialises in the investigation of public officials and legal entities suspected of misconduct and fraudulent behaviour but do not wield the ability to prosecute defendants. Therefore, in order to be effective, the CBA exchanges information or evidence to the public prosecutors who possess executive powers. Moreover, this division of the Polish government has a responsibility that extends from the detection of corruption to crime prevention. In order to reduce the occurrence of corruption, the CBA conducts preventive and educational activities with the assistance of non-governmental organisations and financial support from the European Union. The efforts to remove corruption have pushed Poland to increase international cooperation as global networking can result in the pooling and exchange of resources and knowledge. The Bureau currently has obtained permission from Poland&#x27;s Prime Minister to cooperate with 50 other countries and 11 international organisations to tackle corruption on both a national and global scale.

The CBA continues to pursue its anti-corruption goal with its latest project, &quot;Rising of the Anticorruption Training System&quot;, whereby over the course of three years from 2013 – 2015, the CBA has been working closely with specialised law enforcements of Lithuania and Latvia. The project also consists of international anti-corruption training conferences whereby notable countries such as Norway and Denmark are able to share their high standard practices with Poland. Additionally, the project has also taken advantage of technology by launching an e-learning platform that is equipped with anti-corruption education tools and online activities. The online platform is a training course designed to educate the general public and Polish working in both the government and business sectors. The key objective of this online platform is to provide an easily accessible set of educational tools that increases public awareness of corruption and informs the necessary steps to assist with its prevention and detection.

=====European Commission anti-corruption report=====
The European Commission provides a report on the level of corruption in each Member State and details the strengths and weaknesses of their anti-corruption policies. In the 2014 report on Poland, the European Commission has acknowledged Poland&#x27;s efforts but criticizes Poland&#x27;s successive governments for not appropriately prioritising the fight against corruption. For instance, Poland has had difficulty establishing anti-corruption policies with its last one having expired in 2009. It was only after a few years of domestic and international pressure did the Polish government conduct consultations on a draft 2014-2019 Programme.
Similar to the CPI, the European Commission conducts perception surveys and in 2013 found that 82% of Polish respondents believe corruption is prevalent in Poland and that 15% of Polish respondents have encountered bribery over the past 12 months.

The European Commission also has some reservations over the CBA, suggesting that the CBA may be negatively influenced by politics due to its strong political ties with powerful government officials including the Prime Minister. The European Commission report has suggested that safeguards against politicization of the CBA should be strengthened with transparent and impartial recruitment processes. In addition, the report suggests that Poland needs to enact a long-term strategy against corruption to ensure successive governments remain committed to anti-corruption efforts

=====National Integrity System Assessment=====
Transparency International and the Institute of Public Affairs publishes the National Integrity System Assessment (NIS) for each country listing whereby it evaluates the capabilities of the country&#x27;s key institutions to hinder the prevalence of corruption. According to the 2012 assessment, Transparency International notes that Poland has achieved a fairly satisfactory outcome and that corruption is not as problematic as it was during the mid 1990s after the collapse of Communism. Additionally, Poland&#x27;s joining of the European Union in 2004 has placed expectations on Poland to improve the integrity of their political and corporate affairs. During 2002–2005, Poland is noted for implementing legal changes that extends punishment of corruption in Poland&#x27;s Criminal Code. However, the assessment highlights that corruption in Poland is still a concern and must be addressed. The assessment asserts that a key component of Poland&#x27;s relatively slow and small improvements in dealing with corruption is the lack of commitment from Poland&#x27;s decision makers as there have been several unsuccessful attempts to launch a comprehensive anti-corruption policy. NIS suggests that nepotism and cronyism is still prevalent in the political and corporate sphere, which provides a tolerant setting for corruption. The assessment also takes into consideration Poland&#x27;s Corruption Perception Index, highlighting that the public&#x27;s distrust of public entities and the difficulty to establish effective anti-corruption policies has discouraged Poland&#x27;s decision makers to improve public relations.

==== Portugal ====
Portugal is recognized within the area of police corruption for its somewhat unsuccessful attempts in combating the ever-increasing images of corruption within governance and policing, through legislation. Though the ability for police services to protect individuals from crime is high and the mechanisms set in place to combat police corruption are extensive, citizens confidence in police integrity is very low.

In accordance with Portugal&#x27;s Criminal Code, the Unlawful Receiving of an Advantage can result in imprisonment for 3–5 years. Delving further, the Criminal Code also stipulates that Passive Corruption (conducted through an intermediary) and Active Corruption (conducted directly) can receive 1–8 years imprisonment. Though there are minimal cases of police corruption occurring with this added legislation, Portuguese citizen&#x27;s views on police corruption are in conflict, and the implementation of such administration appears non-existent.

Coming under the global microscope in 2007 for their efforts in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, the Portuguese police force were heavily criticised and compared for their responses and actions after the abduction. In light of this, Portugal&#x27;s policing system was opened up to international critique, and many shortfalls were found in its governance and follow through of crime and criminal activity. Explanations for this inability to follow through and effectively punish offenders are varied, with heavy correlations built between trust within legal and political institutions. By the mid-1990s, moralisation within parliamentary procedures became highly controversial with voters remaining tolerant of unethical behaviour during a lack of response shown by parties to their electorate. This build in transparency and lack of trust run alongside Portuguese citizen&#x27;s understanding of government as well as the current police force.

The 2012 Transparency International report found that Portugal ranked 33rd in the list of nations facing high levels of corruption within its borders. Looking at national surveys, police corruption was seen as a part of everyday life, with Portuguese citizens accosted with daily reports of scandals in government, crimes that go unpunished, and obstacles within everyday investigations. Further survey&#x27;s conducted amongst citizens found a general consensus in which 75% of individuals agreed that governmental efforts to combat corruption are ineffective, and maintained a below average trust of police officials.

In comparison to fellow nations within the European Union, Portugal has also seen a recent spike in social unrest surrounding the inability to trust police, with figures showing individuals believing police to be corrupt to have spiked. Larger bodies such as the UN and GRECO have placed recommendations to adapt the Criminal Code and develop a more detailed understanding of the responsibilities of policing officials in order to combat this. In accordance, the Portuguese Parliament has enacted a law as of 22 April 2015, where specifications were made on the corruption of international trade, sports activity, and bribery, with special attention to the protection of whistle-blowers in corruption related matters. The implementation of this into everyday Portuguese life however, is yet to be seen.

====Romania====
Over the past century Romania has experienced political instability, including dictatorships, Soviet government control, and monarchies. It is a constitutional democracy. Instability often leads to corruption, and historically, a clear link has existed between countries with government corruption and countries with police corruption. Romania is no exception.

According to Transparency International, 87% of people feel that from 2007 to 2010 the level of corruption in Romania increased after joining the EU in 2007, and 83% feel that their government&#x27;s efforts to fight corruption are ineffective. On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being not at all corrupt and 5 being extremely corrupt), Romanians rated both their political parties and their parliament and legislature as 4.5, and their police 3.9. This is relatively high for the European Union especially compared to countries such as Denmark who scored 2.8 for political parties, 2.3 for parliament and legislature and only a 2 for police. Another alarming statistic is that 28% of people in Romania reported paying a bribe in 2010.

There are two main Anti-Corruption Bodies in Romania; the National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA) and the National Integrity Agency (NIA). The former was created for &quot;discovering, investigating and indicting high and medium level corruption cases&quot; whilst the latter aims to &quot;ensure the performance of public dignities and positions in conditions of impartiality, integrity and transparency&quot;. Since 2011 the NIA has also been a member of the European Partners against Corruption (EPAC) who are, among their many roles, the authorities responsible for corruption in regard to the national police.

Anti-fraud organizations have experienced fraud. In February 2015, the DNA prosecutors detained Ionut Vartic, the head of the Suceava Fight against Fraud Department (DLAF) for having used confidential information for private interests. Then, in March 2015, Horia Georgescu, director of Romania&#x27;s NIA, was arrested on corruption charges. This news followed only days after Darius Valcov, the Romanian finance minister resigned after being accused of accepting £1.4 million in bribes when he was a town mayor. Both maintain their innocence but the cases do nothing to help Romania&#x27;s reputation as &quot;one of the EU&#x27;s most corrupt states&quot;.

Yet Romania desires to gain admission into Europe&#x27;s passport-free Schengen zone and thus is at least appearing to make an effort to reduce local and political crime and corruption. Romania is under enormous pressure from the European Commission to deal with their &quot;graft culture&quot; at the risk of losing EU aid funds. Official data revealed in the year of 2009 alone, six magistrates, 22 police officers and five fiscal inspectors had been convicted of bribery on the grounds of having received bribes of between 100 and 45,000 euros. While most civilians denounce the government for the current state of police immorality in Romania, those from above blame the police forces for deliberately failing to produce evidence in court that would allow successful prosecution of corrupt businessmen and politicians.

In February 2015, Monica Iacob Ridzi, Romania&#x27;s former sports and youth minister, was sentenced to five years in prison for abusing her position, overspending public money, illegally contracting private companies for goods and services and of trying to delete allegedly incriminating e-mails.

Adam Clark, a journalist for the World Post, claims that Romania is &quot;violently using its police forces against its own people&quot;. Given the state of corruption in Romania&#x27;s government and anti-fraud agencies this is not surprising. This statement is supported by Jennifer Baker from Revolution News who reported on the violence used by riot police to suppress anti-corruption protestors in Bucharest following the passing of legislation that immunized the political class from corruption charges, criminalized critical speech, and criminalized demonstrations against government persecution. She states that protestors were accusing the police of protecting thieves. Furthermore, she reported that people living in villages where Chevron (an American multinational energy corporation) is searching for shale gas &quot;were beaten in their houses&quot; by riot police and were &quot;arrested at random&quot;

==== Slovakia ====
According to corruption watchdog Transparency International, Slovakia is the 17th most corrupt state within Europe and the 59 (out of 178) most corrupt state in the world. There has been heavy criticism of Slovakia for having corrupt political and justice systems. In particular, the Gorilla scandal led to a series of protests aimed at ending top-level government corruption.

In comparison to its neighbours, Slovakia has relatively little corruption within its police force and they are instead assigned the task of breaking the cycle of corruption in other official bodies. The police force consists of a special anti-corruption department, a specialized criminal court on corruption and special prosecution units. There are a series of laws in Slovakia in the Penal Code which aim to prohibit corruption within all areas of Slovakian society. The Strategy of Crime and Prevention in the Slovak Republic (2007-2010) was also created to establish an Anti-Corruption Strategy. Within the EU Anti-Corruption Report (2014), the European Commission noted that there were many structural weaknesses in promoting the rule of law whilst Transparency International &quot;considered the police force to be among the weakest institutions in Slovakia&quot;. This indicates the police force faces challenges in fighting corruption.

The inefficiencies of the police force in Slovakia would suggest that a certain level of corruption exists within its own structure. The Slovak Republic requested the World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development to complete diagnostic surveys of corruption in Slovakia. Surveys were conducted in households, enterprises and public offices and the results between the three survey groups showed similarities. They all agreed that the health system, the justice system, customs, the National Property Fund and the police were corrupt. Within police corruption, the surveys found that traffic police were the ones to be held accountable for the most corruption. From 388 household respondents, 37% claimed to have paid a bribe to a police officer at least once, while 19% claimed to have done so several times. Moreover, the United States Department of State Country Report on Slovakia found that they were 11 serious cases of police corruption in 2011. The most common form of police corruption within Slovakia is the extortion of bribes, which predominantly occurs at traffic stops.

The low rate of police corruption in Slovakia – besides the traffic police – suggests that the extensive laws against corruption act as a deterrent for police officers. While the level of the corruption within the justice system in Slovakia remains quite high, corruption in the police force remains somewhat confined to traffic police and their extortion of minor bribes.

====Slovenia====
Contemporary concerns about police corruption are largely reflected by public opinion, which demonstrate widespread consensus that corruption within all public sectors is a &quot;very big problem&quot; in Slovenia. The 2013 Special Eurobarometer on Corruption showed that 76% (the second highest percentage in the EU) of Slovenian participants believed there had been an increase in corruption in the last three years. Furthermore, public opinion suggests that police corruption in particular is a significant issue, which much concern over bribery, and abuse of power for personal gain amongst Slovenian police officers.

Initially, Slovenian legislation did not provide for corruption as a separate offence distinguished from other forms of crime. Corruption is not used as a legal term in Slovenia, instead, the legislation provides for each offence individually as a criminal act. The Prevention of Corruption Act, adopted in 2004, defines corruption as &quot;ever trespassing of the obligated treatment of official or responsible subject in the private or public sector, as well as the treatment of subjects that are initiators of violators, or subjects that can benefit from the violations&quot;. Changes within the organisation of policing in Slovenia were brought about initially by the 1991 Constitution, in line with political changes towards a more democratic system with a greater sensitivity towards human rights. These changes, along with the birth of the Constitutional court to enforce these, brought about strict limitations on powers of police to search and seize, as well as more emphasis on the protection of privacy and fundamental rights in criminal proceedings. The judicial control over police powers was further strengthened in the Police Act of 1998, later reinforced by the New Organisation and Work of the Police Act 2013. These acts provide specifically for instances of police corruption. Additionally, the 2013 act allowed an individual to file a direct complaint against a police officer if they thought the act, or failure to act, of the officer violated human rights or fundamental freedoms.

Following the cases of Rehblock v Slovenia (2000) and Matko v Slovenia (2006), a department for the prosecution of officials with special authorisations was established, which removed any police involvement in the investigation of other officers suspected of committing criminal offences. Since this recent introduction, there has been increased investigation and action taken for police offenders. In 2011, the department conducted 80 investigations, out of which 19 police officers were dismissed as a result of the suspicion of them committing a criminal offence.

Lobnikar &amp; Meško (2015) found that within a sample of 550 Slovenian police officers, 23.6% agreed that covering up a police DUI was &#x27;not all that serious&#x27;. Additionally, 34% of respondents claimed that they would not report another police officer who had engaged in conduct such as receiving free meals, gifts from merchants, police DUI and verbal abuse. While this study demonstrated a trend in Slovenian police officers to ignore less serious forms of police corruption, there is agreement (59.1-75%) that police integrity within the Slovenian police work environment is generally high.

Within the wider context of the European Union, corruption continues to be an economic burden. Aside from the consequences within each member state, corruption reduces levels of investment, obstructs the fair operation of the Internal Market and has a negative impact on public finances. It is estimated that approximately 1% of the EU GDP is made up of economic costs incurred by corruption. Specifically, an estimated loss of between 1.5 and 2% of the Slovenian GDP is incurred as a result of corruption. Slovenia has administered substantial improvements to their legal framework to address the issue of police corruption among Central and Eastern European Member States. However, issues with the effective enforcement of these anti-corruption measures still remain, due to &quot;weak control mechanisms&quot; administered by the government. Lobnikar&#x27;s &amp; Meško&#x27;s 2015 survey demonstrates a high level of police integrity strictly connected to the &#x27;code of silence&#x27; in the police community. Therefore, anti-corruption strategies related to changing perceptions and moral beliefs about the seriousness of corruptive police conduct may be the most effective at improving Slovenia&#x27;s anti-corruption enforcement.

====Saudi Arabia====
Jamal Khashoggi was a critic of Saudi Arabia who was tortured and murdered by Saudi law enforcement officials. He was invited to the Saudi embassy in Turkey and was kidnapped there.
 In 2011, Saudi Arabia also sent law enforcement to next door Bahrain to put down protesters.

====Spain====
In Global Corruption Barometer 2013 report conducted by Transparency International, Spain ranked 37th out of 175 countries (1st being the least corrupt) on the Corruption Perception Index with the highest form of corruption being political at 4.4%. The 3rd highest was police corruption at 3.1%. Under the Spanish Constitution, corruption is defined as where a holder of public authority or public official who solicits or receives a gift or offer for carrying out in the course of his duties, for his own gain or for the benefit of others, an act or omission which constitutes an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for 2 to 6 years. 

Since 1996, on average per year, there have been 25 reported police corruption cases to the media.

As a member of the European Partner&#x27;s Against Corruption (EPAC), a document was released in November 2011 about the Policing Oversight Principles, which for Spain is the Inspectorate of Personnel and Security Services who oversees the enforcement of these policing principles of the above bodies:

The highest standard of policing, respect for the rule of law and human rights in all policing activities, greater public confidence in policing, proper systems of accountability for police officers and other law enforcement officials, effective redress for those who are victims of police misconduct, greater openness and understanding of policing by citizens, systems to ensure that lessons are learnt from incidents and errors, greater respect for the law, policing and as a consequence reductions in criminality.

However, according to Freelance Journalist; Guy Hedgecoe, &quot;corruption [has] been accepted as a part of Spanish everyday life&quot;.

====Thailand====
====United Arab Emirates====
Police in the UAE have abused those in their custody and sometimes this abuse has led to death. The Abu Dhabi Police allegedly assisted Sheikh Issa bin Zayed Al Nahyan in a 2009 torture incident. The Police are also alleged to have used excessive force on critics and protesters.

====United Kingdom====
A 2011 report by Transparency International concluded that although corruption is not endemic, it is a much greater problem than recognised and that there was an inadequate response to its growing threat. The report also found that the response to corruption from British institutions was often underwhelming and failed to adequately address the issues. A 2015 report by Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) on the capability of British institutions to tackle police corruption argued that progress had been made in combating corruption since 2011, noting that allegations of misconduct and corruption inside the police force are being taken seriously, and that superior officers displayed strong ethical commitments to tackling corruption. However, the report also condemned the relatively large number of investigations where no further action was taken, roughly two thirds of all investigations. HMIC Mike Cunningham noted that many cases of police corruption are dropped due to being unfounded, however they believed many cases had not been adequately investigated. Officers were also shown to lack confidence in the anonymity and mechanisms in place for reporting the misconduct of peers, which hinders the ability of institutions to effectively identify and combat police corruption.

In the UK, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is responsible for overseeing the system of handling complaints made against police officers in England and Wales, while these duties are handled by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland (OPONI) in Northern Ireland, and the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) in Scotland. These agencies can manage or supervise police investigations into corruption, conduct independent investigations into the most serious cases, and can refer cases for prosecution should enough evidence be found to form a case.

A 2012 report into police corruption in England and Wales by the IPCC noted the prevalence of the serious offences referred to them from 2008 to 2011; perverting the course of justice (33%), theft or fraud (30%), abuse of authority (15%), unauthorised disclosure of information (13%), and misuse of systems (9%). The IPCC received 837 referrals during this period, mostly from British citizens. 47 cases were referred for prosecution, resulting in ten prison sentences, one suspended sentence and one fine. As a result of all investigations into the corruption and misconduct of British police and staff between 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2014, 134 police officers and staff were dismissed, while a further 711 faced disciplinary sanctions. 103 Metropolitan Police officers were also suspended during this period. Offences included drug related offences, bribery, theft or fraud, sexual misconduct, and information disclosure, where information disclosure and theft or fraud were the most common offences. The Directorate of Professional standards considers the &quot;exploitation of staff through inappropriate relationships with journalists, private investigators and criminals&quot; the biggest threat to police integrity.

On 27 June 2012 the Home Affairs Committee announced an inquiry into the IPCC including, but not limited to, analysis of the independence of the commission, the powers and responsibilities of the commission and the effectiveness of Commission investigations. The committee began hearing evidence on 17 July 2012. The report was published on 29 January 2013 and was scathing, describing it as &quot;woefully underequipped and hamstrung in achieving its original objectives. It has neither the powers nor the resources that it needs to get to the truth when the integrity of the police is in doubt.&quot;

In 2014, newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; published a leaked 2002 Metropolitan Police report which indicated that criminals used Freemasonry connections to recruit corrupt officers.

==== United States ====

Grand juries often decline to seek charges for U.S. police officers involved in violent activity due to the violent nature of policing, though some U.S. police have faced killing charges. Corruption cases and other non-violent crimes are more likely to be prosecuted.

==== Uzbekistan ====

==== Venezuela ====
Venezuela&#x27;s corruption includes widespread corruption in the police force. Criminologists and experts have stated that low wages and lack of police supervision has been attributed to police corruption. Many victims are afraid to report crimes to the police because many officers are involved with criminals and may bring even more harm to the victims. Human Rights Watch has reported that the &quot;police commit one of every five crimes&quot; and that thousands of people have been killed by police officers acting with impunity; only 3% of officers have been charged in cases against them. The Metropolitan Police force in Caracas was so corrupt that it was disbanded and was even accused of assisting in many of the 17,000 kidnappings.

The Corruption Perceptions Index, produced annually by the NGO Transparency International (TNI) ranked Venezuela among the most corrupt countries in the world A 2013 survey by TNI in 2013 found that 68% of those believed that the government&#x27;s efforts to fight corruption were ineffective; a majority of those surveyed said the government&#x27;s effort against corruption were ineffective, that corruption had increased from 2007 to 2010, and perceived political parties, the judiciary, the parliament and the police to be the institutions most affected by corruption.

==Noble cause corruption==

Noble cause corruption, as ethical corruption, is a departure from conventional discussions on police corruption, which typically focus on monetary corruption. According to the field of Police Ethics, noble cause corruption is police misconduct &quot;committed in the name of good ends.&quot; In &quot;Police Ethics&quot; it argued that some of the best officers are often the most susceptible to noble cause corruption. According to professional policing literature, noble cause corruption includes &quot;planting or fabricating evidence, lying or the fabrication and manipulation of facts on reports or through testimony in court, and generally abusing police authority to make a charge stick.&quot; According to Robert Reiner, a professor at the London School of Economics, stops based on 
statistical discrimination are also a form of noble cause corruption.

Many police officers who take bribes believe they are providing a public service

==Effects==
Police corruption affects society, including political, economic, and sociological. The social aspect is perhaps easiest to define, because even one corrupt officer in a department can generate an overall distrust of the department (the theory). This negative outlook on policing by civilians helps maintain an &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality among police, which only serves to further the rift between police officers and civilians.

Police corruption, when brought to the public eye, increases pressures on departments by lawmakers to enact change from within. In 2013, the West Valley City, Utah police&#x27;s narcotics unit was disbanded due to rampant corruption among its officers. These officers were found stealing small items from seized vehicles, taking evidence, and placing tracking devices on potential suspects&#x27; vehicles without warrants. This action, like many others, not only increases distrust among the public, but lawmakers begin to feel pressure from the masses to remove officers and revamp entire departments.

===Political===

====Civilian involvement====
Civilians within the jurisdiction look to lawmakers and justice officials to enact justice against the officers involved. If the instance of corruption happens to fall on an election year, their re-election campaign may be lost.

In areas such as Afghanistan, media exposure and civilian involvement in combating corruption is rarely seen. Rather, international officials step in to help eliminate corruption in the department.

====Top-down discipline====
Depending on the number of people involved and severity of the acts, the state executive or legislature may be compelled to demand that the department be scrutinized and its policies corrected. This can involve replacing individual officers, mid-level leadership, or asking for a resignation by the department chief. Disciplinary actions depend on the severity of the act, but typically result in disciplinary actions by the department and negative media coverage for the department. In 1970, the New York City Knapp Commission began holding officers and supervision accountable and instituting real disciplinary actions for police corruption. In countries where corruption is a major issue, such as China and Russia, state government is often directly involved in investigating and disciplining cases of corruption, such as in the Chongqing gang trials, where police chief Wen Qiang was detained and put on trial for accepting bribes, rape, and other crimes during the Chongqing gang crackdown.

===Social===

====General distrust of police in the community====
While political issues can easily be worked through, the social effect of police corruption is much harder to overcome. Civilians, especially those who or know someone who has been victimized by certain types of corruption, tend to see police officers as enemy forces. Similarly, police officers view civilians in the same light. Both issues have only been exacerbated by the War on Crime and War on Drugs. The &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality is especially prevalent among inner city minorities, where stereotyping and racial targeting seem to be the norm.

====Rotten apple theory====

This theory suggests that one bad cop ruins the entire department. A single officer can not only cause leadership to initiate investigations over entire sections or the department as a whole, but that one corrupt officer/the rotten apple can bring a generally appreciated department to its knees in terms of public relations. People look at that one bad cop and assume, sometimes correctly (especially in this case, where several other officers were found to be committing similar violations) the entire department is corrupt and committing similar or worse acts. A 2019 study in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; backs up this theory, finding that misconduct by one police officer substantially increased the likelihood that peer officers would also engage in misconduct. The article uses the metaphor of a contagion.

====Reduced effectiveness====
Police corruption not only generates distrust among the public, but undermines the criminal justice system as a whole. Judges and prosecutors may develop a negative opinion of officers who come to testify in cases, especially those who have a history of disciplinary action related to corrupt acts. The trustworthiness of officers who work in departments where corruption has been discovered is severely diminished, and even if the testimony they provide in court is an exact recollection of the events in question, a prosecutor or judge may choose to simply ignore these facts because of their association with a seemingly corrupt department. In the case of the Waldo Police Department located in Florida, the entire department was disbanded partly due to allegations of corruption, meaning county law enforcement must take over where the city failed.

===Economic===

====Officer training====
Should the corrupt act not be extremely severe, or the department decide discharge of the officer is unnecessary, those involved in corrupt acts may be charged to undergo remedial training. This could be inside or outside the department, and becomes another red mark on the already strapped budget of most departments. The cost of this remedial training pales in comparison to the cost of having to train new officers to replace those who are relieved of their duties, since these new hires will need to undergo initial academy training as well as whatever additional training the officer would require as they advanced in their career.

====Investigations====
Investigation and litigation costs may be high. These investigators are either part of their own department or taken from other squads (county sheriff investigating a city department, for example), or can be private entities. The department must also invest in retaining attorneys for both themselves and the officers involved.

==In popular culture==

The Gestapo was a notorious organization tasked with destroying political opponents of the Nazi movement, suppressing any opposition to Nazi policies, and persecuting Jews. From its origins as a Prussian intelligence organization, it grew into a sprawling and greatly feared apparatus of oppression. Heinrich Himmler was given command over Göring&#x27;s Gestapo in 1934. Himmler, in addition to his position as head of the SS, took control of all German police forces, including the Ordnungspolizei (German: &quot;Order Police&quot;), with his appointment as Reichsführer SS and chief of the German police.

<text>The [[History of the Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] is a group of tribes indigenous to East Africa, residing mainly in what was formerly the Rift Valley Province in Kenya and the eastern slopes of Mount Elgon in Uganda. They number 6,358,113 individuals per the Kenyan 2019 census and an estimated 273,839 in Uganda according to the 2014 census mainly in Kapchorwa, Kween and Bukwo districts.

The Kalenjin have been divided into 11 culturally and linguistically related tribes: Kipsigis (1.9 million), Nandi (937,000), Pokots (778,000), Sebei (350,000), Sabaot (296,000), Keiyo (451,000), Tugen (197,556), Cherang&#x27;any 8,323, Marakwet (119,000), Ogiek (52,000), Terik (323,230), Lembus (71,600) and Sengwer (10,800). The Kalenjin speak the Kipsigis languages but can also be inclusive of Akie language in Tanzania and Pokot language spoken in Kenya; all being classified collectively as Kalenjin Language; while in combination with Datooga languages of Tanzania, this cluster is called Southern Nilotic languages. The Kalenjin language, along with the languages of the Datooga people of Tanzania, the Maasai, Luo, Turkana, Nuer, Dinka among others are classified as Nilotic languages.

==Prehistory==
===Origins===

Linguistic evidence points to the eastern Middle Nile Basin south of the Abbai River, as the nursery of the Nilotic languages. That is to say south-east of present-day Khartoum.

It is thought that beginning in the second millennium B.C., particular Nilotic speaking communities began to move southward into present-day South Sudan where most settled and that the societies today referred to as the Southern Nilotes pushed further on, reaching what is present-day north-eastern Uganda by 1000 B.C.

Linguist Christopher Ehret proposes that between 1000 and 700 BC, the Southern Nilotic speaking communities, who kept domestic stock and possibly cultivated sorghum and finger millet, 
lived next to an Eastern Cushitic speaking community with whom they had significant cultural interaction. The general location of this point of cultural exchange being somewhere near the common border between Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia.

Ehret suggests that the cultural exchange perceived in borrowed loan words, adoption of the practice of circumcision and the cyclical system of age-set organisation dates to this period.

===Neolithic===

The arrival of the Southern Nilotes on the East African archaeological scene is correlated with the appearance of the prehistoric lithic industry and pottery tradition referred to as the Elmenteitan culture. The bearers of the Elmenteitan culture developed a distinct pattern of land use, hunting and pastoralism on the western plains of Kenya during the East African Pastoral Neolithic. Its earliest recorded appearance dates to the ninth century BC.

Certain distinct traits of the Southern Nilotes, notably in pottery styles, lithic industry and burial practices, are evident in the archaeological record.

Ehret suggests that around the fifth and sixth centuries BC, the speakers of the Southern Nilotic languages split into two major divisions – the proto-Kalenjin and the proto-Datooga. The former took shape among those residing to the north of the Mau range while the latter took shape among sections that moved into the Mara and Loita plains south of the western highlands.

===Pastoral iron age===

====Early iron-age====
The material culture referred to as Sirikwa is seen as a development from the local pastoral neolithic (i.e. Elmenteitan culture), as well as a locally limited transition from the Neolithic to the Iron Age.

Radiocarbon dating of archaeological excavations done in Rongai (Deloraine) have ranged in date from around 985 to 1300 A.D and have been associated with the early development phase of the Sirikwa culture. Lithics from Deloraine Farm site show that people were abandoning previous technological strategies in favor of more expedient tool production as iron was entering common use. The spread of iron technology led to the abandonment of many aspects of Pastoral Neolithic material culture and practices.

From the Central Rift, the culture radiated outwards toward the western highlands, the Mt. Elgon region and possibly into Uganda.

====Late iron-age====
The Sirikwa culture was the predominant Kenyan hinterland archaeological culture of the Pastoral Iron Age, c.2000 BP. The name Sirikwa derives from a community that occupied the Uasin Gishu plateau perhaps as late as the 17th or 18th century. Seen to have developed out of the Elmenteitan culture of the East African Pastoral Neolithic c.3300-1200 BP, the Sirikwa culture was followed in much of its area by the Kalenjin, Maa, western and central Kenyan communities of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Archaeological evidence indicates a highly sedentary way of life and a cultural commitment to a closed defensive system for both community and livestock during the Iron Age. Family homesteads featured small individual family stock pens, elaborate gate-works and sentry points and houses facing into the homestead; defensive methods primarily designed to proof against individual thieves or small groups of rustlers hoping to succeed by stealth. Coins of Indian and English origin, some dating to this period have been found at the Hyrax Hill archaeological site and may indicate contacts with international trade networks.

At their greatest extent, their territories covered the highlands from the Chepalungu and Mau forests northwards as far as the Cherangany Hills and Mount Elgon. There was also a south-eastern projection, at least in the early period, into the elevated Rift grasslands of Nakuru which was taken over permanently by the Maasai, probably no later than the seventeenth century.

==History==

===Pre-19th century===
A body of oral traditions from various East African communities points to the presence of at least four significant Kalenjin-speaking population groups present prior to the 19th century. The earliest mention appears to be of the Lumbwa. Meru oral history describes the arrival of their ancestors at Mount Kenya where they interacted with this community. The Lumbwa occupied the lower reaches of Mount Kenya though the extent of their territory is presently unclear.

North-east of this community, across the Rift Valley, a community known as the Chok (later Suk) occupied the Elgeyo escarpment. Pokot oral history describes their way of life, as that of the Chemwal whose country may have been known as Chemngal, a community that appears to have lived in association with the Chok. The Chemwal appear to have been referred to as Siger by the Karamojong on account of a distinctive cowrie shell adornment favored by the women of this community. The area occupied by the Chemwal stretched between Mount Elgon and present day Uasin Gishu as well as into a number of surrounding counties.

Far west, a community known as the Maliri occupied present-day Jie and Dodoth country in Uganda. The Karamojong would eject them from this region over the course of the century and their traditions describe these encounters with the Maliri. The arrival in the district of the latter community is thought by some to be in the region of six to eight centuries ago.

To the north of Chemngal were the Oropom (Orupoi), a late neolithic society whose expansive territory is said to have stretched across Turkana and the surrounding region as well as into Uganda and Sudan. Wilson (1970) who collected traditions relating to the Oropom observed that the corpus of oral literature suggested that, at its tail end, the society &quot;had become effete, after enjoying for a long period the fruits of a highly developed culture&quot;. Bordering the Maliri in Uganda were the Karamojong, an Iron Age community that practiced a pastoral way of life.

Towards the end of 18th century and through the 19th century, a series of droughts, plagues of locusts, epidemics, and in the final decades of the 19th century, a rapid succession of sub-continental epizootics affected these communities. There is an early record of the great Laparanat drought c.1785 that affected the Karamajong. However, for communities then resident in what is present-day Kenya many disaster narratives relate the start with the Aoyate, an acute meteorological drought that affected much of East and Southern Africa. Nile records distinctly indicate a start about 1800 while oral narratives and the few written records indicate peak aridity during the 1830s resulting in a notable famine in 1836. This arid period, and the consequent series of events, have been referred to as (the first) Mutai.

A feature of the Mutai was increased conflict between neighboring communities, most noted of these has been the Iloikop wars.

===19th century===

Cultural changes, particularly the innovation of heavier and deadlier spears amongst the Loikop are seen to have led to significant changes in methods and scale of raiding during the 19th century. The change in methods introduced by the Loikop also consisted of fundamental differences of strategy, in fighting and defense, and also in organization of settlements and of political life.

The cultural changes played a part in significant southward expansion of Loikop territory from a base east of Lake Turkana. This expansion led to the development of three groupings within Loikop society. The Samburu who occupied the &#x27;original&#x27; country east of Lake Turkana as well as the Laikipia plateau. The Uasin Gishu occupied the grass plateaus now known as the Uasin Gishu and Mau while the Maasai territory extended from Naivasha to Kilimanjaro. This expansion was subsequently followed by the Iloikop wars.

The expansion of Turkana and Loikop societies led to significant change within the Kalenjin-speaking society. Some communities were annihilated by the combined effects of the Mutai of the 19th century while others adapted to the new era.

Members of collapsing communities were usually assimilated into ascending identities.

Significant cultural change also occurred. Guarding cattle on the plateaus depended less on elaborate defenses and more on mobility and cooperation. Both of these requiring new grazing and herd-management strategies. The practice of the later Kalenjin – that is, after they had abandoned the Sirikwa pattern and had ceased in effect to be Sirikwa – illustrates this change vividly. On their reduced pastures, notably on the borders of the Uasin Gishu plateau, when bodies of raiders approached they would relay the alarm from ridge to ridge, so that the herds could be combined and rushed to the cover of the forests. There, the approaches to the glades would be defended by concealed archers, and the advantage would be turned against the spears of the plains warriors.

More than any of the other sections, the Nandi and Kipsigis, in response to Maasai expansion, borrowed from the Maasai some of the traits that would distinguish them from other Kalenjin: large-scale economic dependence on herding, military organization and aggressive cattle raiding, as well as centralized religious-political leadership. By the mid-nineteenth century, both these communities were expanding at the expense of the Maasai.

The Iloikop wars ended in the 1870s with the defeat and dispersal of the Laikipiak. However, the new territory acquired by the Maasai was vast and left them overextended thus unable to occupy it effectively. This left them open to encroachment by other communities. By the early 1880s, Kamba, Kikuyu and Kalenjin raiders were making inroads into Maasai territory, and the Maasai were struggling to control their resources of cattle and grazing land.

Around this time, two instances of epizootics broke out in the Rift Valley region. In 1883, bovine Pleuro-Pneumonia spread from the north and lingered for several years. The effect of this was to cause the Loikop to regroup and to go out raiding more aggressively to replenish their herds. This was followed by a far more serious outbreak of Rinderpest which occurred in 1891.

This period – characterized by disasters, including a rinderpest epidemic, other stock diseases, drought, mass starvation, and smallpox was referred to as (a second) Mutai.

===Traditional way of life===

The nineteenth century saw massive upheaval among the Sirikwa societies, old identities such as the Maliri and the Chok were annihilated or assimilated giving way to new identities such as the Pokot. Others like the Sengwer and Lumbwa acculturated to the new reality, merging and dropping their old identities to become Nandi and Kipsigis. These new societies retained many elements of their old way of life – like the iron-age Sirikwa societies they were primarily semi-nomadic pastoralists. Their economy revolved around raising livestock and cultivating sorghum and pearl millet on the western highlands of Kenya as it had since at least the last millennium B.C. 

There appear to have been areas of specialization across different regions, communities living on the Elgeyo escarpment for instance traditionally focused on irrigated cultivation. A variety of crops had been borrowed from the neighboring Bantu communities and New World foods introduced following the arrival of the Portuguese on the Swahili coast during the fifteenth century. Of these, indigenous vegetables and herbs, beans, pumpkins, sweet potatoes and tobacco were grown widely while maize and bananas were also cultivated though in small quantities.

They traded locally for goods such as honey, pottery, tobacco pipes and weaponry as well as medical and magical services while connections to international markets supplied foreign goods such as iron wire and cloth in exchange for ivory. The long tradition of beadwork benefited from the introduction of a variety of beads from European markets.

Their territory was not as a whole recognized as a geographic locality. However, there was a standardized set of classifications for geographic localities across the respective territories. Of these geographic classifications, the &quot;Kokwet&quot; was the most significant political and judicial unit among the Kalenjin. The governing body of each kokwet was its &quot;kokwet&quot; council; the word &quot;kokwet&quot; was in fact variously used to mean the whole neighbourhood, its council and the place where the council met. The head of &quot;kokwet&quot; was &quot;poyop kok&quot; (village elder).

Social order was regulated by Kamuratanet and cultural life largely revolved around its teaching through folklore and observation of the various tumwek (rituals/customs), the important one&#x27;s being Tumdo (Initiation) and the tumwek of marriage such as Koito. The Saget&#x27;ab eito ceremony was held every number of years to mark the change of &#x27;ages&#x27; and the Kipsundet festivals celebrated every September (Kipsunde) and October (Kipsunde oeng) to mark the change in seasons.

To a significant extent however, the Maasai era fundamentally changed the character of the Sirikwa/Kalenjin-speaking communities, the magnitude of which still remains unclear.

===20th century===

The latter decades of the nineteenth century, saw the early European explorers start advancing into the interior of Kenya. By this time, the Kalenjin – more so the Nandi, had acquired a fearsome reputation. Thompson was warned in 1883 to avoid the country of the Nandi, who were known for attacks on strangers and caravans that would attempt to scale the great massif of the Mau. 

Nonetheless, trade relations were established between the Kalenjin and incoming British. This was tempered on the Kalenjin side by the prophesies of various seers. Among the Nandi, Kimnyole had warned that contact with the Europeans would have a significant impact on the Nandi while Mongo was said to have warned against fighting the Europeans.

Matson, in his account of the resistance, shows &#x27;how the irresponsible actions of two British traders, Dick and West, quickly upset the precarious modus vivendi between the Nandi and incoming British&#x27;. Conflict, led on the Nandi side by Koitalel Arap Samoei – Nandi Orkoiyot at the time, was triggered by West&#x27;s killing in 1895.

The East Africa Protectorate, Foreign Office, and missionary societies administrations reacted to West&#x27;s death by organizing invasions of Nandi in 1895 and 1897. Invading forces were able to inflict sporadic losses upon Nandi warriors, steal hundreds of livestock, and burn villages, but were not able to end Nandi resistance.

1897 also saw the colonial government set up base in Eldama Ravine under the leadership of certain Messrs. Ternan and Grant, an intrusion that was not taken to kindly by the Lembus community. This triggered conflict between the Lembus and the British, the latter of whom fielded Maasai and Nubian soldiers and porters.

The British eventually overcame the Lembus following which Grant and Lembus elders negotiated a peace agreement. During the negotiations, the Lembus were prevailed upon by Grant to state what they would not harm nor kill, to which the response was women. As such, they exchanged a girl from the Kimeito clan while Grant offered a white bull as a gesture of peace and friendship. This agreement was known as the Kerkwony Agreement. The negotiations were held where Kerkwony Stadium stands today.

On 19 October 1905, on the grounds of what is now Nandi Bears Club, Arap Samoei was asked to meet Col Richard Meinertzhagen for a truce. A grand-nephew of one of Arap Samoei&#x27;s bodyguards later noted that &quot;There were about 22 of them who went for a meeting with the (European) that day. Koitalel Arap Samoei had been advised not to shake hands because if he did, that would give him away as the leader. But he extended his hand and was shot immediately&quot;. Koitalel&#x27;s death led to the end of the Nandi resistance.

===Colonial period===

====Politics and identity====
Until the mid-20th century, the Kalenjin did not have a common name and were usually referred to as the &#x27;Nandi-speaking tribes&#x27; by scholars and colonial administration officials.

Starting in the 1940s, individuals from the various &#x27;Nandi-speaking tribes&#x27; who had been drafted to fight in World War II (1939–1945) began using the term Kale or Kore (a term that denoted scarification of a warrior who had killed an enemy in battle) to refer to themselves. At about the same time, a popular local radio broadcaster by the name of John Chemallan would introduce his wartime broadcasts show with the phrase Kalenjok meaning &quot;I tell You&quot; (when said to many people). This would influence a group of fourteen young &#x27;Nandi-speaking&#x27; men attending Alliance School and who were trying to find a name for their peer group. They would call it Kalenjin meaning &quot;I tell you&quot; (when said to one person). The word Kalenjin was gaining currency as a term to denote all the &#x27;Nandi-speaking&#x27; tribes. This identity would be consolidated with the founding of the Kalenjin Union in Eldoret in 1948 and the publication of a monthly magazine called Kalenjin in the 1950s. 
In 1955 when Mzee Tameno, a Maasai and member of the Legislative Assembly (LEGCO) for Rift Valley, tendered his resignation, the Kalenjin presented one candidate to replace him; Daniel Toroitich arap Moi.

By 1960, concerned with the dominance of the Luo and Kikuyu, Arap Moi and Ronald Ngala formed KADU to defend the interests of the countries smaller ethnicities. They campaigned on a platform of majimboism (devolution) during the 1963 elections but lost to KANU. Shortly after independence in December 1963, Kenyatta convinced Moi to dissolve KADU. This was done in 1964 when KADU dissolved and joined KANU.

====Religion====
Traditional Kalenjin religion was based upon the belief in a supreme god, &quot;Asis&quot; or &quot;Cheptalel,&quot; represented in the form of the sun (asista), although the sun itself was not considered to be God. Beneath &quot;Asis&quot; is &quot;Elat,&quot; who controls thunder and lightning. Spirits of the dead, &quot;oyik,&quot; were believed to intervene in the affairs of humans, and were placated with sacrifices of meat and/or beer, called &quot;koros&quot;. Diviners, called &quot;orkoik&quot;, were considered to have magical powers and assisted in appeals for rain or to end floods.

Christianity was introduced and rapidly spread through Kalenjin-speaking areas during the colonial period. Traditional Kalenjin religion which was undergoing separate change saw a corresponding decline in this time.

Today, nearly everyone claims membership in an organized religion—either Christianity or Islam. Major Christian sects include the Africa Inland Church (AIC), the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK), and the Roman Catholic Church. Muslims are relatively few in number among the Kalenjin. For the most part, only older people can recall details of traditional religious beliefs.

====Food====
The colonial period saw the introduction of tea cultivation on a large scale in the Kericho and Nandi highlands. These regions have since played a significant role in establishing Kenya as the world&#x27;s leading exporter of tea and also in establishing a tea-drinking culture among the Kalenjin. This period also saw the introduction of the mid-day meal as well as the addition of wheat based foods such as bread and less often pancakes and maandazi to the morning meal.

====Literacy====
A significant cultural change of the colonial period was the introduction and adoption of the Latin script for transcribing first the Bible, and later Kalenjin lore and history.

==Recent history==

===Demographics===
According to Kenya&#x27;s 2019 census, Kalenjin people number 6,358,113 individuals, making it the third-largest ethnic group in Kenya after the Kikuyu and the Luhya.&lt;mapframe latitude=&quot;0.57128&quot; longitude=&quot;35.546265&quot; zoom=&quot;7&quot; width=&quot;339&quot; height=&quot;428&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

====Subdivisions====
There are several ethnic groups within the Kalenjin: They include the Keiyo, Endorois, Kipsigis, Marakwet, Nandi, Pokot, Terik, Tugens, Sengwer (Cherengany), Lembus and Sabaot..pokot

===Economic activity===
A significant majority of Kalenjin speakers are primarily subsistence farmers, they cultivate grains such as maize and wheat and, to a lesser extent, sorghum and millet or practice a pastoralist lifestyle; rearing beef, goats and sheep for meat production. Equally large numbers practice a combination of both farming and livestock (often dairy cattle) rearing. The counties of Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia and to a lesser extent Nakuru are often referred to as Kenya&#x27;s grain-basket counties and are responsible for supplying much of the country&#x27;s grain requirements.

Meat products from the northern areas of West Pokot and Baringo are particularly appreciated for their flavor and are favored in the Rift for the preparation of nyama choma.

A significant number of Kalenjin have moved to Kenya&#x27;s cities where large numbers are employed in the Kenyan Government, the Army, Police Force, the banking and finance industry as well as in business.

===Politics===
Since independence, Kenyan politics have largely been dominated by the &#x27;big&#x27; five tribes (including Kikuyu, Luhya, Kalenjin, Luo, and Kamba) which constitute about 72% of Kenya population. Kenya&#x27;s second and longest-serving president to date was Daniel Toroitich Araap Moi who was Tugen. Kenya&#x27;s incumbent president, Dr. William Samoei Araap Ruto, is also Kalenjin, coming from the Nandi ethnicity.

In 2007 a disputed election in Kenya erupted into a two-month political crisis that led to the deaths of more than a thousand people and the displacement of almost seven hundred thousand. Much of the violence fell along ethnic lines, the principal perpetrators of which were the Kalenjin, who lashed out at other communities in the Rift Valley. What makes this episode remarkable compared to many other instances of ethnic violence is that the Kalenjin community is a recent construct: the group has only existed since the mid-twentieth century.

==Culture==
Contemporary Kalenjin culture is a product of its heritage, the suite of cultural adoptions of the British colonial period and modern Kenyan identity from which it borrows and adds to.

===Language===
The Kalenjin speak Kalenjin languages as mother tongues. The language grouping belongs to the Nilotic family. The majority of Kalenjin speakers are found in Kenya with smaller populations in Tanzania (e.g., Akie) and Uganda (e.g., Kupsabiny).

Kiswahili and English, both Kenyan national languages are widely spoken as second and third languages by most Kalenjin speakers and as first and second languages by some Kalenjin.

===Names===

Kalenjin names are primarily used by the Kalenjin people of Kenya and Kalenjin language-speaking communities such as the Sebei of Uganda and the Akie of Tanzania.

The Kalenjin traditionally had two primary names for the individual though in contemporary times a Christian or Arabic name is also given at birth such that most Kalenjin today have three names with the patronym Arap in some cases being acquired later in life e.g. Alfred Kirwa Yego and Daniel Toroitch arap Moi.

===Customs===

====Initiation====
The initiation process is a key component of Kalenjin identity. Among males, the circumcision (yatitaet) and initiation (tumdo) process is seen as signifying one&#x27;s transition from boyhood to manhood and is taken very seriously. On the whole, the process still occurs during a boys pre-teen/early teenage years though significant differences are emerging in practice. Much esotericism is still attended to in the traditional practice of initiation and there was great uproar amongst Kalenjin elders in 2013 when aspects of the tradition were openly inquired into at the International Court. Conversely a number of contemporary Kalenjin have the circumcision process carried out in hospital as a standard surgical procedure and various models of the learning process have emerged to complement the modern practice. For orthodox, urban and Christian traditions the use of ibinwek is in decline and the date has been moved from the traditional September/October festive season to December to coincide with the Kenyan school calendar.

The female circumcision process is perceived negatively in the modern world (see: FGM) and various campaigns are being carried out with the intention of eradicating the practice among the Kalenjin. A notable anti-FGM crusader is Hon. Linah Jebii Kilimo.

====Marriage====
The contemporary Kalenjin wedding has fewer ceremonies than it did traditionally and they often, though not always, occur on different days;

During the first ceremony, the proposal/show-up (kaayaaet&#x27;ap koito), the young man who wants to marry, informs his parents of his intention and they in turn tell their relatives often as part of discussing suitability of the pairing. If they approve, they will go to the girls family for a show-up and to request for the girl&#x27;s hand in marriage. The parents are usually accompanied by aunts, uncles or even grandparents and the request is often couched as an apology to the prospective brides parents for seeking to take their daughter away from them. If her family agrees to let them have their daughter, a date for a formal engagement is agreed upon. Other than initiating it, the intended groom and prospective bride play no part in this ceremony.

During the second ceremony, the formal engagement (koito), the bridegroom&#x27;s family goes to the bride&#x27;s home to officially meet her family. The groom&#x27;s family which includes aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc. are invited into a room for extensive introductions and dowry negotiations. After the negotiations, a ceremony is held where the bridegroom and bride are given advice on family life by older relatives from both families. Usually, symbolic gifts and presents are given to the couple during this ceremony. The koito is usually quite colorful and sometimes bears resemblance to a wedding ceremony and it is indeed gaining prominence as the key event since the kaayaaet&#x27;ap koito is sometimes merged with it and at other times the tunisiet is foregone in favor of it.

The third ceremony, the wedding (tunisiet), is a big ceremony whereas many relations, neighbors, friends and business partners are invited. In modern iterations, this ceremony often follows the pattern of a regular Western wedding; it is usually held in church, where rings are exchanged, is officiated by a pastor and followed by a reception.

===Religion===

Almost all modern Kalenjin are members of an organised religion with the vast majority being Christian and a few identifying as Muslim.

===Elders===
The Kalenjin have a council of elders composed of members of the various Kalenjin clans and sub-clans and known as the Myoot Council of Elders. This council was formed in the Kenyan post-independence period.

===Folklore===

Like all oral societies, the Kalenjin developed a rich collection of folklore. Folk narratives were told to pass on a message and a number featured the Chemosit, known in Marakwet as Chebokeri, the dreaded monster that devoured the brains of disobedient children.

The Legend of Cheptalel is fairly common among the Kipsigis and Nandi and the name was adopted from Kalenjin mythology into modern tradition. The fall of the Long&#x27;ole Clan is another popular tale based on a true story and is told to warn against pride. In the story, the Long&#x27;ole warriors believing they were the mightiest in the land goaded their distant rivals the Maasai into battle. The Maasai, though at first reluctant eventually attacked wiping out the Long&#x27;ole clan.

As with other East African communities, the colonial period Misri myth has over time become popular among the Kalenjin and aspects of it have influenced the direction of folkloric and academic studies.

===Arts &amp; crafts===

The use of arts and crafts form part of Kalenjin culture with decorative bead-work being the most highly developed visual art. The Kalenjin are generally not well known for their handicraft&#x27;s however, though women do make and locally sell decorated calabashes made from gourds. These gourd calabashes known as sotet are rubbed with oil and adorned with small colored beads and are essentially the same type of calabashes that are used for storing mursik.

===Radio, television, and film===
Up until the early 21st century, vernacular radio and television stations were essentially banned in Kenya. The liberalization of the media sector in Kenya which began in the 1990s has seen the growth of Kalenjin language content across most modern mediums. This period has seen the establishment of Kalenjin language media companies such as Kass Media Group, a Kenyan radio and television company, as well as Kalenjin language stations within diverse media groups e.g. Chamgei FM (Royal Media Services) and Kitwek FM (Kenya Broadcasting Corporation). There has been a concurrent proliferation of Kalenjin music, television programs and more recently the premier of the first Kalenjin language film, Ngebe Gaa, at the 2019 Eldoret Film Festival.

===Music===
Contemporary Kalenjin music has long been influenced by the Kipsigis leading to Kericho&#x27;s perception as a cultural innovation center. Musical innovation and regional styles, however, abound across all Kalenjin speaking areas. Popular musicians include Pastor Joel Kimetto (father of Kalenjin Gospel), Mike Rotich, Emmy Kosgei, Maggy Cheruiyot, Josphat Koech Karanja, Lilian Rotich and Barbra Chepkoech. Msupa S and Kipsang represent an emerging generation of Kalenjin pop musicians. Notable stars who have passed on include Diana Chemutai Musila (Chelele), Junior Kotestes and Weldon Cheruiyot (Kenene).

===Literature===
A number of writers have documented Kalenjin history and culture, notably B. E. Kipkorir, Paul Kipchumba, and Ciarunji Chesaina.

===Cuisine===

Ugali, known in Kalenjin as kimnyet, served with cooked vegetables such as isageek (African cabbage) or sochot (African nightshade), and milk form the staples of the Kalenjin diet. Less often ugali, rice or chapati, is served with roast meat, usually beef or goat, and occasionally chicken. The traditional ugali is made of millet and sorghum and is known as psong&#x27;iot. It is considered healthier than ugali made of maize flour (similar to brown bread/white bread) and has seen a resurgence in popularity in tandem with global trends towards healthier eating. The traditional snack moriot (somewhat similar to corn tortillas) is obtained from the crust after cooking ugali and is still quite enjoyed. Similarly, the traditional drink mursik, and honey, both considered delicacies (karise/kariseyuek) for a long time remain quite popular.

Extensive use is made of dairy produce in traditional recipes such as socheek (a vegetable relish made with greens, milk and cream) as well as contemporary meals such as Mcheleng (rice with milk – a creamy smooth dish made as a delicacy for children but usually enjoyed by the entire family) and Bean stew with milk and cream.

Combination dishes/mixtures while not considered traditionally Kalenjin are encountered in more cosmopolitan areas. The most common of these is &quot;kwankwaniek&quot;, a mixture of maize and beans boiled together (githeri).

Milk or tea may be drunk by adults and children with any meal or snack. Tea (chaiik) averages 40% milk by volume and is usually liberally sweetened. If no milk is available tea may be drunk black with sugar though taking tea without milk is considered genuine hardship.

In addition to bread, people routinely buy foodstuffs such as sugar, tea leaves, cooking fat, sodas, and other items that they do not produce themselves.

===Health &amp; science===
Traditional Kalenjin knowledge was fairly comprehensive in the study and usage of plants for medicinal purposes and a significant trend among some contemporary Kalenjin scientists is the study of this aspect of traditional knowledge. In more recent times, commercial enterprises have started blending and packaging traditional herbal remedies for the urban Kenyan market. Most noted of these is Harriet&#x27;s Botanicals which packages Arorwet and Tendwet alternative remedies and distributes them via a number of shops spread across the country.

One of the more notable Kalenjin scientists is Prof Richard Mibey whose work on the Tami dye helped revive the textile industry in Eldoret and western Kenya in general.

===Sport===

The Kalenjin have been called by some &quot;the running tribe.&quot; Since the mid-1960s, Kenyan men have earned the largest share of major honours in international athletics at distances from 800 meters to the marathon; the vast majority of these Kenyan running stars have been Kalenjin. From 1980 on, about 40% of the top honours available to men in international athletics at these distances (Olympic medals, World Championships medals, and World Cross Country Championships honours) have been earned by Kalenjin.

In 2008, Pamela Jelimo became the first Kenyan woman to win a gold medal at the Olympics; she also became the first Kenyan to win the Golden League jackpot in the same year. Since then, Kenyan women have become a major presence in international athletics at the distances; most of these women are Kalenjin. Amby Burfoot of &quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot; stated that the odds of Kenya achieving the success they did at the 1988 Olympics were below 1:160 billion. Kenya had an even more successful Olympics in 2008.

A number of theories explaining the unusual athletic prowess among people from the Kalenjin-speaking people have been proposed. These include many explanations that apply equally well to other Kenyans or people living elsewhere who are not disproportionately successful athletes, such as that they run to school every day, that they live at relatively high altitude, and that the prize money from races is large compared to typical yearly earnings. One theory is that the Kalenjin have relatively thin legs and therefore do not have to lift as much leg weight when running long distances.

<text>Nancy Jan Davis (; born November 1, 1953) is a former American astronaut. A veteran of three space flights, Davis logged over 673 hours in space. She is now retired from NASA.

== Early life ==
Nancy Jan Davis was born in Cocoa Beach, Florida, but considers Huntsville, Alabama, to be her hometown.

She graduated from Huntsville High School in 1971, received a Bachelor of Science degree in applied biology from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1975 and another in mechanical engineering from Auburn University in 1977. She received a Master of Science degree in 1983 and a doctorate in 1985, both in mechanical engineering at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

== Engineering career ==
After graduating from Auburn University in 1977, Davis joined Texaco in Bellaire, Texas, working as a petroleum engineer in tertiary oil recovery. She left there in 1979 to work for NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center as an aerospace engineer. In 1986, she was named as team leader in the Structural Analysis Division, and her team was responsible for the structural analysis and verification of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the HST maintenance mission, and the Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility. In 1987, she was also assigned to be the lead engineer for the redesign of the solid rocket booster external tank attach ring. Davis did her graduate research at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, studying the long-term strength of pressure vessels due to the viscoelastic characteristics of filament-wound composites. She holds one patent, has authored several technical papers, and is a Registered Professional Engineer.

== Astronaut career ==
Davis became an astronaut in June 1987. Her first assignment was in the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch, where she provided technical support for Space Shuttle payloads. Following this, Davis was a CAPCOM in Mission Control, responsible for communicating with Shuttle crews for seven missions. After her first space flight, Davis served as the Astronaut Office representative for the Remote Manipulator System (RMS), with responsibility for RMS operations, training, and payloads. After her second space flight, she served as the Chairperson of the NASA Education Working Group and as Chief for the Payloads Branch, which provided Astronaut Office support for all Shuttle and International Space Station payloads. A veteran of three space flights, Davis has logged over 673 hours in space. She flew as a mission specialist on STS-47 in 1992 and STS-60 in 1994, and was the payload commander on STS-85 in 1997.

=== STS-47 ===
STS-47, Spacelab-J, was the 50th Space Shuttle mission. Launched on September 12, 1992, this cooperative venture between the United States and Japan conducted 43 experiments in life sciences and materials processing. During the eight-day mission, she was responsible for operating Spacelab and its subsystems and performing a variety of experiments. Davis&#x27;s then-husband Mark C. Lee was payload commander on STS-47. After completing 126 orbits of the Earth, STS-47 landed at Kennedy Space Center on September 20, 1992.

=== STS-60 ===
STS-60 was the second flight of Spacehab (Space Habitation Module) and the first flight of the Wake Shield Facility (WSF). Launched on February 3, 1994, this flight was the first Space Shuttle flight on which a Russian cosmonaut was a crew member. During the eight-day mission, her prime responsibility was to maneuver the WSF on the RMS, to conduct thin film crystal growth and she was also responsible for performing scientific experiments in the Spacehab. The STS-60 landed at Kennedy Space Center on February 11, 1994, after completing 130 orbits of the Earth.

=== STS-85 ===

Davis was the payload commander for STS-85, which was launched on &quot;Discovery&quot; on August 7, 1997. During this 12-day mission, Davis deployed and retrieved the CRISTA-SPAS payload, and operated the Japanese Manipulator Flight Demonstration (MFD) robotic arm. The mission also included several other scientific payloads for the conduct of research on astronomy, Earth sciences, life sciences, and materials science. The mission was accomplished in 189 Earth orbits, traveling 4.7 million miles. The STS-85 &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Kennedy Space Center on August 19, 1997.

== Later NASA career ==

After her flight on STS-85, Davis was assigned to NASA Headquarters as the Director of the Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS), Independent Assurance Office for the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance. In that position, Davis managed and directed independent assessments for the programs and projects assigned to the HEDS enterprise. In July 1999, she transferred to the Marshall Space Flight Center as Director of the Flight Projects Directorate, which was responsible for the International Space Station (ISS) Payload Operations Center, ISS hardware and the Chandra X-ray Observatory Program. After the accident, she was named head of Safety and Mission Assurance at Marshall, where she assured the safe return to flight of the Space Shuttle. Davis retired from NASA in 2005 and worked for Jacobs Engineering Group as a Vice President and Deputy General Manager. She currently works for Bastion Technologies, Inc. as the Safety and Mission Assurance Support Contract Program Manager at the Marshall Space Flight Center.

In 2023, Davis authored her first book &quot;Air Born - Two Generations in Flight&quot;, about her father who was a WWII B-17 pilot and POW, and her own space flight career, using comparisons of heir two careers. In 2024, she published a companion book to the first, &quot;Air Born - Artistic Musings of a WWII Pilot and POW,&quot; which includes her father&#x27;s POW Wartime Log and the 96 PENNY cartoon he drew for the Stalag Luft III newspaper.

== Personal life ==
Davis married fellow astronaut Mark C. Lee, in January 1991. They were the first married couple to fly together in space, joined in 2022 by Sharon and Marc Hagle on Blue Origin&#x27;s NS-20. They divorced in 1999.

She is married to former Judge Schuyler Richardson.
== Medals and honors ==
She has been awarded the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal in 1998, the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1995 and 2002, and the NASA Space Flight Medal in 1992, 1994, and 1997, the NASA Fellowship for Full-Time Study in 1983, the ASME National Old Guard Prize in 1978, the ASME Ralph Coates Roe Medal in 2001. She has been inducted to the Alabama Aviation Hall of Fame, the Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame, and the Presidential Rank Award of Meritorious Executive.

<text>Timothy P. Minear (; born October 29, 1963) is an American screenwriter and director. He has been nominated for four Emmy Awards (2013, 2014, 2015, 2017) for his role as an executive producer on &quot;American Horror Story&quot; and &quot;Feud&quot;.

==Life and career==
Minear was born in New York City, grew up in Whittier, California, and studied film at California State University, Long Beach.

Minear was an assistant director on the film &quot;Platoon&quot;, and wrote episodes for several television series including &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Zorro&quot;, and &quot;Lois and Clark&quot;. He later wrote, executive-produced, and directed episodes of &quot;Strange World&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot;, &quot;Wonderfalls&quot;, and &quot;The Inside&quot; (which he also created, with Howard Gordon).

Minear had another series, &quot;Drive&quot;, airing on Fox in April 2007; however&#x27; it was cancelled by the network after only four episodes. &quot;Drive&quot; was set to return with two additional episodes on July 4, 2007, but these were rescheduled to July 13 and then cancelled. This continued his tradition of short-lived work on Fox.

Tim Minear has worked on several shows that have lasted for only one season, including &quot;Strange World&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot;, &quot;Wonderfalls&quot;, &quot;The Inside&quot;, &quot;Drive&quot;, &quot;Terriers&quot;, and &quot;The Chicago Code&quot;. After nearly a decade of writing, and producing tv shows which lasted for a single season, the streak came to an end when he was hired to write and produce for Ryan Murphy&#x27;s &quot;American Horror Story&quot;. Because of all of the shows he has written and produced that lasted for only one season, he took the Twitter handle &quot;@CancelledAgain&quot; to mark his status as a writer/producer who was consistently in search of more work. 

Minear often works with Joss Whedon, and his work is typically characterized by a sharp, black humour and an ability to portray characters who are sympathetic and understandable, but morally ambiguous. Minear wrote the key episodes of &quot;Angel&quot; Season Two.

In 2004, Minear stated that he was hired to write a screenplay of &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;.

In 2007, he received a pilot commitment from ABC for &quot;Miracle Man&quot;, a drama series for which the company engaged in a bidding war with Fox Broadcasting Company. The series was being produced by 20th Century Fox Television, with which Minear had signed in an overall deal. Minear, since 2011, when American Horror Story (AHS) debuted, has been an executive producer for multiple successful shows for 20th Century Fox Television. These successful shows include AHS, as well as two shows Minear co-created, and showruns, &quot;9-1-1&quot;, and its spin-off &quot;9-1-1: Lone Star&quot;. All of these shows were co-created with Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. In 2018, his ReamWorks company signed a new Fox deal. Minear signed this deal to make sure the shows he had co-created at Fox with Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk would remain under their creative control, as Murphy had just recently left Fox to produce shows for Netflix.

<text>A laboratory notebook (&quot;colloq.&quot; lab notebook or lab book) is a primary record of research. Researchers use a lab notebook to document their hypotheses, experiments and initial analysis or interpretation of these experiments. The notebook serves as an organizational tool, a memory aid, and can also have a role in protecting any intellectual property that comes from the research.

==Structure==
The guidelines for lab notebooks vary widely between institution and between individual labs, but some guidelines are fairly common, for example, like those in the reference. The lab notebook is typically permanently bound and pages are numbered. Dates are given as a rule. All entries are with a permanent writing tool, e.g., a ballpoint pen (though a permanent marker may be undesirable, as the ink might bleed through multiple pages). The lab notebook is usually written as the experiments progress, rather than at a later date. In many laboratories, it is the original place of record of data (no copying is carried out from other notes) as well as any observations or insights. For data recorded by other means (e.g., on a computer), the lab notebook will record that the data was obtained and the identification of the data set will be given in the notebook. Many adhere to the concept that a lab notebook should be thought of as a diary of activities that are described in sufficient detail to allow another scientist to replicate the steps. In laboratories with several staff and a common laboratory notebook, entries in the notebook are signed by those making them.

==Legal aspects==
To ensure that data cannot be easily altered, notebooks with permanently bound pages are often recommended. Researchers are often encouraged to write only with unerasable pen, to sign and date each page, and to have their notebooks inspected periodically by another scientist who can read and understand it. All of these guidelines can be useful in proving exactly when a discovery was made, in the case of a patent dispute. However following March 2013, lab notebooks are of limited legal use in the United States, due to a change in the law that grants patents to the first person to file, rather than the first person to invent. The lab notebook is still useful for proving that work was not stolen, but can no longer be used to dispute the patent of an unrelated party.

==Electronic formats==
Several companies now offer electronic lab notebooks. This format has gained some popularity, especially in large pharmaceutical companies, which have large numbers of researchers and great need to document their experiments.

==Open lab notebooks==

Lab notebooks kept online have started to become as transparent to the world as they are to the researcher keeping them, a trend often referred to as Open Notebook Science, after the title of a 2006 blogpost by chemist Jean-Claude Bradley. The term is frequently used to distinguish this aspect of &quot;Open Science&quot; from the related but rather independent developments commonly labeled as &quot;open source&quot;, &quot;open access&quot;, &quot;open data&quot; and so forth. The openness of the notebook, then, specifically refers to the set of the following points, or elements thereof:
#Sharing of the researcher&#x27;s laboratory notebook online in real time without password protection or limitations on the use of the data.
#The raw data used by the researcher to derive observations and conclusions are made available online to anyone.
#All experimental data are shared, including failed or ambiguous attempts.
#Feedback and other contributions to the research effort can be integrated easily with the understanding that everything is donated to the public domain.
The use of a wiki makes it convenient to track contributions by individual authors.

<text>Cristian Vasile (May 8, 1908 – June 15, 1974) was a well-known Romanian tango-romance (&quot;Romanță&quot;) singer between 1928 and 1949, famous for songs such as &quot;Zaraza&quot;, &quot;Aprinde o țigară&quot;, &quot;Ce să-ți mai scriu&quot;, &quot;Pentru tine am făcut nebunii&quot;, and &quot;Nunuțo&quot;. He was born in Brăila, and died in 1974 in Sibiu.

His greatest success, the song &quot;Zaraza&quot;, that was said to refer to a Roma woman he was in love with at that time, was in fact an adapted version of a Uruguayan tango written in 1929 by Benjamín Alfonso Tagle Lara. A popular rumour surrounding the song says that Vasile&#x27;s lover was murdered by a rival singer, Zavaidoc, and her death caused Vasile to never sing again. Vasile did in fact abruptly stop his singing career, but a more credible explanation is that he lost his voice due to cancer. Although he was supposedly at odds with Zavaidoc, there is no proof that such a rivalry existed beyond mere rumours.

<text>Joseph Henry Blackburne (10 December 1841 – 1 September 1924) was a British chess player. Nicknamed &quot;The Black Death&quot;, he dominated the British scene during the latter part of the 19th century. Blackburne learned the game at the relatively late age of 17 or 18, but he quickly became a strong player and went on to develop a professional chess career that spanned over 50 years. At one point he was one of the world&#x27;s leading players, with a string of tournament victories behind him, and popularised chess by giving simultaneous and blindfold displays around the country. Blackburne also published a collection of his own games.

==Biography==
Joseph Henry Blackburne was born in Manchester in December 1841. He learned how to play draughts as a child, but when he was aged 17 or 18, he heard about Paul Morphy&#x27;s exploits around Europe, and he switched to playing chess:

Blackburne joined the Manchester Chess Club in 1861. In July 1861 he lost 5–0 in a match with Manchester&#x27;s strongest player, Eduard Pindar (and champion of the Provinces), but in August/September, Blackburne defeated Pindar (five wins, two draws, one loss). By the next year, Blackburne became champion of the city club, ahead of Bernhard Horwitz (who taught him endgame theory).

Blackburne&#x27;s introduction to blindfold chess was a little later. In November 1861, Louis Paulsen gave a simultaneous blindfold exhibition in Manchester, beating Blackburne among others; Blackburne was soon thereafter playing chess blindfolded with three players simultaneously.

Less than three years after learning the moves to chess, Blackburne entered the 1862 London International Tournament (the world&#x27;s first chess round-robin or all-play-all tournament) and defeated Wilhelm Steinitz in their individual game, although Blackburne finished in 9th place. Up to that point, timekeeping was measured with hourglasses, and it was Blackburne who suggested chess clocks. This trip cost Blackburne his job back in Manchester (accounts vary about what it was), and he became a professional chess player.

In the 1868–&#x27;69 season he won the British championship by beating the current holder, Cecil Valentine De Vere, and he was therefore regarded as England&#x27;s best player. His first major international success was in a strong tournament at Baden-Baden in 1870, where he shared 3rd place with Gustav Neumann, behind Adolf Anderssen and Wilhelm Steinitz but ahead of Paulsen, De Vere, Simon Winawer, Samuel Rosenthal and Johannes von Minckwitz.

Blackburne was regularly one of the world&#x27;s top five players from 1871 to 1889, although Steinitz, Emanuel Lasker and, during his brief prime, Johannes Zukertort were clearly better players; and he remained in the top 20 until 1902, when he was 61 years old. His best results were in international tournaments. Although tournaments were much less frequent then than they are now, Blackburne played in nearly one strong tournament per year from 1870 to 1899; in particular he competed regularly in the German Chess Championship, which was an open tournament. In the 1870s and 1880s he was almost always a high prize-winner. His best results were 1st equal with Steinitz at Vienna 1873, where the commentators nicknamed Blackburne &quot;the Black Death&quot; (Steinitz won the play-off); 1st in London 1876 with a score of 10/11, ahead of Zukertort; and 1st in Berlin 1881, 3 points ahead of Zukertort. He also achieved 2nd place in: a strong mini-tournament in London 1872 (behind Steinitz but ahead of Zukertort), George Alcock MacDonnell and De Vere; shared 2nd place at Hamburg 1885 (with Siegbert Tarrasch, James Mason, Berthold Englisch and Max Weiss; behind Isidor Gunsberg; ahead of George Henry Mackenzie and five others); shared 2nd place at Frankfurt 1887 (with Weiss; behind Mackenzie; ahead of Curt von Bardeleben, Tarrasch and several others). His worst result from this 20-year period was 6th place in the very strong Vienna 1882 chess tournament, the one occasion on which all his major rivals placed ahead of him.
In the mid to late 1890s Blackburne&#x27;s was less successful in tournaments, but by this time he was competing against the next generation of players, Emanuel Lasker and Lasker&#x27;s major rivals. Blackburne&#x27;s worst results were 10th place at Hastings 1895 and 11th at Nuremberg 1896; but both of these tournaments included Lasker and most of the other top players of the new generation; and in both of these he finished ahead of several of the new stars and ahead of the few competing players of his own generation.

Chessmetrics concludes that Blackburne&#x27;s best performances, taking account of the strength of his opponents, were his second places at Frankfurt 1887 (behind Mackenzie) and London 1892 (behind Emanuel Lasker). At London 1892 he finished only ½ point behind Emanuel Lasker and 2 points ahead of the third-placed player, Mason. Emanuel Lasker thought that Blackburne had more talent than Steinitz, but lacked the willpower and capacity for hard work needed for becoming world champion.

Blackburne&#x27;s match results are weaker. He was twice soundly beat by Steinitz, in 1862/3 (+1−7=2) and 1876 (+0−7=0); but in 1862 Blackburne had been playing chess for barely 3 years, and in 1876 Steinitz was playing at his life-time best and in the middle of a 24-game winning streak. Emanuel Lasker beat Blackburne in 1892, but Lasker also beat Steinitz very decisively in their 1894 championship match. Blackburne was also comfortably beaten in 1881 by Zukertort (+2−7=5), who was in great form at the time; and Zukertort&#x27;s health and play were declining rapidly when Blackburne beat him in 1887 (+5−1=7). On the other hand, against Gunsberg, Blackburne won his 1881 match (+7−4=3) and lost his 1887 match (+2−5=6); the 1887 match was Gunsberg&#x27;s strongest performance, and Gunsberg only narrowly lost a world title match against Steinitz in 1890 (+6−4=9).
The 1876 match against Steinitz was held at the West-end Chess Club in London. The stakes were £60 a side with the winner taking all. This was a considerable sum of money in Victorian times – £60 in 1876 would be roughly equivalent to £29,000 in 2006&#x27;s money. This was the first time that spectators were charged an entrance fee (half a guinea, = 52.5p in decimal terms) to see a chess match.
===Exhibitions and other games===
After losing his job and discovering that he had a special aptitude for blindfold chess, Blackburne began giving blindfold and simultaneous exhibitions all over Britain, and for most of his career made most of his income from these exhibitions, including blindfold displays against up to twelve opponents simultaneously. He even travelled to Australia in 1885 to give exhibitions; on his arrival in Melbourne he was fined five pounds for assaulting a fellow passenger on the ship.

The Teesside Chess Association (formed in 1883; now called the Cleveland Chess Association) invited world-class players to give exhibitions, in order to raise money for the Association. Blackburne&#x27;s fee for two simultaneous displays and a blindfold event in 1889 was 9 guineas (about £4,600 at 2006 values). Players paid the club a shilling for a simultaneous game or a half-crown to play him blindfold. In the simultaneous games he won 29, drew two and lost only one; in the blindfold he won seven and drew one with no losses.

In addition he played (mostly on top board) for the British team in 11 of the Anglo-American cable matches which commenced in 1896 and in the first six matches he recorded a score of 3½–2½ against the top American, Harry Pillsbury.

It is estimated that Blackburne played 100,000 games in his career, more than any other professional chess-player. However, he still had time to marry three times and with his second wife, Beatrice Lapham, he had a son, Julius, and with his third wife Mary Goodway (née Fox) another son, Frederick.

The dubious chess opening the Blackburne Shilling Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nd4) has been named for Blackburne because he purportedly used it to win quickly against amateurs, thus winning the shilling wagered on the game. The opening is mentioned by Steinitz in his book &quot;The Modern Chess Instructor&quot; (1889).

===Writings===
In 1899 he published &quot;Mr. Blackburne&#x27;s Games at Chess&quot;, edited by P. Anderson Graham.

Blackburne wrote two articles on chess for &quot;The Strand Magazine,&quot; in December 1906 and December 1907, and annotated numerous games for chess magazines, but he was never a chess correspondent for any publication.

===Final years===
In 1914, at the age of 72, Blackburne won a Special Brilliancy Prize for his win over Aron Nimzowitsch at the great St. Petersburg 1914 tournament, but failed to qualify for the final stage. That same year he tied for first place in the British championship with Frederick Yates, but ill health prevented him from contesting the play-off for the title. This was Blackburne&#x27;s last major tournament. However, in 1921 Blackburne was still giving simultaneous exhibitions.

In 1922 his wife died. Blackburne died of a heart attack on 1 September 1924 at the age of 82. He is buried in the Brockley and Ladywell Cemeteries in Lewisham.

==Legacy==

Blackburne is an icon of Romantic chess because of his wide-open and highly tactical style of play. His large black beard and aggressive style earned him the nickname of &quot;der Schwarze Tod&quot; (&quot;the Black Death&quot;, based on the plague of the same name) after his performance in the 1873 Vienna tournament. According to Chessmetrics, he was ranked second in the world at various times between 1873 and 1889. He was especially strong at endgames and had a great combinative ability which enabled him to win many brilliancy prizes. He was also widely known for his popular simultaneous and blindfold displays.

&quot;Mr. Blackburne&#x27;s Games at Chess&quot;, which he published in 1899, has been recently reprinted by Moravian Chess. It contains over 400 of his games, around 20 problems composed by him, and a short biography.

A new book about him was published by McFarland in August 2015. It contains over a thousand of his games and more than 50 problems with a detailed account of his life, family, and career.

<text>The year 1985 was proclaimed by the United Nations as the International Youth Year (IYY). It was held to focus attention on issues of concern to and relating to youth. The proclamation was signed on 1 January 1985, by United Nations Secretary General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar.

==Events==
Throughout the year, activities took place all over the world. These activities were coordinated by the Youth Secretariat within the Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs, at the time based at the UN offices in Vienna, Austria. The Secretariat&#x27;s director, Mohammad Sharif, was also the Executive Secretary for IYY. The President of IYY was Nicu Ceauşescu, son of the then dictator of Romania Nicolae Ceauşescu

While not organising any specific events itself, under the year&#x27;s slogan of &quot;Participation, Development, Peace&quot;, the IYY Secretariat helped facilitate numerous events helping to make IYY a success. On 11 October 1985, the Secretary-General of the UN, Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, in his report to the General Assembly, summarised the principal activities for IYY.

The main UN event for IYY was the World Congress on Youth (&quot;in Spanish&quot;: Congreso Mundial Sobre La Juventud) organised by UNESCO and held in Barcelona, Spain, 8–15 July 1985. It issued the &quot;Barcelona Declaration&quot; on youth.

Other international events mentioned in the Secretary General&#x27;s report (11 October 1985 A/40/701):
*International Youth Conference and World Youth Festival (Kingston, Jamaica, 6–10 April 1985). Issued the &quot;Kingston Declaration&quot; on youth.
*Friendly Gathering of Youth, (Beijing, China, 10–24 May 1985)
*12th World Festival of Youth and Students, (Moscow, USSR, 27 July–3 August 1985)
*International Youth Year Conference on Law (Montreal, 5–9 August 1985)

<doc id="512923" wikidata="Q539474" url="?curid=512923" title="Constantin Hansen">
<text>Carl Christian Constantin Hansen (Constantin Hansen) (3 November 1804 – 29 March 1880) was one of the painters associated with the Golden Age of Danish Painting. He was deeply interested in literature and mythology, and inspired by art historian Niels Laurits Høyen, he tried to recreate a national historical painting based on Norse mythology. He painted also many altarpieces and portraits, including the monumental oil painting &quot;The Danish Constituent Assembly&quot; (&quot;Den grundlovgivende Rigsforsamling&quot;) between 1861 and 1865.

== Early life ==
He was born in Rome, the son of portrait painter Hans Hansen. The family soon relocated to Vienna, where Constanze Mozart, the widow of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, became godmother at his christening and he was named after her. Within his first year, the family moved to Copenhagen, where he was raised.

== Education ==
He entered the architecture school of the Royal Danish Academy of Art (&quot;Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi&quot;) at 12 years of age, but changed his course of study to painting at the age of 21. He began his training under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg in 1828. He lost both his parents at about this time to typhus, and became the sole supporter of his younger sisters. He took over several commissions that had belonged to his father, including some copies to the Portrait Collection at Frederiksborg Palace and decorative paintings to Christiansborg Palace.

== Foreign study ==

In 1835 he received a two-year stipend to travel abroad, which was followed up by an additional year&#x27;s stipend. His travels took him through Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Nuremberg and Munich on his way to Italy, where he travelled extensively and stayed longer periods in Rome, Naples and Pompeii. In Italy he met fellow Dane, the sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. He travelled with other Danish artists, including Jørgen Roed, Christen Købke and decorative painter Georg Hilker (1807–1875).

The Copenhagen Art Union (&quot;Kunstforening&quot;) commissioned a painting from Hansen in 1837. He provided them with &quot;A Group of Danish Artists in Rome&quot;, (&quot;Et Selskab af danske Kunstnere i Rom&quot;). In addition he painted Italian folk scenes, and studies of Roman antiquities and architecture that reflect Eckersberg&#x27;s spirit.

After eight years in Italy he finally returned to Denmark, staying briefly in Munich, where he studied the technique of fresco painting, in anticipation of a commission, along with Georg Hilker, to decorate the University of Copenhagen&#x27;s vestibule on Frue Plads. This work continued from 1844 until 1853. Hansen painted the mythological figures, while Hilker painted the decorations and frameworks.

== Marriage ==
He married Magdalene Barbara Købke in 1846, and they had thirteen children. However, four children died within one year after being born and one of their sons, Hans Christian, was killed at the age of nineteen in a shipwreck.

In 1854 he was named professor at the Academy, but first became member of the Academy in 1864. One of his daughters, Elise Konstantin-Hansen, (1858–1946) became a recognized painter, and another Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen (1848–1925), became a tapestry weaver.

<text>The Beretta M1935 is a compact .32 ACP caliber blowback pistol that was manufactured by Italian firm Beretta.

== History ==
In the early 1930s, the Italian army was impressed by the Walther PP pistol. Beretta did not want to lose a big Italian military contract and designed the compact M1934 for the Italian army, which accepted it in 1937. The M1935 is simply an M1934, modified to fire .32 ACP ammunition.

== Specifications ==
The M1935 is a single-action semi-automatic blowback pistol that fires .32 ACP ammunition. It is constructed from carbon steel with plastic grips and is equipped with a frame safety that also acts as a take down lever and slide hold open. When the last shot has been fired the slide is retained open by the empty magazine and must be held open manually by the safety lever to reload the pistol. The magazine capacity is 8 rounds.

== Intended market ==
The M1935 was purpose built and designed for the Italian armed forces; however, it was also sold to the civilian market and issued to the German forces in 1944 and 1945.

== Design advantages ==
Fitted with the Beretta-style open slide, the M1935 has a very reliable feeding and extraction cycle. It was made with few parts and is very simple to maintain. The M1935 has a very robust construction with long service life if properly maintained.

== Limitations ==
The low magazine capacity of 8 rounds and short effective range reduces the M1935 to a last resort self-defense weapon. The slide is not of the self-catching type; the magazine retains the action to the rear. When the magazine is removed the action returns forward on an empty chamber. This slows down reloading of the pistol. However, if the safety is thumbed into the safe position it also acts as a slide catch, the magazine can then be released and a full magazine can be inserted, the slide release / safety can then be released, loading a round, then the pistol can now be fired in single action.

== Production ==
*From 1935 to 1967, about 525,000 units.
*Mod. 1935 cal. 7.65 / .32ACP
*Start / end of production from 1935 to 1967
**Quantity produced about 525,000
*Start - End -Serial numbers
**1935 - 1959 from about 410000 to 923048
**1962 - 1963 from A10001 to A14130
**1966 - 1967 from H14131 to H14673

== World War II prize guns ==
The Beretta M1935 was captured in huge numbers during World War II from Italian and German armed forces by allied soldiers, who liked it because of its small size, rugged design and good construction. Many of these captured pistols are operational to this day and widespread in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France and in the United Kingdom. The M1935 is compact and easy to hide, with ammunition available for it.

<text>The Lada Оkа (VAZ-1111, SeAZ-1111, КаmАZ-1111, Astro 11301) () is a city car designed in the Soviet Union in the later part of the seventies by AvtoVAZ. It entered production in 1988 powered by a SOHC two-cylinder engine. While developed at AutoVAZ by a team led by Yuri Kuteev, no production models were built there. Instead, manufacturing was outsourced to SeAZ factory in Serpukhov and ZMA in Naberezhnye Chelny (then owned by Kamaz and now owned by SeverstalAvto). Massive plans were in place for a new plant in Yelabuga, but these failed to materialize. The car was also produced in Azerbaijan by the Gyandzha Auto Plant. The name comes from the Oka River in Russia upon which Serpukhov is situated.

==History==

This affordable, lightweight and simple automobile replaced the air-cooled, rear-engined ZAZ Zaporozhets 966-968 series models as &quot;the people&#x27;s car&quot;. SeAZ factory specialized in building purpose-built vehicles for handicapped drivers and by the 1970s their offering was the S-3D, a spartan, boxy two-seat sedan powered by a motorcycle engine. Despite being noisy and smoky, the S-3D was, nevertheless, very popular with mobility-challenged drivers many of whom were World War II veterans and, being such, received their vehicles free of charge. When engineers in Serpukhov under factory manager Alexander Popov (who told &quot;Minavtoprom&quot; (the automotive ministry) SeAZ needed a new product) conceived the Oka, they turned to their VAZ colleagues for help. The project was approved in 1983. Prior to the Oka, VAZ designers had been working on a number of microcars, including a similar-looking variant of the VAZ-1101 offered by the designer Yuri Danilov in 1971, but those models did not go into production.


The tiny car was to be a replacement for the S-3D, and, like its predecessor, featured a simple motorcycle engine. Andrei Rozov, one of lead engine designers at VAZ, proposed a new three-cylinder engine, but, due to time constraints, that engine was not developed, and the decision was made to employ a two-cylinder variant of the VAZ-2108 four-cylinder engine by essentially chopping the latter in half. It was 1983, and the first Soviet front-wheel drive automobile, the 2108, was ready to hit the market. The Oka quickly became the next &quot;people&#x27;s car&quot; project, a vehicle that &quot;every factory engineer can afford&quot;.

The inspiration for Yuri Vereschagin, the VAZ exterior designer who penned the Oka, came from Japanese kei cars, such as the Daihatsu Cuore, which in turn, and along with the similar-looking Fiat Uno and the Fiat Panda, resembled the styling of the iconic French supermini Renault 5; the inspiration, however, was limited only to the size and overall proportions, and the car was different in design. The Soviet Ministry preferred the Oka over other three-door microcars designed by SeAZ and NAMI, as well as over a different, futuristic variant of the new car proposed by Vereschagin in 1984. Tightly restricted by project specifications, he did his work believing that his creation had little chance of seeing production.

In the event, however, he was proven wrong, as the Oka&#x27;s overall acceptable operating characteristics and low price resulted in some 700,000 examples rolling off the assembly line over a period of nearly two decades. During test drives on roads and in the Caucasus Mountains, the car proved to have good handling, roadholding and, surprisingly for a vehicle of its size, excellent off-road capabilities.

The first cars were made in December 1987

At the 1989 Moscow International Motor Show, VAZ exhibited a battery-electric version known as the VAZ-111E. The car was produced on a special-order basis until 1998. The 120 V worth of batteries were stored in the engine bay, beneath the seats and in the cargo bay, giving the car a range of approximately 100 km.

In 2002 the car was awarded zero stars out of a possible four by the Russian ARCAP safety assessment program; the version built in the ZMA factory was found to be marginally safer than the one built by SeAZ.

As of 2006, there were four versions of Oka distributed: basic VAZ-11113 Oka made by either ZMA (Naberezhnye Chelny) or SeAZ factory (33 hp, max, 3.2 litres per 100 km), &quot;custom&quot; VAZ-11301 Astro (49 hp) and VAZ-11113-27 Toyma - a light delivery vehicle with a cargo compartment instead of two rear seats.

Series production of the Oka ended in Russia in 2008, when SeAZ built the last batch of Okas with Chinese EURO-2 engines.

In the summer of 2023, the Russian government started talking about a possible revival of the brand.

==Usage==

Its road agility and acceleration rate (quite surprising for its appeal) prevented it from taking Zaporozhets&#x27; place in folklore (which takes its delight in the awkwardness and slow speed of the former).

Its small size and weight (635 kilograms), however, gave birth to a multitude of funny (and often true) stories involving several men carrying an Oka away from its parking place.

Special modifications for disabled people (missing one or both legs or one arm) were being distributed for free through the Soviet Union&#x27;s (and later Russia&#x27;s) social service system.

Like its brethren VW Beetle, it often attracts the sentiment of the owner, so various customised and tuned versions are often seen at local exotic car shows.

==United States==
As of 2019, an American company called Oka Auto USA owned by MIROX, and located in Las Vegas, Nevada, offered electrically powered Okas for the US &quot;neighborhood electric vehicle&quot; (NEV) market called the Oka NEV ZEV. To conform to NEV regulations, the electric Oka&#x27;s speed is limited to 25 mph.

<text>The Calf of Eday (; ) is an uninhabited island in Orkney, Scotland, lying north east of Eday. It is known for its wildlife and its prehistoric ruins.

==History==
There is a Neolithic chambered cairn in the southwest overlooking Calf Sound, which separates the island from Eday. Rectangular in shape, the cairn was excavated in 1936–37 and contains a small chamber with two compartments and a larger one with four stalls that has a separate entrance and was probably added at a later date. Two similar structures have been identified nearby along with various other ancient ruins.

From the 17th to the 19th centuries, the Calf of Eday was home to a salt works, the remains of which can still be seen to the north of cairns.

The pirate John Gow and his men successfully raided the Hall of Clestrain on 10 February 1725, but when they attempted to attack Carrick House on Eday, they ran aground on the Calf of Eday, where they were captured.

==Etymology==

The Norse gave animal names to some islands, especially to small islands alongside a larger one, other examples being the Calf of Man and the Horse of Copinsay. The islands name in Norse times was thus &quot;Kalfr&quot;. &quot;Eday&quot; is a name derived from the Old Norse &quot;eið&quot; and means &quot;isthmus island&quot;.

In the 17th century Eday was also known as &quot;Heth Øy&quot; and the Calf&#x27;s name is recorded by Blaeu as &quot;Calf of Heth Øy&quot;.

==Wildlife==
The dominant vegetation on the island is dry dwarf-shrub heath dominated by heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;), with smaller areas of wet heath, semi-improved grassland and coastal grassland. The Calf of Eday supports 32 species of breeding birds and is designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) for its importance as a nesting area. Gulls and cormorants (&quot;Phalacrocorax carbo&quot;) nest in the dry heath and grassland areas, whilst fulmars (&quot;Fulmarus glacialis&quot;), kittiwakes (&quot;Rissa tridactyla&quot;) and auks nest on the cliffs. The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports breeding seabirds.

<text>The Unification Church () is a new religious movement derived from Christianity, whose members are called Unificationists or sometimes informally Moonies. It was founded in 1954 by Sun Myung Moon in Seoul, South Korea, as the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (HSA-UWC; ); in 1994, the organization changed its name to the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification (FFWPU; ). It has a presence in approximately 100 countries around the world. Its leaders are Moon (prior to his death) and his wife, Hak Ja Han, whom their followers honor with the title &quot;True Parents.&quot;

Moon&#x27;s book, &quot;The Divine Principle&quot;, informs the beliefs of the Unification Church. Moon considered himself the Second Coming of Christ, claiming to complete the mission Jesus Christ was unable to because of his crucifixion: beginning a new ideal family, and a larger human lineage, free from sin. The Unification Church is well known for its mass weddings, known as &quot;Blessing&quot; ceremonies. It has been criticized for its teachings and for its social and political influence, with critics calling it a dangerous cult, a political powerhouse and a business empire. The group has been accused of excessive financial exploitation of its members. Its involvement in politics includes anti-communism and support for Korean reunification. Its members have founded, owned and supported related organizations in business, education, politics and more.

== Popular terminologies ==

Moon did not originally intend to found a separate organization or denomination, and did not give his group of followers its official name, Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (), until 1954. The informal name &quot;Unification Church&quot; () has been commonly used by members, the public and the news media. By 2018, the term &quot;Unification Movement&quot; was also widely used.

&quot;Moonie&quot;, the colloquial term for members, was first used in 1974 by some American media outlets. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Unification Church of the United States undertook an extensive public relations campaign against the use of the word by the news media.

Many Unification Church members consider the word &quot;Moonie&quot; derogatory, despite originally being received neutrally. In other contexts, it is not always considered pejorative, as Unification Church members have used the word – including the president of the Unification Theological Seminary David Kim, Bo Hi Pak, Moon&#x27;s aide and president of Little Angels Children&#x27;s Folk Ballet of Korea, and Moon himself.

Moon and his wife, Hak Ja Han, are regarded by Unificationists as &quot;True Father&quot; and &quot;True Mother,&quot; respectively, and as &quot;True Parents&quot; collectively.

== History ==
=== Background and origins ===

On February 25, 1920, Moon was born Mun Yong-myeong in Sangsa-ri (), Deogun-myon (), Jeongju-gun, North P&#x27;yŏng&#x27;an Province, at a time when Korea was under Japanese rule. His birthday was recorded as January 6 by the traditional lunar calendar (February 25, 1920, according to the Gregorian Calendar). Around 1930, his family, who followed traditional Confucianist beliefs, converted to Christianity and joined a Presbyterian Church, where he later taught Sunday school.

In 1945, Moon attended the Israel Monastery (Israel Jesus Church near Seoul) with his wife, Choi Sun-Kil (; &quot;Choe Seon-gil&quot;), to learn the teachings of , including his book &quot;The Fundamental Principles of Christianity&quot; (基督敎根本原理 drafted March 2, 1946, published March 2, 1958). After World War II and the Japanese rule ended in 1945, Moon began preaching. In 1946, Moon traveled alone to Pyongyang in Communist-ruled North Korea. He was arrested on allegations of spying for South Korea and given a five-year sentence to the Hŭngnam labor camp.

=== Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (1954–1994) ===

Moon founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (HSA-UWC) in Seoul on May 1, 1954. It expanded rapidly in South Korea and, by the end of 1955, had 30 centers nationwide. The HSA-UWC expanded throughout the world, with most members living in South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and other nations in East Asia. In the 1970s, American HSA-UWC members were noted for raising money for Unification Church projects.

In 1955 the HSA-UWC founded The Collegiate Association for the Research of Principles (CARP; ). According to CARP&#x27;s website, its goal is to promote &quot;intercultural, interracial, and international cooperation through the Unification world view.&quot; J. Isamu Yamamoto states in &quot;Unification Church&quot;: &quot;At times, CARP has been very subtle about its association with the Unification Church; however, the link between the two has always been strong since the purpose of both is to spread Moon&#x27;s teachings.&quot;

The HSA-UWC also sent missionaries to Europe. They entered Czechoslovakia in 1968 and remained underground until the 1990s. Unification movement activity in South America began in the 1970s with missionary work. Later, the HSA-UWC made large investments in civic organizations and business projects, including an international newspaper.

Starting in the 1990s, the HSA-UWC expanded in Russia and other former communist nations. Hak Ja Han, Moon&#x27;s wife, made a radio broadcast to the nation from the State Kremlin Palace. As of 1994, the HSA-UWC had about 5,000 members in Russia. About 500 Russian students had been sent to the US to participate in 40-day workshops.

Moon moved to the United States in 1971, although he remained a citizen of the Republic of Korea. In the 1970s, he gave a series of public speeches in the United States, including one in Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1974; two in 1976 in Yankee Stadium in New York City; and one on the grounds of the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., where he spoke on &quot;God&#x27;s Hope for America&quot; to 300,000 people. In 1975, the HSA-UWC held one of the largest peaceful gatherings in history, with 1.2 million people in Yeouido, South Korea.

In the 1970s, the Unification Church, along with some other new religious movements, became a target of the anti-cult movement. Activists have accused the movement of having &quot;brainwashed&quot; its members. In 1976, American Unification Church president Neil Albert Salonen met with Senator Bob Dole to defend the HSA-UWC against charges made by its critics, including the parents of some members.

The Unification Church&#x27;s involvement in the seafood industry began at the direction of Moon, who ordered an expansion into &quot;the oceanic providence.&quot; In 1976 and 1977 the Church invested nearly a million dollars into the United States seafood industry. Moon delivered a speech in 1980 entitled &quot;The Way of Tuna,&quot; in which he claimed that &quot;After we build the boats, we catch the fish and process them for the market, and then have a distribution network. This is not just on the drawing board; I have already done it.&quot; and declared himself the &quot;king of the ocean.&quot; He also suggested that they could get around the recently imposed 200 nautical miles exclusive economic zone by marrying American and Japanese members, allowing the Japanese ones to become American citizens, because once married, &quot;we are not foreigners; therefore Japanese brothers, particularly those matched to Americans, are becoming ... leaders for fishing and distribution.&quot; He also declared that &quot;Gloucester is almost a Moonie town now!&quot;

In 1976 UC members founded News World Communications, an international news media corporation. Its first two newspapers, &quot;The News World&quot; (later renamed the &quot;New York City Tribune&quot;) and the Spanish-language &quot;Noticias del Mundo,&quot; were published in New York from 1976 until the early 1990s. In 1982 &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;News World&quot; as &quot;the newspaper unit of the Unification Church.&quot; Moon&#x27;s son, Hyun Jin Moon, is its chairman of the board. News World Communications owns United Press International, &quot;The World and I&quot;, &quot;Tiempos del Mundo&quot; (Latin America), &quot;The Segye Ilbo&quot; (South Korea), &quot;The Sekai Nippo&quot; (Japan), the &quot;Zambezi Times&quot; (South Africa), &quot;The Middle East Times&quot; (Egypt). Until 2008 it published the Washington, D.C.–based newsmagazine &quot;Insight on the News&quot;. Until 2010, it owned &quot;The Washington Times&quot;. On November 2, 2010, Sun Myung Moon and a group of former &quot;Times&quot; editors purchased the paper from News World.

Starting in the 1980s, Moon instructed HSA-UWC members to take part in a program called &quot;Home Church&quot; in which they reached out to neighbors and community members through public service.

In April 1990, Moon visited the Soviet Union and met with President Mikhail Gorbachev. Moon expressed support for the political and economic transformations underway in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the movement was expanding into formerly communist nations.

The Women&#x27;s Federation for World Peace(세계평화여성연합, WFWP) was founded in 1992 by Hak Ja Han. Its stated purpose is to encourage women to work more actively to promote peace in their communities and society. It has members in 143 countries.

=== Family Federation for World Peace and Unification (1994–present) ===

On May 1, 1994 (the 40th anniversary of the founding of the HSA-UWC), Moon declared that the era of the HSA-UWC had ended and inaugurated a new organization: the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification (FFWPU) would include HSA-UWC members and members of other religious organizations working toward common goals, especially on issues of sexual morality and reconciliation between people of different religions, nations and races. The FFWPU co-sponsored Blessing ceremonies in which thousands of couples from other churches and religions were given the marriage blessing previously given only to HSA-UWC members.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the Church&#x27;s businesses expanded greatly and encountered significant success, leading to it becoming wealthy despite its declining number of members. In 1991 Moon announced that members should return to their hometowns, to undertake apostolic work there. Massimo Introvigne, who has studied the Unification Church and other new religious movements, said that this confirmed that full-time membership was no longer considered crucial to church members.

In 1994, &quot;The New York Times&quot; recognized the movement&#x27;s political influence, saying it was &quot;a theocratic powerhouse that is pouring foreign fortunes into conservative causes in the United States.&quot; In 1998, the Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; criticized Moon&#x27;s &quot;ultra-right leanings&quot; and suggested a personal relationship with conservative Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

In 1995, former U.S. President George H. W. Bush and his wife, Barbara Bush, spoke at an FFWPU event in the Tokyo Dome. Bush told the gathering: &quot;If as president I could have done one thing to have helped the country more, it would have been to do a better job in finding a way, either through speaking out or through raising a moral standard, to strengthen the American family.&quot; Hak Ja Han, the main speaker, credited her husband with bringing about the Fall of Communism and declared that he must save America from &quot;the destruction of the family and moral decay.&quot;

In 2000, Moon founded the World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (WANGO), which describes itself as &quot;a global organization whose mission is to serve its member organizations, strengthen and encourage the non-governmental sector as a whole, increase public understanding of the non-governmental community, and provide the mechanism and support needed for NGOs to connect, partner and multiply their contributions to solve humanity&#x27;s basic problems.&quot; It has been criticized for promoting conservatism in contrast to some of the ideals of the United Nations.

In 2000, the FFWPU co-sponsored the Million Family March, a rally in Washington, D.C., to celebrate family unity and racial and religious harmony, along with the Nation of Islam. Louis Farrakhan was the main speaker at the event which was held on October 16, 2000; the fifth anniversary of the Million Man March, which was also organized by Farrakhan. FFWPU leader Dan Fefferman wrote to his colleagues acknowledging that Farrakhan&#x27;s and Moon&#x27;s views differed on multiple issues but shared a view of a &quot;God-centered family.&quot;

In 2003, Korean FFWPU members started a political party in South Korea, &quot;The Party for God, Peace, Unification, and Home&quot; (). An inauguration declaration stated the new party would focus on preparing for Korean reunification by educating the public about God and peace. An FFWPU official said that similar political parties would be started in Japan and the United States. Since 2003, the FFWPU-related Universal Peace Federation&#x27;s Middle East Peace Initiative has been organizing group tours of Israel and Palestine to promote understanding, respect and reconciliation among Jews, Muslims and Christians.

===Moon&#x27;s death and divisions within the Unification Church===

On August 15, 2012, Moon was reported to be gravely ill and was put on a respirator at the intensive care unit of St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital at The Catholic University of Korea in Seoul. He was admitted on August 14, 2012, after suffering from pneumonia earlier in the month. He died there on September 3.

Soon after Moon&#x27;s death the Global Peace Foundation, which had been founded in 2009 by Moon and Han&#x27;s son Hyun Jin Moon and church leader Chung Hwan Kwak, distanced itself from the FFWPU, which is led by Han. In 2017 they also founded the Family Peace Association.

In 2014 Moon and Han&#x27;s younger sons Hyung Jin Moon and Kook-jin Moon founded the Rod of Iron Ministries (also known as the World Peace and Unification Sanctuary Church). It has been controversial for its advocacy of private ownership of firearms and for its support of the January 6 United States Capitol protest. The Unification Church has been struggling with severe financial difficulties following the death of Sun Myung Moon.

Since late July 2024, protests have at the entrance of Cheonjeonggung Palace in Gapyeong, starting with a rally calling for the resignation of Vice President Jung Won-joo. These protests have been started by the exposure of corruption involving key aides of the former head of the Unification Church Foundation, particularly those close to Han Hak Ja. From late September, the Unification Church Members&#x27; Emergency Response Committee and gatherings advocating for Jung&#x27;s resignation have held protests. By early October, demonstrations spread to major Unification Church sites, including Cheongshim Peace World Center in Gyeonggi&#x27;s Gapyeong and Cheonwon Temple in Yongsan, Seoul, demanding Jung&#x27;s resignation.

== Beliefs ==

Moon&#x27;s book, The Divine Principle, was, he claimed, revealed to him over a period of nine years after he claimed Jesus appeared to him on Easter Sunday 1936 on the mountainside and asked him to continue the work that he could not finish while he was on earth, due to the &quot;tragedy&quot; of his crucifixion. It was first published as (, ) in 1945. The earliest manuscript was lost in North Korea during the Korean War. A second, expanded version, (), or &quot;Explanation of the Divine Principle&quot;, was published in 1957. The or &quot;Exposition of the Divine Principle&quot; () is the main theological textbook of the movement. It was co-written by Sun Myung Moon and early disciple Hyo Won&#x27;eu and first published in 1966. A translation entitled &quot;Divine Principle&quot; was published in English in 1973. The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; lays out the core of Unification Church theology and is held by its believers to have the status of holy scripture. Following the format of systematic theology, it includes God&#x27;s purpose in creating human beings, the fall of man and restorationthe process through history by which God is working to remove the ill effects of the fall and restore humanity back to the relationship and position that God originally intended. David Václavík and Dušan Lužný described the details of those three points as follows:

# Principle of Creation: This first principle states that God created the world in his image. All of reality is then composed of bipolarities. The basic bipolarity is expressed by the terms (, – the inner, invisible aspect of the created world) and (, – the outer, visible aspect of the created world). In addition to this, there is another bipolarity, denoted by the terms &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;. The first-mentioned bipolarity of and reflects the relationship between soul (mind) and matter (body), while yin-yang reflects the relationship between femininity and masculinity. Hierarchy, described by the first principle (the basis of the four positions) then guarantees order in the world – God or higher purpose is placed highest, in the middle are man and woman, and finally, children are placed as the result. As Václavík and Lužný further characterize the doctrine, &quot;God is an absolute reality transcending time and space. The fundamental energy of God&#x27;s being is also eternal. By the action of this energy, entities enter into a relationship with each other, the basis of which is the activity of giving and receiving. The goal is to achieve a balanced and harmonious relationship of giving and receiving, i.e., love.&quot; According to the teachings of the Church, the highest level of relationship is the relationship with God. By properly developing the relationship of giving and receiving, it should be possible to achieve union with God. The goal of creation is then the realization of the kingdom of heaven, which can be achieved by fulfilling the three biblical blessings. Principle describes three blessings as follows. The first blessing concerns the nature of man: God created man in his own image. The second blessing was to be fulfilled through Adam and Eve by establishing an ideal family that was pure and loving, but they failed to do so. The third blessing concerns man&#x27;s position as a mediator between God and nature. Man is to master nature in order to perfect himself and nature itself and thus create the kingdom of heaven. Principle then describes three stages of growth of everything including man, namely, origin (formation), growth, and completion.
# The Fall of Man: according to the teaching of the Church, there was no fulfillment of God&#x27;s plan. God endowed man with free will and responsibility. Like everything in the universe, Adam and Eve went through three phases of development (origin, growth, and completion). This part describes that, before completion could occur, the orientation of the give-and-take relationship was reversed when Eve established a sexual relationship with Satan. Thus occurred the fall of man and the creation of a world &quot;with Satan at the center, and all men have become children of Satan.&quot; According to this belief, the world is from that time dominated by Satan&#x27;s lineage through the human race, and men with evil natures transmit evil. Through their children, they then create evil families and thus an evil world.
# The principle of restoration: According to the teaching of the Church, the primary purpose of creation was to build the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. This means that God will eventually save this sinful world and restore it to its original, sinless state. This is the basis of the principle of restoration. This is the perspective through which the Unification Church views the entire history of humanity. For the church, history is the history of restoration and of God&#x27;s efforts to save fallen men. At the end of this history, the Last Days are to come. Restoration teaches, that God has tried to end the sinful world and restore the original good world several times in human history. However, men have failed in their responsibility and thwarted God&#x27;s will. Doctrine claims that God made several such attempts: in the case of Noah, God first destroyed the sinful world with a flood, yet Noah&#x27;s second-born son Ham sinned again. Another attempt to restore the original sinless world was the coming of Jesus Christ when God sent the Messiah to establish the perfect family and thus create the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. Jesus did not fulfill this mission because he was crucified. Václavík and Lužný summarize: &quot;According to the doctrine of the Unification Church, we are currently living in the period of the Last Days, that is, the period of the Second Coming of Christ. However, today&#x27;s situation is very different from previous ones. For Christ will be successful at His Second Coming – God will send the &#x27;True Parents of humanity&#x27; and through them fulfill the purpose of creation. During the previous two thousand years, God has prepared, according to the principle of restoration, a suitable democratic, social, and legal environment that will protect Christ at the Second Coming.&quot;

Followers take as a starting point the truth of the Christian Old and New Testaments, with the &quot;Divine Principle&quot; an additional text that intends to interpret and &quot;fulfill&quot; the purpose of those older texts. Moon was intent on replacing worldwide forms of Christianity with his new unified vision of it, Moon being a self-declared messiah. Moon&#x27;s followers regard him as a separate person from Jesus but with a mission to basically continue and complete Jesus&#x27;s work in a new way, according to the &quot;Principle&quot;. The Unification Church regards a person&#x27;s destination after death as being dependent on how much one&#x27;s work during this life corresponds to its teachings. Moon&#x27;s followers believe in Apocatastasis, that everyone will eventually receive salvation.

In 1977, Frederick Sontag analyzed the teachings of the Divine Principle and summarized it in 12 concise points:

# God: Divine Principle teaches, that there is one living, eternal, and true God, a person beyond space and time, who has a perfect reason, emotion, and will, whose deepest heart essence is love, which includes both masculinity and femininity, a person who is the source of all truth, beauty, and goodness, and who is the creator and sustainer of man, the universe and all things visible and invisible. Man and the universe reflect his personality, character, and purpose.
# Man: Man was then created by God as a unique creature, made in his image as his children, like him in personality and character, and created with the capacity to respond to his love, to be a source of his joy, and to share his creativity.
# God&#x27;s desire for man and creation: To the relationship between God and Man, teaching states that God&#x27;s desire for man and creation is eternal and unchanging, God wants men and women to fulfill three things: First, each should grow to perfection so as to become one with God in heart, will, and action, so that their mind and body are united in perfect harmony centered on God&#x27;s love; second, to be united with God as husband and wife and give birth to God&#x27;s sinless children, thereby establishing a sinless family and ultimately a sinless world; third, to become masters of the created world, establishing loving dominion with him in a mutual relationship of giving and receiving. None of this happened because of human sin. Therefore, God&#x27;s present desire is to solve the sin problem and restore all these things, which will bring about the earthly and heavenly kingdom of God.
# Sin: The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; describes the origin of sin and the process of the fall of man. The first man and woman (Adam and Eve), before they became perfect, were tempted by the archangel Lucifer to illicit love. Because of this, Adam and Eve willfully turned away from God&#x27;s will and purpose, bringing spiritual death to themselves and the human race. As a result of this Fall, Satan usurped the position of the true father of mankind, so that all humans since then have been born in sin both physically and spiritually and have sinful tendencies. Therefore, human beings tend to resist God and his will and live in ignorance as to their true nature and parentage and all that they have lost thereby. Thus God suffers for lost children and a lost world and has had to constantly struggle to restore them to himself. Creation groans to give birth while waiting to be reunited through the true children of God.
# Christology: According to the &quot;Divine Principle&quot;, fallen humanity can only be restored to God through Christ (the Messiah) who comes as the new Adam to become the new head of the human race through whom humanity can be reborn into the family of God. In order for God to send the Messiah, mankind must fulfill certain conditions that restore, what was lost because of the Fall.
# History: The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; describes, that restoration is accomplished through the payment of the indemnity for a sin. Human history is then a record of God&#x27;s and man&#x27;s efforts to make this indemnity over time so that the conditions can be met and God can send the Messiah who comes to begin the final process of restoration. If some efforts fail in fulfilling the conditions of indemnity, they must be repeated, usually by another person after a period of time. This, according to the &quot;Divine Principle&quot;, is why history shows cyclical patterns. History culminates with the coming of the Messiah, which ends the old age and begins a new age.
# Resurrection: The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; explains resurrection as the process of restoration to spiritual life and spiritual maturity, ultimately uniting a person with God. It is the transition from spiritual death to spiritual life. This should be accomplished in part by human effort (through prayer, good works, etc.) with the help of the saints in the spirit world and completed by God&#x27;s effort to bring man to new birth through Christ (the Messiah).
# Predestination: According to the &quot;Divine Principle&quot;, God has predestined absolutely that all men will be restored to him and has chosen all men for salvation, but he has also given man a portion of responsibility (to be fulfilled by man&#x27;s free will) for the fulfillment of his original will and his will to bring about restoration. This responsibility remains permanently with man. God has predestined and called certain persons and groups of people to certain responsibilities. If these fail, others must fill their role and greater compensation must be made.
# Jesus: The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; teaches that Jesus of Nazareth came as the Christ, the second Adam, the only begotten Son of God. He became one with God, spoke God&#x27;s words, and did God&#x27;s works, thus showing God to men. However, people eventually rejected and crucified him, preventing him from building God&#x27;s kingdom on earth. The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; teaches that Jesus overcame Satan in the crucifixion and resurrection, making spiritual salvation possible for those who are born again through him and the Holy Spirit. The restoration of the Kingdom of God on earth awaits the Second Coming of Christ.
# The Bible: The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; offers an explanation of the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. Both should be the record of God&#x27;s progressive revelation to mankind. The purpose of the Bible, according to the Divine Principle, is to bring humanity to Christ and reveal to mankind the heart of God. The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; supports the Bible, as the truth is unique, eternal, and unchanging, so any new messages from God will be consistent with the Bible and will contain deeper explanations. The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; describes the current time as the last days when the new truth must be communicated by God (in the book &#x27;God&#x27;s Principle&#x27;) so that mankind will be able to finish what is still unfinished.
# The ultimate renewal: According to the &quot;Divine Principle&quot;, a proper understanding of theology focuses simultaneously on man&#x27;s relationship with God (vertical) and man&#x27;s relationship with his neighbor (horizontal). Man&#x27;s sin has disrupted both of these relationships and thus caused all the problems in the world. These problems will be solved through the restoration of man to God through Christ, as well as through such measures as establishing appropriate moral standards and practices, forming true families uniting all peoples and races (Oriental, Western, and African), resolving the tension between science and religion, correcting economic, racial, political, and educational injustices, and overcoming God-denying ideologies such as Communism.
# The Second Coming (Eschatology): The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; teaches that Christ&#x27;s Second Coming will occur in this age, which would be similar to the time of his First Coming. Christ should come as before, that is, as a man in the flesh. By marrying his bride in the flesh, he will establish a family and thus become the True Parents of all mankind. Through accepting the &#x27;True Parents&#x27; () (the Second Coming of Christ), obeying them, and following them, the original sin of mankind would be removed and people can eventually become perfect. In this way, true families fulfilling God&#x27;s ideal will begin, and the Kingdom of God&#x27;s will should be established both on earth and in heaven. According to the Divine Principle, this day is now at hand in the person of Sun Myung Moon.

== Traditions ==

=== Blessing ceremony ===

The Unification Church is well known for its Blessing tradition: a mass wedding ceremony () and wedding vow renewal ceremony. It is given to engaged or married couples. According to the Church&#x27;s belief in a serpent seed interpretation of original sin and the Fall of Man, Eve was sexually seduced by Satan (the serpent) and thus the human bloodline is sinful due to being directly descended from Satan. Through the Blessing, members believe, the couple is removed from the lineage of sinful humanity and restored back into God&#x27;s sinless lineage.

The first Blessing ceremony was held in 1961 for 36 couples in Seoul, South Korea by the Moons shortly after their own marriage in 1960. All the couples were members of the church. Moon matched all of the couples except 12 who were already married to each other before joining the church. This was Moon&#x27;s second marriage. In 1945 he married Sun Kil Choi. They had a son in 1946 and divorced in 1954.

Later Blessing ceremonies were larger in scale but followed the same pattern. All participants were HSA-UWC members and Moon matched most of the couples. In 1982 the first large-scale Blessing (of 2,000 couples) outside of Korea took place in Madison Square Garden, New York City. In 1988, Moon matched 2,500 Korean members with Japanese members for a Blessing ceremony held in Korea, partly in order to promote unity between the two nations.

Moon&#x27;s practice of matching couples was very unusual in both Christian tradition and modern Western culture and attracted much attention and controversy. The Blessing ceremonies have attracted a lot of attention in the press and in the public imagination, often being labeled &quot;mass weddings.&quot; However, in most cases, the Blessing ceremony is not a legal wedding ceremony. Some couples are already married and those that are engaged are later legally married according to the laws of their own countries. &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to a 1997 ceremony for 28,000 couples as a &quot;marriage affirmation ceremony,&quot; adding: &quot;The real weddings were held later in separate legal ceremonies.&quot;

Mary Farrell Bednarowski says that marriage is &quot;really the only sacrament&quot; in the Unification movement. Unificationists therefore view singleness as &quot;not a state to be sought or cultivated&quot; but as preparation for marriage. Pre-marital celibacy and marital faithfulness are emphasized. Adherents may be taught to &quot;abstain from intimate relations for a specified time after marriage.&quot; The church does not give its marriage blessing to same-sex couples.
Moon has emphasized the similarity between Unification views of sexuality and evangelical Christianity, &quot;reaching out to conservative Christians in this country in the last few years by emphasizing shared goals like support for sexual abstinence outside of marriage, and opposition to homosexuality.&quot; Since 2001 couples Blessed by Moon have been able to arrange marriages for their own children, without his direct guidance. Also, some Unification Church members have married partners who are not church members.

== Scholarly studies ==

In the early 1960s, John Lofland lived with HSA-UWC missionary Young Oon Kim and a small group of American members and studied their promotional and proselytization activities. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other membersoften family relationships. Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled &quot;The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes,&quot; and in a 1966 book by Prentice-Hall, &quot;Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith.&quot;

In 1977, Frederick Sontag, a professor of philosophy at Pomona College and a minister in the United Church of Christ, spent 10 months visiting HSA-UWC members in North America, Europe and Asia, as well as interviewing Moon at his home in New York State. He reported his findings and observations in &quot;Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church&quot;, published by Abingdon Press. The book also provides an overview of the &quot;Divine Principle&quot;. In an interview with UPI, Sontag compared the HSA-UWC with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and said that he expects its practices to conform more to mainstream American society as its members become more mature. He added that he did not want to be considered an apologist but that a close look at HSA-UWC&#x27;s theology is important: &quot;They raise some incredibly interesting issues.&quot;

In 1984, Eileen Barker published &quot;The Making of a Moonie&quot; based on her seven-year study of HSA-UWC members in the United Kingdom and the United States. In 2006, Laurence Iannaccone of George Mason University, a specialist in the economics of religion, wrote that &quot;The Making of a Moonie&quot; was &quot;one of the most comprehensive and influential studies&quot; of the process of conversion to new religious movements. Australian psychologist Len Oakes and British psychiatry professor Anthony Storr, who have written rather critically about cults, gurus, new religious movements, and their leaders have praised &quot;The Making of a Moonie&quot;. It was given the Distinguished Book Award in 1985 by the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion. In 1997 Barker reported that Unificationists had mostly undergone a transformation in their worldview from millennialism to utopianism.

In 1998, Irving Louis Horowitz, a sociologist, questioned the relationship between the HSA-UWC and scholars whom it paid to conduct research on its behalf.

== Relations with other religions ==

=== Judaism ===

Unificationism holds that the Jewish people as a whole were prepared by God to receive the Messiah in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, with John the Baptist tasked from birth with the mission to lead the Jewish people to Jesus, but failed in his mission. According to the &quot;Divine Principle&quot;, the Jews went through a &quot;course of indemnity&quot; due to the failure of John the Baptist to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, in spite of publicly testifying to him at the Jordan River, whilst receiving the baptism.

In 1976, the American Jewish Committee released a report by Rabbi A. James Rudin which stated that the &quot;Divine Principle&quot; contained &quot;pejorative language, stereotyped imagery, and accusations of collective sin and guilt.&quot; In a news conference that was presented by the AJC and representatives of Catholic and Protestant churches, panelists stated that the text &quot;contained over 125 anti-Jewish references.&quot; They also cited Moon&#x27;s recent and public condemnation of &quot;antisemitic and anti-Christian attitudes,&quot; and called upon him to make a &quot;comprehensive and systematic removal&quot; of antisemitic and anti-Christian references in the &quot;Divine Principle&quot; as a demonstration of good faith.

In 1977, the HSA-UWC issued a rebuttal to the report, stating that it was neither comprehensive nor reconciliatory, instead, it had a &quot;hateful tone&quot; and it was filled with &quot;sweeping denunciations.&quot; It denied that the &quot;Divine Principle&quot; teaches antisemitism and gave detailed responses to 17 specific allegations which were contained in the AJC&#x27;s report, stating that the allegations were distortions of teachings and obscurations of the real content of passages or the passages were accurate summaries of Jewish scriptures or New Testament passages.

In 1984, Mose Durst, then the president of the Unification Church of the United States as well as a convert from Judaism, said that the Jewish community had been &quot;hateful&quot; in its response to the growth of the Unification movement and he also placed blame on the community&#x27;s &quot;insecurity&quot; and Unification Church members&#x27; &quot;youthful zeal and ignorance.&quot; Rudin, then the national interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish Committee, said that Durst&#x27;s remarks were inaccurate and unfair and he also said that &quot;hateful is a harsh word to use.&quot; In the same year, Durst wrote in his autobiography: &quot;Our relations with the Jewish community have been the most painful to me personally. I say this with a heavy heart since I was raised in the Jewish faith and am proud of my heritage.&quot;

In 1989, Unification Church leaders Peter Ross and Andrew Wilson issued &quot;Guidelines for Members of The Unification Church in Relations with the Jewish People&quot; which stated: &quot;In the past there have been serious misunderstandings between Judaism and the Unification Church. In order to clarify these difficulties and guide Unification Church members in their relations with Jews, the Unification Church suggests the following guidelines.&quot; In 2008, the &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot; described the statements and guidelines arising from mutual contacts as &quot;excellent.&quot;

=== Christianity ===

Protestant commentators have criticized Unification Church teachings as being contrary to the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone. In their influential book &quot;The Kingdom of the Cults&quot; (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the &quot;Divine Principle&quot; on the issues of Christology, the virgin birth of Jesus, the movement&#x27;s belief that Jesus should have married, the necessity of the crucifixion of Jesus, and a literal resurrection of Jesus, as well as a literal Second Coming.

In 1974 Moon founded the Unification Theological Seminary, in Barrytown, New York, partly in order to improve relations of the movement with other churches. Professors from other denominations, including a Methodist minister, a Presbyterian and a Roman Catholic priest, as well as a rabbi, were hired to teach religious studies to the students, who were being trained as leaders in the movement.

In 1977, Unification member Jonathan Wells, who later became well known as the author of the popular Intelligent Design book &quot;Icons of Evolution&quot;, defended Unification theology against what he said were unfair criticisms by the National Council of Churches. That same year Frederick Sontag, a professor of philosophy at Pomona College and a minister in the United Church of Christ, published &quot;Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church&quot; which gave an overview of the movement and urged Christians to take it more seriously.

In the 1980s the Unification Church sent thousands of American ministers from other churches on trips to Japan and South Korea to inform them about Unification teachings. At least one minister was dismissed by his congregation for taking part. In 1994 the church had about 5,000 members in Russia and came under criticism from the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1997, the Russian government passed a law requiring the movement and other non-Russian religions to register their congregations and submit to tight controls.

In 1982, Moon was imprisoned in the United States after being found guilty by a jury of willfully filing false Federal income tax returns and conspiracy. (See: &quot;United States v. Sun Myung Moon&quot;) HSA-UWC members launched a public relations campaign. Booklets, letters and videotapes were mailed to approximately 300,000 Christian leaders in the United States. Many of them signed petitions protesting the government&#x27;s case. The American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A., the National Council of Churches, the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference filed briefs in support of Moon.

In 1995 the Unification Movement related organization the Women&#x27;s Federation for World Peace indirectly contributed to help Baptist Liberty University which at that time was in financial difficulty. This was reported in the United States news media as an example of closer relationships between the movement and conservative Christian congregations.

=== Islam ===

The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; lists the Muslim world as one of the world&#x27;s four major divisions (the others being East Asia, Hindu and Christendom). Unification movement support for Islamist anti-communists came to public attention in 1987 when church member Lee Shapiro was killed in Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War while filming a documentary. The resistance group they were traveling with reported that they had been ambushed by military forces of the Soviet Union or the Afghan government. However, the details have been questioned, partly because of the poor reputation of the group&#x27;s leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.

The Muslim advocacy group Council on American–Islamic Relations listed &quot;The Washington Times&quot; among media outlets it said &quot;regularly demonstrates or supports Islamophobic themes.&quot; In 1998, the Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; wrote that its editorial policy was &quot;rabidly anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and pro-Israel.&quot; In 1997, the &quot;Washington Report on Middle East Affairs&quot; (which is critical of United States and Israeli policies), praised &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and the &quot;Times&quot;″ sister publication &quot;The Middle East Times&quot; (along with &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; owned by the Church of Christ, Scientist) for their objective and informative coverage of Islam and the Middle East, while criticizing the &quot;Times&quot; generally pro-Israel editorial policy. The &quot;Report&quot; suggested that these newspapers, being owned by religious organizations, were less influenced by pro-Israel pressure groups in the United States.

In 2000 the FFWPU co-sponsored the Million Family March, a rally in Washington, D.C., to celebrate family unity and racial and religious harmony, along with the Nation of Islam. Louis Farrakhan, the leader of The Nation of Islam, was the main speaker at the event which was held on October 16, 2000; the fifth anniversary of the Million Man March, which was also organized by Farrakhan. Unification Church leader Dan Fefferman wrote to his colleagues acknowledging that Farrakhan&#x27;s and Moon&#x27;s views differed on multiple issues but shared a view of a &quot;God-centered family.&quot; In 2007 Rev and Mrs Moon sent greetings to Farrakhan while he was recovering from cancer, saying: &quot;We send love and greetings to Minister Farrakhan and Mother Khadijah.&quot;

In the 1990s and 2000s, the Unification Movement made public statements claiming communications with the spirits of religious leaders including Muhammad and also Confucius, the Buddha, Jesus and Augustine, as well as political leaders such as Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Leon Trotsky, Mao Zedong and many more. This was reported to have distanced the movement from Islam as well as from mainstream Christianity.

From 2001 to 2009 the Unification movement owned the American Life TV Network (now known as Youtoo TV), which in 2007 broadcast George Clooney&#x27;s documentary &quot;A Journey to Darfur&quot;, which was harshly critical of Islamists in Darfur, the Republic of Sudan. It released the film on DVD in 2008 and announced that proceeds from its sale would be donated to the International Rescue Committee.

In his 2009 autobiography, Moon praised Islam and expressed the hope that there would be more understanding between different religious communities. In 2011, representatives of the Unification Church took part in an international seminar which was held in Taiwan by the Muslim World League. The stated purpose of the seminar was to encourage interfaith dialogue and discourage people from resorting to terrorism.

=== Interfaith activities ===

In 2009 the FFWPU held an interfaith event in the Congress of the Republic of Peru. Former president of the Congress Marcial Ayaipoma and other notable politicians were called &quot;Ambassadors for Peace&quot; of the Unification Church. In 2010, the church built a large interfaith temple in Seoul. Author Deepak Chopra was the keynote speaker at an interfaith event of the Unification Church co-hosted with the United Nations at the headquarters of the United Nations. In 2011, an interfaith event was held at the National Assembly of Thailand, the President of the National Assembly of Thailand attended the event.

In 2012, the Unification movement affiliated-Universal Peace Federation held an interfaith dialogue in Italy that was co-sponsored by the United Nations. That year, the Universal Peace Federation held an interfaith program for representatives of 12 various religions and confessions in the hall of the United Nations General Assembly. The President of the United Nations General Assembly, the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations and other UN officials spoke.

== Science ==

The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; calls for the unification of science and religion: &quot;Religion and science, each in their own spheres, have been the methods of searching for truth in order to conquer ignorance and attain knowledge. Eventually, the way of religion and the way of science should be integrated and their problems resolved in one united undertaking; the two aspects of truth, internal and external, should develop in full consonance.&quot;

In the 1970s and 1980s, the Unification Movement sponsored the International Conference on the Unity of the Sciences (ICUS), in order to promote the concept of the unity of science and religion. American news media have suggested that the conferences were also an attempt to improve the often controversial public image of the church. The first conference, held in 1972, had 20 participants; while the largest conference, in Seoul, South Korea in 1982, had 808 participants from over 100 countries. Participants in one or more of the conferences included Nobel laureates John Eccles (Physiology or Medicine 1963, who chaired the 1976 conference) and Eugene Wigner (Physics 1963).

The relationship between the Unification Movement and science again came to public attention in 2002 with the publication of &quot;Icons of Evolution&quot;, a popular book critical of the teaching of evolution written by member Jonathan Wells. Wells is a graduate of the Unification Theological Seminary and has been active with the Discovery Institute as an advocate for intelligent design.

== Political activism ==


===Anti-communism===
In the 1940s, Moon cooperated with Communist Party members in support of the Korean independence movement against Imperial Japan. After the Korean War (1950–1953), he became an outspoken anti-communist. Moon viewed the Cold War between liberal democracy and communism as the final conflict between God and Satan, with divided Korea as its primary front line. Soon after its founding, the Unification movement began supporting anti-communist organizations, including the World League for Freedom and Democracy founded in 1966 in Taipei, Republic of China (Taiwan), by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Korean Culture and Freedom Foundation, an international public diplomacy organization which also sponsored Radio Free Asia.

The Unification movement was criticized for its anti-communist activism by the mainstream media and the alternative press, many of whose members said that it could lead to World War Three and a nuclear holocaust. The movement&#x27;s anti-communist activities received financial support from Japanese millionaire and activist Ryōichi Sasakawa.

In 1972, Moon predicted the decline of communism, based on the teachings of the &quot;Divine Principle&quot;: &quot;After 7,000 biblical years – 6,000 years of restoration history plus the millennium, the time of completion – communism will fall in its 70th year. Here is the meaning of the year 1978. Communism, begun in 1917, could maintain itself for approximately 60 years and reach its peak. So 1978 is the borderline and afterward, communism will decline; in the 70th year, it will be altogether ruined. This is true. Therefore, now is the time for people who are studying communism to abandon it.&quot;

In 1973, Moon called for an &quot;automatic theocracy&quot; to replace communism and solve &quot;every political and economic situation in every field.&quot; In 1975, Moon spoke at a government-sponsored rally against potential North Korean military aggression on Yeouido Island in Seoul to an audience of around 1 million.

In 1976, Moon established News World Communications, an international news media conglomerate that publishes &quot;The Washington Times&quot; newspaper in Washington, D.C., and newspapers in South Korea, Japan and South America, partly in order to promote political conservatism. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;the &quot;Times&quot; was established by Moon to combat communism and be a conservative alternative to what he perceived as the liberal bias of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.&quot; Bo Hi Pak, called Moon&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man,&quot; was the founding president and the founding chairman of the board. Moon asked Richard L. Rubenstein, a rabbi and college professor, to join its board of directors. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; has often been noted for its generally pro-Israel editorial policies. In 2002, during the 20th anniversary party for the &quot;Times&quot;, Moon said: &quot;The &quot;Washington Times&quot; will become the instrument in spreading the truth about God to the world.&quot;

In 1980, members founded CAUSA International, an anti-communist educational organization based in New York City. In the 1980s, it was active in 21 countries. In the United States, it sponsored educational conferences for evangelical and fundamentalist Christian leaders as well as seminars and conferences for Senate staffers, Hispanic Americans and conservative activists. In 1986, CAUSA International sponsored the documentary film &quot;Nicaragua Was Our Home&quot;, about the Miskito Indians of Nicaragua and their persecution at the hands of the Nicaraguan government. It was filmed and produced by USA-UWC member Lee Shapiro, who later died while filming with anti-Soviet forces during the Soviet–Afghan War. At this time CAUSA International also directly assisted the United States Central Intelligence Agency in supplying the Contras, in addition to paying for flights by rebel leaders. CAUSA&#x27;s aid to the Contras escalated after Congress cut off CIA funding for them. According to contemporary CIA reports, supplies for the anti-Sandinista forces and their families came from a variety of sources in the US ranging from Moon&#x27;s Unification Church to U.S. politicians, evangelical groups and former military officers.

In 1980, members in Washington, D.C., disrupted a protest rally against the United States military draft. In 1981, the Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court ruled that the HSA–UWC was not entitled to property tax exemptions on its New York City properties since its primary purpose was political, not religious. In 1982, this ruling was overturned by the New York State Supreme Court itself, which ruled that it should be considered a religious organization for tax purposes.

In 1983, some American members joined a public protest against the Soviet Union in response to its shooting down of Korean Airlines Flight 007. In 1984, the HSA–UWC founded the Washington Institute for Values in Public Policy, a Washington, D.C. think tank that underwrites conservative-oriented research and seminars at Stanford University, the University of Chicago and other institutions. In the same year, member Dan Fefferman founded the International Coalition for Religious Freedom (ICRF Japanese name: 国際宗教自由連合) in Virginia, which is active in protesting what it considers to be threats to religious freedom by governmental agencies.

In August 1985, the Professors World Peace Academy, an organization founded by Moon, sponsored a conference in Geneva to debate the theme &quot;The situation in the world after the fall of the communist empire.&quot; After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 the Unification movement promoted extensive missionary work in Russia and other former Soviet nations.

=== Korean unification ===

In 1991, Moon met with Kim Il Sung, the North Korean president, to discuss ways to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula, as well as on international relations, tourism and other topics. In 1992, Kim gave his first and only interview with the Western news media to &quot;Washington Times&quot; reporter Josette Sheeran, who later became executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme. In 1994, Moon was officially invited to Kim&#x27;s funeral, in spite of the absence of diplomatic relations between North Korea and South Korea.

In 1998, Unification movement-related businesses launched operations in North Korea with the approval of the government of South Korea, which had prohibited business relationships between North and South before. In 2000, the church-associated business group Tongil Group founded Pyeonghwa Motors in the North Korean port of Nampo, in cooperation with the North Korean government. It was the first automobile factory in North Korea.

During the presidency of George W. Bush, Dong Moon Joo, a Unification movement member and then president of &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, undertook unofficial diplomatic missions to North Korea in an effort to improve its relationship with the United States. Joo was born in North Korea and is a citizen of the United States.

In 2003, Korean Unification Movement members started a political party in South Korea. It was named The Party for God, Peace, Unification and Home. In its inauguration declaration, the new party said it would focus on preparing for Korean reunification by educating the public about God and peace. Moon was a member of the Honorary Committee of the Unification Ministry of the Republic of Korea. Church member Jae-jung Lee was a Unification Minister of South Korea.

In 2010, in Pyongyang, to mark the 20th anniversary of Moon&#x27;s visit to Kim Il Sung, &quot;de jure&quot; head of state Kim Yong-nam hosted Moon&#x27;s son Hyung Jin Moon, then the president of the Unification Church, in his official residence. At that time, Hyung Jin Moon donated 600 tons of flour to the children of Jeongju, the birthplace of Sun Myung Moon.

In 2012, Moon was posthumously awarded North Korea&#x27;s National Reunification Prize. On the first anniversary of Moon&#x27;s death, North Korean chairman Kim Jong Un expressed condolences to Han and the family, saying: &quot;Kim Jong-un prayed for the repose of Moon, who worked hard for national concord, prosperity and reunification and world peace.&quot;

In 2017, the Unification Church sponsored the International Association of Parliamentarians for Peace (IAPP) – headed by former prime minister of Nepal Madhav Kumar Nepal and former minister of peace and reconstruction Ek Nath Dhakal – visited Pyongyang and had constructive talks with the Korean Workers&#x27; Party. In 2020 the movement held an in-person and virtual rally for Korean unification which drew about one million attendees.

===Other political positions===
Moon was a member of the Honorary Committee of the Unification Ministry of the Republic of Korea. The church member Jae-jung Lee had been once a unification minister of South Korea. Another, Ek Nath Dhakal, is a member of the Nepalese Constituent Assembly, and the first Minister for Co-operatives and Poverty Alleviation Ministry of the Government of Nepal. In 2016, a study sponsored by the Unification Theological Seminary found that American members were divided in their choices in the 2016 United States presidential election, with the largest bloc supporting Senator Bernie Sanders.

Hak Ja Han has been acting as a leader and public spokesperson for the movement. In 2019, she spoke at a rally in Japan and called for greater understanding and cooperation between the Pacific Rim nations. In 2020, she spoke at a UPF-sponsored in-person and virtual rally for Korean unification, which drew about one million attendees. In 2020 former Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon received the Sunhak Peace Prize, which is sponsored by the Unification Church and an award of .

In 2021, Donald Trump and Shinzo Abe gave speeches at the Rally of Hope event hosted by an affiliate of the Unification Church. , five ministers of the Cabinet of Japan had relationships with the Unification Church, including the Minister of Health, Labour, and Welfare and the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.

== Criticism ==
=== Criticisms of Moon ===

Moon&#x27;s claim to be the Messiah and the Second Coming of Christ has been rejected by both Jewish and Christian scholars. Protestant commentators have criticized Moon&#x27;s teachings as being contrary to the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone. In their influential book &quot;The Kingdom of the Cults&quot; (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the &quot;Divine Principle&quot; on the issues of the divinity of Christ, the virgin birth of Jesus, Moon&#x27;s belief that Jesus should have married, the necessity of the crucifixion of Jesus, a literal resurrection of Jesus, as well as a literal second coming of Jesus.

Commentators have criticized the &quot;Divine Principle&quot; for saying that the First World War, the Second World War, the Holocaust, and the Cold War served as indemnity conditions to prepare the world for the establishment of the Kingdom of God.

In 1998, journalist Peter Maass, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, reported that some Unification members complained about Blessing being given to non-members who had not gone through the same course that members had. In 2000, Moon was criticized, including by some members of his church, for his support of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan&#x27;s Million Family March.

Moon was also criticized for his relationship with Jewish scholar Richard L. Rubenstein, an advocate of the &quot;death of God theology&quot; of the 1960s. Rubenstein was a defender of the Unification Church and served on its advisory council, as well as on the board of directors of the church-owned &quot;Washington Times&quot; newspaper. In the 1990s, he served as president of the University of Bridgeport, which was then affiliated with the church.

In 1998, the Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; criticized Moon&#x27;s possible relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and wrote that the &quot;Washington Times&quot; editorial policy was &quot;rabidly anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and pro-Israel.&quot;

Moon has been accused of advocating a worldwide &quot;automatic theocracy&quot;, based on a poorly translated speech.

He has also been criticized for advising his followers to become &quot;crazy for God.&quot;

===Theological disputes with Christianity===
====Fall of Man and view of Jesus====

Central to Unification teachings is the concept that the Fall of Man was caused by the literal mating of Eve and Satan in the Garden of Eden, which contaminated the whole human race with sin. According to the religion, humanity can only be restored to God through a messiah who comes as a new Adam: a new head of the human race, replacing the sinful parents and siring new children free from Satanic influence. In the Unification Church, Jesus is this messiah, just as he is a messianic figure in more mainstream Christianity; however, since Jesus was prematurely killed before he could start a new sinless family, Moon claims he himself was called upon by God to fulfill Jesus&#x27; unresolved mission.

In 1980, Unification theologian Young Oon Kim wrote:
The Unification view of Jesus has been criticized by mainstream Christian authors and theologians. In their influential book &quot;The Kingdom of the Cults&quot; (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the &quot;Divine Principle&quot; on the issues of the divinity of Christ, the virgin birth of Jesus, the Unification Church&#x27;s belief that Jesus should have married and a literal resurrection of Jesus as well as a literal Second Coming. They add: &quot;Moon makes all men equal in &quot;divinity&quot; to Jesus, thereby striking a blow at the uniqueness of Christ.&quot;

The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; states on this point:
Unificationist theologian Young Oon Kim wrote, and some members of the Unification movement believe, that Zechariah was the father of Jesus, based on the work of Leslie Weatherhead, an English Christian theologian in the liberal Protestant tradition.

==== Indemnity ====

Indemnity, in the context of Unification theology, is a part of the process by which human beings and the world are restored to God&#x27;s ideal. The concept of indemnity is explained at the start of the second half of the &quot;Divine Principle&quot;, &quot;Introduction to Restoration&quot;:

The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; goes on to explain three types of indemnity conditions. Equal conditions of indemnity pay back the full value of what was lost. The biblical verse &quot;life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth&quot; (Exod.21:23–24) is quoted as an example of an equal indemnity condition. Lesser conditions of indemnity provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. Faith, baptism, and the eucharist are mentioned as examples of lesser indemnity conditions. Greater conditions of indemnity come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case, a greater price must be paid to make up for the earlier failure. Abraham&#x27;s attempted sacrifice of his son Isaac (Gen. 22:1–18) and the Israelites&#x27; 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under Moses (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples of greater indemnity conditions.

The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a &quot;just and righteous&quot; God to work through mankind. Jesus&#x27; statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and Christianity&#x27;s history of martyrdom are mentioned as examples of this. The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; then states that human beings, not God or the angels, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.

In 2005 scholars Daske and Ashcraft explained the concept of indemnity:
Other Protestant Christian commentators have criticized the concept of indemnity as being contrary to the doctrine of &quot;sola fide&quot;. Christian historian Ruth Tucker said: &quot;In simple language, indemnity is salvation by works.&quot; Rev. Keiko Kawasaki wrote: &quot;The indemnity condition (of the Unification Church) is an oriental way of thinking, meaning a condition for atonement for sins (unlike Christianity).&quot; Donald Tingle and Richard Fordyce, ministers with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) who debated two Unification Church theologians in 1977, wrote: &quot;In short, indemnity is anything you want to make it, since you establish the conditions. The zeal and enthusiasm of the Unification Church members is not so much based on love for God as it is compulsion to indemnify one&#x27;s own sins.&quot;

===Ideal family===

A doctrine of Rev. Moon&#x27;s teachings and the Unification movement is that the messiah will part complete Jesus&#x27; work by marrying and raising the &quot;ideal&quot; and &quot;sinless&quot; family as an example for others to follow and so restore God&#x27;s original plan for humanity.
However, according to journalist Robert F. Worth, since the death of Sun Myung Moon, &quot;his children have struggled to live up to their &#x27;sinless&#x27; billing.&quot; They

===Spending church funds in casinos===
In Moon and Han&#x27;s teachings, Las Vegas was described as a &quot;city of Satan,&quot; and they aimed to amass believers to transform that hell into heaven. However, in 2022, reports from Shukan Bunshun and TBS News revealed that according to transaction records compiled between 2008 and 2011 by MGM Resorts International, Hak Ja Han, and 11 church executives lost approximately in Las Vegas casinos. According to a former domestic helper of Hak Ja Han, the religious president&#x27;s favorite casino game was the slot machine.

A senior believer claims that the funds squandered in the casino were donations from Japanese believers. Internal church records specify that donations, totaling between 2009 and 2011, were intended for Las Vegas. A former Japanese chief of the church who participated in the church&#x27;s Las Vegas tour testified that the church specifically instructed participants to carry in cash as a donation, which was below the upper limit for customs declaration. Upon arrival in the U.S., they would hand over their donations and be given a tour of tourist attractions, such as the Grand Canyon, while only being able to meet Moon and Han once, unaware of their gambling activities in the casino.

===Investigation by the United States House of Representatives===
In 1977, the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations of the United States House of Representatives, reported that the Unification Church was established by the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), Kim Chong Pil. The committee also reported that the KCIA had used the movement to gain political influence with the United States, and some of its members had worked as volunteers in Congressional offices. Together they founded the Korean Cultural Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit organization that acted as a public diplomacy campaign for South Korea. The committee also investigated possible KCIA influence on the Unification Church&#x27;s campaign in support of Nixon.

Unification Church official Dan Fefferman testified in August 1977 before the Fraser Committee. Testimony from Fefferman confirmed that he had social ties to officials within the South Korean embassy. Fefferman testified that he had arranged a meeting in 1975 between Republican aide Edwin Feulner of the Heritage Foundation and South Korean Minister Kim Yung Hwan, to potentially put together a group of congressional aides who would travel to South Korea. Hwan was the then-station chief for the KCIA.

During his testimony, Fefferman refused to answer nine questions from the subcommittee, saying that they violated his constitutional rights to freedom of religion and association. The subcommittee recommended that Fefferman be cited for contempt of Congress. Fefferman, speaking to &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; in 1980, said the subcommittee&#x27;s recommendations were never taken up and no charges were pressed.

===Defamation lawsuit against the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;===

In 1978, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, a British tabloid newspaper, published an article with the headline: &quot;The Church That Breaks Up Families.&quot; The article accused the Unification Church of brainwashing and separating families. The British Unification Church&#x27;s director Dennis Orme filed a libel suit against the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and Associated Newspapers, its parent company, resulting in one of the longest civil actions in British legal historylasting six months. Orme and the Unification Church lost the libel case, the appeal case, and were refused permission to take their case to the House of Lords.

The original case heard 117 witnesses, including American anti-cult psychiatrist Margaret Thaler Singer. In the original case, the Unification Church was ordered to pay Associated Newspapers GB£750,000 in costs which was maintained after appeal. The jury of the original case not only awarded Associated Newspapers costs, but it and the judge requested that the Attorney General re-examine the Unification Church&#x27;s charitable status, which after a lengthy investigation from 1986 to 1988 was not removed.

According to George Chryssides, about half of the Unification Church&#x27;s 500 full-time members in Britain moved to the United States. The Unification Church sold seven of its twelve principal church centers after the ruling. Other anti-cultists in countries like Germany sought to incorporate the London High Court&#x27;s decision into law. The Unification Church has won other libel and defamation cases in the United Kingdom, including a similar case against &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

===&quot;United States v. Sun Myung Moon&quot;===
In 1982, Moon was imprisoned in the United States after being found guilty by a jury of willfully filing false Federal income tax returns and conspiracy. The Unification Church of the United States members launched a public-relations campaign. Booklets, letters, and videotapes were mailed to approximately 300,000 Christian leaders in the United States. Many of them signed petitions protesting the government&#x27;s case. The American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A., the National Council of Churches, the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference filed briefs in support of Moon.

Moon served 13 months of the sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury in Danbury, Connecticut. The case was protested as a case of selective prosecution and a threat to religious freedom by, among others, Jerry Falwell, head of Moral Majority, Joseph Lowery, head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Harvey Cox, a professor of Divinity at Harvard, and Eugene McCarthy, United States Senator and former Democratic Party presidential candidate.

===Crown of Peace event in Washington DC===

On March 23, 2004, at a ceremony in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, in Washington, D.C., Moon crowned himself with what was called the &quot;Crown of Peace.&quot; Lawmakers who attended included Senator Mark Dayton (D-Minn.), Representatives Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.) and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), as well as former Representative Walter Fauntroy (D-D.C.). Key organizers of the event included George Augustus Stallings Jr., a former Roman Catholic priest who had been married by Moon and Michael Jenkins, the president of the Unification Church of the United States at that time. Rep. Danny K. Davis (D-Ill.) played an active role in the ceremony. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in 2008, suggested that the participation of federal elected officials in this event was a possible violation of the principle of separation of church and state in United States law.

===In Japan (1970–2023)===

The Unification Church in Japan has faced several controversies:
* Rebranding – In 1997, the Japanese Unification Church&#x27;s request to change its name was rejected due to ongoing lawsuits. In 2015, the name change to &quot;Family Federation for World Peace and Unification&quot; was approved, though the approval process reportedly involved unusual reports.
* Spiritual sales – The Unification Church in Japan faced accusations of pressuring members into financial ruin through &quot;spiritual sales.&quot; This led to 35,000 compensation claims and recovered. The church claims it has emphasized legal compliance and stopped these practices since 2009.
* The assassination of Shinzo Abe – Shinzo Abe&#x27;s assassination by Tetsuya Yamagami, who blamed Abe for his family&#x27;s bankruptcy due to the Unification Church, led Japan&#x27;s ruling party (the Liberal Democrats) to cut ties with the church in August 2022.
* Revocation of religious corporation status by the Japanese government – On October 12, 2023, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Education announced plans to dissolve the Unification Church under Article 81 of the Religious Juridical Person Law, citing deviations from legitimate religious practices. This is the first such action against a religious organization without a criminal conviction. The church intends to contest the order legally. As of March 7, 2024, the government has also increased monitoring of the church&#x27;s assets under a new law aimed at addressing unfair solicitation practices.
* Civil lawsuits against Japanese critics and government – The Unification Church and its affiliates filed lawsuits against Japanese media, lawyers, journalists, and ex-members discussing its fundraising and recruitment. Legal actions increased after ties with Japanese politicians were revealed post-Abe&#x27;s assassination. Critics allege these lawsuits are to silence opposition.
* Child adoption – The Unification Church in Japan was investigated for unauthorized child transfers between members&#x27; families since 2018. They reported 31 adoptions but denied acting as intermediaries. Following scrutiny, the church removed references to child adoption from its handbook in February 2023.

=== Support for North Korea&#x27;s development of nuclear weapons===
According to Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reports in August and September 1994, Moon donated 450 billion yen to Kim Il Sung during his stay in North Korea from November 30, 1991, to December 7, 1992. Those same DIA reports explained an &quot;economic cooperation&quot; for the reconstruction of North Korea&#x27;s economy was in place. This included establishing a joint venture developing tourism at Kimkangsan, investing in the development of the Tumangang River, in addition to investing in the construction of the &quot;light industry&quot; base located in Wonsan. Most of the money was said to have been donated to the Unification Church by Japanese believers. According to the former chief executive of Pyeonghwa Motors, a Unification Church auto company, the money collected from Japanese devotees was first transferred to South Korea and money laundered, then transferred to Hong Kong and finally to North Korea. He said he had a close relationship with Ju Kyu-chang, a senior member of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea and its weapons development chief.

According to Baek Seung-joo, a former South Korean vice defense minister, has analyzed that money donated by Japanese followers of the Unification Church was diverted to North Korea&#x27;s nuclear development and development of intercontinental ballistic missiles. According to Masuo Oe, who was the public relations director of the Unification Church, when Moon said to Kim Il Sung in a meeting, &quot;Please be my brother,&quot; Kim Il Sung replied, &quot;Sure, why not?&quot; According to him, believers heard this anecdote and admired that the Messiah had brought Satan to his knees with the power of love. This was a symbolic event that marked a major shift in the anti-communist policies of the Unification Church.

According to a 2016 South Korean Defense Ministry parliamentary report, a Tokyo-run company operated by members of the Unification Church sold a Russian Golf II-class submarine still loaded with missile launchers to North Korea in 1994, disguised as scrap metal, and the technology was then diverted to North Korea&#x27;s development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The Unification Church has denied having any relationship with the company.

===Controversy in South Korea===

In South Korea, the Unification Church has been criticized for supporting the interests of Japan over those of South Korea. South Korean media reported links between the UC and Japanese conservatives, referring to them as &quot;Chinil&quot; () or &quot;Sin-chinil&quot; (). Some South Korean media reported a connection between Yoon Suk-yeol&#x27;s pro-Japanese foreign policy and the UC.

=== Secrecy and esoteric ===
The Unification Church is sometimes said to be a secret society in that it keeps some of its doctrines secret from non-members, a practice that is sometimes called &quot;heavenly deception.&quot; In 1979, critics D. Tingle and R. Fordyce commented: &quot;How different the openness of Christianity is to the attitude of Reverend Moon and his followers who are often reluctant to reveal to the public many of their basic doctrines.&quot; Since the 1990s, many Unification texts that were formerly regarded as esoteric have been posted on the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification&#x27;s official websites.

===&quot;Crazy for God&quot;===

In &quot;The Way of God&#x27;s Will&quot;, a collection of sayings popular among church members, Moon is quoted as saying: &quot;We leaders should leave the tradition that we have become crazy for God.&quot; In 1979 Unification Church critic Christopher Edwards titled a memoir about his experiences in the six months he spent as a church member: &quot;Crazy for God: The Nightmare of Cult Life.&quot;

== Incidents ==

=== Germany ===
In November 1995, German authorities blacklisted the founders of the Unification Church (Reverend Sun Myung Moon and his wife, Hak Ja Han Moon) through the Schengen Information System and thus forbid entry to 12 European countries. The period of exclusion was extended several times. After 12 years on October 24, 2006, German Federal Constitutional Court ruled, that previous court rulings and authorities&#x27; treatment of the Unification Church in the period from November 1995 violated Article 4 paragraph 1 (Freedom of faith and conscience is inviolable) and paragraph 2 (undisturbed practice is guaranteed) of the German Constitution and is repealed must reimburse the UC for the necessary expenses (articles 2 and 3 of the ruling). Also stated, that the authorities&#x27; defense was based on rumors and assumptions (article 15 of the ruling) and the previous ruling of the Higher Administrative Court was based on weighting religious matters, which is not permitted by state authorities (article 27 of the ruling). Court by this decision rejects with immediate effect the rationale of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior for the 1995 immigration exclusion and not granting an entry visa.

=== France ===
In March 1982, a 21-year-old woman, Claire Château, who was on the central street of Dijon distributing brochures, was pulled into a moving car shouting for help. After a psychological examination showed that she was in good mental health with no traces of alleged &quot;brainwashing,&quot; seven people, family members, and Union nationale des associations de défense des familles et de l&#x27;individu (ADFI) &quot;professional deprogrammers&quot; were accused by the Dijon Regional Criminal Investigation Department (Service Régional de Police Judiciaire de Dijon) of kidnapping under §341 of the French Penal Code to the Besançon Court of Justice. The case contributed to the gradual abandonment of abductions and deprogramming attempts.

=== Russia ===
In 2000 Russia excluded Patrick Francis Nolan from reentry to Russia, holding him captive at the airport overnight based on FSB material on countering non-traditional religions. The visa was repeatedly canceled on reentry without an explanation, which separated him from his son, who stayed in Russia, for almost one year. European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in 2009 in the case &quot;Nolan and K. v. Russia&quot; stated, that Russia failed to comply with or violated Articles 38§1a, 9, 8, 5§1, 5§5 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Convention) and decided that Russia should pay a sum of 7.810 € for damages.

In 2005–2006 Russia forcibly expelled John Alphonsus Corley and Shuji Igarashi and separated them from their families staying in Russia. Mr. Igarashi was held in detention for 3 days in inhuman conditions. Newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta published an article &quot;ComMoonism has come to the Urals&quot; explaining the reason as &quot;State campaign against the Unification Church.&quot; ECHR in 2022 in the case &quot;Corley and Others v. Russia&quot; stated, that Russia violated Articles 1, 2, 9, 8, 3, and 5 of the Convention and decided that Russia should pay a sum of 30.270 € for damages.

=== United States ===
On Thanksgiving 1979, the parents of 28-year-old Thomas Ward conspired with 31 other people to kidnap him (for the second time) and hold him captive for 35 days. He suffered verbal and physical abuse in attempts to &quot;de-program&quot; him of his religious beliefs. Attempts failed and 33 people heard the verdict on the crimes of conspiracy, battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and grand larceny. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on April 18, 1980, that federal civil rights laws protect against religious discrimination. The judgment contradicted the (then common) &quot;parental immunity&quot; principle in such cases. Thomas J. Ward graduated in 1981 from the Unification Theological Seminary and in 2019 became its president.

In 1991 Carlton Sherwood in his book accused Congress, courts, state agencies, and the press of &quot;worst kind of religious prejudice and racial bigotry&quot; against the church, its leaders and followers as determined attempt to erase the church from the United States.

==Related organizations and groups==

Moon believed in the literal Kingdom of God on earth to be brought about by human effort, motivating his establishment of numerous groups, some that are not strictly religious in their purposes. Moon was not directly involved with managing the day-to-day activities of the organizations that he indirectly oversaw, yet all of them attribute the inspiration behind their work to his leadership and teachings.

<text>USS &quot;Ward&quot; was laid down as a (designated DD-139) in the United States Navy during World War I, later converted to a high speed transport (designated APD-16) in World War II. She was responsible for the first American-caused casualties in the Pacific in World War II when she engaged and sank a Japanese midget submarine before Japanese aircraft arrived in the attack on Pearl Harbor, killing both crewmen on board.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Ward&quot; was named in honor of Commander James Harmon Ward, USN, (1806–1861), the first U.S. Navy officer to be killed in action during the American Civil War. &quot;Ward&quot; was built at the Mare Island Navy Yard, California in a record of 17½ days. Under the pressure of urgent World War I needs for destroyers, her construction was pushed rapidly from keel laying on 15 May 1918 to launching on 1 June and commissioning on 24 July 1918.

==Service history==
&quot;Ward&quot; transferred to the Atlantic late in the year and helped support the trans-Atlantic flight of the Curtiss NC flying boats in May 1919. She came back to the Pacific a few months later, and remained there until she was decommissioned in July 1921. She had received the hull number DD-139 in July 1920. The outbreak of World War II in Europe brought &quot;Ward&quot; back into active service. She was recommissioned in January 1941. Sent to Pearl Harbor shortly thereafter, the destroyer operated on local patrol duties in Hawaiian waters over the next year.

===Pearl Harbor===
On the morning of 7 December 1941, under the command of LCDR William W. Outerbridge, &quot;Ward&quot; was conducting a precautionary patrol off the entrance to Pearl Harbor when she was informed at 03:57 by visual signals from the coastal minesweeper of a periscope sighting, whereupon &quot;Ward&quot; began searching for the contact. At about 06:37, she sighted a periscope apparently tailing the cargo ship whereupon she attacked the target. Though unconfirmed at the time, her guns holed a Japanese &quot;Ko-hyoteki&quot;-class, two-man midget submarine. The death of its two-man crew was the first American-caused casualties in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, occurring a few hours before Japanese carrier aircraft attacked Pearl Harbor. The submarine was attempting to enter the harbor by following &quot;Antares&quot; through the antisubmarine nets at the harbor entrance. By entering territorial waters of a neutral country without signalling any intent to stop, the submarine was not entitled to &quot;innocent passage&quot; protections and the neutral party had a right to use whatever means to protect its territory. &quot;Ward&quot; fired several rounds from its main guns, hitting the conning tower of the submarine, and also dropped several depth charges during the attack.

Skepticism whether &quot;Ward&quot; had really sunk a Japanese mini-sub rather than some sort of false alarm incident persisted from the event for decades, until University of Hawaii scientists found the sunken remains of the Japanese vessel on 28 August 2002. The wreck was found in American waters beneath the sea about outside Pearl Harbor. The starboard side of the Japanese submarine&#x27;s conning tower has one shell hole, evidence of damage from &quot;Ward&quot;″s number-three gun. &quot;Ward&quot;″s depth charges did no apparent structural damage to the , craft, which sank due to water flooding in from the shell hole.

===After Pearl Harbor===
In 1942, &quot;Ward&quot; was sent to the West Coast for conversion to a high-speed transport. Redesignated APD-16 in February 1943, she steamed to the South Pacific to operate in the Solomon Islands area. She helped fight off a heavy Japanese air attack off Tulagi on 7 April 1943, and spent most of the rest of that year on escort and transport service. In December, she participated in the Cape Gloucester invasion. During the first nine months of 1944, &quot;Ward&quot; continued her escort and patrol work and also took part in several Southwest Pacific amphibious landings, among them the assaults on Saidor, Nissan Island, Emirau, Aitape, Biak, Cape Sansapor, and Morotai.

==Fate==
As the Pacific War moved closer to Japan, &quot;Ward&quot; was assigned to assist with operations to recover the Philippine Islands. On 17 October 1944, she put troops ashore on Dinagat Island during the opening phase of the Leyte invasion. After spending the rest of October and November escorting ships to and from Leyte, in early December, &quot;Ward&quot; transported Army personnel during the landings at Ormoc Bay, Leyte. On the morning of 7 December, three years to the day after she fired the opening shot of the Pearl Harbor attack, she came under attack by several Japanese &quot;kamikazes&quot; while patrolling off the invasion area. One bomber hit her hull amidships, bringing her to a dead stop. When the resulting fires could not be controlled, &quot;Ward&quot;″s crew was ordered to abandon ship, and she was sunk by gunfire from , whose commanding officer, William W. Outerbridge, had been in command of &quot;Ward&quot; during her action in Hawaii three years before.

In early December 2017, &quot;Ward&quot;″s wreckage was located by in 686 ft (209 m) of water.

In the movie &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, &quot;Ward&quot; was portrayed by , an &quot;Edsall&quot;-class destroyer escort.

==Awards==
* World War I Victory Medal
* American Defense Service Medal with &quot;FLEET&quot; clasp
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with nine battle stars
* World War II Victory Medal
* Philippine Liberation Medal with two stars

==Memorial==
&quot;Ward&quot;″s number-three 4&quot;/50 caliber gun was removed when she was converted to a high speed transport. In 1958, the year of the Minnesota Centennial, it was installed as a memorial at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul, when the men who fired it on 7 December 1941 were members of the Minnesota Naval Reserve. A plaque containing a listing of the naval reservists from Saint Paul who served aboard &quot;Ward&quot; is now displayed in the St. Paul City Hall on the third floor between the council and mayoral offices, in an area also containing the ship&#x27;s bell from the cruiser . The last surviving member of the gun crew from the morning of 7 December, Alan Sanford, died in January 2015.

As of 2012, no other ship in the United States Navy has borne this name, although sometimes confusion occurs with the three destroyers named .

<doc id="512940" wikidata="Q1662100" url="?curid=512940" title="Industrial park">
<text>An industrial park, also known as industrial estate or trading estate, is an area zoned and planned for the purpose of industrial development. An industrial park can be thought of as a more heavyweight version of a business park or office park, which has offices and light industry, rather than heavy industry. Industrial parks are notable for being relatively simple to build; they often feature speedily erected single-space steel sheds, occasionally in bright colours.

== Benefits ==


Industrial parks are usually located on the edges of, or outside, the main residential area of a city, and are normally provided with good transportation access, including road and rail. One such example is the large number of industrial estates located along the River Thames in the Thames Gateway area of London. Industrial parks are usually located close to transport facilities, especially where more than one transport modes coincide, including highways, railroads, airports and ports. Another common feature of a North American industrial park is a water tower, which helps to hold enough water to meet the park&#x27;s demands and for firefighting purposes, and also advertises the industrial park and locality, as usually the community&#x27;s name and logo are painted onto its surface.
This idea of setting land aside through this type of zoning has several purposes:
* By concentrating dedicated infrastructure in a delimited area, to reduce the per-business cost of that infrastructure. Such infrastructure includes roadways, railroad sidings, ports, high-power electric supplies (often including three-phase electric power), high-end communications cables, large-volume water supplies, and high-volume gas lines.
* To attract new business by providing an integrated infrastructure in one location.
* Eligibility of Industrial Parks for benefits.
* To set apart industrial uses from urban areas to try to reduce the environmental and social impact of the industrial uses.
* To provide for localized environmental controls that are specific to the needs of an industrial area.

== Benchmarking ==
Benchmarking helps to rank industrial parks based on various criteria, including performance, investment, environmental protection, social responsibility, and governance (ESG).
For the manufacturing companies located in industrial parks, the performance of industrial park operators is important, as the costs for infrastructure and services charged by the industrial park operator is a serious factor for the competitiveness of the manufacturing companies.

== Criticism ==
Different industrial parks fulfill these criteria to differing degrees. Many small communities have established industrial parks with only access to a nearby highway, and with only the basic utilities and roadways. Public transportation options may be limited or non-existent.

Industrial parks in developing countries such as Pakistan face a myriad of additional difficulties. This includes the availability of a skilled workforce and the clustering together of radically different industrial sectors (pharmaceuticals and heavy engineering, for example), which often leads to unfavorable outcomes for quality centered industries.

== Variations ==
An industrial park specializing in biotechnology is called a biotechnology industrial park. It may also be known as a bio-industrial park or eco-industrial cluster.

Flatted factories exist in cities like Singapore and Hong Kong, where land is scarce. These are typically similar to flats, but house individual industries instead. Flatted factories have cargo lifts and roads that serve each level, providing access to each factory lot.

==Countries==
=== India ===
India was one of the first countries in Asia to recognize the effectiveness of the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) model in promoting exports, with Asia&#x27;s first EPZ set up in Kandla in 1965. In order to overcome the shortcomings experienced on account of the multiplicity of controls and clearances; absence of world-class infrastructure, and an unstable fiscal regime and with a view to attract larger foreign investments in India, the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Policy was announced in April 2000. A special economic zone (SEZ) is a geographical region that has economic laws that are more liberal than a country&#x27;s domestic economic laws. India has specific laws for its SEZs. The category &#x27;SEZ&#x27; covers a broad range of more specific zone types, including free-trade zones (FTZ), export processing zones (EPZ), free zones (FZ), industrial estates (IE), free ports, urban enterprise zones and others. Usually, the goal of a structure is to increase foreign direct investment by foreign investors, typically an international business or a Multi National Corporation (MNC).

=== Turkey ===
An organized industrial zone () is a kind of special economic zone in Turkey. These zones were legislated for between 2000 and 2007, and may bring together related (OIZs for function) industries or just be a special zone for many industries (mixed OIZs).
Not every industry is allowed to operate in organized industrial zones.

<doc id="512947" wikidata="Q361859" url="?curid=512947" title="Alexander Woollcott">
<text>Alexander Humphreys Woollcott (January 19, 1887 – January 23, 1943) was an American drama critic and commentator for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, a member of the Algonquin Round Table, an occasional actor and playwright, and a prominent radio personality.

Woollcott was the inspiration for two fictional characters. The first was Sheridan Whiteside, the caustic but charming main character in the play &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1939) by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, later made into a film in 1942. The second was the snobbish, vitriolic columnist Waldo Lydecker in the novel &quot;Laura&quot;, later made into a film in 1944. Woollcott was convinced he was the inspiration for his friend Rex Stout&#x27;s brilliant, eccentric detective Nero Wolfe, an idea that Stout denied.

==Early life and education==

Alexander Humphreys Woollcott was the youngest of five children of William and Frances Bucklin Woollcott, born on January 19, 1887. The family lived in an 85-room house, a vast ramshackle building in Colts Neck Township, New Jersey known as &quot;the North American Phalanx,&quot; which had once been a commune where many social experiments were carried out in the mid-19th century. When the Phalanx fell apart after a fire in 1854, it was taken over by and became the family seat of the Bucklin family, Woollcott&#x27;s maternal grandparents.

In 1889 the itinerant and often absentee Walter Woollcott moved his family to Kansas City, Missouri. The Woollcotts lived in an upscale neighborhood where, at the age of four, Alexander portrayed the character of Puck from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in a tableau vivant before an audience of more than 100 at the Woollcott home. The six years Woollcott lived in Kansas City were transformative, and set him on the literary and theatrical path that would guide the rest of his life. His second-grade teacher, Sophie Rosenberger, who would remain a lifelong friend, considered him precocious and set him on a reading program that began with Louisa May Alcott and progressed to Charles Dickens by the time he was 8 years old. It was also in Kansas City that he experienced his first theatrical performance, Sinbad the Sailor. He was accompanied by his neighbor, Kansas City Times columnist Roswell Field, brother of famed author Eugene Field. When young Aleck discovered that journalists could get free tickets to theatrical events he decided that he, too would become a newspaper man

In 1895 Walter Woollcott lost the longest job he&#x27;d ever held, and sent his wife Frances and their children back to the Phalanx, where Alexander went to school and spent most of the remainder of his boyhood. He occasionally lodged in homes in Germantown, Philadelphia and attended the Germantown Combined Grammar School, and then Central High School in Philadelphia. He had very few friends during this period and did not enjoy this chapter of his life, with the exception of summers and any time that he could get back to the Phalanx.

With the help of a family friend, he made his way through college, graduating from Hamilton College, New York, in 1909. Despite a rather poor reputation (his nickname was &quot;Putrid&quot;), he founded a drama group, edited the student literary magazine, and was accepted by a fraternity (Theta Delta Chi).

==Writing career==
Woollcott joined the staff of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a cub reporter in 1909. In 1914, he was named drama critic and held the post until 1922, with a break for service during World War I. In April 1917, the day after war was declared, Woollcott volunteered as a private in the medical corps. Posted overseas, Woollcott was a sergeant when the intelligence section of the American Expeditionary Forces selected him and a half-dozen other newspaper men to create the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, an official newspaper to bolster troop morale. As chief reporter for the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, Woollcott was a member of the team that formed its editorial board. These included Harold Ross, founder of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine; Cyrus Baldridge, multifaceted illustrator, author and writer; and the future columnist and radio personality, Franklin P. Adams. Going beyond simple propaganda, Woollcott and his colleagues reported the horrors of the Great War from the point of view of the common soldier. After the war he returned to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, then transferred to the &quot;New York Herald&quot; in 1922 and to &quot;The World&quot; in 1923. He remained there until 1928.

One of New York&#x27;s most prolific drama critics, he was banned for a time from reviewing certain Broadway theater shows due to his florid and often vitriolic prose. He sued the Shubert theater organization for violation of the New York Civil Rights Act, but lost in the state&#x27;s highest court in 1916 on the grounds that only discrimination on the basis of race, creed or color was unlawful. From 1929 to 1934, he wrote a column called &quot;Shouts and Murmurs&quot; for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. His book, &quot;While Rome Burns&quot;, published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap in 1934, was named twenty years later by critic Vincent Starrett as one of the 52 &quot;Best Loved Books of the Twentieth Century&quot;. He was interested in crime writing, promoting the work of US and British mystery authors in his newspaper articles and on the radio as well as writing on true crime, and became involved in the case of Stanford University Press employee David Lamson, who was accused of murdering his wife (prosecutors eventually dropped the case).

Woollcott&#x27;s review of the Marx Brothers&#x27; Broadway debut, &quot;I&#x27;ll Say She Is&quot;, helped the group&#x27;s career inflate from mere success to superstardom and started a lifelong friendship with Harpo Marx. Two of Harpo&#x27;s adopted sons, Alexander Marx and William (Bill) Woollcott Marx, were named after Woollcott.

==Radio==
Billed as &quot;The Early Bookworm&quot;, Woollcott was first heard on CBS Radio in October 1929, reviewing books in various timeslots until 1933. His CBS show &quot;The Town Crier&quot;, which began July 21, 1933, opened with the ringing of a bell and the cry, &quot;Hear ye, hear ye!&quot; followed by Woollcott&#x27;s literary observations punctuated with acidic anecdotes. Sponsored by Cream of Wheat (1934–1935) and Grainger Tobacco (1937–1938), it continued until January 6, 1938. He had no reservations about using this forum to promote his own books, and the continual mentions of his book &quot;While Rome Burns&quot; (1934) probably helped make it a bestseller.

==Reputation==
Woollcott was one of the most quoted men of his generation. Among Woollcott&#x27;s classics is his description of the Los Angeles area as &quot;Seven suburbs in search of a city&quot;—a quip often attributed to his friend Dorothy Parker. Describing &quot;The New Yorker&quot; editor Harold Ross, he said: &quot;He looks like a dishonest Abe Lincoln.&quot; He claimed the Brandy Alexander cocktail was named for him.

Woollcott was renowned for his savage tongue. He dismissed Oscar Levant, the notable wit and pianist, by observing, &quot;There is absolutely nothing wrong with Oscar Levant that a miracle can&#x27;t fix.&quot; He often greeted friends with &quot;Hello, Repulsive.&quot; When a waiter asked him to repeat his order, he demanded &quot;muffins filled with pus.&quot;

His judgments were frequently eccentric. Dorothy Parker once said: &quot;I remember hearing Woollcott say reading Proust is like lying in someone else&#x27;s dirty bath water. And then he&#x27;d go into ecstasy about something called, &quot;Valiant Is the Word for Carrie&quot;, and I knew I had enough of the Round Table.&quot;

Wolcott Gibbs, who often edited Woollcott&#x27;s work at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, was quoted in James Thurber&#x27;s &quot;The Years with Ross&quot; on Woollcott&#x27;s writing:

&quot;Shouts and Murmurs&quot; was about the strangest copy I ever edited. You could take every other sentence out without changing the sense a particle. Whole department, in fact, often had no more substance than a &quot;Talk [of the Town]&quot; anecdote. I guess he was one of the most dreadful writers who ever existed.

After being kicked out of the apartment he shared with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; founders Harold Ross and his wife Jane Grant, Woollcott moved first into the Hotel des Artistes on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, then to an apartment at the far end of East 52nd Street. The members of the Algonquin Round Table had a debate as to what to call his new home. Franklin P. Adams suggested that he name it after the faux Indian word &quot;Ocowoica&quot;, meaning &quot;The-Little-Apartment-On-The-East-River-That-It-Is-Difficult-To-Find-A-Taxicab-Near&quot;. But Dorothy Parker came up with the definitive &quot;Wit&#x27;s End&quot;.

Woollcott yearned to be as creative as the people with whom he surrounded himself. Among many other endeavors, he tried his hand at acting and co-wrote two Broadway shows with playwright George S. Kaufman, while appearing in two others. He also starred as Sheridan Whiteside, for whom he was the inspiration, in the traveling production of &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; in 1940. He also appeared in several cameos in films in the late 1930s and 1940s. He was caricatured twice in Warner Brothers cartoons in 1937: as &quot;Owl Kott&quot; in &quot;The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos&quot;, and as the town crier in &quot;Have You Got Any Castles?&quot;, playing almost identical roles in each.

Politically, Woollcott called for normalization of U.S.–Soviet relations. He was a friend of reporter Walter Duranty, even though he described him as a &quot;man from Mars&quot;. As a friend of Soviet foreign minister Maxim Litvinov, he traveled to the USSR in the 1930s and sent his friend Harpo Marx to Moscow on a comedy tour in 1934. Yet he was attacked viciously in the left-wing press after his visit to the Soviet Union for his less than laudatory depiction of the &quot;worker&#x27;s paradise&quot;.

Towards the end of Woollcott&#x27;s life he semi-retired to Neshobe Island in Lake Bomoseen in Vermont, which he had purchased. Shortly before he died, Woollcott claimed, &quot;I never had anything to say.&quot;

Thurber in &quot;The Years With Ross&quot; also reports Woollcott describing himself as &quot;the best writer in America&quot;, but with nothing in particular to say; Wolcott Gibbs made a similar criticism of him. Woollcott was primarily a storyteller, a retailer of anecdotes and superior gossip, as many of his personal letters reveal. His letters also reveal a warm and generous heart and a self-effacing manner distinct from his waspish public persona, and his many lasting and close friendships with the theatrical and literary elite of his day.

Woollcott was friends with actress Katharine Cornell, whom he lauded as the &quot;First Lady of the Theatre&quot;. He often gave extremely favorable reviews both to her and the various productions of her husband, director Guthrie McClintic.

==Personal life==
Reportedly, in his early twenties he contracted the mumps, which left him mostly, if not completely, impotent. He never married or had children, although he had some notable female friends, including Dorothy Parker and Neysa McMein, to whom he reportedly proposed the day after she had just wed her new husband, Jack Baragwanath. Woollcott once told McMein that &quot;I&#x27;m thinking of writing the story of our life together. The title is already settled.&quot; McMein: &quot;What is it?&quot; Woollcott: &quot;Under Separate Cover.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Woollcott appeared on his last radio broadcast on January 23, 1943, as a participant in a Writers&#x27; War Board panel discussion on the CBS Radio program &quot;The People&#x27;s Platform&quot; marking the tenth anniversary of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, entitled &quot;Is Germany Incurable?&quot;

Other panelists included Hunter College president George Shuster, Brooklyn College president Harry Gideonse, and novelists Rex Stout and Marcia Davenport. The program&#x27;s format began as a dinner party in the studio&#x27;s private dining room, with the microphones in place. Table talk would lead into a live network radio broadcast, and each panelist would begin with a provocative response to the topic. &quot;The German people are just as responsible for Hitler as the people of Chicago are for the Chicago &quot;Tribune&quot;&quot;, Woollcott stated emphatically.

In visible distress, Woollcott commented ten minutes into the broadcast that he was feeling ill, but continued his remarks. &quot;It&#x27;s a fallacy to think that Hitler was the cause of the world&#x27;s present woes&quot;, he said. &quot;Germany was the cause of Hitler.&quot; He said nothing further, but reportedly took a notepad and wrote the words, &quot;I am sick.&quot; The radio audience remained unaware that Woollcott had suffered a heart attack and died at New York&#x27;s Roosevelt Hospital, just four days after his 56 birthday, of a cerebral hemorrhage.

He was buried in Clinton, New York, at his alma mater, Hamilton College, but not without some confusion. By mistake, his ashes were sent to Colgate University in Hamilton, New York. When the error was corrected and the ashes were forwarded to Hamilton College, they arrived with 67¢ postage due.

==&quot;As You Were&quot;==
At the time of his death, Woollcott had completed the editorial work on his last book, &quot;As You Were&quot;, an anthology of fiction, poetry and nonfiction for members of the armed forces. The idea of creating a much-needed &quot;knapsack book&quot; for service members reportedly came to Woollcott while he was staying at the White House in November 1942. An experienced anthologist, he drew on the knowledge of soldiers&#x27; reading preferences he gained while he was editor of &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; during World War I, and also asked for nominations from friends including Stephen Vincent Benét, Carl Sandburg and Mark Van Doren.

Like his final radio broadcast, &quot;As You Were&quot; was a contribution to the war for which Woollcott waived all royalties and planned to donate profits to welfare organizations. The book was published by the Viking Press in March 1943.

<text>James Wilson (3 September 1760 – 30 August 1820), commonly known as &quot;Purly Wilson,&quot; was a Scottish revolutionary, born in the parish of Avondale in Scotland, a prominent figure in the Radical movement seeking electoral reform. He was a weaver from the town of Strathaven in Lanarkshire, but as the Industrial Revolution affected the weaving trade he had to find alternative work.

A free-thinking man, he was skeptical of religion and disliked the government of the day. He read Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Man&quot; and started to become active in lobbying for political reform. When the Society of the Friends of the People was formed by a group of Whigs he joined the Strathaven branch, although he doesn&#x27;t appear to have been extremely active initially.

However, when it became clear that the local nobleman, the Duke of Hamilton, objected to the aims of the Friends of the People, many members withdrew and Wilson became more active in trying to maintain the local society.
The Friends of the People eventually folded across the country, but Wilson maintained his Radical reformist activities. In the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars many returning soldiers faced unemployment. In such an environment the scope for radical activity was ripe.

In 1816 some 40,000 people assembled near Glasgow to demand an improvement to their social and political conditions. In 1817 the first edition of the satirical reformist publication, &quot;The Black Dwarf&quot; was published and Wilson and his Radical colleagues would read this at their continued meetings.

Radical activities continued in the West of Scotland around Glasgow, and the government employed a number of spies to infiltrate the meetings and associations of activists. Troops were stationed in Glasgow, and government spies encouraged Radicals to rise, telling them that England too was in the throes of Radical insurrection. This was a deliberate attempt to cause Radical leaders to rise up where they could then be arrested. On 1 April 1820 a notice was posted in Glasgow and surrounding areas urging people to rise against the British government, signed by the &quot;Organising Committee for a Provisional Government&quot;, the start of the so-called Radical War.

Wilson responded in exactly the manner predicted by the government. He led a band of Radicals from Strathaven marching towards Glasgow. Wilson was initially wary of the information presented that a rising was taking place (he was informed of the rising by a government agent), and sent a man to visit the rallying point at Cathkin Braes to see if it was true that there was a force of French troops awaiting to assist the radicals.

However, despite there being no French troops in sight, the Radicals in Strathaven were keen to march, so Wilson led them towards the city, with the marchers carrying a banner declaring, &quot;Scotland Free or a Desart&quot;. They marched overnight, and by the next day it was apparent to them by now that there was no mass insurrection. Disappointed and dejected, they returned to Strathaven.

However, upon his return Wilson was arrested on a charge of high treason. On 24 July 1820, he was found guilty of treason after proceedings before a commission of oyer and terminer and was sentenced to death. He was hanged and beheaded on 30 August 1820.

In 1846 a monument to Wilson was erected in Strathaven.
