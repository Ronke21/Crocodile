<doc id="525926" wikidata="Q5121444" url="?curid=525926" title="Intelligence officer">
<text>An intelligence officer is a person employed by an organization to collect, compile or analyze information (known as intelligence) which is of use to that organization. The word of &quot;officer&quot; is a working title, not a rank, used in the same way a &quot;police officer&quot; can also be a sergeant, or in the military, in which non-commissioned personnel may serve as intelligence officers.

Organizations which employ intelligence officers include armed forces, police, and customs agencies.

==Sources of intelligence==
Intelligence officers make use of a variety of sources of information, including

; Communications intelligence (COMINT): Eavesdropping and interception of communications (e.g., by wiretapping) including signals intelligence (SIGINT) and electronic intelligence (ELINT).
; Financial intelligence (FININT): The gathering of information about the financial affairs of entities of interest.
; Human intelligence (HUMINT): Derived from covert human intelligence sources (Covert Human Intelligence Source or CHIS, &quot;agents&quot; or &quot;moles&quot;) from a variety of agencies and activities.
; Imagery intelligence (IMINT): Derived from numerous collection assets, such as reconnaissance satellites or aircraft.
; Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT): Derived from collection assets that collect and evaluate technical profiles and specific characteristics of certain targeted entities.
; Open-source intelligence (OSINT): Derived from publicly available sources such as the Internet, library materials, newspapers, etc.
; Technical intelligence (TECHINT): Based on scientific and technical characteristics of weapons systems, technological devices and other entities.

==Role and responsibilities==
The actual role carried out by an intelligence officer varies depending on the remit of their parent organization. Officers of foreign intelligence agencies (e.g. the United States&#x27; Central Intelligence Agency, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) may spend much of their careers abroad. Officers of domestic intelligence agencies (such as the United States&#x27; Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the UK&#x27;s Security Service (MI5) and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) are responsible for counter-terrorism, counter-espionage, counter-proliferation and the detection and prevention of serious organized crime within their own countries (although, in Britain, the National Crime Agency is responsible for dealing with serious organized crime).

Titles and responsibilities common among intelligence officers include:

; Field officer: An officer who manages the intelligence collection plan for specific missions in foreign countries.
; Case officer: An officer who runs intelligence agents in order to collect raw intelligence information. Case officers spend their time recruiting and exploiting source agents in order to collect HUMINT.
; Collections officer (collector): An officer who collects information, not necessarily from human sources but from technical sources such as wiretaps, bugs, cyber-collection, MASINT devices, SIGINT devices and other means.
; Operations officer: An officer who plans or enacts the necessary steps to disrupt or prevent activities of hostile individuals or groups.
; Analyst: An officer who analyzes collected information and results of operations to determine the identities, intentions, capabilities and activities of hostile individuals or groups and to determine requirements for future operations. After analysis, analysts are also responsible for the production and dissemination of their final product.
; Counterintelligence officer:An officer that works to prevent detection, penetration, manipulation and compromise of the intelligence agency, its operations and overall national security by foreign, domestic, or hostile agents. Often counterintelligence officers are law enforcement officers, as is the case with the Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Counterintelligence Division and the Diplomatic Security Service&#x27;s Counterintelligence Division. This is often done in order to arrest moles and foreign intelligence agents. However, counter-intelligence officers can and do actively handle sources and agents in order to collect raw intelligence information.

===Intelligence agents===
Intelligence agents are individuals that work for or have been recruited by an Intelligence Officer, but who are not employed by the intelligence agency of the intelligence officer. Sometime around 2000, the United States Intelligence Community adopted a more &quot;corporate&quot; vocabulary and began referring to agents as assets. Intelligence agents can be of several types:

; Source agent: A primary source of intelligence information. This is the classic HUMINT source.
; Access agent: An agent who identifies and approaches potential sources (eventual source agents) for assessment or recruitment. In counter-proliferation (CP) access agents are often scientists. In counter-terrorism (CT) access agents are often religious or ideological leaders.
; Agent provocateur: An agent who infiltrates hostile organizations with the intent of spreading disinformation from within or disrupting their operations through enticement and sabotage.
; Rogue agent: A former intelligence officer, who may be subject to a burn notice, who is no longer accepting direction from their agency.
; Double agent: An agent or intelligence officer who accepts direction from two or more intelligence agencies.

Contrary to popular belief or what is seen in Hollywood films, professionally trained intelligence officers are never referred to as agents, secret agents or special agents (except in the case of FBI Special Agents). They are most often referred to as case officers or operations officers. Agents are the foreigners who betray their own countries to pass information to the officer; agents are also known as confidential informants or assets.

<doc id="525928" wikidata="Q2655853" url="?curid=525928" title="Special agent">
<text>In the United States, a special agent is an official title used to refer to certain investigators or detectives of federal, military, tribal, or state agencies who primarily serve in criminal investigatory positions. Additionally, some special agents operate in criminal intelligence, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence-based roles as well, with one or all of these roles occasionally taking precedence over criminal investigatory tasks. 

Within the U.S. federal law enforcement system, dozens of federal agencies employ federal law enforcement officers (LEOs), each with different criteria pertaining to the use of the titles &quot;special agent&quot; and &quot;agent&quot;. Most criminal investigators employed by the U.S. Department of Defense and its component departments typically utilize the title of &quot;special agent.&quot;

Most people holding the title of &quot;special agent&quot; are LEOs under state and/or federal law (with some also being dual intelligence operatives such as with the FBI). These LEOs are distinctly empowered to conduct both major and minor criminal investigations, and hold arrest authority. While not all federal LEOs are &quot;special agents,&quot; nearly all special agents – with very few exceptions – are duly-sworn LEOs. This holds true at the state-level, as well, with nearly all special agents of state agencies being sworn LEOs.

In intelligence usage, &quot;agent&quot; may also refer to a human source or human &quot;asset&quot; who is recruited, trained, controlled, and employed to obtain and report information. However, within law enforcement agencies, these types of sources are often referred to as informants, confidential informants (CI—not to be confused with counterintelligence), or confidential human sources (CHS).

==Federal government==
Within the U.S. government, the title of Special Agent primarily designates the Criminal Investigator GS-1811 series position. However, the title is also concurrently used for General Investigator GS-1810 job series and the intelligence specialist in the GS-0132 job series according to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) handbook. The vast majority of special agents are GS-1811 (or equivalent) Criminal Investigators. Special agents typically have at a minimum an undergraduate degree.

* 1811: Criminal Investigator (Primary Special Agent occupation within the federal government)
*1810: General Investigator
* 0132: Intelligence
* 2501: Foreign Service Criminal Investigator (Department of State&#x27;s Diplomatic Security Service)

===Training for the federal criminal investigator===
Federal law enforcement training can be divided into various categories, the most common being basic, agency-specific basic (ASB), advanced/specialized, and agency-advanced/specialized. To operate safely and effectively, U.S. Special Agents and criminal investigators must possess skills and knowledge regarding criminal and civil law and procedure, enforcement operations, physical techniques, and technical equipment, to mention a few. They must also be physically fit. While possession of a college degree can aid in obtaining employment in this profession, only extensive training provided at specialized facilities, combined with on-the-job training, can provide the skills and knowledge needed to perform the duties of a federal criminal investigator. As of 2012, there were 13,913 FBI agents, as of 2016, there were approximately 6,500 ICE-Homeland Security investigations (HSI) agents, and as of 2011, there were 4,890 DEA agents in the United States.

===Criminal investigators and the use of the term special agent===
Not all federal criminal investigators are called special agents. Some federal agencies entitle their investigators as criminal investigators but use the term interchangeably with special agent. Other federal agencies use different titles for the same 1811 criminal investigative job series. Series 1811 criminal investigators for the U.S. Marshals are entitled Deputy Marshals. Series 1811 criminal investigators for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are called postal inspectors. These inspectors were originally called surveyors and received a title change in 1801 to Special Agent. In 1880, the U.S. Congress created the position of Chief Postal Inspector and renamed these special agents to postal inspectors. The first special agents in the United States were appointed in 1791 when the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to employ &quot;Special Agents&quot; for the purpose of examining the accounts and books of the Collectors of Customs. The position of Special Treasury Agent was created, and until 1860 submitted reports to the Department of Treasury, through the Collectors of Customs in the Customs District in which they were employed.

==State, county, municipal, and tribal governments==
The terms &#x27;special agent&#x27; and &#x27;agent&#x27; are also used by various specialized state level law enforcement agencies to refer to their officers, including the North Carolina Bureau of Investigations (NCSBI), the Kentucky Department of Criminal Investigation (DCI), the Washington State Gambling Commission, many agencies inside the California Department of Justice such as the California Bureau of Investigation, the California Bureau of Firearms, the California Bureau of Gambling Control, the California Bureau of Forensic Services and the California Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud &amp; Elder Abuse, the 
Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), the Arkansas State Police (ASP) Criminal Investigations Division and many others. These agencies may be a part of a State Bureau of Investigation (which is usually a part of an Attorney General&#x27;s Office or a state level Government Department) or a State Police Agency (which is again itself a part of a state Department of Public Safety or a Department of Justice).

Also, Maryland has criminal investigators who are employed by the state attorney. These investigators are called &quot;special investigators&quot;. As with special agents, these special investigators are authorized to conduct investigations, make arrests, carry firearms or other weapons, and carry a metallic badge.

==In popular culture==
Special agents, particularly those within the FBI, have been depicted in popular entertainment for years.

The title &quot;Assistant Special Agent in Charge&quot; and its acronym &quot;ASAC&quot; () are stated frequently throughout the TV series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;. For example, in Season 1 through Season 4, both DEA Special Agent Hank Schrader and local entrepreneur Gus Fring are shown to be friendly with Hank&#x27;s boss, ASAC George Merkert, and in Season 4 Episode 12 &quot;End Times&quot;, Steve Gomez tells Dennis the &quot;ASAC&quot; is being pressured to search Gus&#x27;s laundry for drugs. In Season 5, Hank – who is proud to have been promoted to the job vacated by his ousted boss – repeatedly chants &quot;ASAC Schrader&quot; to his baby niece Holly.

In the TV series &quot;White Collar&quot;, Peter Burke is the &quot;Special Agent in Charge&quot; (promoted from assistant Special Agent in Charge at the end of Season 6) and the head of the Manhattan White Collar Division.

In the TV series &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; several of the Behavioral Analysis Unit members are Supervisory Special Agents.

In the TV series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, the title &quot;Special Agent&quot; is given to both Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The title is referenced by them numerous times throughout each episode.

The main character from the TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, is FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, and also, other FBI special agents make numerous cameos throughout the series, and its prequel movie, &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;.

&quot;Dick Barton - Special Agent&quot; was the subject of radio programs in the 1940s and later TV and film productions.

In the TV series &quot;NCIS&quot; the character Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo constantly introduces himself as &quot;Very Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo&quot; in an attempt to be charming.

In the TV series &quot;Mr. Robot&quot; the character Dominique &quot;Dom&quot; DiPierro, the FBI &quot;ASAC&quot;, appeared in the final three seasons.

<text>Marina Golbahari (; born 1989) is an Afghan actress who earned international fame for her role as the title character in the 2003 film &quot;Osama&quot;, playing a girl who had to dress and act as a boy to support her family during the Taliban years.

==Career==
Golbahari was cast as Osama by the Afghan film director Siddiq Barmak, who picked her roaming on the streets of Kabul as a beggar. The movie went on to earn the Golden Globe award in the category of Best Foreign Film and Golbahari&#x27;s performance was well received by many critics, including &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; &#x27;s Richard Nilsen, who wrote, &quot;there is no shortcoming in the acting of Marina Golbahari&quot;.

Golbahari figures prominently in the 2012 book, &quot;Shakespeare in Kabul&quot;, by Qais Akbar Omar and Stephen Landrigan. The book chronicles a 2005 performance in the Dari of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; that was presented in Kabul and then in other parts of Afghanistan the following year.

==Personal life==
Golbahari is married to Noorullah Azizi, who is also involved with the film industry in Afghanistan.

Golbahari and her husband are currently living in exile in an asylum shelter in France as Golbahari has received numerous death threats after being photographed at a South Korean film festival without her head covered.

==Awards and nominations==

<doc id="525931" wikidata="Q7334525" url="?curid=525931" title="Rimutaka Incline">
<text>The Rimutaka Incline was a , gauge railway line on an average grade of 1-in-15 using the Fell system between Summit and Cross Creek stations on the Wairarapa side of the original Wairarapa Line in the Wairarapa district of New Zealand. The term &quot;Rimutaka Incline&quot; is sometimes used incorrectly to refer to other parts or all of the closed and deviated section of the Wairarapa Line between Upper Hutt and Speedy&#x27;s Crossing, near Featherston. The incline formation is now part of the Remutaka Rail Trail.

== History ==
=== Background ===
The construction of a railway from Wellington to Masterton was authorised in the Railways Act passed on 13 September 1871. Julius Vogel, Colonial Treasurer, travelled to England to raise finance for a major public works programme for railway construction. Vogel returned via the United States, where he studied rail systems.

After the act of parliament was passed, a survey party set out to make preliminary investigations of possible routes for a railway over the Rimutaka Range (now spelled &quot;Remutaka Range&quot;). These were complete by December 1870, the party having investigated four routes. A commonality between all the proposals was the section from Upper Hutt to Kaitoki (later Kaitoke). Between Kaitoke and the Wairarapa, the four proposals were the Tauwharenikau Route, Mr Sinclair&#x27;s Route, a coastal route and the Pakuratahi Route.

While the government was conducting its surveys, Wellington Province Superintendent William Fitzherbert instructed his Provincial Engineer, Charles O’Neill, to investigate the possibility of a railway through the Rimutaka Valley (the route of the road between Featherston and Upper Hutt), with a tunnel through the dividing range. The survey was carried out between May and 21 July 1871, and O’Neill reported that a tunnel 130 chains (2.6 km) long would be required, with the line rising at 1 in 60 from the Pakuratahi to the tunnel then descending at 1 in 40 to Featherston. This survey was forwarded to the Minister for Public Works.

In mid-1873 the route to Featherston was chosen after a final survey for the route from Upper Hutt to Summit.

For the line between Summit and the Wairarapa, several proposals were considered. The first, with gradients up to 1 in 30, was dismissed. It was found that to keep the gradient to no steeper than 1 in 40, curves of three chains (60 m) radius would be required. This would have required special rolling stock and heavy earthworks and was thus abandoned.

Another proposal was known as the Birch Spur Incline. This would have involved the line continuing from Summit to Birch Spur from where a rope-worked incline would convey traffic to the valley floor where the railway would continue through a narrow valley to the Wairarapa plains. The Public Works Department engineers investigating this proposal were unable to locate a suitable incline, so this proposal was also abandoned.

The last option was a three-mile (4.8 km) incline with gradients averaging 1 in 15 &quot;to be worked by locomotives of an unusual nature&quot;. This line was the most favourable from an engineer&#x27;s point of view, and required not unreasonable earthworks. The final decision was made by the head of the Public Works Department, John Carruthers. He determined that an incline worked by the Fell system would be suitable, and cited the Mont Cenis Pass Railway as an example. Though special locomotives would be required, factors in its favour were that ordinary rolling stock could be used and it was a proven system. It was to be the third and last Fell system employing the centre rail for both tractive power and braking, and the longest surviving. Though it was considered to be a &quot;temporary&quot; measure, it outlasted the second such system in Brazil by 72 years.

=== Construction ===
Construction of the Rimutaka Incline was included in two contracts that were let for the building of the original Wairarapa Line. These contracts were known as the Summit contract and the Incline contract.

==== Summit contract ====
This contract included the excavation of Summit station yard and related drainage, Summit tunnel, and formation work to a point 26 chains (523 m) beyond the tunnel. It was the shortest contract of those let for the line, it was finished by the original contractor, and it had the fewest alterations. Work was to start on 12 July 1874 and to be completed by 22 July 1876, at which time the Pakuratahi contract was due to be completed.

Summit yard was a large cut into the hillside, wide and long initially. Excavations removed material to a depth of 15–20 feet, with this fill being dumped on the opposite side of the yard to form level ground. On the hillside above the yard, further ground was levelled and houses erected thereon.

After the yard had taken shape, the next job was the tunnel. The approach to the tunnel was about 6 chains long and up to deep. The line entered the tunnel on a downward grade of 1 in 1,000, steepening to a grade of 1 in 15 at the eastern portal. At that end a small drainage tunnel had to be built to divert a stream that had flowed down a steep gully where the tunnel mouth was to be. The maximum height of the tunnel was above the floor: once rails were laid the maximum clearance was The width of the tunnel varied from at the floor to at above the floor. Despite castigation from various parties, it was not until March 1877 that work on both ends of the tunnel met at the middle, having taken three and a half years to complete.

The Public Works Department lined the tunnel after the rails had reached the site, enabling them to use work trains to bring materials and other supplies in. It was during this phase that the only fatality on this contract occurred: on 3 May 1878, a sizeable portion of the lining collapsed on two men. One was killed outright, the other lost his eyesight due to severe head injuries.

The Summit contract was completed on 10 December 1877, 17 months behind schedule.

==== Incline contract ====
On 5 October 1875, the Incline contract was awarded to Charles McKirdy for the sum of £49,029. The contract covered the formation only, with the Public Works Department responsible for track laying.

The contract began outside Summit tunnel and terminated at Featherston, a distance of 8 miles 76 chains (14.403 km). It included Cross Creek station yard and runaway siding. Several alterations were made to the contract both prior to and during construction, including the replacement of one of three tunnels by a cutting, and three wooden bridges by embankments.

The line descended at a grade of 1 in 15, passing through the long Horseshoe Gully Tunnel (later Siberia Tunnel). On leaving the tunnel, the line crossed the gully on a high earth and rock embankment, the largest on the section, on a five-chain radius curve. The embankment was about 180 to wide at its base, and around high at its centre line.

After the embankment, the line continued at a grade of 1 in 15 down to Cross&#x27;s Creek (later Cross Creek) station. From Cross Creek the line descended at gradients varying from level to 1 in 40 to Lucena&#x27;s (later Pigeon Bush), and from there in a straight line to Featherston.

Work on the contract began on 22 October 1875. None of the major earthworks seem to have presented any great difficulties, save the lower tunnel, which was plagued by accidents and materials failures largely because of the unstable nature of the rock through which it passed. The tunnel was named Price&#x27;s after the manager McKirdy employed for this contract. On 2 March 1876, two men died due to a cave-in of the tunnel roof.

Between October 1877 and March 1878, platelaying was completed up to Summit. This enabled the use of work trains to haul up materials that were used to line Summit Tunnel. Track laying on the incline commenced in April 1878 and reached Cross Creek the following month. During this work, H 199 was stabled at Summit and used to haul work and ballast trains to the railhead.

Initially, only simple arrangements were made for the station yard at Cross&#x27;s Creek, as it had yet to be decided the nature of operations on the Incline. It consisted of the main line, an engine siding of 10 chains, and the runaway siding.

After formation work continued beyond Cross Creek, McKirdy ran out of time and money, with the remainder of his contract being picked up by his guarantors, T. W. Young and Robert Greenfield. They finished the formation to Featherston on 17 August 1878, with track laying finishing the following month. The contract was completed 13 months late.

=== Operation ===
Initially, trains on the incline were limited to the weight that could be managed by a single locomotive. After complaints from management of the expense of running too many trains, two locomotives seem to have been used, both at the head of the train. From 1887 trains were worked with multiple locomotives, each at the head of its rated load. As the maximum weight of a train during this period was 150 tons, no more than three locomotives were used per train. Train operations continued to be modified until by 1908 the maximum load allowed per train had increased to 250 tons descending and 260 tons ascending.

When the line opened, there were two Fell brake vans in service, each long and from floor to ceiling, with open platforms at either end. The wear on the brake blocks fitted to these vans was so severe that a set of blocks seldom lasted more than one trip down the incline. Like the positioning and loading of the locomotives, the arrangements for positioning of the Fell vans varied until they were largely standardised by 1897. For ascending trains, Fell vans were placed at the rear of the train. For descending trains, a Fell van was placed between the locomotives and the leading vehicle. If the gross weight of the train exceeded 120 tons or included more than 15 vehicles (excluding the locomotives in both cases) a second Fell van was attached to the rear of the train. These rules applied before the introduction of the Westinghouse continuous air brake. The Fell locomotives were never turned, running cab first on descending trains.

As descending trains departed Summit the &quot;through&quot; guard applied the brakes on the leading vehicle, then moved through the train applying the brakes on the other vehicles until he reached the train van, which also had brakes that had to be applied. Each Fell van had its own guard to operate the two sets of brakes.

After the introduction of the continuous brake system in 1903 it became possible to operate trains with five locomotives, and on descending passenger trains up to five Fell brake vans could be used – two next to the locomotives, one in the middle, and two at the rear. As each brake van had its own guard and the train had a train guard and locomotive crews, a train with five brake vans and four locomotives had a crew of 14, which added to the expense of the operation. Moreover, to reduce the strain on couplings, when several locomotives were used they would be distributed through the train, as can be seen from photos. This necessitated significant remarshalling of the train at either end of the incline.

Instructions issued in 1885 regarding the use of the safety siding required that the points for the incline be set to the safety siding. As descending trains approached the Cross Creek yard, the driver of the leading locomotive sounded a long whistle, which signalled that all was well. On hearing this signal the signalman would set the points for the arrival road. As far as is known no real emergency occurred. Cross Creek had an unusual six-lever partially-interlocked signalling installation and had no &quot;distant&quot; signals so had points indicators which applied to the &quot;main&quot; line (see Heine for station layout), while Summit had a fully interlocked 27-lever frame.

Unusual traffic included four royal trains: for the Prince of Wales in 1921; the Duke (later King George VI) and Duchess of York in 1927; the Duke of Gloucester in 1935; and Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in 1954. Trains were diverted from the Manawatu line due to slips, floods or other mishaps.

The original yards at Cross Creek and Summit were sufficient for the traffic levels of the time, but increasing traffic brought about incremental additions. The full extent of the Summit yard was reached in 1903, which coincided with the introduction of full signalling and interlocking, not introduced to Cross Creek until 1915.

H class locomotives were not to be operated on any part of the railway other than the Incline, with the sole exception of conveying them to the Petone (and later Hutt) Workshops for maintenance. In the latter case, bunkers, water tanks and boilers were to be empty and the locomotives were to be towed at a speed not exceeding . These rules were relaxed to allow the locomotives to travel light engine to Petone and back under their own steam, subject to the same speed restrictions. In 1887 they were permitted to be operated between Cross Creek and Pigeon Bush, later extended to Featherston to enable them to be used for banking purposes. Running rights between Cross Creek and Featherston were revoked about 1943.

Speed limits for trains on the Incline were changed several times. From 1884 to 1888 the limit was ascending and descending, except light passenger trains for which the limit was . In 1888 these limits changed to up, down. The limits were finally up, down.
Various classes of locomotives were deployed to supplement the H class when one or more was away for maintenance or repairs, including
*W 192 and 238 2-6-2 tank locomotives, built in 1889 and 1891 respectively, which spent most of their time on the Wellington to Summit section until their transfer in 1909;
*54-ton WE 4-6-4 tank locomotives rebuilt from 4-8-0 B class locomotives, rated to haul passenger trains up to 55 tons and goods trains up to 60 tons, until 1906, after which they were used mainly on the Upper Hutt to Summit section and rated to haul passenger trains up to 130 tons, mixed trains 150 tons and goods trains 155 tons, and were then later sent to work on the Rewanui Incline in the South Island;
*65-ton E 66, rated to haul 80 tons up the Incline, and nicknamed &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Dream.&quot; In 1910 it was transferred to banking duties on the Wellington to Johnsonville section, but it was never popular with crew.
*WG 480 4-6-4 tank locomotive, during the Great War.

After the Great War traffic was well within the capabilities of the six H class locomotives.

The mileages run by the H class locomotives show notable increases that correspond to economic and other major events, such as the opening of the Wairarapa Line as far as Masterton, completion of the line to Woodville, and the nationalisation of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway. With the opening of the railway to Masterton the annual mileage of the H class rose from less than 7,000 to more than 8,000, in 1883–1897 to 34,000, and to 42,000 when the line was opened to Woodville and began carrying traffic from the Hawke&#x27;s Bay. Mileage peaked at 64,123 in 1906–07, about 10,687 miles per locomotive or 1,780 return Incline trips.

==== Wairarapa railcars ====

In 1936 seven lightweight Wairarapa railcars, RM 4–10, were introduced between Palmerston North, Masterton and Wellington. They were specifically designed for the Incline, and were built at the Hutt Workshops. They were named after historic Maori canoes: Maahunui, Mahuhu, Mamari, Matahourua, Mataatua, Arai-te-Uru and Arawa. Initially powered by Leyland petrol engines, they were upgraded after several years to diesel engines. They had a single rear driving axle with 38½&quot; (978 mm) diameter wheels, necessitated by the need for the axle and final drive unit to have sufficient clearance above the Incline’s centre rail. Because of the large rear wheels the floor of the passenger compartment was 52½&quot; (1334 mm) above rail level, more than higher than normal. They were rated for a maximum speed of and expected to climb the Incline at 15-17 mph, but actually managed only 10–12 mph. Nevertheless, they greatly speeded up passenger trains on the route and immediately proved popular. They were withdrawn in 1955 when the Incline closed.

=== Replacement ===
Several options for an alternative to the Incline were considered in the 20th century, but it was not until after WWII that a route through a tunnel between Maymorn and Lucena&#x27;s Creek was selected. Construction was started in 1948 by the Public Works Department and completed by a private contractor in 1955. The tunnel and deviation opened on 3 November 1955, five days after the Incline closed.

Demolition was swift, with the removal of track between Cross Creek and Pigeon Bush largely completed by March 1956. H 199 was used to haul the work trains that removed the track between Cross Creek and Summit. The buildings were sold at auction, on site. Some of the rails were sent to the Rewanui Incline, as were a couple of the Fell brake vans. Five of the six H class locomotives were towed to the Hutt Workshops, later to Silverstream, to be scrapped.

== Today ==

=== Museum ===
A museum dedicated to the preservation of the only remaining H-class &quot;Fell&quot; locomotive was opened at Featherston in 1984. H 199 had previously been given to the town of Featherston, and had been a static display in a local park from 1958. Later, a lease was secured on F 210, the sole remaining Fell brake van, which is now also on display in the museum.

=== Rail trail ===
A resurgence of public interest in the incline followed the publication of a book in 1976 and the opening of the Fell Engine Museum in the early 1980s, prompting the New Zealand Forest Service to re-establish access to Cross Creek in 1984. Interest increased following the publishing of an article in the NZ Runner magazine &quot;Try this Run&quot; in the November-December 1984 issue, which promoted this incline as a backcountry running opportunity [Issue No 35, ISSN 0110-5248]. The official opening of a rail trail using the formation of the original railway line from Cross Creek to Kaitoke followed in 1987. It is today one of the more popular recreational facilities in the region and forms part of the Remutaka Forest Park.

=== Children′s book ===

Inspired by H 199, Joy Cowley authored &quot;Hero of the hill&quot; in 2013. The book traces the train&#x27;s journey up the incline during a particularly stormy night.

== Future Plans ==
In October 2005 a reunion of former NZR staff and friends who worked the Incline was held in Featherston, including a visit on 29 October to Cross Creek to commemorate 50 years since the last train ran on the Incline. On the same day a ″first spike″ ceremony was held at Maymorn to mark the beginning of the Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust&#x27;s project to reinstate the railway.
On 8 August 2003 the trust was inaugurated with the intention of reinstating the line in four stages: Upper Hutt to Summit; Wellington to Upper Hutt (using KiwiRail&#x27;s Wairarapa Line); Summit to Cross Creek; Cross Creek to Featherston. The base of operations is on land leased from KiwiRail at Maymorn. Largely thanks to the establishment of the Remutaka Rail Trail, most of the original formation has been preserved and is proposed to be incorporated into the reinstated rail operation, with new works required at Maymorn to link the original formation to the station yard and a deviation at Kaitoke to bypass formation land that is now in private ownership. The original route from Upper Hutt to the Mangaroa valley is not included in the trust&#x27;s plans.

Work on the project is currently at stage one, with the acquisition of rolling stock for restoration, fencing, track laying in the yard, and the construction of a rail vehicle shed.

<doc id="525932" wikidata="Q3146515" url="?curid=525932" title="IBM Airline Control Program">
<text>IBM Airline Control Program, or ACP, is a discontinued operating system developed by IBM beginning about 1965. In contrast to previous airline transaction processing systems, the most notable aspect of ACP is that it was designed to run on most models of the IBM System/360 mainframe computer family. This departed from the earlier model in which each airline had a different, machine-specific transaction system.

==Overview==
Development began with &quot;SABRE (Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment)&quot;, &quot;Deltamatic&quot;, and &quot;PANAMAC&quot;. From these, the &quot;Programmed Airline Reservations System (PARS)&quot; was developed. In 1969 the control program, &quot;ACP&quot;, was separated from PARS. PARS kept the functions for processing airline reservations and related data.

In December 1979, ACP became known as ACP/TPF and then just TPF (Transaction Processing Facility). The transaction operating system became more widely implemented by businesses other than the major airlines, such as online credit card processing, hotel and rental car reservations, police emergency response systems, and package delivery systems.

The last &quot;free&quot; release of ACP, 9.2.1, was intended for use in bank card and similar applications. It was shipped on a &quot;mini-reel&quot; which contained a complete ACP system and its libraries for restoration to IBM 3340 disk drives. From that complete system one could easily create derivative works. A hypervisor was included, which allowed OS/370 VS1 or VS2 (SVS or MVS) to be run as a &quot;guest&quot; OS under ACP itself. The end-user documentation, which was shipped with the tape, took almost 60 linear inches of shelf space.

See also &quot;IBM Airline Control System (ALCS)&quot;, a variant of TPF specially designed to provide all the benefits of TPF (very high speed, high volume, high availability transaction processing) but with the advantages such as easier integration into the data center offered by running on a standard IBM operating system platform.

<text>The highland midge (scientific name: &quot;Culicoides impunctatus&quot;; ; ) is a species of biting midge found across the Palearctic (throughout Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, other regions of Northern Europe, Russia and Northern China) in upland and lowland areas (fens, bogs and marshes). In the north west of Scotland, and down the Western coast to north Wales, the highland midge is usually very prevalent from late spring to late summer. Female highland midges are well known for gathering in clouds and biting humans, though the majority of the blood they obtain comes from cattle, sheep and deer. The bite of &quot;Culicoides&quot; is felt as a sharp prick. It is often followed by irritating lumps that may disappear in a few hours or last for days, depending on the individual.

Following Scotland&#x27;s exceptionally cold winter in the early part of 2010, scientists found that the prolonged freezing conditions, rather than reducing the following summer&#x27;s midge population in the Scottish Highlands, in fact increased it as the cold weather had reduced the numbers of its natural predators, such as bats and birds.

==Activity==
Female midges tend to bite close to their breeding site (although they have been found up to and near to the ground. They are most active just before dawn and sunset but bite at any time of day. Midges are less active with wind speeds of over , or humidity below 60–75%.

Dry cloudless conditions are unfavourable to midges, thus they are prevalent in humid, wet and cloudy conditions. Rain does not deter them, nor does darkness. However, they tend not to go into houses or buildings, but will enter tents and cars.

==Lifecycle==
According to Wilderness Scotland: &quot;Midges mate and lay eggs in the summer months. The eggs hatch into larvae and will develop whilst living in the boggy soil. Before winter they will reach the final instar stage of their larvae development and become a pupa. The adult midge will emerge from the pupa in spring time.&quot;

== Prevention ==
Midge bites may be prevented by wearing clothes to minimise exposed skin and using a midge net to cover the head.

Insect repellents such as DEET may be used. Queen Victoria was attacked by midges when in the Highlands and permitted smoking at Balmoral Castle to deter them.

<text>The Mouvement Souveraineté-Association (MSA, &quot;English: Movement for Sovereignty-Association&quot;) was a separatist movement formed on November 19, 1967 by René Lévesque to promote the concept of sovereignty-association between Quebec and the rest of Canada.

Formerly a member of the Quebec Liberal Party, René Lévesque quit the party with a few hundred others after his proposal of a sovereign Quebec associated to the rest of Canada was rejected during a party convention. The MSA quickly began to move for a merger of all the independence movements in Quebec, which at the time were the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale (RIN) and the Ralliement national (RN).

In January 1968, the MSA published the manifesto &quot;Option Québec&quot;. From April 19 to 21, it held its first &quot;Congrès d&#x27;orientation&quot; with its 7300 members. The convention led to the publication of a groundwork document entitled &quot;Ce pays qu&#x27;on peut bâtir&quot; (This country that we can build) and the decision to create a new political party dedicated to Sovereignty-Association.

From October 11 to 14, the MSA held its first national congress in Quebec City. The merger of the MSA and the RN created the Parti Québécois (PQ). MSA leader René Lévesque was elected president of the PQ, and RN leader Gilles Grégoire became vice-president.

On October 26 Pierre Bourgault, leader of the RIN, dissolved the party and invited its members to join the PQ.

The short-lived MSA had served its purpose: sovereigntist forces in Quebec were united under a single party. Three elections later, the PQ won the 1976 provincial election, with historic consequences.

<text>Joseph Elsner (29 September 1845 in Schlaney, Silesia – 3 March 1933 in Munich) was a German architect and designer of Historicism (art).

Elsner&#x27;s work focused mainly on the interior of Catholic churches in Munich, Bavaria, and in his home region, Silesia. His mentor was .
In 1876 he married Walburga Hauser (1857–1924). They had 13 children, six of whom died as infants or toddlers.

His son, (1879–1970), was also an architect.

<text>Orthopnea or orthopnoea is shortness of breath (dyspnea) that occurs when lying flat, causing the person to have to sleep propped up in bed or sitting in a chair. It is commonly seen as a late manifestation of heart failure, resulting from fluid redistribution into the central circulation, causing an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and causing difficulty in breathing. It is also seen in cases of abdominal obesity or pulmonary disease. Orthopnea is the opposite of platypnea, shortness of breath that worsens when sitting or standing upright.

==Causes==
Orthopnea is often a symptom of left ventricular heart failure and/or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It can also occur in those with asthma and chronic bronchitis, as well as those with sleep apnea or panic disorder. It is also as associated with polycystic liver disease. From a neuromuscular perspective, orthopnea is potentially a sign of severe diaphragmatic weakness. Under such circumstances, patients may describe shortness of breath when they bend over (e.g. when tying shoelaces), called bendopnea.

==Mechanism==
Orthopnea is due to increased distribution of blood to the pulmonary circulation when a person lies flat or closer to a horizontal position. Lying flat decreases the inhibitory effect that the gravity usually has on the blood when coming back to the heart from the lower extremities of the body. This increases the right sided venous return. In a normal person, this redistribution of blood has little effect on respiratory function as the left ventricle has the adequate capacity to suddenly increase its stroke volume (as a result of the Frank-Starling mechanism). In a person with heart failure, the left ventricle has an inadequate capacity to respond to increased arrival of blood from the pulmonary circulation. This leads to the pooling up of blood in the pulmonary circulation. The increased intra-parenchymal pulmonary intravascular pressure can also result in hydrostatic pressure related fluid transudation into the alveoli, thus causing cardiogenic pulmonary edema and further worsening shortness of breath. Thus, shortness of breath is commonly experienced after a reasonably short time lying near to flat for a person with left ventricular failure. This is different from the dyspnea experienced by someone with lung parenchymal pathology (both restrictive and obstructive) when lying down, which is sudden and instead related to an acute change in diaphragmatic/accessory respiratory muscle mechanical advantage lost when moving the body into a more horizontal position.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based mostly on the clinical features and symptoms, as well as finding causes like heart failure.

==Treatment==
Based on the cause, orthopnea can be treated with respiratory support devices such as CPAP or biPAP while the disease causing it is addressed.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;orthopnea&quot; uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, from Greek &quot;ortho&quot;, straight, regular, + &quot;pnoia&quot;, breath. See pronunciation information at &quot;dyspnea&quot;.

<text>The Truce of Ulm () (also known as the Treaty of Ulm) was signed in Ulm on 14 March 1647 between France, Sweden, and Bavaria. This truce was developed after France and Sweden invaded Bavaria during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Both invading nations forced Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, to conclude the truce and renounce his alliance with Emperor Ferdinand III. However, Maximilian broke the truce on 14 September and returned to his alliance with Ferdinand.

<doc id="525954" wikidata="Q2167748" url="?curid=525954" title="Osteotomy">
<text>An osteotomy is a surgical operation whereby a bone is cut to shorten or lengthen it or to change its alignment. It is sometimes performed to correct a hallux valgus, or to straighten a bone that has healed crookedly following a fracture. It is also used to correct a coxa vara, genu valgum, and genu varum. The operation is done under a general anaesthetic.

Osteotomy is one method to relieve pain of arthritis, especially of the hip and knee. It is being replaced by joint replacement in the older patient.

Due to the serious nature of this procedure, recovery may be extensive. Careful consultation with a physician is important in order to ensure proper planning during a recovery phase. Tools exist to assist recovering patients who may have non–weight bearing requirements and include bedpans, dressing sticks, long-handled shoe-horns, grabbers/reachers and specialized walkers and wheelchairs.

==Osteotomies of the hip==

Two main types of osteotomies are used in the correction of hip dysplasias and deformities to improve alignment/interaction of acetabulum – (socket) – and femoral head (femur head) – (ball), innominate osteotomies and femoral osteotomies. The bones are cut, reshaped or partially removed to realign the load-bearing surfaces of the joint.

Adjustments are made to part of the hip-bone. Many operating methods and variations have been developed. They are defined by the type of cut and adjustment made. Some acetabular procedures are named after the surgeons who first described them as Salter (R. Salter), Dega (W. Dega), Sutherland (D.H. Sutherland), Chiari (K. Chiari): other names one may encounter are Ludlov, P. Pemberton, and James B. Steele. Some are named after the shape of cut (e.g. Chevron, Wedge) or the way the bones are aligned (Dial=old style rotary dial phone).

A femoral derotation osteotomy can be performed to correct version abnormalities such as excessive anteversion or retroversion of the hip joint. Excessive anteversion of the femur results in anterior instability of the hip joint while excessive retroversion results in femoroacetabular hip impingement.

A subtrochanteric blade plate or an intramedullary rod can be used to stabilize the osteotomy site in a femoral derotation osteotomy until compete bone healing is achieved; an approach employing an intramedullary rod is much less invasive than one using a subtrochanteric blade plate.}

Femoral osteotomies, as the name indicates, involves adjustments made to the femur head and/or the femur.

==Osteotomy of the knee==

Knee osteotomy is commonly used to realign arthritic damage on one side of the knee. The goal is to shift the patient&#x27;s body weight off the damaged area to the other side of the knee, where the cartilage is still healthy. Surgeons remove a wedge of the tibia from underneath the healthy side of the knee, which allows the tibia and femur to bend away from the damaged cartilage.

A model for this is the hinges on a door. When the door is shut, the hinges are flush against the wall. As the door swings open, one side of the door remains pressed against the wall as space opens up on the other side. Removing just a small wedge of bone can &quot;swing&quot; the knee open, pressing the healthy tissue together as space opens up between the femur and tibia on the damaged side so that the arthritic surfaces do not rub against each other.

Osteotomy is also used as an alternative treatment to total knee replacement in younger and active patients. Because prosthetic knees may wear out over time, an osteotomy procedure can enable younger, active osteoarthritis patients to continue using the healthy portion of their knee. The procedure can delay the need for a total knee replacement for up to ten years.

===Surgery===
The location of the removed wedge of bone depends on where osteoarthritis has damaged the knee cartilage. The most common type of osteotomy performed on arthritic knees is a high tibial osteotomy, which addresses cartilage damage on the inside (medial) portion of the knee. The procedure usually takes 60 to 90 minutes to perform.

During a high tibial osteotomy, surgeons remove a wedge of bone from the outside of the knee, which causes the leg to bend slightly inward. This resembles the realigning of a bowlegged knee to a knock-kneed position. The patient&#x27;s weight is transferred to the outside (lateral) portion of the knee, where the cartilage is still healthy.

After regional or general anesthesia is administered, the surgical team sterilizes the leg with antibacterial solution.
Surgeons map out the exact size of the bone wedge they will remove, using an X-ray, CT scan, or 3D computer modeling.
A four- to five-inch incision is made down the front and outside of the knee, starting below the kneecap and extending below the top of the shinbone.Guide wires are drilled into the top of the shinbone (tibia plateau) from the outside (lateral side) of the knee. The wires usually outline a triangle form in the shinbone.

A standard oscillating saw is run along the guide wires, removing most of the bone wedge from underneath the outside of the knee, below the healthy cartilage. The cartilage surface on the top of the outside (lateral side) of the shinbone is left intact. The top of the shinbone is then lowered on the outside and attached with surgical staples or screws, depending on the size of the wedge that was removed. The layers of tissue in the knee are stitched together, usually with absorbable sutures.

===Rehabilitation and prevention===

A fall or torque to the leg during the first two months after surgery may jeopardize healing. Patients must exercise extreme caution during all activities, including walking, until healing is complete.

After rehabilitation, preventing osteoarthritis involves slowing the progression and spread of the disease. Maintaining aerobic cardiovascular fitness has been an effective method for preventing the progression of osteoarthritis. Light, daily exercise is much better for an arthritic knee than occasional, heavy exercise.

It is especially important to avoid any serious knee injuries, such as torn ligaments or fractured bones, because arthritis can complicate knee injury treatment. High-impact or repetitive stress sports, like football and distance running, should be avoided.

Because osteoarthritis has multiple causes and may be related to genetic factors, no universal prevention tactic exists.

General recommendations include:
* Keeping a slight bend in the knees will take the pressure off during standing.
* Avoid activities that causes pain which lasts over an hour.
* Perform controlled range of motion activities that do not overload the joint.
* Avoid heavy impact on the knees during everyday and athletic activities.
* Gently strengthen thigh and lower leg muscles to help protect the bones and cartilage in the knee.
* Non-contact activities keep joints and bones healthy and maintain fitness over time. Exercise also helps promote weight loss, which can take stress off knees.

== Osteotomy of the jaw ==

This is performed to realign the mandible (lower jaw) or maxilla (upper jaw) with the rest of the skull and/or teeth. This is usually performed to correct skeletal malocclusions, that is discrepancies in tooth position that cannot be corrected by simple orthodontic movement, and realignment of the temporomandibular joints, or to correct facial deformities such as mandibular retrognathia. There is little scarring, and all of the surgery takes places inside of the mouth. Orthodontic braces may have to be worn pre- and post- operation to realign the teeth to match the newly realigned jaw.

== Osteotomy of the chin ==

Chin osteotomy is most often done to correct a vertically short chin. As opposed to putting an implant on top of the chin bone to bring it forward, an alternative approach is to cut the chin bone itself and bring it forward or other directions as well. It can also be used to lengthen the chin (which is more difficult with an implant) or to shorten or narrow a chin. (which is impossible with an implant).

Chin osteotomies (cutting the bone and moving it) are done through an incision inside the mouth. It is technically more difficult than an implant and has more swelling and recovery than a simple chin implant. Also, there is usually temporary loss of feeling of the lip and chin after that takes several weeks to months for full return of sensation.

==Veterinary osteotomy procedures==

In veterinary medicine, osteotomies are frequently performed to address rupture of the canine cranial cruciate ligament, which is analogous to the anterior cruciate ligament. The tibial plateau leveling osteotomy and tibial tuberosity advancement are two of the most common osteotomy procedures performed in the United States. Recovery is often 6–8 weeks and the osteotomy can be filled with autologous bone grafts, scaffolds (hydroxyapatite, TR Matrix, etc.) or ceramics.

<doc id="525959" wikidata="Q1138267" url="?curid=525959" title="Coxa vara">
<text>Coxa vara is a deformity of the hip, whereby the angle between the head and the shaft of the femur is reduced to less than 120 degrees. This results in the leg being shortened and the development of a limp. It may be congenital and is commonly caused by injury, such as a fracture. It can also occur when the bone tissue in the neck of the femur is softer than normal, causing it to bend under the weight of the body. This may either be congenital or the result of a bone disorder. The most common cause of coxa vara is either congenital or developmental. Other common causes include metabolic bone diseases (e.g. Paget&#x27;s disease of bone), post-Perthes deformity, osteomyelitis, and post traumatic (due to improper healing of a fracture between the greater and lesser trochanter). Shepherd&#x27;s Crook deformity is a severe form of coxa vara where the proximal femur is severely deformed with a reduction in the neck shaft angle beyond 90 degrees. It is most commonly a sequela of osteogenesis imperfecta, Paget&#x27;s disease, osteomyelitis, tumour and tumour-like conditions (e.g. fibrous dysplasia).

Coxa vara can happen in cleidocranial dysostosis.

==Anatomy==
In early skeletal development, a common physis serves the greater trochanter and the capital femoral epiphysis. This physis divides as growth continues in a balance that favors the capital epiphysis and creates a normal neck shaft angle (angle between the femoral shaft and the neck). The corresponding angle at maturity is 135 ± 7 degrees. Another angle used for the measurement of coxa vara is the cervicofemoral angle which is approximately 35 degrees at infancy and increases to 45 degrees after maturity.

==Types==
===Developmental===
* primary defect in endochondral ossification of the medial part of the femoral neck (Most common cause)
* Excessive interuterine pressure on the developing fetal hip
* vascular insult
* Faulty maturation of the cartilage and metaphyseal bone of the femoral neck

Clinical feature: presents after the child has started walking but before six years of age. Usually associated with a painless hip due to mild abductor weakness and mild limb length discrepancy.

If there is a bilateral involvement the child might have a waddling gait or trendelenburg gait with an increased lumbar lordosis. The greater trochanter is usually prominent on palpation and is more proximal. Restricted abduction and internal rotation.

X-ray: decreased neck shaft angle, increased cervicofemoral angle, vertical physis, shortened femoral neck decrease in femoral anteversion. HE angle (Hilgenriener epiphyseal angle- angle subtended between a horizontal line connecting the triradiate cartilage and the epiphysis); normal angle is &lt;30 degrees.

Treatment:
HE angle of 45–60 degrees: observation and periodic follow up.

Indication for surgery: HE angle more than 60 degrees, progressive deformity, neck-shaft angle &lt;90 degrees, development of Trendelenburg gait

Surgery: subtrochanteric valgus osteotomy with adequate internal rotation of distal fragment to correct anteversion;
common complication is recurrence. If HE angle is reduced to 38 degrees, less evidence of recurrence; 
post operative spica cast is used for a period of 6–8 weeks.

Coxa vara is also seen in Niemann–Pick disease.

===Congenital ===
Presence at birth is extremely rare and associated with other congenital anomalies such as proximal femoral focal deficiency, fibular hemimelia or anomalies in other part of the body such as cleidocranial dyastosis. The femoral deformity is present in the subtrochanteric area where the bone is bent. The cortices are thickened and may be associated with overlying skin dimples. External rotation of the femur with valgus deformity of knee may be noted. This condition does not resolve and requires surgical management. Surgical management includes valgus osteotomy to improve hip biomechanics and length and rotational osteotomy to correct retroversion and lengthening.

<doc id="525960" wikidata="Q854353" url="?curid=525960" title="Enteritis">
<text>Enteritis is inflammation of the small intestine. It is most commonly caused by food or drink contaminated with pathogenic microbes, such as &quot;Serratia&quot;, but may have other causes such as NSAIDs, radiation therapy as well as autoimmune conditions like coeliac disease. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhoea, dehydration, and fever. Related diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) system (including gastritis, gastroenteritis, colitis, and enterocolitis) may involve inflammation of the stomach and large intestine.

Duodenitis, jejunitis, and ileitis are subtypes of enteritis which are localised to a specific part of the small intestine. Inflammation of both the stomach and small intestine is referred to as gastroenteritis.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of enteritis are highly variable and vary based on the specific cause and other factors such as individual variance and stage of disease.
Symptoms may include abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, dehydration, fever, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.

== Causes ==

=== Immune mediated ===
Crohn&#x27;s disease – also known as regional enteritis, it can occur along any surface of the gastrointestinal tract. The most common location for Crohn&#x27;s disease to manifest, with or without the involvement of the colon or other parts of the GI tract, is in the terminal ileum (the final segment of the small intestine). In 40% of cases, it is limited to the small intestine.

=== Autoimmune ===
Coeliac disease – caused by an autoimmune reaction to gluten by genetically predisposed individuals.

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis, also known as eosinophilic enteropathy or eosinophilic enteritis – a rare and heterogeneous condition where eosinophils build up in the gastrointestinal tract and blood vessels, leading to polyp formation, necrosis, inflammation and ulcers. It is most commonly seen in patients with a history of atopy, however is overall relatively uncommon.

=== Infectious enteritis ===
In Germany, 90% of cases of infectious enteritis are caused by four pathogens, Norovirus, &quot;Rotavirus&quot;, &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, and &quot;Salmonella&quot;. Other common causes of infectious enteritis include bacteria such as &quot;Shigella&quot; and &quot;E. coli,&quot; as well as viruses such as adenovirus, astrovirus, and calicivirus. Other less common pathogens include &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot;, &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;, &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;.

&quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; is one of the most common sources of infectious enteritis, and the most common bacterial pathogen found in two-year-old and smaller children with diarrhoea. It has been linked to consumption of contaminated water and food, most commonly poultry and milk. The disease tends to be less severe in developing countries, due to the constant exposure which people have with the antigen in the environment, leading to early development of antibodies.

Rotavirus is responsible for infecting 140 million people and causing 1 million deaths each year, mostly in children younger than five years. This makes it the most common cause of severe childhood diarrhoea and diarrhea-related deaths in the world. It selectively targets mature enterocytes in the small intestine, causing malabsorption, as well as inducing secretion of water. It has also been observed to cause villus ischemia, and increase intestinal motility. The net result of these changes is induced diarrhoea.

Enteritis necroticans is an often fatal illness, caused by β-toxin of &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;. This causes inflammation and segments of necrosis throughout the gastrointestinal tract. It is most common in developing countries; however, it has also been documented in post-World War II Germany. Risk factors for enteritis necroticans include decreased trypsin activity, which prevent intestinal degradation of the toxin, and reduced intestinal motility, which increases likelihood of toxin accumulation.

=== Vascular disease ===
Ischemic enteritis is uncommon compared to ischemic colitis due to the highly vascularised nature of the small intestine, allowing for sufficient blood flow in most situations. It develops due to circulatory shock of mesenteric vessels in the absence of major vessel occlusion, often associated with an underlying condition such as hypertension, arrhythmia, or diabetes. Thus, it has been considered to be associated with atherosclerosis. Surgical treatment is usually required due to the likelihood of stenosis or complete occlusion of the small intestine. Ischemic damage can range from mucosal infarction, which is limited only to the mucosa; mural infarction of the mucosa and underlying submucosa; to transmural infarction of the full thickness of the gastrointestinal wall. Mucosal and mural infarcts in and of themselves may not be fatal, however may progress further to a transmural infarct. This has the potential for perforation of the wall, leading to peritonitis.

=== Radiation enteritis ===
Inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract is common after treatment with radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis. It is classified as early if it manifests within the first three months, and delayed if it manifests three months after treatment. Early radiation enteritis is caused by cell death of the crypt epithelium and subsequent mucosal inflammation, however usually subsides after the course of radiation therapy is completed. Delayed radiation enteritis is a chronic disease which has a complex pathogenesis involving changes in the majority of the intestinal wall.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis may be simple in cases where the patient&#x27;s signs and symptoms are idiopathic. However, this is generally not the case, considering that many pathogens which cause enteritis may exhibit similar symptoms, especially early in the disease. In particular, &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, &quot;Shigella&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot; and many other bacteria induce acute self-limited colitis, an inflammation of the lining of the colon which appears similar under the microscope.

A medical history, physical examination and tests such as blood counts, stool cultures, CT scans, MRIs, PCRs, colonoscopies and upper endoscopies may be used in order to perform a differential diagnosis. A biopsy may be required to obtain a sample for histopathology.

== Treatment ==

Mild cases usually do not require treatment and will go away after a few days in healthy people. In cases where symptoms persist or when it is more severe, specific treatments based on the initial cause may be required.

In cases where diarrhea is present, replenishing lost fluids is recommended, and in cases with prolonged or severe diarrhoea which persists, intravenous rehydration therapy or antibiotics may be required. A simple oral rehydration therapy (ORS) can be made by dissolving one teaspoon of salt, eight teaspoons of sugar and the juice of an orange into one litre of clean water. Studies have shown the efficacy of antibiotics in reducing the duration of the symptoms of infectious enteritis of bacterial origin, however antibiotic treatments are usually not required due to the self-limiting duration of infectious enteritis.

=== Autoimmune ===

Autoimmune causes of enteritis such as Crohn&#x27;s disease require significant chronic treatment to avoid nutritional deficiencies, cancer, bacterial overgrowth, and other complications. Some patients with mild forms of the disease may not need treatment, but a majority of people with Crohn&#x27;s disease require glucocorticoid medications. 

For treating eosinophilic gastroenteritis, the main treatment is usually a corticosteroid medication, as these have been shown to have good efficacy in managing eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Other treatments include modifying diets to avoid food allergies, azathioprine and antibodies, including mepolizumab, omalizumab, infliximab, and adalimumab.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;enteritis&quot; () uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, both Neo-Latin from Greek, respectively from ἑντερον (&quot;enteron&quot;, small intestine) and -ιτις (&quot;-itis&quot;, inflammation).

<text>Wawona (formerly Big Tree Station, Clark&#x27;s Station, Clarks Station, Wah-wo-nah, and Clark&#x27;s Ranch) is a census-designated place in Mariposa County, California, United States. The population was 111 at the 2020 census.

It is located entirely within Yosemite National Park, as it preceded the founding of the park as a national recreation area. The number of inhabitants increases dramatically during peak tourist seasons, due to the large number of rental cabins in the town. It is located at , north of Oakhurst and south of the center of Yosemite Valley, at an elevation of .

The ZIP Code is 95389. The community is inside area code 209.

==History==
It was known to the local Native American Miwok in their language as &quot;Pallachun&quot; (&quot;a good place to stay&quot;). The origin of the word &quot;Wawona&quot; is not known. A popular story claims &quot;Wawō&#x27;na&quot; was the Miwok word for &quot;big tree&quot;, or for &quot;hoot of the owl&quot;, a bird considered the sequoia trees&#x27; spiritual guardian.

Galen Clark, who helped gain preservation legislation for Mariposa Grove and what became Yosemite National Park, occupied this area in 1855. He established a tourist rest and modest ranch in 1856. Clark sold the property to the Washburn brothers in 1874, who built a larger hotel in 1876, adding to it later. Hotel keeper Jean Bruce Washburn named the resort property Wawona in 1883.

Wawona is the location of the historic Wawona Hotel, built by Washburn in 1876, with additional structures added into the early 20th century. A classic Victorian resort, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987.

The Clark&#x27;s Station US Post Office opened in 1878. In 1883 its name was changed to Wawona.

==Geography==
The town is located in a large mid-elevation basin with Wawona Meadow as its centerpiece. Situated in the southwest part of Yosemite National Park, it lies along the South Fork of the Merced River at an elevation of about 4,000 feet (1,200 m). The town is accessible via State Route 41, the main highway from Fresno to Yosemite Valley. Wawona is the closest town to Chilnualna Falls and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoia. It also serves as the main gateway to the southern Yosemite wilderness, with several principal trailheads located here.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Wawona CDP covers an area of , all of it land.

==Demographics==

The racial makeup of Wawona was 138 (81.7%) White, 2 (1.2%) African American, 3 (1.8%) Native American, 4 (2.4%) Asian, 0 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 8 (4.7%) from other races, and 14 (8.3%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 12 persons (7.1%).

There were 4 (5.6%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 2 (2.8%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 26 households (36.6%) were made up of individuals, and 2 (2.8%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.30. There were 36 families (50.7% of all households); the average family size was 2.94.

The population was spread out, with 32 people (18.9%) under the age of 18, 10 people (5.9%) aged 18 to 24, 46 people (27.2%) aged 25 to 44, 66 people (39.1%) aged 45 to 64, and 15 people (8.9%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 141.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 149.1 males.

There were 370 housing units at an average density of , of which 22 (31.0%) were owner-occupied, and 49 (69.0%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 4.3%; the rental vacancy rate was 2.0%. 45 people (26.6% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 118 people (69.8%) lived in rental housing units.

<text>Thomas Wright Blakiston (27 December 1832 – 15 October 1891) was an English explorer and naturalist.

==Early life and career==
Born in Lymington, Hampshire, Blakiston was the son of Major John Blakiston. His grandfather was Sir Matthew Blakiston, 2nd Baronet Blakiston. His mother Jane was the daughter of Reverend Thomas Wright, Rector of Market Bosworth, Leicestershire.

Blakiston explored western Canada with the Palliser Expedition between 1857 and 1859. Mount Blakiston, the highest point in Waterton Lakes National Park was named for him in 1858. In 1861, he traveled up the Yangtze River in China, going further than any Westerner before him. He spent the next part of his life in Japan and became one of the major naturalists in that country. Blakiston was the first person to notice that animals in Hokkaidō, Japan&#x27;s northern island, were related to northern Asian species, whereas those on Honshū to the south were related to those from southern Asia. The Tsugaru Strait between the two islands was therefore established as a zoogeographical boundary, and became known as &quot;Blakiston&#x27;s Line&quot;. Blakiston collected an owl specimen in Hakodate, Japan in 1883. This was later described by Henry Seebohm and named Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl.

He moved to the United States in 1885.

==Personal life and death==
Blakiston married Ann Mary Dun in 1885. She was the daughter of James Dun and the sister of Edwin Dun. They had one daughter and one son. Ann Mary survived him by 46 years and died in England in March 1937.

Blakiston died of pneumonia in October 1891 while in San Diego, California. He was buried at Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio, in his wife&#x27;s family plot.

<doc id="525963" wikidata="Q410291" url="?curid=525963" title="Verapamil">
<text>Verapamil, sold under various trade names, is a calcium channel blocker medication used for the treatment of high blood pressure, angina (chest pain from not enough blood flow to the heart), and supraventricular tachycardia. It may also be used for the prevention of migraines and cluster headaches. It is given by mouth or by injection into a vein.
Common side effects include headache, low blood pressure, nausea, and constipation. Other side effects include allergic reactions and muscle pains. It is not recommended in people with a slow heart rate or heart failure. It is believed to cause problems for the fetus if used during pregnancy. It is in the non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker family of medications.
Verapamil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Verapamil is available as a generic medication. Long acting formulations exist. In 2022, it was the 188th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Verapamil is used for controlling ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and migraine headache prevention.

Verapamil is also used for the treatment of angina (chronic stable, vasospastic or Prinzmetal variant), unstable angina (crescendo, preinfarction), and for the prevention of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).

Verapamil is a class-IV antiarrhythmic and more effective than digoxin in controlling ventricular rate. Verapamil is not listed as a first line antihypertensive agent by the guidelines provided by &quot;JAMA&quot; in JNC-8. However, it may be used to treat hypertension if patient has co-morbid atrial fibrillation or other types of arrhythmia.

Verapamil is used intra-arterially to treat cerebral vasospasm. It is also used to treat cluster headaches. Tentative evidence supports the use of verapamil topically to treat plantar fibromatosis.

Use of verapamil in people with recent onset of type 1 diabetes may improve pancreatic beta cell function. In a 2023 meta-analysis involving data from two randomized controlled trials (113 patients with recent onset type-1 diabetes), it was demonstrated that the use of verapamil over one year was associated with significantly higher C-peptide area under the curve levels. Higher C-peptide levels means better pancreatic insulin production and beta cell function.

Verapamil has been reported to be effective in both short-term and long-term treatment of mania and hypomania. Addition of magnesium oxide to the verapamil treatment protocol enhances the antimanic effect.

==Contraindications==
Use of verapamil is generally avoided in people with severe left ventricular dysfunction, hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg), cardiogenic shock, and hypersensitivity to verapamil. It is also contraindicated in people with atrial flutter or fibrillation and an existing accessory tract such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

==Side effects==
The most common side effect of verapamil is constipation (7.3%). While the definite mechanism by which verapamil causes constipation has not been studied, studies have been conducted to rule out mechanisms of actions that might yield this adverse effect. A 1992 study found that verapamil causes a delay in colonic transit but does not affect upper gastrointestinal transit.

Other side effects include dizziness (3.3%), nausea (2.7%), low blood pressure (2.5%), and headache 2.2%. Other side effects seen in less than 2% of the population include: edema, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, diarrhea, fatigue, elevated liver enzymes, shortness of breath, low heart rate, atrioventricular block, rash and flushing. Along with other calcium channel blockers, verapamil is known to induce gingival enlargement.

===Overdose===
Acute overdose is often manifested by nausea, weakness, slow heart rate, dizziness, low blood pressure, and abnormal heart rhythms. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of verapamil and norverapamil, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Blood or plasma verapamil concentrations are usually in a range of 50–500 μg/L in persons on therapy with the drug, but may rise to 1–4 mg/L in acute overdose patients and are often at levels of 5–10 mg/L in fatal poisonings.

==Mechanism of action==
Verapamil&#x27;s mechanism in all cases is to block voltage-dependent calcium channels. In cardiac pharmacology, calcium channel blockers are considered class-IV antiarrhythmic agents. Since calcium channels are especially concentrated in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, these agents can be used to decrease impulse conduction through the AV node, thus protecting the ventricles from atrial tachyarrhythmias. Specific conditions that fall under the definition of atrial tachyarrhythmias are atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, multifocal atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and so on.

Verapamil is also a Kv voltage gated potassium channel blocker.

Calcium channels are also present in the smooth muscle lining blood vessels. By relaxing the tone of this smooth muscle, calcium channel blockers dilate the blood vessels. This has led to their use in treating high blood pressure and angina pectoris. The pain of angina is caused by a deficit in oxygen supply to the heart.

Calcium channel blockers like verapamil dilate the coronary blood vessels, which increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. They also cause dilatation of systemic peripheral vessels as well, causing a reduction in the workload of the heart. Thereby reducing myocardial oxygen consumption.

===Cluster headaches===
Preventive therapy with verapamil is believed to work because it has an effect on the circadian rhythm and on CGRPs, as CGRP-release is controlled by voltage-gated calcium channels.

==Pharmacokinetic details==
More than 90% of verapamil is absorbed when given orally, but due to high first-pass metabolism, bioavailability is much lower (10–35%). It is 90% bound to plasma proteins and has a volume of distribution of 3–5 L/kg. It takes 1 to 2 hours to reach peak plasma concentration after oral administration. It is metabolized in the liver to at least 12 inactive metabolites (though one metabolite, norverapamil, retains 20% of the vasodilatory activity of the parent drug). As its metabolites, 70% is excreted in the urine and 16% in feces; 3–4% is excreted unchanged in urine. This is a nonlinear dependence between plasma concentration and dosage. Onset of action is 1 to 2 hours after oral dosage, and 3 to 5 minutes after intravenous bolus dosage. Biphasic or triphasic following IV administration; terminal elimination half-life is 2–8 hours. Plasma half-life of 2–8 or 4.5–12 hours after single oral dose or multiple oral doses, respectively. It is not cleared by hemodialysis. It is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued while verapamil is administered.

==Veterinary use==
Intra-abdominal adhesions are common in rabbits following surgery. Verapamil can be given postoperatively in rabbits which have suffered trauma to abdominal organs to prevent formation of these adhesions. Such effect was not documented in another study with ponies.

==Uses in cell biology==
Verapamil inhibits the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family of proteins found in stem cells and has been used to study cancer stem cells (CSC) within head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.

Verapamil is also used in cell biology as an inhibitor of drug efflux pump proteins such as P-glycoprotein and other ABC transporter proteins. This is useful, as many tumor cell lines overexpress drug efflux pumps, limiting the effectiveness of cytotoxic drugs or fluorescent tags. It is also used in fluorescent cell sorting for DNA content, as it blocks efflux of a variety of DNA-binding fluorophores such as Hoechst 33342. Radioactively labelled verapamil and positron emission tomography can be used with to measure P-glycoprotein function.

<text>Charles-Irénée Castel, abbé de Saint-Pierre (18 February 1658 – 29 April 1743) was a French author.

== Biography ==
In 1718, Saint-Pierre published &quot;Discours sur la polysynodie&quot;, where he proposed that appointed ministers be replaced by elected councils. As a consequence of his criticism of the policy of Louis XIV (died 1715) he was expelled from the Académie later the same year.

In 1723, with Pierre-Joseph Alary he founded the Club de l&#x27;Entresol, an early modern think tank in Paris; the club was closed for political reasons in 1731.

He died in Paris on 29 April 1743.

== Ideas ==
Saint-Pierre&#x27;s works are centered on an acute and visionary criticism of politics, law and social institutions. He had a great influence on Rousseau, who left elaborate examinations of some of them, and was a forerunner of Kant&#x27;s 1795 essay on perpetual peace. His was published in 1713 in Utrecht, where he was acting as secretary to the French plenipotentiary, the Abbé de Polignac, and his contained severe strictures on the government of Louis XIV, with projects for the administration of France by a system of councils for each department of government. His works include a number of memorials and projects for stopping duelling, equalizing taxation, treating mendicancy, reforming education and spelling, etc. It was not, however, for his suggestions for the reform of the constitution that he was disgraced, but because in the he had refused to Louis XIV the title of .

Saint-Pierre was one of the first to mention the possibility of a European union made by independent and autonomous states. His work on a European community directly inspired the idea of an international order based on the principle of collective self-defense, and was important to the creation of the Concert of Europe, and later the League of Nations, whose successor is the United Nations Organisation. Friederich the Great of Prussia, writing to Voltaire about the &quot;Projet pour rendre la paix perpétuelle en Europe&quot;, stated that: &quot;The Abbe de Saint-Pierre has sent me a fine work on how to re-establish peace in Europe. The thing is very practicable. All it lacks to be successful, is the consent of all Europe and a few other such small details.&quot;

<text>The Kraków Uprising (Polish: &quot;powstanie krakowskie&quot;, &quot;rewolucja krakowska&quot;; German: &quot;Krakauer Aufstand&quot;; Russian: &quot;краковское восстание&quot;) of 1846 was an attempt, led by Polish insurgents such as Jan Tyssowski and Edward Dembowski, to incite a fight for national independence. The uprising was centered on the city of Kraków, the capital of a small state of Free City of Krakow. It was directed at the powers that partitioned Poland, in particular the nearby Austrian Empire. The uprising lasted about nine days and ended with an Austrian victory.

==Background==
The uprising was primarily organized and supported by members of the Polish nobility and middle class, who desired the restoration of Polish independence after the 1795 partitions of Poland ended its existence as a sovereign state; there was also support for various political and social reforms (such as the demands for the emancipation of peasants and an end to serfdom). Many of the insurgents&#x27; ideas were developed in exile by activists from organizations such as the Polish Democratic Society. The uprising was supposed to take place in other locations, but poor coordination and arrests by authorities broke many other cells, most notably in Greater Poland. The uprising was also supported by some local peasants from the Free City and the miners of the Wieliczka salt mine. The Free City of Krakow, nominally independent, was a central place for pro-Polish independence activists to discuss their plans.

==Initial success==
The uprising began on the night of 20 February 1846. It was successful in a short term, briefly taking over the city of Kraków. Faced with riots, demonstrations and barricades, a small Austrian force in the city under General Ludwig Collin quickly retreated. A provisional government formed on 22 February. That day it issued a radical &quot;Manifesto for the Polish Nation&quot;, in which it ordered the end of many elements of serfdom, such as corvée, declared universal suffrage, and other revolutionary ideas inspired by the French Revolution.

Most of the uprising was limited to the Free City of Krakow, where its leaders included Jagiellonian University philosophy professor Michał Wiszniewski, and lecturer and lawyer Jan Tyssowski, who declared himself a dictator on 24 February (Tyssowski was assisted by radical democrat, acting as his secretary, Edward Dembowski, who according to some might have been the real leader of the revolutionary government). On 27 February a struggle for power developed, and Wiszniewski, after a failed attempt to take power, was exiled by Tyssowski and Dembowski within a matter of hours.

==Suppression==

Austrian forces in the area were led by Ludwig von Benedek. The revolutionaries, despite some support from the Free City and its immediate surroundings, fared badly in the wider countryside. They had up to 6,000 volunteers, but many were badly trained and poorly armed. The rebels suffered a defeat on 26 February at the Battle of Gdów and were quickly dispersed by von Benedek&#x27;s forces. The Polish commander, Colonel Jakub Suchorzewski, was criticized for poor leadership, and for not taking sufficient precautions despite scout reports of an approaching enemy force. The battle was very short, as the Polish forces collapsed almost immediately, with most of the infantry captured or killed by the peasants accompanying the Austrian forces.

The uprising was soon suppressed by the Austrian army with help from local peasants. The peasant counter-revolt, known as the Galician slaughter, was likely encouraged by the Austrian authorities, who exploited the peasants&#x27; dissatisfaction with the landowners. It was ironic, as historian Eric Hobsbawm has noted, that the peasants turned their anger on the revolutionaries, whose ideals included the improvement of peasant situation. Instead, most peasants trusted the Austrian officials, some of whom even promised the peasants to end serfdom and pay a stipend for their participation in the militia aimed at quashing the Polish noble insurgents. In one village, when the rebels tried to persuade the peasants that they would be better off if the Austrians were expelled, the peasants replied that they were familiar with stories of landowner brutality under the Polish Commonwealth and that they were glad they could now complain to the Austrian emperor.

It is estimated that about 1,000–2,000 Polish nobility who supported the uprising died in the conflict. According to Judson, the Austrian military in fact had to intervene at one point to stop the violence and protect the rebels.

According to Lerski, Dembowski was apprehended and executed by the Austrians. Others, such as Nance, Davies and Zamoyski however provide another account of his death; according to these sources he died on 27 February fighting the Austrian army, after a religious procession with which he attempted to quell the peasants was attacked. Whatever the case, the government of Tyssowski surrendered, just nine days after taking power, and Kraków was occupied first by Russians (on 3 March), and soon afterward (perhaps on the same day), by the Austrians under Collin. (Davies however writes that Russians joined Austrians on 4 March). Tyssowski, who crossed the Prussian border with about 1,500 soldiers on 4 March, was interned, and later emigrated to the United States.

==Aftermath==

Austria and Russia signed a treaty on 16 November, deciding to end the status of Kraków as the Free City. Subsequently, Kraków and its surrounding area were annexed to the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, a province of the Austrian Empire, with its capital at Lemberg (Lwów, Lviv). This violation of the 1815 Treaty of Vienna caused a short lived scandal in European politics of the day. Kraków would be relegated to the role of a provincial capital in the Empire.

==Significance==
As noted by Anderson, despite its failure, the uprising was seen by some scholars, including Karl Marx, as a &quot;deeply democratic movement that aimed at land reform and other pressing social questions&quot;. The uprising was praised by Marx and Friedrich Engels for being &quot;the first in Europe to plant the banner of social revolution&quot;, and seen by them, as well as some modern scholars, precursor to the coming Spring of Nations. This view is common in the Polish historiography.

The Uprising, and related events in partitioned Poland (namely the Greater Poland Uprising 1846 and the Galician slaughter), were widely discussed in the contemporary European press.

The Austrian Empire, and the Metternich regime, ultimately lost out in the propaganda war that followed the Uprising. The fact that the peasantry supported the Austrians over a return to Polish rule was lost, with the rebels successfully claiming that the Austrians had effectively bought off the peasants and turned them against their national leaders. The conservative Metternich also would struggle to openly admit that peasant violence was justifiable, even if it was in support of the Habsburg Empire.

As soon as the Kraków Uprising was put down, the Austrians pacified the insurgent peasantry, briefly restoring the feudal order. Those peasants who stood down and followed the authorities, like the peasant leader Jakub Szela, were rewarded. Nonetheless, in Austria, reforms were spurred by the Kraków Uprising of 1846 and the Spring of Nations in 1848, resulting in the abolishment of serfdom in 1848.

<doc id="525971" wikidata="Q1048315" url="?curid=525971" title="Little Russia">
<text>Little Russia, also known as Lesser Russia, Malorussia, or Little Rus&#x27;, is a geographical and historical term used to describe Ukraine.

At the beginning of the 14th century, the patriarch of Constantinople accepted the distinction between what it called the eparchies of &quot;Megalē Rosiia&quot; () and &quot;Mikrà Rosiia&quot; (). The jurisdiction of the latter became the metropolis of Halych in 1303. The specific meaning of the adjectives &quot;Great&quot; and &quot;Little&quot; in this context is unclear. It is possible that terms such as &quot;Little&quot; and &quot;Lesser&quot; at the time simply meant geographically smaller and/or less populous, or having fewer eparchies. Another possibility is that it denoted a relationship similar to that between a homeland and a colony (just as &quot;Magna Graecia&quot; denoted a Greek colony). 

The name went out of use in the 15th century as distinguishing the &quot;Great&quot; and &quot;Little&quot; was no longer necessary since the Russian Orthodox Church based in Moscow was no longer tied to Kiev. However, with the rise of the Catholic Ruthenian Uniate Church in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Orthodox prelates attempting to seek support from Moscow revived the name using the Greek-influenced spelling: &quot;Malaia Rossiia&quot; (&quot;Little Russia&quot;). Then, &quot;Little Russia&quot; developed into a political and geographical concept in Russia, referring to most of the territory of modern-day Ukraine, especially the territory of the Cossack Hetmanate. Accordingly, derivatives such as &quot;Little Russian&quot; () were commonly applied to the people, language, and culture of the area. A large part of the region&#x27;s elite population adopted a Little Russian identity that competed with the local Ukrainian identity. The territories of modern-day southern Ukraine, after being annexed by Russia in the 18th century, became known as Novorossiya (&quot;New Russia&quot;).

After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, and with the amalgamation of Ukrainian territories into one administrative unit (the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic), the term started to recede from common use. Today, the term is anachronistic, and many Ukrainians regard its usage as offensive.

== Etymology==
The toponym is adapted from the Greek term, which was used in medieval times by the patriarchs of Constantinople from the beginning of the 14th century. The Byzantines accepted the distinction between (, ), meaning the northern or outer region, and (, ), meaning the southern or inner region. From 1448, the former became ecclesiastically independent as the Russian Orthodox Church based in Moscow declared autocephaly, and from 1458, the latter had its own metropolitans who were approved by the patriarch of Constantinople. Previously, the jurisdiction of the latter had become the metropolis of Halych in 1303. By the early 15th century, the terms disappeared and &quot;Great Russia&quot; would not re-appear in sources until during the 16th century, while &quot;Little Russia&quot; would not re-appear until the end of that century.

Initially &quot;Little&quot; or &quot;Lesser&quot; meant the nearer part, as after the division of the metropolis (ecclesiastical province) in 1305, a new southwestern metropolis in the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia consisted of only 6 of the 19 former eparchies. It later lost its ecclesiastical associations and became a geographical name only. Zygmunt Gloger, in his &quot;Geography of Historic Lands of Old Poland&quot; (), describes an alternative view of the term &quot;Little&quot; in relation to Little Russia, where he compares it to the similar term &quot;Little Poland&quot;.

In Russian, the notion of &quot;Rossiia&quot;, which was used as the common designation for the multinational Russian Empire and for the modern Russian state, is closely related to the older terms &quot;Rus&quot; and &quot;russkii&quot;. &quot;Rossiia&quot; is distinguished from the ethnonym &quot;russkii&quot;, as &quot;Rossiia&quot; refers to a supranational identity, among them ethnic Russians. During the imperial era, &quot;Rossiia&quot; referred to a multinational state, while the ethnic term &quot;russkii&quot; officially included all East Slavs, namely the Great Russians, Little Russians and White Russians. In this sense, the Ukrainians, who were known as Little Russians, were part of an all-Russian identity. The rise of modern Russian nationalism created the concept of an ethnic Russian nation with the political concept of the Russian Empire, which was aimed at a new project of an ethnically homogeneous nation-state.

==Historical usage==

The term was used by Patriarch Callistus I of Constantinople in 1361, when he created two metropolitan sees: &quot;Megalē Rosiia&quot; () and &quot;Mikrà Rosiia&quot; (). The former referred to the province of Moscow and Vladimir, while the latter referred to the province of Halych and Kiev. King Casimir III of Poland was called &quot;the king of Lechia and Little Rus&quot;. Yuri II Boleslav used the term in a 1335 letter to Dietrich von Altenburg, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, where he styled himself as &quot;dux totius Rusiæ Minoris&quot;. According to Mykhaylo Hrushevsky, the term was associated with the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, and after its downfall, the name ceased to be used.

At the beginning of the 17th century, Ukrainian churchmen studying Greek sources took up the term &quot;Malorossiia&quot; and introduced it into the title of the metropolitan of Kiev, who was elected in 1620. At the time, the term &quot;Little Russia&quot; referred to the East Slavic lands in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, whose inhabitants were also known as Ruthenians or &quot;rusyny&quot;. The term &quot;Great Russia&quot; also began to be used by the Ukrainian churchmen in the 1640s when contact with Moscow increased and it was subsequently adopted in Russia. In 1654, both &quot;Little Russia&quot; and &quot;Great Russia&quot; appeared in the title of the Muscovite tsar for the first time. This was preceded by the Cossack Hetmanate falling under Russian protection. From this point on, the Russian government used the term &quot;Little Russia&quot; to express the idea that left-bank Ukraine and later other regions of Ukraine belonged to Russia.

The term has been used in letters of Cossack hetmans, particularly Bohdan Khmelnytsky, as well as Ivan Sirko. Innokentiy Gizel, the archimandrite of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, wrote that the Russian people were a union of three branches—Great Russia, Little Russia, and White Russia—under the sole legal authority of the Muscovite tsars. The term &quot;Little Russia&quot; has also been used in Ukrainian chronicles written by Samiilo Velychko, as well as in a chronicle of the hieromonk Leontiy (Bobolinski), and in &quot;Thesaurus&quot; by the archimandrite Ioannikiy (Golyatovsky).

From 1762, &quot;Little Russia&quot; represented the Cossack Hetmanate in left-bank Ukraine, or more precisely, its elites, who had aimed to acquire equal rights with &quot;Great Russia&quot; in the framework of the Russian Empire. At the time, &quot;Great Russia&quot; referred to the area of Russia inhabited by ethnic Russians. The usage of the name was later broadened to apply loosely to the parts of right-bank Ukraine when it was annexed by Russia at the end of the 18th century upon the partitions of Poland. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Russian Imperial administrative units known as the Little Russian Governorate and eponymous General Governorship were formed and existed for several decades before being split and renamed in subsequent administrative reforms.

Up to the very end of the 19th century, &quot;Little Russia&quot; was the prevailing term for much of the modern territory of Ukraine that was part of the Russian Empire, as well as for its people and their language. This can be seen from its usage in numerous scholarly, literary and artistic works. Ukrainophile historians Mykhaylo Maksymovych, Mykola Kostomarov, Dmytro Bahaliy, and Volodymyr Antonovych acknowledged the fact that during the Russo-Polish wars, &quot;Ukraine&quot; had only a geographical meaning, referring to the borderlands of both states, but &quot;Little Russia&quot; was the ethnonym of Little (Southern) Russian people. In his work &quot;Two Russian Nationalities&quot;, Kostomarov uses &quot;Southern Rus&quot; and &quot;Little Russia&quot; interchangeably. Mykhailo Drahomanov titled his first fundamental historic work &quot;Little Russia in Its literature&quot; (1867–1870).

The Little Russians (Ukrainians) were widely regarded by educated Russians at the start of the 20th century as an integral part of the Russian nation. Assimilation to Russian language and culture among Ukrainian elites was common from the 18th century, but after the 1863 January Uprising in Poland, the Russification of Ukrainians became an explicit goal of the Russian government. The Russophiles of Galicia in the Austrian Empire also advocated for merging into the Russian nation. The Galician Russophiles were the most important branch of the Ruthenian national movement for decades. As a result, if Russification had
been successful, Ukrainian nation building could have ended or at least have been interrupted.

The name &quot;Ukraine&quot; was reintroduced in the 19th century by several writers making a conscious effort to awaken Ukrainian national awareness. At the same time, &quot;Little Russia&quot; began to acquire its pejorative meaning as the inferior part of Russia. The name &quot;Malorossy&quot; (&quot;Little Russians&quot;) was later used by nationally conscious Ukrainians as a negative term for those who were loyal to the Russian Empire and had integrated themselves into Russian culture and language. By the early 20th century, the terms &quot;Ukraine&quot; and &quot;Ukrainians&quot; had become the common self-designation, while &quot;Ukraine&quot; has been used as an official name since 1917, at first for the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. After World War II, the term &quot;Ukraine&quot; included Ruthenians in Western Ukraine and all Ukrainian-speaking territories were united into one polity for the first time.

==Modern usage==
The term &quot;Little Russia&quot; is now anachronistic when used to refer to the country Ukraine and the modern Ukrainian nation, its language, culture, etc. Such usage is typically perceived as conveying an imperialist view that the Ukrainian territory and people (&quot;Little Russians&quot;) belong to &quot;one, indivisible Russia&quot;. Today, many Ukrainians consider the term disparaging, indicative of Russian suppression of Ukrainian identity and language.

It has continued to be used in Russian nationalist discourse, in which modern Ukrainians are presented as a single people in a united Russian nation. This has provoked new hostility toward and disapproval of the term by many Ukrainians. In July 2021 Vladimir Putin published a 7000-word essay, a large part of which was devoted to expounding these views.

==&quot;Little Russianness&quot;==

The concept of &quot;Little Russianness&quot; () is defined by some Ukrainian authors as a provincial complex they see in parts of the Ukrainian community due to its lengthy existence within the Russian Empire. They describe it as an &quot;indifferent, and sometimes a negative stance towards Ukrainian national-statehood traditions and aspirations, and often as active support of Russian culture and of Russian imperial policies&quot;. Mykhailo Drahomanov, who used the terms &quot;Little Russia&quot; and &quot;Little Russian&quot; in his historical works, applied the term &quot;Little Russianness&quot; to Russified Ukrainians, whose national character was formed under &quot;alien pressure and influence&quot; and who consequently adopted the &quot;worse qualities of other nationalities and lost the better ones of their own&quot;. Ukrainian conservative ideologue and politician Vyacheslav Lypynsky defined the term as &quot;the malaise of statelessness&quot;. The same inferiority complex has been said to apply to the Ukrainians of Galicia with respect to Poland (&quot;gente ruthenus, natione polonus&quot;). The related term &quot;Madiarony&quot; has been used to describe Magyarized Rusyns in Carpathian Ruthenia who advocated for the union of that region with Hungary.

The term &quot;Little Russians&quot; has also been used to denote stereotypically uneducated, rustic Ukrainians exhibiting little or no self-esteem. The uncouth stage persona of popular Ukrainian singer and performer Andriy Mykhailovych Danylko is an embodiment of this stereotype; his Surzhyk-speaking drag persona Verka Serduchka has also been seen as perpetuating this demeaning image. Danylko himself usually laughs off such criticism of his work, and many art critics argue that his success with the Ukrainian public is rooted in the unquestionable authenticity of his presentation.

== In popular culture ==
Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No 2 in C minor, Op 17, is nicknamed the &quot;Little Russian&quot; from its use of Ukrainian folk tunes. According to historian Harlow Robinson, Nikolay Kashkin, a friend of the composer as well as a well-known musical critic in Moscow, &quot;suggested the moniker in his 1896 book &quot;Memories of Tchaikovsky&quot;.&quot;

<text>Great Russia, sometimes Great Rus&#x27; (, ; , ; , ), is a name formerly applied to the territories of &quot;Russia proper&quot;, the land that formed the core of the Grand Duchy of Moscow and later the Tsardom of Russia. This was the land to which the ethnic Russians were native and where the ethnogenesis of (Great) Russians took place. The name is said to have come from the Greek or ().

From 1654 to 1721, Russian Tsars adopted the word – their official title included the wording (literal translation): &quot;The Sovereign of all Rus&#x27;: the Great, the Little, and the White&quot;.

The term is mentioned in the opening lines of the State Anthem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: &quot;Unbreakable Union of freeborn Republics Great Russia has welded forever to stand!&quot; (or lit. &quot;An unbreakable union of free republics, Great Russia has sealed forever&quot;).

Similarly, the terms Great Russian language (, ) and Great Russians (, ) were employed by ethnographers and linguists in the 19th century, but have since fallen out of use.

The area became, together with the Volga-Ural region, North Caucasus and Siberia, the Russian SFSR, while Little Russia and White Russia became the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR respectively.

<text>The Forest Recreation Ground is an open space and recreation ground in Nottingham, England, approximately one mile north of the city centre. This urban space is bounded by the neighbourhoods of Forest Fields to the north, Mapperley Park to the east, Arboretum to the south and Hyson Green to the west. It is best known as the site of the city&#x27;s famous annual Goose Fair.

==History==

The name &quot;Forest&quot; derives comes from the Middle Ages when the land that is now a recreation ground was part of the Sherwood Forest that once extended from the city of Nottingham to the north of Nottinghamshire. The site was the southernmost part of Sherwood Forest and was part of the open area known formerly as &quot;The Lings&quot; which, largely covered by gorse and scrub, extended into the parishes of Lenton, Radford and Basford.

The site of the Forest was one of the original areas to be protected in perpetuity by the St. Mary&#x27;s Nottingham Inclosure Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. &quot;7&quot; ), which set aside some of Sherwood Forest for public recreational use. In commemoration, the Mayor of Nottingham planted the &quot;Inclosure Oak&quot; which can still be seen at the Mansfield Road entrance to the Forest. Joseph Paxton, a leading gardener and architect of the nineteenth century, was responsible for the criss-cross formation of walkways.

For over 300 years the Forest has been home to sport, including horse racing, cricket and football. It was home to Nottingham Racecourse by 1773, and it remained there until it moved to its current location at Colwick, south east of Nottingham, at the end of the 19th century. Nottingham Forest Football Club first played their games on the Forest after their formation in 1865, hence the club&#x27;s name.

Standing at the Mansfield Road entrance is Forest Lodge, built in 1857. This Grade II listed building was originally used as a Police or Keeper&#x27;s Lodge and a police cell can still be seen at basement level. A red granite monument stands at the Monument Gate on Forest Road East, commemorating the fallen of the Boer War.

By comparison with its sporting heritage, the use of the Forest for the city&#x27;s traditional Goose Fair is relatively recent. The fair has existed since at least 1541, but it only moved to the Forest in 1928, from its previous long term home in the city&#x27;s Old Market Square.

==Cultural events==

The city&#x27;s Goose Fair is held on the Forest in October of every year. Other smaller travelling fairs and circuses take place on the recreation ground throughout the year, usually coinciding with local school holidays.

==Sports and recreation==
The Forest Recreation Ground boasts floodlit hard surface courts and grass pitches for ball games, and a traditional bowling lawn. There is also an enclosed children&#x27;s playground. These facilities are maintained by Nottingham City Council.

===Parkrun===
A parkrun is run at the grounds each week.

==Flora and fauna==

The Forest Recreation Ground supports many important habitats and species. Mature trees include turkey oak, English elm, pedunculate oak, sessile oak, rowan, silver birch, common lime and horse-chestnut. Additionally, there have been more recent plantings of London plane, beech, various maples and silver lime. Perennials include autumn crocus, spring crocus, bluebell, ramsons, primrose, wild privet, hazel and guelder rose.

Certain parts of the Forest play host to relic meadow flora such as meadow foxtail, short-stemmed meadow-grass, Yorkshire fog, red clover, white clover, oxeye daisy, germander speedwell and meadow saxifrage.

With such an abundance of habitat, the Forest attracts many birds such as nuthatches, treecreepers, mistle thrushes, tawny owls, song thrushes, great spotted woodpeckers and chaffinches.

The caves of the Rock Cemetery are a Geological County Wildlife Site. The thin turf here supports early and silver hairgrass, harebells, bird&#x27;s-foot trefoil and spiked sedge. Conspicuous insects include the holly blue, hornets and cockchafer beetles.

==Public transport==
The Forest is home to a park-and-ride site, with spaces for more than 950 cars. Nottingham Express Transit&#x27;s Forest tram stop is adjacent to the car park, and provides frequent services to and from the city centre and other city locations.

==Restoration of the Forest==
As with much urban parkland, the Forest has been threatened by development. Proposals for a recreation centre, to be built on the eastern fringes of the Forest, were rejected following public opposition to loss of green space. However, mature trees and greenery at the northwest corner of the ground have been cut down to provide 989 parking spaces for the Park &amp; Ride that serves the &quot;Forest&quot; stop for Nottingham Express Transit.

As at summer 2008, the Forest was the subject of a public consultation to decide on regeneration priorities, to be funded by an expected Heritage Lottery Fund award. For the last four years, Nottingham City Council and Nottingham&#x27;s Partnership Council have worked on plans to restore the parkland to its former glory and to better serve the needs of today&#x27;s park users. The project is also backed by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) and by local organisations such as Friends of the Forest.

The Forest&#x27;s £5.2 million restoration project was completed during September 2013. The project encompassed: the restoration and refurbishment of the lodge (now office space) and the pavilion (which now houses a new café, public toilets and office space); the reparation and improvement of footpaths; replacement of park benches, improvements to access to sporting facilities; the amelioration of lighting and security; the expansion of planting areas; and the creation of higher-quality activity areas for young people. Additionally, railings were erected, for example the new green-coloured metal fences next to the bus stop near the Forest&#x27;s Mansfield Road entrance, as well as the custom panelled columns. In design, these railings are very similar to the historic ones nearby.

The final phase of the Forest project created a sports zone with new sports pitches and changing rooms, paid for by the Premier League, the Football Association and Sport England. Work started on the sports zone in November 2014 and completed on 28 October 2015 with an opening event and the unveiling of a plaque in memory of local community activist Jim Taylor who was a driving force behind the project.

==Friends of the Forest==
‘Friends of the Forest’ is a not-for-profit organisation, funded by donations and public subscription. It supports efforts to maintain the Forest as an accessible, open, green space which has historic importance for the City of Nottingham. Friends of the Forest has worked with Nottingham City Council to prioritise refurbishment and replanting, and to organise voluntary activities that benefit the Forest and increase local awareness of green issues.

<text>William Richard (Rich) Stevens (February 5, 1951September 1, 1999) was a Northern Rhodesia–born American author of computer science books, in particular books on Unix and TCP/IP.

==Biography==
Richard Stevens was born in 1951 in Luanshya, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where his father worked for the copper industry. The family later moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, Hurley, New Mexico, Washington, D.C., and Phalaborwa, South Africa. Stevens attended Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Virginia. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan in 1973 and both a master&#x27;s degree (in 1978) and PhD (in 1982) in systems engineering from the University of Arizona. He moved to Tucson in 1975 where he was employed at Kitt Peak National Observatory as a computer programmer until 1982. From 1982 until 1990 he was Vice President of Computing Services at Health Systems International in New Haven, Connecticut. Stevens moved back to Tucson in 1990 where he pursued his career as an author and consultant. He was also an avid pilot and a part-time flight instructor during the 1970s.

Stevens died in 1999, at the age of 48. In 2000, he was posthumously awarded the USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award.

==RFCs==
Stevens also co-authored several Request for Comments (RFC) documents for the Internet Engineering Task Force, the process by which the Internet&#x27;s &quot;technical and organizational notes&quot; are disseminated. Stevens&#x27; RFCs covered updates to the Berkeley sockets API for IPv6, as well as a standard method of congestion control for TCP sessions.

<text>A urokotori is a utensil used in Japanese cuisine to remove the scales from the skin of fish before cooking. Although it is possible to remove the scales with a knife, this is more difficult and there is a higher risk of cutting the skin of the fish, especially with small fishes; knife-scaling also risks cutting one&#x27;s hand. 

The urokotori is pulled across the skin of the fish from the tail to the head repeatedly to remove the scales.

<text>Cavite City, officially the City of Cavite ( and ) is a component city in the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 100,674 people.

The city was the capital of Cavite Province from its establishment in 1614 until the title was transferred to the newly created, more accessible city of Trece Martires in 1954. Cavite City was originally a small port town, Cavite Puerto, that prospered during the early Spanish colonial period, when it served as the main seaport of Manila. Cavite Puerto hosted the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade, along with other large sea-bound ships. Thereafter, San Roque and La Caridad, two formerly independent towns in Cavite province, were annexed by the city. Today, Cavite City includes the communities of San Antonio (Cañacao and Sangley Point), the southern districts of Santa Cruz and Dalahican, and the outlying islands of the province, such as the historic Corregidor Island.

==Etymology==
The city has been known by at least two Tagalog names. The first, &quot;Tangway&quot;, was the name given to the area by Tagalog settlers. &quot;Tangway&quot; means &quot;peninsula.&quot; The second is &quot;Kawit&quot; or &quot;hook,&quot; referring to the hook-shaped landform along the coast of Bacoor Bay, and from which the Chinese &quot;Keit&quot; and Spanish &quot;Cavite&quot; are derived.

==History==
===Early history===
The early inhabitants of Cavite City were the Tagalogs ruled by the Kampilan and the bullhorn of a datu, the tribal form of government. According to folklore, the earliest settlers came from Borneo, led by Gat Hinigiw and his wife Dayang Kaliwanag, who bore seven children. Archaeological evidence in the coastal areas shows prehistoric settlements.

===Spanish colonial era===

On May 16, 1571, the Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi declared the region a royal &quot;encomienda&quot;, or royal land grant. Spanish colonizers settled in the most populated area (present-day Kawit) and called it Cavite. The old &quot;Tangway&quot; at the tip of the Cavite Peninsula, across Bacoor Bay, was referred to as &quot;Cavite la Punta&quot;, meaning &quot;Point of Cavite&quot; or Cavite Point. Upon discovering that, because of its deep waters, Cavite la Punta was a suitable place for the repair and construction of Spanish galleons, the Spanish moved their settlement there and called it &quot;Cavite Nuevo&quot; (New Cavite) or just &quot;Cavite&quot;. The first settlement was renamed &quot;Cavite Viejo&quot; (and in the early 20th century, regained its former name, Kawit). In 1582, the Spanish founded Cavite City with 65 Spanish households.

In 1590, the Spaniards fortified Cavite Nuevo/Cavite City with &quot;murallas&quot; (high thick curtain walls) on its western, northern, and eastern sides, while Bacoor Bay remained open to the south. Fort Guadalupe was built at the same time on the eastern tip, and the town became the &quot;Puerto de Cavite&quot; (Port of Cavite) or &quot;Cavite Puerto&quot;. The Fort of San Felipe Neri and the Porta Vaga Gate began construction in 1595 and were completed in 1602. Puerta Vaga (corrupted to Porta Vaga) was the port city&#x27;s barbican, the only principal entrance from San Roque in the west. It was flanked by the western wall, protected by two bastions at its northern and southern ends. The wall and gate were also separated from the mainland by a moat, which made the town like an island.

Cavite was legally founded in 1614 with Tomás Salazar as the earliest known &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; recorded. At the same time, the town became the capital of the new politico-military province of Cavite, established also in 1614. Like some other provinces during the Spanish era, the province adopted the name of its capital town – e.g., Bulacan, Bulacan province; Tayabas, Tayabas (today, Quezon province); Tarlac, Tarlac province; and Manila, Manila province.

San Roque was founded as a separate town in 1614. In 1663, during the Spanish evacuation of Ternate, Indonesia, the 200 families of mixed Mexican-Filipino-Spanish and Papuan-Indonesian-Portuguese descent who had ruled over the Christianized Sultanate of Ternate, including their Christian-convert Sultan, were relocated to the cities of Ternate (Cavite) province), Ermita, Manila, and San Roque (Cavite province).

In subsequent years, Latin-American soldiers from Mexico were deployed at Cavite: 70 soldiers in 1636; 89 in 1654; 225 in 1670; and 211 in 1672.

San Roque was later placed under the civil administration of Cavite until it was granted the right to be a separate and independent municipality in 1720. La Caridad, formerly known as La Estanzuela of San Roque, separated and was legally founded as a town in 1868. The Spanish Governor General Jose de la Gardana granted the petition of the people led by Don Justo Miranda to make Barrio La Estanzuela an independent town.

By the end of the 1700s, Cavite was the main port of Manila and was a province of 5,724 native families and 859 Spanish Filipino families.

====City of Churches====
As the town grew, it developed a cosmopolitan reputation, and attracted various religious orders to set up churches, convents, and hospitals within the confines of the fortified city center. The Franciscan &quot;Hospital de San Jose&quot; (Saint Joseph Hospital) was built for sailors and soldiers in 1591. The San Diego de Alcala Convent was built in 1608, followed by the Convents of Porta Vaga (La Ermita), Our Lady of Loreto (Jesuit), San Juan de Dios (St. John of God), Santo Domingo (Dominicans), Santa Monica (Recollects), and San Pedro, the port&#x27;s parish church. The fortified town enclosed eight churches, the Jesuit college of San Ildefonso, public buildings and residences, all meant to serve the needs of its population of natives, soldiers and workers at the port, transients, and passengers aboard galleons.

During this period, the city was called &quot;Tierra de Maria Santisima&quot; (Land of Most Holy Mary) because of the popularity of the Marian devotion. Plazas and parks abounded: Plaza de Armas (across from San Felipe Fort), Plaza de San Pedro (across from the church), Plaza Soledad (across from Porta Vaga), and Plaza del Reparo (bayside).

====Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade====

The Port of Cavite &quot;(Puerto de Cavite)&quot; was linked to the history of world trade. Spanish galleons passed back and forth every July between Acapulco (Mexico) and Cavite. Galleons and other heavy ocean-going ships were not able to enter the Port of Manila along the Pasig River because of a sand bar that only allows light vessels to reach the river-port. For this reason, the Port of Cavite was regarded as the Port of Manila, the main seaport of the capital city.

At the height of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade, the Port of Cavite was the arrival and departure port of the Spanish galleons that brought many foreign travelers (mostly Spaniards and Latinos) to its shores. The Port of Cavite was fondly called &quot;Ciudad de Oro Macizo&quot; meaning the &quot;City of Solid Gold&quot;. The Chinese emperor once sent some of his men to the place they called &quot;Keit&quot; (Cavite) to search for gold. Marilola Perez, in her 2015 Thesis &quot;Cavite Chabacano Philippine Creole Spanish: Description and Typology&quot;, describes a large number of Mexicans settling in Cavite and spreading to Luzon, integrating into the local population and leading peasant revolts. Mexicans weren&#x27;t the only Latin Americans in Cavite, as there were also a fair number of other Latin Americans. One of these was the Puerto Rican Alonso Ramirez, who became a sailor in Cavite, and published an influential early Latin American novel entitled &quot;Infortunios de Alonso Ramirez&quot;

Between 1609 and 1616 the galleons &quot;Espiritu Santo&quot; and &quot;San Miguel&quot; were constructed in the shipyard of the port, called the &quot;Astillero de Rivera&quot; (Rivera Shipyard of Cavite), sometimes spelled as &quot;Ribera&quot;.

====San Roque Isthmus====

The narrow San Roque isthmus or causeway (now M. Valentino Street) connected Cavite Puerto to San Roque, its only border town. Maps from the 17th century show that this narrow isthmus was once as wide as the town itself. Problems with rising water and the encroaching waves that plagued Cavite Puerto likely eroded the land into a narrow isthmus.

===American Invasion Era===

Spain turned the port over to the Americans after the Treaty of Paris of 1898. At the start of the American era, Cavite Puerto became the seat of the U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines. It was redesigned to make way for modern ships and armaments. The historical structures, like Fort Guadalupe, were demolished, along with most of Fort San Felipe.

Local government administration was reorganized under the &quot;Presidentes municipales&quot; with the direct supervision of American army officers (the first being Colonel Meade). The first Filipino &quot;Presidentes municipales&quot; were appointed: Don Zacaria Fortich for Cavite Puerto, Don Francisco Basa for San Roque, and Don Pedro Raqueño Bautista for Caridad.

In 1900, the Caviteños held their first election under the American regime. Each pueblo or town elected local officials&quot;: Presidente municipal&quot;, &quot;Vice-Presidente municipal&quot; and a &quot;Consejo&quot; (council) composed of &quot;Consejales&quot; (councilors). Don Gregorio Basa was elected as the &quot;Presidente Municipal&quot; of present-day Cavite City.

In 1901, the Philippine Commission approved a municipal code as the organic law of all local governments throughout the country. In its implementation in 1903, the three separate pueblos of Cavite Puerto, San Roque, and La Caridad were merged into one municipality, which was called the Municipality of Cavite. By virtue of a legislative act promulgated by the First Philippine Assembly, Cavite was again made the capital of the province. Subsequently, its territory was enlarged to include the district of San Antonio and the island of Corregidor. The Municipality of Cavite functioned as a civil government whose officials consisted of a Presidente Municipal, a Vice-Presidente Municipal and ten Consejales duly elected by the qualified voters of the municipality.

In 1909, Executive Order No. 124, of Governor-General W. Cameron Forbes, declared the Act No. 1748 annexing Corregidor and the islands of Caballo (Fort Hughes), La Monja, El Fraile (Fort Drum), Santa Amalia, Carabao (Fort Frank) and Limbones, as well as all waters and detached rocks surrounding them, to the Municipality of Cavite.

====Cityhood====

Under the Philippine Commonwealth, Assemblyman Manuel S. Roxas sponsored Commonwealth Act No. 547, elevating Cavite&#x27;s status to a chartered city. On September 7, 1940, the executive function of the city was vested in a City Mayor appointed by the President of the Philippine Commonwealth. The legislative body of the City of Cavite was vested on a Municipal Board composed of three electives, two appointives, and two ex-officio councilors, with the City Mayor as the presiding officer.

===Japanese occupation era===

On December 10, 1941, two days after an attack that had destroyed American air defenses at Clark Field and three days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese Imperial Forces destroyed Cavite Naval Base and bombed Cavite City.

Later, after Japan seized the Philippines, Japanese leaders appointed at least two City Mayors of Cavite City.

The island of Corregidor played an important role during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. The island was the site of two costly sieges and pitched battles—the first in early 1942, and the second in January, 1945—between the Imperial Japanese Army and the U.S. Army, along with its smaller subsidiary force, the Philippine Army.

In 1945, during the fight to liberate the country from Japan, the US and Philippine Commonwealth militaries bombarded the Japanese forces stationed in the city, completely destroying the old historic port of Cavite. The old walls and the Porta Vaga Gate were damaged. Most of the structures were destroyed, but some of the church towers remained. The city was littered with bomb craters.

After the war, the city&#x27;s local administration resumed operations. The walls, gates, and ruins of the old city were later removed. Only the bell tower of the Church of Santa Monica of the Augustinian Recollects and the two bastions of Fort San Felipe remain from the old city.

=== Post-war era ===
==== Third Republic (1946-1972) ====
Republic Act No. 981, passed by the Congress of the Philippines in 1954, transferred the capital of the province from Cavite City to the newly established Trece Martires. Subsequently, the city charter was amended. By virtue of an amendment to the charter of Cavite City, the City Mayor, City Vice Mayor and eight councilors were elected by popular vote. The first election of city officials in this way was held in 1963.

==== During the Marcos presidency and dictatorship (1965-1986) ====

The Philippines&#x27; gradual postwar recovery took a turn for the worse in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis being an early landmark event. Economic analysts generally attribute the crisis to the ramp-up on loan-funded government spending to promote Ferdinand Marcos’ 1969 reelection campaign. In September 1972, one year before the expected end of his last constitutionally allowed term as president, president Marcos placed the Philippines under martial law. This allowed Marcos to remain in power for fourteen more years, during which Cavite endured many social and economic obstacles.

On February 25, 1972, amidst a spate of assassinations against Cavite government officials, mayor and former congressman Manuel S. Rojas was assassinated just past noon by multiple gunmen in the barrio of Panapaan within the town of Bacoor, Cavite while on the road with his driver, a policeman, to Manila; both mayor Rojas and the driver were unarmed.

The excesses of the Marcos Family prompted opposition from various Filipino citizens despite the risks of arrest and torture Victims of human rights abuses during this period included Cavite City resident and University of the Philippines student leader Emmanuel Alvarez. Alvarez, a descendant of Katipunan General Pascual Alvarez, became one of the &quot;desaparecidos&quot; of Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos when he was accosted by two men believed to be military personnel while commuting from his home in Cavite City on January 6, 1976, and never seen again. He has formally been honored as a hero of Philippine democracy, having had his name etched on the wall of remembrance of the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani.

During the 1986 snap elections, Marcos won against Corazon Aquino in Region IV (which then included the provinces of MIMAROPA) according to the official COMELEC results, but this was disputed by NAMFREL. An exit poll conducted by American election observers found that voters from Cavite City preferred Aquino over Marcos.

==== Land reclamation ====

In the latter part of the 1960s and early 1970s, the land adjacent to the San Roque isthmus was reclaimed. The new land is now occupied by the San Sebastian College – Recoletos de Cavite and some residential homes. The present Cavite City Hall is built where the north tower of the old western wall once stood, which was already partly reclaimed by 1945.

Half of the old port city, including Fort San Felipe, is now occupied by Naval Base Cavite and is closed to the public. The old historic core of Cavite is now part of the San Roque district, and is referred to today as either Fort San Felipe or Porta Vaga. The former location of the Porta Vaga Gate, the western wall, and its towers is now occupied by the Governor Samonte Park.

=== Contemporary era ===
A portion of Danila Atienza Air Base was converted into a domestic airport in 2020 called Sangley Point Airport. The airport is planned to be converted into an international airport under the national government&#x27;s Public-Private Partnership (PPP) program. The original proponent status (OPS) contract was initially awarded to a consortium between MacroAsia Corporation and China Communications Construction Company Ltd., until it was dropped by the provincial government in 2021. After another round of bidding, the contract was awarded to the Yuchengco-led Sangley Point International Airport Consortium in 2022.

==Geography==

Cavite City occupies most of the hook-shaped Cavite Peninsula that juts into Manila Bay. The peninsula is lined by Bacoor Bay to the southeast. The peninsula ends in two tips – Sangley Point and Cavite Point. Cañacao Bay is the body of water formed between the points. Cavite Point was the location of the old historic Port of Cavite. Both Bacoor and Cañacao Bays are inland bays within the larger Manila Bay. The city&#x27;s only land border is with the Municipality of Noveleta to the south.

The city is the northernmost settlement in the Province of Cavite, which lies southwest from Manila with a direct distance of about but about overland/by road. Sangley Point, the former location of the United States Sangley Point Naval Base, is the northernmost point of the city, peninsula and province. The former American military naval base has since been converted into a Philippine military base.

The historic island of Corregidor, the adjacent islands and detached rocks of Caballo, Carabao, El Fraile and La Monja found at the mouth of Manila Bay are part of the city&#x27;s territorial jurisdiction.

===Climate===
Cavite City has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification Aw), with a pronounced dry season from December to April, and a lengthy wet season from May to November that brings abundant rainfall into the city.

===Religion===

According to 2000 census data, Christianity is the most prevalent religion in Cavite City, and a majority of Caviteños practice Roman Catholicism. Other Christian religious groups in the city include the Aglipayan Church, Iglesia ni Cristo (I.N.C), Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP), Jesus Is Lord Church (JIL), The United Methodist Church, Presbyterian Churches, Baptists and Bible Fundamental churches, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Members Church of God International or Ang Dating Daan, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and other UPC churches. A Muslim minority is also present in the city.

==== Nuestra Señora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga ====
The Nuestra Señora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga (Our Lady of Solitude of Porta Vaga) is viewed as the patroness of Cavite City. She is revered by Catholics as the Celestial Guardian and Protector of the Province of Cavite since her arrival. The image of Our Lady of Porta Vaga is designated as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum. It is the oldest existing Marian painting in the Philippines.
The image of the virgin is painted on a canvas. Mary, clothed in black and white like a lady in mourning, kneels as she contemplates the passion of her son. Before her are the crown of thorns and the nails used during the Crucifixion. An inscription was found on the back of the painting – &quot;A doze de Abril 1692 años Juan Oliba puso esta Stma. Ymagen Haqui&quot;, which means, &quot;The sacred image was placed here by Juan Oliba on April 12, 1692&quot;. This particular icon was used to bless the galleons sailing between Cavite and Acapulco (Mexico) during formal sending off ceremonies, and was also called the Patroness of the Galleons.

The image was originally enshrined at the &quot;Ermita de Porta Vaga&quot;, a small church adjacent to the Porta Vaga Gate, which was destroyed during World War II. The image is presently enshrined at the San Roque Parish Church, one of the three parishes in the city.

===Languages===
Chabacano is a Spanish-influenced creole language formerly spoken by majority of the people living in the city. Chabacano emerged sometime after the arrival of the first Spaniards and Mexicans in the late 16th century. During this period, the people that lived near the military arsenal in Cavite City communicated with Spaniards and Mexicans and began to incorporate Spanish words into their dialect. Today, a majority of residents speak Tagalog.

Today, Chabacano is generally considered to be dying, with only a fraction of people, mostly elderly, able to speak the language. According to the Philippine professor Alfredo B. German, who wrote a thesis on the grammar of Chabacano, the present conditions do not encourage people to learn the dialect. There are many likely reasons for the diminishing of Chabacano, such as the influx of Tagalog-speaking migrants and intermarriage.

Philippine writer and poet Jesus Balmori expressed himself in Chabacano, and wrote several verses in it. Don Jaime de Veyra, writer and famous Philippine historian, wrote the following lines: &quot;I am afraid that the inevitable absorption of the &#x27;Tagalog invasion&#x27; on one side and the &#x27;invasion of the English&#x27; on the other hand, will wipe out or extinguish this inherited Castilian language in existence with its last representatives in the following generation.&quot; Professor Gervacio Miranda, who also wrote a book in Chabacano, said in his preface: &quot;My only objective to write this book is to possibly conserve in written form the Chabacano of Cavite for posterity,&quot; fearing the extinction of the dialect.

=== Festivals and events ===

The city is home to the Annual Cavite City Water Festival or Regada, held from the 17th to the 24th of June. It is a festive and religious celebration of the feast of St. John the Baptist. Regada started in 1996, and features the &quot;Paulan&quot; or &quot;Basayawan&quot;, which is a street party where celebrators dance under water sprinklers. Another celebration is the Feast for Our Lady of Solitude of Porta Vaga, which is annually observed by local Catholics during every second Sunday of November.

Other notable holidays include the observance of Julián Felipe&#x27;s birthday (January 28). Felipe, who composed the Philippine National Anthem, was born and raised in Cavite City. The city&#x27;s Charter Day, known locally as simply Cavite City Day, which commemorates the signing of the city charter in 1940, is held every September 7.

=== Cuisine ===
Food in Cavite City is influenced by its Spanish heritage combined with Filipino tradition. One popular native dish is bacalao (sauteed codfish), which is served during the Lenten season. A variation of &quot;bibingka&quot; locally known as &quot;bibingkang samala&quot; can also be found in the city. This delicacy is made of glutinous rice (&quot;malagkit&quot;), coconut milk and sugar.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===
The only road connecting Cavite City to the rest of Luzon is the National Route 62, which begins at P. Burgos Avenue in Caridad district and continues towards Noveleta as the Manila–Cavite Road (not to be confused with Manila-Cavite Expressway). A proposal to construct an expressway from Kawit to Cavite City via Bacoor Bay has been raised to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). When realized, the expressway would serve as a link to Manila-Cavite Expressway (CAVITEx).

Cavite City has one airport, Danilo Atienza Air Base, located at Sangley Point. The airport is operated by the Philippine Air Force. It was formerly a US Naval Base, called Naval Station Sangley Point, until it was turned over to the Philippine government in 1971. There are proposals to convert the base into a civilian airport, as a solution to the overcrowding of Ninoy Aquino International Airport.

As of 2019, no active water-based public transportation services were based in Cavite City. Metrostar Ferry, which began operations in 2007, used to serve trips from San Roque district to Pasay, Metro Manila. A new service from the Intramuros district of Manila to the nearby town of Noveleta to the south debuted in January 2018 and is currently the nearest water-based transport to the city.

=== Utilities ===
Water services are currently provided by Maynilad. Electric services are currently provided by Meralco.

==Symbols==

===Flag===
The flag of the city was created by Mayor Timoteo O. Encarnacion Jr., and was adopted by the Sangguniang Panlungsod through Resolution No. 95-081 dated September 6, 1995, in time for the 55th Cavite City Charter Day. The meaning and significance of the flag components are:
* The two red strips symbolize courage and bravery.
* The middle green strip symbolizes progress and advancement
* The half sun has a twofold meaning. If it is the rising sun, it means hope, dreams, and visions for progress. If it is a setting sun, it stands for the sunset that can be seen from the city&#x27;s western shores.
* The five yellow stars symbolize the five districts of Cavite City.
* The three sets of waves below the half sun, in three colors of navy blue, light blue and white, signify that Cavite City is a peninsula surrounded by water, while the three colors represent Cañacao Bay, Bacoor Bay, and Manila Bay.

===Seal===
The current seal of the city was designed by Mayor Timoteo O. Encarnacion, Jr. It was adopted by the Sangguniang Panlungsod through Resolution No. 140-90, then approved by the Local Executive on September 7, 1990. On November 3, 1993, the National Historical Institute and the president, through the Department of the Interior and Local Government, issued a Certificate of Registration recognizing the new seal.

The shield stands for bravery and fortitude. The colors red, white, blue, yellow stand for the loyalty of the people to its government. The inclusion of the rays portrays the role of Cavite as one of the original provinces that rose up in arms against Spanish domination in 1896 in the Philippine Revolution.

The white triangle inscribed within the shield with the letters KKK at the corners represents the part played by The city in the organization of the Katipunan. Don Ladislao Diwa of the city was one of the triumvirate who organized the patriotic group. Many Katipuneros came from the city.

Within the white triangle are symbols representing various events:
* At the bottom of the triangle is a fort with figures &quot;1872&quot; symbolizing the Cavite mutiny of 1872 at the Cavite Arsenal.
* At the background is a map of the city including the island of Corregidor representing the role of the island in the city&#x27;s history.
* The obelisk at the left memorializes the Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite who were executed by the Spaniards on September 12, 1896.
* The sheet music at the right symbolizes Julián Felipe, composer of the Philippine National Anthem who was from the city.
* The fort symbol represents the Royal Fort of San Felipe and its role in the city and country&#x27;s history, being the place where the &quot;thirteen martyrs of Cavite&quot; were detained and where the Cavite mutiny of 1872 took place.
* The scroll on the uppermost portion of the triangle contains the City motto &quot;Para Dios y Patria&quot; (&quot;For God and Country&quot;) in the Chabacano dialect to emphasize the native dialect of the city.
* The green laurel leaf encircling the right and left portions of the KKK triangle symbolizes victories by reason.

<doc id="526001" wikidata="Q311709" url="?curid=526001" title="Les Ferdinand">
<text>Leslie Ferdinand (born 8 December 1966) is an English football coach, former professional footballer and television pundit.

A striker, his playing career included notable spells in the Premier League with Queens Park Rangers, Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United, Leicester City and Bolton Wanderers. He also played in Turkey with Beşiktaş and in the Football League with Brentford, Reading and Watford. Prior to becoming a professional player, Ferdinand had played non-league football with both Southall and Hayes. He earned 17 caps for England and was part of the Euro 96 and World Cup 98 squads. He is the eleventh-highest scorer in the history of the Premier League, with 149 goals and he contributed a further 49 assists in the division.

Since his retirement, Ferdinand has worked as a television pundit, but re-joined Tottenham Hotspur as strikers coach in 2008, remaining with Spurs until 2014. He then returned to QPR, first as head of football operations and subsequently as director of football. In 2015, he was named as caretaker manager for a short period.

==Early and personal life==
Ferdinand was born in Acton, Greater London. He is the second cousin of football-playing brothers Rio and Anton Ferdinand and a cousin of Maidenhead United player Kane Ferdinand.

His autobiography, &quot;Sir Les&quot;, was published in 1997.

Ferdinand was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2005 Birthday Honours.

In an interview with the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in February 2020, Ferdinand stated that fans racially abused him during his stints as a player and director of football.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Ferdinand started his career in non-league football, first at Viking Sports before moving to Southall. He made his league debut for Southall in August 1984 against Chertsey Town, and was part of the team which reached the FA Vase final in 1986, losing 3–0 to Halesowen Town. Following this, Ferdinand moved to Hayes, where he scored 20 goals in 42 appearances in all competitions (including friendlies). He was spotted by Queens Park Rangers and moved there for £50,000.

Ferdinand made his QPR debut on 20 April 1987, aged 20, as a substitute in the 4–1 league defeat by Coventry City at Highfield Road – the first of two league appearances that season. He played a further league game in 1987–88, and was loaned for three games to Third Division Brentford. In 1988, he was loaned to Turkish side Beşiktaş for a season, and performed well with 14 goals in 24 league games and he also got his first taste of silverware, helping the club to a 3–1 aggregate victory over Fenerbahçe S.K. in the Turkish Cup.

He returned to the QPR side for the 1989–90 season, and appeared in nine First Division matches as well as scoring his first two English league goals. He fared better in 1990–91, playing in 18 league games and scoring eight goals as QPR ended up in a mid-table position. His 10 goals from 23 games in 1991–92 helped ensure QPR&#x27;s status as founder members of the new FA Premier League for the 1992–93 season, and it was during this campaign that he established himself as a top striker, scoring 20 goals in 37 games as QPR finished fifth — the highest placed of all the London sides. In his autobiography, &quot;Sir Les&quot;, Ferdinand wrote of his pride at scoring a hat-trick in a 5–3 win against Everton at Goodison Park in April 1993, a place where he had previously received racist abuse:

Ferdinand&#x27;s fine form continued into 1993–94, during which his 16 goals from 36 games helped QPR finish ninth. Despite mounting speculation of a move to either Manchester United or Arsenal, he signed a two-year contract with QPR that summer. In 1994–95, he scored 24 times in the Premier League and speculation grew that he would soon be on his way to a bigger club. In nearly a decade at Loftus Road, he played under four different managers – Jim Smith, Trevor Francis, Don Howe and Gerry Francis.

===Newcastle United===
Ferdinand was sold to Newcastle in 1995 for £6 million, with Hayes receiving £600,000 due to a sell-on clause agreed following his move to QPR. With the money received, Hayes built a function suite and named it &quot;The Ferdinand Suite&quot; in his honour. His arrival at the club came nearly three years after the Magpies had offered QPR £3.3million for him during their Division One promotion season — but the offer had been turned down.

The spell on Tyneside was arguably Ferdinand&#x27;s most successful club tenure. He scored 29 goals in his first season with Newcastle, and significantly contributed to the side&#x27;s getting within touching distance of the Premiership title in the 1995–96 season. Newcastle led the league by 12 points at one stage, but were overhauled by Manchester United in the final three months of the season.

In both of his seasons on Tyneside, Ferdinand collected runners-up medals in the Premier League. In the second season, they contested a four-horse race with Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool before Manchester United won the title. Midway through the 1996–97 season, however, came a change, as manager Kevin Keegan surprisingly departed Newcastle and was replaced by Kenny Dalglish. Despite the Scot being regretful to lose such a talented striker, it quickly became apparent Ferdinand would be dispensed to free up funds for further signings. In an interview with Sky Sports in 2019, Ferdinand admitted that he regretted leaving Newcastle and had hoped at the time to stay on Tyneside for the rest of his career.

Ferdinand scored 50 goals in only 84 games at Newcastle, forming a successful strike partnership with Alan Shearer. He was very highly thought of by the Newcastle United supporters during his spell with the club and is known affectionately as &#x27;Sir Les&#x27; on Tyneside.

Ferdinand received a standing ovation when he returned to St James&#x27; Park as a Tottenham player, trying to put Shearer&#x27;s number 9 shirt on to complete a lap of honour, he broke down in tears and could only manage to put the shirt on inside out and back to front before being helped from the field. Ferdinand returned again, when he also received a standing ovation, coming on as a substitute at Alan Shearer&#x27;s testimonial and subsequently scored.

He was inducted into the Newcastle United Foundation Hall of Fame on 7 November 2017.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
In 1997 Ferdinand was bought by Tottenham Hotspur, the club he supported as a boy, for £6 million. Injuries heavily disrupted his first season at the club, but towards the end of the campaign he formed a good partnership with Jürgen Klinsmann, and the pair&#x27;s goals saved Spurs from relegation from the Premiership. Ferdinand helped Spurs win the League Cup in 1999, defeating Leicester City 1–0 in the final at Wembley, but injuries restricted him to just 12 goals in his first three seasons at the club.

He improved his goal-scoring return over the next two seasons, contributing 10 goals in the 2000–01 season and a further 15 during the 2001–02 campaign. Ferdinand scored the 10,000th goal in Premiership history on 15 December 2001 in a 4–0 win against Fulham. He played in a second League Cup final for the club against Blackburn Rovers in 2002, but was thwarted by three saves by Rovers&#x27; goalkeeper Brad Friedel as Spurs lost 2–1.

===Later career===
After struggling to find a place in Spurs&#x27; first team season following Glenn Hoddle&#x27;s purchase of Robbie Keane from Leeds, he moved to West Ham United on 21 January 2003 for an undisclosed fee. He scored his first goal for the club against former club Tottenham, but was unable to prevent the club&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League and opted to remain in the top flight by signing for newly promoted Leicester City on a free transfer. While at Leicester Ferdinand scored 14 Premiership goals, despite being 37 years old. After the Foxes were relegated at the end of that season, he rejected a new contract and joined Bolton Wanderers.

Ferdinand memorably scored for Bolton Wanderers against rivals Manchester United in the last minute, despite playing from a centre back position, which looked to have given the Wanderers the win, but a goal from David Bellion even deeper in injury time gave United a point.

He found opportunities from the start limited, but proved useful for all his experience when coming off the substitutes&#x27; bench, and scored against former club Tottenham in the League Cup, with what proved to be a mere consolation goal in a 4–3 thriller which Bolton lost. He left them on 2 January 2005. Four days later, he signed with Reading. His contract at the club lasted until the end of the 2004–05 season. He scored one league goal in his time at Reading, in a 2–1 loss to Coventry.

Ferdinand committed to non-contract terms with Watford during the 2005–06, but did not play a competitive game for the club and left after their promotion to the Premier League via the Football League Championship playoffs. He retired from football a few months short of his 40th birthday.

==International career==
Ferdinand made his England debut in February 1993 against San Marino, scoring the final goal in a 6–0 victory at Wembley. He was part of the Euro 96 and 1998 FIFA World Cup squads, although he did not feature in any of the tournament matches. He was capped 17 times, scoring five goals.

==Coaching career==
On 5 November 2008 Ferdinand joined fellow ex-Tottenham player Tim Sherwood on the coaching staff of Tottenham Hotspur, to work with the strikers. Ferdinand left the club on 19 June 2014. In October 2014, Ferdinand became head of football operations at Queens Park Rangers, before being appointed as director of football in February 2015.

On 16 June 2023, it was announced that Ferdinand had stepped down as director of football with the west London club, citing it was the right time to move on after eight years at the helm.

<doc id="526003" wikidata="Q501303" url="?curid=526003" title="Free City of Cracow">
<text>The Free, Independent, and Strictly Neutral City of Cracow with its Territory, more commonly known as the Free City of Cracow, and the Republic of Cracow, was a city republic created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, which included the Polish city of Cracow (Kraków) and its surrounding areas.

It was jointly controlled by its three neighbours (Russia, Prussia, and Austria), and was a centre of agitation for an independent Poland. In 1846, in the aftermath of the unsuccessful Kraków Uprising, the Free City of Cracow was annexed by the Austrian Empire. It was a remnant of the Duchy of Warsaw, which was partitioned among the three states after the Congress in 1815.

The Free City of Cracow was an overwhelmingly Polish-speaking city-state; of its population 85% were Catholics, 14% were Jews, while other religions comprised less than 1%. The city of Cracow itself would develop a Jewish population reaching nearly 40% in the years following the end of the Free City, while the rest were almost exclusively Polish-speaking Catholics.

==History==
The Free City was approved and guaranteed by of the of 3 May 1815. The statelet received an at the same time, revised and expanded in 1818, establishing significant autonomy for the city. The Jagiellonian University could accept students from the partitioned territory of Poland. The Free City thus became a centre of Polish political activity on the territories of partitioned Poland.

During the November Uprising of 1830–1831, Kraków was a base for the smuggling of weapons into the Russian-controlled Kingdom of Poland. After the end of the uprising the autonomy of the Free City was severely restricted. The police were controlled by Austria and the election of the president had to be approved by all three powers. Cracow was subsequently occupied by the Austrian army from 1836 to 1841. After the unsuccessful Kraków uprising of 1846, the Free City was annexed by Austria on 16 November 1846 as the Grand Duchy of Kraków.


==Geography, population, and economy==
The Free City of Cracow was created from the southwest part of the Duchy of Warsaw (part of the former Kraków Department on the left bank of the Vistula river). At its smallest, the city encompassed an area of 1,164 to 1,234 km2 (sources vary). It bordered the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire. It comprised the city of Kraków and its environs; the other settlements in the area administered by the Free City included 224 villages and three towns (Chrzanów, Trzebinia and Nowa Góra).

In 1815, its population was 95,000; as of 1843, it had a population of 146,000. 85% of them were Catholics, 14% Jews, while other religions comprised 1%. The most notable szlachta family was the Potocki family of magnates, who had a mansion in Krzeszowice.

The Free City was a duty-free area, allowed to trade with Russia, Prussia and Austria. In addition to no duties, it had very low taxes, and various economic privileges were granted by the neighbouring powers. As such, it became one of the European centres of economic liberalism and supporters of laissez-faire, attracting new enterprises and immigrants, which resulted in impressive growth of the city. Weavers from Prussian Silesia had often used the Free City as a contraband outlet to avoid tariff barriers along the borders of Austria and the Kingdom of Poland, but with Austria&#x27;s annexation of the Free City came a significant drop in Prussian textile exports.

==Politics==


The statelet received an initial constitution in 1815 which had mainly been devised by Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski. The constitution was revised and expanded in 1818, establishing significant autonomy for the city. Legislative power was vested in the Assembly of Representatives (&quot;Izba Reprezentantów&quot;), and the executive power was given to a Governing Senate.

In 1833, in the aftermath of the November Uprising and the foiled plan by some Polish activists to start an uprising in Cracow, the partitioning powers issued a new, much more restrictive constitution: the number of senators and deputies was lowered and their competences limited, while the commissars of the partitioning powers had their competences expanded. Freedom of the press was also curtailed. In 1835 a secret treaty between the three partitioning powers presented a plan in which in case of additional Polish unrest, Austria was given the right to occupy and annex the city. That would take place after the Kraków Uprising of 1846.

The law was based on the Napoleonic civil code and French commercial and criminal law. The official language was Polish. In 1836 the local police force was disbanded and replaced by Austrian police; in 1837 the partitioning powers curtailed the competences of the local courts which refused to bow down to their demands.

The Free City of Cracow was the first purely republican government in the history of Poland.

<text>An emirp (an anadrome of &quot;prime&quot;) is a prime number that results in a different prime when its decimal digits are reversed. This definition excludes the related palindromic primes. The term reversible prime is used to mean the same as emirp, but may also, ambiguously, include the palindromic primes.

The sequence of emirps begins 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97, 107, 113, 149, 157, 167, 179, 199, 311, 337, 347, 359, 389, 701, 709, 733, 739, 743, 751, 761, 769, 907, 937, 941, 953, 967, 971, 983, 991, ... .

The difference in all pairs of emirps is always a multiple of 18. This follows from all primes bigger than 2 being odd (making their differences even, i.e. multiples of 2) and from differences between pairs of natural numbers with reversed digits being multiples of 9 (which itself is a consequence of formula_1 being a multiple of 9 for every non-negative integer formula_2).

All non-palindromic permutable primes are emirps.

It is an open problem whether there are infinitely many emirps.

<text>Henry Seebohm (12 July 1832 – 26 November 1895) was an English steel manufacturer, and amateur ornithologist, oologist and traveller.

== Biography ==
Henry was the oldest son of Benjamin Seebohm (1798–1871) who was a wool merchant at Horton Grange, Bradford. The family had moved to England from Bad Pyrmont in Germany. Henry&#x27;s mother Estther Wheeler (1798–1864) was a granddaughter of William Tuke. The Seebohms were active in the Society of Friends and Henry schooled within the community in York. He worked initially in a grocery as an assistant but moved to Sheffield where he became a steel manufacturer. He married Maria, daughter of George John Healey, a merchant in Manchester on 19 January 1859.

== Natural history ==
Henry became interested in natural history at school and continued to spend his spare time studying birds on his journeys. He travelled widely visiting Greece, Scandinavia, Turkey, and South Africa. His expeditions to the Yenisey tundra of Siberia were described in his two books, &quot;Siberia in Europe&quot; (1880) and &quot;Siberia in Asia&quot; (1882), which were combined in the posthumous publication &quot;The Birds of Siberia&quot; (1901). His expeditions included the lower Pechora River in 1875 along with John Alexander Harvie-Brown as well as a visit to Heligoland at the home of Heinrich Gätke. In 1877 he joined Joseph Wiggins to Siberia.

He was one of the first European ornithologists to accept the American trinomial system to classify sub-species.

Seebohm&#x27;s other publications included &quot;A History of British Birds&quot; (1883), &quot;The Geographical Distribution of the family Charadriidae&quot; (1887), &quot;The Birds of the Japanese Empire&quot; (1890) and &quot;A Monograph of the Turdidae&quot; (1902, completed by Richard Bowdler Sharpe).

Seebohm bequeathed his collection of bird-skins to the British Museum. The collection which was received in 1896 consisted of nearly 17,000 specimens. A number of birds were named after Seebohm, including the grey emutail (&quot;Dromaeocercus seebohmi&quot;) by Bowdler Sharpe. A portrait of Seebohm in oil by Hugh Ford Crighton is held by Sheffield Museums.

<text>Gabriel Paul Othenin de Cléron, comte d&#x27;Haussonville (21 September 18431 September 1924) was a French politician and author.

==Biography==

Born at Gurcy-le-Châtel (Seine-et-Marne), de Cléron was the son of Joseph Othenin Bernard de Cléron, comte d&#x27;Haussonville and Louise &quot;née&quot; Louise Albertine, princesse de Broglie.

De Cléron represented Seine-et-Marne in the National Assembly (1871) and voted with the Right Centre. Though he was not elected to the chamber of deputies he became the righthand man of his maternal uncle Albert, 4th duc de Broglie, in the attempted &quot;coup&quot; of May 16. His &quot;Les établissements pénitentiaires en France et aux colonies&quot; (1875) was crowned by the Académie française, of which he was admitted a member on January 26, 1888.

In 1891 the resignation of Henri Edouard Bocher from the administration of the Orleans estates led to the appointment of d&#x27;Haussonville as accredited representative of the comte de Paris in France. He at once set to work to strengthen the Orleanist party by recruiting from the smaller nobility the officials of the local monarchical committees. He established new Orleanist organs, and sent out lecturers with instructions to emphasize the modern and democratic principles of the comte de Paris; hut the prospects of the party were dashed in 1894 by the death of the comte de Paris.

In 1904 he was admitted to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques.

==Family==

In 1865 d&#x27;Haussonville married Mlle Pauline d&#x27;Harcourt.

==Works==

The comte d&#x27;Haussonville published:
* &quot;Sainte-Beuve, sa vie et ses œuvres&quot; (1875)
* &quot;Études biographiques et littéraires, 2 vol.&quot; (1879 and 1888)

<doc id="526012" wikidata="Q3308606" url="?curid=526012" title="Warhol superstars">
<text>Warhol superstars were a clique of New York City personalities promoted by the pop artist Andy Warhol during the 1960s and early 1970s. These personalities appeared in Warhol&#x27;s artworks and accompanied him in his social life. Warhol would simply film them, and declare them &quot;superstars&quot;.

==History==

The first recognized superstar was Baby Jane Holzer, whom Warhol featured in many of his early film experiments. The superstars would help Warhol generate publicity while Warhol offered fame and attention in return. Warhol&#x27;s philosophies of art and celebrity met in a way that imitated the Hollywood studio system at its height in the 1930s and 1940s.

Among the best-known of Warhol&#x27;s superstars was Edie Sedgwick. She and Warhol became very close during 1965 but their relationship ended abruptly early in the next year. Warhol would continue to associate himself with people including Viva, Candy Darling, Ultra Violet, Nico and International Velvet.

Warhol&#x27;s studio, The Factory, played host to most of his superstars and as his experiments in film continued he became more interested in the bohemian eccentrics attracted to the studio. Some of the most important superstars to emerge from the period of the first Factory (known as the &#x27;Silver Factory&#x27; because silver foil had been applied to the walls and ceilings) include Paul America, Ondine, Taylor Mead, Rolando Peña, Mary Woronov, Eric Emerson, Gerard Malanga, Billy Name and Brigid Berlin.

Warhol significantly reduced his public accessibility after radical feminist Valerie Solanas attempted to assassinate him in 1968. 

In the later films, made in collaboration with Paul Morrissey, Warhol brought in new superstars including Joe Dallesandro, Penny Arcade, Andrea Feldman, Jane Forth, Geraldine Smith, and Sylvia Miles. During this period, Warhol developed an increasing fascination with trans women and drag queens, and promoted Candy Darling, Holly Woodlawn and Jackie Curtis to superstar status.

Several of the superstars are mentioned in Lou Reed&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;.

The age of the Warhol superstar faded as Warhol returned to painting in the 1970s.

==Films==
The 1966 film &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot;, about life amongst the superstars at Hotel Chelsea, was notable for finding success beyond New York City underground arthouse scene.

The later Warhol/Morrissey collaborations &quot;Flesh&quot;, &quot;Trash&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot;, and &quot;Women in Revolt&quot; are more frequently screened.

<text>The Karakash or Black Jade River, also spelled &quot;Karakax&quot; (, , Қарақаш Дәряси), is a river in the Xinjiang autonomous region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China that originates in Aksai Chin. It passes through the historical settlement of Xaidulla (Shahidulla or Saitula) and passes by the city of Khotan (Hotan) to flow northeast in the Tarim Basin. It merges with the Yurungkash River, the combined river taking the name Hotan River and flowing into the Tarim River.

== Course ==

The river begins above about northeast of Galwan Kangri peak in Aksai Chin. It flows north to Sumnal (15,540 ft), then turns sharply eastwards, flowing at the foot of the Karatagh Range (skirting just north of the Soda Plains of Aksai Chin). Just beyond Palong Karpo, it reaches the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, where it turns sharply northwestwards, and crosses into Xinjiang proper. At this location it receives another headwater now called the &#x27;East Karakash River&#x27; (which was once regarded as the main headwater). The combined river flows past the towns of Sumgal, Fotash, Gulbashem, until it reaches Xaidulla (Shahidulla).

The river then turns sharply northeastwards near Xaidulla, and, after passing through Ali Nazar cuts through the Kunlun mountain range near the Suget or Sanju Pass. It passes by Khotan to its west, running parallel to the Yurungkash River, which it joins near Koxlax (some 125 km north of Khotan (). The combined river is called the Hotan River, which flows into the Tarim River.

== History ==
The Karakash River is famous for its white and greenish jade (nephrite) carried as river boulders and pebbles toward Khotan, as does the nearby Yurungkash (or &#x27;White Jade&#x27;) River. This river jade originates from eroded mountain deposits of which the most famous one is near Gulbashen, in southwestern Xinjiang (formerly Chinese Turkestan). Black nephrite is also abundant in the Karakash River but these deposits are rarely reported in the primary nephrite finds.

The Karakash Valley was also a caravan road for the north–south trade between Yarkand (China) and Leh over the Karakoram Pass in Leh District of Ladakh.

<text>Joseph Othenin Bernard de Cléron, comte d&#x27;Haussonville (27 May 1809 – 28 May 1884), was a French politician and historian.

He was born in Paris. His grandfather had been &quot;grand louvetier&quot; of France; his father was Charles Louis Bernard de Cléron, comte d&#x27;Haussonville Comte Joseph had filled a series of diplomatic appointments at Brussels, Turin and Naples before he entered the chamber of deputies in 1842 for Provins. Under the Second Empire, he published a liberal anti-imperial paper at Brussels, &quot;Le Bulletin français&quot;, and in 1863 he actively supported the candidature of Prévost Paradol.
He was elected to the Académie française in 1869, in recognition of his historical writings, &quot;Histoire de la politique extérieure du gouvernement français de 1830 à 1848&quot; (2 vols., 1850), &quot;Histoire de la réunion de la Lorraine à la France&quot; (5 vols., 1854-1859), &quot;L&#x27;église romaine et le premier empire&quot; 1800-1814 (5 vols., 1864-1879). In 1870 he published a pamphlet directed against the Prussian treatment of France, &quot;La France et la Prusse devant l&#x27;Europe&quot;, the sale of which was prohibited in Belgium at the request of King Wilhelm of Prussia.

He was the president of an association formed to provide new homes in Algeria for the inhabitants of Alsace-Lorraine who elected to retain their French nationality. In 1878 he was made a life-senator, in which capacity he allied himself with the Right Centre in defence of the religious associations against the anti-clericals. He died in Paris on 28 May 1884.

His wife [[Louise de Broglie, Countess d&#x27;Haussonville|Louise]] (1818-1882), a daughter of Duc Victor de Broglie, published in 1858 a novel &quot;Robert Emuret&quot;, followed by &quot;Marguerite de Valois reine de Navarre&quot; (1870), &quot;La Jeunesse de Lord Byron&quot; (1872), and &quot;Les Dernières Années de Lord Byron&quot; (1874). His son, Gabriel-Paul-Othenin, was also a politician and historian.

<text>Alibori is the largest and northernmost department (French: &quot;département&quot;) of Benin. Externally the department borders the countries of Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria, and internally the departments of Atakora and Borgou. The department of Alibori was created in 1999 when it was split off from Borgou Department and is named after the Alibori River.

, the total population of the department was 867,463, with 431,357 males and 436,106 females. The proportion of women was 50.30%. The total rural population was 75.70%, while the urban population was 24.30%. The total labour force in the department was 201,622, of which 25.40% were women.

==Geography==

Alibori borders Niger to the north, Nigeria to the east, Borgou Department to the south, Atakora Department to the west, and Burkina Faso to the north-west. Alibori is a fertile region consisting of highland and savannah. Cotton, maize and cassava are the major crops grown. The northeast plains slope down to the valley of the Niger River which, along with the Mékrou River, forms the border with Niger. Other major rivers include the Alibori River, Sota River and Pako River. The department contains the bulk of Benin&#x27;s section of the trans-boundary W National Park.

The climate is mostly humid and tropical. The northern regions of Benin, in general, receives one season of rainfall from May to September, compared to the southern regions which receive two spells from March to July and September to November. Harmattan winds blow from the northeast from December through March. The average temperature from April to June is in Karimama, while the temperature ranges between between November and March. The average elevation of the department is above the mean sea level.

===Settlements===
Kandi is the departmental capital; other major settlements include Banikoara, Gounarou, Guénè, Malanville and Ségbana.

==Demographics==
According to Benin&#x27;s 2013 census, the total population of the department was 867,463, with 431,357 males and 436,106 females. The proportion of women was 50.30%. The total rural population was 75.70%, while the urban population was 24.30%. The proportion of women of childbearing age (15 to 49 years old) was 22.00%. The foreign population was 28,636, representing 3.30% of the total population in the department. The labour force participation rate among foreigners aged 15–64 years was 26.40%. The proportion of women among the foreign population constituted 47.60%. The number of households in the department was 108,351 and the average household size was 8. The intercensal growth rate of the population was 4.60%.

Among women, the average age of first marriage was 18.2 and the average age at maternity was 27.2. The synthetic index of fertility of women was 5.7.

The main ethnolinguistic groups in the department are the Bariba, Dendi and Fulani. Other groups include the Boko, Gurma, Kyenga and the Mokole Yoruba.

==Administrative divisions==

The department of Alibori was created in 1999, when it was split off from Borgou Department. Since 2008, the department&#x27;s capital has been Kandi. Alibori is subdivided into six communes, each centered at one of the principal towns: Banikoara, Gogounou, Kandi, Karimama, Malanville and Ségbana.

Benin originally had six administrative regions (&quot;départements&quot;), which have now been bifurcated to make 12. Each of the deconcentrated administrative services (&quot;directions départementales&quot;) of the sectoral ministries takes care of two administrative regions. A law passed in 1999 transformed the &quot;sous-prefectures&quot;, the lowest level of territorial administration, into local governments. Municipalities and communal councils have elected representatives who manage the administration of the regions. The latest elections of the municipal and communal councils were held in June 2015.

<text>The University of Cincinnati (UC or Cincinnati, informally Cincy) is a public research university in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. It was founded in 1819 and had an enrollment of over 53,000 students in 2024, making it the second-largest university in Ohio. It is part of the University System of Ohio. The university&#x27;s primary uptown campus and medical campus are located in the Heights and Corryville neighborhoods, with branch campuses located in Batavia and Blue Ash, Ohio.

The university has 14 constituent colleges, with programs in architecture, business, education, engineering, humanities, the sciences, law, music, and medicine. The medical college includes a leading teaching hospital and several biomedical research laboratories, with developments made including a live polio vaccine and diphenhydramine. UC was also the first university to implement a co-operative education (co-op) model.

The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. UC&#x27;s athletic teams are called the Cincinnati Bearcats and compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I as a member of the Big 12 Conference.

==History==

===Early history===
In 1819, Cincinnati College and the Medical College of Ohio were founded in Cincinnati. Local benefactor Daniel Drake founded and funded the Medical College of Ohio. William Lytle of the Lytle family donated the land, funded the Cincinnati College and Law College, and served as its first president. The college survived only six years before financial difficulties forced it to close. In 1835, Daniel Drake reestablished the institution, which eventually joined with the Cincinnati Law School.

In 1858, Charles McMicken died of pneumonia and in his will he allocated most of his estate to the City of Cincinnati to found a university. The University of Cincinnati was chartered by the Ohio legislature in 1870 after delays by livestock and veal lobbyists angered by the liberal arts-centered curriculum and lack of agricultural and manufacturing emphasis . The university&#x27;s board of rectors changed the institution&#x27;s name to the University of Cincinnati.

===Expansion and 20th century===
By 1893, the university expanded beyond its primary location on Clifton Avenue and relocated to its present location in the Heights neighborhood. As the university expanded, the rectors merged the institution with Cincinnati Law School, establishing the University of Cincinnati College of Law. In 1896, the Ohio Medical College joined Miami Medical College to form the Ohio-Miami Medical Department of the University of Cincinnati in 1909. As political movements for temperance and suffrage grew, the university established Teacher&#x27;s College in 1905 and a Graduate School in the College of Arts and Sciences in 1906. The Queen City College of Pharmacy, acquired from Wilmington College (Ohio), became the present James L. Winkle College of Pharmacy.

In 1962, the Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music was acquired by the university. The Ohio legislature in Columbus declared the university a &quot;municipally-sponsored, state-affiliated&quot; institution in 1968. During this time, the University of Cincinnati was the second oldest and second-largest municipal university in the United States. In 1971, the university became one of the first institutions in the United States to offer a women&#x27;s studies course, which was taught by Monika Triest and Sylvia Tucker.

===Modern history===
By an act of the Ohio Legislature, the University of Cincinnati became a state institution in 1977.

In 1989, President Joseph A. Steger released a Master Plan for a stronger academy. Over this time, the university invested nearly $2 billion in campus construction, renovation, and expansion ranging from the student union to a new recreation center to the medical school. It included renovation and construction of multiple buildings, a campus forest, and a university promenade. The plan also includes the Sigma Sigma Commons, which was completed in 1998 as a part of the organization&#x27;s centennial.

Upon her inauguration in 2005, President Nancy L. Zimpher developed the UC21 plan, designed to redefine Cincinnati as a leading urban research university. In addition, it includes putting liberal arts education at the center, increasing research funding, and expanding involvement in the city.

In 2009, Gregory H. Williams was named the 27th president of the University of Cincinnati. His presidency expanded the accreditation and property of the institution to regions throughout Ohio to compete with private and specialized state institutions, such as Ohio State University. His administration focused on maintaining the integrity and holdings of the university. He focused on the academic master plan for the university, placing the academic programs of UC at the core of the strategic plan. The university invested in scholarships, funding for study abroad experiences, the university&#x27;s advising program as it worked to reaffirm its history and academy for the future. Neville Pinto is the current and 30th president of the university.

In the wake of the George Floyd protests in 2020, a list of demands related to racial equity at the University of Cincinnati were sent to administrators by the Black Round Table and the UC Student Government, which included hiring more Black faculty, making the UC Police Department budget public, making Election Day and Juneteenth university holidays, and removing Charles McMicken&#x27;s name across campus, as McMicken was a slave owner. Some of the demands had been made by the Irate 8 group in 2015 following the killing of Samuel DuBose by a UC Police Department officer. In 2022, the university removed McMicken&#x27;s name from campus.

In 2025, under government mandate, the school stripped away its diversity, equity, and inclusion program, and replaced the signs on the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s bathrooms with ones that said &quot;biological men&quot; and &quot;biological women&quot;. The signage was quickly changed back after backlash and multiple campus-wide protests. 

==Campuses==

===Uptown campus===
The Uptown campus includes the West, Medical, and Victory Parkway campuses. The West campus is the main campus and includes 62 buildings on in the Heights neighborhood of Cincinnati. The university moved to this location in 1893. Most of the undergraduate colleges at the university are located on the main campus. The exceptions are part of the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center on the medical campus. The Japanese Language School of Greater Cincinnati, a supplementary school for Japanese citizens, moved to UC in 1984, and was held in fourteen rooms at Swift Hall. It was scheduled to move to the Northern Kentucky University (NKU) on July 1, 1993.

The medical campus contains nineteen buildings on in the Corryville neighborhood of Cincinnati. It is located diagonal to West campus on Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. The undergraduate colleges of Allied Health Sciences and Nursing, the graduate colleges of Medicine, and the James L. Winkle College of Pharmacy are located there. The hospitals located there include the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati VA Medical Center, and the Shriners Hospital for Children.

The Victory Parkway campus was formerly home to the College of Applied Science. It is roughly from the main campus in the Walnut Hills neighborhood of Cincinnati and overlooks the Ohio River. When it merged with the College of Engineering to become the College of Engineering and Applied Science many of the classes were moved to the main campus, but limited courses are still taught there. There is a shuttle that runs between this and the main campus throughout the day.
Numerous buildings on campus were designed by notable architects, causing the university to receive attention from architects and campus planners for beauty and design.
Off-campus facilities include the Center Hill Research Facility, UC Reading Campus &amp; UC Metabolic Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Center for Field Studies, Cincinnati Observatory, and 1819 Building.

===Regional campuses and online===
Blue Ash College was founded in 1967 as the first regional campus of the university. It is located in Blue Ash, Ohio. The Clermont College in Batavia, Ohio, opened in 1972. Both campuses offer numerous associate&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s programs; however, students who begin their degrees at UC&#x27;s regional campuses have the opportunity to transition to the Uptown campus to complete their degree.

UC Online offers over 120 graduate, undergraduate and certificate programs through an online distance education platform.

===Sustainability===
In the autumn of 2010, the University of Cincinnati maintained its position in green and sustainability initiatives by being named one of only 286 &quot;Green Colleges&quot; by The Princeton Review. The university has received this distinction each year since. UC was the only public university in Ohio and the only university in the Southern Ohio region included on this list. Some of the programs that helped achieve this distinction include: a bike share program where UC students can rent bikes from the university, an expanded recycling program, improved and expanded campus transportation options, the addition of vehicle charging stations, fuel pellet use in place of coal, greatly decreased energy and water use throughout campus, and the addition of 6 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings since 2005. In 2007, former university president Nancy Zimpher signed the American College &amp; University Presidents&#x27; Climate Commitment, which confirms the university&#x27;s dedication to reducing its environmental impact and take the necessary steps to become climate neutral.

In 2010, UC opened up a privately funded athletic practice facility and women&#x27;s lacrosse stadium named Sheakley Athletic Complex. As a continued effort to go green, a chilled water thermal energy storage tank was placed under the fields and at night water is chilled and then used to air-condition buildings on campus. The storage tank helps the university reach annual energy savings of about $1 million. In the fall of 2010, the university began placing &quot;All Recycling&quot; containers throughout campus. This expansion of recycling efforts and receptacles provides a greater opportunity for students, staff, and visitors to participate in recycling a broader range of materials. In 2010, UC recycled just over 4,600 tons of material, which was a 23 percent increase over the previous year.

==Academics==
===Undergraduate admissions===
Admission to the University of Cincinnati is classified as &quot;selective&quot; in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The Princeton Review gives Cincinnati an &quot;Admissions Selectivity Rating&quot; of 85 out of 99. The college extends offers of admission to 87.7% of all applicants after holistic review that includes examination of academic rigor, performance and admissions test scores.

Of all matriculating students, the average high school GPA is 3.7. The interquartile range for SAT scores in math and reading are 570–690 and 580–670 respectively, while the range for ACT scores is 24–29.

===Reputation and rankings===
In its 2025 rankings, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the university&#x27;s undergraduate program 152nd (tied) among 436 national universities, and 81st among public national universities. &quot;U.S. News&quot; also ranks UC fifth for co-ops/internships. Amongst global universities, UC was ranked 210th (tie) of 2,249.

===Colleges and schools===
The university is divided into 14 colleges:
* College of Allied Health Sciences
** School of Social Work
* College of Arts and Sciences
* Carl H. Lindner College of Business
* College-Conservatory of Music
* College of Cooperative Education and Professional Studies
* College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning
* College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services
* College of Engineering and Applied Science
* Graduate College
* College of Law
* College of Medicine
* College of Nursing
* James L. Winkle College of Pharmacy

The College of Arts and Sciences is the university&#x27;s largest college, with 21 departments, eight co-op programs, and several interdisciplinary programs. Winston Koch invented the first electronic organ at the College of Engineering and Applied Science. The College of Law is the alma mater of 27th U.S. president and 10th chief justice William Howard Taft, who also served as the college&#x27;s dean when it integrated with the University of Cincinnati in 1896.

The College of Medicine is the university&#x27;s medical school; it includes a leading teaching hospital and several biomedical research laboratories. In the 1950s Albert Sabin developed the live polio vaccine at the College of Medicine. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) was developed here by George Rieveschl in 1946. UC also established the first emergency medicine residency program. In 2008, it became the first medical college in the country to implement the multiple mini interview system for its admission process.

The university has two regional campuses: Blue Ash College in Blue Ash, Ohio, and Clermont College in Batavia, Ohio.

UC is also the home of the Institute for Policy Research, a multidisciplinary research organization which opened in 1971. The center performs a variety of surveys and polls on public opinion throughout Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, primarily through telephone surveys.

===Co-operative education===
The University of Cincinnati is the originator of the co-operative education (Co-Op) model. The concept was invented at UC in 1906 by Herman Schneider, Dean of the College of Engineering at the time. The program generally consists of alternating semesters of coursework on campus and outside work at a host firm, giving students over one year of relevant work experience by the time they graduate. All programs in the College of Engineering and Applied Science, Architecture programs, all design programs in the College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning, and Information Technology in the College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services, require co-operative education experience to graduate.

===University Honors Program===
Each year UC welcomes roughly 375 students, or usually the top 5–8% of students, to the University Honors Program. Students admitted into the Honors program typically meet the following qualifications: an ACT composite score of 32 or higher, an SAT score of 1400 or higher (critical reading and math combined), and either an unweighted high school GPA of 3.6 or a weighted high school GPA of 3.8.

The program is centered around students taking part in &quot;experiences&quot;. Experiences are defined as &quot;fall[ing] within one of five competencies: community engagement, creativity, global studies, leadership, and research.&quot; Experiences could take the form of Honors Seminars, which are certain three credit-hour courses, Pre-Approved Experiences, which consist of programs the Honors Program has already deemed to meet the requirements of an experience, and Self-Designed Experiences, where students design their own experience plan to submit to the Honors Program for approval. Students are required to complete at least five experiences before graduation.

==Research==
The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. According to the National Science Foundation, UC spent $480 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 54th in the nation.
===Libraries===
The University of Cincinnati has 13 libraries, which are housed in 11 different facilities. The university library system has holdings of over 4 million volumes and 70,000 periodicals. The average circulation is around 451,815 items and 116,532 reference transactions. The University of Cincinnati is a member of the Association of Research Libraries and the OhioLINK consortium of libraries.

==Student life==
===Housing===
6,500 students live on campus in ten residence halls that offer both traditional and suite style options. Students also have the option to live in themed housing, which include honors, business, and STEM-specific floors. In the fall of 2012, Campus Recreation Center Housing (CRC) was named on &quot;The Fiscal Times&quot;″ list of &quot;10 Public Colleges with Insanely Luxurious Dorms&quot;. Nearly 80% of Uptown Campus incoming freshman students live on campus their first year.

In recent years, record freshman classes and increased interest by upperclass students has led to higher demand than supply for on-campus residence halls. To meet this demand, UC Housing and Food Services has added residence halls (Morgens Hall in 2013) and purchased block leases at University Park Apartments, Campus Park Apartments (formerly Sterling Manor), University Edge Apartments, and Stetson Square Apartments near campus. This has pushed the &quot;on-campus&quot; housing student population higher. UC&#x27;s largest residence hall, Calhoun, was recently renovated, being finished in January 2023. Neighbors to Calhoun, Siddall Hall closed for renovation in December 2023 and is set to reopen in August 2024. UC Housing &amp; Food Services manages ten undergraduate residence halls.

The university also offers limited housing to graduate students. Bellevue Gardens is an apartment community owned and operated by the university. It is located close to the Academic Health Center (AHC) and medical campus. Two off-campus university-affiliated (but not university-managed) housing options were introduced in 2005: Stratford Heights and University Park Apartments. All leases in the Stratford Heights housing area have been terminated, and control of the housing complex reverted to University control as a residence hall in the summer of 2009.

===Programs===
The Center for First-Year Experience provides leadership for each student&#x27;s first-year experience and related academic program. The center serves as a resource for all the university&#x27;s undergraduate colleges and programs. The program is a collaboration between UC colleges, academic programs, and student groups and is designed to help freshmen with the transition from high school to college.

Learning communities are groups of about 20–25 students as well as faculty. Students take two classes together throughout their first year on campus, based on their major or area of study. There are nearly 120 learning communities to choose from. They are offered in the following colleges: College of Allied Health Sciences, College of Business, College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services, College of Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences, College of Nursing, and the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. A few majors require freshmen to be in these learning communities. Many of these groups have specialized courses taught by their academic advisor.

The Transition and Access Program, which does not lead to a degree, allows certain disabled adults to take classes, interact with other students, and intern at companies. After four years, participants receive a certificate of completion.

The University of Cincinnati was one of the first universities in the country to be classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a Community Engagement focused university and was one of only 35 research universities on this list.

===Student organizations===
Student Activities &amp; Leadership Development (SALD) oversees over 550 registered student organizations ranging from student government to religious organizations to spirit groups. Housed in the Steger Student Life Center, the divisions overseeing these groups include Club Sports Board, Diversity Education, Greek Life, Leadership Development, Programming, RAPP, Undergraduate Student Government and Graduate Student Government. Other Student Life offices on campus include the African American Cultural &amp; Resource Center, Bearcat Bands (the largest and oldest student group at UC), Early Learning Center, Ethnic Programs &amp; Services, University Judicial Affairs, Resident Education &amp; Development, Wellness Center, and Women&#x27;s Center.

===Greek life===
Fraternities and sororities have been a part of the university since 1840. There are over 2,500 students participating in fraternities and sororities, which represents approximately 11% of the undergraduate population (Uptown Campus). 52 chapters have called UC home over the years, and currently includes 39 social fraternities and sororities: 21 Interfraternity Council fraternities, nine Panhellenic Council sororities, seven National Pan-Hellenic Council (three fraternities and four sororities), and two non-affiliated (Delta Phi Lambda and Phi Sigma Rho) organizations.

===Media===
There are several media outlets for university students. The student newspaper, &quot;The News Record&quot;, has been in production for more than 130 years, taking its current name in 1936. It is an independent, student-run newspaper and not attached to any academic program; therefore any student, regardless of program, is able to apply and work for the newspaper. A student-run radio station named Bearcast is housed in the College-Conservatory of Music on campus. The programming streams online as opposed to a traditional radio station and, like the &quot;News Record&quot;, is open to any student attending the university. There is also a television station called UCast.

The 48-hour Cindependent Film Festival is held each year for the general public. The festival has featured guest speakers and filmmakers including Fraser Kershaw, as well as speakers and artists from Kenyatta University in Nairobi, Kenya. Actors, directors, editors, and composers are showcased at the MainStreet Cinema for students and professionals.

==Athletics==

The university competes in 19 Division I (NCAA) sports, and its athletics teams are known as the &quot;Bearcats&quot;. Since July 1, 2023, have been members of the Big 12 Conference. They were previously members of the American Athletic Conference (The American), Big East Conference, Conference USA (of which they were a founding member), the Great Midwest Conference, the Metro Conference, and the Mid-American Conference, among others.

The university hosts various club sports, some of which are distinguished as Club Varsity. Some include the Bearcat hockey team and the club rowing team, which produced 2000 and 2004 Olympian Kelly Salchow.

Notable Cincinnati Bearcats athletes include Sandy Koufax, Miller Huggins, Oscar Robertson, Jack Twyman, Omar Cummings, Kenyon Martin, Travis Kelce, Jason Kelce, Mary Wineberg and Tony Trabert.

===National championships===
The university has four individual and six team championships. The Bearcats won the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship in 1961 and 1962, both times against the Ohio State Buckeyes. Charles Keating won the 1946 200-meter butterfly national title for UC as a member of the men&#x27;s swimming team, and, most recently, Josh Schneider did the same in the freestyle in 2010. In women&#x27;s diving, Pat Evans (3 m dive – 1989) and Becky Ruehl (10 m dive – 1996) have brought home titles for the Bearcats. The UC dance team has won four National Championships from 2004 through 2006 and again in 2009. They are the first team in UC history to capture three consecutive national titles. They remain one of the top dance programs in the country and are the winningest team in University of Cincinnati history. In 2009 the dance team was also selected to represent the United States in the first world dance championships where they won the gold medal in all three dance categories.

===Athletic facilities===
All of the athletic facilities, with the exception of Fifth Third Arena and UC Baseball Stadium, are open 24/7 for student use.

The Richard E. Lindner Varsity Village, a key feature of UC&#x27;s athletic complex, was commissioned as part of the university&#x27;s entry into the Big East Conference. Opened in 2006, it serves as the hub of UC&#x27;s athletic facilities. The complex includes the Richard E. Lindner Center, which offers spaces for training, meetings, studying, and classrooms, as well as the George and Helen Smith Athletics Museum. The Varsity Village project also includes several notable venues: Gettler Stadium, home to the soccer team; the Trabert-Talbert Tennis Center; UC Baseball Stadium, which replaced Johnny Bench Field; and Sheakley Lawn, an open athletic field for student use.

Nippert Stadium serves as the home field for the Cincinnati Bearcats football team and occasionally hosts women&#x27;s lacrosse games. A permanent home for UC football, the Indoor Practice Facility &amp; Performance Center is being built on the site of Sheakley Field. The field will provide an all-weather home for Cincinnati football practices and year-round workouts and have direct access to the Performance Center&#x27;s weight room, training room and performance nutrition fueling stations. Construction started in April 2023, and the goal for completion is the spring of 2025.

The UC Baseball Stadium is the home field for the Cincinnati Bearcats baseball team. In 2020, former Cincinnati Reds owner and alumna Marge Schott&#x27;s name was removed from the name of the UC Baseball Stadium, following a unanimous vote by the university&#x27;s board of trustees. The vote was in response to a petition by former UC baseball player Jordan Ramey which garnered nearly 10,000 signatures.

The Armory Fieldhouse is home to UC&#x27;s indoor track and field teams, and it was once the venue for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. Fifth Third Arena is the current home for UC&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams, as well as the volleyball team. Ben and Dee Gettler Stadium is where the women&#x27;s soccer team and the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field teams compete. The Trabert-Talbert Tennis Center is dedicated to the UC women&#x27;s tennis team. Lastly, the Keating Aquatics Center is home to the UC men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving teams, completing the diverse range of athletic facilities available at the university.

<doc id="526019" wikidata="Q1205832" url="?curid=526019" title="Nominal interest rate">
<text>In finance and economics, the nominal interest rate or nominal rate of interest is the rate of interest stated on a loan or investment, without any adjustments for inflation.
==Examples of adjustments or fees==

# An adjustment for inflation (in contrast with the real interest rate).
# Compound interest (also referred to as the nominal annual rate).

==Nominal versus real interest rate==
The concept of real interest rate is useful to account for the impact of inflation. In the case of a loan, it is this real interest that the lender effectively receives. For example, if the lender is receiving 8 percent from a loan and the inflation rate is also 8 percent, then the (effective) real rate of interest is zero: despite the increased nominal amount of currency received, the lender would have no monetary value benefit from such a loan because each unit of currency would be devalued due to inflation by the same factor as the nominal amount gets increased.

The relationship between the real interest value formula_1, the nominal interest rate value formula_2,
and the inflation rate value formula_3 is given by
:formula_4

or

:formula_5

When the inflation rate formula_3 is low, the real interest rate is approximately given by the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate, i.e., 
:formula_7

In this analysis, the nominal rate is the stated rate, and the real interest rate is the interest after the expected losses due to inflation. Since the future inflation rate can only be estimated, the &quot;ex ante&quot; and &quot;ex post&quot; (before and after the fact) real interest rates may be different; the premium paid to actual inflation (higher or lower).

==Nominal versus effective interest rate==
The nominal interest rate, also known as an annual percentage rate or APR, is the periodic interest rate multiplied by the number of periods per year. For example, a nominal annual interest rate of 12% based on monthly compounding means a 1% interest rate per month (compounded). A nominal interest rate for compounding periods less than a year is always lower than the equivalent rate with annual compounding (this immediately follows from elementary algebraic manipulations of the formula for compound interest). Note that a nominal rate without the compounding frequency is not fully defined: for any interest rate, the effective interest rate cannot be specified without knowing the compounding frequency &quot;and&quot; the rate. Although some conventions are used where the compounding frequency is understood, consumers in particular may fail to understand the importance of knowing the effective rate.

Nominal interest rates are not comparable unless their compounding periods are the same; effective interest rates correct for this by &quot;converting&quot; nominal rates into annual compound interest. In many cases, depending on local regulations, interest rates as quoted by lenders and in advertisements are based on nominal, not effective interest rates, and hence may understate the interest rate compared to the equivalent effective annual rate.

Confusingly, in the context of inflation, &#x27;nominal&#x27; has a different meaning. A nominal rate can mean a rate before adjusting for inflation, and a real rate is a constant-prices rate. The Fisher equation is used to convert between real and nominal rates. To avoid confusion about the term nominal which has these different meanings, some finance textbooks use the term &#x27;Annualised Percentage Rate&#x27; or APR rather than &#x27;nominal rate&#x27; when they are discussing the difference between effective rates and APR&#x27;s.

The term should not be confused with simple interest (as opposed to compound interest) which is not compounded.

The effective interest rate is always calculated as if compounded annually. The effective rate is calculated in the following way, where &quot;r&quot; is the effective rate, &quot;i&quot; the nominal rate (as a decimal, e.g. 12% = 0.12), and &quot;n&quot; the number of compounding periods per year (for example, 12 for monthly compounding):
:formula_8

==Examples==
===Monthly compounding===
Example 1: A nominal interest rate of 6% compounded monthly is equivalent to an effective interest rate of 6.17%. 

Example 2: 6% annually is credited as 6%/12 = 0.5% every month. After one year, the initial capital is increased by the factor (1+0.005)12 ≈ 1.0617.

===Daily compounding===
A loan with daily compounding has a substantially higher rate in effective annual terms. For a loan with a 10% nominal annual rate and daily compounding, the effective annual rate is 10.516%. For a loan of $10,000 (paid at the end of the year in a single lump sum), the borrower would pay $51.56 more than one who was charged 10% interest, compounded annually.

<text>Sergels torg (&quot;Sergel&#x27;s Square&quot;) is a major public square in Stockholm, Sweden, constructed in the 1960s and named after 18th-century sculptor Johan Tobias Sergel, whose workshop was once located north of the square.

== Overview ==
Sergels torg has a dominant west-to-east axis and is divided into three distinct parts:
# A sunken pedestrian plaza furnished with a triangular-colored floor pattern (colloquially referred to as &quot;Plattan&quot;, &quot;The Slab&quot;) and a wide flight of stairs leading up to the pedestrian street Drottninggatan, connecting south to Stockholm Old Town and north to Kungsgatan. The triangular pattern of the square is featured on the seats of C30 and refurbished C20 trains of the Stockholm metro.
# This plaza is partly overbuilt by a roundabout centered on a glass obelisk and by the concrete decks of three major streets.
# North of this traffic junction is a considerably smaller open space overlooked by the high-rise façade of the fifth Hötorget Building from where the avenue Sveavägen extends north.

The site south of the square is taken up by the cultural centre Kulturhuset, which also harbours the Stockholm City Theatre and hides the Bank of Sweden headquarters facing the square Brunkebergstorg behind. The street Klarabergsgatan leads west past the department store Åhléns City and Klara Church to the Klaraberg Viaduct and Kungsholmen. Hamngatan leads east under Malmskillnadsgatan to Kungsträdgården, Norrmalmstorg, and Strandvägen. Together with the underground mall east of the pedestrian plaza and the T-Centralen metro station and other continuous underpasses west thereof, Sergels torg forms part of a continuous underground structure almost a kilometre in length.

Since its creation, Sergels torg has been much criticized for giving priority to cars at the cost of pedestrians. It has, among some quarters, become the main target for criticism of the much debated demolition of the central city district of Klara during the 1950s and 1960s. Nevertheless, it is not dissimilar to but larger than the public space in front of Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and much like its French counterpart remains the most popular space in Stockholm for meeting friends, for political demonstrations, for a wide range of events, and for drug-dealers. This includes the fountain, in which people celebrate major victories by Swedish sports teams.

== History ==

The construction of the square was completed in 1967. Before the creation of Sergels torg, Brunkebergstorg was the most important public space in the area, the hub about which traffic revolved, the place where people would go to work and to find entertainment.
=== Early proposals ===
Albert Lilienberg was appointed city-planning superintendent in 1927, and a year later he produced the first proposal for a public square on the location in his general plan of 1928. In his proposal he envisioned a square whose north-south oriented axis would line-up with Sveavägen intended to be extended south across the square down to the waterfront with widened Hamngatan and Klarabergsgatan joining in from west and east. After this first proposal, the square is featured on every subsequent city plan produced for the area, with alternations in width and length. Notwithstanding the considerable number of revised proposals produced, surprisingly few were preoccupied by architectonic considerations, instead focusing on optimization of traffic flow.

In the city plan Helldén produced in 1946, the square, still named &quot;Sveaplatsen&quot; (&quot;Swede Plaza&quot;), was conceived as similar to the present square, but still remained an unarticulated modernistic concept. In this proposal, the square was centred on a rectangular open space furnished with trees, benches, and ponds; a space reached by subways stretching under the surrounding roundabout. During the 1950s, continuously increasing traffic loads made separating pedestrians and car traffic desirable, and several studies produced around 1955 focused on a lower level for pedestrians with cars on street-level with various openings to allow light down to the pedestrians.

=== Final proposal ===

In 1957, a first official proposal presented a square virtually similar to the present; except that instead of the fountain there was an opening with tall trees and on the western side, where the flight of stairs is today, was a building standing on pillars. The Chamber of Commerce was critical of the concept, concluding pedestrians on a lower level would produce poor business sites, an analysis which would eventually prove correct. Their own proposal the following year, developed together with various authorities, reserved street-level to pedestrians while cars were confined below ground. This counter-proposal was however produced in only two months, which made it easy for opponents to pin-down its weaknesses (mostly a failure to leave enough space for the metro which was being constructed at this time). Nevertheless, Helldén&#x27;s proposal failed to impress the city as well, and Helldén together with other hand-picked experts was therefore sent on a tour around Europe, including Coventry and London, to find a better solution. In Stuttgart they could conclude that having pedestrians on a lower level required escalators, and in Vienna the pedestrian underpass Opernpassage gave them the inspiration to replace the central open space at &quot;Sveaplatsen&quot; with a round restaurant with glass walls, an aesthetic device intended to give the square an architectonic dignity.

This newly introduced centre-piece resulted in a proposal for a fountain with a monument above it. For the shape of this fountain, Helldén consulted his friend, the mathematician and artist Piet Hein, who in less than in minute found a curve with a &quot;continuously varying bending&quot; and immediately named it the superellipse. Before presenting his final proposal in 1960, Helldén added the triangular pattern to the pedestrian plaza and the wide stairs on its western side.

A contest for the central monument in 1962 was won by Edvin Öhrström, with the 37 metre tall glass obelisk which was named &quot;Kristall - vertikal accent i glas och stål&quot; (&quot;Crystal - vertical accent in glass and steel&quot;). The sculpture, finally completed in 1974 and since haunted by technical problems, never was able to deliver the intended visual output and - quoting Hall - &quot;thus adds itself to the many projects within the [reconstruction of central Stockholm] that didn&#x27;t endure confrontation with reality.&quot; The artist favoured by Helldén, Olle Baertling, started to work on a sculpture for the square in 1960 but never was invited to participate in the contest.

=== Kulturhuset ===

South of the square, intentions were to erect two buildings separated by a street leading to Brunkebergstorg, but the old buildings south of the square turned their gables towards the modernist composition of Helldén throughout most of the 1960s. A contest in 1965 for this area included a cultural centre proposed by Pontus Hultén, the legendary founder of Moderna Museet who wished to see his museum relocated from the isolated island Skeppsholmen. The contest was won by architect Peter Celsing and Kulturhuset was eventually inaugurated in 1974. It basically is a single huge concrete wall from which are consoling shallow stories with glassed façades, a structure Hultén lyrically described as a stage which would &quot;exercise a strong attractive force&quot; by exhibiting people and works of art through the glass façade.

However, considering Stockholm&#x27;s northern location, to give the sun full access to public spaces is top priority, and Kulturhuset has proven a problematic wall which not only shuts the sun off, but also tends to dominate the square with its large volume. Additionally, Sergels torg is dominated by its traffic roundabout and is hard to experience as a single coherent space. Together with the traffic structure at Slussen, built in the 1930s, Sergels torg is thus an attempt with few parallels in the world, to make public art of a traffic junction dominating the central district of a city. Since the mid-1990s, numerous proposals to rebuild the square have been produced, and the debate regarding the square is likely to continue.

Currently (2015) large areas of the place are closed for renovation of the 50 years old structures. There is also preparation for the installation of tram tracks from Hamngatan to Klarabergsgatan.

<text>Riksgränsen, (), &quot;The National Border&quot; in Swedish, is a ski-resort in Kiruna Municipality, Lappland, Sweden, 200 km north of the Arctic Circle. The skiing season is from February to June. From end of May the lifts operate under the midnight sun. One of the pistes cross the border to Norway and back to Sweden. No border control there. It is the most northern ski resort in the world.

Riksgränsen is a popular location for the winter testing of pre-production cars by various European manufacturers. Photo-snipers are prevalent, attempting to get the first spy-shots of new models, though their activities are frowned upon by local hoteliers who value the custom of the manufacturers. The same manufacturers frequently use the location for winter launches, bringing journalists from across the world to drive the new cars on snow-covered roads and on courses specially prepared on frozen lakes.

==History==
The village was founded around 1900 in connection with the construction of the railway, whose traffic began 1902. Due to railway politics and limited range for steam locomotives, trains changed locomotives and crew and a roundhouse for locomotives was built. Later, after electrification 1923, this roundhouse was removed and locomotives went all the way to Narvik. Tourism picked up in the 1930:s. The first ski lift was built 1952.

==Climate==
Although the subarctic climate (Koppen: Dfc) of the region is very cold, it has considerably milder winters than normally expected for an inland northerly area, due to its proximity to the warm North Atlantic Current. Summers do remain cool in spite of the midnight sun due to similar maritime effects. With prevailing low-pressure systems taking precedence, the climate is snowy and cloudy. The deep snow cover and the time it takes for thawing prolongs the skiing season to the midnight sun window. The snow depth can be above in unshovelled areas during spring. The snow depth charts have sometimes ended during late May when the pack has been shrinking, which skews the June readings that likely are a bit higher. In 2020, a snow depth was measured in that month.

<text>The Lane Sisters were a family of American singers and actresses. The sisters were Leota Lane (October 25, 1903 – July 25, 1963), [[Lola Lane]] (May 21, 1906 – June 22, 1981), [[Rosemary Lane (actress)|Rosemary Lane]] (April 4, 1913 – November 25, 1974) and [[Priscilla Lane]] (June 12, 1915 – April 4, 1995). 

Lola, Rosemary, and Priscilla co-starred with Gale Page in four films together: &quot;Four Daughters&quot; (1938), &quot;Daughters Courageous&quot; (1939), &quot;Four Wives&quot; (1939) and &quot;Four Mothers&quot; (1941). Leota did not find the same success as her sisters and left Hollywood for New York City before the sisters&#x27; breakthrough.

==Sisters==
==Early life==
The four sisters, Leotabel (Leota), Dorothy (Lola), Rosemary and Priscilla, were from a family of five daughters born to Dr. Lorenzo A. Mullican and his wife, Cora Bell Hicks. (Their other daughter, Martha, did not enter show business.) The first three children had been born in Macy, Indiana, but the family moved in 1907 to Indianola, Iowa, a small college town south of Des Moines. Here Dr. Mullican had a dental practice. The Mullicans owned a large house with 22 rooms, some of which they rented out to students attending nearby Simpson College.

Before marrying, Cora Bell Hicks had been a reporter with a local newspaper in Macy, and had originally harbored acting ambitions herself, but was frustrated by the strict religious beliefs of her Methodist parents who frowned on any form of public entertainment. Cora Mullican encouraged her daughters to sing and play musical instruments. All the girls were fond of music, and at one time or another studied music in night classes at Simpson College in Indianola. Dorothy was already playing piano at age twelve for a silent screen movie house.

==Career==
Leota was the first to leave home to pursue a musical career in New York in the mid-1920s. In 1928, Dorothy (later Lola) followed Leota to New York. The girls shared an apartment and made the theatrical rounds. They eventually obtained parts in a Gus Edwards show, &quot;Greenwich Village Follies&quot;. It was Edwards who changed their names to Lane, and consequently Dorothy became Lola Lane. Martha, meanwhile, eloped with a college professor and moved to Des Moines. She had no interest in show business. She had a child, later divorced, and became a medical secretary. 
Leota and Lola both made their Broadway debuts in the late twenties, Lola in 1928, as Sally Moss in &quot;The War Song&quot;, which opened on Broadway on August 24, 1928, at the Nederlander Theatre (then known as the National Theatre) and Leota in 1929 as Contrary Mary in &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;, which opened on December 23, 1929 at Jolson&#x27;s 59th Street Theatre. &quot;The War Song&quot; closed four months into its run and Lola went to Hollywood where she made her debut starring as Alice Woods alongside Paul Page in the drama &quot;Speakeasy&quot; (1929). She was soon teamed with Page again in the film &quot;The Girl from Havana&quot; (1929) as Joan Anders. Meanwhile &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; closed after only thirty-two performances. Leota followed her sister to Hollywood where she made her screen appearance in a comedy short film &quot;Three Hollywood Girls&quot; (1931) directed by Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle, but soon returned to New York.

Rosemary and Priscilla travelled to Des Moines every weekend to study dancing with Rose Lorenz. The girls made their first professional appearance September 30, 1930, at Des Moines&#x27; Paramount Theater. Rosemary, then 17, and Priscilla, 15, performed on stage as part of the entertainment accompanying the release of Lola&#x27;s Hollywood movie, &quot;Good News&quot;. Rosemary, a member of the National Honor Society, graduated from Indianola High in 1931 and attended Simpson College for a while, playing on the freshman basketball team. 

After graduating from high school, Priscilla was permitted to travel to New York to visit Leota who was then appearing in a musical revue in Manhattan. Priscilla decided to enroll at the nearby Fagen School of Dramatics and Leota paid the fee. At this time talent agent Al Altman saw Priscilla performing in one of Fagen&#x27;s school plays and invited her to screentest for MGM. She was 16 years old. Priscilla wrote to a friend in Indianola, &quot;Leota accompanied me to a sort of theater in a New York skyscraper. Others were there being made up. One was a strange-looking girl with her hair slicked back in a sort of a bun. Her name is said to be Catherine [sic] Hepburn. Not very pretty, I thought, but Mr. Altman said she has something. Margaret Sullavan, the Broadway actress, was there too!&quot; A follow-up letter said that her test had proven unsuitable. Neither Hepburn nor Sullavan were approved, and neither received a contract from MGM at the time.
In the meantime, Cora had left her husband and in 1932, accompanied by Rosemary, arrived in New York. Cora immediately went to work pushing her two young daughters into attending auditions for various prospective Broadway productions, without success. It was while the girls were trying out numbers at a music publishing office that Fred Waring, an orchestra leader, heard them harmonizing. He found them attractive and individually talented. In early 1933 with Cora&#x27;s approval they were signed to a contract with Waring. Cora acted as chaperone to Rosemary and Priscilla who at this time adopted the name Lane.

Fred Waring not only toured with his band, known as &quot;The Pennsylvanians&quot;, but had a weekly radio show. Priscilla quickly became known as the comedienne of the group. Rosemary sang the ballads while Priscilla performed the swing numbers and wisecracked with Waring and various guests. Dr. Mullican instituted divorce proceedings against his wife on the grounds of desertion, and the divorce was granted in 1933.

Rosemary and Priscilla remained with Fred Waring for almost five years. In 1937, Waring was engaged by Warner Bros. in Hollywood to appear with his entire band in &quot;Varsity Show&quot;, a musical starring Dick Powell. Both Rosemary and Priscilla were tested and awarded feature roles in the film. Rosemary shared the romantic passages with Powell, while Priscilla was a high-spirited college girl.

Although Lola had been in Hollywood since 1929, she had twice retired from the screen for marriage. Now she had made a comeback. She was second lead to Bette Davis in the melodrama, &quot;Marked Woman&quot;, and won critical acclaim. Lola played the part of Gaby, a tough clip joint &quot;hostess&quot;. Warners awarded her a contract in 1937 and her looks suited the hard-edged roles she found at Warners.
Warner&#x27;s purchased Priscilla and Rosemary&#x27;s contract from Fred Waring and signed them to seven-year pacts. Priscilla&#x27;s first film after &quot;Varsity Show&quot; was &quot;Men are Such Fools&quot;, in which she starred opposite Wayne Morris. This was followed by &quot;Love Honor and Behave&quot;, another light romantic comedy again with Morris and &quot;Cowboy From Brooklyn&quot; again teaming with Dick Powell. The publicity department at the studio suggested that Priscilla and Morris be seen together around town; they liked each other and did date for a period; however, Priscilla later said it was never serious on either side. Rosemary&#x27;s first film after &quot;Varsity Show&quot; was the musical &quot;Hollywood Hotel&quot;, in which she co-starred with sister Lola and former co-star Dick Powell, before starring in &quot;Gold Diggers in Paris&quot;, opposite Rudy Vallee.

Priscilla was next assigned the lead in &quot;Brother Rat&quot;, which had been a very successful Broadway play. Again she played opposite Wayne Morris, and among the cast were such newcomers as Ronald Reagan, Jane Wyman, Jane Bryan, and Eddie Albert. The film, when released in October 1938, was a big success for all the young players. At this time of professional success, the sisters were informed that Dr. Mullican had died in Iowa.

Warner Bros. had purchased a story by Fannie Hurst titled &quot;Sister Act&quot; and planned to star Errol Flynn in the film, along with four actresses. Flynn, however, was withdrawn from the project to star in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. The script for &quot;Sister Act&quot; was then rewritten to place the emphasis on the four girls. Bette Davis was to be the star, but she refused the role. Lola, always enterprising, approached Jack L. Warner with the suggestion she and her sisters star in the film. Warner agreed, and Leota was summoned from New York to test for the part of Emma, but proved unsuitable. The studio substituted Gale Page, a young contractee as the fourth daughter. The actress would be tagged for the rest of her career as the fourth Lane. When the film, now titled &quot;Four Daughters&quot;, was released on September 24, 1938, it proved to be a big hit and was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It was followed by two sequels, &quot;Four Wives&quot; in 1939 and &quot;Four Mothers&quot; in 1941, again starring the Lanes and Gale Page. Leota played Emma in the Lux Radio Theater version of the film heard on the evening of December 18, 1939. In New York, Leota had completed a BS degree in Music at the Juilliard School in May, 1939.
Priscilla&#x27;s next assignment was &quot;Yes, My Darling Daughter&quot;, adapted from a successful play. The story concerned a girl, the daughter of a feminist and one time suffragette, who decides to spend a weekend alone with her fiancé, played by Jeffrey Lynn. The premise of the film in which an unmarried couple spent a weekend together unchaperoned was roundly criticized and was banned in some parts of the United States. The publicity, however, piqued public curiosity, and the film became a box office hit. Priscilla received praise for her vivacious performance, as did Lynn playing the boy friend. The supporting cast included Roland Young, Fay Bainter, May Robson, Genevieve Tobin, and Ian Hunter.

Upon completion of this film Warners sent Priscilla, Rosemary, Errol Flynn, and Ann Sheridan among others on a personal appearance tour in conjunction with the release of Flynn&#x27;s first western &quot;Dodge City&quot;. Priscilla enjoyed the experience and the chance to travel through the country. Returning to Hollywood, another story was prepared to feature the four daughters, &quot;Daughters Courageous&quot;, which co-starred John Garfield who had also co-starred in both &quot;Four Daughters&quot; and &quot;Four Wives&quot;. Although the story was different, it also covered the lives and loves of four sisters, and proved to be another hit with the public. 

Priscilla was again cast with John Garfield in &quot;Dust Be My Destiny&quot;, a melodrama of prison life. She played the sympathetic stepdaughter of a brutal prison foreman, played by Stanley Ridges. She falls in love with convict Garfield. The original ending of the film had the young lovers dying as fugitives from justice. Audience reaction at previews was so negative that the studio withdrew the film and reshot a happy ending. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;She is completely sincere throughout with several dramatic scenes rising far above the material provided.&quot; Rosemary Lane was also teamed with Garfield in &quot;Blackwell&#x27;s Island&quot; (1939), however this was not a success.

Priscilla attained full starring status in her next film, &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot; and was billed above the title along with James Cagney. A major box office hit, Priscilla was shown to advantage as a night club singer, who marries lawyer Jeffrey Lynn, but is lusted after by gangster Cagney. She sang &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;, &quot;Melancholy Baby&quot;, and &quot;I’m Just Wild About Harry&quot;.

At this point, Priscilla was earning $750 a week, a fantastic salary for the Depression era, but puny compared to the salaries of other studio stars. She demanded an increase. She felt the plot of her next movie, &quot;Money and the Woman&quot; was sordid and refused to report for work. Her agent explained, &quot;The role is not one she should be asked to do.&quot; She was replaced by Brenda Marshall. 

Priscilla was next assigned the lead in &quot;My Love Came Back&quot;, a romantic story involving a female violinist. Again, Priscilla refused the part, so a furious Jack Warner suspended her. Olivia de Havilland, although equally reluctant to do the film, eventually agreed. 

===Later careers and eventual retirement===
Lola continued her career into the 1940s with her tough girl persona in dramas such as &quot;Convicted Woman&quot; (1940), &quot;Gangs of Chicago&quot; (1940), &quot;Mystery Ship&quot; (1941), &quot;Miss V from Moscow&quot; (1942) and &quot;Lost Canyon&quot; (1942), although she desperately wanted to break away from her type-casting . She retired at the age of forty in 1946. Her last three films – &quot;Why Girls Leave Home&quot; (1945) as Irene Mitchell, &quot;Deadline at Dawn&quot; (1946) as Edna Bartelli, and &quot;They Made Me a Killer&quot; (1946) as Betty Ford – had her in supporting roles.

Rosemary earned good reviews for 1940&#x27;s &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot;, based on Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s Broadway hit of 1938. The next year she made an unusual move for a film actress of her era by becoming a Broadway star in the musical &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;, as Gale Joy, which opened on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on October 1, 1941. It closed after 326 performances on the fourth of July 1942. However she lost the subsequent movie role to Lucille Ball. Good movie roles dwindled and Rosemary closed out her film career in 1945 with &quot;Sing Me a Song of Texas&quot;, as nightclub singer Laurie Lang, the niece of a wealthy Texas rancher. She began a career selling real estate from an office in Pacific Palisades.

After winning her raise, Priscilla returned to work, but the films assigned to her were no better than those she had turned down. &quot;Brother Rat and a Baby&quot; was an inferior sequel and &quot;Three Cheers for the Irish&quot; gave her little to do.

The British &quot;Picturegoer&quot; magazine, always a supporter of the Lane Sisters, stated that all was not right with Priscilla Lane. In its June 15, 1940 issue, they wondered why &quot;Priscilla was still knocking at the door of major stardom&quot;. They felt Warner Bros. was casting her as stooge to such actors as John Garfield and James Cagney. They went on to say Priscilla had great charm and while not a really great dramatic actress, deserved much larger and more important roles than she was getting. The same magazine, two years later on August 22, 1942, referred to their 1940 article and once again expressed disappointment at Warners&#x27; treatment of the star. They were unaware that she had already left the studio.

On April 28, 1941, she was heard on &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; with George Brent and Gail Patrick in &quot;Wife, Husband and Friend&quot;. At Warner Bros. she appeared opposite Ronald Reagan in a light hearted comedy, &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; and as a night club singer in &quot;Blues in the Night&quot;.

Frank Capra requested her for the lead opposite Cary Grant in &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;. The hit comedy film was completed in early 1942, but was not released until 1944, held up by contractual agreement not to distribute the film until the play&#x27;s long Broadway run was over. It was Priscilla&#x27;s last Warner film. Her contract was terminated by mutual agreement after five years with the studio.

She freelanced next, signing a one-picture deal with Universal Studios where she starred with Robert Cummings in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942). The director did not want either Cummings or Priscilla in the film. In Priscilla&#x27;s case, Hitchcock felt she was too much the girl next door. Universal insisted that they play the leads, and when the film was released, Priscilla&#x27;s acting was praised while some criticism was focused on Hitchcock for reworking so much from his earlier films into this wartime spy drama.

Priscilla had commitments for two more films. The first was &quot;Silver Queens&quot; for producer Harry Sherman in which she was co-starred with George Brent and played the owner of a gambling house in 1870s San Francisco. The other film was a Jack Benny comedy, &quot;The Meanest Man in the World&quot;, released in January 1943. Priscilla then retired from films. For the duration of the war, she followed her husband across America as he moved from one military base to another. She was generous with her talents and often performed at camp shows.

Leota, while married to Pitts, enlisted in the Women&#x27;s Army Corps, serving with the Air Corps, in March 1944. Her husband was an aircraft corporation executive in Los Angeles.

While living in Van Nuys, Priscilla was offered and accepted the leading role in &quot;Fun on a Weekend&quot; for producer–director Andrew Stone, co-starring Eddie Bracken. When the film was released in 1947, &quot;Variety&quot; opined, &quot;Miss Lane, who&#x27;s been absent from films for some time, gives a good enough performance which should ensure her work in more pictures.&quot; However, Priscilla returned to domestic life. Once again she and her husband moved, this time to Studio City.

In 1948, Priscilla accepted the offer of the lead role opposite Lawrence Tierney in a film noir, &quot;Bodyguard&quot;, starring as Doris Brewster. During an interview with a Hollywood correspondent, she stated, &quot;I didn&#x27;t realize how much I miss filming until I came back. I love this work, and I hope to make many, many more pictures.&quot; &quot;Bodyguard&quot; would be her last picture. An expected contract with RKO Studios did not come to pass.

In January 1951, Cora Mullican died at the San Fernando Valley home her daughters had bought for her years earlier. Priscilla returned to show business briefly in 1958 with her own show on a local television station broadcasting from Boston. Titled &quot;The Priscilla Lane Show&quot;, she chatted and interviewed celebrities visiting the area. She enjoyed the television experience, but family demands proved too much, and she gave up after a year.

<text>Beddington Zero Energy Development (BedZED) is an environmentally friendly housing development in Hackbridge, London, England. It is in the London Borough of Sutton, north-east of the town of Sutton itself. Designed to create zero carbon emissions, it was the first large scale community to do so.

==Background==
BedZED was designed by the architect Bill Dunster to be carbon neutral. The project was led by the Peabody Trust in partnership with Bill Dunster Architects, Ellis &amp; Moore Consulting Engineers, BioRegional, Arup and the cost consultants Gardiner and Theobald. The project was the first construction project where a local authority sold land at below market value to make sustainable development economically viable.

The 82 homes and of work space was built within the period of 2000–2002. The project was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize in 2003.

==Performance==
Monitoring conducted in 2003 found that BedZED had achieved these reductions in comparison to UK averages:
* Space-heating requirements were 88% less.
* Hot-water consumption was 57% less.
* The electrical power used, at 3 kilowatt hours per person per day, was 25% less than the UK average; 11% of this was produced by solar panels. The remainder normally would be produced by a combined-heat-and-power plant fuelled by wood chips, but the installation company&#x27;s financial problems have delayed use of the plant.
* Mains-water consumption has been reduced by 50%, or 67% compared to a power-shower household.
* The residents&#x27; car mileage is 65% less.

==Problems==
A review of the BedZed development in 2010 drew mainly positive conclusions. Residents and neighbours were largely happy. However, a few significant failures were highlighted, for example:
*The biomass wood chip boiler (biomass gasifier) was no longer in operation and the backup power source, a gas boiler, was used from 2005 - 2017. The downdraft wood chip gasifier CHP (combined heat and power) had reliability problems due to technical problems and the intermittent schedule of operation (no late-night operation) imposed by the local authority. However, BedZED switched from gas back to a biomass pellet boiler in 2017 which provides heat for the district heating network but not electricity, which is now sourced from the grid on a green tariff. The biomass pellets are now sourced from Spain, not from local wood waste. 
*The &#x27;Living Machine&#x27; water recycling facility had been unable to clean the water sufficiently. The cost of the facility also made it unviable.
*Passive heating from the sunspaces had been insufficient.
*Because of its location, the development requires the constant use of cars by residents. This negates its fundamental raison d&#x27;être, other than as an interesting experiment.

The results show that the average ecological footprint of a BedZED resident is 4.67 global hectares (2.6 planets), which is 89% of the baseline. This would reduce to 4.32 global hectares (2.4 planets) if the energy was all zero
carbon. However, a keen resident at BedZED (if the CHP was working) could achieve an ecological footprint of
3.0 global hectares (1.7 planets) which is 57% of the average. The target was 1 planet.

==Awards==
* 2003 – RIBA journal sustainability award – the judges said &quot;BedZED goes way beyond the standard environmental checklist by challenging both the way we live and work... Until now, pioneering communities have often been attained at the expense of architectural ambition but at BedZED the architects have been highly innovative.&quot;
* 2003 – Ashden Awards – for projects building on the experience of BedZED

<doc id="526037" wikidata="Q1204909" url="?curid=526037" title="Liangzhu culture">
<text>The Liangzhu () culture or civilization (3300–2300 BC) was the last Chinese Neolithic jade culture in the Yangtze River Delta. The culture was highly stratified, as jade, silk, ivory and lacquer artifacts were found exclusively in elite burials, while pottery was more commonly found in the burial plots of poorer individuals. This division of class indicates that the Liangzhu period was an early state, symbolized by the clear distinction drawn between social classes in funeral structures. A pan-regional urban center had emerged at the Liangzhu site in northwestern Hangzhou, Zhejiang, and elite groups from this site presided over the local centers. The Liangzhu culture was extremely influential and its sphere of influence reached as far north as Shanxi and as far south as Guangdong. The primary Liangzhu site was perhaps among the oldest Neolithic sites in East Asia that would be considered a state society. The type site at Liangzhu was discovered in Yuhang County, Zhejiang and initially excavated by Shi Xingeng in 1936. 

On 6 July 2019, the archaeological ruins of Liangzhu City was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Disappearance==
The Liangzhu culture flourished around 2500 BC, but disappeared from the Taihu Lake area after around 2300 BC. Almost no traces of the culture were found from the following years in this area.

Recent research has shown that rising waters interrupted the development of human settlements several times in this area. This led researchers to conclude the demise of the Liangzhu culture was brought about by extreme environmental changes such as floods, as the cultural layers are usually interrupted by muddy or marshy and sandy–gravelly layers with buried paleo trees. An alternative scenario proposes that extremely heavy monsoon rains during this period resulted in massive flooding which destroyed dams and the culture&#x27;s settlements. This theory was backed by a study in 2021, suggesting that a decades-long period of high precipitation (between 4345 ± 32 years and 4324 ± 30 years B.P.), probably caused by increased frequency of El Niño–Southern Oscillation conditions, coincided with the disappearance of the culture. The researchers stated that &quot;massive rainfall in the entire middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River Valley might have induced fluvial flooding and/or overbank marine flooding transported by the Yangtze River plume and thus impeded human habitation and rice farming. Massive flooding and inundation due to poor drainage in the low-lying land may have forced the Liangzhu people to abandon their capital city and dwellings in the Taihu Plain, ultimately leading to the collapse of the entire Liangzhu civilization.&quot; This may have all occurred during, or in the century leading up to the global drought that is credited with bringing down most of the first generation of human civilizations, including those in the Indus valley, Old Kingdom Egypt, and the Akkadian Empire in Sumeria.

==City-building and agriculture==

The culture possessed advanced agriculture, including irrigation, paddy rice cultivation and aquaculture. Houses were often constructed on stilts, on rivers or shorelines.

A new discovery of ancient city wall base relics was announced by the Zhejiang provincial government on November 29, 2007. It was concluded that the site was the center of the Liangzhu culture. A new Liangzhu Culture Museum was completed in 2008 and opened late in the year.

The Liangzhu Ancient City is located in a wetland environment on the plain of river networks between Daxiong Mountain and Dazhe Mountain of the Tianmu Mountain Range. This ancient city is said to be the largest city during this time period. Its interior area is 290 hectares, surrounded by clay walls which had six city gates. Two gates were located in the north, east and south walls. At its center was a palace site that spanned 30 hectares and there was also evidence of an artificial flood protection design implemented within the city. Both of these constructions are said to be indicators of the social complexity developing in Liangzhu at the time. A granary may have been in place containing up to 15,000 kg of rice grain. 

There are numerous waterway entrances both inside and outside of the city, linking it to the river networks. Inside the city were artificial earth mounds and natural hills. Outside of the walled area, remains are found for 700 hectares, the residences are said to be built in an urban planning system. 8 kilometers to the north various dam-like sites were found and are speculated to be an ancient flood protection system. Also discovered inside and outside the city are a large number of utensils for production, living, military and ritual purposes represented by numerous delicate Liangzhu jade wares of cultural profoundness; the remains including city walls, foundations of large structures, tombs, altars, residences, docks and workshops. The Liangzhu city-site is said to have been settled and developed with a specific purpose in mind since this area has very few remains that can be traced back to earlier periods. 

A typical Liangzhu community, of which there are over 300 found so far, chose to live near rivers. There have been boats and oars recovered which indicate proficiency with boats and watercraft. A Liangzhu site has provided the remains of a wooden pier and an embankment thought to have been used for protection against floods. Houses were raised on wood also to help against flooding, although houses on higher ground included semi-subterranean houses with thatched roofs. Well technology at the Miaoqian site during this period was similar to that of the earlier Hemudu period. The Liangzhu culture is said to have been more socially developed and complex than northern contemporaries in the Han Valley.

==Artifacts and technology==

The inhabitants of Liangzhu sites used artifact designs of &quot;bent knee&quot; shaped adze handles, stone untangled adzes, art styles emphasizing the use of spirals and circles, cord-marking of pottery, pottery pedestals with cut-out decorations, baked clay spindle whorls, slate reaping knives and spear points. Pottery was often decorated with a red slip. These artifacts are also common in later neolithic Southeast Asia and the technological and economic toolkits of these societies possibly developed in the neolithic Yangtze River area. Some of the Liangzhu pottery is reminiscent of the Shandong Longshan black &quot;eggshell&quot; style, however most differed and were a soft-fired gray with a black or red slip. There has also been evidence of tremolite particles being used as an ingredient for crafting some of the black &quot;eggshell&quot; pottery. It was determined that the black color of the pottery resulted from similar advancements in carburization and firing processes. Similarities between Liangchengzhen, the largest Dawenkou site, pottery making process and that of the Liangzhu were noted, which led researchers to believe there was communication between the two cultures. The Guangfulin site showed influence from more northern cultures but also had pottery practices very similar to that of the typical Liangzhu sites.

Researchers have found that some of the axes at Liangzhu sites were crafted using diamond tools. The inhabitants of Liangzhu, using these tools, worked corundum into ceremonial axes. The axes were said to &quot;have been polished to a mirrorlike luster&quot;. The techniques they used generated results that are said to be difficult to replicate even with modern technology. This is the earliest known use of diamond tools worldwide, thousands of years earlier than the gem is known to have been used elsewhere. The researchers also note that this is the only prehistoric culture known to work sapphire.

==Jade work==


The jade from this culture is characterized by finely worked large ritual jades, commonly incised with the &quot;taotie&quot; motif. The most exemplary artifacts from the culture were its &quot;cong&quot; (cylinders), with the largest discovered weighing 3.5 kg. &quot;Bi&quot; (discs) and Yue axes (ceremonial axes) were also found. Jade pendants were also found, designed with engraved representations of small birds, turtles and fish. Many Liangzhu jade artefacts had a white milky bone-like aspect due to its tremolite rock origin and influence of water-based fluids at the burial sites, although jade made from actinolite and serpentine were also commonly found. Most of Liangzhu&#x27;s contemporaries have some jades, but 90 per cent of all the &quot;cong&quot; and &quot;bi&quot; jades recovered, and by far the best in quality, are from Liangzhu sites. Jade artifacts unearthed from Liangzhu sites are said to have been influential on the development of other neolithic cultures in China: &quot;The impactful legacy of Liangzhu Culture is seen in Longshan in Shandong, Taosi in Shanxi, Qijia in Ganqing and many other sites in northern Shaanxi, where cong tubes, &quot;bi&quot; disks and other jade objects reminiscent of Liangzhu Culture have been unearthed.&quot; Liangzhu jade work is also said to have had a lasting influence on ritual objects in later periods of Chinese culture.

The Liangzhu &quot;ancient city&quot; or Liangzhu site-complex controlled the best jade products, but less important centers also produced elite crafts, which lead researchers to believe the Liangzhu culture was not a simple pyramid structure society in terms of status levels. Many minor centers had access to their own jade (nephrite). However, the Liangzhu elites at the ancient city communicated and exchanged goods with elites from other parts of the Liangzhu world (and also in other regions of Longshan-era China) and set the criteria of what jade should look like. The Liangzhu did not seem to be importers of jade, even though they did export it extensively.

==Religion==
A neolithic altar from the Liangzhu culture, excavated at Yaoshan in Zhejiang was elaborate, made of carefully positioned piles of stones and rock walls: this implies that religion was of considerable importance. The altar has three levels, the highest being a platform of rammed earth. Three additional platforms were paved with cobblestones. There are the remains of a stone wall. On the altar are twelve graves in two rows. Some scholars claim that ritual sacrifice of slaves was part of the Liangzhu tradition.

==Genetic studies==
A 2007 analysis of the DNA recovered from human remains in archeological sites of prehistoric peoples along the Yangtze River shows high frequencies of Haplogroup O1-M119 (Y-DNA) at Liangzhu culture sites of Maqiao and Xindili. This links them to modern day eastern or coastal Han Chinese and to the Austronesian and Kra–Dai peoples. 

The prevalence of O-M119 is high in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian and Guangdong. It reaches its highest prevalence in Zhejiang and Jiangsu. According to a study published by Shi Yan, et. al. in the European Journal of Human Genetics in 2011, the frequency of O-M119 reaches 22% in Eastern China. According to Sun Jin in the American Journal of Biological Anthropology, the prevalence of O-M119 reaches 24% in Jiangsu and 20% in Shanghai, and O-M119 is one of the founding paternal lineages of the Han people. 

A third of male university students in Hangzhou and Shanghai presented with the O-M119 haplotype. According to 23Mofang, Chinese geneticists have identified O-M119, in particular, the Liangzhu culture subclade Y-O1a1a1a1a1a1a (Y-F656) as the haplotype of King Gou Jian of Yue and the famous scholar Sima Guang. 

The Liangzhu culture existed in coastal areas around the mouth of the Yangtze. Haplogroup O1-M119 was absent in other Liangzhu culture sites inland. The authors of the study suggest that this may be evidence of two different human migration routes during the peopling of Eastern Asia, one coastal and the other inland, with little genetic flow between them.

<text>Cherry pit spitting is the act of spitting, or ejecting, the pit (the seed) of a cherry from one&#x27;s mouth with great speed so as to send the pit a great distance. Spitting cherry pits is an amateur sport; there are no known professional leagues of cherry spitters.

There are multiple international competitions for cherry pit spitting in countries such as the US, Canada, Germany and France. The sport can be traced back many decades.

In most competitions a contestant is given a cherry; this is done to prevent cheating or pit tampering, seen in the Witzenhausen competition in which cherry pits were tampered with. The pit is accessed by eating the cherry around it, then the cherry seed is spat. The pit of a cherry is very small, about the size of a front tooth, and is very slippery when first removed from the cherry, making it easy to spit. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the record cherry pit spitting distance is , set in 2004 by Brian &quot;Young Gun&quot; Krause.

== Notable contests ==

=== International Cherry Pit-Spitting Championship ===
The International Cherry Pit-Spitting Championship held just outside Eau Claire, Michigan, US, was founded in 1974 by Herb Teichman, the owner of the Tree-Mendus Fruit Farm to raise awareness for both his farm and the tart cherry harvest. The contest ran for 45 years from 1974 until 2019 as the farm where the contest takes place has since been sold, thus ending the Michigan competition.

Each contestant was allowed to pick three cherries and, one at a time, chew around the cherry pit. They then stood with their feet against a line and spat the cherry seed as far in front of them as they could. The contestant was given three attempts, after which the longest spit was measured. The competition had multiple categories to compete in including the adult male and female categories as well as the youth categories of youth under 5, youth 6–8 and youth 9–12 categories.

It was at this competition where Brian &quot;Young Gun&quot; Krause claimed his Guinness World Record in 2004 for the longest distance to spit a cherry pit.

=== Canadian National Pit Spit Championship ===
The Canadian National Pit Spit Championship is held annually as a part of the Blenheim Cherry Fest in Blenheim, Ontario, Canada. The competition has been a part of the festival since 1981. The contest originated at a cherry festival run by the Cedar Springs Cherry Co-operative, however in 1994 the farming town of Blenheim took over and joined with the July sidewalk sale.

=== Witzenhausen Cherry Pip Spitting Competition ===
The German town of Witzenhausen in Germany, a large producer of the countries cherries is also home to a cherry pip spit competition in their annual cherry fair. In addition to the annual competition there is a lane for cherry spitting which remains year round at Diebesturm. The Witzenhausen Cherry pit spit competition was previously involved in a scandal regarding cherry pit tampering. The head of the Witzenhausen organising committee Ulrich Walger said: &quot;After the competition we found manipulated cherry stones on the spitting range&quot;. Further inquiry revealed that a competitor has slit open the pip then inserted metal shots and covered it with a filler then varnish. The organisers were unable to identify the culprit and as a result annulled the champions.

=== Young NSW National Cherry Festival ===
The annual National Cherry festival in Young, New South Wales, Australia, features a cherry pip spitting competition, held in early December every year. Contestants are required to pick a cherry randomly from a box then spit the cherry pip as far as possible. Young is known as the cherry capital of Australia, responsible for over 60% of all Australian cherries. There is a junior and senior division, with cash prizes of $50 AUD for the junior category and $100 AUD for the senior category. The 2019 competition had close to 60 entrants participated, each contestant was given 2 pips to spit. Simon Taboury won the men&#x27;s division with a distance of , Cherie McAllister won the ladies title by spitting her pip and Ronan Winfield won the children&#x27;s category with a distance of .

=== Manjimup Cherry Spit ===
The Manjimup cherry spit competition is an annual event at the Manjimup Cherry Harmony Festival, an annual festival since 2001 in Western Australia, attracting between 7000 and 8000 people in 2017. The cherry festival is held in December and celebrates the start of the Cherry season. The cherry pip spitting contest is made of a round of heats and then finals later in the day. The event is sponsored by GlobeVista, who has previously provided the winner of the cherry pip spitting contest to New Zealand to compete for the title of Australasian Cherry Pip Spit Champion. Clinton Thompson, a Perth resident has won the competition multiple times including the 2012, 2014 and 2017 competitions. An ABC news article states that the 2014 prize was &quot;a ticket to the festival&#x27;s Long Table Lunch, $150 in cash and a ticket to New Zealand to compete in the New Zealand Cherry Pip Spitting Competition&quot;. In 2017, Manjimups victor Clayton Ellis was sponsored by GlobeVista to compete in the New Zealand Olive Stone Spitting competition, which replaced the cherry stone spitting competition after a relocation of the annual Ford Ranger New Zealand Rural Games  from &quot;the cherry capital in Central Otago to Palmerston North&quot; Ellis claimed the national record at the New Zealand Olive Stone Spitting competition with a winning distance of .

=== Western Regional Cherry Pit Spit ===
The Western Regional Cherry Pit Spit is an annual contest held at Rowley&#x27;s Red Barn in Utah, US, that has been running since 2007. The competition includes two heats, the first round is open to all and includes a male and female division as well as youth age group divisions of 5 and under, 6–8 years, 9–12 years and 13–15 years. The finals round includes the top 10 spitters from the male and female entrant and the top 5 spitters from the youth age group divisions.

=== Annakirmes (St. Anne’s Fair) ===
The Annakirmes or St Anne&#x27;s Fair is held annually in Düren Germany. The fair began in 1715 and the first world championship of cherry-pit-long-spitting at the festival occurred in 1974 on a police dogs training ground. The cherry pit spitting event celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2014 and held a special event for selected teams.

=== Céret Cherry Festival ===
The Céret Cherry Festival occurs annually in France at the end of May, including a cherry stone spitting competition as well as music, dancing and food.

== Notable contestants ==
There are many notable contestants and champions within the different competitions held around the world.

<doc id="526042" wikidata="Q15610" url="?curid=526042" title="Sedna (dwarf planet)">
<text>Sedna (minor-planet designation: 90377 Sedna) is a dwarf planet in the outermost reaches of the Solar System, orbiting the Sun far beyond the orbit of Neptune. Discovered in 2003, the frigid planetoid is one of the reddest known among Solar System bodies. Detailed spectroscopic analysis has revealed Sedna&#x27;s surface to be a mixture of the solid ices of water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and ethane (C2H6), along with occasional sedimentary deposits of methane (CH4)-derived, vividly reddish-colored organic tholins, a surface chemical makeup somewhat similar to those of other trans-Neptunian objects. Sedna has no detectable atmosphere, as its temperature is far too low for solids to volatilize. Within range of uncertainty, it is tied with the dwarf planet in the asteroid belt as the largest dwarf planet not known to have a moon. With a diameter of roughly 1,000 km, it is nearly the size of Tethys around Saturn. Owing to its lack of known moons, the Keplerian laws of planetary motion cannot be utilized for determining its mass, and the actual figure remains as yet unknown.

Sedna&#x27;s orbit is one of the widest known in the Solar System. Its aphelion, the farthest point from the Sun in its orbit, is located 937 astronomical units (AU) away. This is some 19 times that of Pluto, leading to its spending most of its time well beyond the heliopause (120 AU), the boundary beyond which the influences of particles from interstellar space dominate those from the Sun. Sedna&#x27;s orbit is also one of the most elliptical and narrow discovered, with an eccentricity of 0.8496. This implies that its perihelion, or point of closest approach to the Sun, at 76 AU is around 12.3 times as close as its aphelion. , Sedna is from the Sun, approaching perihelion at ~4.4 km/s, and 2.5 times as far away as Neptune. The dwarf planets and are presently farther away from the Sun. A transfer window for a probe fly-by in 2029 utilizing a gravitational assist from Jupiter was proposed, taking 25 years to travel to the dwarf planet, 80 AU (12 billion kilometers) distant.

Due to its exceptionally elongated orbit, the dwarf planet takes approximately 11,400 years, or over 11 millennia, to return to the same point in its orbit around the Sun. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) initially considered Sedna to be a member of the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into high-eccentricity orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune. However, several astronomers who worked in the associated field contested this classification as even its perihelion is far too distant for it to have been scattered by any of the currently known planets. This has led some astronomers to informally refer to it as the first known member of the inner Oort cloud. The dwarf planet is also the prototype of a new orbit class of objects named after itself, the sednoids, which include and Leleākūhonua, both celestial bodies with large perihelion distances and high eccentricities.

The astronomer Michael E. Brown, co-discoverer of Sedna, believes that studying Sedna&#x27;s unusual orbit could yield valuable information on the origin and early evolution of the Solar System. It might have been perturbed into its orbit by a star within the Sun&#x27;s birth cluster, or captured from a nearby wandering star, or to have been sent into its present orbit through a close gravitational encounter with the hypothetical 9th planet, sometime during the solar system&#x27;s formation. The statistically unusual clustering to one side of the solar system of the aphelions of Sedna and other similar objects is speculated to be the evidence for the existence of a planet beyond the orbit of Neptune, which would by itself orbit on the opposing side of the Sun.

== History ==

=== Discovery ===
Sedna (provisionally designated ) was discovered by Michael Brown (Caltech), Chad Trujillo (Gemini Observatory), and David Rabinowitz (Yale University) on 14 November 2003. The discovery formed part of a survey begun in 2001 with the Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego, California, using Yale&#x27;s 160-megapixel Palomar Quest camera. On that day, an object was observed to move by 4.6 arcseconds over 3.1 hours relative to stars, which indicated that its distance was about 100 AU. Follow-up observations were made in November–December 2003 with the SMARTS (Small and Medium Research Telescope System) at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, the Tenagra IV telescope in Nogales, Arizona, and the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Combined with precovery observations taken at the Samuel Oschin telescope in August 2003, and by the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking consortium in 2001–2002, these observations allowed the accurate determination of its orbit. The calculations showed that the object was moving along a distant and highly eccentric orbit, at a distance of 90.3 AU from the Sun. Precovery images have since been found in the Palomar Digitized Sky Survey dating back to 25 September 1990.

=== Naming ===
Brown initially nicknamed Sedna &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;, or &quot;Dutch&quot;, after a legendary ghost ship, because its slow movement had initially masked its presence from his team. He eventually settled on the official name after the goddess Sedna from Inuit mythology, partly because he mistakenly thought the Inuit were the closest polar culture to his home in Pasadena, and partly because the name, unlike Quaoar, would be easily pronounceable by English speakers. Brown further justified his choice of naming by stating that the goddess Sedna&#x27;s traditional location at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean reflected Sedna&#x27;s large distance from the Sun. He suggested to the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s (IAU) Minor Planet Center that any objects discovered in Sedna&#x27;s orbital region in the future should be named after mythical entities in Arctic mythologies.

The team made the name &quot;Sedna&quot; public before the object had been officially numbered, which caused some controversy among the community of amateur astronomers. Brian Marsden, the head of the Minor Planet Center, stated that such an action was a violation of protocol, and that some members of the IAU might vote against it. One amateur astronomer, Reiner Stoss, unsuccessfully attempted to name one of his asteroid discoveries &quot;Sedna&quot; (after the singer Katy Sedna) in protest of Brown&#x27;s premature naming. Despite the complaints by amateur astronomers, no objection was raised to Brown&#x27;s name by members of the IAU and no competing names were suggested for Brown&#x27;s object. The IAU&#x27;s Committee on Small Body Nomenclature accepted the name in September 2004, and considered that, in similar cases of extraordinary interest, it might in the future allow names to be announced before they were officially numbered.

Sedna has no symbol in astronomical literature, as the usage of planetary symbols is discouraged in astronomy. Unicode includes a symbol (U+2BF2), but this is mostly used among astrologers. The symbol is a monogram of &quot;Sanna&quot;, the modern pronunciation of Sedna&#x27;s name.

== Orbit and rotation ==

Sedna has the longest orbital period of any known object in the Solar System of its size or larger with an orbital period of around 11,400 years. Its orbit is extremely eccentric, with an aphelion of approximately 937 AU and a perihelion of 76.19 AU. Near aphelion, Sedna is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, located far past the termination shock, where temperatures never exceed −240°C (−400°F) due to its extreme distance. At aphelion, Sun as viewed from Sedna is a particularly bright star, among the other stars, in the otherwise black sky, being about 45% as bright as the full moon as seen from Earth. Its perihelion was the largest for any known Solar System object until the discovery of the sednoid . At its aphelion, Sedna orbits the Sun at a meagre 377 m/s, 1.3% that of Earth&#x27;s average orbital speed.

When Sedna was first discovered, it was 89.6 AU away from the Sun, approaching perihelion, and was the most distant object in the Solar System observed. Sedna was later surpassed by Eris, which was detected by the same survey near its aphelion at 97 AU. Because Sedna is near perihelion , both Eris and are farther from the Sun, at 96 AU and 89 AU respectively, than Sedna at 84 AU, despite both of their semi-major axes being shorter than Sedna&#x27;s. The orbits of some long-period comets extend further than that of Sedna; they are too dim to be discovered except when approaching perihelion in the inner Solar System. As Sedna nears its perihelion in mid-2076, the Sun will appear merely as a very bright pinpoint in its sky, the G-type star too far away to be visible as a disc to the naked eye.

When first discovered, Sedna was thought to have an unusually long rotational period (20 to 50 days). It was initially speculated that Sedna&#x27;s rotation was slowed by the gravitational pull of a large binary companion, similar to Pluto&#x27;s moon Charon. However, a search for such a satellite by the Hubble Space Telescope in March 2004 found no such objects. Subsequent measurements from the MMT telescope showed that Sedna in reality has a much shorter rotation period of about 10 hours, more typical for a body its size. It could rotate in about 18 hours instead, but this is thought to be unlikely.

== Physical characteristics ==
Sedna has a V band absolute magnitude of about 1.8, and is estimated to have an albedo (reflectivity) of around 0.41, giving it a diameter of approximately 900 km. At the time of discovery it was the brightest object found in the Solar System since Pluto in 1930. In 2004, the discoverers placed an upper limit of 1,800 km on its diameter; after observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope, this was revised downward by 2007 to less than 1,600 km. In 2012, measurements from the Herschel Space Observatory suggested that Sedna&#x27;s diameter was , which would make it smaller than Pluto&#x27;s moon Charon. In 2013, the same team re-analyzed Sedna&#x27;s thermal data with an improved thermophysical model and found a consistent value of , suggesting that the original model fit was too precise. Australian observations of a stellar occultation by Sedna in 2013 produced similar results on its diameter, giving chord lengths and . The size of this object suggests it could have undergone differentiation and may have a sub-surface liquid ocean and possibly geologic activity.

As Sedna has no known moons, the direct determination of its mass is as yet impossible without either sending a space probe or perhaps locating a nearby object which is gravitationally perturbed by the planetoid. It is the largest trans-Neptunian Sun-orbiting object not known to have a natural satellite. As of 2024, observations from the Hubble Space Telescope in 2004 have been the only published attempt to find a satellite, and it is possible that a satellite could have been lost in the glare from Sedna itself.

Observations from the SMARTS telescope show that Sedna, in visible light, is one of the reddest objects known in the Solar System, nearly as red as Mars. Its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface. Chad Trujillo and his colleagues suggest that Sedna&#x27;s dark red color is caused by an extensive surface coating of hydrocarbon sludge, termed tholins. Tholins are a reddish-colored, amorphous, and heterogeneous organic mixture hypothesized to have been transmuted from simpler organic compounds, following billions of years of continuous exposure to ultraviolet radiation, interstellar particles, and other harsh environs as the dwarf planet either comes close to the Sun or transits interstellar space. Its surface is homogeneous in color and spectrum; this may be because Sedna, unlike objects nearer the Sun, is rarely impacted by other bodies, which would expose bright patches of fresh icy material like that on 8405 Asbolus. Sedna and two other very distant objects – and – share their color with outer classical Kuiper belt objects and the centaur 5145 Pholus, suggesting a similar region of origin.

Trujillo and colleagues have placed upper limits on Sedna&#x27;s surface composition of 60% for methane ice and 70% for water ice. The presence of methane further supports the existence of tholins on Sedna&#x27;s surface, as methane is among the organic compounds capable of giving rise to tholins. Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna&#x27;s spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to methane and nitrogen ices. From these observations, they suggested the following model of the surface: 24% Triton-type tholins, 7% amorphous carbon, 10% nitrogen ices, 26% methanol, and 33% methane. The detection of methane and water ice was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared photometry. The European Southern Observatory&#x27;s Very Large Telescope observed Sedna with the SINFONI near-infrared spectrometer, finding indications of tholins and water ice on the surface.

In 2022, low-resolution near-infrared (0.7–5 μm) spectroscopic observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed the presence of significant amounts of ethane ice (C2H6) and of complex organics on the surface of Sedna. The JWST spectra also contain evidence of the existence of small amounts of ethylene (C2H4), acetylene (C2H2) and possibly carbon dioxide (CO2). On the other hand little evidence of the existence of methane (CH4) and nitrogen ices was found at variance with the earlier observations.

The possible presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests that, at least for a short time, Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere. During the 200-year portion of its orbit near perihelion, the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed , the transition temperature between alpha-phase solid N2 and the beta-phase seen on Triton. At 38 K, the N2 vapor pressure would be 14 microbar (1.4 Pa). The weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna&#x27;s surface is ancient, as opposed to being freshly deposited. This finding indicates that Sedna&#x27;s surface never reaches a temperature high enough for methane on the surface to evaporate and subsequently fall back as snow, which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto.

== Origin ==
In their paper announcing the discovery of Sedna, Brown and his colleagues described it as the first observed body belonging to the Oort cloud, the hypothetical cloud of comet-like objects thought to exist out to nearly a light-year from the Sun. They observed that, unlike scattered disc objects such as Eris, Sedna&#x27;s perihelion (76 AU) is too distant for it to have been scattered by the gravitational influence of Neptune. Because it is considerably closer to the Sun than was expected for an Oort cloud object, and has an inclination roughly in line with the planets and the Kuiper belt, they described the planetoid as being an &quot;inner Oort cloud object&quot;, situated in the disc reaching from the Kuiper belt to the spherical part of the cloud.

If Sedna formed in its current location, the Sun&#x27;s original protoplanetary disc must have extended as far as 75 AU into space. On top of that, Sedna&#x27;s initial orbit must have been approximately circular, otherwise its formation by the accretion of smaller bodies into a whole would not have been possible, because the large relative velocities between planetesimals would have been too disruptive. Therefore, it must have been tugged into its current eccentric orbit by a gravitational interaction with another body. In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested three possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt, a single passing star, or one of the young stars embedded with the Sun in the stellar cluster in which it formed.

Brown and his team favored the hypothesis that Sedna was lifted into its current orbit by a star from the Sun&#x27;s birth cluster, arguing that Sedna&#x27;s aphelion of about 1,000 AU, which is relatively close compared to those of long-period comets, is not distant enough to be affected by passing stars at their current distances from the Sun. They propose that Sedna&#x27;s orbit is best explained by the Sun having formed in an open cluster of several stars that gradually disassociated over time. That hypothesis has also been advanced by both Alessandro Morbidelli and Scott Jay Kenyon. Computer simulations by Julio A. Fernandez and Adrian Brunini suggest that multiple close passes by young stars in such a cluster would pull many objects into Sedna-like orbits. A study by Morbidelli and Levison suggested that the most likely explanation for Sedna&#x27;s orbit was that it had been perturbed by a close (approximately 800 AU) pass by another star in the first 100 million years or so of the Solar System&#x27;s existence.

The trans-Neptunian planet hypothesis has been advanced in several forms by numerous astronomers, including Rodney Gomes and Patryk Lykawka. One scenario involves perturbations of Sedna&#x27;s orbit by a hypothetical planetary-sized body in the inner Oort cloud. In 2006, simulations suggested that Sedna&#x27;s orbital traits could be explained by perturbations of a Jupiter-mass () object at 5,000 AU (or less), a Neptune-mass object at 2,000 AU, or even an Earth-mass object at 1,000 AU. Computer simulations by Patryk Lykawka have indicated that Sedna&#x27;s orbit may have been caused by a body roughly the size of Earth, ejected outward by Neptune early in the Solar System&#x27;s formation and currently in an elongated orbit between 80 and 170 AU from the Sun. Brown&#x27;s various sky surveys have not detected any Earth-sized objects out to a distance of about 100 AU. It&#x27;s a possibility that such an object may have been scattered out of the Solar System after the formation of the inner Oort cloud.

Caltech researchers Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown have hypothesized the existence of a super-Earth planet in the outer Solar System—Planet Nine—to explain the orbits of a group of extreme trans-Neptunian objects that includes Sedna. This planet would be perhaps six times as massive as Earth. It would have a highly eccentric orbit, and its average distance from the Sun would be about 15 times that of Neptune (which orbits at an average distance of ). Accordingly, its orbital period would be approximately 7,000 to 15,000 years.

Morbidelli and Kenyon have suggested that Sedna did not originate in the Solar System, but was captured by the Sun from a passing extrasolar planetary system, specifically that of a brown dwarf about 1/20th the mass of the Sun () or a main-sequence star 80 percent more massive than the Sun, which, owing to its larger mass, may now be a white dwarf. In either case, the stellar encounter had likely occurred within 100 million years after the Sun&#x27;s formation. Stellar encounters during this time would have minimal effect on the Oort cloud&#x27;s final mass and population since the Sun had excess material for replenishing the Oort cloud.

== Population ==

Sedna&#x27;s highly elliptical orbit, and thus a narrow temporal window for detection and observation with currently available technology, means that the probability of its detection was roughly 1 in 80. Unless its discovery were a fluke, it is expected that another 40–120 Sedna-sized objects with roughly the same orbital parameters would exist in the outer solar system.

In 2007, astronomer Megan Schwamb outlined how each of the proposed mechanisms for Sedna&#x27;s extreme orbit would affect the structure and dynamics of any wider population. If a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (about 80 AU). If Sedna was captured from another planetary system that rotated in the same direction as the Solar System, then all of its population would have orbits on relatively low inclinations and have semi-major axes ranging from 100 to 500 AU. If it rotated in the opposite direction, then two populations would form, one with low and one with high inclinations. The perturbations from passing stars would produce a wide variety of perihelia and inclinations, each dependent on the number and angle of such encounters.

A larger sample of objects with Sedna&#x27;s extreme perihelion may help in determining which scenario is most likely. &quot;I call Sedna a fossil record of the earliest Solar System&quot;, said Brown in 2006. &quot;Eventually, when other fossil records are found, Sedna will help tell us how the Sun formed and the number of stars that were close to the Sun when it formed.&quot; A 2007–2008 survey by Brown, Rabinowitz, and Megan Schwamb attempted to locate another member of Sedna&#x27;s hypothetical population. Although the survey was sensitive to movement out to 1,000 AU and discovered the likely dwarf planet Gonggong, it detected no new sednoid. Subsequent simulations incorporating the new data suggested about 40 Sedna-sized objects probably exist in this region, with the brightest being about Eris&#x27;s magnitude (−1.0).

In 2014, Chad Trujillo and Scott Sheppard announced the discovery of , an object half the size of Sedna, a 4,200-year orbit similar to Sedna&#x27;s, and a perihelion within Sedna&#x27;s range of roughly 80 AU; they speculated that this similarity of orbits may be due to the gravitational shepherding effect of a trans-Neptunian planet. Another high-perihelion trans-Neptunian object was announced by Sheppard and colleagues in 2018, provisionally designated and now named Leleākūhonua. With a perihelion of 65 AU and an even more distant orbit with a period of 40,000 years, its longitude of perihelion (the location where it makes its closest approach to the Sun) appears to be aligned with the directions of both Sedna and , strengthening the case for an apparent orbital clustering of trans-Neptunian objects suspected to be influenced by a hypothetical distant planet, dubbed Planet Nine. In a study detailing Sedna&#x27;s population and Leleākūhonua&#x27;s orbital dynamics, Sheppard concluded that the discovery implies a population of about 2 million inner Oort Cloud objects larger than 40 km, with a total mass in the range of (several times the mass of the asteroid belt and 80% the mass of Pluto).

Sedna was recovered from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data in 2020, as part of preliminary work for an all-sky survey searching for Planet Nine and other as-yet-unknown trans-Neptunian objects.

== Classification ==
The discovery of Sedna renewed the old question of just which astronomical objects ought to be considered planets, and which ones ought not to be. On 15 March 2004, articles on Sedna in the popular press reported misleadingly that a tenth planet had been discovered. This question was resolved for many astronomers by applying the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s definition of a planet, adopted on 24 August 2006, which mandated that a planet must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Sedna is not expected to have cleared its neighborhood; quantitatively speaking, its Stern–Levison parameter is estimated to be much less than 1. The IAU also adopted &quot;dwarf planet&quot; as a term for the largest non-planets (despite the name) that, like planets, are in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus can display planet-like geological activity, yet have not cleared their orbital neighborhoods. Sedna is bright enough, and therefore large enough, that it is expected to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. Hence, astronomers generally consider Sedna a dwarf planet.

Besides its physical classification, Sedna is also categorized according to its orbit. The Minor Planet Center, which officially catalogs the objects in the Solar System, designates Sedna only as a trans-Neptunian object (as it orbits beyond Neptune), as does the JPL Small-Body Database. The question of a more precise orbital classification has been much debated, and many astronomers have suggested that the sednoids, together with similar objects such as , be placed in a new category of distant objects named &quot;extended scattered disc objects&quot; (E-SDO), &quot;detached objects&quot;, &quot;distant detached objects&quot; (DDO), or &quot;scattered-extended&quot; in the formal classification by the Deep Ecliptic Survey.

== Exploration ==
Sedna will come to perihelion around July 2076. This close approach to the Sun provides a window of opportunity for studying it that will not occur again for more than 11 thousand years. Because Sedna spends much of its orbit beyond the heliopause, the point at which the solar wind gives way to the interstellar particle wind, examining Sedna&#x27;s surface would provide unique information on the effects of interstellar radiation, as well as the properties of the solar wind at its farthest extent. It was calculated in 2011 that a flyby mission to Sedna could take 24.48 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on launch dates of 6 May 2033 or 23 June 2046. Sedna would be either 77.27 or 76.43 AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives near the end of 2057 or 2070, respectively. Other potential flight trajectories involve gravity assists from Venus, Earth, Saturn, and Neptune as well as Jupiter. Research at the University of Tennessee has also examined the potential for a lander.

<text>Thrall-Demonsweatlive is an EP by American heavy metal band Danzig. It was released in 1993 on Def American Recordings and has been certified Gold.

==Music and recording==
The EP is split into two sections. The first section, &quot;Thrall&quot;, consists of three new studio recordings that were tracked live and completed by the band in a single day. The studio recording &quot;Trouble&quot; is a cover of the Elvis Presley song featured in the movie &quot;King Creole&quot;. Glenn Danzig had previously recorded the song with Samhain, which was later released on the box set version of their &quot;Final Descent&quot; EP.

The second section, &quot;Demonsweatlive&quot;, includes four live recordings taken from the band&#x27;s Halloween 1992 performance at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheater in California.

From the fourth pressing on, the CD releases have a hidden track featuring the remixed studio version of &quot;Mother&quot;, titled &quot;Mother &#x27;93&quot;. Symbolically, the song is hidden at track number 93, and the total length of the blank tracks leading to the song is 7 minutes and 6 seconds (6 minutes and 66 seconds).

==Artwork and packaging==
The cover artwork is by artist Simon Bisley. The EP was issued as a picture-disc CD and LP in Europe. Like Danzig&#x27;s four studio albums with the original lineup, this EP was given a Parental Advisory label despite the absence of common profanity.

==Music videos==
Music videos were released for the songs &quot;Mother &#x27;93&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Coming Down&quot;.

The &quot;Mother &#x27;93&quot; music video was a success on MTV. As a result, &quot;Mother&quot; became Danzig&#x27;s most well known song; its popularity helping both the EP and the band&#x27;s debut album to reach Gold status in 1994, and later Platinum status.

The uncensored version of the &quot;It&#x27;s Coming Down&quot; music video was banned by music channels, including MTV, due to its sexually explicit content. The music video depicts various acts of bondage, sadomasochism, and cock and ball torture. The video was directed by Jon Reiss and features an appearance by performance artist Bob Flanagan, both known for their video work with Nine Inch Nails. Eerie Von explained the concept behind the music video: &quot;It was part of mine and Glenn&#x27;s personalities, part of what we used to see when we lived in New York. The director also had some good ideas, and we let him do what he wanted. I like stuff that people think is bizarre. It was pretty heavy, but so what? Sexually, you&#x27;re either open minded or you&#x27;re not.&quot;

All music videos from the album are featured on Danzig&#x27;s &quot;Archive de la Morte&quot; DVD.

<text>Dame Ellen Patricia MacArthur (born 8 July 1976) is a retired English sailor, from Whatstandwell near Matlock in Derbyshire, now based in Cowes, Isle of Wight.

MacArthur is a successful solo long-distance yachtswoman. On 7 February 2005, she broke the world record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe, a feat which gained her international renown. Francis Joyon, the Frenchman who had held the record before MacArthur, was able to recover the record again in early 2008.

Following her retirement from professional sailing on 2 September 2010, MacArthur announced the launch of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with business and education to accelerate the transition to a circular economy.

She once held the top spot on the UK Top Gear show for fastest star in a reasonably priced car.

== Early life ==

MacArthur was born in Derbyshire where she lived with her parents, who were both teachers, and two brothers Fergus, still in Whatstandwell, and Lewis, who now lives in Pennsylvania. She acquired her early interest in sailing, firstly by her desire to emulate her idol at the time, Sophie Burke, and secondly by reading Arthur Ransome&#x27;s &quot;Swallows and Amazons series&quot; of books. She has since become the Patron of the Nancy Blackett Trust which owns and operates Ransome&#x27;s yacht, &quot;Nancy Blackett&quot;.

Her first experience of sailing was on a boat owned by her aunt Thea MacArthur on the east coast of England. She saved her school dinner money for three years to buy her first boat, an eight-foot dinghy, which she named &quot;Threp&#x27;ny Bit&quot; even though decimalisation had taken place before she was born. She sellotaped a real &#x27;threepenny bit&#x27; coin onto the bow.

MacArthur attended Wirksworth County Infants and Junior Schools and the Anthony Gell School and also worked at a sailing school in Hull. When she was 17, MacArthur bought a Corribee and named it &quot;Iduna&quot;; she described the first moment she saw it as &quot;love at first sight&quot;. In 1995 she sailed &quot;Iduna&quot; single-handed on a circumnavigation of Great Britain.

In 1997, she finished 17th in the Mini Transat solo transatlantic race after fitting out her 21 ft (6.4 m) Classe Mini yacht &quot;Le Poisson&quot; herself while living in a French boatyard.

She was named 1998 British Telecom/Royal Yachting Association &quot;Yachtsman of The Year&quot; in the UK and &quot;Sailing&#x27;s Young Hope&quot; in France.

Asteroid 20043 Ellenmacarthur is named after her.

== Professional sailing career ==
MacArthur first came to general prominence in 2001 when she finished second in the Vendée Globe solo round-the-world sailing race in her Owen Clarke/Rob Humphreys designed &quot;Kingfisher&quot; (named after her sponsors, Kingfisher plc), and subsequently MacArthur was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to sport. At 24, she was the youngest competitor to complete the voyage.

In 2003, she captained a round-the-world record attempt for a crewed yacht in Kingfisher 2 (a catamaran formerly owned by Bruno Peyron and known as &quot;Orange&quot;), but was thwarted by a broken mast in the Southern Ocean.
A trimaran named &quot;B&amp;Q/Castorama&quot; (after two companies in the Kingfisher group) unveiled in January 2004, was specially designed by Nigel Irens and Benoit Cabaret for her to break solo records. The 75-foot (23 m) trimaran was built in Australia, with many of the components specifically arranged to take into account MacArthur&#x27;s 5-foot 2 inch (1.57 m) height. 

Using the yacht, her first significant record attempt in 2004 to break the west–east transatlantic crossing time failed by around one and a quarter hours, after over seven days of sailing.

She began her attempt to break the solo record for sailing non-stop around the world on 28 November 2004. During her circumnavigation, she set records for the fastest solo voyage to the equator, past the Cape of Good Hope, past Cape Horn and back to the equator again. She crossed the finishing line near the French coast at Ushant at 22:29 UTC on 7 February 2005 beating the previous record set by French sailor Francis Joyon by 1 day, 8 hours, 35 minutes, 49 seconds. Her time of 71 days, 14 hours, 18 minutes 33 seconds is world record for the covered. This is an average speed of .

On 8 February 2005, following her return to England, it was announced that she was to be made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for services to sailing. She was the youngest person to ever receive this honour at the age of 28. Coming immediately after the event being recognised, rather than appearing in due course in the New Year&#x27;s or Birthday Honours lists, this recognition was reminiscent of accolades previously bestowed upon Francis Drake and Francis Chichester when reaching home shores after their respective circumnavigations in 1580 and 1967. MacArthur was also granted the rank of Honorary Lieutenant Commander, Royal Naval Reserve on the same day.

In recognition of her achievement she was appointed a Knight (Chevalier) of the French Legion of Honour by President Nicolas Sarkozy in March 2008. She is a fluent French speaker.

In 2007 MacArthur headed up BT Team Ellen, a three-person sailing team which includes Australian Nick Moloney and Frenchman Sébastien Josse.

In October 2009 MacArthur announced her intention to retire from competitive racing to concentrate on the subject of resource and energy use in the global economy.

== Sailing records ==
In June 2000, MacArthur sailed the monohull &quot;Kingfisher&quot; from Plymouth, UK to Newport, Rhode Island, USA in 14 days, 23 hours, 11 minutes. This is the current record for a single-handed woman monohull east-to-west passage, and also the record for a single-handed woman in any vessel.

MacArthur&#x27;s second place in the 2000–2001 edition of the Vendée Globe, with a time of 94 days, 4 hours and 25 minutes, was the world record for a single-handed, non-stop, monohull circumnavigation by a woman. The record stood for 20 years until Clarisse Crémer beat it in 2020-2021 edition of the Vendée Globe.

In June 2004, MacArthur sailed her trimaran &quot;B&amp;Q/Castorama&quot; from Ambrose Light, Lower New York Bay, USA to Lizard Point, Cornwall, UK in 7 days, 3 hours, 50 minutes. This set a new world record for a transatlantic crossing by women, beating the previous crewed record as well as the singlehanded version.

In 2005, MacArthur beat Francis Joyon&#x27;s existing world record for a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation. MacArthur in the trimaran &quot;B&amp;Q/Castorama&quot; sailed at an average speed of 15.9 knots. Her time of 71 days, 14 hours, 18 minutes 33 seconds beat Joyon&#x27;s then world record time by 1 day, 8 hours, 35 minutes and 49 seconds. She had no more than 20 minutes&#x27; sleep at a time during the voyage, having to be on constant lookout day and night. On 23 November 2007 Joyon set off in &quot;IDEC 2&quot; in an attempt to beat MacArthur&#x27;s current world record for a single handed circumnavigation. He achieved his goal in 57 days, 13 hours 34 minutes and 6 seconds. Despite Joyon&#x27;s reclamation of the record, Robin Knox-Johnston still described MacArthur&#x27;s time as an &quot;amazing achievement&quot;.

Her boat, now named USE IT AGAIN is skippered by French professional sailor, Romain Pilliard.

== Popular culture ==
In 2009 MacArthur appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Her chosen book was &quot;The SAS Survival Handbook&quot; by John &quot;Lofty&quot; Wiseman and her luxury item was a fluffy worm mascot.

MacArthur was also the last record holder on Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; television driving programme until the eighth series, when the car and rules were changed, and previous records were removed. The competition was a timed lap of a racetrack in a Suzuki Liana. She completed the lap in 1 minute 46.7 seconds, beating Jimmy Carr by 0.2 seconds. MacArthur won &quot;Top Gear&quot;&#x27;s Fastest Driver of the Year award in 2005.

She also took part in 2011 TV series &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Dream School&quot;.

There is a display about MacArthur at the Wirksworth Heritage Centre, Derbyshire.

==Books==
In 2002, MacArthur released her first autobiography entitled &quot;Taking on the World&quot;. Later she wrote &quot;Race Against Time&quot;, published in 2005, a day-by-day account of her record journey around the world. In September 2010, she published a second autobiography entitled &quot;Full Circle&quot;.

==Charities==

===Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust===

In 2003, MacArthur set up the Ellen MacArthur Trust (now the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust), a registered charity, to 8 to 24 year olds sailing to help them regain their confidence whilst recovering from cancer, leukaemia and other serious illnesses.

In 2008 MacArthur joined other sports celebrities to raise £4 million for the Rainbows children&#x27;s hospice. The aim is to give terminally ill young people their own customised sleeping unit to enable children in separate age groups to have their families stay with them.

===Ellen MacArthur Foundation===
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) is a UK registered charity which promotes the idea of a circular economy. It does this by developing and promoting the concept of a circular economy, working with business, policy makers and academics.

Founded on 23 June 2009, the foundation was publicly launched on 2 September 2010 by MacArthur at the Science Museum. The charity was inspired by MacArthur&#x27;s sailing experiences.

On 17 May 2017, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and Prince of Wales&#x27; International Sustainability Unit launched a US$2 million prize fund for innovations which work towards the management of waste plastics.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is a founding member and partner of the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE), which was launched out of the World Economic Forum.

<doc id="526052" wikidata="Q756135" url="?curid=526052" title="Sabbath Bloody Sabbath">
<text>Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is the fifth studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath, released in November 1973. It was produced by the band and recorded at Morgan Studios in London in September 1973. The writing process for the album, which began in Los Angeles, California, was initially hampered in part by the band&#x27;s substance abuse and fatigue following their 1972–1973 world tour in support of their previous album, &quot;Vol. 4&quot;. The band then relocated to Clearwell Castle in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England, where guitarist Tony Iommi conceived the main riff of what became the album&#x27;s title track and lead single.
==Recording==

Following Black Sabbath&#x27;s 1972–1973 world tour in support of their album, &quot;Vol. 4&quot;, the group returned to Los Angeles to begin work on its successor. Pleased with &quot;Vol. 4&quot;, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and returned to the Record Plant Studios. The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973 but, due in part to substance abuse and fatigue, were unable to complete any songs. &quot;Ideas weren&#x27;t coming out the way they were on &quot;Vol. 4&quot; and we really got discontent,&quot; said guitarist and songwriter Tony Iommi. &quot;Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn&#x27;t think of anything. And if I didn&#x27;t come up with anything, nobody would do anything.&quot; In 2013, bassist Geezer Butler told &quot;Mojo magazine&quot; that after the tour in support of &quot;Vol. 4&quot; the band was &quot;absolutely, completely exhausted&quot; and by the time they played the Hollywood Bowl, &quot;Tony collapsed. It was really touch-and-go at one point whether he&#x27;d survive or not because he was totally depleted. So we had to cancel the rest of the tour and we actually took time off for the first time since the band started. We got away from each other and had a social life. Then we came back together to start on the next album, and couldn&#x27;t come up with anything.&quot; In his autobiography &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;, singer Ozzy Osbourne states that in the time leading up to the Hollywood Bowl &quot;Tony had been doing coke literally for days – we all had, but Tony had gone over the edge. I mean, that stuff just twists your whole idea of reality. You start seeing things that aren&#x27;t there. And Tony was &quot;gone&quot;. Near the end of the gig he walked off stage and collapsed.&quot; Regarding his writer&#x27;s block, Iommi admitted to Phil Alexander in 2013, &quot;I panicked because I didn&#x27;t have a single idea about what to write. It might have been the drugs, it could have been the pressure, but either way I felt it was my fault.&quot; The band were also disappointed to discover that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant had been replaced with a &quot;giant synthesizer&quot; by Stevie Wonder, who had recently recorded there.

After a month in Los Angeles with no results, the band opted to return to the UK, where they rented Clearwell Castle in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England, in which the likes of Led Zeppelin, Mott the Hoople and Deep Purple wrote and recorded. The medieval surroundings may have revitalised the band musically, but also left a sinister impression; in the liner notes to the 1998 live album &quot;Reunion&quot;, Iommi recalls, &quot;We rehearsed in the armoury there and one night I was walking down the corridor with Ozzy and we saw this figure in a black cloak ... We followed this figure back into the armoury and there was absolutely no one there. Whoever it was had disappeared into thin air! The people that owned the castle knew all about this ghost and they said, &#x27;Oh yes, that&#x27;s the ghost of so and so. We were like &#x27;What!?&#x27;&quot; Adds Butler, &quot;We rehearsed in the dungeons and it was really creepy but it had some atmosphere, it conjured up things, and stuff started coming out again&quot;. While working in the dungeon, Iommi stumbled onto the main riff of &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;, which set the tone for the new material. In 2001 Butler admitted to Dan Epstein of &quot;Guitar World&quot;, &quot;We almost thought that we were finished as a band ... Once Tony came out with the initial riff for &#x27;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&#x27; we went &#x27;We&#x27;re baaaack!&#x27;&quot; The spooky atmosphere at Clearwell Castle perfectly complemented the band&#x27;s practice of playing practical jokes on one another. In the documentary &quot;Black Sabbath, Volume 1: 1970–1978&quot; Iommi recalls, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to be honest, we frightened the life out of each other. We had to leave in the end, everybody terrified of each other because we were playing jokes on each other and nobody knew who was doing it... We used to leave and drive all the way home and drive back the next day. It was really silly.&quot; In his autobiography Osbourne cracks, &quot;We weren&#x27;t so much the Lords of Darkness as the Lords of Chickenshit when it came to that kind of thing ... We wound each other up so much none of us got any sleep. You&#x27;d just lie there with your eyes wide open, expecting an empty suit of armour to walk into your bedroom at any second to shove a dagger up your arse.&quot; Osbourne also writes that he nearly burnt the castle down one night when he fell asleep with his boot in the fire. Osbourne said that when it came to the shenanigans Bill Ward typically &quot;got the worst of it&quot;, with the drummer eventually going to bed at night with a dagger.

Although the band&#x27;s then-manager Patrick Meehan received credit as co-producer, Iommi said years later that Meehan had virtually no actual involvement in the album&#x27;s production, saying &quot;Meehan&#x27;s ego got involved, and he stuck his name down as producer&quot;. Recording was completed at Morgan Studios in Willesden, North London in 1973. Keyboardist Rick Wakeman of the band Yes (who were recording &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; in the next studio) was brought in as a session player, appearing on &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot;. Wakeman refused payment from the band and was ultimately compensated with beer for his contribution. The members of Led Zeppelin, close friends of the band from their early days in Birmingham, showed up at the studio during &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;&#x27;s recording. Drummer John Bonham was eager to play on &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot;, but Sabbath preferred to play material other than their own for the occasion. In the end, the two bands had an improvised jam session which was recorded but never released.

Osbourne has said that &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; was &quot;the beginning of the end&quot; for Black Sabbath&#x27;s original line-up. In 2013, the singer elaborated to &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;&quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; was really the album after which I should have said goodbye because after that I really started unravelling. Then we ended up falling out of favour with each other.&quot; Fuelled by rampant drug and alcohol use within the band, tensions began to mount. Iommi began to resent doing most of the songwriting and studio work, thus having no social life. Bassist Butler also began complaining that vocalist Osbourne had become too reliant on him for lyrics.

==Composition==

Building on the stylistic changes introduced on &quot;Vol. 4&quot;, new songs incorporated synthesizers, strings, keyboards and more complex arrangements. Iommi experimented with sitar and bagpipes in the studio but was not able to master the instruments to his satisfaction.
The lyrics also delved into new areas, with &quot;Mojo&quot; opining in 2013, &quot;The title track led into an expansive set as Butler&#x27;s lyrics contemplated the mysteries of birth and DNA in &#x27;A National Acrobat&#x27; and &quot;Spiral Architect&#x27;, respectively.&quot; &quot;&#x27;A National Acrobat&#x27; was just me thinking about who selects what sperm gets through to the egg&quot;, Butler explained in the liner notes to &quot;Reunion&quot; in 1998. &quot;&#x27;Spiral Architect&#x27; was about life&#x27;s experiences being added to a person&#x27;s DNA to create a unique individual. I used to get very contemplative on certain substances. I still do, but without those substances.&quot; In his autobiography &quot;Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven &amp; Hell with Black Sabbath&quot;, Iommi reveals that the initial riff for &quot;A National Acrobat&quot; was written by Butler, to which the guitarist &quot;added bits to it. Geezer can write some great stuff.&quot; According to the book &quot;How Black Was Our Sabbath&quot;, the band invited an orchestra to play on &#x27;Spiral Architect&#x27; &quot;but couldn&#x27;t cram all of the musicians and their instruments into Morgan Studios. They ended up at the nearby Pye Studio along the road, with Ozzy trying to explain what he wanted them to play like some sort of mad conductor. He had no written music to give the orchestra, he just hummed the part and they picked it up.&quot;

Osbourne purchased a Moog synthesizer; though he &quot;didn&#x27;t know how to use it&quot; according to Iommi, he was still able to compose the song &quot;Who Are You?&quot; with it. In his memoir Osbourne states, &quot;I&#x27;d written it one night at Bulrush Cottage while I was loaded and fiddling around with a Revox tape machine and my ARP 2600.&quot; The singer also writes that &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; was &quot;Our last truly great album, I think... And with the music we&#x27;d managed to strike just the right balance between our old heaviness and our new, &#x27;experimental&#x27; side.&quot; &quot;Killing Yourself to Live&quot; was a Butler composition written while he was in hospital for kidney problems caused by heavy drinking. Ward was also drinking heavily, and the song reflects the problems caused by their &quot;extreme&quot; lifestyles. An early incarnation of the song can be heard on the live albums &quot;Live at Last&quot; and &quot;Past Lives&quot;. The instrumental &quot;Fluff&quot; was composed by Iommi and named after BBC radio disc jockey Alan &quot;Fluff&quot; Freeman. Freeman was one of the few radio personalities in Britain to play Sabbath&#x27;s music on-air.

==Artwork==
Illustrator Drew Struzan created coloured pencil drawings for both the front and back album sleeves. The front, drawn primarily in red tones, depicts a nude man on an elaborate California king satanic bed with a large “666” on the headboard tormented by nude male and female demons and rats. The back shows a more peaceful scene, rendered mostly in blue, with a dying man surrounded by grieving loved ones and sleeping lions.

The Vertigo LP featured a gatefold cover, with the interior showing a color photograph of translucent members of the band standing in a furnished bedroom.

==Release and reception==
Black Sabbath released &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; in late November 1973. For the first time in their career, the band began to receive favourable reviews in the mainstream press, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calling the album &quot;an extraordinarily gripping affair&quot;, and &quot;nothing less than a complete success&quot;. Later reviewers such as AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia cite the album as &quot;a masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection&quot;, while also displaying &quot;a newfound sense of finesse and maturity&quot;. The album marked the band&#x27;s fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the United States. It reached number four on the UK charts, and number eleven in the US. In the UK, it was the first Black Sabbath album to attain Silver certification (60,000 units sold) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in February 1975. The album would go on to be regarded in high esteem by the band members themselves; when asked by &quot;Guitar for the Practicing Musician&quot; in 1994 which songs he would like to see on the upcoming Black Sabbath box set, Butler replied, &quot;Probably anything off of &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;. The song &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; itself. It was a whole new era for us. We felt really open on that album. It was a great atmosphere, good time, great coke! Just like a new birth for me. We had done the first four albums and done it that way. &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; was like Part Two of your life. It was a weird feeling; a good feeling.&quot; In his memoir, Iommi calls the album &quot;the pinnacle&quot;.

The song &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; has been singled out for praise by many hard rock and heavy metal guitar players, with Slash from Guns N&#x27; Roses stating to &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 2008, &quot;The outro to &#x27;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&#x27; is the heaviest shit I have ever heard in my life. To this day, I haven&#x27;t heard anything as heavy that has as much soul.&quot; Brent Hinds of Mastodon agrees, telling Nick Bowcott in 2008, &quot;The &#x27;dreams turn to nightmares, Heaven turns to Hell&#x27; riff at the end of that song is unbeatable.&quot; Kirk Hammett of Metallica cites &quot;Killing Yourself to Live&quot; as his favourite Black Sabbath song, revealing in the Holiday 2008 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot; that &quot;A lot of people gravitate toward the album&#x27;s title track, &#x27;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&#x27;, but for me this is the stand out cut on the album.&quot; Metallica would later cover &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot; on their 1998 covers album &quot;Garage Inc.&quot;
Dave Williams of Drowning Pool stated that he would want the album with him if he were stranded on a desert island.

<text>Reporters Without Borders (RWB; ; RSF) is an international non-profit and non-governmental organization headquartered in Paris, which focuses on safeguarding the right to freedom of information. It describes its advocacy as founded on the belief that everyone requires access to the news and information, in line with Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that recognises the right to receive and share information regardless of frontiers, along with other international rights charters. RSF has consultative status at the United Nations, UNESCO, the Council of Europe, and the International Organisation of the Francophonie.

== Activities ==
RSF works on the ground in defence of individual journalists at risk and at the highest levels of government and international forums to defend the right to freedom of expression and information. It provides daily briefings and press releases on threats to media freedom in French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Persian and Chinese and publishes an annual press freedom round up, the World Press Freedom Index, that measures the state of media freedom in 180 countries. The organisation provides assistance to journalists at risk and training in digital and physical security, as well as campaigning to raise public awareness of abuse against journalists and to secure their safety and liberty. RSF lobbies governments and international bodies to adopt standards and legislation in support of media freedom and takes legal action in defence of journalists under threat. In addition, RSF keeps a yearly count of journalists killed on the job.

To mark World Day Against Cyber Censorship on 12 March 2020, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) unveiled a list of 20 Digital Predators of Press Freedom and announced that it is unblocking access to a total 21 websites in the sixth year of its Operation Collateral Freedom.

==History==
RSF was founded in Montpellier, France, in 1985 by Robert Ménard, Rémy Loury, Jacques Molénat and Émilien Jubineau. It was registered as a non-profit organisation in 1995. Ménard was RSF&#x27;s first secretary general, succeeded by . Christophe Deloire was appointed secretary-general in 2012, and remained so until his death in June 2024. Thibaut Bruttin is the current secretary-general, appointed in November 2024.

== Structure ==
RSF&#x27;s head office is based in Paris. It has 13 regional and national offices, including Brussels, London, Washington, Berlin, Rio de Janeiro, Taipei and Dakar, and a network of 146 correspondents. It employs 57 salaried staff in Paris and internationally. A board of governors, elected from RSF&#x27;s members, approves the organisation&#x27;s policies. An International Council has oversight of the organisation&#x27;s activities and approves the accounts and budget.

==Advocacy==
===World Press Freedom Index===


=== Information and Democracy Initiative ===
In 2018, RSF launched the Information and Democracy Commission to introduce new guarantees for freedom of opinion and expression in the global space of information and communication. In a joint mission statement, the commission&#x27;s presidents, RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire and Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi identified a range of factors currently threatening that freedom. This includes: political control of the media, subjugation of news and information to private interests, the growing influence of corporate actors, online mass disinformation and the erosion of quality journalism.

This Commission published the International Declaration on Information and Democracy to state principles, define objectives and propose forms of governance for the global online space for information and communication. The Declaration emphasised that corporate entities with a structural function in the global space have duties, especially as regards political and ideological neutrality, pluralism and accountability. It called for recognition of the right to information that is diverse, independent and reliable in order to form opinions freely and participate fully in the democratic debate.

At the Paris Peace Forum in 2018, 12 countries launched a political process aimed at providing democratic guarantees for news and information and freedom of opinion, based on the principles set out in the Declaration.

=== Journalism Trust Initiative ===
RSF launched the Journalism Trust Initiative (JTI) in 2018 with its partners the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), Agence France Presse (AFP) and the Global Editors Network (GEN). JTI defines indicators for trustworthy journalism and rewards compliance, bringing tangible benefits for all media outlets and supporting them in creating a healthy space for information. JTI distinguishes itself from similar initiatives by focusing on the process of journalism rather than content alone. Media outlets will be expected to comply with standards that include transparency of ownership, sources of revenue and proof of a range of professional safeguards.

=== Actions ===
RSF&#x27;s defence of journalistic freedom includes international missions, the publication of country reports, training of journalists and public protests.

In this function RSF publishes the Munich Charter, an authoritative document which clarifies the &quot;Rights and Obligations&quot; of Journalists. The Munich Charter (fr. Charte de Munich) was developed by the German Journalist Association (de. Deutscher Journalisten-Verband), published in Munich 1971, and is accepted as authoritative within the profession. It was later adopted by most journalists&#x27; unions in Europe.

Recent global advocacy and practical interventions have included: opening a centre for women journalists in Afghanistan in 2017, a creative protest with street-artist C215 in Strasbourg for Turkish journalists in detention, turning off the Eiffel Tower lights in tribute to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Kashoggi and providing training to journalists and bloggers in Syria. In July 2018, RSF sent a mission to Saudi Arabia to call for the release of 30 journalists. The organisation publishes a gallery of Predators of Press Freedom, highlighting the most egregious international violators of press freedom. It also maintains an online Press Freedom Barometer, monitoring the number of journalists, media workers and citizen journalists killed or imprisoned. Its programme Operation Collateral Freedom, launched in 2014, provides alternative access to censored websites by creating mirror sites: 22 sites have been unblocked in 12 countries, including Iran, China, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. RSF offers grants to journalists at risk and supports media workers in need of refuge and protection.

=== Prizes ===
RSF&#x27;s annual Press Freedom Prize, created in 1992, honours courageous and independent journalists who have faced threats or imprisonment for their work and who have challenged the abuse of power. TV5-Monde is a partner in the prize.

A Netizen Prize was introduced in 2010, in partnership with Google, recognising individuals, including bloggers and cyber-dissidents, who have advanced freedom of information online through investigative reporting or other initiatives.

In 2018, RSF launched new categories for the Press Freedom Prize: courage, independence and impact.

Every few years, RSF also distributes Press freedom predator anti-awards.

=== Statements ===
On 22 February 2020, RSF issued a statement condemning the IRGC&#x27;s call for journalists to be detained in Iran. IRGC intelligence has summoned some journalists and banned any media activities. Reporters Without Borders described the IRGC&#x27;s intelligence action as &quot;arbitrary and illegal&quot; and aimed at &quot;preventing journalists from being informed on social media.&quot;

Following the outbreak of the Coronavirus in Iran, RSF issued a statement on 6 March expressing concern over the health of imprisoned journalists.

On 16 April 2020, RSF wrote to two United Nations special rapporteurs on Freedom of Expression and Health, urging the United Nations to issue serious warnings to governments that restrict freedom of expression in the context of the coronavirus epidemic. The letter, signed by RSF Director Christian Mihr, stated: &quot;Freedom of the press and access to information are more important than ever at the time of Corona&#x27;s pandemic.&quot;

On 21 April 2020, the RSF based in Paris said that the pandemic had amplified and highlighted many crises and over shadowed freedom of the press. The high representative of the EU, Josep Borrell, stated that the pandemic should not be used to justify the limitation of democratic and civil freedoms and that the rule of law and international commitments should be respected. He said freedom of speech and access to information should not be limited and that measures taken against the pandemic should not be used to restrict human rights advocates, reporters, media staff and institutions of civil societies.

On 25 June 2020, RSF issued a statement entitled &quot;Enforced online repentance, Iran&#x27;s new method of repression&quot;. According to the report, the Revolutionary Guards summoned a number of journalists, writers and human rights activists and threatened to detain them, forcing them to express their regrets or apologies for publishing their comments in cyberspace in order to silence them.

On 25 June 2020, Reporters Without Borders issued a statement entitled &quot;Online Repentance, a New Method of Repression in the Islamic Republic of Iran.&quot; According to the report, the Revolutionary Guards summoned and threatened to detain a number of journalists, writers, and human rights activists, forcing them to express regret or apology for posting their views online to silence them. The organisation condemned the pressure, threats and silence of social activists.

== Funding ==
RSF&#x27;s budget for 2022 totalled €8m. 52% of the organisation&#x27;s income comes from the state sector; 22% from foundations; 12% from commercial activities; 11% from sponsorships and public donations. Foundations supporting RSF&#x27;s work through services include the American Express, the Société Générale, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, and Ford Foundation.

In 2005 RSF was reported by &quot;The Guardian&quot; to have been criticised by left-wing writer Diana Barahona for accepting funding from the National Endowment for Democracy in the US and the Center for a Free Cuba. She accused RSF of being part of “a neocon crusade” against Fidel Castro&#x27;s Government of Cuba. In response, Secretary-general Robert Ménard stated that funding from NED totalled 0.92 per cent of RSF&#x27;s budget and was used to support African journalists and their families. RSF ceased its relationship with the Center for a Free Cuba in 2008.

<text>The 1995 Rugby World Cup (), was the third Rugby World Cup. It was hosted and won by South Africa, and was the first Rugby World Cup in which every match was held in one country.

The World Cup was the first major sporting event to take place in South Africa following the end of apartheid. It was also the first World Cup in which South Africa was allowed to compete; the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB, now World Rugby) had only readmitted South Africa to international rugby in 1992, following negotiations to end apartheid. The World Cup was also the last major event of rugby union&#x27;s amateur era; two months after the tournament, the IRFB opened the sport to professionalism.

In the final, held at Ellis Park in Johannesburg on 24 June, South Africa defeated New Zealand 15–12, with Joel Stransky scoring a drop goal in extra time to win the match. Following South Africa&#x27;s victory, Nelson Mandela, the President of South Africa, wearing a Springboks rugby shirt and cap, presented the Webb Ellis Cup to the South African captain François Pienaar.

==Qualifying==

The eight quarter-finalists from the 1991 Rugby World Cup all received automatic entry, as did South Africa, as hosts. The remaining seven of the 16 positions available in the tournament were filled by regional qualifiers. The qualifying tournaments were broken up into regional associations: Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire qualified through Africa, Japan through Asia, Argentina through the Americas, Italy, Romania and Wales through Europe, Tonga through Oceania.

==Squads==
==Referees==
==Venues==
The 1995 tournament was the first Rugby World Cup to be hosted by just one country, and thus, all the venues are within the one country. South Africa were given the rights to host the tournament in 1993, after a meeting between the IRB and both the government led by F. W. de Klerk and the African National Congress. In total, nine stadiums were used for the World Cup, most being owned by local municipalities, and the majority of the venues were upgraded prior to the tournament. Six of the nine stadiums were South African Test grounds. The four largest stadiums were used for the finals, with the final taking place at Johannesburg&#x27;s Ellis Park.

There were games originally scheduled to have been played in Brakpan, Germiston, Pietermaritzburg and Witbank, but these games were reallocated to other venues. This reduced the number of venues from 14 to 9. The reasons cited for this change had to do with facilities for both the press and spectators, as well as the security. The change in the itinerary occurred in January 1994. Further changes occurred in April, so that evening games were played at stadiums with good floodlighting. It is also thought that Potchefstroom was an original venue.

Venues were paired:
* Pool 1: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Stellenbosch
* Pool 2: Durban and East London
* Pool 3: Johannesburg and Bloemfontein
* Pool 4: Pretoria and Rustenburg


==Pools &amp; format==
The tournament was contested by 16 nations using the same format that was used in 1987 and 1991 and in total 32 matches were played. The competition began on 25 May, when the hosts South Africa defeated Australia 27–18 at Newlands in Cape Town. The tournament culminated with the final between South Africa and the All Blacks at Ellis Park in Johannesburg on 24 June. In total, the tournament ran for thirty days. The nations were broken up into four pools of four, with each pool consisting of two teams that were automatically qualified and two that went through the qualifying tournaments.

===Points system===

The points system that was used in the pool stage was unchanged from 1991:
*3 points for a win
*2 points for a draw
*1 point for playing

===Knockout stage===

Pool winners were drawn against opposite pool runners-up in the quarter-finals. For example, the winner of A faces the runner up of B, and the winner of B face the runner-up of A. The whole finals stage adopts a knock-out format, and the winners of the quarter-finals advance to the semi-finals, where winner 1 faces winner 2, and winner 3 faces winner 4. The winners advance to the final, and the losers contest a third/fourth place play-off two days before the final.

A total of 32 matches (24 pool stage &amp; 8 knock-out) were played throughout the tournament over 30 days from 25 May to 24 June 1995.

==Final==

The final was contested by New Zealand and hosts South Africa. Both nations finished undefeated at the top of their pools. South Africa defeated Western Samoa in the quarter-finals, and then France in the semi-finals to reach the final; New Zealand defeated Scotland in the quarter-finals, and England in the semi-finals, a game in which Jonah Lomu famously scored four tries for the All Blacks. The final was played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg and refereed by Ed Morrison of England. To this point, New Zealand had led the tournament in production, outscoring their opponents 315–104, while South Africa had outscored their opponents 129–55. The tight Springbok defence would keep the high scoring All Blacks in check – particularly Jonah Lomu and Marc Ellis, who had already scored a then World Cup record seven tries each in the tournament – with neither team scoring a try in the match.

South Africa led 9–6 at half time, and New Zealand levelled the scores at 9–9 with a drop goal in the second half. Though Andrew Mehrtens almost kicked a late drop goal for the All Blacks, the score remained tied at full-time, forcing the game into extra time. Both teams scored penalty goals in the first half of extra time, but Joel Stransky then scored a drop goal to win the final for South Africa.

What happened after the match has become an iconic moment in the history of the sport. Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok rugby jersey and cap, presented the Webb Ellis Cup to South African captain François Pienaar to the delight of the capacity crowd. The moment is thought by some to be one of the most famous finals of any sport.

==Statistics==
The tournament&#x27;s top point scorer was France&#x27;s Thierry Lacroix, who scored 112 points. Marc Ellis and Jonah Lomu, both of New Zealand, scored the most tries, with seven each.

==Broadcasters==
The event was broadcast in Australia by Network Ten and in the United Kingdom by ITV.

==Commemorative coins==
The South African Mint issued a one-ounce gold proof &quot;Protea&quot; coin with a total mintage of 406 pieces to commemorate the event being hosted by South Africa.

==Popular culture==
Mandela and Pienaar&#x27;s involvement in the World Cup is the subject of the John Carlin book &quot;Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation&quot;, its 2009 film adaptation &quot;Invictus&quot;, and the ESPN TV documentary &quot;The 16th Man&quot; in 2010.

<doc id="526058" wikidata="Q639274" url="?curid=526058" title="G. A. Henty">
<text>George Alfred Henty (8 December 1832 – 16 November 1902) was an English novelist and war correspondent. He is best known for his works of adventure fiction and historical fiction, including &quot;The Dragon &amp; The Raven&quot; (1886), &quot;For The Temple&quot; (1888), &quot;Under Drake&#x27;s Flag&quot; (1883) and &quot;In Freedom&#x27;s Cause&quot; (1885).

==Biography==

G. A. Henty was born in Trumpington, near Cambridge but spent some of his childhood in Canterbury. He was a sickly child who had to spend long periods in bed. During his frequent illnesses he became an avid reader and developed a wide range of interests which he carried into adulthood. He attended Westminster School, London, as a half-boarder when he was fourteen, and later Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was a keen sportsman. 

He left the university early without completing his degree to volunteer for the (Army) Hospital Commissariat of the Purveyors Department when the Crimean War began. He was sent to the Crimea and while there he witnessed the appalling conditions under which the British soldier had to fight. His letters home were filled with vivid descriptions of what he saw. His father was impressed by his letters and sent them to the &quot;Morning Advertiser&quot; newspaper which printed them. This initial writing success was a factor in Henty&#x27;s later decision to accept the offer to become a special correspondent, the early name for journalists now better known as war correspondents.

Shortly before resigning from the army as a captain in 1859 he married Elizabeth Finucane. The couple had four children. Elizabeth died in 1865 after a long illness and shortly after her death Henty began writing articles for the &quot;Standard&quot; newspaper. In 1866 the newspaper sent him as their special correspondent to report on the Austro-Italian War where he met Giuseppe Garibaldi. He went on to cover the 1868 British punitive expedition to Abyssinia, the Franco-Prussian War, the Ashanti War, the Carlist Rebellion in Spain and the Turco-Serbian War. He also witnessed the opening of the Suez Canal and travelled to Palestine, Russia and India.

Henty was a strong supporter of the British Empire all his life; according to literary critic Kathryn Castle: &quot;Henty ... exemplified the ethos of the [British Empire], and glorified in its successes&quot;. Henty&#x27;s ideas about politics were influenced by writers such as Sir Charles Dilke and Thomas Carlyle.

Henty once related in an interview how his storytelling skills grew out of tales told after dinner to his children. He wrote his first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Out on the Pampas&quot; in 1868, naming the book&#x27;s main characters after his children. The book was published by Griffith and Farran in November 1870 with a title page date of 1871. While most of the 122 books he wrote were for children and published by Blackie and Son of London, he also wrote adult novels, non-fiction such as &quot;The March to Magdala&quot; and &quot;Those Other Animals&quot;, short stories for the likes of &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Own Paper&quot; and edited the &quot;Union Jack&quot;, a weekly boy&#x27;s magazine.

Henty was &quot;the most popular Boy&#x27;s author of his day.&quot; Blackie, who published his children&#x27;s fiction in the UK, and W. G. Blackie estimated in February 1952 that they were producing about 150,000 Henty books a year at the height of his popularity, and stated that their records showed they had produced over three and a half million Henty books. He further estimated that considering the US and other overseas authorised and pirated editions, a total of 25 million was not impossible. Arnold notes this estimate and that there have been further editions since that estimate was made.

His children&#x27;s novels typically revolved around a boy or young man living in troubled times. These ranged from the Punic War to more recent conflicts such as the Napoleonic Wars or the American Civil War. Henty&#x27;s heroes – which occasionally included young ladies – are uniformly intelligent, courageous, honest and resourceful with plenty of &#x27;pluck&#x27; yet are also modest. These themes have made Henty&#x27;s novels popular today among many conservative Christians and homeschoolers.
Henty usually researched his novels by ordering several books on the subject he was writing on from libraries, and consulting them before beginning writing. Some of his books were written about events (such as the Crimean War) that he witnessed himself; hence, these books are written with greater detail as Henty drew upon his first-hand experiences of people, places, and events.

On 16 November 1902, Henty died aboard his yacht in Weymouth Harbour, Dorset, leaving unfinished his last novel, &quot;By Conduct and Courage&quot;, which was completed by his son Captain C.G. Henty.

Henty is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

==Influence==
G. A. Henty&#x27;s commercial popularity encouraged other writers to try writing juvenile adventure stories in his style; &quot;Herbert Strang&quot;, Henry Everett McNeil, Percy F. Westerman and Captain Frederick Sadleir Brereton all wrote novels in &quot;the Henty tradition&quot;, often incorporating then-contemporary themes such as aviation and First World War combat. By the 1930s, however, interest in Henty&#x27;s work was declining in Britain, and hence few children&#x27;s writers there looked to his work as a model.

==Bibliography==
Henty wrote 122 works of historical fiction and all first editions had the date printed at the foot of the title page. Several short stories published in book form are included in this total, with the stories taken from previously published full-length novels. The dates given below are those printed at the foot of the title page of the very first editions in the United Kingdom. It is a common misconception that American Henty titles were published before those of the UK. All Henty titles bar one were published in the UK before those of America. 

The simple explanation for this error of judgement is that Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons of New York dated their Henty first editions for the current year. The first UK editions published by Blackie were always dated for the coming year, to have them looking fresh for Christmas. The only Henty title published in book form in America before the UK book was &quot;In the Hands of the Cave-Dwellers&quot; dated 1900 and published by Harper of New York. This title was published in book form in the UK in 1903, although the story itself had already been published in England prior to the first American edition, in &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Own Annual&quot;.

===Misattribution===
A book published in 1884 in the &quot;Fireside Henty Series&quot; called &quot;Forest and Frontier&quot; was discovered to be by Thomas M. Newson.

===UK and US availability===
In the late 1990s, a number of American publishers, such as Polyglot Press (Philadelphia, PA), PrestonSpeed, and the Lost Classics Book Company, began reprinting Henty&#x27;s books and advocating their usage for conservative homeschoolers. Reprints of all Henty&#x27;s works are available from modern day British and American publishers. One such publisher and major modern advocate of Henty is the American scientist (biochemist), homeschool curriculum publisher, and Oregon State Senator Arthur B. Robinson, who promotes the use of Henty&#x27;s books as a supplement to his self-teaching homeschool curriculum.

==Controversial views==
Henty&#x27;s views have been contentious; some writers have accused Henty&#x27;s novels of being aggressively and obstinately nationalist and reactionary in such books as &quot;True to the Old Flag&quot; (1885) which features a Loyalist protagonist fighting in the American War of Independence, and &quot;In the Reign of Terror&quot; (1888) and &quot;No Surrender! A Tale of the Rising in La Vendée&quot; (1900) which are strongly hostile to the French Revolution.

Henty&#x27;s novel &quot;With Lee in Virginia&quot; has a protagonist who fights on the side of the Confederacy against the Union.

Henty&#x27;s popularity amongst homeschoolers is not without controversy. Quoting from the chapter of &quot;By Sheer Pluck&quot; called &quot;The Negro Character&quot; (&quot;like children&quot;), American television host and political commentator Rachel Maddow called Henty&#x27;s writings &quot;spectacularly racist&quot;. Carpenter and Pritchard note that while &quot;Henty&#x27;s work is indeed full of racial (and class) stereotypes&quot;, he sometimes created sympathetic ethnic minority characters, such as the Indian servant who marries a white woman in &quot;With Clive in India&quot;, and point out Henty admired the Turkish Empire. Some even accuse Henty of holding blacks in utter contempt, and this is expressed in novels such as &quot;By Sheer Pluck: A Tale of the Ashanti War&quot; and &quot;A Roving Commission, or, Through the Black Insurrection at Hayti&quot;. Kathryne S. McDorman states Henty disliked blacks and also, in Henty&#x27;s fiction, that &quot;Boers and Jews were considered equally ignoble&quot;. 

In &quot;By Sheer Pluck: A Tale of the Ashanti War&quot;, Mr. Goodenough, an entomologist remarks to the hero: “They [Negroes] are just like children ... They are always either laughing or quarrelling. They are good-natured and passionate, indolent, but will work hard for a time; clever up to a certain point, densely stupid beyond. The intelligence of an average negro is about equal to that of a European child of ten years old. ... They are fluent talkers, but their ideas are borrowed. They are absolutely without originality, absolutely without inventive power. Living among white men, their imitative faculties enable them to attain a considerable amount of civilization. Left alone to their own devices they retrograde into a state little above their native savagery.”

In the Preface to his novel &quot;A Roving Commission&quot; (1900) Henty claims &quot;the condition of the negroes in Hayti has fallen to the level of that of the savage African tribes&quot; and argues &quot;unless some strong white power should occupy the island and enforce law and order&quot; this situation will not change. In the novel &quot;Facing Death: A Tale of the Coal Mines&quot; Henty comes down against strikes and has the working class hero of the novel, Jack Simpson, quell a strike among coal miners.

A review by Deirdre H. McMahon in &quot;Studies of the Novel&quot; in 2010 refers to his novels as jingoist and racist and states that during the previous decade &quot;Numerous reviews in right-wing and conservative Christian journals and websites applaud Henty’s texts as model readings and thoughtful presents for children, especially boys. These reviews often ignore Henty’s racism by packaging his version of empire as refreshingly heroic and patriotic.&quot;

In 1888, on the bookjacket for &quot;Captain Bayley&#x27;s Heir&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that Henty&#x27;s character in &quot;With Lee in Virginia,&quot; &quot;bravely proving his sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters&quot; escapes through &quot;the devotion of a black servant and of a runaway slave whom he had assisted&quot;. The reviewer recommended the book.

==List of titles==
==Adaptation==

There is one known instance of a book title by Henty having been filmed, along with eleven audio theater productions by Heirloom Audio in their series &quot;The Extraordinary Adventures of G. A. Henty&quot;: &quot;Under Drake&#x27;s Flag&quot;, &quot;With Lee in Virginia&quot;, &quot;In the Reign of Terror&quot;, &quot;The Cat of Bubastes&quot;, &quot;Beric the Briton&quot;, &quot;The Dragon and the Raven&quot;, &quot;Wulf the Saxon, Captain Bayley&#x27;s Heir&quot; &quot;In Freedom&#x27;s Cause&quot;, &quot;St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Eve&quot;, and &quot;For the Temple.&quot; Heirloom Audio&#x27;s productions have featured several well-known actors, including Golden Globe winner Joanne Froggatt of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; and Billy Boyd of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. 

Heirloom Audio was founded by Illinois businessman Bill Heid, who said of Henty, &quot;He took you to places that had great historical significance. It&#x27;s historical fiction, yet there&#x27;s very little fiction.&quot; Heid said of the characters portrayed in Henty&#x27;s books and Heirloom Audio&#x27;s productions, &quot;Who&#x27;s a real hero? Jay Cutler or Aaron Rodgers, or Francis Drake? Who had the guts, the belief in God&#x27;s sovereignty? I want to tell the stories that young people think, &#x27;I could imagine doing something like that.&#x27; I want them to dream big. There was a time in our country we really had big dreams, thought we could do big things. For some reason, we don&#x27;t talk like that, take risks like that.&quot; 

Heid added that too often in schools, &quot;history becomes kind of a data dump, dead guys and dates.&quot; But with Henty, &quot;History is anything but boring. It&#x27;s amazing. William Wallace was a real person, had real struggles of his own. He had hopes and dreams and ambitions, struggles like anyone else, doubts and flaws.&quot;

It is then flavored with Japanese-style Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. It can be served with a variety of garnishes, such as &quot;aonori&quot; (seaweed powder), &quot;beni shōga&quot; (shredded pickled ginger), &quot;katsuobushi&quot; (bonito fish flakes), or Japanese-style mayonnaise.

<doc id="526062" wikidata="Q5538571" url="?curid=526062" title="George Dodington, 1st Baron Melcombe">
<text>George Bubb Dodington, 1st Baron Melcombe (1691 – 28 July 1762) was an English Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1715 to 1761.
==Family and early life==
Christened George Bubb, he was the eldest son of Jeremiah Bubb of Foy, Herefordshire and his wife Mary Dodington, daughter of John Dodington of Dodington, Somerset. His father died in 1696 and he was taken under the care of his uncle George Dodington. He was educated at Winchester College in 1703 and matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford on 10 July 1707 aged 16. He was admitted at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1711 and undertook a Grand Tour from 1711 to 1713.
==Political career==
Bubb was returned as Member of Parliament for Winchelsea at the 1715 British general election. He was sent as envoy to Spain from 1715 to 1717. He changed his surname to Dodington by Act of Parliament in 1717. In 1720 he was appointed Clerk of the Pells for Ireland for life. His uncle died in 1720 and left him his estate. He was Lord Lieutenant of Somerset from 1721 to 1744. At the 1722 British general election he was returned as MP for Bridgwater. 

He was taken up by Robert Walpole, who made him a Lord of the Treasury in 1724. He addressed an adulatory verse letter to Walpole in 1726, in which he praised loyalty as the supreme political virtue. He married Katherine Behan in secret, some time around 1725. He was returned again for Bridgwater at the 1727 British general election. Enormously rich, he became a friend of Frederick, Prince of Wales, who took advantage of their acquaintance to obtain loans that helped clear his debts, and, on being thrown out of St James&#x27;s Palace by his father, King George II, moved into a London house belonging to Dodington.

Dodington was returned for Bridgwater again in 1734 when he was also returned for Melcombe Regis, and in 1741 when he was also returned for Appleby, choosing to remain at Bridgewater on both occasions. He was appointed Treasurer of the Navy in 1744 and became Privy Councillor on 3 January 1745. He was returned again for Bridgwater in 1747 and was treasurer of the chamber to the Prince of Wales from 1749 to 1751.

At the 1754 British general election, Dodington was returned for Melcombe Regis. He was Treasurer of the Navy again from December 1755 to November 1756. He was created Baron Melcombe on 6 April 1761.

==Collector and salonist==

Dodington had many contacts with artists and was a collector, purchasing antiquities via Cardinal Albani in Rome. His house at Hammersmith, known as &#x27;La Trappe&#x27; (an ironic reference to a Trappist monastery) was the focus of a lively political and cultural salon of supporters of Frederick, Prince of Wales whose palace at Kew was located just across the river. It was designed by the neo-Palladian architect Roger Morris who had been connected with the circle of Lord Burlington and the sculpture gallery was designed by the Italian architect and firework display designer Giovanni Niccolo Servandoni. 
==Activities as a spy==
Dodington is said to have been involved in a spy-ring, collecting valuable information about Jacobite activities. In 1761, following the accession of Frederick&#x27;s son to the throne as George III, he was created Baron Melcombe.

Historian N.A.M. Rodger describes Dodington as an &quot;indefatigable schemer&quot; on behalf of his friends and interests of the time. Dodington is depicted in William Hogarth&#x27;s 1761 engraving &quot;Five Orders of Periwigs&quot;.
==Diarist==
His diary was published posthumously in 1784 by Henry Penruddocke Wyndham.

<text>Richard Bowdler Sharpe (22 November 1847 – 25 December 1909) was an English zoologist and ornithologist who worked as curator of the bird collection at the British Museum of natural history. In the course of his career he published several monographs on bird groups and produced a multi-volume catalogue of the specimens in the collection of the museum. He described many new species of bird and also has had species named in his honour by other ornithologists including Sharpe&#x27;s longclaw (&quot;Macronyx sharpei&quot;) and Sharpe&#x27;s starling (&quot;Pholia sharpii&quot;).

==Biography==

Richard was born in London, the first son of Thomas Bowdler Sharpe. His grandfather, Reverend Lancelot Sharpe was Rector of All Hallows Staining. His father was a publisher on Skinner Street and was best known for being the publisher of &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s London Magazine&quot;, an illustrated periodical (weekly but monthly from 1847). His care from the age of six was under an aunt, Magdalen Wallace, widow of the headmaster at Grammar School in Sevenoaks and went to school in Brighton. At nine he studied at The King&#x27;s School, Peterborough receiving a King&#x27;s Scholarship. He then moved to Loughborough Grammar School. He returned to London at the age of sixteen and worked as a clerk with W. H. Smith &amp; Sons. He already took an interest in ornithology and was interested in writing a monograph on the kingfishers. After two years, in 1865, he joined the company of the bookseller Bernard Quaritch and had an opportunity to examine ornithological books and began to work in earnest on his monograph, purchasing specimens of kingfishers from a meagre income. At nineteen, in 1867, he became a librarian at the Zoological Society of London on the recommendation of Osbert Salvin and Philip Sclater and he completed his &quot;Monograph of the Kingfishers&quot; (1868–71) during this period. The book was produced in parts with 121 illustrations.

He then began to collaborate with Henry Dresser on &quot;A History of the Birds of Europe&quot; but this had to be abandoned because of his new appointment. On the death of George Robert Gray in 1872 he joined the British Museum as a Senior Assistant in the Department of Zoology, taking charge of the bird collection. On 3 December 1867 he married Emily Eliza, daughter of J. W. Burrows of Cookham. He named a subspecies of the common paradise kingfisher (&quot;Tanysiptera galatea emiliae&quot;) after his wife in 1871. They had ten daughters and many of them contributed to his books (and of other authors too) by hand colouring the lithograph plates. One daughter, Emily Mary, worked in the entomology department of the Natural History Museum between 1905 and 1925. He became Assistant Keeper in 1895, a position he held until his death from pneumonia in 1909. He died at his home in Chiswick. In 1911 a £100 civil pension was granted to his wife and daughters Emily Mary, Ada Lavinia and Eva Augusta.

==Contributions to ornithology==

As curator of the bird collections, Sharpe&#x27;s main work was in classifying and cataloguing the collections. He also played a major role in acquiring private collections by persuading wealthy collectors and travellers to contribute to the museum. In 1872 the museum had 35,000 bird specimens; the collection had grown to half a million specimens by the time of his death. These included the bequests of Allan Octavian Hume, Osbert Salvin and Frederick DuCane Godman, the industrialist and amateur ornithologist Henry Seebohm, Colonel John Biddulph, C. B. Rickett, F. W. Styan, Alfred Russel Wallace, George Ernest Shelley, Philip Sclater and the bird illustrator John Gould.

Sharpe founded the British Ornithologists&#x27; Club in 1892 and edited its bulletin. He wrote thirteen and a half of the 27 volumes of the &quot;Catalogue of the Birds in the British Museum&quot; (1874–1898). His handsome &quot;Birds of Paradise&quot;, published in two large volumes (over 21 inches x 14 inches) in 1891 and 1898, presented these colourful birds to the world: as Sharpe wrote in his preface, &quot;a great number of the species are here figured for the first time&quot;.

Sharpe was nominated at the International Ornithological Congress at Paris in 1900 to preside over the London Congress in 1905.

==Personality==

Sharpe was noted as a genial and humorous person. Richard Meinertzhagen and his brother were introduced to the bird collections by him. He was fond of children, having ten daughters himself. None of them were given the name &quot;Bowdler&quot; at birth, but all adopted it later in life. The eldest daughter, Emily Mary Bowdler Sharpe, was a biologist and author in her own right, and also worked at the British Museum. The other nine daughters (Ada Lavinia, Eva Augusta, Lilian Bertha, Dora Louise, Lena Violet, Daisy Madeline, Sylvia Rosamund, Hilda Marion, and Aimee Marjorie) all worked as colourists on his works.

Sharpe was also known for his practical jokes and pranks. When Eugene Oates was working on the &quot;Fauna of British India&quot;, he found the notes lying on a table and filled up a stray statement on the call of a white wagtail (ssp. &quot;lugens&quot;) which went into print (&quot;The note of this species is a prolonged &quot;Pooh.&quot;&quot;). On one occasion, Sharpe ascended the Eiffel tower with friends but became hysterical on reaching the top, with Ernst Hartert and several others having to restrain him and prevent him from jumping off. A regular at the Savage and Whitefriars Club, he and his wife threw a party in February 1888 with 120 guests and entertainment that included humorous sketches, songs, recitals and music.

== Honours ==
Sharpe was awarded an honorary LL.D. by the University of Aberdeen. He was fellow of the Linnean Society and the Zoological Society of London. A gold medal was awarded to him in 1891 by the Emperor of Austria. As of 2019, in the online list of world birds maintained by Frank Gill and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union, Sharpe is credited with formally describing and coining the Latin names of 233 species of bird as well as 201 subspecies. He is also credited with introducing 45 genera. Many species and subspecies of birds have been named after him including:
* Sharpe&#x27;s drongo (&quot;Dicrurus sharpei&quot;)
* Sharpe&#x27;s apalis (&quot;Apalis sharpii&quot;)
* Sharpe&#x27;s starling (&quot;Pholia sharpii&quot;)
* Sharpe&#x27;s akalat (&quot;Sheppardia sharpei&quot;)
* Sharpe&#x27;s longclaw (&quot;Macronyx sharpei&quot;)
* Iberian green woodpecker (&quot;Picus sharpei&quot;)
A genus &quot;Sharpia&quot; was erected but is now considered to be synonymous with &quot;Ploceus&quot;.

<doc id="526073" wikidata="Q2141001" url="?curid=526073" title="Chilblains">
<text>Chilblains, also known as pernio, is a medical condition in which damage occurs to capillary beds in the skin, most often in the hands or feet, when blood perfuses into the nearby tissue, resulting in redness, itching, inflammation, and possibly blisters. 

It occurs most frequently when predisposed individuals, predominantly women, are exposed to cold and humidity. Ulcerated chilblains are referred to as kibes. Temperature-related chilblains can be prevented by keeping the feet and hands warm in cold weather and avoiding exposing these areas to extreme temperature changes. Once the diagnosis of chilblains is made, first-line treatment includes avoiding cold, damp environments and wearing gloves and warm socks.

Chilblains can be idiopathic (spontaneous and unrelated to another disease), but similar symptoms may also be a manifestation of another serious medical condition that must be investigated. Related medical conditions include Raynaud syndrome, erythromelalgia, frostbite, and trench foot, as well as connective tissue diseases such as lupus or vasculitis. In infants affected by Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (a rare inherited condition which affects the nervous system) chilblain-like symptoms occur together with severe neurologic disturbances and unexplained fevers.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Dermatitis in extremities (toes, fingers, earlobes, nose, etc), including:

* Burning and itching sensations
* Throbbing pain
* Skin discoloration (red to dark blue) with erythema (blanchable redness)
* Blistering of affected area
* Ulceration (in severe cases only)

Chilblains caused by exposure to cold and humidity can usually heal within 7–14 days.

== Prevention ==
=== Exposure ===
* Keep affected area warm, and avoid any extreme temperature changes (including very hot water).
* Keep affected area dry.
* Wear warm shoes, socks and gloves.
* Wear a hat and a scarf to protect the ears and the nose.
* Avoid tight fitting socks/shoes.

=== Other ===
* Exercise at least four times a week to improve circulation.
* Quit smoking, as it damages circulation.

== Treatment ==
* Nifedipine and amlodipine, which are vasodilators in the class of drugs known as calcium channel blockers, may help in some cases. Vasodilation may reduce pain, facilitate healing, and prevent recurrences. It is typically available in an oral pill but can be compounded into a topical formula.
* Diltiazem, a vasodilator, may help.

== Etymology ==
The word is a compound of Modern English &quot;chill&quot; ‘cold’ and the archaic word &quot;blain&quot; (now used only in the word in question), meaning ‘swelling’, ‘blister’ or ‘sore’ and derived from Old English &quot;bleġen&quot;, &quot;bleġene&quot;, having the same meaning.

==Alternative remedies==
The medieval &quot;Bald&#x27;s Leechbook&quot; recommended treating chilblains with a mixture of eggs, wine, and fennel root. A modern-day home remedy is to put garlic on the chilblains. Other herbal remedies supposed to be vasodilating, rubifacient, and warming, have been recommended.

== COVID-19 ==
Chilblain-like symptoms have also been linked to COVID-19. COVID toes, as they are commonly known, have mostly been reported in older children and adolescents, who often have not had other symptoms of COVID-19. The symptoms are usually mild and disappear without treatment. Their cause is debated: it is uncertain whether COVID toes are a delayed consequence of the viral infection itself or are, at least partially, connected to environmental factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. They may share some of the microscopic features of chilblains caused by lupus. It has been suggested that in the absence of exposure to cold and damp, COVID-19 should be considered as a possible cause of chilblains.

In a study at the dermatology department of Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris, researchers found that most of their study participants carried high levels of autoantibodies, proteins generated by the immune system that inadvertently attack the body&#x27;s own tissues. Compared with healthy individuals, the participants showed high activity of proteins called type 1 interferons, which switch on pathogen-fighting genes in immune cells.

<doc id="526078" wikidata="Q354373" url="?curid=526078" title="Népomucène Lemercier">
<text>Louis Jean Népomucène Lemercier (20 April 1771 – 7 June 1840) was a French poet and playwright.

==Life==
Lemarcier was born in Paris. His father had been intendant successively to the duc de Penthièvre, the comte de Toulouse and the unfortunate princesse de Lamballe, who was the boy&#x27;s godmother. Lemercier was a prodigy; before he was sixteen his tragedy of &quot;Méléagre&quot; was produced at the Théâtre Français. &quot;Clarisse Harlowe&quot; (1792) provoked the criticism that the author was &quot;pas assez roué pour peindre les roueries&quot; (not enough scamp to depict scamp tricks.) &quot;Le Tartufe révolutionnaire&quot; a parody full of bold political allusions, was suppressed after the fifth performance.

In 1795, Lemercier&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, called by Charles Lafitte the last great antique tragedy in French literature, was produced. It was a great success, but was violently attacked later by Julien Louis Geoffroy who stigmatized it as a bad caricature of Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon. &quot;Les quatre métamorphoses&quot; (1799) was written to prove that the most indecent subjects might be treated without offence. 
The &quot;Pinto&quot; (1800) was the result of a wager that no further dramatic innovations were possible after the comedies of Pierre Beaumarchais. 
It is a historical comedy on the subject of the Portuguese Revolution of 1640. 
This play was construed as casting reflections on the first consul Napoleon, who had hitherto been a firm friend of the avowed republican Lemercier. His extreme freedom of speech finally offended Napoleon, and the quarrel proved disastrous to Lemercier&#x27;s fortune for the time. 
In 1803, he earned a severe disappointment on the première of his tragedy &quot;Isule et Orovèse&quot; which was widely ridiculed and hooted by the public; consequently, at the beginning of the third act Lemercier withdrew his manuscript. He published his text with annoted “hootings” in order to pay deference to his public.

None of his subsequent work fulfilled the expectations raised by &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, with the exception perhaps of &quot;Frédégonde et Brunehaut&quot; (1821). 
In 1810, he was elected to the Académie française, where he consistently opposed the romanticists, refusing to vote for Victor Hugo – who was to succeed him in the &quot;fauteuil&quot; 14. In spite of this, he has some pretensions to be considered the earliest of the romantic school. His &quot;Christophe Colomb&quot; (1809), advertised on the play-bill as a &quot;comédie shakespérienne&quot; [sic], represented the interior of a ship, and showed no respect for the classical unities. 
Its numerous innovations provoked such violent disturbances in the audience that one person was killed and future representations had to be guarded by the police.
Lemercier wrote four long and ambitious epic poems: &quot;Homère&quot;, &quot;Alexandre&quot; (1801), &quot;L&#x27;Atlantiade ou la théogonie newtonienne&quot; (1812) and &quot;Moïse&quot; (1823), as well as an extraordinary &quot;Panhypocrisiade&quot; (1819–1832), a distinctly romantic production in sixteen cantos, which has the sub-title &quot;Spectacle infernal du XVIe siècle&quot;. 
In it 16th century history, with Charles V and Francis I as principal personages, is played out on an imaginary stage by demons in the intervals of their sufferings.

Lemercier died on 7 June 1840 in Paris. 
He had composed his own epitaph as follows: &quot;« Il fut homme de bien et cultiva les lettres. »&quot; (“He was a gentleman and a man of letters.”)

<text>Dance-pop is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in the late 1970s to early 1980s. It is generally uptempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of dance and pop with influences of disco, post-disco and synth-pop, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions.

Dance-pop is highly eclectic, having borrowed influences from other genres, which varied by producers, artists and periods. Such include contemporary R&amp;B, house, trance, techno, electropop, new jack swing, funk and pop rock.

Dance-pop is a popular mainstream style of music and there have been numerous artists and groups who perform in the genre. Notable artists include Cher, Madonna, Britney Spears, Rick Astley, Kylie Minogue, Christina Aguilera, Spice Girls, Paula Abdul, Backstreet Boys, Michael Jackson, Mylène Farmer, NSYNC, Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson, Rihanna, Kim Wilde, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa, Years &amp; Years, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen, and Ava Max, among others.

==History==
===1980s===

As the term &quot;disco&quot; started to go out of fashion by the late 1970s to early 1980s, other terms were commonly used to describe disco-based music, such as &quot;post-disco&quot;, &quot;club&quot;, &quot;dance&quot; or &quot;dance-pop&quot; music. These genres were, in essence, a more modern variant of disco music known as post-disco, which tended to be more experimental, electronic and producer/DJ-driven, often using sequencers and synthesizers.

Dance-pop music emerged around the early 1980s as a combination of dance and pop, or post-disco, which was uptempo and simple, club-natured, producer-driven and catchy. Dance-pop was more uptempo and dancey than regular pop, yet more structured and less free-form than dance music, usually combining pop&#x27;s easy structure and catchy tunes with dance&#x27;s strong beat and uptempo nature. Dance-pop music was usually created, composed and produced by record producers who would then hire singers to perform the songs.

At the beginning of the 1980s, disco was an anathema to mainstream pop. According to prominent AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music, utilizing her charisma, chutzpah and sex appeal. Erlewine claimed that Madonna &quot;launched dance-pop&quot; and set the standard for the genre for the next two decades. As the primary songwriter on her self-titled debut album and a co-producer by her third record, Madonna&#x27;s insistence on being involved in all creative aspects of her work was highly unusual for a female dance-pop vocalist at the time. The staff of &quot;Vice&quot; magazine stated that her debut album &quot;drew the blueprint for future dance-pop.&quot;

In the 1980s, dance-pop was closely aligned to other uptempo electronic genres, such as Hi-NRG. Prominent producers in the 1980s included Stock, Aitken and Waterman, who created Hi-NRG/dance-pop for artists such as Kylie Minogue, Dead or Alive and Bananarama. During the decade, dance-pop borrowed influences from funk (e.g. Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston), new jack swing (e.g. Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul), and contemporary R&amp;B.

Other prominent dance-pop artists and groups of the 1980s included the Pet Shop Boys, Mel and Kim, Samantha Fox, Debbie Gibson, and Tiffany.

===1990s===
By the 1990s, dance-pop had become a major genre in popular music. Several dance-pop groups and artists emerged during the 1990s, such as the Spice Girls, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Backstreet Boys, and &#x27;NSYNC. During the early 1990s, dance-pop borrowed influences from house music (e.g. Right Said Fred&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Too Sexy&quot;, Taylor Dayne&#x27;s &quot;Soul Dancing&quot;, and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Rescue Me&quot; and &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot;), as well as contemporary R&amp;B and new jack swing (e.g. Shanice&#x27;s &quot;I Love Your Smile&quot;).

By the late 1990s, electronic influences became evident in dance-pop music; Madonna&#x27;s critically acclaimed and commercially successful album &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998) incorporated techno, trance and other forms of electronic dance music, bringing electronica into mainstream dance-pop. Additionally, also in 1998, Cher released a dance-pop song called &quot;Believe&quot; which made usage of a technological innovation of the time, Auto-Tune. An audio processor and a form of pitch modification software, Auto-Tune is commonly used as a way to correct pitch and to create special effects. Since the late 1990s, the use of Auto-Tune processing has become a common feature of dance-pop music.

Celine Dion also released a midtempo dance-pop song, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; by the end of 1999. Also during this period, some British bands connected with Britpop and alternative pop experimented with dance-pop as a form – examples include Catatonia single &quot;Karaoke Queen,&quot; Bis&#x27;s top 40 hit &quot;Eurodisco&quot;, Kenickie&#x27;s final single &quot;Stay in the Sun&quot; and Romo band Orlando&#x27;s major-label debut single &quot;Just For A Second.&quot; Another Britpop band, Theaudience was fronted by Sophie Ellis Bextor who went on to a successful solo career primarily in artist-driven dance-pop.

===2000s===
At the beginning of the 2000s, dance-pop music was still prominent, and highly electronic in style, influenced by genres such as trance, house, techno and electro. Nonetheless, as R&amp;B and hip hop became extremely popular from the early part of the decade onwards, dance-pop was often influenced by urban music. Dance-pop stars from the 1980s and 1990s such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Madonna, Janet Jackson and Kylie Minogue continued to achieve success at the beginning of the decade. Whilst much dance-pop at the time was R&amp;B-influenced, many records started to return to their disco roots; Kylie Minogue&#x27;s albums such as &quot;Light Years&quot; (2000) and &quot;Fever&quot; (2001) contained influences of disco music, or a new 21st-century version of the genre known as nu-disco; hit singles such as &quot;Spinning Around&quot; (2000) and &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; (2001) also contained disco traces. In Madonna&#x27;s case, her album &quot;Music&quot; (2000) contained elements of Euro disco, especially the successful eponymous lead single.

Nevertheless, it was not until the mid-to-latter part of the decade when dance-pop music returned greatly to its disco roots; this can be seen with Madonna&#x27;s album &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot; (2005), which borrowed strong influences from the genre, especially from 1970s artists and bands such as ABBA, Giorgio Moroder, the Bee Gees and Donna Summer. Britney Spears&#x27; album &quot;Blackout&quot; (2007) contained influences of Euro disco.

The mid-to-late 2000s saw the arrival of several new dance-pop artists, including Rihanna, Kesha, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga. This period in time also saw dance-pop&#x27;s return to its more electronic roots aside from its disco ones, with strong influences of synthpop and electropop. Lady Gaga is frequently considered one of the pioneers of this evolution, notably with her singles &quot;Just Dance&quot; and &quot;Poker Face&quot; which were heavily influenced by synthpop and electropop. Rihanna&#x27;s singles in the dance-pop genre, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; and &quot;Disturbia&quot;, contained electronic influences, the former of which has elements of house music, the latter electropop. Kesha&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Tik Tok&quot;, was also highly electronic in style and employed a video game beat. Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;Hot N Cold&quot; (2008), &quot;California Gurls&quot; (2010), and &quot;Firework&quot; (2010), which were major commercial hits, also showcased influences of electropop and house music.

===2010s===

The 2010s, similarly to the late 2000s, saw strong electronic influences present within dance-pop; there is also a strong emphasis on bass-heavy drum beats. Artists such as Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Madonna, Kesha, Christina Aguilera, Usher and Rihanna remained very popular, while newer recording artists such as Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Rita Ora, and Dua Lipa joined the dance-pop charts within the decade.

Some music journalists noted the popularity of dance tracks, particularly those with narratives about clubbing and feeling positive during hard times, in pop music in the early 2010s. This was considered a response to the 2007–2008 financial crisis or 2012 phenomenon, with the colloquial term &quot;recession pop&quot; used to define some of the popular songs of this decade.

American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift&#x27;s albums &quot;Red&quot; (2012), &quot;1989&quot; (2014) and &quot;Reputation&quot; (2017) contain more of a pop-influenced sound, which features production by dance-pop record producers Max Martin and Shellback. Ariana Grande&#x27;s single &quot;Problem&quot; featuring Iggy Azalea was a big hit in 2014 and reached combined sales and track-equivalent streams of 9 million units worldwide the following year.

===2020s===
The 2020s continued to see the evolution of dance-pop with an array of artists expanding the genre&#x27;s boundaries while incorporating elements from diverse musical styles.

In 2020, Dua Lipa&#x27;s album &quot;Future Nostalgia&quot; garnered significant acclaim for its fusion of disco, funk, and electro-pop. Hits like &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Now&quot; and &quot;Physical&quot; channeled retro vibes while offering contemporary production, helping revive interest in the dance-pop genre. Lady Gaga also made a notable return to her dance-pop roots with the album &quot;Chromatica&quot;, which included collaborations with Ariana Grande (&quot;Rain on Me&quot;) and Blackpink (&quot;Sour Candy&quot;).

The influence of K-pop on dance-pop also grew in prominence. South Korean groups such as BTS and Blackpink achieved global success with songs that blended electronic dance beats with pop melodies. For instance, BTS&#x27;s single &quot;Dynamite&quot; (2020) became a global hit, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, showcasing how K-pop artists were successfully merging dance-pop elements into their music.

Doja Cat&#x27;s &quot;Planet Her&quot; (2021) and The Weeknd&#x27;s &quot;Dawn FM&quot; (2022) blended R&amp;B with dance-pop and synth-pop elements, offering new interpretations of the genre.

Dua Lipa&#x27;s follow-up album &quot;Radical Optimism&quot; (2024), featuring singles like &quot;Training Season&quot;, &quot;Houdini&quot;, and &quot;Illusion&quot;, continued to push dance-pop boundaries by incorporating elements of house and disco while exploring themes of empowerment and growth. Similarly, Taylor Swift&#x27;s albums &quot;Midnights&quot; (2022) and &quot;1989 (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&quot; (2024) showcased a continued embrace of synth-pop and dance-pop sensibilities.

In 2024, The Recording Academy introduced a new category, the Grammy Award for Best Pop Dance Recording, to honor the growing influence of dance-pop. The inaugural winner was Kylie Minogue for her single &quot;Padam Padam&quot;, highlighting her continued influence in the genre.

The decade also saw a trend toward a more indie and alternative take on dance-pop, with artists like Rina Sawayama and Charli XCX blending hyperpop, electro-pop, and avant-pop elements into their music, as evident in albums like &quot;Sawayama&quot; (2020) and &quot;Crash&quot; (2022), respectively.

Dance-pop&#x27;s mainstream appeal persisted as major festivals and live events returned [when?], underscoring the genre&#x27;s enduring popularity and adaptability.

<text>The Churchill Rocket Research Range is a Canadian former rocket launch site located outside Churchill, Manitoba. The facility was used by Canada and the United States beginning in 1954 for sub-orbital launches of sounding rockets to study the upper atmosphere. The site was scientifically beneficial due to lying in the center of a zone containing high aurora activity. Over 3,500 sub-orbital flights were launched from the site.

The site is sometimes referred to as Fort Churchill after the nearby former military base (now Churchill Airport) and is connected by an all-weather gravel road to the town of Churchill.

==History==
The complex was first built in 1954 by the Canadian Army&#x27;s Defence Research Board to study the effects of auroras on long distance communications. The programme shut down in 1955, but the site was re-opened and greatly expanded in 1956 as part of Canada&#x27;s participation in the International Geophysical Year. Launches for the IGY experiments started in 1957, and the site was closed again in December 1958 when the IGY, which was actually two years long, ended.

The site was reopened again in August 1959 by the US Army, in collaboration with the Canadian government, as part of its network of sounding rocket stations. In September 1959 it was used to test CARDE&#x27;s new solid fuel propellant systems with PVT-1, the vehicle that would evolve into the Black Brant. However, in late 1960 a fire destroyed many of the facilities. It was announced that the Black Brant test series would be continued with an additional twelve launches at NASA&#x27;s Wallops Flight Facility during 1961-62, while the facilities at Churchill were rebuilt.

The US Army ended its involvement at Churchill in June 1970, and the site was taken over by the Canadian National Research Council to support the Canadian Upper Atmosphere Research Program. The site was used sporadically during the 1970s and 1980s, and was largely deserted by 1985.

=== SpacePort Canada: 1994-1998 ===
Akjuit Aerospace, a Canadian company founded in 1992, signed a 30-year lease with the Canadian government for the Churchill Rocket Research Range in 1994 with the goal of developing the world&#x27;s first commercial spaceport. Akjuit assembled a &quot;technical team&quot; of 21 firms led by the American aerospace contractor Raytheon to plan the development of the site into SpacePort Canada, including polar orbital launch capability. Akjuit planned to launch commercial polar-orbiting payloads using Russian-made Start-1 rockets (so named as they were made of repurposed Soviet-era SS-25 ICBMs made redundant by the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). Churchill&#x27;s location in the western hemisphere combined with its range-safety for firing northwards made it an ideal location, with the exception of the extremely cold weather which would limit launch seasons.

Akjuit&#x27;s first and only rocket launch took place at 7:10a.m. Central Time on April 28, 1998: a suborbital Black Brant IXB research rocket containing a physics payload for the Canadian Space Agency.

Akjuit Aerospace ceased operations in May 1998.

==Current uses==
The site is no longer used for rocket launches and is currently the location of the Churchill Northern Studies Centre, a non-profit and multi-disciplinary research facility that is also open for educational tourism.

<text>Fu Mingxia (born August 16, 1978, in Wuhan, Hubei) is a retired Chinese diver, multiple Olympic gold medalist and world champion. She won the platform-diving world championship in 1991 at the age of 12, making her the youngest diving champ of all time. She is also famous for being one of the youngest Olympic diving champions, having earned a gold at the 1992 Barcelona Games when she was just 13 years and 345 days old. Throughout the 1990s, Fu dominated the sport with her repertoire of extremely difficult dives. During the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Fu won her fourth gold medal, joining Americans Pat McCormick and Greg Louganis as the world&#x27;s only quadruple Olympic-diving champions.

==Early life and career==
Fu Mingxia was born into a working-class family in the city of Wuhan, located along the Yangtze River in central China. Inspired by an older sister, Fu enrolled in gymnastics at a local sports school at the age of 5. Though she was just a child, Fu demonstrated remarkable poise and body control. The coaches, however, felt that she was not flexible enough to make it as a gymnast. Instead, they suggested she pursue diving, though Fu, only about seven years old at the time, could not swim.

Fu made the transition from gymnast to springboard diver and before long was noticed by diving coach Yu Fen, who took Fu to Beijing in 1989 to train at a state-sponsored boarding school as a member of the state diving team. Because of her remarkable talents, she became a part of China&#x27;s disciplined and highly successful elite sporting programs.

Through a strenuous training program, Fu learned to set aside her fears and progressed quickly. Training sessions averaged four to five hours a day, seven days a week, with the occasional nine-hour day. At times, Fu practiced 100 dives a day. In time, she was gliding so close to the platform during her dives that her short hair often touched the end during her descent toward the water.

In 1990, Fu made her international diving debut, capturing a gold at the U.S. Open and also at the Goodwill Games, held that summer in Seattle. Her daring dives from the top of the 10-meter platform transformed the teeny 12-year-old into a national treasure. However, with pressure mounting, Fu placed third at the Asian Games held in Beijing in the fall of 1990. Following the loss, she changed her routine, adding moves that were technically more difficult, but which she felt more comfortable performing.

By 1991, Fu was talented enough to attend the diving world championships, held in Perth, Australia. The competition was intense, and Fu found herself in eighth place in the final round because she had failed a compulsory dive. Fu pulled herself together, however, and ended up with the title, beating out the Soviet Union&#x27;s World Cup winner Yelena Miroshina by nearly 25 points. At just 12 years old, Fu became the youngest international champion ever. It is a title she will hold forever because after the competition, swimming&#x27;s national governing body changed the rules, requiring all competitors of international competitions to be at least 14 years old.

While Fu initially made her mark on the 10-meter platform, she also began competing on the three-meter springboard. In April 1992, she won the gold on the springboard at the Chinese international diving tournament in Shanghai.

Fu made her Olympic debut at the 1992 Games, held in Barcelona, Spain. During the competition, the 154 cm (5&#x27;1/2&quot;), 43 kg (94.8 lb) Fu used her youthful fearlessness to beat out older competitors. Fu captured a gold in the platform competition. At 13, she was the youngest medal winner at the Olympics that year-and the second-youngest in the history of the Games. She also qualified as the youngest Olympic diving champion, a title she still holds.

Fu&#x27;s success in her first Olympics drove her toward her second. In preparing for the 1996 Olympics, held in Atlanta, Fu trained seven hours a day, six days a week. Her only other activities included listening to music, watching television and getting massages. Fu&#x27;s coaches drilled her hard, but she said she found comfort and peace from the physically and mentally straining regimen through music. Fu was in top form at the 1996 Olympics and shone on both the platform and springboard, taking gold in both events. She was the first woman in 36 years to win both events in a single Olympics.

*2000 Olympic Games – 3m springboard 1st (22 years old)

== Retirement and comeback ==
Shortly after Atlanta, the triple-gold-medallist decided to retire and enrolled at Beijing&#x27;s Tsinghua University to study management science. Fu also got involved in politics and in 1997 served as a delegate to the Communist Party&#x27;s 15th Congress.

Fu spent about two years off the board. By 1998, however, Fu began diving with the university team, but on her own terms. On her own terms still meant a disciplined training schedule, but she reduced the number of hours per day down to five. Fu found that practicing just for the sake of practicing to be a pointless endeavor.

As a member of the university team, Fu competed in the 1999 Universiade in Palma, Spain, winning both the highboard and springboard titles. Less than a year back into it, she won silver at the Diving World Cup. Fu regained her spot on the national Olympic squad and also took up a new sport - three-meter synchronized diving - as she headed for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Fu and her partner, Guo Jingjing, practiced together for less than six months, yet earned a silver. The Russian pair that beat them had trained together for years. After the synchronized diving event, Fu went on to compete on the springboard. She won a gold, nailing her final dive, a reverse one-and-a-half somersault, two-and-a-half twist for nines when eights would have been enough to beat out Guo, her teammate. With her four gold medals and one silver, Fu became one of the most decorated Olympic divers of all time. She is one of only three divers to win an Olympic double-double in the individual events: Pat McCormick and Greg Louganis being the other two.

== Marriage and motherhood ==
Fu married Antony Leung, former Financial Secretary of Hong Kong, on July 15, 2002, in Hawaii. Their marriage was not publicly revealed until July 30, 2002. They have a daughter (born February 26, 2003) and two sons (born December 12, 2004, and April 25, 2008).

Though Fu is no longer diving, she was a member of the Beijing Olympic bid committee for the 2008 Olympics. Beijing won the bid, and Fu went on to serve as an ambassador at the event.

<text>Osteosclerosis is a disorder characterized by abnormal hardening of bone and an elevation in bone density. It may predominantly affect the medullary portion and/or cortex of bone. Plain radiographs are a valuable tool for detecting and classifying osteosclerotic disorders. It can manifest in localized or generalized osteosclerosis. Localized osteosclerosis can be caused by Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease, sickle-cell disease and osteoarthritis among others. Osteosclerosis can be classified in accordance with the causative factor into acquired and hereditary.

==Types==
===Acquired osteosclerosis===
* Osteogenic bone metastasis caused by carcinoma of prostate and breast
* Paget&#x27;s disease of bone
* Myelofibrosis (primary disorder or secondary to intoxication or malignancy)
* Osteosclerosing types of chronic osteomyelitis
* Hypervitaminosis D
* Hyperparathyroidism
* Schnitzler syndrome
* Mastocytosis
* Skeletal fluorosis
* Monoclonal IgM Kappa cryoglobulinemia
* Hepatitis C.

===Hereditary osteosclerosis===
* Malignant infantile osteopetrosis
* Neuropathic infantile osteopetrosis
* Infantile osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis
* Infantile osteopetrosis with immunodeficiency
* IO with leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome (LAD-III)
* Intermediate osteopetrosis
* Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (Albers-Schonberg)
* Pyknodysostosis (osteopetrosis acro-osteolytica)
* Osteopoikilosis (Buschke–Ollendorff syndrome)
* Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis
* Mixed sclerosing bone dysplasia
* Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati–Engelmann disease)
* SOST-related sclerosing bone dysplasias

==Diagnosis==
Osteosclerosis can be detected with a simple radiography. There are white portions of the bone which appear due to the increased number of bone trabeculae.

==Animals==
In the animal kingdom, there also exists a non-pathological form of osteosclerosis, resulting in unusually solid bone structure with little to no marrow. It is often seen in aquatic vertebrates, especially those living in shallow waters, providing ballast as an adaptation for an aquatic lifestyle. It makes bones heavier, but also more fragile. In those animal groups, osteosclerosis often occurs together with bone thickening (pachyostosis). This joint occurrence is called pachyosteosclerosis.

<doc id="526100" wikidata="Q1755568" url="?curid=526100" title="Osteopetrosis">
<text>Osteopetrosis, literally , also known as marble bone disease or Albers-Schönberg disease, is an extremely rare inherited disorder whereby the bones harden, becoming denser, in contrast to more prevalent conditions like osteoporosis, in which the bones become less dense and more brittle, or osteomalacia, in which the bones soften. Osteopetrosis can cause bones to dissolve and break.

It is one of the hereditary causes of osteosclerosis. It is considered to be the prototype of osteosclerosing dysplasias. The cause of the disease is understood to be malfunctioning osteoclasts and their inability to resorb bone. Although human osteopetrosis is a heterogeneous disorder encompassing different molecular lesions and a range of clinical features, all forms share a single pathogenic nexus in the osteoclast. The exact molecular defects or location of the mutations taking place are unknown. Osteopetrosis was first described in 1903 by German radiologist Albers-Schönberg.

==Signs and symptoms==

Despite this excess bone formation, people with osteopetrosis tend to have bones that are more brittle than normal. Mild osteopetrosis may cause no symptoms, and present no problems.

However, serious forms can result in the following:
* Stunted growth, deformity, and increased likelihood of fractures
* Patients experience anemia, recurrent infections, and hepatosplenomegaly due to bone expansion leading to bone marrow narrowing and extramedullary hematopoiesis
* It can also result in blindness, facial paralysis, and deafness, due to the increased pressure put on the nerves by the extra bone
* Abnormal cortical bone morphology
* Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies
* Abnormality of temperature regulation
* Abnormality of the ribs
* Abnormality of vertebral epiphysis morphology
* Bone pain
* Cranial nerve paralysis
* Craniosynostosis
* Hearing impairment
* Hypocalcemia

=== Malignant infantile osteopetrosis ===
Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), also known as malignant infantile osteopetrosis or infantile malignant osteopetrosis (IMO), is a rare type of skeletal dysplasia characterized by a distinct radiographic pattern of overall increased density of the bones with fundamental involvement of the medullary portion. Infantile osteopetrosis typically manifests in infancy. Diagnosis is principally based on clinical and radiographic evaluation, confirmed by gene analysis where applicable. As a result of medullary canal obliteration and bony expansion, grave pancytopenia, cranial nerve compression, and pathologic fractures may ensue. The prognosis is poor if untreated. The classic radiographic features include endobone or &quot;bone-within-bone&quot; appearance in the spine, pelvis and proximal femora, upper limbs, and short tubular bones of the hand. Additionally, there is the Erlenmeyer flask deformity type 2 which is characterized by the absence of normal diaphysial metaphysical modeling of the distal femora with abnormal radiographic appearance of trabecular bone and alternating radiolucent metaphyseal bands.

The precise and early diagnosis of infantile osteopetrosis is important for management of complications, genetic counselling, and timely institution of appropriate treatment, namely hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which offers a satisfactory treatment modality for a considerable percentage of infantile osteopetrosis. Amelioration of radiographic bone lesions after HSCT in infantile osteopetrosis has been proposed as an important indicator of success of the therapy. A few publications with limited study participants have demonstrated the resolution of skeletal radiographic pathology following HSCT.
=== Adult osteopetrosis ===
Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO) is also known as Albers-Schönberg disease. Most do not know they have this disorder because most individuals do not show any symptoms. However, those who do show symptoms will typically have a curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and multiple bone fractures. There are two types of adult osteopetrosis based on the basis of radiographic, biochemical, and clinical features.

Many patients will have bone pains. The defects are very common and include neuropathies due to cranial nerve entrapment, osteoarthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome. About 40% of patients will experience recurrent fractures of their bones. 10% of patients will have osteomyelitis of the mandible.

== Causes ==
The various types of osteopetrosis are caused by genetic changes (mutations) in one of at least ten genes. There is nothing a parent can do before, during or after a pregnancy to cause osteopetrosis in a child.

Normally, bone growth is a balance between osteoblasts (cells that create bone tissue) and osteoclasts (cells that destroy bone tissue). This process is necessary to keep bones strong and healthy. Those with osteopetrosis have a deficiency of osteoclasts, meaning too little bone is being resorbed, resulting in too much bone being created. The genes associated with osteopetrosis are involved in the development and/or function of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone tissue when old bone is being replaced by new bone (bone remodeling). Mutations in these genes can lead to abnormal osteoclasts(termed osteoclast-rich osteopetrosis), or having too few osteoclasts(osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis). If this happens, old bone cannot be broken down as new bone is formed, so bones become too dense and prone to breaking.

Three different types of inheritance-autsomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive have been observed.
* Mutations in the CLCN7 gene cause most cases of autosomal dominant(in a dominant negative manner) osteopetrosis, 10-15% of cases of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (the most severe form), and all known cases of intermediate autosomal osteopetrosis.
* Mutations in the TCIRG1 gene cause about 50% of cases of AR(autosomal recessive) osteopetrosis.
* Mutations in the IKBKG gene cause X-linked osteopetrosis.
* Mutations in the CA-II gene can be an extremely rare cause of AR osteopetrosis in the setting of renal defects.
* Mutations in the RANKL gene cause AR osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis.
* Mutations in other genes are less common causes of osteopetrosis.
* In about 30% percent of affected people, the cause is unknown.
=== Gene variation ===
== Mechanisms ==
Normal bone growth is achieved by a balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption (breakdown of bone matrix) by osteoclasts. In osteopetrosis, the number of osteoclasts may be reduced, normal, or increased. Most importantly, osteoclast dysfunction mediates the pathogenesis of this disease.

Osteopetrosis can be caused by underlying mutations that interfere with the acidification of the osteoclast resorption pit, for example due to a deficiency of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme encoded by the CA2 gene. Carbonic anhydrase is required by osteoclasts for proton production. Without this enzyme hydrogen ion pumping is inhibited and bone resorption by osteoclasts is defective, as an acidic environment is needed to dissociate calcium hydroxyapatite from the bone matrix. As bone resorption fails while bone formation continues, excessive bone is formed.

Mutations in any of the genes associated with osteopetrosis lead to abnormal or missing osteoclasts. Without functional osteoclasts, old bone is not broken down as new bone is formed. As a result, bones throughout the skeleton become unusually dense. The bones are also structurally abnormal, making them prone to fracture. These problems with bone remodeling underlie all of the major features of osteopetrosis.

==Diagnosis==
The differential diagnosis of osteopetrosis includes other disorders that produce osteosclerosis. They constitute a wide array of disorders with clinically and radiologically diverse manifestations. Among the differential diagnosis are hereditary ostoesclerosing dysplasias such as; neuropathic infantile osteopetrosis, infantile osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis, infantile osteopetrosis with immunodeficiency, infantile osteopetrosis with leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome (LAD-III), pyknodysostosis (osteopetrosis acro-osteolytica), osteopoikilosis (Buschke–Ollendorff syndrome), osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis, mixed sclerosing skeletal dysplasias, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati–Engelmann disease), SOST-related sclerosing skeletal dysplasias. Besides, the differential diagnosis includes acquired conditions that induce osteosclerosis such as osteosclerotic metastasis notably carcinomas of the prostate gland and breast, Paget&#x27;s disease of bone, myelofibrosis (primary disorder or secondary to intoxication or malignancy), Erdheim–Chester disease, osteosclerosing types of osteomyelitis, sickle cell disease, hypervitaminosis D, and hypoparathyroidism.

== Treatment ==
It was the first genetic disease treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (osteoclasts are derived from hematopoietic precursors). There is no cure, although curative therapy with bone marrow transplantion is being investigated in clinical trials. It is believed the healthy marrow will provide cells from which osteoclasts will develop. If complications occur in children, patients can be treated with vitamin D. Gamma interferon has also been shown to be effective, and it can be associated to vitamin D. Erythropoetin has been used to treat any associated anemia. Corticosteroids may alleviate both the anemia and stimulate bone resorption. Fractures and osteomyelitis can be treated as usual. Treatment for osteopetrosis depends on the specific symptoms present and the severity in each person. Therefore, treatment options must be evaluated on an individual basis. Nutritional support is important to improve growth and it also enhances responsiveness to other treatment options. A calcium-deficient diet has been beneficial for some affected people.

Treatment is necessary for the infantile form:
* Vitamin D (calcitriol) appears to stimulate dormant osteoclasts, which stimulates bone resorption
* Gamma interferon can have long-term benefits. It improves white blood cell function (leading to fewer infections), decreases bone volume, and increases bone marrow volume.
* Erythropoietin can be used for anemia, and corticosteroids can be used for anemia and to stimulate bone resorption.
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) improves some cases of severe, infantile osteopetrosis associated with bone marrow failure, and offers the best chance of longer-term survival for individuals with this type.

In pediatric (childhood) osteopetrosis, surgery is sometimes needed because of fractures. Adult osteopetrosis typically does not require treatment, but complications of the condition may require intervention. Surgery may be needed for aesthetic or functional reasons (such as multiple fractures, deformity, and loss of function), or for severe degenerative joint disease.

==Prognosis==
The long-term outlook for people with osteopetrosis depends on the subtype and the severity of the condition in each person. The severe infantile forms of osteopetrosis are associated with shortened life expectancy, with most untreated children not surviving past their first decade. Bone marrow transplantation seems to have cured some infants with early-onset disease. However, the long-term prognosis after transplantation is unknown. For those with onset in childhood or adolescence, the effect of the condition depends on the specific symptoms (including how fragile the bones are and how much pain is present). Life expectancy in the adult-onset forms is normal.

== Prevalence ==
Approximately eight to 40 children are born in the United States each year with the malignant infantile type of osteopetrosis. One in every 100,000 to 500,000 individuals is born with this form of osteopetrosis. Higher rates have been found in Denmark and Costa Rica. Males and females are affected in equal numbers.

The adult type of osteopetrosis affects about 1,250 individuals in the United States. One in every 200,000 individuals is affected by the adult type of osteopetrosis. Higher rates have been found in Brazil. Males and females are affected in equal numbers.

Osteopetrosis affects one newborn out of every 20,000 to 250,000 worldwide, but the odds are much higher in the Russian region of Chuvashia (1 of every 3,500–4,000 newborns) due to genetic traits of the Chuvash people.

== Recent research ==
Recent research demonstrated that the systematic administration of RANKL for one month to Rankl(-/-) mice, which closely resemble the human disease, significantly improved the bone phenotype and has beneficial effects on bone marrow, spleen and thymus; major adverse effects arise only when mice are clearly overtreated. Overall, it provided evidence that the pharmacological administration of RANKL represents the appropriate treatment option for RANKL-deficient ARO patients, to be validated in a pilot clinical trial.

Interferon gamma-1b is FDA-approved to delay the time to disease progression in patients with severe, malignant osteopetrosis.

<text>An academic major is the academic discipline to which an undergraduate student formally commits. A student who successfully completes all courses required for the major qualifies for an undergraduate degree. The word &quot;major&quot; (also called &quot;concentration&quot;, particularly at private colleges) is also sometimes used administratively to refer to the academic discipline pursued by a graduate student or postgraduate student in a master&#x27;s or doctoral program.

An academic major typically involves completion of a combination of required and elective courses in the chosen discipline. The latitude a student has in choosing courses varies from program to program. An academic major is administered by select faculty in an academic department. A major administered by more than one academic department is called an &quot;interdisciplinary major&quot;. In some settings, students may be permitted to design their own major, subject to faculty approval.

In the United States, students are usually not required to choose their major discipline when first enrolling as an undergraduate. In addition, most colleges and universities require that all students take a general core curriculum in the liberal arts. Normally students are required to commit by the end of their second academic year at latest, and some schools even disallow students from declaring a major until this time. A student who declares two academic majors is said to have a &quot;double major&quot;. A &quot;coordinate major&quot; is an ancillary major designed to complement the primary one. A coordinate major requires fewer course credits to complete. Many colleges also allow students to declare a minor field, a secondary discipline in which they also take a substantial number of classes, but not so many as would be necessary to complete a major.

==History==
The roots of the academic major as we now know it first surfaced in the 19th century as &quot;alternative components of the undergraduate degree&quot;. Before that, all students receiving an undergraduate degree would be required to study the same slate of courses geared at a comprehensive &quot;liberal education&quot;.

In 1825, the University of Virginia initiated an educational approach that would allow students to choose from an area of focus. Offering eight options (which included ancient languages, anatomy, medicine), other higher educational systems in Europe began to develop into a stricter specialization approach to studies after the American Civil War.

In the United States, in the second half of the 19th century, concentrated foci at the undergraduate level began to prosper and popularize, but the familiar term &quot;major&quot; did not appear until 1877 in a Johns Hopkins University catalogue. The major generally required 2 years of study, while the minor required one.

From 1880 to 1910, Baccalaureate granting American institutions vastly embraced a free-elective system, where students were endowed with a greater freedom to explore intellectual curiosities.

The 1930s witnessed the appearance of first interdisciplinary major: American studies. Culture was the grounding concept and orchestrating principle for its courses.
1960s to 1970s experienced a new tide of interdisciplinary majors and a relaxation of curriculum and graduation requirements. (Civil Rights Movement spawned Women&#x27;s studies and Black Studies, for example.) 
In the 1980s and 1990s, &quot;interdisciplinary studies, multiculturalism, feminist pedagogy, and a renewed concern for the coherence and direction of the undergraduate program began to assail the Baccalaureate degree dominated by the academic major.&quot;

==Major&#x27;s significance==
The academic major is considered a defining and dominant characteristic of the undergraduate degree. &quot;The ascendancy of the disciplines in the late nineteenth century and their continuing dominance throughout the twentieth century have left an indelible imprint on the shape and direction of the academic major&quot; and research affirms that the academic major is the strongest and clearest curricular link to gains in student learning. While general education is considered to be the breadth component of an undergraduate education, the major is commonly deemed the depth aspect. Choice of major has a significant impact on employment prospects and lifetime earnings.

==Discourse and disagreement==
Through its development, scholars, academics, and educators have disagreed on the purpose and nature of the undergraduate major. Generally, proponents of the major and departmental system &quot;argue that they enable an academic community to foster the development, conservation and diffusion of knowledge.&quot; In contrast, critics &quot;claim that they promote intellectual tribalism, where specialization receives favor over the mastery of multiple epistemologies, where broader values of liberal learning and of campus unity are lost, and where innovation is inhibited due to parochial opposition to new sub-specialties and research methods.&quot;

==Difference from academic concentration==
In many universities, an academic concentration is a focus within a specific academic major, that is a field of study within a specific academic major. For example, interdisciplinary programs in humanities or social sciences will require a student to pick a specific academic concentration as a focus within their academic major, such as an academic major in Interdisciplinary Humanities with an academic concentration in Film or an academic major in Interdisciplinary Social Sciences with an academic concentration in Geography. At several art schools and liberal arts colleges, an academic concentration serves a similar function to an academic minor at other universities, that is an academic discipline outside of the student&#x27;s academic major in which they take a number of classes. At Brown University and Harvard University, however, the term &quot;concentration&quot; refers simply to the major field.

At the doctoral studies level, an academic major or major field refers to a student&#x27;s primary focus within their degree program while a minor or minor field refers to their secondary focus. For example, a doctoral student studying history might pursue their degree in history with a major field in war and society and a minor field in postcolonial studies.

==Impacted majors==
An impacted major is a major for which more students apply for than the school can accommodate, a classic example of demand exceeding supply. When that occurs, the major becomes &quot;impacted&quot; and so is susceptible to higher standards of admission.

For example, suppose that a school has minimum requirements are SATs of 1100 and a GPA of 3.0. If a person applies to an impacted major, the school can raise the minimum requirements as much as needed to weed out the students that it is unable to accommodate. Because of this, some students may opt to apply to a school as &quot;Undeclared&quot;. If in the above example the school implements requirements of SATs of 1300 and a GPA of 3.4 for the impacted major, a student may find it better to apply as &quot;Undeclared&quot; if they meet only the minimum requirements. However, many universities, such as the University of California, Berkeley, may in turn present more difficult requirements (such as a GPA requirement in certain prerequisite classes) to enter an impacted major even once accepted to the university overall.

<text>The European Patent Organisation (sometimes abbreviated EPOrg in order to distinguish it from the European Patent Office, one of the two organs of the organisation) is a public international organisation created in 1977 by its contracting states to grant patents in Europe under the European Patent Convention (EPC) of 1973. The European Patent Organisation has its seat at Munich, Germany, and has administrative and financial autonomy. The organisation is independent from the European Union, and has as member states all 27 EU member states along with 12 other European states.

The evolution of the Organisation is inherently linked to that of the European Patent Convention. See European Patent Convention (EPC) for the history of the European patent system as set up by the EPC, operated by the European Patent Office (EPO), and supervised by the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation.

== Organs ==

The European Patent Organisation has two organs: the European Patent Office, which acts as its executive body, and the Administrative Council, which acts as its supervisory body as well as, to a limited extent, its legislative body. The actual legislative power to revise the European Patent Convention lies with the Contracting States themselves when meeting at a Conference of the Contracting States.

Besides, the Boards of Appeal, which do not form an independent organ of the Organisation but are integrated within the European Patent Office, are assigned the role of an independent judiciary.&lt;ref name=&quot;G3/08-7.2.1&quot;&gt; Opinion G 3/08 of 12 May 2010, Reasons 7.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Patent Organisation is in that sense an international organisation &quot;modelled on a modern state order and based on the separation of powers principle&quot;.

=== European Patent Office ===

The European Patent Office (EPO) examines European patent applications and grants European patents under the European Patent Convention. Its headquarters are located at Munich, Germany, with a branch in Rijswijk (near The Hague, Netherlands), sub-offices in Berlin, Germany, and Vienna, Austria, and a &quot;liaison bureau&quot; in Brussels, Belgium.

=== Administrative Council ===

The Administrative Council is made up of Representatives and alternate Representatives of the Contracting States and is responsible for overseeing the work of the European Patent Office, ratifying the budget and approving the actions of the President of the Office. The council also amends the Rules of the EPC and some particular provisions of the Articles of the European Patent Convention.

As of 2019, the Chairman of the Administrative Council is Josef Kratochvíl.

== Legal status ==
The European Patent Organisation has legal personality, and is represented by the President of the European Patent Office.

== Member states, extension state, and validation states ==
There are, as of October 2022, 39 Contracting States to the EPC, also called member states of the European Patent Organisation: Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom (see European Patent Convention article for the dates of entry in force in each country). That is, all EU member states are also members of the European Patent Organisation, and, additionally, Albania, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom are also members of the European Patent Organisation. The most recent member state to join the EPC was Montenegro which did so on 1 October 2022.

In addition, there is one &quot;extension state&quot;, Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is not a Contracting State to the EPC but has signed an extension agreement under which the protection conferred by European patent applications and patents is extended to the relevant country. Slovenia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Croatia, North Macedonia, Albania, Serbia, and Montenegro were all extension states prior to joining the EPC.

Furthermore, there are so-called &quot;validation states&quot;, which are not Contracting States to the EPC but have signed validation agreements that act similarly to the extension agreements to extend the protection of European patent applications and European patents. Morocco, Moldova, Tunisia, Cambodia, and Georgia became validation states on 1 March 2015, 1 November 2015, 1 December 2017, 1 March 2018, and 15 January 2024, respectively.

<text>Rodolphe Archibald Reiss (8 July 1875 – 7 August 1929) was a German–Swiss criminology-pioneer, forensic scientist, professor and writer.

== Early life and studies ==
The Reiss family was in agriculture and winemaking. Archibald was the eighth of ten children, son of Ferdinand Reiss, landowner and Pauline Sabine Anna Gabriele Seutter von Loetzen. After finishing highschool in Germany, he went to Switzerland for his studies. He had received a Ph.D. in chemistry at the age of 22 and was an expert in photography and forensic science. In 1906 he was appointed a professor of forensic science at the University of Lausanne. In 1909, he was the founder of the first academic forensic science programme and of the &quot;Institut de police scientifique&quot; (Institute of forensic science) at the University of Lausanne. He published two major books on forensic science &quot;Photographie judiciaire&quot; (Forensic photography), Mendel, Paris, in 1903 and the first part of his major contribution &quot;Manuel de police scientifique. I Vols et homicides&quot; (Handbook of forensic science I: Thefts and homicides), Payot, Lausanne and Acan, Paris, in 1911. The Institute he created celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2009 and has grown to become a major school, &quot;Ecole des sciences criminelles&quot;, that includes forensic science, criminology and criminal law within the Faculty of Law and Criminal Justice of the University of Lausanne.

== Serbia ==

With the advent of World War I, Reiss was commissioned by the Serbian government to investigate atrocities committed by the invading Central Powers against Serbs. Dr. Reiss would end up extensively documenting his findings in two reports. The first, &quot;Report upon the atrocities committed by the Austro-Hungarian Army during the first invasion of Serbia&quot; was completed in 1915 and published in 1916, focusing on the crimes committed by the Austro-Hungarians against the Serbs during their invasion and occupation of Serbia in the first few months of World War I in 1914. The second Reiss report focused on the second round of the invasion and occupation of Serbia and crimes committed against the Serbs which began in 1915, this time by the combined forces of Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Germany, but in Bulgaria the results of Rice&#x27;s investigations are rejected on the arguments that he did not take any photographs of victims of &quot;Bulgarian atrocities&quot;, while making them for the Austro-Hungarian and German ones - moreover that he was one of the pioneers of forensic photography and the fact that he fought in the ranks of the Serbian army during the war compromised his impartiality as an expert. This second report, &quot;Infringement of the Rules and Laws of War committed by the Austro-Bulgaro-Germans: Letters of a Criminologist on the Serbian Macedonian Front&quot;, was published in 1919. Reiss also attributes the burning of the Albanian villages in the Preševo Valley, carried out by the Serbian army during the First Balkan War and described by the then war correspondent of the &quot;Kiev Thought&quot; Lev Trotsky, to the Bulgarian army and presents the villages as &quot;Serbian&quot;.

When Serbia was overrun in 1915 he joined the Serbian Army in its retreat across Albania to return with the victorious Serbian Army when it liberated Belgrade in the final days of the war. He was known as a great friend of Serbia and the Serbian people and after the war decided to stay and live in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Upon the invitation of the Serbian Government, he carried out an inquiry on Hungarian, German and Bulgarian atrocities in Serbia during World War I and published the reports in European papers. He was part of the Serbian Government&#x27;s envoy at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919. He found propaganda postcards of the Austrian-Hungarian Army showing atrocities against Serbian people.

After the war, Reiss helped establish the first police academy in Serbia and teach forensic sciences. He was one of the founders of the Red Cross of Serbia. He became an honorary citizen of Krupanj in 1926.
In 1929 Reis enters in a street quarrel next to his house in Belgrade and had been beaten by his Serbian neighbour&#x27;s with wooden sticks. - He died before reaching the hospital.

After his death, his body was buried in the Topčider cemetery and, at his own request, his heart was buried on Kajmakčalan hill. The urn containing his heart was later demolished as revenge by the Bulgarians in World War II.

== Legacy ==
As a legacy to the Serbian people, he left an unpublished manuscript &quot;Ecoutez les Serbes!&quot; (&quot;Listen Serbs!&quot;, sr. &quot;Čujte Srbi!&quot;). It was finished on 1 June 1928, and in 2004 was printed in Serbia in a large number of copies and distributed for free.

Several streets across Serbia, particularly in Vojvodina carry his name. There is a primary school in Karaburma, Belgrade named after him. In November 2013, he was nominated for the French Forensic Science Hall of Fame by the Association Québécoise de Criminalistique.

<text>Deng Yaping (; born February 6, 1973) is a Chinese table tennis player, who won eighteen world championships including four Olympic championships between 1989 and 1997. She is regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.

==Early life and education==
Deng was born in Zhengzhou, Henan, on February 6, 1973.

== Career ==
Deng began playing table tennis aged five, and four years later she won the provincial junior championship. She was age 13 when she won her first national championship.

Despite her success, she was initially denied a spot on the national team because she was so short (she stood only 1.5 metres [4 feet 11 inches] tall). She was finally included on the national team in 1988. She teamed with Qiao Hong to win her first world championship title in the women&#x27;s doubles competition in 1989. Two years later in 1991, Deng won her first singles world championship.

At the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, she won a gold medal in both the singles and doubles competitions and repeated the feat at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, USA. She also earned singles and doubles titles at the 1995 and 1997 world championships.

When she retired at the age of 24, she had won more titles than any other player in this sport, including four Olympic gold medals, and had been World Champion 18 times. From 1990 to 1997, she retained the title of world No. 1 ranked female table tennis player for 8 years. She was voted Chinese female athlete of the century, and joined the International Table Tennis Federation Hall of Fame in 2003.

===Successes===
*40th World Table Tennis Championship (1989) Women&#x27;s Double Gold.
*1st Table Tennis World Cup (1990) Women&#x27;s Team Gold.
*41st World Table Tennis Championship (1991) Women&#x27;s Single Gold, Women&#x27;s Team Silver, Women&#x27;s Double Silver.
*2nd Table Tennis World Cup (1991–1992) Women&#x27;s Team Gold, Women&#x27;s Double Gold.
*25th Olympic Games (1992) Table Tennis Women&#x27;s Single Gold, Women&#x27;s Double Gold.
*42nd World Table Tennis Championship (1993) Women&#x27;s Team Gold, Women&#x27;s Double Silver.
*43rd World Table Tennis Championship (1995) Women&#x27;s Team Gold, Women&#x27;s Single Gold, Women&#x27;s Double Gold, Mixed Double Silver.
*4th Table Tennis World Cup (1995) Women&#x27;s Team Gold
*26th Olympic Games (1996) Table Tennis Women&#x27;s Single Gold, Women&#x27;s Double Gold.
*5th Table Tennis World Cup (1996) Women&#x27;s Single Gold
*44th World Table Tennis Championship (1997) Women&#x27;s Team Gold, Women&#x27;s Single Gold, Women&#x27;s Double Gold, Mixed Double Silver.

== Post-Playing Career ==
Deng is still deeply involved with the national Chinese table tennis scene and frequently speaks to the media. She also was a color-commentator for the Women&#x27;s World Cup in 2020. In June 2021, Deng claimed that Mima Ito was not a serious threat to the Chinese women&#x27;s Olympic hopes.

Deng was the CEO of Jike Search, a state-run search engine. Jike Search failed in 2013.

==Personal and Political Life==
After retiring at the end of the 1997 season, Deng served on the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s ethics and athletes commissions. She is also a member of the elite Laureus World Sports Academy, and a member of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference.

She gained a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Tsinghua University, an MRes degree in Contemporary Chinese Studies from the University of Nottingham in 2002, and a PhD degree in Land Economy from the University of Cambridge (Jesus College) in 2008. Her thesis title is: &quot;Olympic branding and global competition: the case of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games&quot;. Her research work coincides with her professional focus on the marketing, management and development of the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a member of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games.

In 2007, she married Lin Zhigang, also a table tennis player, and later gave birth to a baby boy.

In 2010, she attracted controversy due to comments she made. A student asked her, &quot;how can one get promoted quickly?&quot; She answered, &quot;when your personal value overlaps with the interests of the state, your value will be enlarged without limit.&quot; Later, she also said, &quot;In the 62 years since the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; have not published a single piece of fake news.&quot;

In 2013, she was awarded an honorary DLitt degree from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China.

<text>Buzz was a 2000-2005 Canadian comedy television series that aired on The Comedy Network. The show was hosted by &quot;Mista Mo&quot; (Morgan Oliver Smith) and Daryn Jones. The show originally aired from 1996-1999 as a community channel show on Rogers Television before getting a network deal in 1999. In 2001, the show won a Gemini Award in the &quot;Best Writing in a Comedy or Variety Program or Series&quot; category. The 2003 season saw them take the show to New York, London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. The show ended in 2005.

Created in Toronto, the show found a place on the Comedy Network when &quot;The Tom Green Show&quot; left to MTV. The show uses sketch comedy, non-sequiturs and guerrilla comedy. The two hosts, Daryn Jones, a geeky theatre major, and Mista Mo, an &quot;almost real rapper&quot; often riff on the racial tensions between them.

<doc id="526126" wikidata="Q3505260" url="?curid=526126" title="Cubic surface">
<text>In mathematics, a cubic surface is a surface in 3-dimensional space defined by one polynomial equation of degree 3. Cubic surfaces are fundamental examples in algebraic geometry. The theory is simplified by working in projective space rather than affine space, and so cubic surfaces are generally considered in projective 3-space formula_1. The theory also becomes more uniform by focusing on surfaces over the complex numbers rather than the real numbers; note that a complex surface has real dimension 4. A simple example is the Fermat cubic surface
:formula_2
in formula_1. Many properties of cubic surfaces hold more generally for del Pezzo surfaces.
==Rationality of cubic surfaces==
A central feature of smooth cubic surfaces &quot;X&quot; over an algebraically closed field is that they are all rational, as shown by Alfred Clebsch in 1866. That is, there is a one-to-one correspondence defined by rational functions between the projective plane formula_4 minus a lower-dimensional subset and &quot;X&quot; minus a lower-dimensional subset. More generally, every irreducible cubic surface (possibly singular) over an algebraically closed field is rational unless it is the projective cone over a cubic curve. In this respect, cubic surfaces are much simpler than smooth surfaces of degree at least 4 in formula_1, which are never rational. In characteristic zero, smooth surfaces of degree at least 4 in formula_1 are not even uniruled.

More strongly, Clebsch showed that every smooth cubic surface in formula_1 over an algebraically closed field is isomorphic to the blow-up of formula_4 at 6 points. As a result, every smooth cubic surface over the complex numbers is diffeomorphic to the connected sum formula_9, where the minus sign refers to a change of orientation. Conversely, the blow-up of formula_4 at 6 points is isomorphic to a cubic surface if and only if the points are in general position, meaning that no three points lie on a line and all 6 do not lie on a conic. As a complex manifold (or an algebraic variety), the surface depends on the arrangement of those 6 points.

==27 lines on a cubic surface==
Most proofs of rationality for cubic surfaces start by finding a line on the surface. (In the context of projective geometry, a line in formula_1 is isomorphic to formula_12.) More precisely, Arthur Cayley and George Salmon showed in 1849 that every smooth cubic surface over an algebraically closed field contains exactly 27 lines. This is a distinctive feature of cubics: a smooth quadric (degree 2) surface is covered by a continuous family of lines, while most surfaces of degree at least 4 in formula_1 contain no lines. Another useful technique for finding the 27 lines involves Schubert calculus which computes the number of lines using the intersection theory of the Grassmannian of lines on formula_1.

As the coefficients of a smooth complex cubic surface are varied, the 27 lines move continuously. As a result, a closed loop in the family of smooth cubic surfaces determines a permutation of the 27 lines. The group of permutations of the 27 lines arising this way is called the monodromy group of the family of cubic surfaces. A remarkable 19th-century discovery was that the monodromy group is neither trivial nor the whole symmetric group formula_15; it is a group of order 51840, acting transitively on the set of lines. This group was gradually recognized (by Élie Cartan (1896), Arthur Coble (1915–17), and Patrick du Val (1936)) as the Weyl group of type formula_16, a group generated by reflections on a 6-dimensional real vector space, related to the Lie group formula_16 of dimension 78.

The same group of order 51840 can be described in combinatorial terms, as the automorphism group of the graph of the 27 lines, with a vertex for each line and an edge whenever two lines meet. This graph was analyzed in the 19th century using subgraphs such as the Schläfli double six configuration. The complementary graph (with an edge whenever two lines are disjoint) is known as the Schläfli graph.
Many problems about cubic surfaces can be solved using the combinatorics of the formula_16 root system. For example, the 27 lines can be identified with the weights of the fundamental representation of the Lie group The possible sets of singularities that can occur on a cubic surface can be described in terms of subsystems of the formula_16 root system. One explanation for this connection is that the formula_16 lattice arises as the orthogonal complement to the anticanonical class formula_21 in the Picard group formula_22, with its intersection form (coming from the intersection theory of curves on a surface). For a smooth complex cubic surface, the Picard lattice can also be identified with the cohomology group formula_23.

An Eckardt point is a point where 3 of the 27 lines meet. Most cubic surfaces have no Eckardt point, but such points occur on a codimension-1 subset of the family of all smooth cubic surfaces.

Given an identification between a cubic surface on &quot;X&quot; and the blow-up of formula_4 at 6 points in general position, the 27 lines on &quot;X&quot; can be viewed as: the 6 exceptional curves created by blowing up, the birational transforms of the 15 lines through pairs of the 6 points in formula_4, and the birational transforms of the 6 conics containing all but one of the 6 points. A given cubic surface can be viewed as a blow-up of formula_4 in more than one way (in fact, in 72 different ways), and so a description as a blow-up does not reveal the symmetry among all 27 of the lines.

The relation between cubic surfaces and the formula_16 root system generalizes to a relation between all del Pezzo surfaces and root systems. This is one of many ADE classifications in mathematics. Pursuing these analogies, Vera Serganova and Alexei Skorobogatov gave a direct geometric relation between cubic surfaces and the Lie group formula_16.

In physics, the 27 lines can be identified with the 27 possible charges of M-theory on a six-dimensional torus (6 momenta; 15 membranes; 6 fivebranes) and the group E6 then naturally acts as the U-duality group. This map between del Pezzo surfaces and M-theory on tori is known as mysterious duality.

==Special cubic surfaces==
The smooth complex cubic surface in formula_1 with the largest automorphism group is the Fermat cubic surface, defined by
:formula_30
Its automorphism group is an extension formula_31, of order 648.

The next most symmetric smooth cubic surface is the Clebsch surface, which
can be defined in formula_32 by the two equations
:formula_33
Its automorphism group is the symmetric group formula_34, of order 120. After a complex linear change of coordinates, the Clebsch surface can also be defined by the equation
:formula_35
in formula_1.
Among singular complex cubic surfaces, Cayley&#x27;s nodal cubic surface is the unique surface with the maximal number of nodes, 4:
:formula_37
Its automorphism group is formula_38, of order 24.

==Real cubic surfaces==
In contrast to the complex case, the space of smooth cubic surfaces over the real numbers is not connected in the classical topology (based on the topology of R). Its connected components (in other words, the classification of smooth real cubic surfaces up to isotopy) were determined by Ludwig Schläfli (1863), Felix Klein (1865), and H. G. Zeuthen (1875). Namely, there are 5 isotopy classes of smooth real cubic surfaces &quot;X&quot; in formula_1, distinguished by the topology of the space of real points formula_40. The space of real points is diffeomorphic to either formula_41, or the disjoint union of formula_42 and the 2-sphere, where formula_43 denotes the connected sum of &quot;r&quot; copies of the real projective plane formula_44. In these five cases, the number of real lines contained in &quot;X&quot; is 27, 15, 7, 3, or 3, respectively.

A smooth real cubic surface is rational over R if and only if its space of real points is connected, hence in the first four of the previous five cases.

The average number of real lines on &quot;X&quot; is formula_45 when the defining polynomial for &quot;X&quot; is sampled at random from the Gaussian ensemble induced by the Bombieri inner product.

==The moduli space of cubic surfaces==
Two smooth cubic surfaces are isomorphic as algebraic varieties if and only if they are equivalent by some linear automorphism of formula_1. Geometric invariant theory gives a moduli space of cubic surfaces, with one point for each isomorphism class of smooth cubic surfaces. This moduli space has dimension 4. More precisely, it is an open subset of the weighted projective space P(12345), by Salmon and Clebsch (1860). In particular, it is a rational 4-fold.

==The cone of curves==
The lines on a cubic surface &quot;X&quot; over an algebraically closed field can be described intrinsically, without reference to the embedding of &quot;X&quot; in formula_1: they are exactly the (−1)-curves on &quot;X&quot;, meaning the curves isomorphic to formula_12 that have self-intersection −1. Also, the classes of lines in the Picard lattice of &quot;X&quot; (or equivalently the divisor class group) are exactly the elements &quot;u&quot; of Pic(&quot;X&quot;) such that formula_49 and formula_50. (This uses that the restriction of the hyperplane line bundle O(1) on formula_1 to &quot;X&quot; is the anticanonical line bundle formula_21, by the adjunction formula.)

For any projective variety &quot;X&quot;, the cone of curves means the convex cone spanned by all curves in &quot;X&quot; (in the real vector space formula_53 of 1-cycles modulo numerical equivalence, or in the homology group formula_54 if the base field is the complex numbers). For a cubic surface, the cone of curves is spanned by the 27 lines. In particular, it is a rational polyhedral cone in formula_55 with a large symmetry group, the Weyl group of formula_16. There is a similar description of the cone of curves for any del Pezzo surface.

==Cubic surfaces over a field==
A smooth cubic surface &quot;X&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; which is not algebraically closed need not be rational over &quot;k&quot;. As an extreme case, there are smooth cubic surfaces over the rational numbers Q (or the p-adic numbers formula_57) with no rational points, in which case &quot;X&quot; is certainly not rational. If &quot;X&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is nonempty, then &quot;X&quot; is at least unirational over &quot;k&quot;, by Beniamino Segre and János Kollár. For &quot;k&quot; infinite, unirationality implies that the set of &quot;k&quot;-rational points is Zariski dense in &quot;X&quot;.

The absolute Galois group of &quot;k&quot; permutes the 27 lines of &quot;X&quot; over the algebraic closure formula_58 of &quot;k&quot; (through some subgroup of the Weyl group of formula_16). If some orbit of this action consists of disjoint lines, then X is the blow-up of a &quot;simpler&quot; del Pezzo surface over &quot;k&quot; at a closed point. Otherwise, &quot;X&quot; has Picard number 1. (The Picard group of &quot;X&quot; is a subgroup of the geometric Picard group formula_60.) In the latter case, Segre showed that &quot;X&quot; is never rational. More strongly, Yuri Manin proved a birational rigidity statement: two smooth cubic surfaces with Picard number 1 over a perfect field &quot;k&quot; are birational if and only if they are isomorphic. For example, these results give many cubic surfaces over Q that are unirational but not rational.

== Singular cubic surfaces ==
In contrast to smooth cubic surfaces which contain 27 lines, singular cubic surfaces contain fewer lines. Moreover, they can be classified by the type of singularity which arises in their normal form. These singularities are classified using Dynkin diagrams.

=== Classification ===
A normal singular cubic surface formula_61 in formula_62 with local coordinates formula_63 is said to be in normal form if it is given by formula_64. Depending on the type of singularity formula_61 contains, it is isomorphic to the projective surface in formula_66 given by formula_64 where formula_68 are as in the table below. That means we can obtain a classification of all singular cubic surfaces. The parameters of the following table are as follows: formula_69 are three distinct elements of formula_70, the parameters formula_71 are in formula_72 and formula_73 is an element of formula_74. Notice that there are two different singular cubic surfaces with singularity formula_75.

In normal form, whenever a cubic surface formula_61 contains at least one formula_77 singularity, it will have an formula_77 singularity at formula_79.

=== Lines on singular cubic surfaces ===
According to the classification of singular cubic surfaces, the following table shows the number of lines each surface contains.
=== Automorphism groups of singular cubic surfaces with no parameters ===
An automorphism of a normal singular cubic surface formula_61 is the restriction of an automorphism of the projective space formula_66 to formula_61. Such automorphisms preserve singular points. Moreover, they do not permute singularities of different types. If the surface contains two singularities of the same type, the automorphism may permute them. The collection of automorphisms on a cubic surface forms a group, the so-called automorphism group. The following table shows all automorphism groups of singular cubic surfaces with no parameters.

<doc id="526129" wikidata="Q187871" url="?curid=526129" title="Kunlun Mountains">
<text>The Kunlun Mountains constitute one of the longest mountain chains in Asia, extending for more than . In the broadest sense, the chain forms the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau south of the Tarim Basin. Located in Western China, the Kunlun Mountains have been known as the &quot;Forefather of Mountains&quot; in China.

The exact definition of the Kunlun Mountains varies over time. Older sources used Kunlun to mean the mountain belt that runs across the center of China, that is, Altyn Tagh along with the Qilian and Qin Mountains. Recent sources have the Kunlun range forming most of the south side of the Tarim Basin and then continuing east, south of the Altyn Tagh. Sima Qian (&quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, scroll 123) says that Emperor Wu of Han sent men to find the source of the Yellow River and gave the name Kunlun to the mountains at its source. The name seems to have originated as a semi-mythical location in the classical Chinese text &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot;.

==Extent==
From the Pamirs of Tajikistan, the Kunlun Mountains run east through southern Xinjiang to Qinghai province. They stretch along the southern edge of what is now called the Tarim Basin, the infamous Taklamakan desert, and the Gobi Desert. A number of important rivers flow from the range including the Karakash River (&#x27;Black Jade River&#x27;) and the Yurungkash River (&#x27;White Jade River&#x27;), which flow through the Khotan Oasis into the Taklamakan Desert. To the south of the Kunlun is the sparsely populated Changtang region, which forms part of the Tibetan Plateau.
Altyn-Tagh or Altun Range is one of the chief northern ranges of the Kunlun. Its northeastern extension Qilian Shan is another main northern range of the Kunlun. In the south main extension is the Min Shan. Bayan Har Mountains, a southern branch of the Kunlun Mountains, forms the watershed between the catchment basins of China&#x27;s two longest rivers, the Yangtze River and the Yellow River.

The highest mountain of the Kunlun Mountains is the Kunlun Goddess Peak (7,167 m) in the Keriya area of the western Kunlun Mountains. 

Some authorities claim that the Kunlun extends further northwest-wards as far as Kongur Tagh (7,649 m) and the famous Muztagh Ata (7,546 m). 

But these mountains are physically much more closely linked to the Pamir group (ancient Mount Imeon). The Arka Tagh (Arch Mountain) is in the center of the Kunlun Mountains; its highest points are Ulugh Muztagh (6,973 m) and Bukadaban Feng (6,860 m). In the eastern Kunlun Mountains the highest peaks are Yuzhu Peak (6,224 m) and Amne Machin [also Dradullungshong] (6,282 m); the latter is the major eastern peak of the Kunlun Mountains and is thus considered as the eastern edge of the Kunlun Mountains.

The mountain range formed at the northern edges of the Cimmerian Plate during its collision, in the Late Triassic, with Siberia, which resulted in the closing of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean.

The range has very few roads and in its 3,000 km length is crossed by only two. In the west, Highway 219 traverses the range en route from Yecheng, Xinjiang to Lhatse, Tibet. Further east, Highway 109 crosses between Lhasa and Golmud.

Over 70 volcanic cones form the Kunlun Volcanic Group. They are not volcanic mountains, but cones. As such, they are not counted among the world volcanic mountain peaks. The group, however, musters the heights of above sea level (). If they were considered volcanic mountains, they would constitute the highest volcano in Asia and China and second highest in the Eastern Hemisphere (after Mount Kilimanjaro) and one of Volcanic Seven Summits by elevation. (Mount Damavand is the highest volcano in Asia, not the Kunlun cones.) The last known eruption in the volcanic group was on May 27, 1951.

==Mythology==
Legendary and mystical mountains are a long-standing aspect of Chinese civilization. Kunlun is originally the name of a mythical mountain believed to be a Taoist paradise.

Kunlun is a semi-mythical region not far from the source of the Yellow River. The Kunlun Mountains entered Chinese ideology during the Warring States period (475–221 BCE), and have become closely integrated into Chinese culture.

In the &quot;Book of Mountains and Seas&quot;, the Kunlun Mountains are mentioned:

Which means &quot;The hill of Kunlun, which is the capital of the emperor, and the god of the land.&quot;

Gu Jiegang divides the Chinese mythology system into the Kunlun system and the Penglai system based on the eastern and western regions. He believes that the myth of Kunlun
: &quot;originates in the western plateau, and its magical and magnificent stories spread to the east, and then follow the vast and boundless sea. The combination of these natural conditions has formed the Penglai mythology system in the coastal areas of Yan, Wu, Qi, and Yue.&quot;
In mythology, Kunlun Mountain is the birthplace and ancestral place of the Chinese nation. In mythology, Kunlun Mountain is the center of heaven and earth. It goes up to the sky and is the staircase to the sky. The &quot;Kunlun Mythology&quot; system takes Kunlun Mountain as an iconic place, and mainly focuses on the myths and stories of related characters such as the Yellow Emperor and the Queen Mother of the West (Xi Wang Mu). Stories such as Kuafu chasing the sun, Gonggong&#x27;s anger touching Buzhou Mountain, and Chang&#x27;e flying to the moon all originate from Kunlun mythology.

Mao Dun pointed out:
: &quot;The primitive people imagined that the gods lived in a group, and they also imagined that the gods lived on the extremely high mountains, so the highest mountain in the territory became the residence of the gods in mythology. The mystical idea of this is what happened. The Chinese myth is equivalent to that of Kunlun.

According to legend, King Mu (976–922 BCE, Zhou dynasty) was the first to visit this paradise. There he supposedly found the Jade Palace of the Yellow Emperor, the mythical originator of Chinese culture, and met Hsi Wang Mu (Xi Wang Mu, the &#x27;Spirit Mother of the West&#x27; usually called the &#x27;Queen Mother of the West&#x27;) who also had her mythical abode in these mountains. She was the object of a traditional religious cult which reached its peak in the Han dynasty.

<doc id="526130" wikidata="Q464612" url="?curid=526130" title="Bai Ling">
<text>Bai Ling (, born October 10, 1966) is a Chinese American actress and musician. She is best known for her work in the films &quot;The Crow&quot;, &quot;Nixon&quot;, &quot;Red Corner&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Dumplings&quot;, &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;Anna and the King&quot;, &quot;Southland Tales&quot;, and &quot;Maximum Impact&quot;, as well as TV shows &quot;Entourage&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot;. She won the Best Supporting Actress awards at the 2004 Hong Kong Film Awards and the 2004 Golden Horse Awards in Taiwan for her role in &quot;Dumplings&quot;.

==Early life==

Bai was born in Chengdu. Her father, Bai Yuxiang (), was a musician in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, and later a music teacher. Her mother, Chen Binbin (), was a dancer, stage actress, and literature teacher at Sichuan University; Bai&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a military officer of the Kuomintang army, thus was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. In the early 1980s, Bai Ling&#x27;s parents divorced, and her mother married renowned writer Xu Chi. Bai Ling has one older sister, Bai Jie (), who works for the Chinese tax bureau, and a younger brother, Bai Chen (), who emigrated to Japan and works for an American company.

Bai has described herself as a very shy child who found that she best expressed herself through acting and performing. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), she learned how to perform by participating in eight model plays, at her elementary school shows. After her graduation from middle school, Bai was sent to do labor work at Shuangliu, on the outskirts of Chengdu.

In 1978, after graduating from high school, she passed the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s exams, and became an artist soldier in Nyingchi Prefecture, Tibet. Her main activity there was entertaining in the musical theater. She also served briefly as an Army nurse. Bai later stated that during her time in Tibet, other female performers and she were regularly plied with alcohol and sexually abused by older male officers, including one instance of rape that led to a pregnancy she aborted. She cites this period of sexual abuse for her subsequent struggles with alcohol addiction. Subsequently, Bai spent some time in a mental hospital.

Soon after her release from the hospital, in 1981, Bai joined People&#x27;s Art Theater of Chengdu, and became a professional actress. Her performance as a young man in the stage play &quot;Yueqin and Little Tiger&quot; drew the attention of movie director Teng Wenji (滕文骥), which gained her first movie role in &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1985), as a village girl who becomes a factory worker and struggled against her father&#x27;s will for her to marry her cousin.

She temporarily moved to New York in 1991 to attend New York University&#x27;s film department as a visiting scholar, but later obtained a special visa that allowed her to remain in the United States until she became a U.S. citizen in 1999.

==Career==

Bai began her acting career in China, appearing in several Chinese feature films. In 1984, she made her film debut as a fishing village girl in the movie &quot;On the Beach&quot; (海滩). Later, she filmed several other movies, including &quot;Suspended Sentence&quot; (缓期执行), &quot;Yueyue&quot; (月月), and &quot;Tears in Suzhou&quot; (泪洒姑苏) without much attention. She became famous after playing a girl with a psychological disorder who has an affair with her doctor, in the film &quot;The Shining Arc&quot; (弧光), directed by Zhang Junzhao (张军钊), her most highly acclaimed role in the Chinese film industry. In 1991, Bai moved to the United States, where she appeared in a number of American films and television shows including the legendary soap opera Guiding Light alongside actress Melina Kanakaredes. 

Bai&#x27;s first major American film role was in &quot;The Crow&quot; (1994), where she played the half sister and lover of the main villain, Top Dollar. In 1997, she played the lead female role, opposite Richard Gere, in the American film &quot;Red Corner&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Bai Ling&#x27;s performance, saying that she gave the film &quot;not only grace, but also substantial gravity&quot;. For her role in &quot;Red Corner&quot;, she received the National Board of Review Freedom for Breakthrough Female Performance and the San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Actress. The film was critical of human rights abuse in China, and as a result, Bai Ling&#x27;s Chinese citizenship was revoked. She later became a U.S. citizen.

Bai was named one of &quot;People&quot;″s 50 Most Beautiful People in the World in 1998. She shaved off her hair, which was longer than 36 in (90 cm) for her role in &quot;Anna and the King&quot;, and is widely known in Thailand as &quot;Tuptim&quot;, her character&#x27;s name from the film, though the film is officially banned because of its depiction of the King of Siam. She filmed scenes for &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005) as Senator Bana Breemu, but her role was cut during editing. She claimed that this was because she appeared in the June 2005 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, whose appearance on newsstands coincided with the movie&#x27;s May 2005 release, but director George Lucas denied this, stating that the cut had been made more than a year earlier. Her scenes were included in the deleted scenes feature of the DVD release.

In 2004, Bai made a comeback to Chinese cinema, co-starring with Hong Kong actress Miriam Yeung in independent filmmaker Fruit Chan&#x27;s horror thriller &quot;Dumplings&quot;. Her portrayal of the villainous local chef Aunt Mei in the film earned her the 2005 Hong Kong Film Award for Best Supporting Actress, and led to her renewed popularity among the Chinese film audience. In the same year, she also received critical acclaim for her performance in another independent movie, &quot;The Beautiful Country&quot;, co-starring Nick Nolte, and directed by Hans Petter Moland.

Later in 2005, Bai was a member of the official jury at the 55th Berlin International Film Festival. On television, she was a cast member on the VH1 program called &quot;But Can They Sing?&quot;. Also in 2005, Bai guest-starred in season two of &quot;Entourage&quot; in which she played a love interest of Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier).

In 2007, she starred as Coco in the film adaptation of the controversial Chinese contemporary novel &quot;Shanghai Baby&quot;, which premiered at Cannes Film Festival, and also guest-starred in one episode (&quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;) of the show &quot;Lost&quot;. Since 2007, she has appeared in a number of films, including &quot;Love Ranch&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;A Beautiful Life&quot;, although she became more well known for her red-carpet appearances and outrageous fashions.

In 2013, Bai enjoyed a career resurgence with the movie &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Game of Assassins&quot;), which earned her the Best Actress award at the Los Angeles Cinema Festival of Hollywood, and at the 2014 Asians On Film Festival. Also, for &quot;Speed Dragon&quot;, she received the Best Feature Film Award at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. In late 2014, Bai starred alongside David Arquette in &quot;The Key&quot;, Jefery Levy&#x27;s adaptation of the novel by Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki. In October 2014, Bai was a member of the jury in the &quot;India Gold 2014&quot; section of the Mumbai Film Festival.

In 2017, Bai took part in the short film &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot; by Rui Cui, which won her second Best Actress win at the Asians On Film Festival. Subsequently in 2019, after 15 years since their collaboration in &quot;Dumplings&quot;, director Fruit Chan and Bai worked together again in &quot;The Abortionist&quot; (墮胎師). For her performance Bai obtained her second nomination at the Golden Horse Film Festival as Best Actress. She also enjoyed a new success in independent horror movies such as &quot;Exorcism at 60,000 Feet&quot; (2019) and &quot;Unspeakable: Beyond the Wall of Sleep&quot; (2024). Bai was also awarded in Italy the Milan Gold Awards Best Actress prize for &quot;Jack Be Nimble&quot; (2022), another horror film.

==Personal life==
On February 14, 2008, Bai was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport for shoplifting. Bai stated it was an &quot;emotionally crazy&quot; day due to the breakup of a relationship, and was ordered to pay a fine and penalties after pleading guilty in March 2008 to disturbing the peace.

In a 2009 interview, Bai claimed that she is from the Moon, where her grandmother lives. &quot;I&#x27;m not really in reality. I&#x27;m in my own universe and my mind is a million miles somewhere else&quot;, she stated, further explaining: &quot;Why I feel like I come from the Moon is because my mother told me I was found somewhere&quot;. She believes that when she looks up at the Moon, she can often spot her grandmother there, still living in her childhood home.

In 2011, she appeared in the fifth season of the VH1 reality television series &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, which documented her recovery from alcohol addiction. In a 2011 interview regarding her public image and troubles over the years, she stated:
When Bai first came to the United States, before she became fluent in English, she was initially confused by people asking if she was bi (as in bisexual), as the word is homophonous with &quot;Bai&quot;. After the miscommunication was clarified, she subsequently affirmed that she is bisexual and that gender is not relevant to who she is attracted to.

<doc id="526131" wikidata="Q373169" url="?curid=526131" title="Nikkō Shōnin">
<text>, Buddhist name , was one of the six senior disciples of Nichiren and was the former Chief Priest of Kuon-ji temple in Mount Minobu, Japan. Various Nichiren sects in Japan claim to have been founded by Nikkō, the most prominent being Nichiren Shōshū and some lineages within Nichiren Shū. 

Nikkō kept meticulous records and highly organized religious practice during his lifetime, and is responsible for much of the records that survive today. Nikkō singularly upheld the doctrine that Nichiren was the &quot;True and Eternal Buddha&quot; in the Third Age of Buddhism and therefore is considered by schools stemming from Nikkō such Nichiren Shōshū and the Soka Gakkai as the legitimate successor to the ministry and legacy of Nichiren. 

Nikko established the Head Temple Taisekiji at Fujinomiya in 1290, as well as enshrining the Dai Gohonzon image. In 1332, four months before his death, he designated Nichimoku Shonin as his successor. The grave of Nikkō remains today in Kitayama Honmonji, Omosu, in Suruga Province where he lived for thirty-six years, establishing a Buddhist seminary that affiliated in the Hokke shū (法華宗) religion. The &quot;Koshi-E&quot; memorial feast of his death anniversary is commemorated on February 6 (&quot;Nichiren Shoshu O-tai-ya&quot;) and February 7 (&quot;Gosho-to-e ceremony&quot;).

==Early life==

Nikkō was born at Kajikazawa in Koma District of Kai Province. His father, Oi-no Kitsuroku was from Totsumi province and later moved to Kai province while maintaining his Samurai career. He died when Nikkō was a child. Nikkō&#x27;s mother was Myofuku Tsunashima () and was from what is now Shizuoka Prefecture. He was raised by his grandfather, Nyudo Yui. As a child, he entered the Tendai temple Shijuku-in, in Fujiwakabacho, Iwabuchi Ichirizuka. He took the acolyte name, &quot;Hōki-bō&quot; and received his education here, which as well as Tendai doctrine, included Chinese classics, Japanese literature, poetry, calligraphy, as well as other subjects.

==As Nichiren’s disciple==

In 1257, Nichiren visited &quot;Jisso-ji&quot; Temple closely affiliated with &quot;Shijuku-in&quot; Temple where he studied various Buddhist sutras in its library for his treatise &quot;Risshō Ankoku Ron&quot; (立正安国論, English: &quot;On Establishing the Correct teaching for the Peace of the Land&quot;). Nikkō served Nichiren here, and vowed to become his disciple. In addition, Nikkō also accompanied Nichiren on his two exiles.

Nikkō is also credited with preserving many of Nichiren&#x27;s voluminous writings. He was particularly careful to ensure the survival of Nichiren&#x27;s many letters written in simple characters (Kana) for uneducated followers. He was also instrumental in gaining Nichimoku to become a junior disciple of Nichiren.

On 8 October 1282, Nikkō became one of the six senior priests whom Nichiren designated to carry on his faith after his death. “On the eighth day of the tenth month, he designated six senior priests to act as key figures and take responsibility for propagation in their respective areas. They were, in order of their conversion, Nisshō, Nichirō, Nikkō, Nikō, Nitchō, and Nichiji”. According to various Nichiren school that claim Nikko as their founder, on October 13, 1282, Nichiren further designated Nikkō the chief priest of Kuon-ji, the temple at Mt. Minobu in Yamanashi Prefecture, where Nichiren had spent the last years of his life as purportedly recorded in a transfer document called &quot;Minobu-zan Fuzoku-sho&quot; (&quot;Document entrusting Mt. Minobu&quot;); however, the authenticity of this document is disputed by some Nichiren schools. Later that same day, Nichiren died at Ikegami, now part of Tokyo.

At Minobu Nikkō recorded the “lectures on the Lotus Sutra” that the Daishonin gave to his disciples and compiled them as &quot;The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings&quot; (OTT). After the Daishonin’s passing, Nikkō Shōnin collected and copied his teacher’s writings, which he called the &quot;Gosho&quot;, or &quot;honorable writings&quot;.

Following Nichiren&#x27;s 100th day funeral ceremonies, Nikkō left Ikegami on October 21 to carry Nichiren&#x27;s ashes back to Mount Minobu, arriving on October 25. On the centenarian anniversary of Nichiren&#x27;s death, Nikkō, the other five senior priests, and their disciples conducted a 100th-day memorial service, after which the others departed for their own territories where they were most active. Nikkō carried out his duties as chief priest of Kuon-ji, teaching disciples and looking after the laity. Central to his work was attending, cleaning and maintaining Nichiren&#x27;s tomb, and collecting and cataloguing Nichiren&#x27;s many writings for preservation and perpetuation.

==Isolation from other disciples==

Latter feelings of animosity and discord grew after the second death anniversary of Nichiren&#x27;s 100th Day Memorial ceremony (23 January 1283) when, according to Nikko, the rotation system agreed in the &quot;Shuso Gosenge
Kiroku&quot; (English: Record document of founder&#x27;s demise) and &quot;Rembo Cho&quot; (English: Rotation Wheel System) to clean and maintain Nichiren&#x27;s grave, was being abandoned by the other five senior disciples.

By the third anniversary of Nichiren&#x27;s death (13 October 1284), Nikkō claimed that the other five senior priests no longer returned to Nichiren&#x27;s tomb in Mount Minobu, citing the deer hoofs and other signs of neglect at the gravesite. In addition, Nikkō accused that after Nichiren&#x27;s death, the other disciples slowly began to deviate from Nichiren&#x27;s teachings.
Chief among these complaints was the syncretism by some of the disciples to worship images of both Shakyamuni Buddha while admonishing other disciple priests for signing their names &quot;Tendai Shamon&quot; of the Tendai Buddhist school in the subsequent documents notarized and sent to the Kamakura government. Furthermore, Nikko alleged that the other disciples became condescending towards some of Nichiren&#x27;s writings because they were not written in Classical Chinese, but in the Japanese Katakana syllabary, which was deemed inferior at the time. Accordingly, Nikko Shonin claimed that the other senior disciples permitted Gohonzons originally inscribed by Nichiren to be buried with lay and priestly disciples, a highly controversial practice accused by the Head Temple Taisekiji to be sacrilegious and impermissible to present time. 

The steward of the temple district, &quot;Hagiri Sanenaga&quot;, who had been converted by Nikkō, also began to commit unorthodox practices which Nikkō deemed to be heretical, such as the following:

# The crafting of a standing statue of Shakyamuni Buddha as an object of worship.
# The donation of noren shrine curtains and horses to the Mishima Taisha Shinto shrine, at the time an honorary shrine of the Hōjō-clan shogunate.
# The procurement of bamboo lumber for the Shinto Gassan Shrine.
# The attendance of a memorial service dedicated to the stupa of Amida Buddha along with giving monetary donations to its Nembutsu priests in Fukushi ward, Nanbu, Yamanashi Prefecture.

These controversial acts received tolerance from another senior disciple, &quot;Mimbu Nikō&quot; (民 部 日 向, 1253–1314) to be acceptable due to having been done ordinarily with the knowledge of Nichiren while he was alive. Accordingly, Hagiri Sanenaga provided his own personal reason that it was customary for his political family to make homage to the Shinto shrine of the Kamakura Shogunate, as well as reasoning that he had provided monetary donations to other Buddhist schools even when Nichiren himself was alive.

Such developments eventually led Nikkō to conclude that Nichiren&#x27;s enlightened entity no longer resided at Mount Minobu. Furthermore, he entered a state of mental depression and deeply felt that Kuon-ji Temple was no longer the place for perpetuating Nichiren&#x27;s teachings, causing him to pack up his personal belongings, the Dai Gohonzon mandala and some venerated relics belonging to Nichiren to depart, never to return. Nikkō left Mount Minobu with a group of select disciples in the spring of 1289. &quot;Nanjo Shichijo-jiro Tokimitsu&quot;, a lay believer residing near Mount Fuji took great pity on Nikko Shonin and his disciples and offered them sanctuary to stay, later donating a tract of land for a new temple that became Taiseki-ji Temple. Taiseki-ji is today the head temple of the Nichiren Shōshū school and, since its founding on 12 October 1290, has been a major center of the Kōmon-ha (興門派, also called the 富士派: Fuji-ha) branch of Nichiren Buddhism, as the schools stemming from Nikkō were traditionally known.

Upon nearing death on 10 November 1332, Nikkō named his disciple Nichimoku (1260–1333) as his successor and passed onto him the &quot;Ozagawari Gohonzon&quot;, inscribed in 8 April 1308 for the memorial honor of the martyr “Jinshiro”, approximately 14 years after the persecution of Hei No Saimon Yoritsuna. This mandala is now enshrined inside the Dai-Kyakuden, along with his Juzu beads made of Crystal and Shimamenu Onyx which are now preserved in the Gohozo building of Taisekiji.

For the remaining 36 years of his life, Nikkō then retired a few miles away to Omosu, Suruga Province where he founded a seminary and temple, Kitayama Honmon-ji belonging to Hokke-shū (法華宗) school, and concentrated on training disciples until his death in the second lunar month of 1333 at the age of 87. A grave claiming to house the ash remains of Nikkō Shōnin is located in Kitayama Honmonji Temple in Suruga Province. After his death within this same temple, a statue image of the solar goddess Amaterasu Omi-Kami and the protector god Hachiman was enshrined, donated by some early Hokkekō believers. Such sculptural images are considered only decorative in present teachings of the Nichiren Shōshū school.

==Buddhist articles claimed to have been brought to Taisekiji Temple==

According to the doctrinal beliefs of Nichiren Shōshū, Nikkō Shonin left Mount Minobu with several articles pertaining to Nichiren, namely the following:
* The Dai Gohonzon Mandala
* Transfer inheritance documents of his legitimacy as chief priest of Kuon-ji and as successor
* Several Gohonzon mandalas inscribed by Nichiren
* Remaining partial bones (17 pieces) and cremated ashes of Nichiren
* The &quot;Go-Nikuge&quot;, surviving tooth dentures belonging to Nichiren
* A dragon candlestick, &quot;koro&quot; incense burner and vase Nichiren used when summoning rain during times of drought for the peasant devotees.
* The statue of Nichiren Daishōnin currently enshrined within the Hoando Warehouse.
* The compilations of Ongi Kuden, (now lost to history).

== Claim to the successorship of Nichiren==
Some followers of the Nichiren schools stemming from Nikkō, in particular the Nichiren Shōshū school, as well as the Soka Gakkai, view Nikkō as the legitimate successor to Nichiren. They base this claim on a document dated the ninth lunar month of 1282 called the &quot;Nichiren ichigo guhō fuzoku-sho&quot; (“Document Entrusting the Law that Nichiren Propagated throughout His Life”). In this document, Nichiren entrusts the &quot;entirety of his lifetime of teaching&quot; to Nikkō and names him the &quot;Great Master of propagation of the essential teaching&quot;. These documents contained in a treasure box are alleged to have been stolen by clan head Takeda Katsuyori on behalf of the Nishiyama Temple, a faction of Nichiren Shū during the 15th century via force.

Nikkō also designated six new disciples (Nichidai, Nitchō, Nichidō, Nichimyō, Nichigō, and Nichijo), whom he charged with the task of propagation after his death.

Other Nichiren lineages based on the other original five senior disciples vehemently reject this claim of successorship, as they claim the surviving document does not exist in Nichiren&#x27;s hand or any of his immediate disciples, rather copied down by Nikko&#x27;s extant disciples. Instead, such schools claim that Nikko was only a resident priest in Kuonji Temple before 1285, and later became the Chief Priest of that temple from 1285–1289, just before he moved to the Fujinomiya area.

Some of Nikkō&#x27;s direct disciples also eventually spawned schools that deviated to some degree or another from his own doctrines, often due to political pressure or internal power plays going back and forth to separating or rejoining the Nikko-related temples of the Fujinomiya area before and after the Second World War.

== Original Japanese terms ==
#身延山付嘱書, also called the &quot;Ikegami sōjō&quot; (池上相承) &quot;Succession document [written at] Ikegami&quot;
#日蓮一期弘法付嘱書: &quot;Nichiren ichigo guhō fuzoku-sho&quot;
#日蓮一期の弘法: &quot;Nichiren ichigo no guhō&quot;
#本門弘通の大導師: &quot;Honmon Guzū no Daidōshi&quot;

<text>Antoine-Vincent, chevalier Arnault (1 January 176616 September 1834) was a French playwright.

== Life ==
Arnault was born in Paris. His first play, &quot;Marius à Minturne&quot; (1791), immediately established his reputation. A year later he followed with a second republican tragedy, &quot;Lucrèce&quot;. Arnault left France during the Reign of Terror, but on his return, he was arrested by the revolutionary authorities. He was freed through the intervention of Fabre d&#x27;Églantine and others. He was commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1797 with the organization of the French rule in the Ionian Islands, and was nominated to the Institute and made secretary general of the university. Elected to the Académie Française in 1803, he&#x27;s excluded from it by ordinance in 1816, after the monarchy was restored, and reelected in 1829. Arnault was faithful to his patron through his misfortunes, and after the Hundred Days remained in exile until 1819. Arnault died at Goderville.

Other plays of Arnault&#x27;s are: &quot;Blanche et Moncassin, ou les Vénitiens&quot; (1798); and &quot;Germanicus&quot; (1816), the performance of which was the occasion of a disturbance in the parterre which threatened serious political complications. His tragedies are now less well known than his &quot;Fables&quot; (1813, 1815 and 1826), which are written in graceful verse. Arnault collaborated a &quot;Vie politique et militaire de Napoléon 1er&quot; (1822), and wrote some very interesting &quot;Souvenirs d&#x27;un sexagénaire&quot; (4 vols, 1833), which contain much out-of-the-way information about the history of the years previous to 1804. Arnault&#x27;s &quot;Œuvres complètes&quot; (4 vols.) were published at the Hague and Paris in 1818-9, and again (8 vols.) at Paris in 1824.

Arnault&#x27;s eldest son, Emilien Lucien Arnault (1787–1863), wrote several tragedies, the leading rôles in which were interpreted by Talma.

<text>Christopher Roy Sutton (born 10 March 1973) is an English former professional football player and manager. He later became a pundit, commentator and presenter of football coverage on television and radio.

Sutton played from 1991 to 2007 for Norwich City, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Celtic, Birmingham City and Aston Villa. Sutton scored over 150 career goals in over 400 league appearances spanning 16 years in the English and Scottish Premier Leagues. Initially a defender, while at Norwich, he successfully moved to playing as a striker. He won the Premier League in 1995 with Blackburn Rovers and was capped once by England. He was also known as one of the foremost exponents of the glancing header, scoring many goals with this technique, which made him particularly effective from set-pieces.

In September 2009, Sutton was appointed manager of Lincoln City, but he resigned for personal reasons twelve months later. In 2012, he came out of retirement briefly and featured for non-league Wroxham.

==Early life==
Chris Sutton was born on 10 March 1973 in Nottingham, East Midlands, England, the son of Mike Sutton, formerly a footballer with Norwich City. His younger brother John also became a footballer, and has played for a number of clubs in both England and Scotland. As a child, he moved with his family from East Leake in Nottinghamshire to Horsford in Norfolk.

==Playing career==

===Norwich City (1991–1994)===
Sutton started his career as a professional footballer at Norwich City, initially as a centre-half before being converted into a striker by manager Dave Stringer. He made his debut on 4 May 1991 in a 1–0 home win over Queens Park Rangers in the First Division.

In Stringer&#x27;s final season as manager, 1991–92, when Norwich reached the FA Cup semi-finals, Sutton gradually broke into the first team. He made 21 league appearances that season, scoring twice.

Sutton found success in his new position as Norwich spent most of the first season of the new FA Premier League, in 1992–93, as league leaders, before eventually slipping to third place under new manager Mike Walker. Sutton featured in 38 Premier League games that season, scoring eight goals, which made him the club&#x27;s second-highest scorer behind Mark Robins.

In the autumn of 1993, Sutton was part of the side that eliminated Bayern Munich from the UEFA Cup, while he scored 25 Premier League goals in the 1993/94 season. After manager Walker went to Everton, in January 1994, and succeeded by assistant John Deehan, Norwich slipped out of the top five and finished in the 12th position. At that time, Sutton was being linked with other clubs, including Blackburn Rovers, Arsenal and Manchester United.

===Blackburn Rovers (1994–1999)===
Sutton became the most expensive player in English football in July 1994, when he was transferred from Norwich City to Blackburn Rovers for £5 million.
In his first season at Ewood Park, he developed a partnership (known as &#x27;SAS&#x27;) with Alan Shearer and scored 15 Premier League goals, helping Blackburn Rovers to secure their first top-league title since 1914.

A succession of injuries, combined with a loss of form, saw Sutton making only 13 Premier League appearances during the 1995–96 season and failing to score a single league goal. Shearer&#x27;s regular strike partner that season became Mike Newell, but, at the end of the season, both Shearer and Newell departed from the club, leaving Sutton and Kevin Gallacher as Blackburn&#x27;s only major strikers.

Sutton regained his form over the next three seasons, achieving joint highest goalscoring place in the Premier League in 1997–98, by scoring 18 times.

Sutton was involved in a controversial moment towards the end of the 1996–97 season in a league game against Arsenal at Highbury. Late in the game, with &quot;The Gunners&quot; leading by a single goal, the ball was kicked out of play by Arsenal to allow an injured teammate to receive treatment. Under the unwritten sportsmanship rule, Arsenal would expect the ball to be returned to them unhindered. Sutton chased the ball instead of allowing it to be thrown back to Arsenal and won a corner from his efforts, from which Blackburn scored. At the end of the season, Arsenal missed out on a lucrative place in the Champions League to Newcastle United on goal difference. Following the incident, Blackburn&#x27;s interim manager Tony Parkes described Sutton as &quot;a boy who was sometimes a bit dizzy ... a bit silly&quot;, stating &quot;It was against the spirit of the game and he should not have done it&quot;.

Sutton refused to apologise for his action.

Although, in 1997/98, Sutton&#x27;s 18 goals helped Blackburn finish sixth in the League and qualify for the UEFA Cup, he managed just 17 league games and three goals the following season, 1998–99, as they were relegated four years after being crowned champions.

===Chelsea (1999–2000)===
Sutton was sold to Chelsea for £10 million after Blackburn&#x27;s relegation. His time at Stamford Bridge proved an unhappy one, as he struggled both to live up to the price tag and to adapt to Chelsea&#x27;s style of play, scoring just one league goal; in the 5–0 win against Manchester United in 28 appearances, and 3 goals in total, the other 2 coming from one goal against Skonto Riga in a Champions League qualifier, and one against Hull City in the FA Cup. He failed to even make the bench for the club&#x27;s FA Cup Final win against Aston Villa. In July 2000, he was sold to Scottish Premier League side Celtic for £6 million.

===Celtic (2000–2006)===
Sutton regained his goal-scoring form at Celtic. He scored the winner on his league debut in a 2–1 win against Dundee United in July 2000, but was then sent off in his second appearance against Motherwell. Sutton endeared himself to Celtic fans four weeks later in his first Old Firm match against Rangers – scoring the first and last goals in a dramatic 6–2 victory for Celtic. Sutton went on to form a prolific partnership with Swede Henrik Larsson.

Sutton&#x27;s goals helped Celtic win three SPL titles, three Scottish Cups and one Scottish League Cup, as well as reaching the UEFA Cup final. Many of Sutton&#x27;s most &quot;memorable goals&quot; for Celtic were scored in European competition: Against Ajax away in 2001, Juventus at Celtic Park the same year, away against Blackburn Rovers, and against VfB Stuttgart during the team&#x27;s UEFA Cup run to the final in Seville in 2003, and the volley from close range against Barcelona at Celtic Park in 2004.

Sutton holds the record for the quickest goal ever in an Old Firm clash, scored at Ibrox in 2002, hitting the net inside of 18 seconds.

Sutton&#x27;s nature came to the fore again at the end of the 2002–03 season when he accused Dunfermline Athletic of &quot;lying down&quot;, in order for Celtic to lose the title. He failed to apologise and was charged with &quot;bringing the game into disrepute.&quot; He received for the non-apology statement a one-match ban to add to the four-match suspension he was serving for abusing match officials on the same day.

Sutton&#x27;s best season at Celtic was arguably the 2003–04 season, when he scored 19 SPL goals. and was voted SPFA Player of the Year. As the 2003–04 season drew to a conclusion, he struck the injury-time winner against Rangers at Celtic Park, giving his side a clean sweep of victories against their rivals that season (four league wins and one Scottish Cup win).

In Sutton&#x27;s five and a half years at Celtic, Sutton showed versatility on many occasions. Although primarily a striker, he was often deployed in central midfield to allow Welsh striker John Hartson to play up front alongside Larsson. On occasion, Sutton was fielded in his original position of centre-half, notably against Rangers in a league game on 4 October 2003, which Celtic won 1–0.

As Gordon Strachan took up the reins of managing Celtic in 2005–06, his appearances for Celtic became more sporadic. Sutton departed from Celtic on a free transfer in January 2006.

===Birmingham City (2006)===
Sutton joined Premier League club Birmingham City in January 2006, but injuries restricted him to just eleven appearances and one goal, scored in the derby defeat to Aston Villa in mid-April. One of a number of players on high wages subjected to criticism by club owner David Sullivan, Sutton was released at the end of the season following Birmingham&#x27;s relegation to the Championship.

===Aston Villa (2006–2007)===
In October 2006, Sutton signed until the end of the 2006–07 season with Birmingham City&#x27;s arch rivals Aston Villa, managed by former Celtic boss Martin O&#x27;Neill. He scored his first goal for the club with the winner against Everton in November 2006.

However, in a game against Manchester United in December 2006, he suffered blurred vision and, despite visiting several specialists, did not recover. O&#x27;Neill said, &quot;Chris has got a genuine concern. No-one can give him any guarantees about what might be the consequences if he got cracked on the head again. Whatever eyesight Chris has now, he would obviously want to keep, so he must bear that in mind when deciding his whole future and career.&quot; On 5 July 2007, after an eye injury, Sutton retired from football.

===Wroxham (2012)===
Six years after the reckoning in the Man United game, in October 2012, and his 2007 retirement, Sutton made a surprise appearance in the Isthmian League Division One North squad of Wroxham, coming on in the 63rd minute of the Yachtsmen&#x27;s home game in Trafford Park against Tilbury, as a substitute. His goalkeeper son Oliver had already substituted the Wroxham goalkeeper, when the latter got injured in the first half. The home side lost the game 2-3.

==International career==
Sutton&#x27;s form for Blackburn won him an England cap on 15 November 1997, when he came on in the 79th minute against Cameroon, although he was left out of the World Cup squad after a fall-out with national manager Glenn Hoddle. Having been relegated to the England B team Sutton refused to play, and Hoddle never selected Sutton for an England squad again.

==Management career==

===Lincoln City===
Sutton was interviewed in January 2009 by Inverness Caledonian Thistle for the post of manager, but was unsuccessful. On 28 September 2009, Sutton was appointed manager of League Two side Lincoln City, succeeding Peter Jackson who was dismissed earlier in the month. Despite having no managerial experience, Sutton was preferred to more than 70 other applicants. Caretaker manager Simon Clark would take charge of the following day&#x27;s game, with Sutton and assistant Ian Pearce to take over the day after.

Sutton&#x27;s first game as manager came at Sincil Bank against Aldershot Town on 3 October 2009. Lincoln were victorious through a second half Sergio Torres goal to give Sutton a winning start in management. Sutton took Lincoln to the FA Cup third round for the first time since 1999, but lost 4–0 to Premier League outfit Bolton Wanderers. Football League survival was confirmed on 24 April 2010 when Sutton guided the Imps to a 1–0 victory over promotion-chasing Bury at Sincil Bank, with two games remaining. Sutton left his post as Lincoln manager on 29 September due to family reasons.

==Media career==
Sutton acted as a main co-commentator, including on all of Celtic FC&#x27;s UEFA Champions League games, alongside either Rob MacLean or Rory Hamilton for TNT Sports, leaving in 2023 to join Sky Sports, again working as pundit and co-commentator for the channels Scottish football coverage. He also works as a pundit and co-commentator for BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sport. He also presents 606 for BBC Radio 5 Live, currently alongside Robbie Savage. In January 2015, Sutton attracted criticism for saying that Celtic&#x27;s Scottish League Cup semi-final against Rangers would be &quot;so one-sided&quot; that Celtic &quot;could win it blindfolded&quot;.

==Personal life==
As of February 2007, Sutton was married with five children.

After retiring from football, Sutton remained an athlete, playing cricket for Norwich Cricket Club in the EAPL.

In July 2000, Sutton was convicted of two charges of common assault and fined £300 plus costs after an incident outside a restaurant in which he spat in the face of another man.

In February 2022, Sutton and Micah Richards spoke about mental health issues in their playing days.

<text>Karl Ludwig Edler von Littrow (18 July 1811 – 16 November 1877) was an Austrian astronomer.

Born in Kazan, Russian Empire, he was the son of astronomer Joseph Johann Littrow. He studied mathematics and astronomy at the universities of Vienna and Berlin, receiving his doctorate at the University of Krakow in 1832. In 1842 he succeeded his father as director of the Vienna Observatory. Under his leadership, construction of a new observatory began in Währing in 1872; he died, however, prior to its completion. He was the husband of Auguste von Littrow and the father of Otto von Littrow.

He died in Venice, Italy.

He is the great-great-grandfather of Roman Catholic Cardinal Christoph Schönborn.
