<text>Alan Harrison Berg (January 1934 – June 18, 1984) was an American talk radio show host in Denver, Colorado. Born to a Jewish family, he had outspoken atheistic and liberal views and a confrontational interview style. Berg was assassinated by members of the white supremacist group The Order, which believed in killing all Jews and sending all black people to Africa. Those involved in the killing were part of a group planning to kill prominent Jews such as Berg. Two of Berg&#x27;s killers, David Lane and Bruce Pierce, were convicted on charges of federal civil rights violations for killing him. They were sentenced to 190 years and 252 years in prison, respectively.

==Early life==
Berg was a native of Chicago, Illinois. There are conflicting reports on his exact birthdate, typically being reported as January 1 or January 18, while Berg&#x27;s birth record gives the date as January 9. He was the eldest of two children to Joseph Berg (1897–1983), an English-born dentist, and Ruth Kanter (1909–1994), a clothing shop owner from St. Louis. The family was Jewish, but according to Berg, his father hid their faith from clients and neighbors. Berg graduated high school at 17 and married Judith Lee Berg (&quot;née&quot; Halpern) in 1951. They annulled the marriage after 30 days, but remarried in 1958. The couple had no children and divorced in 1978.

He attended the University of Colorado Denver before transferring to the University of Denver. At age 22, Berg was one of the youngest people to pass the Illinois state bar examination and he went into practice in Chicago. However, he began to experience neuromuscular seizures and had become an alcoholic. His wife convinced him to quit his practice to seek help. They moved to Denver, her hometown, and he entered rehabilitation voluntarily. Although he completed his treatment, he continued to be plagued by seizures. He was ultimately diagnosed with a brain tumor. After it was surgically removed, he made a full recovery. For the rest of his life, Berg wore long bangs to hide the surgical scars.

==Radio career==
Berg worked at a shoe store and later opened a clothing store in Denver where he met KGMC talk show host Laurence Gross. Impressed with Berg, Gross made him a guest on several occasions. When Gross left KGMC to take a job in San Diego, California, he requested that Alan Berg be named his successor.

From KGMC, which changed its call sign to KWBZ, Berg moved to KHOW, also in Denver. After being fired from KHOW, Berg went back to KWBZ before it changed to an all-music format and he again lost his job. The unemployed Berg was courted by both KTOK in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and a station in Detroit, Michigan. He was hired by KOA (AM) and debuted on February 23, 1981. He worked at KOA until his death.

His program could be received in more than 30 states. Berg, who held liberal social and political views, became known for upsetting some callers to the point they began sputtering, whereupon he would berate them. Clarissa Pinkola Estés of the Moderate Voice website wrote in 2007: &quot;He didn&#x27;t pick on the poor, the frail, the undefended: He chose Roderick Elliot and Frank &quot;Bud&quot; Farell, who wrote &quot;The Death of the White Race&quot; and &quot;Open Letter to the Gentiles&quot;, and other people from the white supremacist groups... the groups who openly espoused hatred of blacks, Jews, leftists, homosexuals, Hispanics, other minorities and religious groups&quot;.

On March 5, 1982, Berg tried to interview Ellen Kaplan, a member of the LaRouche movement, about an incident that had happened on February 7, 1982, at Newark International Airport. Kaplan had recognized Henry Kissinger, who was on his way to Boston to undergo a coronary artery bypass operation, and shouted an abusive question at him (&quot;Is it true that you sleep with young boys at The Carlyle Hotel?&quot;), whereupon his wife Nancy attacked Kaplan. During his program, Berg called Kaplan on the phone. When she answered, he introduced her as “a vile human being” and praised Nancy Kissinger&#x27;s attack on her. After Kaplan hung up, Berg continued to ridicule Kaplan and abuse her verbally for the remainder of the program. Afterwards, KOA received complaints from listeners and Kaplan&#x27;s boyfriend, and on suggestion of the lawyers of the station owners General Electric, the station management suspended Berg from work for a few days. After returning to work, Berg toned down his methods somewhat.

==Assassination and aftermath==
At about 9:30 p.m. on June 18, 1984, Berg returned to his Adams Street townhouse after a dinner date with Judith, with whom he was attempting reconciliation. Berg stepped out of his black Volkswagen Beetle and gunfire erupted with Berg being shot twelve times, including five shots that entered and exited his head. Berg was officially pronounced dead at the scene at 9:45 p.m. The murder weapon, a semi-automatic Ingram MAC-10, which had been illegally converted to an automatic weapon, was later traced to the home of one of The Order&#x27;s members by the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Hostage Rescue Team.

A former producer of Berg&#x27;s believed that he was on a &quot;death list&quot; both because he was Jewish and because he had challenged on air the beliefs of the Christian Identity movement that Jews are descended from Satan. At the trial for his murder, prosecutors contended that he was singled out for assassination because he was a Jew and because his personality incurred the anger of white supremacists. At the conspiracy trial of members of The Order, the white supremacist organization responsible for organizing the assassination, a founding member of the group, Denver Daw Parmenter, was asked why Berg was targeted. Parmenter responded that Berg, &quot;was mainly thought to be anti-white and he was Jewish.&quot; Berg&#x27;s remains were buried at the Waldheim Jewish Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois.

Four members of The Order, Jean Craig, David Lane, Bruce Pierce, and Richard Scutari, were indicted on federal charges for killing Berg. However, only Lane and Pierce were convicted. They were found guilty of racketeering, conspiracy, and violating Berg&#x27;s civil rights. Lane was sentenced to 190 years and Pierce was sentenced to 252 years. Although Jean Craig and Richard Scutari were acquitted of killing Berg, they continued to serve 40-year and 60-year sentences, respectively, on separate federal racketeering convictions. Craig died in prison on April 18, 2001, while Scutari is scheduled for release on June 26, 2025. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Scutari is revered as a martyr and a &quot;prisoner of war&quot; by the far-right, and has continued to write articles for white supremacist publications and websites from prison.

Lane was a former Klansman who later joined the neo-Nazi Christian Identity group Aryan Nation. He steadfastly denied any involvement in Berg&#x27;s murder, but neither did he regret that Berg was dead. In an interview presented as part of the History Channel documentary &quot;Nazi America: A Secret History&quot;, Lane admitted to calling the show and goading Berg into an exchange and stated: &quot;The only thing I have to say about Alan Berg is, regardless of who did it, he has not mouthed his hate-whitey propaganda from his 50,000-watt zionist pulpit for quite a few years&quot;. 

Lane, incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, died of an epileptic seizure at age 68 on May 28, 2007. Bruce Pierce, who was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Complex in Union County, Pennsylvania, died of natural causes at age 56 on August 16, 2010. Craig and Scutari were convicted of unrelated crimes. The leader of The Order, Robert Jay Mathews, who was believed to have been a lookout in Berg&#x27;s murder, albeit it was never proven, was burned to death during a standoff with federal authorities on December 8, 1984, at his home in Coupeville, Washington.

===In popular culture===
Steven Dietz&#x27;s 1988 play &quot;God&#x27;s Country&quot; and the 1988 film &quot;Betrayed&quot; were based on the incident, as was the 1999 film &quot;Brotherhood of Murder&quot;. Director Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1988 film adaptation of Eric Bogosian&#x27;s play &quot;Talk Radio&quot; also drew inspiration from Berg&#x27;s death. His life and death were chronicled in the book, &quot;Talked to Death: The Life and Murder of Alan Berg&quot; by Stephen Singular.

Marc Maron portrays Berg in the 2024 film &quot;The Order&quot;.

<text>Julius Caesar Watts Jr. (born November 18, 1957) is an American politician, clergyman, and former football player. Watts played as a quarterback in college football for the Oklahoma Sooners and later played professionally in the Canadian Football League (CFL). He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, representing .

Watts was born and raised in Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a rural impoverished neighborhood. After being one of the first children to attend an integrated elementary school, he became a high school quarterback and gained a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma. He graduated from college in 1981 with a degree in journalism and became a football player in the Canadian Football League until his retirement in 1986.

Watts became a Baptist minister and was elected in 1990 to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as the first African-American in Oklahoma to win statewide office. He successfully ran for Congress in 1994 and was re-elected to three additional terms with increasing vote margins. Watts delivered the Republican response to Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1997 State of the Union address and was elected Chair of the House Republican Conference in 1998. He retired in 2003 and turned to lobbying and business work, also occasionally serving as a political commentator.

==Early life and career==
Watts was born in Eufaula in McIntosh County, Oklahoma to J. C. &quot;Buddy&quot; Watts Sr., and Helen Watts (d. 1992). His father was a Baptist minister, cattle trader, the first black police officer in Eufaula, and a member of the Eufaula City Council. His mother was a homemaker. Watts is the fifth of six children and grew up in a poor rural African-American neighborhood. He was one of two black children who integrated the Jefferson Davis Elementary School in Eufaula and the first black quarterback at Eufaula High School.

While in high school, Watts fathered a daughter with a white woman, causing a scandal. Their families decided against an interracial marriage because of contemporary racial attitudes and Watts&#x27; family provided for the child until she could be adopted by Watts&#x27; uncle, Wade Watts, a Baptist minister, civil rights leader and head of the Oklahoma division of the NAACP.

He graduated from high school in 1976 and attended the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship. In 1977, Watts married Frankie Jones, an African-American woman with whom he had fathered a second daughter during high school.

Watts began his college football career as the second-string quarterback and left college twice, but his father convinced him to return, and Watts became starting quarterback of the Sooners in 1979 and led them to consecutive Orange Bowl victories. Watts graduated from college in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism. Watts was selected by the New York Jets of the National Football League in the eighth round of the 1981 NFL Draft. The Jets tried Watts at several positions and could not guarantee that he would play quarterback, so he opted to sign with the CFL&#x27;s Ottawa Rough Riders. As Ottawa&#x27;s quarterback, he helped the team reach the 1981 Grey Cup game, which they nearly won in an upset. Watts stayed with the Rough Riders from 1981 to 1985 and played a season for the Toronto Argonauts before retiring in 1986.

Watts returned to Oklahoma and became a youth minister in Del City and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1993. He is a teetotaler. Watts opened a highway construction company and later cited discontent with government regulation of his business as reason to become a candidate for public office. Watts&#x27; family was affiliated with the Democratic Party and his father and uncle Wade Watts were active in the party, but it did not help Watts when he ran for public office and he changed his party affiliation in 1989, months before his first statewide race. Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when, as a journalism student, he covered the 1980 U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles. Watts&#x27; father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party, but supported him. Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990 for a six-year term as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma. He served as a member of the commission from 1990 to 1995 and as its chairman from 1993 to 1995.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===1994 congressional election===
Watts ran for Congress in 1994 to succeed Dave McCurdy, who had announced his retirement from the House of Representatives to run for the Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49 percent to Apple&#x27;s 48 percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52 percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92 percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts&#x27; established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52 percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House. Oklahoma&#x27;s Fourth District at the time was 90 percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.

As Congressman, Watts was assigned to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee. Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich&#x27;s agenda, the Contract with America, and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus. He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government. Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges. In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.

===Reelection and successive terms===
Watts&#x27; 1996 reelection campaign featured state representative Ed Crocker as the Democratic candidate in a negative campaign. Crocker questioned Watts&#x27; business dealings because of tax issues for a real estate company of which Watts was the principal owner, and whether he was paying child support for one of his daughters born out of wedlock. Crocker suggested Watts might use drugs or sanction their use because he declined to participate in a voluntary drug screening in the House of Representatives. Watts denied the charge, took the test, and accused Crocker of draft dodging during the Vietnam War and later living at the &quot;center of the West Coast drug culture.&quot; Watts was given a featured speaking role at the 1996 Republican National Convention and was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote in the 1996 U.S. House election.

Following the election, Watts switched from the Financial Services Committee to the House Transportation Committee. He was the only African-American Republican in the House and was chosen to deliver the Republican reply to President Bill Clinton&#x27;s State of the Union address in February 1997, the youngest congressman and first African-American to do so. In his response, Watts focused on providing a positive vision of the Republican Party and advocated deficit and tax reduction and faith-based values. Watts had previously spoken to &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and created controversy by criticizing &quot;race-hustling poverty pimps&quot; as keeping African-Americans dependent on government. These remarks were viewed as critical of activist Jesse Jackson and Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry, and Jesse Jackson Jr. demanded a public apology. Watts stated he did not speak about Barry and Jackson but about &quot;some of the leadership in the black community.&quot;

In his 1998 reelection campaign against Democrat Ben Odom, Watts faced accusations about debts, unpaid taxes and over actions in a federal bribery investigation in 1991, where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts&#x27; membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts, and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma. Watts argued he had been exonerated from any criminal conduct and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s. He was re-elected with 62 percent of the vote.

From 1995 until 1997, Watts was only one of two black Republicans in Congress (along with Gary Franks of Connecticut). From 1997 until 2003, Watts was the only black Republican Congressman. There would not be another until the elections of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2010.

===Leadership position and retirement===
In Congress, Watts had established himself as a &quot;devoted conservative.&quot; He had a lifetime 94 percent rating from the American Conservative Union and a lifetime &quot;liberal quotient&quot; of 1 percent from Americans for Democratic Action, and was regarded as a team player by Republicans. Watts was elected House Republican Conference Chair in 1998, replacing John Boehner, after a vote of 121–93. Watts assumed the position in 1999 and was the first African-American Republican elected to a leadership post.

In his leadership position, Watts opposed government regulations and President Clinton&#x27;s attempt to restore the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products. He voted to impeach Bill Clinton, was appointed by Speaker Dennis Hastert to lead a group of House Republicans to investigate cybersecurity issues, and became a member of a presidential exploratory committee for George W. Bush. Watts argued for using tax reduction to improve education, job training and housing in poor urban and rural settings, and advocated letting religious institutions carry out the work. Watts worked to make his party more inclusive, promoted African trade, supported historically black colleges and universities, and was opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.

To keep a majority of House seats in the 2000 election, Watts advised Republicans to moderate their language and criticized the party for creating the perception it favored a view of &quot;family values that excluded single mothers.&quot; Watts opposed the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State House and advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing racial quotas. By then, Watts had become involved in a contest with other members of the Republican House leadership, including Tom DeLay, over control of the party&#x27;s message and nearly announced retirement in early February 2000, due to strains on his family, who remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington, but changed his mind after consultations with constituents, Hastert, and his family. He ran, despite an earlier pledge to serve not more than three terms. Watts won re-nomination with 81 percent against James Odom and was re-elected by his largest margin yet against Democratic candidate Larry Weatherford.

After George W. Bush took office as president, Watts co-sponsored a bill to create tax incentives for charitable donations and allow religious charities to receive federal money for social programs, and proposed several new tax reductions in addition to Bush&#x27;s tax cut plan, targeting the estate tax and marriage penalty. Watts was one of ten congressional leaders taken to an undisclosed location following the September 11 attacks.

In 2002, Watts stated he would not seek reelection, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, but stated the decision was difficult because Rosa Parks asked him to stay. Republicans argued Watts complained about the party message and the cancellation of an artillery system in his district by the Bush Administration, which Watts denied. Watts supported the candidacy of Tom Cole, who won the election to fill his seat.

==Post-congressional career==
After he left Congress, Watts was appointed by President Bush to be a member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy for a term expiring December 30, 2003. Watts founded a lobbying and consulting firm, J. C. Watts Companies, in Washington, D.C., to represent corporations and political groups and focus on issues he championed in Congress. The John Deere Company hired Watts as lobbyist in 2006 and Watts later invested in a Deere dealership and sought financial support from United States agencies and others for a farm-related project in Senegal. Watts wrote an autobiography, wrote regular opinion columns for the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;, and joined the boards of several companies, including Dillard&#x27;s, Terex, Clear Channel Communications, and CSX Transportation, and served as chairman of GOPAC.

Watts supported the Iraq War in 2003, stating: &quot;America did not become the leader of the free world by looking the other way to heinous atrocities and unspeakable evils.&quot; He was later hired as a political commentator by CNN and following the 2006 House election, Watts argued the Republican Party had lost seats because it failed to address the needs of urban areas and did not offer a positive message. He stated: &quot;We lost our way, pure and simple.&quot;

In 2008, Watts announced he was developing a cable news network with the help of Comcast, focusing on an African-American audience, and that he considered voting for Barack Obama, criticizing the Republican party for failing in outreach to the African-American community. Reports showed he contributed to John McCain, but not to Obama.

Watts considered running to succeed Brad Henry as Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 gubernatorial election, but declined in May 2009, citing his business and contractual obligations.

On April 7, 2015, Watts joined U.S. Senator Rand Paul on stage during Paul&#x27;s announcement speech for U.S. president.

For most of 2016, Watts served as the president and CEO of Feed the Children (FTC). The board of directors announced his appointment on January 21. On November 15, the organization and Watts announced that he was no longer serving in those roles. The following April, Watts sued both FTC and its board of directors for wrongful termination. According to Watts, he was fired after uncovering rampant financial mismanagement at the charity and notifying the state&#x27;s Attorney General Office of potentially illegal practices. Feed The Children denied there was any validity to Watts&#x27; claims and proceeded to file a counter-suit against him. The case was settled in 2019, after FTC agreed to drop their counter-suit and pay Watts $1 million to resolve all his claims against them.

In 2019 Watts began plans to start the Black News Channel, which launched on February 10, 2020, as a 24-hour news channel aimed at an African American audience. The channel went out of business in April 2022, in the face of lagging cable and satellite provider subscriptions and an unsuccessful 2021 revamp that added commentators at odds with Watts&#x27;s views.

<text>Speonk (, ) is a hamlet located in the Town of Southampton, Suffolk County, New York, United States.

==History==

As early as 1712, meadows in Speonk were leased to cattle owners from Southampton. Most of the early residents came west from Southampton and Bridgehampton in the 1740s, building farms and clearing the forests of wood. In the 1880s, duck farms thrived in Speonk, but few survived past the turn of the century. The name Speonk was inspired by a Native American word meaning high place. An 1897 Long Island Rail Road catalog listed Speonk, noting that that name &quot;certainly sounds like the call of a frog.&quot; Railroad conductors frequently accentuated the name when calling it out as the next station. Some residents pressed to change the name to Remsenburg, after prominent resident Charles Remsen donated a new Presbyterian Church. Today, both names remain in use, each covering different areas of the community.

==Geography==
Speonk is located at geographic coordinates 40° 49&#x27; 8.0688&quot; North, 72° 42&#x27; 26.2008&quot; West (40.818908, -72.707278). The ZIP Code for Speonk is 11972.

==In popular culture==
The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful recorded a song called &quot;Big Noise From Speonk&quot; on their 1966 album &quot;Daydream.&quot;

David Leavitt wrote a short story called &quot;Speonk,&quot; collected in &quot;The Marble Quilt&quot; (2001).

<text>The Sud Express (also called Surexpreso and Sud Expresso ) was an overnight passenger train connecting Paris with Lisbon and Madrid, and which originally was operated by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits and ran north of Paris to Calais. After 1994, the &quot;Sud Express&quot; connected Lisboa with Hendaye, a French commune on the Franco-Spanish border. In 1957, Reuters called it &quot;one of Europe&#x27;s fastest and most famous trains&quot;.

For most of the train&#x27;s history, it was operated in two sections, with passengers needing to change between trainsets at the French–Spanish border because a break of gauge there prevented through operation, but from June 1973 to May 1994 the &quot;Sud Express&quot; carried through couchette cars between Paris and Lisbon (the Madrid section having been dropped in 1973), thanks to the introduction of cars with bogies (wheelsets) that could be adjusted at the border for the change of gauge. Passengers in sitting cars still had to change trains at the border. 

The &quot;Sud Express&quot; carried Pullman (luxury class) cars exclusively until 1933, when first-class cars were added. It ran without any stops on its Paris–Bordeaux section, which in 1964 was the world&#x27;s longest non-stop train journey, covering .

The service was suspended in March 2020 due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, but is set to return in the first half of 2025. 

==History==

The inaugural trip of the &quot;Sud Express&quot; took place on 21 October 1887 connecting Lisbon via Madrid to Paris in 45 hours and services were extended on 4 November 1887 to Calais. By 1900, the cars to and from Lisbon were uncoupled from the Paris–Madrid cars at Medina del Campo, no longer going via Madrid and thereby shortening the journey time between Paris and Lisbon.

For most of the train&#x27;s history (until 1973), all passengers had to change trains at the French–Spanish border because the two countries used different track gauges, and the break of gauge made it impossible for trains to run through between the two countries.

Initially, the service was weekly, but in 1888 was run twice weekly and from London Charing Cross. Also in 1888, the British Royal Mail launched connecting package services from Lisbon to Rio de la Plata and Brazil. The service frequency increased further and on 1 January 1907 started to run daily.

In the 1930s, the Spanish Civil War caused the service to be suspended more than once, including from the war&#x27;s outbreak (in 1936) until 5 November 1937 and again from 11 December 1937 to 1 August 1939. It was again suspended on 1 November 1940 due to World War II. It restarted between Paris and Lisbon in March 1945 and soon also again to Madrid.

The train carried only Pullman cars (luxury-class lounge cars and sleeping cars) until 1933, when first-class carsa lower class than Pullmanwere added. By at least 1949, the French portion of the train was also carrying some cars with second-class and third-class compartments, along with first-class and Pullman-class cars. And by 1954, third class had been discontinued but the &quot;Sud Express&quot; was carrying some cars with second-class compartments on the Spanish and Portuguese portion also, with Pullman-class cars still in use only on the French portion. In 1957, Reuters called it &quot;one of Europe&#x27;s fastest and most famous trains&quot;. By that time, its average speed between Paris and Hendaye had been increased to .

Starting in 1953, the &quot;Sud Express&quot; operated non-stop between Paris and Bordeaux, which in 1964 (at least) was the longest non-stop train journey in the world, covering a distance of . Its scheduled average speed in 1964 was , which at the time was only slower than the fastest train in all of Europe. The train&#x27;s typical consist was long, with up to 17 cars. 

By 1973, the &quot;Sud Express&quot; Madrid section had been discontinued, following the June 1969 introduction of a new train, &quot;Puerta del Sol&quot;, providing through overnight sleeping-car service between Paris and Madrid.

However, in 1973, the &quot;Sud Express&quot; became able to carry through cars over its entire route, now only Paris–Lisbon, thanks to the introduction of couchette cars fitted with variable-gauge wheelsets. &quot;Cooks Continental Timetable&quot; explained that, &quot;At Hendaye, the through couchettes Paris–Lisbon and v.v. are jacked up to change the bogies on account of the difference in track gauge between France and Spain.&quot; Sitting cars and full sleeping cars continued to run in two separate sections, with passengers having to change at Hendaye or Irun. Through couchette cars running between Paris and Porto were added in summer 1974, followed in June 1975 by Paris–Ourense, the latter being extended to Vigo in 1977.

==Events==
A 1939 crash near Tolosa, Spain on 29 March killed, amongst others, the artist Romilly Fedden and his novelist wife Katharine Waldo Douglas.

On 11 September 1985, a &quot;Sud Express&quot; train collided head-on with another train near Moimenta-Alcafache station. The locomotives exploded and the train, carrying about 400 passengers, immediately caught fire. Forty-nine deaths were officially confirmed, most caused by the fire, although unofficial estimates put the number of deaths between 100 and 150. A memorial was erected on site.

==Late 20th century to 2020==

With the 1994 introduction of LGV Atlantique service from Paris to Irún and from Hendaye (the twin border towns on opposite sides of the French/Spanish border), the through &quot;Sud Express&quot; service was discontinued in favour of a (faster) combination of two different trains. The original connection from and to Paris was then made with one TGV to Irun and from Hendaye.

The continuing &quot;Sud Express&quot; ran as a night train from Irun at the French/Spanish border to Lisbon and from Lisbon to Hendaye. Until April 2010, facilities existed for second-class seated accommodation, second-class couchette cars (6-bunk compartments), and first-class private sleeping compartments for 1, 2 or 3 passengers.

Previously, first-class passengers found a bar of chocolate and a small bottle of port in their compartments upon boarding the train, with dinner served in a well-appointed dining and bar car, and a continental breakfast the following morning. However, by 2019 the full restaurant car and catering had been replaced by a cafe-bar car.

The train consisted of a Talgo IV set hired from Renfe hauled by a RENFE Class 252 between the Irún/Hendaye and Medina del Campo, a RENFE Class 334 between Medina del Campo and Vilar Formoso and a CP Class 5600 between Vilar Formoso and Lisbon.

The Portuguese government&#x27;s strategic plan for transport, published in October 2011, envisaged the withdrawal of the &quot;Sud Express&quot;. In October 2012, CP started an Intercity (later downgraded to InterRegional) service between Porto and Coimbra in order to improve the connection between the &quot;Sud Express&quot; and northern Portugal. Also from October 2012, this train was operated by CP-Comboios de Portugal.

After 25 April 2018, the southbound &quot;Sud Express&quot; started at Hendaye (instead of Irún), due to the lack of proper certification from the new fleet of TGV 2N2 operating on the LGV SEA.

==Suspension due to COVID-19 pandemic==

The service was suspended on 17 March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but has not resumed. In March 2021, a representative of the Spanish transport ministry said that the country may stop having night trains even after the end of the coronavirus pandemic.

== Return to service in 2025 ==
In November 2024, a proposal by the LIVRE Party to resume the &quot;Sud Express&quot; service between Portugal and Spain was approved. The Portuguese and Spanish governments are currently negotiating its return to service in the first half of 2025.

<text>Graemsay () is an island in the western approaches to Scapa Flow, in the Orkney Islands of Scotland. The island has two lighthouses. Graemsay lies within the parish of Stromness.

==Geography and geology==
Graemsay lies between Hoy and Stromness on Mainland Orkney, separated from the Mainland by Clestrain Sound. The island is in area and is mainly crofted.

The island&#x27;s geology is Old Red Sandstone of the Devonian period, with two volcanic faults. On the north coast there is granite-schist, a great rarity in Orkney.

Graemsay is surrounded by strong tidal races, known locally as &quot;roosts&quot;. An Orkney Ferries service, usually operated by , links the island with Stromness and Moaness on Hoy.

Graemsay is sometimes referred to locally, as &#x27;Orkney&#x27;s green isle&#x27; due to its lush green vegetation cover.

==Wildlife==
Birds include oystercatchers, ringed plovers, redshank and curlew. Parts of the island are largely undeveloped and are a haven for wild plants.

==History==
As with many other Orkney Islands, there is a connection to the Celtic Church, possibly a pre-Norse one. There are the remains of two early churches, dedicated to St Bride and to St Columba., who are both saints of Irish origin.

The island has two lighthouses, Hoy High (NE) and Hoy Low (NW), both built in 1851 by Alan Stevenson for the 19th-century herring industry.

At the Point of Oxan in the far north west, in Burra Sound, are block ships, which were scuttled deliberately during World War II. This is a common feature of the straits and former straits around Scapa Flow. A Coastal Defence Battery also sits at the point of Oxan, built in 1944, and guarding the western entrance to Scapa Flow, until the end of World War II.

Graemsay primary school was built in 1876 and once had a peak enrollment of 60 pupils. In the late 1990s the school had four staff to just one pupil, making it the most expensive state school in the United Kingdom. The school closed in 1996. Today, the island&#x27;s children travel daily by boat to school in Stromness on the ferry MV Graemsay.

==Lighthouses==
Two lighthouses are present on Graemsay: Hoy Sound Low and Hoy Sound High located at the extremities of the northern side of the island. The lights were built in 1851 on project by Alan Stevenson; both are cylindrical tower with balcony and lantern, even if of different heights, white painted with black lantern and the typical ochre trims.

The Hoy High Light, known as Graemsay Island Range Rear, is high and has a white and red occulting light every 8 seconds depending on the directions.

The Hoy Low Light (Graemsay Island Range Front) is high and is distinguished by a white isophase light every 3 seconds. The two Range lighthouses direct the ships towards the Hoy Sound from the Atlantic.

<text>Pegaso (, &quot;Pegasus&quot;) was a Spanish manufacturer of trucks, buses, tractors, armored vehicles, and, for a while, to train apprentices, and have a good brand image, some sports cars. The parent company, Enasa, was created in 1946 and based in the old Hispano-Suiza factory, under the direction of the renowned automotive engineer Wifredo Ricart. In 1990, Iveco took over Enasa, and the Pegaso name became a secondary brand of Iveco.

Enasa, a state-owned company, had its main business interest in the truck and bus market. Pegaso became one of the leading European industrial vehicle makers, with significant exports to both Europe and Latin America; the Benelux, Venezuela, and Cuba were its major foreign markets, and a substantial contract to supply tactical trucks to the Egyptian Army was signed in the late 1970s.

The main Enasa factories were located in Barcelona, Madrid, and Valladolid. Between 1946 and 1990, Pegaso built more than 350,000 vehicles; the highest production in a single year, over 26,000, was achieved in 1974.

==1940s==


The first Enasa produced truck, a slightly modified Hispano-Fiat 66G, was the Pegaso I, of which only a few units were made (due mostly to the severe shortages of the post-war era) in 1946 and 1947. An enhanced but still petrol-engined version, the Pegaso II (model code Z-203), was launched late in 1947 and reached some hundreds of units while awaiting a much-needed diesel model. This was the Pegaso Diesel (Z-202), nicknamed &quot;Mofletes&quot; (&quot;Chubby cheeks&quot;) for its bulbous front end, which made its debut in 1949 and quickly established itself as the leader in the still weak Spanish truck market. Artic tractor (Z-701), road train, and coach or &#x27;bus (Z-401) versions soon were also available, and all together they became &quot;El camión español&quot; (&quot;The Spanish truck&quot;), as Enasa badges and advertisements proudly stated.

==1950s==
Pegaso built about a hundred Z-102 sports cars in the 1950s. The cars were, in many ways, advanced for the time, as they had a five-speed rear-mounted transaxle and very powerful all-aluminum DOHC engines. They were offered with the choice of Touring, Saoutchik, Serra, or Enasa&#x27;s own luxury bodies. The Z-102 was the fastest production car sold in 1953, capable of reaching .

In 1954, the old Pegaso Diesel engine was uprated to while Ricart&#x27;s other masterpiece, the Pegaso Z-207 truck, was made ready to enter mass production, into which it was placed from 1955 to 1959. The model Z-207 featured a V6 engine and a corrugated-sheet cab, which was also used in other Pegaso truck models in the 1960s and 1970s. The unusual corrugated design became a characteristic sight of the Spanish landscape in the years following. The Z-702 was the tractor for semi-trailers version of the Z-207, while the corresponding motorcoach, model named Z-407, featuring the V-6 engine located in the rear never passed the prototype stage.

Also technically advanced was the Pegaso Z-403 Monocasco, a two-level monocoque (chassisless) coach with its diesel engine mounted amidships, built between 1951 and 1957. In these years, too, Pegaso built the more conventional Z-404 coach or urban &#x27;bus chassis, with a striking body by Seida of Bilbao, and the Z-501 trolleybus, which featured electric equipment by Cenemesa.

In the off-road segment, the first Pegaso product was a caterpillar tractor based on technology from Vender, an Italian specialist, launched in 1957. From then on, Pegaso original crawler tractors, bulldozers and tractors were often badged as EMPRESA locally and these were all produced at their Sagrera factory in Barcelona.

===Pegaso based mobile cranes===
Also in the 1950s, ENASA company started to work closely with the three local mobilecrane and truckcrane firms known as IASA, IBESA and LUNA. Eventually all of them needed a large specialist company that could show interest as their business partners. Quickly ENASA was chosen, as it was the longest established manufacturer and they soon built &amp; designed several types of original special cranecarriers and specially built cranechassis most with Pegaso Diesel engines and other parts fitted with necessary modern hydraulics some with 6WD axles others in 8WD form for off-road use and began supplying these 3 Spanish crane specialists with medium to heavy duty 6 wheeled, 8 wheeled and 10 wheeled cranecarriers so that each crane maker would start their own truckcrane and mobilecrane production.

The Huesca-based large LUNA crane company is now the only firm with the largest models available on offer on their range, while the other two only make medium-sized lorry mounted cranes. The now defunct KYNOS-KOEHRING Hispania Crane Group was a short-lived crane company that was the result of a successful joint-venture (1952-1974) founded between the American KOEHRING a large crane specialist and the local Spanish KYNOS a military engineering firm &amp; construction company that together developed and built large mobilecrane and some giant truckcrane models, all were assembled or partially made with numerous Pegaso components and running gear.

==1960s and 1970s==

In the 1960s and 1970s, Pegaso kept pace with the impressive economic development of Spain (the so-called &quot;Spanish miracle&quot;), and tens of thousands of Pegaso trucks and buses ran on Spanish roads and through Spanish cities and, more important, crossed borders in TIR sealed-container traffic to link the Spanish economy with the European Economic Community. The Pegaso flagship of the time was the 2011 tractor for semi-trailers. Pegaso marketed by then a full variety of commercial vehicles; at the top of the line were 8x4 rigids, 6x4 semi-trailer tractors, 6x6 off-road dumpers and military armoured vehicles, a five-axle 10x4 special conversion for the Dutch market, and three-axle articulated buses; all featured Pegaso&#x27;s own engines of up to .

Production of Pegaso Monotral buses and coaches, based on an Italian Viberti design, began in 1961 and gave rise to a long line of Pegaso chassisless new models during two decades. The first of the series was the successful 6030-N coach, equipped with an underfloor horizontal engine and single-tyre rear axle, making it a very light yet full-length vehicle.

In 1961 too, Pegaso reached an agreement with Vétra, a French trolleybus maker, to launch to the Spanish market a Pegaso trolleybus, called model 8010, based on Vétra technology. The operation, however, was a failure, due to the contemporary import to Spain of several tens of ex-London Transport BUT units; and only one Pegaso 8010, with a Seida body, was ever built.

In 1963, Seida received a license from the German firm Kässbohrer to build Setra chassisless coaches. These were equipped with Pegaso engines and other mechanical units and were marketed with a double badge as the Setra Seida S14 and the Pegaso 5070. Despite being expensive, these coaches were very successful in the Spanish market and competed well with Pegaso&#x27;s own Monotrals and all other conventional chassis-body models.

This was the main OEM business of Pegaso; others were selling engines for railcars and shunter locomotives and providing running units and cab components to Barazábal, a Vitoria-based maker of special chassis for self-propelled cranes, as the aforementioned IASA, IBESA and LUNA. Specially interesting in the railway OEM sector was the fitting in 1964 of Pegaso engines to five ex-New Haven Railroad Mack railcars operated in Asturias by Ferrocarril de Langreo.

In 1968, Enasa took over S.A.V.A. A year later, the whole Sava range of light vehicles, with roots in designs by the British Motor Corporation, was rebadged as Pegaso.


In 1972, a new full range of heavy trucks was launched, featuring a spacious, modernist cubic cab. From then on, the corresponding artic tractors, first the 2080 model and later the tilt-cab 2181, became the pervasive workhorses on Spanish highways.

On the military side, the first production tactical truck was the 1963 4x4 Pegaso 3020, replaced in 1970 by the 3045 and the 6x6 3050. Subsequent enhanced models, the 3046 and the 3055, were dominant in the Spanish Army; and the 3046 was also the subject of a substantial contract (up to 10,000 units) with the Egyptian Army. The 3046 was very common in the Spanish forest fire brigades too, where for obvious reasons it was nicknamed &quot;Egipcio&quot; (&quot;Egyptian&quot;).

Related to the all-wheel-drive trucks were four armoured vehicle models launched by Pegaso in the late 1970s: the 4x4 airborne-able 3545 BLR, the 4x4 amphibious 3550 VAP, the very successful 6x6 3560 BMR, and its derivative, the 3562 VEC, all also used in quantity by the Spanish Army.

In 1975, an agreement between Enasa and Allis-Chalmers led to production in Spain of Pegaso-engined Allis loaders and caterpillar tractors, marketed as &quot;Pegaso-Allis&quot;. This venture lasted but a few years yet eventually allowed Pegaso to act as dealer for Spain of Italian-made Fiat-Allis construction equipment.

==1980s==
In the 1980s, suffering from the saturation of the European truck market, Enasa sought joint ventures with other truck makers. A failed association in 1978 with International Harvester had resulted in Enasa&#x27;s taking over the British Seddon Atkinson marque, and a new Enasa subsidiary, Pegaso Agrícola, became the exclusive dealer for Spain of Case IH tractors and agricultural machinery. A similar market agreement with British-based Perkins Engines led to the creation of Pegaso Motor, exclusive dealer for Spain of Perkins marine engines.

Another early original Spanish company called CALSA from Zaragoza specialized in developing and manufacturing off-road tractors and industrial loaders, also used ENASA PEGASO mechanicals and hydraulics for their own heavy duty rugged CALSA original model range. Components were taken by train from the Barajas ENASA factory in Madrid to the Zaragoza Industrial Estate so that specialist CALSA would power their earthmover range of models until they were acquired by another large and independent new owner in 1990.

Later, a joint venture with DAF Trucks produced the cab for the Troner, DAF&#x27;s new series 95, and the Seddon Atkinson Strato,
these trucks being launched in 1987.

In rally racing, Pegaso all-wheel-drive trucks won the 1985 Rallye des Pharaons and the 1986 Paris-Dakar.

==1990 Iveco takeover==

After a joint takeover by Daimler-Benz and MAN aborted at the last hour, Iveco bought Enasa in 1990. At that time, Pegaso offerings included the Ekus (a light truck, actually a rebadging of the Volkswagen LT and MAN-VW G ranges), Mider (medium), Troner (heavy), Trakker (off-road), and Podium (omnibusses and coaches) ranges. A futuristic concept truck designed by Francisco Podadera, the Pegaso Solo 500, had been exhibited at the Barcelona Motor Show in 1989.

==Demise==
Most of the Pegaso ranges disappeared from the market shortly after the Iveco takeover. On July 12, 1994, the last Pegaso Troner left the production line of the factory at Barajas (Madrid); the last Pegaso engine was made in 1995; Iveco has never stopped using the Pegaso brand, using it mainly as a secondary brand.

<text>Copinsay () is one of the Orkney Islands in Scotland, lying off the east coast of the Orkney Mainland. The smaller companion island to Copinsay, Horse of Copinsay lies to the northeast. The Horse is uninhabited, and is managed as a bird reserve. Copinsay is also home to a lighthouse.

==History==
For many generations, prior to the final inhabitants moving to the Mainland in 1958, Copinsay was full of life. This is evidenced by the large two storey farmhouse, the Steading (or farm buildings) behind it for the farm tenants, a school with a schoolteacher, and up to three lighthouse keepers&#x27; families. There is also an ancient burial site on the island.

In the earlier part of the 20th century, a weekly postal service provided contact with the Mainland, and there were fortnightly shopping trips to Deerness, allowing for weather. The farm had working horses, cattle and sheep - all of which had to be transported on the &quot;coo&quot; or &quot;cow&quot; boat. Bird&#x27;s eggs provided a good supplement to the islanders&#x27; diet, and men were lowered over the cliffs on a special rope, or were rowed out to the Horse to bring back this addition. Pigs were loosed in the Spring on the Horse for many years, and they fed on the bird&#x27;s eggs.

Many interesting facts and accounts of life on Copinsay are still retold in the Deerness Community, with many members still remembering when the island was still home to loved ones. Myths about the island include the story of the Copinsay Brownie.

The island was bought by the ornithology charity RSPB in 1972 in memory of the naturalist James Fisher.

==Ecology==
Although Copinsay today is uninhabited, some fields are still farmed at the behest of the RSPB, to try provide suitable conditions for Corncrake. As a result, a patchwork of yesteryear is returning to the island, even though the people have not. 
Together with the three adjacent islets (Corn Holm, Ward Holm and Black Holm), it is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the European Union directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds due to the unimproved grassland vegetation and sheer sandstone cliffs providing ideal breeding ledges for seabirds. 
There is a large colony of grey seals on the island. They usually pup in November each year. Puffins can be seen during July on the adjacent holms.

The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant breeding populations of seabirds.

<text>Jamie Christopher Hewlett (born 3 April 1968) is a British comic book artist and illustrator. He is the co-creator of the comic book &quot;Tank Girl&quot; with Alan Martin and the virtual band Gorillaz, alongside Blur frontman Damon Albarn.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Brought up in Horsham, West Sussex, Jamie Hewlett was a pupil at Tanbridge House School, a comprehensive for pupils aged 11–16 years. In 1983 he worked in the Wardour Street studios of Oscar Award-winning animator Bob Godfrey. Hewlett created the original artwork for a pilot animated cartoon series for Thames Television directed by Bob Godfrey with voiceovers by Peter Hawkins, the voice of Bill &amp; Ben.

While studying at Northbrook College Worthing, Hewlett, Alan Martin and fellow student Philip Bond created a fanzine called &quot;Atomtan&quot;. This brought him to the attention of Brett Ewins. After leaving college Hewlett and Martin were invited by Ewins to create material for a new magazine he was setting up with Steve Dillon in 1988.

=== Early career===
A magazine called &quot;Deadline&quot; featured a mixture of comic strips produced by English creators like Hewlett and articles on music and culture. Martin and Hewlett created &quot;Tank Girl&quot;, an anarchic strip about a teenage punk girl who drove a tank and had a mutant kangaroo for a boyfriend. The strip proved instantly popular and quickly became the most talked-about part of &quot;Deadline&quot;. Hewlett&#x27;s eccentric style proved popular and he started to work with bands Senseless Things and Cud providing covers for record releases; he also contributed artwork sporadically to &quot;Commodore User&quot; magazine.

He designed decor for a nightclub called The Factory in Chatsworth Road, Worthing. The decor featured red and green stripes, a wall of blown-up panels from &quot;Tank Girl&quot; set against 1970s wallpaper, a Ford Escort hung from the ceiling, and toilets pasted with pages from old comic book annuals. The Factory has since been refurbished and renamed several times.

By 1992, Hewlett had become a major creator in the comics industry, and one of the few to break into mainstream media. He had worked with writer Peter Milligan on &quot;Hewligan&#x27;s Haircut&quot; in &quot;2000 AD&quot; issues 700 to 707. The series was later compiled into a trade paperback. He was involved in providing covers and art for &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot;, also written by Milligan, for DC Comics.

&quot;Tank Girl&quot; was optioned to be made into a film by MGM after being considered by, among others, Steven Spielberg. The film was released in 1995 and featured Lori Petty as Tank Girl. It was a commercial and critical failure and was criticized by fans who said it failed to capture the essence of the original strip. Hewlett had very little involvement with the film.

Hewlett drew a Tank Girl mini-series for the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics written by Peter Milligan.

He opened a secondhand clothing store, 49. The shop, at 49 Rowlands Road, Worthing, was managed by girlfriend Jane Oliver, originally a member of Elastica, but this was a short-lived venture and closed within a year.

Hewlett was still involved with English bands of the mid-1990s, including illustrating a comic strip version of Pulp&#x27;s song &quot;Common People&quot;.

&quot;Deadline&quot; was eventually cancelled in 1996 due to falling sales in a changed market and Hewlett concentrated on working in advertising and designs for television, most notably the children&#x27;s series &quot;SMTV Live&quot;, featuring Ant &amp; Dec. He also created the strip &quot;Get the Freebies&quot;, which was published monthly in English fashion magazine &quot;The Face&quot;. The stories, all set in London, followed the exploits of Terry Phoo, a gay, Buddhist kung-fu law enforcement officer and his sidekick Whitey Action, an enigmatic young anarchist with a bad attitude, as they tackle their primary adversaries The Freebies Gang. The dynamic between the two heroes was much like that of Tank Girl and her mutant kangaroo boyfriend Booga, with the episodes from the female protagonist&#x27;s point of view. The strip&#x27;s primary function was for Hewlett to vent his spleen against the media idols and trends of the day, the story often taking second place to the jokes.

===21st century===
At this time, he had moved into a flat with Blur&#x27;s Damon Albarn after Hewlett split with Oliver, and it was while sharing the flat that the pair came up with the idea of Gorillaz, a virtual band. Albarn would work on the music, while Hewlett would come up with character designs, and both came up with ideas for the members of the band. The first Gorillaz EP was released in 2000 followed by the first album, &quot;Gorillaz&quot; in 2001. In 2005, their second full studio album, &quot;Demon Days&quot; was released.

In January 2006, Hewlett&#x27;s artwork for Gorillaz was shortlisted for the Design Museum&#x27;s Designer of the Year award. In May 2006, he was named the Designer of the Year 2006. On 25 May 2006, Hewlett and Albarn won the joint award for Songwriters of the Year at the Ivor Novello Awards.

In 2007, Hewlett and Albarn premiered their first major work since Gorillaz, entitled &quot;&quot;, a re-working of the ancient Chinese legend &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. Albarn wrote the score whilst Hewlett designed the set, animations and costumes. Written and adapted by Chen Shi-zheng, the show featured 45 Chinese circus acrobats, Shaolin monks and Chinese vocalists. It premiered at the Palace Theatre, Manchester as part of the Manchester International Festival, on 28 June 2007.

His &quot;Get the Freebies&quot; strip was adapted by BBC Three for a pilot entitled &quot;Phoo Action&quot;, broadcast in February 2008.

Hewlett and Albarn created the animation sequence the BBC used to introduce coverage of the Beijing 2008 Olympics. The sequence titled &quot;Journey to the East&quot; uses the Monkey character from &quot;Monkey: Journey to the West&quot;.

He married French presenter and actress Emma de Caunes at Saint-Paul-de-Vence on 10 September 2011.

A 2014 Kickstarter campaign successfully raised the capital for a new Tank Girl book called &quot;21st Century Tank Girl&quot; featuring co-creators Hewlett and Martin, as well as other artists, including Brett Parson, Warwick Johnson-Cadwell, Philip Bond, Jim Mahfood, Craig Knowles, and Jonathan Edwards.

In November 2015, Hewlett debuted his first art exhibition called The Suggestionists at the Saatchi Gallery in London. The exhibition then made its American debut at the Woodward Gallery in Manhattan in May 2016.

In 2017, Taschen published a large format monograph of Hewlett&#x27;s work across 25 years. 

The Gorillaz Art Book was published in 2022 where Hewlett’s original creations featured alongside those of over 40 artists invited by Hewlett to make work inspired by the world of Gorillaz.

In 2023, www.jamiehewlett.com launched with Warriors, a first collection of limited edition artworks that spans 27 years.

==Influences==
In a 2013 interview with Consequence of Sound, Hewlett stated that his primary influences were the works of cartoonists such as Mort Drucker, Carl Giles, Jack Davis, and &quot;Ronald&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;) Lowe.

In a 2012 interview for Absolut Vodka, Hewlett also listed Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s American satirical magazine MAD Magazine as a leading influence of his art. 
Hewlett has mentioned that he is largely influenced by the works of American animator Chuck Jones of Looney Tunes, and cites the works of British comic book artists Ronald Searle and Mike McMahon as influences on his artwork. In fact, Hewlett has even stated that the entirety of Chuck Jones&#x27; filmography and Mad Magazine as a whole are the biggest overall influences on his work.

Hewlett was influenced by not only the works of Chuck Jones, but also various UPA cartoons. Hewlett&#x27;s Absolut London web profile also revealed that along with Chuck Jones, American filmmaker Stanley Kubrick and American author Hunter S. Thompson were big influences on his artwork as well. Hewlett has also admitted to being heavily inspired by the likes of artists such as Robert Crumb, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Martin Kippenberger, and Richard Caton Woodville.

During a 2012 Interview with Alfred Dunhill, he also lists the first film of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series as another main influence on his artwork.

Hewlett has admitted to being a big fan of Brendan McCarthy&#x27;s works, more specifically his work on his comic book &quot;Strange Days&quot;. Hewlett has said that French comic book artist Moebius is a big influence on his art, calling him &#x27;unbelievably inspiring&#x27; and saying that he considers him to be &#x27;one of the greatest&#x27;. In addition to Moebius, Hewlett has been heavily influenced by the works of artists Tony Hart and Tanino Liberatore. In an interview with &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, Hewlett also mentioned being a fan of American animator Brad Bird and his work on &quot;Family Dog&quot;, as well as American cartoonist Charles Schulz&#x27; &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strips.

In a conversation with Mark Kermode, Hewlett said that the 1973 French animated film &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot; was the very first animated film that showed him animation is also a medium for adults.

<doc id="512985" wikidata="Q3104635" url="?curid=512985" title="Get Your War On">
<text>Get Your War On is a series of satirical comic strips by David Rees about political topics. Initially, the comic concerned the effects of the September 11 attacks on New York City, but it quickly switched its focus to more recent topics, in particular the War on Terror. The strip debuted on October 9, 2001.

From a technical standpoint the strips are crude, being assembled from about a dozen simple clip art pictures of office workers (with a few exceptions, most notably super robot Voltron) that are repeated, often in the same strip. Almost all are in red on a white background. There is an emphasis on dialogue, with little action. Highly disillusioned and cynical, it is heavily laden with expletives.

==Development and publishing==

The majority of the clip art used in &quot;Get Your War On&quot; is taken from &quot;Office and Business Illustrations&quot;, designed by Tom Tierney and first published by Dover Publications in 1988. In 2009, American restaurant chain Jamba Juice was criticized for running an ad campaign which looked similar to the &quot;Get Your War On&quot; series as it used the same clip art.

&quot;Get Your War On&quot; has been published in book form, with the author&#x27;s royalties (as well as part of the publisher&#x27;s income for the first book and &quot;Get Your War on II&quot;) being donated to the charity Adopt-A-Minefield for removal of landmines in Afghanistan. It was also published regularly in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and some alternative newspapers. In 2004, Rees was interviewed in the book &quot;,&quot; edited by syndicated editorial cartoonist Ted Rall. &quot;Attitude 2&quot; included other cartoonists such as Alison Bechdel and Aaron McGruder.

In 2007, &quot;Get Your War On&quot; comics were included with the works of Jenny Holzer and Goya in the &quot;Dissent!&quot; exhibition of protest art at Harvard University&#x27;s Fogg Art Museum.

As the author had promised, the strip ended the day that George W. Bush left office, January 20, 2009. Rees continues to maintain a blog, which covers topical political issues.

==Critical reaction==
Tom Carson has called &quot;Get Your War On&quot; a &quot;glorious excoriation of our post-9/11 loony bin&quot;, while Connie Ogle, in her review of the second &quot;Get Your War On&quot; book, called it &quot;Profane, decidedly anti-war and screamingly funny ... guaranteed to make you laugh yourself sick.&quot; James Poniewozik has compared &quot;Get Your War On&quot; to &quot;Doonesbury&quot; and &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, calling it &quot;a fresher (and more R-rated) critique&quot; of the Bush administration.

==Adaptations==

In 2005 it was adapted into a stage performance by Rude Mechanicals of Austin, Texas. The performance was revived in the winter of 2006 and began a tour of the country in the fall of 2006. The tour included stops in Houston, Philadelphia, New York, and Washington, D.C.

During the United States presidential election in 2008, &quot;Get Your War On&quot; began running as an animated series on the comedy website Comedy 23/6. The series stopped after Barack Obama&#x27;s inauguration, but returned during the 2012 presidential election.

<text>The Windsor Star is a daily newspaper based in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Owned by Postmedia Network, it is published Tuesdays through Saturdays.

==History==
The paper began as the weekly Windsor Record in 1888, changing its name to the Border Cities Star in 1918, when it was bought by W. F. Herman. The &quot;Border Cities Star&quot; was a daily newspaper published from September 3, 1918, until June 28, 1935. The founders W. F. Herman and Hugh Graybiel purchased the existing daily newspaper, the &quot;Windsor Record&quot; (known as the &quot;Evening Record&quot; from 1890 to November 1917), from John A. McKay on August 6, 1918.

There was some conflict before the men purchased the newspaper. The &quot;Windsor Record&quot; had only partial wire service, and some felt that the national and international news was not sufficiently covered. Originally, the &quot;Border Cities Star&quot; was intended to be a rival daily newspaper to the &quot;Windsor Record&quot;. However, Herman&#x27;s application to Canadian Press Limited for full wire service was denied because of opposition by McKay.. He had held a variety of committee executive positions at the organization over the years. McKay eventually agreed to subscribe to the full wire service and sold the &quot;Windsor Record&quot; to W. F. Herman for an inflated price. Many viewed that as a flaw of the Canadian Press Limited. The wire service, which was subsidized by government funds, was run mainly by a group of publishers that could use it as a way of limiting competition and increasing the value of their own newspapers (Border Cities Era: October 18, 1918, page 7)

Herman had previous experience in the newspaper industry since he had owned the &quot;Prince Albert Daily Herald&quot;, the &quot;Saskatoon Capital&quot;, and the &quot;Regina Leader-Post&quot;. Herman became the paper&#x27;s president, and Graybiel assumed the role of business manager. They changed the name of the &quot;Windsor Record&quot; to the &quot;Border Cities Star&quot; to reflect not only Windsor but also all the surrounding communities.

On page 4 of its inaugural issue, the new owners state that in their &quot;Aims and Endeavors&quot; that they intend to make it &quot;a worth-while newspaper for worth-while people.&quot; They proposed two main goals: one was to work with and build up local institutions and organizations. The newspaper &quot;must endeavor to become one with its community, to enter closely into its daily life and being, and to voice for the community the otherwise largely inarticulate striving for the attainment of the largest self-development.&quot; The other goal was &quot;to be worthy of Canada.&quot; They appealed to Canadian pride and nationalism, in particular with regards to Canadians&#x27; contributions to the ongoing war, and stated their intention &quot;to be broad, to be faithful, to be progressive and forward-looking, to be free and independent and unprejudiced. The Canadian who is not proud of our mighty country has no right or title to its citizenship.&quot; They identified two other goals: the revision of tariffs and to &quot;uphold the English language as the only proper language and method of instruction in the primary grades of the public schools.&quot; That was a somewhat-controversial stand because of the ongoing conflict between Anglophones and Francophones over educational rights in Ontario.

Initially, the &quot;Border Cities Star&quot; was published from the Record Printing Company offices at 36 Sandwich Street West, on the north side of Sandwich Street, just west of Ferry Street. In 1923, it moved to a building on Ferry Street, and in 1927, it expanded into adjacent new larger premises, at the corner of Ferry Street and Pitt Street.

When the city of Windsor annexed Walkerville, East Windsor (Ford City), Sandwich, and Ojibway in 1935, the &quot;Border Cities Star&quot; changed its name to the &quot;Windsor Daily Star&quot;. Although Herman died in 1938, the paper continued under the direction of his wife, Adie Knox Herman, along with Hugh Graybiel and W. L. (Lum) Clark. In 1959, it became simply the &quot;Windsor Star&quot;.

The paper was sold to Southam Inc. in 1971 and then to Canwest, which bought Southam from Hollinger, in 2000.

In November 1996, the paper opened a printing facility in south-central Windsor.

In 2013, the &quot;Windsor Star&quot; moved to a new facility at 300 Ouellette Avenue, formerly occupied by the CTV Two owned-and-operated station CHWI-DT. The former 167 Ferry Street building was sold to the University of Windsor, which opened a new downtown campus at the facility in 2015.

In February 2019, the paper announced that it will no longer publish a Monday edition effective March 4, 2019.

On January 31, 2023, the Windsor Star had announced that effective on March 3, its plant in south-central Windsor will be shut down, and printing will be done in London and at Islington (by sister papers London Free Press and Toronto Sun, respectively).

== Circulation ==
The &quot;Windsor Star&quot; has seen, like most Canadian daily newspapers, a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by percent to 49,613 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.

<text>Samuel Carthorne Rivers (September 25, 1923 – December 26, 2011) was an American jazz musician and composer. Though most famously a tenor saxophonist, he also performed on soprano saxophone, bass clarinet, flute, harmonica, piano and viola.

Active in jazz since the early 1950s, he earned wider attention during the mid-1960s spread of free jazz. With a thorough command of music theory, orchestration and composition, Rivers was an influential and prominent artist in jazz music.

== Early life ==
Rivers was born in El Reno, Oklahoma, United States. His father was a gospel musician who had sung with the Fisk Jubilee Singers and the Silverstone Quartet, exposing Rivers to music from an early age. His grandfather was Marshall W. Taylor, a religious leader from Kentucky. Rivers was stationed in California in the 1940s during a stint in the Navy. Here he performed semi-regularly with blues singer Jimmy Witherspoon. Rivers moved to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1947, where he studied at the Boston Conservatory with Alan Hovhaness.

He performed with Quincy Jones, Herb Pomeroy, Tadd Dameron and others.

== Blue Note era ==
In 1959, Rivers began performing with 13-year-old drummer Tony Williams. Rivers was briefly a member of the Miles Davis Quintet in 1964, partly on Williams&#x27;s recommendation. This edition of the quintet released a single live album, &quot;Miles in Tokyo&quot;, from a show recorded on July 14 at Kohseinenkin Hall. Rivers&#x27; tenure with the quintet was brief: he had engagements in Boston, and his playing style was too avant-garde for Davis during this period; he was replaced by Wayne Shorter shortly thereafter.

Rivers was signed by Blue Note Records, for whom he recorded four albums as leader and made several sideman appearances. Among noted sidemen on his own Blue Note albums were Jaki Byard, who appears on &quot;Fuchsia Swing Song&quot; (1964), Herbie Hancock and Freddie Hubbard. He appeared on Blue Note recordings by Tony Williams, Andrew Hill and Larry Young.

Rivers derived his music from bebop, but he was an adventurous player, adept at free jazz. The first of his Blue Note albums, &quot;Fuchsia Swing Song&quot;, adopts an approach sometimes called &quot;inside-outside&quot;. Here the performer frequently obliterates the explicit harmonic framework (&quot;going outside&quot;) but retains a hidden link so as to be able to return to it in a seamless fashion. Rivers brought the conceptual tools of bebop harmony to a new level in this process, united at all times with the ability to &quot;tell a story&quot;, which Lester Young had laid down as a benchmark for the jazz improviser.

His powers as a composer were also in evidence in this period: the ballad &quot;Beatrice&quot; from &quot;Fuchsia Swing Song&quot; has become an important standard, particularly for tenor saxophonists. For instance, it is the first cut on Joe Henderson&#x27;s 1985 &quot;The State of the Tenor, Vols. 1 &amp; 2&quot;, and Stan Getz recorded it during the 1989 sessions eventually issued as &quot;Bossas &amp; Ballads – The Lost Sessions&quot;.

== Loft era ==
During the 1970s, Rivers and his wife, Beatrice, ran a jazz loft called &quot;Studio Rivbea&quot; in New York City&#x27;s NoHo district. It was located on Bond Street in Lower Manhattan and was originally opened as a public performance space as part of the first New York Musicians Festival in 1970. Critic John Litweiler has written that &quot;In New York Loft Jazz meant Free Jazz in the Seventies&quot; and Studio Rivbea was &quot;the most famous of the lofts&quot;. The loft was important in the development of jazz because it was an example of artists creating their own performance spaces and taking responsibility for presenting music to the public. This allowed for music to be free of extra-musical concerns that would be present in a nightclub or concert hall situation. A series of recordings made at the loft were issued under the title &quot;&quot; on the Douglas label.

Rivers was also recruited by Clifford Thornton to lead a student world-music/free-jazz ensemble at Wesleyan University in 1971. During this era Rivers continued to record, including several albums for Impulse!: &quot;Streams&quot;, recorded live at Montreux, &quot;Hues&quot; (both records contain different trio performances later collated on CD as &quot;Trio Live&quot;), the quartet album &quot;Sizzle&quot; and his first big-band disc, &quot;Crystals&quot;; perhaps his best-known work from this period though is his appearance on Dave Holland&#x27;s &quot;Conference of the Birds&quot;, in the company of Anthony Braxton and Barry Altschul.

== Later career ==
In the early 1990s, he and his wife moved to Florida, in part to expand his orchestra compositions with a reading band in Orlando. This band became the longest-running incarnation of the RivBea Orchestra. He performed regularly with his Orchestra and Trio with bassist Doug Mathews and drummer Anthony Cole (later replaced by Rion Smith.) From 1996 to 1998 he toured and recorded three projects for Nato Records in France with pianist Tony Hymas and others. In 1998, with the assistance of Steve Coleman, he recorded two Grammy-nominated big-band albums for RCA Victor with the RivBea All-Star Orchestra, &quot;Culmination&quot; and &quot;Inspiration&quot; (the title-track is an elaborate reworking of Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s &quot;Tanga&quot;: Rivers was in Gillespie&#x27;s band near the end of the trumpeter&#x27;s life). Other late albums of note include &quot;Portrait&quot;, a solo recording for FMP, and &quot;Vista&quot;, a trio with drummers Adam Rudolph and Harris Eisenstadt for Meta. During the late 1990s he appeared on several albums on Postcards Records.

In 2005, he released &quot;Aurora&quot;, a third CD featuring compositions for his Rivbea Orchestra and the first CD featuring members of his working orchestra in Orlando. 2011 saw the release of &quot;Trilogy&quot;, a three-CD box set featuring 22 previously-unheard compositions performed by many of the same musicians.

Rivers died from pneumonia on December 26, 2011, at the age of 88 in Orlando, Florida.

During 2019–2022, NoBusiness Records issued six live albums as part of their Sam Rivers Archive Series, featuring previously unreleased music drawn from Rivers&#x27;s extensive collection of recordings.

<doc id="512999" wikidata="Q302965" url="?curid=512999" title="Y-chromosomal Aaron">
<text>Y-chromosomal Aaron is the name given to the hypothesized most recent common ancestor of the patrilineal Jewish priestly caste known as (singular , also spelled ). According to the traditional understanding of the Hebrew Bible, this ancestor was Aaron, the brother of Moses. A historical-critical reading of the biblical text suggests that the origin of the priesthood could have been much more complex, and that for much if not all of the First Temple period, may have not (necessarily) been synonymous with &quot;Aaronide&quot;. Rather, this traditional identity seems to have been adopted sometime around the Second Temple period.

The original scientific research was based on the hypothesis that a majority of present-day Jewish Kohanim share a pattern of values for six Y-STR markers, which researchers named the extended &quot;Cohen Modal Haplotype&quot; (CMH). Subsequent research using twelve Y-STR markers indicated that nearly half of contemporary Jewish Kohanim shared Y-chromosomal J1 M267 (specifically haplogroup J-P58, also called J1c3), while other Kohanim share a different ancestry, such as haplogroup J2a (J-M410).
While these genetic studies were seen as possibly supporting the traditional biblical narrative, subsequent research (by the original researchers and others) has challenged this conclusion in a number of ways and has in fact shown that the genealogical record &quot;refutes the idea of a single founder for Jewish Cohanim who lived in Biblical times&quot;, and rather &quot;seems to vindicate the historical-critical hypothesis of competing priestly clans.&quot;

==Background==

For human beings, the normal number of chromosomes is 46, of which 23 are inherited from each parent. Two chromosomes, the X and Y, determine sex. Females have two X chromosomes, one inherited from each of their parents. Males have an X chromosome inherited from their mother, and a Y chromosome inherited from their father.

Males who share a common patrilineal ancestor also share a common Y chromosome, diverging only with respect to accumulated mutations. Since Y-chromosomes are passed from father to son, all Kohanim men should theoretically have nearly identical Y chromosomes; this can be assessed with a genealogical DNA test. As the mutation rate on the Y chromosome is relatively constant, scientists can estimate the elapsed time since two men had a common ancestor.

Although Jewish identity has traditionally (according to rabbinic-Jewish law I.E. since around the 1st century CE) been passed by matrilineal descent, membership in the Jewish Kohanim caste has been determined by patrilineal descent (see Presumption of priestly descent). Modern Kohanim are traditionally regarded in Judaism as male descendants of biblical Aaron, a direct patrilineal descendant of Abraham, according to the lineage recorded in the Hebrew Bible (שמות / Sh&#x27;mot/Exodus 6).

With the development of methods to follow specific DNA sequences of the human genome, interest in the Cohanim (and Levites) has gained new momentum as an instrument for proof of the common origins of the current Jewish ethnic-groups in the population of the Land of Israel two thousand years ago, as narrated in the biblical story. Skorecki, who carried out the initial study, told the journalist Jon Entine, &quot;I was interested in the question: To what extent was our shared oral tradition matched by other evidence?&quot;

==Initial study==
The Kohen hypothesis was first tested through DNA analysis in 1997 by Karl Skorecki and collaborators from Haifa, Israel. In their study, &quot;Y chromosomes of Jewish priests&quot;, published in the journal &quot;Nature,&quot; they found that the Kohanim appeared to share a different probability distribution compared to the rest of the Jewish population for the two Y-chromosome markers they tested (YAP and DYS19). They also found that the probabilities appeared to be shared by both Sephardic and Ashkenazi Kohens, pointing to a common Kohen population origin before the Jewish diaspora at the destruction of the Second Temple. However, this study also indicated that only 48% of Ashkenazi Kohens and 58% of Sephardic Kohens have the J1 Cohen Modal Haplotype. Such genetic markers were also found in approximately 5% of Jews who did not believe themselves to be kohanim.

In a subsequent study the next year (Thomas MG &quot;et al.&quot;, 1998), the team increased the number of Y-STR markers tested to six, as well as testing more SNP markers. Again, they found that a clear difference was observable between the Kohanim population and the general Jewish population, with many of the Kohen STR results clustered around a single pattern they named the Kohen Modal Haplotype:

Here, becoming increasingly specific, xDE is the proportion who were not in Haplogroups D or E (from the original paper); xDE,PR is the proportion who were not in haplogroups D, E, P, Q or R; Hg J is the proportion who were in Haplogroup J (from the slightly larger panel studied by Behar et al. (2003)); CMH.1 means &quot;within one marker of the CMH-6&quot;; and CMH is the proportion with a 6/6 match. The final two columns show the conditional proportions for CMH.1 and CMH, given membership of Haplogroup J.

The data show that the Kohanim were more than twice as likely to belong to Haplogroup J than the average non-Cohen Jew. Of those who did belong to Haplogroup J, the Kohanim were more than twice as likely to have an STR pattern close to the CMH-6, suggesting a much more recent common ancestry for most of them compared to an average non-Kohen Jew of Haplogroup J.

===Dating===
Thomas, &quot;et al.&quot; dated the origin of the shared DNA to approximately 3,000 years ago (with variance arising from different generation lengths). The techniques used to find Y-chromosomal Aaron were first popularized in relation to the search for the patrilineal ancestor of all contemporary living humans, Y-chromosomal Adam.

Subsequent calculations under the coalescent model for J1 haplotypes bearing the Cohanim motif gave time estimates that place the origin of this genealogy around 6,200 years ago (95% CI: 4.5–8.6 Kybp), earlier than previously thought, and well before the origin of Judaism (David Kingdom, ~2.0 Kybp).

===Responses===
The finding led to excitement in religious circles, with some seeing it as providing some proof of the historical veracity of the priestly covenant or other religious convictions.

Following the discovery of the very high prevalence of 6/6 CMH matches amongst Kohanim, other researchers and analysts were quick to look for it. Some groups have taken the presence of this haplotype as indicating possible Jewish ancestry, although the chromosome is not exclusive to Jews. It is widely found among other Semitic peoples of the Middle East.

Early research suggested that the 6/6 matches found among male Lemba of Southern Africa confirmed their oral history of descent from Jews and connection to Jewish culture. Later research has been unable to confirm this (due to the fact that CMH was widely found among other Semitic peoples of the Middle East) although it has shown that some male Lemba have Middle Eastern ancestry.

Critics such as Avshalom Zoossmann-Diskin suggested that the paper&#x27;s evidence was being overstated in terms of showing Jewish descent among these distant populations.

==Limitations==

One source of early confusion was the low resolution of the available tests. The Cohen Modal Haplotype (CMH), while frequent amongst Kohanim, also appeared in the general populations of haplogroups J1 and J2 with no particular link to the Kohen ancestry. These haplogroups occur widely throughout the Middle East and beyond. Thus, while many Kohanim have haplotypes close to the CMH, a greater number of such haplotypes worldwide belong to people with no apparent connection to the Jewish priesthood.

Individuals with at least 5/6 matches for the original 6-marker Cohen Modal Haplotype are found across the Middle East, with significant frequencies among various Arab populations, mainly those with the J1 Haplogroup. These have not been &quot;traditionally considered admixed with mainstream Jewish populations&quot; – the frequency of the J1 Haplogroup is the following: Yemen (34.2%), Oman (22.8%), Negev (21.9%), and Iraq (19.2%); and amongst Muslim Kurds (22.1%), Bedouins (21.9%), and Armenians (12.7%).

On the other hand, Jewish populations were found to have a &quot;markedly higher&quot; proportion of full 6/6 matches, according to the same (2005) meta-analysis. This was compared to these non-Jewish populations, where &quot;individuals matching at only 5/6 markers are most commonly observed&quot;.

The authors Elkins, et al., warned in their report that &quot;using the current CMH definition to infer relation of individuals or groups to the Cohen or ancient Hebrew populations would produce many false-positive results&quot;, and noted that &quot;it is possible that the originally defined CMH represents a slight permutation of a more general Middle Eastern type that was established early on in the population prior to the divergence of haplogroup J. Under such conditions, parallel convergence in divergent clades to the same STR haplotype would be possible&quot;.

Cadenas &quot;et al.&quot; analysed Y-DNA patterns from around the Gulf of Oman in more detail in 2007. The detailed data confirm that the main cluster of haplogroup J1 haplotypes from the Yemeni appears to be some genetic distance from the CMH-12 pattern typical of eastern European Ashkenazi Kohanim, but not of Sephardic Kohanim.

===Multiple ancestries===
While there is evidence from Josephus and rabbinic sources that this tradition existed [I.E. was practiced and believed] by the end of the Second Temple (1st century CE, nearly a millennium and a half after the tradition places Aaron), there is no further evidence to support its historicity. According to modern biblical scholarship, a historical-critical reading of the biblical text suggests that the origin of the priesthood is much more complex, and that for much if not all of the First Temple period, kohen was not (necessarily) synonymous with &quot;Aaronide&quot;. Rather, this traditional identity seems to have been adopted sometime around the second temple period.

Even within the Jewish Kohen population, it became clear that there were multiple Kohen lineages, including distinctive lineages both in Haplogroup J1 and in haplogroup J2. Other groups of Jewish lineages (i.e. Jews who are non-kohanim) and even non-Jews were found in Haplogroup J2 that matched the original 6-marker CMH, but which were unrelated and not associated with Kohanim. Current estimates, based on the accumulation of SNP mutations, place the defining mutations that distinguish haplogroups J1 and J2 as having occurred about 20 to 30,000 years ago.

==Subsequent studies==

Subsequent research (by the original researchers and others) has challenged the original conclusion in a number of ways and has in fact shown that the genealogical record &quot;refutes the idea of a single founder for Jewish Cohanim who lived in Biblical times.&quot;

A 2009 academic study by Michael F. Hammer, Doron M. Behar, et al. examined more STR markers in order to sharpen the &quot;resolution&quot; of these Kohanim genetic markers, thus separating both Ashkenazi and other Jewish Kohanim from other populations, and identifying a more sharply defined SNP haplogroup, J1e* (now J1c3, also called J-P58*) for the J1 lineage. The research found &quot;that 46.1% of Kohanim carry Y chromosomes belonging to a single paternal lineage (J-P58*) that likely originated in the Near East well before the dispersal of Jewish groups in the Diaspora. Support for a Near Eastern origin of this lineage comes from its high frequency in our sample of Bedouins, Yemenis (67%), and Jordanians (55%) and its precipitous drop in frequency as one moves away from Saudi Arabia and the Near East (Fig. 4). Moreover, there is a striking contrast between the relatively high frequency of J-58* in Jewish populations (»20%) and Kohanim (»46%) and its vanishingly low frequency in our sample of non-Jewish populations that hosted Jewish diaspora communities outside of the Near East.&quot; The authors state, in their &quot;Abstract&quot; to the article:
:&quot;These results support the hypothesis of a common origin of the CMH in the Near East well before the dispersion of the Jewish people into separate communities, and indicate that the majority of contemporary Jewish priests descend from a limited number of paternal lineages.&quot;

However, the study did not support a single Y-chromosomal Aaron from the biblical period, rather it showed a &quot;limited number of paternal lineages&quot; from around that period. Subsequent analysis found that even the &quot;extended Cohen Modal Haplotype&quot; probably split off from an older Cohen haplotype far more recently, less than 1,500 years ago.

==Kohanim in other haplogroups==
Behar&#x27;s 2003 data point to the following Haplogroup distribution for Ashkenazi Kohanim (AC) and Sephardic Kohanim (SC) as a whole:

The detailed breakdown by 6-marker haplotype (the paper&#x27;s Table B, available only online) suggests that at least some of these groups (e.g. E3b, R1b) contain more than one distinct Kohen lineage. It is possible that other lineages may also exist, but were not captured in the sample.

Hammer et al. (2009) identified Cohanim from diverse backgrounds, having in all 21 differing Y-chromosome haplogroups: E-M78, E-M123, G-M285, G-P15, G-M377, H-M69, I-M253, J-P58, J-M172*, J-M410*, J-M67, J-M68, J-M318, J-M12, L-M20, Q-M378, R-M17, R-P25*, R-M269, R-M124 AND T-M70.
==Y-chromosomal Levi==
Similar investigation was made of males who identify as Levites. The priestly Kohanim are believed to have descended from Aaron (among those who believe he was a historical figure). He was a descendant of Levi, son of Jacob. The Levites comprised a lower rank of the Temple priests. They are considered descendants of Levi through other lineages. Levites should also therefore in theory share common Y-chromosomal DNA.
However, similar studies into Levite origins found the Levite genome to be significantly less homogeneous. While commonalities were found within the Ashkenazi-Levite genome (R1a-Y2619), no haplotype frequently common to Levites in general [I.E. Ashkenazi &amp; Sephardi] was found. Additionally, the haplotype that was commonly found in Ashkenazi Levites is of a relatively recent origin from a single common ancestor estimated to have lived around 1.5–2.5 thousand years ago. Also, when further compared to the most frequent founding lineage found among Ashkenazi Cohen males, it was found that they do not share a common male ancestor within the time frame of the Biblical narrative. Finally, it is unclear whether the origin is Eastern Europe or the greater Middle East region (including Iran); however, the most recent findings indicate the latter.

The 2003 Behar et al. investigation of Levites found high frequencies of multiple distinct markers, suggestive of multiple origins for the majority of non-Aaronid Levite families. One marker, however, present in more than 50% of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish Levites, points to a common male ancestor or very few male ancestors within the last 2000 years for many Levites of the Ashkenazi community. This common ancestor belonged to the haplogroup R1a1, which is typical of Eastern Europeans or West Asians, rather than the haplogroup J of the Cohen modal haplotype. The authors proposed that the Levite ancestor(s) most likely lived at the time of the Ashkenazi settlement in Eastern Europe, and would thus be considered founders of this line. further speculating that the ancestor(s) were unlikely to have descended from Levites of the Near East.

However, a Rootsi, Behar, et al. study published online in &quot;Nature Communications&quot; in December 2013 disputed the previous conclusion. Based on its research into 16 whole R1 sequences, the team determined that a set of 19 unique nucleotide substitutions defines the Ashkenazi R1a lineage. One of these is not found among Eastern Europeans, but the marker was present &quot;in all sampled R1a Ashkenazi Levites, as well as in 33.8% of other R1a Ashkenazi Jewish males, and 5.9% of 303 R1a Near Eastern males, where it shows considerably higher diversity.&quot; Rootsi, Behar, et al., concluded that this marker most likely originates in the pre-Diasporic Hebrews in the Middle East. However, they agreed that the data indicates an origin from a single common ancestor.

==Samaritan Kohanim==
The Samaritan community in the Middle East survives as a distinct religious and cultural sect. It constitutes one of the oldest and smallest ethnic minorities in the Middle East, numbering slightly more than 800 members. According to Samaritan accounts, Samaritan Kohanim are descended from Levi, the Tsedaka clan is descended from Manasseh, while the Dinfi clan and the Marhiv clan are descended from Ephraim. Samaritans claim that the southern tribes of the House of Judah left the original worship as set forth by Joshua, and the schism took place in the twelfth century BCE at the time of Eli. The Samaritans have maintained their religion and history to this day, and claim to be the remnant of the House of Israel, specifically of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh with priests of the line of Aaron/Levi.

Since the Samaritans have maintained extensive and detailed genealogical records for the past 13–15 generations (approximately 400 years) and further back, researchers have constructed accurate pedigrees and specific maternal and paternal lineages. A 2004 Y-Chromosome study concluded that the lay Samaritans belong to haplogroups J1 and J2, while the Samaritan Kohanim belong to haplogroup E-M35.

&quot;The Samaritan M267 lineages differed from the classical Cohen modal haplotype at DYS391, carrying 11 rather than 10 repeats&quot;, as well as, have a completely different haplogroup, which should have been &quot;J1&quot;. Samaritan Kohanim descend from a different patrilineal family line, having haplogroup E1b1b1a (M78) (formerly E3b1a).

<doc id="513002" wikidata="Q981284" url="?curid=513002" title="Switha">
<text>Switha is a small uninhabited island towards the south of Orkney, Scotland, approximately 41 hectares in area.

==Geography and geology==
Switha lies 2 km to the south of the island of Flotta and 2 km east of the South Walls area of Hoy. South Ronaldsay lies about 5 km further east. The island is roughly rectangular in shape, about 1 km by 0.5 km in size and is aligned in a NE to SW direction. The maximum elevation is 28 m, found on the small cliff on the south coast, to the west of which is the only appreciable beach at The Pool. Geologically, the island is wholly of Old Red Sandstone, from the Devonian period, specifically Rousay Flagstones, dating from about 375 MYA, laid down by a cyclical series of lakes and containing many fish fossils.

==Flora==
The island is predominantly maritime grassland with small areas of heath and bog.

==Wildlife==
Switha is very important for wildlife and has been designated both as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and an EU Special Protection Area. The primary reason for this is the wintering population of Greenland barnacle goose. About 1000 of the birds are thought to spend the winter months roosting on the island and feeding on nearby South Walls. This population is not only the most northerly in the UK but also the third largest after Islay and North Uist. Common seabirds known to frequent the rocky coast line include black guillemot, great black-backed gull, Arctic skua and great skua. In addition, Haswell-Smith records that there are many European storm petrel burrows. However, several surveys since the late 1960s have only revealed a small number of pairs on the island, probably never more than 10. The burrows are probably more likely to belong to the puffin, which are reported to be resident on the island in some numbers, with about 250 pairs.

==History==

===Pre-history===

The presence of Neolithic standing stones and a cairn show that the island was at least visited in prehistoric times. There are two standing stones, the larger, southerly stone is 147 cm high, by 91 cm wide and 30 cm deep. The northerly stone is 112 cm high, 48 cm wide and just 15 cm deep and is thus somewhat smaller. Further evidence of pre-historic use is provided by the presence of a 9 m diameter by 0.5 m high turf covered cairn, near The Ool at the southern tip of the island. When excavated the cairn contained a cist-like structure.

Haswell-Smith (2004) maintains there is no written record of any post-Neolithic habitation, and there are 3 further sources that would support that assertion, at least for the past 350 years. The Blaeu &quot;Atlas of Scotland&quot; (1654) stated that the island was &quot;neither inhabited nor cultivated&quot;. The &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of Scotland&quot;, published in 1848, stated that the island was uninhabited. Finally, the Ordnance Survey map of 1882 doesn&#x27;t indicate any significant building or habitation, although the enclosure mentioned below would seem to be present. Whether the island was uninhabited prior to 1654 is less certain since the &quot;Descriptions of Orkney&quot;, written in 1529, states that the entire population of an island, &quot;Southay&quot; presumed to refer to Switha, is said to have died while sailing to a Christmas celebration on a neighboring island, and the island had never been populated since. In addition, there are archeological remains that could represent old dwellings, for instance a stone closure at the southern end of the island.

===Agricultural use===

The island would seem to have had a long history of use for agriculture, at least for keeping stock. In current times the island is wholly used for sheep grazing. Older texts support the island&#x27;s use for other livestock however, for instance it is recorded that in 1747–48, 11 oxen were kept on Switha, part of the Burray inventory.

Swona is the more northerly of two islands in the Pentland Firth between the Orkney Islands and Caithness on the Scottish mainland. It lies in the southern approach to Scapa Flow, west of South Ronaldsay.

Situated in the tidal stream of the Pentland Firth, a tidal race is present at both the north and south ends of the island, being minimal briefly at the turn of the tide. Between the races is a calm eddy which extends down-tide as the tide strengthens. The races are highly visible, with over-falls and whirlpools. Large swell waves can also be present, especially in bad weather conditions. When entering or leaving the eddies crossing the races, even large powerful vessels can be pushed off course, such is the demarcation between the relatively calm eddy and the fast-moving tide in the races.

Swona is about long by about wide, with a maximum height of approximately and an area of about . It is made up of Old Red Sandstone with cliffs on the east coast.

It is administered as part of the Orkney Islands, while Stroma, to the south, is part of the Highland Region (although traditionally part of Caithness). There is no regular access to the island, however, the Pentland Ferries sailing from Gills Bay, near John o&#x27; Groats, to St Margaret&#x27;s Hope usually passes close to the island, dependent on the tidal direction at the time.

In 2005 Swona was owned by two Orkney farmers, but not worked due to difficulty of access. It is a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) conservation area with a number of rare plants.

==History==
The island takes its name from Old Norse, &quot;Svíney&quot; or &quot;Swefney&quot;, meaning either &quot;Swine Isle&quot; or &quot;Sweyn&#x27;s Isle&quot;. There is a similarly named island, Svínoy, in the Faroe Islands.

There are prehistoric, pre-Norse and Norse remains on the island. More recent crofting settlement remains include a herd of feral cattle. The island was populated from around 500 BC until 1974.

Boats were built on the island for a number of years. The last of these, the &quot;Hood&quot; can be seen pulled well up the shingle beach by the landing stage. It is no longer seaworthy, having a hole in it caused by the feral cows using it as a rubbing post. The landing stage and boat can be seen briefly in passing through a gap in the rocks near the north end of the island on the east side. The last house to be occupied can also be seen in this area.

The island was the site of many shipwrecks caused by the strong currents in the Pentland Firth. In 1931, a 6,000 ton Danish freighter called &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was wrecked on the island. The Orkney newspaper of the time said that it was one of the most richly-laden ships that was ever wrecked in the area. After some salvaging, the wreck was finally bought by a syndicate of Stroma and Swona men.

The Swona Minor light was built in 1906 on the south west tip of Swona. It was originally a cast iron tower but was replaced by a reinforced concrete square tower sometime in the 1980s. The earlier Stroma Lighthouse was built in 1896 and stands at the northern end of the Island of Stroma.

In summer 1973 Arthur Rosie left the island and died shortly afterwards. James and Violet Rosie (brother and sister) left in March 1974. James had Parkinsons Disease and died c. 1976 of a perforated stomach ulcer. Violet died c. 1984 in South Ronaldsay. They returned only periodically to the island. Many of the houses, while in a state of dilapidation, are as they were left, with various possessions still to be seen where they were left.

Swona is one of the locations described in Cal Flyn&#x27;s &quot;Islands of Abandonment: Life in the Post-Human Landscape&quot; (2020, William Collins: ).

In July 2022 the Pentland Ferries&#x27; , running between Gills Bay and St Margaret&#x27;s Hope, grounded on Swona. &quot;Alfred&quot; was refloated within one and a half hours.

==Wildlife==

When the population departed they left a herd of beef cattle – eight cows and one bull (Shorthorn - Aberdeen-Angus cross). Five generations later, in 2004, the herd which had turned feral was still going strong, and is now classified as a new breed in the &quot;World Dictionary of Livestock Breeds&quot;. It then consisted of ten bulls, four cows and two calves. Two calves are born each spring, although not all live to maturity. The herd gets no additional feed, although it is checked by a vet each year. The animals are self-selecting for hardiness, easy calving, and low-maintenance, feeding off the grass and seaweed.

Having been separated from the mainland for so long, they are completely disease-free, and have reverted to wild behaviour. Because of this, DNA samples have been taken, from the ears of some of the cattle that died. In the summer the main herd is usually in the centre of the island. By 2012 the herd had settled to an average of seventeen animals. This appears to be around the maximum number that the island can support. In 2017 The BBC documentary series &quot;Britain&#x27;s Ancient Capital: Secrets of Orkney&quot; briefly visited Swona; Chris Packham counted twenty cows and calves and three bulls.

===Birds===
The island is part of the Pentland Firth Islands Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is home to thousands of breeding seabirds, including Arctic terns, which have a colony on the northern part of the island, and Atlantic puffins, which burrow into the hillside. It is also part of the Pentland Firth Islands Important Bird Area (IBA), so designated by BirdLife International because it supports significant breeding populations of seabirds.

<text>Chico MacMurtrie was born in New Mexico in 1961. MacMurtrie received his M.F.A. from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and is internationally recognized as a media artist exploring the intersection of robotic sculpture, installation, and performance. In 1991 MacMurtrie formed Amorphic Robot Works, a group of artists and engineers working together to create robotic art performances and installations. Throughout the 1990s, Chico MacMurtrie / Amorphic Robot Works created a body of work composed of hundreds of kinetic, at times percussive or musical metal sculptures which have been exhibited in different configurations mostly throughout Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In 2004, MacMurtrie operated a material shift from working with metal to creating his sculptures out of high tensile fabric. The inflatable sculptures or &quot;Inflatable Architectural Bodies&quot; are concerned with organic form and the expression of transient qualities of human or animal movement embodied through abstract robotic form.

MacMurtrie is a Guggenheim Fellow and has previously been awarded five grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. Other grants and awards he received include the San Francisco Bay Guardian Goldie Award; Prix Ars Electronica; Vida | Life; the New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship; the Map Fund Grant, and the Media Arts Foundation Grant.

The artist&#x27;s most notable public sculpture is &quot;Urge to Stand&quot; and permanently installed at Yerba Buena Gardens in San Francisco, California. This sculpture was created in 1999, and is composed of an androgynous metal figure standing or sitting on top of a 12-foot earth sphere linked to a bench, reacting to visitors sitting or standing up. Other public commissions include &quot;Fetus to Man&quot; a sculpture/clock for the city of Lille in France, and &quot;Growing Raining Tree&quot; commissioned by the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati Ohio.

ARW&#x27;s Artistic Director Chico MacMurtrie, describes his vision, &quot;The work is an ongoing endeavor to uncover the primacy of movement and sound. Each machine is inspired or influenced, both, by modern society, and what I physically experience and sense. The whole of this input informs my ideas and work.&quot;

<doc id="513021" wikidata="Q1429561" url="?curid=513021" title="Island of Stroma">
<text>Stroma is an uninhabited island in the Pentland Firth, between Orkney and the mainland of Scotland. It forms part of the civil parish of Canisbay in Caithness, in the council area of Highland. The name comes from the Old Norse &quot;Straumey&quot;, meaning &quot;island in the current&quot;.

Ancient stone structures testify to the presence of Stroma&#x27;s earliest residents, while a Norse presence around 900–1,000 years ago is recorded in the &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot;. It has been politically united with Caithness since at least the 15th century. Although Stroma lies only a few miles off the Scottish coast, the savage weather and ferociously strong tides of the Pentland Firth meant that the island&#x27;s inhabitants were very isolated, causing them to be largely self-sufficient, trading agricultural produce and fish with the mainlanders.

Most of the islanders were fishermen and crofters; some also worked as maritime pilots to guide vessels through the treacherous waters of the Pentland Firth. The tides and currents meant that shipwrecks were frequent—the most recent occurring in 1993—and salvage provided an additional though often illegal supplement to the islanders&#x27; incomes. A lighthouse was built on Stroma in 1890 and still operates under automation.

Stroma is now abandoned, with the houses of its former inhabitants unoccupied and falling into ruin. Its population fell gradually through the first half of the 20th century as inhabitants drifted away to seek opportunities elsewhere, as economic problems and Stroma&#x27;s isolation made life on the island increasingly unsupportable. From an all-time peak of 375 people in 1901, the population fell to just 12 by 1961 and the last islanders left at the end of the following year. Stroma&#x27;s final abandonment came in 1997 when the lighthouse keepers and their families departed. The island is now owned by one of its former inhabitants, who uses it to graze sheep.

== Geography, geology, flora and fauna ==

Stroma is located in the Pentland Firth about northwest of John o&#x27; Groats on the mainland. The island divides the firth into two channels, the Inner Sound to the south and the Outer Sound to the north. It is mostly low-lying and flat, covering an area of around and rising to a height of at Cairn Hill in the southeast. It is oriented in a north-south direction, measuring about long by wide.

The tidal race at the north end of Stroma, off Swelkie Point, is known as &quot;The Swelkie&quot;. It extends from the point in an easterly or westerly direction depending on the tide and can be particularly violent. The whirlpool, according to a Nordic tradition recorded in the Eddas, is caused by two gýgjar named Fenja and Menja turning the millstone Grótti, which grinds out the ocean&#x27;s salt. The witches &#x27;Grotti Finnie&#x27; and &#x27;Grotti Minnie&#x27; feature in later Orcadian and Shetlandic folklore. The name of the race is derived from the , meaning &quot;the Swallower&quot;.

The island is ringed by cliffs that vary in height from around on the west coast to low cliffs with a narrow rocky foreshore elsewhere. The eastern side of the island slopes downward in an easterly or southeasterly direction, with the angle of the slope increasing from around 3 degrees in the centre of the island to about 30 degrees on the east coast. The bedrock of the island consists of flat layers of weathered Middle Old Red Sandstone, known as Rousay flags. A six-foot band of the fine-grained stone used to be quarried on a small scale for use on the mainland as roofing material. It is similar in composition to the Mey Beds on the mainland, though in some places on Stroma it is replaced by beds of angular and rounded masses of sandstone in a nodular matrix, similar to the Ackergill Beds in Caithness. Only fragmentary fossil remains have been found; these include specimens of the extinct Devonian fish &quot;Dipterus&quot; and &quot;Coccosteus&quot;.

Stroma is bisected by a fault which runs in a north-south direction through its centre, intersected by another fault running in an east-northeast direction across the north of the island. The soil on either side of the fault line is significantly different; the eastern and southern parts of Stroma are covered by fertile clay fed by bedrock minerals, while less fertile boggy ground predominates on the west side.

The heavily indented coastline has a circumference of about , punctuated by numerous geos or inlets created by the waves eroding the sea cliffs along fault lines. A partially collapsed sea cave called The Gloup is located in the northwest of the island. This feature is a deep rocky pit, filled with sea water. It is located at the junction of the two fault lines and is connected to the sea by a subterranean passage long, created by erosion along the east-northeast fault. The passage is said to have been used for smuggling; the islanders reportedly concealed illegal distilling from HM Customs and Excise by hiding the stills and alcohol in a cave within The Gloup, called &quot;the Malt Barn&quot;, which was only accessible at low tide.

The flora and fauna of Stroma are similar to those of the mainland. The island is treeless; its vegetation consists primarily of grasses, heather and small flowers. Seals are plentiful along its shores and are sometimes found inland during the breeding season. Both grey seals and harbour seals are present, with around 650 grey seal pups being born each year. Otters may also be present, as in other parts of mainland Caithness. The western cliffs are the site of colonies of terns, guillemots, fulmars and eider ducks. The cliffs are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the North Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area. The waters off Stroma support a number of cetacean species including minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise.

== Demographics ==
Two settlements existed on Stroma: Nethertown, in the north of the island, and Uppertown or Overtown, in the south. They originally belonged to the Freswick estate, which owned Nethertown, and the Mey estate, which owned Uppertown. Between the two was Mains of Stroma, the island&#x27;s principal farm. A track runs the entire length of the island, connecting the lighthouse at the north tip with the two settlements and the harbour on the south coast.

The island is now uninhabited; the last resident islanders left in 1962 and the very last inhabitants, the keepers of the island lighthouse and their families, left in 1997 when the lighthouse was automated. The population reached a peak of 375 in 1901 but censuses conducted between 1841 and 1961 tell the story of the collapse of Stroma&#x27;s population during the 20th century:

== History ==

=== Prehistoric settlement and remains ===
Stroma was inhabited in prehistoric times, as demonstrated by the presence of a number of ancient stone structures around the island. A ruined chambered cairn is situated at the far north end of the island near the lighthouse. It has been partially excavated and measures some in diameter by high. The 18th-century inhabitants of the island collected the prehistoric stone arrowheads that they found on the western side of the island, believing them to be &quot;elf-shot&quot;, and regarded them as having been made by fairies. They believed that if they possessed an &quot;elf-shot&quot; they would be granted protection for themselves and their cattle from any harm caused by the fairies.

Structures similar to cists, which the islanders called &quot;Picts&#x27; Beds&quot;, are also found on the island. Notable examples can be seen in the north near Nethertown. They are usually located near middens, out of which animal bones and shells are eroding. Little appears to be known about the purpose and origins of these structures. Although the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland attributes them to prehistory, it is also possible that they are Norse in origin. A kidney-shaped burnt mound located near Castle Geo in the south-east of Stroma can be more confidently ascribed to prehistory. It consists of an accumulation of cracked and scorched stones that were used to heat water in a communal cooking trough. Although the example on Stroma has not been dated, burnt mounds found elsewhere on Orkney and Shetland have been dated to the Bronze Age and the early Iron Age.

The remains of an earth-and-stone fort are situated on the promontory of Bught o&#x27; Camm on the west coast of Stroma, near the north end of the island, though its origins are unknown. A rampart standing with an average spread of encloses an area of some and blocks off access to the promontory. There is no evidence of structures inside the fort&#x27;s perimeter. It may possibly have been entered from the east end of the rampart, where a gap exists, but this may alternatively have been produced by natural processes.

=== Medieval period ===

The first historical record of the island is found in the 12th-century &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot;. It records that a man named Valthiof, the son of Olaf Rolfson, lived and farmed on Stroma. One Yule Eve, he set off in a ten-oar boat to Orphir on Mainland, Orkney at the invitation of the Earl of Orkney, Paul Haakonsson. However, the boat was lost with all hands, as the Saga puts it: &quot;sad news as Valthiof was a most accomplished man&quot;. The Earl later granted Valthiof&#x27;s farm to Thorkel Flettir. Later, a rowdy Viking named Sweyn Asleifsson fled to Stroma, pursued by Earl Harald Haakonsson. The two men were trapped on the island due to bad weather but were persuaded to make peace by a mutual friend named Asmundi, who insisted that Sweyn and Harald should share the same bed.

The Norse are also believed to have built a fortification, now called Castle Mestag, at Mell Head in the far south-west of Stroma. The structure (also known as &quot;the Robber&#x27;s Castle&quot;) is situated on the top of an isolated rock stack some from the cliffs of the main island. The islanders believed that it had once been connected by a drawbridge or some other kind of artificial span, or alternatively it may once have been accessible via a rock arch that has since collapsed.

Due to its proximity to the Scottish mainland, Stroma has long been politically united with Caithness. An old story tells that possession of the island was once disputed between the Earls of Orkney and Caithness. To resolve the dispute, they relied on a legend that venomous animals would thrive in Caithness but die in Orkney. Some venomous snakes were duly imported to Stroma and survived there, &quot;proving&quot; that the island did belong to Caithness and not Orkney.

It is more reliably recorded that in 1455 the Bishop of Caithness, William Mudy, granted Stroma and other lands and castles to his brother Gilbert. It eventually passed into the hands of the Sinclair family, who have held the title of Earl of Caithness since 1455. In 1659 George Sinclair, the 6th Earl of Caithness, granted the wadset of Stroma to John Kennedy of Kermuck, who had fled to the far north after being outlawed following the fatal wounding of John Forbes of Watertown.

115 years later, the Rev. George Low recorded in his account of a tour of the island that he had seen &quot;the remains of a pretty large house and gardens, once possessed by a gentleman, the proprietor of the island, who being forced to fly his native home on account of a duel, chose this for his retreat&quot;. The gardens were said to have been furnished with &quot;plants that cured every disease&quot;. Nothing is now left of the house, but the gardens may have been located within a walled enclosure near the Nethertown pier.

=== Life on Stroma: 17th and 18th centuries ===

Life on the island was very isolated due to its inaccessibility. Until as late as 1894 it had no landing place, which meant that boats had to be landed directly on the beach and pulled up above the waterline. Particularly in winter, when storms raged through the Pentland Firth, Stroma could be cut off for weeks at a time. Such episodes posed serious risks to the islanders, as they had no doctor. The winter of 1937 illustrated the problems that the weather could pose; during January and February that year, the island was cut off for three weeks by violent gales which demolished houses along the seafront and washed boats 100 yards (90 m) inland. Stroma&#x27;s isolation came at an especially bad time, as most of the population had caught influenza and supplies of food dwindled to the point that some items had to be rationed. Eventually two boats were able to reach the island, carrying supplies and a doctor from Caithness, along with three weeks&#x27; worth of mail.

Two chapels were established on Stroma at some point prior to the 17th century; they were known as the Kirk of Stara (from the Norse name for &quot;big church&quot;) and the Kirk of Old Skoil (from &quot;Skali&quot;, possibly a name given to a farm). Their locations are now unknown, but the Kirk of Old Skoil may have been located in the far south-east of Stroma where the island&#x27;s graveyard is now. They both fell into disuse by the mid-17th century and, lacking a church of their own, it was perhaps not surprising that the islanders were felt by mainlanders to be somewhat lacking in religious commitment. An inquiry by the Canisbay Kirk in the 17th century rebuked them for visiting &quot;Popish&quot; chapels on the mainland, profaning the Lord&#x27;s Day, being &quot;ale sellers and drinkers&quot; and playing football and dancing on the Sabbath. The Presbytery decided that the inhabitants were spiritually neglected &quot;by reason of the dangerous passage to that place, especially in winter.&quot; The minister of Canisbay was supposed to preach four times a year on Stroma but was reprimanded for only doing so twice yearly. The islanders were instructed to attend church at Canisbay and a kirk session ordained in 1654 that they should be given free passage and that any Stroma person with a boat who stayed away should be fined.

The island&#x27;s population numbered a few dozen families throughout the 18th century, corresponding to a population of no more than a couple of hundred people; it was recorded as numbering 30 families in 1710, 47 in 1724, 40 in 1735 and 30 in 1760. They rented their land from two branches of the Sinclair family, the Sinclairs of Mey who owned Uppertown and the Sinclairs of Freswick who owned Nethertown. The latter acquired Nethertown in 1721 and eventually took possession of Uppertown as well by obtaining the wadset from the Kennedys, reportedly through skullduggery. According to the deathbed confession of one of the witnesses to the transaction, the laird, Sinclair of Freswick, obtained the &quot;assent&quot; of the deceased Kennedy holder of the wadset by placing a quill in the dead man&#x27;s hand and moving it to make the corpse write its name on the document. The other witness committed suicide, perhaps out of guilt. The island was reasonably profitable for the Sinclairs; in 1724 the islanders paid an annual rent of 1,300 marks (equivalent to about £125 at 2011 prices), part of which was paid in surplus grain ferried by Stroma&#x27;s boats to the Sinclair granaries at Staxigoe near Wick. They were self-sufficient in dairy produce and were known for the quality of their cheese-making; Daniel Defoe thought Stroma cheese was excellent.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===

By the early 19th century, around 30 families numbering 170 people lived on Stroma, farming land allocated on the traditional run rig system. The island was said to be &quot;very productive in corn&quot;, though the inhabitants did not make use of ploughs; instead, they dug high beds or ridges, which produced greater yields than ploughing would have. George Low wrote in his 1774 account of the island that &quot;the soil is good, black and deep, thrown up into high ridges by the spade, in a word the whole cultivated part of the Island is dressed like a garden and produces far greater crops than are common on plowed ground.&quot; Agricultural life on the island followed a fairly typical crofting pattern, with the average Stroma croft being about in size. Families usually kept a few cows, sheep and hens, along with a single horse and pig. They grew a variety of crops such as oats, potatoes, hay and turnips, obtained water from wells and used horses to meet their transportation needs. As well as agricultural exports, they also exported flagstones from the island and imported peat to burn as fuel; they were dismissive of the practice in some of the Orkney Islands of using cow dung as fuel, referring to the northern island of Sanday as &quot;the little island where the coos shit fire&quot;. Low observed the effect of the island&#x27;s climate on the inhabitants: &quot;The men are stout hardy spadesmen as was said before, the women while young are tolerably well looked, but as they advance in age grow very hard favoured, acquiring a peculiar ghastliness in their countenances contrary to what is observed of the women in Orkney.&quot;

The islanders also supported themselves through fishing, exploiting the high-quality catches that were to be made around the island&#x27;s coasts. James Traill Calder wrote in his 1861 &quot;Sketch of the Civil and Traditional History of Caithness&quot; that &quot;The finest cod in the north is to be got in the Pentland Firth ... Large and excellent lobsters are caught around the island [of Stroma].&quot; It was said that the cod had &quot;the firmest white flesh of any caught from British waters due to having to continuously swim in strong currents.&quot; As well as trapping lobsters, the islanders practised hand line cod fishing in the waters of the Firth. This involved towing lengths of line with heavy weights and a metal rod or sprool at one end, from which hung a short length of hemp and hook baited with limpets. To encourage the fish to bite, the boats had to be held still by their rowers, which required great skill in the Firth&#x27;s unpredictable currents. The island was noted for its native type of boat, the Stroma yole, which was a direct descendant of the old Norse longship.

Many of the male islanders utilised their knowledge of the Firth&#x27;s currents to hire themselves out to passing vessels as maritime pilots. Their expertise was the product of a lifetime&#x27;s experience on the waters of the Firth; as it was said, they had been &quot;dabbling in salt water from their childhood upwards&quot;. Indeed, the whole island was drenched in salt water thrown up by the powerful tides and storms to which it was subjected, particularly in the winter. The &quot;Statistical Account of Scotland&quot; noted that during a storm the sea level on the west of the island was more than higher than on the east side, and that the spray was thrown so high that it washed over the cliff tops &quot;and falls in such profusion as to run in rills to the opposite shore&quot;. The islanders took advantage of this phenomenon by capturing the water in a reservoir to power a watermill which ground their grain in the winter months. It is not now known exactly where the mill was or what happened to it. Although it is described in the &quot;Statistical Account&quot;, written in the 1790s, and a Robert Miller is listed in the 1851 census as its miller, by 1861 he had moved to farm a croft and no further mention is made of the mill in contemporary accounts.

Stroma&#x27;s violent storms occasionally wrought destruction on the island. In December 1862, a great storm broke over the island with such force that it swept right across the northern end of Stroma, leaving wreckage, rocks and seaweed on the top of the 100-foot-high cliffs and destroying the channels leading to the watermill. However, the sea&#x27;s destructive power had one positive benefit for the islanders, if not for those caught out by the currents and shoals of the Pentland Firth. Over the last two hundred years, over sixty vessels ranging from fishing boats to large cargo vessels have been wrecked on the shores of Stroma, with many more vessels coming to grief on the reefs and shoals of the neighbouring mainland and Orkney coasts. Many vessels – at least 560 between 1830 and 1990 – have had to be refloated in the Pentland Firth after getting into difficulties. Shipwrecks were a valuable source of income, timber and goods for the islanders, who would salvage liberally – and often with little regard for legality – whenever a stranded ship was abandoned. The building of Stroma&#x27;s first lighthouse in the late 19th century was initially opposed by some of the islanders who were more concerned with profiting from shipwrecks than preventing them.
The shipwrecks continued, nonetheless, with one of the most profitable of all being the 1931 wreck of the 6,000-ton Danish freighter &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; on the neighbouring island of Swona. The vessel was plundered by the inhabitants of Stroma, Swona and South Ronaldsay. Much of her cargo of slot machines, spark plugs, clothing, tobacco, watches and car parts was looted and concealed in haystacks, oatfields, lochs and caves. David Stogdon, a lifeboatman, recalled seeing what the islanders did with their illicit salvage: &quot;Every house was stuffed with wreck [salvage] ... clocks, telescopes, binnacles ... I seem to remember enormous dining-room tables in small cottages. And then of course from time to time they&#x27;d have cargo parts of lorries or something like that which could be put together to make a lorry and taken ashore on two or three fishing boats in calm weather. They&#x27;d land it quietly somewhere, drive it along and sell it.&quot; Customs officers, policemen, coastguards and Receivers of Wreck were not generally welcome – the island had no police force – and the islanders let it be understood that unfortunate things could happen to the boats of unwanted visitors: &quot;Police boats could go missing, develop an unexpected leak or spontaneously combust.&quot; The area still presents hazards to passing ships; in January 1993, the Danish coaster &quot;Bettina Danica&quot; ran aground off the southern end of Stroma. The wreck was broken apart by the action of the sea in 1997 and only her stern section is still visible.

Another way the islanders supported themselves was through the illicit brewing of spirits as a way of boosting their income – a common practice among the older people. An inspector who visited the island&#x27;s school in 1824 described the inhabitants of Stroma as &quot;all professed smugglers&quot;. The suppression of smuggling by the authorities led to a significant drop in the island&#x27;s population the first half of the 19th century. The census of 1841 noted: &quot;now smuggling being completely suppressed, several families have left the island and removed to the Orkneys to follow more lawful pursuits.&quot; While smuggling may have been tackled, illicit distilling continued for many years. One former inhabitant, Mrs. David Gunn, recalled in 1971 how her great-grandmother had managed to avoid the &quot;excisemen&quot; (customs officers) confiscating her illegally brewed alcohol:

Despite their physical isolation, the islanders maintained a lively community. A school had been established in 1723 by the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SSPCK), with sixty children on its initial attendance roll. The demands of island life conflicted to some extent with those of schooling. The SPCK&#x27;s inspector found only eighteen out of seventy pupils present when he visited in 1824. He found that many of the children were fully occupied helping their families in summer and only attended school in winter. Two places of worship were built within a couple of years of each other, a Baptist chapel in 1877 and a Church of Scotland church in 1878 (at a cost of £900). Although they soon became focal elements of community life, there seems to have been some bad blood between the two congregations, perhaps due to a clash between the missionary zeal of local Baptists and the Calvinism of the Presbyterian Kirk.
The inhabitants of Stroma were highly self-sufficient, and many practiced additional trades such as carpentry or roof-laying in addition to their &quot;day jobs&quot; in fishing or crofting. They built their own houses and boats, produced most of their own food, maintained farm equipment, shod their own horses, and made their own clothes, boots and shoes. In the 1920s they built their own wind turbines to recharge the batteries of their radio sets. By the end of the 19th century the island had three shops including a grocery. Any additional needs were met by purchasing supplies from shops at Wick and Thurso on the mainland or by mail-order from catalogues. For a while, they were also able to use the services of a floating shop which came periodically from Orkney to Stroma. Customers were rowed out to buy groceries, flour, animal feed, paraffin and clothes in exchange for lobsters, wet salted fish and eggs.

Most of the houses on Stroma are single-storey stone-built structures with two main rooms (a &quot;butt&quot; and a &quot;ben&quot;) plus a closet (a small bedroom) and a porch. The rooms were small and simply furnished, incorporating recessed box beds. These consisted of a series of wooden planks with a layer of straw on top, on which was placed a chaff-filled mattress. The butt was used as a living room and included an iron stove with an oven, and sometimes a water tank to enable hot water to be generated, while the ben was used for visitors and as a sitting-room.

One former islander, Jimmy Simpson, recalled that &quot;we had about two hundred and fifty folks here when I was a boy. It never seemed a lonely place. There were always people going in and out of each other&#x27;s houses, there were forty children at the school and there were two teachers. We had concerts; three concerts in the winter when you had to sing loud to get above the sound of the wind. The young people would meet at the shop in the long, long evenings in summer.&quot; The island had some distinctively eccentric characters: Donald Banks, the island&#x27;s coffin-maker, was known for quarrelling with his neighbours (telling one family, &quot;I&#x27;ll no bury any more o&#x27; ye!&quot;) and combining poetry with coffin-making, as in the order he placed with a mainland supplier:

Dear Mr. Sutherland,
Would you be so good,
To send eight planks of coffin wood.
Half inch lining, (dear Mr. Sutherland,)
For those who are pining ...

Describing life on Stroma, Simpson commented:

=== Decline and abandonment ===

Stroma&#x27;s population fell precipitously through the first half of the 20th century, leading eventually to the island&#x27;s final abandonment at the end of the 1950s. There was no single cause that precipitated the collapse of Stroma&#x27;s population. Living conditions on the island were always basic; there was no running water or electricity, and gas only arrived in the 1950s, which contrasted poorly with the improvements being made on the mainland. The fishing deteriorated after the First World War, and crofting became an increasingly difficult way to make a living. The island was relatively overpopulated; by 1901 the population was nearly twice that of sixty years previously, and there was little spare land left for farming. Families of six to eight children were common, but there was simply not enough work for all, so the eldest often left for the mainland or emigrated to Canada or the United States to find work. The lack of a proper harbour meant that the islanders could not make use of larger boats or develop a modern fishery. Young people started moving away to seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere, eventually followed by their parents.

Both of the World Wars had a major impact on Stroma, which was only from the Royal Navy&#x27;s chief base at Scapa Flow in Orkney. Six islanders died in each of the World Wars; the names of all twelve are inscribed on the island&#x27;s war memorial, and during the Second World War as much as a quarter of the population was on war service. Adding to the island&#x27;s economic problems, the introduction of the 11-plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave Stroma to complete their education at the secondary school in Wick. Because they could not commute between the island and Wick, they had to attend school as boarders, which incurred additional expenses for their parents.

Two other factors have often been cited in Stroma&#x27;s depopulation: the building of the nuclear power station at nearby Dounreay in the 1950s, which created many new jobs on the mainland, and in the same decade the construction of a harbour on Stroma on which many islanders were employed. Although it has been claimed that this gave the islanders the incentive (and the means) to leave, local historian Donald A. Young points out that of islanders who left after 1945, only one went directly from Stroma to Dounreay. Most of the rest either continued fishing or carried on crofting on the mainland, while others found alternative jobs. Some ex-islanders eventually found jobs at Dounreay, but they had already moved to the mainland for work or education.
The Sinclairs of Mey sold their portion of the island to Colonel F. B. Imbert-Terry in 1929, who sold it in turn to John Hoyland, an umbrella manufacturer from Yorkshire, in 1947. Hoyland also acquired the remaining island estate of the Sinclairs of Freswick, uniting Stroma for a reported cost of £4,000. His tenure coincided with the final collapse of the island&#x27;s population. As the tenants left, Hoyland put Stroma on the market but found no buyers. A Caithness councilman suggested various schemes for Stroma, including establishing a naturist resort and using it as a site for a crematorium, but the council rejected suggestions that it should take on responsibility for the island. As the population left, the local economy disintegrated; there were no longer enough able-bodied men to man the fishing boats, and the remaining facilities on the island were closed down for lack of custom. The last store on the island, the Scottish Cooperative Wholesale Society shop, closed in 1956. Only three families, numbering 16 people in total, were left by 1957; that year, the island&#x27;s school closed, by which time it only had two pupils. The Post Office closed in 1958 when the family which operated it left for the mainland.

In the summer of 1958, Hoyland prompted controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show &quot;Bid &#x27;n&#x27; Buy&quot; as a prize. After an outcry on both sides of the Atlantic, the show&#x27;s producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to Jimmy Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to be talking about it with a lawyer: &quot;I said, &#x27;I see Stroma was sold last week, and it&#x27;s not sold this week. Is it on the market?&#x27; &#x27;Yes,&#x27; he said, &#x27;Stroma&#x27;s for sale.&#x27; I said, &quot;What kind of money?&quot; So he told me what kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it.&quot; His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: &quot;Lena nearly flew at me for being so stupid. She says, &#x27;Stroma? What on earth are you going to do with an island?&#x27;&quot;. He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle. It is still used by the Simpson family for sheep grazing.

By this time, the five-member Manson family had become the last native inhabitants of Stroma, &quot;Now liv[ing] in a silent community of empty houses, an empty church and an empty school.&quot; Although the head of the family, Andrew Manson, called the island &quot;a paradise in summer&quot; and a place where he was &quot;free of outside distractions and watching my sons growing from boyhood to manhood – teaching them to live like men, to be dependent on no one,&quot; it was a bleak life for the women, who had applied for a council house at Scrabster, near Thurso. The Mansons finally left Stroma on 6 December 1962, bringing to an end thousands of years of permanent habitation on the island.

=== Island of ruins ===

Stroma is now entirely deserted by humans; its only permanent inhabitants are the seals, birds and sheep that live on the island. The church, school and old croft houses stand derelict, with many having fallen into ruin. The writer Bella Bathurst, visiting the island in the early 2010s, described the scene:

Inside some of the houses, Bathurst writes, everyday objects still remain where they were left decades ago; &quot;the bed and the limed matchboard ceiling are intact, untouched even by the damp. The kitchen table still stands in the parlour and a framed and fading photograph gazes out from the top of the mantelpiece.&quot; In another house seen 20 years earlier by Leslie Thomas, &quot;was a rank of family photographs, shades in Victorian dress staring out forever into a room now desolate and holed, but which had once held the life of a warm family.&quot;

Elsewhere, the books remain &quot;dusty but tidy&quot; in the abandoned school, and the church still contains its pulpit, &quot;dumb and hung with ragged red tassles&quot; with prayer books &quot;left to be trampled upon by heathen sheep and nibbled by rabbits and rats.&quot; In the former post office, forms and licence applications and a bottle of dried ink still stand on the counter, while in a back room stands &quot;a nice dresser, upon which [stands] a teapot and a jug and some sheet music: &#x27;Red Sails in the Sunset&#x27;, &#x27;The General&#x27;s Fast Asleep&#x27; and &#x27;You Can&#x27;t Do That There &#x27;Ere.&#x27; Nobody on Stroma will ever sing those songs now.&quot;

Bathurst and Thomas express contrasting views on the significance of Stroma&#x27;s abandonment. Thomas regards it as a tragedy: &quot;Of all the out-of-the-way places I have known, this was the saddest. It seemed as though its life had been ended in a fit of pique.&quot; To Bathurst, however, &quot;it is tempting to see Stroma&#x27;s abandonment as the result of some appalling trauma. Abandonment is always taken as a sign of failure, a collective death ... But Stroma does not feel sad. True, there is sorrow in seeing the once meticulous vegetable patches turned over to weeds, or wondering how many more winters the box beds will stand before they start to rot. But that isn&#x27;t the whole story. What is interesting about Stroma is not the fact of its abandonment, but the tale of its past.&quot;

The MeyGen tidal energy array is located on the ocean floor to the south of the island of Stroma. It has four 1.5 MW tidal turbines, which harness the power of the fast-flowing waters of the Inner Sound. They produced 25 GWh of electrical energy in 2019, enough to supply the electric needs of 4,000 homes. The project is being developed in a phased manner, with a potential capacity of 400 MW.

== Communications ==

Stroma lacked a regular connection to the mainland until 1879, when the Post Office subsidised a weekly boat service from Huna on the mainland and established a post office on the island. However, the volume of mail from Stroma proved so small that the service was grossly uneconomical. By the 1950s, the Post Office was spending 1s. 2d. for each letter worth 2½d. in postage.

For many years, the islanders had no means of contacting the mainland in emergencies other than signalling with hand lamps and hoping that someone would see them. A radio telephone was installed in 1935, and in 1953 a telephone cable was laid. A red telephone box was installed in the centre of the island, symbolic of the 6 millionth phone box installation in the UK. It is still there today, though no longer in use.

It was not until 1894 that Stroma gained its first artificial landing point, a pier built from Portland cement near Nethertown at a cost of £800. In 1955, Caithness County Council constructed a new harbour on the south coast of the island at the then great cost of £28,500. Although it was intended to help stem the exodus of people from the island, Stroma was abandoned only a few years after the harbour&#x27;s completion.

In the late 1930s Highland Airways looked into the possibility of including Stroma in the hospital ambulance plane service that was then in operation. On 19 August 1937, Captain E. E. Fresson of Highland Airways landed a small aircraft in farmland adjoining the Mains of Stroma, and the following spring the islanders cleared an area of moorland on the west side of the island to create an airstrip. The first official flight landed in June 1938. However, the Second World War prevented any further developments and a regular service was not established. After the war, Highland Airways was taken over by British European Airways, which abandoned any interest in serving the island.

Today, Stroma has no regular communications with the mainland. The island&#x27;s owner ran occasional boat trips there on weekends for visitors, including Prince Charles, who painted watercolours of the abandoned houses.

== Notable buildings ==

=== Lighthouse ===
In 1890, a lighthouse was built at Stroma&#x27;s northern tip, Langaton Point. It was only operational for six years before being replaced, and very little is now known about the structure. The unmanned lighthouse originally housed a Trotter-Lindberg lamp which burned petroleum spirit or lythene. The fuel supply was stored in cisterns near the lantern, which was regularly recharged at least fortnightly by the local fishermen or crofters. It was one of the first lighthouses in Scotland to use this type of &quot;scintillating&quot; light.

It was replaced in 1896, possibly on the same site, by a new lighthouse built to a design by David Stevenson as part of a major programme of construction works around northern Scotland. A fog warning system was installed the following year. Stevenson&#x27;s lighthouse consists of a circular white-painted stone tower standing high at an elevation of above Mean High Water with a number of buildings nearby to house generators and the lighthouse keepers. The light was converted to a paraffin lamp when the former lythene lamp was found to be unsuitable. An oil store was installed in the lighthouse tower, ending the need for a separate building to hold the fuel. The lighthouse was subjected to a machine-gun attack by a German aircraft on 22 February 1941. It caused little damage and no injuries, and the keepers were soon able to make repairs.

Until 1961 the lighthouse was administered as a shore station, and subsequently (after the resident population of Stroma had left) as a rock station. An electric lamp with a maximum power of 1.1 million cp was installed in 1972, utilising a sealed beam optic mounted on a gearless revolving pedestal. By this time the keepers and their families were the only people living on Stroma. A helicopter pad was installed to enable supplies and personnel to be flown in. In 1997 the station was converted to automatic operation, utilising a 250-watt metal halide lamp which rotates on a gearless pedestal. A lens system from Sule Skerry lighthouse was refitted in the Stroma lighthouse. The old air-driven fog horn was removed and replaced by an electric fog signal which is installed on the balcony of the lighthouse. The lighthouse station&#x27;s power, which was formerly obtained from generators, is now provided by batteries which are charged at regular intervals. The current light flashes white every 20 seconds and can be seen from a nominal range of .

=== Kennedy mausoleum and the mummies of Stroma ===
One curious side-effect of the constant spray of sea-water over Stroma – apart from making the drinking water brackish and giving the air a constant salt taste – was that it mummified the corpses of some of the island&#x27;s inhabitants. They were housed in a mausoleum in the south-east corner of Stroma, built by the Kennedy family in 1677. The building still stands, although it is now unroofed. It comprises a two-storey structure which incorporates a burial vault and a dovecote. The building was constructed from grey flagstones and pink sandstone quoins. It measures by externally and standing high. The lintel of the door bears the inscription &quot;I.K.&quot; (Ioannes [i.e. John] Kennedy) and the date 1677.

The mummies of Stroma were something of a tourist attraction in the 18th century. The Welsh naturalist and traveller Thomas Pennant described the mummies as &quot;entire and uncorrupted bodies of persons who had been dead sixty years. I was informed that they were very light, had a flexibility in their limbs and were of a dusky color.&quot; However, their popularity proved their undoing. In 1762 Bishop of Ross and Caithness Robert Forbes recorded in his journal that Murdoch Kennedy

By 1786 the mummies had been destroyed by cattle and careless visitors as, according to &quot;Walker&#x27;s Hibernian Magazine&quot;, &quot;curiosity to see the mummies had brought many idle people to Stroma, [and] that some, out of wantonness had shattered the door, and others the bodies; and the door not being repaired, sheep and cattle entered the vault, and trampled them to pieces.&quot; There is now no trace of the original burials in the vault.

<text>Oddworld is a video game series and fictional universe, created by developers Oddworld Inhabitants under the direction of Lorne Lanning. The series has been released on various platforms such as PlayStation, Xbox, PlayStation 3, Game Boy, Windows, and Wii U, among others.

Throughout games set in the &quot;Oddworld&quot; universe, the player&#x27;s character goes on a quest to defend Oddworld&#x27;s ecosystem from endangerment by industrial corporations.

==Oddworld planet==
Oddworld is the name of the planet on which all five Oddworld Inhabitants games are based, extant in another dimension. The planet was originally described as ten times the size of Earth; but Oddworld Inhabitants&#x27; president and creative developer Lorne Lanning has since explained that Oddworld&#x27;s surface area is ten times the size of Earth&#x27;s, given that Oddworld is predominantly a dry-land planet and Earth is predominantly water-covered. It has its own sun and thus its own orbit resulting in a unique clock and calendar.

At some point, the planet suffered huge natural turmoils that resulted in volcanic crusts forming a new layer upon the entire planet. When that crust collapsed, it created giant thousand-foot craters all over the planet. The planet has a total of three layers, each with its own climate, temperature and gravitational levels. The giant craters were then used by the various Oddworld species to house their cities, whose tips could be seen protruding above the crust surface when looking across the landscape.

Only one of Oddworld&#x27;s continents has been featured in the games—Mudos—and only a tiny fraction of Mudos has been seen in-game. The journeys of Abe through &quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot;, &quot;Abe&#x27;s Exoddus&quot; and &quot;Munch&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; take him through that small portion, composed of fields, jungles, deserts, caverns and swamps. Much of the planet is decimated by industrialist species for their own profit; this is represented by city-sized factories and mass transit systems.

==Oddworld species==
The protagonist species of the games in the Oddworld universe are the Mudokons (): an oviparous anthropoid with blue or green skin. In &quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot;, &quot;Abe&#x27;s Exoddus&quot; and &quot;Munch&#x27;s Oddysee&quot;, the Mudokons are peaceful, spiritual inhabitants of a mock-Paleolithic society. Oddworld creator Lorne Lanning has explained that the Mudokons were not always sympathetic protagonists, insofar as, though they represent a class of slaves exploited by the upper class, their ability to telepathically control other species contradicts that status. Their principal enemies are the Glukkons, a cephalopod-like anthropoid with only vestigial lower limbs (usually concealed by clothing), representing an industrial master class. Subordinate to the Glukkons are the Sligs, who appear as soldiers or body-servants. The Mudokons have two sacred or totemic species, both of which resemble arthropods, but are actually vertebrates: the towering Scrabs and the arachnid-like Paramites, whereof both are hunted by the Sligs on the Glukkons&#x27; behalf to make food or similar products. Mudokons, Scrabs, Paramites and Glukkons were designed by Steven Olds.

In &quot;Munch&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; several creatures were added to the game. The Vykkers are purple, hairless humanoids with four arms and four legs. Interns resemble Vykkers, but have only two sets of limbs. Big Bro Sligs are bigger and more powerful Sligs, with armored versions of them occasionally being seen. Fuzzles are small, furry, spheroidal predator-scavengers. Meeps resemble sheep, but with only one limb and one eye. Gabbits are an amphibian species whose single hind leg serves as both feet and flukes.

&quot;Stranger&#x27;s Wrath&quot; introduced new species such as the Clakkers, who are anthropomorphic, flightless birds; the Outlaws, bulbous, hairless, blue-green humanoids; the Steef, feline-featured, gracile-legged centaurs; the Grubbs, amphibian-like bipeds that are symbionts of the Steef; the Oktigi, amphibious, parasitic cephalopods related to the Glukkons; and the Gloktigi, large, cephalopod-like bipeds related to the Oktigi and Glukkons.

 introduced replacement creatures such as the Sleeches to replace the Fleeches from Exoddus and a big Slig known as the &#x27;Slig Mama&#x27; which a Slig operates inside a protective casing and fires missiles towards Abe and yells common Slig phrases like &quot;Halt!&quot; and &quot;Freeze!&quot;

In the Oddworld games, the GameSpeak feature allows the player to interact with the non-playable characters (NPCs). Examples of GameSpeak commands in the original game &quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; are &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Follow me&quot; and &quot;Wait.&quot; Rescuing Mudokons and opening certain doors are all achieved through GameSpeak. Enemies possessed by Abe can also use GameSpeak, and one can take control of Slig guards, use Glukkons to command subservient Sligs, or use Sligs to call their Slog pets to heel. GameSpeak also included burps and flatulence, for comical effect. The GameSpeak feature was modified in &quot;Stranger&#x27;s Wrath&quot;, with a single talk button that caused the Stranger to say something appropriate to the situation. This context-sensitive GameSpeak also worked for questioning the Clakker and Grubb townsfolk. This change made the talk button more comparable to a universal-action button.

==Games set on Oddworld==
The developers originally stated that the &quot;Oddworld&quot; series would be a pentalogy called the Oddworld Quintology, and that &quot;Abe&#x27;s Exoddus&quot; and &quot;Stranger&#x27;s Wrath&quot; were bonus titles not counting toward the total of five. The Oddworld Adventures games are handheld versions of &quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; and &quot;Exoddus&quot;. The Quintology was halted after the first two games, when the company decided to redirect its efforts toward film production. There were also a few titles that were hinted at in interviews and press releases, but they were never developed.

===&quot;Oddworld: Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot;===
At the beginning of this game, Abe is a happy, ignorant worker at RuptureFarms, a meat-packing plant, but he then discovers that the plant&#x27;s boss Molluck the Glukkon has decided to use the factory&#x27;s Mudokon slaves as a source of meat. At the end of the game&#x27;s introductory sequence, which is a retrospective voice-over by Abe, he runs for his life. The Mudokons&#x27; spiritual leader, the BigFace, reveals that the Paramites and Scrabs slaughtered and processed by the Glukkons were formerly sacred to the Mudokons, and orders Abe to relight holy flames extinguished by the Glukkons. Having done this, Abe is empowered by BigFace and infiltrates RuptureFarms, where he frees the remaining slaves and destroys the Glukkon board of executives, but is himself captured. Should the player save a certain number of Mudokons, their free compatriots rescue Abe, and he receives a hero&#x27;s welcome from the Mudokons he rescued. Should the player not save a sufficient number, Abe is executed by Molluck.

===&quot;Oddworld: Abe&#x27;s Exoddus&quot;===
&quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; was very popular, and the bonus game &quot;Oddworld: Abe&#x27;s Exoddus&quot; was released the following year. &quot;Abe&#x27;s Exoddus&quot; begins where &quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; ends. Abe&#x27;s abilities in this game were similar to his abilities in the first game, with an expanded ability to communicate with other characters in the world using GameSpeak. Here, Abe is informed by ghosts of his species that Necrum, a Mudokon burial ground, is being excavated by Glukkons, using blind Mudokons as slaves. Abe then departs, with his companions Alf, Ben, Phos, Han and Luke to find a cure to the sickness caused by the SoulStorm Brew, created from the excavated bones. Having cured his friends, he destroys the brewery. If the player is successful, Abe is again rescued by his friends; if not, he is captured by the brewery&#x27;s owner and electrocuted.

===&quot;Oddworld: Munch&#x27;s Oddysee&quot;===
Not long after of &quot;Abe&#x27;s Exoddus&quot;, Abe helps Munch (the last living remnant of an amphibious race called the Gabbits) to save the Gabbits&#x27; eggs from destruction, in exchange for Munch&#x27;s help in rescuing more captive Mudokons.

===&quot;Oddworld: Stranger&#x27;s Wrath&quot;===
&quot;Oddworld: Stranger&#x27;s Wrath&quot; is an action-adventure game published for the Xbox in 2005. The game&#x27;s main character is a bounty hunter named Stranger. The game utilizes both third- and first-person perspectives and is less puzzle-oriented than the previous three &quot;Oddworld&quot; games. The game has a Wild West setting. It was later ported to the PC and released through the digital distribution service Steam.

===&quot;Oddworld: New &#x27;n&#x27; Tasty!&quot;===

&quot;Oddworld: New &#x27;n&#x27; Tasty!&quot; is a full remake of &quot;Oddworld: Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; developed by Just Add Water and published by Oddworld Inhabitants. It was released in July 2014 for the PlayStation 4 with later releases for additional platforms such as Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, Wii U, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. The game also had a physical version released for a limited time for PS4 and the PS Vita in 2016 from Limited Run Games. In 2019, LRG also released a physical version for the PS3. In August 2020, New &#x27;n&#x27; Tasty was announced to be releasing on the Nintendo Switch in October 2020.

=== &quot;Oddworld: Soulstorm&quot; ===

&quot;Oddworld: Soulstorm&quot; is a direct sequel to &quot;Oddworld: New &#x27;n&#x27; Tasty!&quot; and a reimagining of the story from &quot;Oddworld: Abe&#x27;s Exoddus&quot;, rather than a direct remake. It was developed and published by Oddworld Inhabitants and released in April 2021 for Windows, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. An &#x27;Enhanced Edition&#x27; was later released in November 2021 alongside a port for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

===Released titles===
===Unreleased titles===

* Oddworld: The Hand of Odd. A real-time strategy game planned to be online. Although being halted when Citizen Siege was planned, it has since been revived as plans for its development have been announced. Said to be in production after &quot;Abe HD&quot;. It is said to be free-to-play with optional extras that may be purchased.
* SligStorm. It would have followed the story of an albino Slig who was born in a complex it must escape to avoid infanticide, and would have been included with &quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; and &quot;Abe&#x27;s Exoddus&quot; in a combined package. On 9 May 2011, an Oddworld Inhabitants representative released a list of FAQ answers in relation to future games, confirming &quot;Sligstorm&quot; will be worked on after &quot;Abe HD&quot; and &quot;The Hand of Odd&quot;. It is not clear where in the Oddworld continuity the game will fit.
* The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot. Originally intended to be the next game following &quot;Stranger&#x27;s Wrath&quot;. Announced in April 2005, &quot;Fangus Klot&quot; was cancelled by Oddworld Inhabitants founders Lorne Lanning and Sherry McKenna over deal disagreements with publisher Majesco Entertainment. In the 9 May 2011 FAQ, an Oddworld Inhabitants representative confirmed &quot;Fangus Klot&quot; is in future plans.
* Oddworld: Squeek&#x27;s Oddysee. Expected third game in the original pentalogy following the first two entries &quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; and &quot;Munch&#x27;s Oddysee&quot;. In the 9 May 2011 FAQ, an Oddworld Inhabitants representative confirmed &quot;Squeek&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; is on the cards after &quot;The Hand of Odd&quot;, &quot;Abe HD&quot;, &quot;The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot&quot; and &quot;Sligstorm&quot; are released.
* Oddworld: Munch&#x27;s Exoddus. Expected to be a bonus game based on &quot;Munch&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; outside of the original pentalogy, in the same way that &quot;Abe&#x27;s Exoddus&quot; was to &quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot;. It would have featured Munch traveling to a land named Ma&#x27;Spa to hatch the Gabbit eggs acquired from the original game. It is unknown whether or not the game was cancelled or halted.
* Oddworld: Slave Circus. In an AMA on Reddit, Lorne Lanning discussed a possible future &quot;gladiator&quot;-type Oddworld title, in which the player could purchase and battle slaves. &quot;I have been fixated on a game called &quot;oddworld Slave Circus&quot;. It is seriously whack. You start the game by buying a slave. Think Gladiators on Oddworld. Have done a tremendous amount of work on this and have never mentioned it. But it is in the coffer and there may be some light for it down the road. But has some other contingencies depending on it. Requires new level of social integration into console gaming. It&#x27;s insane. Hopefully not so insane it won&#x27;t come to life.&quot;
* Oddworld: Stranger&#x27;s Wrath 2. On 17 January 2013, on the Oddworld website, the Oddworld team asked which game fans would like to see after completion on &quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee New &#x27;n&#x27; Tasty&quot;. Among the options was &quot;Stranger&#x27;s Wrath 2&quot;.
*Stranger Arena. A competitive multi-player game using gameplay mechanics from &quot;Stranger&#x27;s Wrath&quot;.

===OddBoxx===
In 2009, the director of Oddworld, Lorne Lanning, announced that they planned to make an Oddworld digital download package for PC. This package contains &quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot;, &quot;Abe&#x27;s Exoddus&quot;, &quot;Munch&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; and &quot;Stranger&#x27;s Wrath&quot;. Oddworld Inhabitants unveiled their re-designed website on 4 November 2010, also declaring that the Oddboxx was still in development. On 6 December, they announced that the Oddboxx would be released for the 2010 holiday season. The European and U.S. prices were revealed on 14 December. On 17 December, Oddworld Inhabitants announced the Oddboxx&#x27;s release date as 20 December, with a 25% discount offer running until 9AM (PST) the following morning. On 20 December 2010, the Oddboxx was released on Steam. Achievements have been added to the two 3D games—&quot;Munch&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; received 30, and &quot;Stranger&#x27;s Wrath&quot; gained 20.

On 29 April 2011, JAW announced at GameCity Nights that the Oddboxx would be coming to the PlayStation Network (with other platforms to be announced). &quot;Stranger&#x27;s Wrath HD&quot; was released on PlayStation 3 on 27 December 2011, and &quot;Munch&#x27;s Oddysee HD&quot; in December 2012. Stranger&#x27;s Wrath has 37 Trophies and Munch&#x27;s Oddysee has 45 Trophies. Every Oddworld title is now available on the PSN, making the PS3 and Vita the only consoles to offer the entire Oddboxx other than the PC. These remakes are currently cancelled for Xbox 360.

==Characters==
Abe is the strongly developed central character of the &quot;Oddworld&quot; series. He can also use GameSpeak, a way of communicating with other characters in the game. Along with Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot, Abe was one of the unofficial mascots of the PlayStation. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; described Abe as &quot;a new platform hero&quot; and a &quot;brilliant character.&quot; Lorne Lanning, Oddworld&#x27;s creator, has stated that its &quot;characters are driven in a way that is fired by larger [moral] issues.&quot; The physical characteristics of the Glukkon species, principally its elongated head and gangly frame, were inspired by those of the villainous Teacher character from the film &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot; (1982).

Abe is the most strongly developed central character of the Oddworld series. He was inspired by the diamond miners of South Africa, who along with other indigenous peoples have suffered the ruthless harvesting of their land and people by industrial profiteers. He evolves and develops throughout the first game, &quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot;. He is initially a slave along with his fellow Mudokons, but escapes. The game&#x27;s narrative and its main character deal with ethical and moral issues. Lorne Lanning, &quot;Oddworld&quot;″s creator, has stated that its &quot;characters are driven in a way that is fired by larger issues.&quot; Abe was the first protagonist that Oddworld Inhabitants developed. Lanning stated that Abe was named after Abraham of the Old Testament, because of the similarities between Abe trying to discover himself and for what he believes was the difficulty in trying to determine the true source of Abraham&#x27;s discovery of monotheism.

Originally, the game&#x27;s developers envisioned Abe and a mule-like creature called &quot;Elum&quot; beginning the game together, living off the land and being thrust into an industrialized factory slave environment. The developers came to the conclusion that the story was stronger should Abe come from a factory existence and later reveal one of self-sustenance, and as such the concept was eventually changed. In this game, Abe tells his story in flashback, which helps the player identify with him as the protagonist. Abe&#x27;s abilities include chanting, which permits him to take over the mind of some of his enemies. He can also jump, climb, run, and sneak in shadows.

==Reception==
The &quot;Oddworld&quot; games have received more than 100 industry awards. &quot;Oddworld: Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; received more than 24 awards and three nominations from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences over 1997 and 1998. In 2010, &quot;Game Informer&quot; included it on the list of ten gaming franchises that should be revived, specifically counting for the return of Abe.

As of 18 March 2014, the digital releases of &quot;Abe&#x27;s Oddysee&quot; and &quot;Abe&#x27;s Exoddus&quot; have sold one million units. The digital releases of all games combined have sold two million units. The franchise as a whole has sold seven million copies.

==Other media==
&quot;Oddworld&quot; is featured in the first episode of &quot;Icons&quot;, a documentary series aired on &quot;G4&quot; that showcases significant milestones in video game history. In addition, various bumpers starring characters from &quot;&quot; were aired on the &quot;G4&quot; television network to announce commercial breaks.

&quot;Oddworld&quot; is referenced in the 2007 television series &quot;Code Monkeys&quot;. In the tenth episode of season one (&quot;Third Reich&#x27;s the Charm&quot;) Lorne Lanning appears as a fictionalized version of himself and pitches the idea of &quot;Oddworld&quot; to a fictional video game company, which results in him being tased and thrown out of a window.

Abe, Munch and Stranger appear in the &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; video game series as costumes for Sackboy.

<doc id="513035" wikidata="Q3007225" url="?curid=513035" title="Culture of Macau">
<text>Macau is an autonomous territory within China. A Portuguese colony until 1999, Macau has a diverse culture firmly rooted in Cantonese culture, with a mix of influences from East Asia and Western Europe. Macau is known for being the largest gambling center in the world.

==People and languages==
The two official languages of Macau are Chinese and Portuguese, although the latter is only spoken by a small minority. English is also widely spoken. , 80.1% of the population speak Cantonese as their daily language.

In 2018 Reuters stated &quot;there are signs that Chinese is being prioritized in government.&quot;

The Macanese language, generally known as &quot;Patuá&quot;, is a distinctive creole that is still spoken by several dozen members of the Macanese people, an ethnic group of mixed Asian and Portuguese ancestry that accounts for a small percentage of Macau&#x27;s population.

Signs in Macau are displayed in both Traditional Chinese and Portuguese. In contrast to mainland China, Macau—along with Hong Kong and Taiwan—generally does not use Simplified Chinese characters.

Among the main migrants of the country are skilled workers from the Philippines, hence Tagalog is one of the most-heard foreign languages.

===Cultural identity===
The worldwide popularity of Cantonese food and Chinese martial arts (&quot;kung fu&quot; or &quot;wu shu&quot;) has made them popular in Portugal as well.

In 1998, the first &quot;Festival da Lusofonia&quot; took place in Macau, a festival of Portuguese-speaking communities. In November 2013, the 16th edition of the festival took place over the duration of two and a half days with musical activities, kids programmes, traditional Portuguese games and food from Portuguese-speaking countries&#x27; cuisines.

===Mass media===

Most of the pop music that can be heard on the channel &quot;TDM Teledifusão de Macau&quot; (澳廣視) is imported from Hong Kong or overseas (mainly Japan). However, more and more local songs are being recorded by locals. Some Brazilian TV stations are also broadcast in Macau.

==Cuisine==

Macanese cuisine is a blend of southern Chinese (especially Cantonese cuisine) and Portuguese cuisines, with significant influences from Southeast Asia and the Lusophone world. The most famous snack is the Portuguese-style egg tart. It is widely popular in Southeast Asia, especially in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The most famous Macanese food is galinha à portuguesa, which is served in numerous varieties in Macau restaurants.

In 2018 Reuters stated that the cuisine was one of the few remaining Portuguese influences in Macau.

==Religion==

The primary religion is Buddhism. Roman Catholicism has considerable influence in education and social welfare in Macau. However, adherents only count for about six percent of the population. Protestantism is spreading quickly, especially among the younger demographic groups.

==Arts==
===Film===

A few independent films have been produced since the late 1990s. Recent Macau film productions include:
* 窗前熗後 by Vincent Hui (2000)
* &quot;Love Is Not A Sin&quot; () by Doug Chan (2003). Winner of Golden DV Award (27th HKIFF), Winner of The Best Original Screenplay Award (1st Downunder International Film Festival, Darwin).
* &quot;macau.xmas.2005&quot; () by Sio (2005).
* &quot;Macao 2525&quot; (2021). Nominated for best digital animation at the Film &amp; TV World Cup 2021 at the Lima Web Fest in Peru.

* &quot;The Edge Of Human&quot; by Johan Karlberg and Angela Lao (2022). First Macanese Cyberpunk movie, nominated for best experimental film at the Film &amp; TV World Cup 2022 Pinewood Studios Lift Off Sessions in London UK. Finished 4th place of 42 in the network round.

* &quot;Return To Earth - Macau Sci-fi (2023)&quot; by Johan Karlberg and Angela Lao. Finished Top 4 of 15 nominated finalists at BCT Cinema E Televisione festival in Italy (best feature film);. declared the best Asian feature film in the festival. 

===Music===
The Macau International Music Festival is conducted by the Cultural Affairs Bureau of the Macau SAR Government every autumn. The 20th anniversary of the MIMF was celebrated in 2007 with performances of Jazz, classical music, electronica, Chinese folk-pop, rock and Fado.

Other Lusophone music types popular in Macao are &quot;samba&quot;, &quot;bossa nova&quot;, and &quot;kizomba&quot;.

In 2005, the Hush!! Full Band Festival got established, a government-sponsored modern music festival featuring pop rock and hard rock bands from all over Asia with a focus on Macau bands. The festival is free of charge and it&#x27;s in its 9th edition in 2013.

===Literature===

The literature of Macanese (i.e. those with Portuguese descent) is a multi-dimensional art. Their literature appeared as early as the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, a group of well-known writers appeared:
* Anthology &quot;Lonely Road&quot;: TancareiraBela, Tancareira Pensativa and CancāoDe Tancareira by Leanel Alves.
* Anthology &quot;Blessed Garden, Macau&quot; by Jose dos Santos Ferreira.
* Short fiction &quot;The Gown&quot; by Deolinda de Conceição
* Long fiction: &quot;Love and small toes&quot; &amp; &quot;The Bewitching Braid&quot; written by Henrique de Senna Fernandes
* Anthology &quot;Four Seasons in One Day&quot; – Carlos Marreiros
* Other:
** &quot;Chinese Urheen&quot; by Camilo Pessanha (1867–1926)
** &quot;The Chart of Maritime Countries ()&quot;, &quot;Listens to the Dulcimer &amp; Song playing by a foreign lady in the Macau Garden ()&quot; written by Wei Yuan ( 1794–1857), displayed his personal feeling and understanding of classical music.

===Cantonese opera===

Cantonese opera is quite popular, especially among elderly residents. In 2003, the Cultural Institute of the Macau S.A.R Government, in collaboration with the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong SAR, organized the exhibition &quot;Fong Yim Fun – The Life and Work of a Cantonese Opera Artiste&quot;. As a well-known actress and opera artiste in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, Fong Yim Fun performed in more than 150 operas and films. Part of her works was exhibited in the Museum of Macau at that time.

===Facilities===

The Macao Cultural Centre was established in 1999, for the purpose of offering unique venues for artistic events, international conferences and exhibitions, enhancing cultural exchange, and helping to expand culture horizons among Macau residents. Hundreds of programs and events take place there almost every day—e.g., martial arts performances, European traditional music, Chinese traditional music, foreign music, varies types of dancing, etc.

The Macau Ricci Institute is a recent foundation of the Jesuits in Macau. Its aim is to continue the process of friendly encounters between Chinese and European cultures and traditions, which was begun by Matteo Ricci 1552–1610 many years ago.

<text>Hypercholesterolemia, also called high cholesterol, is the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood. It is a form of hyperlipidemia (high levels of lipids in the blood), hyperlipoproteinemia (high levels of lipoproteins in the blood), and dyslipidemia (any abnormalities of lipid and lipoprotein levels in the blood).
Elevated levels of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL in the blood may be a consequence of diet, obesity, inherited (genetic) diseases (such as LDL receptor mutations in familial hypercholesterolemia), or the presence of other diseases such as type 2 diabetes and an underactive thyroid.
Cholesterol is one of three major classes of lipids produced and used by all animal cells to form membranes. Plant cells manufacture phytosterols (similar to cholesterol) but in small quantities. Cholesterol is the precursor of the steroid hormones and bile acids. Since cholesterol is insoluble in water, it is transported in the blood plasma within protein particles (lipoproteins). Lipoproteins are classified by their density: very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL). All the lipoproteins carry cholesterol, but elevated levels of the lipoproteins other than HDL (termed non-HDL cholesterol), particularly LDL-cholesterol, are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. In contrast, higher HDL cholesterol levels are protective.
Avoiding trans fats and replacing saturated fats in adult diets with polyunsaturated fats are recommended dietary measures to reduce total blood cholesterol and LDL in adults. In people with very high cholesterol (e.g., familial hypercholesterolemia), diet is often not sufficient to achieve the desired lowering of LDL, and lipid-lowering medications are usually required. If necessary, other treatments such as LDL apheresis or even surgery (for particularly severe subtypes of familial hypercholesterolemia) are performed. About 34 million adults in the United States have high blood cholesterol.
==Signs and symptoms==

Although hypercholesterolemia itself is asymptomatic, longstanding elevation of serum cholesterol can lead to atherosclerosis (build-up of fatty plaques in the arteries, so-called &#x27;hardening of the arteries&#x27;). Over decades, elevated serum cholesterol contributes to the formation of atheromatous plaques in the arteries. This can lead to progressive narrowing of the involved arteries. Alternatively, smaller plaques may rupture and cause a clot to form and obstruct blood flow. A sudden blockage of a coronary artery may result in a heart attack. A blockage of an artery supplying the brain can cause a stroke. If the development of the stenosis or occlusion is gradual, the blood supply to the tissues and organs slowly diminishes until organ function becomes impaired. At this point tissue ischemia (restriction in blood supply) may manifest as specific symptoms. For example, temporary ischemia of the brain (commonly referred to as a transient ischemic attack) may manifest as temporary loss of vision, dizziness and impairment of balance, difficulty speaking, weakness or numbness or tingling, usually on one side of the body. Insufficient blood supply to the heart may cause chest pain, and ischemia of the eye may manifest as transient visual loss in one eye. Insufficient blood supply to the legs may manifest as calf pain when walking, while in the intestines it may present as abdominal pain after eating a meal.

Some types of hypercholesterolemia lead to specific physical findings. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (Type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia) may be associated with xanthelasma palpebrarum (yellowish patches underneath the skin around the eyelids), arcus senilis (white or gray discoloration of the peripheral cornea), and xanthomata (deposition of yellowish cholesterol-rich material) of the tendons, especially of the fingers. Type III hyperlipidemia may be associated with xanthomata of the palms, knees and elbows.

==Causes==

Hypercholesterolemia is typically due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Environmental factors include weight, diet, and stress. Loneliness is also a risk factor.

===Diet===
Diet affects blood cholesterol, but the size of this effect varies between individuals.

A diet high in sugar or saturated fats increases total cholesterol and LDL. Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of high-density lipoprotein while increasing levels of LDL.

A 2016 review found tentative evidence that dietary cholesterol is associated with higher blood cholesterol. As of 2018 there appears to be a modest positive, dose-related relationship between cholesterol intake and LDL cholesterol.

===Medical conditions and treatments===
A number of other conditions can also increase cholesterol levels including diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, alcohol use, monoclonal gammopathy, dialysis therapy, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, Cushing&#x27;s syndrome and anorexia nervosa. Several medications and classes of medications may interfere with lipid metabolism: thiazide diuretics, ciclosporin, glucocorticoids, beta blockers, retinoic acid, antipsychotics, certain anticonvulsants and medications for HIV as well as interferons.

===Genetics===
Genetic contributions typically arise from the combined effects of multiple genes, known as &quot;polygenic,&quot; although in certain cases, they may stem from a single gene defect, as seen in familial hypercholesterolemia. In familial hypercholesterolemia, mutations may be present in the APOB gene (autosomal dominant), the autosomal recessive &quot;LDLRAP1&quot; gene, autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (&quot;HCHOLA3&quot;) variant of the &quot;PCSK9&quot; gene, or the LDL receptor gene. Familial hypercholesterolemia affects about one in 250 individuals.

The Lithuanian Jewish population may exhibit a genetic founder effect. One variation, G197del LDLR which is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia, has been dated to the 14th century. The of these variations has been the subject of debate.

==Diagnosis==
Cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) of blood in the United States and some other countries. In the United Kingdom, most European countries, and Canada, millimoles per liter of blood (mmol/L) is the measure.

For healthy adults, the UK National Health Service recommends upper limits of total cholesterol of 5 mmol/L, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) of 3 mmol/L. For people at high risk of cardiovascular disease, the recommended limit for total cholesterol is 4 mmol/L, and 2 mmol/L for LDL.

In the United States, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute within the National Institutes of Health classifies total cholesterol of less than 200 mg/dL as &quot;desirable&quot;, 200 to 239 mg/dL as &quot;borderline high&quot;, and 240 mg/dL or more as &quot;high&quot;.

There is no absolute cutoff between normal and abnormal cholesterol levels, and values must be considered in relation to other health conditions and risk factors.

Higher levels of total cholesterol increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary heart disease. Levels of LDL or non-HDL cholesterol both predict future coronary heart disease; which is the better predictor is disputed. High levels of small dense LDL may be particularly adverse, although measurement of small dense LDL is not advocated for risk prediction. In the past, LDL and VLDL levels were rarely measured directly due to cost.

Levels of fasting triglycerides were taken as an indicator of VLDL levels (generally about 45% of fasting triglycerides is composed of VLDL), while LDL was usually estimated by the Friedewald formula:

LDL formula_1 total cholesterol – HDL – (0.2 x fasting triglycerides).

However, this equation is not valid on nonfasting blood samples or if fasting triglycerides are elevated (&gt;4.5 mmol/L or &gt;~400 mg/dL). Recent guidelines have, therefore, advocated the use of direct methods for the measurement of LDL wherever possible. It may be useful to measure all lipoprotein subfractions (VLDL, IDL, LDL, and HDL) when assessing hypercholesterolemia and measurement of apolipoproteins and lipoprotein (a) can also be of value. Genetic screening is now advised if a form of familial hypercholesterolemia is suspected.

===Classification===

Classically, hypercholesterolemia was categorized by lipoprotein electrophoresis and the Fredrickson classification. Newer methods, such as &quot;lipoprotein subclass analysis&quot;, have offered significant improvements in understanding the connection between atherosclerosis progression and clinical consequences. If the hypercholesterolemia is hereditary (familial hypercholesterolemia), more often a family history of premature, earlier onset atherosclerosis is found.

==Screening method==
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2008 strongly recommended routine screening for men 35 years and older and women 45 years and older for lipid disorders and the treatment of abnormal lipids in people at increased risk of coronary heart disease. They also recommend routinely screening men aged 20 to 35 years and women aged 20 to 45 years if they have other risk factors for coronary heart disease. In 2016 they concluded that testing the general population under the age of 40 without symptoms is of unclear benefit.

In Canada, screening is recommended for men 40 and older and women 50 and older. In those with normal cholesterol levels, screening is recommended once every five years. Once people are on a statin further testing provides little benefit except possibly to determine compliance with treatment.

In the UK, after someone is diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia, clinicians, family, or both, contact first- and second-degree relatives to come forward for testing and treatment. Research suggests that clinician-only contact results in more people coming forward for testing.

==Treatment==
Treatment recommendations have been based on four risk levels for heart disease. For each risk level, LDL cholesterol levels representing goals and thresholds for treatment and other action are made. The higher the risk category, the lower the cholesterol thresholds.
For those at high risk, a combination of lifestyle modification and statins has been shown to decrease mortality.

===Lifestyle===
Lifestyle changes recommended for those with high cholesterol include: smoking cessation, limiting alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight.

Overweight or obese individuals can lower blood cholesterol by losing weight – on average a kilogram of weight loss can reduce LDL cholesterol by 0.8 mg/dl.

===Diet===
Eating a diet with a high proportion of vegetables, fruit, dietary fiber, and low in fats results in a modest decrease in total cholesterol.
Eating dietary cholesterol causes a small rise in serum cholesterol, the magnitude of which can be predicted using the Keys and Hegsted equations. Dietary limits for cholesterol were proposed in the United States, but not in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. However, in 2015 the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee in the United States removed its recommendation of limiting cholesterol intake.
A 2020 Cochrane review found replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat resulted in a small decrease in cardiovascular disease by decreasing blood cholesterol. Other reviews have not found an effect from saturated fats on cardiovascular disease. Trans fats are recognized as a potential risk factor for cholesterol-related cardiovascular disease, and avoiding them in an adult diet is recommended.

The National Lipid Association recommends that people with familial hypercholesterolemia restrict intakes of total fat to 25–35% of energy intake, saturated fat to less than 7% of energy intake, and cholesterol to less than 200 mg per day. Changes in total fat intake in low-calorie diets do not appear to affect blood cholesterol.
Increasing soluble fiber consumption has been shown to reduce levels of LDL cholesterol, with each additional gram of soluble fiber reducing LDL by an average of 2.2 mg/dL (0.057 mmol/L). Increasing consumption of whole grains also reduces LDL cholesterol, with whole grain oats being particularly effective. Inclusion of 2 g per day of phytosterols and phytostanols and 10 to 20 g per day of soluble fiber decreases dietary cholesterol absorption. A diet high in fructose can raise LDL cholesterol levels in the blood.

===Medication===
Statins are the typically used medications, in addition to healthy lifestyle interventions. Statins can reduce total cholesterol by about 50% in the majority of people, and are effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in both people with and without pre-existing cardiovascular disease. In people without cardiovascular disease, statins have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease, and strokes. Greater benefit is observed with the use of high-intensity statin therapy. Statins may improve quality of life when used in people without existing cardiovascular disease (i.e. for primary prevention). Statins decrease cholesterol in children with hypercholesterolemia, but no studies as of 2010 show improved outcomes and diet is the mainstay of therapy in childhood.

Other agents that may be used include fibrates, nicotinic acid, and cholestyramine. These, however, are only recommended if statins are not tolerated or in pregnant women. Injectable antibodies against the protein PCSK9 (evolocumab, bococizumab, alirocumab) can reduce LDL cholesterol and have been shown to reduce mortality.

===Guidelines===

In the US, guidelines exist from the National Cholesterol Education Program (2004) and a joint body of professional societies led by the American Heart Association.

In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has made recommendations for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels, published in 2008, and a new guideline appeared in 2014 that covers the prevention of cardiovascular disease in general.

The Task Force for the Management of Dyslipidaemias of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Atherosclerosis Society published guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias in 2011.

===Specific populations===
Among people whose life expectancy is relatively short, hypercholesterolemia is not a risk factor for death by any cause including coronary heart disease. Among people older than 70, hypercholesterolemia is not a risk factor for being hospitalized with myocardial infarction or angina. There are also increased risks in people older than 85 in the use of statin drugs. Because of this, medications that lower lipid levels should not be routinely used among people with limited life expectancy.

The American College of Physicians recommends the following for hypercholesterolemia in people with diabetes:
# Lipid-lowering therapy should be used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity for all adults with known coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes.
# Statins should be used for primary prevention against macrovascular (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease) complications in adults with type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors.
# Once lipid-lowering therapy is initiated, people with type 2 diabetes mellitus should be taking at least moderate doses of a statin.
# For those people with type 2 diabetes who are taking statins, routine monitoring of liver function tests or muscle enzymes is not recommended except in specific circumstances.

===Alternative medicine===
A 2002 survey found that 1.1% of U.S. adults who used alternative medicine did so to treat high cholesterol.
Consistent with previous surveys, this one found the majority of individuals (55%) used it in conjunction with conventional medicine. A systematic review of the effectiveness of herbal medicines used in traditional Chinese medicine had inconclusive results due to the poor methodological quality of the included studies.
A review of trials of phytosterols and/or phytostanols, average dose 2.15 g/day, reported an average of 9% lowering of LDL-cholesterol. In 2000, the Food and Drug Administration approved the labeling of foods containing specified amounts of phytosterol esters or phytostanol esters as cholesterol-lowering; in 2003, an FDA Interim Health Claim Rule extended that label claim to foods or dietary supplements delivering more than 0.8 g/day of phytosterols or phytostanols. Some researchers, however, are concerned about diet supplementation with plant sterol esters and draw attention to the lack of long-term safety data.

==Epidemiology==
Rates of high total cholesterol in the United States in 2010 are just over 13%, down from 17% in 2000.

Average total cholesterol in the United Kingdom is 5.9 mmol/L, while in rural China and Japan, average total cholesterol is 4 mmol/L. Rates of coronary artery disease are high in Great Britain, but low in rural China and Japan.

==Research directions==
Gene therapy is being studied as a potential treatment.

<text>Kam Ning () is a violinist and daughter of the violinist-composer Kam Kee Yong (甘琦勇), and grandchild of Kam Beng Soo and Ooi Kooi Aun. Born in Singapore in 1975, she was given violin lessons at the age of six by the elder Kam, and had her early education at the Methodist Girls&#x27; School.

==Life==
In 1987, she received scholarships from the Lee Foundation and Shaw Foundation to study in the Yehudi Menuhin School, where she attended lessons and masterclasses conducted by Lord Menuhin himself and collaborated with him in chamber and orchestral performances at the age of 11. In her second year at the school, she played at the Royal Festival Hall with the Wren Orchestra of London, and her debut performance to a packed Victoria Concert Hall in Singapore. In 1993, Kam furthered her music education at the Curtis Institute of Music to study with Jaime Laredo and Yumi Scott and received her bachelor&#x27;s degree there. She graduated from the Cleveland Institute of Music with a Masters of Music Degree and an Artist Diploma in 2001, under the tutelage of Donald Weilerstein.

The young Kam appeared in an episode of the popular British television programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; when she was twelve, playing Paganini&#x27;s Caprice No.5 in a segment featuring students from the Yehudi Menuhin School. In 1990, Kam received the &quot;Outstanding Young Artist of the Competition&quot; prize in the Royal Over-Seas League Music Competition in Britain and in 1991, she won first prize in the Junior Section of the Folkestone Menuhin International Violin Competition, in Britain. She was awarded the&quot;Young Artist Award&quot; by the National Arts Council in 2000. In 2001, her performance took the second place &quot;Prix du Gouvernement Fédérale Belge Eugéne Ysaye&quot; in the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Belgium in 2001.

Kam Ning has since performed with many world-class orchestras like the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the National Orchestra of Belgium, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, the City of London Sinfonia and the Luxembourg Philharmonic, Malaysian Philharmonic, Helsinki Philharmonic, and Toronto Symphony, just to name a few. In her performance with the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana under Menuhin in Switzerland in 1991, she was praised by critics as a &quot;brilliant young violinist from Singapore&quot; for her outstanding performance of Mendelssohn&#x27;s E-minor Violin Concerto. As an artist who is keen on venturing off the beaten path, she has collaborated with her brother, percussionist Francis Kam, on concert tours in Taiwan, featuring contemporary music including works by their father, Kam Kee Yong.

Kam Ning counts her father Kam Kee Yong, and mentor Yehudi Menuhin as her most important sources of influence. To her, Menuhin remains &quot;the most imaginative man she has ever met&quot; for his repertoire in violin-playing. Her father&#x27;s strict teaching instilled a sense of discipline in her, as he set high expectations from her.

<doc id="513043" wikidata="Q1502193" url="?curid=513043" title="The Brier">
<text>The Brier (&#x27;), known since 2024 as theMontana&#x27;s Brier for sponsorship reasons, is the annual Canadian men&#x27;s curling championship, sanctioned by Curling Canada. The Brier has been held since 1927, traditionally during the month of March. 

The winner of the Brier goes on to represent Canada at the World Curling Championships of the same year. The Brier is the best supported curling competition in terms of paid attendance, attracting crowds far larger than even those for World Championships held in Canada.

Its current main sponsor is Montana&#x27;s, a Canadian restaurant chain. &quot;Brier&quot; originally referred to a brand of tobacco sold by the event&#x27;s first sponsor, the Macdonald Tobacco Company.

==History==
In 1924, George J. Cameron, the president of the W. L. Mackenzie and Company subsidiary of the Macdonald Tobacco Company, pitched the idea of a national curling championship to Macdonald Tobacco and was accepted. At the time Canadian curling was divided between the use of granite and iron curling stones, with the latter being used in Quebec and Eastern Ontario and the former being used everywhere else. The granite camp held the advantage, as Macdonald Tobacco&#x27;s T. Howard Stewart, brother of company president Walter Stewart, supported the use of granites, and was able to influence the decision to use granite stones for the new national championship.

Macdonald Tobacco further developed the concept, in 1925 and 1926, by sponsoring the winners of the &quot;Macdonald Brier Trophy&quot; at the MCA Bonspiel to travel to Eastern Canada. In 1925, the Manitoba team played a number of exhibition games against local teams, while the 1926 team played in the Quebec Bonspiel. The visits were deemed popular enough for Macdonald Tobacco to move forward with sponsorship of a full national championship in 1927.

The first Brier was held at the Granite Club in Toronto in 1927. Eight teams from across the country participated, representing Western Canada, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Northern Ontario, Toronto and Montreal. Games lasted 14 ends, and each team played each other in a 7-game round robin with no playoffs unless there was a tie for first. The first Brier champion was Nova Scotia, a rink skipped by Murray Macneill, with teammates Al MacInnes, Cliff Torey and Jim Donahue – who were normally skips in their own right, but were added to the Macneill rink because the rest of his normal team could not make the trip.

By 1928, games were shortened to 12 ends in length and the single Western Canada team was replaced by individual teams from Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, increasing the total number of teams to 10 – seven provinces, two cities and the region of Northern Ontario. In the 1932 Brier, the cities of Montreal and Toronto were dropped from competition, but Northern Ontario kept its entry, and still remains the only non provincial or territorial entry to this day. In 1936, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia were given entries. The Dominion of Newfoundland did not become part of Canada until after the 1949 Brier, so the team representing the new province of Newfoundland (later Newfoundland and Labrador) did not join the Brier until 1951. In 1975, a single combined team representing the federal territories of Yukon and Northwest Territories joined the Brier competition. In 1977, games were shortened to 10 ends, which is the current length for matches. Games had to be played in their entirety until the 1974 Brier, when the rules were changed to the present standard of allowing a team to concede defeat before the end of the match if they wished.

The Brier would continue to be played at the Granite Club in Toronto through to the 1940 competition. After then, the event would travel around the country, and would be played in all 10 provinces. Also at this point, rocks were coloured differently for each team and were matched to be of equal size. Play was discontinued between 1943 and 1945 due to World War II. After World War II, the event became more of a popular sporting spectacle across the country thanks to Macdonald Tobacco enlisting media outlets to cover the event. In 1946, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) began covering the event live across the country on the radio. By the 1960s, the CBC began showing curling on television, at first giving daily half-hour reports. In 1962, the CBC showed the tie-breaking playoff match up. In 1973, CBC began regularly showing live coverage of the final draw of the event. Today, TSN covers the entire tournament. CBC had covered the semi-finals and the finals up until the 2007–08 season. In 2013, Sportsnet and City began to offer coverage of the finals of the provincial playdowns in Manitoba, Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia as well.

In 1977, Macdonald Tobacco announced it would no longer be sponsoring the Brier, and the 1979 event would be the last one titled the Macdonald Brier. A committee headed by the Canadian Curling Association (today&#x27;s Curling Canada) was put in charge to find a new sponsor, which would end up being the Labatt Brewing Company. The event retained the &quot;Brier&quot; name, despite the word being the property of Macdonald Tobacco. However, with the Labatt sponsorship came some changes to the event, such as adding a new championship trophy and adding a TV-friendly playoff round after the round robin games. Labatt remained the title sponsor until 2001 when Nokia took over. That sponsorship only lasted four years before Tim Hortons took over, until 2024. When the Labatt sponsorship ended, the original Brier trophy was brought back and the names of the winners during the Labatt era were engraved on it.

Beginning in the 1990s, curling became more profitable, and the event would mostly be held in larger curling friendly markets (such as Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg and Saskatoon). At the same time, the World Curling Tour made the sport more lucrative, and curlers demanded cash prizes at the Brier, and the ability to display their sponsors on their jerseys. The Canadian Curling Association ignored their demands, and when the Grand Slam curling series was instituted in 2001, many of the top teams in the country boycotted the Brier in favour of playing in the Slams. Curlers&#x27; demands were eventually met and the boycott ended in 2003. The dominant Brier team of the era, the &quot;Ferbey four&quot; did not boycott the Brier, and won four of five Briers during the era, while other top teams such as Kevin Martin&#x27;s boycotted the event.

===Sponsors===
For the first fifty years, the Brier was sponsored by Macdonald Tobacco (later RJR Tobacco Company and now part of JTI-Macdonald Corporation). The name &quot;Brier&quot;, in fact, came from a brand of tobacco being manufactured by Macdonald at the time (a brier being a small shrub whose roots are commonly used to make tobacco pipes). Macdonald was also responsible for introducing both the Brier Tankard trophy (originally named the British Consols Trophy after a brand of cigarettes), and the now famous heart-shaped patches awarded to the tournament winners. The patches were modeled after a small tin heart pressed into the centre of Macdonald tobacco plugs, along with the slogan “The Heart of the Tobacco.” The same heart appeared on tins of Macdonald pipe tobacco. Later, when other national championships were developed, many took the heart as their identifying symbol as well.

==Qualification and eligibility==

The Brier is currently contested by 18 teams. Most provinces and territories are represented by one team, with the exception of Ontario, which sends two teams (named &quot;Ontario&quot; and &quot;Northern Ontario&quot;). Through 2014 the territories sent one team, but starting in 2015 all three territories were permitted to compete individually. Teams qualify for the Brier through their respective provincial championships, which are held every year and are open to any Canadian men&#x27;s curling team consisting of Canadian citizens. The formats for these championships vary from province to province, but most entail a series of club, municipal, district and/or regional playdowns prior to the provincial championship. Playdown formats vary, with each member association choosing a format suited to its geography and demographics. Originally, nearly all teams regardless of ability or past performance had to qualify for each Brier, starting at the club level when more than one team from a club seeks to enter the playdowns. Today, member associations typically grant past champions and other strong teams automatic entry to the latter stage(s) of the playdowns.

Until 2013, the champions of the Brier did not automatically qualify for the following year&#x27;s Brier, and had to qualify again. However, beginning in 2014, following the precedent set by its women&#x27;s counterpart, the Scotties Tournament of Hearts, champions now earn a bye representing Canada during the following year&#x27;s Brier.

For the three tournaments from 2015 to 2017, fifteen teams (ten provinces, three territories, Northern Ontario, and Team Canada) competed for twelve places in the Brier proper. The four lowest-ranked regions played a pre-qualifying tournament to open the Brier, with the winner advancing to the full round-robin. In this format&#x27;s first year Nunavut declined to send a team, and the round was between the winners of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and the Yukon.

Beginning with the 2018 Brier, the event expanded to a sixteen team field, with the ten provinces, three territories, Northern Ontario, and Team Canada being joined by the highest-ranked non-qualified team on the Canadian Team Ranking System standings. The teams are separated into two pools of eight, each playing a round-robin, with the top four teams in each pool advancing to a second pool to determine the final four teams.

==Top 3 finishes table==
&quot;As of the 2024 Brier Final&quot;

Prior to the 2011 Brier, there were no bronze medal games, so the third-place finishes listed in the table are for the teams that finished third in the tournament. Following the introduction of bronze medal games, which were played between the loser of the 3 versus 4 page playoff game and the loser of the semifinal game, the third-place finishes listed are for the teams that won the bronze medal games in each Brier. The bronze medal games were discontinued with the 2018 Brier.

<text>A quintet is a group containing five members. It is commonly associated with musical groups, such as a string quintet, or a group of five singers, but can be applied to any situation where five similar or related objects are considered a single unit.

==Overview==
In classical instrumental music, any additional instrument (such as a piano, clarinet, oboe, etc.) joined to the usual string quartet (two violins, a viola, and a cello), gives the resulting ensemble its name, such as &quot;piano quintet&quot;, &quot;clarinet quintet&quot;, etc. A piece of music written for such a group is similarly named.

The standard wind quintet consists of one player each on flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and horn, while the standard brass quintet has two trumpets, horn, trombone, and tuba. Other combinations are sometimes found, however.

In jazz music, a quintet is group of five players, usually consisting of two of any of the following instruments, guitar, trumpet, saxophone, clarinet, flute or trombone, in addition to those of the traditional jazz trio – piano, double bass, drums. 

In some modern bands there are quintets formed from the same family of instruments with various voices, as an all-brass ensemble, or all saxophones, in soprano, alto, baritone, and bass, and sometimes contrabass.

<text>Dyslipidemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by abnormally high or low amounts of any or all lipids (e.g. fats, triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids) or lipoproteins in the blood. Dyslipidemia is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, which include coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease. Although dyslipidemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, abnormal levels do not mean that lipid lowering agents need to be started. Other factors, such as comorbid conditions and lifestyle in addition to dyslipidemia, is considered in a cardiovascular risk assessment. In developed countries, most dyslipidemias are hyperlipidemias; that is, an elevation of lipids in the blood. This is often due to diet and lifestyle. Prolonged elevation of insulin resistance can also lead to dyslipidemia.

==Types==

== Risk factors ==
Risk factors include:
* Family history of dyslipidemia
* Current cigarette smoking
* Diabetes mellitus
* Hypertension
* Obesity (BMI&gt;30 kg/m2)
* Atherosclerosis
* Family history of premature coronary artery disease
* HIV infection
* COVID-19
* Erectile dysfunction
* Chronic kidney disease (eGFR &lt; 60ml/min/1.73 m2)
* Abdominal aneurysm
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
* Clinical manifestations of hyperlipidemias (xanthelasmas, xanthomas, premature arcus cornealis)
* Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
* Inflammatory bowel disease
==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
Physicians and basic researchers classify dyslipidemias in two distinct ways. One way is its presentation in the body (including the specific type of lipid that is increased). The other way is due to the underlying cause for the condition (genetic, or secondary to another condition). This classification can be problematic, because most conditions involve the intersection of genetics and lifestyle issues. However, there are a few well-defined genetic conditions that are usually easy to identify.

The three main blood levels collected to assess for dyslipidemia are triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). High triglyceride levels (&gt;1.7 mmol/L fasting) can indicate dyslipidemia. Triglycerides are transported through the blood by using very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) as a carrier. One thing to note when measuring triglyceride levels is that fasting for 8–12 hours is required to get an accurate result as non-fasting TG results may be falsely elevated. If TG results are greater than 10 mmol/L, then this needs to be addressed since severe hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Another blood level collected to assess dyslipidemia is HDL-C. HDL cholesterol is made up of very little lipids and a high amount of protein. It is beneficial in the body because it functions by going to the tissues and picking up extra cholesterol and fat. Due to the positive effects of HDL-C, it is named &quot;good cholesterol&quot; since it helps prevent plaque formation. Other functions of HDL-C is promoting cardiovascular health such as antioxidation effects, protection against thrombosis, maintenance of endothelial function, and maintaining low blood viscosity. Due to the positive functions of HDL cholesterol, a low level indicates dyslipidemia and is a risk factor for complications. Another diagnostic test that is often reviewed is LDL cholesterol. Low density lipoproteins are made up of cholesterol, TG, phospholipids, and apolipoproteins. LDL-C molecules bind to the endothelium of blood vessels and cause plaque formation. Once plaques are formed, LDL-C floating in the bloodstream can attach to the plaques and cause further accumulation. In addition to plaque formation, LDL-C molecules can undergo oxidation. Oxidation can cause further accumulation of cholesterol and the release of inflammatory cytokines, which damages the blood vessels. Due to the damaging effects of LDL-C, high levels increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and indicate dyslipidemia.

Dyslipidemias can also be classified based on the underlying cause, whether it is primary, secondary, or a combination of both. Primary dyslipidemias are caused by genetic disorders that can cause abnormal lipid levels without any other obvious risk factors. Those with primary dyslipidemias are at higher risk of getting complications of dyslipidemias, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, at a younger age. Some common genetic disorders associated with primary dyslipidemias are homozygous or heterozygous hypercholesterolemia, familial hypertriglyceridemia, combined hyperlipidemia, and HDL-C metabolism disorders. In familial hypercholesterolemia, a mutation in the &quot;LDLR&quot;, &quot;PCSK9&quot;, or &quot;APOB&quot; is usually the reason for this and these mutations result in high LDL cholesterol. In combined hyperlipidemia, there is an overproduction of apoB-100 in the liver. This causes high amounts of LDL and VLDL molecules to form. A unique sign of primary dyslipidemias is that patients will often present with acute pancreatitis or xanthomas on the skin, eyelids or around the cornea. In contrast to primary dyslipidemias, secondary dyslipidemias are based on modifiable environmental or lifestyle factors. Some diseases that are associated with a higher risk of dyslipidemia are uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, cholestatic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. What people eat can also have an influence, with excessive alcohol use, too much carbohydrates, and diets high in saturated fats having a higher risk. Some medications that may contribute to dyslipidemia are thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, oral contraceptives, atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine), corticosteroids, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine. Other non-hereditary factors that increase the risk of dyslipidemias are smoking, pregnancy, and obesity.

The Fredrickson Classification seen below classifies dyslipidemias into categories:

==Screening==
There is no clear consensus of when screening for dyslipidemia should be initiated. In general, those with a high risk of cardiovascular disease should be screened at a younger age with males between 25 and 30 years old and females between 30 and 35 years of age. Testing the general population under the age of 40 without symptoms is of unclear benefit. UpToDate suggests screening males at age 35 and females at age 45 in those without any risk of cardiovascular disease. All individuals regardless of age, should be screened if they have the risk factors listed below. Cardiovascular risk can be determined using risk scores, such as the Framingham Risk Score, and should be reassessed every 5 years for patients who are 40 to 75 years of age.

== Management ==
=== Non-pharmacological ===
Non-pharmacological treatment is recommended in all people with dyslipidemia.

An important non-pharmacological intervention in dyslipidemia is a diet aimed at reducing blood lipid levels and also weight loss if needed. These dietary changes should always be a part of treatment and the involvement of a dietician is recommended in the initial evaluation and also in follow-up as well. A 3-month trial of dietary changes is recommended in primary prevention before considering medication, but in secondary prevention and in individuals at high-risk, cholesterol-lowering medication is used in conjunction with diet modifications.

Recommended diets include the DASH diet, Mediterranean diet, low glycemic index diet, Portfolio diet, and vegetarian diet. Patients should reduce their intake of saturated fats, dietary cholesterol, and alcohol, and increase their intake of total fibre (≥30g/day), viscous soluble fibre (≥10g/day), and omega-3 (EPA and DHA [2-4g/d] used to lower TG only). They should also increase the proportion of mono-and polyunsaturated fats that they intake.

Other lifestyle modifications include weight loss (5–10% of body weight loss) and reduction of abdominal obesity, 30–60 minutes per day of moderate-vigorous exercise, smoking cessation, stress management, and getting 6–8 hours of sleep at night.

=== Pharmacological ===
Pharmacological intervention can be considered in dyslipidemia.

Based on the Framingham Risk Scores, there are different thresholds that indicate whether treatment should be initiated. Individuals with a score of 20% are considered to have a high cardiovascular risk, a score of 10–19% indicates an intermediate risk, and patients with a score less than 10% are at low risk. Statin therapy and non-pharmacological interventions are indicated in those with high cardiovascular risk. In those at intermediate risk or low risk, the use of statin therapy depends on individual patient factors such as age, cholesterol levels, and risk factors.

Statins are considered the first-line agents but other drugs can be substituted if the lipid targets are not achieved with statin therapy or if they are not tolerated.

==== HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) ====
Statins competitively inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase which is used in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and they include atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and pitavastatin. These agents work to lower LDL-C levels and are also associated with a decrease in CVD mortality, CVD morbidity, and total deaths. They have a small effect on HDL-C levels as well.

==== Resins ====
Resins are bile acid sequesterants that work by preventing the intestinal re-uptake of bile acids, thus increasing their fecal loss and accelerating the liver&#x27;s utilization of cholesterol to replace lost bile acids. Resins include cholestyramine, colestipol, and colesevalem, and they all decrease LDL-C while increasing HDL-C levels slightly. The Lipid Research Council—Cardiovascular Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT) also showed that when these agents were used alone, they improved cardiovascular outcomes.

==== Fibrates ====
The cholesterol lowering effect of fibrates is due to their ability to activate a nuclear receptor called peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha. They include fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and bezafibrate and work to decrease triglycerides, increase HDL-C, and also decrease LDL-C which is variable depending on which drug is used. The FIELD Study showed that fenofibrate reduced both coronary revascularization as well as nonfatal myocardial infarctions (but not in patients with type 2 diabetes).

==== PCSK9 inhibitors ====
PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies that target an important protein in the degradation of LDL called proprotein convertase substilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). These agents reduce LDL-C, increase HDL-C, decrease triglycerides, and decrease lipoprotein(a). The FOURNIER and ODYSSEY trials showed that these agents also reduced the risk of cardiovascular events.

==== Cholesterol absorption inhibitors ====
Ezetimibe inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and can be used alone or with statins. Regarding cardiovascular events, patients with chronic kidney disease saw a reduction in vascular and major atherosclerotic events when on simvastatin and ezetimibe compared to placebo. This same combination was also shown to reduce death, major coronary events, and nonfatal stroke in patients after acute coronary syndromes.

==== Icosapent ethyl ====
Icosapent ethyl consists of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 fatty acid from fish oil and works to lower the hepatic production of triglycerides. In the REDUCE-IT trial, patients on statin therapy and 4g daily of icosapent ethyl saw a reduction in major cardiovascular events.

==== Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors ====
Lomitapide works to inhibit the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) which results in a reduction of LDL plasma levels.

==== ATP citrate lyase inhibitors ====
Bempedoic acid acts on the cholesterol synthesis pathway upstream of statins at ATP citrate lyase. This enzyme synthesizes acetyl-CoA using citrate from the mitochondria.

==== Cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors ====
Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors include the agents torcetrapib, anacetrapib and obicetrapib. They block transfer of cholesterol from &quot;good&quot; HDL particles to &quot;bad&quot; LDL particles thereby causing an increase in the HDL:LDL ratio. Despite eliciting favorable changes in blood lipids, most CETP inhibitors (with the exception of anacetrapib) do not achieve significant reductions in cardiovascular events.

<doc id="513057" wikidata="Q606248" url="?curid=513057" title="Marcel Iureș">
<text>Marcel Iureș (; born 2 August 1951) is a Romanian actor. He is one of Romania&#x27;s most acclaimed stage and film actors. He has acted in films and on stage both in Romania and internationally, and has played at least ten roles on Romanian and British television. His work includes voiceovers for Disney and computer games. Iureș is the president and a judge of the Anonimul International Film Festival and also the president of Ideo Ideis Festival (an annual national theatre festival for teenagers).

==Early life==
Iureș was born on 2 August 1951 in Băilești, Dolj County. He entered the Theatrical Arts and Cinematography Institute in Bucharest in 1974 and graduated in 1978.

==Theatrical career==
He made his stage debut at the Bulandra Theatre, in Bucharest, in the 1975 production of &quot;Ferma&quot;, playing George. From 1978 to 1981 he acted at the National Theatre, Cluj, in numerous roles such as Beckman in the play &quot;Afară în fața ușii&quot; and The Coryphaeus in &quot;The Persians&quot; by Aeschylus During the early 1980s, Iureș appeared at both the Bulandra and Odeon Theatres in Bucharest. Among his roles were the title roles in Shakespeare&#x27;s were &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Henry IV&quot;, and &quot;Richard III&quot;, but also &quot;Richard II&quot;.

He is the president of Teatrul ACT (the first independent theatre in Romania) of which he was one of the founders in 1995. Iureș has starred there in various roles, including the title roles of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot; (directed by Mihai Măniuțiu), and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (directed by Liviu Ciulei). He has also appeared in Fundația Teatrul ACT-staged shows such as &quot;Creatorul de Teatru&quot; (&quot;The Creator of the Theatre&quot;, directed by Alexandru Dabija), &quot;Cetatea Soarelui&quot; (&quot;Citadel of the Sun&quot;, directed by Mihai Măniuţiu), and Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot;. Iureș also continues to perform with the Bulandra Theatre, for whom he played the lead in a 2005 production of Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot;.

He received many accolades and nominations (in both Romania and abroad) throughout his career. In 2000, he was awarded by Romanian President Emil Constantinescu the National Order of Faithful Service, Officer class.

==Film roles==
Iureș made his film debut portraying Franz Liszt in the 1978 Romanian film &quot;&quot; (&quot;January Dream&quot;). From the early 1980s and into the 1990s, he continued to build a screen career, appearing in many minor and major roles in Romania.

Iureș&#x27;s international film career sprang from the UK tour in 1994 of Mihai Măniuțiu&#x27;s production of &quot;Richard III&quot;, where he played the eponymous hero. The role of Alexander Golitsyn in the 1996 film &quot;&quot; was quickly followed by playing Dušan Gavrić in the 1997 film &quot;The Peacemaker&quot;, starring George Clooney and Nicole Kidman. Other film appearances include roles in &quot;Hart&#x27;s War&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;L4yer Cake&quot;, &quot;Goal!&quot;, &quot;Faimosul Paparazzo&quot;, &quot;Isolation&quot;, &quot;Vacanța Cea Mare&quot;, and &quot;Logodnicii Din America&quot;.

==Other work==
In 2007, Iureș volunteered his help in the Verde 003 project, which aims to build a better environment for all Romanians by planting vegetation.

<text>The Uele, also known by the phonetically identical Uélé, Ouélé, or Welle River, is a river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 

==Course==
The Uele forms at Dungu, at the confluence of the Dungu and Kibali rivers, which both originate in the mountains near Lake Albert. Combined these rivers flow west for about , until the Uele joins the Mbomou River at Yakoma. Main tributaries to the Uele river are the Bomokandi River (left side) and Uere River (right side).

The Uele–Mbomou confluence at Yakoma marks the origin of the Ubangi River, which in turn flows into the Congo River. The Uele is the longest tributary of the Ubangi. The combined Ubangi–Uele length is about .

From satellite images, parts of the river look red from the iron oxide contaminants in the river.

<text>&quot;A few acres of snow&quot; (in the original French, &quot;, , with &quot;) is one of several quotations from 18th-century writer French Voltaire, indicative of his sneering evaluation of the colony of Canada as lacking economic value and strategic importance to 18th-century France.

In Voltaire&#x27;s time, Canada was the name of a territory of New France that covered most of modern-day southern Quebec. However, &quot;Canada&quot; was also commonly used as a generic term to cover all of New France, including the whole of the Louisiana territory, as well as modern-day southern Ontario, Labrador, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. The meaning of &quot;Canada&quot; that Voltaire intended is a matter of some dispute.

The exact phrase &quot;&quot; first appears in 1759 in chapter 23 of Voltaire&#x27;s book &quot;Candide&quot;, but the phrase &quot;a few acres of ice&quot; appeared in a letter he wrote in 1757. Voltaire wrote similar sarcastic remarks in other works.

==Background==
In Voltaire&#x27;s day, New France included Canada, Acadia, Louisiana, and other territories. All of those colonies were the object of Voltaire&#x27;s sarcastic comments at one point or another.

Through all his writings on the subject, Voltaire&#x27;s basic idea about France&#x27;s Canadian colony always remained the same. It can be summarized as comprising an economic premise and a strategic premise, both of which concur to a practical conclusion, as follows:

* Almost the entirety of Canada&#x27;s territory is and will remain an unproductive and useless frozen wasteland.
* Great Britain, having establishing colonies on the more productive territories to the south and to the east (the Thirteen Colonies), and provided them with a much larger population, will not tolerate the presence of another European power in that area and will relentlessly attack Canada until such presence is ousted. Given the enormous disproportion in population and material resources between the French and British colonies in North America, the impossibility of modifying that imbalance in the foreseeable future and Britain&#x27;s generally-better control of the maritime routes to Europe, Britain will inevitably prevail sooner or later.
* Therefore, an effective defence of Canada by France requires an extraordinarily large commitment of resources in comparison to the scant economic value in return, and any resources thus expended, even if they allowed victories in the short term, are wasted as they can serve at best only to postpone for a few more decades the handing over of Canada to Britain, which is inevitable in the long term. Consequently, sound economic policy dictates handing over Canada to Britain as soon as possible and concentrating France&#x27;s resources in its West Indian colonies, which are more valuable economically and more readily defensible.

The year 1758 included the Battle of Fort Frontenac (August 26–28, a French defeat) and French naval secretary &#x27;s October refusal to provide with much-needed reinforcements to defend Quebec City. According to Berryer, &quot;we don&#x27;t try to save the stables when the fire is at the house&quot; (infamously, ). The British siege of Québec City ended in a French defeat in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in September 1759, and Montréal surrendered the next year.

Today&#x27;s critics of Voltaire&#x27;s opinion are directed primarily at his economic assessment of the Canadian colony. Voltaire&#x27;s idea of the Canadian colony based essentially on fur trade was even during his own writings already outdated by almost a century. Thus, although it may be difficult to determine exactly what part of his depiction of Canada might be attributed to deliberate exaggeration for polemical purposes, attachment to a preconceived idea, or mere misinformation, his few writings on the subject seem to display a certain level of short-sightedness regarding the actual level of economic evolution that had already been reached in the settled parts of Canada and about the colony&#x27;s potential for further development.

On the other hand, Voltaire&#x27;s assessment of the heavy financial burden required for France&#x27;s military defence of Canada and of the practical impossibility of such defence in the long term remains valid. Consequently, if he had espoused a more favourable idea of the economic potential of the colony, it would likely not have changed his general conclusion.

Voltaire&#x27;s famous quotations about New France were for the most part written between 1753 and 1763, shortly before and then during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Voltaire was living in Switzerland during most of that period. During the war, he sometimes appeared to favor King Frederick II of Prussia, who was allied with Britain against France. They maintained a regular personal correspondence during the war and were on better terms again after their quarrel of 1753.

Voltaire was also then in correspondence with some French ministers. He thus corresponded with both sides of the belligerents in the war although mostly on personal and literary levels, rather than a political level. Thinking that the war was a mistake for France, he used several opportunities to ask the French ministers to simply quit the war. Boundary disputes in their American colonies had been an early between Britain and France in 1754 in the war, which was in 1756 further complicated by purely-European considerations and ended in 1763. Voltaire&#x27;s position that France should let go of its North American colonies was in accord with his position about the war in general. For Voltaire, handing over New France would appease Britain. His position about the European war likely increased his tendency to paint New France as being of little value.

==Quotations in their textual context==
These quotations are presented in chronological order.

===1753 — ===
Chapter 151 — Of the possessions of the French in America:

===1756 — Letter to ===
In this letter to , written at , near , dated January 29, 1756, Voltaire mentions the earthquake that destroyed Lisbon, Portugal, on November 1, 1755.

===1757 — Letter to Mr ===
This letter from Voltaire to (1687–1770), written at , near Lausanne, on March 27, 1757, contains the first known direct use by Voltaire of his famous turn of phrase &quot;a few acres of ice in Canada.&quot; Also of note is the clear preposition of location &quot;&quot;in&quot; Canada.&quot; The relevant passage of the letter reads as follows:

The sentence from Voltaire&#x27;s letter to Moncrif has been quoted often. The 19th-century writer Jules Verne (1828–1905) quoted it in his novel &quot;A Family without a name&quot; (), published in 1889, which was set in the Canada of 1837 during the Lower Canada Rebellion. The famous sentence is quoted in Chapter 1 of the novel, which has likely contributed to the quotation&#x27;s popularity.

===1758 — ===
Voltaire used his &quot;few acres of ice&quot; phrase again the following year, slightly modified, in his novel (written in 1758 and published in 1759) although &quot;ice&quot; was now replaced by &quot;snow&quot;. The &quot;snow&quot; version of 1758 has generally become better known today in Canada than the &quot;ice&quot; version of 1757, perhaps because is sometimes used in high school courses. The relevant passage appears in chapter 23 of , l when two characters of the novel are exchanging thoughts about France and Britain:

In the original French version, Voltaire uses the phrase &quot;,&quot; and the preposition &quot; did not have the usual meaning that it now has in French. Instead, &quot; was commonly used by Voltaire in his writings to express a general meaning of vagueness about an area in the general sense of &quot;somewhere in or around the general area.&quot; It is apparent from the whole of his writings that he viewed or pretended to view, Canada as a vast icy and snowy area. Thus, it is immaterial to ponder if by &quot;a few acres&quot; Voltaire had in mind one of the areas in dispute in 1754, such as the Ohio Valley (in itself hardly an insignificant patch of land) or the Acadian border. By 1758, the war had extended to all possessions of the belligerents. Under Voltaire&#x27;s pen, the term is deliberately vague, and the point of using it is to convey the idea that any acres of land in the general area of Canada are so unimportant that even their location is not worth worrying about.

===1760 — Letter from ===
Although not a Voltaire quotation, this letter from (1719–1785), French Secretary of State (minister) for Foreign Affairs, to Voltaire, is an example of the correspondence between Voltaire and the French ministry and of &#x27;s dry humour in the manner he informs Voltaire of the fall of Canada:

===1760 — Letter to the ===
In this letter to (1716–1773), written at , Voltaire&#x27;s property near Geneva, on November 3, 1760, Voltaire writes:

===1762 — Letter to ===
This letter from Voltaire to (1712–1785), who had replaced his cousin as French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1761, was written at , on September 6, 1762 and is one of the best known of Voltaire&#x27;s letters about Canada and is mentioned anecdotally in some high school history textbooks. A short letter, it can be quoted in full:

===1763 — ===
The was written by Voltaire over several years. These relevant passages were likely written in or after 1763.

===1763 — Letter to ===
Although the quotation is not directly in it, this letter from Voltaire to (date uncertain, likely around 1763) illustrates Voltaire&#x27;s position and actions about the matter:

==Modern usage==
The phrase continues to be referenced in the modern era. Canadian poet paid himself a revenge on Voltaire in his poem &quot;&quot; (&quot;Under the statue of Voltaire&quot;), published in (1887).

 is the title of a 1972 movie by Denis Héroux, also known by the English title &quot;The Rebels&quot;. &quot;&quot; is a 1972 song by Claude Léveillée, written for the film.

In the 1980s, the marketers of the Quebec edition of the game &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; punningly named their product &quot;&quot; (A few acres of traps).

The name of the board game &quot;A Few Acres of Snow&quot; is derived from this phrase. Designed by Martin Wallace, it is about the French and British conflict over what is now Canada.

<text>Trolls are fictional characters in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, and feature in films and games adapted from his novels. They are portrayed as monstrously large humanoids of great strength and poor intellect. In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, like the dwarf Alviss of Norse mythology, they must be below ground before dawn or turn to stone, whereas in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; they are able to face daylight.

Commentators have noted the different uses Tolkien made of trolls, from comedy in Sam Gamgee&#x27;s poem and the Cockney accents and table manners of the working-class trolls in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, to the hellish atmosphere in Moria as the protagonists are confronted by darkness and monsters. Tolkien, a Roman Catholic, drew back from giving trolls the power of speech, as he had done in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, as it implied to him that they had souls – confronting him with a moral dilemma, so he made the trolls in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; darker and more bestial. They were supposedly bred by the Dark Lords Melkor and Sauron for their own evil purposes in mockery of ents, helping to express Tolkien&#x27;s combination of &quot;fairy tale with epic, ... bonded with the Christian mythos&quot;.

== Appearances ==

===&quot;The Hobbit&quot;===

In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Bilbo Baggins and the Dwarf company encountered three stone trolls on their journey to Erebor. The stone trolls captured the Dwarves and prepared to eat them, but the wizard Gandalf managed to distract them until dawn, when exposure to sunlight turned them to stone. They had vulgar table manners, constantly argued and fought amongst themselves, in Tolkien&#x27;s narrator&#x27;s words &quot;not drawing-room fashion at all, at all&quot;, spoke with Cockney accents, and had matching English working-class names: Tom, Bert, and William. Jennifer Eastman Attebery, a scholar of English, states that the stone trolls in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; &quot;signify the &quot;.

===&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;===

As Aragorn and the four hobbit companions made their way towards Rivendell through the Trollshaws, they came upon the three trolls that Bilbo and the dwarves had encountered many years earlier, and had seen turned to stone at daybreak. Sam Gamgee recited a comic poem, &quot;The Stone Troll&quot;, on the supposed dangers of kicking a troll, who has a &quot;seat&quot; which is &quot;harder than stone&quot;, to cheer everyone up.

Cave trolls attacked the Fellowship in Moria. One had dark greenish scales, black blood, and a hide so thick that when Boromir struck it in the arm his sword was notched. However, Frodo was able to impale the &quot;toeless&quot; foot of the same troll with the enchanted dagger Sting.

Mountain trolls wielded the great battering ram Grond to shatter the gates of Minas Tirith. They fought using clubs and round shields at the Battle of the Morannon. Sauron bred mountain and cave trolls, and developed the more intelligent Olog-hai that were not vulnerable to sunlight.

Snow trolls are mentioned only in the story of Helm Hammerhand. When Helm went out during the Long Winter clad in white to ambush his enemies, he was described as looking like a snow-troll.
The Trollshaws is a wooded region, lying north of the East Road between the rivers Hoarwell and Bruinen, where Bilbo encountered the trolls. It is not named in the text of either &quot;The Hobbit&quot; or &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but appears on the latter&#x27;s map of Middle-earth drawn by Christopher Tolkien. Described as &quot;the Trolls&#x27; wood&quot; in the main text, the name &quot;Trollshaws&quot; is derived from &quot;troll&quot; + &quot;shaw&quot;, an archaic term for a thicket or small wood.

===&quot;The Silmarillion&quot;===

Morgoth, the evil Vala, created trolls in the First Age of Middle-earth. They were strong and vicious but stupid; as in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, they turned to stone in sunlight. 
During the wars of Beleriand, Gothmog (the Lord of Balrogs) had a bodyguard of trolls. During the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, in which Morgoth defeated the united armies of Elves, Men, and Dwarves, the great warrior Húrin, a Man, faced Gothmog&#x27;s trolls to protect the retreat of the Elven king Turgon. Morgoth&#x27;s order to Gothmog to capture Húrin alive allowed Húrin to kill all the trolls. Many trolls died in the War of Wrath, but some survived and joined Sauron, the greatest surviving servant of Morgoth.

== Origins ==

In Germanic mythology, trolls are a kind of giant, along with &quot;rísar&quot;, &quot;jötnar&quot;, and &quot;þursar&quot;; the names are variously applied to large monstrous beings, sometimes as synonyms. The idea that such monsters must be below ground before dawn dates back to the &quot;Elder Edda&quot; of Norse mythology, where in the Alvíssmál, the god Thor keeps the dwarf Alviss (not a troll) talking until dawn, and sees him turn to stone.

Tom Shippey, a Tolkien scholar, writes that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; audience in 1937 were familiar with trolls from fairy tale collections such as those of Grimm, and Asbjørnsen and Moe&#x27;s &quot;Norwegian Folktales&quot;; Tolkien&#x27;s use of monsters of different kinds – orcs, trolls, and a balrog in Moria – made that journey &quot;a descent into hell&quot;. Attebery writes that Trolls thus moved from being grim Norse ogres to more sympathetic modern humanoids. In her view, Tolkien&#x27;s trolls are based on the ogre type, but with two &quot;incarnations&quot;: ancient trolls, &quot;creatures of dull and lumpish nature&quot; in Tolkien&#x27;s words, unable to speak; and the malicious giants of strength and courage bred by Sauron with &quot;enough intelligence to present a real danger&quot;. The scholar of English Edward Risden agrees that Tolkien&#x27;s later trolls appear far more dangerous than those of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, losing, too, &quot;the [moral] capacity to relent&quot;; he comments that in Norse mythology, trolls are &quot;normally female and strongly associated with magic&quot;, while in the Norse sagas the trolls were physically strong and superhuman in battle.

Christina Fawcett, a scholar of English, writes that Tolkien synthesises materials from different eras, so his writing and his creatures can take on different qualities, from playful to monstrous; his hill-trolls &quot;while still threatening, are primarily comic and slow-witted&quot;. On the other hand, when Gandalf outwits them, these same trolls are seen as &quot;monstrous, a warning against vice, captured forever in stone for their greed and anger.&quot; All the same, Fawcett cautions that Tolkien uses tradition selectively, transferring the more positive attributes of Norse trolls, including being rich and generous, to hobbits.

== Analysis ==

=== Trolls in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; ===

Shippey criticises Tolkien&#x27;s class-based depiction of the trolls and goblins in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, writing that the trolls were too close to labourers, just as the goblins were to munitions workers. Shippey notes, too, Tolkien&#x27;s storytelling technique here, observing that making the troll&#x27;s purse (which Bilbo attempts to steal) able to speak blurs the line between the ordinary and the magical.

Marjorie Burns, a scholar of English literature, writes that the trolls&#x27; tiredness with eating mutton every day matches the fantasy writer and designer William Morris&#x27;s account of his travels in Iceland in the early 1870s, one of many Middle-earth features that follows Morris, including the existence of trolls: Morris mentioned visiting places called &quot;Tröllakirkja&quot; (&quot;Trollchurch&quot;) and &quot;Tröllahals&quot; (&quot;Trollneck&quot;). Burns notes, too, that the adventure with the three trolls combines Bilbo&#x27;s fear of being eaten with the temptation of the &quot;fine toothsome smell&quot; of roast mutton.

The critic Gregory Hartley notes that while in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Tolkien&#x27;s trolls were still much like those of Norse mythology, &quot;archetypal, stereotypical ... basking in unexamined sentience&quot;, in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Tolkien undertook the difficult task of melding fairy tale with epic, which was in turn bonded with the Christian mythos. Characters and creatures began functioning on a multiplicity of registers.&quot; The entertainingly &quot;light-hearted informality&quot; of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;″s Cockney-speaking trolls thus gave way to the &quot;more bestial trolls&quot; of the later works. Hartley comments that the redaction effort that Tolkien threw himself into for his legendarium was driven by the way he had composed &quot;The Hobbit&quot;; and that the resulting &quot;rich, curious roles&quot; that trolls and other beasts play in Middle-earth would not have existed without it.

=== Speech, sentience, and souls ===

Fawcett suggests that Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;roaring Troll&quot; in &quot;The Return of the King&quot; reflects the Beowulf monster Grendel&#x27;s &quot;[fiery] eye and terrible screaming.&quot; Noting that Tolkien compares them to beasts as they &quot;came striding up, roaring like beasts ... bellowing&quot;, she observes that they &quot;remain wordless warriors, like Grendel&quot;, although they are sentient, with intelligence and a single language, unlike the varied tongues of Tolkien&#x27;s orcs.

Critics including Fawcett and Hartley note that by making all the beasts in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; talk, Tolkien, a devout Roman Catholic, had created a serious problem for himself: if trolls and other monsters were supposed to be sentient, they would in Christian terms have souls and be redeemable rather than wholly evil. Tolkien acknowledged this keenly-felt question: &quot;Of course ... when you make Trolls &quot;speak&quot; [Tolkien&#x27;s emphasis] you are giving them a power, which in our world (probably) connotes the possession of a &#x27;soul&#x27;.&quot; Fawcett distinguishes the approach of Tolkien&#x27;s narrator, who treats trolls as &quot;wholly monstrous&quot;, from his &quot;translator&#x27;s notes&quot; which take &quot;a slightly more balanced view&quot;. She states that Tolkien adopts a similar multiplicity of viewpoints on the in-fiction creation of trolls: Frodo tells Sam that the Shadow cannot create &quot;real new things of its own&quot;, but all the same, she writes, the &quot;stone-bred mockery&quot; seems very much alive. This is, Fawcett writes, in contrast to Tolkien&#x27;s intelligent dragons, which are straightforwardly a created species with the power of speech, but certainly monsters; and in contrast to orcs which, if they are corrupted elves, do have souls. She concludes that Tolkien&#x27;s linking of souls to speech &quot;complicates these monstrous races&quot;.

Tolkien had another conceptual problem with the existence of evil creatures, as he believed that while good could create, evil could not. So he considered whether his evil creatures could have been corrupted from sentient beings, and whether they could breed, writing various and contradictory explanations of their origins. In &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, the leader of the Ents, Treebeard, remarks that trolls were &quot;made ... in mockery of Ents&quot;, as Orcs were of Elves. Friedhelm Schneidewind, writing in the &quot;J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, states the precise origin of trolls &quot;perhaps from giant apes but possibly from Men, Orcs, or &#x27;Spirits&#x27;&quot; is not given by Tolkien, but like Orcs, trolls were bred by Melkor and Sauron for their own evil purposes.

=== Defeat of evil ===

The Inklings scholar Charles A. Huttar writes that the trolls&#x27; presence, alongside orcs and the Balrog, means that &quot;Moria not only houses inert obstacles but active monsters&quot;.
Burns notes that with the destruction of Sauron, trolls, like the rest of Sauron&#x27;s minions, were scattered in defeat, though some survived by hiding in the hills. In Burns&#x27;s view, this makes Tolkien appear both optimistic, since evil can be defeated, and pessimistic, as that defeat is never absolute.

=== Country folk music ===

The Tolkien scholar David Bratman writes that even though there is no sheet music in Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth writings, we do &quot;surprisingly&quot; have &quot;a very good idea&quot; of how some of it should sound. In 1952, Tolkien recited part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; for George Sayer to record, and sang Sam Gamgee&#x27;s song of the Stone Troll, unaccompanied and in a &quot;rough and untrained&quot; voice; but as Bratman comments, &quot;but surely so was Sam&#x27;s.&quot; Sayer states in the liner notes of the LP album of the recordings that Tolkien sang the song to &quot;an old English folk-tune called The Fox and Hens.&quot; Bratman states that this is a variant of &quot;The Fox and the Goose&quot; or &quot;The Fox Went Out on a Chilly Night&quot;. He comments that Tolkien sings in a major key, like Cecil Sharp&#x27;s &quot;southern English melodies&quot; for the song. Bratman finds this &quot;appropriate&quot;, noting Tolkien&#x27;s comment that the Shire &quot;is in fact more or less a Warwickshire village&quot; of around 1897. In short, Bratman concludes, Tolkien intended readers to imagine Hobbits as &quot;English country folk singing English folk songs.&quot; The poem appears also in &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;; in the Tolkien critic Paul H. Kocher&#x27;s words, it achieves a certain &quot;grisly slapstick&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film ===

Trolls are replaced by &quot;Groans&quot; in Gene Deitch&#x27;s 1967 animated short film adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

In Rankin/Bass&#x27;s animated 1977 adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the trolls were voiced by Paul Frees, Jack DeLeon, and Don Messick, who all also voiced other characters.

Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 animated version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; follows the book faithfully in its depiction of the encounter with the cave troll in the Chamber, though the cave troll&#x27;s foot has toes. Glenn Gaslin, reviewing the film on &quot;Slate&quot;, describes a clip from the film as &quot;of ravenous trolls, [which] does no justice to Tolkien&#x27;s darker elements&quot;.

Trolls appear in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Bilbo Baggins recounts his altercation with the three stone-trolls and later on, the four hobbits and Aragorn are shown resting in the shelter of the petrified trolls. The location used was Piopio, Waitomo District, in New Zealand. In the mines of Moria, a single cave troll, animated in software, is among the attackers and is depicted with two toes.
In &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, trolls fight in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, and Aragorn fights an armoured troll in the Battle of the Morannon, a departure from the book; Jackson had at one stage intended Aragorn to fight the Dark Lord Sauron in person, but &quot;wisely&quot; reduced this to combat with a troll.
In &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot; the three stone trolls appear as in Tolkien&#x27;s book. The trolls are portrayed through voice and motion capture with Bert performed by Mark Hadlow, Tom is performed by William Kircher, and William is performed by Peter Hambleton.

In &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot;, trolls appear in Azog&#x27;s army as shock troops. Some of the trolls have catapults mounted on their backs while others have bladed shields and other strange weaponry, such as one troll who had flails sutured to its limbs. Behind the scenes, Peter Jackson&#x27;s design team added trolls to the orc army, saying that they were a &quot;natural extension of the orcs&#x27; forces&quot;.

=== Television ===
The trolls appear in the Amazon Studios series &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;. The first episode of season one featured a snow-troll that attacked Galadriel&#x27;s group at the abandoned fortress at Forodwaith. She was able to slay the snow-troll. Season two features a hill-troll named Damrod (voiced by Benjamin Walker in &quot;The Eagle and the Sceptre&quot;, Jason Smith in &quot;Doomed to Die&quot;) who allies with Adar&#x27;s forces. Damrod is described by Adar to be the &quot;Eater of Dragon Bones&quot; and &quot;Slayer of the Stone Giants&quot;. After bringing back the head of an orc messenger sent to persuade him to ally with Adar, Damrod asks &quot;Where is Sauron&quot;?

=== Games ===
Trolls have featured in many video games set in Middle-earth, including &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age&quot;, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Conquest&quot;. In &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king&quot;, the Angmar faction has a hill-troll hero named Rogash (voiced by Gregg Berger), and an Olog-hai named Brûz the Chopper (voiced by Gideon Emery) is important to the plot of &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of War&quot;.

Middle-earth trolls have appeared in tabletop role-playing games; for example, the core book for &quot;Middle-earth Role Playing&quot;, published by Iron Crown Enterprises, included rules for Normal Trolls, Olog-hai (or Black Trolls), and Half-Trolls, and the publisher released an adventure module called &quot;Trolls of the Misty Mountains&quot;. &quot;Middle Earth Strategy Battle Game&quot; includes trolls, while Games Workshop produce a selection of troll miniatures.

<doc id="513090" wikidata="Q1067080" url="?curid=513090" title="All Dogs Go to Heaven">
<text>All Dogs Go to Heaven is a 1989 animated musical fantasy comedy-drama film directed by Don Bluth and co-directed by Gary Goldman (his directorial debut) and Dan Kuenster. Set in New Orleans in 1939, it tells the story of Charlie B. Barkin (voiced by Burt Reynolds), a German Shepherd that is murdered by his former friend, Carface Carruthers (voiced by Vic Tayback). Charlie escapes from Heaven to return to Earth where his best friend, Itchy Itchiford (voiced by Dom DeLuise), still lives, in order to take revenge on Carface. Instead, he ends up befriending a young orphan girl named Anne-Marie (voiced by Judith Barsi in her final film role). In the process, Charlie learns an important lesson about kindness, friendship and love.

The film is an Irish, British and American venture, produced by Goldcrest Films and Sullivan Bluth Studios Ireland Limited. On its cinema release, it competed directly with Walt Disney Feature Animation&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, released on the same day. While it did not repeat the box-office success of Sullivan Bluth&#x27;s previous features, &quot;An American Tail&quot; and &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;, it was successful on home video, becoming one of the biggest-selling VHS releases ever. It was followed by a theatrical sequel, a television series, and a holiday direct-to-video film.

== Plot ==
In 1939 New Orleans, Charlie B. Barkin escapes from the dog pound with the help of his best friend Itchy Itchiford and returns to their casino riverboat on the bayou. His business partner, Carface Caruthers is surprised to see Charlie alive and is reluctant to share the profits with him. Carface had secretly been responsible for Charlie getting committed to the pound due to greed and decides to get rid of him for good this time by killing him with a car. Despite not having done any good lifetime deeds Charlie is automatically sent to Heaven. He is then greeted by a whippet angel who explains to him that because dogs are inherently good and loyal, all dogs go to Heaven and are entitled to paradise. Taking advantage of her kindness, Charlie cheats death by stealing a pocket watch representing his life and winding it back. As Charlie descends back to Earth, the whippet angel tells him that he can never return to Heaven.

When Charlie returns he reunites with Itchy and plots revenge in the form of a rivaling business. They soon discover that Carface&#x27;s success has been from a kidnapped young orphan girl named Anne-Marie for her ability to talk to animals, which proves helpful when betting on races. While Charlie rescues her and promises to feed the poor and help her find a family, he takes her to a race track the following day to gamble. Charlie steals a wallet from a couple as they talk to Anne-Marie and become concerned by her rough appearance. Charlie and Itchy use their winnings to build a successful casino in the junkyard where they live. Anne-Marie threatens to leave when she realizes she has been used, but Charlie persuade her to stay by bringing pizza to a family of poor puppies and their mother (Flo) at an abandoned church. Although initially a success, Anne-Marie becomes angry at Charlie when she discovers the stolen wallet.

As Charlie has a nightmare in which he is condemned to Hell, Anne-Marie returns the wallet to the couple who introduce themselves as Kate and Harold. As they privately discuss adopting her Charlie arrives and tricks her into leaving with him. Charlie and Anne-Marie narrowly escape an ambush by Carface and his assistant Killer and hide in an abandoned building, but the ground breaks and they fall into the lair of a giant alligator named King Gator. He and Charlie bond over a love of music and he lets them go, but Anne-Marie catches pneumonia in the process. Carface and his thugs destroy Charlie&#x27;s casino and assault Itchy. Feeling abandoned, Itchy limps back to the church to confront Charlie about his relationship with Anne-Marie. Charlie retorts in exasperation that he is using her and will eventually &quot;dump her in an orphanage&quot;. A heartbroken Anne-Marie overhears the conversation and tearfully runs away before she is kidnapped by Carface. Charlie follows them to Carface&#x27;s casino, where he is ambushed by his thugs. As they fight with Charlie they inadvertently start an oil fire that soon engulfs the whole structure. Charlie&#x27;s pained howls from their bites summon King Gator, who chases down and devours Carface.

During the chaos both Anne-Marie and the watch fall into the water, but Charlie is unable to rescue both at the same time. He then decides to choose Anne-Marie by placing her onto some driftwood and pushes her toward safety, but Charlie&#x27;s life ends as the watch stops before he can retrieve it. As Killer finishes pushing her to shore Kate and Harold are waiting with police and medical personnel, alongside Itchy, Flo, and the other dogs from New Orleans. Sometime later, Kate and Harold adopt Anne-Marie, who has also adopted Itchy. Charlie, having sacrificed himself to save Anne-Marie, has earned back his place in Heaven, and is allowed to return in ghost form to reconcile with Anne-Marie. Leaving Itchy in her care, Charlie returns to Heaven, where, in a mid-credits scene, Carface finally arrives and takes his own watch, vowing revenge against King Gator. As the whippet angel chases him and warns against using it, Charlie assures the audience that &quot;he&#x27;ll be back&quot;.

== Production ==
The earliest idea was conceived by Don Bluth after finishing work on &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;. The treatment was originally about a canine private eye, and one of three short stories, making up an anthology film. The character of a shaggy German Shepherd was designed specifically for Burt Reynolds. However, Bluth&#x27;s first studio, Don Bluth Productions, was going through a period of financial difficulty, ultimately having to declare bankruptcy, and the idea never made it beyond rough storyboards. The concept was revived by Bluth, John Pomeroy and Gary Goldman, and rewritten by David N. Weiss, collaborating with the producers from October through December 1987. They built around the title &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; and drew inspiration from films, such as &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot; and &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot;. The film&#x27;s title came from a book read to Bluth&#x27;s fourth-grade class, and he resisted suggestions to change it, stating he liked how &quot;provocative&quot; it sounded, and how people reacted to the title alone.

During the production of their previous feature film, Sullivan Bluth Studios had moved from Van Nuys, California, to a state-of-the-art studio facility in Dublin, Ireland, and the film was their first to begin production wholly at the Irish studio. It was also their first to be funded from sources outside of Hollywood, the previous two feature films, &quot;An American Tail&quot; and &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;, had been backed by Amblin Entertainment and Universal Pictures, and executive producers Steven Spielberg and George Lucas (for &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; only) exercised a degree of control over the content of the films, a situation Bluth found disagreeable. The studio found investment from UK-based Goldcrest Films in a US$70m deal to produce three animated feature films (though only two, &quot;Rock-a-Doodle&quot; and it, were completed under the deal). The three founding members of the studio, Bluth, Pomeroy, and Goldman, had all moved to Ireland to set up the new facility, but during the film&#x27;s production, John Pomeroy returned to the U.S. to head up a satellite studio which provided some of the animation for the film. Pomeroy also used his presence in the U.S. to generate early publicity for the film, including a presentation at the 1987 San Diego Comic-Con.

The film&#x27;s lead voices, Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, had previously appeared together in five films. For this one, they requested them to record their parts in the studio together (in American animation, actors more commonly record their parts solo). Bluth agreed and allowed the duo to ad-lib extensively; Bluth later commented that &quot;their ad-libs were often better than the original script&quot;, but Reynolds was more complimentary of the draft, warmly quipping, &quot;Great script, kid&quot;, as he left the studio. Another pair of voices, those of Carface and Killer (Vic Tayback and Charles Nelson Reilly, respectively), also recorded together. Loni Anderson, who voices Flo, was Reynolds&#x27; then-wife. Child actress Judith Barsi, who voiced Ducky in Bluth&#x27;s previous film &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;, was selected to voice Anne-Marie; she was killed in an apparent murder-suicide over a year before &quot;All Dogs&quot; was released.

As production neared completion, the studio held test screenings and decided that some scenes were too intense for younger viewers. Pomeroy decided to shorten Charlie&#x27;s nightmare about being condemned. Goldman also agreed to the cut, recognizing that the concession needed to be made in the name of commercial appeal. Bluth owned a private 35-mm print with the excised scenes and planned to convince Goldcrest on releasing a director&#x27;s cut after returning from Ireland in the mid-1990s, but the print was eventually stolen from Bluth&#x27;s locked storage room, diminishing hopes of this version being released on home media.

== Music ==

The music for &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; was composed by Ralph Burns with lyrics by Charles Strouse, T.J. Kuenster, Joel Hirschhorn, and Al Kasha. An official soundtrack was released on July 1, 1989, by Curb Records on audio cassette and CD featuring 13 tracks, including seven vocal songs performed by various cast members. The track &quot;Let Me Be Surprised&quot; contains a swear word in a dialogue cut from the final product. &quot;Love Survives&quot;, the end credits song and overall theme, was dedicated to Anne-Marie&#x27;s voice actress Judith Barsi, who was shot by her father, József, along with her mother, Maria, before the film&#x27;s release on July 25, 1988.

== Reception and legacy ==
=== Critical response ===
&quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; received mostly mixed reviews, maintaining a 46% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews, and a 50 out of 100 score from Metacritic. Reviewers often drew unfavorable comparisons to &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, criticizing the disjointed narrative, the quality of the animation, and the songs by Charlie Strouse and T.J. Kuenster. The film received a &quot;thumbs down&quot; from Gene Siskel and a &quot;thumbs up&quot; from Roger Ebert on a 1989 episode of their television program &quot;At the Movies&quot;. While Siskel found it to be &quot;surprisingly weak&quot; given director Don Bluth&#x27;s previous works, largely due to its &quot;confusing story&quot; and &quot;needlessly violent&quot; scenes, Ebert was a huge fan of the film&#x27;s &quot;rubbery and kind of flexible&quot; animation, stating that it was a good film despite not being an &quot;animated classic&quot;.

Some also found the darker subject material objectionable in a family film, given the film&#x27;s depictions of death, violence, theft, drinking, smoking, gambling, murder, demons, and images of Hell. Other reviews were mostly positive, with critics praising the film&#x27;s emotional qualities, humor, and vibrant color palette. Roger Ebert, who was unimpressed with Bluth&#x27;s previous film &quot;An American Tail&quot;, gave it three out of four stars, remarking that the animation &quot;permits such a voluptuous use of color that the movie is an invigorating bath for the eyes&quot; and that although he preferred &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, which opened on the same day, he still found &quot;Dogs&quot; to be bright and inventive. In contrast, film critic Leonard Maltin gave it one-and-a-half out of four stars, due to unappealing characters, confusing storytelling, and forgettable songs. Common Sense Media was concerned about the depictions of illegal drug usage and excessive thematic elements plotting in a family oriented movie.

=== Box office ===
Dissatisfied with the terms imposed by Universal Pictures, which had distributed their previous two films, the studio found an alternative distributor in United Artists. Somewhat unusually, production investors Goldcrest Films covered the cost of the release prints and the promotional campaign, in return for a greatly reduced distribution fee from UA. This was similar to the arrangement with United Artists when they distributed Bluth&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;. Goldcrest Films invested $15 million in print and promotion. Due to contractual issues, very little tie-in merchandise accompanied the film&#x27;s theatrical release; a computer game adaptation for the Commodore Amiga system (with a free software package) was released, and restaurant chain Wendy&#x27;s offered toys with their Kids&#x27; Meals or regular fries.

The film opened in North America on November 17, 1989, concurrent with Disney&#x27;s 28th full-length animated motion picture &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;; once again, Sullivan Bluth would be vying for box-office receipts with Disney, just as their last two films (&quot;An American Tail&quot; and &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;) had. On its theatrical release, the film was only moderately successful as its performance fell short of the studio&#x27;s previous box-office successes, grossing $27 million in North America alone, just over half of what &quot;An American Tail&quot; and &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; each took.

This would be Bluth&#x27;s final box office hit until &quot;Anastasia&quot; was released eight years later in 1997, which ended up becoming his highest-grossing film.

== Awards and honors ==
&quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Best Family Motion Picture: Adventure or Cartoon&quot; at the 11th Annual Youth in Film Awards ceremony, being beaten by Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. The home video release received an Award of Excellence from the Film Advisory Board. &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; was nominated for Best Family Motion Picture: Adventure or Cartoon at the Youth in Film Awards.

== Home media ==
&quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; was released on VHS, S-VHS, 8mm video and LaserDisc in both regular and special CAV standard play editions by MGM/UA Home Video on August 28, 1990. The film became a sleeper hit due to its home video release; a strong promotional campaign helped it become one of the top-selling VHS releases of all time, selling over 3 million copies in its first month. The film was followed by another VHS release under the MGM/UA Family Entertainment label in 1994, which was available exclusively through Warner Home Video.

A DVD was made available for the first time on March 6, 2001, under the MGM Kids label and was later released as a double feature with &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven 2&quot; on March 14, 2006. On March 29, 2011, the film made its debut on Blu-ray, which was later included as a bundle with its sequel on October 7, 2014, along with a re-release of the compilation on DVD. The Blu-ray version was also packaged with another Don Bluth film, &quot;The Pebble and the Penguin&quot;, on October 8, 2013, and again with eight other MGM films as part of the company&#x27;s 90th anniversary &quot;Best of Family Collection&quot; on February 4, 2014.

A video game based on the film, also titled &quot;All Dogs Go To Heaven&quot;, was released in 1989 for DOS and in 1990 for Amiga. The game features ten mini-games loosely tied together to form a story mode, with three difficulty levels. The game&#x27;s minigames include rat racing, watch catching, horizontal ball and paddle, maze navigating, shape stacking, maze running, hangman, jigsaw puzzle, street navigating and dog fighting. An activity center game based on the film, titled &quot;All Dogs Go To Heaven Activity Center&quot;, was released for Windows PC in 1997.

== Sequels ==
The success of the film, particularly its performance on home video, prompted several follow-up productions. A theatrical sequel, &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven 2&quot; (1996), a television series, &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series&quot; (1996–1998), and &quot;An All Dogs Christmas Carol&quot; (1998), a Christmas television film based on Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, were made. Bluth and his studio had no involvement with any of them, and Reynolds did not reprise his role as Charlie after the first film; he was replaced in the sequel film and television series by Charlie Sheen and Steven Weber, respectively. Reilly declined to return for the sequel film, but voiced Killer for the television productions. DeLuise played Itchy through the entire franchise.

<text>In genetics and bioinformatics, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP ; plural SNPs ) is a germline substitution of a single nucleotide at a specific position in the genome. Although certain definitions require the substitution to be present in a sufficiently large fraction of the population (e.g. 1% or more), many publications do not apply such a frequency threshold.

For example, a G nucleotide present at a specific location in a reference genome may be replaced by an A in a minority of individuals. The two possible nucleotide variations of this SNP – G or A – are called alleles.

SNPs can help explain differences in susceptibility to a wide range of diseases across a population. For example, a common SNP in the CFH gene is associated with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration. Differences in the severity of an illness or response to treatments may also be manifestations of genetic variations caused by SNPs. For example, two common SNPs in the &quot;APOE&quot; gene, rs429358 and rs7412, lead to three major APO-E alleles with different associated risks for development of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and age at onset of the disease.

Single nucleotide substitutions with an allele frequency of less than 1% are sometimes called single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). &quot;Variant&quot; may also be used as a general term for any single nucleotide change in a DNA sequence, encompassing both common SNPs and rare mutations, whether germline or somatic. The term SNV has therefore been used to refer to point mutations found in cancer cells. DNA variants must also commonly be taken into consideration in molecular diagnostics applications such as designing PCR primers to detect viruses, in which the viral RNA or DNA sample may contain SNVs. However, this nomenclature uses arbitrary distinctions (such as an allele frequency of 1%) and is not used consistently across all fields; the resulting disagreement has prompted calls for a more consistent framework for naming differences in DNA sequences between two samples.

== Types ==
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms may fall within coding sequences of genes, non-coding regions of genes, or in the intergenic regions (regions between genes). SNPs within a coding sequence do not necessarily change the amino acid sequence of the protein that is produced, due to degeneracy of the genetic code.

SNPs in the coding region are of two types: synonymous SNPs and nonsynonymous SNPs. Synonymous SNPs do not affect the protein sequence, while nonsynonymous SNPs change the amino acid sequence of protein.
* SNPs in non-coding regions can manifest in a higher risk of cancer, and may affect mRNA structure and disease susceptibility. Non-coding SNPs can also alter the level of expression of a gene, as an eQTL (expression quantitative trait locus).
* SNPs in coding regions:
** synonymous substitutions by definition do not result in a change of amino acid in the protein, but still can affect its function in other ways. An example would be a seemingly silent mutation in the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), which codes for a cellular membrane pump that expels drugs from the cell, can slow down translation and allow the peptide chain to fold into an unusual conformation, causing the mutant pump to be less functional (in MDR1 protein e.g. C1236T polymorphism changes a GGC codon to GGT at amino acid position 412 of the polypeptide (both encode glycine) and the C3435T polymorphism changes ATC to ATT at position 1145 (both encode isoleucine)).
** nonsynonymous substitutions:
*** missense – single change in the base results in change in amino acid of protein and its malfunction which leads to disease (e.g. c.1580G&gt;T SNP in LMNA gene – position 1580 (nt) in the DNA sequence (CGT codon) causing the guanine to be replaced with the thymine, yielding CTT codon in the DNA sequence, results at the protein level in the replacement of the arginine by the leucine in the position 527, at the phenotype level this manifests in overlapping mandibuloacral dysplasia and progeria syndrome)
*** nonsense – point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a &quot;nonsense codon&quot; in the transcribed mRNA, and in a truncated, incomplete, and usually nonfunctional protein product (e.g. Cystic fibrosis caused by the G542X mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene).

SNPs that are not in protein-coding regions may still affect gene splicing, transcription factor binding, messenger RNA degradation, or the sequence of noncoding RNA. Gene expression affected by this type of SNP is referred to as an eSNP (expression SNP) and may be upstream or downstream from the gene.

== Frequency ==

More than 600 million SNPs have been identified across the human genome in the world&#x27;s population. A typical genome differs from the reference human genome at 4–5 million sites, most of which (more than 99.9%) consist of SNPs and short indels.

=== Within a genome ===
The genomic distribution of SNPs is not homogenous; SNPs occur in non-coding regions more frequently than in coding regions or, in general, where natural selection is acting and &quot;fixing&quot; the allele (eliminating other variants) of the SNP that constitutes the most favorable genetic adaptation. Other factors, like genetic recombination and mutation rate, can also determine SNP density.

SNP density can be predicted by the presence of microsatellites: AT microsatellites in particular are potent predictors of SNP density, with long (AT)(n) repeat tracts tending to be found in regions of significantly reduced SNP density and low GC content.

=== Within a population ===
Since there are variations between human populations, a SNP allele that is common in one geographical or ethnic group may be rarer in another. However, this pattern of variation is relatively rare; in a global sample of 67.3 million SNPs, the Human Genome Diversity Project &quot;found no such private variants that are fixed in a given continent or major region. The highest frequencies are reached by a few tens of variants present at &gt;70% (and a few thousands at &gt;50%) in Africa, the Americas, and Oceania. By contrast, the highest frequency variants private to Europe, East Asia, the Middle East, or Central and South Asia reach just 10 to 30%.&quot;

Within a population, SNPs can be assigned a minor allele frequency (MAF)—the lowest allele frequency at a locus that is observed in a particular population. This is simply the lesser of the two allele frequencies for single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

With this knowledge, scientists have developed new methods in analyzing population structures in less studied species. By using pooling techniques, the cost of the analysis is significantly lowered. These techniques are based on sequencing a population in a pooled sample instead of sequencing every individual within the population by itself. With new bioinformatics tools, there is a possibility of investigating population structure, gene flow, and gene migration by observing the allele frequencies within the entire population. With these protocols there is a possibility for combining the advantages of SNPs with micro satellite markers. However, there is information lost in the process, such as linkage disequilibrium and zygosity information.

== Applications ==

* Association studies (such as GWAS, see below) can determine whether a genetic variant is associated with a disease or trait.
* A tag SNP is a representative single-nucleotide polymorphism in a region of the genome with high linkage disequilibrium (the non-random association of alleles at two or more loci). Tag SNPs are useful in whole-genome SNP association studies, in which hundreds of thousands of SNPs across the entire genome are genotyped.
* Haplotype mapping: sets of alleles or DNA sequences can be clustered so that a single SNP can identify many linked SNPs.
* Linkage disequilibrium (LD), a term used in population genetics, indicates non-random association of alleles at two or more loci, not necessarily on the same chromosome. It refers to the phenomenon that SNP allele or DNA sequence that are close together in the genome tend to be inherited together. LD can be affected by two parameters (among other factors, such as population stratification):
** The distance between the SNPs (the larger the distance, the lower the LD)
** Recombination rate (the lower the recombination rate, the higher the LD)
* In genetic epidemiology SNPs are used to estimate transmission clusters.

=== Importance ===
Variations in the DNA sequences of humans can affect how humans develop diseases and respond to pathogens, chemicals, drugs, vaccines, and other agents. SNPs are also critical for personalized medicine. Examples include biomedical research, forensics, pharmacogenetics, and disease causation, as outlined below.

=== Clinical research ===

==== Genome-wide association study (GWAS) ====
One of the main contributions of SNPs in clinical research is genome-wide association study (GWAS). Genome-wide genetic data can be generated by multiple technologies, including SNP array and whole genome sequencing. GWAS has been commonly used in identifying SNPs associated with diseases or clinical phenotypes or traits. Since GWAS is a genome-wide assessment, a large sample site is required to obtain sufficient statistical power to detect all possible associations. Some SNPs have relatively small effect on diseases or clinical phenotypes or traits. To estimate study power, the genetic model for disease needs to be considered, such as dominant, recessive, or additive effects. Due to genetic heterogeneity, GWAS analysis must be adjusted for race.

==== Candidate gene association study ====
Candidate gene association study is commonly used in genetic study before the invention of high throughput genotyping or sequencing technologies. Candidate gene association study is to investigate limited number of pre-specified SNPs for association with diseases or clinical phenotypes or traits. So this is a hypothesis driven approach. Since only a limited number of SNPs are tested, a relatively small sample size is sufficient to detect the association. Candidate gene association approach is also commonly used to confirm findings from GWAS in independent samples.

==== Homozygosity mapping in disease ====
Genome-wide SNP data can be used for homozygosity mapping. Homozygosity mapping is a method used to identify homozygous autosomal recessive loci, which can be a powerful tool to map genomic regions or genes that are involved in disease pathogenesis.

==== Methylation patterns ====

Recently, preliminary results reported SNPs as important components of the epigenetic program in organisms. Moreover, cosmopolitan studies in European and South Asiatic populations have revealed the influence of SNPs in the methylation of specific CpG sites. In addition, meQTL enrichment analysis using GWAS database, demonstrated that those associations are important toward the prediction of biological traits.  

=== Forensic sciences ===

SNPs have historically been used to match a forensic DNA sample to a suspect but has been made obsolete due to advancing STR-based DNA fingerprinting techniques. However, the development of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) technology may allow for more opportunities for the use of SNPs in phenotypic clues such as ethnicity, hair color, and eye color with a good probability of a match. This can additionally be applied to increase the accuracy of facial reconstructions by providing information that may otherwise be unknown, and this information can be used to help identify suspects even without a STR DNA profile match.

Some cons to using SNPs versus STRs is that SNPs yield less information than STRs, and therefore more SNPs are needed for analysis before a profile of a suspect is able to be created. Additionally, SNPs heavily rely on the presence of a database for comparative analysis of samples. However, in instances with degraded or small volume samples, SNP techniques are an excellent alternative to STR methods. SNPs (as opposed to STRs) have an abundance of potential markers, can be fully automated, and a possible reduction of required fragment length to less than 100 bp.

=== Pharmacogenetics ===
Pharmacogenetics focuses on identifying genetic variations including SNPs associated with differential responses to treatment. Many drug metabolizing enzymes, drug targets, or target pathways can be influenced by SNPs. The SNPs involved in drug metabolizing enzyme activities can change drug pharmacokinetics, while the SNPs involved in drug target or its pathway can change drug pharmacodynamics. Therefore, SNPs are potential genetic markers that can be used to predict drug exposure or effectiveness of the treatment. Genome-wide pharmacogenetic study is called pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are important in the development of precision medicine, especially for life-threatening diseases such as cancers.

=== Disease ===
Only small amount of SNPs in the human genome may have impact on human diseases. Large scale GWAS has been done for the most important human diseases, including heart diseases, metabolic diseases, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Most of the SNPs with relatively large effects on these diseases have been identified. These findings have significantly improved understanding of disease pathogenesis and molecular pathways, and facilitated development of better treatment. Further GWAS with larger samples size will reveal the SNPs with relatively small effect on diseases. For common and complex diseases, such as type-2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, multiple genetic factors are involved in disease etiology. In addition, gene-gene interaction and gene-environment interaction also play an important role in disease initiation and progression.

== Examples ==
* rs6311 and rs6313 are SNPs in the Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor gene on human chromosome 13.
* The SNP − 3279C/A (rs3761548) is amongst the SNPs locating in the promoter region of the Foxp3 gene, might be involved in cancer progression.
* A SNP in the &quot;F5&quot; gene causes Factor V Leiden thrombophilia.
* rs3091244 is an example of a triallelic SNP in the CRP gene on human chromosome 1.
* TAS2R38 codes for PTC tasting ability, and contains 6 annotated SNPs.
* rs148649884 and rs138055828 in the &quot;FCN1&quot; gene encoding M-ficolin crippled the ligand-binding capability of the recombinant M-ficolin.
* rs12821256 on a &quot;cis&quot;-regulatory module changes the amount of transcription of the KIT ligand gene. Among northern Europeans, high levels of transcription leads to brown hair, and low levels leads to blond hair. This is an example of overt but non-pathological phenotype change by one SNP.
* An intronic SNP in DNA mismatch repair gene &quot;PMS2&quot; (rs1059060, Ser775Asn) is associated with increased sperm DNA damage and risk of male infertility.

== Databases ==
As there are for genes, bioinformatics databases exist for SNPs.
* &quot;dbSNP&quot; is a SNP database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). , dbSNP listed 149,735,377 SNPs in humans.
* &quot;Kaviar&quot; is a compendium of SNPs from multiple data sources including dbSNP.
* &quot;SNPedia&quot; is a wiki-style database supporting personal genome annotation, interpretation and analysis.
* The &quot;OMIM&quot; database describes the association between polymorphisms and diseases (e.g., gives diseases in text form)
* dbSAP – single amino-acid polymorphism database for protein variation detection
* The Human Gene Mutation Database provides gene mutations causing or associated with human inherited diseases and functional SNPs
* The International HapMap Project, where researchers are identifying Tag SNPs to be able to determine the collection of haplotypes present in each subject.
* GWAS Central allows users to visually interrogate the actual summary-level association data in one or more genome-wide association studies.

The International SNP Map working group mapped the sequence flanking each SNP by alignment to the genomic sequence of large-insert clones in Genebank. These alignments were converted to chromosomal coordinates that is shown in Table 1. This list has greatly increased since, with, for instance, the Kaviar database now listing 162 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs).
== Nomenclature ==
The nomenclature for SNPs include several variations for an individual SNP, while lacking a common consensus.

The rs### standard is that which has been adopted by dbSNP and uses the prefix &quot;rs&quot;, for &quot;reference SNP&quot;, followed by a unique and arbitrary number. SNPs are frequently referred to by their dbSNP rs number, as in the examples above.

The Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) uses a standard which conveys more information about the SNP. Examples are:
* c.76A&gt;T: &quot;c.&quot; for coding region, followed by a number for the position of the nucleotide, followed by a one-letter abbreviation for the nucleotide (A, C, G, T, or U), followed by a greater than sign (&quot;&gt;&quot;) to indicate substitution, followed by the abbreviation of the nucleotide which replaces the former
* p.Ser123Arg: &quot;p.&quot; for protein, followed by a three-letter abbreviation for the amino acid, followed by a number for the position of the amino acid, followed by the abbreviation of the amino acid which replaces the former.

== SNP analysis ==
SNPs can be easily assayed due to only containing two possible alleles and three possible genotypes involving the two alleles: homozygous A, homozygous B and heterozygous AB, leading to many possible techniques for analysis. Some include: DNA sequencing; capillary electrophoresis; mass spectrometry; single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP); single base extension; electrochemical analysis; denaturating HPLC and gel electrophoresis; restriction fragment length polymorphism; and hybridization analysis.

== Programs for prediction of SNP effects ==
An important group of SNPs are those that corresponds to missense mutations causing amino acid change on protein level. Point mutation of particular residue can have different effect on protein function (from no effect to complete disruption its function). Usually, change in amino acids with similar size and physico-chemical properties (e.g. substitution from leucine to valine) has mild effect, and opposite. Similarly, if SNP disrupts secondary structure elements (e.g. substitution to proline in alpha helix region) such mutation usually may affect whole protein structure and function. Using those simple and many other machine learning derived rules a group of programs for the prediction of SNP effect was developed:
* SIFT This program provides insight into how a laboratory induced missense or nonsynonymous mutation will affect protein function based on physical properties of the amino acid and sequence homology.
* LIST (Local Identity and Shared Taxa) estimates the potential deleteriousness of mutations resulted from altering their protein functions. It is based on the assumption that variations observed in closely related species are more significant when assessing conservation compared to those in distantly related species.
* SNAP2
* SuSPect
* PolyPhen-2
* PredictSNP
* MutationTaster: official website
* Variant Effect Predictor from the Ensembl project
* SNPViz : This program provides a 3D representation of the protein affected, highlighting the amino acid change so doctors can determine pathogenicity of the mutant protein.
* PROVEAN
* PhyreRisk is a database which maps variants to experimental and predicted protein structures.
* Missense3D is a tool which provides a stereochemical report on the effect of missense variants on protein structure.

<doc id="513093" wikidata="Q624543" url="?curid=513093" title="Monoclinic crystal system">
<text>In crystallography, the monoclinic crystal system is one of the seven crystal systems. A crystal system is described by three vectors. In the monoclinic system, the crystal is described by vectors of unequal lengths, as in the orthorhombic system. They form a parallelogram prism. Hence two pairs of vectors are perpendicular (meet at right angles), while the third pair makes an angle other than 90°.

==Bravais lattices==
Two monoclinic Bravais lattices exist: the primitive monoclinic and the base-centered monoclinic.

For the base-centered monoclinic lattice, the primitive cell has the shape of an oblique rhombic prism; it can be constructed because the two-dimensional centered rectangular base layer can also be described with primitive rhombic axes. The length formula_1 of the primitive cell below equals formula_2 of the conventional cell above.

==Crystal classes==

The table below organizes the space groups of the monoclinic crystal system by crystal class. It lists the International Tables for Crystallography space group numbers, followed by the crystal class name, its point group in Schoenflies notation, Hermann–Mauguin (international) notation, orbifold notation, and Coxeter notation, type descriptors, mineral examples, and the notation for the space groups.

Sphenoidal is also called monoclinic hemimorphic, domatic is also called monoclinic hemihedral, and prismatic is also called monoclinic normal.

The three monoclinic hemimorphic space groups are as follows:
* a prism with a wallpaper group p2 cross-section
* ditto with screw axes instead of axes
* ditto with screw axes as well as axes, parallel, in between; in this case an additional translation vector is one half of a translation vector in the base plane plus one half of a perpendicular vector between the base planes.

The four monoclinic hemihedral space groups include
* those with pure reflection at the base of the prism and halfway
* those with glide planes instead of pure reflection planes; the glide is one half of a translation vector in the base plane
* those with both in between each other; in this case an additional translation vector is this glide plus one half of a perpendicular vector between the base planes.

== In two dimensions ==

The only monoclinic Bravais lattice in two dimensions is the oblique lattice.

<text>Curtis Lee &quot;Curt&quot; Brown Jr. (born March 11, 1956) is a former NASA astronaut and retired United States Air Force colonel.

==Background==
Colonel Brown was born March 11, 1956. He graduated from East Bladen High School in Elizabethtown, North Carolina in 1974 and received a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the United States Air Force Academy in 1978.

He is a member of the United States Air Force Association, the United States Air Force Academy Association of Graduates, and the Experimental Aircraft Association.

==Military service==
He was commissioned a Second Lieutenant at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1978, and completed Undergraduate Pilot Training at Laughlin Air Force Base in Del Rio, Texas. He graduated in July 1979 and was assigned to fly A-10 aircraft at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina, arriving there in January 1980 after completing A-10 training at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. In March 1982, he was reassigned to Davis-Monthan AFB as an instructor pilot in the A-10.

In January 1983, he attended USAF Fighter Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada and returned to Davis-Monthan AFB as an instructor in A-10 weapons and tactics. In June 1985, he attended USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Upon graduation in June 1986, Brown was assigned to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, where he served as a test pilot in the A-10 and F-16 aircraft until his selection for the astronaut program.

He has logged over 6,000 hours flight time in jet aircraft.

==NASA==
Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in June 1987, Brown completed a one-year training and evaluation program in August 1988, and is qualified for flight assignment as a pilot. Technical assignments have included: involvement in the upgrade of the Shuttle Mission Simulator (SMS), development of the Flight Data File (FDF), lead of the astronaut launch support team responsible for crew ingress/strap-in prior to launch and crew egress after landing; monitored the refurbishment of OV-102 and OV-103 during ground turnaround processing; lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM), Astronaut Office Lead of Shuttle Operations, and Deputy Director, Flight Crew Operations Directorate.

===Space flights===
A veteran of six space flights, Brown has logged over 1,383 hours in space. He was the pilot on STS-47 in 1992, STS-66 in 1994 and STS-77 in 1996, and was spacecraft commander on STS-85 in 1997, STS-95 in 1998, and STS-103 in 1999.

====STS-47====

Brown&#x27;s first spaceflight was STS-47 aboard the . The mission launched September 12, 1992 14:23 (UTC) and was an eight-day cooperative mission between the United States and Japan focused on life science and materials processing experiments in space. After completing 126 orbits of Earth, the mission ended with the &quot;Endeavour&quot; landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility in Florida, September 20, 1992 12:53 (UTC). Mission duration was 190 hours, 30 minutes, 23 seconds.

====STS-66====

For Brown&#x27;s second spaceflight, STS-66, he piloted the . The mission lifted off from Launch Complex 39B November 3, 1994 16:59 (UTC). was the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science 3 (ATLAS-3) mission. ATLAS-3 was part of an ongoing program to determine the Earth&#x27;s energy balance and atmospheric change over an 11-year solar cycle. Following 175 orbits of the Earth, the 11-day mission ended with the &quot;Atlantis&quot; landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, November 14, 1994 15:34 (UTC). Mission duration was 262 hours and 34 minutes.

====STS-77====

Brown served as pilot for the third time during STS-77 aboard the . Lift-off of the ten-day mission occurred May 19, 1996 10:30 (UTC). The crew performed a record number of rendezvous sequences (one with a SPARTAN satellite and three with a deployed Satellite Test Unit) and approximately 21 hours of formation flying in proximity of the satellites. During the flight the crew also conducted 12 materials processing, fluid dynamics, and biotechnology experiments in a Spacehab Module. STS-77 deployed and retrieved a SPARTAN satellite, which carried the Inflatable Antenna Experiment designed to test the concept of large, inflatable space structures. A small Satellite Test Unit was also deployed to test the concept of self-stabilization by using aerodynamic forces and magnetic damping. The mission was concluded in 160 Earth orbits, with a landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility May 29, 1996 11:10 (UTC) after traveling 4.1 million miles in 240 hours and 39 minutes.

====STS-85====

Brown&#x27;s first command and fourth spaceflight was STS-85 aboard the . The shuttle lifted off from Launch Complex 39A August 7, 1997 14:41 (UTC) on a 12-day mission during which the crew deployed and retrieved the CRISTA-SPAS payload, operated the Japanese Manipulator Flight Demonstration (MFD) robotic arm, studied changes in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and tested technology destined for use on the future International Space Station. The mission was accomplished in 189 Earth orbits, and concluded with a landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility August 19, 1997 11:08 (UTC) after traveling 4.7 million miles in 284 hours and 27 minutes.

====STS-95====

Brown flew in space for the fifth time during STS-95 as commander aboard the . Lifting off from Launch Complex 39B October 29, 1998 19:19 (UTC), STS-95 was a 9-day mission during which the crew supported a variety of research payloads including deployment of the Spartan solar-observing spacecraft, the Hubble Space Telescope Orbital Systems Test Platform, and investigations on space flight and the aging process. The mission was accomplished in 134 Earth orbits, touching down at the Shuttle Landing Facility November 7, 1998 17:04 (UTC) after traveling 3.6 million miles in 213 hours and 44 minutes. The mission was highly publicized for the return of 77-year-old Senator John Glenn&#x27;s return to space after 38 years. This flight made Brown the only astronaut besides Tom Stafford to have commanded a member of the Mercury 7 on a mission.

====STS-103====

Brown&#x27;s sixth and final spaceflight was STS-103 as commander aboard the . Lifting off from Launch Complex 39A December 20, 1999 00:50 (UTC), STS-103 was an 8-day mission during which the crew successfully installed new instruments and upgraded systems on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Enhancing HST scientific capabilities required three space walks. The STS-103 mission was accomplished in 120 Earth orbits, touching down at the Shuttle Landing Facility December 28, 1999 00:01 (UTC) after traveling 3.2 million miles in 191 hours and 11 minutes.

==Post-NASA career==
Brown left NASA in May 2000 and became an airline pilot for American Airlines and later Sun Country Airlines. He was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame in April 2013. He is currently the chairman of the board of the directors of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation.

<text>Chapeaugraphy, occasionally anglicised to chapography, is a novelty act and a busking trick in which a ring-shaped piece of felt is manipulated to look like various types of hats. It would often be performed as a quick-change act.

The act originated in 1618 with Parisian street performer Tabarin, the most famous of the charlatans who combined a French version of &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; with a quack medicine show. He described his felt hat as &quot;true raw material, indifferent to all forms&quot;.

In the 1870s another French comedian, , revived the act and managed 15 hat-twisting styles in his act. The act was first performed in England by the French magician Félicien Trewey, who performed a tribute act titled &quot;Tabarin, or Twenty-Five Heads under One Hat&quot;. An 1899 magazine recounts &quot;one or two smart English performers&quot; of that time, including Alfred Leslie.

Although rarely seen today, it was featured in an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1985, as performed by magician Harry Anderson.

Types of hat that can be created include the following:

*baseball cap
*American and British army hats from the Revolutionary War
*pirate&#x27;s hat
*naval captain&#x27;s hat
*Mickey Mouse ears
*Ushanka (a Russian fur hat)
*mortarboard (a graduation cap)
*Catholic nun&#x27;s headwear
*derby hat

==Notable chapeaugraphers==

*Tabarin, a French comedian, the creator of &quot;Le Chapeau de Tabarin&quot;.
*, another French comedian who revived the act.
*Félicien Trewey, who brought the art form renewed interest and a new name, Treweyism, around the world in the 19th century after seeing Monsieur Fusier

<doc id="513099" wikidata="Q4356076" url="?curid=513099" title="Bob Turley">
<text>Robert Lee Turley (September 19, 1930 – March 30, 2013), known as &quot;Bullet Bob&quot;, was an American professional baseball player and financial planner. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a pitcher from 1951 through 1963. After his retirement from baseball, he worked for Primerica Financial Services.

Turley made his MLB debut with the St. Louis Browns in 1951, and stayed with the team through their first season in Baltimore, when he appeared in his first MLB All-Star Game. After the 1954 season, he was traded to the New York Yankees. With the Yankees, Turley appeared in two more All-Star Games. He led the American League in wins in 1958, and won the Cy Young Award, World Series Most Valuable Player Award, and Hickok Belt that year. He finished his playing career with the Los Angeles Angels and Boston Red Sox in 1963, and then coached the Red Sox in 1964.

Turley began working in financial planning during the baseball offseason. In 1977, he cofounded with Arthur L. Williams Jr. the company that would become Primerica. He also invested in real estate, buying and selling 27 houses in Florida.

==Early life==
Turley was born in Troy, Illinois. He was raised in East St. Louis, Illinois. He attended East St. Louis Senior High School in East St. Louis, and played for the school&#x27;s baseball squad for three years. He was used as both a starter and reliever, becoming the staff&#x27;s ace pitcher by the end of his senior season, in 1948. Turley won the team&#x27;s sportsmanship award that year.

Bill DeWitt, the general manager of the St. Louis Browns, brought Turley to Sportsman&#x27;s Park for a tryout. Turley also attended a workout camp for the New York Yankees, held in Maryville, Illinois. The day after he graduated from high school in 1948, Turley signed with the Browns as an amateur free agent. He received a $600 signing bonus ($ in current dollar terms).

==Professional career==

===Minor leagues and St. Louis Browns / Baltimore Orioles===
Turley made his professional debut that year in Minor League Baseball with the Belleville Stags of the Class D Illinois State League, pitching to a 9–3 win–loss record. He was promoted to the Aberdeen Pheasants of the Class C Northern League in 1949, and led the league in wins with 23, and strikeouts with 205. He split the 1950 season with the Wichita Indians of the Class A Western League and the San Antonio Missions of the Class AA Texas League. Turley led Wichita in the Western League playoffs. In 1951, he played for San Antonio. He appeared in the Texas League&#x27;s All-Star Game, and was named the league&#x27;s most valuable player at the end of the season. He struck out 22 batters in one game for San Antonio.

Turley played his first game in the major leagues on September 29, 1951. He lost to the Chicago White Sox. He did not pitch again in 1951, and after the season ended, he enlisted with the United States Army for two years. Turley returned to the Browns in August 1953, and caught attention for his high strikeout rate. Turley remained with the team after they moved to Baltimore, Maryland, to become the Baltimore Orioles in 1954. He earned $9,000 ($ in current dollar terms) for the 1954 season. He pitched the first game at Memorial Stadium, striking out nine in a complete game. A power pitcher, Turley recorded many strikeouts, but did not have great control. For the 1954 season, he led the American League in strikeouts with 185, but also led the league with 181 walks. That year, he earned comparisons to fellow fireballer Bob Feller, and finished in third place in balloting for the Hickok Belt, given to the professional athlete of the year.

While playing for the Orioles, Turley obtained the nickname &quot;Bullet Bob&quot;. The magazine &quot;Look&quot; wrote a story about Turley, and wanted to measure the velocity of his fastball. They used a bullet timer from the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, which recorded a speed of by the time it reached home plate.

Casey Stengel, the manager of the New York Yankees, sought to acquire Turley. The Yankees needed younger starting pitchers, as their rotation fell off due to the ages of Allie Reynolds, Eddie Lopat, Johnny Sain, Tommy Byrne, and Jim Konstanty. In order to acquire the hitting the Orioles decided they needed to compete, they traded Turley to the Yankees after the 1954 season. The Yankees received Turley, Billy Hunter, Don Larsen, and players to be named later, while the Orioles acquired Harry Byrd, Jim McDonald, Willy Miranda, Hal Smith, Gus Triandos, Gene Woodling, and players to be named later. To complete the trade, the Yankees sent Bill Miller, Kal Segrist, Don Leppert, and Ted Del Guercio to the Orioles, and the Orioles sent Mike Blyzka, Darrell Johnson, Jim Fridley and Dick Kryhoski to the Yankees. Comprising 17 players, this trade remains the largest in MLB history.

===New York Yankees===
Turley played for the Yankees from 1955 to 1962. In the 1955 season, Turley won 17 games for the Yankees, and recorded 210 strikeouts, second to Herb Score (245). But, he also led the league in walks with 177. The Yankees won the American League pennant, and advanced to the 1955 World Series, where they faced the Brooklyn Dodgers. He pitched in Game Three of the 1955 World Series, losing to Johnny Podres. He also made two relief appearances in the series, in Games Five and Seven, as the Dodgers defeated the Yankees four games to three.

Turley had a disappointing season in 1956, with an 8–4 win–loss record and a 5.05 earned run average (ERA). However, the Yankees again won the American League pennant. Turley appeared in Games One and Two of the 1956 World Series against the Dodgers as a relief pitcher. Facing Clem Labine in Game Six, Turley pitched a complete game, but the Yankees lost the game by a 1–0 score. The Yankees defeated the Dodgers in Game Seven to win the series four games to three.
In the 1957 season, Turley developed a curveball. He finished the season with a 2.71 ERA, good for fourth-best in the American League. The Yankees won the pennant again. In the 1957 World Series against the Milwaukee Braves, Turley started Game Three, but was relieved by Larsen in the second inning. He won his first World Series game in Game Six, a complete game. The Yankees lost the series to the Braves, four games to three.

Fellow pitcher Sal Maglie wrote during 1958 spring training that Turley &quot;ha[d] started to step off the mound when things get a little shaky, take a couple of deep breaths and then go back to work.&quot; Maglie thought this helped with Turley&#x27;s self-control, a characteristic Maglie considered one of the three most essential to a successful pitcher.

By the 1958 season, Turley changed his delivery in an effort to improve his control, by using a no-wind up pitching position. His best season came in 1958, when he won 21 games and lost seven, for an American League-leading .750 winning percentage. He also led the American League with 19 complete games, and finished with the sixth-best ERA (2.97). However, his 128 walks also led the league. Turley started Game Two of the 1958 World Series by allowing up a leadoff home run and lasting just one-third of an inning as the Yankees fell behind the Milwaukee Braves two games to none. With the Yankees one game away from elimination, Turley threw a complete-game shutout in Game Five. He then recorded a 10th-inning save in Game Six. A day later, in Game Seven, he relieved Don Larsen in the third inning and won his second game in three days, with innings of two-hit relief. The Yankees became just the second team to recover from a 3–1 World Series deficit, and Turley was voted the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. As a result of his 1958 season, Turley won the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year, receiving twice as many votes as Jim Brown, the second-place finisher. He also won the Cy Young Award as the best pitcher in Major League Baseball, edging Warren Spahn of the Braves by one vote, and Lew Burdette of the Braves and Bob Friend of the Pittsburgh Pirates by two votes. Turley finished second in the American League Most Valuable Player Award voting, losing to Jackie Jensen of the Boston Red Sox. Additionally, he won &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ Player of the Year and Pitcher of the Year Awards.

Turley earned a $35,000 salary for the 1959 season, his highest as a baseball player. The Yankees chose Turley to be their Opening Day starting pitcher for the 1959 season, opposing Tom Brewer of the Red Sox. The Yankees won the game by a 3–2 score. However, Turley&#x27;s fastball began to lose its effectiveness. He increased the usage of his curveball to compensate. Turley finished the year with an 8–11 win–loss record. In the 1960 season, Turley had a 9–3 win–loss record, and his 3.27 ERA was the seventh best in the American League. He started Game Two of the 1960 World Series against the Pirates, earning the win. He also started the deciding Game Seven, which the Pirates won, taking the series.

Turley suffered through discomfort in his right elbow during the 1961 season, which resulted in a 3–5 win–loss record and 5.75 ERA in only 15 games pitched. New manager Ralph Houk began to emphasize his younger pitchers, as he removed Turley from the starting rotation and used him as a relief pitcher. Though the Yankees reached the 1961 World Series, and defeated the Cincinnati Reds four games to one, Turley did not make an appearance. After seeking medical attention, Turley was diagnosed with bone chips in his elbow. He underwent surgery in the offseason to remove the bone chips, and returned to the Yankees confident his performance would improve in 1962. He agreed to a salary cut, from $28,000 to $25,000. However, the bone chips recurred during the 1962 season. As a result, his effectiveness was limited in 1962 as well. On June 25, Turley started a game that lasted 22 innings, and a record seven hours, but was removed after recording only one out. During the 1962 season, American League players elected Turley as their player representative, following Woodling&#x27;s trade to the National League. Over the season, Turley pitched to a 4.57 ERA in only 69 innings. The Yankees defeated the San Francisco Giants four games to three in the 1962 World Series, but Turley was not an active participant.

===Los Angeles Angels, Boston Red Sox, and coaching===
After the 1962 season, the Yankees sold Turley to the Los Angeles Angels for cash, in the first move made by new Yankees&#x27; general manager Roy Hamey, who sought to rebuild the Yankees pitching staff. The move was conditional; the Angels could return Turley if they were not satisfied with him. The Angels chose to retain Turley at the start of the 1963 season. Turley struggled, winning two games while losing seven, and the Angels released him in July. A week later, he signed with the Boston Red Sox. Turley retired after the 1963 season, with a 101–85 win–loss record and a 3.64 ERA in 12 seasons.

After the 1963 season, Turley agreed to remain with the Red Sox as their pitching coach, succeeding Harry Dorish. Turley spent one season as the Red Sox&#x27; pitching coach, and was released at the end of the year. He attempted to make a comeback as a pitcher with the Houston Colt .45s in 1965, but did not make the team. He then agreed to become the pitching coach for the Richmond Braves of the International League, a minor league team in the Atlanta Braves organization, in 1966, but resigned before the start of the 1966 season.

===Sign stealing===
Turley got into the habit while on the bench of stealing signs when he saw the opposing pitcher throw. Using a system of whistling where be whistled if the next pitch was different from the last, he would attempt to help any Yankee who wanted the advice, with Johnny Blanchard and Elston Howard being appreciative of the help while Moose Skowron and Yogi Berra did not care. In one instance, Jim Bunning of the Detroit Tigers noticed the system and pointed to Turley to stop or he would knock down the batter (which happened to be Mickey Mantle). When Turley whistled anyway, he threw a missile in the middle of the box that Mantle missed on, which led to the next batter in Berra pleading that he wasn&#x27;t listening to whistles. In 1961, even when he was on the injured list, he remained on the bench to do his system, and Tony Kubek estimated that Mickey Mantle his fifty homeruns in part due to Turley, and Mantle once credited half of his home runs to Turley. Roger Maris and his historic 61st home run was hit after the sign for the pitch was decoded by the third base coach, an acolyte of Turley&#x27;s system.

==Personal life==
Turley moved from East St. Louis to Lutherville, Maryland, in 1954, when the Browns moved to Baltimore. Though he played in Baltimore for one season, he remained in Lutherville for the remainder of his baseball career, and sent his children to the local public schools.
Turley began working as a financial planner in 1957, by selling life insurance. He also operated a bowling alley in Bel Air, Maryland, and an insurance firm in Baltimore. In 1977, Turley joined with Arthur L. Williams Jr. and five others to found A. L. Williams &amp; Associates, an insurance company. At A. L. Williams, agents advised clients to purchase term life insurance, rather than cash value life insurance, and invest the money they saved in mutual funds. The company became Primerica Financial Services, and was later bought out by Citigroup in 1989. He retired from the business in 2001, and sold half of his business to his son and the other half to Lynn Webb, a senior national sales director.

Later in his life, Turley resided in Blue Ridge, Georgia, and had a winter home on Marco Island, Florida. Turley&#x27;s hobby was real estate. He bought and sold many homes on Marco Island, including a home he built that was locally referred to as &quot;Turley Mansion&quot; and &quot;Turley Castle&quot;. In total, Turley and his wife bought and sold 27 houses on Marco Island and in Naples, Florida.

Turley made an appearance on &quot;It&#x27;s News to Me&quot;, a current events-based game show hosted by Walter Cronkite. He was mentioned in a song called &quot;St. Louis Browns&quot; by Skip Battin, who was the bass guitarist of The Byrds and the New Riders of the Purple Sage. In the lyrics, Battin describes Turley as a &quot;no-hit pitcher&quot; who &quot;got too surly&quot; and who was &quot;traded...too early&quot;.

Turley&#x27;s uncle, Ralph, also played professional baseball. The Yankees signed Ralph Turley in 1949 when they meant to sign Bob, and released Ralph when they discovered he was the &quot;wrong Turley&quot;. Nik Turley, a Yankees prospect, identified Bob Turley as a &quot;distant relative&quot;.

===Death===
Turley lived in Alpharetta, Georgia, for the last two years of his life. He died on March 30, 2013, in hospice care at Lenbrook, a retirement community in Atlanta at age 82 from liver cancer. Turley was cremated in Duluth, Georgia.

<text>The Uruguay Round was the 8th round of multilateral trade negotiations (MTN) conducted within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), spanning from 1986 to 1993 and embracing 123 countries as &quot;contracting parties&quot;. The Round led to the creation of the World Trade Organization, with GATT remaining as an integral part of the WTO agreements. The broad mandate of the Round had been to extend GATT trade rules to areas previously exempted as too difficult to liberalize (agriculture, textiles) and increasingly important new areas previously not included (trade in services, intellectual property, investment policy trade distortions). The Round came into effect in 1995 with deadlines ending in 2000 (2004 in the case of developing country contracting parties) under the administrative direction of the newly created World Trade Organization (WTO).

The Doha Development Round was the next trade round, beginning in 2001 and still unresolved after missing its official deadline of 2005.

== Goals ==
The main objectives of the Uruguay Round were:
*to reduce agricultural subsidies
*to lift restrictions on foreign investment
*to begin the process of opening trade in services like banking and insurance.
*to include the protection of intellectual property

They also wanted to draft a code to deal with copyright violation and other forms of intellectual property rights.

==History==
A set of updated documents was produced in Geneva by the office of the Director-General during July 1986 in order to prepare the way for progress to be made. As described below, the round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay in September 1986, followed by negotiations in Geneva, Brussels, Washington, D.C., and Tokyo.

===Background===

The 1986 Ministerial Declaration identified problems including structural deficiencies, spill-over impacts of certain countries&#x27; policies on world trade GATT could not manage. To address these issues, the eighth GATT round (known as the Uruguay Round) was launched in September 1986, in Punta del Este, Uruguay. It was the biggest negotiating mandate on trade ever agreed: the talks were going to extend the trading system into several new areas, notably trade in services and intellectual property, and to reform trade in the sensitive sectors of agriculture and textiles; all the original GATT articles were up for review.

The round was supposed to end in December 1990, but the US and EU disagreed on how to reform agricultural trade and decided to extend the talks. Finally, in November 1992, the US and EU settled most of their differences in a deal known informally as &quot;the Blair House accord&quot;, and on 15 April 1994, the deal was signed by ministers from most of the 123 participating governments at a meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco. The agreement established the World Trade Organization, which came into being upon its entry into force on 1 January 1995, to replace the GATT system. It is widely regarded as the most profound institutional reform of the world trading system since the GATT&#x27;s establishment.

The position of Developing Countries (GATT) was detailed in the book: &quot;Brazil in the Uruguay Round of the GATT: The Evolution of Brazil’s Position in the Uruguay Round, with Emphasis on the Issue of Services&quot;. In this book, the polemics about the issue of services are described, as well as the opposition of Developing Countries to the so called &quot;New Issues&quot;.

===Conclusion and signature===
The 20 agreements were signed in Marrakesh—the Marrakesh Agreement—in April 1994.

==Achievements==
The GATT still exists as the WTO&#x27;s umbrella treaty for trade in goods, updated as a result of the Uruguay Round negotiations (a distinction is made between GATT 1994, the updated parts of GATT, and GATT 1947, the original agreement which is still the heart of GATT 1994). The GATT 1994 is not, however, the only legally binding agreement included in the Final Act; a long list of about 60 agreements, annexes, decisions and understandings was adopted. In fact, the agreements fall into a simple structure with six main parts:
*an umbrella agreement (the Agreement Establishing the WTO);
*goods and investment (the Multilateral Agreements on Trade in Goods including the GATT 1994 and the Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMS));
*services (General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS));
*intellectual property (Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS));
*dispute settlement (DSU);
*reviews of governments&#x27; trade policies (TPRM).

The agreements for the two largest areas under the WTO, goods and services, share a three-part outline:
*broad principles (such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and General Agreement on Trade in Services);
*extra agreements and annexes;
*lengthy schedules (lists) of commitments made by individual countries.

One of the achievements of the Uruguay round would be the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, administered by the WTO, which brings agricultural trade more fully under the GATT. Prior to the Uruguay Round, conditions for agricultural trade were deteriorating with increasing use of subsidies, build-up of stocks, declining world prices and escalating costs of support. It provides for converting quantitative restrictions to tariffs and for a phased reduction of tariffs. The agreement also imposes rules and disciplines on agricultural export subsidies, domestic subsidies, and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures through the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures.

== Criticism ==
Groups such as Oxfam have criticized the Uruguay Round for paying insufficient attention to the needs of developing countries. One aspect of this criticism is that figures very close to rich country industries—such as former Cargill executive Dan Amstutz—had a major role in the drafting of Uruguay Round language on agriculture and other matters. As with the WTO in general, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Health Gap and Global Trade Watch also criticize what was negotiated in the Round on intellectual property and industrial tariffs as setting up too many constraints on policy-making and human needs. An article asserts that the developing countries’ lack of experience in WTO negotiations and lack of knowledge of how the developing economies would be affected by what the industrial countries wanted in the WTO new areas; the intensified mercantilist attitude of the GATT/WTO’s major power, the US; the structure of the WTO that made the GATT tradition of decision by consensus ineffective, so that a country would not preserve the status quo, were the reasons for this imbalance.

<text>A news magazine is a typed, printed, and published magazine, radio, or television program, usually published weekly, consisting of articles about current events. News magazines generally discuss stories in greater depth than newspapers or newscasts do, and aim to give the consumer an understanding of the important events beyond the basic facts.

==Broadcast news magazines==
Radio news magazines are similar to television news magazines. Unlike radio newscasts, which are typically about five minutes in length, radio news magazines can run from 30 minutes to three hours or more.

Television news magazines provide a similar service to print news magazines, but their stories are presented as short television documentaries rather than written articles; in contrast to a daily newscast, news magazines allow more in-depth coverage of specific topics, including current affairs, investigative journalism (including hidden camera investigations), major interviews, and human-interest stories. The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; was one of the earliest examples, premiering in 1953. In Canada, CTV premiered &quot;W5&quot; in 1966, running for 58 seasons before being cancelled in 2024 due to budget cuts by its parent company (and being repurposed as a brand for long-form journalism across other CTV News programming and platforms). It was the longest-running program of its kind in North America. 

In the United States, the Big Three networks all currently produce at least one weekly news magazine, including ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot;, CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dateline&quot;; the current formats of &quot;20/20&quot; and &quot;Dateline&quot; focus predominantly on true crime stories.&quot;&quot; News magazines proliferated on network schedules in the early 1990s, as they had lower production costs in comparison to scripted programs, and could attract equivalent if not larger audiences. At the same time, newer newsmagazines—as well as syndicated offerings such as &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, &quot;Hard Copy&quot; and &quot;Inside Edition&quot;—often had a larger focus on tabloid stories (including celebrities such as Michael Jackson, and the O.J. Simpson and Menendez brothers murder cases) rather than the harder journalism associated with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;20/20&quot; at the time. CNN president Ed Turner argued that these shows had eclipsed the networks&#x27; evening newscasts as their flagship programs at the expense of their news divisions&#x27; traditions of hard journalism.&quot;&quot; 

By the late-1990s, &quot;Dateline&quot; would establish a niche in true crime to set it apart from its competitors—a format that would bolster its popularity, and lead the show to being on as many as five times per-week at its peak.&quot;&quot; Most of these magazines and their frequent airings would fall out of favor by the 2000s, being largely displaced by the emerging genre of reality television.&quot;&quot; NBC experimented with other news magazines in the 2010s, including &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot;—a more hard news-oriented program that aired for two seasons, and &quot;Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly&quot;—a short-lived primetime vehicle for the former Fox News correspondent.

Some local television stations in the U.S. have produced news magazines, although they have largely been displaced by cheaper programming acquired from the syndication market. An exception is WCVB-TV in Boston, which has continued to produce the nightly news magazine &quot;Chronicle&quot; since 1982.

In Brazil, TV Globo&#x27;s news magazine &quot;Fantástico&quot; has aired on Sunday nights. Historically, it has been one of the top programs on Brazilian television, although its dominance is no longer as absolute as it was in the past due to competition from variety shows such as SBT&#x27;s &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot;, and from Record&#x27;s competing news magazine &quot;Domingo Espetacular.&quot;

<doc id="513117" wikidata="Q1462591" url="?curid=513117" title="Taxicab number">
<text>In mathematics, the &quot;n&quot;th taxicab number, typically denoted Ta(&quot;n&quot;) or Taxicab(&quot;n&quot;), is defined as the smallest integer that can be expressed as a sum of two &quot;positive&quot; integer cubes in &quot;n&quot; distinct ways. The most famous taxicab number is 1729 = Ta(2) = 13 + 123 = 93 + 103, also known as the Hardy-Ramanujan number.

The name is derived from a conversation involving mathematicians G. H. Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan. As told by Hardy:

==History and definition==
The pairs of summands of the Hardy–Ramanujan number Ta(2) = 1729 were first mentioned by Bernard Frénicle de Bessy, who published his observation in 1657. 1729 was made famous as the first taxicab number in the early 20th century by a story involving Srinivasa Ramanujan in claiming it to be the smallest for his particular example of two summands. In 1938, G. H. Hardy and E. M. Wright proved that such numbers exist for all positive integers &quot;n&quot;, and their proof is easily converted into a program to generate such numbers. However, the proof makes no claims at all about whether the thus-generated numbers are &quot;the smallest possible&quot; and so it cannot be used to find the actual value of Ta(&quot;n&quot;).

The taxicab numbers subsequent to 1729 were found with the help of computers. John Leech obtained Ta(3) in 1957. E. Rosenstiel, J. A. Dardis and C. R. Rosenstiel found Ta(4) in 1989. J. A. Dardis found Ta(5) in 1994 and it was confirmed by David W. Wilson in 1999. Ta(6) was announced by Uwe Hollerbach on the NMBRTHRY mailing list on March 9, 2008, following a 2003 paper by Calude et al. that gave a 99% probability that the number was actually Ta(6). Upper bounds for Ta(7) to Ta(12) were found by Christian Boyer in 2006.

The restriction of the summands to positive numbers is necessary, because allowing negative numbers allows for more (and smaller) instances of numbers that can be expressed as sums of cubes in &quot;n&quot; distinct ways. The concept of a cabtaxi number has been introduced to allow for alternative, less restrictive definitions of this nature. In a sense, the specification of two summands and powers of three is also restrictive; a generalized taxicab number allows for these values to be other than two and three, respectively.

==Known taxicab numbers==
So far, the following 6 taxicab numbers are known:

formula_1

==Upper bounds for taxicab numbers==
For the following taxicab numbers upper bounds are known:

formula_2

==Cubefree taxicab numbers==
A more restrictive taxicab problem requires that the taxicab number be cubefree, which means that it is not divisible by any cube other than 13. When a cubefree taxicab number is written as , the numbers and must be relatively prime. Among the taxicab numbers listed above, only and are cubefree taxicab numbers. The smallest cubefree taxicab number with three representations was discovered by Paul Vojta (unpublished) in 1981 while he was a graduate student:

formula_3

The smallest cubefree taxicab number with four representations was discovered by Stuart Gascoigne and independently by Duncan Moore in 2003:

<text>In optics, the Airy disk (or Airy disc) and Airy pattern are descriptions of the best-focused spot of light that a perfect lens with a circular aperture can make, limited by the diffraction of light. The Airy disk is of importance in physics, optics, and astronomy.

The diffraction pattern resulting from a uniformly illuminated, circular aperture has a bright central region, known as the Airy disk, which together with the series of concentric rings around is called the Airy pattern. Both are named after George Biddell Airy. The disk and rings phenomenon had been known prior to Airy; John Herschel described the appearance of a bright star seen through a telescope under high magnification for an 1828 article on light for the &quot;Encyclopedia Metropolitana&quot;:
Airy wrote the first full theoretical treatment explaining the phenomenon (his 1835 &quot;On the Diffraction of an Object-glass with Circular Aperture&quot;).

Mathematically, the diffraction pattern is characterized by the wavelength of light illuminating the circular aperture, and the aperture&#x27;s size. The &quot;appearance&quot; of the diffraction pattern is additionally characterized by the sensitivity of the eye or other detector used to observe the pattern.

The most important application of this concept is in cameras, microscopes and telescopes. Due to diffraction, the smallest point to which a lens or mirror can focus a beam of light is the size of the Airy disk. Even if one were able to make a perfect lens, there is still a limit to the resolution of an image created by such a lens. An optical system in which the resolution is no longer limited by imperfections in the lenses but only by diffraction is said to be diffraction limited.

==Size==
Far from the aperture, the angle at which the first minimum occurs, measured from the direction of incoming light, is given by the approximate formula:

formula_1

or, for small angles, simply

formula_2

where formula_3 is in radians, formula_4 is the wavelength of the light in meters, and formula_5 is the diameter of the aperture in meters. The full width at half maximum is given by formula_6

Airy wrote this relation as

formula_7

where formula_8 was the angle of first minimum in seconds of arc, formula_9 was the radius of the aperture in inches, and the wavelength of light was assumed to be 0.000022 inches (560 nm; the mean of visible wavelengths). This is equal to the angular resolution of a circular aperture. The Rayleigh criterion for barely resolving two objects that are point sources of light, such as stars seen through a telescope, is that the center of the Airy disk for the first object occurs at the first minimum of the Airy disk of the second. This means that the angular resolution of a diffraction-limited system is given by the same formulae.

However, while the angle at which the first minimum occurs (which is sometimes described as the radius of the Airy disk) depends only on wavelength and aperture size, the appearance of the diffraction pattern will vary with the intensity (brightness) of the light source. Because any detector (eye, film, digital) used to observe the diffraction pattern can have an intensity threshold for detection, the full diffraction pattern may not be apparent. In astronomy, the outer rings are frequently not apparent even in a highly magnified image of a star. It may be that none of the rings are apparent, in which case the star image appears as a disk (central maximum only) rather than as a full diffraction pattern. Furthermore, fainter stars will appear as smaller disks than brighter stars, because less of their central maximum reaches the threshold of detection. While in theory all stars or other &quot;point sources&quot; of a given wavelength and seen through a given aperture have the same Airy disk radius characterized by the above equation (and the same diffraction pattern size), differing only in intensity, the appearance is that fainter sources appear as smaller disks, and brighter sources appear as larger disks. This was described by Airy in his original work:

The rapid decrease of light in the successive rings will sufficiently explain the visibility of two or three rings with a very bright star and the non-visibility of rings with a faint star. The difference of the diameters of the central spots (or spurious disks) of different stars ... is also fully explained. Thus the radius of the spurious disk of a faint star, where light of less than half the intensity of the central light makes no impression on the eye, is determined by [&quot;s&quot; = 1.17/&quot;a&quot;], whereas the radius of the spurious disk of a bright star, where light of 1/10 the intensity of the central light is sensible, is determined by [&quot;s&quot; = 1.97/&quot;a&quot;].

Despite this feature of Airy&#x27;s work, the radius of the Airy disk is often given as being simply the angle of first minimum, even in standard textbooks. In reality, the angle of first minimum is a limiting value for the size of the Airy disk, and not a definite radius.

==Examples==
===Cameras===
If two objects imaged by a camera are separated by an angle small enough that their Airy disks on the camera detector start overlapping, the objects cannot be clearly separated any more in the image, and they start blurring together. Two objects are said to be &quot;just resolved&quot; when the maximum of the first Airy pattern falls on top of the first minimum of the second Airy pattern (the Rayleigh criterion).

Therefore, the smallest angular separation two objects can have before they significantly blur together is given as stated above by
formula_10

Thus, the ability of the system to resolve detail is limited by the ratio of λ/&quot;d&quot;. The larger the aperture for a given wavelength, the finer the detail that can be distinguished in the image.

This can also be expressed as
formula_11
where formula_12 is the separation of the images of the two objects on the film, and formula_13 is the distance from the lens to the film.
If we take the distance from the lens to the film to be approximately equal to the focal length of the lens, we find
formula_14
but formula_15 is the f-number of a lens. A typical setting for use on an overcast day would be (see Sunny 16 rule). For violet, the shortest wavelength visible light, the wavelength λ is about 420 nanometers (see cone cells for sensitivity of S cone cells). This gives a value for formula_12 of about 4 μm. In a digital camera, making the pixels of the image sensor smaller than half this value (one pixel for each object, one for each space between) would not significantly increase the captured image resolution. However, it may improve the final image by over-sampling, allowing noise reduction.

===The human eye===

The fastest f-number for the human eye is about 2.1, corresponding to a diffraction-limited point spread function with approximately 1 μm diameter. However, at this f-number, spherical aberration limits visual acuity, while a 3 mm pupil diameter (f/5.7) approximates the resolution achieved by the human eye. The maximum density of cones in the human fovea is approximately 170,000 per square millimeter, which implies that the cone spacing in the human eye is about 2.5 μm, approximately the diameter of the point spread function at f/5.

===Focused laser beam===
A circular laser beam with uniform intensity across the circle (a flat-top beam) focused by a lens will form an Airy disk pattern at the focus. The size of the Airy disk determines the laser intensity at the focus.

===Aiming sight===
Some weapon aiming sights (e.g. FN FNC) require the user to align a peep sight (rear, nearby sight, i.e. which will be out of focus) with a tip (which should be focused and overlaid on the target) at the end of the barrel. When looking through the peep sight, the user will notice an Airy disk that will help center the sight over the pin.

==Conditions for observation==

Light from a uniformly illuminated circular aperture (or from a uniform, flattop beam) will exhibit an Airy diffraction pattern far away from the aperture due to Fraunhofer diffraction (far-field diffraction).

The conditions for being in the far field and exhibiting an Airy pattern are: the incoming light illuminating the aperture is a plane wave (no phase variation across the aperture), the intensity is constant over the area of the aperture, and the distance formula_17 from the aperture where the diffracted light is observed (the screen distance) is large compared to the aperture size, and the radius formula_18 of the aperture is not too much larger than the wavelength formula_4 of the light. The last two conditions can be formally written as formula_20

In practice, the conditions for uniform illumination can be met by placing the source of the illumination far from the aperture. If the conditions for far field are not met (for example if the aperture is large), the far-field Airy diffraction pattern can also be obtained on a screen much closer to the aperture by using a lens right after the aperture (or the lens itself can form the aperture). The Airy pattern will then be formed at the focus of the lens rather than at infinity.

Hence, the focal spot of a uniform circular laser beam (a flattop beam) focused by a lens will also be an Airy pattern.

In a camera or imaging system an object far away gets imaged onto the film or detector plane by the objective lens, and the far field diffraction pattern is observed at the detector. The resulting image is a convolution of the ideal image with the Airy diffraction pattern due to diffraction from the iris aperture or due to the finite size of the lens. This leads to the finite resolution of a lens system described above.

==Mathematical formulation==


The intensity of the Airy pattern follows the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, given by the squared modulus of the Fourier transform of the circular aperture:

formula_21

where formula_22 is the maximum intensity of the pattern at the Airy disc center, formula_23 is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one, formula_24 is the wavenumber, formula_18 is the radius of the aperture, and formula_3 is the angle of observation, i.e. the angle between the axis of the circular aperture and the line between aperture center and observation point. formula_27 where &quot;q&quot; is the radial distance from the observation point to the optical axis and &quot;R&quot; is its distance to the aperture. Note that the Airy disk as given by the above expression is only valid for large &quot;R&quot;, where Fraunhofer diffraction applies; calculation of the shadow in the near-field must rather be handled using Fresnel diffraction.

However the exact Airy pattern &quot;does&quot; appear at a finite distance if a lens is placed at the aperture. Then the Airy pattern will be perfectly focussed at the distance given by the lens&#x27;s focal length (assuming collimated light incident on the aperture) given by the above equations.

The zeros of formula_28 are at formula_29 From this, it follows that the first dark ring in the diffraction pattern occurs where formula_30 or

formula_31

If a lens is used to focus the Airy pattern at a finite distance, then the radius formula_32 of the first dark ring on the focal plane is solely given by the numerical aperture &quot;A&quot; (closely related to the f-number) by
formula_33

where the numerical aperture &quot;A&quot; is equal to the aperture&#x27;s radius &quot;d&quot;/2 divided by R&#x27;, the distance from the center of the Airy pattern to the &quot;edge&quot; of the aperture. Viewing the aperture of radius &quot;d&quot;/2 and lens as a camera (see diagram above) projecting an image onto a focal plane at distance &quot;f&quot;, the numerical aperture &quot;A&quot; is related to the commonly-cited f-number &quot;N= f/d&quot; (ratio of the focal length to the lens diameter) according to

formula_34

for &quot;N&quot;≫1 it is simply approximated as formula_35 This shows that the best possible image resolution of a camera is limited by the numerical aperture (and thus f-number) of its lens due to diffraction.

The half maximum of the central Airy disk (where formula_36) occurs at formula_37 the 1/e2 point (where formula_38) occurs at formula_39 and the maximum of the first ring occurs at formula_40

The intensity formula_22 at the center of the diffraction pattern is related to the total power formula_42 incident on the aperture by

formula_43

where formula_44 is the source strength per unit area at the aperture, A is the area of the aperture (formula_45) and R is the distance from the aperture. At the focal plane of a lens, formula_46 The intensity at the maximum of the first ring is about 1.75% of the intensity at the center of the Airy disk.

The expression for formula_47 above can be integrated to give the total power contained in the diffraction pattern within a circle of given size:

formula_48

where formula_49 and formula_23 are Bessel functions. Hence the fractions of the total power contained within the first, second, and third dark rings (where formula_51) are 83.8%, 91.0%, and 93.8% respectively.

Classical treatments of the Airy disk and diffraction pattern assume that the incident light is a plane wave that consists of coherent (in phase) photons of the same wavelength that interfere with each other. The famous double slit experiment showed that diffraction patterns could arise even when the coherent photons were so spread out in time that they could not interfere with each other. This led to the quantum mechanical picture that each photon effectively takes all possible paths from a source to a detector. Richard Feynman explained that each path has a complex amplitude that can be thought of as a unit vector that is perpendicular to the path and makes one complete rotation for each wavelength of advance. The detection probability is the square of the modulus of the sum of the complex amplitudes at the detector. Diffraction patterns arise because the paths sum differently at different detector positions. According to these principles the Airy disk and diffraction pattern can be computed numerically by using Feynman photon path integrals to determine the detection probability at different points in the focal plane of a parabolic mirror.

==Approximation using a Gaussian profile==

The Airy pattern falls rather slowly to zero with increasing distance from the center, with the outer rings containing a significant portion of the integrated intensity of the pattern. As a result, the root mean square (RMS) spotsize is undefined (i.e. infinite). An alternative measure of the spot size is to ignore the relatively small outer rings of the Airy pattern and to approximate the central lobe with a Gaussian profile, such that

formula_52

where formula_53 is the irradiance at the center of the pattern, formula_54 represents the radial distance from the center of the pattern, and formula_55 is the Gaussian RMS width (in one dimension). If we equate the peak amplitude of the Airy pattern and Gaussian profile, that is, formula_56 and find the value of formula_55 giving the optimal approximation to the pattern, we obtain

:formula_58

where &quot;N&quot; is the f-number. If, on the other hand, we wish to enforce that the Gaussian profile has the same volume as does the Airy pattern, then this becomes

:formula_59

In optical aberration theory, it is common to describe an imaging system as &quot;diffraction-limited&quot; if the Airy disk radius is larger than the RMS spotsize determined from geometric ray tracing (see Optical lens design). The Gaussian profile approximation provides an alternative means of comparison: using the approximation above shows that the Gaussian waist formula_55 of the Gaussian approximation to the Airy disk is about two-third the Airy disk radius, i.e. formula_61 as opposed to formula_62

==Obscured Airy pattern==
Similar equations can also be derived for the obscured Airy diffraction pattern which is the diffraction pattern from an annular aperture or beam, i.e. a uniform circular aperture (beam) obscured by a circular block at the center. This situation is relevant to many common reflector telescope designs that incorporate a secondary mirror, including Newtonian telescopes and Schmidt–Cassegrain telescopes.

formula_63

where formula_64 is the annular aperture obscuration ratio, or the ratio of the diameter of the obscuring disk and the diameter of the aperture (beam). formula_65 and x is defined as above: formula_66 where formula_17 is the radial distance in the focal plane from the optical axis, formula_4 is the wavelength and formula_69 is the f-number of the system. The fractional encircled energy (the fraction of the total energy contained within a circle of radius formula_17 centered at the optical axis in the focal plane) is then given by:

formula_71

For formula_72 the formulas reduce to the unobscured versions above.

The practical effect of having a central obstruction in a telescope is that the central disc becomes slightly smaller, and the first bright ring becomes brighter at the expense of the central disc. This becomes more problematic with short focal length telescopes which require larger secondary mirrors.

==Comparison to Gaussian beam focus==
A circular laser beam with uniform intensity profile, focused by a lens, will form an Airy pattern at the focal plane of the lens. The intensity at the center of the focus will be formula_73 where formula_42 is the total power of the beam, formula_75 is the area of the beam (formula_76 is the beam diameter), formula_4 is the wavelength, and formula_13 is the focal length of the lens.

A Gaussian beam transmitted through a hard aperture will be clipped. Energy is lost and edge diffraction occurs, effectively increasing the divergence. Because of these effects there is a Gaussian beam diameter which maximizes the intensity in the far field. This occurs when the formula_79 diameter of the Gaussian is 89% of the aperture diameter, and the on axis intensity in the far field will be 81% of that produced by a uniform intensity profile.

==Elliptical aperture==
The Fourier integral of the circular cross section of radius formula_18 is

This is the special case of the Fourier integral of the elliptical cross section
with half axes formula_18 and formula_83:

<text>The Yeniseian languages ( ; sometimes known as Yeniseic, Yeniseyan, or Yenisei-Ostyak; occasionally spelled with -ss-) are a family of languages that are spoken by the Yeniseian people in the Yenisei River region of central Siberia. As part of the proposed Dené–Yeniseian language family, the Yeniseian languages have been argued to be part of &quot;the first demonstration of a genealogical link between Old World and New World language families that meets the standards of traditional comparative-historical linguistics&quot;. The only surviving language of the group today is Ket.

From hydronymic and genetic data, it is suggested that the Yeniseian languages were spoken in a much greater area in ancient times, including parts of northern China and Mongolia. It has been further proposed that the recorded distribution of Yeniseian languages from the 17th century onward represents a relatively recent northward migration, and that the Yeniseian urheimat lies to the south of Lake Baikal.

The Yeniseians have been connected to the Xiongnu confederation, whose ruling elite may have spoken a &quot;southern Yeniseian&quot; language similar to the now extinct Pumpokol language. The Jie, who ruled the Later Zhao state of northern China, are likewise believed to have spoken a Pumpokolic language based on linguistic and ethnogeographic data.

For those who argue the Xiongnu spoke a Yeniseian language, the Yeniseian languages are thought to have contributed many ubiquitous loanwords to Turkic and Mongolic vocabulary, such as &quot;Khan&quot;, &quot;Tarqan&quot;, and the word for &#x27;god&#x27;, &quot;Tengri&quot;. This conclusion has primarily been drawn from the analysis of preserved Xiongnu texts in the form of Chinese characters.

==Classification==
The classification of the Yeniseian languages has changed from time to time. A traditional classification is presented below: 
*Proto-Yeniseian (before 500 BC; split around 1 AD)
** Northern Yeniseian (split around 700 AD)
*** Ket (&gt;200 speakers as of 2007)
****&quot;Northern Ket&quot;
****&quot;Central Ket&quot;
****&quot;Southern Ket&quot;
*** Yugh (extinct 1970s)
** Southern Yeniseian 
*** Kott–Assan (split around 1200 AD)
**** Kott (extinct by the mid-1800s)
**** Assan (extinct by 1800)
**** Yastin 
**** Yarin 
****Baikot 
*** Arin–Pumpokol (split around 550 AD)
**** Arin (extinct by 1800)
**** Pumpokol (extinct by 1750)
**** ? Jie (extinct after 4th century)
Georg 2007 and Hölzl 2018 use a slightly different classification, placing Pumpokol in both branches:
Proto-Yeniseic
** Northern
*** Yenisei-Ostyakic
****Ket
****Yugh 
*** Pumpokol ?
** Pumpokol ? 
** Southern
*** Assanic
****Assan 
****Kott 
*** Arin 
*** Pumpokol ?A more recent classification, introduced in Fortescue and Vajda 2022 and used in Vajda 2024, is presented below:

*Proto-Yeniseian
**Ketic
***Ket (153 speakers as of the 2020 census)
****&quot;Central Ket&quot;
****&quot;Northern-Southern Ket&quot;
*****&quot;Northern Ket&quot;
*****&quot;Southern Ket&quot;
***Yugh (extinct 1972, 3 speakers reported 2020)
**Arinic
***Arin (extinct by 1800)
**Pumpokolic
***Pumpokol (extinct by 1750)
***Jie? (extinct after 4th century)
**Kottic
***Kott (extinct by the mid-1800s)
**** &quot;Various dialects&quot;
**** Yastin 
**** Yarin 
**** Baikot 
***Assan (extinct by 1800)
It has been suggested that the Xiongnu and Hunnic languages were Southern Yeniseian. Only two languages of this family survived into the 20th century: Ket (also known as &quot;Imbat Ket&quot;), with around 200 speakers, and Yugh (also known as &quot;Sym Ket&quot;), now extinct. The other known members of this family—Arin, Assan, Pumpokol, and Kott—have been extinct for over 150 years. Other groups—the Baikot, Yarin (Buklin), Yastin, Ashkyshtym (Bachat Teleuts), and Koibalkyshtym—are identifiable as Yeniseic speaking from tsarist fur-tax records compiled during the 17th century, but nothing remains of their languages except a few proper names.

== Distribution ==
Ket, the only extant Yeniseian language, is the northernmost known. Historical sources record a contemporaneous northern expansion of the Ket along the Yenisei during the Russian conquest of Siberia. Today, it is mainly spoken in Turukhansky District of Krasnoyarsk Krai in far northern Siberia, in villages such as Kellog and . Yugh, which only recently faced extinction, was spoken from Yeniseysk to Vorogovo, Yartsevo, and the upper Ket River.

The early modern distributions of Arin, Pumpokol, Kott, and Assan can be reconstructed. The Arin were north of Krasnoyarsk, whereas the more distantly related Pumpokol was spoken to the north and west of it, along the upper Ket. Kott and Assan, another pair of closely related languages, occupied the area south of Krasnoyarsk, and east to the Kan River. From toponyms it can be seen that Yeniseian populations probably lived in Buryatia, Zabaykalsky, and northern Mongolia. As an example, the toponym can be found in Zabaykalsky Krai, which is probably related to the Proto-Yeniseian word &quot;*sēs&quot; &#x27;river&#x27; and likely derives from an undocumented Yeniseian language. Some toponyms that appear Yeniseian extend as far as Heilongjiang.

Václav Blažek argues, based on hydronymic data, that Yeniseians were once spread out even farther into the west. He compares, for example, the word , found in more westerly river names, to Proto-Yeniseian *&quot;sēs&quot; &#x27;river&#x27;.

== Origins and history ==
According to a 2016 study, Yeniseian people and their language originated likely somewhere near the Altai Mountains or near Lake Baikal. According to this study, the Yeniseians are linked to Paleo-Eskimo groups. The Yeniseians have also been hypothesised to be representative of a back-migration from Beringia to central Siberia, and the Dené–Yeniseians a result of a radiation of populations out of the Bering land bridge. The spread of ancient Yeniseian languages may be associated with an ancestry component from the Baikal area (Cisbaikal_LNBA), maximized among hunter-gatherers of the local Glazkovo culture. Affinity for this ancestry has been observed among Na-Dene speakers. Cisbaikal_LNBA ancestry is inferred to be rich in Ancient Paleo-Siberian ancestry, and also display affinity to Inner Northeast Asian (Yumin-like) groups.

In Siberia, Edward Vajda observed that Yeniseian hydronyms in the circumpolar region (the recent area of distribution of Yeniseian languages) clearly overlay earlier systems, with the layering of morphemes onto Ugric, Samoyedic, Turkic, and Tungusic place names. It is therefore proposed that the homeland, or dispersal point, of the Yeniseian languages lies in the boreal region between Lake Baikal, northern Mongolia, and the Upper Yenisei basin, referred to by Vajda as a territory &quot;abandoned&quot; by the original Yeniseian speakers. On the other hand, Václav Blažek (2019) argues that based on hydronomic evidence, Yeneisian languages were originally spoken on the northern slopes of the Tianshan and Pamir Mountains before dispersing downstream via the Irtysh River.

The modern populations of Yeniseians in central and northern Siberia are thus not indigenous and represent a more recent migration northward. This was noted by Russian explorers during the conquest of Siberia: the Ket are recorded to have been expanding northwards along the Yenisei, from the river Yeloguy to the Kureyka, from the 17th century onward. Based on these records, the modern Ket-speaking area appears to represent the very northernmost reaches of Yeniseian migration. 

The origin of this northward migration from the Mongolian steppe has been connected to the fall of the Xiongnu confederation. It appears from Chinese sources that a Yeniseian group might have been a major part of the heterogeneous Xiongnu tribal confederation, who have traditionally been considered the ancestors of the Huns and other Northern Asian groups. However, these suggestions are difficult to substantiate due to the paucity of data.

Alexander Vovin argues that at least parts of the Xiongnu, possibly its core or ruling class, spoke a Yeniseian language. Positing a higher degree of similarity of Xiongnu to Yeniseian as compared to Turkic, he also praised Stefan Georg&#x27;s demonstration of how the word &quot;Tengri&quot; (the Turkic and Mongolic word for &#x27;sky&#x27; and later &#x27;god&#x27;) originated from Proto-Yeniseian &quot;tɨŋVr&quot;.

It has been further suggested that the Yeniseian-speaking Xiongnu elite underwent a language shift to Oghur Turkic while migrating westward, eventually becoming the Huns. However, it has also been suggested that the core of the Hunnic language was a Yeniseian language.

Vajda et al. 2013 proposed that the ruling elite of the Huns spoke a Yeniseian language and influenced other languages in the region.

One sentence of the language of the Jie, a Xiongnu tribe who founded the Later Zhao state, appears consistent with being a Yeniseian language. Later studies suggest that Jie is closer to Pumpokol than to other Yeniseian languages such as Ket. This has been substantiated with geographical data by Vajda, who states that Yeniseian hydronyms found in northern Mongolia are exclusively Pumpokolic, in the process demonstrating both a linguistic and geographic proximity between Yeniseian and Jie.

The decline of the southern Yeniseian languages during and after the Russian conquest of Siberia has been attributed to language shifts of the Arin and Pumpokol to Khakas or Chulym Tatar, and the Kott and Assan to Khakas.

==Family features==

The Yeniseian languages share many contact-induced similarities with the South Siberian Turkic languages, Samoyedic languages, and Evenki. These include long-distance nasal harmony, the development of former affricates to stops, and the use of postpositions or grammatical enclitics as clausal subordinators. Yeniseic nominal enclitics closely approximate the case systems of geographically contiguous families. Despite these similarities, Yeniseian appears to stand out among the languages of Siberia in several typological respects, such as the presence of tone, the prefixing verb inflection, and highly complex morphophonology.

The Yeniseian languages have been described as having up to four tones or no tones at all. The &#x27;tones&#x27; are concomitant with glottalization, vowel length, and breathy voice, not unlike the situation reconstructed for Old Chinese before the development of true tones in Chinese. The Yeniseian languages have highly elaborate verbal morphology.

==Proposed relations to other language families==
Until 2008, few linguists had accepted connections between Yeniseian and any other language family, though distant connections have been proposed with most of the ergative languages of Eurasia.

===Dené–Yeniseian===

In 2008, Edward Vajda of Western Washington University presented evidence for a genealogical relation between the Yeniseian languages of Siberia and the Na–Dené languages of North America. At the time of publication (2010), Vajda&#x27;s proposals had been favorably reviewed by several specialists of Na-Dené and Yeniseian languages—although at times with caution—including Michael Krauss, Jeff Leer, James Kari, and Heinrich Werner, as well as a number of other respected linguists, such as Bernard Comrie, Johanna Nichols, Victor Golla, Michael Fortescue, Eric Hamp, and Bill Poser (Kari and Potter 2010:12). One significant exception is the critical review of the volume of collected papers by Lyle Campbell and a response by Vajda published in late 2011 that clearly indicate the proposal is not completely settled at the present time. Two other reviews and notices of the volume appeared in 2011 by Keren Rice and Jared Diamond.

===Karasuk===

The &quot;Karasuk&quot; hypothesis, linking Yeniseian to Burushaski, has been proposed by several scholars, notably by A.P. Dulson and V.N. Toporov. In 2001, George van Driem postulated that the Burusho people were part of the migration out of Central Asia, that resulted in the Indo-European conquest of the Indus Valley.

Alexei Kassian has suggested a connection between Hattic, Hurro-Urartian and Karasuk, proposing some lexical correspondences.

===Sino-Tibetan===

As noted by Tailleur and Werner, some of the earliest proposals of genetic relations of Yeniseian, by M.A. Castrén (1856), James Byrne (1892), and G.J. Ramstedt (1907), suggested that Yeniseian was a northern relative of the Sino–Tibetan languages. These ideas were followed much later by Kai Donner and Karl Bouda. A 2008 study found further evidence for a possible relation between Yeniseian and Sino–Tibetan, citing several possible cognates. Gao Jingyi (2014) identified twelve Sinitic and Yeniseian shared etymologies that belonged to the basic vocabulary, and argued that these Sino-Yeniseian etymologies could not be loans from either language into the other.

The Sino-Caucasian hypothesis of Sergei Starostin posits that the Yeniseian languages form a clade with Sino-Tibetan, which he called Sino-Yeniseian. The Sino-Caucasian hypothesis has been expanded by others to &quot;Dené–Caucasian&quot; to include the Na-Dené languages of North America, Burushaski, Basque and, occasionally, Etruscan. A narrower binary Dené–Yeniseian family has recently been well received. The validity of the rest of the family, however, is viewed as doubtful or rejected by nearly all historical linguists. An updated tree by Georgiy Starostin now groups Na-Dene with Sino-Tibetan and Yeniseian with Burushaski (Karasuk hypothesis). George van Driem does not believe that Sino-Tibetan (which he calls &quot;Trans-Himalayan&quot;) and Yeniseian are related language families. However, he argues that Yeniseian speakers once populated the North China Plain and that Proto-Sinitic speakers assimilated them when they migrated to the region. As a result, Sinitic acquired creoloid characteristics when it came to be used as a lingua franca among ethnolinguistically diverse populations. 

A link between the Na–Dené languages and Sino-Tibetan languages, known as Sino–Dené had also been proposed by Edward Sapir. Around 1920 Sapir became convinced that Na-Dené was more closely related to Sino-Tibetan than to other American families. Edward Vadja&#x27;s Dené–Yeniseian proposal renewed interest among linguists such as Geoffrey Caveney (2014) to look into support for the Sino–Dené hypothesis. Caveney considered a link between Sino-Tibetan, Na-Dené, and Yeniseian to be plausible but did not support the hypothesis that Sino-Tibetan and Na-Dené were related to the Caucasian languages (Sino–Caucasian and Dené–Caucasian). 

A 2023 analysis by David Bradley using the standard techniques of comparative linguistics supports a distant genetic link between the Sino-Tibetan, Na-Dené, and Yeniseian language families. Bradley argues that any similarities Sino-Tibetan shares with other language families of the East Asia area such as Hmong-Mien, Altaic (which is actually a sprachbund), Austroasiatic, Kra-Dai, Austronesian came through contact; but as there has been no recent contact between Sino-Tibetan, Na-Dené, and Yeniseian language families then any similarities these groups share must be residual.

===Dené–Caucasian===

Bouda, in various publications in the 1930s through the 1950s, described a linguistic network that (besides Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan) also included Caucasian, and Burushaski, some forms of which have gone by the name of Sino-Caucasian. The works of R. Bleichsteiner and O.G. Tailleur, the late Sergei A. Starostin and Sergei L. Nikolayev have sought to confirm these connections. Others who have developed the hypothesis, often expanded to Dené–Caucasian, include J.D. Bengtson, V. Blažek, J.H. Greenberg (with M. Ruhlen), and M. Ruhlen. George Starostin continues his father&#x27;s work in Yeniseian, Sino-Caucasian and other fields.

This theory is very controversial or viewed as doubtful or rejected by other linguists.

<doc id="513133" wikidata="Q6503363" url="?curid=513133" title="Transitional Administrative Law (Iraq)">
<text>The Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period (), also called the Transitional Administrative Law or TAL, was Iraq&#x27;s provisional constitution following the 2003 Iraq War. It was signed on March 8, 2004 by the Iraqi Governing Council. It came into effect on June 28, 2004 following the official transfer of power from the Coalition Provisional Authority (a division of the United States Department of Defense) to a sovereign Iraqi government. The law remained in effect until the formation of the government in May 2006, when it was superseded by the permanent constitution that had been approved by referendum on October 15, 2005.

The TAL was principally drafted by a ten-man committee appointed by the Bush Administration with advice from the United States and United Nations personnel.

==Preamble and articles==
The preamble begins:

The people of Iraq, striving to reclaim their freedom, which was usurped by the previous tyrannical regime, rejecting violence and coercion in all their forms, and particularly when used as instruments of governance, have determined that they shall hereafter remain a free people governed under the rule of law.

And contains further,

...affirming today their respect for international law, ... working to reclaim their legitimate place among nations... have endeavored at the same time to preserve the unity of their homeland.

Article 2 provides for an Annex to this document, which was issued by the interim Governing Council on 1 June 2004, before the beginning of the transitional period. The Annex forms an integral part of this Law, and for the most part clarifies aspects of the transitional and interim administration.

==Rights==
Supporters lauded the constitution&#x27;s guarantees of &quot;fundamental rights&quot;:
*equality before the law (Article 12), guaranteeing the equality of all without regard to &quot;gender, sect, opinion, belief, nationality, religion, or origin&quot;;
*freedom of religion, though Islam is stated as the state&#x27;s official religion and is to be considered a source of legislation;
*freedom of speech;
*freedom of the press;
*right to privacy;
*right to a &quot;fair, speedy, and open trial&quot; for all accused of crimes;
*no unlawful arrest or detention;
*torture and cruel and unusual punishment are banned &quot;under all circumstances&quot;;
*right to private property is protected.

A lengthy provision emphasizes that police, investigators, or other governmental authorities may not violate the &quot;sanctity of private residences.&quot;

Iraqis are also guaranteed the right to &quot;education, health care, and social security.&quot; The right to possess, bear, buy, or sell arms is subject to &quot;licensure issued in accordance with the law.&quot;

The right to citizenship is detailed and prominent within the chapter on fundamental rights. Eight provisions govern who is and isn&#x27;t a citizen. Any Iraqi whose citizenship was withdrawn for political, religious, racial, or sectarian reasons has the right to reclaim his Iraqi citizenship, and each Iraqi is guaranteed the right to carry more than one citizenship. Revolutionary Command Council Decree 666, which in 1980 banned citizenship in Iraq for Ajam, Iraqis of Persian origin, is explicitly annulled.

Part of the Law of Administration&#x27;s explicit rejection of Iraq&#x27;s former racist policy (also explicitly referenced) is embodied in the wording &quot;The federal system shall be based upon geographic and historical realities and the separation of powers, and not upon origin, race, ethnicity, nationality, or confession.&quot;

The Law stipulates that both Arabic and Kurdish be the official languages of Iraq.

==Political structure==
The constitution provides for a transitional National Assembly, elected on January 30, 2005.

The government under the Transitional Law is a democratic republic, with three separate branches of government.

The elected National Assembly is a unicameral legislature with 275 elected members. Members selected a President of the Assembly, who serves as a non-voting speaker, and two deputies. The Assembly is the chief lawmaking organ, and is required to propose and pass bills in order to make law for the country.

The Assembly also elected a President of State who along with two deputies formed a Presidency Council to &quot;represent the sovereignty of Iraq and oversee the higher affairs of the country.&quot; The council represents the executive branch of government and has the right to veto laws passed by the Assembly. The Assembly can then over-rule the Council with a two-thirds majority vote.

The Presidency Council appoints the Prime Minister of Iraq and cabinet (Council of Ministers of Iraq), all who must be approved by the Assembly. The Prime Minister and his cabinet exercise most of the day-to-day runnings of government, including control over the armed forces. The Assembly has a right to remove the Prime Minister with a vote of no confidence.

==Transitional period==
The Transitional Administrative Law spelled out the steps to be taken after the transfer of sovereignty to the writing and enactment of a permanent constitution.

Article 2 stated that elections for the National Assembly should take place no later than January 31, 2005.

Article 61 stated that the Assembly should write a permanent constitution by no later than 15 August 2005. The draft permanent constitution would be presented in a referendum to the Iraqi people by 15 October 2005.

According to the TAL, the permanent constitution would be adopted if a majority of Iraqi voters approve it, and no more than 2/3 of the voters in any three governorates disapprove it. This provision was criticized by Ayatollah Al-Sistani on the grounds that it could lead to civil war if voters in the three majority Sunni Muslim governorates reject it.

Article 61 also provided for an extension to the constitution drafting process for up to six months. If the constitution were to be rejected or if the National Assembly failed to come to agreement, the National Assembly was to be dissolved and new elections were to be held.

==Judiciary==
Local court justices are appointed by local governments and their &quot;juridical councils&quot;, the Supreme Court being appointed by the Federal Government. The Supreme Court has nine members and possesses the ability to overturn legislation it finds unconstitutional.

The constitution also establishes several &quot;National Commissions&quot; to investigate and address recent concerns such as human rights and war crimes.

==Kurdistan and local government==
The transitional constitution recognizes the current government of Iraqi Kurdistan as the legitimate government of the Kurds, and allows it to continue to exist within the new federal state.

Iraq elected Governors and Governorate councils for each of its 18 governorates, as well as elected mayors and city councils for each city. Elections were held at the same time as National Assembly elections.

==Role of Shariah==
Shariah is addressed in two ways:
#&quot;Islam is the official religion of the State and is to be considered a source of legislation.&quot; But decisions according to Shariah may not abrogate articles or guarantees:
#&quot;Any legal provision that conflicts with this Law is null and void.&quot; Thus the Law of Administration circumscribes Shariah.

==De-Ba&#x27;athification==
Former Ba&#x27;ath Party members who want to run for office are required to sign documents explicitly denouncing the party and denying they possess any continuing ties to the organization or its principles.

==Revenue from oil==
The natural resources of Iraq are explicitly declared to belong to all the people of all the regions and governorates of Iraq. Their management is required to involve consultation with the governments of the regions and the administrations of the governorates. Revenue resulting from their sale through the national budget is required to be distributed in an equitable manner proportional to the distribution of population throughout the country, and with &quot;due regard for areas that were unjustly deprived of these revenues by the previous regime.&quot;

==Enforcement of Coalition-created laws==
Section A of Article 26 of the Law of Administration reads:

Except as otherwise provided in this Law, the laws in force in Iraq on 30 June 2004 shall remain in effect unless and until rescinded or amended by the Iraqi Transitional Government in accordance with this Law.

This appears to permit the Transitional Government to modify coalition legislation or parts of the Law of Administration &quot;by a three-fourths majority of the members of the National Assembly and the unanimous approval of the Presidency Council&quot;. The Transitional Government, however, may not change the transitional period or remove human rights, nor may they delay the next elections by more than six months.

Significantly, the elected &quot;Transitional Government&quot; is not bound by the clause in the Annex to the Law of Administration which prevented the appointed &quot;Interim Government&quot; from &quot;taking any actions affecting Iraq&#x27;s destiny beyond the limited interim period&quot;.

<text>Steven Pippin (born 1960 at Redhill, Surrey) is an English photographer and installation artist. Pippin works with converted or improvised photographic equipment and kinetic sculptures which are often based on physical models and are metaphors for social mechanisms.

==Early life and education==

Pippin&#x27;s work shows a strong interest in the mechanical, which he has said stems from an early childhood memory of seeing his father surrounded by the wires and tubes of a television set he was repairing.

He studied mechanical engineering at Charles Keen College, Leicester; Foundation Art &amp; Design at Loughborough College, Leicestershire; Fine Art Sculpture at Brighton Polytechnic and Fine Art Sculpture at Chelsea School of Art, London

During his student days he was selected for the DAAD scholarship (German Academic Exchange Service)

From the beginning of his career his works focused on creating atmospheric photographs by converting every day object into provisional pin hole cameras. Later his photography became closer to science after making peace with this type of disciplines.&quot;I hated it because my father and grandfather were engineers... I&#x27;ve gone back to technology now, but for a long time I didn&#x27;t touch it; I blocked it. I tried making gears out of cardboard when I already had the knowledge to machine the parts!&quot;

==Artistic career==
Pippin&#x27;s early work was based on converting furniture and everyday objects into makeshift pinhole cameras which he then used to take sympathetic photographs. Sympathetic photography, as seen through photographer Allan Sekula (1951–2013) using photography not only for an aesthetic purpose but as a tool to show injustices and bodily suffering.

His work often involves a significant amount of planning to overcome the practical problems posed by the chosen object. Pippin typically has to plan and construct a significant amount of supporting equipment to achieve his pictures. Frequently the resulting photographs are distorted or otherwise compromised by the manner of their construction, but the imperfections are seen as an important characteristic of the image, giving a link back to the object which was used as a camera. The photographs are always shown alongside an image of the converted object, and for later works, much of the actual equipment used in the conversion along with supporting documentation.

== Artistic work ==

=== &quot;Point Blank&quot; (2010) ===
Within the exhibition called &quot;A Non Event (Horizon)&quot; that took place from 16 June – 2 October 2011 at the CEAAC (Centre européen d&#x27;actions artistiques contemporaines) there is one of Steven Pippin&#x27;s best-known works: Point Blank.

Throughout this series, the artist exhibits small and medium-sized analog cameras pierced by bullets along with some of the photos they took while the projectile was heading towards them, making his last photos capture the reason for its destruction. This project contains 20 images to date. It began in Wisconsin, USA, and was continued in London later.

It is precisely the fact of obtaining perforated cameras and the symbology that accompanies them that makes this series such an interesting work. As a result, photographs are obtained with distorted and fractured images with organic ramifications that are reminiscent of the chemical process that accompanies analog photographs. In some of the images obtained we can see the bullet out of focus due to its speed.

=== &quot;Analogital&quot; (2008) ===
During the eighties, a transition occurred in the world of photography that brought with it a lot of controversy, dividing photographers between those who abandoned analog to switch to digital format and those who decided to stay with the traditional technique.

In this work, Steven Pippin seeks to reflect this change through a method that consists of simultaneously taking the same photograph with a digital and an analog camera. The image resulting from the synchronized shot is exposed divided in two, either by natural borders (typical of the landscape or element photographed) or artificial ones, separating the two formats.

The analog side is done using a C print, printed by hand; and the digital side is an inkjet print.

=== &quot;Non&quot; (2007) ===
This work is one of the most philosophical, in it we can see a &quot;CANON&quot; camera from which the artist has decided to delete the first two initials, a fact that is referenced in the title of the project itself. The lens of this camera is surrounded by a system of tubes and mirrors that rotate on the camera to focus on itself. This work lacks functionality and is based on self-reflection and absurdity.

=== &quot;Ω = 1&quot; (2003–2014) ===
Our universe is theoretically, according to astrophysical theories, in a constant state of equilibrium between collapse through implosion and total explosion. Normally, physicists use a pencil as a metaphor to show this very delicate state of balance of forces, maintaining its balance supported only by its tip. For approximately 10 years Steven Pippin dedicated himself to devising a sculpture that could represent this metaphor.

The sculpture is based mainly on two lights that project the shadows of a 2B pencil on a metal plate where it is held. These shadows are monitored by sensors that, upon detecting the slightest change, modify the position of the plate where the pencil rests with a margin of 20 milliseconds and almost imperceptibly to avoid losing balance. Thus, the pencil remains upright without the help of anything other than its tip.

This work seems to stop time while keeping the viewer in a constant state of expectation and teaching us the fragility of balance.

=== &quot;Laundromat-Locomotion&quot; (1997) ===
The first images in this series were made in London in 1991. In 1997 Pippin expanded his idea and moved it to a laundry room in New Jersey, where he placed photographic paper on each of the backgrounds of 12 washing machines that were attached to ropes of cotton. That ropes were activated in his path to capture him walking. As we can guess from the name, this work is a tribute to &quot;Animal Locomotion&quot; (1887) by Eadweard Muybridge. In this work, Muybridge tried to confirm or deny the following hypothesis: There is a moment in a horse&#x27;s trot where none of its legs are in contact with the ground. To test this bet, Muybridge had a horse run in front of 12 cameras that were activated by ropes in its path, capturing snapshots of the movement.

Thanks to this, he not only managed to demonstrate that the hypothesis was indeed true, but also laid the foundations of cinema, motion photography, and if that were not enough, he helped the world in general to better understand the movement of the horse. Later he would do more projects capturing dances and everyday movements of human beings.

Pippin&#x27;s tribute was even closer to the original images obtained by Muybridge because the washing machines were spinning at 500 rpm.&quot;(It gave the images) a certain degree of authenticity, making them look like a Muybridge original from a hundred years ago. The scratches on the surface of the negative become a substitute for time, an artificial aging process that gives the images an accidental air of authenticity.&quot;

==Space flight experience==
STS-73 in Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; (October 20 to November 5, 1995) was the second United States Microgravity Laboratory mission. The mission focused on materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, fluid dynamics, and numerous scientific experiments housed in the pressurized Spacelab module. In completing his first space flight, Rominger orbited the Earth 256 times, traveled over 6 million miles, and logged a total of 15 days, 21 hours, and 52 minutes in space.

STS-80, also in &quot;Columbia&quot; (November 19 to December 7, 1996) was a 17-day mission during which the crew deployed and retrieved the Wake Shield Facility (WSF) and the Orbiting Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (ORFEUS) satellites. The free-flying WSF created a super vacuum in its wake and grew thin film wafers for use in semiconductors and other high-tech electrical components. The ORFEUS instruments, mounted on the reusable Shuttle Pallet Satellite, studied the origin and makeup of stars. In completing his second space flight, Rominger orbited the Earth a record 278 times, traveled over 7 million miles and logged 17 days, 15 hours and 53 minutes in space.

STS-85 in Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; (August 7–19, 1997) was a 12-day mission during which the crew deployed and retrieved the CRISTA-SPAS satellite, operated the Japanese Manipulator Flight Demonstration (MFD) robotic arm, studied changes in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and tested technology destined for use on the future International Space Station. The mission was accomplished in 189 Earth orbits, traveling 4.7 million miles in 11 days, 20 hours and 27 minutes.

STS-96, also in &quot;Discovery&quot;, (May 27 to June 6, 1999) was a 10-day mission during which the crew delivered 4 tons of logistics and supplies to the International Space Station in preparation for the arrival of the first crew to live on the station. The mission included the first docking of a Space Shuttle to the International Space Station and was accomplished in 153 Earth orbits, traveling 4 million miles in 9 days, 19 hours and 13 minutes.

<doc id="513149" wikidata="Q832093" url="?curid=513149" title="Cannibal Holocaust">
<text>Cannibal Holocaust is a 1980 Italian cannibal film directed by Ruggero Deodato and written by Gianfranco Clerici. It stars Robert Kerman as Harold Monroe, an anthropologist who leads a rescue team into the Amazon rainforest to locate a crew of filmmakers that have gone missing while filming a documentary on local cannibal tribes.

Produced as part of the contemporary cannibal trend of Italian exploitation cinema, &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was inspired by Italian media coverage of Red Brigades terrorism. Deodato believed the news reports to be staged, an idea that became an integral aspect of the film&#x27;s story. Additional story elements were also influenced by the Mondo documentaries of Gualtiero Jacopetti, particularly the presentation of the documentary crew&#x27;s lost footage, which constitutes approximately half of the film. The treatment of this footage, which is noted for its visual realism, innovated the found footage style of filmmaking that was later popularized in American cinema by &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was filmed primarily on location in the Amazon rainforest of Colombia with a cast of indigenous tribes interacting with mostly inexperienced American and Italian actors recruited in New York City.

&quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; achieved notoriety as its graphic violence aroused a great deal of controversy. After its premiere in Italy, it was ordered to be seized by a local magistrate. Deodato, screenwriter Gianfanco Clerici, and producers Francesco Palaggi, Alda Pia, and Franco Di Nunzio were convicted of obscenity. The film was released from seizure in 1982. It was banned in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and several other countries due to its graphic content, including sexual assault and genuine violence toward animals. Although some nations have since revoked the ban, it is still upheld in several countries. Critical reception of the film is mixed, although it has received a cult following. The film&#x27;s plot and violence have been noted as commentary on journalism ethics, exploitation of South American countries, and the difference between Western and non-Western cultures, yet these interpretations have also been met with criticism, with any perceived subtext deemed hypocritical or insincere due to the film&#x27;s presentation.

==Plot==
In 1979, an American film crew disappears in the Amazon rainforest while filming &quot;The Green Inferno&quot;, a documentary about indigenous cannibal tribes. The team comprises director Alan Yates, scriptwriter Faye Daniels, and two cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso.

Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at New York University, agrees to lead a rescue mission in hopes of finding the missing filmmakers. In anticipation of his arrival, military personnel stationed in the rainforest conduct a raid on the local Yacumo tribe and take a young man hostage to negotiate with the natives. Monroe flies in via floatplane and is introduced to his guides, Chaco and his assistant, Miguel. After several days of trekking through the jungle, the rescue team encounters the Yacumo. They arrange the release of their hostage in exchange for being taken to the Yacumo village. Once there, the group is initially greeted with hostility and learns that the filmmakers caused great unrest among the people. 

The next day, Monroe and his guides head deeper into the rainforest to locate two warring endocannibal tribes, the Ya̧nomamö and the Shamatari. They encounter a group of Shamatari warriors and follow them to a riverbank, where Monroe&#x27;s team saves a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from death. The Ya̧nomamö invite the team back to their village in gratitude, but they are still suspicious of the foreigners. Monroe bathes naked in a river to gain their trust, where a group of Ya̧nomamö women joins him. The women lead Monroe from the river to a shrine, where he discovers the skeletal remains of the filmmakers with their film reels nearby. Shocked by what he sees, he confronts the Ya̧nomamö in the village, where he plays music from a tape recorder. The intrigued natives agree to trade it for the reels of film.

Back in New York, Pan American Broadcasting System executives invite Monroe to host a documentary broadcast based on the recovered film. Still, Monroe insists on viewing the raw footage before making a decision. One of the executives introduces him to Alan&#x27;s work by showing an excerpt from his previous documentary, &quot;The Last Road to Hell,&quot; after which she informs Monroe that Alan staged dramatic scenes to get more exciting footage.

Monroe then begins to view the recovered footage, which follows the group&#x27;s trek through the rainforest. After walking for days, their guide, Felipe, is bitten by a venomous snake. The group amputates Felipe&#x27;s leg with a machete to save his life, but he dies and is left behind. Upon locating the Yacumo in a clearing, Jack shoots one in the leg so they can easily follow him to the village. Once they arrive, the crew proceeds to intimidate the tribe and kill a young child&#x27;s pet pig before herding the natives into a hut, which they burn down to stage a massacre for their film. Monroe expresses apprehension about the staged footage and the treatment of the natives, but his concerns are ignored.

After viewing the remaining footage, Monroe expresses his disgust toward the station&#x27;s decision to air the documentary. He shows the executives the remaining unedited footage that only he has seen to convince them otherwise. The final two reels begin with the filmmakers locating a Ya̧nomamö girl, whom the men take turns raping against Faye&#x27;s protests, stating they are wasting film footage. A Ya̧nomamö man is stalking them as the incident occurs. They later encounter the same girl impaled on a wooden pole by a riverbank, where they claim that the natives killed her for loss of virginity. (It is suggested that the group themselves killed her and staged it as a murder by the natives for dramatic effect. This is left ambiguous in the footage.)

Shortly afterward, they are attacked by the Ya̧nomamö tribe as revenge for the girl&#x27;s rape and death. A spear hits Jack, and Alan shoots him to prevent his escape. The scene then moves to the crew filming the natives undressing Jack in their captivity and castrating him with a large machete before completely mutilating Jack&#x27;s lifeless body. Thereafter, an exhausted Alan says they have gotten completely lost trying to escape and are now surrounded by the natives who pursued them. Alan attempts to scare them off with a flare gun as a last resort. During the commotion, Faye is captured by the Ya̧nomamö. Alan insists that they try to rescue her, but Mark continues to film as she is stripped naked, gang-raped, beaten to death, and beheaded. The Ya̧nomamö then locate and kill the last two team members as the camera drops to the ground. Disturbed by what they have seen, the executives order all footage to be burned. Monroe leaves the station, pondering &quot;who the real cannibals are.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===

Production on &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; began in 1979, when director Ruggero Deodato was contacted by West German film distributors to make a film similar to his previous work, &quot;Last Cannibal World&quot;. He accepted the project and immediately went in search of a producer, choosing his friend Francesco Palaggi. The two first flew to Colombia to scout filming locations. Leticia, Colombia was chosen as the principal filming location after Deodato met a Colombian documentary filmmaker at the airport in Bogotá, who suggested the town as a location ideal for filming. Other locations had been considered, specifically those where Gillo Pontecorvo&#x27;s &quot;Burn!&quot; had been shot, but Deodato rejected these locations due to lack of suitable rainforest.

Deodato conceived of the film&#x27;s premise while talking to his son about news coverage of the terrorism of the Red Brigades. Deodato thought that the media focused on portraying violence with little regard for journalistic integrity and believed that journalists staged certain news angles in order to obtain more sensational footage. The Italian media was symbolized by the behavior in the film team in &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;, the depiction of whom was also influenced by the works of Gualtiero Jacopetti, a documentary filmmaker of whom Deodato was a fan. Jacopetti and his partner, Franco Prosperi, are credited with popularizing Mondo films, a genre of documentary, with their first release, &quot;Mondo cane&quot;. Mondo films focused on sensational and graphic content from around the world, including local customs, violence, sexuality, and death. Deodato included similar content in &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;, such as graphic violence and animal death, and the documentary that is produced in &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; resembles a Mondo film. The scene of Monroe bathing naked in a river and the scene of a forced abortion rite have also been noted as being similar to scenes in Antonio Climati&#x27;s Mondo film &quot;Savana violenta&quot;.

The Italian screenwriter Gianfranco Clerici wrote the script under the working title &quot;I figli della luna&quot; (&quot;The Sons of the Moon&quot;). He had collaborated with Deodato in his previous films &quot;Ultimo mondo cannibale&quot; and &quot;The House on the Edge of the Park&quot;, the latter of which was filmed before &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; but released afterward. The screenplay included multiple scenes that did not make the film&#x27;s final cut, including a scene in which a group of Ya̧nomamö cuts off the leg of a Shamatari warrior and feeds him to piranhas in a river. This scene was to take place directly after Monroe&#x27;s team rescues a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from the Shamatari. Attempts were made to film this scene, but the underwater camera did not operate properly, and the piranha were difficult to control. As a result, Deodato abandoned his efforts, and still photographs taken during the scene&#x27;s setup are its only known depiction. The originally scripted version of &quot;The Last Road to Hell&quot;, which was written to depict soldiers advancing upon an enemy position, also went unused, as Deodato instead decided to use stock footage of political executions for the segment in order to draw further parallels to the films of Jacopetti. The character names Mark Williams and Shanda Tommaso in Clerici&#x27;s screenplay were also changed to Mark Tomaso and Faye Daniels, respectively, in the film.

===Casting===
Deodato decided to film &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; in English in order to appeal to a wider audience and to lend the film credibility. There is one scene in Spanish, about seven minutes in, for which the subtitles vary in different versions of the film. However, the film had to establish a European nationality so that it could be more easily distributed among European countries. Under Italian law, for the film to be recognized as Italian, at least two actors who spoke Italian as a native language had to star in the film. Luca Giorgio Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi, two inexperienced students from the Actors Studio in New York City, were cast as Mark Tomaso and Faye Daniels, respectively, in part because they were native Italian speakers who also spoke English. Deodato also hired an American from the Actors Studio, Perry Pirkkanen, to play Jack Anders.

A friend of Pirkkanen was initially cast to play Alan Yates, but he dropped out of the film shortly before the production team left for the Amazon. He instead appears in the film as an ex-colleague of Yates. Casting director Bill Williams subsequently contacted Carl Gabriel Yorke to play the role. Yorke, a stage actor who had studied under Uta Hagen, was chosen in part because he was the right size for the costumes and boots, which had already been purchased. Because &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was a non-union production, Yorke originally wanted to be credited under the stage name Christopher Savage, although he ultimately decided it to be unnecessary due to the film&#x27;s obscurity and remote filming location.

Robert Kerman had years of experience working in adult films under the pseudonym R. Bolla, including the well-known &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot;, before breaking into the Italian film industry. Kerman was recommended to Deodato for his previous film, &quot;The Concorde Affair&quot;, in which Kerman played an air traffic controller, and his performance impressed Deodato enough to have Kerman cast as Harold Monroe in &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;. Kerman went on to star in the Italian cannibal films &quot;Eaten Alive!&quot; and &quot;Cannibal Ferox&quot;, both directed by Umberto Lenzi. Kerman&#x27;s girlfriend at the time was cast as one of the station executives, as she was available to film in both New York City and Rome.

===Direction===
Film historian David Kerekes contends that the film&#x27;s sense of reality is based on the direction and the treatment of the film team&#x27;s recovered footage, noting that the &quot;shaky hand-held camerawork commands a certain realism, and &#x27;The Green Inferno,&#x27; the ill-fated team&#x27;s film-within-a-film here, is no exception&quot;, and that &quot;this very instability gives the &#x27;Green Inferno&#x27; film its authentic quality.&quot; David Carter of the cult horror webzine &quot;Savage Cinema&quot; says that Deodato&#x27;s methods added a first-person narration quality to the film team&#x27;s footage, writing: &quot;The viewer feels as if they are there with the crew, experiencing the horrors with them.&quot; Deodato was proud of other aspects of the cinematography, namely the numerous moving shots using a standard, shoulder-mounted camera, forgoing the use of a steadicam.

Kerekes noted the animal slaughter and inclusion of footage from &quot;The Last Road to Hell&quot; as adding to the sense of reality of the film. Lloyd Kaufman of Troma Entertainment compares these scenes to Vsevolod Pudovkin&#x27;s theory of montage, saying: &quot;In &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;, we see the actors kill and rip apart a giant sea turtle and other animals. [...] The brain has been conditioned to accept that which it&#x27;s now seeing as real. This mixture of real and staged violence, combined with the handheld camerawork and the rough, unedited quality of the second half of the movie, is certainly enough to convince someone that what they are watching is real.&quot; Deodato says he included the execution footage in &quot;The Last Road to Hell&quot; to draw further similarities to &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; and the Mondo filmmaking of Gualtiero Jacopetti.

===Filming===

Principal photography began on 4 June 1979. The scenes featuring the film team were shot first with handheld 16mm cameras in a &quot;cinéma vérité&quot; style that mimicked an observational documentary, a technique Deodato had learned from his mentor Roberto Rossellini. This same style was also used by Climati in his Mondo film &quot;Ultime grida dalla savana&quot;, which may have been influential on Deodato&#x27;s direction. After shooting with the film team was completed, Kerman flew down to film his scenes in the rainforest and then to New York to film exterior shots in the city. Leticia was only accessible by aircraft, and from there, the cast and crew had to travel by boat to reach the set. The interior shots of New York were filmed later in a studio in Rome.

Production on the film was delayed numerous times while in the Amazon. After the actor originally cast as Alan Yates dropped out of the role, filming was halted for two weeks until new casting calls were completed and Yorke arrived in Leticia. During principal filming with Kerman, the father of the actor who played Miguel was murdered, and production was again halted as the actor flew back to Bogotá to attend his father&#x27;s funeral. The locale also presented problems for the production, in particular the heat and sudden rain storms, which sporadically delayed filming.

Interpersonal relationships were strained on the set. Kerman and Deodato frequently clashed, as the two got into long, drawn-out arguments every day of shooting, usually because of remarks made by Deodato to which Kerman took offense. Although Deodato noted that the two were always friendly again a few minutes later, Kerman expressed his personal dislike of Deodato in several interviews. He described Deodato as remorseless and uncaring on set and stated that he did not believe that Deodato had a soul. Kerman also noted hostile treatment of other cast and crew members by Deodato, stating: &quot;He was a sadist. He was particularly sadistic to people that couldn&#x27;t answer back, people that were Colombian, [and] people that were Italian but could be sent home.&quot; Yorke and co-star Perry Pirkkanen also did not get along, which Yorke attributed to disappointment that Pirkkanen felt after his friend dropped out of the production. Yorke also alienated Ciardi after he declined to have sex with her in preparation for filming their sex scene.

Multiple cast and crew members were uncomfortable with the film&#x27;s graphic content, in particular the genuine killing of animals. Yorke described the shoot as having &quot;a level of cruelty unknown to me&quot; and was initially unsure if he was taking part in a snuff film. When his character was scripted to kill a pig on camera, Yorke refused, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. Yorke had traveled with the pig to the set and felt he had formed a relationship with the animal. When it was shot, the emotional impact of hearing the pig squeal subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because the production did not have access to additional pigs. Kerman similarly objected to the killing of the coati and stormed off the set while its death scene was filmed; he had repeatedly pressed Deodato to let the animal go in the minutes leading up to filming. Pirkkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when a squirrel monkey was killed for the film.

The film&#x27;s sexual content also proved a point of contention among the cast members. Ciardi did not want to bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Yorke, and she became agitated with him during the filming of the scene. When she refused to comply with the direction, Deodato led her off the set and screamed at her in Italian until she agreed to perform the scene as instructed. Yorke also became severely upset while filming a scene in which his character takes a part in the rape of a native girl. The film&#x27;s content had given Yorke anxiety throughout his time in Colombia, and this tension peaked during the rape scene. His experiences on set ultimately weighed so heavily on him that Yorke ended his relationship with his girlfriend in New York shortly after his return from the Amazon.

Yorke experienced unfair payment practices when his first payment for the film came in the form of Colombian pesos and was less than what had been agreed upon. He refused to continue shooting until he was paid the correct amount in United States dollars. The native extras also went unpaid for their work despite their involvement in numerous dangerous scenes, including a scene in which they were forced to stay inside a burning hut for a prolonged period of time.

==Soundtrack==

The film&#x27;s soundtrack was composed entirely by Italian composer Riz Ortolani, whom Deodato specifically requested because of Ortolani&#x27;s work in &quot;Mondo Cane&quot;. Deodato was particularly fond of the film&#x27;s main theme, &quot;Ti guarderò nel cuore&quot;, which was given lyrics and became a worldwide pop hit under the title &quot;More&quot;. The music of &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; is a variety of styles, from a gentle melody in the &quot;Main Theme&quot;, to a sad and flowing score in &quot;Crucified Woman&quot;, and faster and more upbeat tracks in &quot;Cameraman&#x27;s Recreation&quot;, &quot;Relaxing in the Savannah&quot;, and &quot;Drinking Coco&quot;, to the sinister-sounding &quot;Massacre of the Troupe&quot;. The instrumentation is equally mixed, ranging from full orchestras to electronics and synthesizers.

The film&#x27;s main theme was used in 2022 for the American teen series &quot;Euphoria&quot;, where it was played during the closing credits for the season 2 episode &quot;The Theater and Its Double&quot;.

===Track listing===
==Release==
&quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; premiered on 7 February 1980 in the Italian city of Milan. Although the courts later confiscated the film based on a citizen&#x27;s complaint, the initial audience reaction was positive. After seeing the film, director Sergio Leone wrote a letter to Deodato, which stated (translated): &quot;Dear Ruggero, what a movie! The second part is a masterpiece of cinematographic realism, but everything seems so real that I think you will get in trouble with all the world.&quot; In the ten days before it was seized, the film had grossed approximately $2 million. In Japan, it grossed $21 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of that time after &quot;E.T. the Extraterrestrial&quot;. Deodato has claimed the film has grossed as much as $200 million worldwide in the wake of its various re-releases.

===Critical response===
Critics remain split on their stances of &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;. Supporters of the film cite it as a serious and well-made social commentary on the modern world. Sean Axmaker praised the structure and setup of the film, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s a weird movie with an awkward narrative, which Deodato makes all the more effective with his grimy sheen of documentary realism, while Riz Ortolani&#x27;s unsettlingly lovely, elegiac score provides a weird undercurrent.&quot; Jason Buchanan of AllMovie said: &quot;While it&#x27;s hard to defend the director for some of the truly repugnant images with which he has chosen to convey his message, there is indeed an underlying point to the film, if one is able to look beyond the sometimes unwatchable images that assault the viewer.&quot;

Detractors, however, criticize the over-the-top gore and the genuine animal slayings and also point to the hypocrisy that the film presents. Nick Schager criticized the brutality of the film, saying: &quot;As clearly elucidated by its shocking gruesomeness—as well as its unabashedly racist portrait of indigenous folks it purports to sympathize with [the real indigenous peoples in Brazil whose names were used in the film—the Ya̧nomamö and Shamatari—are not fierce enemies as portrayed in the film, nor is either tribe truly cannibalistic, although the Ya̧nomamö do partake in a form of post-mortem ritual cannibalism]—the actual savages involved with &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; are the ones behind the camera.&quot;

Robert Firsching of AllMovie made similar criticisms of the film&#x27;s content, saying: &quot;While the film is undoubtedly gruesome enough to satisfy fans, its mixture of nauseating mondo animal slaughter, repulsive sexual violence, and pie-faced attempts at socially conscious moralizing make it rather distasteful morally as well.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Eric Henderson said it is &quot;artful enough to demand serious critical consideration, yet foul enough to christen you a pervert for even bothering.&quot;

In recent years, &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; has received accolades in various publications as well as a cult following. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 67% based on 18 reviews, with a weighted average of 5.5/10. British film magazine &quot;Total Film&quot; ranked &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; as the tenth greatest horror film of all time, and the film was included in a similar list of the top 25 horror films compiled by &quot;Wired&quot;. The film also came in eighth on &quot;IGN&quot;″s list of the ten greatest &quot;grindhouse&quot; films.

===Interpretations===
&quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; is seen by some critics as social commentary on various aspects of modern civilization by comparing Western society to that of the cannibals. David Carter says: &quot;&quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; is not merely focused on the societal taboo of flesh eating. The greater theme of the film is the difference between the civilized and the uncivilized. Though the graphic violence can be hard for most to stomach, the most disturbing aspect of the film is what Deodato is saying about modern society. The film asks the questions &#x27;What is it to be &#x27;civilized&#x27;?&#x27; and &#x27;Is it a good thing? Mark Goodall, author of &quot;Sweet &amp; Savage: The World Through the Shockumentary Film Lens&quot;, also contends the film&#x27;s message is [to show] &quot;the rape of the natural world by the unnatural; the exploitation of &#x27;primitive&#x27; cultures for Western entertainment.&quot;

Deodato&#x27;s intentions regarding the Italian media coverage of the Red Brigades have also fallen under critical examination and has been expanded to include all sensationalism. Carter explores this, claiming that &quot;[the lack of journalistic integrity] is shown through the interaction between Professor Monroe and the news agency that had backed the documentary crew. They continually push Monroe to finish editing the footage because blood and guts equal ratings.&quot; Lloyd Kaufman claims that this form of exploitative journalism can still be seen in the media today and in programming such as reality television. Goodall and film historians David Slater and David Kerekes have also suggested that Deodato was attempting to comment on the documentary works of Antonio Climati with his film.

Despite these interpretations, Deodato has said in interviews that he had no intentions in &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; but to make a film about cannibals. Actor Luca Barbareschi asserts this as well and believes that Deodato only uses his films to &quot;put on a show&quot;. Robert Kerman contradicts these assertions, stating that Deodato did tell him of political concerns involving the media in the making of this film.

These interpretations have also been criticized as hypocritical and poor justification for the film&#x27;s content, as &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; itself is highly sensationalized. Firsching claims that &quot;The fact that the film&#x27;s sole spokesperson for the anti-exploitation perspective is played by porn star Robert Kerman should give an indication of where its sympathies lie&quot;, while Schager says Deodato is &quot;pathetically justifying the unrepentant carnage by posthumously damning his eaten filmmaker protagonists with a &#x27;who are the real monsters – the cannibals or us?&#x27; anti-imperialism morale.&quot;

&quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; is relevant to the historical relationship between the United States and Latin America. In &quot;Dissecting Cannibal Holocaust&quot;, Nathan Wardinski observes that &quot;the fictionalized native people of this film personify Western and specifically US attitudes toward the region and its people.&quot; The film is also relevant to the contentious history of western anthropologists and the Yanomami people (referred to as Yanomamö in the film). The Yanomami were brought to worldwide attention by anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon whose work described the Yanomami as &quot;the fierce people&quot; who lived in a constant state of warfare. According to Chagnon, rape and domestic violence were commonplace in Yanomami culture when he conducted field research. These findings were disputed by other anthropologists and Chagnon&#x27;s reputation was devastated by the book &quot;Darkness in El Dorado: How Scientists and Journalists Devastated the Amazon&quot; by Patrick Tierney although the accuracy of &quot;Darkness in El Dorado&quot; was questioned. The book was the basis for the documentary &quot;Secrets of the Tribe&quot;. There is evidence that Clerici used Chagnon&#x27;s work as the basis for the script to &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;.

==Controversies==
Since its original release, &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; has been the target of censorship by moral and animal activists. Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and genuine cruelty to animals, issues which find &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; in the midst of controversy to this day. Due to this notoriety, &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; has been marketed as having been banned in over 50 countries. In 2006, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine named &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; as the 20th most controversial film of all time.

===Snuff film allegations===

Ten days after its premiere in Milan, &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was confiscated under the orders of a local magistrate, and Ruggero Deodato was charged with obscenity. As all copies were to be turned over to the authorities, the film was released in other countries like the United Kingdom via subterfuge. In January 1981, during the film&#x27;s theatrical run in France, the magazine &quot;Photo&quot; suggested that certain deaths depicted in the film were real, which would have made &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; a snuff film. Although it has been rumored that Deodato was charged with murder, there is no evidence that the Italian authorities believed this to be the case. Neither Deodato nor the film&#x27;s producers were ever charged with murder.

Rumors of the &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; murder trial often claim that the actors had signed contracts with the production which ensured that they would not appear in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film&#x27;s release. Deodato himself has claimed this was the case. However, actor Carl Yorke has denied that he ever signed any sort of contract of this kind nor was he asked to appear in court. Furthermore, actors Robert Kerman, Perry Pirkkanen, and Francesca Ciardi worked in films released during and shortly after &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;&#x27;s release. 

===Censorship===
Although the snuff film allegations were successfully refuted, the Italian courts decided to ban &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; due to the genuine animal slayings, citing animal cruelty laws. Deodato, Franco Palaggi, Franco Di Nunzio, Gianfranco Clerici, producer Alda Pia and United Artists Europa representative Sandro Perotti each received a four-month suspended sentence after they were all convicted of obscenity and violence. Deodato fought in the courts for three additional years to get his film unbanned. In 1984, the courts ruled in favor of Deodato, and &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was granted a rating certificate of VM18 for a cut print. It would later be re-released uncut.

&quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; also faced censorship issues in other countries around the world. In 1981, video releases were not required to pass before the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), which had power to ban films in the United Kingdom. &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was released straight-to-video there, thus avoiding the possible banning of the film. This did not save the movie, however, because in 1983, the Director of Public Prosecutions compiled a list of 72 video releases that were not brought before the BBFC for certification and declared them prosecutable for obscenity. This list of &quot;video nasties&quot; included &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;, which was successfully prosecuted and banned. The film was not approved for release in the UK until 2001, albeit with nearly six minutes of mandated cuts. In 2011, the BBFC waived all but one of these previous edits and passed &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; with fifteen seconds of cuts. It was determined that the only scene that breached the BBFC&#x27;s guidelines was the killing of a coatimundi, and the BBFC acknowledged that previous cuts were reactionary to the film&#x27;s reputation.

&quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was banned at various times in Australia, Norway, Finland, Iceland, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and several other countries. The movie was briefly released in the US by Trans American Films in 1985, but this release was commercially doomed because &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was rated X by the Motion Picture Association. &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was released on LaserDisc and distributed worldwide by Cult Epics. It would eventually get a two-disc DVD release in 2005 by Grindhouse Releasing. In 2005, the Office of Film and Literature Classification in Australia lifted the ban, passing &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; with an R18+ rating for the uncut print, including the consumer advice, &quot;High level sexual violence, high level violence, animal cruelty.&quot; In 2006, the film was rejected for classification and banned in its entirety by the OFLC in New Zealand. Cuts to retain an R18 classification were offered by the Office, but they were eventually refused.

===Animal cruelty===
Many of the censorship issues with &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; concern the on-screen killings of animals. Deodato himself has condemned his past actions, saying: &quot;I was stupid to introduce animals.&quot; Although six animal deaths appear onscreen, seven animals were killed for the production, as the scene depicting the monkey&#x27;s death was shot twice, resulting in the death of two monkeys. Both of the animals were eaten by indigenous cast members, who consider monkey brains a delicacy. The animals that were killed onscreen were:
* a South American coati (mistaken for a muskrat in the film), killed with a knife
* an Arrau turtle, decapitated and its limbs, shell, and entrails removed
* a tarantula, killed with a machete
* a boa constrictor, also killed with a machete
* a squirrel monkey, decapitated with a machete
* a pig, shot in the head with a shotgun at point blank range

Film historian Andrew DeVos has argued that the animal deaths have been harshly condemned because of the film&#x27;s classification as exploitation, whereas animal mutilations in films perceived by critics to be classics or art films are often ignored. DeVos cites several examples of this double standard, including &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;, &quot;El Topo&quot;, &quot;Wake in Fright&quot;, and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. The BBFC made a similar conclusion regarding the censorship of scenes in which the deaths were quick and painless, noting: &quot;Removing these sequences would be inconsistent with the BBFC&#x27;s decisions to permit quick clean kills in several other films, such as &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.&quot;

==Legacy==

&quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was innovative in its plot structure, specifically with the concept of the &quot;found footage&quot; being brought back to civilization and later viewed to determine the fate of the crew that shot it. This was later popularized as a distinct style in Hollywood cinema by &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot; and &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, both of which use similar storytelling devices. Each film uses the idea of a lost film team making a documentary in the wilderness, and their footage returned. Advertisements for &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; also promoted the idea that the footage is genuine. Deodato has acknowledged the similarities between his film and &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, and though he holds no malice against the producers, he is frustrated at the publicity that &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; received for being an original production. The producers of &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot; have denied that &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was a major influence. Nonetheless, the film was cited by director Paco Plaza as a source of inspiration for the found footage films &quot;REC&quot; and &quot;REC 2&quot;.

&quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; has been regarded as the apex of the cannibal genre, and it bears similarities to subsequent cannibal films made during the same time period. &quot;Cannibal Ferox&quot; also stars Kerman and Pirkkanen, and star Giovanni Lombardo Radice says it was made based on the success of &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;. &quot;Cannibal Ferox&quot; has also been noted as containing similar themes to &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;, such as comparison of Western violence to perceived uncivilized cultures and anti-imperialism. In a mixed review, film journalist Jay Slater claims: &quot;Certainly a tough customer, &quot;Cannibal Ferox&quot; still fails where Deodato succeeds. [...] Lenzi attempts to tackle cultural defilement and racial issues, but &quot;Cannibal Ferox&quot; is nothing more than a shoddy exercise in sadism and animal cruelty.&quot; Reviewer Andrew Parkinson also notes: &quot;At the end, there is a basic attempt to validate &quot;Cannibal Ferox&quot;, posing that old chestnut of whether civilised man is actually more savage than the uncivilised tribespeople.&quot;
Unofficial sequels to &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; were produced in the years following its release. The titles of these films were changed following their original theatrical releases in order to associate the film with &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; in different markets. In 1985, Mario Gariazzo directed &quot;Schiave bianche: violenza in Amazzonia&quot;, which was also released as &quot;Cannibal Holocaust 2: The Catherine Miles Story&quot;. In addition to the new title, Slater notes similarities between the score in &quot;The Catherine Miles Story&quot; and Riz Ortolani&#x27;s score in &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;. Previously known for his work in Mondo films, Antonio Climati directed &quot;Natura contro&quot; in 1988, which was released as &quot;Cannibal Holocaust II&quot; in the United Kingdom.

In 2005, Deodato announced that he planned to make a companion piece to &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; entitled &quot;Cannibals&quot;. Deodato was originally hesitant about directing his new film, as he thought that he would make it too violent for American audiences. However, while he was in Prague filming his cameo appearance in &quot;&quot; for Eli Roth, Deodato viewed &quot;Hostel&quot; and decided that he would direct after all, citing it as a similarly violent film that was given a mainstream release in the United States. Although the screenplay, written by Christine Conradt, was completed, a financial conflict between Deodato and the film&#x27;s producer led to the project&#x27;s cancellation. In 2013, Roth directed &quot;The Green Inferno&quot;, which takes its title from the fictional documentary produced in &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;. Roth&#x27;s film was intended as an homage to &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; and other cannibal films from the same era.

The film&#x27;s influence has extended to other media as well. In 2001, Death metal band Necrophagia released a song entitled &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; from the eponymous record.

It was revealed in April 2020, that the movie would be getting a video game sequel called &quot;Ruggero Deodato, Cannibal&quot;. The game is being developed by Fantastico Studios and was expected to be available from November 2020 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC and mobile. However, in December 2020, the game was retitled &quot;Borneo: A Jungle Nightmare&quot; and delayed to Spring 2021, and later in 2024 under a new title, “Cannibal Tales”. The new title would still feature the “Borneo: Jungle Nightmare” story, but now under an episodic style of gameplay.

==Alternate versions (home media)==
Due to its graphic content, there are several different versions in circulation, edited to varying degrees. In the United Kingdom, it was originally released on VHS by Go Video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts. These cuts were self-imposed by the distributor, possibly due to technical limitations of the tape. In 2001, the film was passed for release on DVD by the British Board of Film Classification with five minutes and 44 seconds of cuts to remove scenes of animal cruelty and sexual violence; all but 15 seconds of these cuts were waived for a re-release in 2011. The latter also includes a new edit sponsored by Deodato, which reduces the violence toward animals. Grindhouse Releasing&#x27;s home video releases contain an &quot;Animal Cruelty Free&quot; version that omits the six animal deaths. Other versions also contain alternative footage shot specifically for Middle Eastern markets that do not depict nudity.

There are multiple versions of the &quot;Last Road to Hell&quot; segment, which causes variances even among uncensored releases. An extended version includes approximately 10 seconds of footage not seen in an alternative, shorter version. This additional footage includes a wide-angle shot of firing-squad executions, a close-up of a dead victim and extended footage of bodies being carried into the back of a truck. The longer version also includes different titles that correctly name the film crew as they appear in the final film, while the shorter version gives the names that originally appear in the script.

In August 2022, UK based distributor 88 Films announced a newly restored 4K UHD Blu-ray will be available in November.

<text>Å is a small village and a parish in Norrköping Municipality, Östergötland County, Sweden. It has a population of about 200.

Å, which means &quot;stream&quot; or &quot;small river&quot;, is a contender for the title of shortest place-name in the world — although other places named Å as well as Ö and Y can make the same claim. As a consequence, many tourists have ventured to the village for the sole purpose of either taking photos of or stealing the place-name sign.

The parish of Å is rich in ancient remains, of which the oldest date from the Stone Age.

<doc id="513180" wikidata="Q1479494" url="?curid=513180" title="Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria">
<text>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired, life-threatening disease of the blood characterized by destruction of red blood cells by the complement system, a part of the body&#x27;s innate immune system. This destructive process occurs due to deficiency of the red blood cell surface protein DAF, which normally inhibits such immune reactions. Since the complement cascade attacks the red blood cells within the blood vessels of the circulatory system, the red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) is considered an &quot;intravascular&quot; hemolytic anemia. There is ongoing research into other key features of the disease, such as the high incidence of venous blood clot formation. Research suggests that PNH thrombosis (a blood clot) is caused by both the absence of GPI-anchored complement regulatory proteins (CD55 and CD59) on PNH platelets and the excessive consumption of nitric oxide (NO).

PNH is the only hemolytic anemia caused by an &quot;acquired&quot; (rather than inherited) intrinsic defect in the cell membrane (deficiency of glycophosphatidylinositol or GPI) leading to the absence of protective exterior surface proteins that normally attach via a GPI anchor. It may develop on its own (&quot;primary PNH&quot;) or in the context of other bone marrow disorders such as aplastic anemia (&quot;secondary PNH&quot;). Only a minority of affected people have the telltale red urine in the morning that originally gave the condition its name.

Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is the only cure, but has significant rates of additional medical problems and death. The monoclonal antibody eculizumab reduces the need for blood transfusions and improves quality of life for those affected by PNH. Eculizumab dramatically alters the natural course of PNH, reducing symptoms and disease complications as well as improving survival to the extent that it may be equivalent to that of the general population. Eculizumab costs at least US$440,000 for a single year of treatment and has been reported as one of the world&#x27;s most expensive drugs.

==Signs and symptoms==
The classic sign of PNH is red discoloration of the urine due to the presence of hemoglobin and hemosiderin from the breakdown of red blood cells. As the urine is more concentrated in the morning, this is when the color is most pronounced. This phenomenon mainly occurs in those who have the primary form of PNH, who will notice this at some point in their disease course. The remainder mainly experience the symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations.

A small proportion of patients report attacks of abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing and pain during swallowing, as well as erectile dysfunction in men; this occurs mainly when the breakdown of red blood cells is rapid, and is attributable to spasm of smooth muscle due to depletion of nitric oxide by red cell breakdown products.

Forty percent of people with PNH develop thrombosis at some point in their illness. This is the main cause of severe complications and death in PNH. These may develop in common sites (deep vein thrombosis of the leg and resultant pulmonary embolism when these clots break off and enter the lungs), but in PNH blood clots may also form in more unusual sites: the hepatic vein (causing Budd-Chiari syndrome), the portal vein of the liver (causing portal vein thrombosis), the superior or inferior mesenteric vein (causing mesenteric ischemia) and veins of the skin. Cerebral venous thrombosis, an uncommon form of stroke, is more common in those with PNH.

==Pathophysiology==
All cells have proteins attached to their membranes, often serving as a mode of communication or signaling between the cell and the surrounding environment. These signaling proteins are physically attached to the cell membrane in various ways, commonly anchored by glycolipids such as glycosyl phosphatidylinositols (GPI). PNH occurs as a result of a defect in the assembling of these glycolipid-protein structures on the surface of blood cells.

The most common defective enzyme in PNH is phosphatidylinositol glycan A (PIGA), one of several enzymes needed to make GPI. The gene that codes for PIGA is located on the X chromosome. As males have only a single X chromosome and, in females, one is silenced through X-inactivation), only one active copy of the gene for PIGA is present in each cell regardless of sex. A mutation in the PIGA gene can lead to the absence of GPI anchors expressed on the cell membrane. When this mutation occurs in a hematopoietic stem cell in the bone marrow, all of the cells it produces will also have the defect.

Several of the proteins that anchor to GPI on the cell membrane are used to protect the cell from destruction by the complement system, and, without these anchors, the cells are more easily targeted by the complement proteins. Although red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are targeted by complement, red blood cells are particularly vulnerable to lysis. The complement system is part of the innate immune system and has a variety of functions, from destroying invading microorganisms by opsonization to direct destabilization by the membrane attack complex. The main proteins that protect blood cells from destruction are decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), which disrupts formation of C3-convertase, and protectin (CD59/MIRL/MAC-IP), which binds the membrane attack complex and prevents C9 from binding to the cell.

The symptoms of esophageal spasm, erectile dysfunction, and abdominal pain are attributed to the fact that hemoglobin released during hemolysis binds with circulating nitric oxide, a substance that is needed to relax smooth muscle. This theory is supported by the fact that these symptoms improve on administration of nitrates or sildenafil (Viagra), which improves the effect of nitric oxide on muscle cells. There is a suspicion that chronic hemolysis causing chronically depleted nitric oxide may lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension (increased pressure in the blood vessels supplying the lung), which in turn puts strain on the heart and causes heart failure.

Historically, the role of sleep and night in this disease (the &quot;nocturnal&quot; component of the name) has been attributed to acidification of the blood at night due to relative hypoventilation and accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood during sleep. This hypothesis has been questioned by researchers who note that not all those with PNH have increased hemolysis during sleep, so it is uncertain how important a role sleep actually plays in this disease.

==Diagnosis==
Blood tests in PNH show changes consistent with intravascular hemolytic anemia: low hemoglobin, raised lactate dehydrogenase, raised bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin), and decreased levels of haptoglobin; there can be raised reticulocytes (immature red cells released by the bone marrow to replace the destroyed cells) if there is no concurrent problem with production of red cells (such as iron deficiency). The direct antiglobulin test (DAT, or direct Coombs&#x27; test) is negative, as the hemolysis of PNH is not caused by antibodies. If the PNH occurs in the setting of known (or suspected) aplastic anemia, abnormal white blood cell counts and decreased platelet counts may be seen at this. In this case, anemia may be caused by insufficient red blood cell production in addition to the hemolysis.

Historically, the sucrose lysis test, in which a patient&#x27;s red blood cells are placed in low-ionic-strength solution and observed for hemolysis, was used for screening. If this was positive, the &quot;Ham&#x27;s acid hemolysis test&quot; (after Dr Thomas Ham, who described the test in 1937) was performed for confirmation. The Ham test involves placing red blood cells in mild acid; a positive result (increased RBC fragility) indicates PNH or Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. This is now an obsolete test for diagnosing PNH due to its low sensitivity and specificity.

Today, the gold standard is flow cytometry for CD55 and CD59 on white and red blood cells. Based on the levels of these cell proteins, erythrocytes may be classified as type I, II, or III PNH cells. Type I cells have normal levels of CD55 and CD59; type II have reduced levels; and type III have absent levels. The fluorescein-labeled proaerolysin (FLAER) test is being used more frequently to diagnose PNH. FLAER binds selectively to the glycophosphatidylinositol anchor and is more accurate in demonstrating a deficit than simply for CD59 or CD55.

===Classification===
PNH is classified by the context under which it is diagnosed:
* &quot;Classic PNH&quot;. Evidence of PNH in the absence of another bone marrow disorder.
* &quot;PNH in the setting of another specified bone marrow disorder&quot; such as aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
* &quot;Subclinical PNH&quot;. PNH abnormalities on flow cytometry without signs of hemolysis.

==Screening==
There are several groups where screening for PNH should be undertaken. These include patients with unexplained thrombosis who
are young, have thrombosis in an unusual site (e.g. intra-abdominal veins, cerebral veins, dermal veins), have any evidence of hemolysis (e.g. a raised LDH), or have a low red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet count. Those who have a diagnosis of aplastic anemia should be screened annually.

==Treatment==

===Acute attacks===
There is disagreement as to whether steroids (such as prednisolone) can decrease the severity of hemolytic crises. Transfusion therapy may be needed; in addition to correcting significant anemia, this suppresses the production of PNH cells by the bone marrow, and indirectly the severity of the hemolysis. Iron deficiency develops with time, due to losses in urine, and may have to be treated if present. Iron therapy can result in more hemolysis as more PNH cells are produced.

===Long-term===
PNH is a chronic condition. In patients with only a small clone and few problems, monitoring of the flow cytometry every six months gives information on the severity and risk of potential complications. Given the high risk of thrombosis in PNH, preventive treatment with warfarin decreases the risk of thrombosis in those with a large clone (50% of white blood cells type III).

Episodes of thrombosis are treated as they would in other patients, but, given that PNH is a persisting underlying cause, it is likely that treatment with warfarin or similar drugs needs to be continued long-term after an episode of thrombosis.

==Epidemiology==
PNH is rare, with an annual rate of 1-2 cases per million. The prognosis without disease-modifying treatment is 10–20 years. Many cases develop in people who have previously been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome. The fact that PNH develops in MDS also explains why there appears to be a higher rate of leukemia in PNH, as MDS can sometimes transform into leukemia or aplastic anemia.

25% of female cases of PNH are discovered during pregnancy. This group has a high rate of thrombosis, and the risk of death of both mother and child are significantly increased (20% and 8% respectively).

==History==
The first description of paroxysmal hemoglobinuria was by the German physician Paul Strübing (Greifswald, 1852–1915) during a lecture in 1881, later published in 1882. Later comprehensive descriptions were made by Ettore Marchiafava and Alessio Nazari in 1911, with further elaborations by Marchiafava in 1928 and Ferdinando Micheli in 1931.

The Dutch physician Enneking coined the term &quot;paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&quot; (or &quot;haemoglobinuria paroxysmalis nocturna&quot; in Latin) in 1928, which has since become the default description.

<doc id="513182" wikidata="Q2936904" url="?curid=513182" title="Tube Bar prank calls">
<text>The Tube Bar prank calls are a series of prank calls made in the mid-1970s to the Tube Bar in Jersey City, New Jersey, in which Jim Davidson and John Elmo would ask &quot;Red&quot;, the proprietor of the bar, if they could speak to various non-existent customers. The gag names given by the pranksters were puns and homophones for often offensive phrases. Recordings of the calls were circulated widely on duplicated cassette tapes and may have been the inspiration for a long running gag in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

==History==
In the mid-1970s, two young men—John Elmo and Jim Davidson; later known collectively as &quot;Bum Bar Bastards&quot;, or &quot;The BBB&quot;—began calling the Tube Bar located at Journal Square in Jersey City, New Jersey. The bar was owned by heavyweight boxer Louis &quot;Red&quot; Deutsch, and most of the time Deutsch himself answered the calls. During a call, the pranksters would ask Deutsch to call out fictitious, pun-like or homophonous names such as &quot;Pepe Roni&quot; (&quot;pepperoni&quot;), &quot;Hal Jalykakick&quot; (&quot;how&#x27;d you like a kick&quot;), &quot;Phil Mypockets&quot; (&quot;fill my pockets&quot;), &quot;Al Coholic&quot; (&quot;alcoholic&quot;) or &quot;Mike Hunt&quot; (&quot;my cunt&quot;). Most of the time, Deutsch would call out the names, unaware that he was being subjected to a prank.

At times, Deutsch would catch on, and when he did, he would respond with extreme hostility, shouting profanity, obscene sexual references (usually involving the caller&#x27;s mother), and threats of physical harm at the caller. He would utter threats such as, &quot;I&#x27;ll break dem bones on you, on your feet, you&#x27;ll never be able to walk for the rest of your life!&quot; as well as &quot;I&#x27;ll cut your belly open and show you all the black stuff you got in there!&quot; Sometimes Deutsch would offer the two pranksters a reward of $100 or $500 if they would show up at his bar in person, but they never took him up on the offer, in one case even counter-offering him $5.

By the 1980s, dubbed cassette tapes of the calls were shared between staff of several major league sports teams such as the New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers and Miami Dolphins. These dubbed copies of the calls were unofficially referred to as the &quot;Red Tapes&quot; or &quot;Tube Bar Tapes&quot;. The popularity of these prank calls spread throughout respective sports leagues, branching out to sports reporters and then into the larger media world.

==Bar location and details==

The Tube Bar itself was located at 12 Tube Concourse, Jersey City, adjacent to the entrance of the Journal Square PATH station and across the way from the Landmark Loew&#x27;s Jersey Theatre. The small complex of commercial storefronts that included the Tube Bar was demolished in early 2009 to make way for the 1 Journal Square development project.

==Legacy==
* Animator and cartoonist Matt Groening has described himself as a fan of the tapes, particularly the &quot;Garden Grove calls&quot;. His series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; features a running joke of Bart Simpson making prank calls to barkeeper Moe Szyslak, asking to speak to patrons with joke names. Groening describes the similarity between these jokes and the Tube Bar calls as &quot;creative synchronicity.&quot; Co-developer Sam Simon told &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in 2007 that the jokes are a &quot;homage to or parody of the classic Red tapes&quot;.
* During the 1980s, several different record labels released various edits of the tapes on CD, LP and cassette tape before the Bum Bar Bastards came forward in the 1990s to claim copyright of the tapes and officially release their version.

* In the 1990s, on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Billy West would often imitate Red, usually after Stern would ask Billy a question, but referring to him as &quot;Red.&quot;

<text>Robert Lee Curbeam Jr. (born March 5, 1962) is a former NASA astronaut and captain in the United States Navy. He currently holds the record for the most spacewalks during a single spaceflight, accomplished during the STS-116 mission, when Curbeam completed four spacewalks.

==Education==
Curbeam graduated from Woodlawn High School, Baltimore County, Maryland in 1980. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the United States Naval Academy in 1984, a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School in 1990, and a master&#x27;s degree in Astronautical Engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School in 1991.

Curbeam was named Fighter Wing One Radar Intercept Officer of the Year in 1989 and received the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School Best Developmental Thesis (DT-II) Award.

==Naval career==
Upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy, Curbeam commenced Naval Flight Officer training in 1984. In 1986 he reported to Fighter Squadron 11 (VF-11) and made overseas deployments on board the aircraft carrier . During his tour in VF-11, he also attended the Navy Fighter Weapons School.

Upon graduation of United States Naval Test Pilot School in December 1991, he reported to the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate, where he was the project officer for the F-14A/B Air-to-Ground Weapons Separation Program. In August 1994, he returned to the U.S. Naval Academy as an instructor in the Weapons and Systems Engineering Department.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in December 1994, Curbeam reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995. After completing a year of training and evaluation, he was assigned to the Computer Support Branch in the Astronaut Office. He is a veteran of three space flights: STS-85 in 1997, STS-98 in 2001, STS-116 in 2006, and has logged over 901 hours in space, including over 45 hours during three spacewalks.

Between the first two flights, Curbeam was a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) responsible for relaying all voice communication between Mission Control and crews aboard the Space Shuttle and International Space Station. After his second flight, he also was the CAPCOM Branch Chief. During the spring of 2002, he was Deputy Associate Administrator for Safety and Mission Assurance, at NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.

===Spaceflight experience===
STS-85 (August 7–19, 1997) was a 12-day mission during which the crew deployed and retrieved the CRISTA-SPAS payload, operated the Japanese Manipulator Flight Demonstration (MFD) robotic arm, studied changes in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and tested technology destined for use on the future International Space Station.

STS-98 (February 7–20, 2001) continued the task of building and enhancing the International Space Station by delivering the U.S. laboratory module Destiny. The Shuttle spent seven days docked to the station while Destiny was attached. In helping to complete its assembly, Curbeam logged over 19 EVA hours in 3 space walks.
STS-116 (December 9–22, 2006) was a mission to the International Space Station. The mission involved the installation of a new truss segment and the rewiring of the station&#x27;s electrical system. During the mission, Curbeam was the EVA crewmember for the record-breaking four spacewalks, three of which were conducted along with astronaut Christer Fuglesang (Sweden) and one along with astronaut Sunita Williams.

==Post-NASA career==
On December 7, 2007, NASA announced that Curbeam had chosen to leave NASA after 13 years, to pursue a job in the private sector. He presently works for Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems as the Senior Director of Business Development in Virginia.

Having played lacrosse as a student athlete at the Naval Academy, Curbeam became an assistant coach for the boys lacrosse team at Clear Lake High School in Houston, Texas. In 2011, Curbeam led Clear Lake to the semifinal match of the Texas High School Lacrosse League South District Championship game.

<doc id="513210" wikidata="Q736619" url="?curid=513210" title="Expo Line (SkyTrain)">
<text>The Expo Line is the oldest line of the SkyTrain rapid transit system in the Metro Vancouver region of British Columbia, Canada. The line is owned and operated by BC Rapid Transit Company, a subsidiary of TransLink, and links the cities of Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster and Surrey.

The line was originally known only as &quot;the SkyTrain&quot; from its inception in 1985 until 2002, as it was the system&#x27;s only line during this time. In 2002, after the opening of the system&#x27;s second line, the Millennium Line, the original line was given the name &quot;Expo Line&quot;. The new name was in recognition of Expo 86 (the world&#x27;s fair that Vancouver hosted in 1986) as the transit system had been built in large part as a showcase and an attraction for that fair.

==Route==
The line is elevated from Stadium–Chinatown to New Westminster stations, except for short at-grade sections between Nanaimo and Joyce–Collingwood stations in East Vancouver, and around the SkyTrain yards at Edmonds station in Burnaby.

The line travels underground for a short stretch between New Westminster and Columbia stations. Just east of Columbia is a junction, one branch of which crosses the Fraser River, via the SkyBridge, and is elevated for the rest of its run through Surrey, with King George as its terminus station. The other branch continues through New Westminster, first through a tunnel and then elevated until it terminates at Production Way–University in Burnaby.

From just west of Nanaimo station all the way to New Westminster station, the Expo Line follows BC Electric&#x27;s former Central Park Line, which carried interurbans between Vancouver and New Westminster from 1890 to the early 1950s.

==History==
===ICTS demonstration project (1983)===
What is now known as SkyTrain began as a demonstration project to showcase the newly developed linear induction propulsion technology to Vancouver and other prospective cities throughout the world. Although Toronto&#x27;s Scarborough RT was completed before the Expo Line in 1985, the ICTS demonstration was the first system to use SkyTrain technology. The Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS) demonstration was built using the Advanced Rapid Transit (ART) technology developed by the Urban Transportation Development Corporation (now part of Bombardier). Construction began on March 1, 1982, and was completed in early 1983. The demonstration project consisted of just one station and about one kilometre of guideway with no switches. This original station was not &quot;named&quot; during this time as it was the only station, but then in 1985 opened as Main Street station.

As it was a showcase station, Main Street had a different initial design from other stations on the Expo Line that came after it. For example, glass was featured in the station&#x27;s design, but was missing from other original Expo Line stations, except Stadium station (now Stadium–Chinatown) since it was tied to the Expo grounds. Having preceded other stations on the line by three years, Main Street–Science World was visibly older, and signs of rust and wear were showing before extensive renovations to the station were completed in 2014.

The guideway for the showcase line was a straight section east of the station running over Terminal Avenue. It ended across from where the former Brussels Chocolate factory once was, located on Terminal. There was no guideway west of the station as the track ended immediately at the west end of the platform where the Vancity head office now stands.

The ICTS guideway was built differently from the rest of the Expo Line. The columns were different especially with how they are joined with the guideway. The walkway between the two tracks is of a different but also inferior design from the Expo Line, and it is showing signs of rust that come with the older age of the guideway.

There was only a single two-car train running on the north westbound track. After passengers boarded, it ran east toward the end of the test guideway. At the eastern end, the train would stop and after a pause, reverse directions and return to the station. Since there were no switches, only the northern track was used and the train would run back and forth on the same track. There was also a single car mock up parked on the south platform, what is now the eastbound platform. This car was not operational. The two-car train and single car mock up were of a different and unique design to all the production Mark I trains. The red tail lights were located on the bottom beside the headlights, instead of at the top. The end door and window were of a different design. As well, there were black panels on either side of the door, that are not found in the production trains. The whereabouts of these trains is unknown.

The ICTS guideway was retrofitted during the construction of the Millennium Line to accommodate the heavier weight Mark II cars. This was done by adding additional steel-reinforced concrete beams to the columns where they support the guideway. These are clearly visible when driving or walking on Terminal Avenue under the guideway. With the exception of the original ICTS guideway, no other part of the Expo Line required retrofitting for strength in order to accommodate the Mark II cars.

After the 1983 preview closed, the single pair of demonstration cars were sent back to Ontario, which have since served as test trains for the UTDC. The subsequent trains ordered for Expo were designed slightly differently from the demo train set because of issues such as a lack of standardized parts, and the wish to introduce automated computer technology to drive the trains.

===Phase I: Waterfront to New Westminster (1985)===
Following the demonstration project, construction of the first phase of the Expo Line between Vancouver and New Westminster got under way in mid-1983, with guideway construction nearing completion by late 1984, and station construction beginning in early 1985. On December 11, 1985, SkyTrain began providing free weekend service, with full revenue service opening on January 3, 1986. Phase I was in length, starting at Waterfront station and terminating at New Westminster station. The newly built system had limited Sunday service until 1990, and shorter revenue hours during weekdays than SkyTrain&#x27;s current revenue schedule as of 2010.

During Expo 86, special shuttle trains ran from a third track at Stadium station, where there was a connection to the monorail serving the main site of the world&#x27;s fair, to the Canadian pavilion at Waterfront station. Waterfront station was divided in two, with a fence going down the centre of the platform. One side of the platform was used exclusively for the shuttles, and was accessible only from the Canada Place entrance, while the other side was only for revenue service and was only accessible from the main entrance to the east.

For the first few years of revenue service until the early 1990s, all trains were lined with carpeting, and train doors did not open automatically but rather at the push of buttons on the interior and exterior of the trains when docked in stations. This on-demand system reflected the small-scale ridership SkyTrain had before Vancouver experienced a major population boost. Due to an inability to steadily maintain the carpeting, wax floors of the same colour were installed between 1992 and 1993.

In the planning of the original line, a proposed future station at Boundary Road and Kingsway, or &quot;Boundary station&quot; was to be included to serve employees of BCTel. However, the proposal was scrapped largely due to a fear of the station attracting crime to the neighbourhood and noise-level concerns.

===Phase II: Columbia and Scott Road stations (1989–1990)===
The first extension, or Phase II, was split into two parts. Construction began in 1987, with Columbia station opening on February 14, 1989, adding of guideway in the City of New Westminster. The second segment opened on March 16, 1990, and included Scott Road station in Surrey, crossing the Fraser River via the purpose-built, cable-stayed &quot;SkyBridge&quot;, adding to the line.

===Phase III: Surrey City Centre extension (1994)===

Construction of a second extension, or Phase III, began in late 1991 and opened on March 28, 1994, adding three stations in Surrey&#x27;s City Centre district in Whalley. Private partnerships with surrounding businesses in the community led to the then-new stations having a different appearance from the rest of the Expo Line. This extension set one of the Expo Line&#x27;s current eastern terminus at King George station. It also added Gateway and Surrey Central stations.

===Branch to Production Way–University (2016)===
In 2002, the Millennium Line opened and shared the same track alignment with the Expo Line from Waterfront station in Downtown Vancouver to Columbia station in New Westminster. At Columbia, the two lines diverged, with the Expo Line crossing the Fraser River towards Surrey City Centre and the Millennium Line entering a short tunnel towards northeastern New Westminster and North Burnaby.

In late 2016, the SkyTrain system underwent a service change in preparation for the opening of the Evergreen Extension, resulting in a new branch of the Expo Line serving four stations that were originally built for the Millennium Line. On October 22, 2016, this branch began service from Columbia to Sapperton, Braid, Lougheed Town Centre, and Production Way–University stations, while the Millennium Line began running between VCC–Clark and Lougheed Town Centre (and later, Lafarge Lake–Douglas) stations, effectively ending nearly 15 years of Millennium Line service between Waterfront and Braid. The main Expo Line service between Waterfront and King George stations remained in place, operating at the same frequency levels.

== Technology ==
The Expo Line uses a fleet of Innovia ART and Innovia Metro trains built by Bombardier Transportation (now Alstom). Like the Millennium Line, the trains are powered by linear induction motors rather than the conventional electric (rotary) motors used on the Canada Line. Expo Line trains are operated by the same SelTrac automated train control system used in the rest of the SkyTrain network.

The 2023 fleet consists of six-car Mark I trains using the Innovia ART 100, two- and four-car Mark II trains (operating in coupled pairs of two cars) using the Innovia ART 200, and four-car Mark III trains using the Innovia Metro 300.

==Expansions==
===Capacity upgrades===
Before the purchase of some Mark II vehicles in 2009, the Expo line was operating at capacity while carrying 12,000 passengers per hour per direction (pphpd). Its ultimate design capacity was 19,400 pphpd using six-car Mark I trains operating at 93-second headways. However, exclusively operating a fleet of five-car trains would increase the capacity to 25,700 pphpd if Mark II trains were used. 

Several options have been considered over the system&#x27;s history to increase capacity on the Expo Line, including:
* Purchasing middle &quot;C&quot; cars to use with some of the Mark II trainsets to maximize available platform space. Current platforms can fit six-car Mark I trains and five-car Mark II/III trains. With its current fleet, TransLink can only create two-car and four-car Mark II trains (2 or 2+2). By adding a middle &quot;C&quot; car to some Mark II couplets to create three-car trainsets, longer five-car Mark II trains could have been used (2+3).
* Reducing SkyTrain operating headways to 75 seconds per train, down from the 108 seconds used in the early 2010s, which would have allowed for more trains to operate at peak times.
* After using longer trains and running trains at 75-second headways, the next option would be to lengthen the station platforms beyond to accommodate even longer trains. This expansion option would be the most expensive as it would require heavy construction at all Expo Line stations.
In late 2020, TransLink ordered 41 Alstom Mark V trainsets in five-car configurations. These trains are based on the previous Mark III trains; however, each train will have an additional carriage and will have more internal space. Each five-car Mark V train will be able to hold 672 passengers regularly, both seated and standing, with a potential crush capacity of up to 1,207 passengers. The order will provide for both an increase in the number of trainsets and ultimately a total replacement of the mid-1980s to early 1990s Mark I rolling stock. Construction will be required at some stations to accommodate the length of the Mark V trainsets, but no service interruptions will be necessary.

===Surrey–Langley extension===
The Surrey Langley SkyTrain Project is a elevated extension of the Expo Line from King George SkyTrain Station in Surrey to 203 Street in Langley City, routed mostly along Fraser Highway. Construction began in November 2024 and was anticipated to be completed in 2029. The extension will be built in one phase (a change from earlier plans) and include the following eight stations:

The 2008 &quot;Provincial Transit Plan&quot; included a extension from King George station in Surrey east to Guildford, then along 152 Street to Fraser Highway and southeast to 168 Street; a further extension to Willowbrook Shopping Centre in Langley Township was also included in the plan. In 2011, as part of phase 2 of the Surrey Rapid Transit Study, different possibilities were examined for expanding rapid transit along multiple corridors in the South of Fraser region. In addition to SkyTrain, light rail and bus rapid transit were also in consideration. In 2016, TransLink was building dual business cases for LRT and SkyTrain technologies.

In November 2018, following a change of government in Surrey, the Metro Vancouver Mayors&#x27; Council voted to indefinitely suspend the at-grade Surrey light rail project in favour of extending the Expo Line from King George station to Langley City. This extension would be long and add eight stations to the Expo Line. The $1.65billion in funding that was earmarked for the light rail project was intended to be used to construct part of this extension to Langley but was insufficient to fund the entire extension, with $1.9billion more needed to complete the project. The existing funding would extend the line to Fleetwood in Surrey and add 4 new stations, terminating at 166th Street.

On July 25, 2019, the Mayors&#x27; Council voted to extend the Expo Line to Fleetwood using the existing funds. The council also voted to proceed with preparing a detailed business case for the full Surrey–Langley SkyTrain extension, which was expected to be completed by early 2020. If approved by the end of the third quarter of 2020, construction would have started in early 2022, with revenue service to Fleetwood projected to have started in late 2025.

On October 8, 2020, during the 2020 provincial election campaign, the BC NDP pledged to work with senior levels of government to obtain the $1.5billion needed to complete the full extension to Langley.

On July 9, 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the federal government would provide up to $1.3billion to build the SkyTrain extension to Langley in a single phase. At that time, the cost of the project was estimated between $3.8 and $3.95billion in total, more than $650million in excess of the earlier $3.13billion estimate from TransLink, with the rest of the funding being split between TransLink and the provincial government. The full extension to Langley was planned to be constructed as a single project, rather than in two phases, and open in 2028. In July 2022, the provincial government officially approved this one-phase plan. Procurement for contractors was slated to start later in 2022, with major construction expected to begin in 2024. On March 7, 2024, the provincial Ministry of Transportation announced that SkyLink Guideway Partners had been selected to build the elevated guideway for the extension. On August 15, 2024 the Ministry of Transportation stated that the extension was now expected to be completed in 2029, with an estimated cost of $6 billion.

<text>The pedal steel guitar is a console-type of steel guitar with pedals and knee levers that change the pitch of certain strings to enable playing more varied and complex music than other steel guitar designs. Like all steel guitars, it can play unlimited glissandi (sliding notes) and deep vibrati—characteristics it shares with the human voice. Pedal steel is most commonly associated with country music and Hawaiian music.

Pedals were added to a lap steel guitar in 1940, allowing the performer to play a major scale without moving the bar and also to push the pedals while striking a chord, making passing notes slur or bend up into harmony with existing notes. The latter creates a unique sound that has been popular in country and western music— a sound not previously possible on steel guitars before pedals were added.

From its first use in Hawaii in the 19th century, the steel guitar sound became popular in the United States in the first half of the 20th century and spawned a family of instruments designed specifically to be played with the guitar in a horizontal position, also known as &quot;Hawaiian-style&quot;. The first instrument in this chronology was the Hawaiian guitar also called a lap steel; next was a lap steel with a resonator to make it louder, first made by National and Dobro Corporation. The electric guitar pickup was invented in 1934, allowing steel guitars to be heard equally with other instruments. Electronic amplification enabled subsequent development of the electrified lap steel, then the console steel, and finally the pedal steel guitar.

Playing the pedal steel requires simultaneous coordination of both hands, both feet and both knees (knees operate levers on medial and lateral sides of each knee); the only other instrument with similar requirements is the American reed organ. Pioneers in the development of the instrument include Buddy Emmons, Jimmy Day, Bud Isaacs, Zane Beck, and Paul Bigsby. In addition to American country music, the instrument is used in sacred music in the eastern and southern United States (called Sacred Steel), jazz, and Nigerian Music.

==Early history and evolution==

In the late 19th century, Spanish guitars were introduced in the Hawaiian Islands by European sailors and Mexican &quot;vaqueros&quot;. Hawaiians did not embrace the standard guitar tuning that had been in use upon their introduction. Rather, they re-tuned the guitars to make them sound a major chord when all six strings were strummed, now known as an &quot;open tuning&quot;. The term for this is &quot;slack-key&quot; because certain strings were &quot;slackened&quot; to achieve it. To change chords, they used some smooth object, usually a piece of pipe or metal, sliding it over the strings to the fourth or fifth position, easily playing a three-chord song. It is physically difficult to hold a steel bar against the strings while holding the guitar against the body and the Hawaiians laid the guitar across the lap and played it while sitting. Playing this way became popular throughout Hawaii and spread internationally.

==Electrific amplification==

Hawaiian lap steel guitars were not loud enough to compete with other instruments, a problem that many inventors were trying to remedy. In Los Angeles in the 1920s, a steel guitar player named George Beauchamp saw some inventions which added a horn, like a megaphone, to steel guitars to make them louder. Beauchamp became interested, and went to a shop near his home to learn more. The shop was owned by a violin repairman named John Dopyera. Dopyera and his brother Rudy, showed Beauchamp a prototype of theirs which looked like a big Victrola horn attached to a guitar, but it was not successful. Their next attempt yielded some success with a resonator cone, resembling a large metal loudspeaker, attached under the bridge of the guitar. Buoyed by their success, Beauchamp joined the Dopyera brothers in forming a company to pursue their invention. The new resonator invention was promoted at a lavish party in Los Angeles and demonstrated by the well-known Hawaiian steel player Sol Hoopii. An investor wrote a check for $12,000 that very night.

A factory was built to manufacture metal-body guitars with the new resonators. Money problems and disagreements followed, and the Doperyas won a legal battle against Beauchamp over the company, then went on their own to form &quot;the Dobro Corporation&quot;, Dobro being an acronym for DOpyera and BROthers. Beauchamp was out of a job. He had been thinking about an &quot;electric guitar&quot; for years, and at least part of the dispute with the Dopyeras was over him spending too much time on the electrification idea and not enough on improving the resonator guitar. Beauchamp enrolled in electronics courses and, for his first effort, he made a single-string guitar out of a 2x4 piece of lumber and experimented with phonograph pickups, but had no success. He eventually came up with the idea of using two horseshoe magnets encircling the guitar strings like a bracelet, and six small metal rods wrapped with wire to concentrate the magnetic field (one under each guitar string).

When connected to an electronic amplifier and loudspeaker, it worked. He enlisted the aid of a skilled craftsman to fashion a guitar neck and body to connect to his device. The final construct, he thought, resembled a frying pan, and that is what the instrument was nicknamed. He applied for patent June 2, 1934 and received it on August 10, 1937. Beauchamp asked a nearby engineer named Adolph Rickenbacker to help manufacture the product and together they founded a company first named &quot;Ro-Pat-In&quot;, soon changed to &quot;ElectroString&quot;. The guitar brand was called &quot;Rickenbacker&quot; because they thought the name was easier to pronounce than &quot;Beauchamp&quot; (pronounced Beecham) and because Adolph&#x27;s cousin, Eddie Rickenbacker, an American pilot and WWI flying ace, was a well-known name in the U.S. at that time.

In 1931, the Great Depression was at its worst, and people were not buying guitars; in addition, the patent office delayed on the application, in part because they had no category for the invention—was it a musical instrument or an electrical device? Electrostring&#x27;s competitors infringed on the patent, but the owners did not have the money to litigate the infringements. Beauchamp was ultimately deprived of economic benefit for his invention because his competitors rapidly improved on it making his specific patent obsolete. Electrostring&#x27;s most successful product was the Hawaiian guitar (lap steel) A22 &quot;Frying Pan&quot;, the first electrified instrument of any kind — made with a metal body, smaller than a traditional Spanish guitar, to be played on the musician&#x27;s lap.

Two additional breakthroughs emerged: One, the guitar amplifier, which had to be purchased in order to use the invention; and two, perhaps unrealized at the time, that electrified guitars no longer had to have the traditional guitar shape—this profoundly influenced electric guitar designs forever forward.

==Lap steel==
The first lap steels had a smaller body, but still retained a guitar-like shape. Instrument makers rapidly began making them into a rectangular block of wood with an electric pickup, the precursor of the pedal steel. According to music writer Michael Ross, the first electrified stringed instrument on a commercial recording was a western swing tune by Bob Dunn in 1935. He recorded with Milton Brown and his Musical Brownies. Brown has been called &quot;The father of western swing&quot; The inherent limitation of the lap steel was its constraint to very limited chords not changeable during a performance without re-tuning. For that reason, scores of different tunings are available for lap steel players.

==Lap steel becomes console steel==

The next problem to be dealt with was the need to play with different voicings on the same guitar; i.e., the way the strings are tuned. The only way to accomplish this at the time was the addition of a duplicate neck and strings on the same instrument, tuned differently. Players continued to add more necks, eventually getting up to four. This meant a bigger and heavier instrument, now called a &quot;console&quot; which necessitated putting it on a stand or legs rather than the performer&#x27;s lap. Noel Boggs, a lap steel player with Bob Wills, received the first steel guitar made by instrument maker Leo Fender in 1953. Fender relied on prominent performers to field test his instruments. Boggs was one of the first players to switch to a different neck during a solo. Leon McAuliffe, composer of &quot;Steel Guitar Rag&quot;, also played with Bob Wills, and used a multi-neck steel guitar. When Wills said his well-known tag line, &quot;Take it away, Leon&quot;, he was referring to McAuliffe. A Fender Stringmaster triple-neck console steel was heard in a number one hit song in 1959,&quot;Sleep Walk&quot;, a steel guitar instrumental by Santo and Johnny, the Farina Brothers.

==Console steel becomes pedal steel==

The expense of building multiple necks on the same instrument made them unaffordable for most players, and a more sophisticated solution was needed. At this point, the goal was simply to create a pedal that would change the pitch of all the strings at once to emulate a second neck. In 1939, a guitar called the &quot;Electradaire&quot; featured a pedal controlling a solenoid, triggering an electrical apparatus to change the tension on the strings. This was not successful. That same year, bandleader Alvino Rey worked with a machinist to design pedals to change the pitch of strings but was without success. The Harlan Brothers of Indianapolis created the &quot;Multi-Kord&quot; with a universal pedal that could fairly easily be configured to adjust the pitch of any or all strings, but was extremely hard to push when tensioning all strings at once. The Gibson Guitar Company introduced the &quot;Electraharp&quot; in 1940, which featured pedals radially oriented from a single axis at the instrument&#x27;s left rear leg. The instrument was not popular and only 43 were sold before production was halted, but the U.S. entry into World War II played a part in lack of demand. After WW II, Gibson redesigned and reintroduced the Electraharp and Bud Isaacs used one on the song &quot;Big Blue Diamonds&quot; for King Records. The most successful pedal system from the various contenders was designed about 1948 by Paul Bigsby, a motorcycle shop foreman and racer who also invented the commercially successful Spanish guitar vibrato tailpiece. Bigsby put pedals on a rack between the two front legs of the steel guitar. The pedals operated a mechanical linkage to apply tension to raise the pitch of the strings.

Bigsby built guitars incorporating his design for the foremost steel players of the day, including Speedy West, Noel Boggs, and Bud Isaacs, but Bigsby was a one-man operation working out of his garage at age 56, and not capable of keeping up with demand. One of Bigsby&#x27;s first guitars was used on &quot;Candy Kisses&quot; in 1949 by Eddie Kirk. The second model Bigsby made went to Speedy West, who used it extensively.

==Pedal steel in country music: the birth of a new sound==

In 1953, Bud Isaacs received one of Bigsby&#x27;s new creations, a double-neck steel which featured pedals to change the pitch of only two strings. Isaacs was the first to push the pedal while notes were still sounding. Other steel players strictly avoided doing this, because it was considered &quot;un-Hawaiian&quot;. When Isaacs first used the setup on the 1953 recording of Webb Pierce&#x27;s song &quot;Slowly&quot;, he pushed the pedal while playing a chord, so notes could be heard bending up from below into the existing chord to harmonize with the other strings, creating a stunning effect which had not been possible with the older (non-pedal) lap steels. Of this recording of &quot;Slowly&quot;, steel guitar virtuoso Lloyd Green said, &quot;This fellow, Bud Isaacs, had thrown a new tool into musical thinking about the steel with the advent of this record that still reverberates to this day.&quot; It was the birth of the future sound of country music and caused a virtual revolution among steel players who wanted to duplicate it.

Also in the 1950s, steel guitar hall-of-famer Zane Beck added knee levers to the pedal steel guitar capable of bending notes downward. The player can move each knee either right, left or up (depending on the model) triggering different pitch changes. The levers function basically the same as foot pedals, and may be used alone, in combination with the other knee, or more commonly, in combination with one or two foot pedals. They were first added to Ray Noren&#x27;s console steel. Initially, the knee levers just lowered the pitch, but in later years with refinements, could raise or lower pitch.

==Buddy Emmons&#x27; contributions to pedal steel==

When &quot;Slowly&quot; was released, Bigsby was in the process of building a guitar for steel virtuoso Buddy Emmons. Emmons heard Isaacs&#x27; performance on the song, and told Bigsby to make his guitar setup to split the function of Isaacs&#x27; single pedal into two pedals, each controlling a different string. This gave the advantages of making chords without having to slant or move the bar, e.g., minors and suspended chords. Jimmy Day, another prominent steel player of the day, did the same thing, but reversed which strings were affected by the two pedals. This prompted future manufacturers to ask customers if they wanted a &quot;Day&quot; or an &quot;Emmons&quot; setup. In 1957, Emmons partnered with guitarist/machinist Harold &quot;Shot&quot; Jackson to form the Sho-Bud company, the first company devoted solely to pedal steel guitar manufacture.

Emmons made other innovations to the steel guitar, adding two additional strings (known as &quot;chromatics&quot;) and a third pedal, changes which have been adopted as standard in the modern-day E9 instrument. The additional strings allow the player to play a major scale without moving the bar. He also developed and patented a mechanism to raise and lower the pitch of a string on a steel guitar and return to the original pitch without going out of tune. The Sho-Bud instruments of the day had all the latest features: 10 strings, the third pedal, and the knee levers.

==Modern pedal steel==

 The pedal steel continues to be an instrument in transition. In the United States, as of 2017, the E9 neck is more common, but most pedal steels still have two necks. The C6 is typically used for western swing music and the E9 neck is more often used for country music. The different necks have distinctly different voicings. The C6 has a wider pitch range than the E9, mostly on the lower notes.
Certain players prefer different setups regarding which function the pedals and levers perform, and which string tuning is preferred. In the early 1970s, musician Tom Bradshaw coined the term &quot;copedent&quot; ( ), a portmanteau of &quot;chord-pedal-arrangement&quot;. Often represented in table form, it is a way of specifying the instrument&#x27;s tuning, pedal and lever setup, string gauges and string windings.

There are proponents of a &quot;universal tuning&quot; to combine the two most popular modern tunings (E9 and C6) into a single 12 or 14-string neck that encompasses some features of each. It was developed by Maurice Anderson and later modified by Larry Bell. By lowering the C6 tuning a half-step to make it a B6, many commonalities with the E9 tuning are achieved on the same neck and it is called the E9/B6 tuning.

==Use in non-traditional genres==

The pedal steel is most commonly associated with American country music, but it is also sometimes heard in jazz, sacred music, popular music, nu jazz, and African music.
In the United States in the 1930s, during the steel guitar&#x27;s wave of popularity, the instrument was introduced into the &quot;House of God&quot;, a branch of an African-American Pentecostal denomination, based primarily in Nashville and Indianapolis. The sound bore no resemblance to typical American country music. The steel guitar was embraced by the congregation and often took the place of an organ. The first documented use of a pedal (rather than lap) steel in this tradition was in 1952, but it did not become
common until the early 1970s. This musical genre, known as &quot;Sacred Steel&quot; was largely unknown until, in the 1980s, a minister&#x27;s son named Robert Randolph took up the instrument as a teenager, and has popularized it and received critical acclaim as a musician. Neil Strauss, writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, called Randolph &quot;one of the most original and talented pedal steel guitarists of his generation.

The pedal steel guitar became a signature component of Nigerian Juju music in the late 1970s. Nigerian bandleader King Sunny Adé featured pedal steel guitar in his 17 piece band, which, wrote &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Jon Pareles, introduces &quot;a twang or two from American blues and country&quot; Norwegian jazz trumpeter Nils Petter Molvaer, considered a pioneer of Future jazz (a fusion of jazz and electronic music), released the album &quot;Switch&quot;, which features the pedal steel guitar.

<text>The lap steel guitar, also known as a Hawaiian guitar or Lap Slide Guitar, is a type of steel guitar without pedals that is typically played with the instrument in a horizontal position across the performer&#x27;s lap. Unlike the usual manner of playing a traditional acoustic guitar, in which the performer&#x27;s fingertips press the strings against frets, the pitch of a steel guitar is changed by pressing a polished steel bar against plucked strings (from which the name &quot;steel guitar&quot; derives). Though the instrument does not have frets, it displays markers that resemble them. Lap steels may differ markedly from one another in external appearance, depending on whether they are acoustic or electric, but in either case, do not have pedals, distinguishing them from pedal steel guitars.

The steel guitar was the first &quot;foreign&quot; musical instrument to gain a foothold in American pop music. It originated in the Hawaiian Islands about 1885, popularized by an Oahu youth named Joseph Kekuku, who became known for playing a traditional guitar by laying it across his lap and sliding a piece of metal against the strings to change the pitch. The instrument&#x27;s distinctive portamento sound, characterized by a smooth gliding between notes, became popular throughout the islands. American popular culture became fascinated with Hawaiian music during the first half of the twentieth century – to the degree of becoming a musical fad. Americans were curious about the lap steel instrument featured in its performance, and came to refer to it as a &quot;Hawaiian guitar&quot;, and the horizontal playing position as &quot;Hawaiian style&quot;. Hawaiian music began its assimilation into American popular music in the 1910s, but with English lyrics; a combination Hawaiians called &quot;hapa haole&quot; (half-white). In the 1930s, the invention of electric amplification for the lap steel was a milestone in its evolution. It meant that the instrument could be heard equally with other instruments, that it no longer needed a resonance chamber to produce its sound, and that electrified lap steels could be manufactured in any shape (even a rectangular block), with little or no resemblance to a traditional guitar.

In the early twentieth century Hawaiian music and the steel guitar began to meld into other musical styles, including blues, jazz, gospel, country music and, particularly, the country music sub-genres Western swing, honky-tonk, and bluegrass. Lap steel pioneers include Sol Hoopii, Bob Dunn, Jerry Byrd, Don Helms, Bud Isaacs, Leon McAuliffe, Josh Graves, Pete Kirby, and Darick Campbell.

Conceptually, a lap steel guitar may be likened to playing a guitar with one finger (the bar). This abstraction illustrates one of the instrument&#x27;s major limitations: its constraint to a single chord that is not changeable during a performance without re-tuning the instrument. An early solution was to build lap steel guitars with two or more necks, each providing a separate set of differently-tuned strings on a single instrument. The performer&#x27;s hands could move to a different neck at will. Although in the early 1940s, elite players recorded and performed with these multi-neck guitars, most musicians could not afford them. The problem was addressed in 1940 by adding pedals to the lap steel to change the pitch of certain strings easily, making more complex chords available on the same neck. By 1952, this invention revolutionized how the instrument was played, in many ways making it virtually a new instrument, known as a &quot;pedal steel&quot;. An overwhelming majority of lap steel players adopted the pedal design, and, as a result, the lap steel became largely obsolete by the late 1950s, with only pockets of devotees in country and Hawaiian music remaining.

==Early history==

Spanish guitars were introduced into the Hawaiian Islands as early as the 1830s. The Hawaiians did not embrace the standard guitar tuning that had been in use for centuries. They re-tuned the guitars to make a chord when all the strings were sounded together, known as an &quot;open tuning&quot;. This was called &quot;slack-key&quot;, known in Hawaiian as &quot;kī hōʻalu&quot;, because certain strings were &quot;slackened&quot; to achieve it. Hawaiians learned to play fingerstyle this way, creating melodies over the full resonant tones of the open strings, and the genre became known as slack-key guitar. About 1885, after guitar strings made of steel became available, Joseph Kekuku, on the island of Oahu developed and popularized playing an open tuning while seated with the guitar across his knees while pressing a steel bar against the strings. Following Kekuku&#x27;s lead, other Hawaiians began playing in this new manner, with the guitar laid across the lap, instead of in the traditional way of holding the instrument against the body. Once the horizontal style became popular throughout the islands, the technique spread internationally, and was referred to (typically outside of Hawaii) as &quot;Hawaiian style&quot;.

Hawaiian music, with the sound of the steel guitar as a marked featured of it, became a popular musical preoccupation or fad in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1916, recordings of indigenous Hawaiian music outsold all other U.S. musical genres. This popularity initiated the manufacture of guitars designed specifically to be played horizontally. The archetypal lap steel guitar is the acoustic Hawaiian guitar. Despite incorporating a resonant chamber in their body, these early acoustic versions of the instrument were not loud enough relative to other instruments. However, in the early 1930s a steel guitarist named George Beauchamp invented the electric guitar pickup. Electrification not only allowed the lap steel guitar to be heard better, but it also meant that their resonance chambers were no longer essential, or even required. The result was that steel guitars could be manufactured in any shape – even in the form of a rectangular block bearing little or no resemblance to the traditional guitar shape. This led to table-like instruments in a metal frame on legs called &quot;console steels&quot;.

==Types of lap steel guitars==

There are three categories of lap steel guitars:
* Acoustic lap steel guitars: These are traditional acoustic steel-string acoustic guitars modified to be played on the performer&#x27;s lap. The modification is to raise the strings higher off the fingerboard than a traditional guitar, which can be done by inserting an adapter on the instrument&#x27;s bridge and its nut. This prevents the steel bar from hitting against the frets.
*Dobro-type guitars or National guitars: These are typically acoustic steel guitars with a large aluminum cone under the bridge, called a resonator, that increases volume output. Wood-body resonator guitars are called &quot;Dobros&quot; and steel bodied ones are called &quot;Nationals&quot;. The types do not sound the same — the Nationals are brassier and are usually preferred by blues players. Either type offers round necks (Spanish) or square necks (Hawaiian). Square necks are sometimes necessitated both by the use of thicker strings and by the increased force the instrument is subject to as a consequence of its raised strings.
* Electric lap steel guitars: Describes instruments that are specifically designed to be played horizontally and feature an electric pickup so that they do not require any resonance chamber. Guitars in this category may differ markedly from one another in external appearance, and include instruments made from rectangular solid blocks of wood. Some may be small enough to be played on the lap; others may have more than one neck (making the instrument heavier), and may be built on a frame with legs, which is then known as a console steel.

==Tunings==
Over centuries in Western countries, the traditional Spanish guitar developed a near-universal tuning of ascending fourths (and one major third) consisting of E–A–D–G–B–E; however, no such standard existed for the Hawaiian &quot;open tunings&quot; (guitar tuned in a chord). The Hawaiians simply tuned to a chord that suited the singer&#x27;s voice. Beginning in the days of slack-key guitar in the 1850s, Hawaiian tunings came to be as closely guarded as any trade secret, handed down in families. Many players de-tuned their instruments when they were not playing them to keep others from discovering their tuning.

The tuning chosen for these instruments is a crucial foundation on which steel guitar style is built. The tuning used determines the notes that the player has available in a chord, and affects how notes can be played in sequence. Experimenting with different tunings was a widespread practice of the Hawaiian music of the 1930s and provided templates that became a foundation for the playing style of later musicians. Scores of tunings are available for lap steel players. The addition of a sixth interval into a tuning had a dramatic effect on the steel guitar because it created numerous positions and playing pockets which were not accessible in a simple major chord. The C6 was a common tuning for six string lap steels in the 1920s and 1930s. Tunings with a sixth interval are popular in Western swing and jazz, while tunings containing flatted sevenths are often chosen for blues and rock music.

A fundamental challenge of lap steel guitar design is the inherent constraint it places on the number of chords and inversions available in any given tuning. To address the meager array available to them, some early players would simply have a second lap steel at hand, with a different tuning, ready when needed. Another strategy was to increase the number of strings on the instrument (the more strings available, the smaller the pitch intervals between them, and therefore more notes available when the bar is placed straight across the strings). A third strategy was to add additional necks to the same instrument, thus providing separate sets of strings that could each be tuned differently.

==The Hawaiian &quot;craze&quot; in the United States==
In the U.S. Mainland in the early 20th century, after the 1898 annexation of Hawaii, the Hawaiian &quot;craze&quot; was in full force, as evidenced by radio broadcasts, stage shows, and motion pictures featuring Hawaiian music. Hollywood films perpetuated the musical image of an idealized island lifestyle. Hawaiian guitars and lessons for youth were widely available. For example, the Oahu Music Company sold their &quot;Oahu&quot;-brand guitars and lessons to young people by door-to-door sales, canvassing nearly every city in the United States.

The steel guitar was the first &quot;foreign&quot; musical instrument to gain a foothold in American pop music. Pioneer lap steel players between 1915 and 1930 included Sol K. Bright Sr., Tau Moe, Dick McIntire, Sam Ku West and Frank Ferera. Ferera was the most-recorded of any lap-style guitarists in that time period. Hawaiian music began to meld into American popular music in the 1910s – a combination Hawaiians called &quot;hapa haole&quot; (half-white) – which was essentially Hawaiian music, sung in English, intended for white audiences. As an example, Honolulu-born Dick McIntire and his &quot;Harmony Hawaiians&quot; recorded Hawaiian songs sung by American pop crooner Bing Crosby in 1936. Tin Pan Alley obliged the demand for Hawaiian songs by publishing a large supply of &quot;hapa haole&quot; music. Many amateur and professional musicians throughout America formed Hawaiian combos in the 1930s and 1940s. The introduction of electrified guitars in the 1930s had a profound effect, boosting commercial Hawaiian music.

==Lap steel pioneers==
In the development of lap steel guitar in the early twentieth century, many innovators contributed; among the most prominent were:
Sol Ho&#x27;opi&#x27;i (pronounced Ho-OH-pee-EE) was perhaps the most famous Hawaiian musician whose work spread the sound of instrumental lap steel play worldwide. He was the first steel guitarist to combine Hawaiian music with American jazz. Born in Honolulu in 1902, Hoopii was a gifted talent on lap steel from an early age. When he was a teenager, he stowed away on a Matson liner on its journey from Hawaii to San Francisco. After his arrival in California, he formed a trio and became well known in clubs, theaters, movie appearances and recordings from 1925 to 1950. He combined Hawaiian music with the jazz he heard from clarinet and horn players. He was a trendsetter in his use of the metal-bodied National Tricone guitar and, later, the Rickenbacker Bakelite (&quot;see photo above&quot;) and Dickerson electric steels.

Bob Dunn was the first steel guitarist of renown playing Western swing. Born in 1908 in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, he quit school in the eighth grade to join traveling musical troupes. Considered a musical revolutionary, according to music writer Michael Ross, Bob Dunn played the first electrified instrument of any type on a commercial recording. It was a Western swing tune released in 1935, performed by Dunn in collaboration with &quot;Milton Brown and his Musical Brownies&quot;. The guitar he played was a Rickenbacker A22, nicknamed the &quot;Frying Pan&quot;. Formerly a trombone player, Dunn&#x27;s guitar playing introduced horn-like solos, with the staccato phrasing of jazz players, and, according to historian Andy Volk, was of indelible influence on subsequent generations of steel players.
Jerry Byrd was born in Lima, Ohio, in 1920. As a youth, he attended a traveling tent show that came to town; it was a troupe of Hawaiians playing Hawaiian music and featured a polished National steel guitar. Byrd was smitten by the sound as well as the physical appearance of the instrument and said, &quot;That was the day that changed my life&quot;. In a musical career divided between Hawaiian music and country music, Byrd helped lay the foundation for the Nashville steel guitar sound. He is credited with developing the C6 tuning that became the standard of C6 pedal steels. With Hank Williams, Byrd recorded songs like &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;, &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot; and &quot;A Mansion on the Hill&quot;. Byrd also recorded with Marty Robbins, Hank Snow, Ernest Tubb and others. After his Nashville career, Byrd made Hawaii his permanent home.

==Western Swing==

In the early 1930s, the newly electrified lap steel guitar took a prominent position in a type of dance music known as &quot;Western swing&quot;, a form of jazz swing that combined elements of country music and Hawaiian music. Pioneers of the genre include bandleaders Milton Brown and Bob Wills. Wills in turn hired and nurtured innovative players, who subsequently influenced the genre, including Leon McAuliffe, Noel Boggs, and Herb Remington.

In October, 1936, Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys and McAuliffe, performing with a Rickenbacker B–6 lap steel, recorded the remarkably well selling record, &quot;Steel Guitar Rag&quot;. Due to the need to have different chords or voicings available, the design of the lap steel and the way it was played underwent continual change as the style evolved. McAuliffe had two Rickenbackers, each tuned differently. The instrument&#x27;s constraints caused leading steel guitarists to add additional necks with different tunings on the same instrument. Lap steels were the first multi-neck electric instruments. The added size and weight meant that the instrument could no longer be reasonably supported on the player&#x27;s lap and required placement in a frame with legs known as a &quot;console&quot; steel guitar, that is still ostensibly a lap steel. Prominent players of that era, including Herb Remington and Noel Boggs, accommodated by instrument maker Leo Fender, eventually played instruments with four different necks.

==Honky-tonk==
By the late 1940s, the steel guitar featured prominently in the emerging &quot;honky-tonk&quot; style of country music, developed in Texas and Oklahoma bars and dance halls (called honky-tonks). The style features a simple two-beat sound with a prominent backbeat. Honky-tonk singers who used a lap steel guitar in their musical arrangements included Hank Williams, Lefty Frizzell and Webb Pierce.
Don Helms (1927–2008), born in New Brockton, Alabama, played a double-neck Gibson lap steel using an E6 and a B11 tuning on recordings by all three of these artists, as well as on more than 100 Hank Williams songs, including &quot;Your Cheating Heart&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help It (If I&#x27;m Still in Love with You)&quot; and &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot;. Helms&#x27; playing style helped move country music away from the hillbilly string-band sound popular in the 1930s and toward the more modern electric style that took over in the 1940s. His guitar intros, leads, and fills have been widely imitated for 50 years. Other classic country recordings featuring Helms&#x27; work were &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot; (Patsy Cline) and &quot;Blue Kentucky Girl&quot; (Loretta Lynn). Many recordings of that era (1950s) were made using a steel guitar tuning in a sixth chord, often a C6, which is sometimes called a &quot;Texas tuning&quot;.

==Dobro==

The Dobro or resonator guitar is a uniquely American lap steel guitar with a resonator cone designed to make a guitar louder. It was patented by the Dopyera brothers in 1927, but the name &quot;Dobro&quot;, a portmanteau of DOpyera and BROthers, became a generic term for this type of guitar. The dobro never became popular with blues players, who generally prefer the National guitar, which has a similar resonator design but uses a metal body. In the opinion of music writer Richard Carlin, the dobro probably would have disappeared from the musical scene had it not been for two influential players: Pete Kirby and Uncle Josh Graves (Buck Graves).

Beecher &quot;Pete&quot; Kirby (1911–1992), known as Bashful Brother Oswald, was born in Sevierville, Tennessee. As a member of Roy Acuff&#x27;s &quot;Smoky Mountain Boys&quot;, in 1939 his dobro playing on the Grand Ole Opry helped define country music in its formative years. Kirby introduced the instrument to a nationwide radio audience. He played a Dobro Model 27, and sometimes a steel-bodied National guitar. He was known to perform a comedy act dressed as a yokel, wearing a wide-brim slouch hat and overalls. His dobro attracted interest and fascination; he said, &quot;People couldn&#x27;t understand how I played it and what it was, and they&#x27;d always want to come around and look at it.&quot; He stayed with Acuff for 53 years.

Buck &quot;Josh&quot; Graves (aka &quot;Uncle Josh Graves&quot;), born in 1927, played dobro in the pioneering Bluegrass band &quot;Flatt and Scruggs&quot; in 1955. Graves played a role in establishing dobro as a common fixture in a bluegrass band. He honed a style that elevated his dobro skills to rival the prowess of his bandmates. To do so, he abandoned Hawaiian stylings and adopted hammer-on and pull-off notes to combine open strings with fretted notes rapidly; additionally, he adopted a three-finger picking style taught to him by Earl Scruggs. Dozens of other bluegrass groups added a dobro after hearing Graves&#x27; lightning-fast solos that fit into the bluegrass instrumental style. He took lap steel guitar to a new level, able to complement the banjo, fiddle, and mandolin.

Dobro fell out of favor in mainstream country music until a bluegrass revival in the 1970s brought it back with younger virtuoso players like Jerry Douglas, whose Dobro skills became widely known and emulated.

==Sacred steel==

This gospel music tradition, now called &quot;sacred steel&quot;, began in the 1930s church services in the &quot;House of God&quot;, a small African-American denomination where the steel guitar emerged as an alternative to the church organ. Darick Campbell (1966–2020) was a lap steel player for the gospel band, The Campbell Brothers, who took the musical tradition from Pentecostal churches to international fame. Campbell played a traditional Hawaiian lap steel: a Fender Stringmaster 8-string (Fender Deluxe-8). He regulated the volume up on top of the guitar with his hand as he played and used a wah pedal. Born in Rochester, New York, Campbell was a master at mimicking the human singing voice with his guitar. He said, &quot;My method is to always think of my guitar as a voice&quot;. Campbell played many music festivals, but his renown in rock and jazz circles was not well received by church leaders. The Campbell Brothers parted ways acrimoniously with the Nashville-based House of God Church, Keith Dominion, because the Pentecostal church wanted to keep the band&#x27;s music within the church walls. Campbell recorded with The Allman Brothers and Medeski Martin and Wood.

==Lap slide guitar==

Lap slide guitar is not a specific instrument, but a style of playing lap steel that is typically heard in blues or rock music. Players of these genres typically use the term &quot;slide&quot; instead of &quot;steel&quot;; they sometimes play the style with a flat pick or with fingers instead of finger picks. Pioneers in lap slide include Buddy Woods, &quot;Black Ace&quot; Turner (who used a small medicine bottle as a slide), and Freddie Roulette. Turner played a National Style 2 square neck Tricone guitar on his lap.

Another blues guitar playing style is called &quot;slide guitar&quot;, a hybrid between steel guitar and conventional guitar. It is played with a conventional guitar held flat against the body, fretting the bass strings in the usual way (for rhythm accompaniment), while using a tubular slide (or the neck of a bottle) placed on a finger of the same hand to slide against the treble strings. In 1923, Sylvester Weaver was the first to record this style. In the 1940s, blues players like Robert Nighthawk and Earl Hooker popularized electric slide guitar this way, using a traditional guitar in standard tuning. The term &quot;bottleneck&quot; was historically used to describe this type of playing. Early blues players used open tunings, but most modern slide players use both standard and open.

==Lap steel obsolescence==
The expense of building multiple necks on each guitar made lap steels unaffordable for most players and a more sophisticated solution was needed. Many inventors sought a mechanical linkage to change the pitch of strings on the steel guitar. Gibson introduced a pedal steel guitar as early as 1940, but it never caught on. About 1946, Paul Bigsby created a new design for the pedal action, greatly improving it. Bigsby, working alone in his shop, made guitars for leading players of the day, including Joaquin Murphey and Speedy West. Nashville guitarist Bud Isaacs received one of Bigsby&#x27;s two-pedal guitars in 1952. It was a wooden double–eight string model. Isaacs experimented with the new pedals in an E9 tuning, trying to imitate the sound of two fiddles playing in harmony. In doing so, he came upon something new – he innovated pushing the pedal &quot;while the strings were still sounding&quot;. This practice had been strictly avoided by other players of the era, because it was considered poor technique and &quot;un-Hawaiian&quot;. Isaacs&#x27; intent was to use the pedal mechanism itself as a feature of the music. The technique created a triad chord, where two lower notes bend up in glissando counterpoint from below, to harmonize with a third note on top that remains unchanged. The pedal facilitated the move in perfect synchronization and pitch, which was consistent and reliable.

Isaacs tried it in a 1953 recording session on a Webb Pierce song called &quot;Slowly&quot;. The song became one of the most-played country songs of 1954 and was No. 1 on the Billboard&#x27;s country charts for seventeen weeks. Isaacs&#x27; guitar became the first pedal steel guitar on a hit record. More importantly, the sound was immediately recognized by lap steel (non-pedal) guitarists as something both unique and impossible to produce on a non-pedal lap steel. Dozens of instrumentalists rushed to get pedals on their steel guitars to imitate the unique bending notes they heard in Isaacs&#x27; play. In the months and years after this recording, instrument makers and musicians worked to duplicate the innovations of Bigsby and Isaacs. Even though the instrument had been available for over a decade before this recording, the pedal steel guitar emerged as a crucial element in country music after the success of this song. The pedals allowed playing more complex and versatile music than it was possible on lap steel.

The pedal steel design was adopted by an overwhelming majority of lap steel players in the early 1950s. The resulting new and distinctive style of playing became a defining characteristic of the country music coming out of Nashville for decades thereafter. In accordance, the &quot;non&quot;-pedal lap steel became largely obsolete, with only pockets of devotees remaining in country and Hawaiian music.

Jimmy Day was an example of an established lap player who was able to make a successful switch to pedals in mid-career. Other prominent lap steel players—including Noel Boggs, Jerry Byrd and Joaquin Murphey—refused to switch. According to music historian Rich Kienzle, this decision hindered Boggs&#x27; later career. Speaking about the pedal steel in a 1972 interview, Jerry Byrd said: &quot;Mechanically, there were a lot of bugs, you couldn&#x27;t keep them in tune, and that drove me crazy&quot; ... So I decided to stay with what I had and keep my identity and ride it out... I never made the change-over.&quot; Joaquin Murphey stayed with the non-pedal lap steel long after his contemporaries had switched over, and with his C6 tuning. He felt that the Nashville-standard E9 was, in his words, a &quot;gimmick&quot;. He stated in a 1995 interview, &quot;I can&#x27;t do all that fancy Nashville stuff and I hate it anyhow&quot;.

<text>Baler (, , , ; ), officially the Municipality of Baler (; ), is a municipality and capital of the province of Aurora, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 43,785 people.

==History==
===Spanish colonial period===


In 1609, seven Franciscan missionaries, led by Fray Blas Palomino, founded the settlement of Baler, which was later converted into a &quot;pueblo&quot; (town) by the Augustinians and the Recollects in 1658. Due to scarcity of religious missionaries, the Franciscans again took over the administration of the settlement in 1703.

On December 27, 1735, a great storm came and a huge wave called &quot;tromba marina&quot; devastated the old town settlement, then located in Barrio Sabang. Among the survivors were the Angaras, Bijasas, Bitongs, Lumasacs, Carrascos, and Pobletes who swam toward the nearby Ermita Hill. A new community sprang into what is now the Poblacion of Baler, leaving &quot;Kinagunasan,&quot; the place of devastation. A mural depicting this wave can be found in the Museo de Baler in town.

On June 27, 1898, 15 days after the Philippine Declaration of Independence, 54 Spanish soldiers of the Baler garrison, under the command of Captain Enrique de las Morenas y Fossi, made San Luis Obispo de Tolosa Church, named in Spanish for Louis of Toulouse, their barracks. When de las Morenas died on November 22, 1898, Lieutenant Saturnino Martín Cerezo replaced him. On June 2, 1899, the last Spanish garrison in the Philippines surrendered after the Siege of Baler, effectively ending over 300 years of Spanish rule in the country.

===American colonial period===
In 1902, the Americans incorporated the town into the province of Tayabas. Before the Americans came, Baler was under the district of El Príncipe from Nueva Ecija.

The &quot;Comedia de Baler&quot; of Aurora mounted its first production in 1927. It was supported by then President Manuel L. Quezon and enjoyed the collaboration of artists Fortunato Esoreña and Alejandro Ferreras and arnis expert Antonino Ramos. Still alive today, it features a group of colorfully attired performers using authentic weapons, like swords and knives, in their plays. Manuel L. Quezon was the governor of Tayabas, which was renamed Quezon in his honor.

===Japanese occupation===
In 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army entered Baler, where they made the Baler Elementary School building their garrison under the command of a certain Captain Hattori. The general headquarters and camp base of the Philippine Commonwealth Army from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the Philippine Constabulary from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, were stationed in Baler.

In 1945, Filipino and American troops landed in Baler, including Filipino troops of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 5th Infantry Division, the 51st Infantry Division, and the 52nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, the 5th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, the local recognized guerrilla unit, and the American troops of the 6th Infantry Division of the United States Army. The retreating Japanese troops destroyed the San Luis Obispo de Tolosa Church in Baler.

===Post-war period===
It became the capital of Aurora on June 14, 1951, under Republic Act No. 648 signed by President Elpidio Quirino. Baler is the birthplace of Manuel Quezon and his cousin and wife Aurora Aragon-Quezon. One obvious reason was the area&#x27;s isolation from the rest of Quezon Province: there were no direct links to the rest of the province and much of the terrain was mountainous and heavily forested, which made the area relatively isolated, and its distance from Quezon&#x27;s capital Lucena.

In 1956, the &quot;barrio&quot; of Dingalan was converted into a municipal district within Baler and later became a town in its right.

In 1976-7 the helicopter attack and surfing sequences of the film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; were filmed at Baler. The film is credited with having created the Philippine surfing culture and the headland at Baler is known as &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Point&quot; from a line in the film.

It remained the seat of government of Aurora on November 21, 1978, under &quot;Batas Pambansa Blg. 7&quot; signed by President Ferdinand Marcos.

On August 6, 2023, Republic Act No. 11957, also known as “An Act Recognizing the Municipality of Baler in the Province of Aurora as the ‘Birthplace of Philippine Surfing,” became law without President Bongbong Marcos’s signature.

==Geography==
According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the municipality has a land area of constituting of the total area of Aurora.

Baler is located northeast of Manila and is accessible by bus and private vehicles via a mountain pass. It is host to spectacular geographic formations and is situated on a vast plain at the south end of Baler Bay, a contiguous segment of the Philippine Sea.

===Barangays===
Baler is politically subdivided into 13 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

==Demographics==
People with connections to the town are referred to as Balereños. Prior to the arrival of Spanish missionaries in Baler in 1609, settlements by Aeta people and Bugkalot in Baler&#x27;s coast and mountain areas already exists, along with Kapampangan settlements in coast and plains. Tagalogs, some originating from Palanan and Infanta, Quezon, came in to the area to trade by boat. Some Tagalogs settled in Baler and married with the Aeta and Bugkalots. Kapampangans assimilated to the Tagalog settlers.

The Spanish brought in Filipino acolytes from other areas of Luzon from 1609 to 1899. During this period, Baler can only be accessed by sea though the town saw increase migration from other parts of Luzon such as Laguna, Tayabas, and Bicol from the south.The opening of the Baler-Bongabon Road allowed easier migration of people from Ilocos and Isabela areas from the north. The road also allowed Igorot people and Batangueños to settle in Baler. In 1896, a group of Ilocanos from Aringay, La Union came to settle in San Jose, now called Maria Aurora. In 1906, another group of Ilocanos arrived from La Union and Pangasinan. The guerrilla movement during the Japanese occupation brought Novo Ecijanos (people from Nueva Ecija) to Baler; Novo Ecijanos include Tagalogs, Ilocanos, and Kapampangans, with quite large number of Pangasinenses. The Balereños learned trade from the Batangueños and the Novo Ecijanos; where before they used to share what they have, now they would sell coconut to their neighbors. Other ethnic groups who came and stayed in Baler include Christianized Gaddang and Isinai settlers who settled the surrounding lowlands of Baler Bay.

In the 2020 census, Baler had a population of 43,785. The population density was .
===Languages===

The Tagalog and Ilocano languages are the main languages spoken in Baler. The province of Aurora is claimed to primarily speak a Tagalog dialect that is closely related to the Tayabas Tagalog of Quezon, with some Ilocano influences. In Baler, for example, the variety is called &quot;Tagalog-Baler (Balereño)&quot;. The Tagalog dialect of Balereños is also known for distinctive expressions like &quot;akkaw&quot;, used to express surprise, wonder, disgust, and objection; it is also akin to the English term &quot;Wow!&quot; Other regional term expressions spoken in Baler are &quot;are(h)&quot;, used to express a negative feeling of surprise; &quot;anin&quot;, used to express regret or pity for a situation; and many other words are also spoken similarly to neighboring Quezon, like &quot;adyo&quot;, meaning to climb, and &quot;puropur&quot;, which pertain to rain with gusty wind. Manuel L. Quezon, who was from Baler, was called the Father of the National Language for approving the recommendation of the Institute of National Language for Tagalog as the basis of the national language. Other languages spoken in Baler are Kapampangan, Pangasinan, Ga&#x27;dang, Isinai in surrounding lowlands of Baler Bay, Bugkalot and Northern Alta or Edimala.

<doc id="513232" wikidata="Q745381" url="?curid=513232" title="PvP (webcomic)">
<text>PvP, also known as Player vs Player, was a longrunning video game webcomic, written and drawn by Scott Kurtz. It was launched on May 4, 1998. The webcomic follows the events at a fictional video game magazine company, featuring many running gags and references with a focus on nerd culture. Dylan Meconis was added as a co-writer in 2013.

By 2005, &quot;PvP&quot; was receiving around 100,000 unique visitors per day, and the webcomic has seen various print releases. On February 1, 2007, it became the subject of its own animated series.

In 2020, the strip was rebooted, jumping forward in time 15 years, though it later reverted to the original time period.

On 2022-02-22, Kurtz announced on his blog that he was temporarily dialing back his daily work on &quot;PvP&quot; to concentrate on an upcoming book series based on &quot;Table |Titans&quot;.

There have been no new comics since 2022-09-16, when Kurtz locked all comics predating 2021 to Patreon subscribers only. On 2024-10-24, Kurtz removed the Patreon login requirements for reading the PvP and Table Titans archives. 

==Themes==
The comic chronicles the adventures of a fictional video game magazine company (later to become a video game publisher) and its employees. It features many running gags that are actually references to running gags from other media (television programs, films, games, cartoons, etc.). A popular but often controversial figure in the field of online comics, Kurtz is usually willing to share his opinions about comics and gaming culture in his blog, which is hosted on the same website as his comic strips.

Originally, &quot;PvP&quot; focused on video gaming and the larger &quot;nerd culture&quot; including comics and RPGs. 1UP.com described it as one of the first game-based comics, but not the original, saying, &quot;neither Scott Kurtz&#x27;s PvP nor Jerry Holkins and Michael Krahulik&#x27;s Penny Arcade were the first gaming-themed webcomic on the Internet.&quot; Over the years, the humor has broadened to include technology jokes, relationship humor, in-jokes about and mocking of the generation gaps between the different characters, with gaming increasingly taking a back seat. Kurtz occasionally comes under fire for his satire. Sometimes Kurtz will speak of his father&#x27;s open disdain for the strip.

In 2013, Kurtz created a spin-off comic &quot;Table Titans&quot;. It features the characters Andrew, Alan, and Valerie (who have appeared in PvP comics), and chronicles their adventures while playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Kurtz wanted to write fantasy comic that &quot;captured the spirit and joy of tabletop roleplaying.&quot; Kurtz collaborated with Wizards of the Coast as a marketing partnership to run &quot;Table Titans&quot;, and Steve Hamaker was brought on to color some of the comics. Season 4 of &quot;Table Titans&quot; was drawn by Brian Hurtt, and Tavis Maiden also worked on a project in the &quot;Table Titans&quot; universe.

==Characters==

===Cole Richards===

The boss. Friends with Brent since high school, Cole started &quot;PVP&quot; magazine as the business manager with Brent responsible for the creative and graphical content. A committed family man, he has a rather loose grasp of new technology and is often nostalgic for 1980s pop culture. Cole is (relatively speaking) the of the group and the one most likely to insist on actually making the magazine, though is not above joining the others&#x27; schemes. He is also insecure about his position in the magazine, he has expressed fear of becoming unnecessary.

Cole had a longstanding &quot;rivalry&quot; with Max Powers who ran &quot;Powerplay Games&quot; (formerly &quot;Powerplay Magazine&quot;); in reality Max has never done anything to Cole, but Cole was extremely jealous of Max&#x27;s success. Cole for a brief time was forced to merge the two companies when he could no longer afford to run the magazine on his own. However, when Cole came into a large sum of money from the World Wildlife Fund to house the giant panda that lives in the PvP offices (which attacks Brent throughout the series), he bought out Max&#x27;s side of the partnership.
Cole spent much of the series run married to Donna, though mentions having problems with his marriage in 2008. This ended some time later with a divorce which he refers to in 2011, although it is not covered by the strip.

===Brent Sienna===

Creative director of the magazine, Brent&#x27;s name was originally inspired by the Crayola crayon color &quot;Burnt Sienna.&quot; His full name is Brently Irving Sienna. Brent is a pompous, sarcastic, cynical intellectual snob, with a fanatical devotion to Apple Computer products. He drives a Mini Cooper as a &quot;statement&quot; and drinks Starbucks coffee, which he admits he drinks because it makes him cool. Brent tried unsuccessfully to give up coffee in a story arc during early 2005.

A running gag in the strip is that whenever the words &quot;Panda,&quot; &quot;Panda Attack,&quot; or &quot;Giant Panda&quot; or any variation thereof are spoken, Brent is immediately mauled by the Giant Panda that lives in the walls of the PvP offices. Brent got revenge in the August 6, 2005 strip when he mauled the panda in a parallel universe.

Brent virtually always wore sunglasses in the strip—going so far as to pick up a loaner set of sunglasses while his were &quot;in the shop&quot;—although later strips show Brent&#x27;s eyes over the tops of his sunglasses. Brent claims he wore the shades because any woman that looks in his eyes falls in love with him. Constantly wearing sunglasses made Brent&#x27;s eyes extremely sensitive to sunlight – after removing his sunglasses at his wedding, he was (temporarily) blinded. Eventually Brent stopped wearing his sunglasses altogether, after years of wearing them began to negatively affect his eyesight. Instead he exchanged his shades for regular prescription glasses. However, after realizing that he was losing his cool factor, Jade has allowed him to occasionally wear his sunglasses again.

Brent is an avid consumer of Apple computers and products. He refuses to use PCs and considers Microsoft to be evil, even forbidding the use of PCs in his house. He is a founding member of an Apple fanatics group called The Honorable Order of Macintosh Operators (or H.O.M.O. – the name is a running gag in the strip).

Although Brent is not a gamer, unlike the rest of the staff, he does occasionally play &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; with H.O.M.O. (as well as with Jade), and played &quot;City of Heroes&quot; with Cole, Francis, and Skull as part of the &quot;City of Heroes&quot; special edition comic packed with the game, as well as its counterpart, &quot;City of Villains&quot; in a later strip seen on the site, but neither game has been referenced beyond those strips. Before he discovered Apple, Brent was a closet Amiga fanatic.

Brent married his longtime girlfriend and co-worker Jade in a lavish ceremony marking the strip&#x27;s ten-year anniversary. The two began dating after Jade found out that Francis was pretending to be a woman named &quot;Sasha&quot; while chatting online with Brent. Jade found out about it and decided to take over as &quot;Sasha&quot; to let Brent down easy, but eventually fell in love with him. Brent proposed at San Diego Comic-Con after a convoluted scheme whereby some stormtroopers &quot;kidnapped&quot; Jade and had her dress up as Princess Leia. Brent &quot;rescued&quot; her, dressed as Han Solo.

===Jade Sienna===

A columnist, and Brent&#x27;s wife. She plays MMORPG-style games such as &quot;EverQuest&quot; and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, and also chats online with friends she&#x27;s made in the series.

Along with Cole, Jade often plays the straight-man of the group and is often the voice of reason compared to the rest of the cast. However, she was not always the good and moral figure that she appears to be. In high school, she and her friend Sam were caught stealing the answers to their chemistry final. Jade also took her stepfather&#x27;s car without permission, and was subsequently charged with robbery by her stepfather in order to teach her a lesson. Brent and Francis were delighted to learn this, since they tend to be the ones whose antics cause Jade to roll her eyes in contempt. Jade attempted to return to her old deviant ways after this revelation, but realized she didn&#x27;t enjoy it as much as she once did.

Although considered a feminist, Jade&#x27;s desire to be treated as an equal often comes into conflict with her natural maternal caregiver personality. She temporarily left PvP after Francis grabbed her breast, opening her own pro-woman gaming magazine called &quot;Valkyrie&quot;. Later Valkyrie merged to PvP because Jade missed her PvP-family and had problems with her workers.

Jade is often criticized for being &quot;unrealistic&quot;, although Kurtz states that she is somewhat modeled after his wife. In her first posting to the PvP blog, Angela Kurtz stated, &quot;90% of the time, when you’re reading Jade, you’re reading about Scott’s feminine side, not about me.&quot;

Although Jade and Brent dated since nearly the start of the series, they broke up for nearly a year, due to a combination of Jade&#x27;s obsession with Dark age of Camelot, and her catching Brent dancing with the wife of another Dark age of Camelot player in Las Vegas. Although they both continued to work at PVP, they were often seen bickering and attempting to one-up each other. Jade ended up falling in love soon after with another gamer she met on another MMORPG, named Xavier. She flew out to Las Vegas to meet Xavier in person, but began to feel reluctance and guilt returning to the place where she and Brent broke up. It was then revealed that Xavier had been Brent all along, and the two rekindled their relationship, eventually marrying in 2008. In 2014, she gave birth to her and Brent&#x27;s daughter, Katherine Miranda Fontaine Sienna.

===Francis Ottoman===

The youngest member of the staff. Technical support for the office (and also known to write the occasional review), Francis is immature, easily excitable and always eager to be on the cutting edge of fads and technology. He loves his PC and routinely argues with Brent over Macs. He rarely shows interest in anything besides computers or video games, though it has been stated that he owns a prominent collection of pony figurines.

Francis is a skilled programmer, he has on different occasions made both a robot girlfriend and a robot of himself. The girlfriend-bot eventually malfunctions when he tells it that he grabbed Jade&#x27;s boob, and eventually tries to destroy her. Using the leftover parts, he makes a robot of himself, nicknamed the Francis-bot. He uses this to wait in line for tickets for Star Wars Episode 3, which comes out three years from the beginning of the story. However, when Francis returns to get his tickets, he discovers that the robot has been waiting outside of an antique mall for a year. The robot kidnaps Francis and chains him to the mall while taking his position as the real person back at PvP. The others discover him after the robot dies from a saliva overdose after kissing Marcy. Both of these times, Francis has thought the thing it was doing was more impressive building and coding, which allowed both robots to have some semblance of artificial intelligence.

Francis&#x27; appearance in the comic has gone through more changes than the other characters. His first artwork was choppy and caused reader confusion due to readers mistaking a spot for his mouth and his mouth for a &quot;jagged chin&quot; or part of his hair, so his design was drastically changed later. For a long time he sported a T-shirt depicting a human skull, and messed-up moussed hair (the mousse was originally, and may still be, Skull&#x27;s phlegm).

Due to his consummation of his relationship with Marcy as &quot;predicted&quot; in a previous comic strip, in 2008, he &quot;leveled up&quot;, aging three years and developing chin scruff. In 2011, Francis &quot;leveled up&quot; again due to the company leaving Dallas for Seattle (mirroring the real life move of Scott Kurtz) and Francis being pushed into living on his own as an adult. Later that year, Francis said that Marcy broke up with him via text message after she had left for Savannah College of Art and Design. They reconciled after Marcy rejoins the PvP staff. After a gaming tournament in Las Vegas the two went out on a drinking spree and, while very drunk, got married. Despite initial misgivings about the relationship, Francis and Marcy have stayed together and are apparently happy.

Francis has a running gag with Cole in which they high five each other using whatever they are holding. This usually ends up in a mess with coffee, fries or blood all over the place.

===Skull the Troll===

A lovable troll who is assigned to be a mythological animal friend to Brent. Nervous and childlike, he had an occasional girlfriend named Sonya, although Skull was exposed to be female in an early comic. This was later revealed to be a joke, and Skull is typically portrayed as genderless. Brent and Francis do their best to figure out which gender he really is (on one occasion watching his reaction to a lingerie magazine they had left for him to find. Skull first acts like a typical male, whistling at the pictures, then wondered to himself if they had a piece in his size and color), though Skull has implied on many occasions that he is definitely male.

Skull debuted in another of Kurtz&#x27;s web cartoons called , which focused on the world of &quot;Ultima Online&quot;. Though he seems to be an utterly harmless, rather clueless and childish creature who doesn&#x27;t even seem to understand the nature of violence, Skull has a dark underside that the other characters sometimes see but blame on outside forces. He has actually threatened to eat Francis, and doesn&#x27;t always take Brent&#x27;s abuse—not to mention his epic battle with the crazed Emperor Blue.

The comic&#x27;s cast page states that, as a mythological creature, Skull&#x27;s only real need is attention. The middle name &quot;Theodore&quot; was recently revealed to be the long form for &quot;the&quot; (as &quot;Skull The Troll&quot;). Skull was reassigned when Brent finally got married, much to Brent&#x27;s dissatisfaction. His first assignment was a boy named Kevin with a somewhat sadistic streak, who lived near U.S. Route 422 in western Pennsylvania, at least until his death due to a reckless wagon ride after four days (reader time) with Skull. Since then, Skull has attempted to befriend parodies of the children in The Family Circus, who believed him to be a demon and tried to kill him. This escapade ended when Skull was rescued by Jason Fox. Thanks to Scratch and Shecky he returned to &quot;PvP&quot; and has apparently &quot;retired&quot; from his &quot;mentoring&quot; duties. He does have a new girlfriend named Val, or Valerie. She was introduced during a Magic: The Gathering session, where she almost immediately tried to kill Skull. After the fight stopped, they became a couple. Even though she sees herself as a dwarven hammermaid who is supposed to hate trolls, she still feels deep affection for him.

===Max Powers===

Arch-enemy and rival publisher of Cole, Max Powers ran &quot;Powerplay&quot; magazine. While seemingly jovial and outgoing, for some reason Max was generally despised by the PvP crew. While perhaps not as truly evil as Brent and Cole claim, he could doubtlessly be quite annoying. Eric Burns of the webcomic review site Websnark wrote an analysis of Max suggesting that he is actually &quot;the good guy&quot; of PVP. Burns points out that nothing Max does can be nailed down as overtly malicious. (For example, he threatens to post a naked picture of Jade on the Internet unless she goes out with him, but it turns out to be a baby picture. He tells Cole about upcoming software audits, but doesn&#x27;t actually report Cole to the authorities.) In the December 2, 2008 comic, four years after Burns&#x27;s article, Cole admits to Max that part of the reason he finds him so irritating is that Max is a better person than he is. &quot;Powerplay&quot; merged with &quot;PvP&quot; to prevent &quot;PvP&#x27;s&quot; certain financial ruin. Because of his narcissistic attitude, Max was unable to see Skull, and was unaware of the troll&#x27;s existence. However, Shecky punched Max as an &#x27;incentive to see the world beyond [his] nose&#x27;, changing Max&#x27;s perceptions. Unfortunately, Max thought Cole was letting the staff keep a pair of &#x27;dogs&#x27; on the premises and said the &#x27;yappy one&#x27; (Shecky) snapped at his face. (See March 13, 2006 blog entry.) As of December second in the strip, &quot;PvP&quot; and &quot;Powerplay&quot; have gone their separate ways, as Cole has come into a large sum of money which he will receive annually from the World Wildlife Fund, thanks to the near-constant attacks on Brent by a giant panda, and the fact that it appears the panda is now more or less living somewhere in the PvP offices. During a 2008 Thanksgiving Plot, it has been revealed that Cole believes that Max stole a &quot;girlfriend&quot; from him (they were not actually dating, but Cole believed Max made his move on her before &quot;he&quot; could). Max however adamantly denied it saying he only grew close with the girl so as to get closer to Cole and Brent. This led Cole and Brent to the assumption that Max is gay, and was attracted to one of them. The former has been confirmed in a 2011 strip in which Max admits to Jade that he is in fact gay; he begs her not to tell anyone else, and she has so far complied with his request. During a conversation with his sister Sonya, it was revealed that Max had a partner named Chris. Max later reveals that he is gay to the rest of the group when Lucille convinces him that it is doing him no good keeping it secret.

After a year&#x27;s absence from the strip, during which he drove cross-country on a motorcycle doing good deeds, Max returned to the PvP offices to ask Cole for a job. He is now also able to see Skull, most likely because he is now &quot;pure of heart&quot; after a year of soul-searching. The new Max, after realizing the company was doomed in a few months, broke into Cole&#x27;s office and went over the financial statements to confirm his fears. After a confrontation with Cole, after which Cole confessed the state of the company to Brent, Cole set Max off to find a new business plan and opportunities. After several weeks Max returned from Seattle, advising PVP to cease publication immediately, switch to a strictly online format (which was the only portion of the business generating a profit), and move the company from Dallas to Seattle. This reflects Scott Kurtz&#x27;s real-life move of a year earlier in 2010.

===Scratch Fury, Destroyer of Worlds===

Skull&#x27;s cat. Francis attempted to give it to Brent to make the latter feel some Christmas spirit, but the ploy failed and Skull decided to take the cat in. Skull accidentally zapped him with his &quot;genius machine&quot;, granting him superhuman intelligence. Scratch is bent on global domination, but his evil plans for attaining it have so far been foiled by his feline foibles and proclivities. He is Pinky and the Brain in the same body, and they&#x27;re fighting for dominance. It is worth noting that while Scratch is still a genius – after Skull&#x27;s departure, he was seen in the basement, working on a machine of some sort with a welding torch – he appears to be unable to communicate to the other members of the magazine. It has been suggested that the ambient magic surrounding Skull was what made Scratch&#x27;s ability to communicate with humans possible in the first place. However, Kurtz has admitted that the lack of understanding Scratch was just a mistake, and changed the strip to have Scratch deliberately talking in cat-speak. Also, he becomes &quot;Kringus&quot; a Christmas tree-themed villain in numerous stories set in yule times. Scratch has mostly given up on evil schemes, and has focused on killing Garfield and running his &quot;Cool Cat Club&quot;.

=== Lolbat ===
Lolbat is Kurtz&#x27;s version of Batman and Robin. He derives his powers from a material called memetic fabric, which allows him to talk like he is in an internet meme. He fights members of the Algonquin hate table, made up of internet supervillains like The Savage Critic, The Scrabbler, and the Mad Hater. He also serves as Robbie&#x27;s manservant during the day. Lolbat has recently acquired a sidekick named Retweet (also known as Wade), who talks like a Twitter post. He is also assisted by Jade&#x27;s sister Miranda, who discovered the lair of the Lolbat and decided to assist him by becoming the Instagirl, a phone based superhero.

==Publication==

===Online strip===
The first online strip was posted on Monday, May 4, 1998. Kurtz normally updates the strip every day but has occasionally missed updates since the comic&#x27;s inception, less so after the PVP 2.0 revamp. In April 2005, Kurtz changed to a Monday through Friday schedule, with Friday&#x27;s strip in color and sketches on Saturday and Sunday, in response to the mounting work he had taken on as a monthly comic at Image and associated side projects. On June 4, 2005, Scott Kurtz posted on his blog that he was returning to the daily schedule. On May 6, 2008, Kurtz reaffirmed the strip to a Monday through Friday schedule. Although the strip was initially formatted 2×2 to fit on 800×600 resolution screens, it switched to &quot;widescreen&quot; (1×4) on February 3, 2003. The strip celebrated its 10th anniversary on Sunday, May 4, 2008 with the wedding of two of PvP&#x27;s main characters, Brent Sienna and Jade Fontaine.

Occasionally single strips or short series have been presented drawn by guest cartoonists, such as KC Green.

===Print versions===

Previously, Dork Storm Press printed 6 issues of original content as well as a trade paperback of online strips. The Dork Storm issues were collected into a trade paperback entitled &quot;The Dork Ages.&quot;

In March 2003, Image Comics began publishing a monthly print comic book collection of the strip that combined old strips with new material. Publication of single issues and the Image partnership ended in March 2010 after over 7 years and 45 issues. In addition to publishing single issues Image released a 16-page primer (numbered as #0), and seven trade paperbacks (each collecting 6 issues) – &quot;&quot;PvP: At Large&quot; (#1–6), &quot;PvP: Reloaded&quot; (#7–12), &quot;PvP Rides Again&quot; (#13–18), &quot;PVP Goes Bananas&quot; (#19–25), &quot;PvP Treks On&quot; (#25–30), &quot;PvP Silent But Deadly&quot; and &quot;PVP Levels Up&quot;&quot;. A 10-year anniversary collection, Awesomology Deluxe, was also published by Image in 2009. After the ending of the Image partnership Kurtz switched to self publishing the print editions but only in collected form.

At the 2004 San Diego Comic-Con, Kurtz announced that he would offer to newspapers the entire &quot;PvP&quot; series to reprint for free, but only if the strips were reprinted without any changes made. Kurtz said he made this offer because of his dissatisfaction with the terms offered to cartoonists by syndicates. no major American newspaper has agreed to regularly pick up his strip, even though it is free. One newspaper, &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;, briefly ran one PvP strip per week in the fall of 2004.

In 2018, Kurtz launched a Kickstarter campaign to publish digital and physical media of PVP Online as a 20th Anniversary Collection printing of the previous 20 years of the comic. The material is planned for printing in eight volumes, with a supplementary 20th anniversary volume. The campaign achieved its fundraising goal, raising over $120,000 towards publication. Despite reaching that goal, Kurtz has yet to produce the promised rewards under the campaign. He last updated the campaign site on May 1, 2022, noting that it had been two years since the previous update.

===&quot;PvP: The Series&quot;===
Kurtz announced on November 27, 2006 that from February 2007, a traditionally animated cartoon series would be available over the internet via a subscription service, produced in conjunction with Blind Ferret Entertainment. Episodes were 4–6 minutes in length and released on a monthly schedule, co-written and co-produced by webcartoonist Kris Straub. A total of 12 episodes were produced, and have since been released on DVD as &quot;PvP: The Series Season One DVD&quot;.

The announcement of the series was marked with some interest on video game forums due to Kurtz&#x27;s previous criticism of Tim Buckley when he announced CAD Premium, an animated series based on his own web comic, particularly when both Buckley and Kurtz used the same animation studio for their respective ventures.

==Awards and nominations==

PvP has won multiple awards:
A spinoff of PvP, &quot;Table Titans,&quot; was nominated for a Harvey Award in 2014 in the category of Best Online Comics Work.
