<text>The geology of Great Britain is renowned for its diversity. As a result of its eventful geological history, Great Britain shows a rich variety of landscapes across the constituent countries of England, Wales and Scotland. Rocks of almost all geological ages are represented at outcrop, from the Archaean onwards.

== Overview ==

Seismographic research shows that the crust of the Earth below Great Britain is from 27 to 35 km (17 to 22 miles) thick. The oldest surface rocks are found in northwest Scotland and are more than half as old as the planet. These rocks are thought to underlie much of Great Britain (although boreholes have only penetrated the first few kilometres), but next appear extensively at the surface in Brittany and the Channel Islands. The youngest rocks are found in southeast England.

=== Bedrock and past volcanism===
The bedrock geology consists of a complex mix of generally older metamorphic rocks overlain by varying sequences of sedimentary rocks into both of which igneous rocks have been intruded at different times. The complexity of Great Britain&#x27;s geology is due ultimately to its being subject to a variety of plate tectonic processes over a very extended period of time. Changing latitude and sea levels have been important factors in the nature of sedimentary sequences, while successive continental collisions have affected its geological structure with major faulting and folding being a legacy of each orogeny (mountain-building period), often associated with volcanic activity and the metamorphism of existing rock sequences.

Great Britain does not have any active volcanoes now, but has had an active volcanic past. The last active volcanoes stopped erupting about 60 million years ago and the islands are no longer located upon any tectonic boundary or active volcanic region, nor are there other geological phenomena in the island group able to give rise to active volcanism. However, on a geological timescale, a considerable degree of active and large-scale volcanism occurred in Great Britain, and many famous landmarks are formed of the eroded igneous rocks formed during these orogenies (mountain-building periods). The British Geological Survey lists Snowdonia and the Lake District as having extremely large volcanic eruptions around 450 Ma (million years ago), Edinburgh Castle lying upon the remains of a volcano dating back 350 Ma, and some islands of western Scotland as being remnants of volcanoes from around 60 Ma.

=== Superficial deposits ===
Overlain on this bedrock geology (&quot;solid geology&quot; in the terminology of maps) is a varied distribution of unconsolidated material of more recent origin. It includes material deposited by glaciers (boulder clay and other forms of glacial drift such as sand and gravel). &quot;Drift&quot; geology is often more important than &quot;solid&quot; geology when considering building works, drainage, siting water boreholes, sand and gravel resources and soil fertility. Although &quot;drift&quot; strictly refers to glacial and fluvio-glacial deposits, the term on geological maps has traditionally included other materials including alluvium, river terraces, etc. Recent maps use the terms &quot;bedrock&quot; and &quot;superficial&quot; in place of &quot;solid&quot; and &quot;drift&quot;.

==Geological history==
This description of the geological history of Great Britain is based on that of P. Toghill.

===Precambrian===
====Archaean eon====
The Lewisian gneiss, the oldest rocks in Great Britain, date from at least 2.7 billion years ago in the Archaean eon, the Earth itself being about 4.6 billion years old. They are found in the far north west of Scotland and in the Hebrides, with a few small outcrops elsewhere. Formed from rock originally deposited at the surface of the planet, the rocks were later buried deep in the Earth&#x27;s crust and metamorphosed into crystalline gneiss.

====Proterozoic eon====
South of the gneisses are a complex mixture of rocks forming the North West Highlands and Grampian Highlands in Scotland. These are essentially the remains of folded sedimentary rocks that were originally 25 km thick, deposited over the gneiss on what was then the floor of the Iapetus Ocean. The process started about 1,000 Ma, with a notable 7 km thick layer of Torridon Sandstone being deposited about 800 Ma, as well as the debris deposited by an ice sheet 670 Ma.

Palaeomagnetic evidence indicates that 520 Ma, what is now Great Britain was split between two continents, separated by of ocean. The north of Scotland was located at about 20° south of the equator on the continent of Laurentia near the Tropic of Capricorn, while the rest of the country was at about 60° south on the continent of Gondwana near the Antarctic Circle.

In Gondwana, England and Wales were near a subduction zone. Both countries were largely submerged under a shallow sea studded with volcanic islands. The remains of these islands underlie much of central England with small outcrops visible in many places. Around 600 Ma, the Cadomian Orogeny (mountain building period) caused the English and Welsh landscape to be transformed into a mountainous region, along with much of north west Europe.

===Palaeozoic era===

====Cambrian period====
In the early Cambrian period, the volcanoes and mountains of England and Wales were eroded as the land became flooded by a rise in sea level, and new layers of sediment were laid down. Much of central England formed a stable block of crust, which has remained largely undeformed ever since. Sandstones were deposited in the north of Scotland. The first animals with hard shells evolved at this time, consequently, fossils become much more common in rocks formed during this and later periods.

====Ordovician period====
Five hundred million years ago, in the Ordovician period, southern Great Britain, the east coast of North America and south-east Newfoundland broke away from Gondwana to form the continent of Avalonia, which by 440 Ma had drifted (by the mechanisms of plate tectonics) to about 30° south.

During this period, north Wales was subject to volcanic activity. The remains of these volcanoes are still visible, one example of which is Rhobell Fawr dating from 510 Ma. Large quantities of volcanic lava and ash known as the Borrowdale Volcanics covered the Lake District and this can still be seen in the form of mountains such as Helvellyn and Scafell Pike.

The Ordovician also saw the formation of the Skiddaw slate deposits around 500 Ma.

====Silurian period====
Deposition continued into the early part of the Silurian period, with mudstones and sandstones being laid down, notably in Wales.

Avalonia had now joined with the continent of Baltica, and the combined landmass collided with Laurentia at about 20° south between 425 and 400 Ma, joining the southern and northern halves of Great Britain together. The resulting Caledonian Orogeny produced an Alpine-style mountain range in much of north and west Great Britain. The continental collision was probably at an oblique angle rather than a head-on collision, and this probably led to movement along strike-slip faults trending north-east to south-west across Scotland, the Great Glen Fault being the best example (some of these fault zones may have been old lines of weakness from earlier earth movements).

Volcanic ashes and lavas deposited during the Silurian are still found in the Mendip Hills and in Pembrokeshire.

====Devonian period====

The collision between continents continued during the Devonian period, with continuing uplift, and more volcanic deposits such as those now forming Ben Nevis. Sea levels varied considerably, with the coastline advancing and retreating from north to south across England. The uplifted region was gradually eroded down, resulting in the deposition of numerous sedimentary rock layers in lowlands and seas. The rocks of marine origin in the county of Devon gave the period its name, though deposits of this age are found in many other places, such as the Brecon Beacons, the Midland Valley of Scotland, and the Orkney Islands. Most of these are of terrestrial origin and are informally known as the Old Red Sandstone.

The Caledonian mountains had largely been eroded away by the end of the period during which the country would have experienced an arid desert climate as it was located close to the equator at between 10° and 15° south.

====Carboniferous period====
Around 360 Ma, at the start of the Carboniferous period, Great Britain was lying at the equator, covered by the warm shallow waters of the Rheic Ocean, during which time the Carboniferous Limestone was deposited, as found in the Mendip Hills, north and south Wales, in the Peak District of Derbyshire, north Lancashire, the northern Pennines and southeast Scotland. Caves developed more recently in the limestone of some of these areas by the action of carbonic acid and other organic acids in rainwater and groundwater.

These were followed by dark marine shales, siltstones, and coarse sandstones of the Millstone Grit. Later, river deltas formed and the sediments deposited were colonised by swamps and rain forest. It was in this environment that the cyclic Coal Measures were formed, the source of the majority of Great Britain&#x27;s extensive coal reserves that powered the Industrial Revolution. Coal can be found in many areas of Great Britain, as far north as the Midland Valley of Scotland, as far south as Kent, although coal mining has largely been concentrated in the Scottish Midlands, English Midlands, northern England and Wales.

Throughout the period, southwest England in particular was affected by the collision of continental plates. The mountain building period known as the Variscan orogeny, which occurred around 280 Ma, caused major deformation in south west England. Towards the end of this period granite was formed beneath the overlying rocks of Devon and Cornwall, now exposed at Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor, giving rise to mineralised deposits of copper and tin. The general region of Variscan folding was south of an east–west line roughly from south Pembrokeshire to Kent. The main tectonic pressure was from the south or south-east, and there developed dextral strike-slip faulting. The Devon-Cornwall massif may originally have been some distance further east, then to be moved westwards. Lesser Variscan folding took place as far north as Derbyshire and Berwick-upon-Tweed.

By the end of the Carboniferous period, the various continents of the Earth had fused to form the super-continent of Pangaea. Great Britain was located in the interior of Pangea, where it was again subject to a hot arid desert climate with frequent flash floods leaving deposits that formed beds of red sedimentary rock, somewhat similar to the later, Triassic New Red Sandstone.

====Permian period====
The Permian was characterised for 30 million years by arid desert conditions and the erosion of the land that had uplifted in the Variscan Orogeny, southwest England and adjacent areas of the present-day English Channel. Later, much of Great Britain was submerged in shallow waters as the polar ice sheets melted and the Tethys Ocean and Zechstein Sea formed, depositing shale, limestone, gravel, and marl, before finally receding to leave a flat desert with salt pans.

===Mesozoic era===

====Triassic period====
As Pangaea drifted during the Triassic, Great Britain moved away from the equator until it was between 20° and 30° north. Red beds, including sandstones and red mudstones form the main sediments of the New Red Sandstone. The remnants of the Variscan uplands in France to the south were eroded down, resulting in layers of the New Red Sandstone being deposited across central England, and in faulted basins in Cheshire and the Irish Sea. A basin developed in the Hampshire region around this time. Rifting occurred within and around Great Britain, prior to the breakup of the super-continent in the Jurassic period.

Rock fragments found near Bristol appear to indicate that, in 214 Ma, Great Britain was showered with a fine layer of debris from an asteroid impact at the Manicouagan Impact Crater in Canada, although this is still being debated.

====Jurassic period====

As the Jurassic period began, Pangaea began to break up, sea levels rose and Great Britain drifted on the Eurasian Plate to between 30° and 40° north. With much of Great Britain under water again, sedimentary rocks were deposited and can now be found outcropping across much of England from the Cleveland Hills of Yorkshire to the Jurassic Coast in Dorset. They also underlie younger strata to the east. In Southern England, the Jurassic rocks are subdivided upwards as the Lias, Inferior Oolite, Great Oolite, Ancholme (interfingering with Corallian) and Portland groups. These rock units include sandstones, greensands, oolitic limestone of the Cotswold Hills, corallian limestone of the Vale of White Horse and the Isle of Portland.

====Cretaceous period====
Sedimentation would retreat from most of England beginning in the Cretaceous, with the deposition of the lagoonal Purbeck and primarily freshwater Wealden groups being largely confined to the Wessex and Weald basins, with marine units, including the Speeton Clay, occurring in eastern England. The Aptian saw a marine transgression that flooded most areas of southern England, into shallow seas, with the successive deposition of the Lower Greensand and Gault and Upper Greensand occurring in the Aptian-Albian. At the beginning of the Late Cretaceous, around 100 million years ago, deposition changed to that of chalk, with the deposition of the Chalk Group continuing until the end of the Cretaceous. Chalk was deposited over much of Great Britain, now notably exposed at the White Cliffs of Dover and the Seven Sisters, and also forming Salisbury Plain. The high sea levels left only small areas of land exposed, which accounts for the general lack of land-origin sand, mud or clay sediments found from around this time.

===Cenozoic era===

====Palaeogene period====
In the early Palaeogene period, between 63 and 52 Ma, the last volcanic rocks in Great Britain were formed. The major eruptions at this time produced the Antrim Plateau, the basaltic columns of the Giant&#x27;s Causeway and the lavas and igneous intrusions of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland.

An early phase of the Alpine Orogeny, about 50 Ma, was responsible for the shaping of the London Basin syncline, the Weald-Artois Anticline to the south, the North Downs, South Downs and Chiltern Hills.

During the period, the North Sea formed and Great Britain was uplifted. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness left from the Caledonian and Variscan Orogenies long before. The uplifted areas were then eroded, and further sediments, such as the London Clay, were deposited over southern England, while the English Channel was characterised by mud flats and river-deposited sands. Much of the midlands and north of England may have been covered by Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits at the start of the Palaeogene, but these were lost through erosion. By 35 Ma, the landscape was colonised by trees such as beech, oak, redwood and palm, along with grasses.

====Neogene period====

=====Miocene and Pliocene epochs=====
In the Miocene and Pliocene epochs of the Neogene, further uplift and erosion occurred, particularly in Wales, the Pennines, and the Scottish Highlands. The only significant Miocene deposit in Great Britain is the Brassington Formation in the Peak District. Evidence from the Brassington Formation suggests that, in the middle and late Miocene (12 to 7 million years ago) a diverse warm-temperate forest grew in the UK. The oldest Neogene sediments have been reported from Wales and include fossil pollen that shows a subtropical mixed forest once grew on Anglesey. The climate of the UK cooled and became drier throughout the Neogene 

====Quaternary period====

=====Pleistocene epoch=====

The major changes during the Pleistocene were brought about by several recent ice ages. The most severe was the Anglian Glaciation, with ice up to 1,000 m (3300 ft) thick that reached as far south as London and Bristol. This took place between about 478,000 to 424,000 years ago, and was responsible for the diversion of the River Thames onto its present course.

There is extensive evidence in the form of stone tools that southern England was colonised by human populations during the warm Hoxnian Stage that followed the Anglian Glaciation. It is possible that the English Channel repeatedly opened and closed during this period, causing Great Britain to become an island from time to time. The oldest human fossils found to date in the British Isles, which include the skull of Swanscombe Man from 400,000 years ago, and the earlier Clactonian Man, also date from this period.

The Wolstonian Glaciation, between about 352,000 to 130,000 years ago, which is thought to have peaked around 150,000 years ago, was named after the village of Wolston southeast of Coventry which is thought to mark the southern limit of the ice.

The Wolstonian Stage was followed by the Ipswichian Stage, during which hippopotamus are known to have lived as far north as Leeds.

During the most recent Devensian glaciation, which is thought to have started around 115,000 years ago, peaked around 20,000 years ago and ended a mere 10,000 years ago, the Usk valley and Wye valley were eroded by glaciers, with the icesheet itself reaching south to Wolverhampton and Cardiff. The oldest human remains in Great Britain, the Red Lady of Paviland (29,000 years old), date from this time. It is thought that the country was eventually abandoned as the ice sheet reached its peak, being recolonised as it retreated. By 5,000 years ago, it is thought that Great Britain was warmer than it is at present.

Among the features left behind by the ice are the fjords of the west coast of Scotland, the U-shaped valleys of the Lake District and erratics (blocks of rock) that have been transported from the Oslo region of Norway and deposited on the coast of Yorkshire.

=====Holocene epoch=====
The last twelve thousand years are known as the Holocene Epoch. Amongst the most significant geological features created during this period are the peat deposits of Scotland, and of coastal and upland areas of England and Wales. Many of the lowland deposits, such as the Somerset Levels, The Fens and Romney Marsh have recently been artificially drained.

Since humans began clearing the forest during the New Stone Age, most of the land has now been deforested, speeding the natural processes of erosion. Large quantities of stone, gravel and clay are extracted each year, and by 2000 11% of England was covered by roads or buildings.

At the present time, Scotland is continuing to rise as a result of the weight of Devensian ice being lifted. Southern and eastern England is sinking, generally estimated at 1 mm ( inch) per year, with the London area sinking at double the speed partly due to the continuing compaction of the recent clay deposits.

In addition, rises in sea level thought to be due to global warming appear likely to make low-lying areas of land increasingly susceptible to flooding, while in some areas the coastline continues to erode at a geologically rapid rate.

Great Britain continues to be subject to several very minor earthquakes each month, and more occasional light to moderate ones. During the 20th century, 25 earthquakes with a moment magnitude of 4.5 to 6.1 were felt, many of them originating within the Isles themselves.

==Geological resources==
Great Britain&#x27;s complex geology has provided it with a wide range of geological resources including abundant supplies of coal, the initial extraction of which powered the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas provided further energy supplies for the nation. Geothermal energy and onshore oil have also been exploited to a lesser extent.

A wide variety of stone has been worked for building and general construction needs (e.g. sand and gravel) while other minerals have been mined or quarried for the chemical industry (e.g. salt), the production of metals (e.g. copper and tin) or other uses (e.g. china clay).

<text>Sergei Vadimovich Stepashin (; born 2 March 1952) is a Russian politician who briefly served as Prime Minister of Russia in 1999. Prior to this he had been appointed as federal security minister for counterintelligence by President Boris Yeltsin in 1994, a position from which he resigned in 1995 as a consequence of the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis. Subsequent to his tenure as Prime Minister he served as Chairman of the Accounts Chamber of Russia from 2000 until 2013.

==Early life and education==
Stepashin was born in Port-Arthur, Kvantun Oblast, USSR (now Lüshunkou, China) on 2 March 1952. He graduated from the Higher Political School of the USSR Ministry of the Interior (1973), in 1981 from the Lenin Military-Political Academy, and in 2002 from the Finance Academy. He is a Doctor of Law, Professor, and has a rank of the State Advisor on Justice of the Russian Federation. His military rank is colonel general.

==Career==
Stepashin served as the Head of the FSK (the predecessor of the FSB) from February 1994 until June 1995. He then became justice minister, serving from 1997 to March 1998, and interior minister, holding that office from March 1998 to May 1999, when he was appointed and confirmed by parliament as prime minister. Yeltsin made it fairly clear when he appointed him Prime Minister that Stepashin would only hold the position temporarily, and he was replaced in August 1999 by future president Vladimir Putin.

Stepashin&#x27;s attitude towards the Chechen conflict was markedly different from that of Vladimir Putin. Stepashin had, for example, presented leaders of the separatist regime in Chechnya with monogrammed pistols, praised the activities of the religious extremists who had taken over several Dagestani villages, and had proclaimed publicly: &quot;We can afford to lose Dagestan!&quot;.

After having been fired from the position of Prime Minister, Stepashin joined the political party Yabloko for the Russian parliamentary elections of 1999 and was elected to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament. Later on he resigned his parliamentary seat and became head of the Account Chamber of the Russian Federation, the federal audit agency. He held this job until 2013.

Since 2007, Stepashin is the head of the revived Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society.

On 27 March 2024, Stepashin met with the Vietnamese Ambassador to Russia Dang Minh Khoi () who is an expert on China and Northeast Asia Department affairs for the government of Vietnam.

<doc id="520752" wikidata="Q588931" url="?curid=520752" title="Gagetown, New Brunswick">
<text>Gagetown is a former village in Queens County, New Brunswick, Canada. It held village status prior to 2023 and is now part of the village of Arcadia. It is on the west bank of the Saint John River and is the county&#x27;s shire town.

==History==

Gagetown was originally named Grimross by the Acadians and Maliseet, who lived there prior to the Expulsion of the Acadians. The Raid on Grimross occurred during the St. John River Campaign (1758–59). During the Expulsion of the Acadians, many Acadians fled from various parts of the Maritimes to villages along the Saint John River. The St. John River Campaign occurred during the French and Indian War when Colonel Robert Monckton led a force of 1,150 British soldiers to destroy the Acadian settlements on the banks of the Saint John River until they reached the largest village of Ste Anne&#x27;s Point (present day Fredericton, New Brunswick) in February 1759. There were 2000 Acadians on the Saint John River, many of whom were refugees trying to escape the Expulsion of the Acadians.

On November 4, 1758, Robert Monckton entered the nearly vacant village and New England Rangers under his command chased down and scalped Acadians. They burned 50 buildings, crops and killed the animals.

The name of the village is derived from British General Thomas Gage. Major General Thomas Gage was granted a large tract of land in central New Brunswick in appreciation of his service to the British Empire in the Seven Years&#x27; War; this land comprises modern day Gagetown.

During the 1800s and early 1900s, Gagetown was a historic Loyalist community that served as a stop for river boats. It is the birthplace of Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley, a Father of Confederation.

The nearby army training centre, CFB Gagetown, takes its name from the community, although its headquarters are in Oromocto. Despite sharing the name, Gagetown has no direct access to the base and its training area.

Every Summer since 2009 a local music &amp; art collective known as FEELS GOOD and the North Hampton Brewing Company (which produces a local microbrew known as Picaroons) has produced and hosted a 3-day music festival known as Folly Fest. Folly Fest generally falls on the weekend closest to the split of June &amp; July.

The Gagetown Ferry, formerly a free cable ferry, crossed the Saint John River to Lower Jemseg on the east bank, but in 2015 the Liberal Government cut the ferry for provincial budget reasons. In 2020, the Gagetown ferry service was restored but only for the summer tourist season.

On 1 January 2023, Gagetown amalgamated with the village of Cambridge-Narrows and all or part of five local service districts to form the new village of Arcadia. The community&#x27;s name remains in official use.

== Climate ==
Gagetown has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summers, cold winters and plenty of precipitation year-round. Snowfall is frequent in winter.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Gagetown had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Notable people==
* John Montgomery was born in Gagetown. He owned the tavern (Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern in Toronto, Ontario) which served as a base for the rebels during the Upper Canada Rebellion. His parents were loyalists who fled from New York following the American revolution.
* Annie Babbitt Bulyea (1863–1934) was born in Gagetown. She was a Canadian temperance leader.

<doc id="520754" wikidata="Q270529" url="?curid=520754" title="Yevgeny Primakov">
<text>Yevgeny Maksimovich Primakov (29 October 1929 – 26 June 2015, ) was a Russian politician and diplomat who served as Prime Minister of Russia from 1998 to 1999. During his long career, he also served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1996 to 1998, the Director of Foreign Intelligence from 1991 to 1996, and Speaker of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union from 1990 to 1991. Primakov was an academician (Arabist) and a member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

==Personal life==
Primakov was born in Kyiv in the Ukrainian SSR, and grew up in Tbilisi in the Georgian SSR.

Primakov&#x27;s father&#x27;s surname was Nemchenko. He had been imprisoned in the Gulag during the Stalinist purges. Primakov&#x27;s mother was Jewish, named Anna Yakovlevna Primakova. She worked as an obstetrician and was a cousin of the famous physiologist .

Primakov was educated at the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies, graduating in 1953, and carried out postgraduate work at Moscow State University. He graduated with a degree in Arabic.

His grandson is Yevgeny Primakov Jr. (), a journalist, TV host, politician and diplomat.

==Early career==
From 1956 to 1970, he worked as a journalist for Soviet radio and a Middle Eastern correspondent for &quot;Pravda&quot; newspaper. During this time, he was sent frequently on intelligence missions to the Middle East and the United States as a KGB co-optee under codename MAKSIM. Primakov reportedly may have been coerced into joining the intelligence services.

As a Senior Researcher at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, Primakov entered into scientific society in 1962. From 30 December 1970 to 1977, he served as deputy director of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, part of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. In this role he participated in the Dartmouth Conferences alongside, among others, Charles Yost. From 1977 to 1985 he was Director of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the USSR Academy of Sciences. During this time he was also First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee. In 1985 he returned to the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, serving as Director until 1989.

Primakov became involved in national politics in 1989, as the Chairman of the Soviet of the Union, one of two chambers of the Soviet parliament. From 1990 until 1991 he was a member of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s Presidential Council of the Soviet Union. He served as Gorbachev&#x27;s special envoy to Iraq in the run-up to the Persian Gulf War, in which capacity he held talks with President Saddam Hussein to try to convince him to withdraw Iraqi forces from Kuwait.

== Foreign intelligence chief (1991–1996) ==
After the failed August 1991 putsch, Primakov was appointed First Deputy Chairman of the KGB and Director of the KGB First Chief Directorate responsible for foreign intelligence.

After the formation of the Russian Federation, Primakov shepherded the transition of the KGB First Chief Directorate to the control of the Russian Federation government, under the new name Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Primakov preserved the old KGB foreign intelligence apparatus under the new SVR label, and led no personnel purges or structural reforms. He served as SVR director from 1991 until 1996.

== Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs (1996–1998) ==
Primakov served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from January 1996 until September 1998. As foreign minister, he gained respect at home and abroad, with a reputation as a tough but pragmatic supporter of Russia&#x27;s interests and as an opponent of NATO&#x27;s expansion into the former Eastern Bloc, though on 27 May 1997, after five months of negotiation with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, Russia signed the Founding Act, which is seen as marking the end of Cold War hostilities. He supported Slobodan Milošević during the Yugoslav Wars.

He was also famously an advocate of multilateralism as an alternative to American global hegemony following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Primakov called for a Russian foreign policy based on low-cost mediation while expanding influence towards the Middle East and the former Soviet republics. Called the &quot;Primakov doctrine&quot;, beginning in 1999, he promoted Russia, China, and India as a &quot;strategic triangle&quot; to counterbalance the United States. The move was interpreted by some observers as an agreement to fight together against &#x27;colour revolutions&#x27; in Central Asia.

== Prime Minister of Russia (1998–1999) ==

After Yeltsin&#x27;s bid to reinstate Viktor Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister of Russia was blocked by the State Duma in September 1998, the President turned to Primakov as a compromise figure whom he rightly judged would be accepted by the parliament&#x27;s majority. As Prime Minister, Primakov was given credit for forcing some very difficult reforms in Russia; most of them, such as the tax reform, became major successes. Following the 1998 harvest, which was the worst in 45 years, coupled with a plummeting ruble, one of Primakov&#x27;s first actions as Prime Minister, in October 1998, was to appeal to the United States and Canada for food aid, while also appealing to the European Union for economic relief.

While Primakov&#x27;s opposition to perceived US unilateralism was popular among some Russians, it also led to a breach with the West during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and isolated Russia during subsequent developments in the former Yugoslavia.

On 24 March 1999, Primakov was heading to Washington, D.C. for an official visit. Flying over the Atlantic Ocean, he learned that NATO had started to bomb Yugoslavia. Primakov decided to cancel the visit, ordered the plane to turn around over the ocean and returned to Moscow in a manoeuvre popularly dubbed &quot;Primakov&#x27;s Loop&quot;.

Yeltsin fired Primakov on 12 May 1999, ostensibly over the sluggish pace of the Russian economy. Many analysts believed the firing of Primakov reflected Yeltsin&#x27;s fear of losing power to a more successful and popular person, although sources close to Yeltsin said at the time that the president viewed Primakov as being too close to the Communist Party. Primakov himself would have had good chances as a candidate for the presidency. Primakov had refused to dismiss Communist ministers while the Communist Party was leading the process of preparing unsuccessful impeachment proceedings against the president. Ultimately, Yeltsin resigned at the end of the year and was succeeded by his last prime minister, Vladimir Putin, whom Primakov had tried to fire from his role as head of the FSB when he tapped the phone of the Duma President. Primakov&#x27;s dismissal was extremely unpopular with the Russian population: according to a poll, 81% of the population did not approve of the decision, and even among the liberal pro-Western party Yabloko supporters, 84% did not approve of the dismissal.

==Post-PM career==
After 1988, Primakov held several roles: Academic Secretary of the World Economy and International Relations Division, director of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations and member of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union.

Before Yeltsin&#x27;s resignation, Primakov supported the Fatherland – All Russia electoral faction, which at that time was the major opponent of the pro-Putin Unity, and launched his presidential bid. Initially considered the man to beat, Primakov was rapidly overtaken by the factions loyal to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in the December 1999 Duma elections. Primakov officially abandoned the presidential race in his TV address on 4 February 2000 less than two months before the 26 March presidential elections. Soon he became an adviser to Putin and a political ally. On 14 December 2001, Primakov became President of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a position he held until 2011.
In February and March 2003, he visited Iraq and held talks with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, as a special representative of President Putin. He passed on a message from Putin calling for Hussein to resign voluntarily. He tried to prevent the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a move which received some support from several nations opposed to the war. Primakov suggested that Hussein must hand over all Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction to the United Nations, among other things. However, Hussein told Primakov that he was confident that nothing would befall him personally—a belief that was later proven incorrect. Primakov later claimed Hussein&#x27;s execution in 2006 was rushed to prevent him from revealing information on Iraq–United States relations that could embarrass the U.S. government. In a 2006 speech Primakov thundered that: &quot;The collapse of the US policies pursued in Iraq delivered a fatal blow on the American doctrine of unilateralism.&quot;

On 26 May 2008, Primakov was elected as a member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 2009, the University of Niš, Serbia awarded Primakov an honorary doctorate.

In November 2004, Primakov testified in defense of the former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević, on trial for war crimes. He had earlier led a Russian delegation that met with Milošević during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in March 1999.

==Death==

Primakov died in Moscow on 26 June 2015, at the age of 85, after prolonged illness (liver cancer). He was buried with military honours at Novodevichy Cemetery. He was lionized in Russia obituaries as &quot;the Russian Kissinger&quot;, and President Vladimir Putin said Primakov had made a &quot;colossal contribution to the formation of modern Russia... This is a sad, grievous loss for our society. … Yevgeny&#x27;s authority was respected both in our country and abroad...&quot; Indeed, &quot;his death occurred at a time when his positions [were] very much the official line and the backbone for Putin&#x27;s grand strategy.&quot;

In honor of Primakov, Primakov Readings was established in October 2015 - an annual international summit aimed at promoting dialogue on current global trends in the world economy, international politics and security among high-ranking experts, diplomats and decision-makers from around the Globe, organized by the Institute of World Economy and International Relations and held in Moscow.

One of his credos was: &quot;Those who do good will be rewarded. Life gets even with those who do bad.&quot;

<text>The Tamar River, officially kanamaluka / River Tamar, is a estuary located in northern Tasmania, Australia. Despite being called a river, the waterway is a brackish and tidal estuary over its entire length.

==Location and features==
Formed by the confluence of the North Esk and South Esk rivers at , kanamaluka / River Tamar flows generally north towards its mouth at Low Head, north of the settlement George Town and into the Bass Strait via Port Dalrymple. kanamaluka / River Tamar has several minor tributaries including the Supply River.

Low Head Lighthouse is located at the tip of a peninsula, on the east side of the mouth of the river. The only full crossing of the river is the Batman Bridge in the relatively remote area of Sidmouth, around halfway up the river.

The Tamar river is complicated in that it silts up frequently, a contributing factor to its slow decline in use. Over time dredging operations have been required. A scheme enacted between the 1920s and 1970s planned to partially dam the river and slow the flow around the western side of Tamar Island and speed up the flow around the eastern side (the main channel), by sinking 14 boats to disrupt water flow. The success or not of this scheme is debated.

Although the Port of Launceston is now used very little in comparison to the past and the SeaCat Tasmania ferry no longer docks at George Town, the river still is used for shipping, with light and heavy industries at George Town including aluminium smelters as well as commercial boat cruises.

==Etymology==
The Tamar River was named after the River Tamar in South West England by Colonel William Paterson in December 1804.

==Fishing==
The last 10 kilometres of the Tamar river estuary are smooth and sheltered waters (observe tides and weather). 
The Clarence Point boat ramp has good picnic amenities, toilets, and a pontoon on the western side. 
The more wind exposed basic boat ramp at Kelso is a few kilometres further north.
George Town, a significant port town, is on the eastern side and has lots of amenities close by. 
The Low head basic boat ramp is also on the eastern side, just past pilot bay, a few kilometres further north.

<doc id="520756" wikidata="Q2304610" url="?curid=520756" title="Interrogative word">
<text>An interrogative word or question word is a function word used to ask a question, such as &quot;what, which&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;where&quot;, &quot;who, whom, whose&quot;, &quot;why&quot;, &quot;whether&quot; and &quot;how&quot;. They are sometimes called wh-words, because in English most of them start with &quot;wh-&quot; (compare Five Ws). Most may be used in both direct (&quot;Where is he going?&quot;) and in indirect questions (&quot;I wonder where he is going&quot;). In English and various other languages the same forms are also used as relative pronouns in certain relative clauses (&quot;The country where he was born&quot;) and certain adverb clauses (&quot;I go where he goes&quot;). It can also be used as a modal, since question words are more likely to appear in modal sentences, like (&quot;Why was he walking?&quot;)

A particular type of interrogative word is the interrogative particle, which serves to convert a statement into a yes–no question, without having any other meaning. Examples include &quot;est-ce que&quot; in French, ли &quot;li&quot; in Russian, &quot;czy&quot; in Polish, чи &quot;chy in&quot; Ukrainian, &quot;ĉu&quot; in Esperanto, &quot;āyā&quot; آیا in Persian, কি &quot;ki&quot; in Bengali, / &quot;ma&quot; in Mandarin Chinese, &#x27;/&#x27;/&quot;/&quot; in Turkish, &quot;pa&quot; in Ladin, &quot;ka&quot; in Japanese, &quot;kka&quot; in Korean, &quot;ko/kö&quot; in Finnish, &quot;tat&quot; in Catalan, (да) ли &quot;(da) li&quot; in Serbo-Croatian and and in Basque. &quot;Is it true that...&quot; and &quot;... right?&quot; would be a similar construct in English. Such particles contrast with other interrogative words, which form what are called &quot;wh&quot;-questions rather than yes–no questions.

For more information about the grammatical rules for using formed questions in various languages, see Interrogative.

==In English==

Interrogative words in English can serve as interrogative determiners, interrogative pronouns, or interrogative adverbs. Certain pronominal adverbs may also be used as interrogative words, such as &quot;whereby&quot; or &quot;wherefore&quot;.

=== Interrogative determiner ===
The interrogative words &quot;which&quot;, &quot;what&quot; and &quot;whose&quot; are interrogative determiners when specifying a noun or nominal phrase: The question &quot;Which farm is the county’s largest?&quot; specifies the noun &quot;farm&quot; as definite, while &quot;What farm?&quot; is indefinite. In the question &quot;Whose gorgeous, pink painting is that?&quot;, &quot;whose&quot; is the interrogative, personal, possessive determiner prompting a specification for the possessor of the noun phrase &quot;gorgeous pink painting&quot;.

=== Interrogative pronoun ===
The interrogative words &quot;who&quot;, &quot;whom&quot;, &quot;whose&quot;, &quot;what&quot; and &quot;which&quot; are interrogative pronouns when used in the place of a noun or noun phrase. In the question &quot;Who is the leader?&quot;, the interrogative word &quot;who&quot; is a interrogative pronoun because it stands in the place of the noun or noun phrase the question prompts (e.g. &quot;the king&quot; or &quot;the woman with the crown&quot;). Similarly, in the question &quot;Which leads to the city center?&quot; the interrogative word &quot;which&quot; is an interrogative pronoun because it stands in the place of a noun or noun phrase (e.g. &quot;the road to the north&quot; or &quot;the river to your east&quot;). Note, &quot;which&quot; is an interrogative pronoun, not an interrogative determiner, because there is no noun or noun phrase present to serve as a determiner for. Consequently, in the question &quot;Which leads to the city center?&quot; the word &quot;which&quot; is an interrogative pronoun; when in the question &quot;Which road leads to the city center?&quot; the word &quot;which&quot; is an interrogative determiner for the noun &quot;road&quot;.

=== Interrogative adverb ===
The interrogative words &quot;where, when, how, why, whether, whatsoever&quot;, and the more archaic &quot;whither&quot; and &quot;whence&quot; are interrogative adverbs when they modify a verb. In the question &quot;How did you announce the deal?&quot; the interrogative word &quot;how&quot; is an interrogative adverb because it modifies the verb &quot;did&quot; (past tense of &quot;to do&quot;). In the question &quot;Why should I read that book?&quot; the interrogative word &quot;why&quot; is an interrogative adverb because it describes the verb &quot;should&quot;.

Note, in direct questions, interrogative adverbs always describe auxiliary verbs such as &quot;did&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, &quot;must&quot;, or &quot;might&quot;.

===Yes–no questions===
A yes–no question can begin with an interrogative subject-verb inversion involving an auxiliary verb (or negative contraction), sometimes even if it is not performing the auxiliary function:
* A finite inflection of (e.g. Are you hungry?, Are you working from home today?)
* A finite inflection of have (e.g. Have you any soup? Hasn’t she eaten lunch?)
* A conjugation of (e.g. Do you want fries?) - see 
* A conjugation of a (e.g. Can&#x27;t you move any faster?)

English questions can also be formed without an interrogative word as the first word, by changing the intonation or punctuation of a statement. For example: &quot;You&#x27;re done eating?&quot;

===Forms with &quot;-ever&quot;===
Most English interrogative words can take the suffix &quot;-ever&quot;, to form words such as &quot;whatever&quot; and &quot;wherever&quot;. (Older forms of the suffix are &quot;-so&quot; and &quot;-soever&quot;, as in &quot;whoso&quot; and &quot;whomsoever&quot;.) These words have the following main meanings:
*As more emphatic interrogative words, often expressing disbelief or puzzlement in mainly rhetorical questions: &quot;Whoever could have done such a thing? Wherever has he gone?&quot;
*To form free relative clauses, as in &quot;I&#x27;ll do whatever you do&quot;, &quot;Whoever challenges us shall be punished&quot;, &quot;Go to wherever they go&quot;. In this use, the nominal &quot;-ever&quot; words (&quot;who(m)ever&quot;, &quot;whatever&quot;, &quot;whichever&quot;) can be regarded as indefinite pronouns or as relative pronouns. 
*To form adverbial clauses with the meaning &quot;no matter where/who/etc.&quot;: &quot;Wherever they hide, I will find them.&quot;

Some of these words have also developed independent meanings, such as &quot;however&quot; as an adverb meaning &quot;nonetheless&quot;; &quot;whatsoever&quot; as an emphatic adverb used with &quot;no&quot;, &quot;none&quot;, &quot;any&quot;, &quot;nothing&quot;, etc. (&quot;I did nothing wrong whatsoever&quot;); and &quot;whatever&quot; in its slang usage.

==Other languages==
A frequent class of interrogative words in several other languages is the interrogative verb:

*Korean:
*Mongolian:
=== Australian Aboriginal languages ===
Interrogative pronouns in Australian Aboriginal languages are a diverse set of lexical items with functions extending far beyond simply the formation of questions (though this is one of their uses). These pronominal stems are sometimes called ignoratives or epistememes because their broader function is to convey differing degrees of perceptual or epistemic certainty. Often, a singular ignorative stem may serve a variety of interrogative functions that would be expressed by different lexical items in, say, English through contextual variation and interaction with other morphology such as case-marking. In Jingulu, for example, the single stem &quot;nyamba&quot; may come to mean &#x27;what&#x27;, &#x27;where&#x27;, &#x27;why&#x27; or &#x27;how&#x27; through combination with locative, dative, ablative, and instrumental case suffixes:


(Adapted from Pensalfini)

Other closely related languages, however, have less interrelated ways of forming wh-questions with separate lexemes for each of these wh-pronouns. This includes Wardaman, which has a collection of entirely unrelated interrogative stems: &quot;yinggiya&quot; &#x27;who&#x27;, &quot;ngamanda&quot; &#x27;what&#x27;, &quot;guda&quot; &#x27;where&#x27;, &quot;nyangurlang&quot; &#x27;when&#x27;, &quot;gun.garr-ma&quot; &#x27;how many/what kind&#x27;.

Mushin (1995) and Verstraete (2018) provide detailed overviews of the broader functions of ignoratives in an array of languages. The latter focuses on the lexeme &quot;ngaani&quot; in many Paman Languages which can have a Wh-like interrogative function but can also have a sense of epistemic indefiniteness or uncertainty like &#x27;some&#x27; or &#x27;perhaps;&#x27; see the following examples from Umpithamu:

Wh-question
Adnominal / Determiner
Adverbial

<text>2063 Bacchus, provisional designation , is a stony asteroid and near-Earth object of the Apollo group, approximately 1 kilometer in diameter. The contact binary was discovered on 24 April 1977, by American astronomer Charles Kowal at the Palomar Observatory in California, United States. It was named after Bacchus from Roman mythology.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Bacchus&quot; orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.7–1.5 AU once every 1 years and 1 month (409 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.35 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid&#x27;s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Palomar. Due to its eccentric orbit, it is also a Venus-crosser.

=== Approaches ===

&quot;Bacchus&quot; has an &quot;Earth minimum orbital intersection distance&quot; of , which corresponds to 26.4 lunar distances. On 31 March 1996, it passed from Earth.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the SMASS classification, &quot;Bacchus&quot; is a Sq-type, that transitions from the common S-type asteroids to the Q-type asteroids. It is a contact binary with bilobate shape.

In March 1996 radar observations were conducted at the Goldstone Observatory under the direction of JPL scientists Steven Ostro and Lance Benner, allowing the construction of a model of the object. Optical observations were conducted by Petr Pravec, Marek Wolf, and Lenka Šarounová during March and April 1996. It was also photometrically observed by American astronomer Brian Warner in 2015.

According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Bacchus&quot; measures 1.03 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.19. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and derives a diameter of 1.05 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 17.25.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named for the Roman god Bacchus (Dionysus).The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 August 1978 ().

<text>Clarksville is an unincorporated community in Howard County, Maryland; the second highest-earning county in the United States according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The community is named for William Clark, a farmer who owned much of the land on which the community now lies and served as a postal stop that opened on the 4th of July 1851.

Montrose and Richland Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

==History==
In 1699, Thomas Browne, a Patuxent Ranger, ranged the river from the Snowden plantation to where Clarksville is sited. The area was settled with tobacco plantations such as Folly Quarter and Hobbs Regulation with slave labor. In 1838, Dr. William Watkins of Richland Manor proposed the &quot;Howard District&quot; of Anne Arundel County, which became Howard County in 1851. Clarksville&#x27;s name originates from John R. Clark&#x27;s family who immigrated from Ireland to the Howard District of Anne Arundel County in 1790. The land he purchased included Jack Howard&#x27;s blacksmith shop, one of the few African American operated blacksmith&#x27;s in the county. Clarksville postal office listed the population as just 65 in the 1930s with the key industry of agriculture and limestone mining. Numerous apple orchards were situated between Clarksville and Ashton. In 1869 the town became the terminus of the ten mile Ellicott City and Clarksville turnpike built over the old Sandy Spring road, a ten-mile private toll road created in a time before county maintained roads which later became route 108.

==Schooling==
There are four public schools located in Clarksville, Maryland. There are two elementary schools, Pointers Run Elementary School and Clarksville Elementary School, while there is one middle school, Clarksville Middle School, and one high school, River Hill High School. All four schools are part of the Howard County Public School System (HCPSS).

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Clarksville has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==People==
The following are notable people who were born or live in Clarksville, Maryland:
*Lefty Clarke, Major League Baseball pitcher who played in one game on October 2, 1921. 
*Kevin Johnson, retired NFL cornerback.
*Donovan Pines EFL League 1, player for Barnsley F.C..
*Varun Ram, former Maryland Terrapins basketball player.
*Beau Brade, current Baltimore Ravens football player.

<text>The Batman Bridge is a modern road bridge that carries the Batman Highway across the Tamar River, between Whirlpool Reach, Hillwood at its eastern end and Sidmouth / Deviot midpoint at its western end, in north Tasmania, Australia. The bridge connects the Batman Highway with the West Tamar Highway (state route A7) and the East Tamar Highway (state route A8). The bridge overlooks the Deviot Sailing Club and is named in honour of John Batman, a Launceston businessman and co-founder of Melbourne.

==Design features==
Built between 1966 and 1968, it was the first cable-stayed bridge in Australia and among the first such bridges in the world. The main span is long, suspended from a steel A-frame tower. The deck is wide. The tower is on the west bank of the Tamar river, on a solid dolerite rock base which carries 78% of the weight of the main span. The length of the bridge is between abutments. The east bank is soft clay not capable of supporting a bridge. A causeway carries the highway across this softer base, supported by four piers built on piles driven up to into the clay. The bridge deck is constructed of steel.

<doc id="520773" wikidata="Q376983" url="?curid=520773" title="William John Patterson">
<text>William John Patterson (May 13, 1886 – June 10, 1976) was a Liberal politician and the sixth premier of Saskatchewan from 1935 to 1944. He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in the 1921 election. He succeeded James G. Gardiner to become the province&#x27;s first Saskatchewan-born premier.

Patterson&#x27;s leadership was considered to be uninspired. He was unable to resist the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation&#x27;s rise to power in the 1944 election under Tommy Douglas. Patterson&#x27;s Liberals were reduced to five seats in the Legislature. He resigned as Liberal leader in 1946.

Patterson served as the tenth lieutenant governor of Saskatchewan from 1951 to 1958, becoming the first person to have been both premier and lieutenant governor of the province.

==Early life==
Paterson was born on May 13, 1886, in Grenfell in what was then the District of Assiniboia of the North-West Territories. His father, John Patterson, had moved to Grenfell in 1882 to work as a railway section foreman during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. His mother, Catherine Fraser, was an immigrant from Scotland.

Patterson left school at 15 and found work first at a bank and then in the Saskatchewan Department of Telephones. Following the outbreak of World War I, Patterson in 1916 enlisted in the Canadian Army, serving as a cavalry officer. He was wounded in September 1918.

Upon his return to Saskatchewan after the war, he studied law in Grenfell under lawyer G.C. Neff and then moved to Windthorst, Saskatchewan to set up a financial and insurance agency.

==Politics==
Patterson ran in the Saskatchewan general election of 1921, as the Saskatchewan Liberal Party&#x27;s candidate for the constituency of Pipestone. Patterson won the district and took his seat in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. Patterson held several cabinet positions in governments headed by Premier James Garfield Gardiner. He was reelected in the 1925 election and the 1929 election, but in the latter case, the Liberals lost the election and so Patterson moved to the Opposition. In the 1934 election, the Liberals returned to power, and Patterson returned to cabinet.

In 1935, Premier Gardiner left provincial politics to become Canadian Minister of Agriculture under Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. Patterson was elected as Gardiner&#x27;s successor as leader of the Liberal Party of Saskatchewan and Premier of Saskatchewan. Taking office in the midst of the Great Depression, Patterson sought to extend social programs to assist those in need. His government increased funding for education, enacted pension and debt relief legislation, and expanded public funding for treatment of tuberculosis, cancer, and polio.

However, Patterson subscribed to the conventional wisdom of the day that deficit spending would ruin the province&#x27;s credit and he thus therefore refused to run a budget deficit, instead funding the increased government spending through a new sales tax. His government also passed legislation making it easier to form credit unions, permitting the formation of unions, and increasing labour standards.

Patterson won re-election in the 1938 election and continued to serve as premier. In the 1944 election, however, the Liberals were easily defeated by the Saskatchewan Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, under the leadership of Tommy Douglas. Patterson served as Leader of the Opposition until 1946, when he resigned as Liberal leader. He remained a Member of the Legislative Assembly and was a candidate in the 1948 election, and was re-elected as the member from Cannington.

Following his resignation, Patterson took up a position with the federal Board of Transport Commissioners.
In 1951, Patterson was appointed as the first Saskatchewan-born Lieutenant Governor. He served in this post until 1958. Upon Patterson&#x27;s retirement, Douglas introduced special legislation to provide Patterson with a pension to thank for his many years of service to the province.

Patterson then lived quietly in retirement until his death in Regina, on June 10, 1976.
== Electoral record ==

=== Saskatchewan general elections, 1938 and 1944 ===

==== 1938 General election ====


Patterson led the Liberals in the general election of 1938. He won a solid majority government. The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation under George Hara Williams came in second place and continued as the Official Opposition.

2 Leader of the Opposition when election was called; Leader of the Opposition after election.

==== 1944 General election ====


Provincial elections are normally held between four and five years after the previous election, but this election was delayed because of World War II. Patterson again led the Liberals in the general election of 1944, but this time was soundly defeated by Tommy Douglas and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.

Patterson stood for election to the Legislative Assembly eight times, in two different ridings, Pipestone and Cannington. He was elected once by acclamation and seven times in contested elections.

<doc id="520785" wikidata="Q1263008" url="?curid=520785" title="Macrophilia">
<text>Macrophilia is a fascination with or a sexual fantasy involving giants, most commonly expressed as giant humans, as well as giant objects. In 2023, the Giantess kink was found to be the most popular kink searched for on the website Clips4Sale. Generally, depictions range from sexually explicit actions to non-sexual interactions while still providing sexual stimulation for those with the fantasy.

Online communities refer to this subculture as macro fetish or GTS fetish, an abbreviation of &quot;giantess&quot;.

==Description==
Although macrophilia literally translates to simply a &quot;lover of large&quot;, in the context of a sexual fantasy, it is used to denote attraction to beings larger than themselves. Males who are attracted to larger females are known as Amazon chasers. Generally, the interest differs among macrophiles, and depends on gender and sexual orientation. Macrophiles often enjoy the feel of being physically smaller, ranging from sadomasochistic fantasies such as being abused, degraded, dominated, or eaten, to friendly fantasies such as being rescued, protected and befriended by the larger, typically heroic female, and they often view the much taller being as powerful and dominating. 

Psychologist Mark Griffiths speculates that the roots of macrophilia may lie in sexual arousal in childhood and early adolescence that is accidentally associated with giants.

Speculating on why there are not as many female macrophiles, psychologist Helen Friedman theorized that women who already view men as dominant and powerful have no need to fantasize about it. Still there exists a presence of women who can enjoy both aspects of macrophilia. Women who take on the roles of the giantess within this fetish often find the practice to be empowering and enjoy being worshipped.

One article in Men&#x27;s Health argues that because the pressures faced by men tend to be greater, “becoming unimportant or unnoticed in the presence of an unconquerable creature could be a brief respite”.

==Community==
===Internet===

The internet has played an important role in helping to develop the fetish. The pornography site Pornhub&#x27;s 2015 annual report showed that compared to 2014, the biggest increase in search topic was giantess, which had a 1091 percent gain in searches. There also existed an exhibit at the Museum of Sex titled &quot;Kink: Geography of the Erotic Imagination&quot; which explored many different fantasies, including macrophilia.

Online content creators have also developed homemade media that has helped grow the fetish&#x27;s reach. In addition to generating content across websites, some content creators have even branded themselves in ways that helped them generate a following and gain revenue for their work. After data was gathered from 4,814,732 videos on clips4sale, an established porn site, it was found that &quot;giantess&quot; was the 34th most popular category.

The macro community has produced fiction writing, digital art, and collages on websites such as DeviantArt and Pixiv. Dedicated macrophilia websites include Giantess World, the Giantess City forums, and the male-centered CoiledFist and GTF productions, Karbo, Eskoz, and AshkiiWolf are among the more popular artists.

===Video games===

Macrophilia video games have also been developed; &quot;Sizebox&quot; is a sandbox game in which players import models and create scenes. &quot;Resize Me!&quot; is an anime VR game in development; the player is gradually shrunken by their childhood friend and toyed with.

The popularity of &quot;Resident Evil Village&#x27;s&quot; antagonist Lady Dimitrescu has been attributed to her giant size.

===Real-world experience===
One way macrophiles enjoy their fetish physically is by scheduling private sessions with extraordinarily tall women to engage in non-sexual interactions; trampling, lifting and carrying, foot worshiping, roleplaying and domination.

SizeCon is an annual event for people who enjoy size changing to gather in person. Since 2016 it has provided a place for fans to showcase art, socials to discuss various aspects of the fetish, and roleplay opportunities.

<text>Helix is a database management system for the Apple Macintosh platform, created in 1983. Helix uses a graphical &quot;programming language&quot; to add logic to its applications, allowing non-programmers to construct sophisticated applications. Helix was the first multiuser database on any PC platform, the first object-based, visual programming tool and the first relational database on a PC platform.

==History==

Originally created by Odesta Corporation of Northbrook, IL in 1983 on the original Macintosh, Helix debuted to rave reviews when it was first released in late 1984.

At that time the Mac only supported 440 kB floppy disks as storage. Users initially ran Helix from a floppy disk with Helix installed on the &quot;system disk,&quot; which was where the operating system lived before the age of hard disk storage. This configuration left little room for applications or data. It was assumed that users would add a second floppy for any sort of real-world use, with the OS and Helix on one floppy, and data on another. In spite of these initial limitations, Helix was a powerful relational database.

In May 1986, Odesta released Double Helix. The main new feature set allowed for the construction of custom menus and menu bars, resulting in &quot;stand-alone&quot; applications. In comparison, the original Helix produced applications that were clearly running within Helix. Released as a part of a larger suite of software, the Helix suite also included a stand-alone runtime version known as RunTime Helix which would allow users to run Double Helix applications without the full version installed, as well as MultiUser Helix which operated in a client–server fashion.

Upgrades to the Helix product line were continuous during the 1980s, but the company spent a tremendous amount of time and money working on a version known as Remote Helix which ran the basic Helix development system on top of VAX based databases. The idea was to offer a Mac-like experience on &quot;big iron&quot; systems, a common theme in the early 1990s. The company also released a number of related tools, GeoQuery and Data Desk, for analyzing databases. However it wasn&#x27;t long before the popularity of the VAX faded, and the product was never a major success.

In 1992 Odesta split up, with the original Helix applications being spun off. Double Helix re-emerged as Helix Express at Helix Technologies, marketed as a performance leader as opposed to &quot;easy to use&quot;. The parent company became entangled in an unrelated but costly legal battle, and Helix languished. In 1998, Helix Technologies was purchased by The Chip Merchant, a San Diego–based memory vendor, who released a major upgrade in 2000, adding TCP/IP capabilities to Helix Client/Server and improving the performance of the entire product line significantly. However, falling memory prices and a slumping economy combined to drive The Chip Merchant into bankruptcy in 2002, sending Helix into legal limbo. It was purchased in 2004 by two of the people who were running its day-to-day operations, Gil Numeroff and Matt Strange, with financial backing from an unnamed businessman and long-time Helix user, forming a new company: QSA ToolWorks.

QSA brought Helix co-creator Larry Atkin back into the Helix fold and later brought back Steve Keyser, the original architect of MultiUser Helix. Dubbed the &quot;Helix Recovery Team&quot;, this new management and programming team began the task of rewriting the Classic Helix products to run natively under Mac OS X. The OS X Helix Server, along with three native diagnostic and maintenance tools, shipped in December 2005.

One month later, Apple announced the first products based on their switch from PowerPC to Intel processors, causing QSA to have to &quot;switch gears&quot; and begin the process of converting their code to Universal Binary format. This forced a conversion from the CodeWarrior IDE to Xcode, after which they produced Intel-native releases of their three &quot;end user&quot; products. Early versions (known as &quot;Preview Releases&quot;) were feature incomplete and unstable, but frequent updates (five in 2008 alone) addressed these issues. Nine more updates in 2009 and 2010 focused on completing the feature set, eradicating remaining bugs and improving performance.

At the same time, QSA started work on bringing the Helix IDE (known as &quot;Helix RADE&quot;) to OS X. Originally announced in December 2009 the project went by the code name of &quot;Europa&quot;, as an oblique reference to the movie &quot;2010&quot;. In June 2011, QSA began shipping ″Preliminary Releases″ — versions with some, but not all of the features ported to OS X. The porting of features continued through to completion in June 2013.

In September 2022, QSA Toolworks sold the Helix family of software to New Mexico–based Big Giant Donut Inc., a firm that had implemented Helix-based solutions at several manufacturing and technology companies. Larry Atkin and Steve Keyser joined Big Giant Donut to work on a new software platform called &quot;Donut&quot;, based on Helix concepts. Donut is intended to run on modern 64-bit hardware and to run client software within a browser. As they work on this, Big Giant Donut has made the most recent versions of the Helix software downloadable from their website for free.

==Description==

A Helix project is known as a &quot;Collection&quot;, a &quot;document&quot; created by Helix RADE (which stands for &quot;Rapid Application Development Environment&quot;). It is represented in the system by a sort of &quot;pseudo-desktop&quot; similar to the Macintosh Finder. A collection may contain thousands of individual databases (also known as relations or tables). Helix applications only open one Collection at a time. However, licenses can be purchased to allow access to numerous collections simultaneously, limited primarily by available memory.

Opening a collection results in a project window with two main parts driven entirely by a unique set of GUI objects. On the left are a number of &quot;icon wells&quot;, representing new objects that could be created, and a scrollable window on the right (known as the &quot;Collection Window&quot;) displays the objects that the user has created. Icons are dragged from the wells on the left into the window to create new objects in the collection. These objects include &quot;relations&quot; (tables) to hold data, &quot;sequences&quot; (macros) to automate tasks, and &quot;users&quot; to create custom menus for the end-user. This is one of Helix&#x27;s most unusual and powerful features.

In the Relation, database tables (groups of related data) are created. Relations contain fields to define datatypes, an &quot;abacus&quot; to define the relationships among data and create information the fields alone cannot present, indexes to organize data and improve performance, queries to find data, &quot;templates&quot; to structure information visually and for entering, modifying, deleting and printing from &quot;Views&quot; that combine templates, queries and indexes to give the user access to and control over information.

The abacus uses a completely graphical system for creating calculations. You describe the desired calculation by dragging icons representing operations and fields into the abacus&#x27; editor window, and then arrange them in a dataflow diagram. For example, to say &quot;first name followed by space followed by last name&quot;, you drag in a &quot;followed by&quot; icon, then drag the &quot;first name&quot; field into its first part and set a space character as its second part; then you drag in a second &quot;followed by&quot; icon, feed the output arrow from the first one into the second&#x27;s first part, and drag the &quot;last name&quot; field into its second part.

Helix RADE runs in two modes, Design mode and User mode. In User Mode the Helix collection opens in one of the defined user menu bars, allowing the user to use the database as they would any other application. Design mode allows the developer (or advanced user) to alter the design of the database, adding fields, creating new reports, etc.

Although intended to simplify programming, iconic programming languages often &quot;miss the point&quot;: programming is difficult not because you have to type, but because the complexity very quickly reaches a level where the project can no longer be understood. In theory a graphical language can help reduce this complexity considerably (see intentional programming for examples). In some cases, they do, but in many cases they make the problem worse. Helix is a very forgiving tool, allowing numerous routes to the same result. In the hands of an unskilled user, as with any tool, complex calculations can quickly become unwieldy, requiring that the programmer have a large monitor (or two) to work efficiently. However, skillful users find its visual approach both timesaving and liberating with few serious limitations.

Although quite adept at handling small to mid-size databases, a common problem for Helix is that for much of its lifetime, it has run only in the co-operative multitasking environment of the Classic Mac OS, making it rather unstable for large databases. Although the programming language itself has the scalability required to create complex databases, the inability to run reliably in a 24/7 environment relegates Helix to workgroups of 100 users or less. However, these limitations are rapidly becoming history. QSA released an OS X version of its Helix Server in December 2005 and is rolling out the rest of its product line in OS X versions in 2006 and 2007.

For someone familiar with Helix, the savings in development time can be significant. One expert who is also a leading Microsoft Access trainer/developer estimates that depending upon the size of the project, a Helix project can be finished in 30–70% of the time as the same Access project. The savings come particularly from the absence of a programming &quot;language,&quot; thus the elimination of all syntax errors. Since Helix, itself, prevents a developer from making syntactical or programming errors, the remaining sources of problems come from errors in business logic. All languages face this problem, but Helix once again softens the difficulty in tracking down the problems due to its object-based and graphical nature. Because all of the objects are linked (through icons, not through coding), the system &quot;knows&quot; what objects are used by other objects and in what way and simplifies tracking down business logic errors and also provides a simple method of determining everything that is about to be affected by a proposed change to any object.

==Limitations of Helix Visual Programming==

In Helix, one must compose all code graphically – thus, an if...then...else construct is built using flowchart-type widgets such as decision diamonds, and loops are implemented using connectors.

While Helix&#x27;s visual programming is possibly easier for novices to learn (because it uses a flowcharting paradigm that is intuitively understood by non-technical individuals), it can become tedious when the amount of code to be written becomes significant, especially for an individual who can write code much more easily and conveniently than if forced to drag icons from a palette.

To this end, when Helix RADE was updated to run natively on Intel Macs, an &quot;abacus expression language&quot; was added to provide this capability for those who needed it.

<text>Clara Lou &quot;Ann&quot; Sheridan (February 21, 1915 – January 21, 1967) was an American actress and singer. She is best known for her roles in the films &quot;San Quentin&quot; (1937) with Humphrey Bogart, &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (1938) with James Cagney and Bogart, &quot;They Drive by Night&quot; (1940) with George Raft and Bogart, &quot;City for Conquest&quot; (1940) with Cagney and Elia Kazan, &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1942) with Bette Davis, &quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942) with Ronald Reagan, &quot;Nora Prentiss&quot; (1947), and &quot;I Was a Male War Bride&quot; (1949) with Cary Grant.

== Early life ==
Clara Lou Sheridan was born in Denton, Texas, on February 21, 1915, the youngest of five children (Kitty, Pauline, Mabel, and George) of garage mechanic George W. Sheridan and Lula Stewart (née Warren). According to Sheridan, her father was a grandnephew of Civil War Union general Philip Sheridan.

She was active in dramatics at Denton High School and at North Texas State Teachers College. She also sang with the college&#x27;s stage band and played basketball on the North Texas women&#x27;s basketball team. Then, in 1933, Sheridan won the prize of a bit part in an upcoming Paramount film, &quot;Search for Beauty&quot;, when her sister Kitty entered Sheridan&#x27;s photograph into a beauty contest.

== Career ==
===Paramount===
After the release of &quot;Search for Beauty&quot; in 1934, Paramount put the 19-year-old under contract at a starting salary of $75 a week (), where she played mostly uncredited bit parts for the next two years. She can be glimpsed in the following 1934 films, and if credited, as Clara Lou Sheridan: &#x27;, &quot;Come On Marines!&quot;, &quot;Murder at the Vanities&quot;, &#x27;, &quot;Kiss and Make-Up&quot; with Cary Grant, &quot;The Notorious Sophie Lang&quot;, &quot;College Rhythm&quot; (directed by Norman Taurog whom Sheridan admired), &quot;Ladies Should Listen&quot; with Cary Grant, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; with Lee Tracy, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; with George Raft and Anna May Wong, and &quot;One Hour Late&quot;.

Along with fellow contractees, Sheridan worked with Paramount&#x27;s drama coach Nina Moise and performed on the studio lot in such plays as &quot;The Milky Way&quot; and &quot;The Pursuit of Happiness&quot;. While in &quot;The Milky Way&quot;, Paramount decided to change her first name from Clara Lou to the same as her character Ann.

Sheridan was then cast in the film at the behest of director and friend Mitchell Leisen. The role provided two standout scenes for the actress, including one in which her character commits suicide, to which she attributed Paramount&#x27;s keeping her under contract.

She continued with bit parts in with Elissa Landi and Cary Grant, with Randolph Scott and Evelyn Brent, and with George Raft and Carole Lombard, until her first lead role in &quot;Car 99&quot; (1935), with Fred MacMurray. &quot;No acting, it was just playing the lead, that&#x27;s all&quot;, she later said. She next had a support role as the romantic interest in &quot;Rocky Mountain Mystery&quot; (1935), a Randolph Scott Western.

She then appeared in with Bing Crosby and W. C. Fields, with George Raft in a brief speaking role for which she was billed as &quot;Nurse&quot; in the cast list at the end of the film, and (having one line) with Loretta Young. In her last picture under her deal with Paramount, the studio loaned her out to Poverty Row production company Talisman to make &quot;The Red Blood of Courage&quot; (1935) with Kermit Maynard. After this, Paramount declined to renew her contract. Sheridan made &quot;Fighting Youth&quot; (1935) at Universal and then signed a contract with Warner Bros. in 1936.

===Warner Bros.===

Sheridan&#x27;s career prospects began to improve at her new studio. Her early films for Warner Bros. included &quot;Sing Me a Love Song&quot; (1936); with Humphrey Bogart; &quot;The Great O&#x27;Malley&quot; (1937) with Pat O&#x27;Brien and Bogart, her first real break; , with O&#x27;Brien and Bogart, singing for the first time in a film; and &quot;Wine, Women and Horses&quot; (1937) with Barton MacLane.

Sheridan moved into B picture leads: &quot;The Footloose Heiress&quot; (1937); with John Litel; and &quot;She Loved a Fireman&quot; (1937) with Dick Foran for director John Farrow. She was a lead in and its sequel . Sheridan was in &quot;Little Miss Thoroughbred&quot; (1938) with Litel for Farrow and supported Dick Powell in &quot;Cowboy from Brooklyn&quot; (1938).

Universal borrowed her for a support role in at the behest of director John M. Stahl. For Farrow, she was in &quot;Broadway Musketeers&quot; (1938), a remake of &quot;Three on a Match&quot; (1932).

Sheridan&#x27;s notices in &quot;Letter of Introduction&quot; impressed Warner Bros. executives and she began to get roles in better quality pictures at her own studio starting with &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (1938), wherein she played James Cagney&#x27;s love interest; Bogart, O&#x27;Brien and the Dead End Kids had supporting roles. The film was a big hit and critically acclaimed.

Sheridan was reunited with the Dead End Kids in &quot;They Made Me a Criminal&quot; (1938) starring John Garfield. She was third-billed in the Western , playing a saloon owner opposite Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. The film was another success.

===Oomph girl===

In March 1939, Warner Bros. announced Sheridan had been voted by a committee of 25 men as the actress with the most &quot;oomph&quot; in America. &quot;Oomph&quot; was described as &quot;a certain indefinable something that commands male interest&quot;.

She received as many as 250 marriage proposals from fans in a single week. Sheridan reportedly loathed the sobriquet that made her a popular pin-up girl in the early 1940s. However, she expressed in a February 25, 1940, news story distributed by the Associated Press that she no longer &quot;bemoaned the &quot;oomph&quot; tag.&quot; She continued, &quot;But I&#x27;m sorry now. I know if it hadn&#x27;t been for &#x27;oomph&#x27; I&#x27;d probably still be in the chorus.&quot;

This was later referenced and spoofed on the 1941 animated short &quot;Hollywood Steps Out&quot;.

===Stardom===
Sheridan co-starred with Dick Powell in and played a wacky heiress in .

She was top billed in with O&#x27;Brien and &quot;Angels Wash Their Faces&quot; (1939) with the Dead End Kids and Ronald Reagan. &quot;Castle on the Hudson&quot; (1940) put her opposite Garfield and O&#x27;Brien.

Sheridan&#x27;s first real starring vehicle was &quot;It All Came True&quot; (1940), a musical comedy costarring Bogart and Jeffrey Lynn. She introduced the song &quot;Angel in Disguise&quot;.

Sheridan and Cagney were reunited in &quot;Torrid Zone&quot; (1940) with O&#x27;Brien in support. She was with George Raft, Bogart and Ida Lupino in &quot;They Drive by Night&quot; (1940), a smash-hit trucking melodrama. Sheridan was back with Cagney for &quot;City for Conquest&quot; (1941) and then made , a comedy with George Brent.
Sheridan did two lighter films: , a musical comedy, and with Bette Davis, wherein she played a character modeled on Gertrude Lawrence. She then made &quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942), in which she received top billing playing opposite Ronald Reagan, Robert Cummings, and Betty Field. It was a major success and one of Sheridan&#x27;s most memorable films.

Sheridan and Reagan were reunited for &quot;Juke Girl&quot; (1942) released about six weeks after &quot;Kings Row&quot;. She was in the war film &quot;Wings for the Eagle&quot; (1942) and made a comedy with Jack Benny, &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot; (1943). She played a Norwegian resistance fighter in with Errol Flynn and was one of the many Warner Bros. stars who had cameos in .

She was the heroine of a novel, &quot;Ann Sheridan and the Sign of the Sphinx&quot;, written by Kathryn Heisenfelt and published by Whitman Publishing Company in 1943. While the heroine of the story was identified as a famous actress, the stories were entirely fictitious. The story was probably written for a young teenaged audience and is reminiscent of the adventures of Nancy Drew. It is part of a series known as &quot;Whitman Authorized Editions&quot;, 16 books published between 1941 and 1947 that always featured a film actress as heroine.

Sheridan was given the lead in the musical , playing Nora Bayes, opposite Dennis Morgan. She was in a comedy, &quot;The Doughgirls&quot; (1944).

Sheridan was absent from screens for over a year, touring with the USO to perform in front of the troops as far afield as China. She returned in with Morgan. She had an excellent role in the noir &quot;Nora Prentiss&quot; (1947), which was a hit. It was followed by &#x27; (1948), a remake of &#x27;, and , a Western melodrama with Errol Flynn.

Leo McCarey borrowed her to support Gary Cooper in . She was meant to star in &quot;&quot;. She then left Warner Bros., saying: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t at all satisfied with the scripts they offered me.&quot;

===Freelance star===
Her role in &quot;I Was a Male War Bride&quot; (1949), directed by Howard Hawks and starring Cary Grant, was another success. In 1950, she appeared on the ABC musical television series &quot;Stop the Music&quot;.

She made , a comedy with Victor Mature at Fox.

In April 1949, she announced she wanted to produce &quot;Second Lady&quot;, a film based on a story by Eleanore Griffin. She was going to make &quot;My Forbidden Past&quot; (originally titled &quot;Carriage Entrance&quot;) at RKO. They fired her and Sheridan sued for $250,000 (equivalent to $ million today) &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the amount as $350,000 ($ million today). Sheridan ultimately won $55,162 ($ today).

===Universal===
Sheridan made &quot;Woman on the Run&quot; (1950), a noir also starring Dennis O&#x27;Keefe which she produced. She wanted to make a film called &quot;Her Secret Diary&quot;.

&quot;Woman on the Run&quot; was distributed by Universal, and Sheridan signed a contract with that studio. While there, she made , &quot;Just Across the Street&quot; (1952), and &quot;Take Me to Town&quot; (1953), a comedy with Sterling Hayden that was the first film directed by Douglas Sirk in the United States.

===Later career===
Sheridan starred with Glenn Ford in &quot;Appointment in Honduras&quot; (1953), directed by Jacques Tourneur. She appeared opposite Steve Cochran in &quot;Come Next Spring&quot; (1956) and was one of several stars in MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot; (1956), a remake of &quot;&quot; starring June Allyson, Joan Collins, Dolores Gray, Sheridan and Ann Miller. Her last film, &quot;Woman and the Hunter&quot; (1957), was shot in Africa.

She performed in stage tours of &quot;Kind Sir&quot; (1958) and &quot;Odd Man In&quot; (1959), and &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; at the Brussels World Fair in 1958. In all three shows, she acted with Scott McKay, whom she later married.

In 1962, she played the lead in the Western series &quot;Wagon Train&quot; episode titled &quot;The Mavis Grant Story&quot;.

In the mid-1960s, Sheridan appeared on the NBC soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;.

Her final role was as Henrietta Hanks in the television comedy Western series &quot;Pistols &#x27;n&#x27; Petticoats&quot;, which was filmed while she became increasingly ill in 1966, and was broadcast on CBS on Saturday nights. The 19th episode of the series, &quot;Beware the Hangman&quot;, aired as scheduled on the same day that she died in 1967.

For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Ann Sheridan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7024 Hollywood Boulevard.

== Personal life ==
Sheridan married actor Edward Norris August 16, 1936, in Ensenada, Mexico. They separated a year later and divorced in 1939. On January 5, 1942, she married fellow Warner Bros. star George Brent, who co-starred with her in &quot;Honeymoon for Three&quot; (1941); they divorced exactly one year later. Following her divorce from Brent, she had a long-term relationship with publicist Steve Hannagan that lasted until his death in 1953. Hannagan bequeathed Sheridan $218,399 (equivalent to $ million today).

Sheridan engaged in a romantic affair with Mexican actor Rodolfo Acosta, with whom she appeared in 1953&#x27;s &quot;Appointment in Honduras&quot;. She and the married Acosta shared an apartment in Mexico City for several years, and Sheridan was charged with criminal adultery in Mexican federal court in October, 1956, following an accusation by Acosta&#x27;s wife, Jeanine Cohen Acosta. Mexican authorities issued a warrant for Sheridan&#x27;s arrest. Nothing came of the criminal charges, and the relationship ended c. 1958.

On June 5, 1966, Sheridan married actor Scott McKay, who was with her when she died seven months later.

Sheridan supported Thomas E. Dewey in the 1948 presidential elections.

==Death==
In 1966, Sheridan began starring in a new television series, a Western-themed comedy called &quot;Pistols &#x27;n&#x27; Petticoats&quot;. She became ill during the filming and died of esophageal cancer with massive liver metastases at age 51 on January 21, 1967, in Los Angeles. She was cremated and her ashes were in the private vault at Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles until they were reinterred in a niche in the Chapel Columbarium at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in 2005.

<text>Charles Avery Dunning (July 31, 1885 – October 1, 1958) was the third premier of Saskatchewan. Born in England, he emigrated to Canada at the age of 16. By the age of 36, he was premier. He had a successful career as a farmer, businessman, and politician, both provincially and federally.

A Liberal, Dunning led his government in one general election, in 1925, winning a majority government. He was the third of six Liberal premiers to date. He resigned as Premier in 1926 to enter federal politics and was succeeded by James Gardiner. He served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King.

After leaving politics, Dunning served for many years as the Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston.

==Early life==

Known throughout his life as &quot;Charlie&quot;, Dunning was born in Croft, Leicestershire, England. As a teenager, he originally worked in an iron foundry in England, but in 1902, at age 16, he followed a friend&#x27;s advice and travelled to Canada to work as a farm hand.

Penniless when he arrived, within a year Dunning filed for his own homestead under the &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; in the Beaver Dale district, west of Yorkton. Satisfied that a permanent move to Canada made sense, he convinced the remainder of his family to come to Saskatchewan, operating a farm in partnership with his father. He eventually married Ada Rowlatt from Saskatchewan, with whom he had two children.

==Business career in Saskatchewan==
During his career as a farmer, Dunning was involved in the local of the Saskatchewan Grain Growers&#x27; Association, an early proponent of a farmer-owned cooperative grain marketing system. In 1910, he attended the general meeting of the Association. Dunning&#x27;s enthusiasm was apparent, and he was promptly elected as a director. The following year, he was elected as vice-president of the Association.

In 1919, Dunning prepared a report on the gain elevator system, which led to the incorporation of the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company by the Saskatchewan government. The SCEC was a farmers&#x27; cooperative, financed in part by shares purchased by farmers at $7.50 per share, and in part by a loan guarantee from the provincial government. A co-operative marketing system required physical assets. Dunning was appointed a provisional director of a board that had only a few months to raise the necessary capital to build a line of rural grain elevators. At age 25, the youngest man on the board, Dunning watched as each one of his seniors turned down the critical job of organizing the capital campaign. Dunning took the job and succeeded. The following year, in 1911, he was rewarded for his efforts by being named the first general manager of the company. Four years later, it was the largest grain handling company in the world. Under Dunning&#x27;s management, the SCEC had built 230 elevators and had handled over 28 million bushels of grains.

As manager, Dunning was instrumental in developing a provincial hail insurance scheme, which survives today as Saskatchewan Municipal Hail Insurance. He also sat on two royal commissions, the Grain Market Commission and the Agricultural Credit Commission. He became a wealthy man, with a reputation for integrity.

==Provincial politics: 1916 – 1926==
===MLA and Cabinet Minister: 1916 – 1922===
Dunning&#x27;s interests turned to politics. The Liberal government of Walter Scott, Saskatchewan&#x27;s first premier, was tainted with allegations of corruption. Scott resigned, and an outsider to provincial politics, William Melville Martin, succeeded him as Liberal leader and premier, with a mandate to clean up the government. Martin recruited Dunning to the new Liberal government. In October 1916, Martin brought Dunning into Cabinet, appointing him as Provincial Treasurer. Dunning then stood for election to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in a by-election held in the Kinistino constituency in November 1916. Unopposed, he was acclaimed a Member of the Legislative Assembly. Dunning held the position of Provincial Treasurer continuously for his ten years as an MLA.

Traditional politics were being challenged, as farmer movements had become politically active, creating new political parties throughout Canada. Dunning&#x27;s political astuteness, and his strong background in farmer organisations, were significant factors in the Saskatchewan Liberal Party retaining power. During his time in provincial politics, Dunning persuaded the farmer&#x27;s movement in Saskatchewan to support the provincial Liberals, and eventually the federal Liberal party as well, at a time when farmers elsewhere switched their support to the Progressive Party of Canada and the United Farmers.

In the general election of 1917, Dunning won a contested race for the seat of Moose Jaw County by obtaining twice the votes of his opponent. He remained the member for Moose Jaw County for the remainder of his time in provincial politics. Dunning ran unopposed in the general election of 1921, and won a contested race in the general election of 1925 by a 2.5 to 1 margin.

Between 1916 and 1922, Dunning held a series of Cabinet posts. In addition to his ten years as Provincial Treasurer, he also was appointed Provincial Secretary, Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Municipal Affairs, Minister of Railways, and Minister of Telephones.

===Premier of Saskatchewan: 1922 – 1926===

The continued political tensions between the federal Liberal Party and the farmer-influenced Progressives led to Dunning becoming Premier of Saskatchewan in 1922, at age 36.
The federal Liberals were increasingly unpopular in Saskatchewan, which contributed to the rise of the Progressives. The provincial Liberals continued to advance their position as a farmers&#x27; party, to the point that in 1921, Premier Martin severed the organizational ties between the Saskatchewan Liberal Party and the federal Liberal Party. He also recruited another popular farm leader, John Archibald Maharg. Like Dunning, Maharg had ties to the farmer co-operative movement, being the president of the Saskatchewan Grain Growers Association and the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company. Maharg agreed to support the Martin government, although he stood for election as an independent member, not as a Liberal. By maintaining a close connection to the farmers with the support of Dunning and Maharg, the Martin government was re-elected in the 1921 provincial election with a substantial majority, although some Progressive candidates were also elected, forming the official opposition. Martin kept Dunning as Provincial Treasurer, and appointed Maharg as Minister of Agriculture.
The situation changed with the federal election late in 1921. The federal Progressives continued to oppose the unpopular federal Liberals. Premier Martin intervened in the election at the local level in Saskatchewan, campaigning for Liberal candidates, including the Liberal candidate in Regina. His support for the federal Liberals angered the Saskatchewan Grain Growers Association, who began to discuss the possibility of establishing a separate farmer party. Maharg accused Martin of acting in bad faith, and resigned from Cabinet. He crossed the floor and eventually became the leader of the opposition.

The contretemps between Martin and Maharg had the potential to split the provincial Liberal party. A few months after the federal election, Martin resigned as premier and as leader of the Liberal party. The Liberals chose Dunning as the new party leader, and he then became premier of Saskatchewan. His immediate task as premier was to repair relations with the farm movement. He met with representatives of the Saskatchewan Grain Growers Association, to reassure them that he still supported the farm movement, rather than the Liberal government in Ottawa, and that the provincial Liberals were in fact a farmer party. He also requested copies of resolutions from the SGGA annual convention, presumably to assist in setting government policy. Dunning&#x27;s overtures were successful, and the SSGA pulled back from suggestions that they should use their organisational strength to establish a separate farmer party.

Dunning further established the position of the Liberal government in a series of by-elections, most of which resulted in Liberal candidates being elected. By the time of the next general election in 1925, Dunning had healed the rift with the farmers. The Liberals were re-elected with a substantial majority, and the Progressives were unable to build on their previous success in the 1922 election.

The main issue the Dunning government faced was the falling price of wheat, which resulted from a post-war depression. His government supported the re-establishment of the Canadian Wheat Board by the federal government. The Dunning government ended prohibition after a 1924 plebiscite, but sought to continue regulation through government-owned and operated liquor stores.
Dunning also supported efforts towards voluntary pooling of farm products, and the nascent Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. His last major policy step as premier was to arrange for the enactment of legislation to authorise the sale of the Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator Company to the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, over the objections of Maharg, who was still on the board of the SCEC. The Wheat Pool bought the SCEC for $11 million. (The equivalent in 2021 would be $166.91 million.) Farmers who bought shares in the SCEC for $7.50 in 1911 when Dunning was general manager would receive $155.84 per share in 1926.

==Federal politics: 1926 – 1930==

=== Potential Liberal leader ===
Western farmers had traditionally been a source of support for the federal Liberals, but in the 1921 federal election many farmers had instead supported the Progressive party. The new leader of the federal Liberals, William Lyon Mackenzie King, had managed to defeat the Conservatives led by Prime Minister Arthur Meighen, but only won a minority government. King was able to stay in power only by support from the Progressives. King was determined to rebuild the Liberals&#x27; farm support, particularly in western Canada.

In an effort to win back farmers, Mackenzie King began to court Dunning with his strong farm roots, encouraging him to enter federal politics. Campaigning in Saskatchewan at one point, with Dunning also on the speakers&#x27; platform, King spontaneously stated to the audience that he would like to see Dunning in the federal Cabinet. In 1926, Dunning accepted the invitation. Resigning as premier and leaving provincial politics, he was elected to the federal riding of Regina by acclamation in a by-election held in March, 1926, as a member of the federal Liberals.

Even though King brought Dunning to Ottawa, there was a risk for King, namely that Dunning could displace King as the leader of the Liberals. In the 1925 election, the Liberals had actually come in second in seats in the House of Commons, behind the Conservatives, and only held onto power through another minority government with Progressive support. King had also been personally defeated in his own riding in Ontario. He was only able to re-enter the Commons when the Liberal member for Prince Albert, Saskatchewan resigned his seat. King was elected in the Prince Albert by-election. King was able to stay in office as prime minister, but his position as party leader was not strong.

In light of the 1925 election results and King&#x27;s personal defeat, some of the power brokers in the Liberal party began to consider whether Dunning would make a better leader than King. Quiet behind-the-scenes preparations started to be made, in case King stumbled badly and it was necessary to install Dunning as leader.

By June, 1926, King was no longer able to govern. His minority government, elected only half a year earlier in the 1925 election, depended on support from the Progressives, but a political scandal in the Customs department triggered the withdrawal of Progressive support. Dunning, now in the House of Commons, vigorously defended the Liberal government, providing strong support for King, but knowing that King&#x27;s defeat might well make him Liberal leader. Facing a vote of censure in the Commons which, if passed, would likely bring down his government, on June 28, 1926, King requested that the Governor General, Viscount Byng of Vimy, dissolve Parliament and call a general election. Byng refused, relying on the reserve power invested in him by the Imperial government. King immediately resigned, and Byng called on Meighen, now the Leader of the Opposition, to form a government.

The Liberals and Dunning were now in opposition. King&#x27;s status as party leader was even more in doubt. The movement among leading Liberals to draft Dunning as a replacement as party leader grew stronger, now almost out in the open.

However, the party standings in the House of Commons were so close that Meighen was unable to put together a stable government. Appointed as prime minister on June 28, 1926, Meighen lost a vote of confidence in the Commons by one vote only a few days later, at 2 a.m. on July 2, 1926. Meighen in turn requested that the Governor General dissolve Parliament. This time Byng granted the dissolution, with the general election set for September.
King campaigned on the basis that Byng&#x27;s refusal to grant him a dissolution, and then in turn granting a dissolution to his political opponent, was unwarranted Imperial interference in Canadian affairs. The controversy, known as the King-Byng Affair, was a winning platform for King and the Liberals. They were returned to power, although still with a minority government.

Doubts about King&#x27;s status as party leader ended. Dunning was re-elected to his Regina seat by 900 votes and King again appointed him to Cabinet, no longer viewing him as a threat.

=== Minister of Railways and Canals: 1926 – 1929 ===

When Dunning had been elected to the House of Commons in March 1926, King had immediately appointed him to the powerful position of Minister of Railways and Canals in the federal Cabinet. King re-appointed him to the same portfolio after the Liberals were returned to office in September, 1926. The position was one of particular importance to western farmers, who were dependent on the national railway system to get their products to markets.

During his time as Minister of Railways and Canals, Dunning established himself as a friend of the Western farmer. Decisions made during Dunning&#x27;s tenure included his accession to a petition from area farmers to have the Canadian National Railways build a branch line through his old home of Beaver Dale to Parkerview, Saskatchewan. He also settled a longstanding debate by choosing Churchill, Manitoba as the terminus of the Hudson Bay Railway. Upon completion of the railway and port facilities in 1931, Churchill became the closest Canadian port to Liverpool. The shipping route to Churchill was 1,600 kilometres shorter than the overland route to Montreal. Dunning was also a staunch supporter of Sir Henry Thornton, the U.S.-born Englishman who, in 1922 had taken over the presidency of the Canadian National Railways.

===Minister of Finance: 1929 – 1930===

In 1929, when Dunning was still a relatively young man at age 44, King appointed him the federal Minister of Finance. As in his previous portfolio, Dunning earned a reputation for hard work and fairness. It was said that it was typical of Dunning that, although feeling ill, he remained on his feet throughout the reading and passage of his first set of estimates as Minister of Finance. As soon as the estimates were passed, Dunning collapsed and was rushed to the hospital to be treated for appendicitis.

Dunning was not only interested in domestic politics. He was also keenly interested in international politics, and particularly, in Canada&#x27;s relationship with his &quot;old country&quot;, the United Kingdom. Dunning participated in Canada&#x27;s delegation to the League of Nations.

In 1930, when the United States proposed the draconian Smoot-Hawley tariff, Canada&#x27;s response was the Dunning tariff with increased duties and further tariff preference for the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries. The opposition Conservatives criticised the tariff on the basis that the imperial preference was prejudicial to Canadian interests.

===Defeat in the 1930 election===
Canadians went to the polls in the general election of July, 1930, at the beginning of the Great Depression. The Conservatives under their new leader, Richard Bennett, defeated King and the Liberals, winning a majority government. Although Bennett had opposed the Dunning tariff while in opposition, the Conservatives maintained the tariff, which stayed in effect until renegotiated in the late 1930s.

Dunning lost his Regina seat by over 3,500 votes (obtaining only two-thirds of the winner&#x27;s total). Safe Liberal seats were offered to Dunning, but he turned them down, thinking that a business career would protect his family&#x27;s financial future. He restarted his business career reorganizing an under-performing subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway, thereafter establishing a reputation as a brilliant re-organizer of insolvent companies.

=== Minister of Finance: 1935 – 1939 ===

King and the Liberals regained power in the 1935 general election. Now firmly in control of the Liberal party and the government, he immediately went to Dunning, pressing him to re-enter politics. King convinced Dunning that he was needed in the tough economic times created by the Great Depression. A sitting Member of Parliament was persuaded to step aside, and Dunning was yet again acclaimed, in a 1936 by-election held in the constituency of Queen&#x27;s in Prince Edward Island. Dunning returned to the Finance portfolio. This time, one of Dunning&#x27;s legacies was the establishment of the Central Mortgage Bank, the predecessor to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

Dunning was still sometimes mentioned as a possible successor to King, but in 1938, Dunning had a heart attack. Unable to carry on the stress of his Cabinet position, and locked in a perpetual conflict with the other Saskatchewan minister in the Cabinet, Jimmy Gardiner, in 1939 Dunning retired from politics.

== Second business career: 1940 – 1958 ==

In ill health, Dunning relocated to Montreal. In 1940, he was appointed as president and CEO of Ogilvie Flour Mills, a position he held until 1947, when he was appointed chairman of the board. In addition to his duties with Ogilvie, Dunning continued his business of corporate reorganization. He sat on a number of prestigious corporate and bank boards, including that of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

During World War II, Dunning was chair of the National War Loans Committee, raising money for the war effort. He was also chair of Allied Supplies Limited, a company created by the federal government to co-ordinate the production of munitions and explosives.

== Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston ==

In 1940, Dunning was awarded an honorary doctorate by Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston, and was appointed chancellor of the university. Although Dunning was not himself a wealthy man, his contacts in the business world enabled him to raise considerable funds for Queen&#x27;s. One story is that during a meeting a of the CPR Board, Dunning passed a note to Colonel Robert Samuel McLaughlin, a wealthy member of the Board, saying that Queen&#x27;s needed a new engineering building. The note came back with an invitation to talk after the meeting. A new engineering building at Queen&#x27;s was the result. Dunning also used his financial expertise for general fund-raising campaigns. With his knowledge of federal tax law, he was able to find a new way for companies to make donations and take considerable tax benefits, resulting in substantial donations to Queen&#x27;s.

Dunning&#x27;s abilities earned him the gratitude of the university, which named Dunning Hall in his honour. The Chancellor Dunning Trust Lectureship was established by an anonymous donor, to &quot;promote the understanding and appreciation of the supreme importance of the dignity, freedom, and responsibility of the individual person in human society&quot;. More recently, the university has established the Stauffer-Dunning Chair in Public Policy.

== Death ==
Dunning died in 1958, aged 74, following kidney surgery. He is buried in Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal.

== Honours ==

In 1985, Dunning was designated as a National Historic Person by the federal government&#x27;s heritage registry.

In 2005, as part of Saskatchewan&#x27;s centennial celebration, Dunning&#x27;s memory was commemorated in two ways. First, the Provincial Revenue Building was renamed Dunning Place, recognising Dunning&#x27;s long tenure as Provincial Treasurer. The Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator Company also had its offices in the building when Dunning was general manager.

Second, on the initiative of Saskatchewan&#x27;s Lieutenant-Governor, Dr. Gordon Barnhart, Dunning&#x27;s gravesite in Montreal&#x27;s Mount Royal Cemetery was commemorated by a bronze plaque, recognizing Dunning&#x27;s contribution to the people of Saskatchewan.
Dunning Hall at Queen&#x27;s University is named after Dunning. Queen&#x27;s School of Business occupied Dunning Hall for many years. Since 2002, it has housed the Department of Economics.

In addition to his honorary degree from Queen&#x27;s, Dunning also received honorary doctorates from McGill University in 1939 and the University of Saskatchewan in 1946.

Dunning Crescent in Regina is named after Dunning.

<doc id="520803" wikidata="Q5445542" url="?curid=520803" title="Ferrymead">
<text>Ferrymead is a suburb south-east of Christchurch, New Zealand. It is the main thoroughfare for reaching the eastern sea suburbs such as Sumner, as well as home to a number of cliff-top residences and businesses along the estuary front. After the 2011 Canterbury earthquake, a number of prominent Christchurch businesses relocated to the Ferrymead area, making it into a secondary business hub.

==Geography==
Ferrymead is located on the Avon Heathcote Estuary / Ihutai, close to the point where the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River drains into the estuary, and west of the eventual outflow into Pegasus Bay. To the north lie the oxidation ponds from Christchurch&#x27;s main sewage treatment works, which are within a large wildlife refuge and are inhabited by many species of bird life. To the south lie the Port Hills. The suburb is named for the ferry that operated across the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River during the early period of settlement. After the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, a number of businesses have relocated to the suburb, making it a small hub and helping other shops and cafes grow.

==History==
===Māori settlement===
Ohika-paruparu is the Māori name for the nearby mud flats. It is a combination of &#x27;Ohika&#x27; which means &#x27;fall&#x27; and &#x27;paruparu&#x27; which means a muddy place. Māori speared eels and pātiki on the flat and the women gathered shellfish here.

===Early European settlement===

European settlement of the area dates from the arrival of the early colonists in 1850. Farming was the major industry of the area from its early years and parts of the Heathcote Valley are still in agricultural production. Ferry services began about 1851 firstly as a cattle punt. James Townsend (1788–1866) operated the punt service from 1852. When he sold up, the new owners called his house Ferry Mead Hotel (the meadow of the ferry) and this gave the name to the suburb. These ferry services continued until the completion of the Heathcote Bridge in 1864. Shipping at this time was also able to travel up the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River as far as the Christchurch Quay adjacent to the present Radley Street Bridge. Later the Steam Wharf was opened by the present Tunnel Road intersection with Ferry Road. The Railway Wharf was opened in December 1863 along with the Ferrymead Railway.

Shipping on the river was very costly, around 2 pounds per tonne, more than it cost to bring cargo from the UK, and the ships were very small. Later on, steamships brought the cost down, but the difficulties of bringing ships over the bar of the Estuary and up the river itself were a considerable inconvenience. River shipping only outlasted the advent of the railway by a few years, although both the 1864 and 1907 bridges were designed to allow shipping to pass.

===The original railway===

On 1 December 1863 New Zealand&#x27;s first public railway line was opened from Ferrymead to the central city.

The line was a temporary expedient to allow construction of the Heathcote/Lyttelton tunnel to proceed. It closed in 1867 after the opening of the Moorhouse railway tunnel to the port of Lyttelton.

Its track ran 7 km to the city of Christchurch, where the station was situated near to the site later occupied by the 1960 Christchurch station (closed in 1995). The locomotives and rolling stock were imported from Victoria, Australia, this being the main reason why the 5&#x27; 3&quot; (1600 mm) railway gauge was adopted. Stations were located in later years at Woolston (formerly Hillsborough), Opawa and Linwood (the last two as passenger halts until the end of suburban trains in 1972). A branch also headed towards Heathcote at the time of tunnel construction.

The Moorhouse Tunnel was completed in a much shorter time than envisaged; and consequently the Ferrymead Railway was officially closed on 9 November 1867, the same day as the railway line to Lyttelton was opened. Following the subsequent conversion of the Main South Line to 3&#x27; 6&quot; (1067 mm) gauge, all its broad gauge rolling stock was sold back to Australia. The ship they were placed on was wrecked off the New Zealand coast, but the cargo was salvaged. The rolling stock then lay abandoned for almost 100 years until the advent of Ferrymead Historic Park.

Following the commemoration of the centenary of this line, various groups including the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society (Canterbury Branch) (now the Canterbury Railway Society) became interested in developing the historical site. The Ferrymead Railway operates on the original railway formation as part of Ferrymead Heritage Park (formerly Ferrymead Historic Park).

<text>The National Park Bank was founded in 1856 in New York City, and by the late 19th century, it did more commercial business than any other bank in the country.

==History==
The bank built a significant Second Empire early skyscraper at 214-18 Broadway – opposite St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel – designed by New York architect Griffith Thomas and finished in 1868.

===1905 building===
Architect Donn Barber greatly expanded the 1868 building, 1903–1905, altering its Broadway façade beyond recognition. The bank had bought the plot of land directly behind its building, 165 x 75 feet, fronting on Ann Street to the north and Fulton Street to the south. This was intended as the site for a future skyscraper but instead was used for a new banking room with a vault designed by Frederick S. Holmes. Barber designed a T-shaped Beaux-Arts building with a large arched window on each of the three street facades. The bar of the &quot;T&quot; was built first, two tall coffered barrel vaults flanking a stained-glass dome. Banking business moved into this space in 1904, while the lower three stories of the 1868 building (the stem of the &quot;T&quot;) were gutted to create a grand entrance hall. The height of the new banking room from the marble floor to the top of the stained-glass dome was 68 feet (20.7 m). Artist Albert Herter painted the large lunette murals of &quot;Agriculture&quot;, &quot;Industry&quot;, and &quot;Commerce&quot; for the entrance hall and banking room.

The building was demolished in 1961.

===Business===
In 1911, the bank acquired the Wells Fargo Company.

John Hamilton Fulton was president in 1927.

It was consolidated with Chase National Bank in 1929.

<text>The following is a list of major rapids and other notable features on the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] through Marble Canyon and Grand Canyon below Glen Canyon Dam, in order of their position downstream of Lee&#x27;s Ferry. Ratings are given for how difficult the rapid is to navigate by whitewater raft or other water craft. The Grand Canyon section of the Colorado River, like several other big-water Western rivers, uses a rapids scale developed by Otis R. Marston of 1–10 for rapids, 10 being the most difficult. The International Scale of River Difficulty, which classifies rapids from class I to VI, is more common elsewhere in the US and internationally.
* Mile 0.0 – Lee&#x27;s Ferry

With the appearance of Pearce Ferry Rapid, this take-out has become preferred, as the rapid just below is often considered unrunnable, though this is always changing.
* Mile 280.8 – Pearce Ferry Rapid (unrunnable; class VI on the International Scale of River Difficulty) This rapid was created in 2007 when the level of Lake Mead went below 1138 feet. Lake Mead was over 70 feet deep here in 2000. This rapid is formed by the Colorado River running full force into a hillside. It is a must-scout for any river runners continuing to the next take-out on Lake Mead at South Cove. It is currently considered to be unrunnable.
* Mile 297 – South Cove Take-Out (in Lake Mead)

<text>William Melville Martin (August 23, 1876 – June 22, 1970) served as the second premier of Saskatchewan from 1916 to 1922. In 1916, although not a member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, Martin was elected leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party, succeeding Premier Walter Scott and thus became Premier of Saskatchewan.

Prior to entering provincial politics, Martin had been a member of the federal Parliament for two terms, as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada.

On his retirement from politics, he was appointed to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, serving first as a puisne justice and then as Chief Justice of Saskatchewan.

== Early life ==

Martin was born in Norwich, Ontario. In 1898, he earned an honours degree in Classics from the University of Toronto, and then a Teacher Certificate from the Ontario School of Pedagogy. After teaching for two years, he attended Osgoode Hall Law School and qualified as a lawyer.

In 1903, he moved to Regina and joined the law firm of his cousin, James Balfour. The Balfour and Martin families had been active in Liberal politics in Ontario, and the Balfour law firm was similarly active in Liberal politics in Saskatchewan.

In 1905, Martin married Violette Florence Thompson of Mitchell, Ontario. The couple had three sons.

==Member of Parliament==

Martin was elected to the House of Commons for Regina in the 1908 Canadian federal election. As a Liberal, he supported the government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He was a strong representative for western interests, including expansion of railway infrastructure, regulation of freight rates, incorporation of grain grower associations, and other farmer interests. He also commented on law reform issues and matters related to the North-West Mounted Police.

He was re-elected in the 1911 Canadian federal election, as a strong supporter of the Liberal platform for &quot;Unrestricted Reciprocity&quot; (free trade) with the United States. However, the Liberal government was defeated by the Conservative Party under Robert Borden, largely on the reciprocity issue.

==Premier of Saskatchewan==
The Saskatchewan Liberal Party had held office under Premier Walter Scott since Saskatchewan had joined Confederation in 1905. By 1916, the Liberal government was facing allegations of corruption and Premier Scott was having mental health problems. The government was also involved in a bitter dispute over funding for separate schools. Martin, as an outsider to provincial politics, was recruited by the provincial Liberals to help distance them from allegations of corruption and to respond to the school funding issue. In 1916, he was elected as leader of the provincial party, becoming premier. He resigned his seat in the House of Commons and was then acclaimed in a by-election to the Legislative Assembly, in a seat vacated by a Liberal member. Although Martin became premier in 1916, he did not become President of the Executive Council of Saskatchewan until 1917, the only premier who was not President of the Executive Council throughout his term as premier.

To deal with the school issue, Martin himself took the education portfolio. He was the Minister of Education for most of his time as premier. He was also the Minister of Railways and the Minister of Telephones and Telegraphs, reflecting the importance of infrastructure developments in the young province.
Martin brought farmers&#x27; advocate Charles A. Dunning into the cabinet in an attempt to revitalise the Liberals and maintain support from farmers, appointing him to the important position of Provincial Treasurer, a position Dunning was to hold for almost ten years. Dunning had been an active member of the Saskatchewan Grain Growers Association, and the general manager of the highly successful Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company. Martin also instituted reforms to clean up the government. These changes were successful in cleansing the government&#x27;s image, and Martin led the government to re-election in the 1917 election, winning 51 of 59 seats.

That same year, there was a federal election which was fought largely on the issue of conscription to raise troops for the Canadian army fighting in France. Many federal Liberals joined in a coalition with the federal Conservatives to form a Union government. Martin supported those Liberals who joined the Union government.

The United Farmers and Progressive movements were riding a national wave of agrarian discontent which undercut the Liberals across Canada, and threatened to engulf the Saskatchewan Liberals as well. Martin successfully embraced the populist movement. In addition to bringing in Dunning in 1916, by 1920 he severed ties with the federal Liberal Party of Canada. He also recruited another farm leader into the government, federal Progressive MP John Archibald Maharg. Like Dunning, Maharg had strong roots in the farm co-operative community. He was the president of both the Saskatchewan Grain Growers Association and the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company. Maharg agreed to support the government, but as an independent member, not as a Liberal. With these strong farm representatives supporting his government, Martin and the Liberals kept farm support and were able to resist the Progressive challenge in the 1921 election. The Martin government was returned to power, although with a reduced majority of 46 Liberals in the 63 seat Assembly. Martin kept Dunning on as Provincial Treasurer and appointed Maharg as Minister of Agriculture, a key position in a province with a farm-based economy.
A political crisis developed, however, during the federal election of late 1921. The federal Progressives continued to oppose the federal Liberals. Premier Martin participated in the federal election at the local level, campaigning for the federal Liberals, particularly the Liberal candidate in Regina, Martin&#x27;s old seat. Martin also stated that he could not personally support a number of the Progressives&#x27; policy proposals. Martin&#x27;s support for the federal Liberals angered the Saskatchewan Grain Growers Association, which began to explore the possibility of forming a new farmer-based party. Maharg accused Martin of acting in bad faith and resigned from Cabinet. He crossed the floor and eventually became the Leader of the Opposition.

Maharg&#x27;s resignation, the threat that the Grain Growers would start a farmer party, and the issue of supporting the federal Liberals, all led to a political crisis within the provincial Liberal party. Martin lost support and eventually resigned in 1922, at the age of 46. He was replaced as party leader and as premier by Charles Dunning.

==Judicial career ==

Martin retired from politics in 1922 and was appointed a judge of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. In 1941 he was appointed Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, a post he held until his retirement in 1961 at the age of 84.

While on the Court of Appeal, he also served as a commissioner on the Royal Commission on Reconveyance of Land to British Columbia, which contributed to the re-transfer of the Railway Belt and Peace River Block from the federal government to the province of British Columbia.

==Legacy==
Martin Collegiate, a high school in Regina, is named in his honour.

== Electoral record ==

Martin ranks tenth out of the fifteen premiers of Saskatchewan for time in office. He served one continuous term, from October 20, 1916, to April 5, 1922, and was in office for . He was elected three times to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. Prior to entering provincial politics, Martin was elected twice to the federal House of Commons, serving for . His total electoral service, federal and provincial, was .

Martin led the Saskatchewan Liberals in two general elections, winning both. He stood for election at the constituency level five times, three times provincially and twice federally. He was acclaimed once and elected four times in contested elections. He was never defeated at the polls.

=== Saskatchewan general elections, 1917 and 1921===

Martin led the Liberal Party in two general elections, winning a majority government both times (1917 and 1921).

==== 1917 General election ====


Half a year after becoming Premier, Martin led the Liberals in the general election of 1917. In spite of the corruption allegations which had dogged the Liberals, he managed to win a majority government, defeating the Conservatives led by Wellington Willoughby, as well as candidates of third parties, none of whom won a seat. One independent candidate was elected.

1 Premier when election was called; Premier after the election.
2 Leader of the Opposition when the election was called; Leader of the Opposition after the election.
3After the general election was held, there were special elections amongst Saskatchewanians serving overseas in the Great War. Three additional members were elected: one from Saskatchewanians serving in Great Britain, one from Saskatchewanians serving in France, and one from Saskatchewanians serving in Belgium, for a total of 62 members in the 4th Legislative Assembly.

==== 1921 General election ====


In 1921, Martin led the Liberals into a second general election and again won a majority government, albeit with a smaller share of the popular vote and a reduction in the number of seats in the Assembly. The political opponents of the government fractured badly, leading to Saskatchewan&#x27;s first major multi-party election. The Conservative Party entered the election without a formal leader, as the previous leader, Donald Maclean, had accepted a federal judicial appointment just two months before the election.

1 Premier when election was called; Premier after the election.

=== Saskatchewan constituency elections, 1916 to 1921 ===

Martin stood for election to the Legislative Assembly three times, once in a by-election and in two general elections, all in the riding of Regina City. He was acclaimed in the by-election, and won the next two elections, which were contested.

==== 1916 By-election: Regina City ====

The by-election was called on the resignation of the sitting Liberal member, James Franklin Bole, to allow Premier Martin to win a seat in the Assembly.

E Elected.

==== 1917 General election: Regina City ====

E Elected. 
X Incumbent.

==== 1921 General election: Regina City ====

E Elected. The constituency returned two members at that time.
X Incumbents. Cross and Bagshaw had both been soldier-members of the Legislative Assembly from 1917 to 1921. Cross was elected by Canadian soldiers in Great Britain, while Bagshaw was elected by Canadian soldiers in Belgium. Since they were both members at large they are listed as incumbents, although neither had held the Regina seat prior to the 1921 election.

=== Federal constituency elections, 1908 and 1911 ===

Martin stood for election to the House of Commons twice, in the riding of Regina, Saskatchewan. He was elected both times.

<doc id="520819" wikidata="Q1254964" url="?curid=520819" title="Horse Guards Parade">
<text>Horse Guards Parade is a large parade ground off Whitehall in central London (at grid reference ). It is the site of the annual ceremonies of Trooping the Colour, which commemorates the monarch&#x27;s official birthday, and the Beating Retreat.

==History==

Horse Guards Parade was formerly the site of the Palace of Whitehall&#x27;s tiltyard, where tournaments (including jousting) were held in the time of Henry VIII. It was also the scene of annual celebrations of the birthday of Queen Elizabeth I. The area has been used for a variety of reviews, parades and other ceremonies since the 17th century.

The adjacent Horse Guards building was once the Headquarters of the British Army. Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington was based in Horse Guards when he was Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. The current General officer commanding London District still occupies the same office and uses the same desk. Wellington also had living quarters within the building, which today are used as offices.

===Car park usage===

For much of the late 20th century, Horse Guards Parade was used as a car park for senior civil servants; about 500 were granted the privilege, which was known as the &#x27;Great Perk&#x27;. The PIRA&#x27;s mortar attack on 10 Downing Street on 7 February 1991, which was carried out from a vehicle parked in Horse Guards Avenue nearby, narrowly missed causing casualties and led to concerns. In April 1993 the Royal Parks Review Group, headed by Dame Jennifer Jenkins (later Baroness Jenkins) recommended that the parade should be restored for public use, and linked to St James&#x27;s Park by closing Horse Guards Road. The proposal was taken up by the Department of National Heritage but then resisted by senior Cabinet members, apparently under pressure from the civil servants who were to lose their parking places.

Public revelation of the resistance led to considerable criticism by Simon Jenkins, a newspaper columnist, who pressured Sir Robin Butler, Head of the Home Civil Service, to end general usage as parking as part of a wider programme of reforms. In late 1996 Horse Guards Parade was cleared, for repairs, and in March 1997 it was announced that parking was banned.

==Layout==
The parade ground is open on the west side, where it faces Horse Guards Road and St James&#x27;s Park. It is enclosed to the north by the Admiralty Citadel and the Admiralty Extension building, to the east by Admiralty House, William Kent&#x27;s Horse Guards and the rear of Dover House (home of the Scotland Office), and to the south by Kent&#x27;s Treasury building (now used by the Cabinet Office), garden walls of 10 Downing Street (the official residence and office of the British Prime Minister) and Mountbatten Green before the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#x27;s west wing. Access to the south side is restricted for national security.

On the east side, Horse Guards Parade is normally accessible to the public from Whitehall through the arches of Horse Guards.

==Monuments==

A number of military monuments and trophies ring the outside of the parade ground, including:

* To the west, beside St James&#x27;s Park, the Guards Memorial, designed by the sculptor Gilbert Ledward in 1923–26 and erected to commemorate the First Battle of Ypres and other battles of World War I.
* To the north, the Royal Naval Division War Memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1925, removed before the Second World War, and returned to its original site beside the Admiralty Extension building and rededicated on &quot;Beaucourt Day&quot; (13 November 2003).
* To the east:
**Equestrian statues of Field Marshals Roberts and Wolseley (see Equestrian statue of the Earl Roberts, London and Equestrian statue of the Viscount Wolseley).
** A Turkish cannon made in 1524 &quot;by Murad son of Abdullah, chief gunner&quot; which was captured in Egypt in 1801.
** The Cádiz Memorial, a French mortar mounted on a brass monster which commemorates the lifting of the Siege of Cádiz in Spain in 1812.
* To the south, statues of Field Marshal Kitchener and of Admiral of the Fleet Mountbatten (see Statue of the Earl Kitchener, London and Statue of the Earl Mountbatten, London).

An oddity is the black background to the number 2 of the double sided clock which overlooks the Parade Ground and the front entrance, it is popularly thought to commemorate the time the last absolute monarch of England, Charles I, was beheaded at the Banqueting House opposite.

==Ceremonial==

===Changing The King&#x27;s Life Guard===

The ceremony of Changing The King&#x27;s Life Guard takes place every weekday at 11:00 am on Horse Guards Parade, adjacent to the Horse Guards building. Two mounted sentries guard the entrance to Horse Guards on Whitehall from 10:00 am until 4:00 pm and are changed every hour. There is a dismounted parade at 4:00 pm and two dismounted sentries remain on duty until 8:00 pm.
===Trooping the Colour===

In the early summer, grandstands are erected in Horse Guards Parade in preparation for the Trooping the Colour ceremony which is usually on the second Saturday in June and celebrates the monarch&#x27;s Official Birthday. There are two full dress rehearsals:
*The Major General&#x27;s Review, usually two weeks beforehand, when the salute is taken by the Major-General commanding the Household Division
*The Colonel&#x27;s Review, the week beforehand, when the salute is taken by the Royal colonel of whichever of the five regiments of foot guards will have their regimental colour &quot;trooped&quot;.

Around 1,400 soldiers take part in the ceremony in which the regimental colour of one of the guards regiments is &quot;trooped&quot; or marched along the assembled ranks. It concludes with the foot and horse guards marching past and saluting the monarch. The public can watch the troops enter and leave Horse Guards Parade and tickets for the seating are sold subject to a ballot.

===Beating Retreat===

On two evenings in June, this ceremony is carried out by the Bands of the Household Division. Beating Retreat is also performed at Horseguards biannually in July by the Royal Marines Band Service. Proceeds from ticket sales are donated to military charities. 

===Remembrance Sunday===
At the National Service of Remembrance, the various contingents of veterans&#x27; organisations form up on Horse Guards Parade, and after the ceremony at The Cenotaph, they return and march past a member of the Royal Family by the Guards Memorial, who takes their salute.

==Sporting and public events==
===2012 Summer Olympics===

Horse Guards Parade hosted beach volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics held in London. Temporary courts and seating designed by Populous were installed by the Arena Group, much as seating is installed annually for Trooping the Colour. There was one court with a capacity of 15,000 with two tiers and a floodlight tower at each of its four corners, two practice courts to the east of the arena, and a further six practice courts at St. James&#x27;s Park. Most matches were played on Centre Court, but some matches were played on Court 1 on day 6 of the competition.

===London Polo Championships===
Horse Guards Parade hosted the 1st London Polo Championships on 17 and 18 June 2009 with teams from around the world.

===Sainsburys Anniversary Games 2014===
On Sunday 20 July 2014, a temporary arena played host to the anniversary games.

<text>Betty Field (February 8, 1916 – September 13, 1973) was an American film and stage actress.

==Early years==
Field was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to George and Katharine (née Lynch) Field. She began acting before she reached age 15, and went into stock theater immediately after graduating from high school. She attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.

Producer/director George Abbott is credited with having discovered Field.

==Stage==
Field began her acting career in 1934 on the London stage in Howard Lindsay&#x27;s farce &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot;. Following its run, she returned to the United States, and appeared in several stage successes, then made her film debut in 1939.

Field&#x27;s Broadway credits include &quot;Page Miss Glory&quot; (1934), &quot;Room Service&quot; (1937), &quot;Angel Island&quot; (1937), &quot;If I Were You&quot; (1938), &quot;What a Life&quot; (1938), &quot;The Primrose&quot; (1939), &quot;Ring Two&quot; (1939), &quot;Two on an Island&quot; (1940), &quot;Flight to the West&quot; (1940), &quot;A New Life&quot; (1943), &quot;The Voice of the Turtle&quot; (1943), &quot;Dream Girl&quot; (1945), &quot;The Rat Race&quot; (1949), &quot;Not for Children&quot; (1951), &quot;The Fourposter&quot; (1951), &quot;The Ladies of the Corridor&quot; (1953), &quot;Festival&quot; (1955), &quot;The Waltz of the Toreadors&quot; (1958), &quot;A Touch of the Poet&quot; (1958), &quot;A Loss of Roses&quot; (1959), &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; (1963), &quot;Where&#x27;s Daddy?&quot; (1966), and &quot;All Over&quot; (1971).

Her final stage performances were in three productions at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in 1971.

==Film==
Field had to overcome obstacles early in her film career. A 1942 newspaper article reported:When Betty Field was first signed for pictures, conversation buzzed. &quot;But she&#x27;s not pretty,&quot; was the first objection. &quot;And her mouth is too large.&quot;

Field&#x27;s role as Curly&#x27;s wife, Mae, the sole female character in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1939) established her as a dramatic actress. She starred opposite John Wayne in the 1941 movie &quot;The Shepherd of the Hills&quot;. Field played a supporting, yet significant role as Cassandra Tower in &quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942). 

A life member of The Actors Studio, Field preferred performing on Broadway and appeared in Elmer Rice&#x27;s &quot;Dream Girl&quot; and Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;The Waltz of the Toreadors&quot;, but returned to Hollywood regularly, appearing in &quot;Flesh and Fantasy&quot; (1943), &quot;The Southerner&quot; (1945), as Daisy Buchanan in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1949) with Alan Ladd, &quot;Picnic&quot; (1955) with William Holden and Kim Novak, &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (1956) with Marilyn Monroe, &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1957) (for which she was nominated for a Laurel Award), &quot;Hound-Dog Man&quot; (1959) with Carol Lynley and Stuart Whitman, &quot;Butterfield 8&quot; (1960) with Elizabeth Taylor, &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962) with Burt Lancaster, &quot;7 Women&quot; (1966) with Anne Bancroft and &quot;How to Save a Marriage and Ruin Your Life&quot; (1968) with Dean Martin and Stella Stevens. Her final film role was in &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot; with Clint Eastwood and Susan Clark in 1968.

==TV and radio==
Field made many guest appearances on series television including &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot; and several others. Field portrayed Barbara Pearson on the radio series &quot;The Aldrich Family&quot;. On radio, she also appeared on &quot;Old Gold Comedy Theater&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot; and &quot;Suspense&quot;. 

==Personal life==
Her first marriage to playwright Elmer Rice ended in divorce in May 1956. The couple had three children, John, Paul, and Judith. John became a lawyer, but he died in a swimming accident at age 40. Her second marriage to Edwin J. Lukas lasted from 1957 to 1967. Her third marriage to Raymond Olivere lasted from 1968 until her death in 1973. 

Field died from a cerebral hemorrhage on September 13, 1973, at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Massachusetts, aged 57. (Another source says she was 55.)

<doc id="520837" wikidata="Q201589" url="?curid=520837" title="Queen Letizia of Spain">
<text>Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano (; born 15 September 1972) is Queen of Spain as the wife of King Felipe VI.

Letizia was born in Oviedo, Asturias. She worked as a journalist for &quot;ABC&quot; and EFE before becoming a news anchor at CNN+ and Televisión Española. In 1998, she married Alonso Guerrero Pérez; they divorced the following year. In 2004, Letizia married Felipe, then Prince of Asturias as the son and heir apparent of King Juan Carlos I. The couple have two daughters, Leonor and Sofía. As Princess of Asturias, Letizia represented her father-in-law in Spain and abroad. On Juan Carlos&#x27;s abdication in June 2014, Felipe became king, making Letizia queen consort.

As the consort of the ruling monarch, Letizia has no constitutional functions of her own and it is constitutionally prohibited for her to assume any, unless she assumes the role of regent. The Queen performs public commitments representing the Crown, often with her husband, but she is focused on being the patron, president or member of numerous charities and organizations, and she is the visible face of the Spanish international cooperation, often traveling around the world supervising and promoting it.

==Family==
Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano was born on 15 September 1972 at Miñor Sanatorium in Oviedo, Asturias, the eldest daughter of Jesús José Ortiz Álvarez, a journalist, and his first wife, María de la Paloma Rocasolano Rodríguez, a chief registered nurse and hospital union representative with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in art history. She has two younger sisters, Telma (born 1973) and Érika (1975–2007). Érika committed suicide by an intentional drug overdose while Letizia was pregnant with her second child.

Ortiz&#x27;s parents divorced in 1999 and her father remarried in Madrid on 18 March 2004 to fellow journalist Ana Togores.

Ortiz&#x27;s paternal grandparents were José Luis Ortiz Velasco (1923–2005), a commercial employee at Olivetti, and María del Carmen &quot;Menchu&quot; Álvarez del Valle (1928–2021), a radio broadcaster in Asturias for over 40 years. Her maternal grandfather was Francisco Julio Rocasolano Camacho (1918–2015), a mechanic and cab driver in Madrid for over 20 years who was of French and Occitan origin. Her maternal grandmother, Enriqueta Rodríguez Figueredo (1919–2008), was a Filipina of Spanish descent.

Several studies have been conducted to try to determine the queen&#x27;s family genealogy. British genealogists have provided evidence that through her mother&#x27;s Rocasolano lineage, Ortiz descends from Astorg Roquesoulane, a 16th-century woman who died in 1564, and her coat of arms incorporates the arms of the Rocasolano family. A French genealogist found evidence that through her mother&#x27;s Rocasolano lineage, Ortiz is a 9th cousin of French singer and actress Anny Flore. Other reports have suggested, and remain unproven, that on her paternal grandfather&#x27;s side, she is a descendant of an untitled family descended from medieval nobility who served as constables of Castile.

==Education and career==
Ortiz attended La Gesta School in Oviedo, before her family moved to Rivas-Vaciamadrid near Madrid, where she attended the Ramiro de Maeztu High School. She completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism, at the Complutense University of Madrid, as well as a master&#x27;s degree in audiovisual journalism at the Institute for Studies in Audiovisual Journalism.

During her studies, Ortiz worked for the Asturian daily newspaper &quot;La Nueva España&quot; and later for the newspaper &quot;ABC&quot; and the national news agency EFE. After completing her master&#x27;s degree, she travelled to Guadalajara, Mexico, where she worked at the newspaper &quot;Siglo 21&quot; and began work toward a PhD. She did not, however, complete her doctoral thesis because she returned to Spain. After returning to Spain, she worked for the Spanish version of the economic channel Bloomberg before moving to the news network CNN+.

In 2000, Ortiz moved to TVE, where she started working for the news channel 24 Horas. In 2002, she anchored the weekly news report programme &quot;Informe Semanal&quot; and later the daily morning news programme &quot;Telediario Matinal&quot; on TVE 1. In August 2003, a few months before her engagement to Felipe, Prince of Asturias, Ortiz was promoted to anchor of the TVE daily evening news programme &quot;Telediario 2&quot;, the most viewed newscast in Spain.
In 2000, she reported from Washington, D.C., on the presidential elections. In September 2001, she broadcast live from Ground Zero following the 9/11 attacks in New York and in 2003, she filed reports from Iraq following the war. In 2002 she sent several reports from Galicia in northern Spain following the ecological disaster when the oil tanker &quot;Prestige&quot; sank.

==Marriages and children==
===First marriage===
In the late 1980s, Letizia met Alonso Guerrero Pérez (b. 1962), a school teacher —10 years older than her— who taught Spanish language and literature at the Ramiro de Maeztu Institute of Madrid, where she studied. After a 10-year courtship, on 7 August 1998 the couple married in a civil ceremony at the City Council of Almendralejo (Badajoz), municipality of origin of Guerrero. Letizia was 26 years old and Alonso 36. 90 guests attended the ceremony. The marriage ended by divorce in 1999. After the divorce, Letizia moved to a small apartment located in the Madrid district of Vicálvaro, which she later gave to her sister Erika and where she lived until her death in 2007.

===Second marriage and children===
On 1 November 2003, to the surprise of many, the Royal Household announced Ortiz&#x27;s engagement to Prince Felipe. Afterwards, she moved to live in a wing of the Zarzuela Palace until the day of her wedding. The Prince of Asturias had proposed to her with a 16-baguette diamond engagement ring with a white gold trim. She marked the occasion by giving him white gold and sapphire cufflinks and a classic book.

The wedding took place on 22 May 2004 in the Almudena Cathedral in Madrid. It was the first royal wedding in this cathedral. It had been nearly a century since the capital celebrated a royal wedding, as the prince&#x27;s parents married in Athens and his sisters, Infanta Elena and Infanta Cristina, married in Seville and Barcelona respectively. Letizia&#x27;s bridal gown was designed by Spanish fashion designer Manuel Pertegaz, her bridal shoes by Pura López; and the veil, a gift from Felipe to his bride, was made of off-white silk tulle and hand-embroidered with detailing. As Letizia&#x27;s previous marriage involved only a civil ceremony, the Catholic Church does not consider it canonically valid and therefore did not require an annulment to proceed with a Catholic marriage to the Prince of Asturias.

Letizia and Felipe have two daughters: Leonor, Princess of Asturias, born on 31 October 2005, and Infanta Sofía, born on 29 April 2007. They were born in the Ruber International Hospital in Madrid.

==Princess of Asturias==
After becoming Princess of Asturias, Letizia automatically joined the royal family and moved her residence to the Prince&#x27;s Pavilion (), Felipe&#x27;s private residence, near to the Zarzuela Palace (the private and work residence of the royal family).Although Letizia attended some specific events of the royal family before the wedding (such as the state funeral for the 2004 Madrid train bombings victims or the wedding of Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, and Mary Donaldson), she immediately joined in the duties of her husband representing her father-in-law. Five days after her wedding, Letizia traveled with Queen Sofia, Prince Felipe and Infanta Cristina to the wedding of Jordan&#x27;s Crown Prince Hamzah bin Hussein and Princess Noor bint Asem, whick took place at the Zahran Palace. That same year, Letizia accompanied her husband on several national activities but also in international trips such us the official visits to México in July, Hungary in September, the United States in October, and Serbia in December, as well as receiving the president of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, and her wife, Livia Klausová, in Madrid.

In 2005, Letizia accompanied her husband to Brazil and Uruguay, both in February. They also travelled to Stockholm (Sweden) in April, to inaugurate a new office of the Cervantes Institute, and to Japan in June, where they met the Japanese Imperial Family and to visit the Expo 2005. Following the birth of Infanta Leonor at the end of 2005, the princess&#x27;s agenda was reduced, although during the following year, in addition to her national commitments, she accompanied her husband on official trips to Portugal and China. The second pregnancy, this time of Infanta Sofía, also prevented her from attending some activities but, in October 2006, the Royal Household announced that the Princess of Asturias would have her own official agenda, which would be compatible with that of her husband. Her first solo act as princess was the inauguration of a public school in Pozuelo de Alarcón (Madrid) on 9 October 2006. Since then, Letizia performed regular audiences and visits focused on social issues such as children&#x27;s rights, rare diseases, culture, and education. In this sense, in September 2010, the Spanish Association Against Cancer (AECC) appointed her as honorary president of the Association and its scientific foundation.

For all this, in late 2007 her solo agenda started to grow in the number of events she performed by herself and Felipe&#x27;s and Letizia&#x27;s agendas became more distinct and separate, and José Manuel de Zuleta, 14th Duke of Abrantes, joined the Prince of Asturias&#x27;s Secretariat as private secretary to the Princess.

According to the compilation presented by the Royal Household on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Asturias, between 22 May 2004 and 22 May 2014 they attended together more than 1,516 official engagements, while Princess Letizia attended another 190 alone. They also made 73 trips abroad together to 38 countries, while the Princess traveled abroad alone on two occasions, once to Geneva (Switzerland) to visit the headquarters of the World Health Organization (WHO) and another to Berlin (Germany) for the presentation of the 3rd Eva Luise Köhler Research Award about rare diseases. Together with her husband, the Princess held 248 public audiences, in which they have seen more than 7,200 people, while the Princess alone held 107 audiences for 2,100 people.

== Queen of Spain ==

On 19 June 2014, Letizia became Queen of Spain with her husband&#x27;s accession as Felipe VI; as such, she holds the style of Majesty. She is the first Spanish-born queen consort since Mercedes of Orléans, the first wife of Alfonso XII, in 1878. She is also the first Spanish queen to have been born as a commoner. The queen consort was present when King Juan Carlos I gave his son, King Felipe VI, the sash of captain general of the Armed Forces (symbolizing the transfer of royal and military power), as well as when Felipe swore before the Cortes Generales to fulfill his duties, protect and defend the Constitution as well as respecting the rights of the citizens and the Spanish regions.

Queen Letizia undertook her first solo engagement as queen on 23 June 2014 at the inauguration of the El Greco and modern painting exhibition at the Prado Museum in Madrid. On 25 June 2014, the King ratified the Duke of Abrantes as her private secretary. In their first overseas trip as king and queen, Felipe and Letizia met Pope Francis on 30 June 2014, in the Apostolic Palace. They later met with Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, accompanied by Mgsr. Antoine Camilleri, under-secretary for Relations with States. The visit followed one by King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia on 28 April.
In September 2014, Letizia chaired the Royal Board on Disability, a government agency protected by the Crown whose president is the consort of the reigning monarch. On 25 October 2014, she attended the delivery ceremony of the Prince of Asturias Awards, the last with this name. From 2015 onwards, they were renamed &quot;Princess of Asturias Awards&quot; with Leonor, Princess of Asturias as their president. On 27 October 2014, she travelled to Vienna, Austria to inaugurate an exhibition about Spanish painter Diego Velázquez, which marked her first international solo visit. There, she met the Austrian president Heinz Fischer and his wife, Margit Fischer. It was not her last solo foreign visit that year, visiting Portugal in November for the Closing Ceremony of the 2nd Ibero-American Meeting on Rare Diseases and Italy to attend the Second International Conference on Nutrition, organized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, where she delivered the main speech. In her speech, she praised the role of women in the fight against hunger, described as &quot;unacceptable&quot; that more than 850 million people in the world suffer from hunger and demanded that the food industry balance its &quot;commercial interests&quot; with its &quot;responsibility&quot; to eradicate obesity. In December 2014, she chaired the general meeting of the Spanish Association Against Cancer, an association that she has chaired since 2010 and which she continues to do as queen.
During 2015, Letizia continued giving support to social causes related to relevant diseases, attending events and meetings of the Spanish Association Against Cancer, the Spanish Federation of Rare Diseases and the Spanish Red Cross, among others. The King and Queen had planned their first state visit for March 2015, to France. However, on 24 March 2015 they had to postponed the visit due to the pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 deliberately crashing the plane in the French Alps, killing 150 people, including 51 Spaniards. They resumed the state visit on early June, being welcomed by French president François Hollande. They also met the prime minister, Manuel Valls, the president of the French Senate, Gérard Larcher, the president of the National Assembly, Claude Bartolone and the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo. On 13 April 2015, Queen Letizia visited the Artillery Academy, which marked her first solo military event. A few days later, she travelled with her husband to Copenhagen, Denmark, to commemorate the 75th birthday of Queen Margrethe II. From 25 to 28 of May 2015, Letizia made her first international cooperation visit to Honduras and El Salvador.

In June 2015, Letizia was named Special Ambassador for Nutrition for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Late this month, after travelling to France, she and the King made a state visit to México, their first visit to the Americas as Spain&#x27;s sovereigns. They met the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, the First Lady, Angélica Rivera, the head of México City, Miguel Ángel Mancera and the leaders of the Congress of the Union. In late July 2015, she traveled alone to Milan, Italy for the Expo 2015. From 14 to 19 September 2015, the King and Queen made an official visit to the United States, where they visited American president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, and the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. They later traveled to Louisiana, where they were received by soldiers with the traditional uniform of the Spanish Louisiana and to Virginia, to visit Mount Vernon. In October 2015, she traveled alone to Düsseldorf, Germany, to inaugurate an exhibition about Spanish painter Zurbarán. That month, she also accompanied King Felipe to the Princess of Asturias Awards ceremony, the first since Leonor assumed as Princess of Asturias. At the end of 2015, the Queen attended two funerals. First, in November, she attended, with the rest of the Royal Family, the funeral of Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria in El Escorial. Second, in December, she attended the funeral of Spanish police officers killed in the 2015 Spanish Embassy attack in Kabul.

2016 was a low-key year for the Royal Family. The electoral process started with the 2015 general election and followed by the 2016 general election made it difficult for the Crown to develop a normal agenda. Letizia began 2016 by receiving different social entities in audience, such as the Roma Secretariat Foundation, the Association of Children&#x27;s Organizations of Spain, the Association for Specific Language Disorder of Madrid and the Spanish Nutrition Foundation, which informed the Queen about their goals, activity and projects.

In March 2016, leaked text messages between Letizia and businessman Javier López Madrid created controversy. Together with other executives and board members of the Caja Madrid and Bankia financial group, Madrid had been accused of corruption. In October 2014, Letizia pledged her support for him, texting &quot;We know who you are and you know who we are. We know each other, like each other, respect each other. To hell with the rest. Kisses yoga mate (miss you!!!)&quot;. Felipe also joined in, texting &quot;We do indeed!&quot; The newspaper &quot;El Diario&quot; later published these texts. A palace official subsequently stated that the King and Queen were no longer friends with López Madrid due to his legal issues. Also in March, Letizia made the first of the two international trips she had in 2016. She accompanied King Felipe to Puerto Rico, in order to chair the 7th International Congress of the Spanish Language. On 22 April 2016, the King and Queen gave audience to Spanish figure skater Javier Fernández after winning the 2016 World Championship (his second consecutive title). To finish the year, in late November 2016, the King and Queen made a state visit to Portugal, where they met Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and prime minister António Costa, among others. While the King was fulfilling his constitutional obligations before the Portuguese authorities, the Queen met with the president of the Portuguese League Against Cancer, Víctor Veloso.

2017 started very like the past year, with Letizia meeting some relevant social organizations that she chaired. In February, both the King and Queen welcomed important foreign leaders at the Royal Palace of Zarzuela, such as the German president Joachim Gauck and his wife, Gerhild Radtke, and the Hungarian president János Áder and his wife, Anita Herczegh. Precisely, in an event with these last guests, the royals learned the initial judicial ruling that declared Iñaki Urdangarin, the King&#x27;s brother-in-law, guilty of several corruption crimes. The King&#x27;s sister, Infanta Cristina, was cleared of all crimes. To finish the month, Felipe and Letizia welcomed the Argentine president, Mauricio Macri, and the First Lady, Juliana Awada, during their state visit to Spain.

On 23 March 2017, she made her first solo trip of the year to Porto, Portugal, to attend the 7th Conference on Tobacco or Health. There, she met the Portuguese president, the European Commissioner for Health and Safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis, the minister of Health of Portugal, Adalberto Campos Fernandes, and the mayor of Porto, Rui Moreira. In April 2017, Queen Letizia and King Felipe made a state visit to Japan. At the end of the year, they travelled to the Netherlands to celebrate the 50th birthday of Willem-Alexander. In May, they offered a lunch to Jordanian Princess Muna Al Hussein and to the Portuguese president. They also celebrated, along with King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía, the 40th anniversary of the Reina Sofía Foundation and the 10th anniversary of the Alzheimer Centre of the Foundation. In mid-July 2017, the Spanish royals made a state visit to the United Kingdom, where they met with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. They also reunited with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Charles and Camila.

On 31 October 2018, the Queen witnessed the first public address of her eldest daughter, Princess Leonor, who read the first article of the Spanish Constitution during the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Magna Carta. A year later, on 18 October 2019, Letizia accompanied her daughter Leonor to the delivery of the Princess of Asturias Awards, the first time for the young princess. The heir to the throne delivered her first speech in public in this event.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, King Felipe had to isolate himself in quarantine for testing positive for coronavirus in several occasions between 2020 and 2022. While he was isolated, the Queen replaced him in those events for which she was constitutionally authorized (awards delivery, lunches, inauguration of events, etc.) but not in those activities tightly related to constitutional responsibilities (such as the working meeting with the president of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Željko Komšić, in 2022, which had to be postponed. For the 2020 Rey Jaime I Awards in Valencia, Queen Letizia presented the award-winners with their gold medals and gave a short speech praising the &quot;talent, effort and generosity&quot; of prize-winners. In 2022, it was reported that Letizia was suffering from Morton&#x27;s neuroma.

After a one-month delay to avoid interfering with the electoral campaign of the 2023 general election, on 25 July 2023 the King and Queen inaugurated the Royal Collections Gallery, a new museum sponsored by &quot;Patrimonio Nacional&quot;, the government agency that guards the Crown assets. On 17 August 2023, King Felipe and Queen Letizia, together with Infanta Sofía, accompanied Princess Leonor to the General Military Academy, to begin three years of military training. Leonor used both her father&#x27;s and her mother&#x27;s surnames &quot;Borbón Ortiz&quot;. In late August 2023, she travelled with her youngest daughter, Sofía, to Australia to see the final of the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup between Spain and England. The Queen delivered the trophy to the World Champions, Spain, and celebrated with them on the pitch. Indirectly, this drew criticism to the British royal family for their absence from the event.

On 30 April 2024, State lawyer María Dolores Ocaña Madrid was appointed as private secretary to the Queen, being the first woman to hold the office.

On 3 November 2024, King Felipe, Queen Letizia, Prime Minister Sánchez and Valencian president Carlos Mazón were violently confronted during a meeting with victims of the October 2024 Spain floods in Paiporta in the Valencian Community, who threw mud and objects at them and injured two bodyguards. Although the Prime Minister had to be evacuated, the monarchs remained there listening to the complaints and requests of the residents. After the incident, the visit to neighboring towns was postponed, but the Royal Household confirmed that they would return &quot;in the next few days&quot;. The king returned to the region on November 12 to check the efforts of the Armed Forces in the disaster and, in November 19, the monarchs resumed the visit canceled two weeks earlier. On December 22, 2024 the King and Queen made a surprise visit to Catarroja to check in again to see how the residents were doing This visit was accompanied by Their Royal Highnesses Princess Leonor and Infanta Sofía during their respective school breaks.

== Titles, styles, honours and arms ==
=== Titles and styles ===
Upon marrying Felipe, Letizia was styled &quot;Her Royal Highness The Princess of Asturias&quot;, as consort of the Prince of Asturias, heir to the Spanish Crown. Likewise, Letizia had the right to use the other titles that belonged to Felipe as heir (these were those of Princess of Girona, Princess of Viana, Duchess of Montblanc, Countess of Cervera, and Lady of Balaguer).

After the accession of Felipe to the Spanish throne, Letizia became queen consort and was styled as &quot;Her Majesty The Queen&quot;. In private conversations, the most correct thing is to address her initially as &quot;Your Majesty&quot; (&quot;Majestad&quot;) and, later, as &quot;Madam&quot; (&quot;Señora&quot;), but never as &quot;You&quot; (&quot;Tú&quot; or &quot;Usted&quot;).

=== Honours ===
On 21 May 2004, the day before her marriage to Felipe, Letizia was appointed a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal and Distinguished Order of Charles III. Since then, Letizia has received different appointments and decorations by foreign states and other Spanish honours.

===Arms===
The coat of arms of Queen Letizia was adopted in 2014, based on the design created for her by the Asturian Academy of Heraldry and Genealogy (&quot;Academia Asturiana de Heráldica y Genealogía&quot;) in May 2004 and approved by Vicente de Cadenas y Vicent, Cronista Rey de Armas; this was used by her as Princess of Asturias. The revision of 2014 was confirmed by Don Alfonso Ceballos-Escalera y Gil, Chronicler of Arms for Castile and León.

The Queen&#x27;s coat of arms has no official status, as in Spain only those of the King, former King Juan Carlos, and of the Princess of Asturias are so recognized by Royal Decree.

<text>Abraham Vigoda (February 24, 1921 – January 26, 2016) was an American actor known for his portrayals of Salvatore Tessio in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) and Phil Fish in both &quot;Barney Miller&quot; (1975–1977, 1982) and &quot;Fish&quot; (1977–1978). His career as an actor began in 1947 performing with the American Theatre Wing and continued in Broadway productions throughout the 1960s and 1970s. 

==Early life and education==
Vigoda was born in Brooklyn, New York, on February 24, 1921, the son of Samuel Vigoda and Lena Moses, Jewish immigrants from Russia. His father was a tailor who had two other sons: Hy and Bill. The latter was a comic book artist who drew for the &quot;Archie Comics&quot; franchise and others in the 1940s. After leaving school, Vigoda worked as a printer before enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1943, serving in World War II. After his military service, he studied acting on the G.I. Bill at the American Theatre Wing. In the late 1940s, he began working in radio, and made his television debut in an installment of the live drama series &quot;Studio One&quot;.

==Career==

Vigoda began acting while in his 20s, working with the American Theatre Wing. His career as a professional actor began in 1947.

He gained acting notability in the late 1960s and early 1970s with his work in Broadway productions, including &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; (1967), portraying Mad Animal; &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; (1968), portraying Landau; &quot;Inquest&quot; (1970); and &quot;Tough to Get Help&quot; (1972), portraying Abraham Lincoln.

His best known film role is that of Salvatore Tessio in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972). He also appeared briefly in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, in a flashback sequence at the end of the film. According to Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s commentary on the DVD&#x27;s widescreen edition, Vigoda landed the role of Tessio in an &quot;open call&quot;, in which actors who did not have agents could come for an audition.

He gained further fame as Phil Fish on &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, a character known for his world-weary demeanor and persistent hemorrhoids. Vigoda landed the role after an unusual audition, in which he unwittingly displayed that he was a perfect fit for the role:

Vigoda&#x27;s character on &quot;Barney Miller&quot; was popular, and a spin-off television series, &quot;Fish,&quot; was created for him in 1977. The series, a situation comedy, ran from February 5, 1977, to May 18, 1978.

==Mistaken reports of death==
Prior to his actual death in January 2016, Vigoda was a repeated victim of mistaken death announcements. These led to jokes, often with Vigoda as a participant.

In 1982, &quot;People&quot; magazine mistakenly referred to Vigoda as dead. At the time, Vigoda, aged 60, was performing in a stage play in Calgary. He took the mistake with good humor, posing for a photograph published in &quot;Variety&quot;, in which he is sitting up in a coffin, holding the erroneous issue of &quot;People.&quot; Jeff Jarvis, a &quot;People&quot; employee at the time, said that the magazine&#x27;s editors were known for &quot;messing up&quot; stories, and one of them repeatedly inserted the phrase &quot;the late&quot; in reference to Vigoda, even after a researcher correctly removed it. The erroneous version was what went to print.

In 1987, the same mistake was made when a reporter for WWOR, Channel 9 in Secaucus, New Jersey, mistakenly referred to him as the &quot;late Abe Vigoda&quot;. She realized and corrected her mistake the next day.

He had been the subject of many running gags pertaining to the mistaken reports of his death. In 1997, Vigoda appeared in &quot;Good Burger&quot; as the character Otis, the titular restaurant&#x27;s french fry man. Several jokes were made about his high age, including his character Otis saying, &quot;I should&#x27;ve died years ago&quot;. That same year, he was shopping at Bloomingdale&#x27;s in Manhattan when the salesman remarked, &quot;You look like Abe Vigoda. But you can&#x27;t be Abe Vigoda because he&#x27;s dead.&quot; A &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; skit showed Letterman trying to summon Vigoda&#x27;s ghost, but Vigoda walked in and declared, &quot;I&#x27;m not dead yet, you pinhead!&quot;

At a New York Friars Club roast of Rob Reiner that Vigoda attended, Billy Crystal joked, &quot;I have nothing to say about Abe. I was always taught to speak well of the dead.&quot;

In May 2001, a website was created with only one purpose: to report whether Vigoda was alive or dead. In addition, in 2005, a &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; Firefox extension was released, with the sole purpose of telling the browser&#x27;s user of Vigoda&#x27;s status.

Continuing the gag, he frequently appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; to make fun of his status, including a guest appearance on the show&#x27;s final episode. At the 1998 New York Friars Club roast of Drew Carey, with Vigoda in the audience, Jeff Ross joked, &quot;My one regret is that Abe Vigoda isn&#x27;t alive to see this.&quot; He followed that with, &quot;Drew, you go to Vegas; what&#x27;s the over–under on Abe Vigoda?&quot; On January 23, 2009, Vigoda appeared on &quot;The Today Show.&quot; He said he was doing well, joked about previous reports of his death, and announced that he had just completed a voice-over for an H&amp;R Block commercial to air during the Super Bowl.

Vigoda and Betty White, both 88 years old, appeared in &quot;Game&quot;, a Snickers commercial that debuted during Super Bowl XLIV on February 7, 2010. The synopsis made fun of the advanced age of the actors. The Super Bowl Ad Meter poll respondents rated the ad the highest of any shown during the game.

On October 31, 2013, at age 92, Vigoda again defied rumors of his demise by appearing on stage with the American rock band Phish in Atlantic City, New Jersey, during a performance of the band&#x27;s song &quot;Wombat&quot;, from their 2014 album &quot;Fuego&quot;, which mentions Vigoda by name.

==Personal life==
Vigoda and his first wife Sonja Gohlke had one daughter named Carol. Their marriage ended in divorce. His second marriage to Beatrice Schy lasted from 1968 until her death in 1992.

Vigoda enjoyed playing handball, and stated in an interview that he was &quot;almost&quot; a champion at the game in his youth.

==Death==
On January 26, 2016, one month before his 95th birthday, Vigoda died in his sleep at his daughter Carol Fuchs&#x27;s home in Woodland Park, New Jersey, of natural causes. He had gone there &quot;to escape the hazards of a blizzard&quot;.

Vigoda&#x27;s funeral was held on January 31, 2016. Notable figures including comic Gilbert Gottfried and former New York City mayor David Dinkins attended. He was buried in the Beth David Cemetery in Elmont, Nassau County, New York.

At the 2016 Academy Awards show, Vigoda was not included in the show&#x27;s memorial reel, surprising many and prompting a small backlash.

<doc id="520848" wikidata="Q2239909" url="?curid=520848" title="Schlock Mercenary">
<text>Schlock Mercenary is a comedic webcomic written and drawn by Howard Tayler. It follows the tribulations of a star-travelling mercenary company in a satiric, mildly dystopian 31st-century space opera setting. After its debut on June 12, 2000, the comic was updated daily until its conclusion in July 24, 2020, supporting its author and receiving five Hugo Award nominations.

The comic had been collected into fifteen print volumes , and a sixteenth volume has been announced.

The online comic concluded in July 2020 at the end of the twentieth volume, with an announcement by Tayler that the main story was complete, though spin-offs might be expected in the future.

==Story==
The story primarily centers on Captain Kaff Tagon, his mercenary crew, Tagon&#x27;s Toughs, and their roles as members in a for-profit military organization. Various story lines have the crew swept into conflicts on a single planet, a galaxy-spanning apocalyptic crisis or intergalactic war.

In the distant future of &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot;&#x27;s setting, many changes face Terran society. Faster-than-light travel is attained, alien races are contacted, and technology undergoes radical improvements.

Alien species vary from fairly humanoid to almost unrecognizable. There are carbosilicate amorphs with no easily definable limbs or organs (the eponymous Sgt. Schlock), eight-limbed Gatekeepers, two-bodied Uklakk, and the unknowable Pa&#x27;anuri, beings made of dark matter.

The number of sapient species descended from Terran stock increased as Earth&#x27;s genetic engineers refined their craft. Enhanced chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, dolphins, snakes, octopuses, at least two types of bears, and two species of elephant have citizenship. Genetic enhancement of the human population resulted in the purple-skinned photosynthetic &quot;Purps&quot;, along with general improvements to the population.

===Technology===
As in many science fiction stories, technology forms a large part of &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot;&#x27;s storytelling framework. Several story arcs revolve around the political conflict surrounding rapid technological change. After a particularly complex or interesting new system is introduced to the comic, its in-comic explanation is often supplemented with a footnote.

Travel between the stars is accomplished through the use of &quot;wormgates&quot;, large wormhole generators controlled by the enigmatic F&#x27;sherl-Ganni Gatekeepers. Within the storyline of the comic, wormgates are supplanted by the &quot;teraport&quot;, a device allowing near-instant travel between any two points, as long as neither point is within range of an interdicting device. In that case, the teraporting object may be destroyed.

The F&#x27;sherl-Ganni also constructed several buuthandi, &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot;&#x27;s take on a Dyson sphere. A buuthandi is a balloon of solar-sail material around a star. Light pressure and solar wind offset the star&#x27;s gravitation to keep the balloon inflated, while habitats and maintenance facilities dangling from the inner side act as ballast to balance the sails. Despite their tremendous surface area, a buuthandi provides a disproportionally small amount of livable habitat. &quot;Control cables, millions of square kilometers of slack sail material, and some very clever engineering allow the &#x27;balloon&#x27; to compensate for (and, in some cases, mitigate) the mood swings of the contained star.&quot; In the &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot; universe, a buuthandi is about 300 million kilometers in diameter. (&quot;Buuthandi&quot; is a shortened form of a F&#x27;sherl-Ganni phrase which, after the foul language is removed, can be roughly translated as &quot;This was expensive to build.&quot;)

Medical technology includes nanobots and both artificial and regrown replacements for damaged body parts. One important item in the comic is the &quot;magic cryo-kit&quot;, an illegally-modified device with the capability to rebuild an entire body as long as the brain is intact. In the strip, this is shown as &quot;from the head down&quot;, but, presumably, nothing more than the brain is necessary. Conventional legal medical technology is also capable of full-body regeneration, although at a much slower pace and dependent on your HMO insurance options. The Toughs employ various technologies to protect survival of heads until their owners can be regenerated. An example of this technology is the comedically ubiquitous &quot;head-in-a-jar&quot;, which permits a character to interact in a storyline despite an otherwise-fatal injury. Another is the &quot;nanny-bag&quot;, which maintains the severed head and/or entire body of an otherwise mortally-wounded teammate for an unknown length of time. For example, Kevyn Andreyasn&#x27;s head was sustained for several weeks.

In addition to medical benefits, nanotechnology can &quot;boost&quot; soldiers to levels of physical performance unmodified humans cannot reach. Minor enhancements are legal, but extreme military modifications are highly-regulated. Significant examples of soldier-boosting within the strip are the mercenary grunt Nick and the bounty hunter Doythaban, as well as Kevyn in a particular story arc.

Computer hardware has progressed to the point that true, strong artificial intelligence is common, and several artificial intelligences are characters in the story.

Weapons technology drastically improved as well. A mercenary&#x27;s arsenal can include railguns, lasers, non-lethal nanomotive &quot;goober&quot; rounds, and plasma cannons. Old-fashioned bullet-firing firearms continue to be effective against unprotected targets... and are less likely to rupture a hull than a plasma bolt.

Energy is a resource literally too cheap to meter. Anything powered by miniaturized fusion reactors (which, in the 31st century, are so advanced, they can operate solely on atmospheric gasses), is easily-fueled by massively powerful neutronium-annihilation &quot;annie&quot; plants—spherical devices generating massive amounts of power by gravitationally converting mass to energy, a means of power generation made possible by ubiquitous gravity manipulation. One-shot devices (and bombs) are often powered by fullerened antimatter, a carbon-based powder which contains antiprotons at the parts-per-thousand level, and should &quot;never&quot; be incinerated.

Gravity manipulation is a process as commonplace as modern electronics, employed in starship propulsion and artificial gravity, and weapons and shielding against weapons. Controlled/artificial gravity is referred to as &quot;gravy.&quot; Gravitic weapons in particular are common and developed due to their dual purpose—as potent weapons, they can compress matter into neutronium which can then fuel an annie plant. The degree of this control is dependent on the number of projectors. For example, the battleplate &quot;Tunguska&quot; was able to manipulate individual limbs, and individual &quot;digits&quot; of crew on board the &quot;Serial Peacemaker&quot; while smaller ship create nodes of gravity in a few points on the ship and without the same level of control. However, the generation of gravity is beyond the capabilities of the sophonts of the Milky Way, necessitating ships to be constructed around annie plants as sources of gravity to manipulate.

These devices and more are built using fabrication technology, or &quot;fabbers&quot;. While rare and expensive, possession of one of these portable factories and the appropriate designs allows for the cheap mass-production of any physical item. Several of the mercenaries are trained in fabber design, allowing the company to cheaply produce and repair their gear.

==Main characters==
Notable members of the crew include Kevyn Andreyasn; title character Sergeant Schlock, who is a carbosilicate amorph; Petey, a former artificial intelligence and now Fleetmind and pseudo-God; and the wry AI and former boyband, Ennesby.

;Sergeant Schlock
:The title character, a carbosilicate amorph &quot;everyman&quot; with no easily definable limbs, organs, or moral compass. He normally appears as a large greenish-brown mass coming up to about normal human chest height.

;Captain Kaff Tagon
:The human leader of the mercenary company &quot;Tagon&#x27;s Toughs&quot;. In early strips of the comic, he exhibited overt sexism, such as proclaiming that &quot;women don&#x27;t belong in my command structure&quot; and hiring a doctor based on her looks.

;Kevyn Andreyasn
:Munitions Commander and resident mad scientist, an engineering genius. He has more common sense and faster intuition than most of the members of the mercenary company. He enjoys tinkering with stuff in his lab, being crazy over mechanical stuff as the stereotypical nerd. His most notable invention is the teraport, a teleportation technology which eventually led to full-scale warfare spanning the galaxy when it was made open source.

;Breya Andreyasn
:Former leader of the mercenaries, now diplomat, and Kevyn&#x27;s sister. She is highly competent, can operate in a variety of fields, and has little tolerance for disrespect, having once injured Captain Tagon after he purchased power armor for her which featured exaggerated breast sizes. She was first seen collaborating with her brother on commercializing his &quot;teraport&quot; stardrive, handling marketing and business aspects.

;Ennesby
:Ennesby is an AI with Tagon&#x27;s Toughs who looks like a &quot;flying maraca&quot; (the shape of his first physical body). He has human-looking eyes, a speaker grille in front that moves like a mouth, and floating eyebrows. The maraca is capable of withstanding chemical explosives at point-blank range. His various additional capabilities include short-ranged levitation and a maser.

;Post-Dated Check Loan (&quot;Petey&quot;)
:The artificial intelligence of the massive warship of the same name, originally the &quot;Sword of Inevitable Justice&quot;. Driven mad by a gruesome mutiny, Petey existed in a state of total introversion, rendering the ship nearly inoperative, until coaxed back to reality by the mercenary company. He controls the ship&#x27;s every function and manifests an avatar in the form of a floating hologram of an Ob&#x27;enn, the koala-like race of warmongering xenophobes that constructed him.

;Chief Warrant Officer Gunther Thurl
:His job entails sitting at a console, and that, coupled with a tendency to snack and some genetic predispositions, meant he used to be obese. Because of a botched mission during which Schlock ate everything but his head, his body had to be regrown. He is now a lot slimmer than what he was used to. When the company added several new recruits (including Andy and Legs, q.v.), he was promoted to Chief Warrant Officer. Due to his experience and age, Thurl handles many of the administrative tasks that the current ship AI, Tagii, and Ennesby do not or are not authorized to do.

;Doctor Edward Bunnigus
:Originally hired by Captain Tagon for her well-endowed figure, she has consistently demonstrated an ability to deal with every situation Tagon&#x27;s Toughs encounters. Less of a mercenary than many of her fellow officers, she concentrates on keeping the trigger-happy mercenaries alive. Her gender-inappropriate name, sizable intellect, and absurd proportions are the consequence of idiot parents and pre-birth gene therapy. Her parents wanted a child who had both a brilliant mind and the body proportions of an exotic dancer, because they thought their child should be both smart and beautiful. When the parents first looked upon the baby, the serial code on the tag on her wrist started with &quot;E.D.&quot;, for exotic dancer. Her parents, nowhere near as bright as she would one day be, assumed that &#x27;Ed&#x27; was her name, and called the girl Edward. She is married to Reverend Theo Fobius.

;Ellen &quot;Elf&quot; Foxworthy
:Elf began as a powered-armor soldier until a failed bounty hunt. She then became a tank pilot (her small size allowing her to fit into the Ob&#x27;Enn minitanks Petey had schematics for), and rose to become the head of her own minitank team.

;The Very Reverend Theo Fobius
:The company priest of an unspecified but fairly Christianesque faith, Theo is still a mercenary and has shown considerable theological flexibility when confronted with such things as an AI that goes explosively suicidal at the thought of the supernatural. His name, assuming it is derived from Greek, most fittingly means &quot;God-Fearing&quot;.

;Alexia Murtaugh
:Tagon&#x27;s Toughs first encountered Murtaugh when she was serving as head of security company &quot;Sanctum Adroit&quot; at the Haven Hive habitat. She was later fired from her security company and joined Tagons&#x27;s Toughs. She started at the bottom, but due to her long military experience she was later made a captain when the mercenary company obtained new ships.

==Publication history==

Over time, Tayler&#x27;s art improved, in his words, from bad to &quot;marginally less bad.&quot; Jean Elmore served as colorist for the strip from February 9, 2003, to the spring of 2004 when she developed a repetitive strain injury from her work.

On March 3, 2003, the comic reached its 1001st strip. Tayler marked the milestone by &quot;re-launching&quot; the comic. With the relaunch, the strip was slightly reoriented for publication, organizing the comic&#x27;s ongoing story into &quot;books&quot;. Each book has a fairly self-contained story, although they are still chronological and connected. On December 2, 2005, Tayler published the comic&#x27;s 2000th daily strip since the series&#x27; debut. On June 12, 2010, &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot; marked ten years of uninterrupted daily run, a feat matched by few other webcomics.

In March 2006, Tayler published &quot;Schlock Mercenary: Under New Management&quot;, the first book-based collection of &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot; comics. This collection features stories printed from March 9, 2003, through August 23, 2003, plus five pages of new material including a foreword by John Ringo, a feature explaining how Sgt. Schlock &quot;got turned on to plasma cannons&quot;, bonus art, the author&#x27;s biography, and architectural deck plans to Tagon&#x27;s third ship &quot;Serial Peacemaker&quot;.

In December 2007, Tayler published &quot;Schlock Mercenary: The Tub of Happiness&quot;. It features stories from the beginning of the webcomic to October 2001, as well as the bonus story &quot;Baggage Claim,&quot; explaining the circumstances around Schlock joining the Toughs. There are numerous pieces of fan art throughout the book, as well as early concept art drawn by Tayler and notes to the reader from both Tayler and his wife, talking about the characters and Tayler&#x27;s early cartooning efforts.

On Monday, February 17, 2014, Tayler announced that the strip had reached 5,000 comics. On Tuesday, June 11, 2019, Tayler announced that the strip had reached 19 years of continuous daily comics.

===Schlocktoberfest===
Schlocktoberfest was a mostly-annual storyline that occurred during the month of October prior to 2009. The story arc generally started out typically, but soon developed a dark tone, usually involving gruesome events and often character death, before typically resolving itself at the end of the month. The last year with a Schlocktoberfest storyline was 2008, and Tayler has stated that he is no longer doing it.

===Collections===
Collections of &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot; strips were originally published in book form by &quot;The Tayler Corporation&quot;, and are now published through Hypernode Press. Tayler&#x27;s wife, Sandra, is the publisher. The first published collection, &quot;Under New Management&quot; does not start at the beginning of the archive, but at the 1001st strip, when the strip was relaunched. The first 1,000 strips were published later in books 1 and 2.

Released and announced book titles are as follows:

# &quot;The Tub of Happiness&quot; (, December 2007)
# &quot;The Teraport Wars&quot; (, October 2008)
# &quot;Under New Management&quot; (, May 2006)
# &quot;The Blackness Between&quot; (, November 2006)
# &quot;The Scrapyard of Insufferable Arrogance&quot; (, June 2009)
# &quot;Resident Mad Scientist&quot; (, July 2010)
# &quot;Emperor Pius Dei&quot; (, July 2011)
# &quot;The Sharp End of the Stick&quot; (, June 2012)
# &quot;The Body Politic&quot; (, August 2013)
# &quot;The Longshoreman of the Apocalypse&quot; (, June 2014)
# &quot;Massively Parallel&quot; (, December 2014)
# &quot;Force Multiplication&quot; (, August 2016)
# &quot;Random Access Memorabilia&quot; (February 2018)
# &quot;Broken Wind&quot; (April 2019)
# &quot;Delegates and Delegation&quot; (April 2019)
# &quot;Big, Dumb Objects&quot;

The books were renumbered in 2007 to allow for the release of &quot;The Tub of Happiness&quot; and &quot;The Teraport Wars&quot;. Originally, Roman numerals were used, with &quot;Under New Management&quot; as the first book.

=== The Seventy Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries ===

&quot;The Seventy Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries&quot; is a popular handbook in the &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot; universe, with characters regularly quoting from it. It was originally called &quot;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Pirates&quot;, a parody of &quot;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;, but after Tayler received a cease and desist letter from FranklinCovey, he made the retcon on January 24, 2011. Tayler said that the letter &quot;was worded as nicely as such a thing can be&quot;.

Two print versions of &quot;Seventy Maxims&quot; were released:
*Pristine (, December 2016)
*Defaced (has handwritten notes and &quot;stains&quot; from being &quot;used&quot; by the characters) (, February 2017)

===Games===
====Capital Offensive====
In 2012, Living Worlds Games published &quot;Schlock Mercenary: Capital Offensive&quot;, a board game based upon the webcomic, to positive reviews from reviewers such as The Dice Tower.

====Planet Mercenary====
A role-playing game, based on the comic and written by Alan Bahr and Howard Tayler, was launched as a Kickstarter on April 14, 2015. It successfully funded the following day.

===Other related works===
John Ringo&#x27;s &quot;Troy Rising&quot; series has been inspired by the &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot; universe. It is set in the early days of human-alien contact, but is not considered canon for the comic series.

The webcomic &quot;Under the Lemon Tree&quot; published a crossover with &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot;, though it is non-canon in the &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot; continuity.

==Reception and honors==
The first &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot; book publication was covered in &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;, which described it as &quot;inventive and humorous.&quot; The comic tied for outstanding science fiction comic in the Web Cartoonist&#x27;s Choice Awards in 2004, and was again nominated in 2005 and 2007. The strip won for Best Cameo in the 2001 awards.

Five story collections have been nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story: &quot;The Body Politic&quot; (2009),
&quot;The Longshoreman of the Apocalypse&quot; (2010), &quot;Massively Parallel&quot; (2011), &quot;Force Multiplication&quot; (2012), and &quot;Random Access Memorabilia&quot; (2013).

&quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot; has also been cited on lists of top web comics published by &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;Ars Technica&quot;.

<doc id="520882" wikidata="Q7318575" url="?curid=520882" title="Revoke">
<text>In trick-taking card games, a revoke (sometimes renege, or ) is a violation of the rules regarding the play of tricks that is sufficient to render the round invalid. A revoke is a violation ranked in seriousness somewhat below overt cheating, and is considered a minor offense when unintentional, though there are usually severe penalties for revokes. A revoke is usually a violation of one or more honor rules, and often comes to light after its commission, as trick-taking games play with hands concealed.

==Honor rules==

Trick-taking games normally have several rules regarding which cards may and may not be played to a trick. For example, most games require a player to follow suit - that is, to play in the suit led - if possible. Rules of this sort are sometimes called honor rules, because there is no way to detect a violation at the moment of its commission, although it will almost certainly be discovered later. For example, if a player does not play a spade to a trick where spades were led, other players will simply assume that player has no spades and note the fact in future play decisions. However, attentive players will soon notice the violation when a spade is played to a subsequent trick. 

Some honor rules in different trick-taking games include the following:

* Spades, Euchre and 500 require that players play to the suit led, unless void in it.
* Hearts requires that players follow the suit led. In some variants, a player holding the Queen of Spades and void in the led suit is required to play it.
*Pinochle requires players to
** play to the led suit unless void in it, with a potentially winning (higher than the highest-so-far) card, if possible;
** if void in the led suit, trump with a potentially winning card, if one is in their hand; or
** play some remaining card.
*Bourré requires players to
** play to the led suit unless void in it, with a potentially winning (higher than the highest-so-far) card if possible;
** if void in the led suit, trump with a potentially winning card;
** play to bourré as many other players as possible.
*Forty-fives requires players to follow suit or play a trump card if possible (note that the Ace of Hearts is always a trump card and must be played on a trump if the player holds no other trumps). Some variants permit reneging with the 5 of trumps.

==Penalties==
A common penalty for a revoke is to give the player a penalty equal to the most severely negative outcome of the round possible. For example, in a game of Hearts, the worst possible score achievable in a round is 25 points, so the offending player would receive 25 points in penalty for a revoke. Therefore, a revoke rarely has a strategic advantage, except in kingmaker scenarios.

Some penalties in different trick-taking games include the following:

* In Bridge, the penalty for a revoke is normally one or two tricks scored against the offending partnership, depending on the exact circumstances, but if the non-offending side is more seriously damaged than that (typically because the revoke made a critical entry worthless), then they are compensated accordingly.
* In Pinochle and many other bidding trick games, a revoke results in an automatic &quot;set&quot;, or failure at the bid, normally precipitating a penalty.
* In Hearts, a revoking player receives all 26 (penalty) points, and each other player receives none. 
* In Bourré, a revoking player must forfeit an amount of money equal to the pot.
* In Euchre, a revoking player/team loses bid and receives a 2-point penalty, while the opponents are awarded two points.
* In Bid Euchre (Pepper), a revoking player playing the bid loses the bid and receives a 2-point penalty. The opponents are awarded the bid. A revoking team playing against the bid forfeits the bid to the player playing the bid. They also receive a penalty in the amount of the bid being played.
* In 500, a revoking player playing the bid loses the trick on which they revoked, and the trick subsequent to that in which the revoked card was played. If the revoking player is playing the bid, the points are subtracted from the round score. If the revoking player is not playing the bid, the points are added to the round score.
*In Forty-fives, revoking is called &quot;reneging&quot;, and the applicable rules vary; most often, a player loses all points earned in that hand.

<text>The Guru Granth Sahib (, ) is the central holy religious scripture of Sikhism, regarded by Sikhs as the final, sovereign and eternal Guru following the lineage of the ten human gurus of the religion. The Adi Granth (), its first rendition, was compiled by the fifth guru, Guru Arjan (1564–1606). Its compilation was completed on 29 August 1604 and first installed inside the Golden Temple in Amritsar on 1 September 1604. Baba Buddha was appointed the first Granthi of the Golden Temple. Shortly afterwards Guru Hargobind added Ramkali Ki Vaar. Later, Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh guru, added hymns of Guru Tegh Bahadur to the Adi Granth and affirmed the text as his successor. This second rendition became known as the Guru Granth Sahib and is also sometimes referred to as the Adi Granth.

The text consists of 1,430 &quot;angs&quot; (pages) and 5,894 &quot;shabads&quot; (line compositions), which are poetically rendered and set to a rhythmic ancient north Indian classical form of music. The bulk of the scripture is divided into 31 main &quot;rāgas&quot;, with each Granth rāga subdivided according to length and author. The hymns in the scripture are arranged primarily by the &quot;rāgas&quot; in which they are read. The Guru Granth Sahib is written in the Gurmukhi script in various languages including Punjabi, Lahnda, regional Prakrits, Apabhramsa, Sanskrit, Hindi languages (Braj Bhasha, Bangru, Awadhi, Old Hindi), Bhojpuri, Sindhi, Marathi, Marwari, Bengali, Persian and Arabic. Copies in these languages often have the generic title of Sant Bhasha.

The Guru Granth Sahib was composed predominantly by six Sikh gurus: Guru Nanak, Guru Angad, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur. It also contains the traditions and teachings of fourteen Hindu Bhakti movement &quot;sants&quot; (saints), such as Ramananda, Kabir and Namdev among others, and one Muslim Sufi saint: Sheikh Farid.

The vision in the Guru Granth Sahib is of a society based on divine freedom, mercy, love, belief in one god and justice without oppression of any kind. While the Granth acknowledges and respects the scriptures of Hinduism and Islam, it does not imply a moral reconciliation with either of these religions. It is installed in a Sikh &quot;gurdwara&quot; (temple). A Sikh typically prostrates before it on entering such a temple. The Granth is revered as eternal &quot;gurbānī&quot; and the spiritual authority in Sikhism.

==History==
Guru Nanak composed hymns, which were sung by his followers in &quot;rāga&quot; set to music. His successor, Guru Angad, opened centers and distributed these hymns. The community would sing the hymns and his agents collected donations. This tradition was continued by the third and fourth gurus as well. The fifth guru, Guru Arjan, discovered that Prithi Chand – his eldest brother and a competing claimant to the Sikh guruship – had a copy of an earlier &quot;pothi&quot; (palm-leaf manuscript) with hymns and was distributing hymns of the earlier gurus along with his own of hymns. Guru Arjan considered these as spurious and became concerned about establishing an authentic anthology of approved hymns.

Guru Arjan began compiling an officially approved version of the sacred scripture for the Sikh community. He sent his associates across the Indian subcontinent to collect the circulating hymns of Sikh gurus and convinced Mohan, the son of Guru Amar Das, to give him the collection of the religious writings of the first three gurus in a humble manner by singing the hymns registered in &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;, 248. As his associates returned with their collections, Guru Arjan selected and edited the hymns for inclusion in the Adi Granth with Bhai Gurdas as his scribe. This effort yielded several drafts and manuscripts, some of which have survived into the modern era.

The oldest surviving manuscript version of the Adi Granth is the Guru Nanak Dev University Manuscript 1245, which has been dated to . Other early editions of the Adi Granth with some variations include the Bahoval pothi (c. 1600), Vanjara pothi (c. 1601) and Bhai Rupa pothi (c. 1603).

Another early variant manuscript is called the Guru Harsahai pothi, preserved by Sodhis and is believed to be the one that existed before Guru Arjan&#x27;s compilation and one he gave to his eldest brother Prithi Chand. It was initially installed in Amritsar, then was moved in the 18th-century and preserved in Guru Harsahai (35 kilometers west of Faridkot, Punjab) till 1969, when the state government requested it be displayed for the 500 years celebrations. It was moved for the first time in over 200 years and briefly displayed in Patiala for the event. Thereafter, the Sodhis consented to transfers. In 1970, however, during another such transfer, this early version of the Adi Granth manuscript was stolen. However, photos of some pages have survived.

This manuscript is claimed by the Sodhis to be the oldest and one written in part by Guru Nanak. However, this claim is first observed only much later, in texts attributed to the 17th-century Hariji, the grandson of Prithi Chand. Based on the evidence in the surviving photos, it is unlikely that Guru Nanak wrote or maintained a pothi. The features in its Gurmukhi script and the language suggest that the hymns are significantly older, and that the pre-canonical hymns were being written down in early Sikhism and preserved by the Sikh Gurus prior to the editing by Guru Arjan. The existence of Guru Harsahai manuscript attests to the early tradition of Sikh scripture, its existence in variant forms and a competition of ideas on its contents including the Mul Mantar.

Many minor variations, and three significant Adi Granth recensions, are known; these provide insights into how the Sikh scripture was compiled, edited and revised over time. There is a fourth significant version called the Lahori bir, but it primarily differs in how the hymns are arranged and the final pages of the Adi Granth.

===Editions===

In 1604, the first edition of the Sikh scripture, Adi Granth, was complete and officially approved by Guru Arjan. It was installed at the Golden Temple, with Baba Buddha as the first &quot;granthi&quot; or reader. No hymns were added by Guru Hargobind, Guru Har Rai and Guru Har Krishan. In the Sikh tradition, Guru Hargobind is credited for adding the &quot;rāga&quot; tunes for nine out of 22 Vars. The hymns of IX Guru Tegh Bahadur, after his beheading in Delhi, were added to the scripture by his son and successor Guru Gobind Singh.

In 1704 at Damdama Sahib, during a one-year respite from the heavy fighting with the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, Guru Gobind Singh and Bhai Mani Singh added the religious compositions of Guru Tegh Bahadur to the Adi Granth to create the final edition, called the Guru Granth Sahib. Prior to Guru Gobind Singh, three versions of the Adi Granth pothi with minor variations were in circulation at Sikh shrines across the Indian subcontinent. In addition, several unauthorized versions were in circulation, issued by sects founded by one of the sons or relatives of earlier Sikh Gurus such as Prithi Chand, Guru Arjan&#x27;s elder brother. Guru Gobind Singh issued the definitive final edition that included the hymns of his father, and closed the canon. This manuscript is called the Damdama bir, and a 1707 rare copy of this manuscript is now preserved at the Toshakhana in Nanded, Maharashtra.

The compositions of Guru Gobind Singh were not included in the Guru Granth Sahib and set into the &quot;Dasven Padsah ka Granth&quot;, which is more popularly known as the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot;. The compilation and release of this definitive edition of the latter was completed by Bhai Mani Singh.

=== Extensions of the Guru Granth Sahib ===
The Akali Nihang sect of Sikhs consider the Dasam Granth and the Sarbloh Granth as extensions of the Guru Granth Sahib. As such, they refer to these scriptures as Sri Dasam Guru Granth Sahib, and Sri Sarbloh Guru Granth Sahib. They call the Guru Granth Sahib, Aad Guru Granth Sahib. They also sometimes refer to the granths as &quot;Durbar&quot;, such as Aad Guru Durbar. The Sarbloh Granth has another name, as Sri Manglacharan Purana. They believe that all three of these scriptures are authentic, written by the Gurus and are one of the same. For this reason, they will often place the Dasam and Aad Granths on the same level and on the same throne (also known as the palki). They also sometimes do this for the Sarbloh Granth as well.

=== Weapons in front of the Guru Granth Sahib ===
In virtually all Sikh Gurdwaras, one will find an assortment of weapons such as swords, daggers, war quoits, etc. in front of the Guru Granth Sahib. This was brought about due to the emphasis of a martial spirit within the Sikh religion, as well as an influential composition from the Dasam Granth known as the &quot;Shastar Naam Mala&quot;&quot;,&quot; written by Guru Gobind Singh. Within this composition, it praises various types of weapons from all over the world, including swords, saifs, curved swords (tulwars), arrows, guns, etc. There is a famous line within the composition which states,

ਅਸ ਕ੍ਰਿਪਾਨ ਖੰਡੋ ਖੜਗ ਤੁਪਕ ਤਬਰ ਅਰੁ ਤੀਰ ॥ ਸੈਫ ਸਰੋਹੀ ਸੈਹਥੀ ਯਹੈ ਹਮਾਰੈ ਪੀਰ ॥੩॥

“ As Kripan Khando Kharag, Tupak Tabar Ar Teer || Saif Sarohee Saithhee, Yehai Hamare Peer||3||”

The kirpan, the khanda, the scimitar, the axe, the rifle, and the arrow. The saif, the dagger, the spear: these indeed are our pirs (saints)!

(Shastar Naam Mala, Dasam Guru Granth Sahib)

For this reason, weapons are meant to be kept in front of the Guru Granth Sahib.

===Contributors===


The Guru Granth Sahib contains predominantly hymns of the following Sikh Gurus: Guru Nanak, Guru Angad, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan and Guru Teg Bahadur. Whilst these six gurus are widely accepted as having their writings included in the Guru Granth Sahib, there are some who argue compositions of Guru Har Rai and Guru Gobind Singh are also included. A &quot;Salok Mahalla Satvan&quot; (7) and &quot;Dohra Mahalla Dasvan&quot; (10) have been attributed by some to the seventh and tenth gurus, respectively. It also contains hymns and verses of thirteen Hindu Bhakti movement &quot;sant poets&quot; (saints) and two Muslim saint poets. There are also idolatry verses for the Gurus such as Guru Nanak fused into some pages, those composed by bards (Bhatts). The hymns and verses are different lengths, some very long, others being just a few line verses. Twenty-two of the thirty-one ragas contain the contributions of &quot;bhagats&quot;. The following is a list of contributors whose hymns are present in the Guru Granth Sahib as well as the number of hymns they contributed:

===Manuscript versions===
In the 19th and 20th-century, several manuscript versions of the Adi Granth and the Guru Granth Sahib hymns were discovered. This triggered contesting theories about authenticity and how the canonical text of Sikhism evolved over time. There are five views:
*The first view held by scholars such as Balwant Singh Dhillon states that there was a consistent &quot;mother tradition&quot;, where the hymns of Guru Nanak were carefully preserved as a single codex without any corruption or unauthorized changes, to which the later Gurus added additional hymns. The Sikh scripture developed in linear, pure form becoming first the Adi Granth and finally the closed version of the Guru Granth Sahib. According to this view, there was no pre-canonical diversity, the scripture developed in an organized and disciplined format, and it denies the existence of alternate hymns and texts that were cherished by Sikhs of an earlier era.
*The second view held by scholars such as Gurinder Singh Mann states that the scripture started from a single process, proceeded linearly, then diversified into separate textual traditions with some variations, over time. This school of scholars supports their theory by highlighting the similarities of the manuscripts and close match particularly between the three manuscripts called the Guru Har Sahai MS, the Govindval MS, and the Guru Nanak Dev University MS 1245. This theory is weakened by variations observed in 27 manuscript variants now dated between 1642 and 1692. The alternate formulation of this theory states that two branches developed over time, with the Peshawar pothi and Kartarpur pothi being the two branches.
*The third view held by scholars such as Piar Singh states that independent versions of the Sikh scripture developed in geographically distant regions of the Indian subcontinent. These versions developed because of the forgetfulness or creativity of the local Sikh leaders, errors made by scribes, attempts to adopt popular hymns of bhagats or adapt the hymns to local regional languages where Gurmukhi was not understood. It is these manuscripts that Guru Arjan collected and considered, then edited to produce an approved version of the Adi Granth. The Sikh scripture, according to this school, was thus a collaborative effort and there was no authentic version of the pre-canonical text in Sikhism.
*The fourth view builds upon this third view and is supported by scholars such as Jeevan Deol. According to this view, there were independent textual traditions in Sikhism before Guru Arjan decided to edit and redact them into the Adi Granth. These textual traditions developed in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, greatly influenced by the popularity of regional bhagats and their Bhakti movement ideas about &quot;nirguna&quot; and &quot;saguna&quot; forms of the divine, with Guru Arjan favoring the &quot;nirgun&quot; versions. The Adi Granth reflects the review, editing and compilation of complex and diverse textual traditions before him.
*The fifth view held by scholars such as Pashaura Singh develops and refines the fourth view. It states that the Sikh scripture emerged from a collaborative effort of Guru Arjan and his trusted associates, particularly Bhai Gurdas and Jagana Brahmin of Agra. His collaborators were his devout admirers, well versed in the Sikh thought, Sanskrit traditions and philosophical schools of Indian religions. The variant manuscripts support this theory, as does the handwriting analysis of the Kartarpur bir (manuscript) allegedly approved by Guru Arjan which shows at least four distinct scribal styles. The variations in the manuscripts also affirm that the Adi Granth did not develop in a linear way, i.e. it was not simply copied from a previous version.

==Composition==
The entire Guru Granth Sahib is written in the Gurmukhi script, which was standardized by Guru Angad in the 16th century. According to Sikh tradition and the &quot;Mahman Prakash&quot;, an early Sikh manuscript, Guru Angad Dev had taught and spread Gurmukhi at the suggestion of Guru Nanak Dev who invented the Gurmukhi script. The word &quot;Gurmukhī&quot; translates to &quot;from the mouth of the guru&quot;. It descended from the Laṇḍā scripts and was used from the outset for compiling Sikh scriptures. The Sikhs assign a high degree of sanctity to the Gurmukhī script. It is the official script for writing Punjabi in the Indian State of Punjab.

Gurus considered divine worship through &quot;shabad kirtan&quot; as the best means of attaining that state of bliss – &quot;vismad&quot; – which resulted in communion with God. The Guru Granth Sahib is divided by musical settings or rāgas into 1430 pages known as &quot;ang&quot;s &quot;limbs&quot; in Sikh tradition. It can be categorized into three sections:

# Introductory section consisting of the Mul &quot;Mantar&quot;, Japji Sahib, So Dhar (Rehras) and Sohila, composed by Guru Nanak;
# Compositions of Sikh gurus, followed by those of the &quot;bhagat&quot;s who know only God, collected according to the chronology of &quot;ragas&quot; or musical settings. (see below).
# The post &quot;raga&quot; section containing Sanskrit &quot;Shaloka&quot;, the &quot;Gatha&quot;, &quot;Phunhe&quot;, and &quot;Chaubole&quot; compositions, &quot;Shaloka&quot; of Kabir, &quot;Shaloka&quot; of Farid, &quot;Savaiye&quot; by Guru and 11 Bhatts, &quot;Saloka&quot; of Guru Nanak, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ramdas, Guru Arjan, and Guru Tegh Bhaduar, &quot;Mundawani&quot; (closing), and Ragmala (the list of &quot;ragas&quot;).

The word &quot;raga&quot; refers to &quot;color&quot; here according to &quot;raga&quot; grammar the Gurus divided different scenarios one devotee is spiritually associated with the divine, for example the soul, referred to as female, may be separated, awaiting union, or united with the beloved. The emotion or mood produced by a combination or sequence of pitches. A rāga is composed of a series of melodic motifs, based upon a definite scale or mode of the seven svara psalmizations, that provide a basic structure around which the musician performs. Gurbani raags are not time dependent. The Ragmala (the final composition of the &quot;Granth&quot;) delineates how different ragas are related to each other. 

Following is the list of all sixty rāgas under which Gurbani is written, in order of appearance with page numbers:

===Other recurring composition styles===
Each &quot;raga&quot; section contains the typical compositions of the Gurus in chronological order by Guru (who wrote in that &quot;raga&quot;) followed by the typical compositions of the &quot;bhagats&quot; at the end however some form of certain types of special compositions such as the common recurring &quot;Vaar&quot;s (longer ballad type poems), &quot;Chhands&quot; (poems based on an annunciation metre), &quot;Ashtapadiyan&quot; (contemplative measure), &quot;Pehre&quot; (poems on the four parts of the day), &quot;Haftawaar&quot; or &quot;Var Sat&quot; (poems about the seven days of the week), &quot;Bara Maha&quot; (poems based on the twelve months of the year), &quot;Thhithi&quot; (astrological poems based on the fifteen lunar dates) themes are found near the end of the most &quot;raga&quot; sections.

==Meaning and role in Sikhism==
In 1708, Guru Gobind Singh conferred the title of &quot;Guru of the Sikhs&quot; upon the Adi Granth. The event was recorded in a &quot;Bhatt Vahi&quot; (a bard&#x27;s scroll) by an eyewitness, Narbud Singh, who was a bard at the Rajput rulers&#x27; court associated with gurus. Sikhs since then have accepted the Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred scripture, as their eternal-living guru, as the embodiment of the ten Sikh Gurus, the highest religious and spiritual guide for Sikhs. It plays a central role in guiding the Sikh&#x27;s way of life.

No one can change or alter any of the writings of the Sikh gurus written in the Guru Granth Sahib. This includes sentences, words, structure, grammar, and meanings. This tradition was set by Guru Har Rai. He sent his eldest son Ram Rai as an emissary to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in Delhi. Aurangzeb, a devout Muslim ruler, objected to a verse in the Sikh scripture (&quot;Asa ki Var&quot;) that stated, &quot;the clay from a Musalman&#x27;s grave is kneaded into potter&#x27;s lump&quot;, considering it an insult to Islam. Ram Rai tried to please the emperor by explaining that the text was miscopied and modified it, substituting &quot;Musalman&quot; with &quot;Beiman&quot; (faithless, evil) which Aurangzeb approved. The willingness to change a word led Guru Har Rai to bar his son from his presence, and name his younger son as his successor.

===Recitation===

The Guru Granth Sahib is always the focal point in any gurdwara, seated on a raised platform known as a &quot;Takht&quot; (throne), while the congregation of devotees sits on the floor and prostrate before the guru as a sign of respect. The Guru Granth Sahib is given the greatest respect and honour. Sikhs cover their heads and remove their shoes while in the presence of this sacred scripture, their eternal living guru. The Guru Granth Sahib is normally carried on the head and as a sign of respect, never touched with unwashed hands or put on the floor. It is attended with all signs of royalty, with a canopy placed over it. A &quot;Chaur Sahib&quot; (fan whisk) is waved above the Guru Granth Sahib.

The Guru Granth Sahib is taken care of by a Granthi, who is responsible for reciting from the sacred hymns and leading Sikh prayers. The Granthi also acts as caretaker for the Guru Granth Sahib, keeping the scripture covered in clean cloths, known as &quot;rumala&quot;, to protect from heat and dust. The Guru Granth Sahib rests on a &quot;manji sahib&quot; under a &quot;rumala&quot; until brought out again.

===Rituals===

Several rituals are performed every day in major Sikh gurdwaras (temples) such as the Golden Temple. These rituals treat the scripture as a living person, a guru, out of respect. The rituals include:
* Closing ritual called &quot;sukhasan&quot; (&quot;sukh&quot; means &quot;comfort or rest&quot;, &quot;asan&quot; means &quot;position&quot;). At night, after a series of devotional kirtans and three part ardās, the Guru Granth Sahib is closed, carried on the head, placed into and then carried in a flower decorated, pillow-bed palki (palanquin), with chanting to its bedroom. Once it arrives there, the scripture is tucked into a bed.
* Opening ritual called &quot;prakash&quot; which means &quot;light&quot;. About dawn everyday, the Guru Granth Sahib is taken out its bedroom, carried on the head, placed and carried in a flower-decorated palki with chanting, sometimes with bugles sounding its passage. It is brought to the sanctum. Then after ritual singing of a series of Var Asa kirtans and &quot;ardas&quot;, a random page is opened. The first complete verse on the left page is the &quot;mukhwak&quot; (or &quot;vak&quot;) of the day. It is read out loud, and then written out for the pilgrims to read over that day.
According to Kristina Myrvold, every Sikh scripture copy is treated like a person and venerated with elaborate ceremonies which are a daily means of &quot;merit bestowing ministrations&quot;. These daily ritual ministrations and paying of homage for the scripture by Sikhs, states Myrvold, is not unique to Sikhism. It moulds &quot;meanings, values and ideologies&quot; and creates a framework for congregational worship, states Myrvold, that is found in all major faiths.

==Translations==
Ernest Trumpp, a German philologist, published the first philological study and a major but incomplete English translation of the Guru Granth Sahib in 1877, after an eight-year study of the text and field interviews with Sikh intelligentsia of his time. Trumpp included his criticism of the Sikh scripture in the preface and introductory sections, and stated &quot;Sikhism is a waning religion, that will soon belong to history&quot;. Many in the Sikh community regarded these introductory remarks to his translation as extremely offensive. Nonetheless, according to Indologist Mark Juergensmeyer, Ernest Trumpp&#x27;s years of scholarship, translations, and field notes and discussions with Sikhs at the Golden Temple remain valuable reference works for contemporary scholars. Akshaya Kumar holds Trumpp&#x27;s translation to be &quot;literal and mechanical&quot; emphasizing preciseness and fastidiously retaining the words as well as the syntax of the original verses, avoiding any creative and inventive restatement to empathize with a believer. On the other hand, Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair noted the clear influence from the Brahmanical leanings of his Nirmala collaborators, among the British-supported Sikh class which had been long enjoying British patronage as they helped to keep &quot;hostile&quot; elements under control. For example, they induced Trumpp to omit the numeral &quot;one&quot; in the phrase Ik Oankar in his translation, in an attempt to bring the scripture closer to the Brahmanical-influenced interpretation of the sects that differed with the interpretation of the orthodox Khalsa. Trumpp&#x27;s translation was seen to be a challenge to the administration&#x27;s already-established view that the Sikhs were a distinct community, prompting the Khalsa to commission its own translation. Trumpp, as well as other translators, were commissioned by colonial administrators.

Max Arthur Macauliffe, a British civil servant, was next to publish a major but incomplete translation of the Guru Granth Sahib, covering the same ground as Trumpp. However, he interspersed his translation between &quot;Janamsakhis&quot;-based mythical history of the Sikh Gurus. A major source of his historical information was &quot;Suraj Prakash&quot; of Santokh Singh, and his primary translation advisor was the prominent Khalsa Sikh scholar Kahn Singh Nabha, the author of &quot;Gurmat Prabhakar&quot; and &quot;Hum Hindu Nahin&quot;. Macauliffe&#x27;s translation appeared embedded in the six-volume &quot;The Sikh Religion&quot; and was published by Oxford University Press in 1909. Unlike Trumpp, who was unconcerned with the sensibilities of the Sikhs, Macauliffe used his editorial abilities to incorporate such considerations. According to Indologist Giorgio Shan, while Trumpp criticized Sikhism and the Guru Granth Sahib, Macauliffe criticized Hinduism and wrote an introduction that presented the hymns of Sikh Gurus as Christian-like with affinities to &quot;Protestant virtues and ethics&quot;, presumably for a British audience. Macauliffe&#x27;s translation was well received by the Sikh community, and they considered it closer to how they interpret their scripture. Post-colonial scholarship has questioned Macauliffe&#x27;s accounting for and incorporation of Sikh traditions as &quot;uncritical&quot; and &quot;dubious&quot;, though one that pleased the Sikh community. Macauliffe&#x27;s version has been widely followed by later scholars and translators. According to Christopher Shackle, a scholar of Languages and Religion, Macauliffe&#x27;s approach to translation was to work with Khalsa Sikh reformists of the 1890s (Singh Sabha) and exegetically present the scripture in a &quot;progressive monotheism&quot; fold that deserved the support of the British administration as a distinct tradition, and of the native Sikh clergy. He used considerable freedom in restating the archaic poetry into a &quot;vaguely psalm-like translation&quot;.

The first complete English translation of the Guru Granth Sahib, by Gopal Singh, was published in 1960. A revised version published in 1978 removed archaic English words such as &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot;. In 1962, an eight-volume translation into English and Punjabi by Manmohan Singh was published by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. In the 2000s, a translation by Sant Singh Khalsa appeared on major Sikhism-related websites such as 3HO/Sikh Dharma Brotherhood&#x27;s Sikhnet.com.

== Printing ==
According to Namdhari Sikh literature, Diwan Buta Singh was the first person to print an edition of the Guru Granth Sahib, which was likely printed in 1868 or even earlier. Early printed editions of the Guru Granth Sahib from the late-19th century were not only printed in Gurmukhi script but also Perso-Arabic script, as evidenced by eighteen different editions of the scripture being printed in Perso-Arabic script at Lahore, Gujranwala, and Sialkot between the years 1871 and 1895.

Official versions of the Guru Granth Sahib are produced in Amritsar by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). The SGPC printers are the only authorized worldwide publisher of the scripture, states the Sikh religious body Akal Takht. Prior to 2006, Jeewan Singh Chattar Singh &amp; Sons used to print the official versions and were the oldest publisher in Amritsar. However, in 2006, the Akal Takht banned them from printing the Sikh scripture after a sting operation showed that they were printing and mishandling the scripture as well as selling an illegal copy of the Sikh scripture to a Muslim seer. A subsidiary of the SGPC, the Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee, is the authorized printer and supplier of the Guru Granth Sahib to Sikhs outside of India. These facilities are a part of the Gurudwara Rakabganj in New Delhi.

The original Guru Granth Sahib is in the possession of the Sodhi family of Kartarpur village, and is placed at Gurdwara Thum Sahib. The Sodhis are descendants of Guru Arjan Dev and Kartarpur was founded by him in 1598. Since the early 20th century, it has been printed in a standard edition of 1430 Angs. Prior to the late nineteenth century, only handwritten copies were prepared. The first printed copy of the Guru Granth Sahib was made in 1864. Any copies of the Guru Granth Sahib deemed unfit to be read from are cremated, with a ceremony similar to that for cremating a deceased person. Such a cremation is called Agan Bheta. The Guru Granth Sahib is currently printed in an authorized printing press in the basement of the Gurudwara Ramsar in Amritsar; misprints and set-up sheets, and printer&#x27;s waste with any of its sacred text on, are cremated at Goindval.

In September 2023, it was announced by the SGPC that a location in Tracy, California, USA under the purview of the Dharm Prachar Kendra of the Shiromani Committee will begin officially printing copies of the Guru Granth Sahib to cater to the demands of the Sikh diaspora living in North America.

<text>The Navy Board (formerly known as the Council of the Marine or Council of the Marine Causes) was the commission responsible for the day-to-day civil administration of the Royal Navy between 1546 and 1832. The board was headquartered within the Navy Office.

==History==
The origins of the Navy Board can be traced back to the 13th century via the office Keeper of the King&#x27;s Ports and Galleys, later known as the Clerk of the King&#x27;s Ships. The management of the navy expanded with the Keeper of the Storehouses, appointed in 1514, and the Clerk Comptroller in 1522. The Lieutenant of the Admiralty, Treasurer of Marine Causes and Surveyor and Rigger of the Navy were all added in 1544, and a seventh officer, the Master of Naval Ordnance, was added a year later. By January 1545, this group was already working as a body known as the Council of the Marine or &quot;King&#x27;s Majesty&#x27;s Council of His Marine&quot;.

In the first quarter of 1545, an official memorandum proposed the establishment of a new organisation that would formalize a structure for administering the navy with a clear chain of command. The Navy Board was officially appointed to this role by letters patent of Henry VIII on the 24th of April 1546. It was directed by the Lieutenant of the Admiralty until 1557. The board was charged with overseeing the administrative affairs of the navy; directive, executive and operational duties of the Lord High Admiral remained with the Admiralty and Marine Affairs Office.

In 1557 the Lieutenant of the Admiralty ceased to direct the Navy Board, and that role was given to the Treasurer of the Navy, also known as the &quot;Senior Commissioner&quot;. The Navy Board remained independent until 1628, when it became a subsidiary body of the Board of Admiralty now reporting to the First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1660, the Treasurer of the Navy ceased to direct the board and was replaced by the Comptroller, who now held the new joint title of &quot;Chairman of the Board&quot;.

In 1832, following proposals by Sir James Graham to restructure the Naval Service, the Navy Board was abolished (along with its subsidiary boards for Sick and Hurt, Transport, and Victualling). Operational functions were taken over by the Board of Admiralty and administrative functions were dispersed between the Naval Lords.

==Duties and responsibilities==

The Navy Board&#x27;s responsibilities included:

* the construction and maintenance of ships through the Royal Dockyards of Deptford, Woolwich, Portsmouth and Chatham as well as the operations of these dockyards and other naval establishments. 
* the procurement of victuals (obtained from private contractors or &quot;agents&quot;), stores, supplies and services for the fleet and provision of ordnance items (sourced from the Office of Ordnance). 
* civilian and naval pay. 
* the appointment of junior officers and warrant officers.

Individual officials held responsibility as follows:
* The Lieutenant of the Admiralty initially presided over the Council of the Marine (1545–1564) but was later superseded by the treasurer.
* The Treasurer of the Navy was senior commissioner of the board from 1564 to 1660 and controlled and directed all Naval finance – though in practice his responsibilities were later increasingly devolved to the Comptroller.
* The Comptroller of the Navy was in charge of Naval spending and also acted as chairman of the board from 1660 until its abolition in 1832.
* The Surveyor of the Navy was in charge of Naval shipbuilding, ship design and running the Royal Dockyards.
* The Clerk of the Navy was in charge of the day-to-day running of the board and the administration of its work and acted as chief secretary to the Navy Office.
* The Surveyor of Marine Victuals was responsible for the administration of victualling yards and supply of food and beverages for the Royal Navy from 1550 to 1679. This office was abolished and replaced by the Victualling Board in 1683.
* The Master of Naval Ordnance was a specifically assigned officer from the Ordnance Office responsible for the supply of Naval Ordnance and was briefly a member from 1561 to 1569.
* The Comptroller of Storekeepers&#x27;s Accounts, The Comptroller of Treasurer&#x27;s Accounts and The Comptroller of Victualling Accounts were posts created to relieve the Comptroller of the Navy of these duties.

&quot;Note: The Navy Pay Office (domain of the Treasurer of the Navy) was independent of the Board; though the Board&#x27;s Commissioners were required to authorize payments, all funds were held and issued by the Pay Office (which was also known as the Navy Treasury)&quot;.

==Subsidiary boards==
As the size of the fleet grew, the Admiralty sought to focus the activity of the Navy Board on two areas: ships and their maintenance, and naval expenditure. Therefore, from the mid-to-late 17th century, a number of subsidiary boards were established to oversee other aspects of the board&#x27;s work. These included:

* The Victualling Board (1683–1832). Responsible for providing naval personnel with food, drink and supplies.
* The Sick and Hurt Board (established temporarily in times of war from 1653, placed on a permanent footing from 1715, amalgamated into the Transport Board from 1806). Responsible for providing medical support services to the navy and managing prisoners of war.
* The Transport Board (1690–1724, re-established 1794, amalgamated into the Victualling Board in 1817). Responsible for the provision of transport services and for the transportation of supplies and military equipment.

Each of these subsidiary Boards went on to gain a degree of independence, though they remained, nominally at least, overseen by the Navy Board.

==Principal officers and commissioners==

===Tudor and Stuart period===
&quot;List of Principal Officers and Commissioners 1546-1660 included.
* the Lieutenant of the Admiralty, (He presided over the Navy Board from 1546-1564 until he was superseded by the Treasurer. 
* the Treasurer of the Navy originally called &quot;Treasurer of Marine Causes&quot; he was Senior Commissioner of the board from 1564-1660
* the Surveyor of the Navy, originally called &quot;Surveyor and Rigger of the Navy&quot; (1546-1660)
* the Clerk of the Navy, originally called &quot;Clerk of the Kings Ships&quot; (1546-1660)
* the Surveyor of Marine Victuals (1550-1679) (against protocol he was added under monarchs, Elizabeth I, James I and Charles I).
* the Comptroller of the Navy, originally called the &quot;Clerk Comptroller of the Navy&quot; was in charge of Naval spending he also acted as Chairman of the Board from 1660. 
* the Keeper of the Storehouses, also called &quot;Clerk of the Storehouses&quot; he was briefly a member in (1546–1560) his duties were later merged with the treasurers.
* the Master of Naval Ordnance, specifically assigned officer from the Ordnance Board was briefly a member from (1546–1589).
Instrumental in the early administration of the Navy Office were between four and seven &quot;Principal Officers&quot; though some were styled differently prior to 1660. Charles I added a fifth between 1625 and 1640 they included:. 
As defined by a set of drawn up under Henry VIII&#x27;s successor, Edward VI, the Navy Board was given a high degree of autonomy, yet remained subordinate to the Lord High Admiral until 1628. This – at times ambiguous – relationship with The Admiralty was an enduring characteristic of the board, and was one of the reasons behind its eventual demise in 1832.

===Commonwealth and Restoration period===
During the Commonwealth the business of both Navy Board and Admiralty was carried out by a committee of Parliament. Following the Restoration, James, Duke of York (as Lord High Admiral) oversaw the reconstitution of the Navy Board. Alongside the aforementioned &quot;Principal Officers&quot; further officials were appointed to serve as &quot;Commissioners&quot; of the Navy, and together these constituted the board. By tradition, commissioners were always Navy officers of the rank of post-captain or captain who had retired from active service at sea.

&quot;List of Principal Officers and Commissioners 1660-1796 included.&quot;
* Comptroller of the Navy (chaired meetings of the board and liaised with the First Lord of the Admiralty)
* Surveyor of the Navy
* Treasurer of the Navy
* Clerk of the Acts of the Navy
&quot;Additional Commissioners added after 1666, who were soon given specific duties (so as to lessen the administrative burden placed on the Controller.&quot;
* Controller of Treasurer Accounts, (1667–1796)
* Controller of Victualling Accounts, (1667–1796)
* Controller of Storekeepers Accounts, (1671–1796)
* Commissioners for Old Accounts, (1686–1688)
* Commissioners for Current Business, (1686–1688)
* Commissioners for Examining Accounts (Incurred), (1688–1689)
* Deputy Comptroller of the Navy, (1793–1813)

===Hanoverian period===
In 1796 the board was reconstituted: the post of Clerk of the Acts was abolished, as were the three controllers of accounts. Henceforward, the board would consist of the controller and a deputy controller (both of whom were normally commissioned officers), the surveyor (usually a master shipwright from one of the dockyards) and around seven other commissioners (a mixture of officers and civilians) to whom no specific duties were attached.

The treasurer, though still technically a member of the board, was (like the dockyard commissioners) seldom in attendance. In fact the post of treasurer was by this stage little more than a sinecure; the main work of his department was carried out by its senior clerk, the Paymaster of the Navy.

Following the abolition of the office of Clerk of the Acts, the post of secretary to the board was created; as well as overseeing the administrative department, the secretary attended meetings of the board and took minutes; but he was not himself a commissioner and did not therefore have a vote.

&quot;List of Principal Officers and Commissioners 1796-1832 included:&quot;
* Comptroller of the Navy
* Surveyor of the Navy
* Treasurer of the Navy
* Deputy Surveyor of the Navy
* Pay Commissioner, (1796–1814).
* Inspector-General of Naval Works, (1807–1808), &quot;from 1796 to 1807 post holder reported to the Board of Admiralty&quot;
* Civil Architect and Engineer of the Navy, (1808–1812)
* Surveyor of Buildings, (1812–1832)
* Surveyor of Dockyards, (1813–1832).
* Accountant-General of the Navy, (1829–32)
* Storekeeper General of the Navy, (1829–32)
* Deputy Comptroller of the Navy, (1829–1832)
* Superintendent of Transport, (1829–1831)

===Commissioners of the Navy===
To all of these lists must be added the Commissioners of the Navy with oversight of the Royal Navy Dockyards. Normally resident at their respective dockyards and thus known as resident commissioners, these commissioners did not normally attend the board&#x27;s meetings in London; nevertheless, they were considered full members of the Navy Board and carried the full authority of the board when implementing or making decisions within their respective yards both at home and overseas. Not every Dockyard had a resident commissioner in charge, but the larger Yards, both at home and overseas, generally did (with the exception of the nearby Thames-side yards of Deptford and Woolwich, which were for the most part overseen directly by the board in London, although Woolwich did have a Resident Commissioner for some years). Chatham Dockyard, Devonport Dockyard, Portsmouth Dockyard, Sheerness Dockyard, Trincomalee Dockyard and the Bermuda Dockyard all had Resident Commissioners.

After the abolition of the board in 1832 the duties of these commissioners were taken over by commissioned officers: usually an admiral-superintendent at the largest yards, or a captain-superintendent at smaller yards.

==Headquarters==


From the 1650s the board, together with its staff of around 60 clerks, was accommodated in a large house at the corner of Crutched Friars and Seething Lane, just north of the Tower of London. Following a fire, the house was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren. This new Navy Office provided accommodation for the commissioners, as well as office space. Different departments were accommodated in different parts of the building; the rear wing (which had its own entrance on Tower Hill) housed the offices of the Sick and Hurt Board. The Victualling Office was also located nearby, on Little Tower Hill, close to its early manufacturing base at Eastminster. The Navy Treasury, where the treasurer was based, was located from 1664 in Broad Street (having moved there from Leadenhall Street). It was also known as the Navy Pay Office. In 1789, all these offices were relocated into the new purpose-built office complex of Somerset House.

==Demise==
By the early nineteenth century, members of Parliament had begun raising concerns at the cost of Navy Board operations and the obscurity of its record-keeping. On 15 February 1828 Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, established a Parliamentary Committee to review the board&#x27;s operations. The committee, chaired by Irish MP Henry Parnell, was specifically charged with interpreting and reducing Navy Board costs. By the end of the year it had issued critical reports covering the board&#x27;s administration of naval pensions, half-pay, revenue, expenditure and debt. In particular, the committee noted the Navy Board had long since abandoned financial controls; that it had instead &quot;established a scale of expense greatly beyond what existed during former periods of peace,&quot; and that its operations tended to &quot;exalt its own importance&quot; over the needs of the public service as a whole.

The board&#x27;s internal operations were also found wanting:
The Government&#x27;s response was delivered on 14 February 1832, with a Bill to abolish both the Navy Board and the Victualling Board and merge their functions into the Board of Admiralty. This Bill was moved by Sir James Graham as First Lord of the Admiralty, who argued that the Boards had been &quot;constituted at a period when the principles of banking were unknown,&quot; and were redundant in an era of greater Parliamentary oversight and regulation. An amendment proposed by First Sea Lord Sir George Cockburn suggested that Navy Board be preserved and only the Victualling Board abolished, but this was defeated by 118 votes to 50. The Bill itself was passed on 23 May 1832, with the Navy Board formally ceasing operations from 1 June.

<text> is a nearly spherical sub-kilometer asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object of the Apollo group. It measures approximately in diameter and is a fast rotator, having a rotational period of only 10.7 minutes. It was first observed on 2 June 1998, by the Spacewatch survey at Kitt Peak National Observatory during 6 days during which it passed 800,000 kilometers (half a million miles) away from Earth (a little more than twice the Earth–Moon distance).

The object&#x27;s orbit is well known, since it was recovered in 2002 by the Hawaiian Observatory, and it was most recently observed, from 10 till 15 December 2020, by the Cerro Paranal. La Palma Observatory, and Mauna Kea observatories.

== Orbit and classification ==

 orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0–1.5 AU once every 16 months (500 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 1° with respect to the ecliptic. It has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of approximately , corresponding to 0.98 lunar distances.

As a result, it is one of the most easily accessible objects in the Solar System, and its orbit frequently brings it on a path very similar to the optimum Earth–Mars transfer orbit. This, coupled with its high water content, makes it an attractive target for further study and a potential source of water for future missions to Mars.

== Physical properties ==

The physical properties of this object were measured by an international team of astronomers led by Dr. Steven J. Ostro of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory using a radar telescope in California and optical telescopes in the Czech Republic, Hawaii, Arizona and California.

 is characterized as a potentially metallic X-type asteroid. Optical and radar observations indicate that it is a water-rich object.

From light curve photometry in 1998, the object is measured to have a rotation period of only 10.7 minutes, which was considered to be one of the shortest sidereal days of any known Solar System object at the time; most asteroids with established rotational rates have periods measured in hours. As a result, it cannot possibly be a rubble pile, as many asteroids are thought to be, and must instead be a monolithic object. It was the first such object to be discovered, but since 1998, several other small asteroids have been found to also have short rotation periods, some even faster than .

== Exploration ==

In September 2020, a mission extension for JAXA&#x27;s &quot;Hayabusa2&quot; asteroid sample return probe was selected to do additional flybys of two near-Earth asteroids: 98943 Torifune in July 2026 and a rendezvous with in July 2031. The rendezvous with will be the first visit of a rapidly rotating micro-asteroid. This will also make 1998 KY26 the smallest object to ever be studied by a spacecraft.

<text>Ann Sothern (born Harriette Arlene Lake; January 22, 1909 – March 15, 2001) was an American actress who worked on stage, radio, film, and television, in a career that spanned nearly six decades. Sothern began her career in the late 1920s in bit parts in films. In 1930, she made her Broadway stage debut and soon worked her way up to starring roles. In 1939, MGM cast her as Maisie Ravier, a brash yet lovable Brooklyn showgirl. The character proved to be popular and spawned a successful film series (&quot;Congo Maisie&quot;, &quot;Gold Rush Maisie&quot;, &quot;Up Goes Maisie&quot;, etc.) and a network radio series (&quot;The Adventures of Maisie&quot;).

In 1953, Sothern moved into television as the star of her own sitcom, &quot;Private Secretary&quot;. The series aired for five seasons on CBS and earned Sothern three Primetime Emmy Award nominations. In 1958 she starred in another sitcom for CBS, &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot;, which aired for three seasons. From 1965 to 1966, Sothern provided the voice of Gladys Crabtree, the title character in the sitcom &quot;My Mother the Car&quot;. She continued her career throughout the late 1960s with stage and film appearances and guest-starring roles on television. Due to health issues she worked sporadically during the 1970s and 1980s.

In 1987, Sothern appeared in her final film, &quot;The Whales of August&quot;, starring Bette Davis and Lillian Gish. Sothern earned her only Oscar nomination, for Best Supporting Actress, for her role in the film. After filming concluded, she retired to Ketchum, Idaho, where she spent her remaining years before her death from heart failure in March 2001. Lucille Ball, alongside whom she appeared on Ball&#x27;s program &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; on multiple occasions, called Sothern &quot;the best comedienne in the business, bar none.&quot;

== Early life ==
Sothern was born in Valley City, North Dakota, the oldest of three daughters born to Walter J. Lake and Annette Yde. She had two younger sisters, Marion and Bonnie. Her maternal grandfather was Danish violinist Hans Nielsen.

Her mother was a concert singer, while Sothern&#x27;s father worked in importing and exporting. Harriette and her sisters were raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her parents separated when she was four years old (they would later divorce in 1927). At the age of five, she began taking piano lessons. She later studied at McPhail School of Music, where her mother taught piano. She began accompanying her mother on her concert tours when her school schedule permitted.

By age 11, she had become an accomplished pianist and was singing solos in her church choir. At age 14, she began voice lessons and continued to study piano and music composition. As a teen at Minneapolis Central High School, she appeared in numerous stage productions and directed several shows.

During her high school years, she entered the annual state-sponsored contests for student musical composers and won three years in a row. In 1926, she graduated from high school.

Her mother moved to Los Angeles, where she worked as a vocal coach for Warner Bros. studios. Sothern moved with her father to Seattle, where she attended the University of Washington, dropping out after one year.

== Career ==

=== Early years ===
While visiting her mother in California, she won a role in the Warner Bros. revue &quot;The Show of Shows&quot;. She did a screen test for MGM and signed a six-month contract. She appeared in bit parts and walk-on roles, but soon grew frustrated with only appearing in small roles. She then met Florenz Ziegfeld at a party. Ziegfeld offered her a role in one of his productions. When MGM decided not to pick up her option, she moved to New York City to take Ziegfeld up on his offer.

On Broadway in 1931, she had leading roles in &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Welcome&quot;.

=== Film and radio ===
In 1934, she signed a contract with Columbia Pictures. Harry Cohn changed her name to Ann Sothern. &quot;Ann&quot; was chosen in honor of her mother and &quot;Sothern&quot; was chosen for Shakespearean actor E. H. Sothern. While at Columbia she mainly appeared in B-movie roles. After two years, the studio released her from her contract. In 1936, she was signed by RKO Radio Pictures and, after a string of films that failed to attract a large enough audience, she left RKO. She signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer shortly after leaving RKO.

After signing with MGM, Sothern was cast as brassy Brooklyn burlesque dancer Mary Anastasia O&#x27;Connor, known professionally as Maisie Ravier, in &quot;Maisie&quot; (1939). MGM originally acquired the &quot;Maisie&quot; property for Jean Harlow, but Harlow died in June 1937, before a final script was completed. (The Harlow inspiration remained; the second Maisie feature, &quot;Congo Maisie&quot;, was based on MGM&#x27;s &quot;Red Dust&quot;. Sothern approximated the Jean Harlow role opposite John Carroll in the Clark Gable role.)

After years of struggling and appearing in supporting parts Sothern found major success with &quot;Maisie&quot;. The film was profitable for MGM, as were the string of &quot;Maisie&quot; comedy sequels that followed. Box office proceeds from &quot;Maisie&quot; pictures financed MGM&#x27;s more costly dramas. From 1939 to 1947, she appeared in 10 &quot;Maisie&quot; films. A review of &quot;Swing Shift Maisie&quot; (1943) by &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised Sothern and described her as &quot;one of the smartest comediennes in the business&quot;. The popularity of the film series led to her own radio program, &quot;The Adventures of Maisie&quot;, broadcast on CBS from 1945 to 1947, on Mutual Broadcasting System in 1952, and in syndication from 1949 to 1953. Due to her popularity from the &quot;Maisie&quot; films MGM head Louis B. Mayer paid $80,000 to purchase film rights to the Broadway production of &quot;DuBarry Was a Lady&quot; especially for Sothern. When Sothern rejected the revised script MGM decided to cast Lucille Ball (Sothern&#x27;s best friend in real life). Shortly after completing filming of &quot;Maisie Gets Her Man&quot; in 1942 Sothern was cast in title role in the film version of &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; (1942), opposite Red Skelton. &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; had been a hit on Broadway with Ethel Merman in the title role, but was plagued with production problems after MGM attempted to shoot the film version. After a disastrous preview in November 1941, MGM decided to delay release to retool the production. The film&#x27;s original director was replaced, the script was rewritten, and several scenes were reshot. While the film received mediocre to poor reviews, it was a smash box office hit with audiences.

In 1943, she appeared in a seventh Maisie film &quot;Swing Shift Maisie&quot; followed by a role in the war drama &quot;Cry &#x27;Havoc&#x27;&quot;. The following year Sothern starred in the eighth Maisie film, &quot;Maisie Goes to Reno&quot;, before taking time off to have her first child. She returned to the screen in 1946 in &quot;Up Goes Maisie&quot;, followed by the final Maisie film &quot;Undercover Maisie&quot;. Sothern appeared in two musical films in 1948, &quot;April Showers&quot; opposite Jack Carson and &quot;Words and Music&quot; starring an all-star cast of MGM actors, singers and dancers. In 1949, she appeared in the Academy Award-winning film &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; for 20th Century Fox. Sothern received excellent reviews for her performance but the acclaim failed to stimulate her career, which had begun to wane in the late 1940s. In 1949, Sothern contracted hepatitis, which she would battle for the next three years. After Sothern became ill, MGM canceled her contract.

=== Television ===
By the early 1950s, Sothern was appearing only in supporting roles, in such films as the film noir crime drama &quot;The Blue Gardenia&quot; (1953). In need of money due to her mounting medical bills she turned to television. In 1953, she was cast as the lead in the series &quot;Private Secretary&quot;. Sothern portrayed Susan Camille &quot;Susie&quot; MacNamara, a secretary working for New York City talent agent Peter Sands (Don Porter). The series aired on CBS on alternate weeks with &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;. &quot;Private Secretary&quot; was a hit with audiences, routinely placing in the top 10, and Sothern was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for her role on the series three times. In 1957, &quot;Private Secretary&quot; was renewed for a fifth season, but Sothern left the series after she had what she later described as a &quot;violent fight&quot; with producer Jack Chertok over profits from the series. Sothern owned 42% of the show and later sued Chertok for $93,000 in back profits from the series.

She returned to television the following year in &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot;. Sothern starred as Kathleen &quot;Katy&quot; O&#x27;Connor, the assistant manager at the fictitious Bartley House Hotel. The series originally co-starred Ernest Truex as Katy&#x27;s timid boss Jason Macauley, who was routinely outshone by Katy, and bullied by his domineering wife Flora (Reta Shaw). Ratings for the series were weak, and after 23 episodes the show was retooled. Sothern&#x27;s co-star from &quot;Private Secretary&quot;, Don Porter, signed on as Katy&#x27;s boss James Devery. The addition of Porter added romantic tension to the series and helped to improve ratings. In 1959, the series won a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy. During the series&#x27; second season, Jesse White, who also starred in &quot;Private Secretary&quot;, joined the cast. Ratings for the series remained solid until CBS moved &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot; to Thursdays for its third season. Scheduled opposite the ABC series &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, ratings dropped substantially and &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot; was canceled in 1961.

=== Later years ===
After &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot; ended, she returned to films in the political drama &quot;The Best Man&quot; (1964), opposite Henry Fonda and Cliff Robertson. She was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Golden Globe for her work in the film. That same year, she portrayed a prostitute in the psychological thriller &quot;Lady in a Cage&quot;, starring Olivia de Havilland. In 1965, she had a recurring role on her friend Lucille Ball&#x27;s &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; as the &quot;Countess Framboise&quot; (née Rosie Harrigan). After Ball&#x27;s long-time co-star Vivian Vance announced plans to leave the show, the press speculated that Sothern would be Vance&#x27;s replacement. Sothern denied the rumors and, ultimately, the series continued without Vance or Sothern.

In 1965, Sothern co-starred in the TV comedy series &quot;My Mother the Car&quot;, opposite Jerry Van Dyke. Van Dyke played a struggling lawyer and family man who discovers a dilapidated, vintage 1928 automobile in a used-car lot. The antique auto speaks to him — in Ann Sothern&#x27;s voice. It seems the car is the reincarnation of Van Dyke&#x27;s mother. Van Dyke restores the car to its original condition and takes it home, where it bemuses his family and becomes the envy of a zealous collector. Sothern was never seen in the series; only her voice was heard, reacting tartly to zany happenings around her.

She continued the rest of the 1960s working in guest roles in television and the occasional film role. In an &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; episode, entitled &quot;Water&#x27;s Edge&quot;, Sothern turned in a most impressive performance. In 1972, Sothern appeared in the Sid and Marty Krofft television special &quot;Fol-de-Rol&quot;. The next year, she played the domineering mother of a homicidal son in psychological horror film &quot;The Killing Kind&quot;. In 1974, she traveled to Hong Kong to shoot the martial arts film &quot;Golden Needles&quot;. She played the role of Fenzie, a mahjong parlor owner. Sothern&#x27;s next role was in the 1975 action comedy film &quot;Crazy Mama&quot; starring Cloris Leachman. For the rest of the decade, health problems forced her to cut back on her career. She worked sporadically in television and in stage productions, including a small role in the horror film &quot;The Manitou&quot; with Tony Curtis (1978).

Sothern returned to television in 1985 in the role of &quot;Ma Finney&quot; in an adaptation of one of her old films, &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot;. Sothern&#x27;s final film was &quot;The Whales of August&quot; in 1987. Her role as the neighbor of elderly sisters, played by Lillian Gish and Bette Davis, earned her the only Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination of her career. After filming, Sothern retired from acting and moved to Ketchum, Idaho, where she spent her remaining years.

=== Other ventures ===
Over the course of her career, Sothern also managed several businesses and production companies. In the 1950s, she opened the Ann Sothern Sewing Center in Sun Valley, Idaho, which sold fabric, patterns, and sewing machines. She also owned a cattle ranch in Idaho named the A Bar S Cattle Company. Sothern owned Vincent Productions, Inc. (named for Sothern&#x27;s patron saint Vincent de Paul) which produced her first series &quot;Private Secretary&quot;, and Anso Productions which produced &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot;.

In addition to acting, Sothern pursued a musical career. During her hiatus from &quot;Private Secretary&quot; in 1954, she starred in her own nightclub act featured in clubs in Reno, Las Vegas, and Chicago. In the late 1950s, she formed the A Bar S Music Company and released &quot;Sothern Exposure&quot;, her first album in 1958.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages and child ===

Sothern married actor and band leader Roger Pryor in September 1936. They separated in September 1941 and Sothern filed for divorce in April 1942, charging Pryor with mental cruelty. Their divorce became final in May 1943. Less than a week after her divorce from Pryor she married actor Robert Sterling. The couple had one daughter, Patricia Ann &quot;Tisha&quot; Sterling, before divorcing in March 1949.

=== Health problems ===
Shortly after filming &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; Sothern contracted infectious hepatitis after getting an impure serum shot while she was in England for a stage performance. She was confined to her bed where she continued to work on the &quot;Maisie&quot; radio program while she recuperated. Sothern later said that her illness had restored her faith. With the help of friend Richard Egan she converted to Roman Catholicism in 1952.

In 1974 Sothern was injured while appearing in a Jacksonville, Florida, stock production of &quot;Everybody Loves Opal&quot; when a prop tree fell on her back. The accident left her with a fractured lumbar vertebra and damaged nerves in her legs. Her injuries required hospitalizations where she was put in traction. She was also required to wear back braces. Due to her forced inactivity Sothern gained a considerable amount of weight. In addition to her physical pain Sothern also developed depression. Sothern credited her &quot;optimistic belief&quot; and Roman Catholic faith for getting her through. For the remainder of her life Sothern experienced numbness in her feet and required a cane to walk.

== Death ==
On March 15, 2001, Sothern died from heart failure at her home in Ketchum at the age of 92. She was buried in Ketchum Cemetery.

Sothern has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: for motion pictures, found at 1612 Vine Street; and television, at 1634 Vine Street.

<text>Stuyvesant Fish (June 24, 1851 – April 10, 1923) was an American businessman and member of the Fish family who served as president of the Illinois Central Railroad. He owned grand residences in New York City and Newport, Rhode Island, entertained lavishly and, along with his wife &quot;Mamie&quot;, became prominent in American high society during the Gilded Age.

==Early life and ancestry==
Stuyvesant Fish was born on June 24, 1851, in New York City. He was the third son of Hamilton Fish (1808–1893), the 16th Governor of New York, a United States senator and United States Secretary of State who is recognized as the &quot;pillar&quot; of the Grant Administration and considered one of the best U.S. Secretaries of State by scholars. His mother was Julia Ursin Niemcewicz Kean (1816–1887), a descendant of New Jersey governor William Livingston. His parents&#x27; marriage has been described as a happy one, and his mother was known for her &quot;sagacity and judgement&quot;. His father was named after his grandfather&#x27;s friend, Alexander Hamilton. Fish had two older brothers, Nicholas Fish II (1846–1902) and Hamilton Fish II (1849–1936), and five sisters, Sarah Morris Fish (1838–1925), Julia Kean Fish (1841–1908), Susan LeRoy Fish (1844–1909), and Edith Livingston Fish (1856–1887).

His paternal grandparents were Nicholas Fish (1758–1833) and Elizabeth Stuyvesant (a great-great-granddaughter of Peter Stuyvesant). Nicholas Fish was a leading Federalist politician and notable figure of the American Revolutionary War who was active in the Yorktown Campaign that resulted in the surrender of Lord Cornwallis. Peter Stuyvesant was a prominent founder of New York, then a Dutch Colony, and his family owned much property in Manhattan.

Fish graduated from Columbia College in Manhattan where he was a member of St. Anthony Hall.

==Career==
Fish was an executive of the Illinois Central Railroad. He served as its president from 1887 to 1906, overseeing its period of greatest expansion. He also served on the board of directors of the National Park Bank.

In 1906, Fish was removed from his position at the Illinois Central by E. H. Harriman, possibly because of Fish&#x27;s cooperation and participation with the state government in investigating the Mutual Life Insurance Company. However, it is also possible that the reason was because his wife, Mamie, had snubbed Harriman&#x27;s wife, Mary, from a society tea party. Mamie found Mary too &quot;dull&quot; and so snubbed her from a tea party at their home in Newport, Rhode Island, where they spent the summer season.

His wife, Marion, known as &quot;Mamie&quot;, was a leader in New York and Newport society. When in Newport, they lived in a grand Colonial Revival house named &quot;Crossways&quot;, where her annual Harvest Festival Ball in August signaled the end of the Newport social season.

When Grand Duke Boris of Russia visited Newport, Mrs. Fish issued invitations for a dinner and ball in his honor; the night of the ball the Duke was detained by Mary Wilson Goelet, a.k.a. Mrs. Ogden Goelet, Mrs. Fish&#x27;s rival as social leader, at whose home he was staying. About 200 guests had assembled in the hall at Crossways, and when the hour for dinner approached and there was no sign of the Duke, Mrs. Fish announced that the Duke was unable to come, but the Czar of Russia had agreed to be her guest. Suddenly the doors of the room were flung open and in walked His Imperial Majesty, dressed in his royal robes, wearing the Imperial Crown and carrying a scepter. The guests, including Senator Chauncey Depew, Pierpont Morgan, and Lord Charles Beresford, sank in a court curtsy, only to recover themselves with shrieks of laughter when they realized they were paying homage to Harry Lehr.

Fish had no great interest in the doings of high society, and he bore great patience with his wife&#x27;s peculiar parties.

==Personal life==
On June 1, 1876, he married Marion Graves Anthon (1853–1915), the daughter of Sarah Attwood Meert and Gen. William Henry Anthon (1827–1875), a successful lawyer and Staten Island assemblyman. Her paternal grandfather was John Anthon (1784–1863). Together, they had four children, three of whom lived to adulthood:

* Livingston Fish (1879–1880), who died at six months.
* Marian Anthon Fish (1880–1944), who married Albert Zabriskie Gray (1881–1964), the son of the Judge John Clinton Gray, on June 12, 1907. They divorced on December 5, 1934.
* Stuyvesant Fish, Jr. (1883–1952), who married Isabelle Mildred Dick (1884–1972), daughter of Evans Rogers Dick, in 1910.
* Sidney Webster Fish (1885–1950), who married Olga Martha Wiborg (1890–1937), daughter of Frank Bestow Wiborg, in 1915. In 1939, he married Esther Foss, the daughter of Gov. Eugene Noble Foss. She had previously been married to George Gordon Moore, a polo player whom she divorced in 1933, and Aiden Roark, another polo player whom she married in 1934 and divorced in 1937.

Stuyvesant Fish was a vestryman at Trinity Church, New York, and a member of the Republican Party.

Fish died on April 10, 1923, in New York.

===Residences===

From 1887 to 1898, Fish and his family lived at 19 Gramercy Park South, a brick row house located at the corner of Gramercy Park South (East 20th Street) and Irving Place in the Gramercy neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.

Fish and his wife also maintained his grandmother&#x27;s Federal-style house at 21 Stuyvesant Street, but after 1898, their New York residence was a brick and limestone Italianate mansion at 25 East 78th Street, at the corner of Madison Avenue. The house, which was designed by architect Stanford White, is now the headquarters of Bloomberg Philanthropies.

The Fish family built a grand Colonial Revival home named &quot;Crossways&quot; in Newport, Rhode Island, where they entertained during the summer social season. It was designed by Dudley Newton. Fish also had an estate named &quot;Glenclyffe&quot; in Philipstown, New York, which had belonged to his father.

<text>USS &quot;Mitscher&quot; (DL-2/DDG-35), named for Admiral Marc &quot;Pete&quot; Mitscher USN (1887–1947), was the lead ship of her class of destroyer leaders of the United States Navy. Commissioned in 1953, she was later converted to a guided missile destroyer, and served until 1978. She was sold for scrap in 1980.

==Construction and commissioning==
Originally designated DD-927, she was laid down by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath, Maine on 3 October 1949, reclassified as a destroyer leader and designated DL-2 on 2 February 1951, launched on 26 January 1952 by Mrs. Marc A. Mitscher, widow of Admiral Mitscher and commissioned on 15 May 1953.

==Service==
&quot;Mitscher&quot; was initially homeported in Newport, R.I., and became the operational flagship for Commander Destroyer Flotilla Two. After initial shakedown exercises off Cuba, &quot;Mitscher&quot; returned to Boston for further modification, followed by another shakedown cruise to Guantanamo Bay, ending 31 August 1954. Homeported thereafter at Newport, R.I., she conducted exercises off the east coast until 3 January 1956, when she sailed on a good-will cruise to England, Germany, and France, returning to Rhode Island 10 February. For the next 5 years, she continued her east coast operations, deploying annually either to the northern or eastern Atlantic for NATO exercises.

In 1955, &quot;Mitscher&quot; cruised the Caribbean with Commander Destroyer Force, US Atlantic Fleet, embarked. In 1958, President Eisenhower broke his personal flag in &quot;Mitscher&quot; during the America&#x27;s Cup Challenge Races off Newport. &quot;Mitscher&quot; journeyed to South America on a four-month cruise in 1959, and subsequently cruised to Northern Europe for extended NATO Exercises.

In November 1960, the ship&#x27;s homeport was shifted to Naval Station Charleston, SC, where she became the operational flagship of Commander Destroyer Flotilla Six. On 9 February 1961, she departed her new homeport, and steamed to the Mediterranean for her first 6-month tour with the U.S. 6th Fleet. Early in 1961, &quot;Mitscher&quot; deployed with the Sixth Fleet. During this cruise, &quot;Mitscher&quot; was flagship for Admiral Anderson, Commander Sixth Fleet. The ship was again transferred to Newport, Rhode Island, in 1962, where she again became the flagship of Commander Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla Two. Such deployments over the next 4 years involved her in further NATO exercises as well as 6th Fleet exercises. Spring 1964, departed Newport, Rhode Island, for 6-month tour with 6th Fleet. In August 1964, while in the Mediterranean, she stood off Cyprus to aid in the evacuation of American nationals, and then steamed through the Suez Canal to patrol the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Returned to Mediterranean for 4-month tour with U.S. 6th Fleet in 1965, returned to Newport, Rhode Island, December 1965.

On 2 March 1966, &quot;Mitscher&quot; departed Newport for the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. There, she was converted to a guided missile destroyer at between 18 March 1966 and 29 June 1968 and designated DDG-35. In late August 1970, &quot;Mitscher&quot; departed Norfolk for Mediterranean operations with COMDESRON One Four aboard. Her next deployment was in July 1971 as a member of Destroyer Squadron Twenty-Six, the &quot;Mod Squad&quot;. &quot;Mitscher&quot; entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in March 1972 for overhaul.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Mitscher&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1978, and sold for scrap in July 1980.

<text>USS &quot;John S. McCain&quot; (DL-3/DDG-36) was the second Mitscher-class destroyer leader in the United States Navy. Commissioned in 1953, she was later converted into a guided missile destroyer and served until 1978. She was sold for scrap in 1979.

==Construction and commissioning==
The ship was launched by Bath Iron Works Corporation, Bath, Maine, on 12 July 1952. Originally designated DD-928 she was reclassified in 1951 as a destroyer leader. She was sponsored by Roberta McCain, the daughter-in-law of Admiral John S. McCain, Sr. (born 1884), and commissioned on 12 October 1953 at the Boston Naval Shipyard.

==History==
USS &quot;John S. McCain&quot; spent her first year of commissioned service undergoing sea trials and shakedown training in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. One of the of large and fast destroyer leaders, she carried the new guided-missile armament, and she embodied new ideas in hull design and construction. This warship arrived at Norfolk on 19 May 1955 to begin service with the Operational Development Force in testing new equipment and tactics. She operated out of Norfolk until 5 November 1956, when she steamed from Hampton Roads bound for the Panama Canal and San Diego, California. After her arrival on 4 December 1956, she spent five months on maneuvers in the Pacific Ocean off California.

The destroyer sailed for her first Far East cruise on 11 April 1957, and after a visit to Australia, she joined the Formosa (now called Taiwan) Patrol, helping to deter a military clash between Nationalist and Communist Chinese forces. She returned from this important duty to San Diego on 29 September 1957.

&quot;John S. McCain&quot; steamed to her new homeport, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in early 1958, and she took part in fleet maneuvers and antisubmarine training for the next eight months. In early September the ship deployed to the Formosa-South China Sea area to help the Seventh Fleet deter a possible Communist invasion of Quemoy and Matsu Islands. She remained in this region until returning to Pearl Harbor on 1 March 1959.

This warship made her third deployment to the Far East in the fall of 1959, departing on 8 September 1957 and moving directly to the coast of Southeast Asia. During October she was off Calcutta, India, carrying medicines and donating food and money to flood victims. In January 1960, this versatile ship rescued the entire 41-man crew of Japanese freighter &quot;Shinwa Maru&quot; during a storm in the South China Sea. Returning to Pearl Harbor on 25 February, she began a well-earned period of overhaul and shipboard training.

&quot;John S. McCain&quot; departed on 7 March 1961 for another deployment with Seventh Fleet, spending six months off Laos and Vietnam. She resumed operations in Hawaiian waters after her return to Pearl Harbor on 25 September With the resumption of atmospheric nuclear testing by the Soviet Union some months later, the United States went ahead with plans for her own series of Pacific tests, and &quot;John S. McCain&quot; steamed to Johnston Island on 27 April 1962 to take part in the experiments. For the next six months she operated between Hawaii and Johnston Island, departing for her next cruise to the Far East on 28 November 1962. There she returned to patrol duties in the South China Sea and Gulf of Tonkin, aiding the South Vietnamese government in its fight against the Viet Cong. She also took part in Formosa Patrol in the Straits before returning to Pearl Harbor on 16 June 1963. Antisubmarine warfare exercises followed, and the ship got underway again on 23 March 1964 for operations with a hunter-killer group in Japanese and Philippine waters. During this cruise she took part in exercises with ships from other SEATO nations as well as units of the 7th Fleet. &quot;John S. McCain&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 11 August. She operated in Hawaiian waters until the spring of 1965. The destroyer returned to Pearl Harbor, and then sailed on a six-month deployment in the western Pacific. In the fall, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; steamed off South Vietnam. On 24 November 1965 she shelled Viet Cong positions. Two days later she sailed to Hong Kong and ended the year in Japan. After further operations in the Far East early in 1966, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; returned to the East Coast of the United States.

On 24 June 1966, &quot;John S. McCain&quot; was decommissioned and entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for conversion to a guided missile destroyer. She was recommissioned on 6 September 1969 and redesignated DDG-36.

==Fate==
USS &quot;John S. McCain&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 29–30 April 1978, and sold for scrap on 13 December 1979. Her entire class of guided missile destroyers was rather abruptly retired from service because of technical problems with their steam power plants.

<text>USS &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; (DD-929) was a &quot;Mitscher&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy. She was named for Vice Admiral Willis A. &quot;Ching&quot; Lee USN (1888–1945).

&quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; was laid down by the Shipbuilding Division of the Bethlehem Steel Company at Quincy in Massachusetts on 1 November 1949, reclassified as a destroyer leader and designated DL-4 on 9 February 1951, launched on 26 January 1952 by Mrs. Fitzhugh L. Palmer, Jr., niece of Vice Admiral Lee and commissioned at the Boston Naval Shipyard on 5 October 1954.

&quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; participated in quarantine operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; was decommissioned on 19 December 1969, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 May 1972 and sold for scrap to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation of New York City on 18 May 1973.

==History==
Following her shakedown at Guantánamo Bay, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; returned to her homeport, Newport, R.I., and began a career of operations with the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. She was deployed to the Mediterranean for the first time in July 1955, cruising with the 6th Fleet—the first ship of her type to operate with that force. Upon the conclusion of her first tour with the 6th Fleet later that year, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; returned to the east coast and operated off the eastern seaboard in air defense exercises.

In February 1956, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; — reclassified as a frigate in 1955 — sailed southward to the Dominican Republic, where she represented the United States in American Day festivities at Ciudad Trujillo, the capital city of that West Indian nation. She was driven onto rocks at Jamestown, Rhode Island, in a storm on 18 March 1956. The frigate then spent considerable time at the Boston Naval Shipyard on Boston, Massachusetts, before resuming active operations. In November 1956, while participating in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; assisted the distressed fishing vessel, &quot;Agda&quot;, off Montauk Point, Long Island, fighting and extinguishing a blazing oil fire and thus saving several lives.

In February 1957, the ship carried King Ibn Saud, of Saudi Arabia, to New York City during his official visit to the United States. Later that month, she sailed to Washington, D.C., to participate in ceremonies honoring the birthday of George Washington. That spring, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; played &quot;movie star&quot;, when she was filmed by the Louis de Rochemont studios for a part in the cinerama production, &quot;Windjammer&quot;, while she operated on ASW exercises in the North Atlantic. She subsequently participated in the International Naval Review held that summer at Hampton Roads, Virginia, before becoming part of a large combined NATO fleet that conducted intensive ASW and air defense exercises in the North Atlantic that autumn. During those maneuvers, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; crossed the Arctic Circle for the first time on 20 September.
Over the next two years, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; was twice deployed to the Mediterranean for operations with the 6th Fleet, separating those tours with local operations out of Newport and in the Caribbean and off the coast of Florida, primarily on ASW and air defense exercises. In the summer of 1959, she participated in Operation &quot;Inland Sea&quot; as flagship for Rear Admiral E. B. Taylor, Commander, Task Force 47, on a cruise on the Great Lakes. During that historic voyage, she transited the newly opened St. Lawrence Seaway and visited the ports of Chicago, Illinois; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Detroit, Michigan; Erie, Pennsylvania; and Cleveland, Ohio. That autumn, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; returned to her schedule of maneuvers and exercises in the North Atlantic.

&quot;Willis A. Lee&quot;, with Commander, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, embarked, conducted an inspection cruise — commencing in February 1960 — of Atlantic Fleet ports and installations that took the ship to San Juan, Puerto Rico; St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; and Ciudad Trujillo. Upon the conclusion of that cruise, the warship took part in Operation &quot;Springboard&quot;, an annual exercise in the Caribbean.

In the summer of 1960, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; conducted a midshipmen&#x27;s training cruise while participating in more fleet exercises. She subsequently visited Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and New York City before she took part in various refueling-at-sea and replenishment exercises as part of LANTFLEX (Atlantic Fleet Exercise) 2-60.

After a brief trip to Charleston, S.C., in August, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; participated in Operation &quot;Sword Thrust,&quot; a NATO fleet exercise in the North Atlantic which combined the efforts of more than 60 British, French, Norwegian, Canadian, and American warships. While carrying out simulated attacks on the European continent during the course of the maneuvers, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; again crossed the Arctic Circle. After calling at Le Havre, France, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; returned to Newport. In November, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for an extensive overhaul, part of the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program.

During her FRAM overhaul, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; was altered significantly to enable her to perform her designed role more efficiently. When she finally left the yard almost a year later, she displayed a distinctly altered silhouette. She then had a helicopter hangar in place of the after 3-inch twin gun mount to accommodate the Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH helicopter system. She had also received topside antisubmarine torpedo armament. Her two &quot;Weapon Alfa&quot; mounts had been removed. Chief among the new equipment installed in the ship was a bow-mounted sonar dome, utilizing revolutionary new concepts in underwater sound-ranging.

Emerging from the shipyard in September 1961, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; participated in a rescue operation soon thereafter, embarking the crew from the storm-endangered Texas Tower No. 2, off the coast of Massachusetts. &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; then stood guard over the early warning tower, fighting off Hurricane Esther as she remained in the vicinity of the abandoned &quot;Texas Tower.&quot;

&quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; spent much of her ensuing career involved in sonar evaluations of her bow-mounted system. She ranged from the mid-Atlantic to the Caribbean, frequently operating with submarines, and upon occasion visited Bermuda. There were highlights, though, of that normally routine duty, such as in the autumn of 1962 when the United States and the Soviet Union stood at the brink of a possible nuclear confrontation over the issue of Soviet missiles in Cuba. &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; operated on the Cuban &quot;quarantine line&quot; for 10 days, deploying in the Caribbean until President Kennedy called off the operation. She then resumed her sonar evaluations.

After spending January and February 1963 at the Boston Naval Shipyard for more alterations and improvements on the experimental sonar system, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; operated in Haitian waters during March, conducting further sonar evaluations. She varied that duty with a brief in-port visit at Port-au-Prince during the troubled political situation there at that time.

That summer, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; was attached to Destroyer Development Group (DesDevGru) 2, a group of ships engaged in experimental work of various kinds, and finished out the year 1963 in the Boston Naval Shipyard undergoing extensive boiler repairs.

With the exception of two brief trips to Newport, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; remained at the Boston Naval Shipyard until 29 April 1964, when she returned to her home port to prepare for a southern cruise. Underway on 6 May for type training in Guantánamo Bay, the frigate conducted further sonar evaluations later that month en route back to Newport before returning to her home port on 26 May. &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; subsequently conducted three more evaluation cruises before she participated in Exercise &quot;Steel Pike,&quot; the largest peacetime amphibious exercise in history. During those maneuvers, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; served as the flagship for Rear Admiral Mason Freeman, Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 2. To then round out the year, the frigate conducted another sonar evaluation cruise, calling twice at Key West during the voyage. She returned north on 11 December and spent the remainder of the year under restricted availability at the Bethlehem Steel Shipyard, East Boston, Mass.

&quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; resumed sonar testing operations in 1965 and operated twice in the Bahamas area. She subsequently conducted type training off the Virginia capes and in the Narragansett Bay area before arriving at the Boston Naval Shipyard on 30 June to commence a lengthy overhaul to her engineering plant and modifications to her sonar system.

For the remainder of her career, &quot;Willis A. Lee&quot; continued in her routine of sonar development and testing, home-ported out of Newport with occasional periods of yard repairs at Boston. During her final years, the frigate operated off the Virginia capes, in the Caribbean, and Narragansett Bay areas, and was deployed to the Mediterranean November 1966. She returned to Newport on 20 May 1967, thus completing her first extended deployment since 1961. She was deployed again to the Mediterranean January 1968, returning to Newport in May of that year. In August 1968, she was deployed to the Red Sea as the flagship for COMMIDEASTFOR. However, what was to be a 10-month deployment was cut short when she developed propulsion problems while in transit off the coast of Brazil. After undergoing two weeks of repair in Recife, Brazil, she was relieved by USS Luce (DLG-7), and returned to Newport. In January 1969, she transited from Newport to the Boston Naval Shipyard via the Cape Cod Canal for what was to be her final overhaul prior to decommissioning later that year.

==Fate==
Placed out of commission in December 1969, Willis A. Lee was struck from the Navy list on 15 May 1972. She was sold to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, of New York City, and taken under tow for her final voyage on 5 June 1973. She was subsequently scrapped.

<text>USS &quot;Wilkinson&quot; (DL-5) was a Mitscher class destroyer in the United States Navy. She was named for Vice Admiral Theodore Stark &quot;Ping&quot; Wilkinson USN (1888–1946).

&quot;Wilkinson&quot; was laid down by the Shipbuilding Division of the Bethlehem Steel Company at Quincy in Massachusetts on 1 February 1950; originally designated DD-930, she was reclassified as a destroyer leader and designated DL-5 on 9 February 1951, launched on 23 April 1952 by Lady Catherine Moore, the former Mrs. Theodore S. Wilkinson and commissioned on 3 August 1954.

==1955–1959==

After shakedown training out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and the usual post-shakedown availability, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; departed her home port, Newport, Rhode Island, on 21 February 1955—with Rear Admiral Arleigh Burke, Commander, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet (and soon to become the Chief of Naval Operations) and members of his staff embarked—and carried Admiral Burke on an inspection tour that included visits to San Juan, Puerto Rico; St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; Guantánamo Bay and Havana, Cuba; and Key West, Fla. Upon her return, the destroyer leader became flagship for Commander, Destroyer Flotilla (DesFlot) 2, part of the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s antisubmarine forces. For three months thereafter, the ship conducted antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises.

On 11 July, &quot;Wilkinson&quot;—with 70 1st and 3d class NROTC midshipmen embarked—departed the east coast for a training cruise. During the ensuing voyage, the warship touched at Edinburgh, Scotland; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Guantánamo Bay, before returning to the United States on 2 September.

&quot;Wilkinson&quot; departed her home port on 24 October 1955 for air defense exercises in the Gulf of Mexico, with Commander, DesFlot 6 embarked. During that cruise, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; visited New Orleans and Havana, before she arrived back at Newport on 18 November. On 2 December, the ship entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for a five-month overhaul and the installation of improved 3 inch antiaircraft guns. After successfully completing her sea trials for her newly installed 3 inch / 70 caliber battery, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; conducted underway training out of Guantánamo Bay. She later visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti; Charleston, S.C.; and Norfolk, Va.; before taking part in large-scale ASW maneuvers in June. The ship&#x27;s performance during the fiscal year 1956 earned her the Battle Efficiency &quot;E.&quot;

In July 1956, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; departed Newport, bound for San Diego, Calif., and duty with the Pacific Fleet. En route to her new home port, the frigate visited Havana; Balboa, Canal Zone; and Buena Ventura, Colombia; before she became flagship of Commander, Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 17—the first ship of her type assigned to the Pacific Fleet.

Between August 1956 and March 1957, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; operated locally out of San Diego and took part in ASW, air defense, and amphibious exercises. One highlight of that period occurred on 14 September 1956, when &quot;Wilkinson&quot; headed a veritable &quot;armada&quot; of 70 fighting ships during a 1st Fleet review off Long Beach, in what some called the largest naval parade on the west coast in 22 years.

During March and April 1957, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; operated in the Bering Sea and the Aleutians, visiting Kodiak and Dutch Harbor, Alaska, en route to her operating area. While steaming back to San Diego, she touched at Esquimalt, British Columbia; Seattle, Wash.; and San Francisco. Later, during part of May, Rear Admiral Chester Wood, Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet, embarked in &quot;Wilkinson&quot; for air defense and ASW exercises. In June, the warship visited Portland, Oreg., to take part in the annual Rose Festival activities.

&quot;Wilkinson&quot;&#x27;s home port was changed from San Diego to Long Beach in July 1957, and the destroyer leader entered the naval shipyard there in February 1958 for extensive modifications to her power plant. Released from the yard in September, the destroyer leader conducted underway training out of San Diego and operated locally for the remainder of 1958.

In January 1959, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; deployed on her first Western Pacific (WestPac) cruise, visiting Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Subic Bay, Philippines; Buckner Bay, Okinawa; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and the Japanese ports of Yokosuka and Kure, before she returned to Long Beach in March, embarking Commander, DesRon 19, upon arrival.

After again operating locally between April and October 1959, she participated in various exercises off the coast of California and in another 1st Fleet review. &quot;Wilkinson&quot; began her second WestPac deployment when she departed Long Beach in October. Coming under the operational control of Commander, 7th Fleet, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; took part in the Taiwan Strait patrol, ASW tactics, and various fast carrier task force operations in the Far East.

==1960–1965==

Returning to Long Beach in March 1960, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; entered the naval shipyard there for a five-month overhaul. During that period of repairs and alterations, the ship&#x27;s Combat Information Center (CIC) was enlarged and modified; and a long-range air search radar was added. In addition, a DASH (Destroyer Anti-Submarine Helicopter—sometimes sardonically nicknamed the &quot;Down at Sea Helicopter&quot;) system—was installed. This change increased &quot;Wilkinson&quot;&#x27;s ASW capacity severalfold.

Following &quot;Wilkinson&quot;&#x27;s departure from the shipyard in August 1960, she carried out six weeks of underway training out of San Diego. She operated locally during October and November and, after a month-long leave and upkeep period in December, was deployed to WestPac for the third time, departing Long Beach on 3 January 1961.

En route to the Far East, &quot;Wilkinson&quot;—a unit of Destroyer Division 191—visited Pearl Harbor; Midway; and Apra Harbor, Guam. In mid-March 1961, she headed for the South China Sea where an increased American naval presence was required by the Laotian crisis. After operating with a fast carrier task group almost continuously well into the spring, the destroyer leader departed WestPac on 12 May and reached Long Beach on the 27th.

She entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard in June for the installation of improved sonar equipment, a task that continued into mid-1962. After refresher training (during which there were two fires, resulting in two deaths), the warship operated in Puget Sound for technical evaluation of her new sonar system and then returned south, down the coast, to work with submarines in the southern California operating area.

Following further local operations, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; departed Long Beach on 17 June 1963 to return to the Atlantic Fleet. Calling at the Mexican ports of Acapulco and Salina Cruz en route, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; transited the Panama Canal on 29 June and arrived at Newport on 5 July.

Within two weeks, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; was underway for sonar evaluation that continued until 8 December. During the operation, the ship visited Bermuda and New York City. The frigate subsequently made another operational evaluation of the sonar system from 1 July 1964 to 20 May 1965, at which time she reported to Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. During that time, the ship operated in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean and along the continental shelf between Newport and New York. During the cruise, the ship visited Key West, Fla., and conducted type training in the Jacksonville, Fla., operating area while steaming back to Newport.

After a pre-overhaul tender availability, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; visited New York City for four days; off-loaded ammunition subsequently at Earle, N.J.; and proceeded to Boston for an overhaul which lasted until 5 February 1966.

==1966–1970==

After returning via Earle to Newport a little over a month later, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; sailed south to Cuban waters for refresher training—conducting those evolutions between 11 March and 28 April. While still at Guantanamo, on 8 April, the ship received orders at 03:10 to assist a burning freighter. Underway at 04:07, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; sped at flank speed to the scene of the disaster and, at 07:20, reached the stricken Norwegian passenger-freighter &quot;Viking Princess&quot;. A fire and rescue party from USCGC &quot;Cook Inlet&quot; (WAVP-384) had meanwhile boarded the blazing merchantman to fight her fires. At 08:09, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; began closing the Nationalist Chinese merchantman &quot;Chungking Victory&quot; to receive the surviving crew members of &quot;Viking Princess&quot;—a process completed by 09:14. The frigate took the 13 survivors back to Guantanamo where she arrived shortly before noon and disembarked the rescued mariners.

After departing Guantánamo Bay on 28 April, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; touched at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and reached Newport on 2 May. She remained in port until departing on the last day of the month, bound for Boston and an availability. During the ensuing overhaul, the ship received a number of repairs and alterations, including the final installation of new sonar equipment then being evaluated by the Navy. Briefly departing Boston on 15 August and again on 30 August, the frigate conducted sea trials and tested her sonar—during cruises lasting but a day or two—before she completed her availability and sailed for Newport on 31 August, reaching her home port the following day.

For the remainder of 1966, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; remained in port at Newport except for three periods of independent steaming exercises (ISEs)—from 6 to 9 September, from 23 to 26 September, and from 2 to 5 December. Underway on 15 January 1967, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; headed south to Argentine waters, subsequently taking part in the Argentinian naval review at Mar del Plata from 4 to 8 February on the occasion of the celebrations commemorating the sesquicentennial of Argentina&#x27;s independence.

Returning to Newport on 5 March, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; then proceeded to the Bethlehem Steel Shipyard at East Boston, Mass., where she received a data acquisition system for her sonar equipment. She returned—via Stamford, Conn., where she participated in Veteran&#x27;s Day memorial services—to Newport on 4 May.

Later that month, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; sailed for Montreal, Canada, where she served as part of the United States exhibit during &quot;United States Week,&quot; from 21 to 28 May, at the world&#x27;s fair, Expo 67. Highlighting &quot;Wilkinson&quot;&#x27;s stay at Montreal was a surprise visit to the exposition by President Lyndon B. Johnson. During the ceremonies at the United States exhibit, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; men served as Presidential Honor Guard.

Returning to Newport on 1 June, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; continued further sonar evaluations into the summer and fall months of 1967, operating primarily out of Newport but also east of the Bahamas. Between her periods at sea were times in port for tender availabilities and type training in the Narragansett Bay operating area.

The ship put into Port Everglades to take on fuel on 3 October and was standing back out on the 5th when a weak cleat snapped while the motor whaleboat was being secured for sea. The whiplash of the line struck a sailor, injuring both of his legs and requiring immediate medical attention beyond that which the ship could provide. &quot;Wilkinson&quot; immediately headed back to Port Everglades at flank speed, radioing ahead for a boat to pick up the injured seaman. A torpedo retriever boat, sent put by the Naval Ordnance Laboratory and Test Facility, took the man on board to a waiting ambulance at pierside. The seaman was then taken to Homestead Air Force Base hospital where he was treated for fractures of both legs.

After the incident, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; returned to sea and conducted further sonar tests—in company with &quot;Grouper&quot; (AGSS-214)—before the frigate visited Freeport, Grand Bahama, from 11 to 13 October. Proceeding back to Newport soon thereafter, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; reached her home port on the 25th but soon headed south for repairs at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. She returned to her home port on 21 December.

Beginning 1968 in-port at Newport, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; spent much of the rest of the year conducting further technical evaluation of sonar equipment in the Bahamas, interspersed with type training in the Mayport operating area and in-port periods at Newport. After a pre-overhaul period of availability alongside &quot;Yosemite&quot; (AD-19), &quot;Wilkinson&quot; entered the Boston Naval Shipyard on 13 September for her regular overhaul that rounded out the year and lasted into June 1969.

Following her sea trials, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; got underway for Narragansett Bay for sonar tests, before she set course for Earle, N.J., to load ammunition in preparation for refresher training. Late in July, the frigate visited New York City from 25 to 28 July before she shifted to Newport on the latter date. She remained in her home port for almost a month, conducting a dependents&#x27; cruise in Narragansett Bay operating areas on the 22d. It was during that cruise that the ship&#x27;s commanding officer announced that &quot;Wilkinson&quot; was to be decommissioned as part of a cut back in military expenses.

==Fate==
With the cancellation of all her previous schedules, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; shifted to the Boston Navy Yard&#x27;s South Boston Annex to commence inactivation on 3 September. Shifting to the Naval Inactive Ship Facility at Philadelphia on the 22d, &quot;Wilkinson&quot; was decommissioned on 19 December 1969 and placed in reserve.

&quot;Wilkinson&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1974 and sold for scrap to Luria Brothers and Company, Incorporated, of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania on 13 June 1975.

As of 2012, no other ships in the United States Navy have borne this name.

<text>Ivana Kobilca (20 December 1861 – 4 December 1926) was a Slovene painter, and is considered the most prominent female painter and a key figure of Slovene cultural identity. She was a realist painter who studied and worked in Vienna, Munich, Paris, Sarajevo, Berlin, and Ljubljana. She mostly painted oil paintings and pastels, whereas her drawings are few. The themes include still life, portraits, genre works, allegories, and religious scenes. She was a controversial person, criticized for following movements that had not developed further in later periods.

==Biography==

Ivana Kobilca was born in Ljubljana as a daughter in a wealthy family of a craftsman. Her parents gave great emphasis on education. At first, she learned how to draw, but also French and Italian, in the Ursuline High School in her home town, where her teacher of drawing was Ida Künl. When she was 16, she went with her father to Vienna, where she saw the paintings of old masters that inspired her. From 1879 to 1880, she studied in Vienna, where she copied the paintings at the gallery of the Academy of Arts, and from 1880 to 1881 in Munich. From 1882 to 1889, she continued her studies under Alois Erdtelt. In 1888, she participated for the first time in a public exhibition. At the following exhibition in Munich, her work was spotted and praised by the prominent German art historian Richard Muther. She then returned to Ljubljana. In 1890, she painted in Zagreb. In 1891 and 1892, she painted in Paris in the private school of Henri Gervex. She became an honorary member (&quot;membre associée&quot;) of Société Nationale des Beaux Arts. In 1892, she also painted in Barbizon. In 1893, she returned to Ljubljana, visited Florence in 1894, and lived in Sarajevo from 1897 to 1905. From 1906 to 1914, she lived in Berlin, and then returned to Ljubljana. At the time of her death in 1926 in Ljubljana, she was described as the greatest Yugoslav female painter.

== Works and meanings ==

Judging by her social origin, way of living, ideals and work, she was an urban artist. She is one of Slovene realists, who created their most important paintings in the 1880s. Kobilca&#x27;s greatest tribute to Slovenian art was made during the time she lived abroad. Her greatest impact was on figural painting, especially portraits and paintings of typical people&#x27;s lives in rustic or urban places. Since the time she had spent in Berlin, her most important genre became floral still life. Her early work reflects characteristics of München studio-work. Her focus was on value, chiaroscuro and draftsmanship; only her pastels were light and rosy. From 1889 onwards her painting became lighter with blue nuances, typical for Parisian art at the time.

In the late 1880s many artists were influenced by the Impressionist movement that began in France with Monet, Morisot, Renoir and others. Ivana Kobilca, however stayed true to her academic artistic roots; with strong focus on study of value, draftsmanship and realism in oil painting.

Kobilca&#x27;s best known paintings are &quot;Kofetarica&quot; (&quot;Coffee Drinker&quot;), 1888; &quot;Citrarica&quot; (&quot;Zitherist&quot;), &quot;Likarice&quot; (&quot;Women Ironers&quot;), 1891; &quot;Holandsko dekle&quot; (&quot;Dutch Girl&quot;), &quot;Portret sestre Fani&quot; (&quot;Portrait of Sister Fani&quot;), 1889; and &quot;Poletje&quot; (&quot;Summer&quot;), 1889. Her work is on display at all major European galleries.

==Commemoration==

After Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Kobilca was portrayed by Rudi Španzel on the 5000 Slovenian tolar banknote. It was in circulation from December 1993 until the introduction of euro in January 2007.

<text>Sir Robert Stout (28 September 1844 – 19 July 1930) was a New Zealand politician who was the 13th premier of New Zealand on two occasions in the late 19th century, and later Chief Justice of New Zealand. He was the only person to hold both these offices. He was noted for his support of liberal causes such as women&#x27;s suffrage, and for his strong belief that philosophy and theory should always triumph over political expediency.

==Early life==
Born in the town of Lerwick in Scotland&#x27;s Shetland Islands, Stout retained a strong attachment to the Shetland Islands throughout his life. He received a good education, was Dux at his school when he graduated in 1858 and eventually qualified as a teacher. He also qualified as a surveyor in 1860. He became highly interested in politics through his extended family, which often met to discuss and debate political issues of the day. Stout was exposed to many different political philosophies during his youth.

In 1863, Stout emigrated to Dunedin, New Zealand. Once there, he quickly became involved in political debate, which he greatly enjoyed. He also became active in the Freethought circles of the city. After failing to find employment as a surveyor on the Otago gold-fields, Stout returned to education, holding a number of senior teaching positions at the high-school level.

Eventually, however, Stout moved away from education and entered the legal profession. In 1867 he was working in the law firm of William Downie Stewart Sr (father of the William Downie Stewart Jr who later became Minister of Finance). He was called to the bar on 4 July 1871, and proved to be a highly successful trial-lawyer. He also became one of Otago University&#x27;s first students (possibly &quot;the&quot; first, although this claim is disputed), studying political economy and the theory of morality. He later became the university&#x27;s first law-lecturer.

==Early political career==



Stout&#x27;s political career started with his election to the Otago Provincial Council. During his time on the Council he impressed many people - both with his energy and with his rhetorical skill - although others found him abrasive, and complained about his lack of respect for those who held different views.

Stout successfully contested an August 1875 by-election in the Caversham electorate and thus became a Member of the New Zealand Parliament. He unsuccessfully opposed moves by the central government (Vogel) to abolish the provinces. At the 1875 election a few months later, he was returned in the City of Dunedin electorate.

On 13 March 1878, Stout became Attorney-General in the government of Premier George Grey. He had a hand in a number of significant pieces of legislation while in this role. On 25 July 1878, Stout gained the additional role of Minister of Lands and Immigration. A strong advocate of land reform, Stout worked towards the goal of state ownership of land, which would then be leased to individual farmers. He often expressed fears that private ownership would lead to the sort of &quot;powerful landlord class&quot; that existed in Britain. Stout also supported taxation of privately owned land, especially gains in value. Later, in 1885 he noted that he had already been an advocate of Georgist public finance policy long before Henry George wrote Progress and Poverty.

On 25 June 1879, however, Stout resigned both from cabinet and from parliament, citing the need to focus on his law practice. His partner in the practice was growing increasingly ill, and the success of his firm was important to the welfare of both Stout and his family. Throughout his career, Stout found the cost of participating in politics a serious worry. His legal career, however, was probably not the only contributing factor to his resignation, with a falling out between Stout and George Grey having occurred shortly beforehand.

At around this time Stout also developed a friendship with John Ballance, who had also resigned from Grey&#x27;s cabinet after a dispute. Stout and Ballance shared many of the same political views. During his absence from parliament, Stout began to form ideas about political parties in New Zealand, believing in the need for a united liberal front. He eventually concluded, however, that parliament was too fragmented for any real political parties to be established.

In the election of 1884 Stout re-entered parliament, and attempted to rally the various liberal-leaning MPs behind him. Stout promptly formed an alliance with Julius Vogel, a former premier (1873–1875 and 1876) – this surprised many observers, because although Vogel shared Stout&#x27;s progressive social views, the two had frequently clashed over economic policy and the future of the provincial governments. Many saw Vogel as the dominant partner in the alliance.

==Premier==

In August 1884, only a month after returning to parliament, Stout passed a vote of no confidence in the conservative Harry Atkinson, and assumed the premiership. Julius Vogel was made treasurer, thereby gaining a considerable measure of power in the administration. Stout&#x27;s new government lasted less than two weeks, however, with Atkinson managing to pass his own vote of no confidence against Stout. Atkinson himself, however, failed to establish a government, and was removed by yet another vote of no confidence. Stout and Vogel returned to power once again.

Stout&#x27;s second government lasted considerably longer than his first. Its primary achievements were the reform of the civil service and a programme to increase the number of secondary schools in the country. It also organised the construction of the Midland railway line between Canterbury and the West Coast. The economy, however, did not prosper, with all attempts to pull it out of depression failing. In the 1887 election, Stout himself lost his seat in parliament to James Allen by twenty-nine votes, thereby ending his premiership. Harry Atkinson, Stout&#x27;s old rival, was able to form a new government after the election.

At this point, Stout decided to leave parliamentary politics altogether, and instead focus on other avenues for promoting liberal views. In particular, he was interested in resolving the growing labour disputes of the time. He was highly active in building consensus between the growing labour movement and the world of middle-class liberalism.

==Liberal Party==
During Stout&#x27;s absence from politics, his old ally, John Ballance, had been continuing to fight in parliament. After the 1890 election, Ballance had gained enough support to topple Atkinson and take the premiership. Shortly afterwards, Ballance founded the Liberal Party, New Zealand&#x27;s first real political party. Only a few years later, however, Ballance became seriously ill, and asked Stout to return to parliament and be his successor. Stout agreed, and Ballance died shortly thereafter.

Stout re-entered parliament after a winning a by-election in Inangahua on 8 June 1893. Ballance&#x27;s deputy, Richard Seddon, had by this time assumed leadership of the party on the understanding that a full caucus vote would later be held. In the end, however, no vote was held. Stout, backed by those who considered Seddon too conservative, attempted to challenge this, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Many of Seddon&#x27;s supporters believed that the progressive views of Ballance and Stout were too extreme for the New Zealand public.

Stout remained in the Liberal Party, but constantly voiced objections to Seddon&#x27;s leadership. In addition to claiming that Seddon was betraying Ballance&#x27;s original progressive ideals, Stout also claimed that Seddon was too autocratic in his style of rule. Ballance&#x27;s idea of a united progressive front, Stout believed, had been subverted into nothing more than a vehicle for the conservative Seddon. Seddon defended himself against these charges by claiming that Stout was merely bitter about not gaining the leadership.

==Women&#x27;s suffrage==
One of the last major campaigns that Stout participated in was the drive to grant voting rights to women. Stout had long been a supporter of this cause, having campaigned tirelessly for his own failed bill in 1878 and Julius Vogel&#x27;s failed bill in 1887. He had also been highly active in the campaign to increase property rights for women, having been particularly concerned with the right of married women to keep property independently from their husbands.

John Ballance had been a supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage, although his attempts to pass a bill had been blocked by the conservative Legislative Council (the now-abolished upper house of Parliament). Seddon, however, was opposed, and many believed that the cause was now lost. However, a major initiative by suffragists led by Kate Sheppard generated considerable support for women&#x27;s suffrage, and Stout believed that a bill could be passed despite Seddon&#x27;s objection. A group of progressive politicians, including Stout, passed a women&#x27;s suffrage bill in 1893 through both the lower and upper houses, with the upper house narrowly passing it after some members who had not been in favour changed their votes because of Seddon&#x27;s attempts to &quot;kill&quot; the bill in the upper house.

Stout was also involved with the failing Walter Guthrie group of companies in Southland and Otago which had been supported by the Bank of New Zealand, and (according to Bourke) Seddon was prepared to conceal Stout&#x27;s involvement – provided Stout left politics.

In 1898 Stout retired from politics. He had represented the seats of Caversham in the 5th parliament (1875), Dunedin East in the 6th parliament (1875–79) and in the 9th parliament (1884–87), Inangahua in the 11th parliament (1893), and the City of Wellington in the 12th and 13th parliaments (1893–98).

==Life after politics==

On 22 June 1899, he was appointed Chief Justice of New Zealand, and remained in this position until 31 January 1926. As of 2011, Stout was the last Chief Justice of New Zealand to have served in the New Zealand Parliament.

While Chief Justice, Stout showed a particular interest in the rehabilitation of criminals, contrasting with the emphasis on punishment that prevailed at the time. He took a leading part in the consolidation of New Zealand statutes (completed in 1908), and was made a Privy Councillor in 1921. In the same year as his retirement, Stout was appointed to the Legislative Council, the last political office he would hold.

Stout also had a role of considerable importance in the development of the New Zealand university system. He had become a member of the Senate of the University of New Zealand in 1885, and remained so until 1930. From 1903 to 1923, he was the university&#x27;s Chancellor. He was also prominent in Otago University from 1891 to 1898, serving on its council. He played a very significant role in the founding of what is now Victoria University of Wellington – the strong connection between Victoria University and the Stout family is remembered by the university&#x27;s Stout Research Centre and its Robert Stout Building.

In 1929, Stout became increasingly ill, and never recovered. On 19 July 1930 he died in Wellington.

<text>A clothespin (US English) or clothes peg (UK English) is a fastener used to hang up clothes for drying, usually on a clothes line. Clothespins come in many different designs.

==Design==

During the 1700s laundry was hung on bushes, limbs or lines to dry but no clothespins can be found in any painting or prints of the era. The clothespin for hanging up wet laundry only appears in the early 19th century supposedly patented by Jérémie Victor Opdebec. This design does not use springs, but is fashioned in one piece of wood, with the two prongs part of the peg chassis with only a small distance between them—this form of peg creates the gripping action due to the two prongs being wedged apart and thus squeezing together in that the prongs want to return to their initial, resting state. This form of peg is often fashioned from plastic, or originally, wood. In England, clothes-peg making used to be a craft associated with the Romani people, who made clothes-pegs from small, split lengths of willow or ash wood.

In 1853 David M. Smith of Springfield, Vermont, invented a clothespin with two prongs connected by a fulcrum, plus a spring.
By a lever action, when the two prongs are pinched at the top of the peg, the prongs open up, and when released, the spring draws the two prongs shut, creating the action necessary for gripping.
The design by Smith was improved by Solon E. Moore in 1887. He added what he called a &quot;coiled fulcrum&quot; made from a single wire, this was the spring that held the wooden pieces together, acted as a spring forcing them to shut, and as a fulcrum on which the two halves could rock, eliminating the need for a separate component, and reducing manufacturing costs. This became the first successful spring-actuated clothespin, being manufactured and sold in huge quantities all across the United States.

The state of Vermont, and its capital of Montpelier, in particular, quickly became what &quot;The New York Times&quot; has called &quot;The Silicon Valley of Clothespin Manufacturing&quot;, the United States Clothespin Company (U.S.C. Co.) opened in 1887 to manufacture Moore&#x27;s improved design. Vermonter Stephen Thomas served as company president, and the company enjoyed a significant level of success in spite of the competitors that rapidly sprang up in Waterbury and other places.

In 1909, Allan Moore, one of the U.S.C. Co. employees, devised a way in which clothespins could be manufactured more cheaply, by eliminating one of the coils in the &quot;spring fulcrum&quot;. He left the company, and with a loan from a local entrepreneur opened a competing factory, across the street from the U.S.C. Co. building. The new National Clothespin Company rapidly overtook the U.S.C. Co., consuming 500,000 board-feet of lumber at the height of production. After World War I, cheap imports from Europe began to flood the market, leading to repeated calls for protective tariffs by Vermont, and the state industry went into decline; in 1920, it cost 58 cents to manufacture one gross of clothespins in Vermont, while imported Swedish clothespins were sold for 48 cents a gross. The situation worsened after World War II, and the introduction of the electric clothes dryer diminished demand for clothespins, further damaging the industry; the U.S.C. Co. closed before the end of the 1940s. However, the National Clothespin Company, who had previously moved from its original location across the street, and had been sold to a new owner, managed to stay in business by virtue of a contract with the F. W. Woolworths department store chain. In this fashion, they managed to hang on through the following decades, in spite of a disastrous fire in 1978. The profit margin was eaten into further by the increasing volume of cheap Chinese imports; pleas for protective tariffs continued, but to no result. The company, which had discontinued its line of wooden clothespins, diversified into plastics, including plastic clothespins, which constituted only a small part of overall production. However, the National Clothespin Company finally ceased production of clothespins, the last American-manufactured clothespin coming off the production line in 2009.
Clothespins were further enhanced by the invention of stainless steel clothespins that do not rust or decay with outdoor use. Rather than using a torsion spring that often twists, causing the clothespin to fall apart, they rely on a strong, trapped, compression spring that results in a stronger grip. 
==Other uses==
===Public art===

One famous clothespin is a sculpture by Claes Oldenburg, entitled &quot;Clothespin&quot;. It is in Philadelphia across the street from the City Hall, and can be seen in the movie &quot;Trading Places&quot;.

There is a 5-foot clothespin granite grave marker in the Middlesex cemetery, Vermont, marking the grave of Jack Crowell, the last owner of the National Clothespin Company, which was the last clothespin manufacturer in the United States. He originally requested that it include a working spring be included so children could play on it, but the stone workers convinced him it wasn&#x27;t feasible.

===Filmmaking===

During the production of a movie, commercial, music video etc., a spring-type clothespin is called a &quot;CP 47&quot;, &quot;C47&quot;, &quot;47&quot;, &quot;peg&quot;, &quot;ammo&quot;, or &quot;bullet&quot;. It is useful on set since the lights used on film sets quickly become far too hot to touch; a wooden C47 is used to attach a color correction gel or diffusion to the barn doors on a light. The wooden clothespins do not transmit heat very effectively, and therefore are safe to touch, even when attached to hot lights for a significant period of time. Plastic clothespins are not used as plastic would melt with the heat of the lights, and metal would transfer the heat, making the clothespin too hot to touch. People like gaffers, grips, electricians, and production assistants may keep a collection of C47s clipped to clothing or utility belt at all times. Hence the nickname &quot;bullet&quot;, as so many crew members clip a number of C47s to their utility belts, much like an old west gunslinger would carry extra bullets on his gun belt.

When a performer is in full makeup they sometimes cannot drink from a cup so they drink from a straw. When the bottle or cup is too deep for the straw a C47 is clipped an inch from the top of the straw to keep the straw from falling into the drink.

===Lutherie===

In lutherie (the construction and repair of stringed instruments), clothes-pegs are often used to glue on during the production of guitars, mandolins, and other stringed instruments.

===Frequency control at radio-control model flying/operation sites===

Since multiple RC frequency use began in the RC hobbies in the mid-20th century, so-called &quot;frequency pins&quot; have been used to ensure that only one modeler was using a particular frequency at any one time. The common, spring-loaded two-piece wood clothespin - marked in some manner with text and/or color-coding for the designated frequency it references, usually with an added piece of thin plywood or plastic on the clothespin to place the text or color-code upon for greater visibility - is the usual basis for these, whether the model club itself provides them already clipped onto a &quot;frequency control board&quot; for the modeler to take for their activity (clipped onto their transmitter&#x27;s antenna, in a so-called &quot;subtractive&quot; method) or the modeler make them for their own transmitter(s), and places them on a club facility&#x27;s existing frequency board (the &quot;additive&quot; method).

===Music===
For many years players in ensembles such as brass bands playing outdoors have used spring pegs to hold their music in place since even the mildest breeze will blow a loose sheet away.

===BDSM===
Clothespins may be used during acts that involve pinching such as in breast torture or zippers.

<text>Don Ameche (; born Dominic Felix Amici; May 31, 1908 – December 6, 1993) was an American actor, comedian and vaudevillian. After playing in college shows, repertory theatre, and vaudeville, he became a major radio star in the early 1930s, which led to the offer of a movie contract from 20th Century Fox in 1935.

In the 1950s he worked on Broadway and in television, and was the host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;International Showtime&quot; from 1961 to 1965. Returning to film work in his later years, Ameche enjoyed a fruitful revival of his career, beginning with his role as a villain in &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983). He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985).

==Early life==
Don Ameche was born as Dominic Felix Amici on May 31, 1908, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. His father, Felice Amici, was a bartender from Montemonaco, Ascoli Piceno, Marche, Italy. His mother, Barbara Etta Hertel, was of Scottish, Irish, and German ancestry. Ameche was the second-oldest of eight children, the others being: brothers Umberto (Bert), James (Jim Ameche), and Louis, and sisters Elizabeth, Catherine, Mary and Anna. Ameche attended Marquette University, Loras College, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where his cousin Alan Ameche played football and won the Heisman Trophy in 1954.

==Career==

Ameche had done well in college dramatics at the University of Wisconsin, and when a lead actor for a stock company production of &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; did not turn up, a friend persuaded him to stand in for the missing actor. He enjoyed the experience and got a juvenile lead in &quot;Jerry For Short&quot; in New York, followed by a tour in vaudeville with Texas Guinan until she dropped him from the act, dismissing him as &quot;too stiff&quot;.

Ameche then moved to Chicago, where &quot;he began a radio career in 1930 on &quot;Empire Builders&quot;, a program broadcast from the Merchandise Mart. By 1932, Ameche had become the leading man on two other Chicago-based programs: the dramatic anthology &quot;First Nighter&quot;, and &quot;Betty and Bob&quot;, the latter considered by many to be the forerunner of the soap-opera genre.&quot;

Brought to Hollywood by 20th-Century Fox producer Darryl Zanuck, Ameche played mostly romantic leads paired with many of the top female stars of the era. In 1939, he played a lead character in comedy film &quot;Midnight&quot; (1939). He also played the title character in &quot;The Story of Alexander Graham Bell&quot; (1939) which led to the use of the word &quot;ameche&quot; as juvenile slang for a telephone. As noted by Mike Kilen in the &quot;Iowa City Gazette&quot; (December 8, 1993), &quot;The film prompted a generation to call people to the telephone with the phrase: &#x27;You&#x27;re wanted on the Ameche.&#x27;&quot; Such an identity between Ameche and the telephone was forged, that in the 1940 film &quot;Go West&quot;, Groucho Marx proclaims, &quot;Telephone? This is 1870, Don Ameche hasn&#x27;t invented the telephone yet.&quot;

Ameche was Alice Faye&#x27;s leading man in &quot;Hollywood Cavalcade&quot; (1939), then played another real-life figure, Stephen Foster, in &quot;Swanee River&quot; (1939). He did a third biopic, &quot;Lillian Russell&quot; (1940) with Faye, and was top billed in a war film, &quot;Four Sons&quot; (1940). He also starred in two popular musicals, &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; (1940), which helped make stars of Betty Grable and Carmen Miranda, and &quot;Moon Over Miami&quot; (1941), also with Grable. In 1940, he was voted the 21st-most-popular star in Hollywood.

Ameche did &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1943), &quot;Happy Land&quot; (1943), &quot;Wing and a Prayer&quot; (1944), and &quot;Greenwich Village&quot; (1944). In 1944, he reportedly earned $247,677 for 1943($4,495,498 in 2024 dollars), making him the second highest earner at 20th Century Fox after Spyros Skouras .

Following his appearances as announcer and sketch participant on &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot;, Ameche achieved memorable success during the late 1940s playing opposite Frances Langford in &quot;The Bickersons&quot;, the Philip Rapp radio comedy series about a combative married couple. It began on NBC in 1946, moving to CBS the following year. He also had his own program, &quot;The Old Gold Don Ameche Show&quot;, on NBC Red in the early 1940s.

In 1950 Ameche became the star of &quot;Holiday Hotel&quot;, on ABC-TV.

Ameche appeared regularly in films until 1970, as he shifted to television and the stage. He returned to films after thirteen years with &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), where he was cast when director John Landis had someone in mind from the 1930s and 1940s who had not played many villainous roles and came upon Ameche (after Ray Milland was passed over due to not being able to pass the insurance physical). After having to track him down in Santa Monica, California due to not being able to reach him through the Screen Actors Guild, who said that his royalty payments were going to his son in Arizona, Ameche took on the role. This started a comeback where Ameche would appear more regularly in films, including &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985, which earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot; (1987), &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988), and &quot;&quot; (1988). 

He earned good reviews for the David Mamet and Shel Silverstein-penned &quot;Things Change&quot; (1988); &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that he showed &quot;the kind of great comic aplomb that wins actors awards for other than sentimental reasons.&quot; His later credits included an episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; (1990), the films &quot;Oscar&quot; (1991), &quot;Folks!&quot; (1992), and the voice of Shadow in &quot;Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey&quot; (1993). His final appearance was in the film &quot;Corrina, Corrina&quot; (1994), which was released posthumously.

==Personal life==
From 1946 to 1949, together with other Los Angeles entertainment figures including Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, Ameche owned the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference, a rival to the National Football League. He was instrumental in forming and leading the ownership group the year before play began and initially served as team president.

Ameche was married to Honore Prendergast from 1932 until her death in 1986. They were separated from each other at the time of her death and Ameche didn&#x27;t attend her funeral according to her 1986 obituary. They had six children. One of their four sons, Ron Ameche, owned a restaurant, &quot;Ameche&#x27;s Pumpernickel&quot; in Coralville, Iowa. They had two daughters, Connie and Bonnie. Ameche&#x27;s younger brother, Jim Ameche, also a well-known actor, died in 1983 at the age of 67.

Ameche was Roman Catholic and a Republican who supported the campaign of Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election and 
Dwight Eisenhower during the 1952 presidential election.

==Death==
On December 6, 1993, Ameche died at his son Richard Ameche&#x27;s house in Scottsdale, Arizona, of prostate cancer
at age 85. He was cremated and his ashes are buried at Resurrection Catholic Cemetery in Asbury, Iowa.

<text>Guru Amar Das (Gurmukhi: ਗੁਰੂ ਅਮਰ ਦਾਸ, pronunciation: ; 5 May 1479 – 1 September 1574), sometimes spelled as Guru Amardas, was the third of the Ten Gurus of Sikhism and became Sikh Guru on 26 March 1552 at age 73.

Before becoming a Sikh (Shishya from Sanskrit), on a pilgrimage after having been prompted to search for a &quot;guru&quot;, he heard his nephew&#x27;s wife, Bibi Amro, reciting a hymn by Guru Nanak, and was deeply moved by it. Amro was the daughter of Guru Angad, the second Guru of the Sikhs. Amar Das persuaded Amro to introduce him to her father. In 1539, Amar Das, at the age of sixty, met Guru Angad and became a Sikh, devoting himself to the Guru. In 1552, before his death, Guru Angad appointed Amar Das as the third Guru of Sikhism.

Guru Amar Das was an important innovator in the teachings of Guru who introduced a religious organization called the Manji system by appointing trained clergy, a system that expanded and survives into the contemporary era. He wrote and compiled hymns into a Pothi (book) that ultimately helped create the Adi Granth&quot;. 

Amar Das remained the Guru of the Sikhs till age 95, and named his son-in-law Bhai Jetha, who was later remembered by the name Guru Ram Das, as his successor.

==Early life==

=== Family background ===
Amar Das was born to mother Bakht Kaur (also known as Sullakhani, Lakhmi Devi, or Rup Kaur) and father Tej Bhan Bhalla on 5 May 1479 in Basarke village in what is now called Amritsar district of Punjab (India). His grandfather was Hari Das. His family belonged to the Bhalla gotra (clan) of the Khatri tribe. Amar Das was the eldest child out of four sons. Amar Das worked as both an agriculturalist and a trader.

=== Marriage ===
In his early 20s, Amar Das married Mansa Devi and they had four children which they named Dani (daughter; born in 1530), Bhani (daughter; born 3 August 1533), Mohan (son; born 11 March 1536), and Mohri (son; born 2 June 1539). Bhani was his favourite child of the four.

=== Religious pilgrimages ===
Amar Das had followed the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism for much of his life. He was reputed to have gone on some twenty annual pilgrimages into the Himalayas, to Haridwar on river Ganges. About 1539, on one such Hindu pilgrimage, he met a Hindu monk (&quot;sadhu&quot;) who asked him why he did not have a guru (teacher, spiritual counselor) and Amar Das decided to get one. On his return from his twentieth pilgrimage to the Ganges River, he heard Bibi Amro, the daughter of the Sikh Guru Angad, singing a hymn by Guru Nanak. Amro had been acquainted with Amar Das through her in-laws, whom Amar Das was related to (Amro was married to the son of Amar Das&#x27; brother). He learned from her about Guru Angad, and with her help met the second Guru of Sikhism and adopted him as his spiritual Guru who was much younger than his own age.

=== Service of Guru Angad ===

Amar Das is famous in the Sikh tradition for his relentless service to Guru Angad, with legends about waking up in the early hours and fetching water for his Guru&#x27;s bath, cleaning and cooking for the volunteers with the Guru, as well devoting much time to meditation and prayers in the morning and evening.

Due to his selfless devotion to the second guru, Angad nominated Amar Das as his spiritual successor on 29 March 1552.

==Guruship==
After eleven years most devoted service of Guru Angad and the sangats, Amar Das was nominated the third guru. Amar Das moved to Goindwal situated not far away from Khadur on the bank of river Beas on the high road to Lahore, about 8 kilometres from Kapurthala and 45 kms. from Amritsar. He did so to avoid the pending conflict with Angad&#x27;s sons who had not approved of their supersession. Even at Goindwal he was harassed by Angad&#x27;s son Datu. He went to Goindwal and said: &quot;Only yesterday thou wert a water-carrier in our house, and today thou sittest as a Guru. &quot;Saying this he kicked the Guru off his seat. Amar Das humbly said: &quot;O great king, pardon me. Thou must have hurt thy foot.&quot; Amar Das retired from Goindwal and hid himself in a house at Basarke, his home village. Datu set himself up as the Guru. Amar Das was persuaded by Baba Buddha to return, and Datu, finding no following, went back to Khadur.

=== Teachings ===

Guru Amar Das taught with his own life the meaning of Guru Service, also known in Punjabi religious parlance as Guru &quot;Sewa&quot;. (also spelt &quot;Sevā)&quot;. Amar Das emphasized both spiritual pursuits as well as an ethical daily life. He encouraged his followers to wake up before dawn, do their ablutions and then meditate in silent seclusion. A good devotee, taught Amar Das, should be truthful, keep his mind in control, eat only when hungry, seek the company of pious men, worship the Lord, make an honest living, serve holy men, not covet another&#x27;s wealth and never slander others. He recommended holy devotion with Guru&#x27;s image in his follower&#x27;s hearts.

Guru Amar Das was also a reformer, and discouraged veiling of women&#x27;s faces (a Muslim custom) as well as sati (a Hindu custom). He encouraged the Kshatriya people to fight in order to protect people and for the sake of justice, stating this is Dharma. He promoted inter-caste marriages, going against the traditional Punjabi social orthodoxy at the time by doing-so. He also promoted the remarriage of widows. He promulgated monogamy as the ideal romantic relationship type.

=== Influence ===

==== Religious organization and missionary dissemination ====
Guru Amar Das started the tradition of appointing &quot;manji&quot; (zones of religious administration with an appointed chief called &quot;sangatias,&quot; whom were both men and women), introduced the &quot;dasvandh&quot; (&quot;the tenth&quot; of income) system of revenue collection in the name of Guru and as pooled community religious resource, and the famed &quot;langar&quot; tradition of Sikhism where anyone, without discrimination of any kind, could get a free meal in a communal seating. He also started and inaugurated the 84-level step well called &quot;baoli&quot; at Goindval with a resting place, modeled along the lines of the Indian tradition of &quot;dharmsala&quot;, which then became a Sikh pilgrimage (&quot;tirath&quot;) center. Another organization analogous of the Manji was the &quot;Piri,&quot; which involved an appointed preaching official and missionary for Sikh assemblies and congregations whom were all women and instructed to spread Sikhism amongst womankind (especially women belonging to Muslim backgrounds). According to W. Owen Cole, establishment of the manji and piri systems may have been motivated by the large amounts of new converts coming into the Sikh faith, especially in the Punjab. However, many of these converts brought in beliefs and practices of their original faith, so the preachers were appointed to instruct them on proper Sikh orthodoxy and orthopraxy, essentially motivating them to choose the Sikh faith and all that comes with it, even if it involves discarding their old ways of spirituality in the process. He appointed women to become the congregation leaders of the jurisdictions of Afghanistan and Kashmir. The women appointed for leading the Piri system of disseminating Sikhism to women were Bhani (his younger daughter), Bibi Dani (his elder daughter), and Bibi Pal, all of whom were intellectual types. The Piri system also educated womenfolk in social plus religious norms and customs.

Amar Das personally patronized the education of his son-in-law Jetha (future Guru Ram Das) in North Indian classical music, and Bhai Gurdas, in various languages and religious literature.

==== Banning of Sati ====
Guru Amar Das was a strong opponent of &quot;sati&quot;, the practice of widowed wives being immolated on the funeral pyre of their deceased husband during the latter&#x27;s cremation. He states the following regarding the practice:

He further states:

==== Opposing the Purdah system ====
&quot;Purdah&quot; is a traditional custom of women obscuring their face and bodies when in the company of men and secluding themselves from the company of men. Guru Amar Das was vehemently against this custom and is said to have once reprimanded the visiting &quot;raja&quot; (king) of Haripur and his wives when the latter observed the custom around him. One of the queens of the raja refused to part ways with veiling herself, in which the Guru responded: &quot;if thou art not pleased with the Guru&#x27;s face why halt thou come hither.&quot;

==== Akbar ====

The Mughal Emperor Akbar met Guru Amar Das. According to the Sikh legend, he neither received Akbar nor was Akbar directly ushered to him, rather the Guru suggested that Akbar like everyone sit on the floor and eat in the &quot;langar&quot; with everyone before their first meeting. Akbar, who sought to encourage tolerance and acceptance across religious lines, readily accepted the suggestion. After the conclusion of the Langar, Akbar sat in the congregation with the rest of the sangat and asked the Guru a question. The Sikh hagiographies called &quot;janam-sakhis&quot; mention that Guru Amar Das persuaded Akbar to repeal the tax on Hindu pilgrims going to Haridwar. Prominent Sikh figure Bhai Mani Singh (1718), mentions prior to the meeting Akbar pleaded the Guru for a blessing in annexing the difficult to capture Chittorgarh, which the Guru gave and after the meeting he gave 84 villages in the name of his prominent Sikh Guru Ram Das after the Guru himself refused.

==== Rituals in Sikhism: wedding, festivals, funeral ====
Amar Das composed the rapturous hymn called &quot;Anand&quot; and made it a part of the ritual of Sikh marriage called &quot;Anand Karaj&quot;, which literally means &quot;blissful event&quot;.

Amar Das believed that a successful marriage was one in which the souls of the husband and wife became one metaphorically:

The &quot;Anand&quot; hymn is sung, in contemporary times, not only during Sikh weddings but also at major celebrations. Parts of the &quot;Anand hymn&quot; are recited in Sikh temples (&quot;Gurdwara&quot;) every evening, at the naming of a Sikh baby, as well as during a Sikh funeral. It is a section of the &quot;Anand Sahib&quot; composition of Guru Amar Das, printed on pages 917 to 922 of the &quot;Adi Granth&quot; and set to the &quot;Ramkali&quot; raga.

Guru Amar Das&#x27;s entire &quot;Anand Sahib&quot; composition is a linguistic mix of Panjabi and Hindi languages, reflecting Guru Amar Das&#x27; upbringing and background. The hymn celebrates the freedom from suffering and anxiety, the union of the soul with the divine, describing a devotee&#x27;s bliss achieved through the Guru with inner devotion and by repeating the Name of the Creator. The hymn states in stanza 19 that the Vedas teach &quot;the Name is supreme&quot;, in stanza 27 that Smriti and Shastra discuss the good and the bad but are unreal because they lack a Guru and that it is the grace of the Guru which awakens the heart and the devotion to the Name. The hymn celebrates the life of a householder and constant inner devotion to the One, ending each stanza with the characteristic &quot;says Nanak&quot;.

Guru Amar Das is also credited in the Sikh tradition to have encouraged building of temples and places where Sikhs could gather together on festivals such as Maghi,
Diwali and Vaisakhi. He required his disciples to gather together for prayers and communal celebrations in autumn for Diwali and in spring for Vaisakhi, both post harvest ancient festivals of India.

==== Founding of Goindwal and construction of the Baoli Sahib ====
Guru Amar Das was responsible for establishing a new centre of Sikh authority at Goindwal and erecting a stepwell known as Baoli Sahib at the location. The foresight of the Guru building a headquarters at the central location of Goindwal in the Punjab on the bank of the Beas River, being intersected by the three major cultural regions of the area (Majha, Malwa, and Doaba), may have facilitated the fast-spread of Sikhism throughout the three main regions of Punjab. The Baoli Sahib was the first truly Sikh pilgrimage site and it helped attract new prospective members to the faith.

==== Site of the Golden Temple ====

Guru Amar Das selected the site in Amritsar village for a special temple, that Guru Ram Das began building, Guru Arjan completed and inaugurated, and the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh gilded. This temple has evolved into the contemporary &quot;Harimandir Sahib&quot;, or the temple of Hari (God), also known as the Golden Temple. It is the most sacred pilgrimage site in Sikhism.

==== Festivals ====
Scholars such as Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech and William McLeod state that Guru Amar Das was influential in introducing &quot;distinctive features, pilgrimages, festivals, temples and rituals&quot; that ever since his time have been an integral part of Sikhism. He was responsible for solidifying the dates of Vaisakhi and Diwali as biannual affairs where Sikhs could gather together and meet directly with their guru.

==== Scripture ====

Amar Das is also remembered as the innovator who began the collection of hymns now known as &quot;Goindwal Pothi&quot; or &quot;Mohan Pothi&quot;, the precursor to what became the &quot;Adi Granth&quot; – the first edition of Sikh scripture – under the fifth Sikh Master, which finally emerged as the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; under the tenth Sikh Master. The nearly 900 hymns composed by Guru Amar Das constitute the third largest part, or about 15%, of the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;.

=== Choosing a successor ===

Amar Das had four people in mind that would succeed him as the next Guru:

# Ramu, his son-in-law
# Jetha, his son-in-law
# Mohan, his elder son
# Mohri, his younger son

He devised four tests for them all to undertake to decide who will inherit the guruship. It is said that only Jetha passed them all.

It has been postulated that he may have considered his own daughter, Bhani, as a possible successor for the guruship at some point.

== Death ==
Shortly before his death, it is recorded in &quot;Ramkali Sadu&quot; (composed by his great-grandson, Baba Sundar), that he called upon all of his familial relatives to acknowledge the new Guru, Ram Das, and personally placed the sandal paste on Bhai Jetha&#x27;s forehead to anoint him as his successor. He died in 1574, in Goindwal Sahib, and like other Sikh Gurus he was cremated, with the &quot;flowers&quot; (remaining bones and ash after the cremation) immersed into (flowing waters).

== Birth year ==
Whilst the most commonly accepted and recorded date for Guru Amar Das&#x27; birth year is 1479, many sources give a much later date of 1509.

Some sources that affirm the 1479 year of birth for the guru are: Ganda Singh&#x27;s &quot;Makhaz-i-Twarikh-i-Sikhan&quot;, Karam Singh&#x27;s &quot;Gurpurab Nirnay&quot;, Kahn Singh Nabha&#x27;s &quot;Mahan Kosh&quot;, Max Arthur MaCauliffe&#x27;s &quot;The Sikh Religion&quot;, and Giani Gian Singh&#x27;s &quot;Panth Prakash&quot; and &quot;Twarikh Guru Khalsa&quot;.

Sources that give a later year of 1509 as the birth year for the guru are: Joseph Davey Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;History of the Sikhs&quot; and Kesar Singh Chibber&#x27;s &quot;Bansavalinama&quot;.

Kavi Santokh Singh in the &quot;Suraj Prakash&quot; gives an even earlier year of birth of 1469, coinciding with Guru Nanak&#x27;s.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Guru Amardas&quot; is a 1979 documentary film, directed by Prem Prakash and produced by the Government of India&#x27;s Films Division, covering his life and teachings.

<doc id="520934" wikidata="Q760909" url="?curid=520934" title="August Belmont Jr.">
<text>August Belmont Jr. (February 18, 1853 – December 10, 1924) was an American financier. He financed the construction of the original New York City Subway line (1900–1904) and for many years headed the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which ran the transit system. He also financed and led the construction of the Cape Cod Canal in Massachusetts, which opened in 1914. 
Belmont bought the land for and built New York&#x27;s Belmont Park racetrack—named for his father—and was a major owner/breeder of thoroughbred racehorses. 
He served as chairman of the board of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. He also served as a director of the Southern Pacific Co., parent of the railroad, and National Park Bank.

==Early life==
He was born in Manhattan, New York City, on February 18, 1853, to Caroline Slidell Perry and August Belmont Sr. His maternal grandfather was Commodore Matthew C. Perry.

He graduated from St. Mark&#x27;s School and was an 1875 graduate of Harvard University. At Harvard on the track team he introduced spiked track shoes to the United States. He was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon at Harvard. Belmont was also a member of the Porcellian Club.

After graduation he worked at the Belmont banking house, August Belmont &amp; Co. At the death of his father in 1890, he became the head of the company.

Belmont founded the Interborough Rapid Transit Company in 1902 to help finance the construction of and operate the first line of what is now the New York City Subway. He served as president, and, in 1907, chairman of the company. Belmont holds the distinction of owning the world&#x27;s only purpose built private subway car. Named &quot;Mineola&quot;, it was used by Belmont to give tours of the IRT. The car is now preserved at the Shore Line Trolley Museum.

==World War I==
Following the United States&#x27; entry into World War I, Belmont, at age 64, volunteered to assist the war effort and was sent to France by the United States Army. He received a commission as major in the United States Army Air Service on November 9, 1917, in France.

He was assigned to the supply department of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) and conducted negotiations with the government of Spain to procure supplies for the AEF. He was on detached service to the United States from February 16 to October 23, 1918, when he returned to France. He returned to the United States on December 21 and was discharged from the Army on January 6, 1919. He was one of the oldest officers to serve in the U.S. Army during the First World War.

During the war, his son, Morgan Belmont, served as a lieutenant at the Aviation Instruction Center at Foggia, Italy. Another son, Raymond Belmont, served as an Infantry officer with the 78th Division in France and participated in Saint-Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives.

His wife, Eleanor, also devoted much time to raising funds in aid of Belgian relief efforts and for the Red Cross, she made a number of trans-Atlantic trips as an inspector of United States Army camps.

==Cape Cod Canal==
Belmont was instrumental in making the Cape Cod Canal a reality. The grand opening of the Cape Cod Canal took place on July 29, 1914, and it was soon plagued with troubles. Belmont&#x27;s canal was expensive for mariners, costing as much as $16.00 for a trip by schooner, a considerable sum in those days. The narrow width and shallow depth of the canal made navigation difficult, and tidal flows created dangerous currents, so many mariners continued to use the routes around the cape. As a result, tolls did not live up to expectations and the Cape Cod Canal became a losing proposition. As a result, the canal was purchased by the U.S. government on March 30, 1928. 

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
Like his father, Belmont was an avid Thoroughbred racing fan. According to his &quot;Time&quot; obituary, Belmont &quot;is credited with having saved thoroughbred racing when it was at its lowest ebb in the East, after the repeal of the racing law in New York State.&quot;

Belmont served as the first president of The Jockey Club and was chairman of the New York State Racing Commission. In 1895 he was one of the nine founding members of the National Steeplechase Association.

Belmont inherited Nursery Stud, a Thoroughbred breeding operation established in 1867 by his father at his Babylon, New York, estate. There, Belmont raised polo ponies and played on a polo team with Harry Payne Whitney. It was here he stood the Hall of Fame stallion Kentucky. In the early 1880s, Belmont Sr. leased a farm property in Kentucky, located about three miles outside Lexington. After transferring all of the breeding business there, Belmont Jr. developed a very important stud farm whose influences are still felt today. Given the same name as the New York operation, at the Kentucky Nursery Stud he bred 129 American Stakes winners. The greatest of the horses he bred was Man o&#x27; War, born while he was serving overseas in World War I. In his absence, his wife Eleanor named the new foal &quot;My Man o&#x27; War&quot; in honor of her husband but because of his age and the uncertainty as to the war&#x27;s end, Belmont Jr. decided to disband the stable and with the &quot;My&quot; dropped from the name, Man o&#x27; War was sold to Glen Riddle Farm in Maryland.

Belmont organized the Westchester Racing Association in 1895. In 1905 he built Belmont Park racetrack in Elmont, on Long Island which operates to this day as the largest thoroughbred racing facility in the state. In the year of its opening, the prestigious Belmont Stakes, inaugurated in 1867 and named in his father&#x27;s honor, was transferred from the financially troubled Morris Park Racecourse. Three times, horses from Belmont&#x27;s stable won the Belmont Stakes, the first coming in 1902 followed by back-to-back wins in 1916 and 1917.

Belmont was a Wright Company stockholder and he was selected to be the president of the 1910 International Aviation Meet at Belmont Park organizing committee. The venue selected for the aviation tournament was August Belmont&#x27;s racetrack at Belmont Park.

Belmont also had horses competing in England and in 1908 his American-bred colt Norman III won a British Classic Race, the 2,000 Guineas. In addition to his Kentucky horse farm, in 1908 Belmont established Haras de Villers, a breeding operation near Foucarmont in Upper Normandy, France. Following the cessation of racing in New York State as a result of the Hart–Agnew Law banning parimutuel betting, Belmont stood American stallions at Haras de Villers such as Flint Rock, Ethelbert, and the sire of Norman III, Octagon. At his French farm, he bred notable horses such as Prix de Diane winner Qu&#x27;elle est Belle as well as Vulcain, one of the best three-year-olds of his generation in France.

Belmont operated the Kentucky farm until his death in 1924 after which the business was broken up and its bloodstock sold. According to &quot;Thoroughbred Heritage&quot;, today the property is home to a condominium development. Its horse cemetery, which became part of Hurstland Farm then the Nuckols Farm, is now occupied by the Rood &amp; Riddle Equine Hospital.

His son Raymond owned Belray Farm near Middleburg, Virginia, where the Hall of Fame horse Colin lived out his final years, dying there in 1932 at the age of 27.

==Club president==

In 1893 Belmont became president of the New York Athletic Club. 
In 1888 he became the American Kennel Club&#x27;s fourth president.

==Marriages==
In 1881, Belmont married childhood sweetheart and next-door neighbor, Elizabeth Hamilton Morgan (1862–1898). They had three sons together, August III (1882–1919), Raymond II (1888–1934), and Morgan Belmont (1892–1953). Elizabeth died at age thirty-six while visiting Paris, France, in 1898. A widower for twelve years, on February 26, 1910, Belmont married actress Eleanor Robson.

==Death==
He spent his last years on his estate in North Babylon, New York. He died on December 10, 1924, at his apartment at 550 Park Avenue. and was buried in the Belmont family plot at Island Cemetery in Newport, Rhode Island, along with his parents and his brother Perry Belmont.

His widow, Eleanor, then sold most of the estate to a property developer. She outlived her husband by fifty-five years, dying just before her 100th birthday in 1979. The remaining , including the family mansion, lake, and main farm buildings, were taken over by New York State. Under the control of planner Robert Moses, the estate was later expanded to and turned into Belmont Lake State Park. The mansion served as headquarters for the Long Island State Park Commission until 1935, when it was demolished to make way for the current building. Two lines of pine trees that formerly surrounded the mansion&#x27;s driveway are preserved in the median of the Southern State Parkway.

<doc id="520950" wikidata="Q291886" url="?curid=520950" title="Dinosaur Comics">
<text>Dinosaur Comics is a constrained webcomic by Canadian writer Ryan North. It is also known as &quot;Qwantz&quot;, after the site&#x27;s domain name, &quot;qwantz.com&quot;. The first comic was posted on February 1, 2003, although there were earlier prototypes. &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot; has also been printed in three collections and in a number of newspapers. The comic centers on three main characters, T-Rex, Utahraptor and Dromiceiomimus.

Comics are posted every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Every strip uses the same artwork and panel layout; only the dialogue changes from day to day. There are occasional deviations from this principle, including a number of episodic comics. North created the comic because it was something he&#x27;d &quot;long wanted to do but couldn’t figure out how to accomplish... [he doesn&#x27;t] draw, so working in a visual medium like comics isn’t the easiest thing to stumble into.&quot;

==Cast==
*T-Rex, the main character that appears in all six panels.
*Utahraptor, T-Rex&#x27;s comic foil, appears in the fourth and fifth panels of the comic.
*Dromiceiomimus appears in the third panel. She is generally friendly to T-Rex, answering either neutrally or with mild, friendly criticism.

* The tiny woman in panel four and the house in panel three have contributed dialogue but are usually silent.
* Other unseen characters occasionally contribute dialogue. For example, &quot;God&quot; speaks from off panel in bold all-caps, &quot;Satan&quot; speaks from off panel in dark red all-caps, and T-Rex&#x27;s sinister neighbours (raccoons and cephalopods) speak in italicized all-caps from off panel.

== Creation ==
Ryan North started &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot; during his last year of his undergraduate degree. In a 2016 interview, he said he &quot;wanted to do something with comics [but] I couldn&#x27;t draw — still can&#x27;t draw. I didn&#x27;t realize that there was such a thing as writers in comics. I thought it was all one person.&quot; At about the same time as he came up with the concept of a fixed-art comic, North received a school assignment to, as he described it, &quot;do something interesting with the Internet.&quot; He was assigned a group, and his group was given the URL qwantz.com. After some time, his group had done nothing and North decided to upload some comics to the site. The first &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot; strip was posted on February 1, 2003 and was called &quot;Today is a beautiful day.&quot; 

All the comics are six-panel strips, using clip art that North found on a CD he had purchased. Every strip uses the same art, with occasional exceptions, such as the mirror universe comics which uses the art but reversed.

==Reception==
&quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot; has received several awards and recognitions. It was named one of the best webcomics of 2004 and 2005 by The Webcomics Examiner. &quot;Wired&quot; listed &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot; as one of &quot;Five Webcomics You Can Share With Your Kids&quot; and &quot;PC Magazine&quot; included the comic in its &quot;10 Wicked Awesome Webcomics&quot; list. Cracked.com named &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot; one of the 8 funniest webcomics on the internet.

In 2005, it won &quot;Outstanding Anthropomorphic Comic&quot; in the Web Cartoonist&#x27;s Choice Awards. Soon after, in August 2005, &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot; was accepted into the Dayfree Press. In 2006, the blook &quot;Dinosaur Comics: Huge Eyes, Beaks, Intelligence, and Ambition&quot; was a runner up for the Lulu Blooker Prize for comics.

<doc id="520956" wikidata="Q5563727" url="?curid=520956" title="Foil (narrative)">
<text>In any narrative, a foil is a character who contrasts with another character, typically, a character who contrasts with the protagonist, in order to better highlight or differentiate certain qualities of the protagonist. A foil to the protagonist may also be the antagonist of the plot.

In some cases, a subplot can be used as a foil to the main plot. This is especially true in the case of metafiction and the &quot;story within a story&quot; motif.

A foil usually either differs dramatically or is an extreme comparison that is made to contrast a difference between two things. Thomas F. Gieryn places these uses of literary foils into three categories, which Tamara A. P. Metze explains as: those that emphasize the &quot;heightened contrast&quot; (this is different because ...), those that operate by &quot;exclusion&quot; (this is not X because...), and those that assign &quot;blame&quot; (&quot;due to the slow decision-making procedures of government...&quot;).

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;foil&quot; comes from the old practice of backing gems with foil to make them shine more brightly.

Shakespeare refers directly to the origin of the term &quot;foil&quot; in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;. Prince Hal says that when he starts behaving better, the change will impress people:
&quot;And like bright metal on a sullen ground/
My reformation, glittering o&#x27;er my fault/
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes/
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.&quot;

==Examples from literature==

In Emily Brontë&#x27;s 1847 novel &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, Edgar Linton is described as opposite to main character Heathcliff, in looks, money, inheritance and morals, however similar in their love for Catherine.

In &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot;, an 1818 novel by Mary Shelley, the two main characters—Dr. Frankenstein and his &quot;creature&quot;—are literary foils to each other, functioning to compare one to the other.

In &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, an 1850 novel by Charles Dickens, Edward Murdstone&#x27;s marriage to David&#x27;s mother Clara, contrasts with David&#x27;s future marriage to Dora Spenlow, presented with a different outcome if David had endeavored to subdue his wife&#x27;s caprices, as did Edward Murdstone with Clara&#x27;s.

In Jane Austen&#x27;s 1813 novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Mary&#x27;s absorption in her studies places her as a foil to her sister Elizabeth Bennet&#x27;s lively and distracted nature.

Similarly, in William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, the character Brutus has foils in the two characters Cassius and Mark Antony. In the play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Romeo and Mercutio serve as character foils for one another, as well as Macbeth and Banquo in the play &quot;Macbeth&quot;. In the tragedy &quot;Hamlet&quot;, a foil is created between Laertes and Prince Hamlet to elaborate the differences between the two men. In Act V Scene 2, Prince Hamlet tells Laertes that he will fence with him and states, &quot;I&#x27;ll be your foil, Laertes&quot; (5.2.272). This word play reveals the foil between Hamlet and Laertes that was developed throughout the play.

George and Lennie are foils to each other in John Steinbeck&#x27;s 1937 novella &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;. Lennie is huge and strong as a bull but mentally slow, while George is small, skinny and very smart.

In Frank Herbert&#x27;s 1965 science fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot;, Feyd-Rautha serves as the narrative foil to Paul Atreides. While both characters are heirs of powerful noble houses, feature in the plans of the Bene Gesserit, and have received extensive combat training, Paul is compassionate and wishes to avoid war while Feyd is portrayed as interested solely in the acquisition of power. 

In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, Draco Malfoy can be seen as a foil to the Harry Potter character; Professor Snape enables both characters &quot;to experience the essential adventures of self-determination&quot; but they make different choices; Harry chooses to oppose Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters wholeheartedly, whereas Draco struggles with his allegiances through the whole series.

<text>Frank, Viscount De Winne (born 25 April 1961, in Ledeberg, Belgium) is a Belgian Air Component officer and an ESA astronaut. He is Belgium&#x27;s second person in space (after Dirk Frimout). He was the first ESA astronaut to command a space mission when he served as commander of ISS Expedition 21. ESA astronaut de Winne serves currently as Head of the European Astronaut Centre of the European Space Agency in Cologne/Germany (Köln).

==Education==
De Winne graduated in 1979 from the Royal School of Cadets in Lier. In 1984, he graduated from the Royal Military Academy with the degree of Master of Sciences in Engineering (Polytechnics).

==Military career==
De Winne followed the elementary flying school of the Belgian Air Component at Goetsenhoven. After graduating he flew Dassault Mirage 5 airplanes for the Air Force until he was attached to SAGEM in Paris to work on the safety of the Mirage. In 1991, De Winne completed the Staff Course at the Defence College in Brussels with the highest distinction. In 1992, De Winne received his degree as test pilot from the British Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School in Boscombe Down, receiving the &quot;McKenna Trophy&quot; as well.

From December 1992, Major of Royal Belgian Air Component De Winne operated as a test pilot for the Belgian Air Force. From January 1994 until April 1995, he was responsible for flight safety of the &quot;1st Fighter Wing&quot; operating from Beauvechain air base. From April 1995 to July 1996, he was attached as senior test pilot to the European Participating Air Forces at Edwards Air Force Base in California where he worked on the mid-life update of the F-16 aircraft, focusing on radar testing. From 1996 to August 1998, he was senior test pilot in the Belgian Air Force, responsible for all test programmes and for all pilot-vehicle interfaces for future aircraft/software updates.

On 12 February 1997 De Winne encountered engine problems while flying in an F-16 Fighting Falcon over densely populated area near Leeuwarden. After the onboard computer failed, De Winne was faced with the choice of crashing in the IJsselmeer or of ejecting over densely populated area. However, De Winne was able to land his crippled plane at Leeuwarden air base, a feat which earned him the &quot;Joe Bill Dryden Semper Viper Award&quot;, the first non-American ever to get this award.

In August 1998, De Winne became commander of the 349 Squadron operating from Kleine Brogel. During the NATO Operation Allied Force in the Balkans, De Winne commanded the Dutch-Belgian &quot;Deployable Air Task Force&quot;. He completed 17 combat sorties. For his achievement during this operation, the Dutch government awarded him the degree of Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau.

De Winne has collected over 2.300 flying hours in Mirage, F-16, Tornado and Jaguar. He also serves as the Chairman of the Belgian Armed Forces Flying Personnel Association.

He currently holds the rank of Brigadier-General.

==Astronaut career==

In October 1998, Frank De Winne was selected as an astronaut candidate by the European Space Agency. In January 2000, he joined the European Astronaut Corps, whose homebase is the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany. He provided technical support for the X38 Crew Return Vehicle project division within the Directorate of Manned Spaceflight and Microgravity, located at the European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. In August 2001, De Winne took up training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonauts Training Center near Moscow, Russia. Training included elements of Basic Training for the International Space Station as well as training as a Soyuz flight engineer.

De Winne&#x27;s first spaceflight (30 October - 10 November 2002) was a trip as a flight engineer to the International Space Station in 2002, traveling to the station aboard Soyuz TMA-1 and returning aboard Soyuz TM-34. During his time in space, De Winne carried out successfully a programme of 23 experiments in the fields of life and physical sciences and education.

He was the back-up crew member for Léopold Eyharts of ISS Expedition 16.

On 20 September 2007 ESA announced that De Winne would take part in a six-month mission aboard the International Space Station in 2009. On 21 November 2008, NASA announced changes to the Expedition schedule, with De Winne becoming Commander of Expedition 21. On 27 May 2009 De Winne launched aboard Soyuz TMA-15, becoming the first astronaut from the European Space Agency to command a space mission.

<doc id="520969" wikidata="Q2361299" url="?curid=520969" title="Arial Unicode MS">
<text>Arial Unicode MS is a TrueType font and the extended version of the font Arial. Compared to Arial, it includes higher line height, omits kerning pairs and adds enough glyphs to cover a large subset of Unicode 2.1—thus supporting most Microsoft code pages, but also requiring much more storage space (22 megabytes). It also adds Ideographic layout tables, but unlike Arial, it mandates no smoothing in the 14–18 point range, and contains Roman (upright) glyphs only; there is no oblique (italic) version. Arial Unicode MS was previously distributed with Microsoft Office, but this ended in 2016 version. It is bundled with Mac OS X v10.5 and later. It may also be purchased separately (as &quot;Arial Unicode&quot;) from Ascender Corporation, who licenses the font from Microsoft.

When rendered with the same engine and without making adjustments for the different font metrics, the glyphs that appear in both Arial and Arial Unicode MS appear to be slightly wider, and thus rounder, in Arial Unicode MS. Horizontal text may also appear to have more inter-line spacing in Arial Unicode MS. This is due to larger bounding boxes (Arial Unicode MS needs more room for some of its extended glyphs) and the limitations of renderers, not changes in the glyph shapes. The lack of kerning pairs in Arial Unicode MS may also affect inter-glyph spacing in some renderers (for example the Adobe Flash Player).

Arial Unicode MS also includes Hebrew glyphs different from the Hebrew glyphs found in Arial. They are based on the shapes of the Hebrew glyphs in Tahoma, but are adjusted to the weight, proportions and style of Arial.

==History and availability==
Arial was designed by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders in 1982 and was released as TrueType font in 1990. From 1993 to 1999, it was extended as Arial Unicode MS (with its first release as a TrueType font in 1998) by the following members of Monotype Typography&#x27;s Monotype Type Drawing Office, under contract to Microsoft: Brian Allen, Evert Bloemsma, Jelle Bosma, Joshua Hadley, Wallace Ho, Kamal Mansour, Steve Matteson, and Thomas Rickner.

From mid-2001 through mid-2002, Arial Unicode MS was also available as a separate download for licensed users of the standalone version of Microsoft Publisher 2000 SR-1, which did not ship with the font. The freely downloadable version was withdrawn after Microsoft Publisher 2002, which included the font, began shipping. The withdrawal coincided with the withdrawal of the free downloads of Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Core fonts for the Web&quot;. Numerous companies, organizations, educational establishments and even governments were directing users to the download without referencing the need for a valid Publisher or Office license or any Microsoft operating system.

Monotype Imaging still owns the Arial and Arial Unicode MS trademarks, but Microsoft once retained exclusive licensing rights to the fonts.

On 11 April 2005, Ascender Corporation announced it had entered an agreement with Microsoft which enables Ascender to distribute Microsoft fonts, including the Windows Core Fonts, the Microsoft Web Fonts and the many multilingual fonts currently supplied by Microsoft. Called &quot;Arial Unicode&quot;, it is sold for approximately $99 per 5 users.

The font is also apparently licensed to Apple, who announced on October 16, 2007 that their flagship operating system, Mac OS X v10.5 (&quot;Leopard&quot;), would be bundled with Arial Unicode. Leopard also ships with several other previously Microsoft-only fonts, including Microsoft Sans Serif, Tahoma and Wingdings.

Monotype Imaging currently also licenses Arial Unicode on its own. It was also bundled by Monotype as part of iPhone Compatibility Font Set.

Arial Unicode MS is no longer available in Microsoft Office 2016, as it has been judged to no longer be suitable as a fallback font.

It covers all code points containing non-control characters in Unicode 2.0 and allows only preview and print embedding.

Version 0.86 has the same coverage and support as 0.84.

Versions 1.00 and 1.01 were supplied with Microsoft Office 2002 (Microsoft Office XP), Microsoft Office 2003 and the standalone versions of those suites&#x27; applications. It includes 50,377 glyphs (38,917 characters), which reduces Combining Diacritical Marks to 72, increases Miscellaneous Technical characters to 123, increases Private Use Area characters to 43, reduces Spacing Modifier Letters to 57. Code page 1361 (Korean Johab) was added. It adds layout tables for Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kana (Hiragana &amp; Katakana), Kannada, and Tamil. Its Han Ideographic tables were updated to support vertical writing. It covers all code points containing non-control characters in Unicode 2.1 and allows editable embedding.

==Bugs==

All versions of Arial Unicode MS deal with double-width diacritic characters incorrectly, drawing them too far to the left by one character width. According to the Unicode Standard 4.0.0, section 7.7 combining double diacritics go between the two characters to be marked. However, to make text look correct in Arial Unicode MS, the double-width diacritic must be placed after both characters to be marked. This means that it is not possible to make text that renders these characters correctly in both Arial Unicode MS and in other (correctly designed) Unicode fonts. This bug affects the rendering of text written in the International Phonetic Alphabet and in ALA-LC Romanization for non-Latin-script languages. If the displayed font in your browser draws the diacritics correctly, they should appear over the characters: k͠p, k͡p.
Furthermore, halves of double-width diacritics are rendered as spacing characters.

The minuscule letters that form the ligatures fi, fl, ffi, ffl, long st, and st are not connected, except for the two f&#x27;s in the ffi and ffl ligatures. As there is no semantic difference, nothing mandates that these must be connected, and they are indistinguishable from the individual letters placed next to each other.

Arial Unicode MS is unable to render some Arabic characters, particularly those used in Sindhi, in their connected forms, showing only their isolated forms instead.

==Arial Unicode Bold (2011)==
On December 14, 2011, Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc. announced the release of Arial Unicode Bold, under the name Arial Unicode MS Bold.

<doc id="520975" wikidata="Q364135" url="?curid=520975" title="Ralph Bellamy">
<text>Ralph Rexford Bellamy (June 17, 1904 – November 29, 1991) was an American actor whose career spanned 65 years on stage, film, and television. During his career, he played leading roles as well as supporting roles, garnering acclaim and awards, including a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot; as well as Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination for &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; (1937). In 1986, Bellamy was awarded with Academy Honorary Award &quot;for his unique artistry and his distinguished service to the profession of acting.&quot;

He gained prominence for his roles in &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot; (1938), &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940), &quot;Flight Angels&quot; (1940), &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941), and &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot; (1960). He is also known for his later roles in &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968), &quot;Oh, God!&quot; (1977), &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), and &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990).

==Early life==
Bellamy was born in Chicago. He was the son of Lilla Louise (née Smith), a native of Canada, and Charles Rexford Bellamy. He ran away from home when he was 15 and managed to gain employment in a road show. He toured with road shows before finally landing in New York City. He began acting on stage there and, by 1927, owned his own theater company. In 1931, he made his film debut and worked constantly throughout the decade both as a lead and as a capable supporting actor. He co-starred in five films with Fay Wray.

==Career==

His film career began with &quot;The Secret Six&quot; (1931), starring Wallace Beery and featuring Jean Harlow and Clark Gable. By the end of 1933, he had already appeared in 22 movies, including &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot; (1932) and the second lead in the action film &quot;Picture Snatcher&quot; with James Cagney (1933). He played in seven more films in 1934 alone, including &quot;Woman in the Dark&quot;, based on a Dashiell Hammett story, in which Bellamy played the lead, second billed under Fay Wray. Bellamy received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; (1937) with Irene Dunne and Cary Grant, and played a similar part, that of a naive boyfriend competing with Grant&#x27;s sophisticated character, in &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940). He portrayed detective Ellery Queen in a few films during the 1940s, but as his film career did not progress, he returned to the stage, where he continued to perform throughout the 1950s. Bellamy appeared in other movies during this time, including &quot;Dance, Girl, Dance&quot; (1940) with Maureen O&#x27;Hara and Lucille Ball, and the horror classic &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941) with Lon Chaney Jr. and Evelyn Ankers. He also appeared in &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein&quot; (1942) with Chaney and Bela Lugosi.

Bellamy appeared on Broadway as Franklin Delano Roosevelt in &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot;, winning a Tony Award for the role in 1957. He reprised the role in the 1960 film version.

In the summer of 1961, Bellamy hosted nine original episodes of &quot;Frontier Justice&quot;. In 1950, Bellamy became a member of The Lambs, an actors club located in New York.

Bellamy appeared in &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; (&quot;The Vintage Years&quot;, 1962) as Daniel Quint, a minister. In the story, a young woman whom Quint befriends on a stagecoach ride, Lorna Erickson (Merry Anders), sets him up to be robbed by her paramour (William Bryant).

Highly regarded within the industry, Bellamy served four terms as the president of Actors&#x27; Equity from 1952 to 1964. On film, Bellamy starred in &quot;The Professionals&quot; (1966) as an oil tycoon, and in Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968) as an evil physician. He turned to television during the 1970s. He played many roles in numerous shows, sometimes as a series regular. In 1970, he played the lead role of Ethan Arcane in the series &quot;The Most Deadly Game&quot;. Bellamy portrayed Adlai Stevenson in the TV movie &quot;The Missiles of October&quot; (1974), a treatment of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was a member of the cast of the short-lived series &quot;Hunter&quot; in 1977.

An Emmy Award nomination for the mini-series &quot;The Winds of War&quot; (1983)—in which Bellamy reprised his &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot; role of Franklin D. Roosevelt—brought him back into the spotlight. This role was followed by his role as Randolph Duke, a conniving millionaire commodities trader in &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983). The Eddie Murphy film &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988) included a brief cameo by Bellamy and Don Ameche, reprising their roles as the Duke brothers. Around this time, he again portrayed Franklin Roosevelt in &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1988), the sequel to &quot;The Winds of War&quot;.

Among his later roles was an appearance as a once-brilliant but increasingly senile lawyer sadly skewered by Jimmy Smits&#x27; character on an episode of &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. Bellamy continued working regularly and gave his final performance in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990).

==Personal life==
Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Bellamy was seen socially with a select circle of friends known affectionately as the Irish Mafia, but they preferred the less sensational Boy&#x27;s Club as its name. This group consisted of a group of Hollywood A-listers who were mainly of Irish descent (despite Bellamy having no Irish family connections). Others included James Cagney, Pat O&#x27;Brien, Spencer Tracy, Lynne Overman, Frank Morgan and Frank McHugh. Bellamy opened the Palm Springs Racquet Club in Palm Springs, California, with fellow actor Charles Farrell in 1934.

Bellamy was married four times: first to Alice Delbridge (1927–1930), then to Catherine Willard (1931–1945) and organist Ethel Smith (1945–1947). Bellamy&#x27;s fourth wife was Alice Murphy (1949–1991; his death).

A Democrat, Bellamy was in attendance at the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.

==Death==
On November 29, 1991, Bellamy died from a lung ailment at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. He was 87 years old.

==Awards and honors==
In 1984, Bellamy was presented with a Life Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild, and in 1987, he received an Honorary Academy Award &quot;for his unique artistry and his distinguished service to the profession of acting.&quot; Bellamy has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6542 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1992, a Golden Palm Star on the Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

In a 2007 episode of &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, footage of &quot;The Defender&quot;, a 1957 episode of &quot;Studio One&quot;, was used. The episode featured Bellamy and William Shatner as a father-and-son lawyer duo. This was used in the present day to explain the relationship between Shatner&#x27;s Denny Crane character and his father in the show.

<text>Lamium purpureum (from Latin &quot;purpureum&quot; – purple), known as red dead-nettle, purple dead-nettle, or purple archangel, is an annual herbaceous flowering plant. It is native to Eurasia but can also be found in North America.

==Description==
&quot;Lamium purpureum&quot; grows with square stems to , rarely 40 cm, in height. The leaves have fine hairs, are green at the bottom and shade to purplish at the top; they are long and broad, with a 1–2 cm petiole (leaf stalk), and wavy to serrated margins.

The zygomorphic flowers are bright red-purple, with a top hood-like petal, two lower lip petal lobes and minute fang-like lobes between. The corolla shows a line of hairs near the base of the tube. They may be produced throughout the year, including mild weather in winter.

===Phytochemistry===
The essential oil is characterized by its high contents of germacrene D. The seed oil contains 16% of an acid characterized as (−)-octadeca-5,6-trans-16-trienoic acid (trivial name `lamenallenic acid&#x27;). Other unsaturated esters identified by their cleavage products are oleate, linoleate and linolenate.

The plant contains phenylethanoid glycosides named lamiusides A, B, C, D and E. It possesses a flavonol 3-O-glucoside-6″-O-malonyltransferase.

=== Similar species ===
It is often found alongside henbit dead-nettle (&quot;Lamium amplexicaule&quot;), for which it is easily mistaken, because the two species bear not only similar leaves, but also similar bright purple flowers. They can, however, be distinguished from one another by the form of the leaves on their respective flowering stems: those of red dead-nettle are petiolate, while those of henbit dead-nettle are sessile.

Though superficially similar to species of &quot;Urtica&quot; (true nettles) in appearance, &quot;L. purpureum&quot; is not related to them, the genus &quot;Lamium&quot; belonging to the mint family, not the nettle family, the &quot;dead&quot; in the name &quot;dead-nettle&quot; referring to the inability of &quot;Lamium&quot; species to sting.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Lamium purpureum&quot; was described and named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It is the type species of genus &quot;Lamium&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Lamium purpureum&quot; is native to Europe and Asia but it can also be found in North America.

It is a common weed in the western and eastern United States, Canada, Ireland, and the British Isles. It frequently occurs in meadows, forest edges, roadsides and gardens.

==Ecology==
The year-round flowers allow bees to gather their nectar for food when few other nectar sources are available. It is also a prominent source of pollen for bees in March/April (in UK), when bees need the pollen as protein to build up their nest. The pollen is crimson red in colour and thus very noticeable on the heads of the bees that visit its flowers.

==Uses==
Young plants have edible tops and leaves, used in salads or in stir-fry as a spring vegetable. If finely chopped it can also be used in sauces. The flowers can be crystallized using sugar and egg white.

The herb has a venerable pedigree in the folk medicine of England, featuring as it does as one of three medicinal/symbolic plants called for in the Anglo-Saxon herb charm Wið færstice (meaning &#x27;against a sudden/violent stabbing pain&#x27;). The charm in question (dating, according to scholarly consensus, probably from the late ninth century) calls for the three herbs involved (the other two being feverfew and plantain) to be heated in butter to prepare an ointment, which is then rubbed on the site of the pain with the blade of a knife, while the lengthy charm is recited by the folk practitioner, who thereby aligns herself (or himself) with the patient – in contradistinction to the evil supernatural beings believed to have caused the pain with their magical arrows.

To this day, herbalists use red dead-nettle in many herbal remedies. One of these is a salve prepared from the plant which can be used topically to soothe irritated, itchy, or sore skin. Studies show a strong antioxidant effect.

<text>Trading Places is a 1983 American comedy film directed by John Landis and written by Timothy Harris and Herschel Weingrod. Starring Dan Aykroyd, Eddie Murphy, Ralph Bellamy, Don Ameche, Denholm Elliott, and Jamie Lee Curtis, the film tells the story of an upper-class commodities broker (Aykroyd) and a poor street hustler (Murphy) whose lives cross when they are unwittingly made the subjects of an elaborate bet to test how each man will perform when their life circumstances are swapped.

Harris conceived the outline for &quot;Trading Places&quot; in the early 1980s after meeting two wealthy brothers who were engaged in an ongoing rivalry with each other. He and his writing partner Weingrod developed the idea as a project to star Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. When they were unable to participate, Landis cast Aykroyd—with whom he had worked previously—and a young but increasingly popular Murphy in his second feature-film role. Landis also cast Curtis against the intent of the studio, Paramount Pictures; she was famous mainly for her roles in horror films, which were looked down upon at the time. Principal photography took place from December1982 to March1983, entirely on location in Philadelphia and New York City. Elmer Bernstein scored the film, using Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s opera buffa &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; as an underlying theme.

&quot;Trading Places&quot; was considered a box-office success on its release, earning over $90.4 million to become the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1983 in the United States and Canada, and $120.6million worldwide. It received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the central cast and the film&#x27;s revival of the 1930s and 1940s screwball comedy genre, though they criticized &quot;Trading Places&quot; for lacking the genre&#x27;s moral message and instead promoting the accumulation of wealth. It received multiple award nominations including an Academy Award for Bernstein&#x27;s score and won two BAFTA awards for Elliott and Curtis. The film also launched or revitalized the careers of its main cast, who each appeared in several other films throughout the 1980s. In particular, Murphy became one of the highest-paid and most sought after comedians in Hollywood.

In the years since its release, the film has been praised as one of the greatest comedy films and Christmas films ever made despite some criticism of its use of racial jokes and language. In 2010, the film was referenced in Congressional testimony concerning the reform of the commodities trading market designed to prevent the insider trading demonstrated in &quot;Trading Places&quot;. In 1988, Bellamy and Ameche reprised their characters for Murphy&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Coming to America&quot;.

==Plot==
Brothers Randolph and Mortimer Duke own a commodities brokerage firm, Duke &amp; Duke Commodity Brokers, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They witness an encounter between their managing director—the well-mannered and educated Louis Winthorpe III, engaged to the Dukes&#x27; grandniece Penelope Witherspoon—and poor black street hustler Billy Ray Valentine. Valentine is arrested at Winthorpe&#x27;s insistence after the latter assumes he is being robbed. Holding opposing views on the issue of nature versus nurture, the Dukes make a wager and agree to conduct an experiment to observe the results of switching the lives of Valentine and Winthorpe, two people in contrasting social strata.

Winthorpe is framed as a thief, drug dealer, and philanderer by Clarence Beeks, a man on the Dukes&#x27; payroll. He is fired from Duke &amp; Duke, his bank accounts are frozen, he is denied entry to his Duke-owned home, and is ostracized by his friends and Penelope. Winthorpe is befriended by Ophelia, a prostitute who helps him in exchange for a financial reward once he is exonerated to secure her own retirement. The Dukes post bail for Valentine, install him in Winthorpe&#x27;s former job, and grant him use of Winthorpe&#x27;s home. Valentine becomes well versed in the business, using his street smarts to achieve success, and begins to act in a well-mannered way.

During the firm&#x27;s Christmas party, Winthorpe plants drugs in Valentine&#x27;s desk, attempting to frame him, and brandishes a gun to escape. Later, the Dukes discuss their experiment and settle their wager for $1. They plot to return Valentine to the streets, but have no intention of taking back Winthorpe. Valentine overhears the conversation and seeks out Winthorpe, who has attempted suicide by overdosing. Valentine, Ophelia, and Winthorpe&#x27;s butler Coleman nurse him back to health and inform him of the experiment. Watching a television news broadcast, they learn that Beeks is transporting a secret United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) report on orange crop forecasts. Remembering large payments made to Beeks by the Dukes, Winthorpe and Valentine decide to foil the brothers&#x27; plan to obtain the report early and use it to corner the market on frozen concentrated orange juice.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve, the four board Beeks&#x27; train in disguise, intending to switch the original report with a forgery that predicts low orange crop yields. Beeks uncovers their scheme and attempts to kill them, but is knocked unconscious by a gorilla being transported on the train. The four dress him in a gorilla suit and cage him with the real gorilla. They deliver the forged report to the Dukes in Beeks&#x27; place and collect the payment intended for him. After sharing a kiss with Ophelia, Winthorpe travels to New York City with Valentine, pooling the money with the life savings of Ophelia and Coleman to carry out their plan.

On the commodities trading floor, the Dukes invest heavily in buying frozen concentrated orange juice futures contracts, legally committing themselves to purchase the commodity at a later date. Other traders follow their lead, driving the price up; Valentine and Winthorpe short-sell juice futures contracts at the inflated price. Following the broadcast of the actual crop report and its prediction of a normal harvest, the price of juice futures plummets. As the traders frantically sell their futures, Valentine and Winthorpe buy at the lower price from everyone except the Dukes, fulfilling the contracts they had short-sold earlier and turning an immense profit.

After the closing bell, Valentine and Winthorpe explain to the Dukes that they made a wager on whether they could get rich and make the Dukes poor at the same time, and Winthorpe pays Valentine his winnings of $1. When the Dukes prove unable to pay the $394million required to satisfy their margin call, the exchange manager orders their seats sold and their corporate and personal assets confiscated, effectively bankrupting them. Randolph collapses holding his chest and Mortimer shouts at the others, demanding the floor be reopened in a futile plea to recoup their losses.

The now-wealthy Valentine, Winthorpe, Ophelia, and Coleman vacation on a luxurious tropical beach, while Beeks and the gorilla are loaded onto a ship bound for Africa.

As well as the main cast, &quot;Trading Places&quot; features Robert Curtis-Brown as Todd, Winthorpe&#x27;s romantic rival for Penelope; Alfred Drake as the Securities Exchange manager; and Jim Belushi as Harvey, a party-goer on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The film has numerous cameos, including singer Bo Diddley as a pawnbroker; Curtis&#x27; sister Kelly as Penelope&#x27;s friend Muffy; the Muppets puppeteers Frank Oz and Richard Hunt as, respectively, a police officer and Wilson, the Dukes&#x27; broker on the trading floor; and Aykroyd&#x27;s former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; colleagues, Tom Davis and Al Franken, as train baggage handlers.

Other minor roles include Ron Taylor as &quot;Big Black Guy&quot;, American football player J. T.

The gorilla is portrayed by mime Don McLeod.

==Production==
===Writing and development===
In the early 1980s, writer Timothy Harris often played tennis against two wealthy, but frugal brothers who regularly engaged in a competitive rivalry and betting. Following one session, Harris returned home exasperated with the pair&#x27;s conflict and concluded that they were &quot;awful&quot; people. The situation gave him the idea of two brothers betting over nature versus nurture in terms of human ability. Harris shared the idea with his writing partner Herschel Weingrod, who liked the concept. Harris also drew inspiration for the story from his own living situation; he lived in a rundown area near Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles. He described the area in grim terms as crime-ridden, where everyone either had a gun pointed at them or had been raped.

Harris and Weingrod researched the commodities market for the script. They learned of financial market incidents, including Russian attempts to corner the wheat market and the Hunt brothers&#x27; efforts to corner the silver market on what became known as Silver Thursday. They thought trading orange juice and pork bellies would be funnier because the public would be unaware such mundane items were traded. Harris consulted with people in the commodities business to understand how the film&#x27;s finale on the trading floor would work. The pair determined that the commodities market would make for an interesting setting for a film, as long as it was not about the financial market itself. They needed something to draw the audience in. It was decided to set the story in Philadelphia because of its connections to the founding of the United States, the American dream and idealism and the pursuit of happiness. This was tempered by introducing Billy Ray Valentine as a black man begging on the street. The pair knew that the method of Winthorpe&#x27;s and Valentine&#x27;s financial victory could be confusing, but hoped that audiences would be too invested in the characters&#x27; success to care about the details.

The script was sold to Paramount Pictures under the title &quot;Black and White&quot;. Then-Paramount executive Jeffrey Katzenberg offered the project to director John Landis. Landis disliked the working title, but favorably compared the script to older screwball comedies of the 1930s by directors like Frank Capra, Leo McCarey, and Preston Sturges, which often satirized social constructs and social classes, reflecting the cultural issues of their time. Landis wanted his film to reflect these concepts in the 1980s; he said the main updates were the addition of swearing and nudity. Landis admitted that it took him a while to understand how &quot;Trading Places&quot;″ finale worked.

===Casting===

&quot;Trading Places&quot; was developed with the intent to cast comedy duo Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder as Valentine and Louis Winthorpe III respectively. The pair were in high demand following the success of their comedy film &quot;Stir Crazy&quot; (1980). When Pryor was severely injured after setting fire to himself while freebasing cocaine, the decision was made to cast someone else. Paramount Pictures suggested Eddie Murphy. The studio was initially unhappy with Murphy&#x27;s performance in his first film, the as-then-unreleased action-comedy &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; (1982)—a film also conceived as a Pryor project. However, that film was well received by preview test audiences, leading the studio to reverse its opinion. Landis was unaware of Murphy, who had been gaining fame as a performer on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. After watching Murphy&#x27;s audition tapes, Landis was impressed enough to travel to New York City to meet with him. Murphy said that he was paid $350,000 for the role; it was reported that the figure was as high as $1million.

Landis wanted Dan Aykroyd to serve as Murphy&#x27;s co-star. He had worked previously with Aykroyd on the musical comedy film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980); the experience had been positive. Landis said, &quot;he could easily play [Winthorpe] ... you tell him what you want, and he delivers. And I thought he&#x27;d be wonderful.&quot; Paramount Pictures was less enamored with Aykroyd; executives believed that he performed better as part of a duo, as he had working with John Belushi. They felt that Aykroyd working alone would be akin to Bud Abbott, half of Abbott and Costello, working without Lou Costello and Aykroyd&#x27;s recent films had fared poorly at the box office. Aykroyd agreed to take a pay cut for the role.

The studio also objected to the casting of Jamie Lee Curtis. At the time she was seen as a &quot;scream queen&quot;, primarily associated with low-quality B movies. Landis had worked previously with Curtis on the horror documentary &quot;Coming Soon&quot;, for which she had served as the host. She wanted to move away from horror films as she was conscious that the association would limit her future career prospects. She had turned down a role in the horror film &quot;Psycho II&quot; (1983) because of this. Her mother, Janet Leigh, had famously starred in &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). Curtis had performed recently in the slasher film &quot;Halloween II&quot; (1981) as a favor to director John Carpenter and producer Debra Hill; she was paid $1million for that role, but received only $70,000 for &quot;Trading Places&quot;. When asked if she had researched her role as a prostitute, Curtis jokingly remarked: &quot;I&#x27;d love to say I went out and turned a couple of tricks on 42nd Street, but I didn&#x27;t.&quot; Curtis had long hair when she was cast; costume designer Deborah Nadoolman Landis suggested cutting her hair shorter for the film.

For the greedy Duke brothers, Ralph Bellamy was the first choice for Randolph. For Mortimer, Landis wanted to cast an actor famous in the 1930s or 1940s who was not associated with playing a villain. His first choice was Ray Milland, but the actor was unable to pass a physical test to qualify for insurance while filming. As the start date for filming loomed, Landis thought of Don Ameche. The casting director claimed that Ameche was dead. Landis was skeptical of this and contacted the Screen Actors Guild in an attempt to locate him. They confirmed that Ameche had no agent, and his royalty payments were being forwarded to his son in Arizona. Landis accepted this as evidence that Ameche was deceased. However, after hearing of Landis&#x27; search, one of the Paramount Studios&#x27; secretaries mentioned that they saw Ameche regularly on San Vicente Boulevard in Santa Monica, California. Landis called directory assistance to locate a &quot;D. Ameche&quot; in the area and made contact. Ameche had not featured in a film for over a decade; when asked why, he said that no one had offered him film work. The studio did not want to pay Ameche what Milland had been offered; as Ameche was financially independent and in no need of work, he refused to take the part until he received equal pay. Landis claimed that the studio reduced the film&#x27;s budget, frustrated at Ameche&#x27;s casting after a long absence from film work.

John Gielgud and Ronnie Barker were considered for the role of Winthorpe&#x27;s butler, Coleman. Barker refused to act if it involved filming more than from his home in the United Kingdom. G. Gordon Liddy, a central figure in the Watergate political scandal of the early 1970s, was offered the role of corrupt official Clarence Beeks. Liddy was interested in the offer until he learned that Beeks becomes the romantic partner of a gorilla. Paul Gleason took the role; his character reads a copy of Liddy&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Will&quot; while riding the train. Don McLeod portrayed the gorilla; he had already become popular for his performances as a gorilla in American Tourister commercials, which led to film appearances.

===Filming===

Principal photography began on December13, 1982. The budget was estimated to be $15million. Filming took place on location in Philadelphia and New York City. Robert Paynter and Malcolm Campbell served, respectively, as the film&#x27;s cinematographer and editor.

The script underwent minor changes throughout filming; some improvisation was also encouraged. Changes were normally discussed in advance, but on other occasions, ad-libbed dialogue was considered funny enough to keep. Examples of ad-libs retained in the film include Valentine comparing Randolph to Randy Jackson of The Jackson 5 and demonstrating his &quot;quart of blood&quot; technique in jail. Murphy liked &quot;Trading Places&quot;″ script; he felt it was unlike &quot;48 Hrs.&quot;, which he said had been saved by director Walter Hill. Even so, he changed many of his own lines because he said that a white writer writing for a black person would use stereotypical dialogue like &quot;jive turkey&quot; and &quot;sucker&quot;, and he could write his lines to sound authentic. Weingrod said the studio objected to Murphy&#x27;s line, &quot;Who put their Kools out on my Persian rug?&quot; They believed it was racist because the Kool cigarette brand was targeted mainly at African Americans; Murphy restored the line. Ophelia pretending to be a European exchange student to fool Beeks was also improvised; Curtis used a mix of German attire with a Swedish accent because she could not perform a German accent.

The first fifteen days of filming were spent in Philadelphia. Landis described the weather as freezing. While filming the scene where Randolph and Mortimer collect Valentine from jail, Landis was positioned in a towing truck that pulled the Rolls-Royce carrying Ameche, Bellamy and Murphy. Landis wore a thick parka to stay warm, and the actors had a space heater in their vehicle; Landis listened to their dialogue via radio. Describing the filming of the scene, Landis recalled a jovial discussion between Ameche, Bellamy, and Murphy: Bellamy said that &quot;Trading Places&quot; was his 99th film; Ameche said it was his 100th. Murphy informed Landis that &quot;between the three of us we&#x27;ve made 201 films!&quot; 

Filming locations in Philadelphia included townhouses in Center City that served as the Winthorpe home exterior, and the Philadelphia Mint (now the Community College of Philadelphia) which served as the police station&#x27;s exterior. The exterior and lobby of the Wells Fargo Building serve as the respective exterior and lobby of Duke &amp; Duke. Murphy&#x27;s character, pretending to be crippled, is introduced in Rittenhouse Square. The nearby Curtis Institute of Music, shown as the exterior of the Heritage Club, is seen adjacent to Rittenhouse Park in the film&#x27;s opening. Independence Hall is also featured. During filming in Philadelphia, Murphy was so popular that a police officer had to be stationed outside of his trailer to control the crowds.
Filming moved to New York City in January 1983; many of the interior scenes were filmed there. The Duke &amp; Duke upstairs offices were filmed inside the upstairs of the Seventh Regiment Armory. The interior of the Heritage Club was filmed at the then-abandoned Chamber of Commerce Building.

In late January, two holding cells on the 12th-floor of the New York Supreme Court building at 100 Centre Street were taken over for filming. Empty lockups in police administration buildings would normally be in use but because of the financial investment the production had made filming in the city, the mayor&#x27;s office agreed to accommodate Landis&#x27; request; the studio paid for any expenses incurred. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that for years the Corrections Department had failed to deliver prisoners on time for trials and arraignments; despite this, they moved nearly 300 prisoners through the 12th-floor before 9a.m. on the day of filming.

The scene where Valentine and Winthorpe enact their plan against the Dukes was filmed at the COMEX commodity exchange located inside 4 World Trade Center. The lack of windows gave the appearance the floor was situated below ground, but it was actually on a high floor. The scene was scripted to take place at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but the filmmakers were unable to secure permission to film there. The scene was shot over approximately 3–4 hours a day over two days. It was scheduled to take place during a weekday, but Aykroyd&#x27;s and Murphy&#x27;s presence on the floor distracted the active traders and over $6billion of trading had to be halted; filming was rescheduled for a weekend. A majority of the people on screen are actual traders, along with some extras. Landis said the traders in the film were less physically rough with each other than they were during normal trading. 

Landis also performed some guerrilla filmmaking there for additional footage. Ameche was opposed to using foul language and often apologized in advance to his crewmates for what he was scripted to say; he only performed one take of his final scene where he shouts &quot;fuck him&quot;, referring to Randolph. The final scene shot was of the main characters celebrating on a beach; this was filmed on Saint Croix island in the United States Virgin Islands. Principal photography concluded on March1, 1983, after 78 days.
===Music===

Elmer Bernstein composed the score for &quot;Trading Places&quot;. He and Landis had collaborated previously on several films including &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; and the horror-comedy &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981). Landis conceived of the idea to use the opera buffa &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart as the underlying theme for the score. He had used classical music in his previous films to represent the upper classes and felt that it would be fitting for the pompous elites of the financial industry. &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; concerns the story of a servant who is wronged by his wealthy employer, Count Almaviva, and takes his revenge by unraveling the count&#x27;s own machinations.

Bernstein created his own arrangements of the music to reflect the differing emotions of each scene. The overture of &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot; plays over the film&#x27;s opening. The score also includes arrangements of &quot;Pomp and Circumstance Marches&quot; by Edward Elgar, and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 41&quot;. &quot;Trading Places&quot; features songs including: &quot;Do You Wanna Funk&quot; by Sylvester and Patrick Cowley, &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; by Brenda Lee, &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; by Little Eva, and &quot;Get a Job&quot; by the Silhouettes.
==Release==
===Context===

The summer of 1983 (June–September) was predicted to surpass the previous year&#x27;s record-breaking $1.4billion in theater tickets sold. The season featured expected hits such as the third installment in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, &quot;Superman III&quot;, and the latest James Bond film &quot;Octopussy&quot;. Over 40 films were scheduled for release over the 16-week period. Studios had to strategize their releases to avoid damaging their own films&#x27; performances by pitting them against better-performing competition. Paramount Studios opted to release &quot;Trading Places&quot; at the start of summer, as those films expected to do well would benefit from being in theaters longer during this busy period. Comedy films were considered counterprogramming that attracted audiences who had already seen, or were not interested in, the major film releases that were mainly focused on science-fiction and superheroes. &quot;Trading Places&quot; was released between &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; in May and &quot;Superman III&quot; in mid-June. While sequels were expected to do well having the advantage of a built-in audience, &quot;Trading Places&quot; was predicted to be successful based on its cast.

===Box office===
In the United States (U.S.) and Canada, &quot;Trading Places&quot; received a wide release on Wednesday, June 8, 1983, across 1,375 theaters. The film earned $1.7million leading into its opening weekend when it earned a further $7.3million—an average of $5,344 per theater. &quot;Trading Places&quot; finished as the number three film of the weekend behind &quot;Octopussy&quot; ($8.9million), also making its debut that weekend, and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; ($12million), which was in its third week of release. The film retained the number three position in its second weekend with a further gross of $7million, behind &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; ($11.2million), and the debuting &quot;Superman III&quot; ($13.3million). In its third weekend, it fell to fifth place with $5.5million, behind the debuting science-fiction horror &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; ($6.6million) and sex comedy &quot;Porky&#x27;s II: The Next Day&quot; ($7million), &quot;Superman III&quot; ($9million), and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; ($11.1million).

While the film never claimed the number one box office ranking, it spent seventeen straight weeks among the top ten-highest-grossing films. By September, it was the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year with $80.6million, and by the end of its theatrical run, &quot;Trading Places&quot; earned an approximate box office gross of $90.4million. It finished as the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1983, behind Paramount Studio&#x27;s surprise hit, the romantic drama &quot;Flashdance&quot; ($90.46million), the comedy-drama &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; ($108.4million), and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; ($309.2million). Estimates by industry experts suggest that as of 1997, the box office returns to the studio—minus the theaters&#x27; share—was $40.6million. Outside of the United States and Canada, &quot;Trading Places&quot; is estimated to have earned a further $30.2million, bringing its worldwide gross to $120.6million.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Trading Places&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Reviewers compared it to the socially conscious comedies of the 1930s and 1940s, like &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; (1936), &quot;Easy Living&quot; (1937), &quot;Christmas in July&quot; (1940), and &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1941) by directors like Preston Sturges, Frank Capra, and Gregory La Cava. Janet Maslin said that the &quot;likable&quot; film owed a debt to the screwball comedy genre. She continued, &quot;Preston Sturges might have made a movie like &quot;Trading Places&quot; – if he&#x27;d had a little less inspiration and a lot more money.&quot; Gary Arnold said the film was too inconsistent to be compared to those older films. Vincent Canby said that the screwball style had been updated for the &quot;existential hipness&quot; of the 1980s, but the film lacked the same morality tale the genre often espoused that money is not important. Instead, the characters do not dismantle or expose the corruption of the financial system, they just take revenge on the Dukes, obtaining extreme wealth in the process. Even so, he concluded the film was one of the best American comedies released in a long time. Maslin agreed that the film was too enamored with the wealthy institutions it satirized to provide a true criticism of the system and its failings. She called it the American Dream in film form.

Dave Kehr said that though the film pays homage to screwball comedies, it stripped the concept of all but the &quot;crudest audience-gratification moments&quot; and avoided exploration of the genre&#x27;s moral conflicts. In &quot;Variety&quot;″s review, the reviewer concluded that the middle segment of the film lacked humor. &quot;People&quot; said that the ending was perfectly presented, but Arnold considered it to be confusing and reliant on the audience&#x27;s knowledge that the &quot;heroes&quot; were being heroic to compensate for a lack of clarity in their actions. He continued that even as a farcical film, the events were too unbelievable. Roger Ebert said the ending was inventive for not involving a &quot;manic chase&quot;. He appreciated that &quot;Trading Places&quot; did not rely on obvious racial plot points or employ sitcom tropes for the social-status swaps of Winthorpe and Valentine. He commended the focus on developing each character so that they were funny because of their individual quirks and personalities. He concluded that this required a deeper script than would normally be developed for a comedy.

The cast were all generally praised. Maslin called it a strange but well-cast film representing multiple Hollywood generations. Ebert said that what could have been stereotypical characters were elevated by the actors and the writing, adding that Murphy and Aykroyd made a &quot;perfect&quot; team. Canby said that Murphy demonstrated why he was the most successful comedian in the last decade. Several reviewers compared his role to that in &quot;48 Hrs.&quot;; Arnold said that &quot;Trading Places&quot; was evidence that Murphy&#x27;s successes were not a fluke, and that Murphy demonstrated an &quot;exhilarating comic authority&quot;. Canby said that &quot;Trading Places&quot; gave Murphy an opportunity to demonstrate the range of his abilities in a &quot;lithe, graceful, uproarious&quot; performance.

Reviewers agreed that the film featured Aykroyd&#x27;s best performance to date. &quot;People&quot; said that if audiences had given up on Aykroyd following the failures of &quot;Neighbors&quot; (1981) and &quot;Doctor Detroit&quot; (1983), his career was revitalized by &quot;Trading Places&quot;. Canby said that Aykroyd gave a more consistent performance than in his previous roles. He said that Aykroyd had demonstrated that his success was not dependent upon his partnership with John Belushi. Arnold said that Aykroyd worked best when he shared a central role with another star. Rita Kempley said that his relationship with Murphy was just as enjoyable as his one with Belushi.

&quot;Variety&quot; noted that the supporting cast in Bellamy, Ameche, Elliott and Curtis were essential to the film. Reviewers said that Curtis brought a deft comic ability to the role. Arnold called the role &quot;stale&quot; and &quot;predictable&quot; but felt Curtis offered an &quot;infectious&quot; humor that earns the audience&#x27;s support. &quot;People&quot; said that she had a significant appeal, and Kempley called her both &quot;curvaceous&quot; and &quot;vivacious&quot;. Canby said that in her first major non-horror role, Curtis performed with &quot;marvelous good humor&quot;. Kehr criticized Landis for often turning his heroines into &quot;busty bunnies&quot;, and said that he had treated Curtis the same way. Ebert called Bellamy and Ameche&#x27;s casting a &quot;masterstroke&quot;. Canby said the pair had well-written roles that were supported by their comic performances. He continued that Ameche was as funny in &quot;Trading Places&quot; as he was always meant to be.

&quot;People&quot; said that the film works because Landis demonstrated a &quot;remarkable&quot; restraint. Canby said Landis had shown that he could direct a precise comedy as well as special effects-laden fare. Arnold disagreed saying Landis&#x27; comedic timing was less precise than in his previous work and that he lacked the skill to handle the source material properly. &quot;People&quot; said that Harris and Weingrod had developed a well-written script, but Arnold said they had failed to update the screwball genre to tackle social contrasts in a similar way.

===Accolades===
At the 41st Golden Globe Awards in 1984, the film received two nominations: Best Musical or Comedy (losing to romantic drama &quot;Yentl&quot;) and Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Murphy who lost to Michael Caine&#x27;s performance in the comedy drama &quot;Educating Rita&quot;. At the 56th Academy Awards, Bernstein was nominated for Best Original Score; he lost to Michel Legrand and Alan and Marilyn Bergman, who scored &quot;Yentl&quot;.

The 37th British Academy Film Awards named Elliott and Curtis the Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. Harris and Weingrod were nominated for Best Original Screenplay; they lost to Paul D. Zimmerman for the 1982 black comedy &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;.

==Post-release==
===Performance analysis and aftermath===

As predicted, the 1983 summer film season broke the previous year&#x27;s record with over $1.5billion worth of tickets sold. It was seen as a substantial increase in spite of increased ticket prices. Even so, the year was a mixture of unexpected successes and disappointments. Films like &quot;Superman III&quot; and the action comedies &quot;Smokey and the Bandit Part 3&quot; and &quot;Stroker Ace&quot; had failed at the box office. The science fiction comedy &quot;The Man with Two Brains&quot; featuring an established star in Steve Martin had also underperformed. Conversely, &quot;Flashdance&quot; was an unexpected hit and the third highest-grossing film of the year, despite a negative critical reception. In September, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Trading Places&quot; was the only film of the fifteen top-grossing films that could be recommended without reservation. The film was well-received critically and considered a significant commercial success, along with &quot;Flashdance&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Then-production vice president of MGM/UA studio Peter Bart described it as a &quot;gimmick&quot; film that focused on a &quot;high-concept&quot; over story and characterization. Bart believed its success triggered a negative trend that resulted in him receiving numerous film pitches—often a mix of the high-concept nature of &quot;Trading Places&quot; with a &quot;Flashdance&quot;-inspired breakdancing or gym setting. Harris recalled people asking if the producer Aaron Russo or Katzenberg had created the idea and just paid him to write it. He said he knew it was a success because people were trying to take credit for it.

&quot;Trading Places&quot; is considered responsible for launching, changing, or re-launching the careers of many of its stars. Murphy&#x27;s success was significant. He rose from a TV comedian to a superstar with two of the most successful films of the year. Industry experts voted him as the biggest box-office star after Clint Eastwood. No other African-American actor had achieved a comparable level of success before him. It was reported that Murphy earned up to $1million for &quot;Trading Places&quot;, but by his third film, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984), he commanded a $3million salary. This was considered a top-tier salary reserved for the most popular movie stars.

Shortly after &quot;Trading Places&quot;″ release, Paramount Pictures signed Murphy to a $25million five-film exclusive contract—one of the biggest deals ever with an actor at the time. The studio also agreed to finance his Eddie Murphy Productions studio. Murphy was among several young stars who emerged that year, including Matthew Broderick, Tom Cruise, and Michael Keaton, nearly all of whom were in their 20s. This reflected the fact that average audiences were aging and now in their late teens to early 20s, and led to a shift in focus away from making films targeted mainly at children. His rapid rise to fame led to Murphy leaving &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; the following year; he said he had grown to dislike the job and felt he was resented for his success.

After a series of failures, &quot;Trading Places&quot; revitalized Aykroyd&#x27;s career. Throughout the 1980s, he went on to star in the blockbuster phenomenon &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984), &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; (1985) and &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1987). He earned an Academy Award nomination for his performance in the comedy-drama &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (1989). &quot;Trading Places&quot; is considered Curtis&#x27;s breakout performance, allowing her to move into films outside the horror genre; actor John Cleese cast Curtis in the 1988 heist comedy &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; specifically because of her performance in &quot;Trading Places&quot;. Curtis said Landis had &quot;single-handedly changed the course of my life by giving me that part.&quot; After not having worked in film for more than a decade, Ameche followed &quot;Trading Places&quot; with the 1985 comedy-drama &quot;Cocoon&quot;, for which he won his first and only Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Landis continued to work as a director but suffered setbacks following a lawsuit over the accidental deaths of several actors on a segment he directed for &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; and a succession of moderately successful films. According to Murphy, he hired Landis to direct his 1988 comedy &quot;Coming to America&quot; to help support Landis&#x27;s career. The pair had a falling out on the set of that film; even so, they collaborated again on &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; (1994). Harris and Weingrod were elevated to prominence as writers. They later sued &quot;Trading Places&quot;″ producer, Aaron Russo, for an agreed upon 0.5% of the producer profits share, estimated to be worth $150,000; the outcome of this lawsuit is unknown.

=== Home media ===
In the early 1980s, the VCR home video market was gaining popularity rapidly. In previous years, VHS sales were not a revenue source for studios, but by 1983 they could generate up to 13% of a film&#x27;s total revenue; the North American cassette rights could generate $500,000 alone. &quot;Trading Places&quot; was released on VHS in May 1984, priced at $39.95. Paramount distributed its own cassettes and priced them significantly lower than the standard $80 price to promote home user VCR adoption. A successful film was expected to earn between $5million and $10million on the home video market. In the rental market, &quot;Trading Places&quot; was one of the more popular releases in May, alongside the action thriller &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;. Paramount signed an exclusive deal to show its movies, including &quot;Trading Places&quot;, on the Showtime TV network for approximately $500million; this was seen as an attempt by Paramount to damage the network monopoly held by HBO that the studio saw as financially unfavorable.

&quot;Trading Places&quot; was first released on DVD in October 2002. A Special Collector&#x27;s Edition (also known as the &quot;Looking Good, Feeling Good&quot; edition) was released in 2007 on DVD, Blu-ray, and HD DVD. This edition included deleted scenes, details on the film&#x27;s production, including discussions with the cast and crew, 1983 promotional interviews, and interviews with financial experts about the film. The film was also released in a pack that included &quot;Coming to America&quot;. To celebrate the film&#x27;s 35th-anniversary in 2018, a special edition was released containing a Blu-ray and digital version of the film, and behind-the-scenes featurettes. In November 2023, a 40th Anniversary edition was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray disc. A limited-edition release of Bernstein&#x27;s score was made available in 2011. Only 2,000 copies were released by La-La Land Records.

==Analysis==
===Ending explained===
Several publications have attempted to explain exactly how Valentine and Winthorpe make a large sum of money on the commodities market while simultaneously bankrupting the Dukes. The fake crop report created by Valentine and Winthorpe indicates to the Dukes that the orange crop will be poor, making the limited stock more valuable. The Dukes attempt to buy up as many Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice (FCOJ) futures contracts as possible to corner the market—effectively owning a substantial enough number of contracts that they are able to control the price of FCOJ. The other traders realize what the Dukes are doing and join in buying futures. This demand significantly inflates the price to $1.42 per pound—each future represents several pounds of FCOJ. Winthorpe and Valentine begin selling futures at this inflated price, believing it to be the peak price; the contracts will require them to supply FCOJ in April. Anticipating that the crop report will cause the value of FCOJ to rise far above $1.42, the other brokers purchase heavily from the pair.

Once the real crop report is published indicating that the orange crop will be normal and there will be no shortage of FCOJ, the value of the futures plummets as the traders desperately attempt to sell their futures and limit their financial losses. Winthorpe and Valentine then buy back the futures from the traders—except for the Dukes&#x27; trader Wilson—at the lower price of 29 cents a pound. The difference is their profit. Effectively, they have sold FCOJ which they do not have at a high price and bought it back at a lower price, earning them a profit and eliminating the need to fulfil any contracts. Meanwhile, the Dukes have bought a significant number of FCOJ futures, around 100,000 contracts or 1.5million pounds of FCOJ and have been unable to sell any of them. When trading closes, they must meet the margin call—essentially a deposit—for holding the futures contracts. In addition to their basic financial loss from buying futures at up to $1.42 that are now worth only 29 cents, the margin call for holding the futures gives them a total loss of $394million, which they do not have, requiring the sale of all of their assets.

===Thematic analysis===

The central storyline of &quot;Trading Places&quot;—a member of society trading places with another whose socio-economic status stands in direct contrast to his own—has often been compared to the 1881 novel &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; by Mark Twain. The novel follows the lives of a prince and a beggar who use their uncanny resemblance to each other to switch places temporarily; the prince takes on a life of poverty and misery while the pauper enjoys the lavish luxuries of royal life. &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; is seen as a classic tale of American literature; &quot;Trading Places&quot; adds a twist by casting an African-American as the pauper raised up in status, playing on fears of black usurpation and appropriation. The film has also been compared to Twain&#x27;s 1893 short story “The Million Pound Bank Note”, in which two brothers bet on the outcome of giving an impoverished person an unusable million-pound bank-note. The choice to use Mozart&#x27;s opera buffa &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; also adds meaning. The opera tells the tale of a servant, Figaro, who foils the plans of his wealthy employer to steal his fiancée. When Winthorpe is driven to work during the film&#x27;s opening, he hums &quot;Se vuol ballare&quot;, an aria from &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, in which Figaro declares he will overturn the systems in place. This foreshadows Winthorpe&#x27;s eventual efforts to do the same to the Dukes.

The main theme of &quot;Trading Places&quot; is the consequences of wealth or the lack thereof. Both extremes are depicted by those living in opulent luxury and those trapped in a culture of poverty—a concept arguing that poor people adopt certain behaviors that keep them poor. Harris has described the story as a satire of greed and social conventions, but in the end, the good guys win by becoming extremely rich. Economic inequality is demonstrated by the wealthy who live in luxury. They are completely removed from those whose lives are affected by poverty. This is demonstrated by the Dukes&#x27; bet, showing their own sense of superiority over, and disregard for, the lives of those beneath them, even Winthorpe. Their only reward for the bet is personal pride. Author Carolyn Anderson noted that films often feature an &quot;introduction&quot; scene for characters elevated above their station, like Valentine, to help them understand the rules of their new world. Conversely, there is rarely a complementary scene for those subjected to downward mobility.

Vincent Canby said that although the film is an homage to social satire screwball comedies of the early 20th century, &quot;Trading Places&quot; is a symbol of its time. Where the earlier films espoused the benefits of things other than money, &quot;Trading Places&quot; is built around the value of money and those who aspire to have it. The heroes win by making lots of money; the villains are punished by becoming part of the impoverished. The heroes&#x27; reward is escaping to a tropical island, completely divorced from the poverty-stricken neighborhoods that had previously been their home. Money is demonstrably a solution to all of the problems raised in the film, and when it is taken away, it is shown that people quickly resort to a basic criminal nature. Stephen Schiff wrote that it can be seen as an example of supply-side economics, alongside films like the comedies &quot;Arthur&quot; (1981) and &quot;Risky Business&quot; (1983). While seemingly supporting left-leaning political concepts by arguing that given an equal platform a street-hustler like Valentine can perform Winthorpe&#x27;s job equally well, Schiff argued that the film was still &quot;unconsciously promoting Reaganism&quot; where the accumulation of wealth is highly valued. Harris described one incident where a person told him they had obtained a career in finance because of &quot;Trading Places&quot;; Harris said that this was counter to the film&#x27;s message.

David Budd said &quot;Trading Places&quot; defies expectations of racial stereotypes. Randolph&#x27;s attempts to prove nurture wins over nature demonstrates that Valentine, given the same advantages as Winthorpe, is just as capable, and leaves behind the negative aspects of his former, unfair life. Even so, once the Dukes&#x27; bet is complete, Mortimer reveals his intent to return Valentine to poverty, saying, &quot;Do you really believe I would have a nigger run our family business?&quot;; Randolph concurs, &quot;Neither would I&quot;. Budd concluded the film is a &quot;message loudly asking for a reassessment of prejudice, and for level playing fields&quot;. Hernan Vera and Andrew Gordon argue racial stereotypes are enabled with the permission of the only black main character. As part of their revenge against the Dukes, Winthorpe disguises his identity by donning blackface makeup, an act enabled by Valentine who has helped loosen up this strait-laced character. Because Valentine allowed it, it makes the act acceptable. This requires Valentine to accept and support Winthorpe despite having numerous reasons to dislike him, including originally getting Valentine wrongly arrested and then later trying to frame Valentine to reclaim his old job. Even so, Valentine befriends Winthorpe and helps him get revenge on the Dukes, the old establishment characters who demonstrate explicit racism. The film requires Valentine to act &quot;white&quot;, performing as is expected of him to survive in the Dukes&#x27; world.

Schiff argues that because the film identifies money as the most valuable entity, this in turn means that Ophelia is only valuable as a prostitute because she is financially intelligent. Hadley Freeman said Ophelia is an example of the Smurfette principle, a female character in an otherwise male ensemble cast who exists to be pretty and rescued by men. However, it is Ophelia who rescues Winthorpe, helping him to survive his new lowered-state. Neal Karlen said Ophelia becomes a real person after telling Louis: &quot;All I&#x27;ve got going for me in this whole, big, wide world is this body, this face, and what I&#x27;ve got up here [referring to her brain]&quot;.

&quot;Trading Places&quot; also employs several conventions of its Christmas setting to highlight the individual loneliness of the main characters, in particular, Winthorpe. On Christmas Eve he humiliates himself in front of his former bosses, unwittingly losing his opportunity for his swap with Valentine to be undone by having become a criminal. While waiting outside a store, a dog urinates on him. He attempts suicide and only fails because the gun does not fire; then it begins to rain on him. The following day offers a Christmas redemption and a change of fortune as Winthorpe is integrated into the non-traditional family unit of Coleman, Ophelia and Valentine.

==Legacy==
Along with the impact their respective roles had on its stars&#x27; careers, &quot;Trading Places&quot; is considered one of the best comedy films ever made and part of the canon of American comedies. In a 1988 interview, Aykroyd said that he considered it among his &quot;A-tier&quot; films, along with &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Dragnet&quot;, &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, and &quot;Spies Like Us&quot;.

Bellamy and Ameche reprised their Duke characters for Murphy&#x27;s 1988 film &quot;Coming to America&quot;. Murphy portrays the affluent Prince Akeem who hands the now-homeless brothers a large sum of cash. Mortimer tells Randolph that it is enough to give them a new start. Of the two films, Murphy has said that while he &quot;loves&quot; &quot;Trading Places&quot;, he prefers &quot;Coming to America&quot; because it allowed him to portray multiple characters. The 2021 sequel &quot;Coming 2 America&quot; also references the Dukes, revealing they used Akeem&#x27;s donation to rebuild their business.

In 2010, nearly 30 years after its release, the film was cited in the testimony of Commodity Futures Trading Commission chief Gary Gensler regarding new regulations on the financial markets. He said:We have recommended banning using misappropriated government information to trade in the commodity markets. In the movie &quot;Trading Places&quot;, starring Eddie Murphy, the Duke brothers intended to profit from trades in frozen concentrated orange juice futures contracts using an illicitly obtained and not yet public Department of Agriculture orange crop report. Characters played by Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd intercept the misappropriated report and trade on it to profit and ruin the Duke brothers. The testimony was part of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act designed to prevent insider trading on commodities markets, which had previously not been illegal. Section 746 of the reform act is referred to as the &quot;Eddie Murphy rule&quot;. An anonymous seller sold off their portion of the royalties earned from the film for $140,000 in 2019. At the time, the share was generating an average of $10,000 per annum. A musical adaptation of &quot;Trading Places&quot; debuted at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 4, 2022.

===Critical reassessment===
&quot;Trading Places&quot; is considered one of the best comedies of the 1980s and one of the best Christmas films. In 2015, the screenplay was listed as the joint thirty-third funniest on the WGA&#x27;s 101 Funniest Screenplays list, tied with &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1986). In 2017, the BBC polled 253 critics (118 female, 135 male) from 52 countries on the funniest film made. &quot;Trading Places&quot; came seventy-fourth, behind &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; (1988). Several publications have named it one of the best films of the 1980s, including: number eight by &quot;IFC&quot;; number 17 by MTV; number 37 by &quot;USA Today&quot;; and number 41 by Rotten Tomatoes. It has also been listed as one of the best comedy films ever by publications including: number 16 by &quot;Time Out&quot;; number 26 by Rotten Tomatoes; and number 48 by &quot;Empire&quot;.

Although the film&#x27;s story takes place over several weeks leading up to and after Christmas, &quot;Trading Places&quot; is regarded as a Christmas film. In 2008, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it one of the most underrated Christmas films. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described it as a less traditional Christmas film, but one whose themes remain relevant, particularly regarding the divide between the wealthy and poor. It has appeared on several lists of the best Christmas films, including: number 5 by &quot;Empire&quot;; number 12 by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;; number 13 by &quot;Thrillist&quot;; number 23 by &quot;Time Out&quot;; number 24 by Rotten Tomatoes (based on overall critical scores); number 45 by &quot;Today&quot;; and unranked by &quot;Country Living&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. It has been a popular Christmas film on TV in Italy since its television debut in 1986, generally played on Christmas Eve.

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of , based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Featuring deft interplay between Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, &quot;Trading Places&quot; is an immensely appealing social satire&quot;. Metacritic gave the film a score of 69 out of 100, based on 10 critics, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In the years followings its release, some critics have praised the film while highlighting elements that they believe aged poorly, including racial language, the use of blackface, and the implied rape of Beeks by a gorilla. The film&#x27;s use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;, said during Mortimer&#x27;s statement that he will never allow Valentine to run his family business, is sometimes censored in TV broadcasts. Todd Larkins Williams, director of the 2004 documentary &quot;The N-Word&quot;, said that it is a critical scene that should not be censored. He considered it dangerous to pretend a word never existed as in turn other negative events could also be ignored. &quot;GQ&quot; argued that its social commentary remained relevant in spite of these elements. In 2020, &quot;Trading Places&quot; was one of 16 films that had a disclaimer added by British broadcaster Sky UK. The disclaimer read, &quot;This film has outdated attitudes, language, and cultural depictions which may cause offence today&quot;.

<text>Vranov nad Topľou (Slovak before 1927 and from 1944–1969: &quot;Vranov&quot;; / &quot;Vronau an der Töpl&quot; (rare); ; ) is a town of approximately 20,500 inhabitants in eastern Slovakia, situated near Košice and Prešov, and between the Topľa River and the Ondava River.

The city is divided into three parts: Vranov nad Topľou proper, Čemerné and Lomnica.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from a Slovak word &quot;vrana&quot; (crow) with a possessive suffix &quot;-ov&quot;. In Latin medieval record, the settlement is often called &quot;Varanno&quot; (the Hungarized form), but also &quot;Wrano&quot;, &quot;Varanow&quot; or rarely &quot;Varanovia&quot; (the Latinized form).

==Location==
Vranov nad Toplou occupies the northwest bulge of the Eastern Slovak Lowland (Východoslovenská nížina) in the upper part of the region called Zemplín between the rivers Topľa and Ondava.

==History==
The earliest evidences of the human presence in the area of today&#x27;s Vranov dates back to Paleolithic Era. Several artefacts from the Roman-Migration Period were unearth in the center of town. Extensive Slavic settlement (7th-10th century) existed in Lomnica (nowadays a part of Vranov), Slavic settlements are known also from Čemerné and other localities.

The first written mention about Vranov dates back to 1332–1337, but mentions about localities that are nowadays parts of town are older (1229, 1270, 1282). The medieval settlement of Vranov nad Topľou was part of the castle estate Čičva (Csisva) which was built in 1310. Because of the advantageous geographical position of the town situated on the important trading path leading from Eperjes/Prešov, Vranov nad Topľou became an economic and social centre for the territory in the basin of two rivers, the Ondava and the Topľa. Besides the local trade, handicraft production has been developed here, too.

Vranov was granted town status probably before 1363 (in this year it was firstly mentioned as &quot;civitas&quot;). The heads of the municipal government founded were the mayor and the counselors. The town was given more municipal privileges (toll right, right to store the goods, right to hold an annual market) by King Matthias Corvinus in 1461, and the town was given the right to make out written documents with a municipal seal. The original seal from the 15th century displayed a cancer, later it was replaced by a patron of the local church (King Saint Stephen). The heraldic coat-of-arms in its present form has been used since 1622. The first guilds were founded here in the 16th century. The guild of Vranov shoemakers is one of the oldest guilds in the whole Zemplín county. A grammar school was founded in the town in the 16th century.

When a large part of Hungary was conquered by the Turks in 1526, Vranov was mostly unaffected as the northern regions of Hungary were not conquered by the Turks and this allowed the city to prosper under the Zápolya house which ruled the area and the Thököly&#x27;s in the late 17th century.

In the second half of the 19th century, Vranov nad Topľou became the centre of a region of 44 villages. At the end of the century there was mass emigration. In 1903, Vranov got access to the railroad; electric lighting and the telephone were introduced in 1906.

After the formation of Czechoslovakia, the Hungarian name Varanno was changed to Vranov nad Topľou and it remained a small agrarian and craft town. During the Second World War, some partisan groups were formed in the region, and the town became the centre of an anti-fascist revolt. In 1942 most of the remaining Hungarians, those who would not declare that they were ethnic Slovaks, were forcibly deported from Vranov and ethnic Slovaks were moved into the area. The period after 1945 was a time of industrial development, building of housing estates and reconstruction of the town centre.

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 census, the town had 22,985 inhabitants. 93.11% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 4.40% Roma, 0.61% Czechs, 0.27% Rusyns and 0.25% Ukrainian. The religious makeup was 62.61% Roman Catholics, 20.13% Greek Catholics, 7.18% Lutherans and 5.70% people with no religious affiliation.

==Noteworthy objects==
The town features a Gothic church from the 15th century (rebuilt 1578 and again 1718), a baroque monastery from 1718, a neo-Gothic Evangelic Lutheran church of 1930-1935 and a Reformed church from the early 20th century. A synagogue of 1923 and a classicist manor house (a castle built in the 18th century on the place of a castle built in the Middle Ages) were demolished in the 1980s. Vranov was also a major milling centre during the 16th century.

The town is the starting point for trips to the Veľká Domaša water reservoir.

The town is an economic center of the surroundings. In the late 20th century it housed chemical (Bukóza works), clothing (Slovenka), building materials and food industries.

<text>HMS &quot;Charity&quot; was a destroyer of the Royal Navy laid down by John I. Thornycroft and Company of Woolston, Southampton on 9 July 1943. She was launched on 30 November 1944 and commissioned on 19 November 1945. She was sold to the US Navy in 1958, for transfer to the Pakistan Navy as a part of the Military Aid Program.

Renamed &quot;Shah Jahan&quot;, the ship was badly damaged in a strike by Indian Navy missile boats during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, and scrapped as a result.

==History in the Royal Navy==
Commissioned too late for service in the Second World War, &quot;Charity&quot;″s pennant number was soon changed to D29. She formed part of the 14th (later 1st) Destroyer Squadron for service in the Mediterranean. She saw service, along with other Royal Navy ships in preventing illegal immigration into Palestine in 1947.

Following the outbreak of hostilities &quot;Charity&quot; served during the Korean War, where she joined the 8th Destroyer Flotilla. She steamed during the war, and her actions included destroying a train. The destroyer received a slight modernization, which involved the removal of one of her rear gun turrets (&#x27;X&#x27; mounting) which was replaced by mountings for two Squid anti-submarine launchers, which replaced her depth charges. She paid off into reserve in 1955.

==History in the Pakistan Navy==

&quot;Charity&quot; was sold to the United States Navy on 16 June 1958, for further transfer to the Pakistan Navy. She was renamed &quot;Shah Jehan&quot; (DD-962). She was modernized by J. Samuel White in Cowes, England under a US contract and transferred to the Pakistan Navy as part of the Military Assistance Program on 16 December 1958 where she served as &quot;Shah Jahan&quot; (literally, &quot;Emperor of the World&quot;, after Shah Jahan).

===Indo-Pakistan War of 1971===

During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, &quot;Shah Jahan&quot; was escort to the cargo ship MV &quot;Venus Challenger&quot; carrying ammunition sent by the United States for the war effort from Saigon to Karachi.

On the night of 4 December 1971, the Indian Navy launched a fast naval strike called Operation Trident on the Pakistani Naval Headquarters of Karachi. The Operation Trident task force consisted of 3 s from the 25th &quot;Killer&quot; Missile Boat Squadron (, , and ), escorted by two anti-submarine s, and , which approached Karachi.

The Indian missile boats evaded Pakistani reconnaissance aircraft and patrol vessels and converged at 2150 hours about south of Karachi, and detected the Pakistani naval vessels on patrol. At 2300 hours, &quot;Nipat&quot; fired 2 SS-N-2 &quot;Styx&quot; missiles at &quot;Shah Jahan&quot; and &quot;Venus Challenger&quot;. The ammunition aboard &quot;Venus Challenger&quot; exploded when the ship was hit by the missile, and the vessel quickly sunk. &quot;Shah Jahan&quot; was also struck by the missile and was irreparably damaged. She was towed back to Karachi and scrapped.

The Pakistani destroyer &quot;Khaibar&quot; and minesweeper were also sunk in the operation. The missile boats then hit the fuel storage tanks at Karachi harbour, setting them ablaze.

<text>Dolce &amp; Gabbana (), also known by initials D&amp;G, is an Italian luxury fashion house founded in 1985 in Legnano by Italian designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana. The house specializes in ready-to-wear, handbags, accessories, cosmetics, and fragrances and licenses its name and branding to Luxottica for eyewear.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Dolce&amp;Gabbana founders Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana met each other in 1982 while working for Giorgio Corregiari, an Italian fashion brand. Domenico Dolce was born on 13 August 1958, in Polizzi Generosa, while Stefano Gabbana was born on 14 November 1962, in Milan. Dolce began designing and making his clothes at the age of six. In 1983, the two established their own design consulting studio, which they named &quot;Dolce &amp; Gabbana&quot;. Their first women&#x27;s collection debuted in 1985 at the New Talents section of Milan Fashion Week, and the following year, they opened their first store in Milan.
The first meeting between the two happened over the phone when Dolce called the fashion company where Gabbana was working, looking for a job. After being hired by the company, Gabbana took Dolce under his wing and taught him the workings of a fashion company and how to sketch new designs. Shortly after Dolce&#x27;s hiring, Gabbana was drafted for 18 months of civil service at an institution for the mentally ill, but after his return, the two created a design consulting business.

The company&#x27;s 1986 Spring and Summer (SS) collection, titled &quot;Geometrissimo&quot; was presented alongside other fashion labels. Dolce &amp; Gabbana did not have enough money to hire models or provide them with accessories, so they sought help from their friends. Their friends served as models and wore their personal items to accessorize the clothing. A bed sheet from Dolce&#x27;s home was used as their stage curtain.

In March 1986, Dolce &amp; Gabbana released their first self-produced collection, &quot;Donne Vere/Real Women,&quot; for the Fall and Winter (FW) 1986/87 season. The name of the collection was influenced by the local women who served as models on the runway. However, sales were initially disappointing, and Gabbana canceled the fabric order for their second collection. Dolce&#x27;s family later offered to help with costs during a visit to Sicily over Christmas. Incidentally, the fabric company did not receive the cancellation notice in time, and the fabric was ready for them when they returned to Milan. In September 1986, Dolce&amp;Gabbana presented the SS 1987 Women&#x27;s fashion show entitled &quot;Trasformismo&quot;.Despite working together, they always invoiced separately until an accountant advised them to invoice jointly to simplify things and make the business more cost-effective. The two began invoicing clients under the name Dolce and Gabbana, which became the name of their developing design business. They produced their next collection in 1986 and opened their first store the same year.
The fashion house continued to gain recognition, and in 1987, Dolce &amp; Gabbana presented the Women&#x27;s SS 1988 fashion show, entitled &quot;Il Gattopardo/The Leopard line&quot;. The following year, they began designing underwear and swimwear, and by 1990, the company was exporting their products to Japan and the United States. In the same year, they launched their first perfume, &quot;Dolce&amp;Gabbana Pour Homme&quot; and &quot;Dolce&amp;Gabbana Pour Femme&quot;, produced and distributed by Euroitalia.

In 1990 the company opened its first women&#x27;s boutique in Via Sant&#x27;Andrea, Milan. Michael Gross wrote of their third collection in a 1992 interview, &quot;They were a secret known only to a handful of Italian fashion editors. Their few models changed behind a rickety screen. They called their collection of T-shirt-cotton and elastic-silk pieces, Transformation.&quot; The clothing in this collection came with instructions on the seven different ways a piece could be worn in an outfit, as the wearer could use Velcro and snaps to alter the clothing&#x27;s form.

Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s fourth collection, influenced by Dolce&#x27;s Sicilian roots, made an impact on the Italian fashion market. In this collection, Dolce drew on his Sicilian roots. The collection&#x27;s advertising campaign was shot in Sicily by photographer Ferdinando Scianna and featured Dutch model Marpessa Hennink in black and white pictures reminiscent of Italian cinema from the 1940s. The brand&#x27;s use of Italian cinema as a theme continued in their fifth collection, which drew upon the work of filmmaker Luchino Visconti and his film &quot;The Leopard&quot;.

One of the dresses from their fourth collection, called &quot;The Sicilian Dress&quot;, became iconic for the brand and was named one of the 100 most important dresses ever designed by author Hal Rubenstein. The dress is considered to be the epitome of Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s style, with a slip-like silhouette that emphasizes the figure and flares out at the knees to create a swaying motion when walking.

Hal Rubenstein described the piece in 2012, writing: &quot;The Sicilian Dress is the essence of Dolce &amp; Gabbana, the sartorial cornerstone of the brand. The dress takes inspiration from a slip, but it is a slip that adorned Anna Magnani, and it is a silhouette that graced Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren, and so on. The straps fit tightly to the body just like those of a bra; the neckline runs straight but is pinned at least twice, once on each side, to caress the two breasts and in the middle to meet an uplifting fold that provides slight support. The slip does not simply fall down but rises at the waist to hold the figure firmly but not too tightly, and then flares out to emphasize the hips, falling slightly tapered at the knees, ensuring the swaying of the hips while walking.&quot;

=== 1980s and 1990s ===

In 1987, Dolce &amp; Gabbana launched their first knitwear collection line, and in 1989, they started an underwear and beachwear collection. In the same year, they launched their first women&#x27;s fashion show in Tokyo and opened their first store in Japan in partnership with Kashiyama Co.

In April 1990, they held their first fashion show in New York, started exporting their products to the United States, and founded their own showroom. That same year, Dolce&amp;Gabbana presented the first Men&#x27;s FW 1990/1991 collection. The collection features linear-cut garments, characterized by dark and solid shades, such as black, gray and burgundy. The common thread of the collection is the high-waisted trousers, combined with shirts, wool sweaters and blazers. In 1990 as well, the brand moved the design house into its first official offices. The company also began to design gowns and other more expensive pieces in addition to their original clothing.

Their 1990 Spring/Summer women&#x27;s collection, featured in the &quot;Gli Anni &#x27;60&quot; women&#x27;s fashion show, referenced the mythological painting of Raphael, and the duo began to build a reputation for crystal-encrusted clothing. The 1991 Fall/Winter women&#x27;s collection was also adorned by trinkets, including filigree medals and embellished corsets. The 1992 Fall/Winter women&#x27;s collection was then inspired by the silver screen of the 1950s, though the collection still included crystal embellished body suits.

In 1991, their men&#x27;s collection won the Woolmark Award for the most innovative men&#x27;s collection of the year. Madonna wore a corset made of gemstones and an accompanying jacket from Dolce &amp; Gabbana at the 1991 New York City premiere of &quot;: In Bed with Madonna,&quot; which is considered their first foray into international recognition. The duo partnered with Madonna in 1993 to design over 1500 costumes for the artist&#x27;s Girlie Show international tour in support of her 1992 album &quot;Erotica&quot;. In 1994, the house&#x27;s trademark double-breasted jacket was named &quot;La Turlington&quot; after model Christy Turlington. That same year the company launched the D&amp;G brand, a line produced and distributed by Ittierre, aimed at younger individuals.

In 1993, &quot;Dolce &amp; Gabbana Pour Femme&quot; was awarded the Perfume Academy&#x27;s 1993 award for best feminine fragrance of the year; &quot;Dolce &amp; Gabbana pour Homme&quot;, was the recipient of the best masculine fragrance of the year award from the same academy in 1995.

They won an &quot;Oscar des Parfums&quot; for best male perfume in 1996 from the French Parfum Academy, the first time ever that the title has been awarded to an Italian brand. Towards the end of the 1990s their sales were around $500 million and in 2003 alone, their revenue reached $633.2 million.

In 1990, they launched their first men&#x27;s collection. That year, they also moved the design house into its first official offices and began to design gowns and other more expensive pieces in addition to their original clothing. Their 1990 Spring/Summer women&#x27;s collection referenced the mythological painting of Raphael, and the duo began to build a reputation for crystal-encrusted clothing. The 1991 Fall/Winter women&#x27;s collection was also adorned by trinkets, including filigree medals and embellished corsets. The 1992 Fall/Winter women&#x27;s collection was then inspired by the silver screen of the 1950s, though the collection still included crystal embellished body suits.

In 1993, &quot;Dolce &amp; Gabbana Pour Femme&quot; was awarded the Perfume Academy&#x27;s 1993 award for best feminine fragrance of the year; &quot;Dolce &amp; Gabbana pour Homme&quot;, was the recipient of the best masculine fragrance of the year award from the same academy in 1995.

In 1995, the brand presented the SS 1996 Women&#x27;s fashion show, &quot;Le Eolie&quot;, featuring garments with leopard and zebra prints. That same year Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s collections caused a controversy with the British and Italian press, when they selected the American gangster motif as inspiration for their work. The brand transposed this Fall/Winter 1995 inspiration onto women&#x27;s wear, which critics stated brought an erotic edge to the clothing. The duo had used the motif before in 1992 when photographer Steven Meisel shot an ad campaign for the house in which the models posed in &quot;gangster chic&quot;. This included wide-lapelled 1930s style coats and black leather caps.

In 1996 the D&amp;G runway show was streamed on the Internet instead of being held on a physical runway, in an experimental move towards new media. That year Dolce &amp; Gabbana also designed the costumes for the film &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
Dolce&amp;Gabbana worked with various musical artists in the 2000s, designing costumes for Madonna&#x27;s Drowned World Tour in 2001, Missy Elliott, Beyoncé, and Mary J. Blige&#x27;s international tours and Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; tour. Additionally, they designed costumes for Kylie Minogue&#x27;s Showgirl Homecoming tour and featured Madonna in their 2010 advertising campaigns.

During this time, Dolce &amp; Gabbana drew inspiration from the sport of football, and their designs continued to influence trends in both fashion and music. In 2002, their early corset designs were revived by many European designers as a trend. The brand also began holding private viewings of their new collections for buyers to pre-empt the copying of their designs by fast fashion companies.

In 2006, the company started a new journey in accessories and leather goods for men and women. In the same year, the brand launched a controversial ad campaign featuring two men kissing, which received criticism from some conservatives. However, the Advertising Standards Authority of Italy did not find the ad unacceptable for broadcast solely based on the depiction of two men kissing.

In February 2009, the Dolce&amp;Gabbana makeup line was launched. Dolce &amp; Gabbana created their first makeup in collaboration with make-up artist Pat McGrath. Scarlett Johansson appeared as the face of the advertising campaign for this new venture.

===2010s===
In 2011, Dolce&amp;Gabbana merged with D&amp;G, with the aim of strengthening the main line. The final independent D&amp;G collection was the Spring/Summer 2012 collection shown in September 2011. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; publication in 2005 stated that, &quot;Dolce and Gabbana are becoming to the two-thousands what Prada was to the nineteen-nineties and Armani was to the nineteen-eighties—designers whose sensibility defines the decade.&quot;

In terms of personal awards, &quot;FHM&quot; named Dolce &amp; Gabbana as the designers of the year in 1996 and 1997. In 2003, &quot;GQ Magazine&quot; awarded Dolce &amp; Gabbana the title of &quot;Men of the Year&quot;. The following year, &quot;British Elle&quot; readers voted Dolce &amp; Gabbana as the best international designers at the 2004 Elle Style Awards.

On 19 June 2010, Dolce&amp;Gabbana celebrated the 20th anniversary of their brand at the Piazza della Scala and Palazzo Marino in Milan. The following day, a public exhibition was held which included a room with several dozen televisions piled haphazardly upon each other, each displaying a different collection from the design house&#x27;s twenty-year history.

In 2019, Dolce &amp; Gabbana extended its size range up to UK 22, making them one of the first luxury fashion houses to move towards body positivity and inclusivity for women. While most luxury fashion houses cater to women of sizes up to UK 16, Dolce &amp; Gabbana took the initiative to extend their size range for greater inclusivity.

===2020s===
In September 2021, Dolce&amp;Gabbana collaborated with UNXD to issue &quot;Collezione Genesi NFT&quot;, its first non-fungible token (NFT) collection. The collection consisted of nine pieces, including five physical and four digital creations, such as &quot;Glass Suit&quot; and &quot;Impossible Tiara&quot;, and was sold for 1,885.719 Ether (equivalent to nearly $5.7 million). This collaboration with UNXD was a significant move towards the incorporation of blockchain technology into the fashion industry, and was widely reported by publications such as Vogue and The New York Times as being one of the first NFT collections created by a major fashion house.

Dolce&amp;Gabbana collaborated with the British-American designer Harris Reed to present Somali model Iman Abdulmajid at the 2021 Met Gala fashion event in New York City. Harris Reed stated that fashion has a responsibility to spark conversation around social injustices. Iman, who faced institutional racism as a model, and founded a cosmetics line for women of color in 1994, was seen as an ideal collaborator to create a statement on the red carpet.

In 2022, Dolce&amp;Gabbana teamed up with American celebrity Kim Kardashian to produce the &quot;Ciao Kim&quot; collection. The collection predominantly showcased black, white, and silver clothing with embellishments such as lace, crystals, and leopard prints. Later, in February 2023, Kim Kardashian was introduced as the face of D&amp;G&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2023 collection in campaign photos shot by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott.

Dolce&amp;Gabbana has a history of co-branding with various Italian companies such as Baci Perugina, Fiasconaro, Murano glass company, Barovier &amp; Toso, Mian, I Dogi, Venini, Barbini, Salviati, and Tessiture Bevilacqua, among others. These collaborations have been an integral part of the brand&#x27;s marketing strategy for many years.

In 2023, Dolce&amp;Gabbana won the Craft and Artisanship Award at the CNMI Sustainable Fashion Awards.

===Alta Moda===

Alta Moda was launched in 2012, inspired by Giovanni Battista Giorgini&#x27;s efforts to promote Italian fashion and Made in Italy brands abroad.

Creating the most flattering clothes is their priority over setting fashion trends, and they have stated that they would not mind if their only contribution to fashion history was a black bra. The designers strongly identify with Sicilian culture and consider it their most important source of style and inspiration (Dolce &amp; Gabbana 2007).

The pair were once called the &quot;Gilbert and George of Italian fashion.&quot; Although relatively new to the fashion industry compared to Italian giants such as Armani and Versace, the designers attribute their incredible success in part to luck.

== Spaces and exhibitions ==
Dolce&amp;Gabbana established &quot;La sede di via San Damiano&quot; atelier in September 1995, followed by the &quot;Lo showroom di via Goldoni&quot;, a seven-floor boutique and corporate space in 2002. They moved from their previous main showroom at Piazza Umanitaria to this new location. In July 2006, they opened another 5,000 square foot show floor at &quot;Lo showroom di via Broggi&quot; in Milan. The fashion house also purchased the &quot;Il Metropol&quot; theatre, a historic cinema in Milan built in the 1940s, which underwent renovation and was reopened in September 2005. In 2006, Dolce &amp; Gabbana inaugurated IL GOLD, an establishment with café, bar, bistro, and restaurant areas. Additionally, they opened the Martini Bar, a co-sponsored drinking establishment at their Milanese men&#x27;s showroom in 2003, followed by another Martini Bar at their Shanghai showroom in 2006. As of 2009, Dolce&amp;Gabbana had 93 boutiques and 11 factory outlets and were sold in over 80 countries, with a total of 251 mono-brand stores.

In the United States, standalone boutiques can be found in Bal Harbour, Beverly Hills, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, and New York City, with boutiques in select department stores such as Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodman.

Apart from developing runway shows and advertising campaigns for its collections, Dolce &amp; Gabbana uses its spaces to host photography and art exhibitions. After the opening of the Il Metropol, they hosted two exhibitions by artist Ron Arad in the lobby space: &quot;Blo-Glo&quot; between April 2006 and April 2007, and &quot;Bodyguards&quot; in late April 2007. The brand also held photography exhibitions featuring the work of Enzo Sellerio in 2007 and Herbert List in 2008. In 2011, Dolce &amp; Gabbana hosted an open house and architectural exhibition with Studio Piuarch, showcasing the studio&#x27;s various architectural designs and projects since 1996. Studio Piuarch built the Dolce &amp; Gabbana headquarters in 2006, where the exhibition and open house were held.

Dolce &amp; Gabbana also uses its spaces for book launches and photographic exhibitions of its own clothing, such as the book launch of their book David Gandy in 2011. Additionally, they use other spaces, such as the Palazzo della Ragione in Milan, where they held a photographic exhibition of over 100 images selected from the history of US Vogue over its 90-year history in May 2009. The exhibition was called &quot;Extreme Beauty in Vogue&quot;.

The company has production factories in Legnano and Incisa in Val d&#x27;Arno.

== Sustainability Advocacy ==
In January 2022, Dolce &amp; Gabbana announced their decision to prohibit the use of animal fur in their products, aligning with a growing trend in the fashion industry. Rather than using real fur, the company will collaborate with fur artisans to create sustainable faux fur alternatives and incorporate recycled materials in their designs. The Humane Society of the U.S. and Humane Society International partnered with Dolce &amp; Gabbana in making this announcement.

Additionally, Dolce &amp; Gabbana co-founded the Re.Crea Competition in August 2022, alongside other major fashion companies, to address textile waste management and promote research and development in the area recycling, in line with European directives on Extended Producer Responsibility for Textile Waste.

== Controversies ==

=== Advertising ===

Following complaints from consumer groups in February 2007, Dolce &amp; Gabbana pulled an advertisement in Spain that showed a man holding a woman to the ground by her wrists while a group of men look on. Spain&#x27;s Labour and Social Affairs Ministry branded the campaign as illegal and humiliating to women, saying the woman&#x27;s body position had no relation to the products Dolce &amp; Gabbana was trying to sell. Italian publications followed suit, banning the ad. According to Debonair Magazine, &quot;this Dolce &amp; Gabbana advertisement has been criticized as a glorification of gang-rape. While one can never be sure of D&amp;G&#x27;s true intent, the company&#x27;s penchant is for controversy.&quot; When asked about the ad being banned in Spain, Dolce &amp; Gabbana responded that the &quot;Spaniards were a bit backward.&quot;
According to &quot;The Huffington Post UK&quot;, feminist writer Louise Pennington also commented on the image. She stated that, &quot;This particular image is a representative of an increasingly misogynistic contraction of women in the fashion industry demonstrating very clear links between the fashion-beauty industry and the mainstreaming of pornography. Those who suggest this image is harmless fail to recognize the reality of rape culture and the dehumanization of women&#x27;s bodies in our pornographic mainstream media.&quot;

=== Hong Kong photography ban ===
On 5 January 2012, it was reported that Hong Kong residents had been prevented from taking pictures of Dolce &amp; Gabbana window displays in both their Hong Kong stores. In particular staff and security personnel at their flagship store on Canton Road asserted the pavement area outside was private property where photography was forbidden. The actions sparked protests spanning several days and gained international news coverage on 8 January. Citing the case of Zhou Jiugeng, a Nanjing official whose high-living lifestyle was identified by mainland Chinese internet users using photographs, local news reports speculated that the Dolce &amp; Gabbana photo ban may have been imposed at the request of some wealthy Chinese government officials attempting to block details on the source of their wealth.

Dolce &amp; Gabbana issued a formal apology to the people of Hong Kong from its Milan headquarters on 18 January 2012, confirming that it had no relation to the incident.

=== Gay adoption and in vitro fertilization ===
In an interview on 16 March 2015, issue of Italian magazine &quot;Panorama&quot;, Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce caused controversy when they remarked, &quot;We oppose gay adoptions. The only family is the traditional one.&quot; They also criticized in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and surrogacy by saying, &quot;No chemical offspring and rented uterus: life has a natural flow, there are things that should not be changed.&quot; 
Critics took to social media to voice their opposition, with the hashtag #BoycottDolceGabbana garnering 30,000 tweets on Twitter in five days. Celebrities, including Elton John, Madonna, Victoria Beckham, Ricky Martin, Martina Navratilova and Courtney Love, were among those expressing anger over the remarks. 
According to Guardian, &quot;in an interview in 2006, Gabbana revealed that he had approached a woman to be the mother of his baby but made it clear that he struggled with the idea of a same-sex family.
&quot;I am opposed to the idea of a child growing up with two gay parents,&quot; he said. &quot;A child needs a mother and a father. I could not imagine my childhood without my mother. I also believe that it is cruel to take a baby away from its mother.&quot;
More than 10,000 people signed an online petition calling for Macy&#x27;s and Debenhams to stop stocking the brand in their department stores, until D&amp;G retracted their statements and apologized. Protesters also gathered outside Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s flagship London shop calling for an international boycott of the luxury fashion store.
Dolce &amp; Gabbana criticized calls for a boycott on their brand as &quot;medieval&quot; and called to boycott Elton John. During an interview with CNN, the pair said &quot;they respected how people chose to live their lives, including the use of IVF, and said others should also respect differences in opinion. They also added that they could have expressed themselves using better language to the Italian magazine but appeared taken aback by the social media backlash. &quot;

=== Shanghai event promotion video ===
In November 2018, Dolce &amp; Gabbana released a series of videos on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter profiles, as well as its Sina Weibo account in China, featuring a Chinese model with her eye intentionally narrowed, dressed up in the brand&#x27;s garments and accessories and clumsily attempting to use chopsticks to eat Italian food in a pretentious way. The video narratage is in Standard Mandarin with a hubristic and lecturing tone, while having sexually suggestive lines.
Social media users commented that it reflects Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s lack of understanding of Chinese culture and racism. Under the public pressure, D&amp;G removed this series from its Sina Weibo while still keeping them on Instagram. Social media outcry was further exacerbated by a screen capture of racist comments alleged to have been made from the D&amp;G co-founder Stefano Gabbana&#x27;s Instagram account. Later Dolce &amp; Gabbana claimed on Instagram that both the brand&#x27;s and the designer&#x27;s accounts had been hacked, also issuing a video where they apologized for the ads and asked for forgiveness from the Chinese people. &quot;We have always been in love with China,&quot; Dolce said in the video. &quot;We love your culture and we certainly have much to learn. That is why we are sorry if we made mistakes in the way we expressed ourselves.&quot; &quot;We will never forget this experience and it will certainly never happen again,&quot; Gabbana said. &quot;From the bottom of our hearts, we ask for forgiveness.&quot; Stefano Gabbana complained about removing the videos from the internet and called China the &quot;Ignorant Dirty Smelling Mafia&quot;, adding that it was a &quot;country of shit&quot; and &quot;feel inferiors&quot; in the message. Later Dolce &amp; Gabbana claimed on Instagram that both the brand&#x27;s and the designer&#x27;s accounts had been hacked.
Wang Junkai and Dilraba Dilmurat, both of whom served as the brand&#x27;s celebrity ambassadors, severed their ties with the company. Other celebrities, including Zhang Ziyi, Li Bingbing and Chen Kun withdrew from the event. Ultimately, the show was cancelled by the brand.
Chinese e-commerce sites, including Alibaba and JD.com, removed the products of Dolce &amp; Gabbana. The founders of Dolce &amp; Gabbana apologized in a video on 23 November, which was posted on its Sina Weibo account, and also posted on Instagram and Facebook later. Throughout the video, the founders can be seen reading off a script from a teleprompter located on the right. At the end of the video, the founders were saying &quot;对不起&quot; (sorry) in Chinese. Meanwhile, the three videos were finally removed from the official Instagram account.

== Legal issues ==
In May 2009, the Italian government charged Dolce &amp; Gabbana with tax evasion for having moved assets of about 249 million euros to Luxembourg in the 2004–2006 period. On 19 June 2013, they were found guilty of failing to declare 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of income to authorities after moving their brand to Gado, a Luxembourg-based holding company. The court sentenced them both to one year and eight months in jail. Dolce &amp; Gabbana filed an appeal. On 30 April 2014, a three judge panel overruled the appeal and decided to uphold the initial sentence. Finally, on 24 October 2014, both Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were found not guilty of tax evasion by the Italian Court of Justice. 
Following the cancellation of their 2018 show in China, Dolce &amp; Gabbana filed a lawsuit against fashion watchdog Diet Prada, claiming defamation by the bloggers who reposted anti-Asian comments made by one of their designers. The $USD600m claim argued that the Instagram account was responsible for encouraging public backlash, the cancellation of their show and loss of business. In the lawsuit, the petitioners once again claimed that their Instagram account was hacked and then publicly apologized for the incident. The loss of business in question includes Chinese retailer Yangmatou taking down 58,000 Dolce &amp; Gabbana products from their store. Luxury western retailers, such as Net-a-Porter, also removed them from their brand list. Fashion Law Institute lawyers are defending the Diet Prada founders.

==History==

Rugby league was first played in New South Wales in 1907. The New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) was formed in August 1907, when player discontent with the administration of the New South Wales Rugby Union, over rejection of compensation payments for injuries and lost wages, led to a breakaway movement. Key figures in the new league were James Joseph Giltinan, legendary cricketer Victor Trumper, Alex Burdon, Peter Moir, Labor politician Henry Hoyle, George Brackenreg and Jack Feneley. The first NSWRFL game was played on 17 August 1907, in which a New Zealand team defeated a NSW team 12–8.

The Sydney premiership was started on 20 April 1908. Nine teams contested the initial season. These were the nine teams:

* Balmain Tigers
* (Central) Cumberland Fruitpickers
* Eastern Suburbs Roosters
* Glebe Dirty Reds
* Newcastle Rebels
* Newtown Jets
* North Sydney Bears
* Western Suburbs Magpies
* South Sydney Rabbitohs

The NSWRFL premiership was continued on the basis of the first competition in 1908. In 1929, Jersey Flegg was appointed to the position of president of the NSWRFL and in 1941 he became chairman of the Australian Rugby League Board of Control. At the time of his death in 1960, aged 82, he was still serving in these roles.

When NSWRFL president Flegg died in 1960, Bill Buckley replaced him and also became boss of the Australian Rugby League, a position he remained in from 1960 until his death in 1973. In 1973, Kevin Humphreys was appointed President of NSWRFL and Chairman of Australian Rugby League (ARL). Under him State of Origin was introduced.

In 1983, Humphreys was succeeded in these positions by Ken Arthurson. Under Arthurson, the NSWRFL was succeeded by the New South Wales Rugby League Ltd (NSWRL) and the clubs in the league expanded outside the borders of the state and even the country until, in 1994, after the 87th consecutive premiership season, the Australian Rugby League (ARL) replaced the NSWRL in the operation of the premier competition.

Notwithstanding the handover of control of the game at the elite level across Australia to the ARL, NSWRL retained responsibility for both the administration of the New South Wales rugby league team in State of Origin series, as well as day-to-day management of the state-based New South Wales Cup second-tier premiership, as well as junior representative competitions and divisional leagues throughout NSW and the ACT. It did so in conjunction with the NSW Country Rugby League before their merger in 2019. In a similar way, the rival Queensland Rugby League retained responsibility for that state&#x27;s Origin team and lower tier competitions.

===Royal Agricultural Society Shield===
The Royal Agricultural Society Shield, or RAS Shield was the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL)&#x27;s first premiership trophy. It was presented to each year&#x27;s premiership winning rugby league team; the first to win three successive titles would take permanent ownership of the shield. The Eastern Suburbs club achieved this feat winning premierships in 1911, 1912 and 1913.

The hand crafted silver and oak designed shield was donated to the NSWRL by the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales in its first year of competition.

Leading journalist Claude Corbett wrote in Sydney, Sun, newspaper on, 1 May 1914, &quot;The Royal Agricultural Society Shield, which was presented at the inception of the League&#x27;s first grade competition has been won outright by Eastern Suburbs, who upset all calculations by winning the premiership three years in succession. The club has presented the shield to their captain, Dally Messenger, &#x27;as a token of appreciation of his captaincy&#x27;.&quot;

In 1929, Jersey Flegg was appointed to the position of president of the NSWRFL.

Midway through the 1909 season, Edward Larkin was appointed full-time secretary of the NSWRFL.

===J.J. Giltinan Shield===
In 1951, the NSWRFL originated the J.J. Giltinan Shield, following his death in 1950. This trophy was awarded to the premiers of the NSWRFL competition, being named after one of the founding fathers of the NSWRFL and rugby league in Australia. The trophy remains today, being awarded to the minor premiers of the National Rugby League competition.

Following Jersey Flegg&#x27;s death in 1960, Bill Buckley was made the NSWRFL&#x27;s new president.

In 1967, the NSWRFL grand final became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in Australia. The Nine Network had paid $5,000 for the broadcasting rights.

In 1973, NSWRFL boss Kevin Humphreys negotiated rugby league&#x27;s first television deal with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The NSWRFL had commenced a very popular and successful mid-week competition in 1974, originally known as the Amco Cup, but later as the Tooth Cup and the National Panasonic Cup. The success of this competition, which included teams from both Brisbane and New Zealand, ultimately created pressure for further expansion in the NSWRFL competition.

In 1980, the NSWRFL President Kevin Humphreys, who had been chairman of the League since 1973, was instrumental in the establishment of the State of Origin series between teams representing the NSWRFL and Queensland Rugby League (QRL). The immediate success of this series, which remains the premier representative competition in Australia, and the overriding success of the Queensland team further pressured the NSWRFL to expand the club competition outside the boundaries of the state.

Sydney suburban teams came and went throughout the NSWRFL&#x27;s history but it was not until 1982 that the competition included expansion outside of the Sydney area. This corresponded with the adoption of commercial sponsorship of the competition for the first time, the Winfield Cup. The two new inclusions were from the Australian Capital Territory – the Canberra Raiders – as well as a team from the southern New South Wales region – the Illawarra Steelers.

===Winfield Cup===
The Winfield Cup trophy remains a permanent symbol of one of the game&#x27;s most successful eras. Cast in bronze by Alan Ingham, it was the game&#x27;s ultimate prize for the duration of the Winfield sponsorship from 1982 to 1995.

Based on John O&#x27;Gready&#x27;s world famous photograph of Norm Provan (St George) and Arthur Summons (Wests) after the 1963 Grand Final, the trophy represented the premiership pinnacle for players in the Winfield Era.

The Winfield Cup captured these and many other enduring things about League in its primary image, &quot;The Gladiators&quot; and the famous trophy, like the J.J. Giltinan Shield, remains an important part of the game&#x27;s heritage.

The League&#x27;s name was changed in 1984 to the New South Wales Rugby League and Ken Arthurson became the new chairman. In 1988, two Queensland teams joined the competition, with the inclusions of the Brisbane Broncos and the Gold Coast-Tweed Giants seeing the game move beyond the outer borders of New South Wales. At the same time, a team from the Hunter region of New South Wales was included, with the return of a franchise for Newcastle. Their return was the end of an 81-year wait in the wilderness and this time around the franchise was badged the Newcastle Knights.

In 1990, the NSWRL introduced a salary cap system to even the playing field of teams in the Winfield Cup.

The Winfield Cup competition was handed over to the control of the Australian Rugby League for the 1995 season, with the inclusion of teams from North Queensland, South Queensland, Western Australia and New Zealand. This period of expansion created tremendous success for the competition and rugby league in general.

===The Knock On Effect NSW Cup===
The Knock On Effect NSW Cup (formerly known as NSW Cup, VB NSW Cup, Intrust Super Premiership and Canterbury Cup NSW) is the States&#x27;s top-tier competition and clubs run as direct feeders to NRL sides. Canterbury of New Zealand have naming rights from Season 2019 to Season 2020.

===Country Rugby League===
On 24 August 2018, the NSWRL and CRL entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in relation to a possible merger. In October 2019 CRL merged with NSWRL after NSWRL agreed a new constitution and the CRL voted to wind up its affairs immediately.

==National Rugby League Clubs==

==Representative==
The NSWRL manages the New South Wales State of Origin team as well the NSW Residents, Jim Beam Cup, under-19s, under-17s and under-16s and Indigenous rugby league teams. These teams traditionally play against teams from the Queensland Rugby League.

City vs Country is an annual match that takes place between a City side selected by the NSWRL and a Country side selected by New South Wales Country Rugby League. It is played before the State of Origin series and is often referred to as a selection trial for the New South Wales Blues team.

The annual State of Origin series between the New South Wales Blues and the Queensland Maroons is the most popular sporting event in NSW. Sydney has hosted many State of Origin matches since the series began in 1980. The three-game series are held in Sydney and Brisbane with the first and third games in one city and the second in the other. These rotate every year, so if two games are played in Sydney one year, then those games are played in Brisbane the next.

==Other activities==

The NSWRL conducts a development academy from the NSW Institute of Sport facility at Narrabeen. This facility is actively involved in the conduct of competitions and carnivals involving junior league and schools based teams. The academy also conducts several camps, focusing on development as well as running the accreditation process for coaches, trainers, first aid and match officials.

Radio coverage is presented by Steele Sports who call two games of the Intrust Super Premiership each weekend. Steele Sports includes a large team from across Sydney: Alby Talarico (founder), Curtis Woodward (lead caller), Daniel Pettigrew (lead caller), Jack Clifton, Keith &#x27;The chairman&#x27; Payne, Tony Dosen, Lewis Shepperd, Luke Potter and Matt French.

Hawkesbury Radio call Penrith Panthers matches while Alive FM call selected Wentworthville games. Each year, they host the Tom Brock Lecture in their headquarters.
