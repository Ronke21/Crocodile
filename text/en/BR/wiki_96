<text>The Grumman F6F Hellcat is an American carrier-based fighter aircraft of World War II. Designed to replace the earlier F4F Wildcat and to counter the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero, it was the United States Navy&#x27;s dominant fighter in the second half of the Pacific War. In gaining that role, it prevailed over its faster competitor, the Vought F4U Corsair, which initially had problems with visibility and carrier landings.

Powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp, the same powerplant used for both the Corsair and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, the F6F was an entirely new design, but it still resembled the Wildcat in many ways. Some military observers tagged the Hellcat as the &quot;Wildcat&#x27;s big brother&quot;.

The F6F made its combat debut in September 1943. It subsequently established itself as a rugged, well-designed carrier fighter, which was able to outperform the A6M Zero and help secure air superiority over the Pacific theater. In total, 12,275 were built in just over two years.

Hellcats were credited with destroying a total of 5,223 enemy aircraft while in service with the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm (FAA). This was more than any other Allied naval aircraft. After the war, Hellcats were phased out of front-line service in the US, but radar-equipped F6F-5Ns remained in service as late as 1954 as night fighters.

==Design and development==

===XF6F===

Grumman had been working on a successor to the F4F Wildcat since 1938, and the contract for the prototype XF6F-1 was signed on 30 June 1941. The aircraft was originally designed to use the Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone two-row, 14-cylinder radial engine of (the same engine used with Grumman&#x27;s then-new torpedo bomber under development), driving a three-bladed Curtiss Electric propeller. Instead of the Wildcat&#x27;s narrow-track, hand-cranked, main landing gear retracting into the fuselage inherited from the F3F ( a design from the 1930s Grumman FF-1 fighter biplane), the Hellcat had wide-set, hydraulically actuated landing-gear struts that rotated through 90° while retracting backwards into the wings, but with full wheel doors fitted to the struts that covered the entire strut and the upper half of the main wheel when retracted, and twisted with the main gear struts through 90° during retraction. The wing was mounted lower on the fuselage and was able to be hydraulically or manually folded, with each panel outboard of the undercarriage bay folding backwards from pivoting on a specially oriented, Grumman-patented &quot;Sto-Wing&quot; diagonal axis pivoting system much like the earlier F4F, with a folded stowage position parallel to the fuselage with the leading edges pointing diagonally down.

Throughout early 1942, Leroy Grumman, along with his chief designers Jake Swirbul and Bill Schwendler, worked closely with the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) and experienced F4F pilots, to develop the new fighter in such a way that it could counter the Zero&#x27;s strengths and help gain air dominance in the Pacific Theater of Operations. On 22 April 1942, Lieutenant Commander Butch O&#x27;Hare toured the Grumman Aircraft company and spoke with Grumman engineers, analyzing the performance of the F4F Wildcat against the Mitsubishi A6M Zero in aerial combat. Buaer&#x27;s Lt Cdr A. M. Jackson directed Grumman&#x27;s designers to mount the cockpit higher in the fuselage. In addition, the forward fuselage sloped down slightly to the engine cowling, giving the Hellcat&#x27;s pilot good visibility.

====Change of powerplant====
Based on combat accounts of encounters between the F4F Wildcat and A6M Zero, on 26 April 1942, BuAer directed Grumman to install the more-powerful, 18-cylinder Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp radial engine – which was already in use with Chance Vought&#x27;s Corsair since 1940 – in the second XF6F-1 prototype. Grumman complied by redesigning and strengthening the F6F airframe to incorporate the R-2800-10, driving a three-bladed Hamilton Standard propeller. With this combination, Grumman estimated the XF6F-3s performance would increase by 25% over that of the XF6F-1. The Cyclone-powered XF6F-1 (02981) first flew on 26 June 1942, followed by the first Double Wasp-equipped aircraft, the XF6F-3 (02982), which first flew on 30 July 1942. The first production F6F-3, powered by an R-2800-10, flew on 3 October 1942, with the type reaching operational readiness with VF-9 on in February 1943.

===Further development===
The F6F series was designed to take damage and get the pilot safely back to base. A bullet-resistant windshield was used and a total of of cockpit armor was fitted, along with armor around the oil tank and oil cooler. A self-sealing fuel tank was fitted in the fuselage. Standard armament on the F6F-3 consisted of six .50 in (12.7 mm) M2/AN Browning air-cooled machine guns with 400 rounds per gun. A center-section hardpoint under the fuselage could carry a single disposable drop tank, while later aircraft had single bomb racks installed under each wing, inboard of the undercarriage bays; with these and the center-section hard point, late-model F6F-3s could carry a total bomb load in excess of . Six High Velocity Aircraft Rockets (HVARs) could be carried – three under each wing on &quot;zero-length&quot; launchers.

Two night-fighter subvariants of the F6F-3 were developed; the 18 F6F-3Es were converted from standard-3s and featured the AN/APS-4 10 GHz frequency radar in a pod mounted on a rack beneath the right wing, with a small radar scope fitted in the middle of the main instrument panel and radar operating controls installed on the port side of the cockpit. The later F6F-3N, first flown in July 1943, was fitted with the AN/APS-6 radar in the fuselage, with the antenna dish in a bulbous fairing mounted on the leading edge of the outer right wing as a development of the AN/APS-4; about 200 F6F-3Ns were built. Hellcat night fighters claimed their first victories in November 1943. In total, 4,402 F6F-3s were built through until April 1944, when production was changed to the F6F-5.

The F6F-5 featured several improvements, including a more powerful R-2800-10W engine employing a water-injection system and housed in a slightly more streamlined engine cowling, spring-loaded control tabs on the ailerons, and an improved, clear-view windscreen, with a flat armored-glass front panel replacing the F6F-3&#x27;s curved plexiglass panel and internal armor glass screen. In addition, the rear fuselage and tail units were strengthened, and apart from some early production aircraft, most of the F6F-5s built were painted in an overall gloss sea-blue finish. After the first few F6F-5s were built, the small windows behind the main canopy were deleted. The F6F-5N night-fighter variant was fitted with an AN/APS-6 radar in a fairing on the outer-starboard wing. A few standard F6F-5s were also fitted with camera equipment for reconnaissance duties as the F6F-5P. While all F6F-5s were capable of carrying an armament mix of one 20-mm (.79-in) M2 cannon in each of the inboard gun bays (220 rounds per gun), along with two pairs of .50-in (12.7-mm) machine guns (each with 400 rounds per gun), this configuration was only used on later F6F-5N night fighters. The F6F-5 was the most common F6F variant, with 7,870 being built.

Other prototypes in the F6F series included the XF6F-4 (02981, a conversion of the XF6F-1 powered by an R-2800-27 and armed with four 20-mm M2 cannon), which first flew on 3 October 1942 as the prototype for the projected F6F-4. This version never entered production and 02981 was converted to an F6F-3 production aircraft. Another experimental prototype was the XF6F-2 (66244), an F6F-3 converted to use a Wright R-2600-15, fitted with a Birman-manufactured mixed-flow turbocharger, which was later replaced by a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800-21, also fitted with a Birman turbocharger. The turbochargers proved to be unreliable on both engines, while performance improvements were marginal. As with the XF6F-4, 66244 was soon converted back to a standard F6F-3. Two XF6F-6s (70188 and 70913) were converted from F6F-5s and used the 18-cylinder Pratt and Whitney R-2800-18W two-stage supercharged radial engine with water injection and driving a Hamilton-Standard four-bladed propeller. The XF6F-6s were the fastest version of the Hellcat series with a top speed of , but the war ended before this variant could be mass-produced. The last Hellcat rolled out in November 1945, the total production being 12,275, of which 11,000 had been built in just two years. This high production rate was credited to the sound original design, which required little modification once production was under way.

==Operational history==

===U.S. Navy and Marines===
The U.S. Navy much preferred the more docile flight qualities of the F6F compared with the Vought F4U Corsair, despite the Corsair&#x27;s superior speed. This preference was especially noted during carrier landings, a critical success requirement for the Navy. The Corsair was thus released by the Navy to the Marine Corps, which without the need to worry about carrier landings, used the Corsair to devastating effect in land-based sorties. The Hellcat remained the standard USN carrier-borne fighter until the F4U series was finally cleared for U.S. carrier operations in late 1944 (the carrier landing issues had by now been tackled largely due to use of Corsair by the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm, which started in 1943). In addition to its good flight qualities, the Hellcat was easy to maintain and had an airframe tough enough to withstand the rigors of routine carrier operations. Like the Wildcat, the Hellcat was designed for ease of manufacturing and ability to withstand significant damage.

The Hellcat first saw action against the Japanese on 1 September 1943, when fighters off shot down a Kawanishi H8K &quot;Emily&quot; flying boat. Soon after, on 23 and 24 November, Hellcats engaged Japanese aircraft over Tarawa, shooting down a claimed 30 Mitsubishi Zeros for the loss of one F6F. Over Rabaul, New Britain, on 11 November 1943, Hellcats and F4U Corsairs were engaged in day-long fights with many Japanese aircraft, including A6M Zeros, claiming nearly 50 aircraft.

When trials were flown against a captured Mitsubishi A6M5 model Zero, they showed that the Hellcat was faster at all altitudes. The F6F out-climbed the Zero marginally above and rolled faster at speeds above , however, the Japanese fighter could out-turn its American opponent with ease at low speed, and enjoyed a slightly better rate of climb below . The trials report concluded:
Hellcats were the major U.S. Navy fighter type involved in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, where so many Japanese aircraft were shot down that Navy aircrews nicknamed the battle the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;. The F6F accounted for 75% of all aerial victories recorded by the U.S. Navy in the Pacific. Radar-equipped Hellcat night-fighter squadrons appeared in early 1944.

A formidable opponent for the Hellcat was the Kawanishi N1K, but it was produced too late and in insufficient numbers to affect the outcome of the war.

====Sortie, kill, and loss figures====

U.S. Navy and Marine F6F pilots flew 66,530 combat sorties and claimed 5,163 kills (56% of all U.S. Navy/Marine air victories of the war) at a recorded cost of 270 Hellcats in aerial combat (an overall kill-to-loss ratio of 19:1 based on claimed kills). Claimed victories were often highly exaggerated during the war. Even so, the aircraft performed well against the best Japanese opponents with a claimed 13:1 kill ratio against the A6M Zero, 9.5:1 against the Nakajima Ki-84, and 3.7:1 against the Mitsubishi J2M during the last year of the war. The F6F became the prime ace-maker aircraft in the American inventory, with 305 Hellcat aces. The U.S. successes were not just attributed to superior aircraft; from 1942 onwards, they faced increasingly inexperienced Japanese aviators and had the advantage of increasing numerical superiority. In the ground-attack role, Hellcats dropped 6,503 tons (5,899 metric tonnes) of bombs.

The U.S. Navy&#x27;s all-time leading ace, Captain David McCampbell, scored all of his 34 victories in the Hellcat. He once described the F6F as &quot;... an outstanding fighter plane. It performed well, was easy to fly, and was a stable gun platform, but what I really remember most was that it was rugged and easy to maintain.&quot;

During the course of World War II, 2,462 F6F Hellcats were lost to all causes – 270 in aerial combat, 553 to antiaircraft ground and shipboard fire, and 341 due to operational causes. Of the total figure, 1,298 were destroyed in training and ferry operations, normally outside of the combat zones.

Hamilton McWhorter III, a Navy aviator and a flying ace of World War II, was credited with shooting down 12 Japanese aircraft. He was the first U.S. Navy aviator to become an ace while flying the Grumman F6F Hellcat and the first Navy carrier pilot to achieve double ace status.

Arthur Van Haren, Jr., a Navy combat Hellcat ace of WWII from Arizona, was credited with shooting down 9 Japanese planes. He was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses, and was inducted into the Arizona Aviation Hall of Fame in 2012.

===British use===
The British Fleet Air Arm (FAA) received 1,263 F6Fs under the Lend-Lease Act; initially, it was known as the Grumman Gannet Mark I. The name Hellcat replaced it in early 1943 for the sake of simplicity, the Royal Navy at that time adopting the use of the existing American naval names for all the U.S.-made aircraft supplied to it, with the F6F-3 being designated Hellcat F Mk. I, the F6F-5, the Hellcat F Mk. II and the F6F-5N, the Hellcat NF Mk. II. They saw action off Norway, in the Mediterranean, and in the Far East. Several were fitted with photographic reconnaissance equipment similar to the F6F-5P, receiving the designation Hellcat FR Mk. II. The Pacific War being primarily a naval war, the FAA Hellcats primarily faced land-based aircraft in the European and Mediterranean theaters, so experienced far fewer opportunities for air-to-air combat than their USN/Marines counterparts; nevertheless, they claimed a total of 52 enemy aircraft kills during 18 aerial combats from May 1944 to July 1945. 1844 Naval Air Squadron, on board of the British Pacific Fleet was the highest-scoring unit, with 32.5 kills.

FAA Hellcats, as with other Lend-Lease aircraft, were rapidly replaced by British aircraft after the end of the war, with only two of the 12 squadrons equipped with the Hellcat at VJ-Day still retaining Hellcats by the end of 1945. These two squadrons were disbanded in 1946. When the war ended, 889 Squadron FAA, equipped with 6 Hellcat Is and II (PR) photo-reconnaissance variants, was preparing to depart from Scotland for the Far East (the squadron had been based at RAF Woodvale since its re-formation after VE Day, and practising carrier operations on HMS Trouncer before moving to HMS Ravager), to replace 888 Squadron FAA, and intended to photograph Japanese beaches in anticipation of the planned invasion that was forestalled by the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. With the cessation of hostilities, the squadron (which included pilot William Stevenson) was disbanded and the Hellcats dumped off the Scottish coast. (That was the fate of much lend-lease equipment that survived the war, including aircraft; under the terms of lend-lease agreements, any aircraft that were not returned to the United States or paid for, had to be destroyed.)

===Postwar use===

After the war, the Hellcat was succeeded by the F8F Bearcat, which was smaller, more powerful (powered by uprated Double Wasp radials) and more maneuverable, but entered service too late to see combat in World War II.

The Hellcat was used for second-line USN duties, including training and Naval Reserve squadrons, and a handful were converted to target drones. In late 1952, Guided Missile Unit 90 used F6F-5K drones, each carrying a bomb, to attack bridges in Korea. Flying from , the Hellcat drones were radio controlled from an escorting AD Skyraider.

The F6F-5 was the first aircraft used by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Blue Angels official flight demonstration team at its formation in 1946.
The French Naval Aviation was equipped with F6F-5 Hellcats and used them in combat in Indochina. These were painted in Gloss Sea Blue, similar to post-World War II US Navy aircraft until about 1955, but had a modified French roundel with an image of an anchor. The French Air Force also used the Hellcat in Indochina from 1950 to 1952. The plane equipped four squadrons (including the Normandie-Niemen squadron of WWII fame) before these units transitioned to the F8F Bearcat.

The Uruguayan Navy also used them until the early 1960s.

<text>A pen register, or dialed number recorder (DNR), is a device that records all numbers called from a particular telephone line. The term has come to include any device or program that performs similar functions to an original pen register, including programs monitoring Internet communications.

The United States statutes governing pen registers are codified under 18 U.S.C., Chapter 206.

== Definitions ==
 The term &quot;pen register&quot; originally referred to a device for recording telegraph signals on a strip of paper. Samuel F. B. Morse&#x27;s 1840 telegraph patent described such a register as consisting of a lever holding an armature on one end, opposite an electromagnet, with a fountain pen, pencil or other marking instrument on the other end, and a clockwork mechanism to advance a paper recording tape under the marker.

The term &quot;telegraph register&quot; came to be a generic term for such a recording device in the later 19th century. Where the record was made in ink with a pen, the term &quot;pen register&quot; emerged. By the end of the 19th century, pen registers were widely used to record pulsed electrical signals in many contexts. For example, one fire-alarm system used a &quot;double pen-register&quot;, and another used a &quot;single or multiple pen register&quot;.

As pulse dialing came into use for telephone exchanges, pen registers had obvious applications as diagnostic instruments for recording sequences of telephone dial pulses. In the United States, the clockwork-powered Bunnell pen register remained in use into the 1960s.

After the introduction of tone dialing, any instrument that could be used to record the numbers dialed from a telephone came to be defined as a pen register. Title 18 of the United States Code defines a pen register as:

a device or process which records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted, provided, however, that such information shall not include the contents of any communication, but such term does not include any device or process used by a provider or customer of a wire or electronic communication service for billing, or recording as an incident to billing, for communications services provided by such provider or any device or process used by a provider or customer of a wire communication service for cost accounting or other like purposes in the ordinary course of its business

This is the current definition of a pen register, as amended by passage of the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act. The original statutory definition of a pen register was created in 1984 as part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which defined a &quot;Pen Register&quot; as:

A device which records or decodes electronic or other impulses which identify the numbers called or otherwise transmitted on the telephone line to which such device is dedicated.

A pen register is similar to a trap and trace device. A trap and trace device would show what numbers had called a specific telephone, i.e., all &quot;incoming&quot; phone numbers. A pen register rather would show what numbers a phone had called, i.e. all &quot;outgoing&quot; phone numbers. The two terms are often used in concert, especially in the context of Internet communications. They are often jointly referred to as &quot;Pen Register or Trap and Trace devices&quot; to reflect the fact that the same program will probably do both functions in the modern era, and the distinction is not that important. The term &quot;pen register&quot; is often used to describe both pen registers and trap and trace devices.

== Background ==

In &quot;Katz v. United States&quot; (1967), the United States Supreme Court established its &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; test. It overturned &quot;Olmstead v. United States&quot; (1928) and held that warrantless wiretaps were unconstitutional searches, because there was a reasonable expectation that the communication would be private. From then on, the government was required to get a warrant to execute a wiretap.

Twelve years later the Supreme Court held that a pen register is not a search because the &quot;petitioner voluntarily conveyed numerical information to the telephone company.&quot; &quot;Smith v. Maryland&quot;, 442 U.S. 735, 744 (1979). Since the defendant had disclosed the dialed numbers to the telephone company so they could connect his call, he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the numbers he dialed. The court did not distinguish between disclosing the numbers to a human operator or just the automatic equipment used by the telephone company.

The Smith decision left pen registers completely outside constitutional protection. If there was to be any privacy protection, it would have to be enacted by Congress as statutory privacy law.

== Pen Register Act ==
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was passed in 1986 (Pub. L. No. 99-508, 100 Stat. 1848). There were three main provisions or Titles to the ECPA. Title III created the Pen Register Act, which included restrictions on private and law enforcement uses of pen registers. Private parties were generally restricted from using them unless they met one of the exceptions, which included an exception for the business providing the communication if it needed to do so to ensure the proper functioning of its business.

For law enforcement agencies to get a pen register approved for surveillance, they must get a court order from a judge. According to 18 U.S.C. § 3123(a)(1), the &quot;court shall enter an ex parte order authorizing the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device anywhere within the United States, if the court finds that the attorney for the Government has certified to the court that the information likely to be obtained by such installation and use is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation&quot;. Thus, a government attorney only needs to certify that information will &quot;likely&quot; be obtained in relation to an &#x27;ongoing criminal investigation&#x27;. This is the lowest requirement for receiving a court order under any of the ECPA&#x27;s three titles. This is because in &quot;Smith v. Maryland&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that use of a pen register does not constitute a search. The ruling held that only the content of a conversation should receive full constitutional protection under the right to privacy; since pen registers do not intercept conversation, they do not pose as much threat to this right.

Some have argued that the government should be required to present &quot;specific and articulable facts&quot; showing that the information to be gathered is relevant and material to an ongoing investigation. This is the standard used by Title II of the ECPA with regard to the contents of stored communications. Others, such as Daniel J. Solove, Petricia Bellia, and Dierdre Mulligan, believe that probable cause and a warrant should be necessary. Paul Ohm argues that standard of proof should be replaced/reworked for electronic communications altogether.

The Pen Register Act did not include an exclusionary rule. While there were civil remedies for violations of the Act, evidence gained in violation of the Act can still be used against a defendant in court. There have also been calls for Congress to add an exclusionary rule to the Pen Register Act, as this would make it more analogous to traditional Fourth Amendment protections. The penalty for violating the Pen Register Act is a misdemeanor, and it carries a prison sentence of not more than one year.

== USA PATRIOT Act ==

Section 216 of the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act expanded the definition of a pen register to include devices or programs that provide an analogous function with Internet communications. Prior to the Patriot Act, it was unclear whether or not the definition of a pen register, which included very specific telephone terminology, could apply to Internet communications. Most courts and law enforcement personnel operated under the assumption that it did, however, the Clinton administration had begun to work on legislation to make that clear, and one magistrate judge in California did rule that the language was too telephone-specific to apply to Internet surveillance.

The Pen Register Statute is a privacy act. As there is no constitutional protection for information divulged to a third party under the Supreme Court&#x27;s expectation of privacy test, and the routing information for phone and Internet communications are divulged to the company providing the communication, the absence or inapplicability of the statute would leave the routing information for those communications completely unprotected from government surveillance.

The government also has an interest in making sure the Pen Register Act exists and applies to Internet communications. Without the Act, they cannot compel service providers to give them records or do Internet surveillance with their own equipment or software, and the law enforcement agency, which may not have very good technological capabilities, will have to do the surveillance itself at its own cost.

Rather than creating new laws regarding Internet surveillance, the Patriot Act simply expanded the definition of a pen register to include computer software programs doing Internet surveillance by accessing information. While not completely compatible with the technical definition of a pen register device, this was the interpretation that had been used by almost all courts and law enforcement agencies prior to the change.

== NSA call database controversy ==

When, in 2006, the Bush administration came under fire for having secretly collected billions of phone call details from regular Americans, ostensibly to check for calls to terror suspects, the Pen Register Act was cited, along with the Stored Communications Act, as an example of how such domestic spying violated Federal law.

In 2013, the Obama administration sought a court order &quot;requiring Verizon on an &#x27;ongoing, daily basis&#x27; to give the NSA information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the US and between the US and other countries&quot;. The order was approved on April 25, 2013, by federal Judge Roger Vinson, member of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), which court had been created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The order gave the government unlimited authority to compel Verizon to collect and provide the data for a specified three-month period ending on July 19. This is the first time significant and top-secret documents have been revealed exposing the continuation of the practice on a massive scale under U.S. President Barack Obama.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;it is not known whether Verizon is the only cell-phone provider to be targeted with such an order, although previous reporting has suggested the NSA has collected cell records from all major mobile networks. It is also unclear from the leaked document whether the three-month order was a one-off or the latest in a series of similar orders&quot;.

== Hemisphere DEA call database controversy ==
On September 1, 2013, the DEA&#x27;s Hemisphere Project was revealed to the public by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In a series of PowerPoint slides acquired through a lawsuit, AT&amp;T is revealed to be operating a call database going back to 1987 which the DEA has warrantless access to with no judicial oversight under &quot;administrative subpoenas&quot; originated by the DEA. The DEA pays AT&amp;T to maintain employees throughout the country devoted to investigating call records through this database for the DEA. The database grows by 4 billion records per day, and presumably covers all traffic that crosses AT&amp;T&#x27;s network. Internal directives instructed participants never to reveal the project publicly, despite the fact that the project was portrayed as a &quot;routine&quot; part of DEA investigations; several investigations unrelated to drugs have been mentioned as using the data. When questioned on their participation, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile refused to comment on whether they were part of the project, generating fears that &quot;pen registers&quot; and &quot;trap and trace&quot; devices are effectively irrelevant in the face of ubiquitous private-public-partnership surveillance with indefinite data retention.

<doc id="532456" wikidata="Q1544958" url="?curid=532456" title="Gregory Keyes">
<text>Gregory Keyes (born April 11, 1963) is an American writer of science fiction and fantasy who has written both original and media-related novels under both the names J. Gregory Keyes and Greg Keyes.

==Early life==
Keyes was born in Meridian, Mississippi, as John Gregory Keyes. He received degrees in anthropology from Mississippi State University and the University of Georgia before becoming a full-time writer.

==Writing career==
He is famous for his tetralogy &quot;The Age of Unreason&quot;, a steampunk/alchemical story featuring Benjamin Franklin and Isaac Newton. He wrote the Babylon 5 &quot;Psi Corps&quot; trilogy, a history of the Psi Corps and a biography of Psi Corps member Alfred Bester.

In 2003 he began a fantasy series titled &quot;The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone&quot;, the first volume of which was &quot;The Briar King&quot;. The second book in the series &quot;The Charnel Prince&quot; was published in 2004 and the third, &quot;The Blood Knight&quot;, was published in July 2006. His fourth and final book of the quartet, &quot;The Born Queen&quot;, was released in March 2008.

In 2009 it was announced that Keyes would be writing two novels based on the successful computer game &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot;. The first of these, &quot;The Infernal City&quot;, was published by Random House in November 2009. The second, &quot;Lord of Souls&quot;, went on sale on September 27, 2011.

==Style==
Greg Keyes builds his stories around multiple main characters who meet only rarely, but allow the reader to follow different threads of the same events. Most of the chapters in his books focus on one of the main characters. Chapters often end in a surprise or a cliffhanger as the story moves to follow another character.

Keyes&#x27;s knowledge of fencing and linguistics also figures heavily in his books. For example, Stephen Darige, one of the main characters in &quot;The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone&quot;, is an adept linguist, and his knowledge and skills play an important role in the development of the story.

<text>John Gray (January 6, 1764 – March 29, 1868) was the last verified veteran of the American Revolutionary War. He was confirmed a veteran of the war and awarded a pension of $500 semi-annually by House Bill 1044 (passed by Congress February 22, 1866). Journalist/attorney James M. Dalzell wrote a book (published by Gibson Brothers, Printers in 1868) titled &quot;John Gray, of Mount Vernon: the Last Soldier of the Revolution&quot;. As of the Fall of 1867 after the death of Samuel Downing in Edinburgh, Saratoga County, New York, John Gray was then believed by the Bureau of Pensions of the U.S. Department of the Interior to be the last surviving veteran.

His claim to the &quot;last surviving veteran&quot; of the War depends primarily on the failure of his competitors Daniel F. Bakeman and George Fruits (the former died a year later and the latter died several years after him) to prove service during the war. Samuel Downing and Gray had been granted pensions, by special act of the U.S. Congress (in February 1867, retroactive to June 1, 1866). The special act was required because the two had not previously applied for pensions or service land grants. Bakeman was unable to prove his service; Gray, while able to prove his service, had only served six months; Fruits had never had any pension.

Gray was born near the Mount Vernon plantation, home of George Washington. His father, John Gray Sr., fought in the war and was killed in the Battle of White Plains. Gray joined at age 16 in 1780, and was present at the Battle of Yorktown. After the war he moved to the Northwest Territory, and lived out most of his life in Noble County, Ohio. He had three wives during his life and fathered at least four children. He died at age 104 years, 2 months, 23 days.

A memorial to Gray is located along State Route 821 in Noble County&#x27;s Noble Township.

<text>The Tai, Zhuang–Tai, or Daic languages (Ahom: 𑜁𑜪𑜨 𑜄𑜩 or 𑜁𑜨𑜉𑜫 𑜄𑜩 ; ; or , ; , ) are a branch of the Kra–Dai language family. The Tai languages include the most widely spoken of the Tai–Kadai languages, including Standard Thai or Siamese, the national language of Thailand; Lao or Laotian, the national language of Laos; Myanmar&#x27;s Shan language; and Zhuang, a major language in the Southwestern China&#x27;s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, spoken by the Zhuang people (), the largest minority ethnic group in China, with a population of 15.55 million, living mainly in Guangxi, the rest scattered across Yunnan, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Hunan provinces.

==Name==
Cognates with the name &quot;Tai&quot; (&quot;Thai&quot;, &quot;Dai&quot;, etc.) are used by speakers of many Tai languages. The term &quot;Tai&quot; is now well-established as the generic name in English. In his book&quot; The Tai-Kadai Languages&quot;, Anthony Diller claims that Lao scholars he has met are not pleased with Lao being regarded as a Tai language. For some, Thai should instead be considered a member of the Lao language family. One or more Ancient Chinese characters for &#x27;Lao&#x27; may be cited in support of this alternative appellation. Some scholars, including Benedict (1975), have used &quot;Thai&quot; to refer to a wider (&quot;Tai&quot;) grouping and one sees designations like &quot;proto-Thai&quot; and &quot;Austro-Thai&quot; in earlier works. In the institutional context in Thailand, and occasionally elsewhere, sometimes &quot;Tai&quot; (and its corresponding Thai-script spelling, without a final -y symbol) is used to indicate varieties in the language family not spoken in Thailand or spoken there only as the result of recent immigration. In this usage, &quot;Thai&quot; would not then be considered a &quot;Tai&quot; language. On the other hand, Gedney, Li and others have preferred to call the standard language of Thailand &quot;Siamese&quot; rather than &quot;Thai&quot;, perhaps to reduce potential &quot;Thai/Tai&quot; confusion, especially among English speakers not comfortable with making a word-initial unaspirated voiceless sound for &quot;Tai&quot;, which in any event might sound artificial or arcane to outsiders.

According to Michel Ferlus, the ethnonyms Tai/Thai (or Tay/Thay) would have evolved from the etymon *k(ə)ri: &#x27;human being&#x27; through the following chain: kəri: &gt; kəli: &gt; kədi:/kədaj (-l- &gt; -d- shift in tense sesquisyllables and probable diphthongization of -i: &gt; -aj). This in turn changed to di:/daj (presyllabic truncation and probable diphthongization -i: &gt; -aj). And then to *dajA (Proto-Southwestern Tai) &gt; tʰajA2 (in Siamese and Lao) or &gt; tajA2 (in the other Southwestern and Central Tai languages by Li Fangkuei). Michel Ferlus&#x27; work is based on some simple rules of phonetic change observable in the Sinosphere and studied for the most part by William H. Baxter (1992).

The Central Tai languages are called &quot;Zhuang&quot; in China and &quot;Tay&quot; and &quot;Nung&quot; in Vietnam.

==History==

Citing the fact that both the Zhuang and Thai peoples have the same exonym for the Vietnamese, &quot;kɛɛuA1&quot;, derived from the name of Jiaozhi in Vietnam, and that the indigenous Bai Yue were given family names by their northern rulers during the Northern and Southern dynasties, while the Thai didn&#x27;t have family names into the 19th century, Jerold A. Edmondson of the University of Texas at Arlington posited that the split between Zhuang (a Central Tai language) and the Southwestern Tai languages happened no earlier than the founding of Jiaozhi in 112 BCE but no later than the 5th–6th century AD. Based on layers of Chinese loanwords in Proto-Southwestern Tai and other historical evidence, Pittayawat Pittayaporn (2014) suggests that the dispersal of Southwestern Tai must have begun sometime between the 8th and 10th centuries AD.

===Connection to ancient Yue language(s)===

The Tai languages descend from proto-Tai-Kadai, which has been hypothesized to originate in the Lower Yangtze valleys. Ancient Chinese texts refer to non-Sinitic languages spoken across this substantial region and their speakers as &quot;Yue&quot;. Although those languages are extinct, traces of their existence could be found in unearthed inscriptional materials, ancient Chinese historical texts and non-Han substrata in various Southern Chinese dialects. Thai, as the most-spoken language in the Tai-Kadai language family, has been used extensively in historical-comparative linguistics to identify the origins of language(s) spoken in the ancient region of South China. One of the very few direct records of non-Sinitic speech in pre-Qin and Han times having been preserved so far is the &quot;Song of the Yue Boatman&quot; (Yueren Ge 越人歌), which was transcribed phonetically in Chinese characters in 528 BC, and found in the 善说 Shanshuo chapter of the Shuoyuan 说苑 or &#x27;Garden of Persuasions&#x27;. In the early 1980s the Zhuang linguist Wei Qingwen using reconstructed Old Chinese for the characters discovered that the resulting vocabulary showed strong resemblance to modern Zhuang. Later, Zhengzhang Shangfang (1991) followed Wei&#x27;s insight but used Thai orthography for comparison, since this orthography dates from the 13th century and preserves archaisms vis-à-vis the modern pronunciation.

==Internal classification==

===Haudricourt (1956)===
Haudricourt emphasizes the specificity of Dioi (Zhuang) and proposes to make a two-way distinction between the following two sets. The original language names used in Haudricourt&#x27;s (1956) are provided first; alternative names are given in parentheses.
* Tai
** Dioi group: Yei Zhuang, Yongbei Zhuang, Youjiang Zhuang, Bouyei (Buyi)
** Tai proper: Ahom, Shan, Siamese (Thai), Lao, White Tai (Tai Dón), Black Tai (Tai Dam), Southern Zhuang, Tho (Tày), Nung
Characteristics of the Dioi group pointed out by Haudricourt are
* r- corresponding to the lateral l- in the other Tai languages,
* divergent vowel system characteristics, e.g. &#x27;tail&#x27; has an /a/ vowel in Tai proper, as against /ə̄/ in Bo-ai, /iə/ in Tianzhou, and /ɯə/ in Tianzhou and Wuming, and
* the lack of aspirated stops and affricates, which are found everywhere in Tai proper.

===Li (1977)===
Li Fang-Kuei divided Tai into three sister branches.
* Tai
** Northern Tai
** Central Tai
** Southwestern Tai (Thai)
Li&#x27;s Northern group corresponds to Haudricourt&#x27;s Dioi group, while his Central and Southwestern groups correspond to Haudricourt&#x27;s Tai proper. The three last languages in Haudricourt&#x27;s list of &#x27;Tai proper&#x27; languages are Tho (Tày), Longzhou, and Nung, which Li classifies as &#x27;Central Tai&#x27;.

This classification scheme has long been accepted as standard in comparative Tai linguistics. However, Central Tai does not appear to be a monophyletic group.

===Gedney (1989)===
Gedney (1989) considers Central and Southwestern Tai to form a subgroup, of which Northern Tai is a sister. The top-level branching is in agreement with Haudricourt (1956).
* Tai
** Northern Tai
*** Central Tai
*** Southwestern Tai
===Luo (1997)===
Luo Yongxian (1997) classifies the Tai languages as follows, introducing a fourth branch called &quot;Northwestern Tai&quot; that includes Ahom, Shan, Dehong Dai, and Khamti. All branches are considered to be coordinate to each other.
* Tai
** Northern Tai
** Central Tai
** Southwestern Tai
** Northwestern Tai
===Pittayaporn (2009)===
====Overview====

Pittayawat Pittayaporn (2009) classifies the Tai languages based on clusters of shared innovations (which, individually, may be associated with more than one branch) (Pittayaporn 2009:298). In Pittayaporn&#x27;s preliminary classification system of the Tai languages, Central Tai is considered to be paraphyletic and is split up into multiple branches, with the Zhuang varieties of Chongzuo in southwestern Guangxi (especially in the Zuo River valley at the border to Vietnam) having the most internal diversity. The Southwestern Tai and Northern Tai branches remain intact as in Li Fang-Kuei&#x27;s 1977 classification system, and several of the Southern Zhuang languages allocated ISO codes are considered to be paraphyletic. The classification is as follows.
* Tai
** D: Northern Tai
*** I: Qinzhou Zhuang (Yongnan Zhuang of Qinzhou)
*** J
**** M: Wuming Zhuang, Yongnan Zhuang, Long&#x27;an Zhuang, Fusui
**** N: Core Northern Tai: Saek, Bouyei, Yay, Youjiang Zhuang and others
** C: Chongzuo Zhuang (Yongnan Zhuang of Chongzuo), Shangsi Zhuang (Yongnan Zhuang of Shangsi), Caolan (Vietnam)
** B: Ningming Zhuang (Zuojiang Zhuang of Ningming)
** A
*** F: Lungchow Zhuang, Leiping Zhuang
*** E
**** H: Lungming Zhuang, Daxin Zhuang
**** G
***** L (Nung): Yang Zhuang of Debao, Yang Zhuang of Jingxi, (Western) Nung of Mường Khương District, Nong Zhuang of Wenshan City), Nong Zhuang of Yanshan
***** K
****** P (Tay): Tày of Bảo Yên, Tày of Cao Bằng, Dai Zhuang of Wenma (文麻)
****** O
******* R: Sapa (Vietnam)
******* Q: Southwestern Tai (Laos, Thailand, Burma)
Standard Zhuang is based on the dialect of Shuangqiao (双桥), Wuming District.

====Sound changes====
The following phonological shifts occurred in the Q (Southwestern), N (Northern), B (Ningming), and C (Chongzuo) subgroups (Pittayaporn 2009:300–301).

Furthermore, the following shifts occurred at various nodes leading up to node Q.
* E: *p.t- &gt; *p.r-; *ɯm &gt; *ɤm
* G: *k.r- &gt; *qr-
* K: *eː, *oː &gt; *ɛː, *ɔː
* O: *ɤn &gt; *on
* Q: *kr- &gt; *ʰr-

===Edmondson (2013)===
Jerold A. Edmondson&#x27;s (2013) computational phylogenetic analysis of the Tai languages is shown below. Tay and Nung are both shown to be coherent branches under Central Tai. Northern Tai and Southwestern Tai are also shown to be coherent branches.
* Tai
** Northern Tai: Buyi, Yay, Po-Ai, Wuming Zhuang, Mashan Zhuang
*** Central Tai
**** core Central Tai: Nung Chau, Pingxiang Zhuang, Leiping Zhuang, Ningming Zhuang
**** Nung: Western Nung, Nung Yang, Nung An, Thu Lao
**** Tay: Tay Bao Lac, Tay Khanh Trung, Cao Lan
*** Southwestern Tai: Ahom, Shan, Dehong, Tai Theeng (Nghe An), Black Tai, White Tai, Padi, Lao, Thai
==Reconstruction==
Proto-Tai has been reconstructed in 1977 by Li Fang-Kuei and by Pittayawat Pittayaporn in 2009. Proto-Southwestern Tai has also been reconstructed in 1977 by Li Fang-Kuei and by Nanna L. Jonsson in 1991.

Others have taken up specific area reconstructions, such as David Strecker&#x27;s 1984 work regarding &quot;Proto-Tai Personal Pronouns.&quot; Strecker&#x27;s proposed system of personal pronouns in Proto-Tai involves &quot;three numbers, three persons, an inclusive/exclusive distinction and an animate/non-animate distinction in the third person non-singular.&quot;

==Comparison==

Below is comparative table of Tai languages.
==Writing systems==

Many Southwestern Tai languages are written using Brahmi-derived alphabets. Zhuang languages are traditionally written with Chinese characters called Sawndip, and now officially written with a romanized alphabet, though the traditional writing system is still in use to this day.
* Thai script
* Lao script
* Sawndip
* Shan script
* Ahom script
* Tai Viet script
* Tai Le script
* New Tai Lue alphabet
* Tai Tham script

<text>Laupheim (; ) is a major district town in southern Germany in the state of Baden-Württemberg. Laupheim was first mentioned in 778 and gained city rights in 1869. One of the main trading routes, from Ulm to Ravensburg and then on towards Lake Constance ran through Laupheim. Having developed from a rural settlement into a small urban area, Laupheim is home to a number of small to medium-sized industries and businesses. One of the largest employers are the German Armed Forces which maintain an airbase close to Laupheim, Laupheim Air Base.

Laupheim was the administrative centre of the district of Laupheim from 1842 until 1938 when the district was abolished. The southern parts of it were incorporated into the district of Biberach (including Laupheim itself) whereas the remainders were allocated to the district of Ulm.

In the second half of the 19th century Laupheim was home to the largest Jewish community in the Kingdom of Württemberg.

After World War II, Laupheim became part of the French occupation zone in 1945 and became part of the newly founded state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern in 1947.

Laupheim is the educational centre for the surrounding rural areas particularly with regards to secondary education.

== Geography ==

Laupheim is situated in the region of Upper Swabia approximately 20 km north of Biberach and 20 km south of Ulm on the Bundesstraße 30. Laupheim is the second largest city in the district of Biberach. The original settlement of Laupheim was located close to the Rottum which still runs through the city but since 1950 the city has expanded and sprawls onto the surrounding slopes.

With effect of 1 Januar 2016 Laupheim has been awarded the status of major district town.

The elevation within the city confines ranges from 509 m (1670 ft) above sea level at the bottom of the valley to 539 m (1768 ft) in the outlying suburban areas.

Apart from the city of Laupheim itself, the following once autonomous villages nowadays belong administratively to Laupheim: Baustetten (population 2121), Obersulmetingen (population 1389), Untersulmetingen (population 2082) and Bihlafingen (population 853), which, with an elevation of 580 m (1903 ft), has the highest elevation of the administrative area.

== History ==
The area in and around Laupheim has been settled from very early times onwards. Archaeological evidence shows that 15000 years ago nomadic tribes roamed the countryside. From ca. 2000 BCE onwards, Celts inhabited this area. From the first century CE until around the year 260 CE, it was part of the Roman province of Raetia, after which the Alamanni invaded the &quot;Agri Decumates&quot;, eventually also settling in the area that was to become Laupheim. During archaeological excavations in 1840-1842 graves dating from the Merovingian period were discovered in the northern part of the town.

Laupheim was first mentioned as &quot;Louphaim&quot; in a charter dated 778. The charter is still kept in the archives of the monastery of St Gallen, Switzerland. This reference is the earliest of any city in Upper Swabia and any parish in the district of Biberach.

Situated in the vicinity of two major trade routes between the Lake of Constance and Ulm and the Swabian Alb and the valley of the river Iller respectively, Laupheim developed into a major settlement. In 853, it was elevated to the status of town when a court responsible for the &quot;Rammachgau&quot; (also spelled &quot;Rammagau&quot;) was set up there.

During the 9th century, parts of Laupheim came into the possession of the monastery of Weißenburg which was afterwards passed on to successive minor Swabian aristocratic houses.

As early as the 10th century, Laupheim possessed a parish church with subsidiaries. In 926, Laupheim and its surroundings were destroyed by the Hungarians. A castle is mentioned around the year 1100.

Laupheim appears to have been home of an indigenous noble family, whose members used the suffix &quot;von Laupheim.&quot; They were attested for the first time in 1110 with Landoldus de Lobhein and seemed to have been in service of the counts of Kirchberg. The last known member of this family was Berchtolt von Laupheim who was a citizen of Ulm 1372, long after his family has lost possession of any rights in Laupheim around 1310.

After the collapse of the Empire of the Staufers during the 13th century, the castle and parish of Laupheim came into the possession of the Truchsessen von Waldburg who, in 1331, sold Laupheim together with their other possessions in Upper Swabia to the Austrian House of Habsburg.

The Habsburgs mortgaged Laupheim in 1334 to the barons von Ellerbach and enfeoffed this baronial family in 1407 with castle, town and patronage of the church.

The village was badly affected by the crisis of the mid 14th century, caused by the Black Death and other factors. The population shrunk and as a consequence the hamlet of Ringelhausen, situated between Laupheim and Bronnen, was abandoned and eventually lost in the 15th century. Only the name of a street and a development area in the city of Laupheim nowadays hints at the existence of this hamlet.

The Herren von Ellerbach had St Leonhard&#x27;s Chapel built in 1448, which soon became a place of pilgrimage.

In 1430, Emperor Sigismund bestowed upon Burkhard von Ellerbach the right to hold regular markets, Laupheim thereby becoming a market town, and also the privilege of inflicting high justice, which gave him the right to hold a criminal court inflicting bodily punishment, including the death penalty. The local ruler was now master of life and death. Due to the weekly market and the annual Gallus-market, Laupheim quickly developed into a commercial centre.

During the course of the German Peasants&#x27; War 1525, Laupheim Castle was destroyed by the Baltringer Haufen, an army of peasants named after the nearby village of Baltringen, where approximately 12.000 farmers gathered to form an army. After the suppression of the revolt, the peasants were forced to rebuild the castle.

After the agnatic line of the Ellerbach dynasty became extinct in 1570, Laupheim passed through Hans Pankraz von Freyberg to the Herren von Welden in 1582. They turned Laupheim into their permanent residence and established the first school in 1584. From 1582 until 1806, Laupheim was a Lordship (&quot;Reichsritterschaft&quot;) ruled by the heir of the Welden family, whose title was &quot;Imperial Knight&quot; (&quot;Reichsritter&quot;).
In 1596, the right to bear a coat of arms was given to Laupheim, showing the colours of green, white and red together with three leaves on a three hills, thereby incorporating the coat-of-arms of the family of Welden with the three leaves, referring to the name of the town on the hills of the valley of the river Rottum.

The last member of the House of Ellerbach, Anna von Freyberg, founded the Hospital of the Holy Spirit in 1601, the building of which still exists and now functions as a retirement home.

Between 1623 and 1661, the church St. Peter and Paul was built in the vicinity of the castle.

Due to the inheritance laws of the house of Welden, the market town was divided into two different territories, &quot;Großlaupheim&quot; and &quot;Kleinlaupheim&quot; (&quot;Great Laupheim&quot; and &quot;Little Laupheim&quot;), in 1621, at the beginning of the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), each territory being ruled by its own dynasty. As a consequence economic growth slowed down.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Laupheim repeatedly fell victim to the ravages of war, mainly due to marauding troops, both imperial, that is Catholic, and Swedish, their Protestant opponents. A massive outbreak of the bubonic plague in 1635 further diminished the population. At the close of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Laupheim had lost two-thirds of its pre-war population, so that ultimately towards the end of the 17th century, Laupheim had sunk to the status of an unimportant, impoverished village. As a consequence of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the feudal lords attempted to increase taxation and extend the amount of socage the peasants had to do for them. This led to legal conflicts between the two parties, which lasted for decades.
In order to stimulate the local economy and income generated by taxation, Carl Damian von Welden allowed the first Jewish families to settle in Großlaupheim in the 1720s. This which was made possible by a contract, protecting the Jews. The Jews were made to settle in an area of the town soon to be called &quot;Judenberg&quot; (literally &quot;Jews&#x27; mountain&quot; or &quot;Jews&#x27; hill&quot;). Subsequently, a Jewish quarter evolved, with a cemetery, synagogue, school and a Rabbi&#x27;s office.

During the 18th century, the Welden dynasty had the old castle, &quot;Großlaupheim Castle&quot;, restored, and subsequently renewed in Baroque-style in 1752. Between 1766 and 1769, the branch of the Welden dynasty that ruled Kleinlaupheim had their residence renewed in Baroque-style by architect Johann Georg Specht. This castle is now called &quot;Schloss Kleinlaupheim&quot; (Kleinlaupheim Castle). This makes Laupheim unique in that it has two castles within its city boundaries, as a result of once having been two independent states.
In 1778, a town hall and the granary were built in the Upper Market Square.

Following the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, the mediatisation and secularisation of numerous secular and ecclesiastical principalities within the former Holy Roman Empire, both parts of Laupheim were annexed by the newly formed Kingdom of Württemberg in 1806. The last ruler of Laupheim was Constantin von Welden. Laupheim first became administratively part of the district of Wiblingen, but in 1845 the district administration was moved to Laupheim, creating the district of Laupheim. The district as abolished in 1938 when Laupheim became part of the district of Biberach.

Due to laws based on the ideas of the enlightenment, servitude in the Kingdom of Württemberg was abolished in 1836. During the same period, laws forcing Jews to live in separate quarters and excluding them from most business activities were revoked. This enabled them to contribute enormously to the economic upturn Laupheim was experiencing, even though complete civil rights were not granted until 1864.

In 1848, with the arrival of civil servants from the original Duchy of Württemberg (&quot;Altwürttemberg&quot;), a Protestant parish was founded.

In 1850, a train station opened two kilometers west of Laupheim, on the railway line Ulm-Friedrichshafen from Ulm to Friedrichshafen, this station therefore being named as Laupheim-West.

In 1869, Laupheim was granted a city charter by King Karl I. of Württemberg. In the same year, the first institute of further education, a &quot;Lateinschule,&quot; was established in Laupheim. In 1871, Laupheim, being part of the Kingdom of Württemberg, was incorporated into the German Empire.
During the steep economic growth of the Gründerzeit, the period between 1871 and 1914, Laupheim had the highest density of public houses in the whole Kingdom of Württemberg.

In 1904, the city was connected to the railway line Ulm-Friedrichshafen by a branch line, linking the railway artery with the city itself. At the same time a train station was built in the city. This extension of the railway line went on for a further 16 km, terminating at the village of Schwendi.
Before World War I, Laupheim had one of the largest Jewish communities in Württemberg. However, the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and the systematic deprivation and subsequent suppression of Jews in Germany, also had their effects on Laupheim, culminating in the destruction by fire of the synagogue during Kristallnacht 1938.

Due to the programme of aryanization, many businesses in Laupheim originally owned by Jews, were expropriated and transferred into German ownership. 126 of 312 Jewish inhabitants of Laupheim managed to flee abroad, most of them after the so-called &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. In 1939, the remaining Jews in Laupheim were resettled within the city, only to be deported to concentration and extermination camps in 1941 and 1942. After the last of four transports, the Jewish community in Laupheim ceased to exist on 19 August 1942.

Sixty-two Jewish citizens of Laupheim were murdered in the &quot;Shoah&quot;, only two survived.

After World War II, in the 1960s, Laupheim began to renew and modernize its appearance. New schools were built: a grammar school, a realschule and a new town hall. From the 1980s onwards, these projects were followed by a new district hospital, a public in-doors swimming pool, a renovated stadium, named after Gretel Bergmann who was born in Laupheim, and an omnibus interchange.

Additionally, several industrial estates on the outskirts of the city were established in order to attract trade and industry. As a consequence, companies from outside Laupheim established offices and production facilities there, as well as companies that formerly had been operating from the city centre.

== Population ==
Having developed from a rural market town into a city, predominated by industry, trade and the service industries, the demographics of Laupheim have changed as well.

After growing continuously from 1871 until 1933, from the Gründerzeit until the Nazis came to power, this development came to a halt. The stagnation and eventual decrease in population was due to increasing persecution of the Jews, as a result of which many Jewish inhabitants left Laupheim or, after 1940, were deported and subsequently murdered.

Since 1945, the population of Laupheim has almost doubled. This is due to the fact that a great number of refugees from formerly German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line were settled in Laupheim.

The establishment of a German Army Aviation Corps airbase in 1964 further contributed to the growth in population.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, an influx of ethnic Germans from the Commonwealth of Independent States added to the population growth.

As of 31 December 2019, the number of non-German inhabitants of Laupheim totals 3,269 (14.58% of the total population).

== Economy, industry and infrastructure ==

=== Traffic ===
* Road: the western borders of the city itself are marked by the Bundesstraße 30. Laupheim is connected by three junctions to this federal road. It was planned to upgrade this federal road to autobahn status, turning it into the A89. These plans were dropped in the early 1980s.
* Railway: the Württemberg Southern Railway (Ulm-Friedrichshafen) passes Laupheim about 2 km from the built-up area. Laupheim-West railway station serves passengers from the surrounding area. From this railway station another line branches off into Laupheim, terminating at the city railway station. It was part of a longer railway line, originally leading to Schwendi. However, during the 1970s and 1980s, the whole extension was gradually closed down, dismantled, and the service replaced by buses. Only the section leading from the city railway station to Laupheim-West remained and was later renovated and re-opened in 1999 with a direct connection to Langenau via Ulm Central Station. Passengers travelling south to Biberach an der Riß still had to change trains at Laupheim-West station. Plans existed, however, to establish direct trains from Laupheim to Biberach an der Riß. In June 2011, after construction works lasting two years a new southern route towards Biberach was opened. In order to facilitate railway traffic a second railway platform was built at Laupheim city station.

Until the beginning of the 1990s the regiment had only seen service in other NATO countries, mainly while on manoeuvre or on aid-missions after natural disasters. Since then, however, it has been deployed abroad on various aid-missions and so far has seen service on NATO and United Nations peacekeeping missions, first in Iraq after the 1st Gulf War, then on the Balkans with IFOR, KFOR, SFOR and EUFOR, in Afghanistan as part of ISAF, which is ongoing, and most recently in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as part of EUFOR RD Congo to support the UN mission MONUC to monitor the general elections in 2006. This mission began in June 2006 and ended with the last soldiers returning in December of the same year.

== Attractions ==

=== Großlaupheim Castle ===

Großlaupheim Castle is situated on a hill on the verge of the city close to the local parish church.
The existence of a castle in Laupheim was documented for the first time around the year 1100. There is no evidence that the castle originally consisted of more than a wooden structure. This castle existed until the Peasants&#x27; War in 1525, when it was destroyed by rebellious peasants. After the end of hostilities, the peasants were forced to rebuild the castle in stone. The structure as it stands today was erected in three different phases:
* The so-called Feudal Castle &quot;(Lehenschloss),&quot; the oldest part, dates from the middle of the 16th century. It consists of a three-storey, square edifice with two flanking round towers.
* Adjoining it, the so-called New Castle &quot;(Neues Schloss)&quot; (built between 1660 and 1680) with an early Baroque square flanked by arcades and a gateway.

* Somewhat removed but still part of the complex, the so-called Little Castle (&quot;Kleines Schlössle&quot;) was built in the middle of the 17th century. It was used by the Freiherren von Welden as dwelling place for the widows of former rulers of Laupheim. On a terrace below the castle buildings, a small rose garden was designed in Baroque-style.

=== Museum of the History of Christians and Jews ===
The Museum of the History of Christians and Jews is situated in Großlaupheim Castle. It is unique in Germany in that its collection concentrates on the documentation of the relationship between Christians and Jews on a local level, using Laupheim, which once had the largest Jewish community in the Kingdom of Württemberg, as an example. The exhibition documents in chronological order all aspects of more than 200 years of Jewish life in Laupheim.

=== Castle Park ===

The park is situated at the bottom of the hill on top of which &quot;Schloss Großlaupheim&quot; lies. The castle park was designed in the English Style by Kilian von Steiner. A huge number of trees, meadows and lakes created an impressive appearance. Originally, it was well known for its exotic trees and plants. Formerly, there were five lakes, which, during winter, provided a brewery with ice. During summer, the lakes were used for raising trout. However, in recent times the maintenance of the ground and the lakes was neglected due to a lack of council funding. In recent years efforts have been made to restore the park, at least in parts, to its former glory. In 2011, the park was declared a &quot;Garden Monument&#x27; by the state of Baden-Württemberg&#x27;s National Trust.

=== Kleinlaupheim Castle ===

Kleinlaupheim Castle is situated on a hill south-west of the river Rottum within the city limits of Laupheim.
In its present state it was built between 1766 and 1769 as a place of residence for the ruler of Kleinlaupheim at the time, the Freiherr Joseph Ignaz von Welden-Kleinlaupheim (1721–1802). It was designed by Johann Georg Specht of Lindenberg in Baroque-style. It consists of a three-storey building with a curved mansard roof. Pilasters, cornices and gables enliven the facade of the building. Inside there is a remarkable grand staircase in the vestibule.

It now houses the local police station and an art gallery, &quot;Die Wache Galerie&quot;, a pun on words in that &quot;Wache&quot; can mean police station as well as alert or awake.

=== Parish Church St Peter and Paul ===
The Parish Church St Peter and Paul, built between 1623 and 1661, lies in close proximity to Großlaupheim Castle. It was designed by Martino I. Barbieri from Roveredo in Baroque-style, showing influences of manierism. The interior of the church is decorated with sculptures by Dominikus Hermenegild Herberger and paintings by Johann Georg Bergmüller.

=== Planetarium and Public Observatory ===
The planetarium and public astronomical observatory of Laupheim () counts about 40000 visitors each year. It is run on a mostly voluntary basis by the club &quot;Volkssternwarte Laupheim e.V.&quot; (founded 1975), providing high quality astronomical education. The work of the club has been recognized by astronomer Carolyn Shoemaker, who named the asteroid 7167 Laupheim in honour of the institution.

=== The &quot;Laupheimer Kinder- und Heimatfest&quot; ===
The annual historical festival, the &quot;Kinder- und Heimatfest&quot;, takes place during the last weekend of June. It consists of processions and parades, performed by various groups, incorporating performances in historical costumes, concert bands and floats, referring to contemporary and historical events. There is also a funfair, accompanied by several pole marquees, as well as much revelling in the bars, cafes and pubs of the city.

=== &quot;Brunnenfest&quot; ===
On the last Sunday of the summer holidays, the traditional &quot;Brunnenfest&quot; (fountain party) takes place in the city centre. A street party, it is concentrated on the Upper and Lower Market Square. The name of the event derives from the Neptune-fountain, situated in the Upper Market Square. A great number of stalls serves Swabian and international cuisine as well as a large variety of beverages. The stalls are organised and staffed by local clubs. Concert bands, Jazz bands and Volksmusik bands entertain visitors. On a stage dance and sport performances are shown. Additionally, a flea market is held at the same time.

<text>The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is a regulatory body set up by the Government of India under section 3 of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997. It is the regulator of the telecommunications sector in India. It consists of a chairperson and not more than two full-time members and not more than two part-time members. The TRAI Act was amended by an ordinance, effective from 24 January 2000, establishing a Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal to take over the adjudicatory and disputes functions from TRAI.

==History==
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India was established on 20 February 1997 by an Act of Parliament to regulate telecom services and tariffs in India. Earlier, regulation of telecom services and tariffs was overseen by the Central Government.

TRAI&#x27;s mission is to create and nurture conditions for the growth of telecommunications in India to enable the country to have a leading role in the emerging global information society.

One of its main objectives is to provide a fair and transparent environment that promotes a level playing field and facilitates fair competition in the market. TRAI regularly issues orders and directions on various subjects such as tariffs, interconnections, quality of service, direct to home services and mobile number portability.

In January 2016, TRAI introduced an important change in telecommunication to the benefit of consumers, where they would be compensated for every dropped call, subject to a maximum of three dropped calls in a day. In May 2016, this regulation was revoked by the Supreme Court on the grounds of being &quot;unreasonable, arbitrary and unconstitutional&quot;.

===Secretariat===

TRAI is administered through a secretariat headed by a secretary. All proposals are processed by the secretary, who organises the agenda for authority meetings (consulting with the chairperson), prepares the minutes and issues regulations in accordance to the meetings. The secretary is assisted by advisors. These include Mobile Network, Interconnection and FixeNetwork, BroadBand and Policy Analysis, Quality of Service, Broadcasting &amp; Cable Services, Economic Regulation, Financial Analysis &amp; IFA, Legal, Consumer Affairs &amp; International Relation and Administration &amp; Personnel. Officers are selected from the Indian Telecommunications Service and the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). 

===List of Chairpersons (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India)===
List of Chairpersons:
=== TRAI Mobile Apps ===
On 6 June 2017, TRAI launched three new apps and a web portal to highlight the telecom services that are being offered to the users.

Mycall app, MySpeed app and Do not disturb (DND 2.0) apps can be used to ensure that there is transparency between what consumers are paying for and what telecom operators are promising to provide at a certain rate.

In December 2018, TRAI released another app called TRAI Channel Selector. Using this app, they can add, remove and manage their channels.

=== Recent TRAI initiatives ===
In order to increase broadband penetration in India, TRAI has proposed WANI (Wi-Fi Access Network Interface) architecture. If implemented, it may lead to set up of Public Data Offices (PDOs) where Wi-FI Internet would be available on demand. TRAI relates the same with PCOs which were used to do the voice calls and were very popular hotspots before the mobile phones or home landlines became the ultimate mode of communication.

== TRAI reports ==
To increase transparency and give a data-based overview of Indian Telecom Industry at regular intervals, TRAI publishes multiple reports under Release/Publication &quot;Reports&quot; section on its website.

== Controversies and Criticism ==

=== Jio ===
The TRAI has been accused of bending its rules multiple times to let Jio, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited, become a market leader in the span of a few years. Jio was allowed to &quot;test&quot; its services for a much longer period and with a much larger subscriber base than was the industrial norm. In a letter to the telecom department, Rajan Mathews of the Cellular Operators Association of India wrote that Reliance&#x27;s offers were &quot;full-blown and full-fledged services masquerading as tests, which bypass regulations and can potentially game policy features.&quot; TRAI was also accused of modifying its definition of &quot;significant market power&quot; so as to exclude Jio from strict scrutiny. Whilst initially the definition of market power was based on total network activity, the parameters were changed to subscriber share and gross revenue. Jio qualified as a significant market power according to the first definition, but not the second.

===Airport Wi-fi Access Regulations===
The TRAI has been criticized for making Wi-Fi difficult to access at airports across India. As per several TRAI officials, Wi-Fi access across airports, that requires a pin through phone numbers, has been cited due to security reasons and KYC (know your customer) requirements, and limited accessibility for 45 minutes. The system has been slammed by several domestic and international travelers due to inconvenience to international passengers, limited timeframe to use and complicated access.

<doc id="532471" wikidata="Q1050513" url="?curid=532471" title="White swamphen">
<text>The white swamphen (Porphyrio albus), also known as the Lord Howe swamphen, Lord Howe gallinule or white gallinule, is an extinct species of rail which lived on Lord Howe Island, east of Australia. It was first encountered when the crews of British ships visited the island between 1788 and 1790, and all contemporary accounts and illustrations were produced during this time. Today, two skins exist: the holotype in the Natural History Museum of Vienna, and another in Liverpool&#x27;s World Museum. Although historical confusion has existed about the provenance of the specimens and the classification and anatomy of the bird, it is now thought to have been a distinct species endemic to Lord Howe Island and most similar to the Australasian swamphen. Subfossil bones have also been discovered since.

The white swamphen was long. Both known skins have mainly-white plumage, although the Liverpool specimen also has dispersed blue feathers. This is unlike other swamphens, but contemporary accounts indicate birds with all-white, all-blue, and mixed blue-and-white plumage. The chicks were black, becoming blue and then white as they aged. Although this has been interpreted as due to albinism, it may have been progressive greying in which feathers lose their pigment with age. The bird&#x27;s bill, frontal shield and legs were red, and it had a claw (or spur) on its wing. Little was recorded about the white swamphen&#x27;s behaviour. It may not have been flightless, but was probably a poor flier. This and its docility made the bird easy prey for visiting humans, who killed it with sticks. Reportedly once common, the species may have been hunted to extinction before 1834, when Lord Howe Island was settled.

==Taxonomy==

Lord Howe Island is a small, remote island about east of Australia. Ships first arrived on the island in 1788, including two which supplied the British penal colony on Norfolk Island and three transport ships of the British First Fleet. When passed the island, the ship&#x27;s commander named it after First Lord of the Admiralty Richard Howe. Crews of the visiting ships captured native birds (including white swamphens), and all contemporary descriptions and depictions of the species were made between 1788 and 1790. The bird was first mentioned by the master of HMS &quot;Supply&quot;, David Blackburn, in a 1788 letter to a friend. Other accounts and illustrations were produced by Arthur Bowes Smyth, the fleet&#x27;s naval officer and surgeon, who drew the first known illustration of the species; Arthur Phillip, governor of New South Wales; and George Raper, midshipman of . Secondhand accounts also exist, and at least ten contemporary illustrations are known. The accounts indicate that the population varied, and individual bird plumage was white, blue, or mixed blue-and-white.

In 1790, the white swamphen was scientifically described by the surgeon John White in a book about his time in New South Wales. The binomial name in White&#x27;s book, &quot;Fulica alba&quot;, was provided by the English naturalist George Shaw. The specific name is derived from the Latin word for white (&quot;albus&quot;). White found the bird most similar to the western swamphen (&quot;Porphyrio porphyrio&quot;, then in the genus &quot;Fulica&quot;). Although he apparently never visited Lord Howe Island, White may have questioned sailors and based some of his description on earlier accounts. He said he had described a skin at the Leverian Museum, and his book included an illustration of the specimen by the artist Sarah Stone. It is uncertain when (and how) the specimen arrived at the museum. This skin, the holotype specimen of the species, was purchased by the Natural History Museum of Vienna in 1806 and is catalogued as specimen NMW 50.761. The naturalist John Latham listed the bird as &quot;Gallinula alba&quot; in a later 1790 work, and wrote that it may have been a variety of purple swamphen (or &quot;gallinule&quot;).

One other white swamphen specimen is in Liverpool&#x27;s World Museum, where it is catalogued as specimen NML-VZ D3213. Obtained by the naturalist Sir Joseph Banks, it later entered the collection of the traveller William Bullock and was purchased by Lord Stanley; Stanley&#x27;s son donated it to Liverpool&#x27;s public museums in 1850. Although White said that the first specimen was obtained from Lord Howe Island, the provenance of the second has been unclear; it was originally said to have come from New Zealand, resulting in taxonomic confusion. Phillip wrote that the bird could also be found on Norfolk Island and elsewhere, but Latham said it could be found only on Norfolk Island. When the first specimen was sold by the Leverian Museum, it was listed as coming from New Holland (which Australia was called at the time)—perhaps because it was sent from Sydney. A note by the naturalist Edgar Leopold Layard on a contemporary illustration of the bird by Captain John Hunter inaccurately stated that it only lived on Ball&#x27;s Pyramid, an islet off Lord Howe Island.

The zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck assigned the white swamphen to the swamphen genus &quot;Porphyrio&quot; as &quot;P. albus&quot; in 1820, and the zoologist George Robert Gray considered it an albino variety of the Australasian swamphen (&quot;P. melanotus&quot;) as &quot;P. m. varius alba&quot; in 1844. The belief that the bird was simply an albino was held by several later writers, and many failed to notice that White cited Lord Howe Island as the origin of the Vienna specimen. In 1860 and 1873, the ornithologist August von Pelzeln said that the Vienna specimen had come from Norfolk Island, and assigned the species to the genus &quot;Notornis&quot; as &quot;N. alba&quot;; the takahē (&quot;P. hochstetteri&quot;) of New Zealand was also placed in that genus at the time. In 1873, the naturalist Osbert Salvin agreed that the Lord Howe Island bird was similar to the takahē, although he had apparently never seen the Vienna specimen, basing his conclusion on a drawing provided by von Pelzeln. Salvin included a takahē-like illustration of the Vienna specimen by the artist John Gerrard Keulemans, based on von Pelzeln&#x27;s drawing, in his article.

In 1875, the ornithologist George Dawson Rowley noted differences between the Vienna and Liverpool specimens and named a new species based on the latter: &quot;P. stanleyi&quot;, named after Lord Stanley. He believed that the Liverpool specimen was a juvenile from Lord Howe Island or New Zealand, and continued to believe that the Vienna specimen was from Norfolk Island. Despite naming the new species, Rowley considered the possibility that &quot;P. stanleyi&quot; was an albino Australasian swamphen and considered the Vienna bird more similar to the takahē. In 1901, the ornithologist Henry Ogg Forbes had the Liverpool specimen dismounted so he could examine it for damage. Forbes found it similar enough to the Vienna specimen to belong to the same species, &quot;N. alba&quot;. The zoologist Walter Rothschild considered the two species distinct from each other in 1907, but placed them both in the genus &quot;Notornis&quot;. Rothschild thought that the image published by Phillip in 1789 depicted &quot;N. stanleyi&quot; from Lord Howe Island, and the image published by White in 1790 showed &quot;N. alba&quot; from Norfolk Island. He disagreed that the specimens were albinos, thinking instead that they were evolving into a white species. Rothschild published an illustration of &quot;N. alba&quot; by Keulemans where it is similar to a takahē, inaccurately showing it with dark primary feathers, although the Vienna specimen on which it was based is all white. In 1910, the ornithologist Tom Iredale demonstrated that there was no proof of the white swamphen existing anywhere but on Lord Howe Island and noted that early visitors to Norfolk Island (such as Captain James Cook and Lieutenant Philip Gidley King) did not mention the bird. In 1913, after examining the Vienna specimen, Iredale concluded that the bird belonged in the genus &quot;Porphyrio&quot; and did not resemble the takahē.
In 1928, the ornithologist Gregory Mathews discussed a 1790 painting by Raper which he thought differed enough from &quot;P. albus&quot; in proportions and colouration that he named a new species based on it: &quot;P. raperi&quot;. Mathews also considered &quot;P. albus&quot; distinct enough to warrant a new genus, &quot;Kentrophorina&quot;, due to having a claw (or spur) on one wing. In 1936, he conceded that &quot;P. raperi&quot; was a synonym of &quot;P. albus&quot;. The ornithologist Keith Alfred Hindwood agreed that the bird was an albino &quot;P. melanotus&quot; in 1932, and pointed out that the naturalists Johann Reinhold Forster and Georg Forster (his son) did not record the bird when Cook&#x27;s ship visited Norfolk Island in 1774. In 1940, Hindwood found the white swamphen so closely related to the Australasian swamphen that he considered them subspecies of the same species: &quot;P. albus albus&quot; and &quot;P. albus melanotus&quot; (since &quot;albus&quot; is the older name). Hindwood suggested that the population on Lord Howe Island was white; blue Australasian swamphens occasionally arrived (stragglers from elsewhere have been found on the island) and bred with the white birds, accounting for the blue and partially-blue individuals in the old accounts. He also pointed out that Australasian swamphens are prone to white feathering. In 1941, the biologist Ernst Mayr proposed that the white swamphen was a partially-albinistic population of Australasian swamphens. Mayr suggested that the blue swamphens remaining on Lord Howe Island were not stragglers, but had survived because they were less conspicuous than the white ones. In 1967, the ornithologist James Greenway also considered the white swamphen a subspecies (with &quot;P. stanleyi&quot; a synonym) and considered the white individuals albinos. He suggested that the similarities between the wing feathers of the white swamphen and the takahē were due to parallel evolution in two isolated populations of reluctant fliers.

The ornithologist Sidney Dillon Ripley found the white swamphen to be intermediate between the takahē and the purple swamphen in 1977, based on patterns of the leg-scutes, and reported that X-rays of bones also showed similarities with the takahē. He considered only the Vienna specimen to be a white swamphen, whereas he considered the Liverpool specimen to be an albino Australasian swamphen (listing &quot;P. stanleyi &quot; as a junior synonym of that bird) from New Zealand. In 1991, the ornithologist Ian Hutton reported subfossil bones of the white swamphen. Hutton agreed that the birds described as having white-and-blue feathers were hybrids between the white swamphen and the Australasian swamphen, an idea also considered by the ornithologists Barry Taylor and Ber van Perlo in 2000. In 2000, the writer Errol Fuller said that since swamphens are widespread colonists, it would be expected that populations would evolve similarly to the takahē when they found refuges without mammals (losing flight and becoming bulkier with stouter legs, for example); this was the case with the white swamphen. Fuller suggested that they could be called &quot;white takahēs&quot;, which had been alluded to earlier; the white birds may have been a colour morph of the population, or the blue birds may have been Australasian swamphens which associated with the white birds.

In 2015, the biologists Juan C. Garcia-R. and Steve A. Trewick analysed the DNA of the purple swamphens. They found that the white swamphen was most closely related to the Philippine swamphen (&quot;P. pulverulentus&quot;), and the black-backed swamphen (&quot;P. indicus&quot;) more closely related to both than to other species in its region. Garcia-R. and Trewick used DNA from the Vienna specimen, but were unable to obtain usable DNA from the Liverpool specimen. They suggested that the white swamphen may have descended from a few migrant Philippine swamphens during the late Pleistocene (about 500,000 years ago), dispersing over other islands. This indicates a complex history, since their lineages are not recorded on the islands between them; according to the biologists, such results (based on ancient DNA sources) should be treated with caution. Although many purple swamphen taxa had been considered subspecies of the species &quot;P. porphyrio&quot;, they considered this a paraphyletic (unnatural) grouping since they found different species to group among the subspecies. The cladogram below shows the phylogenetic position of the white swamphen according to the 2015 study:

The ornithologists Hein van Grouw and Julian P. Hume concluded in 2016 that many of the old accounts had errors in the bird&#x27;s provenance, that it was endemic to Lord Howe Island, and suggested when the specimens were collected (between March and May 1788) and under which circumstances they arrived in England. They concluded that the white swamphen was a valid species which changed colouration with age, after reconstructing the colouration of juvenile birds before turning white (which was distinct from other swamphens). Van Grouw and Hume found the white swamphen anatomically more similar to the Australasian swamphen than the Philippine swamphen, and suggested that studies with more-complete data sets than the earlier DNA might yield different results. Due to their anatomical similarities, geographic proximity and the recolonisation of Lord Howe and Norfolk Island by Australasian swamphens, they found it likely that the white swamphen was descended from Australasian swamphens.

In 2021, Hume and colleagues reported the results of their palaeontological reconnaissance of Lord Howe Island, which included the discovery of subfossil white swamphen bones. A complete pelvis and representatives of most limb bones were found in the dunes of Blinky Beach (situated at the end of an airport runway), and the authors stated these would provide new insight into the morphology and behaviour of the species.

==Description==

The length of the white swamphen has been given as 36 cm (14 in) and 55 cm (22 in), making it similar to the Australasian swamphen in size. Its wings were proportionally the shortest of all swamphens. The wing of the Vienna specimen is mm long, the tail is , the culmen with its frontal shield (the fleshy plate on the head) is , the tarsus is , and the middle toe is long. The wing of the Liverpool specimen is long, the tarsus is and the middle toe is . Its tail and beak are damaged, and cannot be reliably measured. The white swamphen differed from most other swamphens (except the Australasian swamphen) in having a short middle toe; it is the same length as the tarsus, or longer, in other species. The white swamphen&#x27;s tail was also the shortest. Both specimens have a claw (or spur) on their wings; it is longer and more discernible in the Vienna specimen, and sharp and buried in the feathers of the Liverpool specimen. This feature is variable among other kinds of swamphen. The softness of the rectrices (tail feathers) and the lengths of the secondary and wing covert feathers relative to the primary feathers appear to have been intermediate between those of the purple swamphen and the takahē.

Although the known skins are mostly white, contemporary illustrations depict some blue individuals; others had a mixture of white and blue feathers. Their legs were red or yellow, but the latter colour may be present only on dried specimens. The bill and frontal shield were red, and the iris was red or brown. According to notes written on an illustration by an unknown artist (in the collection of the artist Thomas Watling, inaccurately dated 1792), the chicks were black and became bluish-grey and then white as they matured. The Vienna specimen is pure white, but the Liverpool specimen has yellowish reflections on its neck and breast, blackish-blue feathers speckled on the head (concentrated near the upper surface of the shield) and neck, blue feathers on the breast, and purplish-blue feathers on the shoulders, back, scapular, and lesser covert feathers. Some of the rectrices (tail feathers) are purplish-brown, and some of the scapular feathers and those on the mid-back are sooty-brown at the base and sooty-blue further up. The central rectrices are sooty-brown and bluish. This colouration indicates that the Liverpool specimen was a younger bird than the Vienna specimen, and the latter had reached the final stage of maturity. Since the Liverpool specimen preserves some of its original colour, van Grouw, and Hume were able to reconstruct its natural colouration before becoming white. It differed from other swamphens in having blackish-blue lores, forehead, crown, nape, and hind neck; purple-blue mantle, back, and wings; a darker rump and upper-tail covert feathers; and dark greyish-blue underparts.
Phillip gave a detailed description in 1789, possibly based on a live bird he received in Sydney:
===Condition of the specimens===
The Vienna specimen is today a study skin with its legs outstretched (not a taxidermy mount), but van Grouw and Hume suggested that Stone&#x27;s 1790 illustration showed its original mounted pose. It is in good condition; although the legs are faded to a pale orange-brown, they were probably reddish in the living bird. It has no yellowish or purple feathers, contradicting Rothschild&#x27;s observation. Forbes suggested that the Liverpool specimen was &quot;remade&quot; and mounted after Stone&#x27;s illustration, though its present pose is dissimilar. Keulemans&#x27;s illustration of the mount shows the present pose, so Forbes was either incorrect or a new pose was based on Keulemans&#x27;s image. The Liverpool specimen is in good condition, although it has lost some feathers from its head and neck. The bill is broken, and its rhamphotheca (the keratinous covering of the bill) is missing; the underlying bone was painted red to simulate an undamaged bill, which has caused some confusion. The legs have also been painted red, and there is no indication of their original colouration. The reason only white specimens are known today may be collecting bias; unusually-coloured specimens are more likely to be collected than normally-coloured ones.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The white swamphen inhabited wooded lowland areas in wetlands. Nothing was recorded about its social and reproductive behaviour and its nest, eggs and call were never described. Presumably it did not migrate. Blackburn&#x27;s 1788 account is the only one that mentions the diet of this bird:

Some contemporary accounts indicated that the bird was flightless. Rowley considered the Liverpool specimen (representing the separate species &quot;P. stanleyi&quot;) capable of flight, due to its longer wings; Rothschild believed that both were flightless, although he was inconsistent about whether their wings were the same length. Van Grouw and Hume found that both specimens showed evidence of an increased terrestrial lifestyle (including decreased wing length, more robust feet and short toes), and were in the process of becoming flightless. Although it may still have been capable of flight, it was behaviourally flightless, similar to other island birds, such as some parrots. Though the white swamphen was similar in size to the Australasian swamphen, it had proportionally shorter wings and therefore a higher wing load – perhaps the highest of all swamphens. Upon the discovery of subfossil pelvic and limb bones in 2021, Hume and colleagues preliminarily stated that these bones were much more robust in the white swamphen than in the volant Australasian swamphen, a trait common in flightless rails.

Van Grouw and Hume pointed out that a white colour aberration in birds is rarely caused by albinism (which is less common than formerly believed), but by leucism or progressive greying – a phenomenon van Grouw described in 2012 and 2013. These conditions produce white feathers due to the absence of cells which produce the pigment melanin. Leucism is inherited, and the white feathering is present in juveniles and does not change with age; progressive greying causes normally-coloured juveniles to lose pigment-producing cells with age, and they become white as they moult. Since contemporary accounts indicate that the white swamphen turned from black to bluish-grey and then white, Van Grouw and Hume concluded that it underwent inheritable progressive greying. Progressive greying is a common cause of white feathers in many types of birds (including rails), although such specimens have sometimes been inaccurately referred to as albinos. The condition does not affect carotenoid pigments (red and yellow), and the bill and legs of the white swamphens retained their colouration. The large number of white individuals on Lord Howe Island may be due to its small founding population, which would have facilitated the spread of inheritable progressive greying.

==Extinction==

Although the white swamphen was considered common during the late 18th century, it appears to have disappeared quickly; the period from the island&#x27;s discovery to the last mention of living birds is only two years (1788–90). It had probably vanished by 1834, when Lord Howe Island was first settled, or during the following decade. Whalers and sealers had used the island for supplies, and may have hunted the bird to extinction. Habitat destruction probably did not play a role, and animal predators (such as rats and cats) arrived later. Several contemporary accounts stress the ease with which the island&#x27;s birds were hunted, and the large number which could be taken to provision ships. In 1789, White described how the white swamphen could be caught:
The fact that they could be killed with sticks may have been due to their poor flying ability, which would have made them vulnerable to human predation. With no natural enemies on the island, they were tame and curious. The physician John Foulis conducted a mid-1840s ornithological survey on the island but did not mention the bird, so it was almost certainly extinct by that time. In 1909, the writer Arthur Francis Basset Hull expressed hope that the bird still survived in unexplored mountains.

Eight types of bird have become extinct due to human interference since Lord Howe Island was discovered, including the Lord Howe pigeon (&quot;Columba vitiensis godmanae&quot;), the Lord Howe parakeet (&quot;Cyanoramphus subflavescens&quot;), the Lord Howe gerygone (&quot;Gerygone insularis&quot;), the Lord Howe fantail (&quot;Rhipidura fuliginosa cervina&quot;), the Lord Howe thrush (&quot;Turdus poliocephalus vinitinctus&quot;), the robust white-eye (&quot;Zosterops strenuus&quot;) and the Lord Howe starling (&quot;Aplonis fusca hulliana&quot;). The extinction of so many native birds is similar to extinctions on several other islands, such as the Mascarenes.

<doc id="532475" wikidata="Q1028476" url="?curid=532475" title="Camellia (cipher)">
<text>In cryptography, Camellia is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits. It was jointly developed by Mitsubishi Electric and NTT of Japan. The cipher has been approved for use by the ISO/IEC, the European Union&#x27;s NESSIE project and the Japanese CRYPTREC project. The cipher has security levels and processing abilities comparable to the Advanced Encryption Standard.

The cipher was designed to be suitable for both software and hardware implementations, from low-cost smart cards to high-speed network systems. It is part of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network such as the Internet.

The cipher was named for the flower &quot;Camellia japonica&quot;, which is known for being long-lived as well as because the cipher was developed in Japan.

== Design ==
Camellia is a Feistel cipher with either 18 rounds (when using 128-bit keys) or 24 rounds (when using 192- or 256-bit keys). Every six rounds, a logical transformation layer is applied: the so-called &quot;FL-function&quot; or its inverse. Camellia uses four 8×8-bit S-boxes with input and output affine transformations and logical operations. The cipher also uses input and output key whitening. The diffusion layer uses a linear transformation based on a matrix with a branch number of 5.

== Security analysis ==
Camellia is considered a modern, safe cipher. Even using the smaller key size option (128 bits), it&#x27;s considered infeasible to break it by brute-force attack on the keys with current technology. There are no known successful attacks that weaken the cipher considerably. The cipher has been approved for use by the ISO/IEC, the European Union&#x27;s NESSIE project and the Japanese CRYPTREC project. The Japanese cipher has security levels and processing abilities comparable to the AES/Rijndael cipher.

Camellia is a block cipher which can be completely defined by minimal systems of multivariate polynomials:
* The Camellia (as well as AES) S-boxes can be described by a system of 23 quadratic equations in 80 terms.
* The key schedule can be described by equations in 768 variables using linear and quadratic terms.
* The entire block cipher can be described by equations in variables using linear and quadratic terms.
* In total, equations in variables using linear and quadratic terms are required.
* The number of free terms is , which is approximately the same number as for AES.
Theoretically, such properties might make it possible to break Camellia (and AES) using an algebraic attack, such as extended sparse linearisation, in the future, provided that the attack becomes feasible.

== Patent status ==
Although Camellia is patented, it is available under a royalty-free license. This has allowed the Camellia cipher to become part of the OpenSSL Project, under an open-source license, since November 2006. It has also allowed it to become part of the Mozilla&#x27;s NSS (Network Security Services) module.

== Adoption ==
Support for Camellia was added to the final release of Mozilla Firefox 3 in 2008 (disabled by default as of Firefox 33 in 2014 in spirit of the &quot;Proposal to Change the Default TLS Ciphersuites Offered by Browsers&quot;, and has been dropped from version 37 in 2015). Pale Moon, a fork of Mozilla/Firefox, continues to offer Camellia and had extended its support to include Galois/Counter mode (GCM) suites with the cipher, but has removed the GCM modes again with release 27.2.0, citing the apparent lack of interest in them.

Later in 2008, the FreeBSD Release Engineering Team announced that the cipher had also been included in the FreeBSD 6.4-RELEASE. Also, support for the Camellia cipher was added to the disk encryption storage class geli of FreeBSD by Yoshisato Yanagisawa.

In September 2009, GNU Privacy Guard added support for Camellia in version 1.4.10.

VeraCrypt (a fork of TrueCrypt) included Camellia as one of its supported encryption algorithms.

Moreover, various popular security libraries, such as Crypto++, GnuTLS, mbed TLS and OpenSSL also include support for Camellia.

Thales and Bloombase support Camellia encryption cipher with their data cryptography offerings.

On March 26, 2013, Camellia was announced as having been selected again for adoption in Japan&#x27;s new e-Government Recommended Ciphers List as the only 128-bit block cipher encryption algorithm developed in Japan. This coincides with the CRYPTREC list being updated for the first time in 10 years. The selection was based on Camellia&#x27;s high reputation for ease of procurement, and security and performance features comparable to those of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Camellia remains unbroken in its full implementation. An impossible differential attack on 12-round Camellia without FL/FL−1 layers does exist.

== Performance ==
The S-boxes used by Camellia share a similar structure to AES&#x27;s S-box. As a result, it is possible to accelerate Camellia software implementations using CPU instruction sets designed for AES, such as x86 AES-NI or x86 GFNI, by affine isomorphism.

== Standardization ==
Camellia has been certified as a standard cipher by several standardization organizations:
* CRYPTREC
* NESSIE
* IETF

<doc id="532476" wikidata="Q202763" url="?curid=532476" title="Early Middle Ages">
<text>The Early Middle Ages (or early medieval period), sometimes controversially referred to as the Dark Ages, is typically regarded by historians as lasting from the late 5th to the 10th century. They marked the start of the Middle Ages of European history, following the decline of the Western Roman Empire, and preceding the High Middle Ages ( 11th to 14th centuries). The alternative term &quot;late antiquity&quot;, for the early part of the period, emphasizes elements of continuity with the Roman Empire, while &quot;Early Middle Ages&quot; is used to emphasize developments characteristic of the earlier medieval period.

The period saw a continuation of trends evident since late classical antiquity, including population decline, especially in urban centres, a decline of trade, a small rise in average temperatures in the North Atlantic region and increased migration. In the 19th century the Early Middle Ages were often labelled the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, a characterization based on the relative scarcity of literary and cultural output from this time. The term is rarely used by academics today. The Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire, survived, though in the 7th century the Rashidun Caliphate and the Umayyad Caliphate conquered the southern part of the Roman territory.

Many of the listed trends reversed later in the period. In 800, the title of &quot;Emperor&quot; was revived in Western Europe with Charlemagne, whose Carolingian Empire greatly affected later European social structure and history. Europe experienced a return to systematic agriculture in the form of the feudal system, which adopted such innovations as three-field planting and the heavy plough. Barbarian migration stabilized in much of Europe, although the Viking expansion greatly affected Northern Europe.
==History==

===Collapse of Rome===
Starting in the 2nd century, various indicators of Roman civilization began to decline, including urbanization, seaborne commerce, and population. Archaeologists have identified only 40 percent as many Mediterranean shipwrecks from the 3rd century as from the first. Estimates of the population of the Roman Empire during the period from 150 to 400 suggest a fall from 65 million to 50 million, a decline of more than 20 percent. Some scholars have connected this de-population to the Dark Ages Cold Period (300–700), when a decrease in global temperatures impaired agricultural yields.

Early in the 3rd century Germanic peoples migrated south from Scandinavia and reached the Black Sea, creating formidable confederations which opposed the local Sarmatians. In Dacia (present-day Romania) and on the steppes north of the Black Sea the Goths, a Germanic people, established at least two kingdoms: Therving and Greuthung.

The arrival of the Huns in 372–375 ended the history of these kingdoms. The Huns, a confederation of central Asian tribes, founded an empire. They had mastered the difficult art of shooting composite recurve bows from horseback. The Goths sought refuge in Roman territory (376), agreeing to enter the Empire as unarmed settlers. However many bribed the Danube border-guards into allowing them to bring their weapons.

The discipline and organization of a Roman legion made it a superb fighting unit. The Romans preferred infantry to cavalry because infantry could be trained to retain the formation in combat, while cavalry tended to scatter when faced with opposition. While a barbarian army could be raised and inspired by the promise of plunder, the legions required a central government and taxation to pay for salaries, constant training, equipment, and food. The decline in agricultural and economic activity reduced the empire&#x27;s taxable income and thus its ability to maintain a professional army to defend itself from external threats.
In the Gothic War (376–382), the Goths revolted and confronted the main Roman army in the Battle of Adrianople (378). By this time, the distinction in the Roman army between Roman regulars and barbarian auxiliaries had broken down, and the Roman army was composed mainly of barbarians and soldiers recruited for a single campaign. The general decline in discipline also led to the use of smaller shields and lighter weaponry. Not wanting to share the glory, Eastern Emperor Valens ordered an attack on the Therving infantry under Fritigern without waiting for Western Emperor Gratian, who was on the way with reinforcements. While the Romans were fully engaged, the Greuthung cavalry arrived. Only one-third of the Roman army managed to escape. This represented the most shattering defeat that the Romans had suffered since the Battle of Cannae (216 BC), according to the Roman military writer Ammianus Marcellinus. The core army of the Eastern Roman Empire was destroyed, Valens was killed, and the Goths were freed to lay waste to the Balkans, including the armories along the Danube. As Edward Gibbon comments, &quot;The Romans, who so coolly and so concisely mention the acts of &quot;justice&quot; which were exercised by the legions, reserve their compassion and their eloquence for their own sufferings, when the provinces were invaded and desolated by the arms of the successful Barbarians.&quot;

The empire lacked the resources, and perhaps the will, to reconstruct the professional mobile army destroyed at Adrianople, so it had to rely on barbarian armies to fight for it. The Eastern Roman Empire succeeded in buying off the Goths with tribute. The Western Roman Empire proved less fortunate. Stilicho, the western empire&#x27;s half-Vandal military commander, stripped the Rhine frontier of troops to fend off invasions of Italy by the Visigoths in 402–03 and by other Goths in 406–07.

Fleeing before the advance of the Huns, the Vandals, Suebi, and Alans launched an attack across the frozen Rhine near Mainz; on 31 December 406, the frontier gave way and these tribes surged into Roman Gaul. There soon followed the Burgundians and bands of the Alamanni. In the fit of anti-barbarian hysteria which followed, the Western Roman Emperor Honorius had Stilicho summarily beheaded (408). Stilicho submitted his neck, &quot;with a firmness not unworthy of the last of the Roman generals&quot;, wrote Gibbon. Honorius was left with only worthless courtiers to advise him. In 410, the Visigoths led by Alaric I captured the city of Rome and for three days fire and slaughter ensued as bodies filled the streets, palaces were stripped of their valuables, and the invaders interrogated and tortured those citizens thought to have hidden wealth. As newly converted Christians, the Goths respected church property, but those who found sanctuary in the Vatican and in other churches were the fortunate few.

===Migration Period===

The Goths and Vandals were only the first of many bands of peoples that flooded Western Europe in the absence of administrative governance. Some lived only for war and pillage and disdained Roman ways. Other peoples had been in prolonged contact with the Roman civilization, and were, to a certain degree, romanized. &quot;A poor Roman plays the Goth, a rich Goth the Roman,&quot; said King Theoderic of the Ostrogoths. The subjects of the Roman empire were a mixture of Roman Christian, Arian Christian, Nestorian Christian, and pagan. The Germanic peoples knew little of cities, money, or writing, and were mostly pagan, though they were increasingly converting to Arianism, a non-trinitarian form of Christianity that considers God the Son to have been created by, and thus inferior to, God the Father, rather than the two being co-eternal, which is the position of Chalcedonian Christianity. Arianism found some favour in the Roman Empire before being eclipsed by the Chalcedonian position and then suppressed as heretical.

During the migrations, or &quot;Völkerwanderung&quot; (wandering of the peoples), the earlier settled populations were sometimes left intact though usually partially or entirely displaced. Roman culture north of the Po River was almost entirely displaced by the migrations. Whereas the peoples of France, Italy, Spain and Portugal continued to speak the dialects of Vulgar Latin that today constitute the Romance languages, the language of the smaller Roman-era population of what is now England disappeared with barely a trace in the territories settled by the Anglo-Saxons, although the Brittanic kingdoms of the west remained Brythonic speakers. The new peoples greatly altered established society, including law, culture, religion, and patterns of property ownership.

The &quot;pax Romana&quot; had provided safe conditions for trade and manufacture, and a unified cultural and educational milieu of far-ranging connections. As this was lost, it was replaced by the rule of local potentates, sometimes members of the established Romanized ruling elite, sometimes new lords of alien culture. In Aquitania, Gallia Narbonensis, southern Italy and Sicily, Baetica or southern Spain, and the Iberian Mediterranean coast, Roman culture lasted until the 6th or 7th centuries.

The gradual breakdown and transformation of economic and social linkages and infrastructure resulted in increasingly localized outlooks. This breakdown was often fast and dramatic as it became unsafe to travel or carry goods over any distance; there was a consequent collapse in trade and manufacture for export. Major industries that depended on trade, such as large-scale pottery manufacture, vanished almost overnight in places like Britain. Tintagel in Cornwall, as well as several other centres, managed to obtain supplies of Mediterranean luxury goods well into the 6th century, but then lost their trading links. Administrative, educational and military infrastructure quickly vanished, and the loss of the established &quot;cursus honorum&quot; led to the collapse of the schools and to a rise of illiteracy even among the leadership. The careers of Cassiodorus (died ) at the beginning of this period and of Alcuin of York (died 804) at its close were founded alike on their valued literacy. For the formerly Roman area, there was another 20 per cent decline in population between 400 and 600, or a one-third decline for 150–600. In the 8th century, the volume of trade reached its lowest level. The very small number of shipwrecks found that dated from the 8th century supports this (which represents less than 2 per cent of the number of shipwrecks dated from the 1st century). There was also reforestation and a retreat of agriculture centred around 500.

The Romans had practiced two-field agriculture, with a crop grown in one field and the other left fallow and ploughed under to eliminate weeds. Systematic agriculture largely disappeared and yields declined. It is estimated that the Plague of Justinian which began in 541 and recurred periodically for 150 years thereafter killed as many as 100 million people across the world. Some historians such as Josiah C. Russell (1958) have suggested a total European population loss of 50 to 60 per cent between 541 and 700. After the year 750, major epidemic diseases did not appear again in Europe until the Black Death of the 14th century. The disease smallpox, which was eradicated in the late 20th century, did not definitively enter Western Europe until about 581 when Bishop Gregory of Tours provided an eyewitness account that describes the characteristic findings of smallpox. Waves of epidemics wiped out large rural populations. Most of the details about the epidemics are lost, probably due to the scarcity of surviving written records.

For almost a thousand years, Rome was the most politically important, richest and largest city in Europe. Around 100 AD, it had a population of about 450,000, and declined to a mere 20,000 during the Early Middle Ages, reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins and vegetation.

===Eastern Roman Empire===

The death of Theodosius I in 395 was followed by the division of the empire between his two sons. The Western Roman Empire disintegrated into a mosaic of warring Germanic kingdoms in the 5th century, effectively making the Eastern Roman Empire in Constantinople the Greek-speaking successor to the classical Roman Empire. The inhabitants continued to regard themselves as Romans, or &quot;Romaioi&quot;, until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. Despite this, to distinguish it from its predominantly Latin-speaking predecessor, historians began referring to the empire as &quot;Byzantine&quot;, after the original name of Constantinople, Byzantium.

The Eastern Roman or &quot;Byzantine&quot; Empire aimed to retain control of the trade routes between Europe and the Orient, which made the Empire the richest polity in medieval Europe. Making use of their sophisticated warfare and superior diplomacy, the Byzantines managed to fend off assaults by the migrating barbarians. Their dreams of subduing the Western potentates briefly materialized during the reign of Justinian I in 527–565. Not only did Justinian restore some western territories to the Roman Empire, including Rome and the Italian peninsula itself, but he also codified Roman law (with his codification remaining in force in many areas of Europe until the 19th century) and commissioned the building of the largest and most architecturally advanced edifice of the Early Middle Ages, the Hagia Sophia. However, his reign also saw the outbreak of a bubonic plague pandemic, now known retroactively as the Plague of Justinian. The Emperor himself was afflicted, and within the span of less than a year, an estimated 200,000 Constantinopolites—two out of every five city residents—had died of the disease.

Justinian&#x27;s successors Maurice and Heraclius confronted invasions by the Avar and Slavic tribes. After the devastations by the Slavs and the Avars, large areas of the Balkans became depopulated. In 626 Constantinople, by far the largest city of early medieval Europe, withstood a combined siege by Avars and Persians. Within several decades, Heraclius completed a holy war against the Persians, taking their capital and having a Sassanid monarch assassinated. Yet Heraclius lived to see his spectacular success undone by the Muslim conquests of Syria, three Palaestina provinces, Egypt, and North Africa which was considerably facilitated by religious disunity and the proliferation of heretical movements (notably Monophysitism and Nestorianism) in the areas converted to Islam.

Although Heraclius&#x27;s successors managed to salvage Constantinople from two Arab sieges (in 674–77 and 717), the empire of the 8th and early 9th century was rocked by the great Iconoclastic Controversy, punctuated by dynastic struggles between various factions at court. The Bulgar and Slavic tribes profited from these disorders and invaded Illyria, Thrace and even Greece. After the decisive victory at Ongala in 680 the armies of the Bulgars and Slavs advanced to the south of the Balkan mountains, defeating again the Byzantines who were then forced to sign a humiliating peace treaty which acknowledged the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire on the borders of the Empire.

To counter these threats a new system of administration was introduced. The regional civil and military administration were combined in the hands of a general, or strategos. A theme, which formerly denoted a subdivision of the Byzantine army, came to refer to a region governed by a strategos. The reform led to the emergence of great landed families which controlled the regional military and often pressed their claims to the throne (see Bardas Phocas and Bardas Sklerus for characteristic examples).

By the early 8th century, notwithstanding the shrinking territory of the empire, Constantinople remained the largest and the wealthiest city west of China, comparable only to Sassanid Ctesiphon, and later Abbasid Baghdad. The population of the imperial capital fluctuated between 300,000 and 400,000 as the emperors undertook measures to restrain its growth. The only other large Christian cities were Rome (50,000) and Thessalonica (30,000). Even before the 8th century was out, the Farmer&#x27;s Law signalled the resurrection of agricultural technologies in the Roman Empire. As the 2006 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; noted, &quot;the technological base of Byzantine society was more advanced than that of contemporary western Europe: iron tools could be found in the villages; water mills dotted the landscape; and field-sown beans provided a diet rich in protein&quot;.

The ascension of the Macedonian dynasty in 867 marked the end of the period of political and religious turmoil and introduced a new golden age of the empire. While the talented generals such as Nicephorus Phocas expanded the frontiers, the Macedonian emperors (such as Leo the Wise and Constantine VII) presided over the cultural flowering in Constantinople, known as the Macedonian Renaissance. The enlightened Macedonian rulers scorned the rulers of Western Europe as illiterate barbarians and maintained a nominal claim to rule over the West. Although this fiction had been exploded with the coronation of Charlemagne in Rome (800), the Byzantine rulers did not treat their Western counterparts as equals. Generally, they had little interest in political and economic developments in the barbarian (from their point of view) West.

Against this economic background the culture and the imperial traditions of the Eastern Roman Empire attracted its northern neighbours—Slavs, Bulgars, and Khazars—to Constantinople, in search of either pillage or enlightenment. The movement of the Germanic tribes to the south triggered the great migration of the Slavs, who occupied the vacated territories. In the 7th century, they moved westward to the Elbe, southward to the Danube and eastward to the Dnieper. By the 9th century, the Slavs had expanded into sparsely inhabited territories to the south and east from these natural frontiers, peacefully assimilating the indigenous Illyrian and Finnic populations.

===Rise of Islam===
;632–750

From the 7th century, Byzantine history was greatly affected by the rise of Islam and the Caliphates. Muslim Arabs first invaded historically Roman territory under Abū Bakr, first Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, who entered Roman Syria and Roman Mesopotamia. The Byzantines and neighbouring Persian Sasanids had been severely weakened by a long succession of Byzantine–Sasanian wars, especially the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628. Under Umar, the second Caliph, the Muslims decisively conquered Syria and Mesopotamia, as well as Roman Palestine, Roman Egypt, parts of Asia Minor and Roman North Africa, while they entirely toppled the Sasanids. In the mid 7th century, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into the Caucasus region, of which parts would later permanently become part of Russia. This expansion of Islam continued under Umar&#x27;s successors and then the Umayyad Caliphate, which conquered the rest of Mediterranean North Africa and most of the Iberian Peninsula. Over the next centuries Muslim forces were able to take further European territory, including Cyprus, Malta, Septimania, Crete, and Sicily and parts of southern Italy.

The Muslim conquest of Hispania began when the Moors (mostly Berbers and some Arabs) invaded the Christian Visigothic Kingdom in the year 711, under their Berber leader Tariq ibn Ziyad. They landed at Gibraltar on 30 April and worked their way northward. Tariq&#x27;s forces were joined the next year by those of his superior, Musa ibn Nusair. During the eight-year campaign most of the Iberian Peninsula was brought under Muslim rule—except for small areas in the north-northwest (Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. This territory, under the Arab name Al-Andalus, became part of the expanding Umayyad empire.

The unsuccessful second siege of Constantinople (717) weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. After their success in overrunning Iberia, the conquerors moved northeast across the Pyrenees. They were defeated by the Frankish leader Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732. The Umayyads were overthrown in 750 by the Abbāsids and most of the Umayyad clan were massacred.

A surviving Umayyad prince, Abd-ar-rahman I, escaped to Spain and founded a new Umayyad dynasty in the Emirate of Cordoba in 756. Charles Martel&#x27;s son Pippin the Short retook Narbonne, and his grandson Charlemagne established the Marca Hispanica across the Pyrenees in part of what today is Catalonia, reconquering Girona in 785 and Barcelona in 801. The Umayyads in Hispania proclaimed themselves caliphs in 929.

===Birth of the Latin West===
====700–850====
Climatic conditions in Western Europe began to improve after 700. In that year, the two major powers in western Europe were the Franks in Gaul and the Lombards in Italy. The Lombards had been thoroughly Romanized, and their kingdom was stable and well developed. The Franks, in contrast, were barely any different from their barbarian Germanic ancestors. The Kingdom of the Franks was weak and divided. Impossible to guess at the time, but by the end of the century, the Lombardic kingdom would be extinct, while the Frankish kingdom would have nearly reassembled the Western Roman Empire.

Though much of Roman civilization north of the Po River had been wiped out in the years after the end of the Western Roman Empire, between the 5th and 8th centuries, new political and social infrastructure began to develop. Much of this was initially Germanic and pagan. Arian Christian missionaries had been spreading Arian Christianity throughout northern Europe, though by 700 the religion of northern Europeans was largely a mix of Germanic paganism, Christianized paganism, and Arian Christianity. Chalcedonian Christianity had barely started to spread in northern Europe by this time. Through the practice of simony, local princes typically auctioned off ecclesiastical offices, causing priests and bishops to function as though they were yet another noble under the patronage of the prince. In contrast, a network of monasteries had sprung up as monks sought separation from the world. These monasteries remained independent from local princes, and as such constituted the &quot;church&quot; for most northern Europeans during this time. Being independent from local princes, they increasingly stood out as centres of learning, of scholarship, and as religious centres where individuals could receive spiritual or monetary assistance.

The interaction between the culture of the newcomers, their warband loyalties, the remnants of classical culture, and Christian influences, produced a new model for society, based in part on feudal obligations. The centralized administrative systems of the Romans did not withstand the changes, and the institutional support for chattel slavery largely disappeared. The Anglo-Saxons in England had also started to convert from Anglo-Saxon polytheism after the arrival of Christian missionaries in 597.

====Italy====

The Lombards, who first entered Italy in 568 under Alboin, carved out a state in the north, with its capital at Pavia. At first, they were unable to conquer the Exarchate of Ravenna, the &quot;Ducatus Romanus&quot;, and Calabria and Apulia. The next two hundred years were occupied in trying to conquer these territories from the Byzantine Empire.

The Lombard state was relatively Romanized, at least when compared to the Germanic kingdoms in northern Europe. It was highly decentralized at first, with the territorial dukes having practical sovereignty in their duchies, especially in the southern duchies of Spoleto and Benevento. For a decade following the death of Cleph in 575, the Lombards did not even elect a king; this period is called the Rule of the Dukes. The first written legal code was composed in poor Latin in 643: the &quot;Edictum Rothari&quot;. It was primarily the codification of the oral legal tradition of the people.

The Lombard state was well-organized and stabilized by the end of the long reign of Liutprand (717–744), but its collapse was sudden. Unsupported by the dukes, King Desiderius was defeated and forced to surrender his kingdom to Charlemagne in 774. The Lombard kingdom ended and a period of Frankish rule was initiated. The Frankish king Pepin the Short had, by the Donation of Pepin, given the pope the &quot;Papal States&quot; and the territory north of that swath of papally-governed land was ruled primarily by Lombard and Frankish vassals of the Holy Roman Emperor until the rise of the city-states in the 11th and 12th centuries.

In the south, a period of chaos began. The Duchy of Benevento maintained its sovereignty in the face of the pretensions of both the Western and Eastern Empires. In the 9th century, the Muslims conquered Sicily. The cities on the Tyrrhenian Sea departed from Byzantine allegiance. Various states owing various nominal allegiances fought constantly over territory until events came to a head in the early 11th century with the coming of the Normans, who conquered the whole of the south by the end of the century.

====Britain====
Roman Britain was in a state of political and economic collapse at the time of the Roman departure c. 400. A series of settlements (traditionally referred to as an invasion) by Germanic peoples began in the early fifth century, and by the sixth century the island would consist of many small kingdoms engaged in ongoing warfare with each other. The Germanic kingdoms are now collectively referred to as Anglo-Saxons. Christianity began to take hold among the Anglo-Saxons in the sixth century, with 597 given as the traditional date for its large-scale adoption.

Western Britain (Wales), eastern and northern Scotland (Pictland) and the Scottish highlands and isles continued their separate evolution. The Irish descended and Irish-influenced people of western Scotland were Christian from the fifth century onward, the Picts adopted Christianity in the sixth century under the influence of Columba, and the Welsh had been Christian since the Roman era.

The Kingdom of Northumbria was the pre-eminent power c. 600–700, absorbing several weaker Anglo-Saxon and Brythonic kingdoms, while Mercia held a similar status c. 700–800. Wessex would absorb all of the kingdoms in the south, both Anglo-Saxon and Briton. In Wales consolidation of power would not begin until the ninth century under the descendants of Merfyn Frych of Gwynedd, establishing a hierarchy that would last until the Norman invasion of Wales in 1081.

The first Viking raids on Britain began before 800, increasing in scope and destructiveness over time. In 865 a large, well-organized Danish Viking army (called the Great Heathen Army) attempted a conquest, breaking or diminishing Anglo-Saxon power everywhere but in Wessex. Under the leadership of Alfred the Great and his descendants, Wessex would at first survive, then coexist with, and eventually conquer the Danes. It would then establish the Kingdom of England and rule until the establishment of an Anglo-Danish kingdom under Cnut, and then again until the Norman Invasion of 1066.

Viking raids and invasion were no less dramatic for the north. Their defeat of the Picts in 839 led to a lasting Norse heritage in northernmost Scotland, and it led to the combination of the Picts and Gaels under the House of Alpin, which became the Kingdom of Alba, the predecessor of the Kingdom of Scotland. The Vikings combined with the Gaels of the Hebrides to become the Gall-Gaidel and establish the Kingdom of the Isles.

====Frankish Empire====

The Merovingians established themselves in the power vacuum of the former Roman provinces in Gaul, and Clovis I converted to Christianity following his victory over the Alemanni at the Battle of Tolbiac (496), laying the foundation of the Frankish Empire, the dominant state of early medieval Western Christendom. The Frankish kingdom grew through a complex development of conquest, patronage, and alliance building. Due to salic custom, inheritance rights were absolute, and all land was divided equally among the sons of a dead land holder. This meant that, when the king granted a prince land in reward for service, that prince and all of his descendants had an irrevocable right to that land that no future king could undo. Likewise, those princes (and their sons) could sublet their land to their own vassals, who could in turn sublet the land to lower sub-vassals. This all had the effect of weakening the power of the king as his kingdom grew, since the result was that the land became controlled not just by more princes and vassals, but by multiple layers of vassals. This also allowed his nobles to attempt to build their own power base, though given the strict salic tradition of hereditary kingship, few would ever consider overthrowing the king.

This increasingly fragmented arrangement was highlighted by Charles Martel, who as Mayor of the Palace was effectively the strongest prince in the kingdom. His accomplishments were highlighted, not just by his famous defeat of invading Muslims at the Battle of Tours, which is typically considered the battle that saved Europe from Muslim conquest, but by the fact that he greatly expanded Frankish influence. It was under his patronage that Boniface expanded Frankish influence into Germany by rebuilding the German church, with the result that, within a century, the German church was the strongest church in western Europe. Yet despite this, Charles Martel refused to overthrow the Frankish king. His son, Pepin the Short, inherited his power, and used it to further expand Frankish influence. Unlike his father, however, Pepin decided to seize the Frankish kingship. Given how strongly Frankish culture held to its principle of inheritance, few would support him if he attempted to overthrow the king. Instead, he sought the assistance of Pope Zachary, who was himself newly vulnerable due to fallout with the Byzantine Emperor over the Iconoclastic Controversy. Pepin agreed to support the pope and to give him land (the Donation of Pepin, which created the Papal States) in exchange for being consecrated as the new Frankish king. Given that Pepin&#x27;s claim to the kingship was now based on an authority higher than Frankish custom, no resistance was offered to Pepin. With this, the Merovingian line of kings ended, and the Carolingian line began.

Pepin&#x27;s son Charlemagne continued in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. He further expanded and consolidated the Frankish kingdom (now commonly called the Carolingian Empire). His reign also saw a cultural rebirth, commonly called the Carolingian Renaissance. Though the exact reasons are unclear, Charlemagne was crowned &quot;Roman Emperor&quot; by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day, 800. Upon Charlemagne&#x27;s death, his empire had united much of modern-day France, western Germany and northern Italy. The years after his death illustrated how Germanic his empire remained. Rather than an orderly succession, his empire was divided in accordance with Frankish inheritance custom, which resulted in instability that plagued his empire until the last king of a united empire, Charles the Fat, died in 887, which resulted in a permanent split of the empire into West Francia and East Francia. West Francia would be ruled by Carolingians until 987 and East Francia until 911, after which time the partition of the empire into France and Germany was complete.

====Feudalism====
Around 800 there was a return to systematic agriculture in the form of the open field, or strip, system. A manor would have several fields, each subdivided into strips of land. An acre measured one &quot;furlong&quot; of 220 yards by one &quot;chain&quot; of 22 yards (that is, about 200 m by 20 m). A furlong (from &quot;furrow long&quot;) was considered to be the distance an ox could plough before taking a rest; the strip shape of the acre field also reflected the difficulty in turning early heavy ploughs. In the idealized form of the system, each family got thirty such strips of land. The three-field system of crop rotation was first developed in the 9th century: wheat or rye was planted in one field, the second field had a nitrogen-fixing crop, and the third was fallow.

Compared to the earlier two-field system, a three-field system allowed for significantly more land to be put under cultivation. Even more important, the system allowed for two harvests a year, reducing the risk that a single crop failure will lead to famine. Three-field agriculture created a surplus of oats that could be used to feed horses. This surplus allowed for the replacement of the ox by the horse after the introduction of the padded horse collar in the 12th century. Because the system required a major rearrangement of real estate and of the social order, it took until the 11th century before it came into general use. The heavy wheeled plough was introduced in the late 10th century. It required greater animal power and promoted the use of teams of oxen. Illuminated manuscripts depict two-wheeled ploughs with both a mouldboard, or curved metal ploughshare, and a coulter, a vertical blade in front of the ploughshare. The Romans had used light, wheel-less ploughs with flat iron shares that often proved unequal to the heavy soils of northern Europe.

The return to systemic agriculture coincided with the introduction of a new social system called feudalism. This system featured a hierarchy of reciprocal obligations. Each man was bound to serve his superior in return for the latter&#x27;s protection. This made for confusion of territorial sovereignty since allegiances were subject to change over time and were sometimes mutually contradictory. Feudalism allowed the state to provide a degree of public safety despite the continued absence of bureaucracy and written records.

Manors became largely self-sufficient, and the volume of trade along long-distance routes and in market towns declined during this period, though never ceased entirely. Roman roads decayed and long-distance trade depended more heavily on water transport.

===Viking Age===


The Viking Age spans the period roughly between the late 8th and mid-11th centuries in Scandinavia and Britain, following the Germanic Iron Age (and the Vendel Age in Sweden). During this period, the Vikings, Scandinavian warriors and traders raided and explored most parts of Europe, south-western Asia, northern Africa, and north-eastern North America.

With the means to travel (longships and open water), desire for goods led Scandinavian traders to explore and develop extensive trading partnerships in new territories. Some of the most important trading ports during the period include both existing and ancient cities such as Aarhus, Ribe, Hedeby, Vineta, Truso, Kaupang, Birka, Bordeaux, York, Dublin, and Aldeigjuborg.

Viking raiding expeditions were separate from, though coexisted with, regular trading expeditions. Apart from exploring Europe via its oceans and rivers, with the aid of their advanced navigational skills, they extended their trading routes across vast parts of the continent. They also engaged in warfare, looting and enslaving numerous Christian communities of medieval Europe for centuries, contributing to the development of feudal systems in Europe.

===Eastern Europe===
; 600–1000


The Early Middle Ages marked the beginning of the cultural distinctions between Western and Eastern Europe north of the Mediterranean. Influence from the Byzantine Empire impacted the Christianization and hence almost every aspect of the cultural and political development of the East from the preeminence of Caesaropapism and Eastern Christianity to the spread of the Cyrillic alphabet. The turmoil of the so-called Barbarian invasions in the beginning of the period gradually gave way to more stabilized societies and states as the origins of contemporary Eastern Europe began to take shape during the High Middle Ages.

Turkic and Iranian invaders from Central Asia pressured the agricultural populations both in the Byzantine Balkans and in Central Europe creating a number of successor states in the Pontic steppes. After the dissolution of the Hunnic Empire, the Western Turkic and Avar Khaganates dominated territories from Pannonia to the Caspian Sea before being replaced by the short lived Old Great Bulgaria and the more successful Khazar Khaganate north of the Black Sea and the Magyars in Central Europe.

The Khazars were a nomadic Turkic people who managed to develop a multiethnic commercial state which owed its success to the control of much of the waterway trade between Europe and Central Asia. The Khazars also exacted tribute from the Alani, Magyars, various Slavic tribes, the Crimean Goths, and the Greeks of Crimea. Through a network of Jewish itinerant merchants, or Radhanites, they were in contact with the trade emporia of India and Spain.

Once they found themselves confronted by Arab expansionism, the Khazars pragmatically allied themselves with Constantinople and clashed with the Caliphate. Despite initial setbacks, they managed to recover Derbent and eventually penetrated as far south as Caucasian Iberia, Caucasian Albania and Armenia. In doing so, they effectively blocked the northward expansion of Islam into Eastern Europe even before khan Tervel achieved the same at the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople and several decades before the Battle of Tours in Western Europe. Islam eventually penetrated into Eastern Europe in the 920s when Volga Bulgaria exploited the decline of Khazar power in the region to adopt Islam from the Baghdad missionaries. The state religion of Khazaria, Judaism, disappeared as a political force with the fall of Khazaria, while Islam of Volga Bulgaria has survived in the region up to the present.

In the beginning of the period, the Slavic tribes started to expand aggressively into Byzantine possessions on the Balkans. The first attested Slavic polities were Serbia and Great Moravia, the latter of which emerged under the aegis of the Frankish Empire in the early 9th century. Great Moravia was ultimately overrun by the Magyars, who invaded the Pannonian Basin around 896. The Slavic state became a stage for confrontation between the Christian missionaries from Constantinople and Rome. Although West Slavs, Croats and Slovenes eventually acknowledged Roman ecclesiastical authority, the clergy of Constantinople succeeded in converting to Eastern Christianity two of the largest states of early medieval Europe, Bulgaria around 864, and Kievan Rus&#x27; c. 990.

====Bulgaria====
In 632 the Bulgars established the khanate of Old Great Bulgaria under the leadership of Kubrat. The Khazars managed to oust the Bulgars from Southern Ukraine into lands along middle Volga (Volga Bulgaria) and along lower Danube (Danube Bulgaria).

In 681 the Bulgars founded a powerful and ethnically diverse state that played a defining role in the history of early medieval Southeastern Europe. Bulgaria withstood the pressure from Pontic steppe tribes like the Pechenegs, Khazars, and Cumans, and in 806 destroyed the Avar Khanate. The Danube Bulgars were quickly slavicized and, despite constant campaigning against Constantinople, accepted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. Through the efforts of missionaries Cyril and Methodius, mainly their disciples like Clement of Ohrid and Naum, the spread, initially of the Glagolitic, and later of the Cyrillic alphabet, developed in the capital Preslav. The local vernacular dialect, now known as Old Bulgarian or Old Church Slavonic, was established as the language of books and liturgy among Orthodox Christian Slavs.

After the adoption of Christianity in 864, Bulgaria became a cultural and spiritual hub of the Eastern Orthodox Slavic world. The Cyrillic script was developed around 885–886, and was afterwards also introduced with books to Serbia and Kievan Rus&#x27;. Literature, art, and architecture were thriving with the establishment of the Preslav and Ohrid Literary Schools along with the distinct Preslav Ceramics School. In 927 the Bulgarian Orthodox Church was the first European national Church to gain independence with its own Patriarch while conducting services in the vernacular Old Church Slavonic.

Under Simeon I (893–927), the state was the largest and one of the most powerful political entities of Europe, and it consistently threatened the existence of the Byzantine empire. From the middle of the 10th century Bulgaria was in decline as it entered a social and spiritual turmoil. It was in part due to Simeon&#x27;s devastating wars, but was also exacerbated
by a series of successful Byzantine military campaigns. Bulgaria was conquered after a long resistance in 1018.

==== Kievan Rus&#x27; ====

Led by a Varangian dynasty, the Kievan Rus&#x27; controlled the routes connecting Northern Europe to Byzantium and to the Orient (for example: the Volga trade route). The Kievan state began with the rule (882–912) of Prince Oleg, who extended his control from Novgorod southwards along the Dnieper river valley in order to protect trade from Khazar incursions from the east and moved his capital to the more strategic Kiev. Sviatoslav I (died 972) achieved the first major expansion of Kievan Rus&#x27; territorial control, fighting a war of conquest against the Khazar Empire and inflicting a serious blow on Bulgaria. A Rus&#x27; attack (967 or 968), instigated by the Byzantines, led to the collapse of the Bulgarian state and the occupation of the east of the country by the Rus&#x27;. An ensuing direct military confrontation between the Rus&#x27; and Byzantium (970–971) ended with a Byzantine victory (971). The Rus&#x27; withdrew and the Byzantine Empire incorporated eastern Bulgaria. Both before and after their conversion to Christianity (conventionally dated 988 under Vladimir I of Kiev—known as Vladimir the Great), the Rus&#x27; also embarked on predatory military campaigns against the Byzantine Empire, some of which resulted in trade treaties. The importance of Russo-Byzantine relations to Constantinople was highlighted by the fact that Vladimir I of Kiev, son of Svyatoslav I, became the only foreigner to marry (989) a Byzantine princess of the Macedonian dynasty (which ruled the Eastern Roman Empire from 867 to 1056), a singular honour sought in vain by many other rulers.

==Transmission of learning==
With the Fall of the Western Roman Empire and with urban centres in decline, literacy and learning decreased in the West. De-urbanization reduced the scope of education, and by the 6th century teaching and learning moved to monastic and cathedral schools, with the study of biblical texts at the centre of education. The education of the laity continued with little interruption in Italy, Spain, and the southern part of Gaul, where Roman influences lasted longer. In the 7th century, however, learning expanded in Ireland and the Celtic lands, where Latin was a foreign language and Latin texts were eagerly studied and taught. The Carolingian Renaissance of classical education appeared in the Carolingian Empire in the 8th century.

In the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium), learning (in the sense of formal education involving literature) was maintained at a higher level than in the West. The classical education system, which would persist for hundreds of years, emphasized grammar, Latin, Greek, and rhetoric. Pupils read and reread classic works and wrote essays imitating their style. By the 4th century, this education system was Christianized. In &quot;De Doctrina Christiana&quot; (started 396, completed 426), Augustine explained how classical education fits into the Christian worldview: Christianity is a religion of the book, so Christians must be literate. Tertullian was more skeptical of the value of classical learning, asking &quot;What indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem?&quot;

===Science===
In the ancient world, Greek was the primary language of science. Advanced scientific research and teaching was mainly carried on in the Hellenistic side of the Roman empire, and in Greek. Late Roman attempts to translate Greek writings into Latin had limited success. As the knowledge of Greek declined, the Latin West found itself cut off from some of its Greek philosophical and scientific roots. For a time, Latin-speakers who wanted to learn about science had access to only a couple of books by Boethius (c. 470–524) that summarized Greek handbooks by Nicomachus of Gerasa. Isidore of Seville produced a Latin encyclopedia in 630. Private libraries would have existed, and monasteries would also keep various kinds of texts.

The study of nature was pursued more for practical reasons than as an abstract inquiry: the need to care for the sick led to the study of medicine and of ancient texts on drugs; the need for monks to determine the proper time to pray led them to study the motion of the stars; and the need to compute the date of Easter led them to study and teach mathematics and the motions of the Sun and Moon.

===Carolingian Renaissance===

In the late 8th century, there was renewed interest in Classical Antiquity as part of the Carolingian Renaissance. Charlemagne carried out a reform in education. The English monk Alcuin of York elaborated a project of scholarly development aimed at resuscitating classical knowledge by establishing programs of study based upon the seven liberal arts: the &quot;trivium&quot;, or literary education (grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic), and the &quot;quadrivium&quot;, or scientific education (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). From 787 on, decrees began to circulate recommending the restoration of old schools and the founding of new ones across the empire.

Institutionally, these new schools were either under the responsibility of a monastery (monastic schools), a cathedral, or a noble court. The teaching of dialectic (a discipline that corresponds to today&#x27;s logic) was responsible for the increase in the interest in speculative inquiry; from this interest would follow the rise of the Scholastic tradition of Christian philosophy. In the 12th and 13th centuries, many of those schools founded under the auspices of Charlemagne, especially cathedral schools, would become universities.

===Byzantium&#x27;s golden age===

Byzantium&#x27;s great intellectual achievement was the Corpus Juris Civilis (&quot;Body of Civil Law&quot;), a massive compilation of Roman law made under Justinian (r. 528–565). The work includes a section called the &quot;Digesta&quot; which abstracts the principles of Roman law in such a way that they can be applied to any situation. The level of literacy was considerably higher in the Byzantine Empire than in the Latin West. Elementary education was much more widely available, sometimes even in the countryside. Secondary schools still taught the &quot;Iliad&quot; and other classics.

As for higher education, the Neoplatonic Academy in Athens was closed in 526. There was also a school in Alexandria which remained open until the Arab conquest (640). The University of Constantinople, founded by Emperor Theodosius II (425), seems to have dissolved around this time. It was refounded by Emperor Michael III in 849. Higher education in this period focused on rhetoric, although Aristotle&#x27;s logic was covered in simple outline. Under the Macedonian dynasty (867–1056), Byzantium enjoyed a golden age and a revival of classical learning. There was little original research, but many lexicons, anthologies, encyclopedias, and commentaries.

===Islamic learning===
In the course of the 11th century, Islam&#x27;s scientific knowledge began to reach Western Europe, via Islamic Spain. The works of Euclid and Archimedes, lost in the West, were translated from Arabic to Latin in Spain. The modern Hindu–Arabic numeral system, including a notation for zero, were developed by Hindu mathematicians in the 5th and 6th centuries. Muslim mathematicians learned of it in the 7th century and added a notation for decimal fractions in the 9th and 10th centuries. Around 1000, Gerbert of Aurillac (later Pope Sylvester II) made an abacus with counters engraved with Arabic numerals. A treatise by Al-Khwārizmī on how to perform calculations with these numerals was translated into Latin in Spain in the 12th century.

===Monasteries===
Monasteries were targeted in the eighth and ninth centuries by Vikings who invaded the coasts of northern Europe. They were targeted not only because they stored books but also precious objects that were looted by invaders. In the earliest monasteries, there were no special rooms set aside as a library, but from the sixth century onwards libraries became an essential aspect of monastic life in Western Europe. The Benedictines placed books in the care of a librarian who supervised their use. In some monastic reading rooms, valuable books would be chained to shelves, but there were also lending sections as well. Copying was also another important aspect of monastic libraries, this was undertaken by resident or visiting monks and took place in the &quot;scriptorium&quot;. In the Byzantine world, religious houses rarely maintained their own copying centres. Instead they acquired donations from wealthy donors. In the tenth century, the largest collection in the Byzantine world was found in the monasteries of Mount Athos (modern-day Greece), which accumulated over 10,000 books. Scholars travelled from one monastery to another in search of the texts they wished to study. Travelling monks were often given funds to buy books, and certain monasteries which held a reputation for intellectual activities welcomed travelling monks who came to copy manuscripts for their own libraries. One of these was the monastery of Bobbio in Italy, which was founded by the Irish abbot Columbanus in 614, and by the ninth century boasted a catalogue of 666 manuscripts, including religious works, classical texts, histories and mathematical treatises.

==Christianity West and East==

From the early Christians, early medieval Christians inherited a church united by major creeds, a stable Biblical canon, and a well-developed philosophical tradition. The history of medieval Christianity traces Christianity during the Middle Ages—the period after the fall of the Western Roman Empire until the Protestant Reformation. The institutional structure of Christianity in the west during this period is different from what it would become later in the Middle Ages. As opposed to the later church, the church of the Early Middle Ages consisted primarily of the monasteries. The practice of simony has caused the ecclesiastical offices to become the property of local princes, and as such the monasteries constituted the only church institution independent of the local princes. In addition, the papacy was relatively weak, and its power was mostly confined to central Italy. Individualized religious practice was uncommon, as it typically required membership in a religious order, such as the Order of Saint Benedict. Religious orders would not proliferate until the high Middle Ages. For the typical Christian at this time, religious participation was largely confined to occasionally receiving mass from wandering monks. Few would receive this as often as once a month. By the end of this period, individual practice of religion was becoming more common, as monasteries started to transform into something approximating modern churches, where some monks might even give occasional sermons.

During the Early Middle Ages, the divide between Eastern and Western Christianity widened, paving the way for the East-West Schism in the 11th century. In the West, the power of the Bishop of Rome expanded. In 607, Boniface III became the first Bishop of Rome to use the title Pope. Pope Gregory I used his office as a temporal power, expanded Rome&#x27;s missionary efforts to the British Isles, and laid the foundations for the expansion of monastic orders. Roman church traditions and practices gradually replaced local variants, including Celtic Christianity in the British Isles. Various barbarian tribes went from raiding and pillaging the island to invading and settling. They were entirely pagan, having never been part of the Empire, though they experienced Christian influence from the surrounding peoples, such as those who were converted by the mission of Augustine of Canterbury, sent by Pope Gregory I. In the East, the conquests of Islam reduced the power of the Greek-speaking patriarchates.

===Christianization of the West===
The Roman Church, the only centralized institution to survive the fall of the Western Roman Empire intact, was the sole unifying cultural influence in the West, preserving Latin learning, maintaining the art of writing, and preserving a centralized administration through its network of bishops ordained in succession. The Early Middle Ages are characterized by the urban control of bishops and the territorial control exercised by dukes and counts. The rise of urban communes marked the beginning of the High Middle Ages.

The Christianization of Germanic tribes began in the 4th century with the Goths and continued throughout the Early Middle Ages, led in the 6th to 7th centuries by the Hiberno-Scottish mission and replaced in the 8th to 9th centuries by the Anglo-Saxon mission, with Anglo-Saxons like Alcuin playing an important role in the Carolingian Renaissance. Boniface, the Apostle of the Germans, propagated Christianity in the Frankish Empire during the 8th century. He helped shape Western Christianity, and many of the dioceses he proposed remain until today. After his martyrdom, he was quickly hailed as a saint. By 1000, even Iceland had become Christian, leaving only more remote parts of Europe (Scandinavia, the Baltic, and Finnic lands) to be Christianized during the High Middle Ages.

==Europe in 1000==

Speculation that the world would end in the year 1000 was confined to a few uneasy French monks. Ordinary clerks used regnal years, e.g. the 4th year of the reign of Robert II (the Pious) of France. The use of the modern &quot;anno domini&quot; system of dating was largely confined to chroniclers of universal history, such as the Venerable Bede.

Western Europe remained less developed compared to the Islamic world, with its vast network of caravan trade, or China, at this time the world&#x27;s most populous empire under the Song Dynasty. Constantinople had a population of about 300,000, but Rome had a mere 35,000 and Paris 20,000. By contrast, Córdoba, in Islamic Spain, at this time the world&#x27;s largest city contained 450,000 inhabitants. The Vikings had a trade network in northern Europe, including a route connecting the Baltic to Constantinople through Russia, as did the Radhanites.

With nearly the entire nation freshly ravaged by the Vikings, England was in a desperate state. The long-suffering English later responded with a massacre of Danish settlers in 1002, leading to a round of reprisals and finally to Danish rule (1013), though England regained independence shortly after. Christianization made rapid progress and proved itself the long-term solution to the problem of barbarian raiding. The territories of Scandinavia were soon to be fully Christianized Kingdoms: Denmark in the 10th century, Norway in the 11th, and Sweden, the country with the least raiding activity, in the 12th. Kievan Rus, recently converted to Orthodox Christianity, flourished as the largest state in Europe. Iceland, Greenland, and Hungary were all declared Christian about 1000.

In Europe, a formalized institution of marriage was established. The proscribed degree of consanguinity varied, but the custom made marriages annullable by application to the Pope. North of Italy, where masonry construction was never extinguished, stone construction was replacing timber in important structures. Deforestation of the densely wooded continent was under way. The 10th century marked a return of urban life, with the Italian cities doubling in population. London, abandoned for many centuries, was again England&#x27;s main economic centre by 1000. By 1000, Bruges and Ghent held regular trade fairs behind castle walls, a tentative return of economic life to western Europe.

In the culture of Europe, several features surfaced soon after 1000 that mark the end of the Early Middle Ages: the rise of the medieval communes, the reawakening of city life, and the appearance of the burgher class, the founding of the first universities, the rediscovery of Roman law, and the beginnings of vernacular literature.

In 1000, the papacy was firmly under the control of German Emperor Otto III, or &quot;emperor of the world&quot; as he styled himself. But later church reforms enhanced its independence and prestige: the Cluniac movement, the building of the first great Transalpine stone cathedrals and the collation of the mass of accumulated decretals into a formulated canon law. Meanwhile, a new Central European power was taking shape, and on Christmas Day of 1000, Stephen I was crowned as the first king of Hungary, stabilising the country, which had been ruled by genera. Like the Civitas Schinesghe, which was also consolidating at the time, the country was seen as a promising political and trading partner, and a &quot;federati&quot; (ally) by the emperor.

==Middle East==
===Rise of Islam===
&quot;Consult particular article for details&quot;

The rise of Islam begins around the time Muhammad and his followers took flight, the Hijra, from Mecca to the city of Medina. Muhammad spent his last ten years in a series of battles to conquer the Arabian region. From 622 to 632, Muhammad as the leader of a Muslim community in Medina was engaged in a state of war with the Meccans. In the proceeding decades, the area of Basra was conquered by the Muslims. During the reign of Umar, the Muslim army found it a suitable place to construct a base. Later the area was settled and a mosque was erected. Madyan was conquered and settled by Muslims, but the environment was considered harsh and the settlers moved to Kufa. Umar defeated the rebellion of several Arab tribes in a successful campaign, unifying the entire Arabian peninsula and giving it stability. Under Uthman&#x27;s leadership, the empire, through the Muslim conquest of Persia, expanded into Fars in 650, some areas of Khorasan in 651, and the conquest of Armenia was begun in the 640s. In this time, the Rashidun Caliphate extended over the whole Sassanid Persian Empire and to more than two-thirds of the Eastern Roman Empire. The First Fitna, or the First Islamic Civil War, lasted for the entirety of Ali ibn Abi Talib&#x27;s reign. After the recorded peace treaty with Hassan ibn Ali and the suppression of early Kharijites&#x27; disturbances, Muawiyah I acceded to the position of Caliph.

===Islamic expansion===
The Muslim conquests of the Eastern Roman Empire and Arab wars occurred between 634 and 750. Starting in 633, Muslims conquered Iraq. The Muslim conquest of Syria would begin in 634 and would be complete by 638. The Muslim conquest of Egypt started in 639. Before the Muslim invasion of Egypt began, the Eastern Roman Empire had already lost the Levant and its Arab ally, the Ghassanid Kingdom, to the Muslims. The Muslims would bring Alexandria under control and the fall of Egypt would be complete by 642. Between 647 and 709, Muslims swept across North Africa and established their authority over that region.

The site of the Grand Mosque was originally a pagan temple, then a Visigothic Christian church, before the Umayyad Moors at first converted the building into a mosque and then built a new mosque on the site.

The Transoxiana region was conquered by Qutayba ibn Muslim between 706 and 715 and loosely held by the Umayyads from 715 to 738. This conquest was consolidated by Nasr ibn Sayyar between 738 and 740. It was under the Umayyads from 740 to 748 and under the Abbasids after 748. Sindh, attacked in 664, would be subjugated by 712. Sindh became the easternmost province of the Umayyad. The Umayyad conquest of Hispania (Visigothic Spain) would begin in 711 and end by 718. The Moors, under Al-Samh ibn Malik, swept up the Iberian peninsula and by 719 overran Septimania; the area would fall under their full control in 720. With the Islamic conquest of Persia, the Muslim subjugation of the Caucasus would take place between 711 and 750. The end of the sudden Islamic Caliphate expansion ended around this time. The final Islamic dominion eroded the areas of the Iron Age Roman Empire in the Middle East and controlled strategic areas of the Mediterranean.

At the end of the 8th century, the former Western Roman Empire was decentralized and overwhelmingly rural. The Islamic conquest and rule of Sicily and Malta was a process which started in the 9th century. Islamic rule over Sicily was effective from 902, and the complete rule of the island lasted from 965 until 1061. The Islamic presence on the Italian Peninsula was ephemeral and limited mostly to semi-permanent soldier camps.

===Caliphs and empire===
The Abbasid Caliphate, ruled by the Abbasid dynasty of caliphs, was the third of the Islamic caliphates. Under the Abbasids, the Islamic Golden Age philosophers, scientists, and engineers of the Islamic world contributed enormously to technology, both by preserving earlier traditions and by adding their own inventions and innovations. Scientific and intellectual achievements blossomed in the period.

The Abbasids built their capital in Baghdad after replacing the Umayyad caliphs from all but the Iberian peninsula. The influence held by Muslim merchants over African-Arabian and Arabian-Asian trade routes was tremendous. As a result, Islamic civilization grew and expanded on the basis of its merchant economy, in contrast to their Christian, Indian, and Chinese peers who built societies from an agricultural landholding nobility.

The Abbasids flourished for two centuries but slowly went into decline with the rise to power of the Turkish army they had created, the Mamluks. Within 150 years of gaining control of Persia, the caliphs were forced to cede power to local dynastic emirs who only nominally acknowledged their authority. After the Abbasids lost their military dominance, the Samanids (or Samanid Empire) rose up in Central Asia. The Sunni Islam empire was a Tajik state and had a Zoroastrian theocratic nobility. It was the next native Persian dynasty after the collapse of the Sassanid Persian empire, caused by the Arab conquest.

<text>Edward Russel Dewey (1895–1978) was an economist who studied cycles in economics and other fields.

==Dewey&#x27;s cycles work==
Dewey first became interested in cycles while Chief Economic Analyst of the Department of Commerce in 1930 or 1931 because President Hoover wanted to know the cause of the Great Depression. Dewey reported that each economist to whom he spoke gave him a different answer and he lost faith in the current economic methods. He received and took advice to study how business behaviour occurred rather than why. Therefore, his views are generally regarded as inconsistent with mainstream economics.

Dewey devoted his life to the study of cycles, claiming that &quot;everything that has been studied has been found to have cycles present.&quot; He carried out extensive studies of cyclicity in economics, geology, biology, sociology, and other disciplines. In 1940, Edward R. Dewey learned of a 1931 Canadian conference on biological cycles held at Matamek. Under the guidance of Dewey and the conference leader, Copley Amory, the conference&#x27;s Permanent Committee was reorganized into the Foundation for the Study of Cycles in 1941, and its scope was enlarged to encompass all disciplines. The foundation was set up with a board that included distinguished scientists and industrialists to act as a central clearing house of cycles studies from diverse areas.

The Foundation made studies of natural and social sciences as well as business and economics, and new methods were devised for isolating significant cycles present in time series. A magazine called &quot;Cycles&quot; was published from June 1950, and the foundation also published a four-volume collection of reports on cycles including some of Dewey&#x27;s selected writings on cycles named &quot;Cycles Classic Library Collection&quot;. Together with author Og Mandino, Dewey published a book entitled &quot;Cycles: The Mysterious Forces That Trigger Events&quot;.

As a result of his research, Dewey asserted that seemingly unrelated time series often had similar cycles periods present and that when they did the phase of these cycles was mostly very similar (cycle synchrony). He also said that there were many cycles with periods that were related by powers or products of 2 and 3. This is illustrated in the table below. To construct this table starting from the period 17.75 years, multiply by three as you proceed along diagonals from lower left to upper right, and multiply by two as you proceed along diagonals from lower right to upper left. Dewey reported that the underlined numbers are commonly occurring periods (in years):

 142.0 213.9 319.5 479.3
 71.0 106.5 159.8
 35.5 53.3
 17.75
 5.92 8.88
 1.97 2.96 4.44
 0.66 0.99 1.48 2.22
 0.22 0.33 0.49 0.74 1.11

Volume IV of the Cycles Classic Library Collection contains 1380 reports of cycles period determinations by scientists, doctors, economists and cycles researchers. In these reports there is a tendency for certain periods of cycles to be reported more commonly. These common periods include the underlined periods above and some other periods such as 9.6 years, found in the 9.6 year cycle of lynx abundance and 3.39 years (40.68 months), found in the US stock market, which Dewey says is the most commonly found period. Dewey further said that:
:&quot;More than 500 different phenomena in 36 different areas of knowledge have been found to fluctuate in rhythmic cycles.&quot;

==Criticism==

===&quot;Cycles: The Science of Prediction&quot;===

In 1947, Dewey and Edwin Franden Dakin published their book &quot;Cycles: The Science of Prediction&quot; which argued the United States economy was driven by four cycles of different length. Robert Gale Woolbert
wrote that they &quot;adduce interesting second-hand statistics to the effect that cyclical tendencies have been observed in industrial, biological and solar phenomena.&quot; Milton Friedman dismissed their theory as pseudoscience:

Joseph Schumpeter also put forward the idea that there were four economic cycles: Kitchin, Juglar, Kuznets and Kondratieff.

===Business cycles===
John Brookes describes Dewey&#x27;s attitude to the business cycle:
:I asked Dewey whether the cycles he was interested in had anything to do with the business cycle that economists were always talking about. Nothing at all, he replied. Although many of the cycles that the Foundation studies occur in economics and business affairs, what is usually called the business cycle is recurrent but not rhythmic – that is, its crests and bottoms do not necessarily occur at regular intervals and so, in the view of the Foundation, it isn&#x27;t a true cycle.

Murray Rothbard critiques Schumpeter&#x27;s and Dewey&#x27;s approach in &quot;Man, Economy, and State&quot;:
:Any such &quot;multicyclic&quot; approach must be set down as a mystical adoption of the fallacy of conceptual realism. There is no reality or meaning to the allegedly independent sets of &quot;cycles.&quot; The market is one interdependent unit, and the more developed it is, the greater the interrelations among market elements. It is therefore impossible for several or numerous independent cycles to coexist as self-contained units. It is precisely the characteristic of a business cycle that it permeates all market activities.
and in &quot;America&#x27;s Great Depression&quot;:
:Some economists—such as Warren and Pearson or Dewey and Dakin —have believed that there are no such things as general business fluctuations—that general movements are but the results of different cycles that take place, at different specific time-lengths, in the various economic activities. To the extent that such varying cycles (such as the 20-year &quot;building cycle&quot; or the seventeen-year cicada cycle) may exist, however, they are irrelevant to a study of business cycles in general or to business depressions in particular. What we are trying to explain are general booms and busts in business.

==The Foundation for the Study of Cycles==
The Foundation for the Study of Cycles (FSC) is an international non-profit research organization for the study of cycles of events. It was incorporated in the State of Connecticut by Edward R. Dewey in 1941 and is currently under the directorship of Dr. Richard Smith.

<text>In quantum mechanics, the principal quantum number (n) of an electron in an atom indicates which electron shell or energy level it is in. Its values are natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).

Hydrogen and Helium, at their lowest energies, have just one electron shell. Lithium through Neon (see periodic table) have two shells: two electrons in the first shell, and up to 8 in the second shell. Larger atoms have more shells. 

The principal quantum number is one of four quantum numbers assigned to each electron in an atom to describe the quantum state of the electron. The other quantum numbers for bound electrons are the total angular momentum of the orbit &quot;ℓ&quot;, the angular momentum in the z direction &quot;ℓz&quot;, and the spin of the electron &quot;s&quot;.

== Overview and history ==
As &quot;n&quot; increases, the electron is also at a higher energy and is, therefore, less tightly bound to the nucleus. For higher &quot;n&quot;, the electron is farther from the nucleus, on average. For each value of &quot;n&quot;, there are &quot;n&quot; accepted &quot;ℓ&quot; (azimuthal) values ranging from 0 to formula_1 inclusively; hence, higher-&quot;n&quot; electron states are more numerous. Accounting for two states of spin, each &quot;n&quot;-shell can accommodate up to 2&quot;n&quot;2 electrons.

In a simplistic one-electron model described below, the total energy of an electron is a negative inverse quadratic function of the principal quantum number &quot;n&quot;, leading to degenerate energy levels for each &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1. In more complex systems—those having forces other than the nucleus–electron Coulomb force—these levels split. For multielectron atoms this splitting results in &quot;subshells&quot; parametrized by &quot;ℓ&quot;. Description of energy levels based on &quot;n&quot; alone gradually becomes inadequate for atomic numbers starting from 5 (boron) and fails completely on potassium (&quot;Z&quot; = 19) and afterwards.

The principal quantum number was first created for use in the semiclassical Bohr model of the atom, distinguishing between different energy levels. With the development of modern quantum mechanics, the simple Bohr model was replaced with a more complex theory of atomic orbitals. However, the modern theory still requires the principal quantum number.

== Derivation ==

There is a set of quantum numbers associated with the energy states of the atom. The four quantum numbers &quot;n&quot;, &quot;ℓ&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, and &quot;s&quot; specify the complete and unique quantum state of a single electron in an atom, called its wave function or orbital. Two electrons belonging to the same atom cannot have the same values for all four quantum numbers, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The Schrödinger wave equation reduces to the three equations that when solved lead to the first three quantum numbers. Therefore, the equations for the first three quantum numbers are all interrelated. The principal quantum number arose in the solution of the radial part of the wave equation as shown below.

The Schrödinger wave equation describes energy eigenstates with corresponding real numbers &quot;En&quot; and a definite total energy, the value of &quot;En&quot;. The bound state energies of the electron in the hydrogen atom are given by:
formula_2The parameter &quot;n&quot; can take only positive integer values. The concept of energy levels and notation were taken from the earlier Bohr model of the atom. Schrödinger&#x27;s equation developed the idea from a flat two-dimensional Bohr atom to the three-dimensional wavefunction model.

In the Bohr model, the allowed orbits were derived from quantized (discrete) values of orbital angular momentum, &quot;L&quot; according to the equation
formula_3
where &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... and is called the principal quantum number, and &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant. This formula is not correct in quantum mechanics as the angular momentum magnitude is described by the azimuthal quantum number, but the energy levels are accurate and classically they correspond to the sum of potential and kinetic energy of the electron.

The principal quantum number &quot;n&quot; represents the relative overall energy of each orbital. The energy level of each orbital increases as its distance from the nucleus increases. The sets of orbitals with the same &quot;n&quot; value are often referred to as an electron shell.

The minimum energy exchanged during any wave–matter interaction is the product of the wave frequency multiplied by the Planck constant. This causes the wave to display particle-like packets of energy called quanta. The difference between energy levels that have different &quot;n&quot; determine the emission spectrum of the element.

In the notation of the periodic table, the main shells of electrons are labeled:

based on the principal quantum number.

The principal quantum number is related to the radial quantum number, &quot;n&quot;&quot;r&quot;, by:
formula_4
where &quot;ℓ&quot; is the azimuthal quantum number and &quot;n&quot;&quot;r&quot; is equal to the number of nodes in the radial wavefunction.

The definite total energy for a particle motion in a common Coulomb field and with a discrete spectrum, is given by:
formula_5
where formula_6 is the Bohr radius.

This discrete energy spectrum resulted from the solution of the quantum mechanical problem on the electron motion in the Coulomb field, coincides with the spectrum that was obtained with the help application of the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization rules to the classical equations. The radial quantum number determines the number of nodes of the radial wave function &quot;R&quot;(&quot;r&quot;).

== Values ==
In chemistry, values &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are used in relation to the electron shell theory, with expected inclusion of &quot;n&quot; = 8 (and possibly 9) for yet-undiscovered period 8 elements. In atomic physics, higher &quot;n&quot; sometimes occur for description of excited states. Observations of the interstellar medium reveal atomic hydrogen spectral lines involving &quot;n&quot; on order of hundreds; values up to 766 were detected.

<doc id="532482" wikidata="Q3559311" url="?curid=532482" title="Arachnoid granulation">
<text>Arachnoid granulations (also arachnoid villi, and Pacchionian granulations or bodies) are small outpouchings of the arachnoid mater and subarachnoid space into the dural venous sinuses of the brain. The granulations are thought to mediate the draining of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the subarachnoid space into the venous system.

The largest and most numerous granulations lie along the superior sagittal sinus; they are however present along other dural sinuses as well.

== Anatomy ==
The granulations are often situated near where cerebral veins drain into the dural sinuses. They are most prominent along the superior sagittal sinus, particularly those lodged within the lateral lacunae. In order of decreasing frequency, the granulations occur within the: superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinuses, superior petrosal sinuses, and straight sinus.

The arachnoid granulations may be lodged within granular foveae — small pits upon the inner surface of the cranial bones.

=== Structure ===
The arachnoid granulations are local outpouchings of the arachnoid mater, as well as the subarachnoid space enclosed within it, into the dural venous sinuses. The granulations exhibit a thinner stalk that penetrates through the wall of a venous sinus, and a distended head formed within the lumen of the sinus. The head consists of a trabecular collagenous core that is largely covered by a dural cupula, except for an apical cap — some 0.3 mm in diameter — of arachnoid cells attached directly to the dural venous endothelium.

=== Development ===
The granulations develop during childhood as separate arachnoid villi gradually aggregate into macroscopic clumps.

==Function==
The arachnoid granulations are notably thought to be involved in resorption of cerebrospinal fluid, however, their function is not entirely understood.

=== Cerebrospinal fluid resorption ===
The arachnoid granulations act as one-way valves. Normally the pressure of the CSF is higher than that of the venous system, so CSF flows through the granulations into the blood. If the pressure is reversed for some reason, fluid will not pass back into the subarachnoid space. The reason for this is not known. It has been suggested that the endothelial cells of the venous sinus create vacuoles of CSF, which move through the cell and out into the blood.

The importance of arachnoid granulations for the drainage of CSF is controversial. The granulations are sparse during early life, possibly underscoring the importance of alternate mechanisms of drainage. A large portion (perhaps the majority) of CSF may in fact drain through lymphatics associated with extracranial segments of cranial nerves - especially through axons of CN I (olfactory nerve) through their extension through the cribriform plate.

=== Subarachnoid systolic overpressure dampening ===
A suggested alternative or additional function of the granulation may be the dispersal of the overpressure wave formed within the subarachnoid space by the pulsation of arteries during systole. As the venous sinuses are enclosed in rigid dural structures, they represent a non-distensible compartment into which subarachnoid pressure increases may be dispersed.

== Clinical significance ==
Age-related degenerative changes of the granulations and consequent decreased CSF resorption may underlie normal pressure hydrocephalus (which may in turn be pathogenetically implicated in additional age-related neurodegenerative disorders.

==Eponym==
Occasionally, they are referred to by their old name: Pacchioni&#x27;s bodies, named after Italian anatomist Antonio Pacchioni.

<doc id="532486" wikidata="Q926250" url="?curid=532486" title="Choroid plexus">
<text>The choroid plexus, or plica choroidea, is a plexus of cells that arises from the tela choroidea in each of the ventricles of the brain. Regions of the choroid plexus produce and secrete most of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the central nervous system. The choroid plexus consists of modified ependymal cells surrounding a core of capillaries and loose connective tissue. Multiple cilia on the ependymal cells move to circulate the cerebrospinal fluid.

== Structure ==

=== Location ===

There is a choroid plexus in each of the four ventricles. In the lateral ventricles, it is found in the body, and continued in an enlarged amount in the atrium. There is no choroid plexus in the anterior horn. In the third ventricle, there is a small amount in the roof that is continuous with that in the body, via the interventricular foramina, the channels that connect the lateral ventricles with the third ventricle. A choroid plexus is in part of the roof of the fourth ventricle.

=== Microanatomy ===
The choroid plexus consists of a layer of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding a core of capillaries and loose connective tissue. The epithelium of the choroid plexus is continuous with the ependymal cell layer (ventricular layer) that lines the ventricular system. Progenitor ependymal cells are monociliated but they differentiate into multiciliated ependymal cells. Unlike the ependyma, the choroid plexus epithelial layer has tight junctions between the cells on the side facing the ventricle (apical surface). These tight junctions prevent the majority of substances from crossing the cell layer into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); thus the choroid plexus acts as a blood–CSF barrier. The choroid plexus folds into many villi around each capillary, creating frond-like processes that project into the ventricles. The villi, along with a brush border of microvilli, greatly increase the surface area of the choroid plexus. CSF is formed as plasma is filtered from the blood through the epithelial cells. Choroid plexus epithelial cells actively transport sodium ions into the ventricles and water follows the resulting osmotic gradient.

The choroid plexus consists of many capillaries, separated from the ventricles by choroid epithelial cells. Fluid filters through these cells from blood to become cerebrospinal fluid. There is also much active transport of substances into, and out of, the CSF as it is made.

==Function==

The choroid plexus regulates the production and composition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), that provides the protective buoyancy for the brain. CSF acts as a medium for the glymphatic filtration system that facilitates the removal of metabolic waste from the brain, and the exchange of biomolecules and xenobiotics into and out of the brain. In this way the choroid plexus has a very important role in helping to maintain the delicate extracellular environment required by the brain to function optimally.

The choroid plexus is also a major source of transferrin secretion that plays a part in iron homeostasis in the brain.

===Blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier===

The blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) is a fluid–brain barrier that is composed of a pair of membranes that separate blood from CSF at the capillary level and CSF from brain tissue. The blood–CSF boundary at the choroid plexus is a membrane composed of epithelial cells and tight junctions that link them. There is a CSF-brain barrier at the level of the pia mater, but only in the embryo.

Similar to the blood–brain barrier, the blood–CSF barrier functions to prevent the passage of most blood-borne substances into the brain, while selectively permitting the passage of specific substances (such as nutrients) into the brain and facilitating the removal of brain metabolites and metabolic products into the blood. Despite the similar function between the BBB and BCSFB, each facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinctive structural characteristics of each of the two barrier systems. For a number of substances, the BCSFB is the primary site of entry into brain tissue.

The blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier has also been shown to modulate the entry of leukocytes from the blood to the central nervous system. The choroid plexus cells secrete cytokines that recruit monocyte-derived macrophages, among other cells, to the brain. This cellular trafficking has implications both in normal brain homeostasis and in neuroinflammatory processes.

==Clinical significance==

===Choroid plexus cysts===
During fetal development, some choroid plexus cysts may form. These fluid-filled cysts can be detected by a detailed second trimester ultrasound. The finding is relatively common, with a prevalence of ~1%. Choroid plexus cysts are usually an isolated finding. The cysts typically disappear later during pregnancy, and are usually harmless. They have no effect on infant and early childhood development.

Choroid plexus cysts are associated with a 1% risk of fetal aneuploidy. The risk of aneuploidy increases to 10.5-12% if other risk factors or ultrasound findings are noted. Size, location, disappearance or progression, and whether the cysts are found on both sides or not do not affect the risk of aneuploidy. 44-50% of Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) cases will present with choroid plexus cysts, as well 1.4% of Down syndrome (trisomy 21) cases. ~75% of abnormal karyotypes associated with choroid plexus cysts are trisomy 18, while the remainder are trisomy 21.

===Other===

There are three graded types of choroid plexus tumor that mainly affect young children. These types of cancer are rare.

==Etymology==
Choroid plexus translates from the Latin , which mirrors Ancient Greek . The word &quot;chorion&quot; was used by Galen to refer to the outer membrane enclosing the fetus. Both meanings of the word plexus are given as pleating, or braiding. As often happens language changes and the use of both &quot;choroid&quot; or &quot;chorioid&quot; is both accepted. Nomina Anatomica (now Terminologia Anatomica) reflected this dual usage.

<text>Primary care is a model of health care that supports first-contact, accessible, continuous, comprehensive and coordinated person-focused care. It aims to optimise population health and reduce disparities across the population by ensuring that subgroups have equal access to services.

Primary care is the day-to-day healthcare given by a health care provider. Typically this provider acts as the first contact and principal point of continuing care for patients within a healthcare system, and coordinates other care the patient may need. Patients commonly receive primary care from professionals such as a primary care physician (general practitioner or family physician), a physician assistant, a physical therapist, or a nurse practitioner. In some localities, such a professional may be a registered nurse, a pharmacist, a clinical officer (as in parts of Africa), or an Ayurvedic or other traditional medicine professional (as in parts of Asia). Depending on the nature of the health condition, patients may then be referred for secondary or tertiary care.

==Background==
The World Health Organization attributes the provision of essential primary care as an integral component of an inclusive primary healthcare strategy. Primary care involves the widest scope of healthcare, including all ages of patients, patients of all socioeconomic and geographic origins, patients seeking to maintain optimal health, and patients with all manner of acute and chronic physical, mental and social health issues, including multiple chronic diseases. Consequently, a primary care practitioner must possess a wide breadth of knowledge in many areas. Continuity is a key characteristic of primary care, as patients usually prefer to consult the same practitioner for routine check-ups and preventive care, health education, and every time they require an initial consultation about a new health problem. Collaboration among providers is a desirable characteristic of primary care.

The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) is a standardized tool for understanding and analyzing information on interventions in primary care by the reason for the patient visit. Common chronic illnesses usually treated in primary care may include, for example: hypertension, angina, diabetes, asthma, COPD, depression and anxiety, back pain, arthritis or thyroid dysfunction. Primary care also includes many basic maternal and child health care services, such as family planning services and vaccinations.

In context of global population ageing, with increasing numbers of older adults at greater risk of chronic non-communicable diseases, rapidly increasing demand for primary care services is expected around the world, in both developed and developing countries.

Funding for primary care varies a great deal between different countries: general taxation, national insurance systems, private insurance and direct payment by patients are all used, sometimes in combination. The payment system for primary care physicians also varies. Some are paid by fee-for-service and some by capitation for a list of registered patients.

==Primary care by region==

===Canada===

In Canada, access to primary and other healthcare services is guaranteed for all citizens through the Canada Health Act.

===Hong Kong===
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government&#x27;s 2016 Policy Address recommended strengthening the development of primary care and establishing an electronic database of the &quot;Primary Care Guide&quot; to facilitate public consultation. The Department of Health developed reference profiles for preventive care for some chronic diseases.

In 2017, the policy address recommended the establishment of a primary health care development steering committee to comprehensively review the planning of primary health care services and provide community medical services through regional medical and social cooperation.

The 2018 policy address proposed the establishment of the first district health centre and promoted the establishment of district centre in other districts.

The Hong Kong Food and Health Bureau established the Primary Healthcare Office on March 1, 2019, to monitor and supervise the development of primary health care services. In the process of developing the district health centers, regional health stations will be set up in various districts as transitional units offering the public with primary care services.

===Nigeria===

In Nigeria, healthcare is a concurrent responsibility of three tiers of government. Local governments focus on the delivery of primary care (e.g. through a system of dispensaries), state governments manage the various general hospitals (secondary care), while the federal government&#x27;s role is mostly limited to coordinating the affairs of the Federal Medical Centres and university teaching hospitals (tertiary care).general medical

===Poland===
Basic Primary care, () is a basic, common element of the health care system in Poland.

The basic health care unit (formerly: health care facility) is a medical entity that provides comprehensive care for people who have declared their willingness to use the services of a family doctor or another doctor who has the right to create an active list of patients. This means treatment and prevention of diseases, rehabilitation, as well as adjudication on the state of health. For a health care center to become a primary care provider, it must also provide care for its health visitor and midwife.

Since 2007, only General Practitioners, doctors undergoing specialization in family medicine, and doctors who have previously acquired the right to create an active list due to seniority in POZ before 2007 can be doctors creating active primary care lists. The currently pending proposals of the Ministry of Health, granting the right to create an active list to internists and pediatricians without experience of working in primary care, met with severe criticism of all family medicine organizations.

In organizational terms, POZ can act as:
* non-public healthcare facility (NZOZ) - private company
* independent public health care institution (SPZOZ) - a state unit or subordinate to local government
* individual medical practice - private medical or nursing practice
* group medical practice - a group of private medical or nursing practices
* group / individual practice of community and family nurses
* group / individual practice of community midwives.

The Act of October 27, 2017 on basic health care (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 172) has been in force since 2017.

POZ clinics are independent companies (except SPZOZ), however, the services they provide are free for insured persons when POZ has a contract with the National Health Fund.

===Russia===

Primary health care () in the Russian Federation is free (as part of territorial compulsory health insurance programs).

Primary health care includes measures for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment of diseases and conditions, medical rehabilitation, monitoring the course of pregnancy, the formation of a healthy lifestyle, including reducing the level of risk factors for diseases, and sanitary and hygienic education. Primary health care is provided to citizens on an outpatient basis and in an inpatient setting, in planned and emergency forms.

Types of primary health care:
* primary pre-medical health care
* primary medical care
* primary specialized health care
* Primary pre-medical health care is provided by paramedics, obstetricians and other medical workers with secondary medical education.

Primary medical health care is provided by general practitioners, district general practitioners, pediatricians, district general pediatricians and general practitioners (family doctors). Primary specialized health care is provided by specialist doctors, including medical specialists from medical organizations that provide specialized, including high-tech, medical care.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, patients can access primary care services through their local general practice, community pharmacy, optometrist, dental surgery and community hearing care providers. Services are generally provided free-at-the-point-contact through the National Health Service. In the UK, unlike many other countries, patients do not normally have direct access to hospital consultants and the GP controls access to secondary care. This practice is referred to as &quot;gatekeeping&quot;; the future of this role has been questioned by researchers who conclude &quot;Gatekeeping policies should be revisited to accommodate the government&#x27;s aim to modernise the NHS in terms of giving patients more choice and facilitate more collaborative work between GPs and specialists. At the same time, any relaxation of gatekeeping should be carefully evaluated to ensure the clinical and non-clinical benefits outweigh the costs&quot;.

===United States===
As of 2012, there were about six primary care professional societies in the United States, including American College of Physicians, American Academy of Family Physicians, the Society of General Internal Medicine, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Osteopathic Association, and the American Geriatrics Society.

A 2009 report by the New England Healthcare Institute determined that increased demand for primary care by older, sicker patients and decreased supply of primary care practitioners has led to a crisis in primary care delivery. The research identified a set of innovations that could enhance the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of primary care in the United States.

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law. The law is estimated to have expanded health insurance coverage by 20 million people by early 2016 and is expected to expand health care to 34 million people by 2021. The success of the expansion of health insurance under the ACA in large measure depends on the availability of primary care physicians. The ACA has drastically exacerbated the projected deficit of primary care physicians needed to ensure care for insured Americans. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), without the ACA, the United States would have been short roughly 64,000 physicians by 2020; with the implementation of the ACA, it will be 91,000 physicians short. According to the AAMC&#x27;s November 2009 physician work force report, nationally, the rate of physicians providing primary care is 79.4 physicians per 100,000 residents.

Primary healthcare results in better health outcomes, reduced health disparities, and lower spending, including on avoidable emergency department visits and hospital care. That said, primary care physicians are an important component in ensuring that the healthcare system as a whole is sustainable. However, despite their importance to the healthcare system, the primary care position has suffered in terms of its prestige in part due to the differences in salary compared to doctors that decide to specialize. A 2010 national study of physician wages conducted by the UC Davis Health System found that specialists are paid as much as 52 percent more than primary care physicians, even though primary care physicians see far more patients.

In 2005, primary care physicians earned $60.48 per hour; specialists, on average earned $88.34. A follow-up study conducted by the UC Davis Health System found that earnings throughout the careers of primary care physicians averaged as much as $2.8 million less than the earnings of their specialist colleagues. This discrepancy in pay has potentially made primary care a less attractive choice for medical school graduates. In 2015, almost 19,000 doctors graduated from American medical schools, and only 7 percent of graduates chose a career in primary care. The average age of a primary care physician in the United States is 47 years old, and one-quarter of all primary care physicians are nearing retirement. Fifty years ago, roughly half of the physicians in America practiced primary care; today, fewer than one-third of them do.

Projections show that by the year 2033, the population of individuals 65 and older will increase by 45.1%, creating a demand for primary care physicians that is greater than the supply.

The medical home model is intended to help coordinate care with the primary care provider at the center of the patient&#x27;s healthcare.

====Strategies to address the primary care shortage====
The Patient Protection Affordable Care Act contains several provisions to increase primary care capacity. These provisions are directed towards medical school graduates and include payment reform, student loan forgiveness programs, and increased primary care residency positions The PPACA also provides funding and mandates to increase the role of mid-level practitioners like physician assistants and nurse practitioners to enhance the primary care workforce. The PPACA is projected to increase patient demand for primary care services. By adopting new patient care delivery models that include physicians working in tandem with physician assistants and nurse practitioners, the demand for future primary care services could be met. Consumer surveys have found the American public to be open to a greater role for physician extenders in the primary care setting. Policies and laws, primarily at the state level, would need to redefine and reallocate the roles and responsibilities for non-physician licensed providers to optimize these new models of care.

According to a FAIR Health analysis, 29 percent of patients who received medical care in the US between 2016 and 2022 did not see a primary care doctor.

== Shared-decision making ==

=== Involving older patients ===
There is currently limited evidence to form a robust conclusion that involving older patients with multiple long-term conditions in decision-making during primary care consultations has benefits. Examples of patient involvement in decision-making about their health care include patient workshops and coaching, individual patient coaching. Further research in this developing area is needed.

<text>David John Wheeler (9 February 1927 – 13 December 2004) was an English computer scientist and professor of computer science at the University of Cambridge.

== Education ==
Wheeler was born in Birmingham, England, the second of the three children of (Agnes) Marjorie, &quot;née&quot; Gudgeon, and Arthur Wheeler, a press tool maker, engineer, and proprietor of a small shopfitting firm. He was educated at a local primary school in Birmingham and then went on to King Edward VI Camp Hill School after winning a scholarship in 1938. His education was disrupted by World War II, and he completed his sixth form studies at Hanley High School. In 1945 he gained a scholarship to study the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1948. He was awarded the world&#x27;s first PhD in computer science in 1951.

==Career==
Wheeler&#x27;s contributions to the field included work on the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) in the 1950s and the Burrows–Wheeler transform (published 1994). Along with Maurice Wilkes and Stanley Gill, he is credited with the invention around 1951 of the subroutine (which they referred to as the &quot;closed subroutine&quot;), and gave the first explanation of how to design software libraries; as a result, the &quot;jump to subroutine&quot; instruction was often called a Wheeler Jump. Wilkes published a paper in 1953 discussing relative addressing to facilitate the use of subroutines. (However, Turing had discussed subroutines in a paper of 1945 on design proposals for the NPL ACE, going so far as to invent the concept of a return address stack.)

He was responsible for the implementation of the CAP computer, the first to be based on security capabilities. In cryptography, he was the designer of WAKE and the co-designer of the TEA and XTEA encryption algorithms together with Roger Needham. In 1950, with Maurice Wilkes, he used EDSAC to solve a differential equation relating to gene frequencies in a paper by Ronald Fisher. This represents the first use of a computer for a problem in the field of biology.

He became a Fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge in 1964 and formally retired in 1994, although he continued to be an active member of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory until his death.

== Personal life ==
On 24 August 1957 Wheeler married astrophysics research student Joyce Margaret Blackler, who had used EDSAC for her own mathematical investigations as a research student from 1955. Together they had two daughters and a son.

Wheeler died of a heart attack on 13 December 2004 while cycling home from the Computer Laboratory.

== Recognition and legacy ==
Wheeler:
* In 1981 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society
* In 1985 received a Computer Pioneer Award for his contributions to assembly language programming
* In 1994 was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery
* In 2003 was named a Computer History Museum Fellow Award recipient &quot;for his invention of the closed subroutine, and for his architectural contributions to ILLIAC, the Cambridge Ring, and computer testing&quot;

The Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge annually holds the &quot;Wheeler Lecture&quot;, a series of distinguished lectures named after him.

== Quotes ==
Wheeler is often quoted as saying &quot;All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection.&quot; or &quot;All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection, except for the problem of too many layers of indirection.&quot; This has been called the fundamental theorem of software engineering.

Another quotation attributed to him is &quot;Compatibility means deliberately repeating other people&#x27;s mistakes.&quot;

<doc id="532503" wikidata="Q52454" url="?curid=532503" title="International Tennis Hall of Fame">
<text>The International Tennis Hall of Fame is located in Newport, Rhode Island, United States. It honors both players and other contributors to the sport of tennis. The complex, the former Newport Casino, includes a museum, 13 grass tennis courts, an indoor tennis facility with three courts, three outdoor hard courts, one green clay court, a court tennis facility, and a theatre. The International Tennis Hall of Fame is a non-profit organization with the goal of preserving, celebrating, and inspiring the sport of tennis around the world.

==History==

The hall of fame and museum are located in the Newport Casino, which was commissioned in 1879 by James Gordon Bennett Jr. as part of an exclusive resort for wealthy Newport summer residents. It was designed by Charles McKim along with Stanford White, who did the interiors. It is an example of Victorian Shingle Style architecture. In 1881, the Real Tennis Court (housing the National Tennis Club) and the Casino Theatre were constructed at the east end of the campus. The club was opened on July 1, 1880, after a six-month construction period and quickly became a fashionable venue for Newport summer residents.

The United States Lawn Tennis Association held its first championships at the Newport Casino in 1881. The event was held annually through 1914, by which time tennis had become the key attraction at the resort. The championship was suspended during World War I.

But by the 1950s, the retreat was struggling financially, as tourism preferences changed. It was at risk of being demolished for redevelopment of modern retail space, but the building was purchased and saved by Jimmy and Candy Van Alen, wealthy Newport summer residents. A sportsman himself, in 1954, Jimmy Van Alen established the National Tennis Hall of Fame and Museum in the Casino. The combination of tennis matches and the museum allowed the building to be saved. 

Van Alen intended the facility to be &quot;a shrine to the ideals of the game&quot;, and was elected president of the hall in 1957. The International Tennis Hall of Fame was officially sanctioned by the United States Tennis Association at its foundation in 1954. In 1975, with the induction of England&#x27;s Fred Perry, the organization officially became the International Tennis Hall of Fame. It was recognized by the International Tennis Federation in 1986. The first Hall of Fame members were inducted in 1955; as of 2023, a total of 262 inductees from 27 countries have been recognized.

In 2015, Martina Hingis was appointed as the first Global Ambassador for the International Tennis Hall of Fame. In 2016, Guga Kuerten was appointed a Global Ambassador, and in 2017 Michael Chang was appointed a Global Ambassador.

The current Board of Governors includes former professional tennis players Kim Clijsters (Honorary President), Patrick McEnroe (President), Gigi Fernández, Katrina Adams, and Vijay Amritraj.

==Museum==

The museum chronicles the history of the sport from the 12th century through the modern day. The museum&#x27;s permanent collection contains approximately 30,000 objects, including modern and historic tennis equipment, fine art, decorative arts, artifacts from Hall of Famers and other significant figures within the sport, trophies, textiles and clothing, ephemera, and furnishings. The museum&#x27;s Information Research Center (IRC) houses 5,000 books, 3,000+ audio-visual materials, 1 million plus photographic images, and a comprehensive collection of magazines, programs, periodicals, blueprints and archival materials. The collection is displayed year-round in the museum&#x27;s of exhibit space. The museum also offers several digital exhibits.

The museum reopened in May 2015 following a nearly complete renovation of its exhibition spaces. The redesigned and reinterpreted galleries encompass more than 12,000 square feet of interactive exhibits, videos, and approximately 2,000 artifacts related to tennis&#x27; history and champions past and present. 

The museum was initially accredited by the American Alliance of Museums in 2013, and subsequently reaccredited in 2022.

The museum became a Smithsonian Affiliate in 2017.

The museum is also a partner of the Google Arts &amp; Culture initiative.

==Infosys Hall of Fame Open==
The Hall of Fame hosts several tournaments, including the Infosys Hall of Fame Open in July. The Infosys Hall of Fame Open is a part of the US Open Series, as well as being part of the men&#x27;s ATP World Tour, the tournament is the only grass court event in North America. Top male players come to Newport directly from Wimbledon to compete for the Van Alen Cup at the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Past champions include Americans John Isner (4× Hall of Fame Open Champion) and Mardy Fish, two-time champion Fabrice Santoro of France, and Australia&#x27;s Lleyton Hewitt. During the tournament, Tennis Hall of Famers are officially inducted in front of family, friends, fans, and fellow members of the Tennis Hall of Fame.

==Members==
Being inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame is the ultimate honor in tennis. It represents the sum of one&#x27;s achievements and contributions as being among the most important and transformative in tennis history. There is a seven-step process to be inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame. A player or contributor must be nominated to be inducted, and then the national enshrinement committee reviews their eligibility. Once it is decided if they are eligible, the committee reviews if the nominee will be considered by voters. After review, the voting begins; both group and fan voting takes place. A nominee must receive at least 75% from the Official Voting Group result or a combined total of 75% or more from the Official Voting Group result and any bonus percentage points they earn through the Fan Vote. Votes are tallied by an independent accounting firm. The class induction is announced in January, and the new class is inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in July at the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

<doc id="532504" wikidata="Q513278" url="?curid=532504" title="Got Milk?">
<text>Got Milk? (often stylized as got milk?) is an American advertising campaign on television and YouTube encouraging the consumption of milk and dairy products. Created by the advertising agency Goodby Silverstein &amp; Partners for the California Milk Processor Board in 1993, it was later licensed for use by milk processors and dairy farmers. It was launched in 1993 by the &quot;Aaron Burr&quot; television commercial, directed by Michael Bay. The national campaign, run by MilkPEP (Milk Processor Education Program) began to add the &quot;got milk?&quot; logo to its &quot;Milk Mustache&quot; ads in 1995.

In January 2014, MilkPEP discontinued its Milk Mustache and &quot;got milk?&quot; advertisements, launching a new campaign with the tagline &quot;Milk Life&quot;. The campaign continued in California and the &quot;got milk?&quot; trademark is licensed to food and merchandise companies for U.S. and international sales. The campaign has led to increased milk sales in California, although not nationwide.

==History==

The initial Got Milk? phrase was created by the American advertising agency Goodby Silverstein &amp; Partners. In an interview in &quot;Art &amp; Copy&quot;, a 2009 documentary that focused on the origins of famous advertising slogans, Jeff Goodby and Rich Silverstein said that the phrase almost didn&#x27;t turn into an advertising campaign. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, people at Goodby Silverstein &quot;thought it was lazy, not to mention grammatically incorrect&quot;.

The advertisements would typically feature people in various situations involving dry or sticky foods and treats such as cakes and cookies. The people then would find themselves in an uncomfortable situation due to a full mouth and no milk to wash it down. These include a commercial of a cruel businessman getting hit by a truck seconds after insulting someone over the phone and seemingly going to Heaven, only to find out it is actually Hell where he finds a huge plate of cookies and an endless supply of completely empty milk cartons; as well as a commercial of an airplane pilot intentionally putting his plane into a dangerously steep nosedive in order to obtain a bottle of milk from a flight attendant&#x27;s cart out of his reach, only for the cart to crash into a man who gets out of the bathroom right in front of the cart and the bottle to tip over. At the end of the commercial, the character would look directly to the camera sadly and then boldly displayed would be the words &quot;Got Milk?&quot; The print advertisements would feature food such as a sandwich, cookies, or cupcakes with a bite taken out of them or cats, and children demanding milk.

The first Got Milk? advertisement aired nationwide on October 29, 1993, which featured a historian (played by Sean Whalen) receiving a call to answer a radio station&#x27;s $10,000 trivia question (voiced by Rob Paulsen), &quot;Who shot Alexander Hamilton in that famous duel?&quot; (referring to the Burr–Hamilton duel). The man is shown to have an entire museum solely for the duel itself, packed with all the artifacts. He answers the question correctly by saying &quot;Aaron Burr&quot;, but because his mouth is full of peanut butter sandwich and he does not have milk to wash it down, his answer is unintelligible. The DJ promptly hangs up on him, as he whimpers the answer one last time to show his displeasure on having missed out on the prize. The ad, directed by Michael Bay, was at the top of the advertising industry&#x27;s award circuit in 1994. In 2002, the ad was named one of the ten best commercials of all time by a &quot;USA Today&quot; poll and was run again nationwide that same year.

The slogan &quot;Got Milk?&quot; was licensed to the National Milk Processor Education Program (MilkPEP) in 1995 to use on its print ads, which, since then, have included celebrities like Britney Spears, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Serena Williams, and Venus Williams, as well as fictional characters from TV, video games, and films such as the Avengers, the Simpsons, Batman, Mario, the Powerpuff Girls, and SpongeBob SquarePants posing in print advertisements sporting a &quot;milk mustache&quot; and employing the slogan &quot;Where&#x27;s &quot;your&quot; mustache?&quot; The milk mustache campaign was created by art director Bernie Hogya and copywriter Jennifer Gold. The milk mustache campaign promoting the Super Bowl has also been featured in &quot;USA Today&quot;; the Friday edition featured one player from each Super Bowl team to the player from the winning team in Monday&#x27;s edition. It was not featured in 2014 since the advertising focus that year was on the &quot;Protein Fight Club&quot; campaign, which promoted the importance of eating breakfast with milk, and the &quot;Refuel: Got Chocolate Milk&quot; campaign.

Former California Governor Gray Davis expressed his dislike for one commercial and asked if there was a way to remove it from the air. It featured two children who refuse to drink milk, because they believe milk is for babies. They tell their mother that their elderly next-door neighbor, Mr. Miller, never drinks milk. They see him going to use his wheelbarrow when suddenly his arms rip off because, having not consumed milk, his bones are weak and fragile. The children scream in horror and then frighteningly start imbibing every last drop of milk they have.

From 1994 to 2005, ads appeared in California directed at Hispanic consumers, using the tagline &quot;Familia, Amor y Leche&quot; (&quot;Family, Love and Milk&quot;), created by Anita Santiago Advertising. In 2005, the Spanish-language campaign was awarded to ad agency Grupo Gallegos, which changed the tagline to “toma leche”, or “drink milk”.

According to the Got Milk? website, the campaign has over 90% awareness in the United States, and the tagline has been licensed to dairy boards across the nation since 1995. Got Milk? is a powerful property and has been licensed on a range of consumer goods, including Barbie dolls, Hot Wheels, baby and teen apparel, and kitchenware. The trademarked line has been widely parodied by groups championing a variety of causes. Many of these parodies use a lookalike rather than the actual persons used in the original Got Milk? advertisements. In 2005, the California Milk Processor Board created a &quot;Got Ripped Off?&quot; poster showcasing its top 100 favorite parodies of the slogan.

The voice saying &quot;Got Milk?&quot; in most of the nationwide television commercials is that of American voiceover actor Denny Delk. Other narrators have occasionally been used.

In February 2014, MilkPEP announced that it would discontinue licensing the slogan for its advertising in favor of a new tagline, &quot;Milk Life&quot;. Despite this, the California Milk Processor Board (the creators and owners of the trademark) continue to use it. 

In 2020, MilkPEP revived the campaign in light of increased sales during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>A breech birth is when a baby is born bottom first instead of head first, as is normal. Around 3–5% of pregnant women at term (37–40 weeks pregnant) have a breech baby. Due to their higher than average rate of possible complications for the baby, breech births are generally considered higher risk. Breech births also occur in many other mammals such as dogs and horses, see veterinary obstetrics.

Most babies in the breech position are delivered via caesarean section because it is seen as safer than being born vaginally. Doctors and midwives in the developing world often lack many of the skills required to safely assist women giving birth to a breech baby vaginally. Also, delivering all breech babies by caesarean section in developing countries is difficult to implement as there are not always resources available to provide this service. 

==Cause==
With regard to the fetal presentation during pregnancy, three periods have been distinguished.

During the first period, which lasts until the 24th gestational week, the incidence of a longitudinal lie increases, with equal proportions of breech or cephalic presentations from this lie. This period is characterized by frequent changes of presentations. The fetuses in breech presentation during this period have the same probability for breech and cephalic presentation at delivery.

During the second period, lasting from the 25th to the 35th gestational week, the incidence of cephalic presentation increases, with a proportional decrease of breech presentation. The second period is characterized by a higher than random probability that the fetal presentation during this period will also be present at the time of delivery. The increase of this probability is gradual and identical for breech and cephalic presentations during this period.

In the third period, from the 36th gestational week onward, the incidence of cephalic and breech presentations remain stable, i.e. breech presentation around 3–4% and cephalic presentation approximately 95%. In the general population, incidence of breech presentation at preterm corresponds to the incidence of breech presentation when birth occurs.

A breech presentation at delivery occurs when the fetus does not turn to a cephalic presentation. This failure to change presentation can result from endogenous and exogenous factors. Endogenous factors involve fetal inability to adequately move, whereas exogenous factors refer to insufficient intrauterine space available for fetal movements.

The incidence of breech presentation is affected by both maternal and fetal diseases and medical conditions. When these factors are present, the probability of breech presentation is between 4% and 50%.

===Rates in various medical conditions===

** Second twin 28–39%
** Stillborn 26%

** Amniotic sheet perpendicular to the placenta 50%
** Cornual–fundal implantation of the placenta 30%
** Placenta previa 12.5%
** Oligohydramnios 17%
** Polyhydramnios 15.8%
*Maternal entities:
** Uterus arcuatus 22.6%
** Uterus unicornuatus 33.3%
** Uterus bicornuatus 34.8%
** Uterus didelphys 30–41%
** Uterus septus 45.8%
** Leiomyoma uteri 9–20%
** Spinal cord injury 10%
** Carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy 17%
*Combination of two medical entities:
** First twin in uterus with two bodies 14.29%
** Second twin in uterus with two bodies 18.52%.

Also, women with previous caesarean deliveries have a risk of breech presentation at term twice that of women with previous vaginal deliveries.

The highest possible probability of breech presentation of 50% indicates that breech presentation is a consequence of random filling of the intrauterine space, with the same probability of breech and cephalic presentation in a longitudinally elongated uterus.

==Types==
Types of breech depend on how the baby&#x27;s legs are lying.

* A frank breech (otherwise known as an extended breech) is where the baby&#x27;s legs are up next to its abdomen, with its knees straight and its feet next to its ears. This is the most common type of breech.
* A complete breech (or flexed breech) is when the baby appears as though it is sitting crossed-legged with its legs bent at the hips and knees.
* A footling breech is when one or both of the baby&#x27;s feet are born first instead of the pelvis. This is more common in babies born prematurely or before their due date.
*A kneeling breech is when the baby is born knees first.

In addition to the above, breech births in which the sacrum is the fetal denominator can be classified by the position of a fetus. Thus sacro-anterior, sacro-transverse and sacro-posterior positions all exist but left sacro-anterior is the most common presentation. Sacro-anterior indicates an easier delivery compared to other forms.

== Complications ==
Umbilical cord prolapse may occur, particularly in the complete, footling, or kneeling breech. This is caused by the lowermost parts of the baby not completely filling the space of the dilated cervix. When the waters break the amniotic sac, it is possible for the umbilical cord to drop down and become compressed. This complication severely diminishes oxygen flow to the baby, so the baby needs to be delivered immediately so that he or she can breathe. In these circumstances a caesarean section is likely to be recommended. If there is a delay in delivery, the brain can be damaged. Among full-term, head-down babies, cord prolapse is quite rare, occurring in 0.4 percent. Among frank breech babies the incidence is 0.5 percent, among complete breeches 5 percent, and among footling breeches 15 percent.

Head entrapment is caused by the failure of the fetal head to negotiate the maternal midpelvis. At full term, the fetal bitrochanteric diameter (the distance between the outer points of the hips) is about the same as the biparietal diameter (the transverse diameter of the skull)—in simplest terms, the size of the hips is the same as the size of the head. The relatively larger buttocks dilate the cervix as effectively as the head does in the typical head-down presentation. In contrast, the relative head size of a preterm baby is greater than the fetal buttocks. If the baby is preterm, it may be possible for the baby&#x27;s body to emerge while the cervix has not dilated enough for the head to emerge.

Because the umbilical cord—the baby&#x27;s oxygen supply—is significantly compressed while the head is in the pelvis during a breech birth, it is important that the delivery of the aftercoming fetal head not be delayed. If the arm is extended alongside the head, delivery will not occur. If this occurs, the &quot;Løvset manoeuvre&quot; may be employed, or the arm may be manually brought to a position in front of the chest. The Løvset manoeuvre involves rotating the fetal body by holding the fetal pelvis. Twisting the body such that an arm trails behind the shoulder, it will tend to cross down over the face to a position where it can be reached by the obstetrician&#x27;s finger, and brought to a position below the head. A similar rotation in the opposite direction is made to deliver the other arm. In order to present the smallest diameter (9.5 cm) to the pelvis, the baby&#x27;s head must be flexed (chin to chest). If the head is in a deflexed position, the risk of entrapment is increased. Uterine contractions and maternal muscle tone encourage the head to flex.

Oxygen deprivation may occur from either cord prolapse or prolonged compression of the cord during birth, as in head entrapment. If oxygen deprivation is prolonged, it may cause permanent neurological damage (for instance, cerebral palsy) or death. It has been suggested that a fast vaginal delivery would mean the risk of stopping baby&#x27;s oxygen supply is reduced. However, there is not enough research to show this and a quick delivery might cause more harm to the baby than a conservative approach to the birth.

Injury to the brain and skull may occur due to the rapid passage of the baby&#x27;s head through the mother&#x27;s pelvis. This causes rapid decompression of the baby&#x27;s head. In contrast, a baby going through labor in the head-down position usually experiences gradual molding (temporary reshaping of the skull) over the course of a few hours. This sudden compression and decompression in breech birth may cause no problems at all, but it can injure the brain. This injury is more likely in preterm babies. The fetal head may be controlled by a special two-handed grip called the Mauriceau–Smellie–Veit maneuver or the elective application of forceps. This will be of value in controlling the rate of delivery of the head and reducing decompression. Related to potential head trauma, researchers have identified a relationship between breech birth and autism.

Squeezing the baby&#x27;s abdomen can damage internal organs. Positioning the baby incorrectly while using forceps to deliver the after coming head can damage the spine or spinal cord. It is important for the birth attendant to be knowledgeable, skilled, and experienced with all variations of breech birth.

===Factors influencing safety===

* Birth attendant&#x27;s skill (and experience with breech birth) – The skill of the doctor or midwife and the number of breech births previously assisted is of crucial importance. Many of the dangers in vaginal birth for breech babies come from mistakes made by birth attendants. With the majority of breech babies being delivered by cesarean section, there is more risk that birth attendants will lose their skills in delivering breech babies and therefore increase the risk of harm to the baby during vaginal delivery.
* Type of breech presentation – the frank breech has the most favorable outcomes in a vaginal birth, with many studies suggesting no difference in outcome compared to head-down babies. (Some studies, however, find that planned caesarean sections for all breech babies improve outcome. The difference may rest in part on the skill of the doctors who delivered babies in different studies.) Complete breech presentation is the next most favorable position, but these babies sometimes shift and become footling breeches during labour. Footling and kneeling breeches have a higher risk of cord prolapse and head entrapment.
* Parity – Parity refers to the number of times a woman has given birth before. If a woman has given birth vaginally, her pelvis has &quot;proven&quot; it is big enough to allow a baby of that baby&#x27;s size to pass through it. However, a head-down baby&#x27;s head often molds (shifts its shape to fit the maternal pelvis) and so may present a smaller diameter than the same-size baby born breech. 
* Fetal size in relation to maternal pelvic size – If the mother&#x27;s pelvis is roomy and the baby is not large, this is favorable for vaginal breech delivery. However, prenatal estimates of the size of the baby and the size of the pelvis are unreliable.
* Hyperextension of the fetal head – this can be evaluated with ultrasound. Less than 5% of breech babies have their heads in the &quot;star-gazing&quot; position, the face looking straight upwards and the back of the head resting against the back of the neck. Caesarean delivery is absolutely necessary because vaginal birth with the baby&#x27;s head in this position confers a high risk of spinal cord trauma and death.
* Maturity of the baby – Premature babies appear to be at higher risk of complications if delivered vaginally than if delivered by caesarean section.
* Progress of labor – A spontaneous, normally progressing, straightforward labor requiring no intervention is a favorable sign.
* Second twins – If a first twin is born head down and the second twin is breech, the chances are good that the second twin can have a safe breech birth.

==Management==

As in labour with a baby in a normal head-down position, uterine contractions typically occur at regular intervals and gradually the cervix begins to thin and open. In the more common breech presentations, the baby&#x27;s bottom (rather than feet or knees) is what is first to descend through the maternal pelvis and emerge from the vagina.

At the beginning of labour, the baby is generally in an position, facing either the right or left side. The baby&#x27;s bottom is the same size in the term baby as the baby&#x27;s head. Descent is thus as for the presenting fetal head and delay in descent is a cardinal sign of possible problems with the delivery of the head.

In order to begin the birth, a descent of the podalic pole along with compaction and internal rotation needs to occur. This happens when the mother&#x27;s pelvic floor muscles cause the baby to turn so that it can be born with one hip directly in front of the other. At this point, the baby is facing one of the mother&#x27;s inner thighs. Then, the shoulders follow the same path as the hips did. At this time the baby usually turns to face the mother&#x27;s back. Next occurs external rotation, which is when the shoulders emerge as the baby&#x27;s head enters the maternal pelvis. The combination of maternal muscle tone and uterine contractions causes the baby&#x27;s head to flex, chin to chest. Then the back of the baby&#x27;s head emerges and finally the face.

Due to the increased pressure during labour and birth, it is normal for the baby&#x27;s leading hip to be bruised and genitalia to be swollen. Babies who assumed the frank breech position in utero may continue to hold their legs in this position for some days after birth.

===Caesarean or vaginal delivery===
When a baby is born bottom first there is more risk that the birth will not be straightforward and that the baby could be harmed. For example, when the baby&#x27;s head passes through the mother&#x27;s pelvis the umbilical cord can be compressed which prevents delivery of oxygenated blood to the baby. Due to this and other risks, babies in breech position are often born by a planned caesarean section in developed countries.

Caesarean section reduces the risk of harm or death for the baby if the baby is in breech position but does increase the risk of harm to the mother compared with a vaginal delivery. It is best if the baby is in a head-down position so that they can be born vaginally with less risk of harm to both mother and baby. The next section is looking at external cephalic version (ECV), which is a method that can help the baby turn from a breech position to a head-down position.

Vaginal birth of a breech baby has its risks but caesarean sections are not always available or possible, a mother might arrive in the hospital at a late stage of her labour or may choose not to have a caesarean section. In these cases, it is important that the clinical skills needed to deliver breech babies are not lost so that mothers and babies are as safe as possible. Compared with developed countries, planned caesarean sections have not produced as good results in developing countries – it is suggested that this is due to more breech vaginal deliveries being performed by experienced, skilled practitioners in these settings.

== Twin breech ==

In twin pregnancies, it is very common for one or both babies to be in the breech position. Most often twin babies do not have the chance to turn around because they are born prematurely. If both babies are in the breech position and the mother has gone into labour early, a cesarean section may be the best option. About 30–40% of twin pregnancies result in only one baby being in the breech position. If this is the case, the babies can be born vaginally. After the first baby who is not in the breech position is delivered, the baby who is presented in the breech position may turn itself around, if this does not happen another procedure may performed called the breech extraction. The breech extraction is the procedure that involves the obstetrician grabbing the second twin&#x27;s feet and pulling him/her into the birth canal. This will help with delivering the second twin vaginally. However, if the second twin is larger than the first, complications with delivering the second twin vaginally may arise and a cesarean section should be offered. At times, the first twin (the twin closest to the birth canal) can be in the breech position with the second twin being in the cephalic position (vertical). When this occurs, risks of complications are higher than normal. In particular, a serious complication is known as Locked twins. This is when both babies interlock their chins during labour. When this happens an urgent cesarean section is recommended.

==Turning the baby==
Turning the baby, technically known as external cephalic version (ECV), is when the baby is turned by gently pressing the mother&#x27;s abdomen to push the baby from a bottom first position, to a head first position. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to press with more force. ECV does not always work, but it does improve the mother&#x27;s chances of giving birth to her baby vaginally and avoiding a cesarean section. The World Health Organisation recommends that women should have a planned cesarean section only if an ECV has been tried and did not work.

Women who have an ECV when they are 36–40 weeks pregnant are more likely to have a vaginal delivery and less likely to have a cesarean section than those who do not have an ECV. Turning the baby before this time makes a head first birth more likely but ECV before the due date can increase the risk of early or premature birth which can cause problems to the baby.

There are treatments that can be used which might affect the success of an ECV. Drugs called beta-stimulant tocolytics help the woman&#x27;s muscles to relax so that the pressure during the ECV does not have to be so great. Giving the woman these drugs before the ECV improves the chances of her having a vaginal delivery because the baby is more likely to turn and stay head down. Other treatments such as using sound, pain relief drugs such as epidural, increasing the fluid around the baby and increasing the amount of fluids to the woman before the ECV could all effect its success but there is not enough research to make this clear.

=== Mechanism of Labor in Breech Presentation ===
In a breech delivery, the process involves a sequential progression of movements for the buttocks, shoulders, and head to facilitate the baby&#x27;s passage through the birth canal. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of each stage:

==== A. Buttocks ====

# Engagement:
#* The buttocks engage in the oblique diameter of the pelvic inlet.
#* The bitrochanteric diameter (approximately 10 cm) leads during this phase.
# Descent:
#* The buttocks descend until the anterior buttock reaches the pelvic floor.
# Internal Rotation:
#* The anterior buttock rotates to align behind the symphysis pubis.
# Further Descent and Lateral Flexion:
#* The anterior hip passes under the symphysis pubis.
#* This is followed by the posterior hip, enabling the delivery of the trunk and lower limbs.
# Restitution:
#* After delivery, the buttocks return to their original oblique position.

==== B. Shoulders ====

# Engagement:
#* The shoulders engage with the bisacromial diameter (approximately 12 cm) aligning in the same oblique diameter as the buttocks.
# Descent and Internal Rotation:
#* The shoulders rotate into the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic outlet.
#* Simultaneously, the fetal trunk externally rotates.
# Delivery:
#* The posterior shoulder delivers first, followed by the anterior shoulder as the trunk flexes.
# Restitution and External Rotation:
#* The shoulders rotate back to realign the fetal trunk in a dorsoanterior position.

==== C. Head ====

# Engagement:
#* The fetal head engages in either the opposite oblique or transverse diameter.
#* The suboccipitofrontal diameter (approximately 10 cm) leads this phase.
# Descent with Flexion:
#* As the head descends, flexion intensifies.
# Internal Rotation:
#* The occiput rotates anteriorly, positioning itself behind the symphysis pubis.
# Descent and Flexion for Delivery:
#* The subocciput hinges beneath the symphysis pubis.
#* Delivery of the head occurs through flexion, with the chin, mouth, nose, forehead, and occiput emerging sequentially.
# Expulsion:
#* The final expulsion of the head depends on maternal bearing-down efforts rather than uterine contractions.

<text>Haiphong () is the third-largest city in Vietnam and is the principal port city of the Red River Delta.

==History==
The municipality has an area of , consisting of 8 urban districts, 6 rural districts and 1 municipal city (sub-city). Two of the rural districts cover islands in the South China Sea: Bạch Long Vĩ and Cát Hải. It has a population of 2,130,898 in 2023. The city&#x27;s economy has strength in manufacturing, as evident by large industrial parks and numerous smaller traditional handicraft villages. Historically, Haiphong is the first place in Vietnam and Mainland Southeast Asia to get electricity.

In the Annamese imperial era, the Bạch Đằng River in Haiphong was a place of many legendary victories, led by now-legendary commanders Ngô Quyền and Trần Quốc Tuấn. In the 16th century, Mạc dynasty promoted the coastal settlement as a secondary capital, growing to become an important port town of Đàng Ngoài. After the French conquest of Vietnam, in 1888, the president of the French Third Republic, Sadi Carnot, promulgated a decree to establish Haiphong as one of the principal cities of the French Indochina. From 1954 to 1975, Haiphong served as the most important maritime city of the North Vietnam. It was one of directly controlled municipalities of a reunified Vietnam with Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in 1976. In the 21st century, Haiphong is under active land reclamation, the most recent effort being the construction of South Đình Vũ dike in 2022.

Haiphong is a popular seaside vacation spot and known for biological reservations in Cát Bà Island. For its extensive port, the city hosts the headquarter of Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy. Royal poinciana are commonly associated with Haiphong in Vietnamese culture.

===Middle Ages===
Modern-day Haiphong was the home of Lê Chân, one of the female generals under the command of the Trưng Sisters who rose against Chinese domination in 40 AD and ruled until their defeat in 43 AD. Lê Chân was known to have established the &quot;Hải tần Phòng thủ&quot; (“Defenced Sea-coast”) during the war against general Ma Yuan of the Han dynasty. 
Centuries later under the reign of Nguyễn Emperor Tự Đức, the area earned the appellation: Hải-Dương thương-chính quan-phòng (&quot;The trading defensive area of Hải Dương Province&quot;).
By the 19th century, at the end of Tự Đức&#x27;s reign, the Hang Kenh Communal House in what is now the city&#x27;s Le Chan District was made the administrative seat of An Dương District, restoring its regional importance. The area by then had developed into a sizable commercial port.

At the eve of the French conquest in 1881, a typhoon ravaged the area, killing about 3,000 people in and around Haiphong. Despite the damages, Haiphong was developed by the French to serve as Indochina&#x27;s main naval base over the ensuing decades.
===XX century===
Following the defeat of Japan in World War II, Vietnamese nationalists agitated for independence against French return. French forces landed in Haiphong and encountered resistance which resulted in the deaths of three French soldiers. In retaliation, the French ships, among them the cruiser &quot;Suffren&quot;, shelled the city, setting it ablaze and precipitating the First Indochina War. French infantry forces under the command of Jean-Étienne Valluy entered the city, fighting house to house with the support of armored units and airplanes.

Late in the Vietnam War, Haiphong was subjected to heavy bombing by US Navy and Air Force strike aircraft because it was North Vietnam&#x27;s only major port. U.S. Admiral Thomas H. Moorer ordered the mining of Haiphong harbor on 8 May 1972, effectively sealing the port. Until it was lifted, the mining caused no casualty. Despite being targeted, the physical structure of the city was mostly unaffected by the war as the US had a self-imposed prohibition zone for the city. After the war, the city recovered its role as a significant industrial center.
===XXI century===
On 20 February 2025 the Vietnamese parliament approved an $8 billion railroad investment to upgrade under Xi Jinping&#x27;s Belt and road initiative the old French-built Kunming–Haiphong railway, which serves the Chinese border city Hekou Yao, Lao Cai, Hanoi and Haiphong.

Major products include fish sauce, beer, cigarettes, textiles, paper, plastic pipes, cement, iron, pharmaceuticals, electric fans, motorbikes, steel pipes and ships and out-sourcing software implementation. Most of these industries have been growing significantly between 2000 and 2007, with the exceptions of the cigarette and pharmaceutical industries. Shipbuilding, steel pipes, plastic pipes and textiles are among the industries with the most rapid growth.

There are also growing industries supplying products used by existing industries in the city. PetroVietnam set up a joint-venture PVTex with textile manufacturer Vinatex to build Vietnam&#x27;s first polyester fiber plant in Haiphong. The factory will use by-products from oil-refining and reduce reliance on imported materials. 270,600 people were employed in Haiphong&#x27;s industry. 112,600 industrial jobs were created between 2000 and 2007.

==== Agriculture, forestry and fishery ====

Despite its status as a city, around one third of Haiphong&#x27;s area or 52,300 ha (as of 2007) are used for agriculture. Rice is the most important crop, taking up around 80% of the agricultural land with an output of 463,100 tons in 2007. Other agricultural products include maize, sugar and peanuts.

Haiphong has a relatively large fishing sector with an output of 79,705 tons (2007). Gross output has almost doubled between 2000 and 2007, mostly due to fast growth in aquaculture, which made up 60% of gross output in 2007. Despite its coastal location, sea fish contribute relatively little to the sector (around one fourth). Nam Định Province and Thái Bình Province have much larger fishing sectors and even the inland Hải Dương Province has a larger gross output from fishing than Haiphong.

As of 2007, 315,500 were employed in agriculture and fishery, a significant decrease from 396,300 in 2000. However, these sectors still account for almost a third of total employment in Haiphong, a larger share than industry. However, gross output in both agriculture and fishery have been growing significantly between 2000 and 2007.

<doc id="532520" wikidata="Q1131259" url="?curid=532520" title="Copland (operating system)">
<text>Copland is an operating system developed by Apple for Macintosh computers between 1994 and 1996 but never commercially released. It was intended to be released with the name System 8, and later after changing their naming style, Mac OS 8. Planned as a modern successor to the aging System 7, Copland introduced protected memory, preemptive multitasking, and several new underlying operating system features, while retaining compatibility with existing Mac applications. Copland&#x27;s tentatively planned successor, codenamed Gershwin, was intended to add more advanced features such as application-level multithreading.

Development officially began in March 1994. Over the next several years, previews of Copland garnered much press, introducing the Mac audience to operating system concepts such as object orientation, crash-proofing, and multitasking. In August 1995, David Nagel, a senior vice president, announced at Macworld Expo that Copland would be released in mid-1996. The following May, Gil Amelio stated that Copland was the primary focus of the company, aiming for a late-year release. Internally, however, the development effort was beset with problems due to dysfunctional corporate personnel and project management. Development milestones and developer release dates were missed repeatedly.

Ellen Hancock was hired to get the project back on track, but quickly concluded it could never ship. In August 1996, it was announced that Copland was canceled and Apple would look outside the company for a new operating system. Among many choices, they selected NeXTSTEP and purchased NeXT in 1997 to obtain it. In the interim period, while NeXTSTEP was ported to the Mac, Apple released the much more legacy-oriented Mac OS 8 in 1997 based upon adding components from Copland, and Mac OS 9 in 1999 to transition forward. Mac OS X became Apple&#x27;s next-generation operating system in 2001.

The Copland development effort has been described as an example of feature creep. In 2008, &quot;PC World&quot; included Copland on a list of the biggest project failures in information technology (IT) history.

==Design==
===Mac OS legacy===
The prehistory of Copland begins with an understanding of the Mac OS legacy, and its architectural problems to be solved.

Launched in 1984, the Macintosh and its operating system were designed from the start as a single-user, single-tasking system, which allowed the hardware development to be greatly simplified.

These limits meant that supporting the multitasking of more than one program at a time would be difficult, without rewriting all of this operating system and application code. Yet doing so would mean the system would run unacceptably slow on existing hardware. Instead, Apple adopted a system known as MultiFinder in 1987, which keeps the running application in control of the computer, as before, but allows an application to be rapidly switched to another, normally simply by clicking on its window. Programs that are not in the foreground are periodically given short bits of time to run, but as before, the entire process is controlled by the applications, not the operating system.

Because the operating system and applications all share one memory space, it is possible for a bug in any one of them to corrupt the entire operating system, and crash the machine. Under MultiFinder, any crash anywhere will crash all running programs. Running multiple applications potentially increases the chances of a crash, making the system potentially more fragile.

Adding greatly to the severity of the problem is the patching mechanism used to add functions to the operating system, known as CDEVs and INITs or Control Panels and Extensions. Third party developers also make use of this mechanism to add features, including screensavers and a hierarchical Apple menu. Some of these third-party control panels became almost universal, like the popular After Dark screensaver package. Because there was no standard for use of these patches, it is not uncommon for several of these add-ons — including Apple&#x27;s own additions to the OS — to use the same patches, and interfere with each other, leading to more crashing.

===Copland design===
Copland was designed to consist of the Mac OS on top of a microkernel named Nukernel, which would handle basic tasks such as application startup and memory management, leaving all other tasks to a series of semi-special programs known as &quot;servers&quot;. For instance, networking and file services would not be provided by the kernel itself, but by servers that would be sending requests through interapplication communications. The Copland system as a whole consists of the combination of Nukernel, various servers, and a suite of application support libraries to provide implementations of the well-known classic Macintosh programming interface.

Application services are offered through a single program known officially as the Cooperative Program Address Space. Mac programs run much as they do under System 7, as cooperative tasks that use the non-reentrant Toolbox calls. A worst-case scenario is that an application in the CPAS environment crashes, taking down the entire environment with it. This does not result in the system as a whole going down, however, and the Cooperative Program Address Space environment is automatically restarted.
New applications written with Copland in mind, are able to directly communicate with the system servers and thereby gain many advantages in terms of performance and scalability. They can also communicate with the kernel to launch separate applications or threads, which run as separate processes in protected memory, as in most modern operating systems. These separate applications cannot use non-reentrant calls like QuickDraw, however, and thus could have no user interface. Apple suggested that larger programs could place their user interface in a normal Macintosh application, which then start worker threads externally.

Copland is fully PowerPC (PPC) native. System 7 had been ported to the PowerPC with great success; large parts of the system run as PPC code, including both high-level functions, such as most of the user interface toolbox managers, and low-level functions, such as interrupt management. There is enough 68k code left in the system to be run in emulation, and especially user applications, however that the operating system must map some data between the two environments. In particular, every call into the Mac OS requires a mapping between the interrupt systems of the 68k and PPC. Removing these mappings would greatly improve general system performance. At WWDC 1996, engineers claimed that system calls would execute as much as 50% faster.

Copland is also based on the then-recently defined Common Hardware Reference Platform, or CHRP, which standardized the Mac hardware to the point where it could be built by different companies and can run other operating systems (Solaris and AIX were two of many mentioned). This was a common theme at the time; many companies were forming groups to define standardized platforms to offer an alternative to the &quot;Wintel&quot; platform that was rapidly becoming dominant — examples include 88open, Advanced Computing Environment, and the AIM alliance.

The fundamental challenge of Copland&#x27;s development and adoption was getting all of these functions to fit into an ordinary Mac. System 7.5 already uses up about 2.5 megabytes (MB) of RAM, which is a significant portion of the total RAM in most contemporaneous machines. Copland is a hybrid of two systems, as its native foundation also hosts Blue Box with a complete copy of System 7.5. Copland thus uses a Mach-inspired memory management system and relies extensively on shared libraries, with the goal of being about 50% larger than 7.5.

==History==
===Pink and Blue===

In March 1988, technical middle managers at Apple held an offsite meeting to plan the future course of Mac OS development. Ideas were written on index cards; features that seemed simple enough to implement in the short term (like adding color to the user interface) were written on blue cards; longer-term goals—such as preemptive multitasking—were on pink cards; and long-range ideas like an object-oriented file system were on red cards. Development of the ideas contained on the blue and pink cards was to proceed in parallel, and at first, the two projects were known simply as &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;pink&quot;. Apple intended to have the Blue team release an updated version of the existing Macintosh operating system in the 1990–1991 timeframe, and the Pink team to release an all-new OS around 1993.

The Blue team, who came to call themselves the &quot;Blue Meanies&quot; after characters in the film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, delivered what became known as System 7 on May 13, 1991, but the Pink team&#x27;s efforts suffered from second-system effect and its release date continued to slip into the indefinite future. Some of the reason for this can be traced to problems that would become widespread at Apple as time went on; as Pink became delayed, its engineers moved to Blue instead. This left the Pink team constantly struggling for staffing, and suffering from the problems associated with high employee turnover. Management ignored these sorts of technical development issues, leading to continual problems delivering working products.

At this same time, the recently released NeXTSTEP was generating intense interest in the developer world. Features that were originally part of Red were folded into Pink, and the Red project (also known as &quot;Raptor&quot;) was eventually canceled. This problem was also common at Apple during this period; to chase the &quot;next big thing&quot;, middle managers added new features to their projects with little oversight, leading to enormous problems with feature creep. In the case of Pink, development eventually slowed to the point that the project appeared moribund.

===Taligent===

On April 12, 1991, Apple CEO John Sculley performed a secret demonstration of Pink running on a PS/2 Model 70 to a delegation from IBM. Though the system was not fully functional, it resembled System 7 running on a PC. IBM was extremely interested, and over the next few months, the two companies formed an alliance to further development of the system. These efforts became public in early 1992, under the new name &quot;Taligent&quot;. At the time, Sculley summed up his concerns with Apple&#x27;s own ability to ship Pink when he stated &quot;We want to be a major player in the computer industry, not a niche player. The only way to do that is to work with another major player.&quot;

Infighting at the new joint company was legendary, and the problems with Pink within Apple soon appeared to be minor in comparison. Apple employees made T-shirts graphically displaying their prediction that the result would be an IBM-only project. On December 19, 1995, Apple officially pulled out of the project. IBM continued working alone with Taligent, and eventually released its application development portions under the new name &quot;CommonPoint&quot;. This saw little interest and the project disappeared from IBM&#x27;s catalogs within months.

===Business as usual===
While Taligent efforts continued, very little work addressing the structure of the original OS was carried out. Several new projects started during this time, such as the Star Trek project, a port of System 7 and its basic applications to Intel-compatible x86 machines, which reached internal demo status. But as Taligent was still a concern, it was difficult for new OS projects to gain any traction.

Instead, Apple&#x27;s Blue team continued adding new features to the same basic OS. During the early 1990s, Apple released a series of major new packages to the system; among them are QuickDraw GX, Open Transport, OpenDoc, PowerTalk, and many others. Most of these were larger than the original operating system. Problems with stability, which had existed even with small patches, grew along with the size and requirements of these packages, and by the mid-1990s the Mac had a reputation for instability and constant crashing.

As the stability of the operating system collapsed, the ready answer was that Taligent would fix this with all its modern foundation of full reentrance, preemptive multitasking, and protected memory. When the Taligent efforts also collapsed, Apple was left with an aging OS and no designated solutions. By 1994, the press buzz surrounding the upcoming release of Windows 95 started to crescendo, often questioning Apple&#x27;s ability to respond to the challenge it presented. The press turned on the company, often introducing Apple&#x27;s new projects as failures in the making.

===Another try===
Given this pressure, the collapse of Taligent, the growing problems with the existing operating system, after the release of System 7.5 in late 1994, Apple management decided that the decade-old operating system had run its course. A new system that did not have these problems was needed, and soon. Since so much of the existing system would be difficult to rewrite, Apple developed a two-stage approach to the problem.

In the first stage, the existing system would be moved on top of a new kernel-based OS with built-in support for multitasking and protected memory. The existing libraries, like QuickDraw, would take too long to be rewritten for the new system and would not be converted to be reentrant. Instead, a single paravirtualized machine, the Blue Box, keeps applications and legacy code such as QuickDraw in a single memory block so they continue to run as they had in the past. Blue Box runs in a distinct Copland memory space, so crashing legacy applications or extensions within Blue Box cannot crash the entire machine.

In the next stage of the plan, once the new kernel was in place and this basic upgrade was released, development would move on to rewriting the older libraries into new forms that could run directly on the new kernel. At that point, applications would gain some added modern features.

In the musical code-naming pattern where System 7.5 is code-named &quot;Mozart&quot;, this intended successor is named &quot;Copland&quot; after composer Aaron Copland. In turn, its proposed successor system, Gershwin, would complete the process of moving the entire system to the modern platform, but work on Gershwin would never officially begin.

===Development===
The Copland project was first announced by David Nagel in May 1994. Parts of Copland, such as an early version of the new file system, were demonstrated at Apple&#x27;s Worldwide Developers Conference in May 1995. Apple promised that a beta release of Copland would be ready by the end of the year, for final commercial release in early 1996. Gershwin would follow the next year. Throughout the year, Apple released several mock-ups to various magazines showing what the new system would look like, and commented continually that the company was fully committed to this project. By the end of the year, however, no Developer Release had been produced.
As had happened during the development of Pink, developers within Apple soon started abandoning their own projects in order to work on the new system. Middle management and project leaders fought back by claiming that their project was vital to the success of the system, and moving it into the Copland development stream. Thus, it could not be canceled along with their employees being removed to work on some other part of Copland anyway. This process took on momentum across the next year.

Soon the project looked less like a new operating system and more like a huge collection of new technologies; QuickDraw GX, System Object Model (SOM), and OpenDoc became core components of the system, while completely unrelated technologies like a new file management dialog box (the &quot;open dialog&quot;) and &quot;themes&quot; support appeared also. The feature list grew much faster than the features could be completed, a classic case of creeping featuritis. An industry executive noted that &quot;The game is to cut it down to the three or four most compelling features as opposed to having hundreds of nice-to-haves, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s happening.&quot;

As the &quot;package&quot; grew, testing it became increasingly difficult and engineers were commenting as early as 1995 that Apple&#x27;s announced 1996 release date was hopelessly optimistic: &quot;There&#x27;s no way in hell Copland ships next year. I just hope it ships in 1997.&quot;

In mid-1996, information was leaked that Copland would have the ability to run applications written for other operating systems, including Windows NT. Simultaneously allegedly being confirmed by Copland engineers while being authoritatively denied by Copland project management, this feature had supposedly been in development for more than three years. One user claimed to have been told about these plans by members of the Copland development team. Some analysts projected that this ability would increase Apple&#x27;s penetration into the enterprise market, others said it was &quot;game over&quot; and was only a sign of the Mac platform&#x27;s irrelevancy.

===Developer Release===
At WWDC 1996, Apple&#x27;s new CEO, Gil Amelio, used the keynote to talk almost exclusively about Copland, now known as System 8. He repeatedly stated that it was the only focus of Apple engineering and that it would ship to developers in a few months, with a full release planned for late 1996. Very few, if any, demos of the running system were shown at the conference. Instead, various pieces of the technology and user interface that would go into the package (such as a new file management dialog) were demonstrated. Little of the core system&#x27;s technology was demonstrated and the new file system that had been shown a year earlier was absent.

There was one way to actually use the new operating system – by signing up for time in the developer labs. This did not go well:

Several people at the show complained about the microkernel&#x27;s lack of sophistication, notably the lack of symmetric multiprocessing, a feature that would be exceedingly difficult to add to a system due to ship in a few months. After that, Amelio came back on stage and announced that they would be adding that to the feature list.

In August 1996, &quot;Developer Release 0&quot; was sent to a small number of selected partners. Far from demonstrating improved stability, it often crashed after doing nothing at all, and was completely unusable for development. In October, Apple moved the target delivery date to &quot;sometime&quot;, hinting that it might be 1997. One of the groups most surprised by the announcement was Apple&#x27;s own hardware team, who had been waiting for Copland to allow the PowerPC to be natively represented, unburdened of software legacy. Members of Apple&#x27;s software QA team joked that, given current resources and the number of bugs in the system, they could clear the program for shipping sometime around 2030.

===Cancellation===
Later in August 1996, the situation was no better. Amelio complained that Copland was &quot;just a collection of separate pieces, each being worked on by a different team ... that were expected to magically come together somehow.&quot; Hoping to salvage the situation, Amelio hired Ellen Hancock away from National Semiconductor to take over engineering from Ike Nassi and get Copland development back on track.

After a few months on the job, Hancock came to the conclusion that the situation was hopeless; given current development and engineering, she believed Copland would never ship. Instead, she suggested that the various user-facing technologies in Copland be rolled out in a series of staged releases, instead of a single big release. Apple officially canceled Copland in August 1996, The CD envelopes for the developer&#x27;s release had been printed, but the discs had not been mastered.

To address the aging infrastructure underneath these technologies, Amelio suggested looking outside the company for an unrelated new operating system. Candidates considered were Sun&#x27;s Solaris and Windows NT. Hancock reportedly was in favor of going with Solaris, while Amelio preferred Windows. Amelio even reportedly called Bill Gates to discuss the idea, and Gates promised to put Microsoft engineers to work porting QuickDraw to NT.

After lengthy discussions with Be and rumors of a merger with Sun Microsystems, many were surprised at Apple&#x27;s December 1996 announcement that they were purchasing NeXT and bringing Steve Jobs on in an advisory role. Amelio quipped that they &quot;choose Plan A instead of Plan Be.&quot; The project to port NeXTSTEP to the Macintosh platform was named Rhapsody and was to be the core of Apple&#x27;s cross-platform operating system strategy. This would inherit OpenStep&#x27;s existing support for PowerPC, Intel x86, and DEC Alpha CPU architectures, and an implementation of the OpenStep libraries running on Windows NT. This would in effect open the Windows application market to Macintosh developers as they could license the library from Apple for distribution with their product, or depend on an existing installation.

===Legacy===
Following Hancock&#x27;s plan, development continued with System 7.5 receiving integration of several elements of Copland. System 7 was renamed to Mac OS 7 with the release of 7.6, wherein stability and performance were improved. Many Copland features, including the new multithreaded Finder and support for themes (defaulting to Platinum) were integrated into the unreleased beta of Mac OS 7.7, which was instead rebranded and launched as Mac OS 8.

With the return of Jobs, this rebranding to version 8 also allowed Apple to exploit a legal loophole to terminate third-party manufacturers&#x27; licenses to System 7 and effectively shut down the Macintosh clone market. Later, Mac OS 8.1 finally added the new file system and Mac OS 8.6 updated the nanokernel to handle limited support for preemptive tasks. Its interface is Multiprocessing Services 2.x and later, but there is no process separation and the system still uses cooperative multitasking between processes. Even a process that is Multiprocessing Services-aware still has a part that runs in the Blue Box, a task that also runs all single-threaded programs and the only task that can run 68k code.

The Rhapsody project was canceled after several Developer Preview releases, support for running on non-Macintosh platforms was dropped, and it was eventually released as Mac OS X Server 1.0. In 2001 this foundation was coupled to the Carbon library and Aqua user interface to form the modern Mac OS X product. Versions of Mac OS X prior to the Intel release of Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), also use the rootless Blue Box concept in the form of Classic to run applications written for older versions of Mac OS. Several features originally seen in Copland demos, including its advanced Find command, built-in web browser, &quot;piles&quot; of folders, and support for video-conferencing, have reappeared in subsequent releases of Mac OS X as Spotlight, Safari, Stacks, and iChat AV, respectively, although the implementation and user interface for each feature is very different.

<text>In medicine, LDL apheresis is a form of apheresis, resembling dialysis, to eliminate the cholesterol-containing particle low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from the bloodstream.

==Uses==
It is used in diseases featuring high LDL, such as the rare &quot;homozygous&quot; familial hypercholesterolemia, when the &quot;heterozygous&quot; form does not respond to medical treatment, or when the treatment has led to dangerous side-effects (such as rhabdomyolysis).

The procedure takes 2–4 hours and must be repeated every several weeks to keep the LDL levels from accumulation and causing cardiovascular disease.

It is an expensive procedure, limiting its use to severe cases of hyperlipidemia.

==Principles==
LDL apheresis works by leading venous blood through a column containing beads coated with antibodies to apolipoprotein B (the main protein of LDL particles), dextran sulfate cellulose beads, modified polyacrylate beads, or by precipitating LDL with heparin at low pH, double membrane filtration or immunoadsorption utilizing Lp(a)-specific antibodies. In all cases (apart from polyacrylate absorption), plasma is separated from cells by a cell separator.

<doc id="532530" wikidata="Q1338119" url="?curid=532530" title="Freiherr">
<text>&#x27; (; male, abbreviated as ), &#x27; (; his wife, abbreviated as , ) and &#x27; (, his unmarried daughters and maiden aunts) are designations used as titles of nobility in the German-speaking areas of the Holy Roman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and in its various successor states, including Austria, Prussia, Bavaria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, etc. Traditionally, it denotes the titled rank within the nobility above &#x27; ([[knight]]) and&#x27; (nobility without a specific title) and below &#x27; ([[count|count or earl]]). The title superseded the earlier medieval form,&quot;.

It corresponds approximately to the English baron in rank. The Duden orthography of the German language references the French nobility title of &quot;Baron&quot;, deriving from the Latin-Germanic combination &quot;liber baro&quot; (which also means &quot;free lord&quot;), as corresponding to the German &quot;Freiherr&quot;; and that &quot;Baron&quot; is a corresponding salutation for a &quot;Freiherr&quot;.

==&quot;&quot; in the feudal system==
The title &#x27; derives from the historical situation in which an owner held free (allodial) title to his land, as opposed &quot;unmittelbar&quot; (&quot;unintermediated&quot;), or held without any intermediate feudal tenure; or unlike the ordinary baron, who was originally a knight (&#x27;) in vassalage to a higher lord or sovereign, unlike medieval German ministerials, who were bound to provide administrative services for a lord. A &#x27; sometimes exercised hereditary administrative and judicial prerogatives over those resident in his barony instead of the liege lord, who might be the duke (&#x27;) or count (&quot;&quot;).

==&quot;Freiherr&quot; vs. &quot;Baron&quot;==
The German-language title of &quot;&quot; is rendered in English as &quot;Baron&quot;, although the title was derived separately in the two languages.
Even in German, a &quot;&quot; is often styled as and addressed by the more elegant, Latin equivalent &quot;Baron&quot; in social circumstances, although not the official title.

Separately, in the 19th century some families of the Baltic German nobility who had historically carried the title of &#x27; were recognized by the Tsardom of Russia as noble in the form of ukases additionally awarding the equivalent Russian title of &#x27;. When in 1919 privileges to members of dynastic and noble families were abolished by the constitution of the Weimar Republic and hence titles became part of the last name some members of the affected families chose to be officially named &#x27; while others preferred &#x27; to emphasize their Baltic-German heritage. This is why members of the same family can have different official last names.

The original distinction from other barons was that a &quot;&quot;″s landed property was allodial instead of a fief.

Barons who received their title from the Holy Roman Emperor are sometimes known as &quot;Barons of the Holy Roman Empire&quot; (&#x27;), in order to distinguish them from other barons, although the title as such was simply &#x27;. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, &#x27; did not belong to the noble hierarchy of any realm, but by a decision of the Congress of Vienna in 1815, their titles were nonetheless officially recognised. From 1806 the then independent German monarchies, such as Bavaria, Württemberg and Lippe could create their own nobility, including &#x27; (although the Elector of Brandenburg had, as king of the originally exclusively extraterritorial Prussia even before that date, arrogated to himself the prerogative of ennoblement). Some of the older baronial families began to use &quot; in formal contexts to distinguish themselves from the new classes of barons created by monarchs of lesser stature than the Holy Roman Emperors, and this usage is far from obsolete.

==Function==

===Prior to abolition of nobility===
As with most titles and designations within the nobility in the German-speaking areas of Europe, the rank was normally hereditary and would generally be used together with the nobiliary particle of &#x27; or &#x27; (sometimes both: &quot;) before a family name.

The inheritance of titles of nobility in most German-speaking areas was not restricted by primogeniture as is the baronial title in Britain. Hence, the titles applied equally to all male-line descendants of the original grantee in perpetuity: All legitimate sons of a &#x27; shared his title and rank, and could be referred to as &#x27;. The wife of a &#x27; is titled &#x27; (literally &quot;free lady&quot;), and the daughter of a &#x27; is called &#x27; (short for &quot;&quot;). Both titles are translated in English as &quot;Baroness&quot;.

In Prussia and some other countries in northern Europe, the title of Freiherr was, as long as the monarchy existed, usually used &quot;preceding&quot; a person&#x27;s given name (e.g. &#x27;). In Austria-Hungary and Bavaria, however, it would be inserted between the given name and the family name (e.g. &#x27;).

===Since abolition of nobility===
After the First World War, the monarchies were abolished in most German-speaking areas of Europe, and the nobility lost recognition as a legal class in the newly created republics of Germany and Austria.

====In Austria====
The Republic of Austria abolished hereditary noble titles for its citizens by the &#x27; of 3 April 1919 and the corresponding decree of the state government. The public use of such titles was and still is prohibited, and violations could be fined. &#x27;, as an Austrian citizen, therefore lost his title of &#x27; and would simply be named as &#x27; in his Austrian passport.

In practice, however, former noble titles are still used socially in Austria; some people consider it a matter of courtesy to use them. The late , in his childhood Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, was styled &#x27; in his post-1919 Austrian passport, and &#x27; in his German passport (he was a Member of the European Parliament for Germany).

In 2003, the Constitutional Court (&#x27;) ruled that an Austrian woman having been adopted by a German carrying an aristocratic title as part of his name is not allowed to carry this title in her name. The Federal Administrative Court (&#x27;) in a similar case asked the European Court of Justice whether this Austrian regulation would violate the right of the European Union; the European Court of Justice did not object to the Austrian decision not to accept the words &quot; as part of an Austrian woman&#x27;s name.

====In Germany====
The German republic, under Article 109 of the Weimar Constitution of 1919, legally transformed all hereditary noble titles into dependent parts of the legal surname. The former title thus became a part of the family name, and moved in front of the family name. &#x27;, as a German citizen, therefore became &#x27;. As dependent parts of the surnames (&quot;) they are ignored in alphabetical sorting of names, as is a possible nobiliary particle, such as &#x27;, and might or might not be used by those bearing them. Female forms of titles have been legally accepted as a variation in the surname after 1919 by a still valid decision of the former German High Court (&#x27;). The distinguishing main surname is the name, following the Freiherr, Freifrau or Freiin and, where applicable, the nobiliary particle – in the preceding example, the main surname is &quot;&quot; and so alphabetically is listed under &quot;S&quot;.

==Parallel titles==
Similar titles have been seen in parts of Europe that have historically been dominated by Germany (in the cultural sense): the Baltic States, Austria–Hungary, Sweden, Finland and to some extent in Denmark–Norway.

===Swedish and Danish–Norwegian title===
From the Middle Ages onward, each head of a Swedish noble house was entitled to vote in any provincial council when held, as in the Realm&#x27;s &#x27;, later &#x27;. In 1561, King Eric XIV began to grant some noblemen the titles of count (&#x27;) or baron (&#x27;). The family members of a &quot;&quot; were entitled to the same title, which in time became Baron or Baronessa colloquially: thus a person who formally is a now might use the title of &quot;Baron&quot; before his name, and he might also be spoken of as &quot;a baron&quot;.

However, after the change of constitution in 1809, newly created baronships in principle conferred the dignity only in primogeniture. In the now valid Swedish Instrument of Government (1974), the possibility to create nobility is eliminated; and since the beginning of the twenty-first century, noble dignities have passed from the official sphere to the private.

In Denmark and Norway, the title of &#x27; was of equal rank to that of Baron, which has gradually replaced it. It was instituted on 25 May 1671 with Christian V&#x27;s &#x27; privileges. Today only a few Danish noble families use the title of &#x27; and most of those are based in Sweden, where that version of the title is still more commonly used; a Danish &#x27; generally is addressed as &quot;Baron&quot;. The wife of a Danish or Norwegian &#x27; is titled &#x27;, and the daughters are formally addressed as &quot;&quot;. With the first free Constitution of Denmark of 1849 came a complete abolition of the privileges of the nobility. Today titles are only of ceremonial interest in the circles around the monarchy of Denmark.

===Finnish title===
In 1561, the Swedish king Eric XIV conferred the hereditary titles of count and &#x27; (&quot;baron&quot;) on some persons, not all of them nobles. This prerogative was confirmed in the constitutional arrangements of 1625. All family members of &#x27; (baronial) families were entitled to that same title, which in practice, came to mean that they were addressed as &#x27; or &#x27;. The Finnish nobility shares most of its origins with Swedish nobility. In the beginning, they were all without honorific titulature, and known just as &quot;lords&quot;. In subsequent centuries, while Finland remained an autonomous grand duchy, many families were raised in rank as counts, &#x27;s, or as untitled nobles. Theoretically, all created &#x27; families were given a barony (with some rights of taxation and jurisprudence), but such fiefs were only granted in the 16th and 17th centuries. Thereafter the &quot;barony&quot; was titular, usually in chief of some already-owned property, and sometimes that property was established as a &quot;&quot;. Their property tax exemption continued into the 20th century, being, however, diminished substantially by reforms of the 19th century.

<text>Donard Park is a public park located in Newcastle, County Down, Northern Ireland. It is next to the Glen River, which forms the boundary along one side and is at the foot of Slieve Donard, the highest mountain in Northern Ireland, part of the Mourne Mountains. It is owned and run by Down District Council.

== Features ==

The park features football and hockey pitches and picnic facilities. It is also used as a starting point for ramblers to climb the Mourne Mountains and has a YMCA centre including camping facilities. In 2006 the main entrance and car park were redeveloped and facilities upgraded. There are future plans for retail space and rentable accommodation beside the park. The local council have been petitioned to build a swimming pool in the park and had put in a request for a Northern Ireland National Cycling Velodrome Centre to be built there for the 2012 London Olympics. In 2008 local planners indicated they would not back the construction of the scheme in an area of outstanding natural beauty at the foothills of the Mournes. The council is now seeking alternative sites.

== History ==

The park was previously owned by the Annesley family until given over to the people of Newcastle and the local council took responsibility for maintaining it. During World War I members of the 10th Battalion of Royal Irish Rifles were stationed at Donard lodge in the park for training, before being sent to the Somme in France.

During World War II members of the U.S. Army 5th infantry division were based in Donard Park in preparation for D-Day. They arrived in late October 1943.

<text>Gerrit Berveling (born 1 April 1944, Vlaardingen) is a Dutch Esperanto author.

== Biography ==
He studied Classical Languages (Latin and Greek) at Leiden University, and Theology at Utrecht and Leiden Universities.
After 14 years of teaching general history and classical languages, he worked 14 years as a Remonstrant minister in different liberal Christian communities, and now is teaching classical languages again.

In Esperanto he is known as an original Esperanto poet, but mostly as a translator from Latin, Greek and Dutch.
Besides, he is editor of a literary Esperanto revue, &quot;Fonto&quot;, appearing every month in Brazil.

He is one of many Esperantists who have joined the Esperanto Wikipedia. Along with fellow-Wikipedians John C. Wells and Bertilo Wennergren, a notable Esperanto grammarian and the director of the Academy&#x27;s section about Esperanto vocabulary, Berveling is a member of the Academy of Esperanto.

<doc id="532542" wikidata="Q814361" url="?curid=532542" title="Companion matrix">
<text>In linear algebra, the Frobenius companion matrix of the monic polynomial
formula_1
is the square matrix defined as

formula_2

Some authors use the transpose of this matrix, formula_3, which is more convenient for some purposes such as linear recurrence relations (see below).

formula_4 is defined from the coefficients of formula_5, while the characteristic polynomial as well as the minimal polynomial of formula_4 are equal to formula_7. In this sense, the matrix formula_4 and the polynomial formula_5 are &quot;companions&quot;.

==Similarity to companion matrix==
Any matrix with entries in a field has characteristic polynomial formula_10, which in turn has companion matrix formula_4. These matrices are related as follows.

The following statements are equivalent:
* &quot;A&quot; is similar over &quot;F&quot; to formula_4, i.e. &quot;A&quot; can be conjugated to its companion matrix by matrices in GL&quot;n&quot;(&quot;F&quot;);
* the characteristic polynomial formula_13 coincides with the minimal polynomial of &quot;A&quot; , i.e. the minimal polynomial has degree &quot;n&quot;;
* the linear mapping formula_14 makes formula_15 a cyclic formula_16-module, having a basis of the form formula_17; or equivalently formula_18 as formula_16-modules.

If the above hold, one says that &quot;A&quot; is &quot;non-derogatory&quot;.

Not every square matrix is similar to a companion matrix, but every square matrix is similar to a block diagonal matrix made of companion matrices. If we also demand that the polynomial of each diagonal block divides the next one, they are uniquely determined by &quot;A&quot;, and this gives the rational canonical form of &quot;A&quot;. 

==Diagonalizability==
The roots of the characteristic polynomial formula_5 are the eigenvalues of formula_4. If there are &quot;n&quot; distinct eigenvalues formula_22, then formula_4 is diagonalizable as formula_24, where &quot;D&quot; is the diagonal matrix and &quot;V&quot; is the Vandermonde matrix corresponding to the &#x27;s: 
formula_25
Indeed, a reasonably hard computation shows that the transpose formula_3 has eigenvectors formula_27 with formula_28, which follows from formula_29. Thus, its diagonalizing change of basis matrix is formula_30, meaning formula_31, and taking the transpose of both sides gives formula_24.

We can read the eigenvectors of formula_4 with formula_34 from the equation formula_24: they are the column vectors of the inverse Vandermonde matrix formula_36. This matrix is known explicitly, giving the eignevectors formula_37, with coordinates equal to the coefficients of the Lagrange polynomials
formula_38
Alternatively, the scaled eigenvectors formula_39 have simpler coefficients.

If formula_13 has multiple roots, then formula_4 is not diagonalizable. Rather, the Jordan canonical form of formula_4 contains one Jordan block for each distinct root; if the multiplicity of the root is &quot;m&quot;, then the block is an &quot;m&quot; × &quot;m&quot; matrix with formula_43 on the diagonal and 1 in the entries just above the diagonal. in this case, &quot;V&quot; becomes a confluent Vandermonde matrix.

==Linear recursive sequences==
A linear recursive sequence defined by formula_44 for formula_45 has the characteristic polynomial formula_46, whose transpose companion matrix formula_3 generates the sequence:
formula_48
The vector formula_49 is an eigenvector of this matrix, where the eigenvalue formula_50 is a root of formula_5. Setting the initial values of the sequence equal to this vector produces a geometric sequence formula_52 which satisfies the recurrence. In the case of &quot;n&quot; distinct eigenvalues, an arbitrary solution formula_53 can be written as a linear combination of such geometric solutions, and the eigenvalues of largest complex norm give an asymptotic approximation.
==From linear ODE to first-order linear ODE system==

Similarly to the above case of linear recursions, consider a homogeneous linear ODE of order &quot;n&quot; for the scalar function formula_54:
formula_55
This can be equivalently described as a coupled system of homogeneous linear ODE of order 1 for the vector function formula_56:
formula_57
where formula_58 is the transpose companion matrix for the characteristic polynomial
formula_59
Here the coefficients formula_60 may be also functions, not just constants. 

If formula_58 is diagonalizable, then a diagonalizing change of basis will transform this into a decoupled system equivalent to one scalar homogeneous first-order linear ODE in each coordinate.

An inhomogeneous equation
formula_62
is equivalent to the system:
formula_63
with the inhomogeneity term formula_64.

Again, a diagonalizing change of basis will transform this into a decoupled system of scalar inhomogeneous first-order linear ODEs.

== Cyclic shift matrix ==
In the case of formula_65, when the eigenvalues are the complex roots of unity, the companion matrix and its transpose both reduce to Sylvester&#x27;s cyclic shift matrix, a circulant matrix.

== Multiplication map on a simple field extension ==
Consider a polynomial formula_66 with coefficients in a field formula_67, and suppose formula_5 is irreducible in the polynomial ring formula_69. Then adjoining a root formula_50 of formula_5 produces a field extension formula_72, which is also a vector space over formula_67 with standard basis formula_74. Then the formula_67-linear multiplication mapping

has an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix formula_76 with respect to the standard basis. Since formula_77 and formula_78, this is the companion matrix of formula_5:
formula_80
Assuming this extension is separable (for example if formula_67 has characteristic zero or is a finite field), formula_5 has distinct roots formula_83 with formula_84, so that
formula_85
and it has splitting field formula_86. Now formula_87 is not diagonalizable over formula_67; rather, we must extend it to an formula_89-linear map on formula_90, a vector space over formula_89 with standard basis formula_92, containing vectors formula_93. The extended mapping is defined by formula_94. 

The matrix formula_95 is unchanged, but as above, it can be diagonalized by matrices with entries in formula_89: 
formula_97
for the diagonal matrix formula_98 and the Vandermonde matrix &quot;V&quot; corresponding to formula_99. The explicit formula for the eigenvectors (the scaled column vectors of the inverse Vandermonde matrix formula_100) can be written as:
formula_101
where formula_102 are the coefficients of the scaled Lagrange polynomial
formula_103

<text>Venous blood is deoxygenated blood which travels from the peripheral blood vessels, through the venous system into the right atrium of the heart. Deoxygenated blood is then pumped by the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary artery which is divided in two branches, left and right to the left and right lungs respectively. Blood is oxygenated in the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins.

Venous blood is typically colder than arterial blood, and has a lower oxygen content and pH. It also has lower concentrations of glucose and other nutrients and has higher concentrations of urea and other waste products. The difference in the oxygen content of arterial blood and venous blood is known as the arteriovenous oxygen difference.

Most medical laboratory tests are conducted on venous blood, with the exception of arterial blood gas tests. Venous blood is obtained for lab work by venipuncture (also called phlebotomy), or by finger prick for small quantities.

==Color==
The color of human blood ranges from bright red
when oxygenated to a darker red when deoxygenated. It owes its color to hemoglobin, to which oxygen binds. Deoxygenated blood is darker due to the difference in shape of the red blood cell when oxygen binds to haemoglobin in the blood cell (oxygenated) versus does not bind to it (deoxygenated). Though veins might make it appear as such, human blood is never naturally blue. 

The blue appearance of surface veins is caused mostly by the scattering of blue light away from the outside of venous tissue if the vein is at 0.5 mm deep or more. Veins and arteries appear similar when skin is removed and are seen directly.

<text>People&#x27;s Park in Berkeley, California is a parcel of land owned by the University of California, Berkeley. Located east of Telegraph Avenue and bound by Haste and Bowditch Streets and Dwight Way, People&#x27;s Park was a symbol during the radical political activism of the late 1960s. Formerly a park, the site is now under construction for new university student housing and homeless supportive housing.

While the land is owned by the University of California, People&#x27;s Park was de facto established as a public park on April 20, 1969, by local activists. On May 13, University Chancellor Roger W. Heyns announced plans to construct a soccer field on the site, leading to a confrontation two days later between protesters and police on May 15. Known as &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot;, police used tear gas and opened fire on the protesters to quell the riot, resulting notably in the death of James Rector. In 1984, the city of Berkeley declared it a historical and cultural landmark.

In 2018, the university published a plan to build 1,100 new units of student housing and 125 units of supportive housing for homeless people on the site, but a small contingent of activists delayed those plans through opposition including protests, lawsuits, sabotage of construction equipment, and trespassing on the site. The housing plans were backed by the Berkeley City Council, Mayor Jesse Arreguin, Berkeley&#x27;s California Assembly representative Buffy Wicks and California Governor Gavin Newsom, and a majority of UC Berkeley students.

Pending a judgment in a legal challenge to the university&#x27;s housing plan, the park was closed off in early January 2024, when construction workers and police surrounded the park with a 17-foot high wall of shipping containers to prevent trespassing. On June 6, the California Supreme Court unanimously ruled in the university&#x27;s favor, allowing construction to proceed. Consequently, construction officially started on July 22.

==History==

=== Early history ===
In 1956, the Regents of the University of California allocated a plot of land containing residences for future development into student housing, parking, and offices as part of the university&#x27;s long range development plan. At the time, public funds were lacking to buy the land, and the plan was shelved until June 1967, when the university acquired $1.3 million to buy the land through eminent domain. The short-term goal was to create athletic fields with student housing being a longer-range goal.

Bulldozers arrived in February 1968 and began demolition of the residences. However, the university ran out of development funds, leaving the lot only partially cleared of demolition debris and rubble for 14 months.

On April 15, local boilermaker and activist Michael Delacour held a meeting with fellow political activists to discuss transforming the vacant lot into a community park. The idea quickly gained traction, and in the following days, the &quot;Berkeley Barb&quot;, a local underground newspaper, published a call to action for the creation of the park.

On Sunday, April 20, more than 100 people arrived at the site to begin building the park. Local landscape architect Jon Read and many others contributed trees, flowers, shrubs, and sod. Eventually, about 1,000 people became directly involved, with many more donating money and materials.

On May 13, Chancellor Roger W. Heyns notified the media via a press release that the university would build a fence around the property and begin construction.

=== 1969 protests and &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot; ===

In the early morning of Thursday, May 15, 1969, local police cleared the park and arrested three people who refused to leave. University work crews arrived later and erected an tall fence around the site. Beginning at noon, about 3,000 people appeared in Sproul Plaza at nearby UC Berkeley for a rally in favor of the park. The crowd later moved down Telegraph Avenue toward People&#x27;s Park. Arriving in the early afternoon, protesters were met by the remaining 159 Berkeley and university police officers assigned to guard the fenced-off park site. A major confrontation ensued between police and the crowd, which grew to 4,000.

James Rector was watching from the roof of Granma Books when he was shot by police; he died on May 19. A carpenter, Alan Blanchard, was permanently blinded by a load of birdshot directly to his face. At least 128 Berkeley residents were admitted to local hospitals for head trauma, shotgun wounds, and other serious injuries inflicted by police.

That evening, Governor Ronald Reagan declared a state of emergency in Berkeley and sent in 2,700 National Guard troops. Demonstrations continued in Berkeley for several days after Bloody Thursday, and National Guard troops remained stationed there for two weeks.

=== Later history ===

After the march in support of People&#x27;s Park on May 30, 1969, the university decided to keep the 8-foot-tall perimeter chain-link wire fence and maintain a 24-hour guard over the site. On June 20, the University of California Regents voted to turn the People&#x27;s Park site into a soccer field and parking lot, pending construction of apartments within a year. These plans never materialized. Efforts by the university to put in a soccer field in 1971 were met with resistance, with 44 people arrested during the protests. In 1979, protesters tore up a parking lot after the university paved over a part of the park for student parking.

=== Relation to Ohlone Park ===

In the immediate aftermath of the May 1969 demonstrations, and consistent with their goal of &quot;letting a thousand parks bloom,&quot; on May 25, People&#x27;s Park activists began gardening a two-block strip of land called the &quot;Hearst Corridor,&quot; located adjacent to Hearst Avenue just northwest of the university campus. The Hearst Corridor was a strip of land along the north side of Hearst Avenue that had been left largely untended after the houses had been torn down to facilitate the completion of an underground subway line by the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District. Initially slated for apartments, community outreach by a citizen&#x27;s committee in 1974 revealed overwhelming support for the establishment of a public park, and the park was officially dedicated on June 7, 1979.

=== 1991 volleyball court controversy ===
In the spring of 1991, the university released plans to redevelop People&#x27;s Park. They proposed removing the Free Speech Stage and installing several large volleyball courts throughout the park. Bulldozers were ushered in, accompanied by riot police, to install the sand volleyball courts, spurring a new wave of protests.

Protests grew each day, and police escalated to shooting wood pellets and rubber bullets at demonstrators. More than 104 people were arrested&quot;.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; later reported the cost to the university of installing one sand volleyball court to be $150,000, not including costs for security to defend the courts against protesters. The volleyball courts remained until 1997, however, when the university finally removed them from the park.

On August 25, 1992, Rosebud Denovo, who had been arrested or questioned more than a dozen times since 1991, broke into the basement of the residence of UC Berkeley Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien. Officers from the University of California Police Department (UCPD) responded to a silent alarm that had been triggered. Oakland Police Department (OPD) were called to assist. Refusing to surrender when called upon to do so by the responding officers, Denovo fled into the house. OPD police officers, with dogs, entered the house; after a brief encounter, an OPD officer shot and killed Denovo. Denovo was carrying a note demanding an end to the construction in People&#x27;s Park; it read, in part: &quot;We are willing to die for this piece of land. Are you?&quot; Several protests over Denovo&#x27;s death were made in the week following the shooting. Although the Office of the Alameda County District Attorney determined the police had acted appropriately in a report released in October, park activists and street people doubted the use of deadly force was justified.

=== 2000s to 2010s ===
In 2011, People&#x27;s Park saw a new wave of protests, known as the &quot;tree-sit&quot;, consisting of a series of individual &quot;tree-sitters&quot; who occupied a wooden platform in one of the trees in People&#x27;s Park. These protests lasted throughout most of the fall of 2011, only ending when a protester fell out of a tree.

In late 2011, UC Berkeley bulldozed the west end of People&#x27;s Park, in an effort to provide students and the broader community with safer, more sanitary conditions.

People&#x27;s Park has been the subject of long-running contention between those who see it as a haven for the poor that is crime-infested and unfriendly to visitors and families, and those who see it as an essential green space south of campus and a memorial to the Free Speech Movement. While the park has public bathrooms, gardens, and a playground area, many residents do not see it as a welcoming place, citing drug use and a high crime rate. A &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; article on January 13, 2008, referred to People&#x27;s Park as &quot;a forlorn and somewhat menacing hub for drug users and the homeless.&quot; The same article quoted denizens and supporters of the park saying it was &quot;perfectly safe, clean and accessible.&quot; In May 2018, UC Berkeley reported that campus police had been called 1,585 times to People&#x27;s Park in the previous year. The university also said there had been 10,102 criminal incidents in the park between 2012 and 2017. A 2015 investigation by the &quot;Daily Californian&quot; found that most crimes reported at People&#x27;s Park were related to &quot;quality-of-life&quot; such as drug and alcohol violations, and disorderly conduct, and that there were also multiple reports of battery, aggravated theft, robbery and assault at the park.

==Redevelopment and controversy (since 2018)==
In 2018, UC Berkeley unveiled a plan for People&#x27;s Park that would include the construction of housing for as many as 1,000 students, supportive housing for the homeless or military veterans, and a memorial honoring the park&#x27;s history and legacy. On August 29, 2019, Chancellor Carol T. Christ confirmed plans to create student housing for 600–1000 students, and supportive housing for 100–125 people. San Francisco-based LMS architects were selected to build the housing, and Christ stated that the university was moving to a time of &quot;extensive public comment&quot; on the plans for construction.

In February 2020, the university held its first public comment forum. Advocates of the park held a rally to protest the proposal, with students citing the historical, cultural, and social relevance of the park.

On April 17, 2020, UC Berkeley published its plans for the People&#x27;s Park Housing Project during its third virtual open house. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the following shelter-in-place ordinances, the university moving forward with the plan was faced with significant backlash. The mayor of Berkeley, Jesse Arreguín, wrote &quot;I think we should launch this process at a time and in a way that allows full transparency and participation. I therefore reiterate my request that the campus delay the public comment period until after the Shelter in Place order is lifted.&quot;

On April 29, 2020, the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC), planned to vote on re-establishing the nonpartisan housing commission.

=== 2021 occupation ===
In January 2021, UC Berkeley erected fences around portions of People&#x27;s Park to take core samples of the soil composition in preparation for construction. Homeless people who had set up tents in the park during the COVID-19 pandemic were removed from the site by UC police. In response, a rally was organized on January 29. Michael Delacour, one of the founders of the park, gave a speech expressing frustration. Spurred on by his words, hundreds of people broke down construction equipment, tore down the fences, and carried them down Telegraph Avenue. Some were deposited on the front steps of Sproul Hall, the UC Berkeley administration building.
Protesters, including some UC Berkeley students, occupied the park in February 2021 to call for an immediate halt of development plans and evictions of current residents of the park, citing police mistreatment of the homeless&#x27; belongings. A university spokesman said that he was unaware of any reports of police throwing away those belongings.

In a statement issued shortly after the occupation began, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ described building on the park as a &quot;a unique opportunity for a win-win-win-win.&quot;

===National historical recognition===
People&#x27;s Park was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 24, 2022.

===2022 demolition effort===

Just after midnight on August 3, 2022, the UC Berkeley Police Department and contractors began fencing off People&#x27;s Park. Protesters gathered after multiple &quot;bulldozer&quot; alerts were shared when workers began unloading heavy machinery and construction equipment into the park. At about 3 a.m., activists tried to block the movement of machinery into the park by lying on the road, and arrests were made. By noon, 47 trees in People&#x27;s Park were cut down by a local company.

These events were accompanied by a protest at Sproul Plaza on the UC Berkeley campus. Demonstrators marched down Telegraph Avenue and Haste Street, coalescing at the park. By noon, the university decided to withdraw construction crews from the site, citing &quot;destruction of construction materials, unlawful protest activities and violence on the part of some.&quot; Hours later, the university announced that construction work at People&#x27;s Park would be temporarily paused.

On August 4, a special City Council meeting was canceled by Mayor Jesse Arreguín. The meeting was scheduled a day after confrontations with law enforcement occurred, in order to discuss lifting Berkeley&#x27;s ban on the use of tear gas and pepper spray by police. The June 2020 ban was put in place by a unanimous vote, with Arreguín saying at the time that tear gas &quot;is banned in warfare and should not be used on our streets or in protests.&quot; The mayor said he initially called for the August 4 meeting following the protests at People&#x27;s Park, but later said that he &quot;came to the conclusion that it was the wrong approach and that the ban on tear gas should remain.&quot; The mayor stated that he supports the university&#x27;s housing project, but said that &quot;it’s understandable that people are very concerned and upset about the construction at the park&quot; and that there is a need to &quot;make sure that people can protest peacefully, and make sure we are protecting the safety of the broader community at the same time.&quot;

On August 5, the California First District Court of Appeal upheld a stay on construction, demolition and tree-cutting, temporarily pausing further development work at People&#x27;s Park until the legal issue was resolved. The university, however, retained and enforced its legal right to fence the perimeter of the park.

===2024 fencing===

On January 4, 2024, shortly after midnight, UC Berkeley fenced the park with double-stacked cargo containers in an action that involved at least 100 police officers from UCPD, Cal State campus police, California Highway Patrol, and the Alameda County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. About 60 protesters occupied the park during the overnight operation until forced to leave by police, which led to seven arrests. The university was not allowed to start construction on its proposed development due to the ongoing court case, but took measures to secure the perimeter of the lot, as several large trees were also chopped down.

On the previous night, park advocates had held an overnight vigil to defend against rumored fencing, expressing concern that UC Berkeley&#x27;s winter break meant that many students were not around. In a press release, UC Berkeley stated that the park was being closed to &quot;minimize disruption for the city of Berkeley and campus communities&quot;.

=== 2024 California Supreme Court decision ===
On June 6, 2024, the California Supreme Court unanimously sided with the university in an appeal to begin construction on the site. UC Berkeley announced after the ruling that it would be preparing a plan to start construction of student housing at the site, and subsequently began on July 22.

<text>Keith Chegwin (17 January 1957 – 11 December 2017), also known by the nickname Cheggers, was an English television presenter and actor, appearing in several children&#x27;s entertainment shows in the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Multi-Coloured Swap Shop&quot; and &quot;Cheggers Plays Pop&quot;.

Chegwin&#x27;s early career saw him performing in such West End stage shows as &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; and &quot;Captain Pugwash&quot;. He also had a career as a singer, releasing singles on the Pye Records label and worked as a disc jockey for 194 Radio City in Liverpool. He spent four years at BBC Radio 1 on Tony Blackburn&#x27;s weekend morning show. In 2000, he presented the Channel 5 nudist game-show &quot;Naked Jungle&quot;, appearing naked except for a hat and later describing it as &quot;the worst career move&quot; in his life.

Chegwin was known for his off-the-cuff ad-lib style of broadcasting and stated that no one had ever written a word for him. In 2012, he was scheduled to take part in the sixth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, but he was forced to withdraw after breaking three ribs and fracturing his shoulder on the first day of training. In 2015, he was a housemate on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; series 15 where he finished in fourth place.

Chegwin died on 11 December 2017 of the lung disease idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

==Early life==
Chegwin was born in Walton, Liverpool, on 17 January 1957. His elder sister was future DJ Janice Long (1955–2021). He also had a twin brother, Jeff, with whom he attended stage school and whose son, Hugo Chegwin, co-created and starred in BBC Three mockumentary sitcom &quot;People Just Do Nothing&quot;. 

Chegwin entered an end-of-the-pier talent competition in Rhyl, North Wales, and later joined &#x27;The Happy Wanderers&#x27;, a concert party that toured the pubs and clubs of the North West. He was then spotted by June Collins (mother of Phil Collins) of the Barbara Speake Stage School on &quot;Junior Showtime&quot;, a Yorkshire Television children&#x27;s talent series. She invited him to London to audition for the stage show &quot;Mame&quot; with Ginger Rogers. He attended stage school with his twin brother, Jeff. As part of a play he performed in at the school, Chegwin sang the first song that Phil Collins ever wrote.

==Early career==
While at school, Chegwin auditioned and gained roles on TV, film and stage. He appeared in Children&#x27;s Film Foundation productions, including as Egghead Wentworth in &quot;The Troublesome Double&quot; (1967) and &quot;Egghead&#x27;s Robot&quot; (1970). His most prestigious acting role was that of Fleance in Roman Polanski&#x27;s film &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1971); he also had a small role in the film &quot;The Optimists of Nine Elms&quot; (1973).

In 1973 Chegwin appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;Open All Hours&quot;. After that he had parts in &quot;The Liver Birds&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Black Beauty&quot;, &quot;My Old Man&quot;, &quot;Village Hall&quot;, &quot;Z-Cars&quot; (both 1974), ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Wackers&quot; and &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; serial &quot;Worlds Away&quot; (both 1975).

Chegwin&#x27;s last major acting role was the title role in the film &quot;Robin Hood Junior&quot; (1975), although he had two small roles with Tom Courtenay in the &quot;Chester Mystery Cycle&quot; (1976) and some years later in the film &quot;Whatever Happened to Harold Smith?&quot; (1999). He appeared in TV ads for products such as Pepsi and Cadbury Creme Eggs as well as for Ready Brek, Toffo and Tizer, and was also associated with the Freemans catalogue.

Chegwin performed in West End stage shows such as &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; with Russell Grant and Simon Le Bon; &quot;The Good Old Bad Old Days&quot; with Anthony Newley; and &quot;Captain Pugwash&quot; by John Kennett at the King&#x27;s Road Theatre in 1973. He had a career as a singer, releasing singles on the Cherub and Pye record labels, such as &#x27;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&#x27; (1977), but turned down an offer to front the band Kenny (who had a number 3 hit in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;The Bump&quot;). He also worked as a disc jockey for 194 Radio City in Liverpool, and worked at BBC Radio 1 on Tony Blackburn&#x27;s weekend morning show for four years.

==Presenting and later career==

In the mid-1970s, Chegwin moved away from acting, becoming a household name presenting programmes such as &quot;Multi-Coloured Swap Shop&quot; (1976–82), &quot;Cheggers Plays Pop&quot; (1978–86) and, in the 1980s, &quot;Saturday Superstore&quot;. As Brown Sauce, he and &quot;Swap Shop&quot; co-presenters Noel Edmonds and Maggie Philbin released the pop single &quot;I Wanna Be a Winner&quot;, which reached number 15 in January 1982, and a follow-up single as the Saucers called &quot;Spring Has Sprung&quot;. On &quot;Swap Shop&quot; and &quot;Superstore&quot;, he was featured in outside broadcasts; on &quot;Swap Shop&quot; they were called Swaparama, appearing at outdoor venues around Britain, where he helped children swap their toys. On &quot;Superstore&quot;, Chegwin had a similar role.

Chegwin was known for his off-the-cuff ad-lib style of broadcasting. He stated that no-one had ever written a word for him. Chegwin&#x27;s career waned in the late 1980s and 1990s, due to his alcoholism, as detailed, in his own words, in his semi-autobiographical book, &quot;Shaken But Not Stirred&quot;. From 1989 to 1991, he hosted the live nightly Sky talent programme &quot;Sky Star Search&quot;. Chegwin stopped drinking after his appearance on the Richard and Judy show &quot;This Morning&quot; on 5 November 1992. Chegwin&#x27;s career regained speed in 1993 when he presented the &quot;Down Your Doorstep&quot; outside broadcast segment on &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; and subsequently hosted the show from 1995 to 1996. Chegwin also presented a short-lived cookery show called &quot;The Heat is On&quot; for UK Living in 1997. Only 1 series of the show was produced and was not renewed for further series. Chegwin went on to present a revived version of the 1970s gameshow &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot; on Channel 5 from 1999 to 2000. He also toured the country hosting Graham Fisher&#x27;s International Knockout for corporate and charity events.

In 2000 Chegwin presented his own internet TV show, where his daily audience for the seven-week trial reached over 250,000. Chegwin presented the Yorkshire Television-made Channel 5 nudist gameshow &quot;Naked Jungle&quot;, appearing naked except for a hat. He identified making the show as &quot;the worst career move&quot; in his life.

Chegwin worked for seven years on GMTV. In 2006 he appeared as himself in an episode of Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Extras&quot;. Chegwin frequently wrote jingles for the &quot;Chris Moyles Breakfast Show&quot; on BBC Radio 1. For seven years he ran his own web-based bingo site &quot;Cheggersbingo&quot;.

In 2007 Chegwin voiced and starred in the quiz-based video game Cheggers Party Quiz, in which a CGI version of himself acts as a quizmaster. The game was developed by Oxygen Interactive and released on Nintendo Wii, PlayStation 2 and PC. The game was met with mixed reviews.

In November 2011 Chegwin played himself in the comedy horror film &quot;Kill Keith&quot;. He made an appearance in Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot; with Shaun Williamson and Les Dennis. In August 2012, he was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the National Reality TV Awards.

Chegwin was originally set to take part in the seventh series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, but he was forced to withdraw after breaking three ribs and fracturing his shoulder on the first day of training with Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean. Chegwin joined the eighth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; partnered with Olga Sharutenko. Chegwin was eliminated on 17 February 2013. From October 2013 to January 2014, he played the part of Drosselmeyer in the &#x27;Nutcracker On Ice&#x27; with Imperial Ice Stars from Russia at the London Palladium.

On 19 October 2013 Chegwin took part in a celebrity episode of &quot;The Chase&quot;. In September 2014 he was a contestant on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot; show.

In 2015 Chegwin took part in the fifteenth series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; on Channel 5. On 6 February, he finished in fourth place. He took part in the 2015 series of &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;, won by Kimberly Wyatt of the Pussycat Dolls. In the same year he made a cameo appearance as himself in BBC Two&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;A Gert Lush Christmas&quot; where he is revealed to be a friend of Tony (Greg Davies). He also hosted the 2015 BAFTA television and film industry awards.

In later years Chegwin was a popular pantomime dame and in March 2016 appeared in the Easter pantomime tour of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

==Personal life==
From 1982 to 1993, Chegwin was married to presenter Maggie Philbin with whom he had a daughter. He later married Maria Anne Fielden and they had a son.

Chegwin regularly made public appearances around the UK and was involved in charity work.

Chegwin and his wife lived in Ashmansworth, Hampshire but moved to a country home in the area of Shropshire between Whitchurch and Wem, partly because they wanted to be closer to family further north.

==Death==
In a 2001 interview, Chegwin said he smoked 60 cigarettes a day and was a recovering alcoholic. He died at his home in Shropshire on 11 December 2017, having been ill with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic lung disease, for an extended period. He was 60 years old.

<text>In medicine, some blood tests are conducted on capillary blood obtained by fingerstick (or fingerprick) (or, for neonates, by an analogous heelprick). The site, free of surface arterial flow, where the blood is to be collected is sterilized with a topical germicide, and the skin pierced with a sterile lancet. After a droplet has formed, capillary blood is captured in a capillary tube (usually relying on surface tension). Blood cells drawn from fingersticks have a tendency to undergo hemolysis, especially if the finger is &quot;milked&quot; to obtain more blood.
== Uses ==
Tests commonly conducted on the capillary blood collected are:
* Blood gas test – Fingerstick testing may be used for measuring blood gas tension values, blood pH, and the level and base excess of bicarbonate.
* Glucose levels – Diabetics often have a portable blood meter to check on their blood sugar.
* Lipid profile – Fingerstick testing may be used to find abnormalities in blood lipid (such as cholesterol and triglycerides) concentrations.
* Mononucleosis – Fingerstick testing can be used to test for mononucleosis.
* Hemoglobin levels – Fingerstick testing of hemoglobin is a quick screening procedure to ensure a blood or plasma donor has an acceptably high blood count for donating blood or blood components.
* Genetic testing – Heelprick testing of a newborn&#x27;s DNA allows for early diagnosis and mitigation of common hereditary disorders.
* CBC
* Prothrombin time

Fingersticks are routine for adults, but are generally performed on children and the elderly only if a small amount of blood suffices for needed tests. Neonates are given heelpricks instead, as this is less likely to cause permanent damage.

<text>The Miles M.14 Magister is a two-seat monoplane basic trainer aircraft designed and built by the British aircraft manufacturer Miles Aircraft. It was affectionately known as the &quot;Maggie&quot;. It was authorised to perform aerobatics.

The Magister was developed during the 1930s to Specification T.40/36, itself based on the existing Miles Hawk Trainer which had been ordered in small numbers. The first prototype&#x27;s maiden flight was on 20 March 1937. It quickly became praised for its handling qualities, and was ordered into quantity production.

Entering service barely a year before the start of the Second World War, the Magister became a key training aircraft. It was the first monoplane designed as a trainer to be used by the Royal Air Force (RAF). During the war it was purchased in large numbers for the RAF, the Fleet Air Arm and various overseas military operators. It proved an ideal introduction to the Spitfire and Hurricane for new pilots.

After the war surplus Magisters were exported in large numbers, with many converted for civilian use.

==Development==
===Background===
The origin of the Miles Magister was a decision made by the company&#x27;s management in 1936 to further develop its military trainer range; this decision was influenced by the firm&#x27;s recent success with the Miles M.2 Hawk Trainer as an elementary trainer, the first low-wing monoplane to be adopted as a trainer by the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was decided to produce a derivative of the Hawk Trainer to satisfy the Air Ministry&#x27;s Specification T.40/36. The submission ignored the policy of only procuring metal aircraft which the RAF had at the time.

The new type was broadly similar to the Hawk Trainer: the majority of the differences between the two pertained to the cockpit, which was enlarged and had numerous new features to better meet military training requirements. The first prototype made its maiden flight on 20 March 1937, flown by F.G. Miles. During the following month, the aircraft was named the &quot;Magister&quot;. During early flights the aircraft exhibited a tendency to spin; this problem was solved by several modifications, including elevating the tailplane by , the fitting of anti-spin strakes to the rear fuselage and the adoption of a taller rudder. The alterations worked so well that the Magister became the first low-wing cantilever monoplane to be authorised by the Air Ministry to perform aerobatics.

===Design===
The Magister is a low wing cantilever monoplane whose design is derived from Miles&#x27; Hawk Trainer. Noticeable differences include the significant enlargement of the cockpit, since a more spacious cockpit was required to reasonably accommodate the presence of parachutes and various training aids, including the provision of blind-flying apparatus. The open cockpits have windscreens made of Perspex; baggage and unused equipment can be stored in a sizable bay aft of the rear cockpit via an exterior door. Pilots are required to enter and exit the aircraft via a wingroot walkway on the starboard side.

The Magister is largely built of wood, the fuselage consisting of a spruce structure with a plywood covering; similar materials were used for the three-piece wing and the tail unit. The wing centre section has no dihedral and is of constant section with outer sections having dihedral and tapering towards the tip. It has split flaps as standard; it was the first RAF trainer to have flaps. It has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage with drag-reducing spats on the main wheels; to reduce the landing distance, the undercarriage was fitted with Bendix drum brakes. Power is provided by a 130 hp de Havilland Gipsy Major engine and the fuel is contained in a pair of tanks in the centre section.

The flying characteristics and performance of the Magister lent themselves well to the trainer role; the Magister possessed superior performance to any contemporary elementary trainer. It readily enabled trainee pilots to safely learn the handling techniques of modern frontline fighter aircraft. Its ease of handling and safety were attributes that were vigorously demonstrated by Frederick Miles performing stunts such as hands-free landings and formation flying while inverted. The flight controls are cable-actuated; some of the controls, such as the rudder pedals, can be adjusted to suit the individual pilot.

===Into production===
Having been impressed by the prototype&#x27;s performance during trials, the Air Ministry selected the Magister to fulfil the specification. Production began in October 1937. Recognising the importance and value represented by the order, the company committed a significant portion of its manufacturing capacity to producing the type, abandoning its plans to produce other aircraft, such as the Miles Peregrine, to concentrate resources on the mass production effort.

Production of the Magister continued until 1941, by which time 1,203 aircraft had been built by Miles. More than a hundred Magisters were licence built in Turkey. Contemporary glues used to assemble the wooden aircraft have not stood the test of time and few Magisters have survived.

==Operational history==
Initially, production Magisters were supplied to flying clubs operated by the Straight Corporation, as well as to several overseas government customers. By the Second World War, in excess of 700 Magisters had entered service with RAF Elementary Flying Training Schools; the type would eventually equip 16 such schools as well as the Central Flying School. The bulk of civilian-owned Hawk Majors were also pressed into military service as trainers alongside the type.

During June 1940, as part of British anti-invasion preparations, roughly 15 Magisters were fitted with bomb racks for the carriage of up to eight bombs, to fly as a light bombers under a scheme called Operation Banquet. The preparations were never put into effect and the type never saw active combat use in this capacity.

The Magister also participated in experimental wartime research, such as to evaluate a long range ground attack platform during 1941. Seeking to increase the payloads of conventional medium bombers, British military planners suggested the use of a so-called &#x27;auxiliary wing&#x27; that could be towed like a glider behind a bomber; this wing would be loaded with either additional fuel or munitions. To test this concept, a modified Magister was produced; by the time testing had reached an advanced stage, the RAF had significantly bolstered its offensive forces with heavy bombers, removing the need to deploy the auxiliary wing concept. Other aircraft received experimental modifications to evaluate new equipment or aerodynamic features.

Following the end of the conflict, large numbers of Magisters were disposed of, leading to many being converted for civilian use. Such aircraft were renamed the &quot;Hawk Trainer III&quot;. Amongst its civil uses was air racing; during the 1950 Kings Cup Air Race alone, eight Hawk Trainer IIIs were entered, one of which (a modified cabin version &quot;G-AKRV&quot;), piloted by E. Day, was awarded first place, having achieved a recorded speed of 138.5 mph while doing so. At least two other aircraft were thus modified.

During the postwar years, many Magisters were exported to overseas customers, including private pilot owners and flying clubs. Countries that purchased the type included Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Egypt, France, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Lebanon, Morocco, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Thailand and Tunisia.

==Surviving aircraft==
By 2009, ten Hawk Trainer IIIs were registered in the United Kingdom, of which several were airworthy. Furthermore, several ex-service Magisters have been preserved and on display – including an ex-RAF example at the Imperial War Museum in the UK, and an ex-Irish Air Corps example at the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin.

One Miles Magister was restored to airworthy in the Aeroclub of San Martín, Mendoza, Argentina. Since 2019, this aircraft has been under Czech ownership and is operated by R.A.F. Station Czechoslovakia at Podhořany airport, in the Pardubice region of the Czech Republic.

<doc id="532570" wikidata="Q111140" url="?curid=532570" title="Endothelium">
<text>The endothelium (: endothelia) is a single layer of squamous endothelial cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. The endothelium forms an interface between circulating blood or lymph in the lumen and the rest of the vessel wall.

Endothelial cells in direct contact with blood are called vascular endothelial cells whereas those in direct contact with lymph are known as lymphatic endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial cells line the entire circulatory system, from the heart to the smallest capillaries.

These cells have unique functions that include fluid filtration, such as in the glomerulus of the kidney, blood vessel tone, hemostasis, neutrophil recruitment, and hormone trafficking. Endothelium of the interior surfaces of the heart chambers is called endocardium. An impaired function can lead to serious health issues throughout the body.

== Structure ==
The endothelium is a thin layer of single flat (squamous) cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels.

Endothelium is of mesodermal origin. Both blood and lymphatic capillaries are composed of a single layer of endothelial cells called a monolayer. In straight sections of a blood vessel, vascular endothelial cells typically align and elongate in the direction of fluid flow.

=== Terminology ===
The foundational model of anatomy, an index of terms used to describe anatomical structures, makes a distinction between endothelial cells and epithelial cells on the basis of which tissues they develop from, and states that the presence of vimentin rather than keratin filaments separates these from epithelial cells. Many considered the endothelium a specialized epithelial tissue.

== Function ==
The endothelium forms an interface between circulating blood or lymph in the lumen and the rest of the vessel wall. This forms a barrier between vessels and tissues and control the flow of substances and fluid into and out of a tissue. This controls the passage of materials and the transit of white blood cells into and out of the bloodstream. Excessive or prolonged increases in permeability of the endothelium, as in cases of chronic inflammation, may lead to tissue swelling (edema). Altered barrier function is also implicated in cancer extravasation.

Endothelial cells are involved in many other aspects of vessel function, including:
* Blood clotting (thrombosis and fibrinolysis). Under normal conditions, the endothelium provides a surface on which blood does not clot, because it contains and expresses substances that prevent clotting, including heparan sulfate which acts as a cofactor for activating antithrombin, a protein that inactivates several factors in the coagulation cascade.
* Inflammation. Endothelial cells actively signal to white blood cells of the immune system during inflammation
* Formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).
* Constriction and enlargement of the blood vessel, called vasoconstriction and vasodilation, and hence the control of blood pressure

===Blood vessel formation===
The endothelium is involved in the formation of new blood vessels, called angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a crucial process for development of organs in the embryo and fetus, as well as repair of damaged areas. The process is triggered by decreased tissue oxygen (hypoxia) or insufficient oxygen tension leading to the new development of blood vessels lined with endothelial cells. Angiogenesis is regulated by signals that promote and decrease the process. These pro- and antiangiogenic signals including integrins, chemokines, angiopoietins, oxygen sensing agents, junctional molecules and endogenous inhibitors. Angiopoietin-2 works with VEGF to facilitate cell proliferation and migration of endothelial cells.

The general outline of angiogenesis is
* activating signals binding to surface receptors of vascular endothelial cells.
* activated endothelial cells release proteases leading to the degradation of the basement membrane
* endothelial cells are freed to migrate from the existing blood vessels and begin to proliferate to form extensions towards the source of the angiogenic stimulus.

=== Host immune response ===
Endothelial cells express a variety of immune genes in an organ-specific manner. These genes include critical immune mediators and proteins that facilitate cellular communication with hematopoietic immune cells. Endothelial cells encode important features of the structural cell immune response in the epigenome and can therefore respond swiftly to immunological challenges. The contribution to host immunity by non-hematopoietic cells, such as endothelium, is called “structural immunity”.

==Clinical significance==

Endothelial dysfunction, or the loss of proper endothelial function, is a hallmark for vascular diseases, and is often regarded as a key early event in the development of atherosclerosis. Impaired endothelial function, causing hypertension and thrombosis, is often seen in patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as in smokers. Endothelial dysfunction has also been shown to be predictive of future adverse cardiovascular events including stroke, heart disease, and is also present in inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Endothelial dysfunction is a result of changes in endothelial function. After fat (lipid) accumulation and when stimulated by inflammation, endothelial cells become activated, which is characterized by the expression of molecules such as E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which stimulate the adhesion of immune cells. Additionally, transcription factors, which are substances which act to increase the production of proteins within cells, become activated; specifically AP-1 and NF-κB, leading to increased expression of cytokines such as IL-1, TNFα and IFNγ, which promotes inflammation. This state of endothelial cells promotes accumulation of lipids and lipoproteins in the intima, leading to atherosclerosis, and the subsequent recruitment of white blood cells and platelets, as well as proliferation of smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation of a fatty streak. The lesions formed in the intima, and persistent inflammation lead to desquamation of endothelium, which disrupts the endothelial barrier, leading to injury and consequent dysfunction. In contrast, inflammatory stimuli also activate NF-κB-induced expression of the deubiquitinase A20 (TNFAIP3), which has been shown to intrinsically repair the endothelial barrier.

One of the main mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction is the diminishing of nitric oxide, often due to high levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine, which interfere with the normal L-arginine-stimulated nitric oxide synthesis and so leads to hypertension. The most prevailing mechanism of endothelial dysfunction is an increase in reactive oxygen species, which can impair nitric oxide production and activity via several mechanisms. The signalling protein ERK5 is essential for maintaining normal endothelial cell function. A further consequence of damage to the endothelium is the release of pathological quantities of von Willebrand factor, which promote platelet aggregation and adhesion to the subendothelium, and thus the formation of potentially fatal thrombi.

Angiosarcoma is cancer of the endothelium and is rare with only 300 cases per year in the US. However it generally has poor prognosis with a five-year survival rate of 35%.

=== Research ===

=== Endothelium in cancer ===
It has been recognised that endothelial cells building tumour vasculature have distinct morphological characteristics, different origin compared to physiological endothelium, and distinct molecular signature, which gives an opportunity for implementation of new biomarkers of tumour angiogenesis and could provide new anti-angiogenic druggable targets.

===Endothelium in diet===

A healthy diet abundant in fruits and vegetables has a beneficial impact on endothelial function, whilst a diet high in red and processed meats, fried foods, refined grains and processed sugar increases adhesion endothelial cells and atherogenic promoters. High-fat diets adversely affect the endothelial function.

A Mediterranean diet has been found to improve endothelial function in adults which can reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. Walnut consumption improves endothelial function.

=== Endothelium in Covid-19 ===
In April 2020, the presence of viral elements in endothelial cells of 3 patients who had died of COVID-19 was reported for the first time. The researchers from the University of Zurich and Harvard Medical School considered these findings to be a sign of a general endotheliitis in different organs, an inflammatory response of the endothelium to the infection that can lead or at least contribute to multi-organ failure in Covid-19 patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

==History==
In 1865, the Swiss anatomist Wilhelm His Sr. first coined the term “endothelium”. In 1958, A. S. Todd of the University of St Andrews demonstrated that endothelium in human blood vessels have fibrinolytic activity.

<doc id="532573" wikidata="Q1916324" url="?curid=532573" title="Azimuthal quantum number">
<text>In quantum mechanics, the azimuthal quantum number is a quantum number for an atomic orbital that determines its orbital angular momentum and describes aspects of the angular shape of the orbital. The azimuthal quantum number is the second of a set of quantum numbers that describe the unique quantum state of an electron (the others being the principal quantum number , the magnetic quantum number , and the spin quantum number ).

For a given value of the principal quantum number (&quot;electron shell&quot;), the possible values of are the integers from 0 to . For instance, the  shell has only orbitals with formula_1, and the  shell has only orbitals with formula_1, and formula_3.

For a given value of the azimuthal quantum number , the possible values of the magnetic quantum number are the integers from to , including 0. In addition, the spin quantum number can take two distinct values. The set of orbitals associated with a particular value of  are sometimes collectively called a &quot;subshell&quot;.

While originally used just for isolated atoms, atomic-like orbitals play a key role in the configuration of electrons in compounds including gases, liquids and solids. The quantum number plays an important role here via the connection to the angular dependence of the spherical harmonics for the different orbitals around each atom.

== Nomenclature ==
The term &quot;azimuthal quantum number&quot; was introduced by Arnold Sommerfeld in 1915 as part of an ad hoc description of the energy structure of atomic spectra. Only later with the quantum model of the atom was it understood that this number, , arises from quantization of orbital angular momentum. Some textbooks and the ISO standard 80000-10:2019 call the orbital angular momentum quantum number.

The energy levels of an atom in an external magnetic field depend upon the value so it is sometimes called the magnetic quantum number.

The lowercase letter , is used to denote the orbital angular momentum of a single particle. For a system with multiple particles, the capital letter is used.

== Relation to atomic orbitals ==
There are four quantum numbers&quot;n&quot;, &quot;ℓ&quot;, &quot;m&quot;&quot;ℓ&quot;, &quot;m&quot;&quot;s&quot; connected with the energy states of an isolated atom&#x27;s electrons. These four numbers specify the unique and complete quantum state of any single electron in the atom, and they combine to compose the electron&#x27;s wavefunction, or &quot;orbital&quot;.

When solving to obtain the wave function, the Schrödinger equation resolves into three equations that lead to the first three quantum numbers, meaning that the three equations are interrelated. The &quot;azimuthal quantum number&quot; arises in solving the polar part of the wave equationrelying on the spherical coordinate system, which generally works best with models having sufficient aspects of spherical symmetry.

An electron&#x27;s angular momentum, , is related to its quantum number by the following equation:
formula_4
where is the reduced Planck constant, is the orbital &quot;angular momentum operator&quot; and formula_5 is the wavefunction of the electron. The quantum number is always a non-negative integer: 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. (Notably, has no real meaning except in its use as the angular momentum operator; thus, it is standard practice to use the quantum number when referring to angular momentum).

Atomic orbitals have distinctive shapes, (see top graphic) in which letters, s, p, d, f, etc., (employing a convention originating in spectroscopy) denote the shape of the atomic orbital. The wavefunctions of these orbitals take the form of spherical harmonics, and so are described by Legendre polynomials. The several orbitals relating to the different (integer) values of &quot;ℓ&quot; are sometimes called sub-shellsreferred to by lowercase Latin letters chosen for historical reasonsas shown in the table &quot;Quantum subshells for the azimuthal quantum number&quot;.

Each of the different angular momentum states can take 2(2&quot;ℓ&quot; + 1) electrons. This is because the third quantum number &quot;m&quot;ℓ (which can be thought of loosely as the quantized projection of the angular momentum vector on the z-axis) runs from −&quot;ℓ&quot; to &quot;ℓ&quot; in integer units, and so there are 2&quot;ℓ&quot; + 1 possible states. Each distinct &quot;n&quot;, &quot;ℓ&quot;, &quot;m&quot;ℓ orbital can be occupied by two electrons with opposing spins (given by the quantum number &quot;m&quot;s = ±), giving 2(2&quot;ℓ&quot; + 1) electrons overall. Orbitals with higher &quot;ℓ&quot; than given in the table are perfectly permissible, but these values cover all atoms so far discovered.

For a given value of the principal quantum number &quot;n&quot;, the possible values of &quot;ℓ&quot; range from 0 to ; therefore, the shell only possesses an s subshell and can only take 2 electrons, the shell possesses an s and a p subshell and can take 8 electrons overall, the shell possesses s, p, and d subshells and has a maximum of 18 electrons, and so on.

A simplistic one-electron model results in energy levels depending on the principal number alone. In more complex atoms these energy levels split for all , placing states of higher &quot;ℓ&quot; above states of lower &quot;ℓ&quot;. For example, the energy of 2p is higher than of 2s, 3d occurs higher than 3p, which in turn is above 3s, etc. This effect eventually forms the block structure of the periodic table. No known atom possesses an electron having &quot;ℓ&quot; higher than three (f) in its ground state.

The angular momentum quantum number, &quot;ℓ&quot; and the corresponding spherical harmonic govern the number of planar nodes going through the nucleus. A planar node can be described in an electromagnetic wave as the midpoint between crest and trough, which has zero magnitudes. In an s orbital, no nodes go through the nucleus, therefore the corresponding azimuthal quantum number &quot;ℓ&quot; takes the value of 0. In a p orbital, one node traverses the nucleus and therefore &quot;ℓ&quot; has the value of 1. formula_6 has the value formula_7.

Depending on the value of &quot;n&quot;, there is an angular momentum quantum number &quot;ℓ&quot; and the following series. The wavelengths listed are for a hydrogen atom:
== Addition of quantized angular momenta ==

Given a quantized total angular momentum formula_8 that is the sum of two individual quantized angular momenta formula_9 and formula_10,
formula_11
the quantum number formula_12 associated with its magnitude can range from formula_13 to formula_14 in integer steps
where formula_15 and formula_16 are quantum numbers corresponding to the magnitudes of the individual angular momenta.

=== Total angular momentum of an electron in the atom ===
Due to the spin–orbit interaction in an atom, the orbital angular momentum no longer commutes with the Hamiltonian, nor does the spin. These therefore change over time. However the total angular momentum does commute with the one-electron Hamiltonian and so is constant. is defined as
formula_17
 being the orbital angular momentum and the spin. The total angular momentum satisfies the same commutation relations as orbital angular momentum, namely
formula_18
from which it follows that
formula_19
where stand for , , and .

The quantum numbers describing the system, which are constant over time, are now and , defined through the action of on the wavefunction formula_5
formula_21

So that is related to the norm of the total angular momentum and to its projection along a specified axis. The &quot;j&quot; number has a particular importance for relativistic quantum chemistry, often featuring in subscript in for deeper states near to the core for which spin-orbit coupling is important.

As with any angular momentum in quantum mechanics, the projection of along other axes cannot be co-defined with , because they do not commute.
The eigenvectors of , , and parity, which are also eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian, are linear combinations of the eigenvectors of , , and .

== Beyond isolated atoms ==
The angular momentum quantum numbers strictly refer to isolated atoms. However, they have wider uses for atoms in solids, liquids or gases. The quantum number corresponds to specific spherical harmonics and are commonly used to describe features observed in spectroscopic methods such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. (The notation is slightly different, with X-ray notation where K, L, M are used for excitations out of electron states with formula_22.)

The angular momentum quantum numbers are also used when the electron states are described in methods such as Kohn–Sham density functional theory or with gaussian orbitals. For instance, in silicon the electronic properties used in semiconductor device are due to the p-like states with formula_23 centered at each atom, while many properties of transition metals depend upon the d-like states with formula_24.

== History ==
The azimuthal quantum number was carried over from the Bohr model of the atom, and was posited by Arnold Sommerfeld. The Bohr model was derived from spectroscopic analysis of atoms in combination with the Rutherford atomic model. The lowest quantum level was found to have an angular momentum of zero. Orbits with zero angular momentum were considered as oscillating charges in one dimension and so described as &quot;pendulum&quot; orbits, but were not found in nature. In three-dimensions the orbits become spherical without any nodes crossing the nucleus, similar (in the lowest-energy state) to a skipping rope that oscillates in one large circle.

<doc id="532574" wikidata="Q1356167" url="?curid=532574" title="House of Alpin">
<text>The House of Alpin, also known as the Alpinid dynasty, Clann Chináeda, and Clann Chinaeda meic Ailpín, was the kin-group which ruled in Pictland, possibly Dál Riata, and then the kingdom of Alba from Constantine II (Causantín mac Áeda) in the 940s until the death of Malcolm II (Máel Coluim mac Cináeda) in 1034.

Kings traced their descent from Kenneth MacAlpin (and not from his father, Alpín mac Echdach), and Irish genealogies in the Book of Ballymote and the Book of Lecan refer to the kindred as &quot;Clann Cináeda meic Ailpín&quot; by prioritising descent from Kenneth.

The origins of the family are uncertain. Later genealogies make Kenneth a descendant of Áed Find. While plausible, such claims are unprovable and appear only in the late tenth century. The associated idea that Kenneth had been a king in Dál Riata before he contended successfully for power in Pictland in the 840s, following the death of Eóganán mac Óengusa, is supported by nearly contemporary evidence.

Early kings of &quot;Clann Cináeda meic Ailpín&quot; are described as kings of the Picts, and the third king, Kenneth&#x27;s son Constantine I (Causantín mac Cináeda), appears to have been regarded as the last of the 70 Pictish kings soon after his death. The descendants of Kenneth were ousted in 878, when Constantine I&#x27;s brother, Áed mac Cináeda, was killed by Giric mac Dúngail, but they returned in 889, when Constantine I&#x27;s son Donald II (Domnall mac Causantín) ascended the throne upon the death or deposition of Giric. Donald II and his successors are described as kings of Alba.

During the tenth century, succession alternated between the descendants of Constantine I and those of Áed. Internecine strife in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries left the descendants of Constantine I unchallenged by male-line descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin, but Malcolm II left no male heirs. On Malcolm&#x27;s death, the line of kings descended from Kenneth came to an end. Future kings, while still tracing their descent from Kenneth, were descended from Malcolm&#x27;s daughter Bethóc and her husband Crinan of Dunkeld.

<text>The Miles M.25 Martinet was a target tug aircraft of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Fleet Air Arm (FAA) that was in service during the Second World War. It was the first British aircraft to be designed specifically for target towing.

Work on the Martinet was started in response to the RAF&#x27;s shortage of obsolete frontline aircraft for target towing duties. A derivative of the Master trainer, it was designed to have as much commonality with existing production aircraft as possible. The first prototype Martinet made its maiden flight on 24 April 1942; quantity production started immediately. A total of 1,724 Martinets were produced, of which the majority were operated either by the RAF or FAA, although some were used by overseas and civilian operators.

The Martinet was also developed into a relatively secret aircraft in response to Specification Q.10/43, which called for a radio-controlled target drone. This aircraft, designated the &quot;M.50 Queen Martinet&quot;, was only produced in small numbers, and its existence was a state secret until 1946. Several other derivatives of the basic airframe were also produced, including a dedicated glider tug and a trainer variant.

==Development==
===Origins===
Before 1941, the target tug role had been met by reusing former frontline aircraft which had either become obsolete or were surplus to requirements. However, while the crucial Battle of Britain was being waged and attrition rates were driven high amongst either side, the RAF found itself with a shortage of frontline aircraft. Seeking to avoid withdrawing existing combat-capable aircraft to perform as target tugs, the Air Ministry opted to procure new build aircraft specifically for this need, approaching Miles Aircraft Ltd with a request to rapidly produce a specialised target tug aircraft based upon the Miles Master trainer aircraft.
The requirements were formalised by the Ministry as Specification 12/41. Amongst the listed requirements was a stipulation that, in order simplify manufacturing as much as possible, the envisioned aircraft ought maximise the use of standardised components wherever feasible. 

On 24 April 1942, the first prototype Martinet made its maiden flight from Woodley Aerodrome, flown by chief test pilot Flight Lieutenant Thomas Rose. Results were satisfactory enough for production to begin immediately, leading to the Martinet rapidly supplanting the Master II on Miles&#x27; assembly lines at Woodley. In total 1,724 Martinets were produced; the majority of which served with either the RAF or Fleet Air Arm (FAA), although a minority of the type were adopted by overseas operators as well during the post war era.

===Further development===
The Martinet became the basis for further projects by the company. During 1943, it was decided to produce a derivative of the Martinet that functioned as a radio-controlled target drone to meet Specification Q.10/43. This variant, designated &quot;M.50 Queen Martinet&quot;, was quickly prototyped and a modest production contact was issued to Miles, leading to 69 examples being manufactured as a new-builds, while a further 17 aircraft were produced via the conversion of production Martinets. During its development and initial years of operation, the existence of the Queen Martinet was classified and the programme was held on the UK Government&#x27;s Secrets List; it was first publicly displayed at the Farnborough Airshow in June 1946, although details about the type remained protected for a number of years thereafter.

By 1941, officials were considered a proposed improved model of the Master trainer, but such ambitions were sidelined to focus manufacturing resources on the standard Martinet model. By 1945, production pressures had alleviated to the point where serious work could commence, thus Miles set about developing a trainer model of the aircraft, designated &quot;M.37 Martinet Trainer&quot;. From the onset, this aircraft was intended to be a stopgap measure as the Air Ministry had envisioned its long term trainer to harness turboprop propulsion. The conversion involved the removal of the outboard wing fuel tanks, the installation of a revised cabin with dual controls fitted, and a reduction in overall weight. A pair of prototypes were built, the first of which made its maiden flight on 11 April 1946. However, by the time it was ready for quantity production, more advanced trainers, such as the Avro Athena and Boulton Paul Balliol, had also reached an advanced stage of development, leaving no purpose for the type and thus it received no orders.

A more numerous variant of the Martinet was the adaption of the type for operating as a tug for gliders; it shared broad similarities to the Master II tug, the rudder having its lower portion removed along with the installation of stronger towing apparatus.

==Design==
The Miles Martinet draws heavily upon the Miles Master II trainer aircraft. While the two aircraft shared a relatively high degree of commonality, particularly in terms of components, there were also major differences, including the strengthening of the airframe to better handle the stresses of towing a target drogue. Other differences from the Master included a longer nose, greater wingspan, and higher cockpit, while the dual flying controls of the Master were omitted as unnecessary in its new capacity. 

Both the targets and towing gear were contained in a fairing beneath the fuselage, which could be deployed and retracted by a winch; multiple implementations of this apparatus were used, including winches that were alternatively driven via electric motors or wind power. Due to the aircraft&#x27;s centre of gravity being altered by the design modifications, the engine was brought forwards slightly to compensate; while a more heavy-duty cooling system was also installed to aid the engine in coping with the greater power output needed to offset the elevated drag that was induced while towing.

==Operational history==

Numerous RAF units received Martinets during the Second World War. Specifically, the type became a staple of air gunnery schools, operational training units, anti-aircraft cooperation squadrons, and air-sea reconnaissance units.

During the late 1940s and early 1950s, the type was gradually withdrawn from service within Britain&#x27;s armed forces. A total of five former RAF Martinets received civil registrations and were flown by civilians both in Britain and overseas. Efforts were made to promote surplus Martinet to fulfil additional roles, one such proposal involved the type&#x27;s adoption by the Royal Hellenic Air Force to perform missions such as artillery spotting, general observation, and close air support.

==Surviving aircraft==

A single Martinet survives; it is owned by the Museum of Berkshire Aviation in the United Kingdom. The aircraft (RAF serial number &quot;MS902&quot;) was built in 1943, and spent its operational life in Iceland at RAF Reykjavik. In 1949, &quot;MS902&quot; was sold to the Akureyri Flying Club and given the Icelandic civil registration &quot;TF-SHC&quot;. The club flew it until it crashed in 1951 near Kopasker in north-east Iceland. The wreckage remained at the crash site until 1977, when it was recovered and placed in storage by the Icelandic Aviation Historical Society.

The aircraft was returned to the United Kingdom in 1996 by the Museum of Berkshire Aviation and has since been the subject of a lengthy restoration project.

<doc id="532582" wikidata="Q1606957" url="?curid=532582" title="Penelope Pitstop">
<text>Penelope Pitstop is a fictional character who appeared in the 1968 Hanna-Barbera animated series &quot;Wacky Races&quot; and the spin-off &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;, and was voiced by Janet Waldo. She also appeared in the 2017 series of &quot;Wacky Races&quot;.

==Background==
Penelope &quot;Penny&quot; Pitstop is a southern belle, and the only female racer in the original &quot;Wacky Races&quot; lineup, driving a pink car known as The Compact Pussycat which has personal grooming facilities that would sometimes backfire on other racers, such as shampoo foam hitting their faces. She always has time to relax and worry about her looks, because her car is like a beauty parlor. Penelope Pitstop also has a habit of holding her arm out in the breeze to dry newly applied nail polish, which the others mistake for a turn signal (this habit once sent the Roaring Plenty into a cactus).

Peter Perfect had a crush on her, a feeling that was returned, and always tried to help her; in &quot;Dash to Delaware&quot;, they almost end up married. In the 2006 animated short, &quot;Wacky Races Forever&quot;, it is revealed that she had two children with Peter Perfect.

Unlike other drivers, Penelope rarely was targeted by the other racers (except Dick Dastardly of course), as it seems they also liked and tried to help her as Peter did. Penny was always thankful for their assistance and was perhaps the most peaceful racer on the track, though she twice gave the Creepy Coupe&#x27;s dragon and serpent a good bashing with her umbrella. In the 2017 version, she eventually shows martial arts skills.

Penelope also had her own cartoon series, &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;, which also featured her rescuers the Ant Hill Mob. Her sworn enemy is the Hooded Claw (who is the secret identity of her own guardian, Sylvester Sneekly). Although she is blind to the fact her guardian is her nemesis in disguise, she is very smart and often manages to get herself out of trouble before her true guardians the Ant Hill Mob can get to her in time.

== Appearance ==
In &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, Penelope has long blonde hair in a full fringe and she tied back into a ponytail with a hot pink scrunchie. She is 23 years old. She wears a purple racer helmet with goggles. She also wears a dark pink rider jacket with a purple turtleneck and purple gloves, pink skirt with red pants underneath and white boots.

In &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;, Penelope&#x27;s eyes resemble those of Daphne Blake, and she wears red lipstick. She wears a slight alteration to her Wacky Races wardrobe. Her helmet is replaced by a magenta pilot helmet with matching white goggles. She wears a hot pink long-sleeved jacket with a matching belt and long magenta scarf, which is hanging loose on the right side. Even though she still wears her red pants and white boots from Wacky Races, her gloves are now white.

In the 2017 reboot and sequel to the original &quot;Wacky Races&quot; series, she also has an evil twin sister named Pandora Pitstop.

<doc id="532592" wikidata="Q1411145" url="?curid=532592" title="Radiance">
<text>In radiometry, radiance is the radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received by a given surface, per unit solid angle per unit projected area. Radiance is used to characterize diffuse emission and reflection of electromagnetic radiation, and to quantify emission of neutrinos and other particles. The SI unit of radiance is the watt per steradian per square metre (). It is a &quot;directional&quot; quantity: the radiance of a surface depends on the direction from which it is being observed.

The related quantity spectral radiance is the radiance of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength, depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength.

Historically, radiance was called &quot;intensity&quot; and spectral radiance was called &quot;specific intensity&quot;. Many fields still use this nomenclature. It is especially dominant in heat transfer, astrophysics and astronomy. &quot;Intensity&quot; has many other meanings in physics, with the most common being power per unit area (so the radiance is the intensity per solid angle in this case).

==Description==

Radiance is useful because it indicates how much of the power emitted, reflected, transmitted or received by a surface will be received by an optical system looking at that surface from a specified angle of view. In this case, the solid angle of interest is the solid angle subtended by the optical system&#x27;s entrance pupil. Since the eye is an optical system, radiance and its cousin luminance are good indicators of how bright an object will appear. For this reason, radiance and luminance are both sometimes called &quot;brightness&quot;. This usage is now discouraged (see the article Brightness for a discussion). The nonstandard usage of &quot;brightness&quot; for &quot;radiance&quot; persists in some fields, notably laser physics.

The radiance divided by the index of refraction squared is invariant in geometric optics. This means that for an ideal optical system in air, the radiance at the output is the same as the input radiance. This is sometimes called &quot;conservation of radiance&quot;. For real, passive, optical systems, the output radiance is &quot;at most&quot; equal to the input, unless the index of refraction changes. As an example, if you form a demagnified image with a lens, the optical power is concentrated into a smaller area, so the irradiance is higher at the image. The light at the image plane, however, fills a larger solid angle so the radiance comes out to be the same assuming there is no loss at the lens.

Spectral radiance expresses radiance as a function of frequency or wavelength. Radiance is the integral of the spectral radiance over all frequencies or wavelengths. For radiation emitted by the surface of an ideal black body at a given temperature, spectral radiance is governed by Planck&#x27;s law, while the integral of its radiance, over the hemisphere into which its surface radiates, is given by the Stefan–Boltzmann law. Its surface is Lambertian, so that its radiance is uniform with respect to angle of view, and is simply the Stefan–Boltzmann integral divided by π. This factor is obtained from the solid angle 2π steradians of a hemisphere decreased by integration over the cosine of the zenith angle.

==Mathematical definitions==
===Radiance===
Radiance of a &quot;surface&quot;, denoted &quot;L&quot;e,Ω (&quot;e&quot; for &quot;energetic&quot;, to avoid confusion with photometric quantities, and &quot;Ω&quot; to indicate this is a directional quantity), is defined as
:formula_1
where
*∂ is the partial derivative symbol;
*Φe is the radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received;
*Ω is the solid angle;
*&quot;A&quot; cos &quot;θ&quot; is the &quot;projected&quot; area.

In general &quot;L&quot;e,Ω is a function of viewing direction, depending on &quot;θ&quot; through cos &quot;θ&quot; and azimuth angle through . For the special case of a Lambertian surface, is proportional to cos &quot;θ&quot;, and &quot;L&quot;e,Ω is isotropic (independent of viewing direction).

When calculating the radiance emitted by a source, &quot;A&quot; refers to an area on the surface of the source, and Ω to the solid angle into which the light is emitted. When calculating radiance received by a detector, &quot;A&quot; refers to an area on the surface of the detector and Ω to the solid angle subtended by the source as viewed from that detector. When radiance is conserved, as discussed above, the radiance emitted by a source is the same as that received by a detector observing it.

===Spectral radiance===

Spectral radiance in frequency of a &quot;surface&quot;, denoted &quot;L&quot;e,Ω,ν, is defined as
:formula_2
where &quot;ν&quot; is the frequency.

Spectral radiance in wavelength of a &quot;surface&quot;, denoted &quot;L&quot;e,Ω,λ, is defined as
:formula_3
where &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength.

==Conservation of basic radiance==
Radiance of a surface is related to étendue by
:formula_4
where
*&quot;n&quot; is the refractive index in which that surface is immersed;
*&quot;G&quot; is the étendue of the light beam.

As the light travels through an ideal optical system, both the étendue and the radiant flux are conserved. Therefore, &quot;basic radiance&quot; defined by
:formula_5
is also conserved. In real systems, the étendue may increase (for example due to scattering) or the radiant flux may decrease (for example due to absorption) and, therefore, basic radiance may decrease. However, étendue may not decrease and radiant flux may not increase and, therefore, basic radiance may not increase.

<doc id="532597" wikidata="Q899702" url="?curid=532597" title="Date rape drug">
<text>A date rape drug is any drug that incapacitates another person and renders that person vulnerable to sexual assault, including rape. The substances are associated with date rape because of reported incidents of their use in the context of two people dating, during which the victim is sexually assaulted, raped or suffers other harm. However, substances have also been exploited during retreats, for example ayahuasca retreats. The substances are not exclusively used to perpetrate sexual assault or rape, but are the properties or side-effects of substances normally used for personal recreation or medical purposes. The most common incapacitating agent for date rape is alcohol, administered either surreptitiously or consumed voluntarily, rendering the victim unable to make informed decisions or give consent.

==Frequency==
No comprehensive data exists on the frequency of drug-facilitated sexual assaults involving the use of surreptitious drug administration, due to the report rate of assaults and because rape victims who do report are often either never tested for these drugs, are tested for the wrong ones, or the tests are administered after the drug has been metabolized and left their body.

A 1999 study of 1,179 urine specimens from victims of suspected drug-facilitated sexual assaults in 49 American states found six (0.5%) positive for Rohypnol, 97 (8%) positive for other benzodiazepines, 48 (4.1%) positive for GHB, 451 (38%) positive for alcohol and 468 (40%) negative for any of the drugs searched for.
A similar study of 2,003 urine samples of victims of suspected drug-facilitated sexual assaults found less than 2% tested positive for Rohypnol or GHB. The samples used in these studies could only be verified as having been submitted within a 72-hour time frame or a 48-hour time frame. 

A three-year study in the UK detected sedatives or disinhibiting drugs that victims said they had not voluntarily taken in the urine of two percent of suspected drug-facilitated sexual assault victims. In 65% of the 1,014 cases included in this study, testing could not be conducted within a time frame that would allow detection of GHB. A 2009 Australian study found that of 97 instances of patients admitted to hospital believing their drinks might have been spiked, illicit drugs were detected in 28% of samples, and nine cases were identified as &quot;plausible drink spiking cases&quot;. This study defined a &quot;plausible drink spiking case&quot; in such a way that cases where (a) patients believed that their drink had been spiked, and (b) lab tests showed agents that patients said they had not ingested would still be ruled out as plausible if the patient did not also (c) exhibit &quot;signs and symptoms&quot; that were considered &quot;consistent with agents detected by laboratory screening.&quot;

==Documented routes of administration==

===Oral===
In slang, a Mickey Finn (or simply a Mickey) is a drink laced with a psychoactive drug or incapacitating agent (especially chloral hydrate) given to someone without their knowledge, with intent to incapacitate them. Serving someone a &quot;Mickey&quot; is most commonly referred to as &quot;slipping someone a mickey&quot;. Drink spiking is common practice by predators at drinking establishments who often lace alcoholic drinks with sedative drugs.

===Syringe injection===
Multiple reports of needle spiking were reported by young women in the United Kingdom from 2021 onwards. On 27 October 2021, the Garda Síochána (Irish police) began an investigation after a woman was spiked with a needle in a Dublin nightclub.

==Documented date rape drugs==

===Depressants===
Alcohol, consumed voluntarily, is the most commonly used drug involved in sexual assaults. Since the mid-1990s, the media and researchers have also documented an increased use of drugs such as flunitrazepam and ketamine to facilitate sexual assaults in the context of dating. Other drugs that have been used include hypnotics such as zopiclone, methaqualone, and the widely available zolpidem (Ambien); sedatives such as neuroleptics (anti-psychotics), chloral hydrate, and some histamine H1 antagonists; common recreational drugs such as ethanol, cocaine, and less common anticholinergics, barbiturates, opioids, PCP, scopolamine; nasal spray ingredient oxymetazoline; and certain GABAergics like GHB. Gamma-Butyrolactone is also often referred to as being used in sexual assaults.

==== Alcohol ====

Researchers agree that the drug most commonly involved in drug-facilitated sexual assaults is alcohol, which the victim has consumed voluntarily in most cases. In most jurisdictions, alcohol is legal and readily available and is used in the majority of sexual assaults. Many perpetrators use alcohol because their victims often drink it willingly, and can be encouraged to drink enough to lose inhibitions or consciousness. Sex with an unconscious victim is considered rape in most jurisdictions and some assailants have committed &quot;rapes of convenience&quot;, assaulting a victim after he or she had become unconscious from drinking too much.

Alcohol consumption is known to have effects on sexual behavior and aggression. During social interactions, alcohol consumption causes more biased appraisal of a partner&#x27;s sexual motives while impairing communication about and enhancing misperception of sexual intentions, effects exacerbated by peer influence about how to behave when drinking.
The effects of alcohol at the point of forced sex commonly include an impaired ability to rectify misperceptions and a diminished ability to resist sexual advances and aggressive sexual behavior.

&quot;The Blade&quot; released a special report, &quot;The Making of an Epidemic,&quot; criticizing a study conducted in the 1990s that concluded that 55% of rape victims had been intoxicated. According to &quot;The Blade&quot;, the study specifically ignored an Ohio statute that excluded &quot;situations where a person plies his intended partner with drink or drugs in hopes that lowered inhibition might lead to a liaison.&quot; The author of the study later admitted that the wording of the survey had been ambiguous.

=====Alcohol in campus rape=====
The increase of sexual assaults on college campuses has been attributed to the social expectations of students to participate in alcohol consumption; social norm dictates that students drink heavily and engage in casual sex.

Various studies have concluded the following:
* On average, at least 50% of college sexual assault cases are associated with alcohol use.
* On college campuses, 74% of the perpetrators and 55% of the victims had been drinking alcohol.
* In 2002, more than 70,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 were victims of alcohol-related sexual assault in the U.S.
* In violent incidents recorded by the police in which alcohol was a factor, about 9% of the offenders and nearly 14% of the victims were under age 21.

==== Z-drugs ====
=====Zolpidem=====
Zolpidem (Ambien) is one of the most common date-rape drugs according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. 

==== Benzodiazepines ====
Benzodiazepines (tranquilizers), such as Valium, Librium, Klonopin, Xanax, and Ativan, are prescribed to treat anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, and several other conditions, and are also frequently used recreationally. Benzodiazepines are often used in drug-facilitated sexual assaults, with the most notorious being flunitrazepam (chemical name) or Rohypnol (proprietary or brand name), also known as &quot;roofies,&quot; &quot;rope,&quot; and &quot;roaches.&quot;

The benzodiazepines midazolam and temazepam were the two most common benzodiazepines utilized for date rape.

Benzodiazepines can be detected in urine through the use of drug tests administered by medical officials or sold at pharmacies and performed at home. Most tests will detect benzodiazepines for a maximum of 72 hours after it was taken. Most general benzodiazepine detection tests will not detect Rohypnol: the drug requires a test specifically designed for that purpose. One new process can detect a 2 mg dose of Rohypnol for up to 28 days post-ingestion. Other tests for Rohypnol include blood and hair tests. Because the most commonly used drug tests often yield false negatives for Rohypnol, experts recommend use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.

=====Rohypnol=====
Rohypnol (Flunitrazepam) pills are typically small and dissolve readily into drinks without significantly affecting their taste or color, allowing the pills to be easily administered surreptitiously to victims.

In one 2002 survey of 53 women who used Rohypnol recreationally, 10% said they were physically or sexually assaulted while under its influence. If enough of the drug is taken, a person may experience a state of automatism or dissociation. After the drug wears off, users may find themselves unable to remember what happened while under its influence (anterograde amnesia), and feeling woozy, hung-over, confused, dizzy, sluggish and uncoordinated, often with an upset stomach. They may also have some difficulty moving their limbs normally.

Rohypnol is believed to be commonly used in drug-facilitated sexual assaults in the United States, the United Kingdom, and throughout Europe, Asia and South America. Although Rohypnol&#x27;s use in drug-facilitated sexual assaults has been covered extensively in the news media, researchers disagree about how common such use actually is. Law enforcement manuals describe it as one of the drugs most commonly implicated in drug-facilitated sexual assaults. Despite having a long half-life (18–28 hours) an incorrect belief is that Rohypnol is undetectable 12 hours after administration which may result in victims failing to get a blood or urine test the following day.

==== GHB ====
Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a central nervous system depressant. It has no odor and tastes salty, but the taste can be masked when mixed in a drink. 

GHB is used recreationally to stimulate euphoria, to increase sociability, to promote libido and lower inhibitions. It is sold under names such as Rufies, Liquid E and Liquid X. It is usually taken orally, by the capful or teaspoon.

From 1996 to 1999, 22 reports of GHB being used in drug-facilitated sexual assaults were made to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. A 26-month study of 1,179 urine samples from suspected drug-facilitated sexual assaults across the United States found 4% positive for GHB. The National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) says that in the United States GHB had surpassed Rohypnol as the substance most commonly used in drug-facilitated sexual assaults, likely because GHB is much more easily available, cheaper and leaves the body more quickly. GHB is only detectable in urine for six to twelve hours after ingestion.

===Psychedelics===

====Ayahuasca====
Ayahuasca has been used in some ayahuasca retreats to sexually abuse ayahuasca tourists.

==== 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) ====
MDMA is an empathogen. Although it is not sedating like other date rape drugs, it has been used to facilitate sexual assault. It can increase disinhibition and sexual desire. Often Ecstasy is combined with amphetamines or other drugs.

==Detection==
Several devices have, in recent years, been developed to detect the presence of date rape drugs, many designed with discreetness in mind. One, developed by two Tel Aviv University researchers, is a sensor for gamma-hydroxybutyric acid and ketamine, but appears similar to a straw, and sends a text to the user&#x27;s phone to warn them. In 2022, another &quot;Smart Straw&quot; product was designed by students at the University of Nantes: a non-electronic stainless steel straw including a ring that would change colors in the presence of GHB, Rohypnol, or ketamine. Another, designed by four North Carolina State University students, is a nail polish that changes color in the presence of date rape drugs. Several others have also been designed with these color-changing mechanisms in mind.

==Media coverage==
There were three stories in the media about Rohypnol in 1993, 25 in 1994, and 854 in 1996. In early 1996, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine published &quot;Roofies: The date-rape drug&quot; which ended with the line &quot;Don&#x27;t take your eyes off your drink.&quot; That summer, researchers say all major American urban and regional newspapers covered date rape drugs, with headlines such as &quot;Crackdown sought on date rape drug&quot; (&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;) and &quot;Drug zaps memory of rape victims&quot; (&quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;). In 1997 and 1998, the date rape drug story received extensive coverage on CNN, ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; and &quot;Primetime Live&quot;, as well as &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. Women were advised not to drink from punch bowls, not to leave a drink unattended and keeping drinks with them at all times (including when going to a dance or the bathroom, or using the phone), not to try new drinks, not to share drinks, not to drink anything with an unusual taste or appearance, take their own drinks to parties, drink nothing opened by another person, and if they feel sick to go with someone they know and not alone or with someone they just met or do not know.

News media has been criticized for overstating the threat of drug-facilitated sexual assault, for providing &quot;how to&quot; material for potential date rapists and for advocating &quot;grossly excessive protective measures for women, particularly in coverage between 1996 and 1998. Law enforcement representatives and feminists have also been criticized for supporting the overstatements for their own purposes.

Craig Webber states that this extensive coverage has created or amplified a moral panic rooted in societal anxieties about rape, hedonism and the increased freedoms of women in modern culture. Goode et al. say it has not only given a powerful added incentive for the suppression of party drugs, but has inappropriately undermined the long-established argument that recreational drug use is purely a consensual and victimless crime. By shining a spotlight on premeditated criminal behavior, Philip Jenkins states that it has relieved the culture from having to explore and evaluate more nuanced forms of male sexual aggression towards people, such as those displayed in date rapes that were not facilitated by the surreptitious administration of drugs.

For similar moral panics around social tensions manifesting via discussion of drugs and sex crime, researchers point to the opium scare of the late 19th century, in which &quot;sinister Chinese&quot; were said to use opium to coerce white women into sexual slavery. Similarly, in the Progressive Era, a persistent urban legend told of white middle-class women being surreptitiously drugged, abducted, and sold into sexual slavery to Latin American brothels. This analysis does not contradict instances when date rape drugs are used or sexual trafficking occurs; its focus is on actual prevalence of certain crimes relative to media coverage of it.

<doc id="532599" wikidata="Q855367" url="?curid=532599" title="Horned puffin">
<text>The horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata) is an auk found in the North Pacific Ocean, including the coasts of Alaska, Siberia and British Columbia. It is a pelagic seabird that feeds primarily by diving for fish. It nests in colonies, often with other auks.

It is similar in appearance to the Atlantic puffin, its closest relative of the North Atlantic, but differs by a &quot;horn&quot; of black skin located above the eye, present in adult birds.

==Etymology==
The binomial name of this species, &quot;Fratercula corniculata&quot;, comes from the Medieval Latin &quot;fratercula&quot;, meaning “friar”; their black-and-white plumage resembling the robes of monks. &quot;Corniculata&quot; means “horn-shaped” or “crescent-shaped”, in reference to the black horn above the bird&#x27;s eye.

The vernacular name &quot;puffin&quot; – puffed in the sense of swollen – was originally applied to the fatty, salted meat of young birds of the unrelated species, the Manx shearwater (&quot;Puffinus puffinus&quot;), formerly known as the &quot;Manks puffin&quot;. It is an Anglo-Norman word (Middle English &quot;pophyn&quot; or &quot;poffin&quot;) used for the cured carcasses. The Atlantic puffin acquired the name at a much later stage, possibly because of its similar nesting habits, and it was formally applied to that species by Pennant in 1768. It was later extended to include the similar and related Pacific puffins.

The Yup’ik of the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta call the puffin &quot;qilangaq&quot;, &quot;qengacuar(aq)&quot; (“little nose”), or &quot;qategarpak&quot; (“large white breast”). The Ainu people of Sakhalin call them etupirka, which means &quot;beautiful beak&quot;.

==Description==
The height of the adult puffin is approximately , the weight is approximately , and the wingspan is approximately . Horned puffins are monomorphic (the male and female exhibit the same plumage coloration). Sexually mature birds have a small fleshy black &quot;horn&quot; extending upwards from the eye, from which the animal derives its common name — the horned puffin. A dark eyestripe extends backwards from the eye towards the occiput. The cheeks are white, with a yellow wattle at the base of the bill. The legs and feet are orange.

The horned puffin&#x27;s bill, which is larger than those of other puffin species, is red at the tip and yellow at the base. 
In summer (breeding) plumage, the bill&#x27;s outer layer – the rhamphotheca – grows in size and turns bright yellow with a dark orange tip. The size and color of the rhamphotheca helps to attract a mate. The brilliant outer layers of the rhamphotheca are shed in late summer, as the face reverts to a gray and black color, and the legs and feet fade to a pale fleshy color. This phase is referred to as eclipse plumage. The puffin&#x27;s bill has fluorescent properties that are also used to attract a partner. Puffins can see ultraviolet rays, allowing them to spot luminescence on the bills of other puffins during the courtship display.

The horned puffin chick has smoky-gray cheeks and a fine, black triangular-shaped beak. The feet are pinkish or greyish. The juvenile&#x27;s height is less than that of the adult at the time of leaving the nest. Young puffins lose their greyish facial spots during their first springtime. The beak gains its developed form at the age of one year and continues to grow over the years, reaching the brightest coloration at five years, the point of sexual maturity. The puffin reaches its adult size and weight at this period.

==Call==

Horned puffins emit a relatively small number of sounds, mostly low in volume. These guttural noises are identified as cooing, roaring or grunting. The most common puffin sound is usually transcribed as &quot;arr-arr-arr&quot;, which accelerates when the animal is threatened, becoming an &quot;A-gaa-kah-kha-kha”. These noises are most often produced by adults and are similar to bellowing, described as the &quot;distant sound of a chainsaw”.

The sounds during the mating season can be transcribed as &quot;Op-op-op-op-op”. These sounds are rarely made outside breeding times, and puffins are quieter at sea.

==Distribution and habitat==

The horned puffin is relatively common across its range. It is present throughout the northern Pacific Ocean, including the Shumagin Islands of the Bering Sea, the Siberian coast, Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands. In North America, it is found on the western coasts of Alaska and British Columbia, Haida Gwaii and the Aleutian Islands. Horned Puffin are also found in the vicinity of the Chukchi Sea and especially on Wrangel Island. More rarely, the species travels as far south as Japan and the coasts of Oregon and California. It is not a migratory bird, although it winters far out to sea.

Horned puffins live among steep rocky slopes and cliffs. Unlike other puffins, they dig little or no burrows, preferring rock crevices or shelters under piles of rock for home and shelter.

As of 2023, for the last several years, at least one Horned Puffin has been seen spending the summer months at Smith Island, Washington, in the Salish Sea, alongside the local breeding population of Tufted Puffins. Researchers, with help from several commercial Whale Watching companies in the region, are trying to figure out if this is a lone individual, or a potentially a mated pair. If it is the latter, this would add a breeding location for the species hundreds of miles away from their normal grounds.

==Behavior==
===Flight===

To achieve flight, horned puffins either jump off a cliff to gain momentum, or races across the water to reaching the speed required for takeoff. Horned puffins fly compactly and quickly, above sea level. The wing beats are constant, rapid and regular. They fly in groups of about two to fifteen individuals, traveling between nesting and foraging grounds, sometimes with tufted puffins or murres.

===On land===
The horned puffin walks upright, gripping rock surfaces with its claws, and climbs cliffs with ease. Its normal running position is made on low density soil, usually around a hole.

Horned puffins live and breed in colonies of tens to thousands or more. They fly in circular motions above the colony before landing, upon which they adopt a dominant or submissive posture towards other birds. The sign of submission is to briefly hold their legs slightly apart and spread their wings over their head for about four seconds. The puffin&#x27;s dominant display is to holding its beak open with its tongue lowered (known as &quot;gaping&quot;), back feathers erect, stepping in place as it rocks from side to side. This gesture is often made towards a rival puffin, who may either back down or fight with the intruder. During fights, puffins lock bills and beat each other with their wings, and the two combatants may tumble down a slope or cliff still locked in battle.

===At sea===

Horned puffins spend half of their time on water, paddling along the surface with their feet. They are extremely agile underwater, to the point that their movement can be called &quot;underwater flight&quot; rather than swimming. Their powerful wings serve as oars and their webbed feet work as a rudder. Water pressure keeps the feathers glued to the body, placing the puffin into an aerodynamic shape. Puffins can easily stay longer than one minute under water.

Like most other seabirds, horned puffins have waterproof plumage, which permits it to dive and prevents rapid heat loss. This is made possible by its feather disposition and a specialized gland near the tail called the uropygial gland. This secretes a greasy and hydrophobic liquid that the puffin spreads on its plumage with its beak, permitting it to float.

=== Food and hunting techniques ===
Adult horned puffins are quite general in their diet, feeding on fish, small invertebrates, crustaceans, polychaete worms and squid. They also feed on small algae and marine plants.

To catch fish, horned puffins dive down to about , pursuing prey mostly taking place at in depth. The puffin most commonly hunts in the early morning. It dives head first into water, as it stakes out a school of fish, and keeps an eye out for predators. Once the prey is spotted, the puffin dives in pursuit. Diving for prey usually lasts between 20 and 30 seconds. Puffins usually swallow several small fish before the bringing rest back to the colony. They do not take the time to readjust their prey within their beaks, so as not to risk losing their meal.

Hunting areas are usually located fairly far offshore from the nest. Horned puffins will return from hunting with several small fish, squid or crustaceans in their specialized bills. The chicks have a less varied diet, feeding mainly on sandeel or capelin from near the coast. These fish are distributed by the parents two to six times per day. Unlike many other seabirds, which employ regurgitation to feed their young, horned puffins feed their chicks whole fish directly from the bill. Both parents participate in the feeding and rearing of the chick.

===Reproduction===

The horned puffin reaches sexual maturity between the age of five and seven years, entering the breeding season between May and September. Horned puffin pairs are monogamous. Courtship begins as the male and female puffin swim alongside on the water. The male displays by arising from the water, neck outstretched, opening and closing the bill while jerking the head. The female makes a hunched posture with her neck contracted inwards, close to the water surface. This is followed by billing, a practice where mated birds touch beaks. A slight head movement from both partners confirms that the couple will now mate for life. The male then mounts the female from behind, beating his wings to keep balance. After about 35 seconds of mating, the female proceeds to dive down and surface again. The pair then flap their wings.

Pairs choose a nesting ground a week after arriving at the breeding area, preferring rock crevices. They clear a space and gather materials to build their nest, mostly out of grass and feathers. Each pair lays only one egg per year. Pairs in the same colony usually lay around the same time, but very rarely this occurs over more than one week. The female&#x27;s sperm storage glands in the oviduct help select spermatozoa during the race to the egg cell. The egg is oval, off-white in color with lavender, gray and brown highlights. Both parents take turns incubating the egg over about 41 days, and spend another forty days raising the chick. The fledgling leaves the nest alone and at night, making its way towards open water, then quickly dives and swims away to begin independent life.

Rises in ocean temperature have increased the reproductive rate of the horned puffin.

==Status==

The total number of horned puffins is estimated at 1,200,000. 300,000 are located in Asia, while the other 900,000 are located in North America, with a high concentration in the Alaska Peninsula numbering 760,000. In Alaska, nearly 250,000 puffins are distributed in 608 different colonies, the largest being on Suklik Island. There are about 92,000 horned puffins in the Aleutian Islands, while nearly 300,000 are located on the islands and coasts of the Sea of Okhotsk. The Chukchi Sea has a colony of 18,000 puffins at sea level, the largest in the area.

<text>Miles was the name used between 1943 and 1947 to market the aircraft of British engineer Frederick George Miles, who, with his wife – aviator and draughtswoman Maxine &quot;Blossom&quot; Miles (née Forbes-Robertson) – and his brother George Herbert Miles, designed numerous light civil and military aircraft and a range of curious prototypes.

==History==
===Phillips and Powis===
A company was founded in 1928 by Charles Powis and Jack Phillips as Phillips &amp; Powis Aircraft (Reading) Ltd. In 1929 they opened Woodley Aerodrome, near the town of Reading, Berkshire.

In 1936, Rolls-Royce bought into the company. Although aircraft were produced under the Miles name, it was not until 1943 that the firm became Miles Aircraft Limited when Rolls-Royce&#x27;s interests were bought out.

The company needed to increase production of the Miles Messenger and to do so it took over a former linen mill in Banbridge, County Down, Northern Ireland for the production of components of the aircraft. A hangar at RAF Long Kesh was used for assembly of the aircraft and flight testing was carried out at the airfield. The company moved to Newtownards following the end of the war in 1946.

The company opened the Miles Aeronautical Technical School in 1943 under the directorship of Maxine (Blossom) Miles The school had a &quot;Headmaster&quot;, Walter Evans.

===Bankruptcy and receivership===
In 1947, the company entered receivership following bankruptcy proceedings instigated by Titanine Ltd., in the Chancery Division of the High Court. Titanine supplied Miles with aviation coatings used in the production of the Miles Gemini aircraft. Mr. Justice Wynn-Parry adjourned the petition of Titanine Ltd., for the winding up of Miles Aircraft Ltd., until 19 January 1948, on the grounds that the company had showed &quot;prima facie&quot; reasons for not yet having formulated a reorganization scheme. The petitioners, creditors for £5,837, were supported by other creditors for £62,000 and opposed by creditors for £200,000. An affidavit put into court showed that subject to audit, a loss of £630,000 had been incurred on 31 October 1947, but that a rescue plan could not be drawn up until the audit was completed. The principal trade creditors were: Blackburn Aircraft Ltd., De La Rue Extrusions Ltd., Smiths Aircraft Instruments Ltd. and the Sperry Gyroscope Co. Ltd. Mr. F. G. Miles announced the payment of the 4% per cent preference dividends out of his own resources of £8,600. After Miles Aircraft had been taken over by financiers in 1947, the design and manufacture of aircraft was ended by the new Board. At this time the company had some £5 million worth of business in hand, including substantial orders for the Messenger and the Gemini.

In 1948 an application by the Board of Trade for the appointment of an inspector to investigate the affairs of Miles Aircraft Ltd. was granted by Mr. Justice Roxburgh. The B.O.T. case was that when a prospectus was issued in March, 1947 (before the accounts for 1946 were published), the directors should reasonably have been expected to know that all was not well with the company, and when, in August, 1947, a dividend of 7% per cent and a bonus of 24% were recommended, they should reasonably have been expected to know that a big loss was being suffered by the company.

Charges were brought against Sir William Malcolm Mount and F. G. Miles. There were 24 charges regarding publication of a Miles Aircraft Ltd prospectus with &quot;false and reckless statements&quot;. The trial began on 10 May 1950 at the Old Bailey. After 17 days of sitting, the jury stopped the case against Miles and Sir William, and they were discharged. They had appeared on charges of inducing people to acquire shares in the company by making a misleading forecast and dishonestly concealing a material fact in a prospectus. According to &quot;Flight&quot;, &quot;Twenty of the original 24 counts were thrown out before the defence was reached. The prosecution alleged that the defendants gave a misleading forecast that for 1947 the profit covering the production of aircraft would have been £75,000, whereas there was a substantial loss. It was alleged that they recklessly made the misleading statement that the company had orders on hand which were sufficient to ensure production for the following two years, and that they dishonestly concealed the fact that a profit for the manufacture of aircraft in 1947 was unlikely.&quot; Both men said that they believed every word of the prospectus was true. After the acquittal, an application for costs for £20,000 was disallowed.
The aviation assets were purchased by Handley Page as Handley Page Reading Ltd. Handley Page produced the Miles-designed M.60 Marathon as the H.P.R.1 Marathon. The Miles Aeronautical Technical School was taken over by the Reading Technical College. Other products in which Miles had interests included photocopiers; this business became Copycat Ltd, which was acquired by the Nashua Corporation in 1963. The Philidas locking nut unit became an independent company. The bookbinding machinery and actuator production were taken over by a specifically formed company, the Western Manufacturing Estate Ltd, the name &quot;Western&quot; referring to its location on the Woodley aerodrome. This company later merged with the Adamant Engineering Company Ltd. to form the Adwest Group. Miles also manufactured ballpoint pens designed by László Bíró through an associated company, the Miles Martin Pen Co. Ltd.

===F. G. Miles Limited===

In 1948, F.G. Miles founded F. G. Miles Limited, which continued to produce aircraft under the Miles brand. The company was based on two sites, Redhill Aerodrome and Shoreham Aerodrome. In 1961, the aviation interests were purchased (along with Auster Aircraft Limited) by British Executive and General Aviation Limited (Beagle Aircraft), initially as Beagle-Miles Ltd, with George Herbert Miles as Chief Designer and Technical Director.

The company adopted a group structure with subsidiary companies as follows: Meridian Airmaps Ltd (whose collection of aerial photographs forms part of the English Heritage Archive), Miles Development Products Ltd, Miles Electronics Ltd, Miles Marine &amp; Structural Plastics Ltd and Jet Tanks Ltd. The group was initially based at Redhill, but moved to Shoreham in 1953.
Miles Electronics was involved in the manufacture of flight simulators; this division merged with the UK arm of the Link Trainer flight simulator company and was later acquired by the Singer Corporation. In 1975 Hunting Associated Industries acquired a controlling interest in F. G. Miles Engineering and all its subsidiaries. The company was renamed Hunting Hivolt and Jeremy Miles, the son of Fred Miles (who founded the firm), became a non-executive director on the board. Other companies included Miles HiVolt Ltd and Miles-Dufon Ltd (this company went into administration on 15 April 1980).

Design work between F. G. Miles Ltd and the French company, Hurel-Dubois, resulted in the HDM.105 – a standard Miles Aerovan fitted with an Hurel-Dubois high-aspect-ratio wing. This work led to the Hurel-Dubois HD.34 and the Short Skyvan series of aircraft.

==Aircraft designs==
 
The company&#x27;s earlier aircraft include the Hawk Trainer and its military variant, the Magister, as well as the Messenger and the Gemini. During the Second World War, it produced the Master advanced trainer, as well as the Martinet and Monitor target tugs.

The aircraft designed by Miles were often technologically and aerodynamically advanced for their time; the M.20 emergency production fighter prototype outperformed contemporary Hawker Hurricanes, despite having fixed landing gear. The X Minor was a flying testbed for blended wing-fuselage designs, although the large commercial transport intended to be produced from this research never entered production. The gigantic Miles X Airliner was to seat 55 and have eight engines buried in the wings, driving four sets of contra-rotating props and achieve a range of 3,450 miles.

The Miles Libellula (named after dragonflies) were experimental tandem-wing designs. A fighter prototype M.35, designed to give the pilot a better landing view, and to fit on aircraft carriers without a need for folding wings, was funded and built by the company (with wood) in only six weeks but was rejected by the Ministry of Aircraft Production. A bomber version was designed, and then a prototype ordered for a &quot;high speed bomber&quot; requirement, but that prototype was never built. Instead, the company built a 5/8th scale version M.39B which was sold to the government for research and testing; it was scrapped after being damaged and the bomber procurement had been cancelled. Tandem-wing designs, with a wing at both ends of an aircraft, reduce centre of gravity problems due to fuel or ammunition usage.

The Miles M.52 was a turbojet-powered supersonic research aircraft project that was cancelled before completion.

==Aircraft==
The following table lists the company number, name, year of first flight and number produced of all Miles aircraft.

*R.A.E. – Vickers Transonic Research Rocket. The test vehicle was a 3/10-scale model of the Miles E.24/43 design (except for the omission of the distinctive annular air intake of the full-scale aircraft). To maintain the centre of gravity it was necessary to include a large balance weight (almost 1/10 of total all-up weight) in the foremost section of the ogival nose. On 9 October 1948, model A3 (one of three craft built) was successfully launched.[25]

==Missiles==
* Miles Hoopla – a surface-to-surface missile project, the Miles Hoopla dates from 1941 to 1943. It was a remotely piloted, high wing light aircraft carrying a 1,000 lb bomb. It was powered by a de Havilland Gipsy Queen engine with a wingspan of 14 feet, and an estimated speed of over 300 mph. It was not a &quot;flying bomb&quot; like the V-1, but was intended to drop its load and return for re-use. Accuracy was not a major consideration as its intended target was to be German cities. Only a mock-up was constructed before the project was cancelled.

==Legacy==

The Miles Aircraft Collection was established in 1993 for anyone interested in Miles aircraft and related subjects and aims to encourage the preservation of all surviving examples worldwide (ideally in flying condition or otherwise in museums and collections open to the public).

<text>The .357 Smith &amp; Wesson Magnum, .357 S&amp;W Magnum, .357 Magnum, or 9×33mmR (as it is known in unofficial metric designation) is a smokeless powder cartridge with a bullet diameter. It was created by Elmer Keith, Phillip B. Sharpe, and Douglas B. Wesson of firearm manufacturers Smith &amp; Wesson and Winchester. The .357 Magnum cartridge is notable for its highly effective terminal ballistics.

The .357 Magnum cartridge is based upon Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s earlier .38 Special cartridge. It was introduced in 1935, and its use has since become widespread.

==Design==

The .357 Magnum was collaboratively developed over a period in the early to mid-1930s by a group of individuals as a direct response to Colt&#x27;s .38 Super Automatic. At the time, the .38 Super was the only American pistol cartridge capable of defeating automobile cover and the early ballistic vests that were just beginning to emerge in the Interwar period. Tests at the time revealed that those vests defeated any handgun bullet traveling less than about . Colt&#x27;s .38 Super Automatic just edged over that velocity and was able to penetrate car doors and vests that bootleggers and gangsters were employing as cover.

Though .38 Special and .357 Magnum would seem to be different diameter chamberings, they are in fact identical, as at , they both have the same bullet diameter. The .38 Special nomenclature relates to the previous use of heeled bullets (such as the .38 Short Colt and .38 Long Colt), which were the same diameter as the case. The only external dimensional difference between .38 Special and .357 Magnum is the case length; this was done to prevent the accidental loading of .357 Magnum cartridges into .38 Special revolvers not designed for the .357 Magnum&#x27;s higher chamber pressure. Case volume was not a factor in the increase in case length, as the .38 Special cartridge was originally a black-powder cartridge, while the .357 Magnum was developed using much denser smokeless powder.

Much credit for the .357&#x27;s early development is given to hunter and experimenter Elmer Keith. Keith&#x27;s early work in loading the .38 Special to increasingly higher pressure levels was made possible by the availability of heavy, target-shooting–oriented revolvers like the Smith &amp; Wesson .38-44 &quot;Heavy Duty&quot; and &quot;Outdoorsman&quot;, .38-caliber revolvers built on .44-caliber frames. The .38-44 HV load used the .38-Special cartridge loaded to a much higher velocity than standard .38-Special ammunition. The .38-44 revolvers were made by using a .44 Special size gun with the barrel bored to accept .357-caliber bullets (the true bullet diameter of the .38 Special) and the cylinder bored to accept cartridges (where the name &quot;38 Special&quot; originated). Since the frame, cylinder, and barrel were much stronger than the standard .38 Special components, it was capable of withstanding much higher pressures. The .38-44 HV round, while no longer available, was in most cases the equal of the later .357 Magnum, which works at more than double the pressure of standard .38 Special. 

The .357 Magnum addresses safety issues posed by earlier cartridges. Lengthening the cartridge by approximately prevents the high-pressure .357 cartridge from chambering (fitting) in a firearm designed for the shorter, lower-pressure .38 Special. Elmer Keith contributed the Keith-style bullet, which increased the mass of bullet located outside the cartridge case, while leaving more room inside the case for powder. The Keith bullet employed a large, flat meplat for rapid energy transfer to improve wounding capacity. Because this bullet design does not deform like a hollow point, it achieves greater penetration. These characteristics of the Keith bullet make it suitable both for hunting and target shooting.

To reassert itself as the leading law-enforcement armament provider, Smith &amp; Wesson developed the .357 Magnum, with Douglas B. Wesson (grandson of co-founder Daniel B. Wesson) leading the effort within Smith &amp; Wesson, along with considerable technical assistance from Phillip B. Sharpe, a member of the technical division staff of the National Rifle Association of America. The new round was developed from Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s existing .38 Special round. It used a different powder load, and ultimately the case was extended by . The case extension was more a matter of safety than of necessity. Because the .38 Special and the early experimental .357 Magnum cartridges loaded by Keith were identical in physical attributes, it was possible to load an experimental .357 Magnum cartridge into a .38 Special revolver, with potentially disastrous results. To address this, Smith &amp; Wesson slightly extended the case, which made it impossible to chamber the Magnum-power round in a gun not designed for the additional pressure.

The choice of bullet for the .357 Magnum cartridge varied during its development. During the development at Smith &amp; Wesson, the original Keith bullet was modified slightly, to the form of the Sharpe bullet, which itself had been based upon the Keith bullet, but which had 5/6 of the bearing surface of the Keith bullet, Keith bullets typically being made oversized and sized down. Winchester, however, upon experimenting further during the cartridge development, modified the Sharpe bullet shape slightly while keeping its overall contour. The final choice of bullet was thus based upon the both earlier bullet designs, while differing slightly from each.

== Dimensions ==
The .357 Magnum has 1.66 milliliter (26.2 grain ) cartridge case capacity.

.357 Magnum maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm)

The cartridge headspaces on the rim of the case. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 476 mm (1 in 18.74 in), six grooves, ø lands = 8.79 mm, ø grooves = 9.02 mm, land width = 2.69 mm and the primer type is small pistol magnum.

According to the C.I.P. rulings, the .357 Magnum cartridge case can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P.-regulated countries, every pistol cartridge combination has to be proofed at 130% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. This means that .357 Magnum chambered arms in C.I.P.-regulated countries are currently proof tested at PE piezo pressure.

== Performance ==

This cartridge is regarded by many as an excellent hunting, metallic silhouette, and self-defense round. With proper loadings it can also be effective against large or dangerous game, such as bear and ungulates. The .357 Magnum has less energy than the larger magnum revolver loadings but is smaller in diameter with high velocity allowing for excellent penetration properties. It is a fine small- and medium-game round and is sufficient to hunt deer at reasonable ranges if suitable loadings are used by a competent marksman. For further comparison, the .357 Magnum has a higher velocity at than its parent case (.38 Special) has at the muzzle. The .357 Magnum&#x27;s effectiveness on game is similar to that of the .45 Colt, but with a much flatter trajectory due to its higher velocity. It has been used with success for self-defense, plinking, hunting, or target shooting.

The original .357 Magnum load was a bullet with an advertised muzzle velocity of and muzzle energy of . (Muzzle velocity was taken using a large frame revolver with a fairly long barrel of ) Most of today&#x27;s SAAMI conform loads are fairly mild when compared to the original mid-1930s load. Today&#x27;s C.I.P. conform loads can duplicate the original mid-1930s load. When using a revolver with a shorter barrel, today&#x27;s C.I.P. conform maximum loads with a bullet can reach a muzzle velocity of .

For a handgun cartridge, the bolt thrust is considerable at C.I.P. conform maximum loads and an important factor in weapons design. The greater the bolt thrust, the stronger the locking mechanism has to be to withstand it.
Revolvers chambered in .357 Magnum have the significant advantage of also being able to chamber and fire the shorter and less-powerful .38 Special cartridge. Compared to the .357 Magnum, .38 Special is also lower in cost, recoil, noise, and muzzle flash. The ability to also fire the .38 Special makes .357 revolvers ideal for novice shooters who are not yet used to firing full-power .357 magnum loads but do not want the expense of buying a second lower-powered gun to train with. However, .38 Special ammunition should not generally be used with any .357 magnum &quot;semiautomatic&quot; handgun or rifle, since such firearms require the larger recoil produced by firing a .357 Magnum round to cycle properly.

The .357 Magnum has also become popular as a &quot;dual-use&quot; cartridge in short, light rifles like the American Old West lever-actions. In a rifle, the bullet will exit the barrel at about , making it far more versatile than the .30 Carbine or the .32-20 Winchester. In the 1930s it was found to be very effective against steel car doors and ballistic vests, and metal-penetrating rounds were once popular in the United States among highway patrol, state police, sheriffs and other police agencies. The .357 magnum revolver has been largely replaced by modern, high-capacity semi-automatic pistols for police use, but it is still very popular for backup gun use and among outdoorsmen, security guards, and civilians for hunting, metallic silhouette, target shooting, and self-defense. The 9mm Winchester Magnum, which is also known as the 9×29mm, was developed to duplicate the performance of the .357 Magnum in a semi-automatic pistol, as was the .357 SIG cartridge.

Some common performance parameters are shown in the table below for several .357 Magnum loads. Bullet weights ranging from are common. The jacketed hollow point loads are popular for self-defense, whereas the heavier loads are commonly used for hunting. Loads are available with energies typically from 400 and 800 foot-pounds force (542 and 1,085 joules) and can be selected for various applications based on desired use and risk assessments.

==Comparison==


In terms of accuracy, the .357 Magnum has at least the same potential for precision shooting as the benchmark .38 Special wadcutter round—indeed, a good .357 Magnum revolver will shoot .38 Special wadcutter ammunition with good results. It is this accuracy and power, and the versatility of also being capable of using less-expensive, milder .38 Special ammunition, that makes a .357 Magnum revolver an excellent gun for many different disciplines, from precision shooting to long-range falling-plate events. It is an excellent round for those considering handloading ammunition, as it is economical and consistently performs well.

The .357 Magnum was developed from the earlier .38 Special. This was possible because the .38 Special was introduced in 1898 and originally designed to use black powder, which requires two-to-five times as much powder by volume to produce the same velocity with the same bullet as does the much more efficient smokeless powder. Thus, the .38 Special has a relatively large case capacity, and for lower pressures ( Pmax piezo pressure). The 9×19mm Parabellum was introduced in 1902 and was originally designed to use smokeless powder, and for higher pressures ( Pmax piezo pressure). It therefore produces considerably more energy than the .38, despite its case having less than half the powder capacity. Many .38 Special loads use the same powders, in similar charge weights, but because the case is so much larger, light-target loads with fast-burning powders may only fill the case perhaps 1/8 full. Filling the case with slower-burning powders produces much more power, but also much more pressure; far too much pressure for older, smaller-frame revolvers chambered in .38 Special. It was to accommodate these high-pressure, high-power loads that the longer .357 Magnum, together with the stronger revolvers designed to handle it, were developed.

The .357 SIG, developed in 1994, was named &quot;357&quot; to highlight its intended purpose: to duplicate the performance of .357 Magnum loads fired from revolvers, in a cartridge designed to be used in a semi-automatic pistol.

<doc id="532607" wikidata="Q1133472" url="?curid=532607" title="Uncontrolled format string">
<text>Uncontrolled format string is a type of code injection vulnerability discovered around 1989 that can be used in security exploits. Originally thought harmless, format string exploits can be used to crash a program or to execute harmful code. The problem stems from the use of unchecked user input as the format string parameter in certain C functions that perform formatting, such as codice_1. A malicious user may use the codice_2 and codice_3 format tokens, among others, to print data from the call stack or possibly other locations in memory. One may also write arbitrary data to arbitrary locations using the codice_4 format token, which commands codice_5 and similar functions to write the number of bytes formatted to an address stored on the stack.

==Details==
A typical exploit uses a combination of these techniques to take control of the instruction pointer (IP) of a process, for example by forcing a program to overwrite the address of a library function or the return address on the stack with a pointer to some malicious shellcode. The padding parameters to format specifiers are used to control the number of bytes output and the codice_3 token is used to pop bytes from the stack until the beginning of the format string itself is reached. The start of the format string is crafted to contain the address that the codice_4 format token can then overwrite with the address of the malicious code to execute.

This is a common vulnerability because format bugs were previously thought harmless and resulted in vulnerabilities in many common tools. MITRE&#x27;s CVE project lists roughly 500 vulnerable programs as of June 2007, and a trend analysis ranks it the 9th most-reported vulnerability type between 2001 and 2006.

Format string bugs most commonly appear when a programmer wishes to output a string containing user supplied data (either to a file, to a buffer, or to the user). The programmer may mistakenly write codice_8 instead of codice_9. The first version interprets codice_10 as a format string, and parses any formatting instructions it may contain. The second version simply prints a string to the screen, as the programmer intended. Both versions behave identically in the absence of format specifiers in the string, which makes it easy for the mistake to go unnoticed by the developer.

Format bugs arise because C&#x27;s argument passing conventions are not type-safe. In particular, the codice_11 mechanism allows functions to accept any number of arguments (e.g. codice_12) by &quot;popping&quot; as many arguments off the call stack as they wish, trusting the early arguments to indicate how many additional arguments are to be popped, and of what types.

Format string bugs can occur in other programming languages besides C, such as Perl, although they appear with less frequency and usually cannot be exploited to execute code of the attacker&#x27;s choice.

== History ==
Format bugs were first noted in 1989 by the fuzz testing work done at the University of Wisconsin, which discovered an &quot;interaction effect&quot; in the C shell (csh) between its command history mechanism and an error routine that assumed safe string input.

The use of format string bugs as an attack vector was discovered in September 1999 by Tymm Twillman during a security audit of the ProFTPD daemon. The audit uncovered an codice_13 that directly passed user-generated data without a format string. Extensive tests with contrived arguments to printf-style functions showed that use of this for privilege escalation was possible. This led to the first posting in September 1999 on the Bugtraq mailing list regarding this class of vulnerabilities, including a basic exploit. It was still several months, however, before the security community became aware of the full dangers of format string vulnerabilities as exploits for other software using this method began to surface. The first exploits that brought the issue to common awareness (by providing remote root access via code execution) were published simultaneously on the Bugtraq list in June 2000 by Przemysław Frasunek and a person using the nickname &quot;tf8&quot;. They were shortly followed by an explanation, posted by a person using the nickname &quot;lamagra&quot;. &quot;Format bugs&quot; was posted to the Bugtraq list by Pascal Bouchareine in July 2000. The seminal paper &quot;Format String Attacks&quot; by Tim Newsham was published in September 2000 and other detailed technical explanation papers were published in September 2001 such as &quot;Exploiting Format String Vulnerabilities&quot;, by team Teso.

== Prevention in compilers ==
Many compilers can statically check format strings and produce warnings for dangerous or suspect formats. In the GNU Compiler Collection, the relevant compiler flags are, codice_14,codice_15, codice_16, codice_17, codice_18, and codice_19.

Most of these are only useful for detecting bad format strings that are known at compile-time. If the format string may come from the user or from a source external to the application, the application must validate the format string before using it. Care must also be taken if the application generates or selects format strings on the fly. If the GNU C library is used, the codice_20 parameter can be used to detect certain types of attacks occurring at run-time. The codice_18 check is more stringent.

== Detection ==

Contrary to many other security issues, the root cause of format string vulnerabilities is relatively easy to detect in x86-compiled executables: For codice_12-family functions, proper use implies a separate argument for the format string and the arguments to be formatted. Faulty uses of such functions can be spotted by simply counting the number of arguments passed to the function; an &quot;argument deficiency&quot; is then a strong indicator that the function was misused.

=== Detection in x86-compiled binaries ===

Counting the number of arguments is often made easy on x86 due to a calling convention where the caller removes the arguments that were pushed onto the stack by adding to the stack pointer after the call, so a simple examination of the stack correction yields the number of arguments passed to the codice_12-family function.&#x27;

<text>Hans Fischerkoesen, also known as Hans Fischerkösen or Hans Fischer (18 May 1896 – 23 April 1973) was a German commercial animator. Fischerkoesen is considered an animation pioneer, due to the inventions and innovations he applied to animation technology, especially the use of three-dimensional elements in his animations. Later he becomes Germany&#x27;s most influential cartoonist, often nicknamed “Germany’s Walt Disney” alongside Rolf Kauka. He won both first and second prizes at a Dutch-sponsored international competition in 1937, for advertising films (the runners up included George Pal and Alexander Alexeieff ). By 1956 he had won major prizes at commercial film festivals in Rome, Milan (three times), Venice, Monte Carlo and Cannes. Most notable was the participation in the 1st Berlin International Film Festival, where Fischerkoesen&#x27;s film &quot;Blick ins Paradies&quot; won the Bronze Medal (Advertising Film) award.

== Early life ==
Hans Fischer was born on 18 May 1896 in the small town of Bad Kösen, near Naumburg, at the River Saale in the German state of Saxony. Because the name “Fischer” was a very common name in the film industry, he later created the alias of Fischerkoesen, by combining his name – Fischer and his birthplace - Kösen, in order to distinguish himself from others. His father was a middle-class entrepreneur, dealing with building materials. He was a sensitive child, affected by asthma, which determined his parents to spoil both him and his sister Leni, by creating puppet shows and home entertainment, thus they developed a taste for fantasy and spectacle. Confined in bed most of his childhood by this bad case of asthma, he developed a great passion for drawing. Later, in 1916 he and his equally talented sister Leni, attended for three years the Academy of Graphic Arts, in Leipzig. Over the years, Leni was Fischerkoesen&#x27;s closest collaborator on many animation film projects.

During the First World War, Fischerkoesen could not serve as a soldier because of his asthma, but he worked in army hospitals near to the front line where he witnessed the shocking horrors of trench warfare. Profoundly impressed by these terrifying experiences, at his return home when the war was ended, Fischerkoesen planned to make an animation film, &quot;Das Loch im Westen (The Hole in the West)&quot;, which would expose the war profiteer as the real cause of the war. Thus, he spent months drawing about 1600 sequential images, designed his own animation stand and shot the animation movie himself, and successfully sold it to a local distributor for 3,000 marks which allowed him to pursue an animation career. &quot;Hole in the West,&quot; Fischerkoesen&#x27;s first film, premiered in 1919 and made history as the first animated film ever produced in Germany.

== Commercial Animator Career ==
In 1921, Fischerkoesen launched a highly successful advertising career with an ad for the Leipzig shoe factory Nordheimer, &quot;Bummel –Petrus (Strolling Peter).&quot; In the same year he made another three animated advertising ads: &quot;Die Entführung&quot; and &quot;König Grogs Löwenabenteuer&quot; (both Transocean-Film) and &quot;Professor Sprit&quot; (Dux- Film). The success led to a two-year contract with Julius Pinschewer, owner of the leading Berlin advertising company Werbefilm G.m.b.H.-Pinschewer, who had pioneered the use of animated commercials in movie theatres back in 1911. As a result of this collaboration, he produced &quot;Die Besteigung des Himalaja&quot; (1923&quot;), Abbau auch im Harem&quot; (1924), &quot;Brand im Wolkenkratzer&quot; (1924), &quot;Glück auf!&quot; (1924), Der &quot;Glücksvogel&quot; (1924), &quot;Im Urwald&quot; (1924), &quot;Nunak, die Eskima&quot; (1924), &quot;Der Pfennig muss es bringen&quot; (1924), &quot;Sonnenersatz&quot; (1924), &quot;Das Zauberpferd&quot; (1924), &quot;Der kluge Dackel&quot; (1925), &quot;Jette’s Ausgang&quot; (1925), &quot;Meier glüht&quot; (1925), &quot;Der kluge Einfall&quot; (1925), &quot;Das Seegespenst&quot; (1925), &quot;Die Geschichte vom Scholokadenkasper&quot; (1926), &quot;Auf der Skitour&quot; (1926) and many other. Probably, the most important film of this period was &quot;Der Pfennig muss es bringen (The penny must bring it)&quot;, an advertisement for the German Saving Bank and the Giro Co-operative Bank done in November 1924, which would fuel the later accusation of collaboration with the Nazi regime as both banks were to become an integral part of the Nazi plan for funding the war. Fischerkoesen worked for Pinschewer until 1928, when he temporarily worked for the propaganda film society “Epoche”, shortly after starting to work at Ufa&#x27;s (Universum Film AG) propaganda department. After becoming chief draughtsman, he established his own studio in Potsdam.

In 1931, Fischerkoesen was celebrated by a Leipzig newspaper, with an article entitled “&quot;Watch out Mickey Mouse, Felix the Cat, and Co.”,&quot; article illustrated with images from his ads, such as a cow with a lyre built into her horns, a bull in a tuxedo or an Art-Deco style kangaroo ballet. He continued his successful advertising career and made over 1000 publicity films, most of which are unfortunately lost. However, he did not limit just to commercials and advertising films, but he contributed with several animated sequences to culture films and he has done as well military training films for the Army High Command (OKW) and Mars-Film G.m.b.H.

== The Nazi Era ==
Although the installation of the Nazi regime in 1933 did not affect too much of Fischerkoesen’s activity, the outbreak of the Second World War pushed his career on the verge of collapse, as the products that he had promoted so successfully were increasingly becoming luxury items. The decline was accentuated in 1941, when Joseph Goebbels, head of the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda (&quot;Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda&quot;) decided, through an order issued on October 14 by the &quot;Werberat&quot; (Advertising Council of German Industry), to prohibit advertising of so-called &quot;Mangelware&quot; (scarce goods, especially food and clothes). With no future in the advertising industry, Fischerkoesen saw his career taking an unexpected turn as both Hitler and Goebbels loved cinema in general and they had a great passion for animated cartoons, especially for Walt Disney’s productions, and dreamed to create a German animated film industry bigger and better than the one in the United States. Thus, on 25 June 1941 Goebbels founded a new animated film company &quot;Deutsche Zeichentrickfilme G.m.b.H&quot; (DZF), regarded as an important war facility which offered training for young cartoonists.

The German Animation Film Company (DZF) was aimed to start the production of feature-length animated films by 1947 and the successful animator Fischerkoesen was a natural choice to be involved in this strategic project. In this context, Fischerkoesen was required to move his staff and studio to Potsdam, near UFA’s studios. Fischerkoesen did not reject a collaboration with the Nazi propaganda machine, but he argued that he was not really talented to invent ideas for story films as he was experienced in the advertising industry. Consequently, he was assigned to work with Horst von Mollendorf, a popular Berlin newspaper cartoonist who was expected to help him with the scrips for the future animations. In these circumstances, Fischerkoesen was commissioned by Goebbels to create cartoons that were technologically equal or better than Disney’s animations, and received enough funding to produce his three most important and costly films: &quot;Die Verwitterte Melodie (Weather-Beaten Melody)&quot; in 1942, &quot;Der Schneemann (The Snowman)&quot; in 1943 and &quot;Das dumme Gänslein&quot; &quot;(The Silly Goose)&quot; in 1944. All three films respected Goebbels’ directives, as they were made without spoken dialogue, so it was easy to be played internationally without costly subtitles synchronisation, and used the “three dimensional” effects (especially &quot;The Snowman&quot; was highly appreciated during the rule of the National Socialists).

&quot;Weather-Beaten Melody&quot; or &quot;Scherzo&quot; tells the story of a wasp who discovers an abandoned gramophone in a meadow and, with its stinger manages to make it play the Foxtrott &quot;Wenn die Woche keinen Sonntag hätt (If the Week had no Sunday).&quot; &quot;Der Schneemann&quot; presents the adventures of a special snowman, a “humanly” one with a warm spot in his heart who after seeing pictures with the summer in a calendar, decided to see the warm season at any costs and ended melted in July. For the last short animation of the series, &quot;The Silly Goose,&quot; Fischerkoesen preferred to renounce his collaboration with Horst von Mollendorf, and produced the film on his own. The film tells the story of a vain goose who ventures beyond the borders of the farmhouse where she lived and nearly ended killed by a fox. In contrast to the first two short animations, in this last film can be noticed several antisemitic symbols, such as the fox who represents the “malicious Jew”, or the well-known Yiddish song &quot;Bei Mir Bistu Shein&quot; played in the background while the fox attempt to ambush the undisciplined goose.

The animations satisfied Goebbels’ expectations, thanks to their technical qualities and to the message transmitted, similar to the Nazi ideology of &quot;Blut und Boden&quot; (Blood and Soil), which glorified the simplicity and the virtue of the rural life, the return to the nature and required everyone to stay where they belong. On the other hand, elements which indicate a relative insubordination to the Nazi rhetoric can be found, such as the forbidden jazz music in &quot;Die verwitterte Melodie&quot;, the snowman’s anticipation of better days in &quot;Der Schneemann&quot; or the ambiguous narrative created in &quot;Das Dumme Ganslein.&quot;

== Post Second World War Career ==
When the Second World War ended, Fischerkösen was arrested by the Russian troops under the suspicion of Nazi collaboration and was kept for three years in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, until he proved not just that he was not a Nazi sympathizer, but that he was actually part of an underground resistance group of artists. During the imprisonment time he was detached to work in the kitchen and in order to survive captivity he occasionally drew portraits of the Soviet guards in exchange for a piece of bread, or to maintain a good morale he painted allegorical murals using vegetable caricatures, which are now preserved as a national historical monument. Released in 1948, Fischerkoesen fled with his wife and two children from the Soviet-controlled zone of Germany to the French-controlled sector, where he returned to his pre-Nazi career, founding Fischerkoesen-Studios in Mehlem. He became Germany’s leading producer of animated commercials and his notoriety and success was recognized by a cover story in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, on 29 August 1956. By the mid-1960s, due to the development of television and the request for shorter and snappier clips, Fischerkoesen found it more difficult to keep up with the modern times, thus his commercials became briefer. Fischerkoesen Studios were closed in 1972, just a year before his death, but his son reorganized it and developed it into a new company. Hans Fischerkösen died of a stroke at the age of 76, on 25 April 1973.

<text>The Thousand Islands International Bridge () is an American-maintained international bridge system over the Saint Lawrence River connecting northern New York in the United States with southeastern Ontario in Canada. Constructed in 1937, with additions in 1959, the bridges span the Canada–US border in the middle of the Thousand Islands region. All bridges in the system carry two lanes of traffic, one in each direction, with pedestrian sidewalks.

==Structure==
The Thousand Islands International Bridge system is a series of five bridges spanning the St. Lawrence River. From south to north, they are:
# American mainland to Wellesley Island (main span)
# Wellesley Island to Hill Island (international crossing)
# Hill Island to Constance Island
# Constance Island to Georgina Island
# Georgina Island to Canadian mainland

The system&#x27;s southern end connects with Interstate 81 and the northern end with Highway 401 via Highway 137. There is also an interchange with the Thousand Islands Parkway on the Ontario side.

The actual international border bridge crossing is a set of two parallel bridges between Wellesley Island in the United States and Hill Island in Canada.

==Administration==
The bridge system is administered by the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority, a New York State public benefit corporation, whose seven board members (Four Americans and three Canadians) are appointed by the Jefferson County Board of Legislators. The Authority also maintains and administers Boldt Castle.

Tolls are paid only by cash, E-ZPass, or Commuter Discount Fare Trip Tags, which are prepaid for either 16 trips (US$20.00) or 72 trips (US$32.00). The Bridge Authority is a member of the multi-state E-ZPass consortium, and introduced electronic toll collection in June 2019. No other ETC transponders are currently offered or accepted, although the Bridge Authority offers sales of transponders of Florida&#x27;s SunPass for the convenience of Canadian travelers en route to Florida.

==Border crossing==
The Thousand Islands Border Crossing connects the towns of Alexandria Bay, New York and Ivy Lea, Ontario at the Thousand Islands Bridge.

It is the westernmost of the three St. Lawrence River crossings, and is very busy, with up to two-hour waits in the summer. The US border station at Alexandria Bay is sometimes called Thousand Islands. The Canada border station of Lansdowne is sometimes called Gananoque, for the nearby town where international ferry service is provided. These border stations are also responsible for inspecting vessel traffic between the countries. The US has seasonal vessel inspection stations on Heart Island and at Cape Vincent, NY, and Canada has seasonal vessel inspection stations at Rockport, Ontario and Gananoque, Ontario. Both Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) travel to selected ports and marinas on request for inspections.

==History==
The entire Thousand Islands Bridge system took sixteen months to build, beginning with a ground-breaking on April 30, 1937. Completed ten weeks ahead of schedule, the bridges opened on August 18, 1938, with the ribbon cut by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. Its total cost was $3.05 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars).

Shortly after opening, the bridge displayed aerodynamic oscillation problems that were quickly corrected via structural upgrades.

In its first year of operation, over 118,000 vehicles crossed the bridge. Today, annual crossings exceed 2,000,000 vehicles.

<doc id="532618" wikidata="Q642501" url="?curid=532618" title="Scary Movie 2">
<text>Scary Movie 2 is a 2001 American supernatural parody film directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. It is the sequel to &quot;Scary Movie&quot; and the second film in the &quot;Scary Movie&quot; film series. The film stars Anna Faris, Regina Hall, Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans (all reprising their roles from the first film, despite their characters having been killed), as well as Tim Curry, Tori Spelling, Chris Elliott, Chris Masterson, Kathleen Robertson, David Cross and James Woods. The film was the last in the series to feature the involvement of stars Marlon and Shawn Wayans, and director Keenen until the upcoming sixth installment. Marlon would eventually go on to produce a similar horror-themed parody, &quot;A Haunted House&quot;, and its sequel, both starring himself. In the latter film, Wayans pokes fun at the &quot;Scary Movie&quot; series&#x27; decline in quality after his family&#x27;s departure.

Where the original film was mainly based on the slasher films of the 1990s, &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; parodies an array of supernatural and haunted house films from various decades, namely &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1999), &quot;Stigmata&quot; (1999), &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973), &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975), &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; (1979), &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (1982), &quot;The Legend of Hell House&quot; (1973), &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; (both the 1959 and 1999 versions), &quot;The Changeling&quot; (1980), &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; (2000) and &quot;Bloodbath at the House of Death&quot; (1984) while also making many references to the slasher flick &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1998). It also spoofs the comedy film &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot; (2000) and some contemporary films, such as &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001), &quot;Hollow Man&quot; (2000) and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000).

&quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; was commercially successful, grossing $141.2 million worldwide from a $45 million budget, but received largely negative reviews from critics. A sequel was released in 2003, to slightly better reviews from critics.

== Plot ==
At the haunted mansion Hell House, teenager Megan Voorhees becomes possessed by the spirit of Hugh Kane, the house&#x27;s cruel, wicked previous owner. She interrupts a formal dinner party, thrown by her mother, who seeks help from two priests, Fathers McFeely and Harris. After an unsuccessful attempt to exorcise Kane&#x27;s ghost, McFeely pulls a gun and shoots Megan.

One year later, Cindy Campbell, Brenda Meeks, Ray Wilkins and Shorty Meeks are at college, trying to live new lives after surviving the events of the first film. Cindy and Brenda are tagged by socially maladjusted Alex. Shorty is still the same stoner he was before. Ray, still confused about his sexuality, has two new male friends, Tommy and Buddy, the latter of whom becomes romantically interested in Cindy. She rebuffs him but agrees to be friends.

The sinister Professor Oldman and his charming paraplegic assistant, Dwight Hartman, plan to study the paranormal activity at Hell House. They recruit Cindy and her friends as test subjects under the pretense of a psychological experiment on sleep paralysis. On her drive to the mansion, Cindy listens and sings badly along to &quot;Graduation&quot; by Vitamin C whom through the radio tells her to shut up. At the mansion, Cindy encounters a foul-mouthed parrot and Hanson, a creepy caretaker with a badly malformed hand. Later, the attractive Theo joins the group. They sit down for dinner but soon lose their appetite due to Hanson&#x27;s repulsive handling of the food.

That night, Cindy hears voices directing her to a secret room, where she and Buddy discover Kane&#x27;s wife&#x27;s diary. Seeing her portrait, they note Cindy&#x27;s (slight) resemblance. Meanwhile, the others also experience bizarre encounters. Kane&#x27;s ghost has sex with Alex in her bedroom and quickly departs at the mention of commitment. Cindy gets into a fistfight with the house cat, Mr. Kittles. When Cindy tries to tell Oldman, he dismisses it and sends Theo to take Cindy to bed.

Later, Cindy is possessed by Kane&#x27;s wife, and she seduces Oldman. She quickly returns to normal, with no memory of the event. A toy clown attempts to kill Ray, but in a strange turn of events, the doll is molested by him instead. A weed-monster rolls Shorty into a joint. It proceeds to smoke him (to his enjoyment), but gets distracted and lets him escape.

The next morning, Oldman tells Dwight that no one is leaving the house despite the attacks and shows his lecherous nature. Dwight is given the only house keys and told to give them to nobody. Theo offers oral sex to no avail; Dwight does it to himself. She knocks him out and takes the keys.

Oldman is seduced and killed by the ghost of Kane&#x27;s mistress, Victoria Crane. Shorty later encounters the same ghost but charms and has sex with her. After Dwight equips the teens with weapons that can injure their spectral enemy, they are pursued throughout the mansion, Alex attempts to win Kane&#x27;s love, but is killed by Crane&#x27;s ghost. Buddy and Cindy are locked in the walk-in freezer. Cindy uses a collection of random objects to produce a Caterpillar 2-Ton tractor and escapes the freezer. Hanson becomes possessed by Kane and kidnaps an inebriated Shorty. Cindy, Brenda, and Theo team up to battle him with highly stylized fight choreography but are defeated. Dwight regroups with the teens, and Cindy volunteers to act as bait to lure Kane into a device that will destroy him. The plan succeeds, freeing the group from the house&#x27;s curse.

Two months later, Cindy and Buddy are in a relationship. They are out on a walk when Hanson appears to take her away with him. Buddy disappears as Hanson gets hit by a car, driven by Shorty.

== Production ==
The film is a sequel to &quot;Scary Movie&quot;. According to director Keenen Ivory Wayans, the filmmakers watched over 130 horror films for background research. Marlon Brando was originally cast as Father McFeely and completed one day of filming before he had to leave the production due to illness. He was replaced by James Woods who was paid $1 million for four days work.
Charlton Heston had also turned down the Woods role. At one point, former President Bill Clinton, who had just left office the year the film came out, was also considered.

Because Miramax had not greenlit this sequel until the massive box office success of the first, the film faced a punishing production schedule that involved coming up with a script and tearing through production and post-production in a total of less than nine months, roughly half the average time for all those steps to be completed on a standard Hollywood production in 2000–2001. It was this rushed production that made the Wayans never want to make another &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, and they were not involved in any of the sequels.

== Music ==
Unlike its predecessor, the film does not have an official soundtrack. It features a heavily hip hop and rap catalogue, with some rock and techno songs.

* &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (Jerry Herman)
* &quot;Shake Ya Ass&quot; – Mystikal
* &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; – Mike Oldfield
* &quot;I Walk Alone&quot; – Oleander
* &quot;Killer Bee&quot; – Meeks
* &quot;If I Had No Loot&quot; – Tony! Toni! Toné!
* &quot;Givin&#x27; My Dick Away&quot; – Trace
* &quot;Holiday Party&quot; – Big Daddy
* &quot;Sorry Now&quot; – Sugar Ray
* &quot;Evel Knieval&quot; – Ceasefire V Deadly Avenger
* &quot;U Know What&#x27;s Up&quot; – Donell Jones
* &quot;Graduation (Friends Forever)&quot; – Vitamin C
* &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot; – Eve featuring Gwen Stefani
* &quot;History Repeating&quot; – Propellerheads featuring Shirley Bassey
* &quot;Fever&quot; – Richard Marino &amp; His Orchestra
* &quot;Insane in the Brain&quot; – Cypress Hill
* &quot;Smack My Bitch Up&quot; – The Prodigy
* &quot;Skullsplitter&quot; – Hednoize

The film was released on VHS and DVD by Buena Vista Home Entertainment under the Dimension Home Video banner on December 18, 2001, with an array of special features, including commentaries and various deleted scenes.

==Legal disputes==
Over 10 years, Alfa Group has found itself in legal battle with business partners from Canada (NoreX), Great Britain (BP), Sweden (TeliaSonera), Norway (Telenor), Turkey and Indonesia. Federal Reserve executive Paul Volcker has accused Alfa Group of violation of the UN sanctions against Iraq during Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime, and for pressure exercised against KPMG during their spring 2005 investigation of a Bermuda registered, Russian telecom company, Ipoc International. To counter the Bermuda government supported audit by KPMG of Ipoc International, Alfa Group hired Diligence, founded by Richard Burt and Lord Powell of Bayswater with Diligence Europe headed by Michael Howard. Diligence began its Project Yucca to infiltrate KPMG. The Bermuda government accused Diligence of impersonating secret service personnel to obtain KPMG information about KPMG&#x27;s audit of IPOC International Growth Fund Ltd. The Bermuda government accused Alfa Group&#x27;s Ipoc International of money laundering. Alfa Group stated that Diligence was not hired by Alfa Group but by BGR which was founded by Haley Barbour. BGR had worked for Alfa Group&#x27;s telecom Altimo. Project Yucca ended on October 18, 2005, when KPMG received papers from Project Yucca. During Project Yucca, the shareholders of Diligence were CEO Nick Day who was a former British agent, Chairman of Diligence Richard Burt who was a former United States ambassador to Germany under Reagan, the Exxel Group which is a Buenos Aires private equity firm, and Edward Mathias from Carlyle Group which is a private equity company from Washington, D.C.

==Dispute with NoreX and BP==
Alfa Group&#x27;s legal disputes with BP date back to 1991, when the Canadian oil company Norex represented a newly formed, Russian-Canadian joint venture in Siberia&#x27;s oil industry, operating the marginal Chernogor oil-fields close to Khanty-Mansijsk. With the Russian company Chernogorneft, the Canadian company entered into a 60% ownership in the joint-venture Yugraneft. Later on, NoreX increased their stake to 97,64%, and in September 1998 Chernogorneft was filed with bankruptcy by the Tyumen Oil Company (TNK). The arbitration court of Khanty-Mansinsk proclaimed for Chernegorneft a new chief executive officer, with a background from Alfa Group. The main owner of Chernogorneft was BP, via their holding company Sidanko.

TNK gained control over 60% of Chernogorneft&#x27;s debts, and the debt of US$35 million held by EBRD was reduced to US$9 million by Khanty-Mansijsk arbitration court on 30 July 1999. Thereby, TNK controlled 60% of the debt claims, and according to NoreX the Alfa Group took over Chernogorneft&#x27;s oil sales below market prices. Resulting in a forced sell-out of the company, Sidanko (BP) was rejected from taking part in auctions, and remaining bidders were legally restrained from offering more than US$200 million for Chernegorneft - a mere fifth of its assumed value. On 26 November 1999, TNK took over all of Chernorogneft for US$172 million.

Letters of protest from prime minister Tony Blair to president Vladimir Putin helped little, the legally BP-owned company was forcibly sold to TNK below market price. TNK also got approval from the Khanty-Mansijsk arbitration court to take over Chernogorneft&#x27;s stakes in two joint ventures, in spite of protests from venture partners Norex and Occidental Petroleum. BP fought on for years to retrieve its rightful ownership in Chernogorneft, and in August 2001 this got its first legal approval.

In 2000, according to NoreX, TNK started to undermine Yugraneft&#x27;s oil transports through the national semi-monopolistic pipeline system Transneft. On 11 April and 26 June 2001, TNK again got two legal victories in the Khanty-Mansijsk arbitration court, first through a reversal of earlier regulation regarding Chernogorneft&#x27;s stock capital in the joint-venture, and thereafter through a nullification of the voting powers in 497,142 out of the 600,000 shares held by NoreX. At an extraordinary annual assembly of Yugraneft on 28 June, NoreX&#x27; candidate for the CEO position was elected, but the day after TNK&#x27;s security executive and 20 heavily armed guards appeared at the Yugraneft office with a false annual assembly protocol, installing Mr. A. Berman as CEO of Yugraneft. In June 2001, Yugraneft&#x27;s owner Alex Rotzang contended that two British Virgin Islands shell companies &quot;Quenon investments limited&quot; and &quot;Shapburg limited&quot; which are closely associated with Mikhail Fridman and Alfa Group illegally gained control of Yugraneft through an armed seizure of Yugraneft&#x27;s offices. In 1998, both Quenon and Shapburg formed the Luxembourg based &quot;Compagnie Financiere pour l&#x27;Atlantique du Nord&quot; which changed its name to &quot;Gaumur Holding&quot; in March 2000 and was entirely controlled by the &quot;Baugur Group&quot; of Iceland. Both Shapburg limited and the Gibraltar based &quot;AB Holdings limited&quot;, which is owned by Mikhail Fridman, co-founded the Alfa Bank subsidiary &quot;Alfa finance holdings SA&quot; based in Luxembourg. In March 2000, &quot;Alfa finance holdings SA&quot; succeeded &quot;AB Holdings limited&quot; as the parent holding of Alfa Bank Group. Norex&#x27; demands for investigation and nullification remained fruitless. Norex brought the case before a U.S. Federal court in New York in February 2002, demanding US$1.5 bn in redemption from TNK and Alfa Group.

The year after, BP and Alfa Group merged all their oil and gas interests into a 50/50 joint venture, in spite of BP&#x27;s legal and financial losses in the Yugraneft disputes since 1999. The new venture controlled both Sidanko og TNK from 11 February 2003. The merger implied that NoreX&#x27; stake of 97% in Yugraneft come under control of Alfa Group and BP. NoreX, thereby, saw their possessions dwindle and transferred partly to BP, and appealed for copies of BP documents before a US court. Jones Day represented its client Alfa-Access-Renova (AAR) of Len Blavatnik, Mikhail Fridman, and Viktor Vekselberg in United States court. In 2004 the U.S. Supreme Court sustained Norex&#x27; right to appeal, but at a lower level the legal dispute went on for years, with only gradual victories for NoreX.

==Dispute with Telenor==
Alfa started investing in VimpelCom in summer, 2001. The power-broking between Alfa group and Telenor in VimpelCom started 2004, when Alfa proposed that VimpelCom acquire a larger share in Ukrainian RadioSystems &quot;(URS)&quot;, a small GSM operator in Ukraine operating under the brand &quot;«WellCom»&quot;. Telenor found the price of US$132 million far too high, after the Russian telco Golden Telecom had declined acquiring URS at a far lower price. In October 2004, a minor shareholder of VimpelCom lodged three lawsuits against Telenor in the provincial city of Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, with claims that the VimpelCom shareholder agreement be cancelled, and the URS shares be acquired.

In May 2005, the Alfa Group filed a lawsuit against Telenor, via Alfa&#x27;s daughter company &quot;Eco Telecom Ltd&quot;, contesting the declination of Telenor&#x27;s three VimpelCom board members to approve the URS acquisition. Eco Telecom especially contested Telenor&#x27;s vetoing power in the VimpelCom shareholder agreement. After the trial, Alfa Group declined during four years to take part in the board of managers meetings in Ukrainian Kyivstar, thereby blocking the normal procedures of annual assemblies, approval of accounts, and payments of dividends. In 2008 Telenor achieved several legal approvals in the U.S. Federal Court of Appeal in New York, and in 2009 the Alfa Group submitted to the rulings and took up normal shareholder activity in Kyivstar. In Russian VimpelCom, however, the Alfa Group geared up its legal battle with Telenor by nominating more directors than Alfa&#x27;s capital share implied. In January 2007, a court of appeal in Geneva, Switzerland ruled that Alfa Group had violated the shareholder agreement of VimpelCom.

In November 2005, VimpelCom acquired 100% of URS, after having got approval from VimpelComs annual assembly. Thereby, the Alfa Group owns shares in both URS (&quot;Beeline Ukraina&quot;) via VimpelCom, and in Golden Telecom which operates in both Russia and Ukraine, and in Ukraine&#x27;s major mobile operator Kyivstar GSM, and in Turkish Turkcell which owns a stake in the Ukrainian mobile operator Astelit. Telenor and Alfa disagree over the latter&#x27;s ownership in three of Kyivstar&#x27;s competitors in the Ukrainian market.

In 2004, Alfa Group&#x27;s daughter company «Storm» filed a number of lawsuits against Telenor, to nullify a number of provisions in the Kyivstar charter and shareholder agreement. Alfa Group especially wanted to nullify an arbitration case that Telenor had lodged in New York, but was rejected. Alfa reacted to their legal loss by boycotting all normal shareholder activity in Kyivstar, for four years from 2004, effectively blocking the business of annual assemblies, and avoiding the consolidation and ratification of Kyivstar&#x27;s annual accounts. No dividends were paid after 2003. In February 2006, Telenor took the issue to a U.S Federal court in New York. On 16 December 2008, Alfa Group resumed normal shareholder activities, joined in the election of a new board of directors, and agreed to pay accumulated dividends. On 11 March 2009, the Federal district court in New York ruled for the second time that Alfa companies Altimo, Storm, Alpren and Hardlake had revealed contempt for the court by not depositing their Kyivstar shares in the United States. Alfa Group was convicted to daily penalties of US$100,000 from 12 March, and a further 100,000 daily if not either Alfa&#x27;s shares in Kyivstar be sold, or ownership in competing business be reduced to a maximum 5%. NeOn 28 April 2009, the New York court ruled that Alfa Group had submitted to the legal rulings. Judge Gerard E. Lynch established that Alfa Group had reduced their ownership in competing mobile operations in Ukraine.

===Farimex vs. Telenor===
In 2009 a small, Russian-owned company, Farimex Ltd, wholly owned by a Dimitrij Fridman, lodged a claim of US$5.7 bn from Telenor in compensation for Telenor&#x27;s refusal to approve VimpelCom&#x27;s acquisition of URS and market entry in Ukraine. Courts in Khanty-Mansiysk and Omsk have approved Farimex&#x27; claims and arrested Telenor&#x27;s US$1,8 bn worth shares in VimpelCom in March 2009, but Telenor refuses to accept the legal premises and appeals the verdicts to the regional court of Tyumen, which is the last court of appeal before the federal level in Moscow.

Telenor Executive vice president Jan Edvard Thygesen has repeatedly said that a swap of shares in VimpelCom and Kyivstar between Telenor and Alfa Group is an option, but hard to achieve in practice.

When Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Støre visited his Russian counterpart Sergej Lavrov in Moscow on 24 March 2009, the strife between Alfa and Telenor was elevated to become the prime issue. Still, Telenor was presented by a claim from the Russian bailiff of US$1.7 bn, on 3 April, via a Norwegian district bailiff. Three days later, Telenor asked the federal arbitration court in Moscow to sustain this action until the Tyumen court had negotiated the substantial issue.

The case between Farimex and Telenor has aroused widespread, international concern. Roland Nash, Chief of research at Renaissance Capital viewed the case as a test to the credibility of Russia&#x27;s legal system and openness to foreign investment. Russia analyst Christopher Granville views the Farimex vs. Telenor case as even more serious to Russia&#x27;s credibility than earlier legal battles. And judge Gerard E. Lynch, presiding in the New York appeal cases lodged by Telenor over Kyivstar, has criticized Alfa Group&#x27;s utilisation of remote courts in Western Siberia.

===Agreement===
In early October 2009, it became evident that Altimo (Alfa) and Telenor had for some time conducted negotiations for a solution to their conflicts. On 5 October, it was communicated that written agreement had been reached, to establish a joint holding company for VimpelCom and Kyivstar, named VimpelCom Ltd. The agreement says that the two main owners establish VimpelCom Ltd in Amsterdam and list it at the New York Stock Exchange. The holding company, and thereby VimpelCom and Kyivstar, will be owned 38,84% by Telenor and 38,46% by Altimo. The remaining stock capital, minimum 20%, is to remain free floating at any given time. The two main owners will have three board members each, and let the remaining owners appoint another three members of the Board of directors. That board of nine will appoint the holding company&#x27;s CEO after an independent, international recruitment process. The agreement depends on all legal disputed concerning VimpelCom and Kyivstar to vanish, and it depends on the Russian Federation to allow Telenor to increase its ownership in VimpelCom.

==Dispute with TeliaSonera==
Alfa Group and Swedish-Finnish TeliaSonera jointly own the Turkish mobile operator Turkcell.

In Turkey, TeliaSonera has acquired 47% of the shares in &quot;Turkcell Holding&quot;, which controlled 51% of Turkcell. Telia&#x27;s partner was the Turkish company Cukurova. TeliaSonera and Cukurova agreed on a binding shareholders&#x27; agreement in 2005, depriving Cukurova from the right to sell Turkcell shares without the prior consent of TeliaSonera, and with the latter company&#x27;s right of first priority to buy eventual shares from Cukurova. However, Cukurova sold their shares to Alfa Group that same year. Through this US$3.5 bn purchase, Alfa Group exercised control of Turkcell&#x27;s board of directors already from First quarter, 2006. In January 2007, a court of appeal in Geneva, Switzerland, ruled that Cukurova had violate the shareholder&#x27;s agreement by selling their shares on to the Alfa Group. The court demanded Cukurova to see to it that the shares be transferred back and re-sold to TeliaSonera. A court of appeal in Vienna, Austria confirmed this ruling on 7 March 2008, and repeated the demand to enter into negotiations with Alfa Group over at transfer of the shares, but with no practical results. On 7 August 2009 the International Chamber of Commerce issued an award stating that Cukurova must deliver all the remaining shares in Turkcell Holding to TeliaSonera.

==Links to the Icelandic financial crisis==

Alfa-Bank has a Luxembourg-registered subsidiary Alfa Finance Holdings. The company&#x27;s document trail shows that Shapburg Limited was a shareholder of Alfa Finance Holdings. Shapburg Limited is an anonymous Luxembourg-registered company which has been suspected of controlling important Icelandic companies. The finding was reported in 2005.

==Sanctions==
In December 2023 the EU sanctioned AlfaStrakhovanie Group.

<text>Zoophobia, or animal phobia, is the irrational fear or aversion towards non-human animals. Zoophobia is the general negative reaction to animals, but it is usually divided into many subgroups, each being of a specific type of zoophobia. Although zoophobia as a whole is quite rare, types of the fear are common. As mentioned before by Sigmund Freud, an animal phobia is one of the most frequent psychoneurotic diseases among children. Zoophobia is almost never towards mammals, but instead towards non-mammal creatures. A list of common zoophobias is shown below.

<text>The House of Dunkeld (in or &quot;of the Caledonians&quot;) is a historiographical and genealogical construct to illustrate the clear succession of Scottish kings from 1034 to 1040 and from 1058 to 1286. The line is also variously referred to by historians as &quot;The Canmores&quot; and &quot;MacMalcolm&quot;.

It is dynastically sort of a continuation to Cenél nGabráin of Dál Riata, &quot;race of Fergus&quot;, as &quot;house&quot; was an originally Celtic concept to express one of the two rival leading clans of early medieval Scotland, whose founding father is king Fergus Mor of Dalriada. This Ferguside royal clan had disputed the crown (of Dalriada, then that of Alba) against the Cenél Loairn, the later House of Moray for the preceding four or more centuries. The &quot;Cenél nGabráin&quot; were represented by the House of Alpin before Dunkeld.

Sir Iain Moncreiffe made the case that Crínán of Dunkeld was actually a kinsman of Saint Columba and thus a member of the Irish Cenél Conaill, a royal branch of the Northern Uí Néill dynasty. Christopher Cairney makes the case for a different Uí Néill descent in the Cenél nEógain. This does not exclude Crínán&#x27;s descendants from also being a (female line) continuation of the Cenél nGabráin through Bethóc.

The Dunkeld dynasty is genealogically based on Duncan I of Scotland being of a different agnatic clan to his predecessor and maternal grandfather Malcolm II of Scotland. However, sociohistorically, the reign of Duncan&#x27;s son Malcolm III of Scotland, which happens to coincide with the start of the centuries-long period of strong influence from the southern neighbour, the Kingdom of England, has been seen as a more important place to start.

==Time and features==
During the time of House of Dunkeld, succession to the Scottish throne evolved towards primogeniture instead of the Irish-Celtic tradition of tanistry and the Pictish traditions (whether they were matrilineal or not). Although the contemporaries did not have a common name for these monarchs, they were a family who formed a hereditary kingship.

Distinctive characteristics of the developments of society during this dynasty:
*Scotland was more influenced by outsiders than it had been earlier, or was to be under the kings of the House of Bruce and House of Stuart. The kingdom was contested by two established powers: the Kingdom of England and Norway. The common goal uniting the usual policies of kings of this dynasty was to balance between the two neighbours, sometimes making alliances to have some outside support (France in the Middle Ages). Wars were fought on both fronts.
*Many Norman lords and institutions were brought to Scotland, especially after the Norman conquest of England; by the end of the period, both had been in Scotland for centuries. The tribal polity evolved to a medieval feudal society, adopting legal traditions from Rome, and the elite evolved to become broadly &quot;Frankish&quot; in custom, a change strengthened by the immigration of (Anglo-Saxon) English, Normans and French.

The Dunkeld dynasty rose to rule in a time when the kingdom was fragmented, under increasing outside threats, and some monarchs started to initiate more centralized government.

The Dunkelds came to power after the two centuries of civil unrest under the House of Alpin. The first king of this new dynasty was Malcolm III of Scotland who determined that succession would be to the eldest son, not according to the rules of tanistry. This political decision reduced the conflicts inside the royal family. The Dunkelds consolidated Scotland&#x27;s union and independence as a kingdom, despite several skirmishes with the neighbouring England. The fall of the House of Dunkeld began in 1286, when Alexander III died in a horse riding accident. The king had no living sons, only one three-year-old granddaughter, Margaret, princess of Norway. Fearing the influence of king Eric II of Norway, her father, and another endless civil war, the Scottish nobles appealed to Edward I of England. Margaret was betrothed to the future Edward II of England, but died shortly afterwards on her arrival to Scotland.

The dynasty ended at a time when immigrant-originated feudal families had reached a level of prosperity almost as high as the kings and the beneficiaries of feudal system desired for a sufficient guarantee of their positions, rights and properties – even at the cost of national independence. The de Lundin family is descended in the male line from a Dunkeld prince, Robert, the bastard son of William the Lion.

== Kings of the House of Dunkeld ==
# Duncan I, r. 1034-1040
# Malcolm III, r. 1058-1093
# Donald III, r. 1093-1094 and 1094-1097
# Duncan II, r. 1094
# Edgar, r. 1097-1107
# Alexander I, r. 1107-1124
# David I, r. 1124-1153
# Malcolm IV, r. 1153-1165
# William I, r.1165-1214
# Alexander II, r.1214-1249
# Alexander III, r.1249-1286
# Margaret, r.1286

On Alexander III&#x27;s death his granddaughter Margaret (Maid of Norway) was recognised as &quot;right heir&quot;, as had been agreed in Alexander&#x27;s lifetime, but she was never inaugurated as Queen of Scots.

<text>Keenen Ivory Desuma Wayans (born June 8, 1958) is an American actor, comedian, director and filmmaker. He is a member of the Wayans family of entertainers. Wayans first came to prominence as the host and creator of the 1990–1994 Fox sketch comedy series &quot;In Living Color&quot;. He has produced, directed or written several films, starting with &quot;Hollywood Shuffle&quot;, which he cowrote, in 1987. Most of his films have included him and one or more of his siblings in the cast.

One of these films, &quot;Scary Movie&quot; (2000), which Wayans directed, was the highest-grossing movie directed by an African American until it was surpassed by Tim Story&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; in 2005. From 1997 to 1998, he hosted the talk show &quot;The Keenen Ivory Wayans Show&quot;. In 2014, he was a judge for the eighth season of &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;.

==Life and career==
Wayans was born in Harlem, New York City, son of Howell Stouten Wayans, a supermarket manager, and his wife Elvira Alethia (Green), a homemaker and social worker. He is the second of ten children. Genealogical TV show &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; revealed that his paternal line traced back to Madagascar. His father was a devout Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. The family later moved to Manhattan&#x27;s Fulton housing projects, where he primarily grew up. He attended Seward Park High School during his teenage years, and attended Tuskegee University on an engineering scholarship. He entertained his friends at college with made-up stories about life in New York. One semester before graduation, he dropped out of school to focus on comedy.

During his first set performing at The Improv in New York, Wayans met Robert Townsend, who helped him learn about the comedy business. Townsend and Wayans drove to Los Angeles together when Wayans moved to Los Angeles in 1980. Wayans worked there as an actor. He had a regular role as a soldier on the television series &quot;For Love and Honor&quot; and appeared on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; as an NFL wide receiver.

Townsend wrote, directed, and starred in the movie &quot;Hollywood Shuffle&quot;; Wayans was costar and cowriter. The movie&#x27;s success allowed him to raise the money to make &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Git You Sucka&quot;. Fox Broadcasting Company approached Wayans to offer him his own show. Wayans wanted to produce a variety show similar to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, with a cast of people of color that took chances with its content.

Fox gave Wayans a lot of freedom with the show, although Fox executives were a bit concerned about the show&#x27;s content before its debut. Wayans created, wrote, and starred in the show, &quot;In Living Color&quot;, a sketch comedy television series that originally ran on Fox from 1990 to 1994.

==Personal life==
Wayans married Daphne Polk in 2001, but the couple filed for divorce in 2004, and their divorce was finalized in December 2006.

<doc id="532653" wikidata="Q470531" url="?curid=532653" title="Seki Takakazu">
<text>, also known as , was a mathematician, samurai, and Kofu feudal officer of the early Edo period of Japan. 

Seki laid foundations for the subsequent development of Japanese mathematics, known as &quot;wasan&quot; from &quot;c.&quot;1870. He has been described as &quot;Japan&#x27;s Newton&quot;.

He created a new algebraic notation system and, motivated by astronomical computations, did work on infinitesimal calculus and Diophantine equations. Although he was a contemporary of German polymath mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz and British polymath physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton, Seki&#x27;s work was independent. His successors later developed a school dominant in Japanese mathematics until the end of the Edo period.

While it is not clear how much of the achievements of &quot;wasan&quot; are Seki&#x27;s, since many of them appear only in writings of his pupils, some of the results parallel or anticipate those discovered in Europe. For example, he is credited with the discovery of Bernoulli numbers. The resultant and determinant (the first in 1683, the complete version no later than 1710) are attributed to him.

Seki also calculated the value of pi correct to the 10th decimal place, having used what is now called the Aitken&#x27;s delta-squared process, rediscovered later by Alexander Aitken.

Seki was influenced by Japanese mathematics books such as the Jinkōki.

== Biography ==
Not much is known about Seki&#x27;s personal life. His birthplace has been indicated as either Fujioka in Gunma Prefecture, or Edo. His birth date ranges from 1635 to 1643.

Takakazu Seki was the second son of Uchiyama Shichibei Eimei, a samurai who served Tokugawa Tadanaga (徳川忠長), his mother the daughter of Yuasa Yoemon, a servant of Ando Tsushima Mamoru. Eimei in the 16th year of Kanei (寛永), 1639, was Tenshuban of Edo jō (江戸城) and vassal of Tokugawa Ieyasu (徳川家康).

Seki was born to the Uchiyama clan, a subject of Ko-shu &quot;han&quot;, and adopted into the Seki family, a subject of the &quot;shōgun&quot;. 

In the first year of Hoei (宝永), 1704, Takakazu was hatamoto (旗本). 

While in Ko-shu &quot;han&quot;, he was involved in a surveying project to produce a reliable map of his employer&#x27;s land. He spent many years in studying 13th-century Chinese calendars to replace the less accurate one used in Japan at that time.

==Career==

===Chinese mathematical roots ===
His mathematics (and &quot;wasan&quot; as a whole) was based on mathematical knowledge accumulated from the 13th to 15th centuries. The material in these works consisted of algebra with numerical methods, polynomial interpolation and its applications, and indeterminate integer equations. Seki&#x27;s work is more or less based on and related to these known methods.

Chinese algebraists discovered numerical evaluation (Horner&#x27;s method, re-established by William George Horner in the 19th century) of arbitrary-degree algebraic equation with real coefficients. By using the Pythagorean theorem, they reduced geometric problems to algebra systematically. The number of unknowns in an equation was, however, quite limited. They used notations of an array of numbers to represent a formula; for example, formula_1 for formula_2.

Later, they developed a method that uses two-dimensional arrays, representing four variables at most, but the scope of this method was limited. Accordingly, a target of Seki and his contemporary Japanese mathematicians was the development of general multivariable algebraic equations and elimination theory.

In the Chinese approach to polynomial interpolation, the motivation was to predict the motion of celestial bodies from observed data. The method was also applied to find various mathematical formulas. Seki learned this technique, most likely, through his close examination of Chinese calendars.

=== Competing with contemporaries ===

In 1671, , a pupil of in Osaka, published &quot;Kokon Sanpō Ki&quot; (古今算法記), in which he gave the first comprehensive account of Chinese algebra in Japan. He successfully applied it to problems suggested by his contemporaries. Before him, these problems were solved using arithmetical methods. In the end of the book, he challenged other mathematicians with 15 new problems, which require multi-variable algebraic equations.

In 1674, Seki published &quot;Hatsubi Sanpō&quot; (発微算法), giving solutions to all the 15 problems. The method he used is called &quot;bōsho-hō&quot;. He introduced the use of &quot;kanji&quot; to represent unknowns and variables in equations. Although it was possible to represent equations of an arbitrary degree (he once treated the 1458th degree) with negative coefficients, there were no symbols corresponding to parentheses, equality, or division. For example, formula_3 could also mean formula_4. Later, the system was improved by other mathematicians, and in the end it became as expressive as the ones developed in Europe.

In his book of 1674, however, Seki gave only single-variable equations resulting from elimination, but no account of the process at all, nor his new system of algebraic symbols. There were a few errors in the first edition. A mathematician in Hashimoto&#x27;s school criticized the work, saying &quot;only three out of 15 are correct.&quot; In 1678, , who was from Hashimoto&#x27;s school and was active in Kyoto, authored &quot;Sanpō Meiki&quot; (算法明記), and gave new solutions to Sawaguchi&#x27;s 15 problems, using his version of multivariable algebra, similar to Seki&#x27;s. To answer criticism, in 1685, , one of Seki&#x27;s pupils, published &quot;Hatsubi Sanpō Genkai&quot; (発微算法諺解), notes on &quot;Hatsubi Sanpō&quot;, in which he showed in detail the process of elimination using algebraic symbols.

The effect of the introduction of the new symbolism was not restricted to algebra. With it, mathematicians at that time became able to express mathematical results in more general and abstract way. They concentrated on the study of elimination of variables.

===Elimination theory===
In 1683, Seki pushed ahead with elimination theory, based on resultants, in the &quot;Kaifukudai no Hō&quot; (解伏題之法). To express the resultant, he developed the notion of the determinant. While in his manuscript the formula for 5×5 matrices is obviously wrong, being always 0, in his later publication, &quot;Taisei Sankei&quot; (大成算経), written in 1683–1710 with Katahiro Takebe (建部 賢弘) and his brothers, a correct and general formula (Laplace&#x27;s formula for the determinant) appears.

Tanaka came up with the same idea independently. An indication appeared in his book of 1678: some of equations after elimination are the same as resultant. In &quot;Sanpō Funkai&quot; (算法紛解) (1690?), he explicitly described the resultant and applied it to several problems. In 1690, , a mathematician active in Osaka but not in Hashimoto&#x27;s school, published &quot;Sanpō Hakki&quot; (算法発揮), in which he gave resultant and Laplace&#x27;s formula of determinant for the &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; case. The relationships between these works are not clear. Seki developed his mathematics in competition with mathematicians in Osaka and Kyoto, at the cultural center of Japan.

In comparison with European mathematics, Seki&#x27;s first manuscript was as early as Leibniz&#x27;s first commentary on the subject, which treated matrices only up to the 3x3 case. The subject was forgotten in the West until Gabriel Cramer in 1750 was brought to it by the same motivations. Elimination theory equivalent to the &quot;wasan&quot; form was rediscovered by Étienne Bézout in 1764. Laplace&#x27;s formula was established no earlier than 1750.

With elimination theory in hand, a large part of the problems treated in Seki&#x27;s time became solvable in principle, given the Chinese tradition of geometry almost reduced to algebra. In practice, the method could founder under huge computational complexity. Yet this theory had a significant influence on the direction of development of &quot;wasan&quot;. After the elimination is complete, one is left to find numerically the real roots of a single-variable equation. Horner&#x27;s method, though well known in China, was not transmitted to Japan in its final form. So Seki had to work it out by himself independently. He is sometimes credited with Horner&#x27;s method, which is not historically correct. He also suggested an improvement to Horner&#x27;s method: to omit higher order terms after some iterations. This practice happens to be the same as that of Newton–Raphson method, but with a completely different perspective. Neither he nor his pupils had, strictly speaking, the idea of derivative.

Seki also studied the properties of algebraic equations for assisting in numerical solution. The most notable of these are the conditions for the existence of multiple roots based on the discriminant, which is the resultant of a polynomial and its &quot;derivative&quot;: His working definition of &quot;derivative&quot; was the &quot;O(h)&quot; -term in &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;h&quot;), which was computed by the binomial theorem.

He obtained some evaluations of the number of real roots of a polynomial equation.

===Calculation of pi===

Another of Seki&#x27;s contributions was the rectification of the circle, i.e., the calculation of pi; he obtained a value for π that was correct to the 10th decimal place, using what is now called the Aitken&#x27;s delta-squared process, rediscovered in the 20th century by Alexander Aitken.

<text>Sheila Adele Greibach (born 6 October 1939 in New York City) is an American researcher in formal languages in computing, automata, compiler theory and computer science. She is an Emeritus Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, and notable work include working with Seymour Ginsburg and Michael A. Harrison in context-sensitive parsing using the stack automaton model.

Besides establishing the normal form (Greibach normal form) for context-free grammars, in 1965, she also investigated properties 
of W-grammars, pushdown automata, and decidability problems.

==Early career==
Greibach earned an A.B. degree (summa cum laude) in Linguistics and Applied Mathematics from Radcliffe College in 1960, and two years after achieved an A.M. degree. In 1963, she was awarded a PhD at Harvard University, advised by Anthony Oettinger with a PhD thesis entitled &quot;Inverses of Phrase Structure Generators&quot;. 

She continued to work at Harvard at the Division of Engineering and Applied Physics until 1969, when she moved to UCLA, where she has been a professor until the present (as of March 2014). Her areas of interest and research include Theoretical computer science, Computational complexity, Program schemes and semantics, Formal language, Automata, and Computability. 

==Work and contributions==

Among her students were Ronald V. Book and Michael J. Fischer.
The following list indicates some of her work. The top portion of the list is from the ACM Digital Library and the remainder from the FOCS Bibliography by David M. Jones.

&quot;Jump PDA&#x27;s, deterministic context-free languages, principal AFDLs and polynomial time recognition (Extended Abstract),&quot; Proceedings of the fifth annual ACM symposium on Theory of Computing, April 1973

:Every deterministic context-free language can be accepted by a deterministic finite delay pda with jumps. Increasing the number of types or occurrences of jumps increases the family of languages accepted with finite delay. Hence the family of deterministic context-free language is a principal AFDL; there is a context-free language formula_1 such that every context-free language is an inverse gsm image of formula_1 or formula_3.

&quot;Some restrictions on W-grammars&quot;
Proceedings of the sixth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, April 1974

:The effect of some restrictions on W-grammars (the formalization of the syntax of ALGOL 68) are explored. Two incomparable families examined at length are WRB (languages generated by normal regular-based W-grammars) and WS (languages generated by simple W-grammars). Both properly contain the context-free languages and are properly contained in the family of quasirealtime languages. In addition, WRB is closed under nested iterate ...

&quot;The Unsolvability of the Recognition of Linear Context-Free Languages,&quot; &quot;JACM,&quot; Volume 13 Issue 4, October 1966
:The problem of whether a given context-free language is linear is shown to be recursively undecidable.

&quot;Stack automata and compiling,&quot; co-authored with Seymour Ginsburg and Michael A. Harrison, &quot;JACM&quot;, January 1967, Volume 14 Issue 1

:Compilation consists of two parts, recognition and translation. A mathematical model is presented which embodies salient features of many modern compiling techniques. The model, called the stack automaton, has the desirable feature of being deterministic in nature. This deterministic device is generalized to a nondeterministic device (nondeterministic stack automaton) and particular instances of this more general device are noted. Sets accepted by nondeterministic stack automata are recursi ...

&quot;Quasi-realtime languages (Extended Abstract),&quot; co-authored with Ronald V. Book, Proceedings of the first annual ACM symposium on Theory of Computing, May 1969

:Quasi-realtime languages are the languages accepted by nondeterministic multitape Turing machines in real time. The family of quasi-realtime languages forms an abstract family of languages closed under intersection, linear erasing, and reversal. It is identical with the family of languages accepted by nondeterministic multitape Turing machines in linear time. Every quasi-realtime language can be accepted in real time by a non-deterministic one stack, one pushdown store machine, and can be e ...

&quot;One-way stack automata,&quot; co-authored with Seymour Ginsburg and Michael A. Harrison, &quot;JACM&quot;, April 1967, Volume 14 Issue 2

:A number of operations which either preserve sets accepted by one-way stack automata or preserve sets accepted by deterministic one-way stack automata are presented. For example, sequential transduction preserves the former; set complementation, the latter. Several solvability questions are also considered.

&quot;Tape- and time-bounded Turing acceptors and AFLs (Extended Abstract)&quot;
co-authored with Ronald V. Book and Ben Wegbreit, Proceedings of the second annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, May 1970

:Complexity classes of formal languages defined by time- and tape-bounded Turing acceptors are studied with the aim of showing sufficient conditions for these classes to be AFLs and to be principal AFLs.

&quot;Uniformly erasable AFL&quot;, co-authored with Seymour Ginsburg and Jonathan Goldstine, Proceedings of the fourth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, May 1972

:This paper showed that a number of well-known families have property (*). In particular, the authors proved that the family of context-free languages does indeed have this property. In addition, we show that several familiar subfamilies of the context-free languages, such as the one-counter languages, have property (*). Finally, we show that there are families satisfying (*) which are not subfamilies of the context-free languages, for we prove that any family generated from one-let ...

;Formal parsing systems
:Sheila A. Greibach
:August 1964
:Communications of the ACM, Volume 7 Issue 8

:Automatic syntactic analysis has recently become important for both natural language data processing and syntax-directed compilers. A formal parsing system G = (V, μ, T, R) consists of two finite disjoint vocabularies, V and T, a many-many map, μ, from V onto T, and a recursive set R of strings in T called syntactic sentence classes ...
