<text>Judith Miller (born January 2, 1948) is an American journalist and commentator who is known for writing about Iraq&#x27;s alleged weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program both before and after the 2003 invasion, but her writings were later discovered to have been based on fabricated intelligence. She worked in the Washington bureau of &quot;The New York Times&quot; before joining Fox News in 2008.

Miller co-wrote a book &quot;&quot;, which became a top &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller shortly after she became a victim of a hoax anthrax letter at the time of the 2001 anthrax attacks.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; determined that several stories she wrote about Iraq were inaccurate, and she was forced to resign from the paper in 2005. According to commentator Ken Silverstein, Miller&#x27;s Iraq reporting &quot;effectively ended her career as a respectable journalist&quot;. Miller defended her reporting, stating &quot;My job isn&#x27;t to assess the government&#x27;s information and be an independent intelligence analyst myself. My job is to tell readers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; what the government thought about Iraq&#x27;s arsenal.&quot; She published a memoir, &quot;The Story: A Reporter&#x27;s Journey&quot;, in April 2015.

Miller was involved in the Plame Affair, where Valerie Plame was outed as a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) spy by Richard Armitage after Plame’s husband published a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed casting doubts on claims that Saddam Hussein sought to purchase uranium from Africa. Miller spent 85 days in jail for refusing to reveal that her source in the Plame Affair was Scooter Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. Later, she contributed to the conservative Fox News Channel and Newsmax, and was a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute.

==Early life and education==
Miller was born in New York City. Her Russian-born father, Bill Miller, was Jewish. He owned the &quot;Riviera&quot; night club in New Jersey and later, he operated several casinos in Las Vegas.
Bill Miller was known for booking iconic Las Vegas performers. His biggest success was getting Elvis Presley to return to Las Vegas after initially being an unsuccessful booking. Her mother was a &quot;pretty Irish Catholic showgirl.&quot;

Miller attended Ohio State University, where she was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. She graduated from Barnard College of Columbia University in 1969 and received a master&#x27;s degree in public affairs from Princeton University&#x27;s School of Public and International Affairs. Early in her career at &quot;The New York Times&quot; bureau in Washington, D.C. she dated one of the newspaper&#x27;s other reporters (and future investment banker) Steven Rattner. In 1993, she married Jason Epstein, an editor and publisher.

Judith Miller is the half-sister of Jimmy Miller who was a record producer for many classic rock bands of the 1960s through to the 1990s including the Rolling Stones, Traffic and Blind Faith.
==Career==

During Miller&#x27;s tenure at &quot;The New York Times&quot;, she was a member of the team that won the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting, for its 2001 coverage of global terrorism before and after the September 11 attacks. She and James Risen received the award and one of the cited articles appeared under her byline.

Her writing during this period was criticised by Middle East scholar Edward Said for evincing an anti-Islamic bias. In his book &quot;Covering Islam&quot; Said stated that Miller&#x27;s book &quot;God Has Ninety-Nine Names&quot; &quot;is like a textbook of the inadequacies and distortions of media coverage of Islam.&quot; He criticised her poor grasp of Arabic, saying that &quot;nearly every time she tries to impress us with her ability to say a phrase or two in Arabic she unerringly gets it wrong... They are the crude mistakes committed by a foreigner who neither has care nor... respect for her subject.&quot; He concluded Miller fears and dislikes Lebanon, hates Syria, laughs at Libya, dismisses Sudan, feels sorry for and a little alarmed by Egypt and is repulsed by Saudi Arabia. She hasn&#x27;t bothered to learn the language and is relentlessly only concerned with the dangers of Islamic militancy, which, I would hazard a guess, accounts for less than 5 percent of the billion-strong Islamic world.

===Anthrax hoax victim===
On October 12, 2001, Miller opened an anthrax hoax letter mailed to her &quot;New York Times&quot; office. The 2001 anthrax attacks had begun occurring in the wake of the September 11 attacks in 2001, with anthrax-laced letters sent to ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, and the &quot;New York Post&quot;, all in New York City, as well as the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; in Boca Raton, Florida. Two additional letters (with a higher grade of anthrax) were sent on October 9, 2001, to Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy in Washington.

Miller was the only major U.S. reporter, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; was the only major U.S. media organization, to be the target of a fake anthrax letter in the fall of 2001. Miller had reported extensively on the subject of biological threats and had co-authored, with Stephen Engelberg and William Broad, a book on bio-terrorism, &quot;&quot;, which was published on October 2, 2001. Miller co-authored an article on Pentagon plans to develop a more potent version of weaponized anthrax, &quot;U.S. Germ Warfare Research Pushes Treaty Limits&quot;, published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on September 4, 2001, weeks before the first anthrax mailings.

===Islamic charities search leak===
Shortly after the September 11 attacks, the U.S. government was considering adding the Holy Land Foundation to a list of organizations with suspected links to terrorism and was planning to search the premises of the organization. The information about the impending raid was given to Miller by a confidential source. On December 3, 2001, Miller telephoned the Holy Land Foundation for comment, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article in the late edition papers and on its website that day. The next day, the government searched HLF&#x27;s offices. These occurrences led to a lawsuit brought by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, with prosecutors claiming that Miller and her colleague Philip Shenon had queried this Islamic charity, and another, in ways that made them aware of the planned searches.

===The Iraq War===
At &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Miller wrote on security issues, particularly about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. Many of these stories later turned out to have been based upon faulty information. (One of her stories that was not disproved reported that inspectors in Iraq &quot;saw nothing to prompt a war.&quot;)

On September 8, 2002, Miller and her &quot;Times&quot; colleague Michael R. Gordon reported the interception of &quot;aluminum tubes&quot; bound for Iraq. Her front-page story quoted unnamed &quot;American officials&quot; and &quot;American intelligence experts&quot; who said the tubes were intended to be used to enrich nuclear material, and cited unnamed &quot;Bush administration officials&quot; who said that, in recent months, Iraq had &quot;stepped up its quest for nuclear weapons and [had] embarked on a worldwide hunt for materials to make an atomic bomb&quot;. Miller added that

Mr. Hussein&#x27;s dogged insistence on pursuing his nuclear ambitions, along with what defectors described in interviews as Iraq&#x27;s push to improve and expand Baghdad&#x27;s chemical and biological arsenals, have brought Iraq and the United States to the brink of war.

Shortly after Miller&#x27;s article was published, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, and Donald Rumsfeld appeared on television and pointed to Miller&#x27;s story in support of their position. As summarized by &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;in the following months, the tubes would become a key prop in the administration&#x27;s case for war, and the &quot;Times&quot; played a critical part in legitimizing it.&quot; Miller later said of the controversy

[M]y job isn&#x27;t to assess the government&#x27;s information and be an independent intelligence analyst myself. My job is to tell readers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; what the government thought about Iraq&#x27;s arsenal.

In an April 21, 2003 article, Miller, ostensibly on the basis of statements from the military unit in which she was embedded, reported claims allegedly made by an Iraqi scientist that Iraq had kept biological and chemical weapons until &quot;right before the invasion.&quot; This report was covered extensively in the press. Miller went on &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot; and stated:

Well, I think they found something more than a smoking gun. What they&#x27;ve found is a silver bullet in the form of a person, an Iraqi individual, a scientist, as we&#x27;ve called him, who really worked on the programs, who knows them firsthand, and who has led MET Alpha people to some pretty startling conclusions.

There was strong internal dissent amongst other &quot;Times&quot; reporters regarding publication of the inflammatory, unsourced accusations, however, and that the military were allowed to censor it before it appeared. A week after it appeared, one &quot;Times&quot; insider called Miller&#x27;s piece &quot;wacky-assed&quot; and complained there were &quot;real questions about it and why it was on page 1.&quot;

On May 26, 2003, Howard Kurtz of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported on a Miller internal email sent to John Burns, the &quot;Times&quot;″ Baghdad bureau chief. In it she admitted her source regarding the alleged WMDs, according to Seymour Hersh writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, was none other than Ahmed Chalabi&#x27;s Iraqi National Congress, which alleges Pentagon officials passed on to Miller, despite the Central Intelligence Agency disagreeing with its content. Her &quot;Times&quot; editor, Andrew Rosenthal, criticized Kurtz for its release.

A year later, on May 26, 2004, a week after the U.S. government apparently severed ties with Chalabi, a &quot;Times&quot; editorial acknowledged that some of the paper&#x27;s coverage in the run-up to the war had relied too heavily on Chalabi and other Iraqi exiles, who were bent on regime change. The editorial also expressed &quot;regret&quot; that &quot;information that was controversial [was] allowed to stand unchallenged.&quot; However, the editorial explicitly rejected &quot;blame on individual reporters.&quot;

On May 27, 2004, the day after the &quot;Times&quot;″ &quot;mea culpa&quot;, James C. Moore quoted Miller in an article in &quot;Salon&quot;:

You know what, ... I was proved fucking right. That&#x27;s what happened. People who disagreed with me were saying, &#x27;There she goes again.&#x27; But I was proved fucking right.&quot;

The statement about being &quot;proved ... right&quot; was in relation to another Miller story, wherein she had written trailers found in Iraq had been shown to be mobile weapons labs. However that claim, too, was subsequently refuted as false.

It was alleged later in &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; that, while Miller&#x27;s reporting &quot;frequently [did] not meet published &quot;Times&quot; standards&quot;, she was not sanctioned and was given a relatively free rein, because she consistently delivered frequent front-page scoops for the paper by &quot;cultivating top-ranking sources.&quot;

In 2005, facing federal court proceedings for refusing to divulge a source in the Plame affair criminal investigation, Miller spent 85 days in jail in Alexandria, Va. (where French terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui was also held). After her release, the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; Public Editor Byron Calame wrote:

Ms. Miller may still be best known for her role in a series of &quot;Times&quot; articles in 2002 and 2003 that strongly suggested Saddam Hussein already had or was acquiring an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction ... Many of those articles turned out to be inaccurate ... [T]he problems facing her inside and outside the newsroom will make it difficult for her to return to the paper as a reporter. 

Two weeks later, Miller negotiated a private severance package with &quot;Times&quot;″ publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. She contested Calame&#x27;s claims about her reporting and gave no ground in defending her work. She cited &quot;difficulty&quot; in performing her job effectively after having become &quot;an integral part of the stories [she] was sent to cover.&quot;

In a 2018 interview with &quot;The Intercept&quot;, James Risen defended Miller by saying that there was a &quot;systemic problem at the paper&quot; in regards to reporting about the existence of WMD&#x27;s. He said the paper wanted &quot;stories about the existence of WMD&quot; rather than &quot;skeptical stories&quot;.

=== Contempt of court ===

On October 1, 2004, federal Judge Thomas F. Hogan found Miller in contempt of court for refusing to appear before a federal grand jury, which was investigating who had leaked to reporters the fact that Valerie Plame was a CIA operative. Miller did not write an article about the subject at the time of the leak, but others did, notably Robert Novak, spurring the investigation. Judge Hogan sentenced her to 18 months in jail, but stayed the sentence while her appeal proceeded. On February 15, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld Judge Hogan&#x27;s ruling. On June 17, 2005, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case. On July 6, 2005, Judge Hogan ordered Miller to serve her sentence at &quot;a suitable jail within the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia&quot;. She was taken to Alexandria City Jail on July 7, 2005.

In a separate case, Federal Judge Robert W. Sweet ruled on February 24, 2005, that Miller was not required to reveal who in the government leaked word of an impending raid to her. Patrick Fitzgerald, the same prosecutor who had had Miller jailed in the Plame case, argued that Miller&#x27;s calls to groups suspected of funding terrorists had tipped them off to the raid and allowed them time to destroy evidence. Fitzgerald wanted Miller&#x27;s phone records to confirm the time of the tip and determine who had leaked the information to Miller in the first place. Judge Sweet held that because Fitzgerald could not demonstrate in advance that the phone records would provide the information he sought the prosecutor&#x27;s needs were outweighed by a &#x27;reporter&#x27;s privilege&#x27; to keep sources confidential. On August 1, 2006, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Sweet&#x27;s decision, holding 2–1 that federal prosecutors could inspect the telephone records of Miller and Philip Shenon. Judge Ralph K. Winter, Jr. wrote: &quot;No grand jury can make an informed decision to pursue the investigation further, much less to indict or not indict, without the reporters&#x27; evidence&quot;.

Prior to her jailing for civil contempt, Miller&#x27;s lawyers argued that it was pointless to imprison her because she would never talk or reveal confidential sources. Under such circumstances, argued her lawyers, jail term would be &quot;merely punitive&quot; and would serve no purpose. Arguing that Miller should be confined to her home and could forego Internet access and cellphone use, Miller&#x27;s lawyers suggested that &quot;impairing her unrestricted ability to do her job as an investigative journalist ... would present the strictest form of coercion to her&quot;. Failing that, Miller&#x27;s lawyers asked that she be sent to a women&#x27;s facility in Danbury, Connecticut, nearer to &quot;Ms. Miller&#x27;s 76-year-old husband&quot;, retired book publisher Jason Epstein, who lived in New York City, and whose state of health was the subject of a confidential medical report filed by Miller&#x27;s attorneys. Upon being jailed, the Times reported on July 7, 2005, that Miller had purchased a cockapoo puppy to keep her husband company during her absence.

On September 17, 2005, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Miller had received a &quot;parade of prominent government and media officials&quot; during her first 11 weeks in prison, including visits by former U.S. Republican Senator Bob Dole, NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, and John R. Bolton, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. After her release on September 29, 2005, Miller agreed to disclose to the grand jury the identity of her source, Lewis Libby, Vice President Cheney&#x27;s chief of staff.

On Tuesday, January 30, 2007, Miller took the stand as a witness for the prosecution against Lewis Libby. Miller discussed three conversations she had had with Libby in June and July 2003, including the meeting on June 23, 2003. In her first appearance before the grand jury, Miller said she could not remember. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, when asked if Libby discussed Valerie Plame, Miller responded in the affirmative, &quot;adding that Libby had said Wilson worked at the agency&#x27;s (C.I.A.) division that dealt with limiting the proliferation of unconventional weapons&quot;. The trial resulted in guilty verdicts against Libby.

=== Refusal to disclose her source ===
In July 2005, several months prior to her October 2005 resignation from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Miller was jailed for contempt of court for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury which was investigating a leak in which Valerie Plame was named as a CIA officer. While Miller never wrote about Plame, she was believed to be in possession of evidence which was relevant to the leak investigation. According to a subpoena, Miller met with an unnamed government official, later revealed to be I. Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s Chief of Staff, on July 8, 2003. Plame&#x27;s CIA identity was publicly divulged in a column by conservative political commentator Robert Novak on July 14, 2003. Rather than Libby, Novak&#x27;s source was revealed to have been Richard Armitage of the Department of State.

On July 16, 2005, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Miller could face criminal contempt charges, which could have extended her jail time six months beyond the four months which were then anticipated. The &quot;Post&quot; suggested that special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was particularly interested in hearing Miller&#x27;s version of her encounter with Libby. Filings by Fitzgerald reportedly alleged that Miller&#x27;s defiance of the court constituted a crime. On September 29, 2005, after spending 85 days in jail, Miller was released following a telephone call with Libby. He had reconfirmed the release of confidentiality. Under oath, Miller was questioned by Fitzgerald before a federal grand jury the following day, September 30, 2005, but was not relieved of contempt charges until after testifying again on October 12, 2005.

For her second grand jury appearance, Miller produced a notebook from a previously undisclosed meeting with Libby on June 23, 2003. This was several weeks &quot;before&quot; Joseph Wilson&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial was published. This belied the theory that Libby was retaliating against Wilson for his &quot;Times&quot; editorial. According to Miller&#x27;s notes from that earlier meeting, Libby disclosed that Joseph Wilson&#x27;s wife was a CIA employee who was involved in her husband&#x27;s trip to Niger. Miller&#x27;s notebook from her July 8, 2003, meeting with Libby contains the name &quot;Valerie Flame [sic]&quot;. This reference occurred six days before Novak published Plame&#x27;s name and unmasked her as a CIA operative.

Miller&#x27;s grand jury account was the basis for her last article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The newspaper published Miller&#x27;s first-person account, &quot;My Four Hours Testifying in the Federal Grand Jury Room&quot;, on October 16, 2005. Miller said she could not remember who gave her the name &quot;Valerie Plame&quot; but she was sure it didn&#x27;t come from Libby.

Miller testified as a witness on January 30, 2007, at the trial of Scooter Libby, which began in January 2007. The trial ended on March 6, 2007, with Libby&#x27;s conviction on four of five counts, but none of the counts had to do with his actual revealing of Plame&#x27;s name to the media.

=== Independent writing ===
Since leaving &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Miller has continued her work as a writer in Manhattan and has contributed several op-ed pieces to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. On May 16, 2006, she summarized her investigations on U.S. foreign policy regarding Libya&#x27;s dismantling of its weapons programs in an essay published in two parts.

On May 17, 2006, NavySEALs.com and MediaChannel.org published an exclusive interview with Miller in which she detailed how the attack on the USS &quot;Cole&quot; led her to investigate Al-Qaeda and, in July 2001, to her receiving information from a top-level White House source concerning top-secret NSA signals intelligence (SIGINT) about an impending Al-Qaeda attack, possibly against the continental United States. Two months later, on September 11, Miller and her editor at the &quot;Times&quot;, Stephen Engelberg, both regretted not writing that story.

On September 7, 2007, she was hired as an adjunct fellow of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a neo-conservative free-market think tank. Her duties included being a contributing editor for the organization&#x27;s publication, &quot;City Journal&quot;. On October 20, 2008, Fox News announced that it had hired Miller.

As of 2018, she is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She has also been a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, and has served on a prestigious National Academy of Sciences panel examining how best to expand of the work of the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, which since 1991 has sought to stop the spread of WMD material and expertise from the former Soviet Union. She lectures frequently on the Middle East, Islam, terrorism, biological and chemical weapons, as well as other national security topics.

=== The Iraq War revisited ===
On April 3, 2015, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published an op-ed piece by Miller in which she defended her comportment during the lead-up to the war in Iraq, as well as the Bush administration&#x27;s stance and decisions regarding the war. &quot;Officials [of the Bush administration] didn&#x27;t lie, and I wasn&#x27;t fed a line,&quot; she wrote. Miller acknowledged that &quot;there was no shortage of mistakes about Iraq, and I made my share of them. The newsworthy claims of some of my prewar WMD stories were wrong&quot;, but rejected the notion that &quot;I took America to war in Iraq. It was all me&quot;, which according to her &quot;continue[d] to have believers&quot;.

Critics subsequently wrote that &quot;Miller&#x27;s war reporting was disastrously wrong, and now she&#x27;s trying desperately to spin it all away,&quot;. Valerie Plame commented that while &quot;no one is crediting [Miller] with starting the Iraq war,&quot; and she was &quot;not actually on the team that took us into the biggest, most tragic US foreign policy debacle ever..., [Miller&#x27;s] attempt to re-write history is both pathetic and self-serving.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;in arguing that Bush was a victim of faulty intelligence analysis, Miller ignores extensive reporting showing that the Bush administration was making plans for an Iraq invasion &quot;before&quot; the advent of intelligence used to justify it.&quot;

Others focused on what they termed as factual inaccuracies, such as Miller&#x27;s claim that &quot;Hans Blix, the former chief of the international weapons inspectors, bears some responsibility [for the war]&quot; because he &quot;told the U.N. in January 2003 that despite America&#x27;s ultimatum, Saddam was still not complying fully with his U.N. pledges.&quot; Her critics pointed out that, although Blix indeed reported that &quot;Iraq wasn&#x27;t fully compliant,&quot; he also reported that Iraq was &quot;largely cooperative with regard to process,&quot; and, subsequently, &quot;made it abundantly clear, in an interview published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, that nothing he&#x27;d seen at the time justified war,&quot; an interview taken by Miller herself.

=== Memoir ===
In April 2015, Miller published &quot;The Story: A Reporter&#x27;s Journey&quot;, a memoir that focused largely on her reporting during the second Gulf War. Her former colleague Neil Lewis characterized most of the reviews as &quot;unreservedly critical&quot;. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, former &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter Terry McDermott wrote that although &quot;this is not a score-settling book&quot;, he found it &quot;sad and flawed&quot;. Ιn &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Erik Wemple wrote that the book&#x27;s &quot;dynamic&quot; of &quot;Judy Miller against the world&quot; lends her book an aspect that is &quot;both depressing and desperate&quot;. A review in the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; called the book &quot;less a memoir than an apologia and an assault&quot;. In &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, Lloyd Grove characterized Miller&#x27;s work as &quot;self-pitying&quot;. Criticizing Miller&#x27;s failure to fully take responsibility for the flaws in her reporting, Matt Taibbi wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;Most of &quot;The Story&quot; is a tale of dog after scheming dog eating Miller&#x27;s homework. ... Mostly, she just had a lot of rotten luck. Or at least, that&#x27;s how it reads. It&#x27;s a sweeping, epic non-apology. Every bad thing Miller has ever been accused of turns out to be wrong or taken out of context, according to her.&quot;

<doc id="515925" wikidata="Q2335344" url="?curid=515925" title="Christopher Moltisanti">
<text>Christopher Moltisanti, portrayed by Michael Imperioli, is a fictional character of the HBO TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. He is Tony Soprano&#x27;s protégé and a member of the DiMeo crime family, rising from associate to captain over the course of the series.

In the TV series, Tony Soprano has been a father figure to Christopher since the death of his father, Dickie Moltisanti. Tony affectionately refers to Christopher as his &quot;nephew,&quot; but he is actually a first cousin once removed of Tony&#x27;s wife Carmela (Carmela&#x27;s father Hugh and Chris&#x27;s grandmother Lena were brother and sister). Tony and Christopher knew each other before Tony met Carmela because their fathers were both involved in the Mafia and because they are both cousins, through unrelated sides, to Tony Blundetto; Christopher&#x27;s girlfriend Adriana La Cerva also believes that Tony and Christopher are distantly related through Christopher&#x27;s mother.

The character, Christopher, is a volatile, impulsive, and unpredictable young man, frustrated by his perceived lack of progress in the Mafia business. His violent behavior often causes friction between him and the rest of the North Jersey Mafia, which is especially troublesome for Tony Soprano, who attempts to guide Christopher towards becoming a major leader in the business. Throughout the series, Christopher struggles with substance abuse, which further complicates his relationship with the Mafia, especially when other Mafia members ostracize Christopher when he attempts to stay sober.

In Season 1, Christopher oversteps his authority when he hijacks trucks under the protection of captain Junior Soprano. To teach him a lesson, Junior orders his mock execution. In the second season, Chris is shot by his subordinates Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte but survives. Tony trusts Christopher with sensitive tasks, such as disposing of the bodies of murdered captains Richie Aprile and Ralph Cifaretto and arranging the assassination of New York boss Carmine Lupertazzi. In the third season, Chris finally becomes a made man. This leads to friction with Paulie Gualtieri, culminating in the Pine Barrens incident and although they make an uneasy truce, they clash again on several occasions. By the sixth season, Christopher is promoted to the role of captain, and Tony tells him that he will lead the family into the 21st century.

Christopher&#x27;s character has a tumultuous and abusive relationship with Adriana, his long-term girlfriend, who becomes his fiancée. When Chris becomes enraged about rumors that Adriana and Tony are having an affair, he pulls a gun on Tony, who is ready to kill him for doing so. He is spared only after Tony Blundetto intercedes for him. In the fifth season, Chris learns that Adriana has been working as an informant for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and that she wants him to go into the Witness Protection Program with her. Valuing loyalty over love, Christopher reports Adriana&#x27;s actions to Tony, who has Silvio Dante kill her. Christopher then marries his new girlfriend, Kelli Lombardo, and they have a daughter, Caitlyn. But his interest in his new wife soon wanes. He grows disillusioned with Tony and frustrated with his progress in the Soprano family, and distances himself from the business by making a film and trying to become a Hollywood screenwriter. While the movie is a modest success, Chris grows irritated with his business partner J.T. Dolan and eventually ends up murdering him when Dolan refuses to listen to details of the murders he had witnessed previously.

Because of his substance abuse, Christopher spends significant amounts of time at AA meetings and rehabilitation centers. Despite wanting Christopher to succeed, Tony doubts his &quot;nephew&#x27;s” loyalty and suitability to be his successor, and he fears that Christopher&#x27;s immaturity and frequent drug problems make him a ripe target to turn state&#x27;s evidence. Christopher&#x27;s efforts to stay clean of drugs and alcohol cause him to spend less time at their regular haunts, further arousing Tony&#x27;s suspicions. Christopher causes a car crash as he is driving Tony home while high. After seeing that Caitlyn&#x27;s baby seat has been completely destroyed in the accident and knowing she would have been killed if she were in the car, Tony has finally had enough and suffocates the badly injured Chris, finally ridding himself of his troublesome &quot;nephew&quot;.

==Biography==
Christopher Moltisanti was born in 1969 to Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; Moltisanti, a soldier in the DiMeo crime family, and Joanne Blundetto. In the episode &quot;Cold Cuts&quot; it is revealed that Chris grew up in the Rochelle Park section of Paramus, New Jersey next to the Westfield Garden State Plaza. When talking about his childhood with his cousin Tony Blundetto he describes himself as an urban youth, something Blundetto disagrees with.

When discussing making a biographical movie of Joe Gallo with Jon Favreau, Moltisanti mentions that he vaguely remembered Gallo being murdered in 1972, as he was only a kid (3 years old). Dickie is killed by a hitman sent by Junior Soprano when Chris is very young (although Junior kept his involvement hidden and the murder is blamed on another mobster named Jilly Ruffalo). Tony Soprano affectionately considers Christopher a &quot;nephew,&quot; and looks out for him over the years. He is a fan of the television show &quot;Cops&quot;. Moltisanti is a roommate of Brendan Filone before his murder and engaged to Adriana La Cerva before her murder. Chris is a cousin once removed of Tony&#x27;s wife Carmela, making him a second cousin to her children.

===Season one===
Christopher begins the series as Tony&#x27;s driver and enforcer and is eager to rise through the ranks in the Mafia. He &quot;makes his bones&quot; by killing Emil Kolar in order to settle a dispute with the DiMeo crime family over the Triborough Towers garbage routes. He initially plans to place the body in a Kolar Bros. dumpster to send a warning, but Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero convinces him to put it elsewhere as it would bring less heat to the crew. The murder haunts Chris&#x27; dreams, and he twice has to dig up and move Kolar&#x27;s corpse.

Chris aids Brendan in hijacking Comley trucks, which are under Junior Soprano&#x27;s protection. The two are ordered to pay $15,000 in restitution to Junior and leave the trucks alone. Chris and Brendan plan another heist while high on methamphetamine, but Chris backs down at the last minute out of loyalty to Tony. Brendan and two others go through with the heist, which ends in the accidental death of the driver.

Chris is reprimanded by Tony for not using his leadership to stop Brendan. Junior, angered that his authority was flouted, stages a mock execution for Chris in the New Jersey Meadowlands. Brendan is shot in the eye by Mikey Palmice. Christopher later avenges Brendan&#x27;s death as part of Tony&#x27;s revenge against Junior, when he and Paulie ambush and murder Mikey out in the woods.

===Season two===
Chris is put in charge of the family&#x27;s pump and dump scam, with Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte serving as his subordinates. Eventually, Bevilaqua and Gismonte decide to murder him to gain favor with Richie Aprile. The pair ambush Chris outside a diner and badly wound him, but he manages to kill Gismonte as Bevilaqua flees the scene. When Chris recovers from a coma, his spleen is removed and goes through a traumatic recovery process, having been clinically dead for about a minute.

Bevilaqua is eventually tracked down and executed by Tony and Big Pussy. Chris tells the crew that during his coma, he had seen himself in either hell or purgatory and warned them that Brendan and Mikey told him that three o&#x27;clock would be a significant time in their future.

Shortly before the shooting, Chris and Adriana had gotten into a fight causing Adriana to move in with her mother. Chris gets her back by proposing to her, against her mother&#x27;s advice. Despite this, the two don&#x27;t get married.

Following Richie&#x27;s death at the hands of Janice, Tony calls Chris and Furio Giunta to dispose of his body. They use Satriale&#x27;s bandsaw and processing room to dismember the corpse. At Meadow Soprano&#x27;s graduation, Tony proposes to let Chris be made.

===Season three===
During Chris&#x27; initiation ceremony, in &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;, he notices a raven on the windowsill and takes this as a bad omen. As the family&#x27;s newest member, he inherits a betting shop from his &quot;capo&quot;, Paulie Gualtieri and is charged with paying minimum weekly dues to him. There is friction when Chris has difficulty making payments to Paulie, who subsequently humiliates him. After the Pine Barrens incident, they agreed to bury the hatchet. Elsewhere, Chris opens the Crazy Horse Nightclub in Long Branch with Furio as a partner and Adriana as the front operator.

Chris is present when Jackie Aprile Jr. and his friends try to rob a card game run by Eugene Pontecorvo. Chris and acting &quot;capo&quot; Albert Barese fire back, killing Jackie Jr.&#x27;s friend Dino Zerilli as he tries to escape. Chris, jealous and resentful of Jackie Jr. as a rival for Tony&#x27;s favor, expresses his intent to kill Jackie Jr. as retaliation for the heist, which Tony denies. This causes Chris to question Tony&#x27;s leadership, calling him a hypocrite for not enforcing established rules of the mob protecting made men, which enrages Tony.

Eventually, Vito Spatafore carries out a contract killing on Jackie Jr. in the Boonton Projects, shooting him in the back of the head, on the orders of Ralph Cifaretto and Tony. At Jackie Jr.&#x27;s funeral, Chris is arrested on a gambling charge along with Patsy Parisi and Silvio Dante.

===Season four===
To protect himself from prosecution, Tony makes Chris the main contact in criminal dealings. He then bonds his nephew to him by having him murder the recently retired Lieutenant Detective Barry Haydu, after telling Chris that Haydu had murdered his father. Christopher confronts Haydu at his home and Haydu denies having heard of Dickie Moltisanti and claimed that someone was &quot;obviously&quot; setting him up. However, he inadvertently admitted knowing Dickie Moltisanti by stating &quot;Look, whoever told you I had anything to do with his death is lying!&quot;, before Christopher ever mentioned Dickie&#x27;s death, whom Haydu supposedly did not even know.

Haydu&#x27;s last words before he is killed by Christopher are &quot;I&#x27;m sorry!&quot; indicating that he was likely responsible. In &quot;No Show&quot;, Chris is made acting &quot;capo&quot; of Paulie&#x27;s crew while Paulie is imprisoned on a gun charge, being awarded a no-show job at the Esplanade construction site. His promotion irks Patsy, who has seniority. The two come to blows over Patsy&#x27;s continued theft from the construction site, despite orders from Tony. Silvio was actually the guiding force behind Patsy&#x27;s actions, as he was also jealous of Chris&#x27; promotion.

Chris&#x27; drug use spirals out of control following his temporary promotion. When Tony calls upon him to dispose of Ralph Cifaretto&#x27;s body, he realizes that Chris is high on heroin. Although they successfully hide the body, Tony decides his nephew needs help. Later, Chris is carjacked by a Puerto Rican gang while trying to buy heroin. When Chris physically abuses Adriana, Tony organizes an intervention. However, the meeting ends badly when it is revealed that Chris had accidentally killed Adriana&#x27;s dog by sitting on it when high. Tony, whose beloved racehorse was killed in a fire set by Ralph, becomes very angry. He insists Chris go into rehab and assigns Patsy to guard him.

Following Chris&#x27; successful rehabilitation, Tony entrusts him with the planned hit on Carmine Lupertazzi; Chris contracts the job out to Credenzo Curtis and Stanley Johnson, Black gang members and drug dealers who he had known from his period of heroin abuse. When the job is called off and Tony urges him to make sure it can&#x27;t be traced to them, Chris has Benny Fazio and Peter &quot;Bissell&quot; LaRosa shoot Curtis and Johnson to death while he waits in his car watching over the hit. Fazio and La Rosa steal back the money Chris had given Curtis and Johnson, which they believed was payment for the hit they were tasked with.

===Season five===
Chris and Paulie are put in charge of a cigarette smuggling operation. While Chris is traveling to North Carolina to pick up cigarettes, Tony and Adriana are involved in a car accident. Rumors begin to spread that the crash was caused by Adriana performing oral sex on Tony. Chris finds out, gets drunk, starts a fight with Vito, and pulls a gun on Tony in the Bada Bing. Tony is prepared to kill Chris, but their cousin Tony Blundetto steps in and saves his life. Tony B. arranges a meeting with the doctor who treated Tony and Adriana, who explains that both passengers were upright and had their seat belts fastened when it occurred. Chris reconciles with Vito and Tony.

Chris later travels to his uncle Pat Blundetto&#x27;s farm alongside Tony and Tony B. They help Pat move bodies hidden on the farm as Pat is planning to move away. While there, Chris recalls being bullied by the two Tonys, and they exhibit such behavior by ribbing him over his addiction problems.

Throughout this time, Chris maintains a turbulent and sometimes violent relationship with Adriana. He indulged her aspirations for a career in music by allowing her to produce a demo and later giving her a club to run. They became engaged before he is sent to rehab. However, after he learns that Adriana has reluctantly provided information to the FBI, he turns to Tony rather than accept her plea to join her in witness protection. Tony sends Silvio Dante to meet with Adriana, purportedly to drive to the hospital to visit Chris, but in reality, he executes her in the woods. Chris relapses into heroin use and weeps to Tony out of grief for Adriana.

===Season six===
====Part one====
Chris is promoted to &quot;capo&quot;, in keeping with Tony&#x27;s long-term plan to raise his nephew through the ranks until he eventually is appointed boss. He uses Chris to organize a sensitive hit on Rusty Millio. Chris initially questions Tony&#x27;s decision to contract the job out to their friends in Naples, but later decides it was a smart move. He uses his Italian-speaking associate Corky Caporale to communicate with hitmen and provide them with weapons and instructions while paying him off with heroin. Chris&#x27; readiness for the responsibility of leading his own crew is unclear as he is distracted by a potential career in Hollywood, relapses into drug use, and displays unresolved feelings over his murdered fiancée.

Chris&#x27; crew get involved in a credit card fraud scam; his AA sponsor James &quot;Murmur&quot; Zancone and Benny Fazio take numbers from local businesses and sell them on to associates Ahmed and Muhammad. He wonders about whether these men have links to terrorism. The use of numbers from Nuovo Vesuvio leads to a violent dispute between Benny and Tony&#x27;s friend Artie Bucco. Tony blames Chris&#x27; trip to Los Angeles for the dispute not being settled quickly.

Chris marries Kelli Lombardo after learning that she is pregnant with his child. He has a belated bachelor party with the Soprano crime family at Nuovo Vesuvio, where &quot;Larry Boy&quot; Barese makes a toast to his future. However, when he later delivers Corky&#x27;s final payment, including more heroin, he cannot resist when he watches his friend inject the drug. He spends the night at the Feast of St. Elzear festival with a stray dog.

Chris takes a road trip to Pennsylvania with Tony just before the feast. On their way home, they spot some bikers robbing a strip mall and take part of the haul for themselves. This leads to a firefight in which Chris shoots one of the bikers as Tony drives away. Later, the two get drunk on the wine they had stolen, and Chris recalls telling Tony of Adriana&#x27;s treachery. The two express their love for and loyalty to each other, though when the two later try to recreate their camaraderie sober, it falls flat and ends in awkward silence. Months later, Chris is back in AA meetings.

====Part two====
Chris premieres his film &quot;Cleaver&quot; at a private screening with other Soprano associates, looking to have it distributed nationwide. He also tries to distance himself from alcohol and stays away from the Bada Bing. When Tony begins grooming Bobby Bacala for the position Chris once held, it is clear that their relationship has cooled. Given Chris&#x27; resentment towards Tony about Adriana&#x27;s death, and his continued desire to enter the film business, the two continue to drift apart.

When he relapses to drinking after yet another confrontation with Paulie, he becomes very angry with the crew and leaves. He later ends up at his &quot;friend&quot; J.T. Dolan&#x27;s home, looking for someone to talk to. When J.T. makes explicit mention of Chris&#x27; membership in the Mafia and refuses to let Chris talk out his problems that night, Chris shoots him in the head and leaves.

As Tony and Chris drive back from a meeting with Phil Leotardo and the New York crew, Chris clearly impaired by drugs and alcohol crashes his Cadillac Escalade. Tony is able to climb out of the SUV, but Chris is badly injured and coughing up blood. He pleads for Tony&#x27;s help, mumbling that he wouldn&#x27;t pass a drug test and could lose his license. Tony sees a tree branch impaling a car seat where Christopher&#x27;s daughter could have been sitting. He pinches Chris&#x27; nostrils shut, causing him to choke to death on his own blood.

Throughout the episode&#x27;s remainder, Tony displays the proper decorum for the family in mourning yet can barely restrain his relief that he is finally free of the burden Chris has placed upon him for so long his insubordination, his substance abuse, his reckless behavior, and his complaints. He describes Chris as a &quot;drag&quot; on his emotions, and &quot;a weak, lying drug addict&quot;. In a dream, Tony admits to Dr. Melfi that he murdered Chris, as well as other friends and associates, naming specifically his cousin Tony Blundetto and best friend Big Pussy. In the series&#x27; final episodes, Chris&#x27; picture is hung in the pork store in his honor; Paulie is disturbed that the resident cat spends its days staring at the picture.

=== Clandestine knowledge ===
Because of his close relationship with Tony Soprano, Christopher is the only one (besides Tony) who knows which bodies were buried at &quot;Uncle Pat&quot; Blundetto&#x27;s farm and what really happened to Ralph Cifaretto. Chris is also one of the few (along with Furio Giunta) to know Richie Aprile was murdered by Janice Soprano, Tony Soprano&#x27;s murder of Fabian Petrulio, the aborted plan to hit New York boss Carmine Lupertazzi Sr. and about Silvio&#x27;s murder of Christopher&#x27;s fiancée, Adriana La Cerva.

=== &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot; ===
Imperioli returns in the prequel film &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;. Though never seen on screen, he acts as the narrator of the film. Christopher is seemingly narrating from the afterlife, bitterly referencing his death at the hands of Tony as well as Tony&#x27;s lack of financial support to his family after his death. During the film, an infant Christopher cries when he sees Tony at a welcoming back party for Tony&#x27;s father, &quot;Johnny Boy&quot; Soprano. When Tony expresses confusion at the infant Chris&#x27; behavior around him, a woman at the table tells him that &quot;some babies, when they come into the world, know all kinds of things from the other side.&quot; The final scene of the film ends with Christopher narrating that Tony is &quot;the guy [he] went to hell for.&quot;

Christopher has helped dispose of several people murdered by other people throughout the series, mainly Tony.
* James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Altieri: Lured by Christopher to his death, a bullet to the back of the head courtesy of Silvio Dante.

When Tony comes to an agreement with Carmine and calls off the hit, Christopher is given the new task of eliminating the two hired hands.

== References to Imperioli&#x27;s career ==
* In the episode &quot;46 Long&quot;, Christopher and Brendan Filone encounter Martin Scorsese (portrayed by a lookalike) outside of a club. Christopher yells &quot;Marty! &quot;Kundun&quot;! I liked it!&quot;. Imperioli acted in Scorsese&#x27;s gangster film &quot;Goodfellas&quot; in a minor role, &quot;Spider&quot;.
* In Season 1 Moltisanti shoots a bakery clerk in the foot in retaliation for a perceived lack of respect and service — a nod to Imperioli&#x27;s &quot;Goodfellas&quot; character Spider, shot in the foot for the same reason. When the bakery clerk was yelling in pain about his foot being shot, Christopher replies &quot;It happens!&quot;
* In reference to his &quot;Goodfellas&quot; character, Spider, being shot and killed by Joe Pesci&#x27;s character, Tommy DeVito. In the season 2 episode, &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, when Christopher gets his confidence up as a student actor, Adriana tells him &quot;I like you as an actor.&quot; and Christopher replies &quot;Joe Pesci or so.&quot;, he then does a Joe Pesci impression of him saying a line in &quot;Jimmy Hollywood&quot;.
* In the episode &quot;Live Free or Die&quot;, after it is confirmed that Vito Spatafore is gay, Christopher states &quot;I wanna kill the fat faggot myself, it&#x27;d be a fucking honor. Cut off his pisciatil&#x27; and feed it to him.&quot; This is a reference to Imperioli&#x27;s character D&#x27;Ambrosio in the film &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; having exactly the same thing done to him by the North Vietnamese. Pisciatil&#x27; is slang connotation for penis.
* When Imperioli auditioned for the role of Christopher, he thought that series creator David Chase was unimpressed with his audition and was surprised when he was offered the part.

== Reception ==
Both Christopher&#x27;s character development and Michael Imperioli&#x27;s performance have received universal acclaim. He received several accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2004. He was nominated four other times for the award and he also received two Golden Globe nominations in 2002 and 2004. &quot;TV Guide&quot; rated him #13 on their list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Top 100 Characters&quot;.

<text>Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering. They typically use bag-of-words features to identify email spam, an approach commonly used in text classification.

Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes&#x27; theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam.

Naive Bayes spam filtering is a baseline technique for dealing with spam that can tailor itself to the email needs of individual users and give low false positive spam detection rates that are generally acceptable to users. It is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s.

==History==
Bayesian algorithms were used for email filtering as early as 1996. Although naive Bayesian filters did not become popular until later, multiple programs were released in 1998 to address the growing problem of unwanted email. The first scholarly publication on Bayesian spam filtering was by Sahami et al. in 1998.

Variants of the basic technique have been implemented in a number of research works and commercial software products. Many modern mail clients implement Bayesian spam filtering. Users can also install separate email filtering programs. Server-side email filters, such as DSPAM, SpamAssassin, SpamBayes, Bogofilter, and ASSP, make use of Bayesian spam filtering techniques, and the functionality is sometimes embedded within mail server software itself. CRM114, oft cited as a Bayesian filter, is not intended to use a Bayes filter in production, but includes the ″unigram″ feature for reference.

==Process==
Particular words have particular probabilities of occurring in spam email and in legitimate email. For instance, most email users will frequently encounter the word &quot;Viagra&quot; in spam email, but will seldom see it in other email. The filter doesn&#x27;t know these probabilities in advance, and must first be trained so it can build them up. To train the filter, the user must manually indicate whether a new email is spam or not. For all words in each training email, the filter will adjust the probabilities that each word will appear in spam or legitimate email in its database. For instance, Bayesian spam filters will typically have learned a very high spam probability for the words &quot;Viagra&quot; and &quot;refinance&quot;, but a very low spam probability for words seen only in legitimate email, such as the names of friends and family members.

After training, the word probabilities (also known as likelihood functions) are used to compute the probability that an email with a particular set of words in it belongs to either category. Each word in the email contributes to the email&#x27;s spam probability, or only the most interesting words. This contribution is called the posterior probability and is computed using Bayes&#x27; theorem. Then, the email&#x27;s spam probability is computed over all words in the email, and if the total exceeds a certain threshold (say 95%), the filter will mark the email as a spam.

As in any other spam filtering technique, email marked as spam can then be automatically moved to a &quot;Junk&quot; email folder, or even deleted outright. Some software implement quarantine mechanisms that define a time frame during which the user is allowed to review the software&#x27;s decision.

The initial training can usually be refined when wrong judgements from the software are identified (false positives or false negatives). That allows the software to dynamically adapt to the ever-evolving nature of spam.

Some spam filters combine the results of both Bayesian spam filtering and other heuristics (pre-defined rules about the contents, looking at the message&#x27;s envelope, etc.), resulting in even higher filtering accuracy, sometimes at the cost of adaptiveness.

==Mathematical foundation==
Bayesian email filters utilize Bayes&#x27; theorem. Bayes&#x27; theorem is used several times in the context of spam:
* a first time, to compute the probability that the message is spam, knowing that a given word appears in this message;
* a second time, to compute the probability that the message is spam, taking into consideration all of its words (or a relevant subset of them);
* sometimes a third time, to deal with rare words.

===Computing the probability that a message containing a given word is spam===
Let&#x27;s suppose the suspected message contains the word &quot;replica&quot;. Most people who are used to receiving e-mail know that this message is likely to be spam, more precisely a proposal to sell counterfeit copies of well-known brands of watches. The spam detection software, however, does not &quot;know&quot; such facts; all it can do is compute probabilities.

The formula used by the software to determine that, is derived from Bayes&#x27; theorem

:formula_1

where:

* formula_2 is the probability that a message is a spam, knowing that the word &quot;replica&quot; is in it;
* formula_3 is the overall probability that any given message is spam;
* formula_4 is the probability that the word &quot;replica&quot; appears in spam messages;
* formula_5 is the overall probability that any given message is not spam (is &quot;ham&quot;);
* formula_6 is the probability that the word &quot;replica&quot; appears in ham messages.

(For a full demonstration, see Bayes&#x27; theorem#Extended form.)

===The spamliness of a word===

Statistics show that the current probability of any message being spam is 80%, at the very least:
:formula_7

The filters that use this hypothesis are said to be &quot;not biased&quot;, meaning that they have no prejudice regarding the incoming email. This assumption permits simplifying the general formula to:

:formula_8

This is functionally equivalent to asking, &quot;what percentage of occurrences of the word &#x27;replica&#x27; appear in spam messages?&quot;

This quantity is called &quot;spamicity&quot; (or &quot;spaminess&quot;) of the word &quot;replica&quot;, and can be computed. The number formula_4 used in this formula is approximated to the frequency of messages containing &quot;replica&quot; in the messages identified as spam during the learning phase. Similarly, formula_6 is approximated to the frequency of messages containing &quot;replica&quot; in the messages identified as ham during the learning phase. For these approximations to make sense, the set of learned messages needs to be big and representative enough. It is also advisable that the learned set of messages conforms to the 50% hypothesis about repartition between spam and ham, i.e. that the datasets of spam and ham are of same size.

Of course, determining whether a message is spam or ham based only on the presence of the word &quot;replica&quot; is error-prone, which is why bayesian spam software tries to consider several words and combine their spamicities to determine a message&#x27;s overall probability of being spam.

===Combining individual probabilities===
Most bayesian spam filtering algorithms are based on formulas that are strictly valid (from a probabilistic standpoint) only if the words present in the message are independent events. This condition is not generally satisfied (for example, in natural languages like English the probability of finding an adjective is affected by the probability of having a noun), but it is a useful idealization, especially since the statistical correlations between individual words are usually not known. On this basis, one can derive the following formula from Bayes&#x27; theorem:

:formula_11

where:
* formula_12 is the probability that the suspect message is spam;
* formula_13 is the probability formula_14 that the first word (for example &quot;replica&quot;) appears, given that the message is spam;
* formula_15 is the probability formula_16 that the second word (for example &quot;watches&quot;) appears, given that the message is spam;
* etc...

Spam filtering software based on this formula is sometimes referred to as a naive Bayes classifier, as &quot;naive&quot; refers to the strong independence assumptions between the features. The result &quot;p&quot; is typically compared to a given threshold to decide whether the message is spam or not. If &quot;p&quot; is lower than the threshold, the message is considered as likely ham, otherwise it is considered as likely spam.

===Other expression of the formula for combining individual probabilities===
Usually &quot;p&quot; is not directly computed using the above formula due to floating-point underflow. Instead, &quot;p&quot; can be computed in the log domain by rewriting the original equation as follows:

:formula_17

Taking logs on both sides:

:formula_18

Let formula_19. Therefore,

:formula_20

Hence the alternate formula for computing the combined probability:

:formula_21

===Dealing with rare words===
In the case a word has never been met during the learning phase, both the numerator and the denominator are equal to zero, both in the general formula and in the spamicity formula. The software can decide to discard such words for which there is no information available.

More generally, the words that were encountered only a few times during the learning phase cause a problem, because it would be an error to trust blindly the information they provide. A simple solution is to simply avoid taking such unreliable words into account as well.

Applying again Bayes&#x27; theorem, and assuming the classification between spam and ham of the emails containing a given word (&quot;replica&quot;) is a random variable with beta distribution, some programs decide to use a corrected probability:

:formula_22

where:
*formula_23 is the corrected probability for the message to be spam, knowing that it contains a given word ;
* formula_24 is the &quot;strength&quot; we give to background information about incoming spam ;
* formula_3 is the probability of any incoming message to be spam ;
* formula_26 is the number of occurrences of this word during the learning phase ;
* formula_2 is the spamicity of this word.

(Demonstration:)

This corrected probability is used instead of the spamicity in the combining formula.

This formula can be extended to the case where &quot;n&quot; is equal to zero (and where the spamicity is not defined), and evaluates in this case to formula_28.

===Other heuristics===
&quot;Neutral&quot; words like &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, or &quot;is&quot; (in English), or their equivalents in other languages, can be ignored. These are also known as Stop words. More generally, some bayesian filtering filters simply ignore all the words which have a spamicity next to 0.5, as they contribute little to a good decision. The words taken into consideration are those whose spamicity is next to 0.0 (distinctive signs of legitimate messages), or next to 1.0 (distinctive signs of spam). A method can be for example to keep only those ten words, in the examined message, which have the greatest absolute value |0.5 − &quot;pI&quot;|.

Some software products take into account the fact that a given word appears several times in the examined message, others don&#x27;t.

Some software products use &quot;patterns&quot; (sequences of words) instead of isolated natural languages words. For example, with a &quot;context window&quot; of four words, they compute the spamicity of &quot;Viagra is good for&quot;, instead of computing the spamicities of &quot;Viagra&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, and &quot;for&quot;. This method gives more sensitivity to context and eliminates the Bayesian noise better, at the expense of a bigger database.

===Mixed methods===
There are other ways of combining individual probabilities for different words than using the &quot;naive&quot; approach. These methods differ from it on the assumptions they make on the statistical properties of the input data. These different hypotheses result in radically different formulas for combining the individual probabilities.

For example, assuming the individual probabilities follow a chi-squared distribution with 2&quot;N&quot; degrees of freedom, one could use the formula:

:formula_29

where &quot;C&quot;−1 is the inverse of the chi-squared function.

Individual probabilities can be combined with the techniques of the Markovian discrimination too.

==Discussion==
===Advantages===

The spam that a user receives is often related to the online user&#x27;s activities. For example, a user may have been subscribed to an online newsletter that the user considers to be spam. This online newsletter is likely to contain words that are common to all newsletters, such as the name of the newsletter and its originating email address. A Bayesian spam filter will eventually assign a higher probability based on the user&#x27;s specific patterns.

The legitimate e-mails a user receives will tend to be different. For example, in a corporate environment, the company name and the names of clients or customers will be mentioned often. The filter will assign a lower spam probability to emails containing those names.

The word probabilities are unique to each user and can evolve over time with corrective training whenever the filter incorrectly classifies an email. As a result, Bayesian spam filtering accuracy after training is often superior to pre-defined rules.

===Disadvantages===
Depending on the implementation, Bayesian spam filtering may be susceptible to Bayesian poisoning, a technique used by spammers in an attempt to degrade the effectiveness of spam filters that rely on Bayesian filtering. A spammer practicing Bayesian poisoning will send out emails with large amounts of legitimate text (gathered from legitimate news or literary sources). Spammer tactics include insertion of random innocuous words that are not normally associated with spam, thereby decreasing the email&#x27;s spam score, making it more likely to slip past a Bayesian spam filter. However, with (for example) Paul Graham&#x27;s scheme only the most significant probabilities are used, so that padding the text out with non-spam-related words does not affect the detection probability significantly.

Words that normally appear in large quantities in spam may also be transformed by spammers. For example, «Viagra» would be replaced with «Viaagra» or «V!agra» in the spam message. The recipient of the message can still read the changed words, but each of these words is met more rarely by the Bayesian filter, which hinders its learning process. As a general rule, this spamming technique does not work very well, because the derived words end up recognized by the filter just like the normal ones.

Another technique used to try to defeat Bayesian spam filters is to replace text with pictures, either directly included or linked. The whole text of the message, or some part of it, is replaced with a picture where the same text is &quot;drawn&quot;. The spam filter is usually unable to analyze this picture, which would contain the sensitive words like «Viagra». However, since many mail clients disable the display of linked pictures for security reasons, the spammer sending links to distant pictures might reach fewer targets. Also, a picture&#x27;s size in bytes is bigger than the equivalent text&#x27;s size, so the spammer needs more bandwidth to send messages directly including pictures. Some filters are more inclined to decide that a message is spam if it has mostly graphical contents. A solution used by Google in its Gmail email system is to perform an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on every mid to large size image, analyzing the text inside.

==General applications of Bayesian filtering==
While Bayesian filtering is used widely to identify spam email, the technique can classify (or &quot;cluster&quot;) almost any sort of data. It has uses in science, medicine, and engineering. One example is a general purpose classification program called AutoClass which was originally used to classify stars according to spectral characteristics that were otherwise too subtle to notice.

<text>Peter Bichsel (born March 24 1935) is a popular Swiss writer and journalist representing modern German literature. He was a member of the Gruppe Olten.

Bichsel was born in 1935 in Lucerne, Switzerland, the son of manual labourers. Shortly after he was born, the Bichsels moved to Olten, also in Switzerland. After finishing school, he became an elementary school teacher, a job he held until 1968. From 1974 to 1981 he was the personal advisor and speech writer of Willy Ritschard, a member of the Swiss Federal Council. Between 1972 and 1989 he made his mark as a &quot;writer in residence&quot; and a guest lecturer at American universities. Bichsel has lived on the outskirts of Solothurn for several decades.

He started publishing short lyric works in newspapers. In 1960, he got his first success in prose as a private printer. In the winter of 1963–1964, he took part in a writing course in prose taught by Walter Höllerer.

One of his first and best-known works is &quot;And Really Frau Blum Would Very Much Like to Meet the Milkman&quot;. Just as successful, &quot;Children&#x27;s Stories&quot;, intended for adults, is written in the form of droll tales for children. Both books were translated from German by the English poet Michael Hamburger. A theme of Bichsel&#x27;s works for younger readers is the stubborn desire of children to take words literally and wreak havoc on the world of communicated ideas. In the early 1970s and 1980s, Bichsel&#x27;s journalistic work pushed his literary work mainly into the background. Only &quot;Der Busant&quot; (1985) and &quot;Warten in Baden-Baden&quot; appeared again with the Bichsel style that was so familiar to German readers. Peter Bichsel gave up being a professional teacher early in his lifetime, yet he has continued to teach his readers that the drudgery and banality of life are of our own making. Conversely, we have every opportunity to prevent our lives from being boring. This theme has helped make Peter Bichsel a symbol of German literary work today.

In 1981, he was a member of the jury at the 31st Berlin International Film Festival.

Peter Bichsel&#x27;s estate is archived in the Swiss Literary Archives in Bern.

<doc id="515933" wikidata="Q204871" url="?curid=515933" title="Charles Bridge">
<text>Charles Bridge ( ) is a medieval stone arch bridge that crosses the Vltava river in Prague, Czech Republic. Its construction started in 1357 under the auspices of King Charles IV, and finished in the early 15th century. The bridge replaced the old Judith Bridge built 1158–1172 that had been severely damaged by a flood in 1342. This new bridge was originally called Stone Bridge (&quot;Kamenný most&quot;) or Prague Bridge (&quot;Pražský most&quot;), but has been referred to as &quot;Charles Bridge&quot; since 1870.

As the only means of crossing the river Vltava until 1841, Charles Bridge was the most important connection between Prague Castle and the city&#x27;s Old Town and adjacent areas. This land connection made Prague important as a trade route between Eastern and Western Europe.

The bridge is long and nearly wide. Following the example of the Stone Bridge in Regensburg, it was built as a bow bridge with 16 arches shielded by ice guards. It is protected by three bridge towers, two on the Lesser Quarter side (including the Malá Strana Bridge Tower) and one on the Old Town side, the Old Town Bridge Tower. The bridge is decorated by a continuous alley of 30 statues and statuaries, most of them baroque-style, originally erected around 1700, but now all have been replaced by replicas.

The bridge is currently undergoing a twenty-year process of structural inspections, restoration, and repairs. The process started in late 2019, and is expected to cost 45–60 million CZK (US$1.9–2.6 million).

==History==
===14th to 19th centuries===

Throughout its history, Charles Bridge has suffered several disasters and witnessed many historic events. Czech legend has it that construction began on Charles Bridge at 5:31am on 9 July 1357 with the first stone being laid by Charles IV himself. This exact time was very important to the Holy Roman Emperor because he was a strong believer in numerology and felt that this specific time, which formed a palindrome (1357 9/7 5:31), was a numerical bridge, and would imbue Charles Bridge with additional strength. The bridge was completed 45 years later in 1402. A flood in 1432 damaged three pillars. In 1496 the third arch (counting from the Old Town side) broke down after one of the pillars lowered, being undermined by the water (repairs were finished in 1503). A year after the Battle of White Mountain, when the 27 leaders of the anti-Habsburg revolt were executed on 21 June 1621, the Old Town Bridge Tower served as a deterrent display of the severed heads of the victims to stop Czechs from further resistance. During the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1648, the Swedes occupied the west bank of the Vltava, and as they tried to advance into the Old Town the heaviest fighting took place right on the bridge. During the fighting, they severely damaged one side of the Old Town bridge tower (the side facing the river) and the remnants of almost all gothic decorations had to be removed from it afterward. During the late 17th century and early 18th century the bridge gained its typical appearance when an alley of baroque statues was installed on the pillars. During a great flood in 1784, five pillars were severely damaged and, although the arches did not break down, the traffic on the bridge had to be greatly restricted for some time.

The original stairway to Kampa Island was replaced by a new one in 1844. The next year, another great flood threatened the bridge, but the bridge escaped major damage. In 1848, during the revolutionary days, the bridge escaped unharmed from the cannonade, but some of the statues were damaged. In 1866, pseudo-gothic gas lights were erected on the balustrade; they were later replaced with electric lighting. In the 1870s, the first regular public-transport (omnibus) line went over the bridge (officially called &quot;Charles Bridge&quot; after 1870) later replaced by a horse tram. The bridge towers underwent a thorough reconstruction between 1874 and 1883.

On 2–5 September 1890, another disastrous flood struck Prague and severely damaged Charles Bridge. Thousands of rafts, logs and other floating materials that escaped from places upstream gradually formed a huge barrier leaning against the bridge. Three arches were torn down by the great pressure and two pillars collapsed from being undermined by the water, while others were partly damaged. With the fifth pillar, two statues – St. Ignatius of Loyola and St. Xavier, both by Ferdinand Brokoff – also fell into the river. The former statue was replaced by a statuary of Saints Cyril and Methodius by Karel Dvořák; the latter was replaced by a replica of the original. Repair works lasted for two years (the bridge was reopened on 19 November 1892) and cost 665,000 crowns.

===20th century to present===
In the beginning of the 20th century, Charles Bridge saw a steep rise of heavy traffic. The last day of the horse line on the bridge was 15 May 1905, when it was replaced with an electric tram and later, in 1908, with buses. At the end of World War II, a barricade was built in the Old Town bridge tower gateway. A capital repair of the bridge took place between 1965 and 1978, based on a collaboration among various scientific and cultural institutes. The stability of the pillars was reassured, all broken stone blocks were replaced, and the asphalt top was removed. All vehicular traffic has been excluded from Charles Bridge since then, making it accessible by pedestrians only. The repair cost 50 million crowns.

During the 1990s, some people started criticizing the previous reconstruction of the bridge and proposing further work. As of the beginning of the new millennium, most of the experts appeared to agree that the previous reconstruction had not been flawless but disputed the need for further interference with the bridge. However, after the disastrous floods of 2002 (which themselves caused only minor harm to the bridge), support for an overall bridge reconstruction grew. It was decided that repair and stabilization of the two pillars (numbers 8 and 9) on the Malá Strana side of the bridge would be done. These are the only river pillars that were not repaired after the 1890 floods. The reconstruction was a gradual process that closed off parts of the bridge without closing the span entirely.

Performed from 2008 to 2010, the work included bolstering the pillars and building a new hydroisolation system protecting the bridge. It also encompassed a re-pavimentation of the bridge&#x27;s pavement and the replacement of many of the stones in the bridge walls, a matter which was controversial due to a heavy-handed approach adopted by the restoration team, which had no previous experience in restoration of cultural heritage monuments. The result has been criticised by conservation professionals all over Europe (see photos on external links), as dozens of new replacement stones do not match the historical ones they are next to, the amount of replaced stones is considered excessive, some stones have been inappropriately positioned, original stones have been chipped and joining materials employed are considered not appropriate for the structure. In 2010 UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Committee adopted a decision stating that &quot;the restoration of Charles Bridge was carried out without adequate conservation advice on materials and techniques&quot;.

==Statues on the bridge==

The avenue of 30 mostly Baroque statues and statuaries situated on the balustrade forms a unique connection of artistic styles with the underlying Gothic bridge. Most sculptures were erected between 1683 and 1714. They depict various saints and patron saints venerated at that time. The most prominent Bohemian sculptors of the time took part in decorating the bridge, such as Matthias Braun, Jan Brokoff, and his sons Michael Joseph and Ferdinand Maxmilian.

Among the most notable sculptures, one can find the statuaries of St. Luthgard, the Holy Crucifix and Calvary, and John of Nepomuk. Well known also is the statue of the knight Bruncvík, although it was erected some 200 years later and does not belong to the main avenue.

Beginning in 1965, all of the statues have been systematically replaced by replicas, and the originals have been exhibited in the Lapidarium of the National Museum.

==Tribute==
On 9 July 2017, Google celebrated the 660th anniversary of Charles Bridge with a Google Doodle.

<doc id="515939" wikidata="Q384177" url="?curid=515939" title="Egyptian Revival architecture">
<text>Egyptian Revival is an architectural style that uses the motifs and imagery of ancient Egypt. It is attributed generally to the public awareness of ancient Egyptian monuments generated by Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Egypt in 1798, and Admiral Nelson&#x27;s defeat of the French Navy at the Battle of the Nile later that year. Napoleon took a scientific expedition with him to Egypt. Publication of the expedition&#x27;s work, the &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot;, began in 1809 and was published as a series through 1826. The size and monumentality of the façades discovered during his adventure cemented the hold of Egyptian aesthetics on the Parisian elite. However, works of art and architecture (such as funerary monuments) in the Egyptian style had been made or built occasionally on the European continent since the time of the Renaissance.

==History==
===Egyptian influence before Napoleon===
Much of the early knowledge about ancient Egyptian arts and architecture was filtered through the lens of the Classical world, including ancient Rome. Prior to Napoleon&#x27;s influence an early example is the Obelisk of Domitian, erected in 1651 by Bernini on top of the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi in Piazza Navona, Rome, which went on to inspire several Egyptian obelisks constructed in Ireland during the early 18th century. It influenced the obelisk constructed as a family funeral memorial by Sir Edward Lovett Pearce for the Allen family at Stillorgan in Ireland in 1717, one of several Egyptian obelisks erected in Ireland during the early 18th century. Others may be found at Belan, County Kildare; and Dangan, County Meath. Conolly&#x27;s Folly in County Kildare is probably the best known, albeit the least Egyptian-styled.

Egyptian buildings had also been built as garden follies. The most elaborate was probably the one built by Duke Frederick I of Württemberg in the gardens of the Château de Montbéliard. It included an Egyptian bridge across which guests walked to reach an island with an elaborate Egyptian-influenced bath house. Designed by Jean-Baptiste Kléber, later French commander in Egypt, the building had a billiards room and a bagnio.

During the 2nd half of the 18th century, with the rise of Neoclassicism, sometimes architects mixed the Ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian styles. They wanted to discover new shape and ornament ideas, rather than to be just faithful copyists of the past.

===Napoleonic and Post-Napoleonic eras===
New after the Napoleonic invasion was a sudden increase of the number of works of art and the fact that, for the first time, entire buildings began to be built to resemble those of ancient Egypt. In France and Britain this was at least partially inspired by successful war campaigns undertaken by each country while in Egypt.

For Napoleon&#x27;s intention of cataloguing the sights and findings from the campaign, hundreds of artists and scientists were enlisted to document &quot;antiquities, ethnography, architecture, and natural history of Egypt&quot;; and later these notes and sketches were taken back to Europe. In 1803, the compilation of &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot; was started based on these documents and lasted over twenty years. The content in this archaeological text, includes translation of the Rosetta Stone, pyramids and other scenes, arouse interests in Egyptian arts and culture in Europe and America.

According to James Stevens Curl, people started to present their imaginations about Egypt in various ways. First, combinations of crocodiles, pyramids, mummies, sphinxes, and other motifs were widely circulated. In 1800, an Egyptian opera festival was staged in Drury Lane, London, with Egyptian-themed sets and costumes. On the other hand, William Capon (1757–1827) suggested a massive pyramid for Shooter&#x27;s Hill as a National Monument, while George Smith (1783–1869) designed an Egyptian-style tomb for Ralph Abercromby in Alexandria.

According to David Brownlee, the 1798 Karlsruhe Synagogue, an early building by the influential Friedrich Weinbrenner was &quot;the first large Egyptian building to be erected since antiquity.&quot; According to Diana Muir, it was &quot;the first public building (that is, not a folly, stage set, or funeral monument) in the Egyptian revival style.&quot; The ancient Egyptian influence was mainly shown in the two large engaged pylons flanking the entrance; otherwise the windows and entrance of the central section were pointed arches, and the overall plan conventional, with Neo-Gothic details.

Among the earliest monuments of the Egyptian Revival in Paris is the Fontaine du Fellah, built in 1806. It was designed by François-Jean Bralle. A well-documented example, destroyed after Napoleon was deposed, was the monument to General Louis Desaix in the Place des Victoires was built in 1810. It featured a nude statue of the general and an obelisk, both set upon an Egyptian Revival base. Another example of a still standing site of Egyptian Revival is the Egyptian Gate of Tsarskoe Selo, built in 1829.

A street or passage named the Place du Caire or Foire du Caire (Fair of Cairo) was built in Paris in 1798 on the former site of the convent of the &quot;Filles de la Charité&quot;. No. 2 Place du Caire, from 1828, is essentially in overall form a conventional Parisian structure with shops on the ground floor and apartments above, but with considerable Egyptianizing decoration including a row of massive Hathor heads and a frieze by sculptor J. G. Garraud.

One of the first British buildings to show an Egyptian Revival interior was the newspaper office of the &quot;Courier&quot; on the Strand, London. It was built in 1804 and featured a cavetto (coved) cornice and Egyptian-influenced columns with palmiform capitals. Other early British examples include the Egyptian Hall in London, completed in 1812, and the Egyptian Dining Room at Goodwood House (1806). There was also the Egyptian Gallery, a private room in the home of connoisseur Thomas Hope to display his Egyptian antiquities, and illustrated in engravings from his meticulous line drawings in his book &quot;Household Furniture&quot; (1807), were a prime source for the Regency style of British furnishings.

=== Rise of Egyptian Revival in America ===

The first Egyptian Revival building in the United States was the 1824 synagogue of Congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia. It was followed by a series of major public buildings in the first half of the 19th century including the 1835 Moyamensing Prison, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, the 1836 Fourth District Police Station in New Orleans and the 1838 New York City jail known as the Tombs. Other public buildings in Egyptian style included the 1844 Old Whaler&#x27;s Church in Sag Harbor, New York, the 1846 First Baptist Church of Essex, Connecticut, the 1845 Egyptian Building of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond and the 1848 United States Custom House (New Orleans). The most notable Egyptian structure in the United States was the Washington Monument, begun in 1848, this obelisk originally featured doors with cavetto cornices and winged sun disks, later removed. The National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, is another example of Egyptian revival architecture and art.

Around the 1870s, Americans started to become interested in other cultures, including those of Japan, the Middle East and North Africa, leading to a second period of interest in Egyptian revival. Egyptian motifs and symbols were commonly used in the design including elements of &quot;gilt bronze fittings shaped like sphinxes, Egyptian scenes woven into textiles, and geometric renderings of plants such as palm fronds&quot;.

Some Americans in the 1880s believed that the United States was a nation without art and therefore wanted to innovate in the field of aesthetic design to distinguish it from Egyptian pyramids and obelisks, Greek temples, and Gothic spires. But implementing such innovations was difficult, and as Clarence King said, &quot;Till there is an American race there cannot be an American style&quot;. The creation of the American style was also hindered by the fact that the ethnic mix of the American people did not constitute a race. In the time that followed, however, America&#x27;s own culture was assimilating Egyptian revivalist architecture, and their tectonic significance became unstable. This may be because the United States of the early 20th century was a confident nation, and the approach of defining one&#x27;s own spiritual world by establishing a connection to a great civilization like ancient Egypt faded in such a cultural context.

=== Other countries ===
The South African College in the then-British Cape Colony features an &quot;Egyptian building&quot; constructed in 1841; the Egyptian Revival building of the Cape Town Hebrew Congregation is also still standing.

The York Street Synagogue was Australia&#x27;s first Egyptian revival building, followed by the Hobart Synagogue, the Launceston Synagogue and the Adelaide Hebrew Congregation, all by 1850. The earliest obelisk in Australia was erected at Macquarie Place, Sydney in 1818.

===Later revivals===
The expeditions that eventually led to the discovery in 1922 of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb by archaeologist Howard Carter resulted in a 20th-century revival. The revival during the 1920s is sometimes considered to be part of the Art Deco style. This phase gave birth to the Egyptian Theatre movement, largely confined to the United States. The Egyptian Revival decorative arts style was present in furniture and other household objects, as well as in architecture.

==== Hieroglyphics ====
Many notable works in Britain featured attempts by architects to translate and depict messages in Egyptian hieroglyphs. Although sincere attempts at compositions, understanding of hieroglyphic syntax and semantics has advanced since they were built and errors have been discovered in many of these works. Although both public and private buildings were built in Britain in the Egyptian Revival style, the vast majority of those with attempts at accurate inscriptions were public works or on entrances to public buildings.

In 1824, French classical scholar and egyptologist Jean-François Champollion published &quot;Precis du systeme hieroglyphique des anciens Egyptiens&quot; in 1824, which spurred the first notable attempts to decipher the hieroglyphic language in Britain. Joseph Bonomi the Younger&#x27;s inscriptions in the entrance lodges to Abney Park Cemetery in 1840 was the first real recorded attempt to compose a legible text. An Egyptologist himself, Bonomi and other scholars such as Samuel Birch, Samuel Sharpe, William Osburne, and others would compose texts for a variety of other British projects throughout the nineteenth century including Marshall&#x27;s Mill in Leeds, an aedicula in the grounds of Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire, and as part of an Egyptian exhibition in The Crystal Palace after it was re-erected in southeast London.

The content of the inscriptions varied depending on the nature of their specific projects. The Crystal Palace exhibition features several different inscriptions, with the main inscription detailing the construction and content of the hall and proclaiming it as an educational asset to the community. It ends with a message to invoke good fortune, translated as &#x27;let it be prosperous.&#x27; Other smaller inscriptions on the cornice of the exhibit entrance feature the names of the builders and a message in Greek wishing for the health and well-being of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, members of the royal family. The main inscription is accompanied by an English translation, with the characters spaced to match the position of the English words. However, Chris Elliot notes that the translation overly relies on phonetic transliteration and features some unusual characters for words that were difficult to translate into hieroglyphs.

<text>William Cureton (180817 June 1864) was an English Orientalist.

==Life==
He was born in Westbury, Shropshire. After being educated at the Adams&#x27; Grammar School in Newport, Shropshire and at Christ Church, Oxford, he took orders in 1832, became chaplain of Christ Church, sublibrarian of the Bodleian, and, in 1837, assistant keeper of manuscripts in the British Museum. He was afterwards appointed select preacher to the University of Oxford, chaplain in ordinary to the queen, rector of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, and canon of Westminster Abbey. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and a trustee of the British Museum, and was also honored by several continental societies. For a time Cureton also served as curate of St Andrew&#x27;s, Oddington, Oxfordshire.

==Works==
Cureton&#x27;s most remarkable work was the edition with notes and an English translation of the Epistles of Ignatius to Polycarp, the Ephesians and the Romans, from a Syriac manuscript that had been found in the monastery of St. Mary Deipara, in the desert of Nitria, near Cairo. He held that the manuscript he used gave the truest text, that all other texts were inaccurate, and that the epistles contained in the manuscript were the only genuine epistles of Ignatius that we possess, a view which received the support of Ferdinand Christian Baur, Bunsen, and many other eminent scholars, but which was opposed by Charles Wordsworth and by several German scholars, and is now generally abandoned. Cureton supported his view by his &quot;Vindiciae Ignatianae&quot; and his &quot;Corpus Ignatianum, a Complete Collection of the Ignatian Epistles, genuine, interpolated and spurious&quot;.

He also edited:

* a partial Syriac text of the &quot;Festal Letters of St Athanasius&quot;, which was translated into English by Henry Burgess (1854), and published in the &quot;Library of Fathers of the Holy Catholic Church&quot;; 
*&quot;Remains of a very Ancient Recension of the Four Gospels in Syriac, hitherto unknown in Europe&quot;; This came to be known as the Curetonian Gospels after Cureton. 
*&quot;Spicilegium Syriacum, containing Remains of Bardesan, Meliton, Ambrose, Mara Bar Serapion&quot;; 
*&quot;The third Part of the Ecclesiastical History of John, Bishop of Ephesus&quot;, which was translated by Robert Payne Smith; 
*&quot;Fragments of the Iliad of Homer from a Syriac Palimpsest&quot;; 
*an Arabic work known as the Thirty-first Chapter of the Book entitled &quot;The Lamp that guides to Salvation&quot;, written by a Christian of Tekrit; 
*&quot;The Book of Religious and Philosophical Sects&quot;, by Mohammed al Sharastani;
*a &quot;Commentary on the Book of Lamentations, by Rabbi Tanchum&quot;; 
*the &quot;Pillar of the Creed of the Sunnites&quot;.

Cureton also published several sermons, among which was one entitled &quot;The Doctrine of the Trinity not Speculative but Practical&quot;. After his death William Wright edited with a preface the &quot;Ancient Syriac Documents relative to the earliest Establishment of Christianity in Edessa and the neighboring Countries, from the Year of our Lords Ascension to the beginning of the Fourth Century; discovered, edited and annotated by the late W. Cureton&quot;.

<doc id="515947" wikidata="Q34084" url="?curid=515947" title="Monie Love">
<text>Simone Johnson (born Simone Gooden) (born 2 July 1970), better known by her stage name Monie Love, is an English rapper, actress, and radio personality known for her singles during the late 1980s and the 1990s. Love is a radio personality for urban adult contemporary station KISS 104.1 WALR-FM in Atlanta. Love is a pioneer female emcee, a two-time Grammy Award nominee, the first British female hip hop artist to hold that distinction.

==Career==
===Music===
Love&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, was released on 6 November 1990. It spawned the singles &quot;Monie in the Middle&quot; (a track dealing with a woman&#x27;s right to determine what she wants out of a relationship) and &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame (My Sister)&quot; (which sampled the (Detroit) Spinners&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame&quot;, written for the band by the US musician Stevie Wonder). It also featured house-music vocalist and then-labelmate Ultra Naté. The album reached No. 26 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Love also appears on the song titled &quot;United&quot; from Inner City&#x27;s third album, &quot;Praise&quot;, and raps a response verse from the woman&#x27;s perspective on a 1989 remix of the Fine Young Cannibals hit, &quot;She Drives Me Crazy&quot;.

Love was featured on the LA Reid &amp; Babyface remix of Whitney Houston&#x27;s R&amp;B hit &quot;My Name Is Not Susan&quot; in 1991, and appeared in the music video alongside Houston. Love&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;Full-Term Love&quot;, from the &quot;Class Act&quot; movie soundtrack, reached No. 7 on the Hot Hip-Hop Singles chart. Love collaborated with Marley Marl on her second album, &quot;In a Word or 2&quot; (1993), which featured the Prince-produced single &quot;Born To B.R.E.E.D.&quot; (which reached No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music chart and No. 7 on the Hot Rap Singles chart), as well as a re-release of &quot;Full-Term Love&quot;. The same year, Prince asked her to write lyrics for a few songs on a side-project, Carmen Electra&#x27;s eponymous album, &quot;Carmen Electra&quot;. Love&#x27;s last release as lead artist was the single &quot;Slice of da Pie&quot; in 2000. In 2013, she was featured on the track &quot;Sometimes&quot; by Ras Kass, from his album &quot;Barmageddon&quot;, and in 2021, she released a single called “Divine”, featuring Skyzoo and a friend of theirs called Tuff.

===US Radio===
From 2004 until the week of 11 December 2006, Love was the morning drive host on Philadelphia&#x27;s WPHI-FM 100.3. The &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; confirmed on 22 December that Love left WPHI-FM on amicable terms after contract negotiations stalled. Love&#x27;s departure from WPHI followed soon after her December 2006 interview with Young Jeezy, where the two argued over whether hip hop is dead. Love is also an official MySpace.com DJ, according to her Myspace page. She has a radio show on XM Satellite Radio called &quot;Ladies First Radio with Monie Love&quot;. It airs Thursdays 6 PM ET and Sundays 8 PM ET. In 2015, Love became a DJ on Philadelphia&#x27;s Boom 107.9, hosting a morning show from 6 am to 10 am. In 2016, Love co-hosted with Ed Lover on the Ed Lover Morning Show for &quot;Boom 92&quot; KROI in Houston, Texas. In 2018, Monie Love did the workday and lunch break from 10am-3pm on 106.7 WTLC in Indianapolis, Indiana. In May 2019, she began hosting afternoons at &quot;KISS 104.1&quot; WALR in Atlanta.

==Personal life==
Born in England to a jazz musician father, Love has two brothers, Richard and David Gooden (known as Dave Angel), and a sister named Rosanna Sharian Gooden (who is a singer known as Baz). Love moved to America, settling in New York City in March 1988. She has four children. She has been married twice and is a single parent. She is of Jamaican descent.

<doc id="515951" wikidata="Q5742666" url="?curid=515951" title="Hero Games">
<text>Hero Games (&quot;DOJ, Inc dba Hero Games&quot;) is the publisher of the Hero System, a generic roleplaying rules set that can be used to simulate many different genres, and was the co-developer of the &quot;Fuzion&quot; system.

==History==

In 1981, George MacDonald and Steve Peterson, from San Mateo, California, printed 1,000 copies of a 64-page rulebook for &quot;Champions&quot;, their super-hero role-playing game, to take to a Bay Area gaming convention. It sold very strongly, enough to form a company, Hero Games. Later, the pair recruited Ray Greer as their sales and marketing partner. 

In the following years, the company published two more editions of &quot;Champions&quot;, two dozen adventures, and several self-contained role-playing games using the &quot;Champions&quot; core rules as a universal role-playing system: &quot;Danger International&quot;, &quot;Justice, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Robot Warriors&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot;, and &quot;Star Hero&quot;. The games were very compatible, but each differed slightly, using new rules or costs. Hero Games used the term Hero System to describe them all.

Ongoing production and financial troubles plagued the company, however, and in January 1986, Hero Games made an arrangement with Iron Crown Enterprises, publishers of &quot;Rolemaster&quot; and &quot;MERP&quot;. Initially, this was only to handle the game production and distribution, leaving creative tasks to Hero Games, but in 1987 ICE also took over editorial. During this period the company was led by Rob Bell, followed by Monte Cook, and finally by Bruce Harlick.

The original partners found new interests: Greer worked for Steve Jackson Games, and later he joined a Los Angeles movie special effects company run by Mark Williams, Hero Games&#x27;s original artist. MacDonald became Senior Game Developer at the software company Strategic Simulations, Inc. Peterson went to work for Electronic Arts, and then became a freelance marketing consultant and technical writer, but remained most connected with Hero Games of the original three.

On April 25, 1996, ICE&#x27;s role in handling publishing and distribution was taken over by R. Talsorian Games, just before Iron Crown itself suffered financial difficulties in 1997. During this period, Bruce Harlick, who had been the first official hire of Hero Games in 1982, continued in his role as Line Developer. This collaboration also resulted in the Fuzion system, which was successful in itself, but an attempt to publish the Champions game under the new system as &quot;&quot; met mixed reviews.

In 2000, Hero Games was bought by Cybergames.com, a gaming portal site which Steve Peterson was working for. Cybergames.com retained Bruce Harlick as president of their Hero Games subsidiary, but eventually decided to leave the publishing market in 2001. In December 2001, a new company called DOJ, Inc. acquired all rights to Hero Games, keeping none of the remaining original staff.
DOJ, Inc., consisted of Steven S. Long (line developer), Darren Watts (president), and various support staff. It was formed specifically to acquire Hero Games. The title came from &quot;Defenders of Justice&quot;, Watts&#x27;s &quot;Champions&quot; campaign.

In 2011 Darren Watts left DOJ, Inc., to pursue other ventures, and warehouse manager Jason S. Walters assumed the role of CEO, acting in consultation with Steve Long and its other investors. The company now focuses on promoting stand-alone products that utilize various versions of the 6th Edition Hero System rules.

==Current Publications==

===Role-playing games===
Besides the Hero System itself, Hero Games is also the publisher of genre books which supplement the generic system: &quot;Champions&quot; , a role-playing game where players can create and play superheroes; &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot;, where characters operate in a fantasy setting; &quot;Star Hero&quot;, which uses science fiction settings; &quot;Dark Champions&quot;, which simulates various forms of the action-adventure genre; and many other games. &quot;Champions&quot;, originally published as a stand-alone game in 1981, was the catalyst for the creation of the Hero System.

All of the above games, as well as nearly all games published by the company, use the Hero System as their basis. While early editions included the system rules with each genre book, this ended with the Fourth Edition of &quot;Champions&quot;. Currently, the Sixth Edition of the rules is a pair of books, and the &quot;genre books&quot; show how to use the system to reflect the conventions of superheroic, fantasy, science fiction, and other adventure genres.

Former exceptions to the &quot;Hero System only&quot; rule are &quot;&quot; and its supplements, published in the late 1990s using the &quot;Fuzion&quot; system.

Recent Hero Games publications include Champions Complete, a stand-alone, moderately priced book for playing Champions, and the Monster Hunter International Employee Handbook, a stand-alone roleplaying game detailing the world of Larry Correia&#x27;s Monster Hunter International.

===Expansion books===
Hero Games also published a series of &quot;ultimate&quot; expansion books for the Fifth Edition, which provided an additional level of detail on specific types of characters or accessories, over what was explained in more general terms in the main Hero System rules or genre books. Examples of this line included &quot;The Ultimate Martial Artist&quot; and &quot;The Ultimate Vehicle&quot;. Only one such title has been released for the Sixth Edition, &quot;The Ultimate Base&quot;, although some older titles are being revised into Hero System Core Library titles such as &quot;Hero System Martial Arts&quot; and &quot;Hero System Vehicles&quot;.

===Game settings===
Finally, the company publishes a number of game settings for its most popular genres, along with supplements to flesh those settings out. The &quot;main&quot; (that is, most strongly supported) setting for &quot;Champions&quot; is Millennium City; for &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot;, The Turakian Age; for &quot;Star Hero&quot;, the Terran Empire; and for &quot;Dark Champions&quot;, Hudson City. Other settings are also available for those who prefer a different &quot;feel&quot; than these provide. All fit into a single, universal timeline, known as the Hero Universe.

All of the above are supported, to varying extents, by the Digital Hero online magazine.

===Hero Comics and Hero Graphics===
Many characters seen in the early &quot;Champions&quot; rulebooks later appeared in comic books from Hero Comics (later, Hero Graphics), and kicked off with a limited series by Eclipse Comics. Few of these characters are still used by the company (now known as Heroic Publishing), although Icestar is mentioned as a casualty from &quot;The Battle of Detroit&quot; in &quot;Champions Universe&quot;. Like the Villains and Vigilantes comic book limited series, the early issues printed write-up sheets allowing readers to use characters introduced in the comics in their own Champions campaigns. Strangely, this is even true for characters included in the core rules, such as Icicle, Pulsar, and Mechanon.

===Digital Hero online magazine===
Digital Hero was the official online magazine for Hero Games, supporting its Hero System games including Champions, Fantasy Hero, Star Hero, Dark Champions, and others. It was published bimonthly in downloadable PDF format, each issue being a fixed 64 pages long not including the cover (and a blank &quot;fluff&quot; page serving as an inside front cover to facilitate double-sided printing). The final issue, number 47, was published in January 2008, although the company did indicate the possibility of a return in the future.

<doc id="515953" wikidata="Q267874" url="?curid=515953" title="Civic Center, San Francisco">
<text>The Civic Center in San Francisco, California, is an area located a few blocks north of the intersection of Market Street and Van Ness Avenue that contains many of the city&#x27;s largest government and cultural institutions. It has two large plazas (Civic Center Plaza and United Nations Plaza) and a number of buildings in classical architectural style. The Bill Graham Civic Auditorium (formerly the Exposition Auditorium), the United Nations Charter was signed in the Veterans Building&#x27;s Herbst Theatre in 1945, leading to the creation of the United Nations. It is also where the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco (the peace treaty that officially ended the Pacific War with the Empire of Japan, which had surrendered in 1945) was signed. The San Francisco Civic Center was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places on October 10, 1978.

==Location==
The Civic Center is bounded by Market Street to the southeast, Franklin Street to the west, Turk Street to the north, and Leavenworth Street, McAllister Street, and Charles J. Brenham Place to the east. The Civic Center borders the Tenderloin neighborhood on the north and east and the Hayes Valley neighborhood on the west; Market Street separates it from the South of Market, or &quot;SoMa&quot;, neighborhood.

==History==

The first permanent San Francisco City Hall was completed in 1898 on a triangular-shaped plot in what later became Civic Center, bounded by Larkin, McAllister, and Market, after a protracted construction effort that had started in 1871; although the constructors had promised to complete work within two years, &quot;honest graft&quot; was an accepted practice, and the cost of the structure ballooned from $1 million as budgeted to $8 million.

The Civic Center was built in the early 20th century after the earlier City Hall was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire. Although the architect and urban planner Daniel Burnham had provided the city with plans for a neo-classical Civic Center shortly before the 1906 earthquake, his plans were never carried out. Burnham&#x27;s plan called for a large semi-circular plaza at the intersection of Market and Van Ness as a hub linking official buildings along spoked streets.
Following the earthquake, a temporary city hall was established on Market Street, but planning for a permanent structure and civic center did not take place for several years. The current Civic Center was planned by a group of local architects, chaired by John Galen Howard. The new Civic Center would consist of five main buildings facing a central rectangular plaza: City Hall, Auditorium, Main Library, Opera House, and State Office Building. A bond was issued on March 29, 1912, for $8.8 million to carry out the construction of the new Civic Center; at the time, the city only owned the triangular-shaped plot where the old City Hall had stood prior to the earthquake. A resolution passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors required the new City Hall to be built on the site of the old City Hall, so early plans for Civic Center showed City Hall east of the central plaza. Opinions solicited by the consulting architectural team led to the relocation of City Hall to the west side of the plaza. Ground was broken for City Hall, the first building in the new Civic Center, on April 5, 1913.
The current City Hall was completed in 1915, in time for the Panama–Pacific International Exposition. The second building to be started was Exposition Auditorium; at the time, plans included a new Main Library (to be built on the site of the old City Hall) but left the former Marshall Square (bounded by Larkin, Fulton, Hyde, and Grove) undeveloped. Plans for a new opera house on Marshall Square had been dropped The Main Library (1916), the California State Building (1926), War Memorial Opera House and its neighboring twin, the War Memorial Veterans Building (which together were the nucleus of the San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center, completed in 1932), and the Old Federal Building (1936) were all completed after the Exposition. Civic Center Plaza was established by 1915, but not completed until 1925. Marshall Square remained undeveloped until the new Main Library was constructed there in the early 1990s.

During World War II, Army barracks and Victory gardens were constructed in Civic Center Plaza, which lies directly east of City Hall and west of the Library. The 1950s through the 1970s and 1980s saw tall post-modernist Federal and State buildings constructed in the area; an underground exhibition facility, Brooks Hall, was completed beneath the plaza in 1958, followed by an adjoining garage in 1960. The Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall and Harold L. Zellerbach Rehearsal Hall were added in 1980. The 1990s saw the construction of a new Main Library on the unoccupied Marshall Square block, and the old Main Library building was converted into the Asian Art Museum, and the removal of all public benches. In 1998, the city officially renamed part of the plaza the Joseph L. Alioto Performing Arts Piazza after the former mayor.

Its central location, vast open space, and the collection of government buildings have made and continue to make Civic Center the scene of massive political rallies. It has been the scene of massive anti-war protests and rallies since the Korean War. It was also the scene of major moments of the Gay Rights Movement. Activist Harvey Milk held rallies and gave speeches there. After his assassination on November 27, 1978, a massive candlelight vigil was held there. Later, it was the scene of the White Night Riots in response to the lenient sentencing of Dan White, Milk&#x27;s assassin. Recently, Civic Center was the center point of same-sex marriage activism, as Mayor Gavin Newsom married couples there.

==Attractions and characteristics==
===Government center===
The centerpiece of the Civic Center is the City Hall, which heads the complex and takes up two city blocks on Polk Street. The section of the street in front of the building was renamed for Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett, a local African American activist. Across the street on McAllister Street is the headquarters of the Supreme Court of California. Across from that building is the Asian Art Museum, opened in 2004 in the former main branch building of the San Francisco Public Library, which moved to a newer building constructed just south of Fulton in 1995.

North of City Hall is the Phillip Burton Federal Building and United States Courthouse for the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and State of California office buildings. This includes offices of several federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation San Francisco Field Office. East of the main Civic Center complex on nearby Mission Street, is the head courthouse of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which sits across 7th from the San Francisco Federal Building complex.

===Monuments===
The Pioneer Monument, funded by the estate of James Lick and dedicated to Manifest Destiny, is located in the middle of Fulton Street between the Library and the Asian Art Museum. The section of Fulton Street between Hyde and Leavenworth streets was pedestrianized and re-developed into United Nations Plaza in 1975 as a monument for the United Nations and the signing of the UN Charter, when the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway was constructed under Market Street. The pedestrian mall was designed by Lawrence Halprin. It was rededicated in June 1995 by visiting members of the UN General Assembly as part of its 50th anniversary, and renovated and rededicated again in 2005 during the World Environment Day event. Currently, it is the site of a small farmers&#x27; market as well as a replica of a large equestrian statue of Simon Bolivar.

===Culture===
West of City Hall on Van Ness Avenue is the War Memorial Opera House, where the U.N. Charter was signed in 1945 and the Treaty of San Francisco was signed in 1951. Davies Symphony Hall is south of the Opera House; to its north is the War Memorial Veterans Building, which contains the Herbst Theatre. The Bill Graham Civic Auditorium and SHN Orpheum Theatre are also located in Civic Center.

===Parks and open spaces===
The main open space just east of City Hall is Civic Center Plaza. Despite the area&#x27;s seedy reputation due to its proximity to the Tenderloin, its central location also makes it the center of many of the city&#x27;s festivals and parades. Many street parades and parties are held in Civic Center Plaza, including San Francisco&#x27;s Gay Pride Parade, the city&#x27;s Earth Day celebration (which attracts 15,000+ people), the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade, San Francisco&#x27;s version of the Love Parade, and the San Francisco LovEvolution party.

Renovated and re-opened on February 15, 2018, the Helen Diller Civic Center Playgrounds reside on the northeast and southeast corners of the Civic Center Plaza. The San Francisco Parks and Recreation program partnered with The Trust for Public Land to renovate the 20 year old playgrounds. The playgrounds were funded by a generous $10 million donation from the Helen Diller Family Foundation. The playgrounds serve many surrounding neighborhoods with limited open space such as the Tenderloin, Western Addition, Hayes Valley, and South of Market neighborhoods.

===Transit===
Access to Civic Center is provided by the Civic Center Station on Market, a subway stop for both BART and the Muni Metro. The F Market historic streetcar line and many Muni bus lines also run nearby.

===Education===
Civic Center is the site of four famous higher education schools: Minerva Schools at KGI, the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, the private The Art Institute of California – San Francisco and The San Francisco Conservatory of Music. UC Hastings is located on the two blocks straddling Hyde between Golden Gate and McAllister. Academy of Art University owns two buildings in the neighborhood, and the buildings are used primarily for academic and administrative purposes.

===Other points of interest===
The Fox Plaza condominium complex is also located nearby. The large art installation &quot;Firefly&quot; by Ned Kahn can be seen on the side of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission building on Golden Gate Avenue.

In December 2010, a set of innovative wind and solar hybrid streetlamps provided by Urban Green Energy were installed as part of the center&#x27;s vision for sustainability.

<text>This is a list of pyramid mausoleums in North America. This Egyptian Revival funerary architecture was generally an extravagance of American tycoons who wanted themselves remembered as long and as well as the ancient pharaohs. Many of these date from the 1890s to the 1920s, when older, more modest expressions of &quot;Egyptomania&quot; gave way to &quot;Egyptian temples or pyramids replete with guardian sphinxes, lotus-bedecked urns and columns, and Egyptian- themed stained glass windows.&quot;

<doc id="515958" wikidata="Q1129737" url="?curid=515958" title="Lezgins">
<text>Lezgins ( or ) are a Northeast Caucasian ethnic group native predominantly to southern Dagestan, a republic of Russia, and northeastern Azerbaijan, and speak the Lezgin language. Their social structure is firmly based on equality and deference to individuality. Lezgin society is structured around &quot;djamaat&quot; () and has traditionally been egalitarian and organised around many autonomous local clans, called sykhyls (сихилар).

The land of the Lezgins has been subject to multiple invaders throughout history. Its isolated terrain and the strategic value outsiders have placed on the areas settled by Lezgins has contributed much to the Lezgin community ethos and helped shape its national character. Due to constant attacks from the invaders, the Lezgins have developed a national code of honor and conduct, Lezgiwal, passed down from generation to generation by parents and society. It implies moral and ethical behaviour, generosity and the will to safeguard the honor of women.

== Etymology ==
The eagle being the Lezgin national animal, the term &quot;Lezgi&quot; is said to derive from &quot;Lek&quot;, the Lezgin word for &quot;eagle&quot;. Others believe &quot;Lezgi&quot; to be derived from the ancient &quot;Legi&quot; and early medieval &quot;Lakzi&quot;.

Ancient Greek historians, including Herodotus, Strabo, and Pliny the Elder, referred to the &quot;Legoi&quot; (or ) people who inhabited Caucasian Albania.

Arab historians of the 9th and 10th centuries mentioned a kingdom called Lakz, in present-day southern Dagestan. Al Masoudi referred to inhabitants of this area as Lakzams (Lezgins), who defended Shirvan against invaders from the north.

Prior to the Russian Revolution, &quot;Lezgin&quot; was a term applied to all ethnic groups inhabiting the present-day Russian Republic of Dagestan. In the 19th century, the term was used more broadly for all ethnic groups speaking non-Nakh Northeast Caucasian languages, including Caucasian Avars, Laks, and many others (although the Vainakh peoples, who were Northeast Caucasian language speakers were referred to as &quot;Circassians&quot;).

==History==
In the 4th century BC, the numerous tribes speaking Lezgic languages united in a union of 26 tribes, formed in the Eastern Caucasus state of Caucasian Albania, which itself was incorporated in the Persian Achaemenid Empire in 513 BC. Under Persian and Parthian rule Caucasian Albania was divided into several areas — Lakzi, Shirvan, etc.

The Lezgic speaking tribes participated in the battle of Gaugamela under the Persian banner against the invading Alexander the Great.

Under Parthian rule, Iranian political and cultural influence increased in the whole region of their Caucasian Albanian province, therefore including where the Lezgic speaking tribes lived. Whatever the sporadic suzerainty of Rome of the region due to their wars with the Parthians, the country was now a part—together with Iberia (East Georgia) and (Caucasian) Albania, where other Arsacid branches reigned—of a pan-Arsacid family federation. Culturally, the predominance of Hellenism, as under the Artaxiads, was now followed by again a predominance of &quot;Iranianism&quot;, and, symptomatically, instead of Greek, as before, Parthian became the language of the educated of the region. An incursion in this era was made by the Alans who between 134 and 136 attacked regions including where Lezgic tribes lived, but Vologases persuaded them to withdraw, probably by paying them.

In 252–253, rule over the Lezgic tribes changed from Parthian to Sassanid Persian. Caucasian Albania became a vassal state, now of the Sassanids, but retained its monarchy; the Albanian king had no real power and most civil, religious, and military authority lay with the Sassanid marzban (military governor) of the territory.

The Roman Empire obtained control over some of the southernmost Lezgin regions for a few years around 300 AD, but then the Sassanid Persians regained control and subsequently dominated the area for centuries until the Arab invasions.

Although Lezgins were first introduced to Islam perhaps as early as the 8th century, the Lezgins remained primarily animist until the 15th century, when Muslim influence became stronger, with Persian traders coming in from the south, and the Golden Horde increasingly pressing from the north. In the early 16th century, the Persian Safavids consolidated their control over large parts of Dagestan for centuries onwards. As a result of the Ottoman–Safavid War of 1578–1590, the Ottomans managed to wrest control of the region for a short period of time, until it was regained by the Safavids under king Abbas I (r. 1588–1629).

A notable Lezgin from the Safavid Iranian era was Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani, who served as Safavid &quot;grand vizier&quot; from 1716 to 1720, during the reign of king (&quot;shah&quot;) Sultan Husayn (1694–1722). By the early course of the 18th century, the Safavid Empire was in a state of heavy decline. In 1721, the Lezgins sacked and looted the city of Shamakhi, the provincial capital of Shirvan. The Lak Kazi Kumukh Khanate controlled a part of the Lezgins for a time in the 18th century after the disintegration of the Safavid Empire.

In the first half of the 18th century, Persia was able to restore its full authority throughout the entire Caucasus under Nader Shah. After the death of Nader, the area divided into multiple khanates. Some Lezgins were part of the Kuba Khanate in what is now Azerbaijan, while others fell under the jurisdiction of the Derbent Khanate and Kura Khanate. The main part of Lezgins united in &quot;free society&quot; (Magalim) (Akhty para (now Akhtynsky District), Kure (now Kurakhsky District), Alty-para and Dokuz-para (now Dokuzparinsky District)). Some Lezgin clans were in the Rutul Federation.

In 1813, as a result of the Treaty of Gulistan, the Russians gained control over southern Dagestan and most of what is the contemporary Azerbaijan Republic. The 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay indefinitely consolidated Russian control over Dagestan and other areas where the Lezgins lived and removed Iran from the military equation. The Russian administration subsequently created the Kiurin Khanate, later to become the Kiurin district. Many Lezgins in Dagestan, however, participated in the Great Caucasian War that started roughly during the same time the Russo-Persian Wars of the 19th century were happening, and fought against the Russians alongside the Avar Imam Shamil, who for 25 years (1834–1859) defied Russian rule. It was not until after his defeat in 1859 that the Russians consolidated their rule over Dagestan and the Lezgins.

==Culture==

Lezgins culture is a unique blend of native customs (adats). There is a strong theme of representing the nation with its national animal, the &quot;Lek&quot; (eagle), it&#x27;s connected with a strong value on the concept of freedom. A large majority of the nation&#x27;s national heroes fought for independence (Abrek Kiri Buba, Hadj-Dawud, etc.). Lezgins don&#x27;t like coercion, their social structure being firmly based on equality and deference to individuality. Lezgin society is structured around &quot;djamaat ()&quot; and about 200-300 &quot;syhils ().&quot; &quot;Syhils&quot; descended from a common ancestor who lived a long time ago and each &quot;syhil&quot; has its own village and mountain. &quot;Syhils&quot; are further subdivided into &quot;miresar&quot; (patronymic families). The main type of settlement in Lezghins - the village (&quot;hur&quot;). With regard to social groups Lezgin village, it is divided into quarters. Distributed large geographically related settlement (one quarter - one syhil). Each village had a rural area - Kim, a gathering of residents (male part) at the village assembly to address the most important issues of public life of the village.

=== Lezgiwal ===
Lezgiwal () an unwritten code of honor used as a set of ethical rules for Lezgins. It covers all spheres of life of any member of society, starting from childhood. Lezgival is a Code of honor and conduct passed down from generation to generation by parents and society. It implies moral and ethical behaviour, generosity and the will to safeguard the honor of women. The legendary Abrek Kiri Buba before he was killed by the Russians said &quot;Better a knife in the chest than honor in the dirt.&quot;

===Religion===
Lezgins like other Northeast Caucasian majority are Muslims, although, due to the long traditional beliefs, religion did not take root in its strict form. Under the influence of the neighbouring states, it was to a known extent suppressed, predominantly by Soviets, and nowadays plays a less significant role than the cultural traditions. However, the practitioners follow either the Shafi&#x27;i or the Hanafi schools of jurisprudence, fiqh. Lezgins celebrate &quot;Yaran Suvar&quot;, which dates to the pre-Islamic period, some also celebrate Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr.

=== Languages and literature ===

The Lezgin language belongs to the Lezgic branch of the Northeast Caucasian language family (with Aghul, Rutul, Tsakhur, Tabasaran, Budukh, Khinalug, Jek, Khaput, Kryts, and Udi).
The Lezgin language has three closely related (mutually intelligible) dialects: Kurin (also referred to as Gunei or Kurakh), Akhti, and Kuba. The Kurin dialect is the most widespread of the three and is spoken throughout most of the Lezgin territories in Daghestan, including the town of Kurakh, which, historically, was the most important cultural, political, and economic center in the Lezgin territory in Daghestan and is the former seat of the khanate of Kurin. The Akhti dialect is spoken in southeastern Daghestan. The Kuba dialect, the most Turkicized of the three, is widespread among the Lezgins of northern Azerbaijan (named for the town of Kuba, the cultural and economical focus of the region).

===Dances and music===

Lezgin dance, including the Lezgin solo male and pair dance, are common among many peoples of the Caucasus. The dance uses a 2 image. The man moves in the way &quot;eagle&quot;, alternates between a slow and rapid pace. The most spectacular movements are dance movements of men, when he is on his toes, throwing his hands in different directions. The woman moves in the form of &quot;Swan&quot;, bewitching graceful posture and smooth hand movements. The woman increases the tempo of her dance after the man. Not surprisingly, the dance, common among all the Caucasian peoples, was named in accordance with the ancient totem of the Lezgins: the word &quot;Lek&quot; () means eagle.Epic-historical songs about wars are popular among Lezghins, Best-known are the ballads &quot;Shamil atana&quot;(about Imam Shamil) and &quot;Kiri Buba.&quot; (about a Lezgin abrek). In the second half of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Lezgin culture and literature underwent a culture significantly influence Azerbaijan. First Lezgin theater originated in 1906 in the village of Akhty. In 1935, based on the semi-professional team was created Lezgin State Music and Drama Theatre named after S. Stalsky. In 1998, the State Lezgin theater was opened in Azerbaijan, located in Qusar.

==Demographics ==
=== Traditional homeland ===

The Lezgins inhabit a compact territory that straddles the border area of southern Dagestan and northern Azerbaijan. It lies, for the most part, in the southeastern portion of Daghestan in (Akhtynsky District, Dokuzparinsky District, Suleyman-Stalsky District, Kurakhsky District, Magaramkentsky District, Khivsky District, Derbentsky District and Rutulsky District) and contiguous northeastern Azerbaijan (in Kuba, Qusar, Qakh, Khachmaz, Oguz, Qabala, Nukha, and Ismailli districts).

The Lezgin territories are divided into two physiographic zones: a region of high, rugged mountains and the piedmont (foothills). Most of the Lezgin territory is in the mountainous zone, where a number of peaks (like Baba Dagh) reach over 3,500 meters in elevation. There are deep and isolated canyons and gorges formed by the tributaries of the Samur and Gulgeri Chai rivers. In the mountainous zones the summers are very hot and dry, with drought conditions a constant threat. There are few trees in this region aside from those in the deep canyons and along the streams themselves. Drought-resistant shrubs and weeds dominate the natural flora. The winters here are frequently windy and brutally cold. In this zone the Lezgins engaged primarily in animal husbandry (mostly sheep and goats) and in craft industries.

In the extreme east of the Lezgin territory, where the mountains give way to the narrow coastal plain of the Caspian Sea, and to the far south, in Azerbaijan, are the foothills. This region has relatively mild, very dry winters and hot, dry summers. Trees are few here also. In this region animal husbandry and artisanry were supplemented by some agriculture (along the alluvial deposits near the rivers).

Lezgins live mainly in Azerbaijan and Russia (Dagestan). The total population is believed to be around 700,000, with 474,000 living in Russia. In Azerbaijan, the government census counts 180,300. However, Lezgin national organizations mention 600,000 to 900,000, the disparity being that many Lezgins claim Azeri nationality to escape job and education discrimination in Azerbaijan. Despite the assimilationist policy of the Azeri government, the Lezgin population is undoubtedly greater than it appears.

As Svante Cornell adds;

Lezgins also live in Central Asia, mainly due to Stalin&#x27;s deportation policies.

===Azerbaijan===

Lezgins are, &quot;generally speaking&quot;, well integrated into the society of Azerbaijan. Mixed marriages are furthermore common. Lastly, Lezgins in Azerbaijan have a better level of education compared to their kin in Dagestan.

In 1992 a Lezgin organization named Sadval was established to promote Lezgin rights. Sadval campaigned for the redrawing of the Russian–Azerbaijani border to allow for the creation of a single Lezgin state encompassing areas in Russia and Azerbaijan where Lezgins were compactly settled. In Azerbaijan, a more moderate organization called Samur was formed, advocating more cultural autonomy for Lezgins in Azerbaijan.

Lezgins traditionally suffered from unemployment and a shortage of land. A major consequence of the outbreak of the war in First Chechen War in 1994 was the closure of the border between Russia and Azerbaijan: as a result, the Lezgins were for the first time in their history separated by an international border restricting their movement.

The high tide of Lezgin mobilization in Azerbaijan appeared to have passed towards the end of the 1990s. Sadval was banned by the Azerbaijani authorities after official allegations that it was involved in the 1994 Baku Metro bombings. The end of the Karabakh war, and Lezgin resistance to forced conscription, deprived the movement of a key issue on which to mobilize. In 1998 Sadval split into ‘moderate’ and ‘radical’ wings, following which it appeared to lose much of its popularity on both sides of the Russian–Azerbaijani border.

Lezgins expressed concern over underrepresentation in the Azerbaijani Parliament (Milli Meclis) after a shift away from proportional representation in the parliamentary elections of November 2005. Lezgins had been represented by two members of parliament in the previous parliament, but are now represented by only one.

Lezgins state that they face discrimination and that they feel forced to assimilate into Azeri identity to avoid economic and education discrimination. Therefore, the real number of Lezgins may be significantly higher than presented in censuses.

Lezgin is taught as a foreign language in areas where many Lezgins are settled, but teaching resources are scarce. Lezgin textbooks come from Russia and are not adapted to local conditions. Although Lezgin newspapers are available, Lezgins have also expressed concern over the disappearance of their rich oral tradition. The only Lezgin television broadcasting available in Azerbaijan is that received over the border from Russia.

In March 2006 Azerbaijani media reported that Sadval had formed an &#x27;underground&#x27; terrorist unit carrying out operations in Dagestan. Security forces across the border in Dagestan in Russia, responded skeptically to these reports having found no evidence.

=== Dagestan ===

According to reports Lezgins in Dagestan suffer disproportionately from unemployment, with unemployment rates in Lezgin-populated areas of southern Dagestan twice the republic average of 32 percent. This may be one contributory factor to renewed calls from within the Sadval movement in January 2006 for a redrawing of the Russian-Azerbaijani border to incorporate Lezgin-populated areas of southern Dagestan within Azerbaijan.

In March 1999 another organization, the Federal Lezgin National Cultural Autonomy, was established as an extraterritorial movement advocating cultural autonomy for Lezgins.

== Genetics==

According to a genetic study in 2023, the following haplogroups are found to predominate among Lezgins :

* J1 (63%)

* R1b (13%)

* G2 (7%)

* J2 (6%)

* E1b1b (3%)

Modern-day Lezgins speak Northeast Caucasian languages that have been spoken in the region before the introduction of Indo-European languages. They are closely related, both culturally and linguistically, to the Aghuls of southern Dagestan and, somewhat more distantly, to the Tsakhurs, Rutuls, and Tabasarans (the northern neighbors of the Lezgins). Also related, albeit more distantly, are the numerically small Jek, Kryts, Shahdagh, Budukh, and Khinalug peoples of northern Azerbaijan. These groups, together with the Lezgins, form the Samur branch of the indigenous Lezgic peoples.

Lezgins are believed to descend partly from people who inhabited the region of southern Dagestan in the Bronze Age. However, there is some DNA evidence of significant admixture during the last 4,000 years with a Central Asian population.

<text>Basel German or (Standard German: ) is the dialect of the city of Basel, Switzerland. 
The dialect of Basel forms a Low Alemannic linguistic exclave in the High Alemannic region.
== Phonetics and phonology ==
=== Consonants ===
==== Aspirated plosives ====
Basel German is characterised by aspirates which are absent or at least less common in other dialects. Compare Basel German (usually spelled ), pronounced more or less as Standard German , with with initial , used in all other Swiss German dialects, with the exception of the dialect of Chur. Thus, Basel German did not complete the second Germanic sound shift (High German consonant shift). Nowadays, many speakers pronounce the (or [χ], to be more exact), however. There are nevertheless still words that are never pronounced with , for example (Standard German , &#x27;to know&#x27;) or / (Standard German ). Typically, words from Standard German or Latin are pronounced with aspirated , too, which is not or only to a lesser extent done in other dialects.

Examples: or (name of letter), or (&#x27;to keep&#x27;), or (&#x27;park&#x27;); or (&#x27;tea&#x27; and name of letter), or (&#x27;great, swell&#x27;); /, (name of letter; &#x27;had&#x27;), / (&#x27;cupboard&#x27;), or (&#x27;to fall, throw&#x27;).

==== Affricates ====
Like other dialects and forms of the standard, Basel German has as well as .

Examples: (&#x27;pan&#x27;), (&#x27;tooth&#x27;), (&#x27;German&#x27;), (&#x27;stupid person&#x27;, traditional word), &quot;jacket&quot; (a traditional word), (&#x27;to understand&#x27;, from English &quot;to check&quot;).

==== Pronunciation of phoneme ====
A French-style pronunciation of as is also used in Basel German, although many younger speakers—especially those with foreign parents—also use a tapped which is more common in other Swiss German dialects. Traditionally, is voiceless , and it may sometimes be described as a lenis . The pronunciation &quot;per se&quot; seems to derive from French (originally Parisian), and was probably re-interpreted as a lenis according to Basel German phonology. Not surprisingly, French influence was for a long time dominant in Basel, with well-to-do families speaking French even at home. At least in clusters, the distinction between and is neutralised, as is the distinction between lenis and fortis consonants in clusters.

==== Lenition of consonants ====
Basel German also has more lenis sounds in word-initial position—for example, (&#x27;day&#x27;). This lenition is now often absent due to influence from other dialects, for example, the name of Santa Claus, , is now often pronounced with or , as is the word (Standard German ), which traditionally has a lenis sound, now also and .

==== Lenis plosives ====
Lenis plosives are however all voiceless; whereas fortis plosives are long or geminated. They are (like other lenis or short consonants) always preceded by long vowels, with the possible exception of unstressed vowels. According to Pilch, vowel length is not distinctive; however, vowel length is not always predictable: &#x27;to guess&#x27; has both a long vowel and a long/geminated consonant.

Examples: (&#x27;day&#x27;), (&#x27;around&#x27;), (&#x27;there&#x27;), or (&#x27;listen&#x27;), (&#x27;gas&#x27;). Phonemically speaking, may also be (more traditionally) transcribed , or as unvoiced .

==== Fortis consonants ====
Fortis or long consonants in general are more stable than in other dialects—&#x27;to swim&#x27; is always , whereas it is pronounced with only a short in other dialects. This is probably because in stressed words, short vowels only appear before double or geminated/long consonants. Hence, a word like is not possible in Basel German. As in other dialects, the difference between fortis and lenis is in length. Pilch (180) however interprets as alveolar, not long. Fortis consonants may also be transcribed , since lenis are often transcribed as .
However, voicing is always absent.

Examples: (&#x27;to swim&#x27;), (&#x27;to pack&#x27;), (&#x27;to squeeze&#x27;), (&#x27;to guess&#x27; — note the long followed by fortis )

=== Vowels ===
==== Unrounding of vowels ====
Unrounding was also typical, but now it has been abandoned by many speakers. Lengthening of vowels is also found, linking it more closely to Standard German than all other Swiss German dialects.

Examples: (&#x27;good day&#x27;; in other dialects, still more common), (&#x27;hell&#x27;, now rounded form more common), (&#x27;biggest, greatest&#x27;; now more common).

==== Lengthening and shortening of vowels ====
Lengthening always occurs before lenis (short) consonants, for example in words like (&#x27;day&#x27;), (&#x27;listen&#x27;), (&#x27;we&#x27;). Shortening, on the other hand, always occurs before long or fortis consonants, for example in , the name of the dialect: whereas other dialects have long in or any other word with (&#x27;German&#x27;) in it, Basel German always has short or . and (as well as ), however, are usually not shortened, probably because of the shift from earlier to . Another reason may be the fact that those are the only vowels that exist as such only as long vowels, i.e. whereas can be shortened to , it is never possible to shorten to because * as such does not exist in Basel German. Some speakers, however, use short open vowels in a number of words, e.g. instead of (&#x27;hook&#x27;). Those speakers who use this pronunciation lack one minimal pair, since also translates as &#x27;crouch&#x27;. However, this shortening of is not general. Note however that exists mainly in words of foreign origin such as .

==== Velarisation of MHG ====
Middle High German was velarised and appears as . For example, &#x27;street&#x27;.

==== Vowels before ====
Typically (but not exclusively) open vowels occur before ; for example, (&#x27;ear&#x27;) has the allophone , not . Both and only occur before in native words.

Additionally, vowels before are always long, with the exception of loan words such as &#x27;sorry&#x27;, &#x27;curry&#x27; as well as unstressed vowels.

Examples: &#x27;ear&#x27;, &#x27;honour&#x27;.

==== Pronunciation of ====
The vowels and traditionally are front, yet distinct from and . Nowadays, a back pronunciation and is more common.
Examples: (&#x27;bag&#x27;), (&#x27;Basel&#x27;).

==== Diphthongs ====
Modern pronunciation has , , [ɛj], , , , and ; traditional pronunciation lacks which is partly , partly . In modern pronunciation , , , are , , , whereas traditional pronunciation has , etc. Suter (1992: 11) posits only one diphthong , pronounced . In exclamations and few other words, also exist.

Examples: (&#x27;alone&#x27;), (&#x27;to turn&#x27;), (&#x27;three&#x27;), (&#x27;to build&#x27;), (&#x27;blue&#x27;), (&#x27;four&#x27;), (&#x27;shut&#x27;), (&#x27;new&#x27;); (&#x27;traditional&#x27;).

==Sociolinguistics==
Unlike other Alemannic dialects, Basel German features a rather strong dichotomy between the traditional form—Baseldytsch, used especially for the Carnival of Basel (Basler Fasnacht)—and normal spoken language. Some speakers prefer to use the more traditional variety in written form. The traditional variety is normally associated with the upper classes and with Fasnacht. Like other Swiss German dialects, Basel German has (at least in Basel) more prestige than Standard German, and it is now even used in churches.

==Spelling==
There is a lot of confusion especially when it comes to the use of the grapheme , which is often used for rounded sounds, i.e. or , whereas it is exclusively used for traditionally. Typically, lenis stops are spelled , , , fortis stops are spelled , , sometimes (, , &#x27;someone&#x27;); , , sometimes ( &#x27;middle&#x27;); , rarely and mainly in loan-words , , etc. This use of for the fortis, unaspirated consonant is used also in other varieties of Swiss German, but sometimes abandoned in favour of spellings more closely resembling Standard German spellings. Examples: (&#x27;to push&#x27;), (typical sweet cookie; but also ), (&#x27;bag&#x27;; but sometimes also ), (&#x27;bag&#x27;, traditional word). The fortis is always spelled like lenis , namely . The same is true for .

Obviously, especially the typical use of and leads to confusion, even among native speakers, since the dialect is not taught in schools. Aspirates are normally spelled as in Standard German, namely with , , . However, words where the aspirates derive from a lenis consonant plus are usually written as lenis plus , e.g., &#x27;to keep&#x27;, &#x27;to fall&#x27;.

==Terminology==

<text>The Commission of Government was a non-elected body that governed the Dominion of Newfoundland from 1934 to 1949. Established following the collapse of Newfoundland&#x27;s economy during the Great Depression, it was dissolved when the dominion became the tenth province of Canada on March 31, 1949. It was composed of civil servants who were directly subordinate to the British Government in London.

==Background==
Newfoundland&#x27;s economic difficulties were exacerbated by debt incurred during the First World War and the collapse of fish prices during the Depression. In 1933, following a prolonged period of economic crisis and severe budgetary deficit, and civil unrest culminating in a riot which brought down the previous government, the government of Prime Minister Frederick C. Alderdice asked the British and Canadian governments to establish a royal commission (the Newfoundland Royal Commission) to investigate the dominion&#x27;s continuing crisis and to suggest a solution to its problems.

The commission (commonly known as the &quot;Amulree Commission&quot;) was chaired by Lord Amulree, appointed by the British government, and also included Charles Alexander Magrath, appointed by the Canadian government, and Sir William Ewen Stavert, who represented the Newfoundland government.

The commission recommended the temporary suspension of responsible government in Newfoundland, and replacing it with a Commission of Government made up of the British-appointed Governor and six commissioners appointed by the Crown made up of three British officials and three Newfoundland-born appointees.

Alderdice was in favour of this recommendation and accordingly put it to the House of Assembly, which duly approved the proposals and thus voted itself out of existence.

== Governance by the Commission ==
The Commission of Government was sworn in on 16 February 1934, with Alderdice as vice-chairman, and immediately set about reforming the administration of the country in hopes of balancing the government&#x27;s budget. With the help of grants in aid from the United Kingdom, the Commission attempted to encourage agriculture and reorganize the fishing industry. While it did much to expand government health services to rural areas, for example, it could not solve the basic economic problems of a small export-oriented country during a time of worldwide economic stagnation.

American and Canadian military spending in Newfoundland during the 1940s caused an economic boom and allowed the Commission of Government to consider how to reintroduce a system of democratic government. However, the British government believed that wartime prosperity would be short-lived. So it established the Newfoundland National Convention in 1946 to debate constitutional options, which were submitted to the people in two referendums in 1948. By a slender majority, Newfoundlanders chose to become a province of Canada, rather than return to the status of a self-governing dominion. The Commission of Government continued to govern Newfoundland until March 31, 1949, when Newfoundland joined Canada.

<text>An enthymeme (, &quot;enthýmēma&quot;) is an argument with a hidden premise. Enthymemes are usually developed from premises that accord with the audience&#x27;s view of the world and what is taken to be common sense. However, where the general premise of a syllogism is supposed to be true, making the subsequent deduction necessary, the general premise of an enthymeme is merely probable, which leads only to a tentative conclusion. Originally theorized by Aristotle, there are four types of enthymeme, at least two of which are described in Aristotle&#x27;s work.

Aristotle referred to the enthymeme as &quot;the body of proof&quot;, &quot;the strongest of rhetorical proofs...a kind of syllogism&quot; (&quot;Rhetoric&quot; I, 1.3,11). He considered it to be one of two kinds of proof, the other of which was the paradeigma. Maxims, Aristotle thought, were a derivative of enthymemes. (&quot;Rhetoric&quot; II.XX.1). Aristotle discusses two types of enthymemes: demonstrative [&quot;deiktika&quot;] and refutative [&quot;elentika&quot; or &quot;rézoi&quot; (ῥέζοι)]. (&quot;Rhetoric&quot; II.XXII.14). Demonstrative enthymemes are of the fact that something is or is not the case; they draw a conclusion from what is agreed. Refutative enthymemes draw conclusions that are not agreed to by the opponent. (&quot;Rhetoric&quot; II.XXII.15). According to Aristotle, refutative enthymemes are better liked by audiences because the inconsistencies or opposing arguments are clearer when placed side by side. (&quot;Rhetoric&quot; II.XXIII.30). Enthymemes are derived from probabilities, or what happens for the most part, and signs, which sometimes point to a necessary conclusion and other times are refutable.

== Syllogism with an unstated premise ==
The first type of enthymeme is a truncated syllogism, or a syllogism with an unstated premise.

Here is an example of an enthymeme derived from a syllogism through truncation (shortening) of the syllogism:
*&quot;Socrates is mortal because he&#x27;s human.&quot;

:The complete &quot;formal&quot; syllogism would be the classic:

::All humans are mortal. (major premise – unstated)
::Socrates is human. (minor premise – stated)
::Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion – stated)

While syllogisms lay out all of their premises and conclusion explicitly, these kinds of enthymemes keep at least one of the premises or the conclusion unstated.

== Syllogism based on signs ==

In the &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, Aristotle argues that some enthymemes are derived from syllogisms that are based on signs (&quot;semeia&quot;) instead of absolute facts. In this context, signs are &quot;things [that] are so closely related that the presence or absence of one indicates the presence or absence of the other.&quot; Examples are given below.

*&quot;He is ill, since he has a cough.&quot;
*&quot;Since she has a child, she has given birth.&quot;
*&quot;He is yawning; therefore, he is sleepy.&quot;

In the examples, &#x27;having a cough&#x27;, &#x27;having a child&#x27;, and &#x27;yawning&#x27; are signs of illness, giving birth, and sleepiness, respectively. In those cases, the enthymeme is only probably true because there are other sources of coughs besides pathogens, children besides parturition, and reasons for yawning besides sleepiness, such as allergies, adoption, and fatigue from exercising, respectively.

== Syllogism where the audience supplies a premise ==

The third kind of enthymeme consists of a syllogism with a missing premise that is supplied by the audience as an unstated assumption. In the words of rhetorician William Benoit, the missing premise is: &quot;assumed by rhetor when inventing and by audience when understanding the argument.&quot;

Some examples of this kind of enthymeme are as follows: 
*&quot;&quot;Candide&quot; is a typical French novel; therefore it is irreverent.&quot;
*&quot;Many customers go to Starbucks; therefore, these customers enjoy coffee.&quot;

In the first case, the missing term of the syllogism is &quot;French novels are irreverent&quot; and might be an assumption held by an audience that would make sense of the enthymematic argument. In the second case, the missing term of the syllogism is &quot;Starbucks customers all enjoy coffee&quot; and this might be another assumption held by audiences to make sense of that particular argument. Such unstated premises can also rise to the level of axioms (statements so commonly accepted as to be thought universally true) and logical fallacies.

== Visual enthymemes ==

Another kind of enthymeme is the visual enthymeme. Scholars have argued that words are not the only form of expression that can be understood to form enthymematic arguments. Pictures can also function as enthymemes because they require the audience to help construct their meaning. Modern-day internet memes are a good example of this, their meaning being inherited through the input and adaptations of the collective group of users who come across them, share them, and create them.

== Criticism ==

Some scholars argue that our understanding of the enthymeme has evolved over time and is no longer representative of the enthymeme as originally conceived by Aristotle. This is obviously true of the visual enthymeme, only conceived in the early twenty-first century and may also be true of the enthymeme as truncated syllogism. Carol Poster argues that this later interpretation of the enthymeme was invented by British rhetoricians such as Richard Whately in the eighteenth century.

<text>A naturally aspirated engine, also known as a normally aspirated engine, and abbreviated to N/A or NA, is an internal combustion engine in which air intake depends solely on atmospheric pressure and does not have forced induction through a turbocharger or a supercharger.

== Description ==
In a naturally aspirated engine, air for combustion (Diesel cycle in a diesel engine or specific types of Otto cycle in petrol engines, namely petrol direct injection) or an air/fuel mixture (traditional Otto cycle petrol engines), is drawn into the engine&#x27;s cylinders by atmospheric pressure acting against a partial vacuum that occurs as the piston travels downwards toward bottom dead centre during the intake stroke. Owing to innate restriction in the engine&#x27;s inlet tract, which includes the intake manifold, a small pressure drop occurs as air is drawn in, resulting in a volumetric efficiency of less than 100 percent—and a less than complete air charge in the cylinder. The density of the air charge, and therefore the engine&#x27;s maximum theoretical power output, in addition to being influenced by induction system restriction, is also affected by engine speed and atmospheric pressure, the latter of which decreases as the operating altitude increases.

This is in contrast to a forced-induction engine, in which a mechanically driven supercharger or an exhaust-driven turbocharger is employed to facilitate increasing the mass of intake air beyond what could be produced by atmospheric pressure alone. Nitrous oxide can also be used to artificially increase the mass of oxygen present in the intake air. This is accomplished by injecting liquid nitrous oxide into the intake, which supplies significantly more oxygen in a given volume than is possible with atmospheric air. Nitrous oxide is 36.3% available oxygen by mass after it decomposes as compared with atmospheric air at 20.95%. Nitrous oxide also boils at at atmospheric pressures and offers significant cooling from the latent heat of vaporization, which also aids in increasing the overall air charge density significantly compared to natural aspiration.

== Applications ==
Most automobile petrol engines, as well as many small engines used for non-automotive purposes, are naturally aspirated. Most modern diesel engines powering highway vehicles are turbocharged to produce a more favourable power-to-weight ratio, a higher torque curve, as well as better fuel efficiency and lower exhaust emissions. Turbocharging is nearly universal on diesel engines that are used in railroad, marine engines, and commercial stationary applications (electrical power generation, for example). Forced induction is also used with reciprocating aircraft engines to negate some of the power loss that occurs as the aircraft climbs to higher altitudes.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The advantages and disadvantages of a naturally aspirated engine in relation to a same-sized engine relying on forced induction include:

===Advantages===
* Easier to maintain and repair 
* Lower development and production costs
* Increased reliability, partly due to fewer separate, moving parts
* More direct throttle response than a turbo system due to the lack of turbo lag (an advantage also shared with superchargers)
* Less potential for overheating and or uncontrolled combustion (pinging/ knocking)

===Disadvantages===
* Decreased efficiency 
* Decreased power-to-weight ratio
* Decreased potential for tuning
* Increased power loss at higher elevation (due to lower air pressure) compared to forced induction engines

<doc id="515983" wikidata="Q1438448" url="?curid=515983" title="The Theory of Moral Sentiments">
<text>The Theory of Moral Sentiments is a 1759 book by Adam Smith. It provided the ethical, philosophical, economic, and methodological underpinnings to Smith&#x27;s later works, including &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776), &quot;Essays on Philosophical Subjects&quot; (1795), and &quot;Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms&quot; (1763) (first published in 1896).

== Sympathy ==
Smith departed from the &quot;moral sense&quot; tradition of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, Francis Hutcheson, and David Hume, as the principle of sympathy takes the place of that organ. &quot;Sympathy&quot; was the term Smith used for the feeling of these moral sentiments. It was the feeling of understanding the passions of others. It operated through a logic of mirroring, in which a spectator imaginatively reconstructed the experience of the person he watches:

As we have no immediate experience of what other men feel, we can form no idea of the manner in which they are affected, but by conceiving what we ourselves should feel in the like situation. Though our brother is on the rack, as long as we ourselves are at our ease, our senses will never inform us of what he suffers. They never did, and never can, carry us beyond our own person, and it is by the imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his sensations. Neither can that faculty help us to this any other way, than by representing to us what would be our own, if we were in his case. It is the impressions of our own senses only, not those of his, which our imaginations copy. By the imagination, we place ourselves in his situation...

However, Smith rejected the idea that Man was capable of forming moral judgements beyond a limited sphere of activity, again centered on his own self-interest:

The administration of the great system of the universe ... the care of the universal happiness of all rational and sensible beings, is the business of God and not of man. To man is allotted a much humbler department, but one much more suitable to the weakness of his powers, and to the narrowness of his comprehension: the care of his own happiness, of that of his family, his friends, his country... But though we are ... endowed with a very strong desire of those ends, it has been entrusted to the slow and uncertain determinations of our reason to find out the proper means of bringing them about. Nature has directed us to the greater part of these by original and immediate instincts. Hunger, thirst, the passion which unites the two sexes, and the dread of pain, prompt us to apply those means for their own sakes, and without any consideration of their tendency to those beneficent ends which the great Director of nature intended to produce by them

The rich only select from the heap what is most precious and agreeable. They consume little more than the poor, and in spite of their natural selfishness and rapacity, though they mean only their own conveniency, though the sole end which they propose from the labours of all the thousands whom they employ, be the gratification of their own vain and insatiable desires, they divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements. They are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society, and afford means to the multiplication of the species.

In a published lecture, Vernon L. Smith further argued that &quot;Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; and &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; together encompassed:
&quot;one behavioral axiom, &#x27;the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another,&#x27; where the objects of trade I will interpret to include not only goods, but also gifts, assistance, and favors out of sympathy ... whether it is goods or favors that are exchanged, they bestow gains from trade that humans seek relentlessly in all social transactions. Thus, Adam Smith&#x27;s single axiom, broadly interpreted ... is sufficient to characterize a major portion of the human social and cultural enterprise. It explains why human nature appears to be simultaneously self-regarding and other-regarding.&quot;
==&quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot;: Edition 6==
Consists of 7 parts:
* Part I: Of the propriety of action
* Part II: Of merit and demerit; or of the objects of reward and punishment
* Part III: Of the foundations of our judgments concerning our own sentiments and conduct, and of the sense of duty.
* Part IV: Of the effect of utility upon the sentiments of approbation.
* Part V: Of the influence of custom and fashion upon the sentiments of moral approbation and disapprobation.
* Part VI: Of the character of virtue
* Part VII: Of systems of moral philosophy

===Part I: Of the propriety of action===
Part one of &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; consists of three sections:
* Section 1: Of the sense of propriety
* Section 2: Of the degrees of which different passions are consistent with propriety
* Section 3: Of the effects of prosperity and adversity upon the judgment of mankind with regard to the propriety of action; and why it is more easy to obtain their approbation in the one state than the other

====Part I, Section I: Of the Sense of Propriety====
Section 1 consists of 5 chapters:
* Chapter 1: Of sympathy
* Chapter 2: Of the pleasure of mutual sympathy
* Chapter 3: Of the manner in which we judge of the propriety or impropriety of the affections of other men by their concord or dissonance with our own
* Chapter 4: The same subject continued
* Chapter 5: Of the amiable and respectable virtues

=====Part I, Section I, Chapter I: Of Sympathy=====
According to Smith, people have a natural tendency to care about the well-being of others for no other reason than the pleasure one gets from seeing them happy. He calls this sympathy, defining it &quot;our fellow-feeling with any passion whatsoever&quot; (p. 5). He argues that this occurs under either of two conditions:
* We see firsthand the fortune or misfortune of another person
* The fortune or misfortune is vividly depicted to us

Although, this is apparently true, he follows to argue that this tendency lies even in &quot;the greatest ruffian, the most hardened violator of the laws of society&quot; (p. 2).

Smith also proposes several variables that can moderate the extent of sympathy, noting that the &quot;situation&quot; that is the cause of the passion is a large determinant of our response:
* The vividness of the account of the condition of another person
An important point put forth by Smith is that the degree to which we sympathize, or &quot;tremble and shudder at the thought of what he feels&quot;, is proportional to the degree of vividness in our observation or the description of the event.
* Knowledge of the causes of the emotions
When observing the anger of another person, for example, we are unlikely to sympathize with this person because we &quot;are unacquainted with his provocation&quot; and as a result cannot imagine what it is like to feel what he feels. Further, since we can see the &quot;fear and resentment&quot; of those who are the targets of the person&#x27;s anger we are likely to sympathize and take side with them. Thus, sympathetic responses are often conditional on—or the magnitude for understanding another person is determined by—the causes of the emotion the person is experiencing.
* Whether other people are involved in the emotion
Specifically, emotions such as joy and grief tell us about the &quot;good or bad fortune&quot; of the person we are observing them in, whereas anger tells us about the bad fortune with respect to another person. It is the difference between intrapersonal emotions, such as joy and grief, and interpersonal emotions, such as anger, that causes the difference in sympathy, according to Smith. That is, intrapersonal emotions trigger at least some sympathy without the need for context whereas interpersonal emotions are dependent on context.

He also proposes a natural &#x27;motor&#x27; response to seeing the actions of others: If we see a knife hacking off a person&#x27;s leg we wince away, if we see someone dance we move in the same ways, we feel the injuries of others as if we had them ourselves.

Smith makes clear that we sympathize not only with the misery of others but also the joy; he states that observing an emotional state through the &quot;looks and gestures&quot; in another person is enough to initiate that emotional state in ourselves. Furthermore, we are generally insensitive to the &quot;real&quot; situation of the other person; we are instead sensitive to how we would feel ourselves if we were in the situation of the other person. For example, a mother with a suffering baby feels &quot;the most complete image of misery and distress&quot; while the child merely feels &quot;the uneasiness of the present instant&quot; (p. 8).

=====Part I, Section I, Chapter II: Of Pleasure and mutual sympathy=====
Smith continues by arguing that people feel pleasure from the presence of &quot;others&quot; with the same emotions as one&#x27;s &quot;self&quot;, and displeasure in the presence of those with &quot;contrary&quot; emotions. Smith argues that this pleasure is not the result of self-interest: that others are more likely to assist oneself if they are in a similar emotional state. Smith also makes the case that pleasure from mutual sympathy is not derived merely from a heightening of the original felt emotion amplified by the other person. Smith further notes that people get more pleasure from the mutual sympathy of negative emotions than positive emotions; we feel &quot;more anxious to communicate to our friends&quot; (p. 13) our negative emotions.

Smith proposes that mutual sympathy heightens the original emotion and &quot;disburdens&quot; the person of sorrow. This is a &#x27;relief&#x27; model of mutual sympathy, where mutual sympathy heightens the sorrow but also produces pleasure from relief &quot;because the sweetness of his sympathy more than compensates the bitterness of that sorrow&quot; (p. 14). In contrast, mocking or joking about their sorrow is the &quot;cruelest insult&quot; one can inflict on another person:

To seem to not be affected by the joy of our companions is but want of politeness; but to not wear a serious countentance when they tell us their afflictions, is real and gross inhumanity (p. 14).

He makes clear that mutual sympathy of negative emotions is a necessary condition for friendship, whereas mutual sympathy of positive emotions is desirable but not required. This is due to the &quot;healing consolation of mutual sympathy&quot; that a friend is &#x27;required&#x27; to provide in response to &quot;grief and resentment&quot;, as if not doing so would be akin to a failure to help the physically &quot;wounded&quot;.

Not only do we get pleasure from the sympathy of others, but we also obtain pleasure from being able to successfully sympathize with others, and discomfort from failing to do so. Sympathizing is pleasurable, failing to sympathize is aversive. Smith also makes the case that failing to sympathize with another person may not be aversive to ourselves but we may find the emotion of the other person unfounded and blame them, as when another person experiences great happiness or sadness in response to an event that we think should not warrant such a response.

=====Part I, Section I, Chapter III: Of the manner in which we judge of the propriety or impropriety of the affections of other men by their concord or dissonance with our own=====
Smith presents the argument that approval or disapproval of the feelings of others is completely determined by whether we sympathize or fail to sympathize with their emotions. Specifically, if we sympathize with the feelings of another we judge that their feelings are just, and if we do not sympathize we judge that their feelings are unjust.

This holds in matters of opinion also, as Smith flatly states that we judge the opinions of others as correct or incorrect merely by determining whether they agree with our own opinions. Smith also cites a few examples where our judgment is not in line with our emotions and sympathy, as when we judge the sorrow of a stranger who has lost her mother as being justified even though we know nothing about the stranger and do not sympathize ourselves. However, according to Smith these non-emotional judgments are not independent from sympathy in that although we do not feel sympathy we do recognize that sympathy would be appropriate and lead us to this judgment and thus deem the judgment as correct.

&quot;Utopian&quot; or Ideal Political Systems: &quot;The man of system . . . is apt to be very wise in his own conceit; and is often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it.
He goes on to establish it completely and in all its parts, without any regard either to the great interests, or to the strong prejudices which may oppose it.
He seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess-board.
He does not consider that the pieces upon the chess-board have no other principle of motion besides that which the hand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might choose to impress upon it.
If those two principles coincide and act in the same direction, the game of human society will go on easily and harmoniously, and is very likely to be happy and successful.
If they are opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the society must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder.&quot;

— Adam Smith, &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot;, 1759

Next, Smith puts forth that not only are the consequences of one&#x27;s actions judged and used to determine whether one is just or unjust in committing them, but also whether one&#x27;s sentiments justified the action that brought about the consequences. Thus, sympathy plays a role in determining judgments of the actions of others in that if we sympathize with the affections that brought about the action we are more likely to judge the action as just, and vice versa:
If upon bringing the case home to our own breast we find that the sentiments which it gives occasion to, coincide and tally with our own, we necessarily approve of them as proportioned and suitable to their objects; if otherwise, we necessarily disapprove of them, as extravagant and out of proportion (p. 20).
=====Part I, Section I, Chapter IV: The same subject continued=====
Smith delineates two conditions under which we judge the &quot;propriety or impropriety of the sentiments of another person&quot;:
* 1 When the objects of the sentiments are considered alone
* 2 When the objects of the sentiments are considered in relation to the person or other persons

When one&#x27;s sentiments coincide with another person&#x27;s when the object is considered alone, then we judge that their sentiment is justified. Smith lists objects that are in one of two domains: science and taste. Smith argues that sympathy does not play a role in judgments of these objects; differences in judgment arise only due to difference in attention or mental acuity between people. When the judgment of another person agrees with us on these types of objects it is not notable; however, when another person&#x27;s judgment differs from us, we assume that they have some special ability to discern characteristics of the object we have not already noticed, and thus view their judgment with special approbation called &quot;admiration&quot;.

Smith continues by noting that we assign value to judgments not based on usefulness (utility) but on similarity to our own judgment, and we attribute to those judgments which are in line with our own the qualities of correctness or truth in science, and justness or delicateness in taste. Thus, the utility of a judgment is &quot;plainly an afterthought&quot; and &quot;not what first recommends them to our approbation&quot; (p. 24).

Of objects that fall into the second category, such as the misfortune of oneself or another person, Smith argues that there is no common starting point for judgment but are vastly more important in maintaining social relations. Judgments of the first kind are irrelevant as long as one is able to share a sympathetic sentiment with another person; people may converse in total disagreement about objects of the first kind as long as each person appreciates the sentiments of the other to a reasonable degree. However, people become intolerable to each other when they have no feeling or sympathy for the misfortunes or resentment of the other: &quot;You are confounded at my violence and passion, and I am enraged at your cold insensibility and want of feelings&quot; (p. 26).

Another important point Smith makes is that our sympathy will never reach the degree or &quot;violence&quot; of the person who experiences it, as our own &quot;safety&quot; and comfort as well as separation from the offending object constantly &quot;intrude&quot; on our efforts to induce a sympathetic state in ourselves. Thus, sympathy is never enough, as the &quot;sole consolation&quot; for the sufferer is &quot;to see the emotions of their hearts, in every respect, beat time to his own, in the violent and disagreeable passions&quot; (p. 28). Therefore, the original sufferer is likely to dampen his feelings to be in &quot;concord&quot; with the degree of sentiment expressible by the other person, who feels only due to the ability of one&#x27;s imagination. It is this which is &quot;sufficient for the harmony of society&quot; (p. 28). Not only does the person dampen his expression of suffering for the purpose of sympathizing, but he also takes the perspective of the other person who is not suffering, thus slowly changing his perspective and allowing the calmness of the other person and reduction of violence of the sentiment to improve his spirits.

As a friend is likely to engage in more sympathy than a stranger, a friend actually slows the reduction in our sorrows because we do not temper our feelings out of sympathizing with the perspective of the friend to the degree that we reduce our sentiments in the presence of acquaintances, or a group of acquaintances. This gradual tempering of our sorrows from the repeated perspective-taking of someone in a more calm state make &quot;society and conversation...the most powerful remedies for restoring the mind to its tranquility&quot; (p. 29).

=====Part I, Section I, Chapter V: Of the amiable and respectable virtues=====
Smith starts to use an important new distinction in this section and late in the previous section:
* The &quot;person principally concerned&quot;: The person who has had emotions aroused by an object
* The spectator: The person observing and sympathizing with the emotionally aroused &quot;person principally concerned&quot;

These two people have two different sets of virtues. The person principally concerned, in &quot;bring[ing] down emotions to what the spectator can go along with&quot; (p. 30), demonstrates &quot;self-denial&quot; and &quot;self-government&quot; whereas the spectator displays &quot;the candid condescension and indulgent humanity&quot; of &quot;enter[ing]into the sentiments of the person principally concerned.&quot;

Smith returns to anger and how we find &quot;detestable...the insolence and brutality&quot; of the person principally concerned but &quot;admire...the indignation which they naturally call forth in that of the impartial spectator&quot; (p. 32). Smith concludes that the &quot;perfection&quot; of human nature is this mutual sympathy, or &quot;love our neighbor as we love ourself&quot; by &quot;feeling much for others and little for ourself&quot; and to indulge in &quot;benevolent affections&quot; (p. 32). Smith makes clear that it is this ability to &quot;self-command&quot; our &quot;ungovernable passions&quot; through sympathizing with others that is virtuous.

Smith further distinguishes between virtue and propriety:

====Part I, Section II: Of the degrees of which different passions are consistent with propriety====
Section 2 consists of 5 chapters:
* Chapter 1: Of the passions which take their origins from the body
* Chapter 2: Of the passions which take their origins from a particular turn or habit of the imagination
* Chapter 3: Of the unsocial passions
* Chapter 4: Of the social passions
* Chapter 5: Of the selfish passions

Smith starts off by noting that the spectator can sympathize only with passions of medium &quot;pitch&quot;. However, this medium level at which the spectator can sympathize depends on what &quot;passion&quot; or emotion is being expressed; with some emotions even the most justified expression of cannot be tolerated at a high level of fervor, at others sympathy in the spectator is not bounded by magnitude of expression even though the emotion is not as well justified. Again, Smith emphasizes that specific passions will be considered appropriate or inappropriate to varying degrees depending on the degree to which the spectator is able to sympathize, and that it is the purpose of this section to specify which passions evoke sympathy and which do not and therefore which are deemed appropriate and not appropriate.

=====Part I, Section II, Chapter I: Of the passions which take their origins from the body=====
Since it is not possible to sympathize with bodily states or &quot;appetites which take their origin in the body&quot; it is improper to display them to others, according to Smith. One example is &quot;eating voraciously&quot; when hungry, as the impartial spectator can sympathize a little bit if there is a vivid description and good cause for this hunger, but not to a great extent as hunger itself cannot be induced from mere description. Smith also includes sex as a passion of the body that is considered indecent in the expression of others, although he does make note that to fail to treat a woman with more &quot;gaiety, pleasantry, and attention&quot; would also be improper of a man (p. 39). To express pain is also considered unbecoming.

Smith believes the cause of lack of sympathy for these bodily passions is that &quot;we cannot enter into them&quot; ourselves (p. 40). Temperance, by Smith&#x27;s account, is to have control over bodily passions.

On the contrary, passions of the imagination, such as loss of love or ambition, are easy to sympathize with because our imagination can conform to the shape of the sufferer, whereas our body cannot do such a thing to the body of the sufferer. Pain is fleeting and the harm only lasts as long as the violence is inflicted, whereas an insult lasts to harm for longer duration because our &quot;imagination&quot; keeps mulling it over. Likewise, bodily pain that induces fear, such as a cut, wound or fracture, evoke sympathy because of the danger that they imply for ourselves; that is, sympathy is activated chiefly through &quot;imagining&quot; what it would be like for us.

=====Part I, Section II, Chapter II: Of the passions which take their origins from a particular turn or habit of the imagination=====
Passions which &quot;take their origins from a particular turn or habit of the imagination&quot; are &quot;little sympathized with&quot;. These include love, as we are unlikely to enter into our own feeling of love in response to that of another person and thus unlikely to sympathize. He further states that love is &quot;always laughed at, because we cannot enter into it&quot; ourselves.

Instead of inspiring love in ourselves, and thus sympathy, love makes the impartial spectator sensitive to the situation and emotions that may arise from the gain or loss of love. Again this is because it is easy to imagine &quot;hoping&quot; for love or &quot;dreading&quot; loss of love but not the actual experience of it, and that the &quot;happy passion, upon this account, interests us much less than the fearful and the melancholy&quot; of losing happiness (p. 49). Thus, love inspires sympathy for not for love itself but for the anticipation of emotions from gaining or losing it.

Smith, however, finds love &quot;ridiculous&quot; but &quot;not naturally odious&quot; (p. 50). Thus, we sympathize with the &quot;humaneness, generosity, kindness, friendship, and esteem&quot; (p. 50) of love. However, as these secondary emotions are excessive in love, one should not express them but in moderate tones according to Smith, as:

All these are objects which we cannot expect should interest our companions in the same degree in which they interest us.

Failing to do so makes bad company, and therefore those with specific interests and &quot;love&quot; of hobbies should keep their passions to those with kindred spirits (&quot;A philosopher is company to a philosopher only&quot; (p. 51)) or to themselves.

=====Part I, Section II, Chapter III: Of the unsocial passions=====
Smith talks of hatred and resentment next, as &quot;unsocial passions.&quot; According to Smith these are passions of imagination, but sympathy is only likely to be evoked in the impartial spectator when they are expressed in moderate tones. Because these passions regard two people, namely the offended (resentful or angry person) and the offender, our sympathies are naturally drawn between these two. Specifically, although we sympathize with the offended person, we fear that the offended person may do harm to the offender, and thus also fear for and sympathize with the danger that faces the offender.

The impartial spectator sympathizes with the offended person in a manner, as emphasized previously, such that the greatest sympathy occurs when the offended person expresses anger or resentment in a temperate manner. Specifically, if the offended person seems just and temperate in coping with the offense, then this magnifies the misdeed done to the offended in the mind of the spectator, increasing sympathy. Although excess anger does not beget sympathy, neither does too little anger, as this may signal fear or uncaring on the part of the offended. This lack of response is just as despicable to the impartial spectator as is the excesses of anger.

However, in general, any expression of anger is improper in the presence of others. This is because the &quot;immediate effects [of anger] are disagreeable&quot; just as the knives of surgery are disagreeable for art, as the immediate effect of surgery is unpleasant even though long-term effect is justified. Likewise, even when anger is justly provoked, it is disagreeable. According to Smith, this explains why we reserve sympathy until we know the cause of the anger or resentment, since, if the emotion is not justified by the action of another person, then the immediate disagreeableness and threat to the other person (and by sympathy to ourselves) overwhelm any sympathy that the spectator may have for the offended. In response to expressions of anger, hatred, or resentment, it is likely that the impartial spectator will not feel anger in sympathy with the offended but instead anger &quot;toward&quot; the offended for expressing such an aversive. Smith believes that there is some form of natural optimality to the aversiveness of these emotions, as it reduces the propagation of ill will among people, and thus increases the probability of functional societies.

Smith also puts forth that anger, hatred, and resentment are disagreeable to the offended mostly because of the idea of being offended rather than the actual offense itself. He remarks that we are likely able to do without what was taken from us, but it is the imagination which angers us at the thought of having something taken. Smith closes this section by remarking that the impartial spectator will not sympathize with us unless we are willing to endure harms, with the goal of maintaining positive social relations and humanity, with equanimity, as long as it does not put us in a situation of being &quot;exposed to perpetual insults&quot; (p. 59). It is only &quot;with reluctance, from necessity, and in consequence of great and repeated provocations&quot; (p. 60) that we should take revenge on others. Smith makes clear that we should take very good care to not act on the passions of anger, hatred, resentment, for purely social reasons, and instead imagine what the impartial spectator would deem appropriate, and base our action &quot;solely&quot; on a cold calculation.

=====Part I, Section II, Chapter IV: Of the social passions=====
The social emotions such as &quot;generosity, humanity, kindness, compassion, mutual friendship and esteem&quot; are considered overwhelmingly with approbation by the impartial spectator. The agreeableness of the &quot;benevolent&quot; sentiments leads to full sympathy on the part of the spectator with both the person concerned and the object of these emotions and are not felt as aversive to the spectator if they are in excess.

=====Part I, Section II, Chapter V: Of the selfish passions=====
The final set of passions, or &quot;selfish passions&quot;, are grief and joy, which Smith considers to be not so aversive as the unsocial passions of anger and resentment, but not so benevolent as the social passions such as generosity and humanity. Smith makes clear in this passage that the impartial spectator is unsympathetic to the unsocial emotions because they put the offended and the offender in opposition to each other, sympathetic to the social emotions because they join the lover and beloved in unison, and feels somewhere in between with the selfish passions as they are either good or bad for only one person and are not disagreeable but not so magnificent as the social emotions.

Of grief and joy, Smith notes that small joys and great grief are assured to be returned with sympathy from the impartial spectator, but not other degrees of these emotions. Great joy is likely to be met with envy, so modesty is prudent for someone who has come upon great fortune or else suffer the consequences of envy and disapprobation. This is appropriate as the spectator appreciates the lucky individual&#x27;s &quot;sympathy with our envy and aversion to his happiness&quot; especially because this shows concern for the inability of the spectator to reciprocate the sympathy toward the happiness of the lucky individual. According to Smith, this modesty wears on the sympathy of both the lucky individual and the old friends of the lucky individual and they soon part ways; likewise, the lucky individual may acquire new friends of higher rank to whom he must also be modest, apologizing for the &quot;mortification&quot; of now being their equal:

He generally grows weary too soon, and is provoked, by the sullen and suspicious pride of the one, and by the saucy contempt of the other, to treat the first with neglect, and the second with petulance, till at last he grows habitually insolent, and forfeits the esteem of them all... those sudden changes of fortune seldom contribute much to happiness (p. 66).

The solution is to ascend social rank by gradual steps, with the path cleared for one by approbation &quot;before&quot; one takes the next step, giving people time to adjust, and thus avoiding any &quot;jealousy in those he overtakes, or any envy in those he leaves behind&quot; (p. 66).

Small joys of everyday life are met with sympathy and approbation according to Smith. These &quot;frivolous nothings which fill up the void of human life&quot; (p. 67) divert attention and help us forget problems, reconciling us as with a lost friend.

The opposite is true for grief, with small grief triggering no sympathy in the impartial spectator, but large grief with much sympathy. Small griefs are likely, and appropriately, turned into joke and mockery by the sufferer, as the sufferer knows how complaining about small grievances to the impartial spectator will evoke ridicule in the heart of the spectator, and thus the sufferer sympathizes with this, mocking himself to some degree.

====Part I, Section III: Of the effects of prosperity and adversity upon the judgment of mankind with regard to the propriety of action; and why it is more easy to obtain their approbation in the one state than in the other====
Section 3 consists of 3 chapters:
* Chapter 1: That though our Sympathy with Sorrow is generally a more lively Sensation than our Sympathy with Joy, it commonly falls much more short of the Violence of what is naturally felt by the Person principally concerned
* Chapter 2: Of the Origin of Ambition, and of the Distinction of Ranks
* Chapter 3: Of the Corruption of our Moral Sentiments, which is occasioned by this Disposition to admire the Rich and the Great, and to despise or neglect Persons of poor and mean Condition

===== Part I, Section III, Chapter I: That though our Sympathy with Sorrow is generally a more lively Sensation than our Sympathy with Joy, it commonly falls much more short of the Violence of what is naturally felt by the Person principally concerned =====

===== Part I, Section III, Chapter II: Of the Origin of Ambition, and of the Distinction of Ranks =====
The rich man glories in his riches, because he feels that they naturally draw upon him the attention of the world, and that mankind are disposed to go along with him in all those agreeable emotions with which the advantages of his situation so readily inspire him. At the thought of this, his heart seems to swell and dilate itself within him, and he is fonder of his wealth, upon this account, than for all the other advantages it procures him. The poor man, on the contrary, is ashamed of his poverty. He feels that it either places him out of the sight of mankind, or, that if they take any notice of him, they have, however, scarce any fellow-feeling with the misery and distress which he suffers.
Great King, live for ever! is the compliment, which, after the manner of eastern adulation, we should readily make them, if experience did not teach us its absurdity. Every calamity that befalls them, every injury that is done them, excites in the breast of the spectator ten times more compassion and resentment than he would have felt, had the same things happened to other men. A stranger to human nature, who saw the indifference of men about the misery of their inferiors, and the regret and indignation which they feel for the misfortunes and sufferings of those above them, would be apt to imagine, that pain must be more agonizing, and the convulsions of death more terrible to persons of higher rank, than to those of meaner stations.

Upon this disposition of mankind, to go along with all the passions of the rich and the powerful, is founded the distinction of ranks, and the order of society. Even when the people have been brought this length, they are apt to relent every moment, and easily relapse into their habitual state of deference to those whom they have been accustomed to look upon as their natural superiors. They cannot stand the mortification of their monarch. Compassion soon takes the place of resentment, they forget all past provocations, their old principles of loyalty revive, and they run to re-establish the ruined authority of their old masters, with the same violence with which they had opposed it. The death of Charles I brought about the Restoration of the royal family. Compassion for James II when he was seized by the populace in making his escape on ship-board, had almost prevented the Revolution, and made it go on more heavily than before.

===== Part I, Section III, Chapter III: Of the Corruption of our Moral Sentiments, which is occasioned by this Disposition to admire the Rich and the Great, and to despise or neglect Persons of poor and mean Condition =====
This disposition to admire, and almost to worship, the rich and the powerful, and to despise, or, at least, to neglect persons of poor and mean condition, though necessary both to establish and to maintain the distinction of ranks and the order of society, is, at the same time, the great and most universal cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments. That wealth and greatness are often regarded with the respect and admiration which are due only to wisdom and virtue; and that the contempt, of which vice and folly are the only proper objects, is often most unjustly bestowed upon poverty and weakness, has been the complaint of moralists in all ages.
We desire both to be respectable and to be respected. We dread both to be contemptible and to be contemned. But, upon coming into the world, we soon find that wisdom and virtue are by no means the sole objects of respect; nor vice and folly, of contempt. We frequently see the respectful attentions of the world more strongly directed towards the rich and the great, than towards the wise and the virtuous. We see frequently the vices and follies of the powerful much less despised than the poverty and weakness of the innocent. To deserve, to acquire, and to enjoy the respect and admiration of mankind, are the great objects of ambition and emulation. Two different roads are presented to us, equally leading to the attainment of this so much desired object; the one, by the study of wisdom and the practice of virtue; the other, by the acquisition of wealth and greatness. Two different characters are presented to our emulation; the one, of proud ambition and ostentatious avidity. the other, of humble modesty and equitable justice. Two different models, two different pictures, are held out to us, according to which we may fashion our own character and behaviour; the one more gaudy and glittering in its colouring; the other more correct and more exquisitely beautiful in its outline: the one forcing itself upon the notice of every wandering eye; the other, attracting the attention of scarce any body but the most studious and careful observer. They are the wise and the virtuous chiefly, a select, though, I am afraid, but a small party, who are the real and steady admirers of wisdom and virtue. The great mob of mankind are the admirers and worshippers, and, what may seem more extraordinary, most frequently the disinterested admirers and worshippers, of wealth and greatness.
n the superior stations of life the case is unhappily not always the same. In the courts of princes, in the drawing-rooms of the great, where success and preferment depend, not upon the esteem of intelligent and well-informed equals, but upon the fanciful and foolish favour of ignorant, presumptuous, and proud superiors; flattery and falsehood too often prevail over merit and abilities. In such societies the abilities to please, are more regarded than the abilities to serve. In quiet and peaceable times, when the storm is at a distance, the prince, or great man, wishes only to be amused, and is even apt to fancy that he has scarce any occasion for the service of any body, or that those who amuse him are sufficiently able to serve him. The external graces, the frivolous accomplishments of that impertinent and foolish thing called a man of fashion, are commonly more admired than the solid and masculine virtues of a warrior, a statesman, a philosopher, or a legislator. All the great and awful virtues, all the virtues which can fit, either for the council, the senate, or the field, are, by the insolent and insignificant flatterers, who commonly figure the most in such corrupted societies, held in the utmost contempt and derision. When the duke of Sully was called upon by Lewis the Thirteenth, to give his advice in some great emergency, he observed the favourites and courtiers whispering to one another, and smiling at his unfashionable appearance. &#x27;Whenever your majesty&#x27;s father,&#x27; said the old warrior and statesman, &#x27;did me the honour to consult me, he ordered the buffoons of the court to retire into the antechamber.&#x27;

It is from our disposition to admire, and consequently to imitate, the rich and the great, that they are enabled to set, or to lead what is called the fashion. Their dress is the fashionable dress; the language of their conversation, the fashionable style; their air and deportment, the fashionable behaviour. Even their vices and follies are fashionable; and the greater part of men are proud to imitate and resemble them in the very qualities which dishonour and degrade them. Vain men often give themselves airs of a fashionable profligacy, which, in their hearts, they do not approve of, and of which, perhaps, they are really not guilty. They desire to be praised for what they themselves do not think praise-worthy, and are ashamed of unfashionable virtues which they sometimes practise in secret, and for which they have secretly some degree of real veneration. There are hypocrites of wealth and greatness, as well as of religion and virtue; and a vain man is as apt to pretend to be what he is not, in the one way, as a cunning man is in the other. He assumes the equipage and splendid way of living of his superiors, without considering that whatever may be praise-worthy in any of these, derives its whole merit and propriety from its suitableness to that situation and fortune which both require and can easily support the expence. Many a poor man places his glory in being thought rich, without considering that the duties (if one may call such follies by so very venerable a name) which that reputation imposes upon him, must soon reduce him to beggary, and render his situation still more unlike that of those whom he admires and imitates, than it had been originally.

===Part V, Chapter I: Of the influence of Custom and Fashion upon the Sentiments of Approbation and Disapprobation===
Smith argues that two principles, custom and fashion, pervasively influence judgment. These are based on the modern psychological concept of associativity: Stimuli presented closely in time or space become mentally linked over time and repeated exposure. In Smith&#x27;s own words:

When two objects have frequently been seen together, the imagination requires a habit of passing easily from one to the other. If the first is to appear, we lay our account that the second is to follow. Of their own accord they put us in mind of one another, and the attention glides easily along them. (p. 1)

Regarding custom, Smith argues that approbation occurs when stimuli are presented according to how one is accustomed to viewing them and disapprobation occurs when they are presented in a way that one is not accustomed to. Thus, Smith argues for social relativity of judgment meaning that beauty and correctness are determined more by what one has previously been exposed to rather than an absolute principle. Although Smith places greater weight on this social determination he does not discount absolute principles completely, instead he argues that evaluations are rarely inconsistent with custom, therefore giving greater weight to customs than absolutes:

I cannot, however, be induced to believe that our sense of external beauty is founded altogether on custom...But though I cannot admit that custom is the sole principle of beauty, yet I can so far allow the truth of this ingenious system as to grant, that there is scarce any one external form to please, if quite contrary to custom...(pp. 14–15).
Smith continues by arguing that fashion is a particular &quot;species&quot; of custom. Fashion is specifically the association of stimuli with people of high rank, for example, a certain type of clothes with a notable person such as a king or a renowned artist. This is because the &quot;graceful, easy, and commanding manners of the great&quot; (p. 3) person are frequently associated with the other aspects of the person of high rank (e.g., clothes, manners), thus bestowing upon the other aspects the &quot;graceful&quot; quality of the person. In this way objects become fashionable. Smith includes not only clothes and furniture in the sphere of fashion, but also taste, music, poetry, architecture, and physical beauty.

Smith also points out that people should be relatively reluctant to change styles from what they are accustomed to even if a new style is equal to or slightly better than current fashion: &quot;A man would be ridiculous who should appear in public with a suit of clothes quite different from those which are commonly worn, though the new dress be ever so graceful or convenient&quot; (p. 7).

Physical beauty, according to Smith, is also determined by the principle of custom. He argues that each &quot;class&quot; of things has a &quot;peculiar conformation which is approved of&quot; and that the beauty of each member of a class is determined by the extent to which it has the most &quot;usual&quot; manifestation of that &quot;conformation&quot;:

Thus, in the human form, the beauty of each feature lies in a certain middle, equally removed from a variety of other forms that are ugly. (pp. 10–11).
===Part V, Chapter II: Of the influence of Custom and Fashion upon Moral Sentiments===
Smith argues that the influence of custom is reduced in the sphere of moral judgment. Specifically, he argues that there are &quot;bad&quot; things that no custom can bring approbation to:

But the characters and conduct of a Nero, or a Claudius, are what no custom will ever reconcile us to, what no fashion will ever render agreeable; but the one will always be the object of dread and hatred; the other of scorn and derision. (pp. 15–16).

Smith further argues for a &quot;natural&quot; right and wrong, and that custom amplifies the moral sentiments when one&#x27;s customs are consistent with nature, but dampens moral sentiments when one&#x27;s customs are inconsistent with nature.

Fashion also has an effect on moral sentiment. The vices of people of high rank, such as the licentiousness of Charles VIII, are associated with the &quot;freedom and independency, with frankness, generosity, humanity, and politeness&quot; of the &quot;superiors&quot; and thus the vices are endued with these characteristics.

<text>Admiral Sir David Murray Anderson, (11 April 1874 – 30 October 1936) was a British naval officer and governor. Anderson served in the Royal Navy from the age of 13 and served in many colonial wars and was given various Empire postings, rising to the rank of admiral in 1931. He retired a year later and took up the posting as Governor of Newfoundland, where he also took up the role of Chairman of the Government following the suspension of self-government in the Dominion of Newfoundland. Leaving Newfoundland in 1935, he was appointed as Governor of New South Wales but served only briefly due to his ill health. He died while in office aged 62.

==Early life and career==
Anderson was born on 11 April 1874, the second son of General David Anderson, Colonel of the Cheshire Regiment, and his wife Charlotte Christina, née Anderson in Newton-by-Chester in Cheshire, England. His elder brother was Lieutenant General Sir Warren Hastings Anderson. In 1887, as a 13-year-old, he became a naval cadet in the training ship &quot;Britannia&quot; at Dartmouth. Seeing action against King Koko slave traders on the Niger River, he became a lieutenant on 23 February 1895 at age 20. Anderson saw further action against West-African rebels and in the Ashanti Campaign. In May 1902, he was posted as first and gunnery lieutenant to the cruiser on the Channel Squadron.

In 1905 Anderson was promoted to commander and was posted to the Royal Yacht &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot; in 1908. That year, he married a New Zealander, Edith Teschemaker. On 29 July 1910 Anderson was appointed a Member of the Fourth Class of the Royal Victorian Order. On 11 August 1911, he was promoted to captain and posted as Flag Captain on from 1913 to 1917.

When the First World War broke out Anderson took part in the operations that resulted in the destruction of the in German East Africa, and was mentioned in despatches in 1915. For his actions leading to the capture of Dar es Salaam he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1918. He was also invested by the Sultan of Zanzibar with the Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar, Second Class. From 1918 to 1919 Anderson was posted to command the battleship in the Grand Fleet. In May 1921 he was appointed as an aide-de-camp (ADC) to King George V, which he held until April 1922. After a posting in England, he was promoted to rear admiral in 1922. On 2 June 1923 he was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He was later posted from August 1923 to October 1925 as the Senior Naval Officer, Yangtze, and briefly served as temporary Commander-in-Chief China Station in 1925. While in China, he was called upon on three separate occasions to command a multi-national force of Japanese, British, American, Portuguese and Italian sailors to help protect the Shanghai International Settlement. For his efforts in China, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Third Class, by Emperor Hirohito of Japan.

Further promoted to vice admiral in 1927, Anderson was appointed to command the Africa Station. From June to September 1928 he served as High Commissioner to the Union of South Africa. Being fluent in French, he was further appointed to Geneva as the Admiralty representative to the League of Nations permanent advisory commission from 1929 to 1931. On 3 June 1930 he was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and was promoted to admiral in 1931. He retired at his own request on 5 July 1932.

==Governor of Newfoundland==
Anderson was then appointed on 20 October 1932 as the Governor of Newfoundland. He became His Majesty&#x27;s Representative at a time of great instability in the Dominion of Newfoundland. Newfoundland had been hit badly by the Great Depression, leaving most of the banks on the verge of insolvency, saved only by emergency loans from Britain, the state Treasury was empty and the political process was discredited by corruption and incompetence.

The Government, led by Prime Minister Frederick C. Alderdice, called upon the British government to take direct control until Newfoundland could become self-sustaining. The United Kingdom, concerned over Newfoundland&#x27;s likelihood of defaulting on its loans, asked the government to establish the Newfoundland Royal Commission, headed by a Scottish peer, Lord Amulree. Its report, released in 1933, assessed Newfoundland&#x27;s political system as institutionally corrupt and its economic future as bleak, recommending the abolition of responsible government, and its replacement by a Commission of the British Government. Acting on the report&#x27;s recommendations, Alderdice&#x27;s government voted itself out of existence in December 1933. Appointed as chair of the Commission of Government in 1934, Anderson found his role as Governor with significantly expanded powers and proved himself up to the job, constantly sending reports back to the Dominions Office and giving advice to the Dominions Secretary on how to deal with the Commission members.

Despite his new-found powers, Anderson took the position of neutral mediator, intervening only when there was a dispute in the commission. He was nevertheless involved with restructuring the administration of the state, including government departments, social services, the health system and the postal system. His approach proved to be not enough to bring the Commission out of petty arguments and disputes and in October 1935 it was announced that he would be replaced by another Naval officer, Sir Humphrey Walwyn. Anderson and his wife departed from Newfoundland the following January.

==Governor of New South Wales==

In November 1935 it was announced that Anderson was to become the Governor of New South Wales, a relatively quieter post. He was invested by King Edward VIII as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 5 May 1936, and as a Knight of Grace of the Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem on 23 June 1936.

&quot;En route&quot; to Australia Anderson was taken ill, and had to spend six weeks in hospital in Perth, Western Australia. He was sworn in at Sydney on 6 August 1936. Because of his recurring illness, Lady Anderson undertook many official duties on his behalf, while the Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales, Sir Philip Street, carried out his legislative and ceremonial duties. On 29 October he collapsed and died of a cerebral haemorrhage early in the morning the next day at Government House. His body was laid in state in St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney and was shipped back to England for burial.

Lady Edith Muriel Anderson was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) on 11 May 1937 for public service in New South Wales.

<doc id="515986" wikidata="Q964668" url="?curid=515986" title="Joseph Klausner">
<text>Joseph Gedaliah Klausner (; 20 August 1874 – 27 October 1958), was a Lithuanian-born Israeli historian and professor of Hebrew literature. He was the chief redactor of the &quot;Encyclopedia Hebraica&quot;. He was a candidate for president in the first Israeli presidential election in 1949, losing to Chaim Weizmann. Klausner was the great uncle of Israeli author Amos Oz.

== Biography==
Joseph Klausner was born in Olkeniki, Vilna Governorate in 1874. At the turn of the 20th century, the Klausners left Lithuania and settled in Odessa. Klausner was active in the city&#x27;s scientific, literary and Zionist circles. He was a committed Zionist who knew Theodor Herzl personally and attended the First Zionist Congress.

In 1912, Klausner visited Palestine for the first time, and settled there in 1919. In 1925, he became a professor of Hebrew literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He specialized in the history of the Second Temple period. Although not an Orthodox Jew, he observed Sabbath and the dietary laws. He had a wide grasp of the Talmud and Midrashic literature.

Joseph Klausner was a member of the circle of Russian Zionist political activists from Odessa, which included Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky and Menachem Ussishkin. Although not a &#x27;party man,&#x27; he supported Revisionist Zionism. In 1919 he helped organize the Ruslan, a ship carrying Jewish refugees and immigrants to Jaffa from Odessa. In July 1929, Klausner established the Pro-Wailing Wall Committee to defend Jewish rights, and resolve problems over access and arrangements for worship at the Western Wall. His house in Talpiot neighborhood of Jerusalem was destroyed in the 1929 Palestine riots.

Despite his Zionist ideology, Klausner had numerous disagreements with Chaim Weizmann. The two were candidates in the presidential election of 1949; Weizmann was declared the first President of Israel.

== Academic career==
Klausner earned his PhD in Germany. One of his most influential books was about Jesus. The book &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, and its sequel, &quot;From Jesus to Paul&quot;, gained him fame. In it, Klausner described how Jesus was best understood as a Jew and Israelite who was trying to reform the religion, and died as a devout Jew. Herbert Danby, an Anglican priest, translated the work from Hebrew into English so that English scholars might avail themselves of the information. A number of clergymen, incensed at Danby for translating the book, demanded his recall from Jerusalem. Later in his career, he was given a chair in Jewish history.

Amos Oz described his childhood visits to Klausner&#x27;s house in Talpiot and his impression of Klausner&#x27;s erudition in his memoir, &quot;A Tale of Love and Darkness&quot;.

== Awards and recognition==

In both 1941 and 1949, Klausner was awarded the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought.
In 1958, he was awarded the Israel Prize in Jewish studies.
In 1982, in recognition of his scholarly achievements, the State of Israel issued a stamp with his picture on it.

<text>In computer programming, a program exhibits undefined behavior (UB) when it contains, or is executing code for which its programming language specification does not mandate any specific requirements. This is different from unspecified behavior, for which the language specification does not prescribe a result, and implementation-defined behavior that defers to the documentation of another component of the platform (such as the ABI or the translator documentation).

In the C programming community, undefined behavior may be humorously referred to as &quot;nasal demons&quot;, after a comp.std.c post that explained undefined behavior as allowing the compiler to do anything it chooses, even &quot;to make demons fly out of your nose&quot;.

== Overview ==
Some programming languages allow a program to operate differently or even have a different control flow from the source code, as long as it exhibits the same user-visible side effects, &quot;if undefined behavior never happens during program execution&quot;. Undefined behavior is the name of a list of conditions that the program must not meet.

In the early versions of C, undefined behavior&#x27;s primary advantage was the production of performant compilers for a wide variety of machines: a specific construct could be mapped to a machine-specific feature, and the compiler did not have to generate additional code for the runtime to adapt the side effects to match semantics imposed by the language. The program source code was written with prior knowledge of the specific compiler and of the platforms that it would support.

However, progressive standardization of the platforms has made this less of an advantage, especially in newer versions of C. Now, the cases for undefined behavior typically represent unambiguous bugs in the code, for example indexing an array outside of its bounds. By definition, the runtime can assume that undefined behavior never happens; therefore, some invalid conditions do not need to be checked against. For a compiler, this also means that various program transformations become valid, or their proofs of correctness are simplified; this allows for various kinds of optimizations whose correctness depend on the assumption that the program state never meets any such condition. The compiler can also remove explicit checks that may have been in the source code, without notifying the programmer; for example, detecting undefined behavior by testing whether it happened is not guaranteed to work, by definition. This makes it hard or impossible to program a portable fail-safe option (non-portable solutions are possible for some constructs).

Current compiler development usually evaluates and compares compiler performance with benchmarks designed around micro-optimizations, even on platforms that are mostly used on the general-purpose desktop and laptop market (such as amd64). Therefore, undefined behavior provides ample room for compiler performance improvement, as the source code for a specific source code statement is allowed to be mapped to anything at runtime.

For C and C++, the compiler is allowed to give a compile-time diagnostic in these cases, but is not required to: the implementation will be considered correct whatever it does in such cases, analogous to don&#x27;t-care terms in digital logic. It is the responsibility of the programmer to write code that never invokes undefined behavior, although compiler implementations are allowed to issue diagnostics when this happens. Compilers nowadays have flags that enable such diagnostics, for example, codice_1 enables the &quot;undefined behavior sanitizer&quot; (UBSan) in gcc 4.9 and in clang. However, this flag is not the default and enabling it is a choice of the person who builds the code.

Under some circumstances there can be specific restrictions on undefined behavior. For example, the instruction set specifications of a CPU might leave the behavior of some forms of an instruction undefined, but if the CPU supports memory protection then the specification will probably include a blanket rule stating that no user-accessible instruction may cause a hole in the operating system&#x27;s security; so an actual CPU would be permitted to corrupt user registers in response to such an instruction, but would not be allowed to, for example, switch into supervisor mode.

The runtime platform can also provide some restrictions or guarantees on undefined behavior, if the toolchain or the runtime explicitly document that specific constructs found in the source code are mapped to specific well-defined mechanisms available at runtime. For example, an interpreter may document a particular behavior for some operations that are undefined in the language specification, while other interpreters or compilers for the same language may not. A compiler produces executable code for a specific ABI, filling the semantic gap in ways that depend on the compiler version: the documentation for that compiler version and the ABI specification can provide restrictions on undefined behavior. Relying on these implementation details makes the software non-portable, but portability may not be a concern if the software is not supposed to be used outside of a specific runtime.

Undefined behavior can result in a program crash or even in failures that are harder to detect and make the program look like it is working normally, such as silent loss of data and production of incorrect results.

== Benefits ==
Documenting an operation as undefined behavior allows compilers to assume that this operation will never happen in a conforming program. This gives the compiler more information about the code and this information can lead to more optimization opportunities.

An example for the C language:
int foo(unsigned char x)
 int value = 2147483600; /* assuming 32-bit int and 8-bit char */
 value += x;
 if (value &lt; 2147483600)
 bar();
 return value;


The value of codice_2 cannot be negative and, given that signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C, the compiler can assume that codice_3 will always be false. Thus the codice_4 statement, including the call to the function codice_5, can be ignored by the compiler since the test expression in the codice_4 has no side effects and its condition will never be satisfied. The code is therefore semantically equivalent to:
int foo(unsigned char x)
 int value = 2147483600;
 value += x;
 return value;


Had the compiler been forced to assume that signed integer overflow has &quot;wraparound&quot; behavior, then the transformation above would not have been legal.

Such optimizations become hard to spot by humans when the code is more complex and other optimizations, like inlining, take place. For example, another function may call the above function:
void run_tasks(unsigned char *ptrx) {
 int z;
 z = foo(*ptrx);
 while (*ptrx &gt; 60) {
 run_one_task(ptrx, z);
}
The compiler is free to optimize away the codice_7-loop here by applying value range analysis: by inspecting codice_8, it knows that the initial value pointed to by codice_9 cannot possibly exceed 47 (as any more would trigger undefined behavior in codice_8); therefore, the initial check of codice_11 will always be false in a conforming program. Going further, since the result codice_12 is now never used and codice_8 has no side effects, the compiler can optimize codice_14 to be an empty function that returns immediately. The disappearance of the codice_7-loop may be especially surprising if codice_8 is defined in a separately compiled object file.

Another benefit from allowing signed integer overflow to be undefined is that it makes it possible to store and manipulate a variable&#x27;s value in a processor register that is larger than the size of the variable in the source code. For example, if the type of a variable as specified in the source code is narrower than the native register width (such as codice_17 on a 64-bit machine, a common scenario), then the compiler can safely use a signed 64-bit integer for the variable in the machine code it produces, without changing the defined behavior of the code. If a program depended on the behavior of a 32-bit integer overflow, then a compiler would have to insert additional logic when compiling for a 64-bit machine, because the overflow behavior of most machine instructions depends on the register width.

Undefined behavior also allows more compile-time checks by both compilers and static program analysis.

== Risks ==
C and C++ standards have several forms of undefined behavior throughout, which offer increased liberty in compiler implementations and compile-time checks at the expense of undefined run-time behavior if present. In particular, the ISO standard for C has an appendix listing common sources of undefined behavior. Moreover, compilers are not required to diagnose code that relies on undefined behavior. Hence, it is common for programmers, even experienced ones, to rely on undefined behavior either by mistake, or simply because they are not well-versed in the rules of the language that can span hundreds of pages. This can result in bugs that are exposed when a different compiler, or different settings, are used. Testing or fuzzing with dynamic undefined behavior checks enabled, e.g., the Clang sanitizers, can help to catch undefined behavior not diagnosed by the compiler or static analyzers.

Undefined behavior can lead to security vulnerabilities in software. For example, buffer overflows and other security vulnerabilities in the major web browsers are due to undefined behavior. When GCC&#x27;s developers changed their compiler in 2008 such that it omitted certain overflow checks that relied on undefined behavior, CERT issued a warning against the newer versions of the compiler. Linux Weekly News pointed out that the same behavior was observed in PathScale C, Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 and several other compilers; the warning was later amended to warn about various compilers.

== Examples in C and C++ ==
The major forms of undefined behavior in C can be broadly classified as: spatial memory safety violations, temporal memory safety violations, integer overflow, strict aliasing violations, alignment violations, unsequenced modifications, data races, and loops that neither perform I/O nor terminate.

In C the use of any automatic variable before it has been initialized yields undefined behavior, as does integer division by zero, signed integer overflow, indexing an array outside of its defined bounds (see buffer overflow), or null pointer dereferencing. In general, any instance of undefined behavior leaves the abstract execution machine in an unknown state, and causes the behavior of the entire program to be undefined.

Attempting to modify a string literal causes undefined behavior:&lt;ref name=&quot;C++03 2.13.4/2&quot;&gt;ISO/IEC (2003). &quot;ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E): Programming Languages – C++ §2.13.4 String literals [lex.string]&quot; para. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
char *p = &quot;wikipedia&quot;; // valid C, deprecated in C++98/C++03, ill-formed as of C++11
p[0] = &#x27;W&#x27;; // undefined behavior
Integer division by zero results in undefined behavior:&lt;ref name=&quot;C++03 5.6/4&quot;&gt;ISO/IEC (2003). &quot;ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E): Programming Languages – C++ §5.6 Multiplicative operators [expr.mul]&quot; para. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
int x = 1;
return x / 0; // undefined behavior
Certain pointer operations may result in undefined behavior:&lt;ref name=&quot;C++03 5.6/5&quot;&gt;ISO/IEC (2003). &quot;ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E): Programming Languages - C++ §5.7 Additive operators [expr.add]&quot; para. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
int arr[4] = {0, 1, 2, 3};
int *p = arr + 5; // undefined behavior for indexing out of bounds
p = NULL;
int a = *p; // undefined behavior for dereferencing a null pointer
In C and C++, the relational comparison of pointers to objects (for less-than or greater-than comparison) is only strictly defined if the pointers point to members of the same object, or elements of the same array.&lt;ref name=&quot;C++03 5.9/2&quot;&gt;ISO/IEC (2003). &quot;ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E): Programming Languages – C++ §5.9 Relational operators [expr.rel]&quot; para. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Example:
int main(void)
 int a = 0;
 int b = 0;
 return &amp;a &lt; &amp;b; /* undefined behavior */


Reaching the end of a value-returning function (other than codice_18) without a return statement results in undefined behavior if the value of the function call is used by the caller:&lt;ref name=&quot;C99 6.9.1/12&quot;&gt;ISO/IEC (2007). &quot;ISO/IEC 9899:2007(E): Programming Languages – C §6.9 External definitions&quot; para. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
int f()
} /* undefined behavior if the value of the function call is used*/
Modifying an object between two sequence points more than once produces undefined behavior. There are considerable changes in what causes undefined behavior in relation to sequence points as of C++11. Modern compilers can emit warnings when they encounter multiple unsequenced modifications to the same object. The following example will cause undefined behavior in both C and C++.
int f(int i) {
 return i++ + i++; /* undefined behavior: two unsequenced modifications to i */


When modifying an object between two sequence points, reading the value of the object for any other purpose than determining the value to be stored is also undefined behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;C99 6.5/2&quot;&gt;ISO/IEC (1999). &quot;ISO/IEC 9899:1999(E): Programming Languages – C §6.5 Expressions&quot; para. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
a[i] = i++; // undefined behavior
printf(&quot;%d %d\n&quot;, ++n, power(2, n)); // also undefined behavior
In C/C++ bitwise shifting a value by a number of bits which is either a negative number or is greater than or equal to the total number of bits in this value results in undefined behavior. The safest way (regardless of compiler vendor) is to always keep the number of bits to shift (the right operand of the codice_19 and codice_20 bitwise operators) within the range: [codice_21] (where codice_22 is the left operand).
int num = -1;
unsigned int val = 1 « num; // shifting by a negative number - undefined behavior

num = 32; // or whatever number greater than 31
val = 1 « num; // the literal &#x27;1&#x27; is typed as a 32-bit integer - in this case shifting by more than 31 bits is undefined behavior

num = 64; // or whatever number greater than 63
unsigned long long val2 = 1ULL « num; // the literal &#x27;1ULL&#x27; is typed as a 64-bit integer - in this case shifting by more than 63 bits is undefined behavior
== Examples in Rust ==
While undefined behavior is never present in safe Rust, it is possible to invoke undefined behavior in unsafe Rust in many ways. For example, creating an invalid reference (a reference which does not refer to a valid value) invokes immediate undefined behavior:
fn main() {
 // The following line invokes immediate undefined behaviour.
 let _null_reference: &amp;i32 = unsafe { std::mem::zeroed() };


It is not necessary to use the reference; undefined behavior is invoked merely from the creation of such a reference.

<text>Force Five is an American adaptation of five different anime television series. In the United States, this series was primarily shown only in New England, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, though it did make brief appearances in other markets, such as Texas, and Northern California on KICU-TV 36. It was also shown in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on CFMT channel 47 and in Asia on Star Plus during the 1990s. It was produced by Jim Terry and his company American Way, and it consisted of five imported Japanese giant robot serials (originally produced in the mid-1970s by Toei Animation) in response to the popularity of the Shogun Warriors toy collection. Mattel was one of the sponsors of the series.

In an anthology style, the five shows were broadcast simultaneously with one episode of each serial assigned a specific weekday. Additionally, all of the shows were edited into two-hour films and marketed on video tape by Family Home Entertainment. In the UK, Krypton Force released several of these programmes but under different series titles.

==&quot;Force Five&quot; series==
Force Five consisted of the following five series:
Originally, &quot;Great Mazinger&quot; was meant to be among the five shows, but at the last minute was swapped out for &quot;Starzinger&quot;.

<doc id="515999" wikidata="Q4973263" url="?curid=515999" title="Brokaw bandgap reference">
<text>Brokaw bandgap reference is a voltage reference circuit widely used in integrated circuits, with an output voltage around 1.25 V with low temperature dependence. This particular circuit is one type of a bandgap voltage reference, named after Paul Brokaw, the author of its first publication.
Like all temperature-independent bandgap references, the circuit maintains an internal voltage source that has a positive temperature coefficient and another internal voltage source that has a negative temperature coefficient. By summing the two together, the temperature dependence can be canceled. Additionally, either of the two internal sources can be used as a temperature sensor.

In the Brokaw bandgap reference, the circuit uses negative feedback (by means of an operational amplifier) to force a constant current through two bipolar transistors with different emitter areas. By the Ebers–Moll model of a transistor,
* The transistor with the larger emitter area requires a smaller base–emitter voltage for the same current.
* The &quot;difference&quot; between the two base–emitter voltages has a positive temperature coefficient (i.e., it increases with temperature).
* The base–emitter voltage for each transistor has a negative temperature coefficient (i.e., it decreases with temperature).
The circuit output is the sum of one of the base–emitter voltages with a multiple of the base–emitter voltage differences. With appropriate component choices, the two opposing temperature coefficients will cancel each other exactly and the output will have no temperature dependence.

In the example circuit shown, the opamp ensures that its inverting and non-inverting inputs are at the same voltage. This means that the currents in each collector resistor are identical, so the collector currents of Q1 and Q2 are also identical. If Q2 has an emitter area that is formula_1 times larger than Q1, its base-emitter voltage will be lower than that of Q1 by a magnitude of formula_2. This voltage is generated across formula_3 and so defines the current formula_4 in each leg as formula_5. The output voltage (at the opamp output) is therefore formula_6, or: 

formula_7 

The first term has a negative temperature coefficient; the second term has a positive temperature coefficient (from its formula_8). By an appropriate choice of formula_1 and formula_10 and formula_3, these temperature coefficients can be made to cancel, giving an output voltage that is nearly independent of temperature. The magnitude of this output voltage can be shown to be approximately equal to the bandgap voltage (EG0) of Silicon extrapolated to 0 K.

<doc id="516011" wikidata="Q3409203" url="?curid=516011" title="President of Greece">
<text>The president of Greece, officially the president of the Hellenic Republic (), commonly referred to in Greek as the president of the Republic (), is the head of state of Greece. The president is elected by the Hellenic Parliament; the role has been mainly ceremonial since the 1986 constitutional reform. The office was formally established by the Constitution of Greece in 1975, but has antecedents in the Second Hellenic Republic of 1924–1935 and the Greek junta in 1973–1974 which predated the transition to the current Third Hellenic Republic. The incumbent, since 13 March 2020, is Katerina Sakellaropoulou, the country&#x27;s first female president.

== Powers ==
The president is the nominal commander-in-chief of the Greek Armed Forces and occupies the first place in the country&#x27;s order of precedence. Although the Greek Constitution of 1974 vested the presidency with considerable powers on paper, in practice presidents took a largely ceremonial role; the prime minister of Greece is the active chief executive of the Greek government and the country&#x27;s leading political figure. The president&#x27;s role was formally brought into line with practice by the 1986 constitutional amendment, which reduced the official powers.

== Election ==
According to Article 32 of the Greek Constitution, the president is elected for a five-year term by the Hellenic Parliament in a special session at least a month before the incumbent&#x27;s term expires. Voting takes place in up to five ballots, separated by no more than five days.

The first and second ballots require a supermajority of 200 out of the 300-person body, dropping to 180 on the third. The fourth ballot requires a simple majority of 151 votes. The fifth and last ballot is then contested between the two candidates with the most votes and decided by a relative majority.

== Oath of office ==
Before taking office, the president must recite an oath in front of the Parliament according to the Article 33, paragraph 2 of the Greek Constitution:

== Succession ==
According to the Constitution of Greece, in the event of a temporary absence of the president of Greece on account of illness, travel abroad or similar circumstances, the speaker of the parliament serves as acting president, and exercises the powers of the state president until the president resumes their functions, and in the event that the presidency falls vacant as a result of death or resignation or for any other reason, until the election of a new president. The most recent person to have served as Acting President was Ioannis Alevras, following the resignation of Constantine Karamanlis due to the constitutional crisis in 1985.

== Official residence ==
The official residence of the president of Greece is the Presidential Mansion, formerly the New Royal Palace, in central Athens.

== History ==
The current Third Hellenic Republic () was established in 1974 during the period of &quot;metapolitefsi&quot;, after the end of the Greek junta which had controlled Greece since the coup d&#x27;état of 21 April 1967.

On 1 June 1973 the then leader of the military junta and regent for the exiled King Constantine II, Georgios Papadopoulos, abolished the Greek monarchy and proclaimed himself President of the Republic. A staged referendum on 29 July 1973 confirmed the regime change, and passed a new constitution which established a presidential republic. This attempt at controlled democratization was ended by Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis&#x27; overthrow of Papadopoulos on 25 November 1973. The republic and its symbols (but not the semi-presidential system) were formally maintained, but they were nothing more than a façade for the military regime. Lt. General Phaedon Gizikis was appointed President of the Republic, but power was in the hands of Ioannidis, who ruled behind the scenes.

After the fall of the junta and the return to civilian rule under Konstantinos Karamanlis in August 1974, the constitutional acts of the military regime were deemed invalid, and a new referendum was held on 8 December 1974, which confirmed the abolition of the monarchy. In the interim, Gizikis, remained in office as President. After the plebiscite, he was succeeded by the first elected president, Michail Stasinopoulos.

A new constitution, promulgated on 11 June 1975, declared Greece a &quot;presidential parliamentary democracy&quot; (or &quot;republic&quot; – the Greek δημοκρατία can be translated both ways). The first constitutional amendments were proposed by Andreas Papandreou in 1985, though dubious procedures triggering a constitutional crisis, and they reduced the presidential powers, which were acting as checks and balances against the powerful position of the prime minister. The constitution was further revised in 2001, 2008, and 2019, and is still in force today.

<doc id="516013" wikidata="Q1906269" url="?curid=516013" title="Parasol Stars">
<text>called Parasol Stars: Rainbow Islands II on the NES is a video game by Taito released in 1991. It is a sequel to &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot; and the third game in the &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; series.
On July 11, 2024, the game got ported for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox one, Xbox series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

==Gameplay==

Bubby and Bobby (the characters&#x27; human names) star once again as the main characters, retaining their human forms from &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;, but &quot;Parasol Stars&quot; is more of a take on &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; than it is on &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;.

The game takes place on a number of different worlds, each with a distinct theme. Each world features seven rounds, the last one always hosting a boss that must be defeated to progress to the next world. There are eight main worlds, but in order to complete the game properly, the player must open a secret door on the final world by collecting three of the Star items - allowing access to 2 secret worlds, themed around &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; and &quot;Chack&#x27;n Pop&quot; that are not initially visible on the main screen. Completing these two lead to the final boss, Chaostikhan (the one responsible for stealing color from the worlds, and supposedly the mastermind behind the previous game&#x27;s villains) and the true ending. According to an ACE magazine in-depth preview, the Amiga and Atari ST versions also contain a secret &quot;Nightmare&quot; world.

The player is armed with a parasol. While it is normally closed, the player can deploy it in two ways; either open in front of them, or open above the head. The parasol is a multipurpose device, it can block as a shield, stun enemies, capture droplets or hurl enemies. At many points it can be used as a parachute.

The rounds are simple arrangements of platforms. Almost every level has droplets which drip from points in the level. They fall under the influence of gravity and roll along the platforms within the screen. The player can capture these on their parasol and throw them at enemies.

The parasol can hold more than one droplet at once; if five are held, they merge into a large droplet with a special power. There are four different kinds of droplets, with a mostly elemental theme, some of which are carried over from &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;.

==Release==
Unlike many other games in the series, &quot;Parasol Stars&quot; was never released to arcades - it was originally developed for the NEC PC Engine, and later converted to a number of other home systems. &quot;Parasol Stars&quot; was misreported as being the third coin-op in the &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; series by many magazines at the time, and there are rumours about prototypes for an arcade version. Taito has officially stated that an arcade game was never produced. Mick West (who was the programmer of the Amiga and Atari ST versions) said that they ported the game directly from the PC Engine by playing it and that he did not know anything about an arcade version.

The game was released in limited quantities in North America for the TurboGrafx-16 by Working Designs. The Amiga, Atari ST, NES, and Game Boy versions were produced by Ocean Software and published exclusively in Europe in 1992. A ZX Spectrum port was planned, but later cancelled. The game was also planned for the Commodore 64, but was cancelled as well. Ocean initially explained that the developer&#x27;s computer was stolen in a burglary, but it was later revealed that the game was scrapped after the freelance developer&#x27;s wife destroyed said computer in a drunken rage, along with the backups of the work. The compilation release &quot;Bubble Bobble featuring Rainbow Islands&quot; for the Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and PC was originally going to include &quot;Parasol Stars&quot; as well, but was dropped from the lineup mid-development.

==Relation to other games==
The game&#x27;s subtitle is &quot;The Story of Bubble Bobble III&quot;, which was also used as the subtitle for &quot;Bubble Memories&quot;, released in arcades in 1995. &quot;Bubble Memories&quot; is a prequel (given the &quot;Memories&quot; part of the name) to the 1994 game &quot;Bubble Symphony&quot;, which was released as &quot;Bubble Bobble 2&quot; in some countries. Nonetheless, &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot; is indeed the sequel to the original &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;, even though said sequel doesn&#x27;t retain the gameplay from the first. Since &quot;Bubble Memories&quot; was released years after &quot;Parasol Stars&quot;, it may be a retcon in which &quot;Parasol Stars&quot; never happened, whereby after the events of &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;, the humans Bubby and Bobby are once again transformed into the bubble dragons Bubblun and Bobblun. However, it&#x27;s also possible that &quot;Parasol Stars&quot; could be a side story, or &quot;gaiden&quot; to the series occurring after &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;, but before &quot;Bubble Memories&quot;. The game has also been released as &quot;Parasol Stars: Rainbow Islands II&quot;, such as on the NES.

==Musical reference==
Much like &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot; used &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;″s song &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot;, also &quot;Parasol Stars&quot; made a reference to a well known song in its soundtrack. The game&#x27;s boss fight music is a variation of the 1989 summer hit &quot;Lambada&quot; by the French-Brazilian pop group Kaoma.

==Reception==
&quot;CU Amiga&quot; praised the game, giving it 95% and a &quot;Super Star&quot;. &quot;Amiga Power&quot; was a little less enthusiastic, giving it 88%.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; picked the game as the #15 greatest game available in 1991, saying: &quot;This one&#x27;s even more fun to play than it is to describe: Bubby (or Bobby when two play simultaneously) uses his umbrella to flick bizarre meanies across the screen and turn them into pieces of cake, apples, mushrooms, etc., which he then gobbles up in order to earn points&quot;.

<text>Sitia (Latin and Italian) or Siteia (, ) is a port town and a municipality in Lasithi, Crete, Greece. The town has 11,166 inhabitants and the municipality has 20,438 (2021). It lies east of Agios Nikolaos and northeast of Ierapetra. Sitia&#x27;s port is on the Sea of Crete, part of the Aegean Sea and is one of the economic centers of the Lasithi region. European route E75 (which ends in Vardø, Norway) starts in Sitia. The town is served by the Sitia Public Airport. It has not experienced the effects of mass tourism even though there is a long beach along the road leading to Vai and several places of historical interest.

==History==
The settlement of the town dates to pre-Minoan times. Excavations in the Petras neighbourhood have found architectural remains from the end of the Neolithic (3000 BC) and continue through the Bronze Age 3000-1050 BC, including the Minoan palace of Petras. Several other Minoan settlements have been found within the municipality, notably Itanos and Mochlos.

According to Diogenes Laërtius, Sitia was the home of Myson of Chen, one of the Seven Sages of Greece.
===Name===
The ancient Itia or Etea (, ) appears to correspond roughly to modern Sitia. The name Siteia itself is probably the result of rebracketing of (, &quot;at&quot;) and .

===Ancient Sitia===

Sitia was founded by Minoans as Itia, and was a place of refuge for native Cretans after the fall of the major Minoan settlements. The city continued to prosper through the Classical, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods as one of the island&#x27;s chief ports.

===Venetian era===

The town was later expanded and fortified by the Venetians after their acquisition of Crete in 1204, who used it as a base of operations for the Eastern Mediterranean. During the Venetian occupation, the town was destroyed three times: first by an earthquake in 1508, then by the Turkish pirate Hayreddin Barbarossa in 1538, and finally by the Venetians themselves in 1651. This final destruction took place in the context of the Cretan War (1645–1669) in which the Venetians battled to retain their hold on the island against the Ottoman Empire. While Sitia did not fall in the initial Turkish advance, the Venetians did not have the resources to withstand a long siege, and accordingly destroyed the fortifications and removed the garrison to Heraklion. The local inhabitants meanwhile removed westwards to Liopetro and the site was subsequently abandoned for the next 200 years of Turkish rule.

The main remnant of the Venetian occupation is the &quot;Kazarma&quot; (from Italian &quot;casa di arma&quot;), the old fortress overlooking the harbour.

===Modern era===
After the Venetian period and subsequent abandonment the town was rebuilt until 1870 by the progressive Turkish governor Hüseyin Avni Pasha following the Cretan Revolt. It was subsequently created capital of the Sanjak of Lasit (later Lasithi, which it remains to this day). Under Turkish rule the town was renamed Avniye after its rebuilder, but as the local Greeks continued to use the traditional name of Sitia this innovation did not survive independence. Despite the turbulent history of Crete in leaving the Ottoman Empire and joining Greece, as well as the First World War, the population almost quadrupled between 1881 (570 inhabitants) and 1928 (2,100 inhabitants). Major public works were carried out by the Greek government in 1911 to modernise the town, in the course of which much of the Ottoman era town was rebuilt, as well as a fresh water supply.

==Geography==
===Municipality===
The municipality Sitia was formed at the 2010 local government reform by the merger of the three former municipalities Itanos, Lefki and Sitia, which became municipal units. In November 2011, Sitia incorporated the four communities Chrysopigi, Lithines, Perivolakia and Pefkoi, which had previously been part of the municipality Ierapetra. In 2014, these communities were grouped into the new municipal unit Analipsi.

The municipality Sitia consists of the following municipal units and communities:
*Analipsi (Chrysopigi, Lithines, Pefkoi, Perivolakia)
*Itanos (Karydi, Palaikastro, Zakros)
*Lefki (Agia Triada, Apidia, Armenoi, Chandras, Pappagiannades, Ziros)
*Sitia (Achladia, Agios Georgios, Chamezi, Exo Mouliana, Katsidoni, Krya, Lastros, Maronia, Mesa Mouliana, Myrsini, Piskokefalo, Praisos, Roussa Ekklisia, Sitia, Sfaka, Skopi, Stavromenos, Tourloti)

The municipality has an area of , the municipal unit .

===Province===
Sitia Province or Eparchy (, ) was one of the provinces of Lasithi. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipality Sitia and the municipal unit Makry Gialos. It was abolished in 2006.

===Environmentally protected areas===

There are a number of sites in the municipality of Sitia that are protected as National Parks, Aesthetic Forests, Wildlife Refuges etc. under national and international laws. Sitia is home to the Sitia UNESCO Global Geopark.
Notable examples are:
*Dionysades Islands which carry many rare and endangered plant species and also serve as a refuge of several animal species (mostly birds and small reptiles), including the falcon, &quot;Falco eleonorae&quot;, which finds sanctuary here.
*Vai palm forest.
*Richtis Gorge and waterfall.

===Climate===
Sitia has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters.

==Infrastructure==

The municipality of Sitia is served by the Sitia Public Airport which offers several domestic destinations. The first landing occurred on June 7, 1984 and the airport opened officially on June 9, 1984. Construction of new building facilities that included a control tower was completed in May 1993. Runway and apron extension works were finished in May 2003. In 2011, the local authorities completed negotiations with international travel agents for organising regular charter flights starting in May 2012. The same year, local officials negotiationed with the low-cost airline Ryanair.

In addition, Sitia is served by a port which connects Sitia and eastern Crete with several other Greek islands as well as with the port of Piraeus. The town also has a marina which accommodates smaller fishing boats and yachts.

===Health services===
Sitia General Hospital was founded in 1947 as a local health center and was later (1994) relocated to a new 7500m2 (110-bed capacity) building and accordingly upgraded to serve as the main hospital for the municipality of Sitia and the surrounding area.

<doc id="516019" wikidata="Q239860" url="?curid=516019" title="Cassandra Wilson">
<text>Cassandra Wilson (born December 4, 1955) is an American jazz singer, songwriter, and producer from Jackson, Mississippi. She is one of the most successful female jazz singers and has been described by critic Gary Giddins as &quot;a singer blessed with an unmistakable timbre and attack [who has] expanded the playing field&quot; by incorporating blues, country, and folk music into her work. She has won numerous awards, including two Grammys, and was named &quot;America&#x27;s Best Singer&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2001.

==Early life and career==
Cassandra Wilson is the third and youngest child of Herman Fowlkes, Jr., a guitarist, bassist, and music teacher; and Mary McDaniel, an elementary school teacher who earned her PhD in education. Her ancestry includes Fon, Yoruba, Irish and Welsh. Between her mother&#x27;s love for Motown and her father&#x27;s dedication to jazz, Wilson&#x27;s parents sparked her early interest in music.

Wilson&#x27;s earliest formal musical education consisted of classical lessons; she studied piano from the age of six to thirteen and played clarinet in the middle school concert and marching bands. When she was tired of this training, she asked her father to teach her the guitar. Instead, he gave her a lesson in self-reliance, suggesting she study Mel Bay method books. Wilson explored guitar on her own, developing what she has described as an &quot;intuitive&quot; approach. During this time she began writing her own songs, adopting a folk style. She also appeared in the musical theater productions, including &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; as Dorothy, crossing racial lines in a recently desegregated school system.

Wilson attended Millsaps College and Jackson State University. She graduated with a degree in mass communications. Outside of the classroom, she spent her nights working with R&amp;B, funk, and pop cover bands, also singing in local coffeehouses. The Black Arts Music Society, founded by John Reese and Alvin Fielder, provided her with her first opportunities to perform bebop. In 2007, Wilson received her PhD in Arts from Millsaps College.

In 1981, she moved to New Orleans for a position as assistant public affairs director for the local television station, WDSU. She did not stay long. Working with mentors who included elder statesmen Earl Turbinton, Alvin Batiste, and Ellis Marsalis, Wilson found encouragement to seriously pursue jazz performance and moved to New York City the following year.

==Musical association with M-Base==
In New York, Wilson&#x27;s focus turned towards improvisation. Heavily influenced by singers Abbey Lincoln and Betty Carter, she fine-tuned her vocal phrasing and scat while studying ear training with trombonist Grachan Moncur, III. Frequenting jam sessions under the tutelage of pianist Sadik Hakim, a Charlie Parker alumnus, she met alto saxophonist Steve Coleman, who encouraged her to look beyond the standard jazz repertoire in favor of developing original material. She would become the vocalist and one of the founding members of the M-Base collective in which Coleman was the leading figure, a stylistic outgrowth of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) and Black Artists Group (BAG) that re-imagined the grooves of funk and soul within the context of traditional and avant-garde jazz. Peter Watrous in an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot; states:

The M-Base group in Brooklyn, working with both jazz and pop forms, makes music that at first sounds like funk from the 1970s. Like the music played by Mr. Marsalis (and his brother Wynton) the music made by M-Base - Steve Coleman, with Greg Osby, Cassandra Wilson and Geri Allen – is, at its best, filled with subtle ideas working behind the mask of popular music. In Mr. Coleman&#x27;s group a singer is supported by an electric bass, guitar, drums and electric keyboards, a shiny musical mix that has familiar rock and funk references; yet, because of all its rhythmic and metric manipulations, sounds new.

Although the voice – typically treated as the focal point of any arrangement in which it is included – was not an obvious choice for M-Base&#x27;s complex textures or harmonically elaborated melodies, Wilson wove herself into the fabric of these settings with wordless improv and lyrics. She can be heard on Coleman&#x27;s debut as a leader &quot;Motherland Pulse&quot; (1985), then as member of his &quot;Five Elements&quot; on &quot;On the Edge of Tomorrow&quot; (1986), &quot;World Expansion&quot; (1986), &quot;Sine Die&quot; (1987), and on M-Base Collective&#x27;s sole recording as a large ensemble &quot;Anatomy of a Groove&quot; (1992).

At the same time, Wilson toured with avant-garde trio New Air featuring alto saxophonist Henry Threadgill and recorded &quot;Air Show No. 1&quot; (1987) in Italy. A decade her senior and an AACM member, Threadgill has been lauded as a composer for his ability to transcend stylistic boundaries, a trait he and Wilson share.

==Solo career==

Like fellow M-Base artists, Wilson signed to the Munich-based, independent label JMT. She released her first recording as a leader &quot;Point of View&quot; in 1986. Like the majority of her JMT albums that followed, originals by Wilson in keeping with M-Base dominated these sessions; she would also record material by and co-written with Coleman, Jean-Paul Bourelly, and James Weidman as well as a few standards. Her throaty contralto gradually emerges over the course of these recordings, making its way to the foreground. She developed a remarkable ability to stretch and bend pitches, elongate syllables, manipulate tone and timbre from dusky to hollow.

While these recordings established her as a serious musician, Wilson received her first broad critical acclaim for the album of standards recorded in the middle of this period, &quot;Blue Skies&quot; (1988). Her signing with Blue Note Records in 1993 marked a crucial turning point in her career and major breakthrough to audiences beyond jazz with albums selling in the hundreds of thousands of copies.

Beginning with &quot;Blue Light &#x27;Til Dawn&quot; (1993) her repertoire moved towards a broad synthesis of blues, pop, jazz, world music, and country. Although she continued to perform originals and standards, she adopted songs as diverse as Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Come On in My Kitchen&quot;, Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Black Crow&quot;, The Monkees&#x27; &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot;, and Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;.

Wilson&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;New Moon Daughter&quot; won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Performance. In 1997, she recorded and toured as a featured vocalist with Wynton Marsalis&#x27; Pulitzer Prize winning composition, &quot;Blood on the Fields&quot;.

Miles Davis was one of Wilson&#x27;s greatest influences. In 1989, Wilson performed as the opening act for Davis at the JVC Jazz Festival in Chicago. In 1999 she produced &quot;Traveling Miles&quot; as a tribute to Davis. The album developed from a series of jazz concerts that she performed at Lincoln Center in November 1997 in Davis&#x27; honor, and includes three selections based on Davis&#x27; own compositions, from which Wilson adapted the original themes.

==Personal life==
Wilson was married to Anthony Wilson from 1981 to 1983.

She has a son, Jeris, born in the late 1980s. Her song &quot;Out Loud (Jeris&#x27; Blues)&quot; on the album &quot;She Who Weeps&quot; is dedicated to him. For many years she and her son lived in New York City&#x27;s Sugar Hill, in an apartment that once belonged to Count Basie, Lena Horne and the boxer Joe Louis.

From 2000 to 2003 Wilson was married to actor Isaach de Bankolé, who directed her in the concert film &quot;Traveling Miles: Cassandra Wilson&quot; (2000).

Wilson and her mother are members of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

<text>Ziziphus is a genus of spiny shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family, Rhamnaceae. It includes 68 species native to tropical and subtropical Africa, Eurasia, and Australia and tropical South America. The leaves are alternate, entire, with three prominent basal veins, and often aromatic. The flowers are small, inconspicuous yellow-green. The fruit is an edible drupe, often very sweet and sugary, reminiscent of a date in texture and flavour.

Well known species include the commonly cultivated &quot;Ziziphus jujuba&quot; (jujube), &quot;Ziziphus spina-christi&quot; from southwestern Asia, &quot;Ziziphus lotus&quot; from the Mediterranean region, and ber (&quot;Ziziphus mauritiana&quot;), which is found from western Africa to India.

==Etymology==
The generic name is derived via classical Latin from Hellenistic Greek, where it is presumed to have been borrowed from another language, perhaps from &quot;zizfum&quot; or &quot;zizafun&quot;, the Persian word for &quot;Z. lotus&quot;.

==Ecology==
&quot;Ziziphus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Bucculatrix zizyphella&quot;, which feeds exclusively on the genus, and &quot;Endoclita malabaricus&quot;.

Species are distributed throughout the world in tropical and warm temperate areas, from rain forests to deserts. Some species are evergreen, others are winter or drought deciduous.

Species adapted to dry climates are smaller and have oleifera cells that produce a fragrant aroma.

==Uses==

The temperate &quot;Ziziphus jujuba&quot; (Chinese jujube) and the tropical &quot;Ziziphus mauritiana&quot; (Indian Jujube) are economically important fruit trees.

In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), &quot;suan zao ren&quot; (&quot;Ziziphus jujuba&quot;) is considered to be sweet and sour in taste, and neutral in action. It is believed to nourish the heart yin, augment the liver blood, and calm the spirit (TCM medical terms). It is used to treat irritability, insomnia and heart palpitations.

==Mythology==
The mythological lotus tree which occurs in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; is often equated with &quot;Z. lotus&quot;.

The Islamic mythological lote tree of Seventh Heaven, the Sidrat al-Muntaha is often equated with either Ziziphus spina-christi.

<doc id="516026" wikidata="Q3161114" url="?curid=516026" title="James G. Fair">
<text>James Graham Fair (December 3, 1831December 28, 1894) was an Irish immigrant to the United States who became a highly successful mining engineer and businessman. His investments in silver mines in Nevada made him a millionaire, and he was one of the famous &quot;silver kings&quot; who became wealthy on the Comstock Lode. Fair later became a real estate investor and railroad builder in California. In 1881, he was elected a United States Senator from Nevada. Nearly all other major so-called robber barons were Protestants (Episcopal or Presbyterian) while Fair himself died a Roman Catholic though born into poverty to Anglican parents.

==Early life==
Born to a poor Irish family in Clogher, County Tyrone, James Fair came with his father to the United States in 1843 and grew up on a farm in Illinois. There he received an extensive education in business before moving to California in 1850, where he prospected the Feather River country for gold embedded in quartz rather than pan for placer gold. His attention shifted to Nevada, where he operated a stamp mill on the Carson River and landed various mine superintendent positions around the Comstock Lode region. He became superintendent of the Hale and Norcross Mine in Virginia City, Nevada in 1867.

He formed a partnership with three fellow Irishmen: John William Mackay and the San Francisco saloon owners James C. Flood and William S. O&#x27;Brien. The company was formally &quot;Flood and O&#x27;Brien&quot;, but popularly known as the &quot;Bonanza Firm&quot;. The four made large fortunes in shares in silver mines on the Comstock Lode, the first major silver district discovered in the United States. In twenty years time the Comstock Lode produced over one hundred million dollars. The partners controlled and operated various mines on the Comstock, but their greatest success came in 1873 when miners in their Consolidated Virginia mine found the large ore body that became known as &quot;the big bonanza.&quot;

Fair invested his portion in railroads and real estate, bringing his private fortune up to $50 million. Although Fair was acknowledged to be a capable mine superintendent and a shrewd businessman, he was not well liked, and carried the nickname &quot;Slippery Jim.&quot; He invested much of his income from the Comstock in railroads and San Francisco real estate. Fair and Mackay owned the Nevada Bank of San Francisco, a rival to William Chapman Ralston&#x27;s Bank of California; after the collapse of Ralston&#x27;s financial empire, the Nevada Bank was for a time the largest bank in America at the height of the silver boom.

==South Pacific Coast Railroad==

In 1876, in partnership with several others, Fair established the narrow-gauge South Pacific Coast Railroad. From its beginning near present-day Newark, the line extended down the east side of San Francisco Bay, through San Jose and Los Gatos and southward over the Santa Cruz Mountains over a route that entailed a 6,200-foot tunnel, another 5,000-foot tunnel and six shorter ones. Some six hundred Chinese workers were employed in clearing, grading, laying track and tunneling. In that last activity, thirty-one workers lost their lives, primarily from explosions of underground natural gas. At its southern end, the railroad acquired the Santa Cruz &amp; Felton Railroad in Felton. The line over the mountains was completed in May 1880.

The South Pacific Coast Railroad was immediately successful and soon profitable. Fair sought to further expand operations via purchasing street railroad assets of the Oakland Railroad Company. Local opposition to operating steam trains on city streets was so fierce that plans for further expansions were canceled and Fair ended his railroad plans for Oakland entirely soon after. In 1886, Southern Pacific purchased SPC for six million dollars ($ in adjusted for inflation). Southern Pacific later converted the line to San Jose to standard gauge and operated it until 1940, when the over-the-mountains portion of the line was abandoned.

==Political career==
Fair was elected by the Nevada legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1881. He was not much interested in Washington, where he promoted silver issues in the Senate at a time when a movement was afoot to demonetize silver. Fair served one term after which he moved back to San Francisco in 1887.

==Personal life==

In 1861, Fair married Theresa Rooney, who had been keeping a boarding house. She divorced him in 1883 on grounds of &quot;habitual adultery&quot; and brought up their four children on her own, with a very considerable settlement.

In 1890, his eldest daughter &quot;Tessie&quot; was married to Hermann Oelrichs of Norddeutsche Lloyd shipping lines in the grandest wedding that San Francisco had seen. Fair remained in his hotel suite without an invitation. He gave Tessie a million dollars as a wedding gift nonetheless.

His will left $40 million in trust to his two daughters, Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs (née Theresa &quot;Tessie&quot; Alice Fair) and Virginia Graham Fair (who later married William Kissam Vanderbilt II), and his surviving son, Charles Lewis Fair, who died in a car accident in France on August 14, 1902, at age 35, having been disinherited by his father.

After Fair&#x27;s death, Mrs. Nettie Cravens came forward claiming to be his wife. She presented her evidence to a court at trial, but lost the case. She moved to Iowa and lived in obscurity, spending her last days in a mental institution. Later, women&#x27;s rights advocate Phoebe Couzins also claimed a relationship with Fair.

==Death and legacy==
Fair died on 1894 in San Francisco, California, and was originally buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery; after the cemetery closed he was re-buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California.

The Fairmont San Francisco hotel was built as a grand monument to Fair by his daughters Theresa Fair Oelrichs and Virginia Fair Vanderbilt, who named it in honor of their father. Construction began in 1902, but they sold their interests in 1906, days before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

Fair is remembered in Santa Cruz, California in the naming of Fair Avenue, and in San Francisco with Fair Avenue in Bernal Heights.

<doc id="516027" wikidata="Q1154044" url="?curid=516027" title="Kirby's Dream Land">
<text>is a 1992 action-platform game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. It is the first game in the &quot;Kirby&quot; series and marks the debut of Kirby. It introduced many conventions that would appear in later games in the series. The game follows Kirby as he goes through five levels to retrieve the Sparkling Stars and food of Dream Land from King Dedede.

&quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; was the debut game of designer Masahiro Sakurai. He intendeded it to be a simple game that could be easy to pick up and play by those unfamiliar with action games. For more advanced players, he offered additional optional challenges such as a hard mode and the ability to edit Kirby&#x27;s maximum HP and starting number of lives. &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; was re-released on the Nintendo 3DS via the Virtual Console in 2011 and is also one of the games included in the compilation game &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Collection&quot; for the Wii, released to celebrate the series&#x27; 20th anniversary. The game was included as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service in February 2023. The game was the highest grossing in the series, with 5,130,000 copies sold, until being beaten out 30 years later by &quot;Kirby and the Forgotten Land&quot;.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; is a side-scrolling action-platformer. Like many other platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games, levels are played on a two-dimensional plane in which the protagonist, Kirby, has six health points and can move left or right as well as jump. Kirby&#x27;s main method of attack is to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, after which the player can choose to swallow or spit them out as a star-shaped projectile attack. In addition to running and jumping, Kirby can fly by inflating himself with a mouthful of air and flapping his arms. Flying can be done indefinitely; however, while flying, Kirby&#x27;s only method of attack is to release the air puff held in his mouth which cancels his flight.

The game consists of a total of five levels. Levels are made up of a series of large &quot;rooms&quot; connected by doors that lead Kirby to different areas, rather than the single continuous corridors typical of platformers at the time. Some of these doors lead to hidden areas or alternate pathways through the level. The doors act as checkpoints returning the player to the beginning of a &quot;room&quot; should they die rather than starting the level over. The goal of the game is to clear the level by defeating the boss at the end. If Kirby touches a harmful enemy or obstacle, he loses one or more of his health points, depending on the enemy or obstacle he touched. The player starts with a number of lives, which are lost if Kirby loses all of his health or falls into a bottomless pit. Kirby can recover lost health by eating food, found across the stage. The player will receive a Game Over upon losing all of their lives, although they can continue from the beginning of the current stage by selecting &quot;Continue&quot;.

Unlike the copy abilities of later games, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; has more traditional power-ups that offer Kirby temporary abilities when he picks them up, although they are not a big part of gameplay. These often appear in the form of food, such as Spicy Curry that gives Kirby fire breath or a Mint Leaf (Sweet Potato in the Japanese version) that lets Kirby fire air puffs rapidly without losing flight. At the end of each level is a boss Kirby must fight to obtain one of the Sparkling Stars. Most bosses are fought by sucking up small objects or projectiles created by the boss&#x27; attacks and spitting them back at the boss. The third boss, Kaboola, is fought using an unlimited version of the Mint Leaf item, incorporating shoot &#x27;em up elements. The last level before the final boss consists of a boss rush, where Kirby must fight all of the game&#x27;s bosses again going through a short area based on that boss&#x27;s home level. There are also many mini-bosses during the levels.

Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points by defeating enemies and collecting items, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a game over, or if the player resets the game. Once the game has been completed, a code is offered to play an optional extra game, in which the difficulty is significantly increased. Completing the extra game offered a second code that lets the player adjust lives and vitality settings to play an easier or even harder game, and listen to music and sound effects freely.

==Plot==
&quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; is set in the fictional country of Dream Land, which is located on a tiny star-shaped planet far, far away from Earth, named &quot;Planet Popstar&quot; in later games. The Dream Landers are a very peaceful and carefree people that use their magical Sparkling Stars to play and work among the heavens. One night, under the cover of darkness, the gluttonous King Dedede and his minions swoop down from his castle on Mt. Dedede and steal all the food in Dream Land, as well as the Sparkling Stars, which the King distributes among his minions. Without the Sparkling Stars, the Dream Landers can no longer harvest food, and begin to go hungry. As the residents are discussing what to do, a spry little boy named Kirby flies in on the spring breeze, and volunteers to defeat King Dedede and retrieve the food and Stars. Upon successfully doing so, he uses the magic of the Sparkling Stars to transform into a hot air balloon and return the King&#x27;s stolen food back to the people of Dream Land.

==Development==
&quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; was developed by Masahiro Sakurai of HAL Laboratory. Much of the programming was done on a Twin Famicom, a Nintendo-licensed console produced by Sharp Corporation that combined a Famicom and a Famicom Disk System in one unit. As the Twin Famicom did not have keyboard support, a trackball was used in tandem with an on-screen keyboard to input values; Sakurai described the process, which he assumed was &quot;the way [game programming] was done&quot; at the time, as similar to &quot;using a lunchbox to make lunch.&quot;

Kirby initially was a dummy character that the developers used until they could define a more sophisticated image. However the designers grew to like Kirby so much that they decided to keep him instead of using a more advanced character. At the time he was to be named , and the game was named . The title was later changed to , which was still being used late enough in development that box art and advertising material was produced with this name.

Originally, HAL Laboratory was to publish the game independently, but due to the low number of advance orders, the release was delayed, and HAL asked Nintendo to publish the game. Under Nintendo&#x27;s supervision, the game received an extensive marketing campaign, and its title was changed. In order to give the character more international appeal, the developers decided to change Popopo&#x27;s name, so they polled Nintendo of America for suggestions, and eventually chose Kirby. The final Japanese title of the game was &quot;Hoshi no Kirby&quot;, or &quot;Kirby of the Stars&quot;, which became the name of the greater franchise.

During the development of what was referred to as &quot;Twinkle Popo&quot;, there was some initial confusion over the color scheme of Popopo/Kirby. Sakurai had always intended him to be pink, and the concept art reflects this, but Kirby was not pink in the game itself, as the Game Boy system had a monochrome display. Other members of the development team were unaware of Kirby&#x27;s coloration; in particular, Shigeru Miyamoto initially thought that he was yellow. Although pink is still Kirby&#x27;s main color, later games have used a yellow Kirby (nicknamed &quot;Keeby&quot;) to represent the second player in multiplayer, starting in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Course&quot; (1994). When &quot;Kirby of the Stars&quot; was released in Japan, it featured a pink Kirby on its box art. However, Nintendo of America designed the North American box art and advertisements with a white Kirby based on the game&#x27;s grey-scale visuals.

The music was composed by Jun Ishikawa.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; has received generally positive reception. Upon release, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; editors George and Bob shared generally positive opinions of the game; George stated that it is a really fun game, owing its quality to its excellent play control and well thought out concept, while Bob stated that it is deceptively simple looking, when it in fact features a decent challenge for more experienced gamers.

&quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; topped the Japanese &quot;Famitsu&quot; sales charts from May 1992 to June 1992, and in the United States topped Babbage&#x27;s Game Boy sales chart in October 1992. The game sold more than units worldwide as of March 1993. By 1997, units had been sold. , it has sold in excess of 5 million copies worldwide; &quot;Gamasutra&quot; cited its new style of gameplay for its success. At the time, it was HAL Laboratory&#x27;s most successful game. Gamasutra&#x27;s Osamu Inoue attributed the game&#x27;s success to Satoru Iwata, formerly an employee of HAL Laboratory, who Inoue comments has a &quot;simple-minded passion for creating games&quot;.

Retrospectively, it holds an aggregate score of 62% on GameRankings with nine reviews, making it the 17th best Game Boy game. &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Ben Reeves called it the 14th best Game Boy game and felt that it was a relaxing game. Author Wendy Despain used &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;″s plot as an example of how early platform games&#x27; plots progressed, which she collectively described as &quot;the main character needing to reach a villain to put right a wrong.&quot; Humongous Life&#x27;s Jonathan Wahlgren called it a strong game, but felt it to be &quot;too elementary&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar&quot;″s Brett Elston did an article on its music, specifically giving praise to the final boss music, stating that it is the &quot;only song in the original Kirby that had a sense of challenge or conflict instead of skipping through a field of floating cakes.&quot; Nadia Oxford of &quot;1UP.com&quot; praised it for its unique platforming mechanics, describing it as the start of a &quot;gluttonous legend&quot;. Allgame&#x27;s Joshua Crystal called it a &quot;great game for beginner players and ones that enjoy a fun, but short, experience.&quot;

In an article detailing various &quot;Kirby&quot; series video games, &quot;IGN&quot; stated that it was a decent platformer, but basic compared to later games. &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Lucas M. Thomas and Craig Harris included &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; in their wishlist for a hypothetical &quot;Virtual Console&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, commenting that its inclusion would be based on nostalgia rather than it feeling &quot;new and sensational&quot;. They also added that original characters like Kirby were the stars of the Game Boy rather than established characters such as Link, Mario, Samus Aran, and Pit. They would again praise &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; for being an original game in their &quot;History of the Game Boy&quot; article, adding that while &quot;attitude&quot; was common in new platforming mascots, Kirby was cheery and adorable, while the game featured &quot;breezy, casual gameplay and lighthearted atmosphere&quot;. &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Gerald Villoria, Brian Altano, and Ryan Scott called it &quot;basic&quot; compared to later games in the series, adding that it lacked a sense of danger because Kirby could fly. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; listed &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; and its sequel as two of the games they want in the 3DS Virtual Console.

==Sequels==
&quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; has spawned numerous sequels across several video game consoles. The first direct sequel, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, introduced the ability to steal powers from enemies, an ability which would become a staple of the series following it. The series has featured several spin-offs, in differing genres including a racing game &quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot;, pinball game &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Pinball Land&quot;, and an action-golf hybrid game &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Course&quot;. &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; would receive a Game Boy sequel in 1995, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land 2&quot;, which incorporated the copy mechanic from &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot;.

Kirby and King Dedede appear as playable characters in the fighting game series &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; Both characters have alternate costumes that give them a monochrome appearance reminiscent of the Game Boy&#x27;s graphics. The &quot;Green Greens&quot; stage, first appearing in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee,&quot; is based on this game&#x27;s first level. The &quot;Dream Land GB&quot; stage, introduced in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot;, transitions between multiple locations from &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; as displayed through a monochromatic Game Boy screen.

<text>This is a partial list of entertainment venues in London, England.

==Theatres==
The majority of London&#x27;s commercial &quot;theatre land&quot; is situated around Shaftesbury Avenue, the Strand and nearby streets in the West End.

(See the article &quot;West End theatre&quot;, and see also Theatre companies in London).

===Former theatres===

The List of English Renaissance theatres covers the period from the establishment of the first Tudor theatres, through to their suppression by parliament at the beginning of the English Civil War.

The List of Former theatres in London covers the period from the reopening of the playhouses after the English Restoration through to the 21st century. It includes music halls.

==Opera, ballet and dance==
The two main opera houses are:
*Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (the home of The Royal Opera and The Royal Ballet)
*London Coliseum, Charing Cross (the home of English National Opera and English National Ballet)
Both of the above also stage ballet. Holland Park Opera stages opera at an outdoor venue in the summer. Several of the theatres listed have staged opera in the past, including the following:

<text>The president of Cuba (), officially the president of the Republic of Cuba (), is the head of state of Cuba. The office in its current form was established under the Constitution of 2019. The President is the second-highest office in Cuba and the highest state office. Miguel Díaz-Canel became President of the Council of State on 19 April 2018, taking over from Raúl Castro, and has been President of Cuba since 10 October 2019.

The First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba continues to be the highest-ranking political position in Cuba. Fidel Castro held the position from 1976 to 2011, and Raúl Castro from 2011 until the 8th Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba, held 16–19 April 2021, when he retired from office.

==History==
Under the 1901 constitution, Cuba had a presidential system based on that of the United States.

In 1940, a new constitution reformed the government into a semi-presidential system.

On 2 December 1976, the executive was reformed again by a new national constitution, this time in emulation of the Soviet Union. The presidential office was abolished and replaced by a collective head of state, the Council of State, elected by the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power. However, unlike the USSR&#x27;s arrangements, where the chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and 
the Council of Ministers were distinct posts, the chairman of the Council of State also chaired the Council of Ministers. Furthermore, unlike English and Russian, Spanish does not distinguish between the terms &quot;chairman&quot; () and &quot;president&quot; (), translating both as &quot;Presidente&quot;. Thus, when back-translated into English, the term used was not &quot;Chairman&quot; (on the precedent of similar institutions in countries whose languages have a chairman/president distinction, such as the USSR and East Germany), but rather &quot;President&quot;, from the shared etymology with the Spanish &quot;Presidente&quot;.

On 24 February 2019, another constitution – Cuba&#x27;s current – was adopted in a referendum. Under it, the government was again re-organized, and the posts of President and Prime Minister were restored. This reorganization took effect on 11 October 2019. Díaz-Canel was President of the Council of State until 10 October 2019 and President of the Republic after that date. Under the new constitution, the position of President of the Council of State continues as a separate role, subordinate to President of the Republic. The new document also limited the President to two consecutive five-year terms.

In cases of the absence, illness or death of the President of Cuba, the Vice President assumes the presidential duties.

==Powers==
The President of Cuba is mandated to have the following powers as per the Constitution:
# Propose to the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power, once elected by that body, the Prime Minister of Cuba and the members of the Council of Ministers;
# Accept (based on personal preference) the resignation of the Prime Minister and members of the Council of Ministers or propose either to the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power or the Council of State the replacement of any of those members and, in both cases, to propose the corresponding substitutes;
# Receive the credentials of the heads of delegation of foreign diplomatic missions. This responsibility may be delegated to any of the Vice Presidents of the Council of State;
# Assume the supreme command of all armed forces and determine their general organization;
# Preside over the National Defense Council;
# Declare a state emergency in those cases provided for in this Constitution, stating his decision, as soon as the circumstances permit it, to the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power or to the Council of State if the Assembly is unable to meet, according to legal effects;
# Sign decree-laws and other resolutions of the Council of State and the legal provisions adopted by the Council of Ministers or its executive committee, and arrange for their publication in the Official Gazette of the Republic;
# Assume all other duties assigned by the Constitution or by the laws of the Republic to him or her.

The Transitional Presidential Council has been exercising the powers of the presidency since 25 April 2024. It has a mandate to act that concludes on 7 February 2026.

==Term and election==
A number of qualifications for the presidency are specified by Chapter III, Section A (Articles 134 and 135) of the 1987 Constitution of Haiti.

The president is elected to a five-year term by popular vote. The president may not be elected to consecutive terms; they may serve a second term only after an interval of five years, and can not run for a third term.

To be elected president, a candidate must:
# be a native-born Haitian and never have renounced nationality;
# be 35 years old by election day;
# enjoy civil and political rights, and not have been sentenced to death, penal servitude, or the loss of civil rights for a crime;
# be the owner of real property and have one&#x27;s habitual residence in the country;
# reside in the country at least 5 years before election day;
# have been discharged of responsibilities if he previously handled public funds.

Elections are held on the last Sunday in November in the fifth year of a president&#x27;s term. However, in actuality Election Day is not fixed, per the election held in 2015. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote, a runoff is held between the top two candidates. The runoff candidate with the highest number of votes becomes president.

Each presidential term is supposed to begin and end on the February 7 immediately following the last presidential election. However, this has not always been observed, as when Michel Martelly became president on May 11, 2011. 

Since 1950, the President is elected by universal suffrage of all citizens. Previously, civilian presidents were elected by the Chamber of Deputies.

==Duties and powers==
Other qualifications for the presidency are specified by Articles 136 to 147, part of Chapter III, Section B of the 1987 Constitution. The president has no powers except those accorded to him in the Constitution.

The Constitution mandates that the president see to:

# respect for and enforcement of the Constitution and the stability of government institutions;
# regular operations of public entities;
# the continuity of the State;; and
# the nation&#x27;s independence and the integrity of its territory.

When there exists a majority in Parliament in favor of a new government, the President must choose a prime minister from the majority party; otherwise, he chooses one after consultation with the two houses of Parliament. In either case, the choice must then be ratified by Parliament. The president terminates the duties of the prime minister when the Government resigns.

The president declares war and negotiates and signs peace treaties with the approval of the National Assembly, and signs all international treaties, conventions, and agreements, submitting them to the National Assembly for ratification. The president also accredits ambassadors and special envoys to foreign nations, receives letters of accreditation from ambassadors of foreign powers, and issues exequaturs to recognize consuls.

With the approval of the Senate, the president appoints the generalissimo of the Haitian armed forces and of the Haitian police forces, as well as Haiti&#x27;s ambassadors and consuls to foreign states. The president is himself the commander-in-chief of the armed services.

With the approval of the Council of Ministers, the president appoints the directors-general of the civil service, as well as delegates and vice-delegates of various departments and arrondissements. 

The president ratifies laws, and has the right to choose between ratifying a law or not. 

The president may reduce or commute sentences in all &quot;res judicata&quot; cases, except ones imposed by Supreme Court judges. The president, however, may not grant amnesty to non-political prisoners.

==Residence==
The National Palace in the capital Port-au-Prince served as the official residence of the president of Haiti, but was severely damaged in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and was demolished in 2012. In place of the National Palace, President Moise used his home at Pelerin 5 in Pétion-Ville as a temporary presidential palace before relocating to another home in the Juventas area.

==Line of succession==
Under the 1987 constitution, the presidential line of succession went first to the president of the Supreme Court of Haiti, then to the vice-president of the court, and then to puisne judges in order of seniority. An election for president was required within three months of a vacancy occurring, and the acting president could not run for the office. This provision was amended in 2011–2012 to remove all judges from the presidential line of succession, instead designating the Council of Ministers, under the Presidency of the prime minister (Article 149 of the Haitian Constitution).

<text>(,&quot;The Fair Maid of the Mill&quot;, Op. 25, D. 795), is a song cycle by Franz Schubert from 1823 based on 20 poems by Wilhelm Müller. It is the first of Schubert&#x27;s two seminal cycles (preceding &quot;Winterreise&quot;)&quot;,&quot; and a pinnacle of &quot;Lied&quot; repertoire.

&quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; is performed by a pianist and a solo singer. The vocal part falls in the range of a tenor or soprano voice, but is often sung by other voices, transposed to a lower range, a precedent established by Schubert himself. Since the protagonist is a young man, performances by women&#x27;s voices are less common. The piano part bears much of the expressive burden of the work, and is only seldom a mere &#x27;accompaniment&#x27; to the singer. A typical performance lasts around sixty to seventy minutes.

==Composition==
Müller published twenty-five poems in the first fascicule (1821) of &quot;Sieben und siebzig Gedichten aus den nachgelassenen Papieren eines reisenden Waldhornisten&quot; (Seventy-seven Poems from the Posthumous Papers of an Itinerant Hornist&quot;). They arose from his unrequited passion for Luise Hensel, herself a poet as well as sister in law to Fanny Hensel and Felix Mendelssohn.

Schubert set twenty of them to music between May and September 1823, while he was also writing his opera &quot;Fierrabras&quot;. He was 26 years old at the time. Schubert omitted five of the poems, such as a prologue and an epilogue delivered by the poet. The work was published in 1824 by the firm of Sauer and Leidesdorf as Op. 25 under the title &quot;Die schöne Müllerin, ein Zyklus von Liedern, gedichtet von Wilhelm Müller&quot; (The Lovely Maid of the Mill, a song cycle to poems by Wilhelm Müller) and was dedicated to the singer . The omitted poems were a &quot;Prolog&quot;, &quot;Das Mühlenleben&quot; (following Nr. 6), &quot;Erster Schmerz, letzter Scherz&quot; (following Nr. 15), &quot;Blümlein Vergißmein&quot; (following Nr. 17) and &quot;Epilog&quot;.

==Narrative==

There are twenty songs in the cycle, around half in simple strophic form, and they move from cheerful optimism to despair and tragedy.
At the beginning of the cycle, a young journeyman miller wanders happily through the countryside. He comes upon a brook, which he follows to a mill. He falls in love with the miller&#x27;s beautiful daughter (the &quot;Müllerin&quot; of the title). She is out of his reach as he is only a journeyman. He tries to impress her, but her response seems tentative. The young man is soon supplanted in her affections by a hunter clad in green, the color of a ribbon he gave the girl. In his anguish, he experiences an obsession with the color green, then an extravagant death fantasy in which flowers sprout from his grave to express his undying love. (See Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Adelaide&quot; for a similar fantasy.) In the end, the young man despairs and presumably drowns himself in the brook. The last number is a lullaby sung by the brook.

==Editions==

The Diabelli edition of 1830 in a facsimile score, with notes by Walther Dürr, was published (1996) by Bärenreiter. The version in most common use is the Peters Edition, edited by Max Friedlaender, and in this and several other editions (e.g. Schirmer) the cycle is presented as the first 20 songs of Volume 1. There are versions in the original (high) keys, and transposed alternatives for lower voices. The Peters edition was revised by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Elmar Budde, and is available as Volume 1 of the Peters Urtext Edition, available in high, medium and low key versions. The most recent scholarly edition is in the New Schubert Edition, again edited by Walther Dürr and published by Bärenreiter, and contains transposed versions for lower voices.

Six of the songs were transcribed for solo piano by Franz Liszt and published as &quot;Müllerlieder&quot;.

==Synopsis==

#&quot;Das Wandern&quot; (&quot;Wandering&quot;; B major): &quot;Wandering is the miller&#x27;s joy&quot; – a journeyman Miller happily travels through the countryside, singing of the restless water, millstones, and millwheels of his trade. This is a classic example of strophic song, in which the accompaniment is traditionally made to imitate the various objects about which the Miller sings. Schubert facilitates this with characteristically elegant and inventive piano writing; despite its simplicity, the music contains elements readily receptive to this imitative treatment, with the flowing cyclical broken triads evocative of both wheels and water, and the bass octaves pounding away. The composer continues this illustrative style throughout the cycle, with various recurring motifs. By far the most important of these, the Brook, is a character of its own represented by the piano, and appears next.
#&quot;Wohin?&quot; (&quot;Where to?&quot;; G major): &quot;Is this my path then? Oh tell me, brook, where to?&quot; – the Miller fatefully comes across a Brook, and is captivated into following it. Through-composed, the piano imitates the babbling brook with a rippling pattern. This figuration, a first-inversion broken triad circling back on itself, goes on to represent the Brook almost exclusively throughout the cycle.
#&quot;Halt!&quot; (&quot;Stop!&quot;; C major): &quot;Dear little Brook, is this what you meant?&quot; – the Brook leads the Miller to an idyllic mill in a forest grove. Through-composed, the piano imitates the vigorous turning of the mill wheel. Subtle diminished and minor harmonies in the accompaniment hint at foreboding.
#&quot;Danksagung an den Bach&quot; (&quot;Thanksgiving to the Brook&quot;; G major): &quot;Did &quot;she&quot; send you? Or have you enchanted me?&quot; – The grateful Miller thanks the Brook for providing work for his hands and his heart – the latter in the form of the beautiful maid of the mill, the Müllerin of the title. Through-composed, with a contemplative broken chord pattern in the accompaniment, and a section in parallel minor as the Miller questions the nature of the Brook&#x27;s guidance.
#&quot;Am Feierabend&quot; (&quot;Evening&#x27;s Rest&quot;; A minor): &quot;If only I could move the millstones alone! Then the beautiful maiden would know my true purpose!&quot; – the Miller is troubled when the Maiden wishes a good night to all the men, paying him no particular attention; he aches to distinguish himself from his peers. The piano channels the millworks in this through-composed song, with the up-and-down arpeggio from &quot;Halt!&quot; again representing the wheel and pounding bass evoking the stones. Highly contrasting static music in the central section captures the restful after-work setting of the otherwise incongruous title. This is an energetic high point of the first section, and the one entry in the cycle in which the protagonist actually sings the phrase &quot;die schöne Mullerin&quot;.
#&quot;Der Neugierige&quot; (&quot;The Inquirer&quot;; B major): &quot;Tell me, little Brook – does she love me?&quot; – he asks the enigmatic brook whether the Maiden loves him – Yes or No – between these two words lies his entire world. An expressive through-composed song opening with a cleverly executed musical question in the accompaniment – a rising pattern ending on a diminished chord. A slow, contemplative second section follows as the Miller interrogates the Brook, represented as always by its flowing broken triads.
#&quot;Ungeduld&quot; (&quot;Impatience&quot;; A major): &quot;My heart is yours, and it will be forever!&quot; – he wishes he could carve his love into every tree, have every bird sing of it, have the wind tell of it. A strophic song in which a busy, restless repeated chord pattern in the accompaniment, crowded with ornaments, reflects the Miller&#x27;s agitated state.
#&quot;Morgengruß&quot; (&quot;Morning Greeting&quot;; C major): &quot;Does my greeting displease you so?&quot; – the Miller is troubled by the Maiden&#x27;s cool reaction to his morning greeting. Nonetheless, his optimism is intact – he will just wait outside her window. A ballad in strophic form that progressively gathers expressive energy as the metric subdivision increases over each stanza, the Miller&#x27;s infatuation swelling.
#&quot;Des Müllers Blumen&quot; (&quot;The Miller&#x27;s Flowers&quot;; A major): &quot;The flowers will whisper to her as in a dream: forget me not!&quot; – the Miller indulges in a poetic metaphor between the blue flowers beside the brook and the Maiden&#x27;s blue eyes. The Miller&#x27;s outpouring is matched with a lyrical arpeggio pattern and gently rocking 6/8 rhythm in this strophic song. An accepted performance convention places the third strophe, concerning dreams, an octave higher in the accompaniment. There is no explicitly indicated outro music, which is unusual in Schubert, but accompanists often choose to simply repeat the introduction. Regardless of this choice, the ending segues into the next song, in the same key.
#&quot;Tränenregen&quot; (&quot;Rain of Tears&quot;; A major): &quot;She said: &#x27;A rain is coming – farewell, I&#x27;m going home&#x27;&quot; – the Miller and Maiden share a tender moment by the Brook – the three principal characters in one place. The Miller cannot bring himself to look at her, and stares into the Brook at the moon and her reflection. As his tears ripple in the water, she abruptly leaves. Augmented harmonies and lyrical, flowing counterpoint in the accompaniment again imitate the brook and add to the nocturne atmosphere. The form is primarily strophic, with a shadowy coda in the parallel minor as the Maiden takes her leave.
#&quot;Mein!&quot; (&quot;Mine!&quot;; D major): &quot;Are these all the flowers you have, spring? Can you not shine brighter, sun? The beloved Millermaid is mine! Mine!&quot; – the ecstatic Miller is convinced he possesses the Maiden, despite heretofore dubious encouragement. A brash, heavy-handed, low register accompaniment in broken chords captures the Miller&#x27;s manic and effusive machismo, and the vocal line features athletic melisma in nearly every bar. In a near-comical fortissimo flourish, a deliberately muddy fully voiced D major chord closes the first half of the work.
#&quot;Pause&quot; (&quot;Interlude&quot;; B major): &quot;Is it the echo of my love&#x27;s pain? Or the prelude to new songs?&quot; – the Miller, his heart too full to sing, hangs his lute on the wall with a green ribbon and reflects on the heavy burden of happiness. He muses anxiously whether the stirrings of his lute are ominous. Through-composed, a repetitive lute-like motif and static harmony in the accompaniment create the interlude atmosphere. Dissonant minor harmonies reflect the Miller&#x27;s misgivings before they are shrugged off in the outro.
#&quot;Mit dem grünen Lautenbande&quot; (&quot;With the Green Lute-Ribbon&quot;; B major): &quot;Wind the green ribbon into your locks, since you like green so much!&quot; – the Maiden mentions she likes green, and the Miller is happy to oblige, giving her the ribbon as a symbol of their evergreen love. He tries to convince himself that he too likes green, though he is white with flour. Strophic, in short verses with flourishes idiomatic of the lute, the saccharine melody and accompaniment reflect the Miller&#x27;s deluded optimism.
#&quot;Der Jäger&quot; (&quot;The Hunter&quot;; C minor): &quot;There is no game here for you to hunt! Only a doe, a tame one, for me!&quot; – a rough and dashing Hunter clad in green arrives at the mill; the Miller is immediately disturbed by this romantic rival and spirals into a jealous diatribe. The vocal line is extremely dense and the delivery deliberately rushed in the manner of a patter song. In strophic form, the piano imitates hunting horns with a standard idiomatic chord pattern (see Der Lindenbaum from Winterreise, etc.) in a brash staccato 6/8 rhythm. The key changes rapidly between C minor and its relative major E major. This song is a turning point, marking the beginning of the Miller&#x27;s descent into tragedy. 
#&quot;Eifersucht und Stolz&quot; (&quot;Jealousy and Pride&quot;; G minor): &quot;Where to so fast and wild, dear brook? Turn back, and scold your maiden!&quot; – the Miller desperately compels the Brook to admonish the fickle Maiden, who has been flirting with the Hunter. Through-composed, the agitated broken-chord accompaniment imitates the now-raging Brook, with a central section again imitating hunting horns.
#&quot;Die liebe Farbe&quot; (&quot;The Beloved Colour&quot;; B minor): &quot;Dig me a grave in the green meadow, cover me with green turf, my sweetheart likes green so much&quot; – the catatonic Miller obsesses miserably over green, the color of his love and his pain. An ostinato F in sixteenth notes, repeated over 500 times in the accompaniment across the strophic verses, reflects the Miller&#x27;s tortured fixation and the monotony of the constant refrain. The sparse accompaniment follows the voice melody in lower harmony as it maintains the ostinato. Ironically, and most likely deliberately, the strophic verse structure and vocal line rhythm is identical to the cheerful &quot;Mit dem grünen Lautenbande&quot;; the lyrics for either song could be readily substituted over one another&#x27;s accompaniment, despite their vast contrast in character and content.
#&quot;Die böse Farbe&quot; (&quot;The Hateful Colour&quot;; B major): &quot;Oh green, you hateful color you! So proud, so mocking, so pleased with my pain!&quot; – the Miller bitterly and defiantly renounces the color green. He wishes only to take the Maiden&#x27;s hand one last time to say farewell. In a through-composed rondo form, with an operatic scale of sound, the bold accompaniment again includes a hunting horn imitation in the second episode. In the parallel major of the preceding song, the two are an opposed pair.
#&quot;Trockne Blumen&quot; (&quot;Withered Flowers&quot;; E minor): &quot;And when she passes my grave, she will think &#x27;He was true to me!&#x27;&quot; – in an elaborate death fantasy, the Miller wishes to be buried with now-withered flowers the Maiden had given him. When she sees this, she will know his heart was faithful; the flowers will bloom again and thus his winter will have passed. Through-composed, the accompaniment at first represents the withered flowers with a minimalist series of simple chords – as the flowers bloom, the music becomes more lyrical, and the harmony and rhythm more intricate.
#&quot;Der Müller und der Bach&quot; (&quot;The Miller and the Brook&quot;; G minor): &quot;Oh dear little brook, you mean so well – but do you know what love does to you?&quot; The hopeless Miller turns to the Brook in his heartbreak. The Brook answers with comforting and poetic words of love conquering pain. Resigned and exhausted, the Miller submits himself to the Brook&#x27;s &#x27;cool rest&#x27;. Through-composed, the gently rocking barcarolle-like accompaniment gives way to a broken chord pattern similar to that of &quot;Wohin,&quot; imitating the Brook and confirming a leitmotif of sorts as this character speaks for the first time. The notable use of Neapolitan chords in this song is one of many examples of chromatic substitution used liberally throughout the cycle, aptly illustrating in this case the languid resignation of the protagonist as the minor second sinks to the tonic. The outro sees the piano descend peacefully to a final major chord as the Miller meets his fate.
#&quot;Des Baches Wiegenlied&quot; (&quot;The Brook&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;; E major): – &quot;Rest well, rest well, close your eyes. Wanderer, you weary one, you are at home.&quot; the Brook, who has always shown the Miller the constancy he so desired, sings him to sleep, scolding the Maiden not to disturb him. A placid and relaxed strophic song, this idiomatic lullaby is by a considerable margin the longest entry in the cycle. The choice of E major, a tritone removed from the opening song, signifies the vast narrative distance covered by the cycle. &quot;And heaven above, how vast it is!&quot;

<doc id="516067" wikidata="Q48635" url="?curid=516067" title="Bandgap voltage reference">
<text>A bandgap voltage reference is a voltage reference circuit widely used in integrated circuits. It produces an almost constant voltage corresponding to the particular semiconductor&#x27;s theoretical band gap, with very little fluctuations from variations of power supply, electrical load, time, temperature (, they typically have an initial error of 0.5–1.0% and a temperature coefficient of 25–50 ppm/°C).

David Hilbiber of Fairchild Semiconductor filed a patent in 1963 and published this circuit concept in 1964. Bob Widlar, Paul Brokaw and others followed up with other commercially-successful versions.

==Operation==
The voltage difference between two p–n junctions (e.g. diodes), operated at different current densities, is used to generate a current that is &quot;proportional to absolute temperature&quot; (&quot;PTAT&quot;) in a resistor. This current is used to generate a voltage in a second resistor. This voltage in turn is added to the voltage of one of the junctions (or a third one, in some implementations). The voltage across a diode operated at constant current is &quot;complementary to absolute temperature&quot; (&quot;CTAT&quot;), with a temperature coefficient of approximately −2mV/K. If the ratio between the first and second resistor is chosen properly, the first order effects of the temperature dependency of the diode and the PTAT current will cancel out.

Although silicon&#x27;s (Si) band gap at 0K is technically 1.165eV, the circuit essentially linearly extrapolates the bandgap–temperature curve to determine a slightly higher but precise reference around 1.2–1.3V (the specific value depends on the particular technology and circuit design); the remaining voltage change over the operating temperature of typical integrated circuits is on the order of a few millivolts. This temperature dependency has a typical parabolic residual behavior since the linear (first order) effects are chosen to cancel.

Because the output voltage is by definition fixed around 1.25V for typical Si bandgap reference circuits, the minimum operating voltage is about 1.4V, as in a CMOS circuit at least one drain-source voltage of a field-effect transistor (FET) has to be added. Therefore, recent work concentrates on finding alternative solutions, in which for example currents are summed instead of voltages, resulting in a lower theoretical limit for the operating voltage.

The first letter of the acronym, CTAT, is sometimes misconstrued to represent &quot;constant&quot; rather than &quot;complementary&quot;. The term, &quot;constant with temperature&quot; (&quot;CWT&quot;), exists to address this confusion, but is not in widespread use.

When summing a PTAT and a CTAT current, only the linear terms of current are compensated, while the higher-order terms are limiting the temperature drift (TD) of the bandgap reference at around 20ppm/°C, over a temperature range of 100°C. For this reason, in 2001, Malcovati designed a circuit topology that can compensate high-order non-linearities, thus achieving an improved TD. This design used an improved version of Banba&#x27;s topology and an analysis of base-emitter temperature effects that was performed by Tsividis in 1980. In 2012, Andreou has further improved the high-order non-linear compensation by using a second operational amplifier along with an additional resistor leg at the point where the two currents are summed up. This method enhanced further the curvature correction and achieved superior TD performance over a wider temperature range. In addition it achieved improved line regulation and lower noise.

The other critical issue in design of bandgap references is power efficiency and size of circuit. As a bandgap reference is generally based on BJT devices and resistors, the total size of circuit could be large and therefore expensive for IC design. Moreover, this type of circuit might consume a lot of power to reach to the desired noise and precision specification.

Despite these limitations, the band gap voltage reference is widely used in voltage regulators, covering the majority of 78xx, 79xx devices along with the TL431 and the complementary LM317 and LM337. Temperature coefficients as low as 1.5–2.0ppm/°C can be obtained with bandgap references. However, the parabolic characteristic of voltage versus temperature means that a single figure in ppm/°C does not adequately describe the behavior of the circuit. Manufacturers&#x27; data sheets show that the temperature at which the peak (or trough) of the voltage curve occurs is subject to normal sample variations in production. Bandgap references are also suited for low-power applications.

Mixed-signal microcontrollers may provide an internal bandgap reference signal to be used as reference for any internal comparator(s) and analog-to-digital converter(s).

<doc id="516070" wikidata="Q3890355" url="?curid=516070" title="Discretization error">
<text>In numerical analysis, computational physics, and simulation, discretization error is the error resulting from the fact that a function of a continuous variable is represented in the computer by a finite number of evaluations, for example, on a lattice. Discretization error can usually be reduced by using a more finely spaced lattice, with an increased computational cost.

==Examples==
Discretization error is the principal source of error in methods of finite differences and the pseudo-spectral method of computational physics.

When we define the derivative of formula_1 as formula_2 or formula_3, where formula_4 is a finitely small number, the difference between the first formula and this approximation is known as discretization error.

==Related phenomena==
In signal processing, the analog of discretization is sampling, and results in no loss if the conditions of the sampling theorem are satisfied, otherwise the resulting error is called aliasing.

Discretization error, which arises from finite resolution in the &quot;domain,&quot; should not be confused with quantization error, which is finite resolution in the &quot;range&quot; (values), nor in round-off error arising from floating-point arithmetic. Discretization error would occur even if it were possible to represent the values exactly and use exact arithmetic – it is the error from representing a function by its values at a discrete set of points, not an error in these values.

<text>The Blue River is a tributary of the Colorado River, approximately long, in the U.S. state of Colorado.

It rises in southern Summit County, on the western side of the continental divide in the Ten Mile Range, near Quandary Peak. It flows northwards past Blue River and Breckenridge, then through the Dillon Reservoir near Dillon. The west portal for the &quot;Roberts Tunnel&quot; is at the base of Dillon Reservoir. The Roberts Tunnel is a trans-basin diversion, built by Denver Water in 1962, that diverts water under the Continental Divide from the Colorado River basin into the South Platte River Basin. The east portal is approximately one mile upstream of Grant, Colorado.

North of Dillon, the river flows north-northwest along the eastern slope of the Gore Range and joins the Colorado River at Kremmling.

The Green Mountain Dam, upstream from Kremmling, forms the Green Mountain Reservoir, providing hydroelectric power and diversionary water for irrigation, as part of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project. The dam is a project of the United States Bureau of Reclamation.

<doc id="516079" wikidata="Q5009282" url="?curid=516079" title="CBS Television Quiz">
<text>CBS Television Quiz is an American game show, running from July 2, 1941, to January 7, 1943, on the CBS television station in New York, WCBW Channel 2 (the forerunner of WCBS-TV). It was the first game show to be broadcast regularly on television. It was an in-house production and broadcast in black-and-white. The host was Gil Fates, with Frances Buss as scorekeeper.

==Game play==
The &quot;CBS Television Quiz&quot; followed an answer-and-question format: contestants were given a clue and were asked to provide a question that the clue would answer. Beyond this, little is known about the show&#x27;s mechanics.

The game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; would later use a similar answer-and-question conceit. &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; is known to differ from the &quot;CBS Television Quiz&quot; in its use of lockout buzzers, which had not yet been invented in 1941 (the first game show to use them was 1946&#x27;s &quot;Winner Take All&quot;). Whether Julann Wright Griffin, whom Merv Griffin credited with creating the concept, knew of the &quot;CBS Television Quiz&quot; remains an open question.

==Broadcast history==
Televised game shows prior to the debut of &quot;CBS Television Quiz&quot; were &quot;test episodes&quot; for experimental purposes; one of these was &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; (NBC Radio, July 1, 1941), while a show called &quot;Spelling Bee&quot; was broadcast (BBC, 1938). &quot;Quiz&quot; was the first regularly scheduled quiz program, but not the first to be sponsored, and aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 PM EST.

On October 2, the series moved to Thursdays, and on January 8 the show was reduced to 55 minutes for the network to present a five-minute news summary at 9:25 PM. &quot;Quiz&quot; moved to Mondays on February 2 and was now preceded by a civilian-defense program (later an American Red Cross program), which along with the news summary required the show itself to decrease to 50 minutes. The Red Cross program ended on March 30, allowing &quot;Quiz&quot; to re-expand to 55 minutes. After WCBW scaled back their programing at the end of May 1942 following a mandate several weeks earlier by the War Production Board to cease building television stations, &quot;Quiz&quot; moved to Thursdays and Fridays and was again reduced to 50 minutes.

The series ended on January 7, 1943, the day before WCBW temporarily shut down its studios and reverted to broadcasting only filmed material on an irregular basis until May 1944.

Fates would later produce and/or direct many Goodson-Todman game shows on the network (most notably &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;), while Buss (later Frances Buss Buch) became CBS&#x27; first female director.

<text>The president of the Republic of Malawi () is the head of state and head of government of Malawi. The president leads the executive branch of the Government of Malawi and is the commander-in-chief of the Malawian Defence Force. The current president is Lazarus Chakwera, who has served since being elected in June 2020.

==Executive branch==

Under the 1995 constitution, the president, who is both head of state and head of government, is chosen through universal direct suffrage every five years. Malawi has a vice-president who is elected with the president. The president has the option of appointing a second vice-president, who must be from a different party. It also includes a presidentially appointed cabinet. The members of the cabinet of Malawi can be drawn from either within or outside of the legislature. The President is also concurrently the Minister of Defence.

The current president is Lazarus Chakwera sworn in as president of Malawi on 28 June 2020.

==Origins of the presidency==

On 6 July 1964, Nyasaland became independent from British rule and renamed itself Malawi, with Elizabeth II as Queen of Malawi. Under a new constitution in 1966, Malawi became a republic with prime minister Hastings Banda becoming its first president. Under the country&#x27;s 1966, 1994 and 1995 constitutions, the president is executive head of state and government, and serves a five-year term. The first president, Banda, was elected by the National Assembly, and was named president for life in 1971. Subsequent presidents have been popularly elected. 

After the restoration of multiparty democracy in 1993, the presidency was hedged about with a number of checks and balances to prevent its total dominance over the political system.

==Election to the presidency==

The president is elected by a majority vote (50% + 1) of the electorate through direct, universal and equal suffrage. All Malawian citizens that have attained the age of 18 are eligible to vote in all elections. Every presidential candidate shall declare who shall be the vice-president if elected at the time of the candidate&#x27;s nomination. The vice-president shall be elected concurrently with the president, with both names on the ballot.

==Term limits==
As of 2021, the Constitution of Malawi limits a president to two consecutive five-year terms. There was an attempt to modify the term limits in 2003 for Bakili Muluzi, but it did not materialize.

<text>The president of Nigeria, officially the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is the head of state and head of government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The president directs the executive branch of the Federal Government and is the commander-in-chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces.

The offices, powers, and titles of the head of state and the head of government were officially merged into the office of the presidency under the 1979 Constitution of Nigeria.

Executive power is vested in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers. Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by the House, the presidency has primary responsibility for conducting foreign policy.

The president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of separation of powers, the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. Presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policy making is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections.

The president is directly elected in national elections to a four-year term, along with the vice president.

Bola Tinubu is the 16th and current president of Nigeria, having assumed office on 29 May 2023.

==History==

=== Ceremonial presidency and the First Republic (1963–1966) ===
On 1 October 1960, Nigeria gained independence from Britain. An all-Nigerian Executive Council was headed by the prime minister, Alhaji Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. On 16 November 1960, Nnamdi Azikiwe became the first governor-general of a federation of three regions of the north, east and west, with Lagos as the Federal Capital. Each of the regions was headed by a premier with a governor as ceremonial head. The governors and governor-general represented the queen of Nigeria, Elizabeth II. On 1 October 1963, Nigeria became a Federal republic thereby abolishing its monarchy, but remained a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. An amendment to the 1960 Independence Constitution replaced the office of the governor-general with that of the president. Nnamdi Azikwe was sworn into that office on 1 October 1963. The office at that time was primarily ceremonial, and the main duties of the president were on such things as receiving foreign dignitaries and opening Parliament.

=== Military rule (1966–1979) ===
In a January 1966 failed coup d&#x27;état, a group of army officers, led by Major Chukwuma Nzeogwu, overthrew the federal and regional governments, killed the prime minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, and tried to take control of the government. Nzeogwu was countered, captured, and imprisoned by the Army general officer commanding Major General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi. Aguiyi-Ironsi was named Military Head of State.

In July 1966, a group of northern army officers revolted against the government, killed General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, and appointed the army chief of staff, Lieutenant Colonel Yakubu Gowon as the head of the new military government.

In 1975, General Yakubu Gowon was deposed and Brigadier Murtala Mohammed was made head of the Federal Military Government of Nigeria until his assassination in 1976. Upon his death, the chief-of-staff, Supreme Headquarters (equivalent to a vice president) General Olusegun Obasanjo assumed office as head of state in a meeting of the Supreme Military Council, keeping the chain of command established by General Murtala Muhammed in place. General Obasanjo was responsible for completing the democratic transition begun by his predecessor, which culminated in an election in August 1979.

In 1979, Nigeria adopted a federal presidential constitution. The presidency became an executive post, with powers similar to those of its American counterpart. The legislature was a bicameral National Assembly, comprising a Senate and House of Representatives.

=== Second Republic (1979–1983) ===
On 1 October 1979, after more than 13 years of military rule, Nigeria returned to democratic rule. The National Party of Nigeria emerged victorious in the presidential election and Shehu Shagari became the first democratically elected president.

=== Military rule (1983–1999) ===
On 31 December 1983, the military overthrew the Second Republic. Major General Muhammadu Buhari emerged as the chairman of the Supreme Military Council (SMC), the new head of state.

In August 1985, General Buhari&#x27;s government was peacefully overthrown by the Army chief of staff, Major General Ibrahim Babangida. Babangida became the president and chairman of the Armed Forces Ruling Council.

On 26 August 1993, General Babangida stepped down and chose an interim government to replace him. Ernest Shonekan was named as interim head of state. General Sani Abacha seized power from Shonekan on 17 November 1993, and became head of state and chairman of the Provisional Ruling Council.

On 8 June 1998, General Abacha died at the presidential villa in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. Major General Abdulsalami Abubakar became the new head of state and chairman of the Provisional Ruling Council.

=== Fourth Republic (1999–present) ===
On 29 May 1999, General Abdulsalami Abubakar stepped down, and handed over power to a former military head of state, Olusegun Obasanjo, after being elected some months prior. Obasanjo served two terms in office.

On 29 May 2007, Umaru Musa Yar&#x27;Adua was sworn in as president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the 13th head of state completing the first successful transition of power, from one democratically elected president to another in Nigeria. Yar&#x27;Adua died on 5 May 2010 at the presidential villa, in Abuja, Nigeria, becoming the second head of state to die there after General Sani Abacha.

On 6 May 2010, Vice President Goodluck Jonathan was sworn in as president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the 14th head of state.

On 29 May 2015, Muhammadu Buhari, a former military head of state was sworn in as president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the 15th head of state after winning the general election. He also served two terms in office.

On 29 May 2023, Bola Tinubu was sworn in as president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the 16th head of state after winning the 2023 Nigerian general election.

== Selection process ==

=== Electoral system ===
The president of Nigeria is elected using a modified two-round system with up to three rounds. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive a plurality of the votes, as well as over 25% of the vote in at least 24 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. If no candidate passes this threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a majority of votes in the highest number of states. In the second round, a candidate still must receive the most votes, as well as over 25% of the vote in at least 24 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory in order to be elected. If neither candidate passes this threshold, a third round will be held, where a simple majority of the votes is required to be elected.

<text>Ceanothus is a genus of about 50–60 species of nitrogen-fixing shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae). Common names for members of this genus are buckbrush, California lilac, soap bush, or just ceanothus. &quot;Ceanothus&quot; comes from (&quot;keanōthos&quot;), which was applied by Theophrastus (371–287 BC) to an Old World plant believed to be &quot;Cirsium arvense&quot;.

The genus is native to North America with the highest diversity on the western coast. Some species (e.g., &quot;C. americanus&quot;) are restricted to the eastern United States and southeast Canada, and others (e.g., &quot;C. caeruleus&quot;) extend as far south as Guatemala. Most are shrubs tall, but &quot;C. arboreus&quot; and &quot;C. thyrsiflorus&quot;, both native to California, can be small multi-trunked trees up to tall.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
There are two subgenera within this genus: &quot;Ceanothus&quot; and &quot;Cerastes&quot;. The former clade is less drought-resistant, having bigger leaves. The evolution of these two clades likely started with a divergence in the niches filled in local communities, rather than a divergence on the basis of geography.

The Californian species of &quot;Ceanothus&quot; are commonly known collectively as California lilacs, with individual species having more descriptive common names. Species native elsewhere have other common names such as New Jersey tea for &quot;C. americanus&quot;, as its leaves were used as a black tea substitute during the American Revolution. In garden use, most are simply called by their scientific names or an adaptation of the scientific name, such as &#x27;Maritime ceanothus&#x27; for &quot;C. maritimus&quot;.

==Description==
===Growth pattern===
The majority of the species are evergreen, but the handful of species adapted to cold winters are deciduous. The leaves are opposite or alternate (depending on species), small (typically 1–5 cm long), simple, and mostly with serrated margins.

===Leaves and stems===
Ceanothus leaves may be arranged opposite to each other on the stem, or alternate. Alternate leaves may have either one or three main veins rising from the base of the leaf.

The leaves have a shiny upper surface that feels &quot;gummy&quot; when pinched between the thumb and forefinger, and the roots of most species have red inner root bark.

===Flowers and fruit===

The flowers are white, greenish–white, blue, dark purple-blue, pale purple or pink, maturing into a dry, three-lobed seed capsule.

The flowers are tiny and fragrant and produced in large, dense clusters. A few species are reported to be so intensely fragrant they are almost nauseating, and are said to resemble the odor of &quot;boiling honey in an enclosed area&quot;. The seeds of this plant can lie dormant for hundreds of years, and &quot;Ceanothus&quot; species are typically dependent on forest fires to trigger germination of their seeds.

Fruits are hard, nutlike capsules.

==Distribution==

Plants in this genus are widely distributed and can be found on dry, sunny hillsides from coastal scrub lands to open forest clearings, from near sea level to in elevation. These plants are profusely distributed throughout the Rocky Mountains from British Columbia south through Colorado, the Cascades of Oregon and California, and the Coastal Ranges of California.

&quot;Ceanothus velutinus&quot; is perhaps the most widespread member of this genus, occurring through much of western North America. The plants in this genus often co-occur with one another, especially when they are more distantly related.

==Uses==
===Wildlife===
Ceanothus is a good source of nutrition for deer, specifically mule deer along the West Coast of the United States. However, the leaves are not as nutritious from late spring to early fall as they are in early spring. Porcupines and quail have also been seen eating stems and seeds of these shrubs. The leaves are a good source of protein and the stems and leaves have been found to contain a high amount of calcium.

===Cultivation===
Many &quot;Ceanothus&quot; species are popular ornamental plants for gardens. Dozens of hybrids and cultivars have been selected, such as flexible ceanothus, &quot;Ceanothus × flexilis&quot; (&quot;C. cuneatus&quot; × &quot;C. prostratus&quot;).

=== Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit cultivars===
The following cultivars and hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (): 

*’Autumnal Blue’ 
*&#x27;Blue Mound&#x27; 
*&#x27;Burkwoodii&#x27; 
*&#x27;Cascade&#x27; 
*&#x27;Concha&#x27; 
*&#x27;Dark Star&#x27; 
*&#x27;Gloire de Versailles&#x27; 
*&#x27;Mystery Blue&#x27; 
*&#x27;Perle Rose&#x27; 
*&#x27;Puget Blue&#x27; 
*&#x27;Skylark&#x27; 
*&#x27;Topaze&#x27; 
*&#x27;Trewithen Blue&#x27; 
*&quot;C. thyrsifolius&quot; var. &quot;repens&quot; 
Other cultivars available include:-
There are also more cultivars and hybrids of &quot;Ceanothus arboreus&quot;, &quot;Ceanothus griseus horizontalis&quot; (groundcovers), and &quot;Ceanothus thyrsiflorus&quot; in the nursery trade.

====Propagation====
Propagation of ceanothus is by seed, following scarification and stratification. Seeds are soaked in water for 12 hours followed by chilling at 1 °C for one to three months. It can also sprout from roots and/or stems. Seeds are stored in plant litter in large quantities. It is estimated that there are about two million seeds per acre in forest habitats. Seeds are dispersed propulsively from capsules and, it has been estimated, can remain viable for hundreds of years. In habitat, the seeds of plants in this genus germinate only in response to range fires and forest fires. 

===Other uses===
Native Americans used the dried leaves of this plant as an herbal tea, and early pioneers used the plant as a substitute for black tea. Miwok Indians of California make baskets from Ceanothus branches. &quot;Ceanothus integerrimus&quot; has been used by North American tribes to ease childbirth.

&quot;Ceanothus&quot; is actinorhizal, meaning it fixes nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with &quot;Frankia.&quot; Six genera within Rhamnaceae are actinorhizal, but &quot;Ceanothus&quot; is the only genus not in the monophyletic tribe Colletieae. This suggests that actinorhizal symbiosis may have evolved twice in Rhamnaceae. &quot;Frankia&quot; forms nodules on the roots of &quot;Ceanothus&quot;, converting atmospheric nitrogen () into ammonia () using nitrogenase.

<text>The president of Portugal, officially the president of the Portuguese Republic (, ), is the head of state and highest office of Portugal.

The powers, functions and duties of prior presidential offices, and their relation with the prime minister and cabinets have over time differed with the various Portuguese constitutions. Currently, in the Third Republic, a semi-presidential system, the president holds no direct executive power, unlike his counterparts in the United States and France. However, even though he is in general a ceremonial figure, he holds some powers not that usual in parliamentary systems: one of his most significant responsibilities is the promulgation of all laws enacted by the Assembly of the Republic (parliament) or the Government (an act without which such laws have no legal validity), with an alternative option to veto them (although this veto can be overcome in the case of laws approved by Parliament) or send them to the Constitutional Court for appreciation of whether they violate the Constitution. This and other abilities imply that the president of Portugal does not fit clearly into either of the three traditional powers – legislative, executive and judicial –, acting instead as a sort of &quot;moderating power&quot; among the traditional three.

The current president of Portugal is Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who took office on 9 March 2016.

== Role ==
The Portuguese Third Republic is a semi-presidential system. Despite being a rather ceremonial figure, unlike most European presidents, who are at large ceremonial figures, the Portuguese President is vested with more extensive powers. Although the prime minister and parliament oversee and direct much of Portugal&#x27;s actual governmental affairs, the president wields significant influence and authority, especially in the fields of national security and foreign policy, however, always on the advice of the Government and the approval of Parliament. The president is the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, holds the nation&#x27;s most senior office, and outranks all other politicians.

Prior to the Carnation Revolution, the powers of the presidency varied widely; some presidents were virtual dictators (such as Pais, and Carmona in his early years), while others were little more than figureheads (such as Carmona in his later years, Craveiro Lopes, and Américo Tomás). During the Estado Novo, the president was nominally vested with near-dictatorial powers, but in practice supreme power was held by the President of the Council of Ministers (António de Oliveira Salazar and Marcelo Caetano).

===Government nomination===
The president&#x27;s greatest power is his ability to appoint the prime minister. However, since the Assembly of the Republic has the sole power to dismiss the prime minister&#x27;s government, the prime minister named by the president must have the confidence of a majority of representatives in the assembly, otherwise the prime minister may face a motion of no confidence. The president has the discretionary power to dissolve parliament when he/she sees fit (colloquially known as the &quot;atomic bomb&quot; in Portugal), and President Jorge Sampaio made use of this prerogative in late 2004 to remove the controversial government of Pedro Santana Lopes, despite the absolute majority of deputies supporting the government.

===Armed Forces===
In 2003, President Sampaio also intervened to limit the Portuguese participation in the Iraq War – as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces he forbade the deployment of the Portuguese Army in a war that he personally disagreed with, clashing with the then–prime minister José Manuel Barroso. Because of this, the Government eventually deployed 128 members of the National Republican Guard (GNR) to Iraq from 2003 to 2005, this being possible because the GNR, despite being a military force, was not part of the Armed Forces.

== Powers ==
The constitution grants the following powers to the president:

*The President of the Republic exercises the functions of Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and Grand Master of the Three Orders, and appoints and dismisses, on a proposal from the Government, the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces and the heads of General Staff of the three branches of the Armed Forces.
*The President of the Republic can dissolve the Assembly of the Republic, which implies the need to call new legislative elections and, after these have been held, the resignation of the Government.
*The President of the Republic appoints the Prime Minister taking into account the electoral results and appoints the remaining members of the Government on the proposal of the Prime Minister. The President can, on the other hand, dismiss the Government when this becomes necessary to ensure the regular functioning of democratic institutions.
*The governing bodies of the autonomous regions may be dissolved by the President of the Republic, for carrying out serious acts contrary to the Constitution.
*The President of the Republic declares the state of siege and emergency, after hearing the Government and under authorization from the Assembly of the Republic.
*Upon a proposal from the Government and with authorization from the Assembly of the Republic, the President of the Republic may declare war in the event of effective or imminent aggression and make peace.
*The President of the Republic promulgates or signs and, consequently, can veto the promulgation or signature of laws, decree-laws, regulatory decrees and other Government decrees.
*In the domain of his competences in international relations, the President of the Republic ratifies international treaties.
*The President of the Republic decides on the convening of the referendum whose holding is proposed by the Assembly of the Republic.
*The President of the Republic may request the Constitutional Court to pre-empt the constitutionality of norms contained in international conventions or decrees that have been sent to him for promulgation as an organic law, law or decree-law.
*The President of the Republic appoints and exonerates, in some cases on a proposal from the Government, holders of important State bodies such as the Representatives of the Republic for the autonomous regions, the President of the Court of Auditors and the Attorney General of the Republic, five members of the Council of State and two members of the Superior Council of the Judiciary.
*The President of the Republic appoints the ambassadors and extraordinary envoys, on a proposal from the Government, and accredits the foreign diplomatic representatives.
*The President of the Republic, after hearing the Government, pardons and commutes sentences.

== Election ==
Under the Portuguese Constitution adopted in 1976, in the wake of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, the president is elected to a five-year term. In order to be eligible, any citizen has to be of Portuguese origin and above 35 years old. He may be reelected any number of times, but not more than twice in a row. The official residence of the Portuguese president is the Belém Palace in Lisbon.

The president is elected in a two-round system: if no candidate reaches 50% of the votes during the first round, the two candidates with the most votes face each other in a second round held two weeks later. However, the second round has only been needed once, during the 1986 presidential election. To date, all of the elected presidents since the Carnation Revolution have served for two consecutive terms, and presidents consistently rank as the most popular political figure in the country. During his time in office, however, the popularity of former president Aníbal Cavaco Silva plummeted, making him the second-least popular political figure in the country, just above the then-prime minister, and the first Portuguese president after 1974 to have a negative popularity. By 2024, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa also displayed negative popularity ratings.

===Succession===
Under article 132 of the Constitution, if the president dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, the president of the Assembly assumes the office with restricted powers until a new president can be inaugurated following fresh elections.

==President&#x27;s residence==
Belém Palace is the official residence of the President of the Portuguese Republic since 1910. Built in the 16th century by a high ranking diplomat named Manuel de Portugal, was bought by King John V in the 18th century and served as one of the residence of the Royal Family until the early 20th century.

Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, current President, lives in the palace.

<text>The president of Syria () is the head of state of Syria. The president is vested with sweeping powers that may be delegated, at his sole discretion, to his vice presidents. The president appoints and dismisses the prime minister and other members of the Council of Ministers (the cabinet) and military officers.

The position is currently held by Ahmed al-Sharaa in a transitional capacity since 29 January 2025.

==Term of office==
Article 88 of the 2012 constitution states that the president serves a seven-year term and &quot;can be elected for only one more successive term.&quot; Article 155 states that Article 88 applies to the president &quot;as of the next presidential elections.&quot;

*Creating and overseeing the implementation of general state policy

== Constitutional changes ==
On 31 January 1973, Hafez al-Assad implemented a new constitution, which led to a national crisis. Unlike previous constitutions, this one did not require that the president of Syria must be a Muslim, leading to fierce demonstrations in Hama, Homs and Aleppo. The main objection to the constitution from demonstrators was that Islam was not specified as the state religion. In response to riots, the Syrian Constitution of 1973 was amended to stipulate that Islam was the religion of the president.

A new constitution was approved in February 2012 after the start of the Syrian revolution.

After the fall of the Assad regime, the position became vacant on 8 December 2024. The duties of the head of state were conducted by a transitional government led by Mohammed al-Bashir in the role of prime minister. On 29 January 2025, during the Syrian Revolution Victory Conference in Damascus, the Syrian General Command appointed Ahmed al-Sharaa as president for the transitional period after he had served as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader following the fall of the Assad regime. Al-Sharaa announced plans to issue a &quot;constitutional declaration&quot; as a legal reference following the dissolution of the 2012 Constitution of Ba&#x27;athist Syria.

<doc id="516111" wikidata="Q2522739" url="?curid=516111" title="President of Trinidad and Tobago">
<text>The president of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago is the head of state of Trinidad and Tobago and the commander-in-chief of the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force. The office was established when the country became a republic in 1976, before which the head of state was the Queen of Trinidad and Tobago, Elizabeth II. The last governor-general, Sir Ellis Clarke, was sworn in as the first president on 1 August 1976 under a transitional arrangement. He was formally chosen as president by an electoral college consisting of members of both houses of Parliament on 24 September 1976, which is now celebrated as Republic Day.

The president&#x27;s post was one of many temporarily suspended during the Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt lasting from 27 July 1990 - 1 August 1990 when it resumed. The current president of Trinidad and Tobago is Christine Kangaloo.

== History ==
On 12 December 1969, at a sitting of the House of Representatives, the prime minister moved a motion on constitutional reform. He suggested that the House approve the appointment of a joint select committee of Parliament which would include representatives of all parties to consider whether it was desirable for Trinidad and Tobago to become a republic.

On 9 October 1970, the commission was appointed. They met once on 19 October 1970. However, in its report to Parliament, the committee stated that it wasn&#x27;t able to complete consideration of the subject matter entrusted to it and recommended that in the following session a committee be appointed to complete action on this matter.

Hochoy announced the Government&#x27;s decision to appoint a constitutional commission, which was mandated to make recommendations for the revision of the constitution and also to produce a draft constitution based on its enquiry. Two years and six months later, in 1974, the complete report with recommendations, and the draft constitution were presented to the Governor-General on 22 January.

On 13 June 1975, Prime Minister Dr. Eric Williams laid the draft constitution of the republic in Parliament. Both houses of Parliament passed the &quot;Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago Act&quot; on 26 March 1976. Just before the voting, most of the opposition leaders left the chamber in protest. There was also an attempt to stop the Governor-General&#x27;s assent to the bill, through a motion filed by a private citizen in the San Fernando Supreme Court, but it failed. The bill was assented to on 29 March by the Governor-General.

The new constitution was adopted on 1 August 1976, when Trinidad and Tobago became a republic within the Commonwealth with a president as its head of state.

Upon proclamation of the republic, the monarchy and the post of governor-general were abolished. Ellis Clarke, the last governor-general, was sworn in as the country&#x27;s first president.

==Electoral method==
The President of Trinidad and Tobago is indirectly elected for a 5-year term by an electoral college comprising all 41 members of the House of Representatives and all 31 members of the Senate, plus the speakers of both chambers.

The president must be at least 18 years old (although no president has been younger than 40) a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, and at the time of nomination must have been resident in the country for an unbroken period of ten years.

To win the election a candidate must gain a plurality of votes cast, whereby a quorum comprising the Speaker of the House of Representatives, 10 Senators and 12 other member of the House of Representatives must be met for the election to be considered valid. If only one candidate should be nominated to run in the election, he or she shall be considered to have been elected president without the need for a vote to take place.

The oath for the due execution of the office of president is:

== Constitutional role ==

The 1976 Constitution gives the country a Westminster parliamentary system of government based on that of the United Kingdom, wherein the role of the head of state is both legal and practical. Similarly to other parliamentary republics in the Commonwealth of Nations such as India and Barbados, but unlike continental European parliamentary states such as Germany and Italy, the president of Trinidad and Tobago is formally vested with great constitutional power extending to all three branches of government. Like the British sovereign (and heads of state in other Westminster systems), the president &quot;reigns but does not rule&quot;. In practice, executive authority is exercised by the prime minister and his or her cabinet, on behalf of the president as per the as per the amended constitution, which states the president &quot;shall act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet&quot; except in certain circumstances, usually described as the reserve powers.

=== Executive powers ===
Under the amended constitution, the president is the nominal source of executive power. One of the main duties of the president is to appoint a prime minister, who thereafter heads the cabinet and advises the president on how to execute their executive powers over all aspects of government operations and foreign affairs. The president&#x27;s role is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate, while the Cabinet directs the use of the president&#x27;s executive power, which includes the privilege to declare war, as well as to summon and prorogue parliament and call elections.

However, it is important to note that the president&#x27;s executive powers belongs to the president and not to any of the ministers, though it might have sometimes appeared that way, and the constitution allows the president to unilaterally use these powers in relation to the dismissal of a prime minister, dissolution of parliament, and removal of a judge in exceptional, constitutional crisis situations.

The president, to maintain the stability of the government of Trinidad and Tobago, appoints as prime minister the individual most likely to maintain the support of the House of Representatives. The president additionally appoints other ministers, on the advice of the prime minister. The president is remains fully briefed through regular communications from the cabinet.

=== Foreign affairs ===
The president&#x27;s executive power also extends to foreign affairs: the president may negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements. However, in practice, such negotiations are usually carried out by the prime minister along with their Cabinet. The president also accredits Trinidad and Tobago High Commissioners and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states.

=== Parliament ===

The president, along with the Senate and the House of Representatives, is one of the three components of parliament. Since the president is almost always required to act on the advice of the cabinet, the president&#x27;s role in the legislative process is limited to assenting to bills and signing them into law. However, the president has the absolute power to withhold assent to Bills passed by Parliament (i.e. to veto without parliamentary override).

Further, the Constitution outlines that the president is responsible for appointing senators — 16 Government Senators appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, 6 Opposition Senators appointed on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition and 9 Independent Senators appointed on the discretion of the President from outstanding persons who represent other sectors of civil society.

The president additionally summons, prorogues, and dissolves parliament; after the latter, the writs for a general election are usually issued by the president at President&#x27;s House. In practice, these powers are almost always exercised on the advice of the cabinet.

=== Judicial powers ===
The president has the right to appoint judges on the joint recommendation of the prime minister and leader of the opposition, and pardon offenders.

== Cultural role ==
In addition to the formal constitutional role and with most constitutional functions lent to Cabinet, the president has a representative and ceremonial role, though the extent and nature of that role has depended on the expectations of the time, the individual in office at the time, the wishes of the incumbent government, and the individual&#x27;s reputation in the wider community. Presidents generally become patrons of various charitable institutions, present honours and awards, host functions for various groups of people including ambassadors to and from other countries, and travel widely throughout Trinidad and Tobago. Also as part of international relations, the president issues the credentials (called letter of credence) of Trinidad and Tobago ambassadors and consuls, when they visit foreign nations.

=== Presence and duties ===

Official duties involve the president representing the state at home or abroad and participating in a government-organised ceremony either in Trinidad and Tobago or elsewhere. The president and/or his or her spouse have participated in events such as important milestones, anniversaries, or celebrations of Trinidad and Tobago culture; Independence Day; the openings of public events like sport games; award ceremonies; Remembrance Day commemorations; and the like. The president provides non-partisan leadership in the community, acting as patron of many charitable, service, sporting and cultural organisations, and attending functions throughout the country.The president also encourages, articulates and represents those things that unite Trinbagonians together. In this role, the president:

* frequently receives citizens on special occasions or celebrations, students of various schools, and visitors from other countries at President&#x27;s House.
* attends church services, religious observances, and charitable, social, and civic events across the country.
* accepts patronage of many national, charitable, cultural, educational, sporting and professional organizations.
* issues congratulatory messages to organizations for special anniversaries and events, such as major national or international conferences, cultural festivals and sporting championships.

=== Military duties ===

Under section 22 of the constitution, the president &quot;...shall be the Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces&quot;, consisting of the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment, the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard, the Trinidad and Tobago Air Guard and the Defence Force Reserves. The position technically involves issuing commands for Trinidad and Tobago troops, airmen, and sailors, though in practice the president does not play any part in the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force command structure other than following the advice of the Minister for Defence in the normal form of executive government. In practice the commander-in-chief is a ceremonial role in which the president will take part in military ceremonies, including, independence parades, inspections of the troops, and state arrival ceremonies for foreign heads of state.

== Privileges ==

=== Salary ===
The president receives a monthly salary of $64,270TT, as of 2022.

=== Symbols ===
The presidential flag may be flown from a vehicle in which the president is travelling, or from a building in which the president is present or is residing. The flag in its present form was adopted in 1976 and is a blue field with the Trinidad and Tobago coat of arms surrounded by 11 petos on each side. It takes precedence over the national flag. The national flag is generally employed when the president undertakes a state visit abroad or on a national celebration. The national flag is also flown at half-mast upon the death of an incumbent or former president.

=== Precedence and title ===
In the Trinidad and Tobago order of precedence, the president outranks all other individuals. The president and their spouse are styled &quot;His/Her Excellency&quot; during the term in office, the president and their spouse are entitled to the style &quot;His/Her Excellency&quot; for life upon assuming the office. On presentation to the president, the correct form of address is “Your Excellency”.

=== Residence ===

The official residence of the president is President&#x27;s House, previously known as Government House when it was used by the governors-general and governors of the islands. Today, as well as being the President&#x27;s private residence, the mansion is used for national awards and swearing-in ceremonies, as well as diplomatic receptions.

== List of presidents ==
Under the 1976 Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the president replaced the monarch as head of state. The president was elected by Parliament for a five-year term. In the event of a vacancy the President of the Senate served as acting president.

<doc id="516112" wikidata="Q78995" url="?curid=516112" title="Hans Hermann Groër">
<text>Hans Hermann Wilhelm Groër OSB (13 October 1919 – 24 March 2003) was an Austrian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Vienna from 1986 to 1995, and became a cardinal in 1988. Pope John Paul II replaced him as archbishop after multiple allegations of sexual abuse of children, and at John Paul&#x27;s request Groër relinquished all ecclesiastical duties and privileges as an archbishop and cardinal on 14 April 1998.

==Biography==
Groër was born in Vienna to German parents, with whom he moved in 1929 to Czechoslovakia, where they remained for the next decade. He attended seminaries in Hollabrunn and Vienna (where he received his doctorate in theology) before being ordained to the priesthood on 12 April 1942 by Cardinal Theodor Innitzer. Groër then served as a chaplain in Petronell and Bad Vöslau until 1946, when he became Prefect of Studies at the minor seminary of Hollabrunn. He entered the Order of Saint Benedict in 1974 and took the name Hermann upon his solemn profession of vows on 8 September 1980. That same year Groër was named the spiritual director of the Legion of Mary for Austria.

On 15 July 1986, he was appointed the fifteenth Archbishop of Vienna, succeeding Cardinal Franz König. Groër received his episcopal consecration on the following 14 September from König, with Archbishop Karl Berg and Bishop Stefan László serving as co-consecrators. He was created Cardinal Priest of Santi Gioacchino ed Anna al Tuscolano by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 28 June 1988.

==Sexual abuse of school boys, monks==
In 1995, one of Groër&#x27;s former school students accused him of sexual molestation. A number of others made similar charges shortly thereafter, as did some monks. Pope John Paul II promoted Christoph Schönborn from auxiliary bishop to Coadjutor Archbishop of Vienna on 13 April 1995 and later in the year accepted the resignation Groër had submitted as required on his 75th birthday in October 1994. Groër moved to the Roggendorf monastery, where he served as prior. When new allegations surfaced, Austrian Church officials appealed to the pope, who initiated an investigation in February 1998. In April, at the pope&#x27;s request, Groër resigned as prior and withdrew from public life. He released a statement that said: &quot;In the past three years there have been many often incorrect statements concerning me. I ask God and the people for forgiveness if I have brought guilt upon myself.&quot; After surrendering his Church duties and duties as a Cardinal, Groër left Austria as part of a &quot;self imposed exile&quot; for several months and moved into a convent near Dresden, Germany. He continued to work as a confessor in women&#x27;s monasteries, received visitors and said Mass. Suffering from cancer, his health declined rapidly.

Austria&#x27;s statute of limitations prevented civil authorities from prosecuting Groër. In 2010, Cardinal Schönborn (elevated to that rank in 1998) said that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger had attempted to convince Pope John Paul II to initiate the investigation and—in a conversation with journalists that Schönborn thought was private—said that Cardinal Angelo Sodano had blocked his attempt to investigate Groër&#x27;s activities. Church officials are also alleged to have offered some of Groër&#x27;s former pupils compensation in return for agreeing not to repeat their charges against him. Hubertus Czernin, author of a book about the case, believes that Groër abused more than 2,000 young men. Groër continued to deny the allegations until his death.

==Death and eulogies==

Groër died on 24 March 2003 of pneumonia at a hospital in Sankt Pölten, where he had been treated for cancer. Cardinal Schönborn presided at the requiem Mass in St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral and in his homily honoured his predecessor&#x27;s accomplishments in strengthening Marian devotions in the Archdiocese as well as fostering priestly and monastic vocations. The next day, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, Archbishop of Cologne, referenced the charges against Groër in his eulogy only to describe how Groër had suffered, noting how Groër was &quot;deeply wounded, even stigmatized by the incidents during his last years as Archbishop of Vienna&quot;, that &quot;when the dark cloud gathered over his life ... he sank into loneliness and contempt&quot;.

Groër was buried in the cemetery of Marienfeld Abbey, the Cistercian women&#x27;s monastery he was instrumental in founding in 1974.

<doc id="516113" wikidata="Q14911897" url="?curid=516113" title="President of Tunisia">
<text>The president of Tunisia, officially the president of the Republic of Tunisia (), is the executive head of state of Tunisia. The president exercises executive power with the assistance of a government headed by the prime minister in a presidential system and is the commander-in-chief of the Tunisian Armed Forces. Under the Constitution, the president is elected by direct universal suffrage for a term of five years, renewable once.

The first president of the Tunisian Republic when the position was created on 25 July 1957 was Habib Bourguiba, who remained in power for 30 years until he was removed through the coup of 7 November 1987, by his prime minister Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who appointed himself President of the Republic, and in turn remained in power for 23 years, until his fall in the Tunisian revolution on 14 January 2011. He then appointed Fouad Mebazaa as interim president, until he handed over power on 13 December 2011 to the politician Moncef Marzouki, the first democratic president in the country’s history, who was elected by the Constituent Assembly.

Marzouki handed over power on 31 December 2014 to his successor, Beji Caid Essebsi, who won the 2014 presidential elections, thus becoming the second directly democratically elected president in the history of Tunisia, until his death on 25 July 2019, with Parliament Speaker Mohamed Ennaceur assuming the presidency temporarily until presidential elections were held. Bourguiba and Ben Ali also headed the ruling party, called the Neo Destour, Socialist Destourian Party then the Democratic Constitutional Rally, from independence in 1956 until the Tunisian revolution in 2011, when the president of the republic must abandon his party status if he wins the presidency. The 2022 Tunisian constitutional referendum transformed Tunisia into a presidential republic, giving the president sweeping powers while largely limiting the role of the parliament. The current president of the Republic of Tunisia is Kais Saied, since 23 October 2019.

==History==
Since the promulgation of a republican constitution in June 1959, three years after gaining independence from France, Tunisia has had just four directly elected presidents. The first president was Habib Bourguiba, who became the country&#x27;s first president after the proclamation of a republic in 1957; he had been the country&#x27;s de facto leader as prime minister since independence in 1956. He was formally elected to the post in 1959, and was proclaimed president for life in 1975. He was removed from office in a coup d&#x27;état in 1987 by Prime Minister Zine El Abidine Ben Ali after being declared medically unfit to continue in office. Ben Ali ascended as acting president, was elected in his own right in 1989 and served until 2011, when he was forced from office during an uprising against his rule. In the country&#x27;s first free presidential election, held in December 2014, Beji Caid Essebsi was elected in the second round.

For most of its history as an independent state, Tunisia lacked political democracy in the Western sense, and saw widespread violations of human rights. Because of this, presidential elections in Tunisia, such as that of 2009, lacked international credibility. Elections resulted in implausibly high margins for the ruling party, the Constitutional Democratic Rally and its previous incarnations as the Neo Destour party and the Socialist Destourian Party. Prior to 1999, presidential candidates had to be endorsed by at least 30 political figures—a realistic possibility only for a candidate from a well-organized party like the RCD. Given the RCD&#x27;s near-total domination of Tunisian politics, opposition candidates found it impossible to get their nomination papers signed. Even when this requirement was lifted, incumbent Ben Ali was reelected three more times by implausibly high margins; his lowest margin was 89 percent in 2009.

Tunisia&#x27;s original republican constitution vested the president with sweeping executive and legislative powers. Indeed, within the context of the system, he was a virtual dictator. He was elected for a term of five years, with no term limits. In 1975, five months after winning his third full term, Bourguiba was named president for life. From 1987 to 2002, a president was limited to three five-year terms, with no more than two in a row. However, this provision was removed in June 2002. The 2014 Constitution retained the presidency as the key institution, but hedged it about with numerous checks and balances to prevent a repeat of past authoritarian excesses. Most notably, a president is limited to two five-year terms, even if they are non-successive. The Constitution explicitly forbids any amendment to increase the length of a president&#x27;s term or allow him to run for more than two terms.

Under the current constitution, the president is primarily responsible for foreign policy, defense and national security, while the head of government (prime minister) is responsible for domestic policy. Following Zine El Abidine Ben Ali&#x27;s ousting in January 2011, prime minister Mohamed Ghannouchi invoked article 56 of the Constitution regarding temporary absence of the president to assume the role of acting president. This move was deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court hours later and President of the Chamber of Deputies Fouad Mebazaa was appointed as acting president based on article 57 of the Constitution regarding permanent absence of the president. On 12 December 2011, Moncef Marzouki was elected by the newly formed Constituent Assembly as interim president of the Republic.

== Elections ==

The president is elected by universal suffrage by majority during elections held in the last sixty days of the previous presidential term. Article 74 of the Constitution establishes that the right to presidential candidacy is open to every Tunisian national of at least 35 years of age and of Muslim faith. Candidates must renounce any prior nationality upon election.

Voting takes place in the form of a two round winner-take-all election. Article 75 indicates that if no candidate receives an absolute majority of the votes cast during the first round, a second round shall be held within two weeks of the announcement of the final results of the first round. The two candidates having received the most votes in the first round are both presented in the second round, with the candidate receiving the most votes between the two being declared president-elect. If one of the candidates on the ballot dies, a new call for candidates is made, with new election dates set within no more than 45 days; this provision does not apply to the potential withdrawal of candidates. The Constitution also specifies that one may not occupy the position of president for more than two full terms, consecutive or non-consecutive, and that in the event of resignation, the term is considered to have been completed in full.

<text>Digital light processing (DLP) is a set of chipsets based on optical micro-electro-mechanical technology that uses a digital micromirror device. It was originally developed in 1987 by Larry Hornbeck of Texas Instruments. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP-based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997. Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for the DLP projector technology. DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses.

DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), DLP rear projection television sets, and digital signs. It was also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection as of around 2011, and in additive manufacturing as a light source in some printers to cure resins into solid 3D objects.

Smaller &quot;pico&quot; chipsets are used in mobile devices including cell phone accessories and projection display functions embedded directly into phones.

== Digital micromirror device ==
In DLP projectors, the image is created by microscopically small mirrors laid out in a matrix on a semiconductor chip, known as a digital micromirror device (DMD). These mirrors are so small that DMD pixel pitch may be 5.4 μm or less. Each mirror represents one or more pixels in the projected image. The number of mirrors corresponds to the resolution of the projected image (often half as many mirrors as the advertised resolution due to wobulation). 800×600, 1024×768, 1280×720, and 1920×1080 (HDTV) matrices are some common DMD sizes. These mirrors can be repositioned rapidly to reflect light either through the lens or onto a heat sink (called a &quot;light dump&quot; in Barco terminology).

Rapidly toggling the mirror between these two orientations (essentially on and off) produces grayscales, controlled by the ratio of on-time to off-time.

== Color in DLP projection ==
There are two primary methods by which DLP projection systems create a color image: those used by single-chip DLP projectors, and those used by three-chip projectors. A third method, sequential illumination by three colored light emitting diodes, is being developed, and is currently used in televisions manufactured by Samsung.

=== Single-chip projectors ===
In a projector with a single DLP chip, colors are produced either by placing a color wheel between a white lamp and the DLP chip or by using individual light sources to produce the primary colors, LEDs or lasers for example. The color wheel is divided into multiple sectors: the primary additive colors: red, green, and blue, and in many cases white (clear). Newer systems substitute the primary subtractive colors cyan, magenta, and yellow for white. The use of the subtractive colors is part of the newer color performance system called BrilliantColor which processes the additive colors along with the subtractive colors to create a broader spectrum of possible color combinations on the screen.

The DLP chip is synchronized with the rotating motion of the color wheel so that the green component is displayed on the DMD when the green section of the color wheel is in front of the lamp. The same is true for the red, blue and other sections. The colors are thus displayed sequentially at a sufficiently high rate that the observer sees a composite &quot;full color&quot; image. In early models, this was one rotation per frame. Now, most systems operate at up to 10× the frame rate.

The black level of a single-chip DLP depends on how unused light is being disposed. If the unused light is scattered to reflect and dissipate on the rough interior walls of the DMD and lens chamber, this scattered light will be visible as a dim gray on the projection screen, when the image is fully dark. Deeper blacks and higher contrast ratios are possible by directing unused HID light away from the DMD and lens chamber into a separate area for dissipation and shielding the light path from unwanted internal secondary reflections.

==== Color wheel &quot;rainbow effect&quot; ====
Single-chip DLP projectors utilizing a mechanical spinning color wheel may exhibit an anomaly known as the &quot;rainbow effect&quot;. This is best described as brief flashes of perceived red, blue, and green &quot;shadows&quot; observed most often when the projected content features high contrast areas of moving bright or white objects on a mostly dark or black background. Common examples are the scrolling end credits of many movies, and also animations with moving objects surrounded by a thick black outline. Brief visible separation of the colors can also be apparent when the viewer&#x27;s gaze is moved quickly across the projected image. Some people perceive these rainbow artifacts frequently, while others may never see them at all.

This effect is caused by the way the eye follows a moving object on the projection. When an object on the screen moves, the eye follows the object with a constant motion, but the projector displays each alternating color of the frame at the same location for the duration of the whole frame. So, while the eye is moving, it sees a frame of a specific color (red, for example). Then, when the next color is displayed (green, for example), although it gets displayed at the same location overlapping the previous color, the eye has moved toward the object&#x27;s next frame target. Thus, the eye sees that specific frame color slightly shifted. Then, the third color gets displayed (blue, for example), and the eye sees that frame&#x27;s color slightly shifted again. This effect is not perceived only for the moving object, but the whole picture. Multi-color LED-based and laser-based single-chip projectors are able to eliminate the spinning wheel and minimize the rainbow effect since the pulse rates of LEDs and lasers are not limited by physical motion. Three-chip DLP projectors function without color wheels, and therefore do not manifest this rainbow artifact.&quot;

=== Three-chip projectors ===
A three-chip DLP projector uses a prism to split light from the lamp, and each primary color of light is then routed to its own DMD chip, then recombined and routed out through the lens. Three chip systems are found in higher-end home theater projectors, large venue projectors and DLP Cinema projection systems found in digital movie theaters.

According to DLP.com, the three-chip projectors used in movie theaters can produce 35 trillion colors. The human eye is suggested to be able to detect around 16 million colors , which is theoretically possible with the single chip solution. However, this high color precision does not mean that three-chip DLP projectors are capable of displaying the entire gamut of colors we can distinguish (this is fundamentally impossible with any system composing colors by adding three constant base colors). In comparison, it is the one-chip DLP projectors that have the advantage of allowing any number of primary colors in a sufficiently fast color filter wheel, and so the possibility of improved color gamuts is available.

=== Light source ===

DLP technology is independent of the light-source and as such can be used effectively with a variety of light sources. Historically, the main light source used on DLP display systems has been a replaceable high-pressure xenon arc lamp unit (containing a quartz arc tube, reflector, electrical connections, and sometimes a quartz/glass shield), whereas most pico category (ultra-small) DLP projectors use high-power LEDs or lasers as a source of illumination.
Since 2021 a laser light source has become very common on many professional projectors, for example the Panasonic PT-RZ990.

==== Xenon arc lamps ====
For xenon arc lamps, a constant-current supply is used, which starts with a sufficiently high open-circuit voltage (between 5 and 20 kV, depending on lamp) to cause an arc to strike between the electrodes, and once the arc is established, the voltage across the lamp drops to a given value (typically 20 to 50 volts) while the current increases to a level required to maintain the arc at optimal brightness. As the lamp ages, its efficiency declines, due to electrode wear, resulting in a reduction in visible light and an increase in the amount of waste heat. The lamp&#x27;s end of life is typically indicated by an LED on the unit or an onscreen text warning, necessitating replacement of the lamp unit.

Continued operation of the lamp past its rated lifespan may result in a further decrease in efficiency, the lightcast may become uneven, and the lamp may eventually become hot enough to the point that the power wires can melt off the lamp terminals. Eventually, the required start-up voltage will also rise to the point where ignition can no longer occur. Secondary protections such as a temperature monitor may shut down the projector, but a thermally over-stressed quartz arc tube can also crack or explode. Practically all lamp housings contain heat-resistant barriers (in addition to those on the lamp unit itself) to prevent the red-hot quartz fragments from leaving the area.

==== LED-based DLPs ====
The first commercially available LED-based DLP HDTV was the Samsung HL-S5679W in 2006, which also eliminated the use of a color wheel. Besides long lifetime eliminating the need for lamp replacement and elimination of the color wheel, other advantages of LED illumination include instant-on operation and improved color, with increased color saturation and improved color gamut to over 140% of the NTSC color gamut. Samsung expanded the LED model line-up in 2007 with products available in 50-, 56- and 61-inch screen sizes. In 2008, the third generation of Samsung LED DLP products were available in 61- (HL61A750) and 67-inch (HL67A750) screen sizes.

Ordinary LED technology does not produce the intensity and high-lumen output characteristics required to replace arc lamps. The special LEDs used in all of the Samsung DLP TVs are PhlatLight LEDs, designed and manufactured by US-based Luminus Devices. A single RGB PhlatLight LED chipset illuminates these projection TVs. The PhlatLight LEDs are also used in a new class of ultra-compact DLP front projector commonly referred to as a &quot;pocket projector&quot; and have been introduced in new models from LG Electronics (HS101), Samsung (SP-P400) and Casio (XJ-A series). Home theater projectors will be the next category of DLP projectors that will use PhlatLight LED technology. At InfoComm in June 2008, Luminus and TI announced their collaboration on using their technology on home theater and business projectors and demonstrated a prototype PhlatLight LED-based DLP home theater front projector. They also announced products will be available in the marketplace later in 2008 from Optoma and other companies to be named later in the year.

Luminus Devices PhlatLight LEDs were also used by Christie Digital in their DLP-based MicroTiles display system. It is a modular system built from small (20 inch diagonal) rear projection cubes, which can be stacked and tiled together to form large display canvasses with very small seams. The scale and shape of the display can have any size, only constrained by practical limits.

==== Laser-based DLPs ====
The first commercially available laser-based DLP HDTV was the Mitsubishi L65-A90 LaserVue in 2008, which also eliminated the use of a color wheel. Three separate color lasers illuminate the digital micromirror device (DMD) in these projection TVs, producing a richer, more vibrant color palette than other methods. See the laser video display article for more information.

== Digital cinema ==


DLP Cinema systems have been deployed and tested commercially in theaters since 1999. In June 1999, &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; was the first movie to be entirely scanned and distributed to theaters.&lt;ref name=&quot;cinematreasures/10547&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;projectorcentral/94&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;installation-international/dlp-cinema-installations&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebay/225285600657&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Four theaters installed digital projectors for the movie&#x27;s release.&lt;ref name=&quot;theswca/78865&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The same was done for the animated film &quot;Tarzan&quot; that same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodreporter/171772&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year,&quot; Toy Story 2&quot; was the first movie to be entirely created, edited, and distributed digitally, with more theaters installing digital projectors for its release. DLP Cinema was the first commercial digital cinema technology and is the leading digital cinema technology with approximately 85% market share worldwide as of December 2011. Digital cinema has some advantages over film because film can be subject to color fading, jumping, scratching and dirt accumulation. Digital cinema allows the movie content to remain of consistent quality over time. Today, most movie content is also captured digitally. The first all-digital &quot;live-action&quot; feature shot &quot;without&quot; film was the 2002 release, &quot;Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot;.

DLP Cinema does not manufacture the end projectors, but rather provides the projection technology and works closely with Barco, Christie Digital and NEC who make the end projection units. DLP Cinema is available to theater owners in multiple resolutions depending on the needs of the exhibitor. These include 2K – for most theater screens, 4K – for large theater screens, and S2K, which was specifically designed for small theaters, particularly in emerging markets worldwide.

On February 2, 2000, Philippe Binant, technical manager of Digital Cinema Project at Gaumont, in France, realized the first digital cinema projection in Europe with the DLP Cinema technology developed by Texas Instruments. DLP is the current market-share leader in professional digital movie projection, largely because of its high contrast ratio and available resolution as compared to other digital front-projection technologies. As of December 2008, there are over 6,000 DLP-based digital cinema systems installed worldwide.

DLP projectors are also used in RealD 3D and newer IMAX theaters for 3D films.

== Manufacturers and marketplace ==


Since being introduced commercially in 1996, DLP technology gained market share in the front projection market and now holds greater than 50% of the worldwide share in front projection in addition to 85% market share in digital cinema worldwide. Additionally, in the pico category (small, mobile display) DLP technology holds approximately 70% market share. Over 30 manufacturers use the DLP chipset to power their projection display systems.

=== Pros ===
* Smooth (at 1080p resolution), jitter-free images.
* Perfect geometry and excellent grayscale linearity achievable.
* Usually excellent ANSI contrast.
* The use of a replaceable light source means a potentially longer life than CRTs and plasma displays (this may also be a con as listed below).
* The light source is more-easily replaceable than the backlights used with LCDs, and on DLPs is often user-replaceable.
* The light from the projected image is not inherently polarized.
* New LED and laser DLP display systems more or less eliminate the need for lamp replacement.
* DLP offers affordable 3D projection display from a single unit and can be used with both active and passive 3D solutions.
* Lighter weight than LCD and plasma televisions.
* Unlike their LCD and plasma counterparts, DLP screens do not rely on fluids as their projection medium and are therefore not limited in size by their inherent mirror mechanisms, making them ideal for increasingly larger high-definition theater and venue screens.
* DLP projectors can process up to seven separate colors, giving them a wider color gamut.

=== Cons ===

* Some viewers are bothered by the &quot;rainbow effect&quot; present in colour-wheel models - particularly in older models (explained above). This can be observed easily by using a camera&#x27;s digital viewfinder on projected content.
* Rear projection DLP TVs are not as thin as LCD or plasma flat-panel displays (although approximately comparable in weight), although some models as of 2008 are becoming wall-mountable (while still being thick)
* Replacement of the lamp in lamp-based units. The life span of an arc lamp averages 2000–5000 hours and the replacement cost for these range from $99 – 350, depending on the brand and model. Newer generations&#x27; units use LEDs or lasers which effectively eliminate this issue, although replacement LED chips could potentially be required over the extended lifespan of the television set.
* Some viewers find the high-pitched whine of the color wheel to be an annoyance. However, the drive system can be engineered to be silent and some projectors don&#x27;t produce any audible color wheel noise.
* Dithering noise may be noticeable, especially in dark image areas. Newer (post ≈2004) chip generations have less noise than older ones.
* Error-diffusion artifacts caused by averaging a shade over different pixels, since one pixel cannot render the shade exactly
* Response time in video games may be affected by upscaling lag. While all HDTVs have some lag when upscaling lower-resolution input to their native resolution, DLPs are commonly reported to have longer delays. Newer consoles that have HD output signals do not have this problem as long as they are connected with HD-capable cables.
* Reduced viewing angle as compared to direct-view technologies such as CRT, plasma, and LCD
* May use more electricity, and generate more heat, than competing technologies.

=== DLP, LCD, and LCoS rear projection ===
The most similar competing system to DLP is known as LCoS (liquid crystal on silicon), which creates images using a stationary mirror mounted on the surface of a chip and uses a liquid crystal matrix (similar to a liquid crystal display) to control how much light is reflected. DLP-based television systems are also arguably considered to be smaller in depth than traditional projection television.

<doc id="516133" wikidata="Q255996" url="?curid=516133" title="Equipartition theorem">
<text>In classical statistical mechanics, the equipartition theorem relates the temperature of a system to its average energies. The equipartition theorem is also known as the law of equipartition, equipartition of energy, or simply equipartition. The original idea of equipartition was that, in thermal equilibrium, energy is shared equally among all of its various forms; for example, the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom in translational motion of a molecule should equal that in rotational motion.

The equipartition theorem makes quantitative predictions. Like the virial theorem, it gives the total average kinetic and potential energies for a system at a given temperature, from which the system&#x27;s heat capacity can be computed. However, equipartition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy, such as the kinetic energy of a particular particle or the potential energy of a single spring. For example, it predicts that every atom in a monatomic ideal gas has an average kinetic energy of in thermal equilibrium, where is the Boltzmann constant and &quot;T&quot; is the (thermodynamic) temperature. More generally, equipartition can be applied to any classical system in thermal equilibrium, no matter how complicated. It can be used to derive the ideal gas law, and the Dulong–Petit law for the specific heat capacities of solids. The equipartition theorem can also be used to predict the properties of stars, even white dwarfs and neutron stars, since it holds even when relativistic effects are considered.

Although the equipartition theorem makes accurate predictions in certain conditions, it is inaccurate when quantum effects are significant, such as at low temperatures. When the thermal energy is smaller than the quantum energy spacing in a particular degree of freedom, the average energy and heat capacity of this degree of freedom are less than the values predicted by equipartition. Such a degree of freedom is said to be &quot;frozen out&quot; when the thermal energy is much smaller than this spacing. For example, the heat capacity of a solid decreases at low temperatures as various types of motion become frozen out, rather than remaining constant as predicted by equipartition. Such decreases in heat capacity were among the first signs to physicists of the 19th century that classical physics was incorrect and that a new, more subtle, scientific model was required. Along with other evidence, equipartition&#x27;s failure to model black-body radiation—also known as the ultraviolet catastrophe—led Max Planck to suggest that energy in the oscillators in an object, which emit light, were quantized, a revolutionary hypothesis that spurred the development of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.

==Basic concept and simple examples==


The name &quot;equipartition&quot; means &quot;equal division,&quot; as derived from the Latin &quot;equi&quot; from the antecedent, æquus (&quot;equal or even&quot;), and partition from the noun, &quot;partitio&quot; (&quot;division, portion&quot;). The original concept of equipartition was that the total kinetic energy of a system is shared equally among all of its independent parts, &quot;on the average&quot;, once the system has reached thermal equilibrium. Equipartition also makes quantitative predictions for these energies. For example, it predicts that every atom of an inert noble gas, in thermal equilibrium at temperature , has an average translational kinetic energy of , where is the Boltzmann constant. As a consequence, since kinetic energy is equal to (mass)(velocity)2, the heavier atoms of xenon have a lower average speed than do the lighter atoms of helium at the same temperature. Figure 2 shows the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the speeds of the atoms in four noble gases.

In this example, the key point is that the kinetic energy is quadratic in the velocity. The equipartition theorem shows that in thermal equilibrium, any degree of freedom (such as a component of the position or velocity of a particle) which appears only quadratically in the energy has an average energy of and therefore contributes to the system&#x27;s heat capacity. This has many applications.

===Translational energy and ideal gases===
The (Newtonian) kinetic energy of a particle of mass , velocity is given by
:formula_1
where , and are the Cartesian components of the velocity . Here, is short for Hamiltonian, and used henceforth as a symbol for energy because the Hamiltonian formalism plays a central role in the most general form of the equipartition theorem.

Since the kinetic energy is quadratic in the components of the velocity, by equipartition these three components each contribute to the average kinetic energy in thermal equilibrium. Thus the average kinetic energy of the particle is , as in the example of noble gases above.

More generally, in a monatomic ideal gas the total energy consists purely of (translational) kinetic energy: by assumption, the particles have no internal degrees of freedom and move independently of one another. Equipartition therefore predicts that the total energy of an ideal gas of particles is .

It follows that the heat capacity of the gas is and hence, in particular, the heat capacity of a mole of such gas particles is , where &quot;N&quot;A is the Avogadro constant and &quot;R&quot; is the gas constant. Since &quot;R&quot; ≈ 2 cal/(mol·K), equipartition predicts that the molar heat capacity of an ideal gas is roughly 3 cal/(mol·K). This prediction is confirmed by experiment when compared to monatomic gases.

The mean kinetic energy also allows the root mean square speed of the gas particles to be calculated:
:formula_2
where is the mass of a mole of gas particles. This result is useful for many applications such as Graham&#x27;s law of effusion, which provides a method for enriching uranium.

===Rotational energy and molecular tumbling in solution===
A similar example is provided by a rotating molecule with principal moments of inertia , and . According to classical mechanics, the rotational energy of such a molecule is given by
:formula_3
where , , and are the principal components of the angular velocity. By exactly the same reasoning as in the translational case, equipartition implies that in thermal equilibrium the average rotational energy of each particle is . Similarly, the equipartition theorem allows the average (more precisely, the root mean square) angular speed of the molecules to be calculated.

The tumbling of rigid molecules—that is, the random rotations of molecules in solution—plays a key role in the relaxations observed by nuclear magnetic resonance, particularly protein NMR and residual dipolar couplings. Rotational diffusion can also be observed by other biophysical probes such as fluorescence anisotropy, flow birefringence and dielectric spectroscopy.

===Potential energy and harmonic oscillators===
Equipartition applies to potential energies as well as kinetic energies: important examples include harmonic oscillators such as a spring, which has a quadratic potential energy
:formula_4
where the constant describes the stiffness of the spring and is the deviation from equilibrium. If such a one-dimensional system has mass , then its kinetic energy is
:formula_5
where and denote the velocity and momentum of the oscillator. Combining these terms yields the total energy
:formula_6
Equipartition therefore implies that in thermal equilibrium, the oscillator has average energy
:formula_7
where the angular brackets formula_8 denote the average of the enclosed quantity,

This result is valid for any type of harmonic oscillator, such as a pendulum, a vibrating molecule or a passive electronic oscillator. Systems of such oscillators arise in many situations; by equipartition, each such oscillator receives an average total energy and hence contributes to the system&#x27;s heat capacity. This can be used to derive the formula for Johnson–Nyquist noise and the Dulong–Petit law of solid heat capacities. The latter application was particularly significant in the history of equipartition.

===Specific heat capacity of solids===
An important application of the equipartition theorem is to the specific heat capacity of a crystalline solid. Each atom in such a solid can oscillate in three independent directions, so the solid can be viewed as a system of independent simple harmonic oscillators, where denotes the number of atoms in the lattice. Since each harmonic oscillator has average energy , the average total energy of the solid is , and its heat capacity is .

By taking to be the Avogadro constant , and using the relation between the gas constant and the Boltzmann constant , this provides an explanation for the Dulong–Petit law of specific heat capacities of solids, which stated that the specific heat capacity (per unit mass) of a solid element is inversely proportional to its atomic weight. A modern version is that the molar heat capacity of a solid is &quot;3R&quot; ≈ 6 cal/(mol·K).

However, this law is inaccurate at lower temperatures, due to quantum effects; it is also inconsistent with the experimentally derived third law of thermodynamics, according to which the molar heat capacity of any substance must go to zero as the temperature goes to absolute zero. A more accurate theory, incorporating quantum effects, was developed by Albert Einstein (1907) and Peter Debye (1911).

Many other physical systems can be modeled as sets of coupled oscillators. The motions of such oscillators can be decomposed into normal modes, like the vibrational modes of a piano string or the resonances of an organ pipe. On the other hand, equipartition often breaks down for such systems, because there is no exchange of energy between the normal modes. In an extreme situation, the modes are independent and so their energies are independently conserved. This shows that some sort of mixing of energies, formally called &quot;ergodicity&quot;, is important for the law of equipartition to hold.

===Sedimentation of particles===
Potential energies are not always quadratic in the position. However, the equipartition theorem also shows that if a degree of freedom contributes only a multiple of (for a fixed real number ) to the energy, then in thermal equilibrium the average energy of that part is .

There is a simple application of this extension to the sedimentation of particles under gravity. For example, the haze sometimes seen in beer can be caused by clumps of proteins that scatter light. Over time, these clumps settle downwards under the influence of gravity, causing more haze near the bottom of a bottle than near its top. However, in a process working in the opposite direction, the particles also diffuse back up towards the top of the bottle. Once equilibrium has been reached, the equipartition theorem may be used to determine the average position of a particular clump of buoyant mass . For an infinitely tall bottle of beer, the gravitational potential energy is given by
:formula_9
where is the height of the protein clump in the bottle and &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration due to gravity. Since , the average potential energy of a protein clump equals . Hence, a protein clump with a buoyant mass of 10 MDa (roughly the size of a virus) would produce a haze with an average height of about 2 cm at equilibrium. The process of such sedimentation to equilibrium is described by the Mason–Weaver equation.

==History==
The equipartition of kinetic energy was proposed initially in 1843, and more correctly in 1845, by John James Waterston. In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell argued that the kinetic heat energy of a gas is equally divided between linear and rotational energy. In 1876, Ludwig Boltzmann expanded on this principle by showing that the average energy was divided equally among all the independent components of motion in a system. Boltzmann applied the equipartition theorem to provide a theoretical explanation of the Dulong–Petit law for the specific heat capacities of solids.

The history of the equipartition theorem is intertwined with that of specific heat capacity, both of which were studied in the 19th century. In 1819, the French physicists Pierre Louis Dulong and Alexis Thérèse Petit discovered that the specific heat capacities of solid elements at room temperature were inversely proportional to the atomic weight of the element. Their law was used for many years as a technique for measuring atomic weights. However, subsequent studies by James Dewar and Heinrich Friedrich Weber showed that this Dulong–Petit law holds only at high temperatures; at lower temperatures, or for exceptionally hard solids such as diamond, the specific heat capacity was lower.

Experimental observations of the specific heat capacities of gases also raised concerns about the validity of the equipartition theorem. The theorem predicts that the molar heat capacity of simple monatomic gases should be roughly 3 cal/(mol·K), whereas that of diatomic gases should be roughly 7 cal/(mol·K). Experiments confirmed the former prediction, but found that molar heat capacities of diatomic gases were typically about 5 cal/(mol·K), and fell to about 3 cal/(mol·K) at very low temperatures. Maxwell noted in 1875 that the disagreement between experiment and the equipartition theorem was much worse than even these numbers suggest; since atoms have internal parts, heat energy should go into the motion of these internal parts, making the predicted specific heats of monatomic and diatomic gases much higher than 3 cal/(mol·K) and 7 cal/(mol·K), respectively.

A third discrepancy concerned the specific heat of metals. According to the classical Drude model, metallic electrons act as a nearly ideal gas, and so they should contribute to the heat capacity by the equipartition theorem, where &quot;N&quot;e is the number of electrons. Experimentally, however, electrons contribute little to the heat capacity: the molar heat capacities of many conductors and insulators are nearly the same.

Several explanations of equipartition&#x27;s failure to account for molar heat capacities were proposed. Boltzmann defended the derivation of his equipartition theorem as correct, but suggested that gases might not be in thermal equilibrium because of their interactions with the aether. Lord Kelvin suggested that the derivation of the equipartition theorem must be incorrect, since it disagreed with experiment, but was unable to show how. In 1900 Lord Rayleigh instead put forward a more radical view that the equipartition theorem and the experimental assumption of thermal equilibrium were &quot;both&quot; correct; to reconcile them, he noted the need for a new principle that would provide an &quot;escape from the destructive simplicity&quot; of the equipartition theorem. Albert Einstein provided that escape, by showing in 1906 that these anomalies in the specific heat were due to quantum effects, specifically the quantization of energy in the elastic modes of the solid. Einstein used the failure of equipartition to argue for the need of a new quantum theory of matter. Nernst&#x27;s 1910 measurements of specific heats at low temperatures supported Einstein&#x27;s theory, and led to the widespread acceptance of quantum theory among physicists.

==General formulation of the equipartition theorem==
The most general form of the equipartition theorem states that under suitable assumptions (discussed below), for a physical system with Hamiltonian energy function and degrees of freedom , the following equipartition formula holds in thermal equilibrium for all indices and :
:formula_10
Here is the Kronecker delta, which is equal to one if and is zero otherwise. The averaging brackets formula_8 is assumed to be an ensemble average over phase space or, under an assumption of ergodicity, a time average of a single system.

The general equipartition theorem holds in both the microcanonical ensemble, when the total energy of the system is constant, and also in the canonical ensemble, when the system is coupled to a heat bath with which it can exchange energy. Derivations of the general formula are given later in the article.

The general formula is equivalent to the following two:
# formula_12
# formula_13

If a degree of freedom &quot;xn&quot; appears only as a quadratic term &quot;anxn&quot;2 in the Hamiltonian &quot;H&quot;, then the first of these formulae implies that

:formula_14

which is twice the contribution that this degree of freedom makes to the average energy formula_15. Thus the equipartition theorem for systems with quadratic energies follows easily from the general formula. A similar argument, with 2 replaced by &quot;s&quot;, applies to energies of the form &quot;anxns&quot;.

The degrees of freedom &quot;xn&quot; are coordinates on the phase space of the system and are therefore commonly subdivided into generalized position coordinates &quot;qk&quot; and generalized momentum coordinates &quot;pk&quot;, where &quot;pk&quot; is the conjugate momentum to &quot;qk&quot;. In this situation, formula 1 means that for all &quot;k&quot;,
:formula_16
Using the equations of Hamiltonian mechanics, these formulae may also be written

:formula_17

Similarly, one can show using formula 2 that
:formula_18
and
:formula_19

===Relation to the virial theorem===
The general equipartition theorem is an extension of the virial theorem (proposed in 1870), which states that
:formula_20
where &quot;t&quot; denotes time. Two key differences are that the virial theorem relates &quot;summed&quot; rather than &quot;individual&quot; averages to each other, and it does not connect them to the temperature &quot;T&quot;. Another difference is that traditional derivations of the virial theorem use averages over time, whereas those of the equipartition theorem use averages over phase space.

==Applications==

===Ideal gas law===
Ideal gases provide an important application of the equipartition theorem. As well as providing the formula
:formula_21
for the average kinetic energy per particle, the equipartition theorem can be used to derive the ideal gas law from classical mechanics. If q = (&quot;qx&quot;, &quot;qy&quot;, &quot;qz&quot;) and p = (&quot;px&quot;, &quot;py&quot;, &quot;pz&quot;) denote the position vector and momentum of a particle in the gas, and
F is the net force on that particle, then
:formula_22
where the first equality is Newton&#x27;s second law, and the second line uses Hamilton&#x27;s equations and the equipartition formula. Summing over a system of &quot;N&quot; particles yields
:formula_23
By Newton&#x27;s third law and the ideal gas assumption, the net force on the system is the force applied by the walls of their container, and this force is given by the pressure &quot;P&quot; of the gas. Hence
:formula_24
where is the infinitesimal area element along the walls of the container. Since the divergence of the position vector is
:formula_25
the divergence theorem implies that
:formula_26
where is an infinitesimal volume within the container and is the total volume of the container.

Putting these equalities together yields
:formula_27
which immediately implies the ideal gas law for &quot;N&quot; particles:
:formula_28
where is the number of moles of gas and is the gas constant. Although equipartition provides a simple derivation of the ideal-gas law and the internal energy, the same results can be obtained by an alternative method using the partition function.

===Diatomic gases===
A diatomic gas can be modelled as two masses, and , joined by a spring of stiffness , which is called the &quot;rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator approximation&quot;. The classical energy of this system is
:formula_29
where and are the momenta of the two atoms, and is the deviation of the inter-atomic separation from its equilibrium value. Every degree of freedom in the energy is quadratic and, thus, should contribute to the total average energy, and to the heat capacity. Therefore, the heat capacity of a gas of &quot;N&quot; diatomic molecules is predicted to be : the momenta and contribute three degrees of freedom each, and the extension contributes the seventh. It follows that the heat capacity of a mole of diatomic molecules with no other degrees of freedom should be and, thus, the predicted molar heat capacity should be roughly 7 cal/(mol·K). However, the experimental values for molar heat capacities of diatomic gases are typically about 5 cal/(mol·K) and fall to 3 cal/(mol·K) at very low temperatures. This disagreement between the equipartition prediction and the experimental value of the molar heat capacity cannot be explained by using a more complex model of the molecule, since adding more degrees of freedom can only &quot;increase&quot; the predicted specific heat, not decrease it. This discrepancy was a key piece of evidence showing the need for a quantum theory of matter.

===Extreme relativistic ideal gases===
Equipartition was used above to derive the classical ideal gas law from Newtonian mechanics. However, relativistic effects become dominant in some systems, such as white dwarfs and neutron stars, and the ideal gas equations must be modified. The equipartition theorem provides a convenient way to derive the corresponding laws for an extreme relativistic ideal gas. In such cases, the kinetic energy of a single particle is given by the formula
:formula_30
Taking the derivative of with respect to the momentum component gives the formula
:formula_31
and similarly for the and components. Adding the three components together gives
:formula_32
where the last equality follows from the equipartition formula. Thus, the average total energy of an extreme relativistic gas is twice that of the non-relativistic case: for particles, it is .

===Non-ideal gases===
In an ideal gas the particles are assumed to interact only through collisions. The equipartition theorem may also be used to derive the energy and pressure of &quot;non-ideal gases&quot; in which the particles also interact with one another through conservative forces whose potential depends only on the distance between the particles. This situation can be described by first restricting attention to a single gas particle, and approximating the rest of the gas by a spherically symmetric distribution. It is then customary to introduce a radial distribution function such that the probability density of finding another particle at a distance from the given particle is equal to , where is the mean density of the gas. It follows that the mean potential energy associated to the interaction of the given particle with the rest of the gas is
:formula_33
The total mean potential energy of the gas is therefore formula_34, where is the number of particles in the gas, and the factor is needed because summation over all the particles counts each interaction twice.
Adding kinetic and potential energies, then applying equipartition, yields the &quot;energy equation&quot;
:formula_35
A similar argument, can be used to derive the &quot;pressure equation&quot;
:formula_36

===Anharmonic oscillators===
An anharmonic oscillator (in contrast to a simple harmonic oscillator) is one in which the potential energy is not quadratic in the extension (the generalized position which measures the deviation of the system from equilibrium). Such oscillators provide a complementary point of view on the equipartition theorem. Simple examples are provided by potential energy functions of the form
:formula_37
where and are arbitrary real constants. In these cases, the law of equipartition predicts that
:formula_38
Thus, the average potential energy equals , not as for the quadratic harmonic oscillator (where ).

More generally, a typical energy function of a one-dimensional system has a Taylor expansion in the extension :
:formula_39
for non-negative integers . There is no term, because at the equilibrium point, there is no net force and so the first derivative of the energy is zero. The term need not be included, since the energy at the equilibrium position may be set to zero by convention. In this case, the law of equipartition predicts that
:formula_40
In contrast to the other examples cited here, the equipartition formula
:formula_41
does &quot;not&quot; allow the average potential energy to be written in terms of known constants.

===Brownian motion===

The equipartition theorem can be used to derive the Brownian motion of a particle from the Langevin equation. According to that equation, the motion of a particle of mass with velocity is governed by Newton&#x27;s second law
:formula_42
where is a random force representing the random collisions of the particle and the surrounding molecules, and where the time constant τ reflects the drag force that opposes the particle&#x27;s motion through the solution. The drag force is often written ; therefore, the time constant equals .

The dot product of this equation with the position vector , after averaging, yields the equation
:formula_43
for Brownian motion (since the random force is uncorrelated with the position ). Using the mathematical identities
:formula_44
and
:formula_45
the basic equation for Brownian motion can be transformed into
:formula_46
where the last equality follows from the equipartition theorem for translational kinetic energy:
:formula_47
The above differential equation for formula_48 (with suitable initial conditions) may be solved exactly:
:formula_49
On small time scales, with , the particle acts as a freely moving particle: by the Taylor series of the exponential function, the squared distance grows approximately &quot;quadratically&quot;:
:formula_50
However, on long time scales, with , the exponential and constant terms are negligible, and the squared distance grows only &quot;linearly&quot;:
:formula_51
This describes the diffusion of the particle over time. An analogous equation for the rotational diffusion of a rigid molecule can be derived in a similar way.

===Stellar physics===
The equipartition theorem and the related virial theorem have long been used as a tool in astrophysics. As examples, the virial theorem may be used to estimate stellar temperatures or the Chandrasekhar limit on the mass of white dwarf stars.

The average temperature of a star can be estimated from the equipartition theorem. Since most stars are spherically symmetric, the total gravitational potential energy can be estimated by integration
:formula_52
where is the mass within a radius and is the stellar density at radius ; represents the gravitational constant and the total radius of the star. Assuming a constant density throughout the star, this integration yields the formula
:formula_53
where is the star&#x27;s total mass. Hence, the average potential energy of a single particle is
:formula_54
where is the number of particles in the star. Since most stars are composed mainly of ionized hydrogen, equals roughly , where is the mass of one proton. Application of the equipartition theorem gives an estimate of the star&#x27;s temperature
:formula_55
Substitution of the mass and radius of the Sun yields an estimated solar temperature of &quot;T&quot; = 14 million kelvins, very close to its core temperature of 15 million kelvins. However, the Sun is much more complex than assumed by this model—both its temperature and density vary strongly with radius—and such excellent agreement (≈7% relative error) is partly fortuitous.

===Star formation===
The same formulae may be applied to determining the conditions for star formation in giant molecular clouds. A local fluctuation in the density of such a cloud can lead to a runaway condition in which the cloud collapses inwards under its own gravity. Such a collapse occurs when the equipartition theorem—or, equivalently, the virial theorem—is no longer valid, i.e., when the gravitational potential energy exceeds twice the kinetic energy
:formula_56
Assuming a constant density for the cloud
:formula_57
yields a minimum mass for stellar contraction, the Jeans mass 
:formula_58
Substituting the values typically observed in such clouds (, ) gives an estimated minimum mass of 17 solar masses, which is consistent with observed star formation. This effect is also known as the Jeans instability, after the British physicist James Hopwood Jeans who published it in 1902.

==Derivations==

===Kinetic energies and the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution===
The original formulation of the equipartition theorem states that, in any physical system in thermal equilibrium, every particle has exactly the same average translational kinetic energy, . However, this is true only for ideal gas, and the same result can be derived from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. First, we choose to consider only the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of velocity of the z-component
:formula_59

with this equation, we can calculate the mean square velocity of the -component
:formula_60

Since different components of velocity are independent of each other, the average translational kinetic energy is given by
:formula_61

Notice, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution should not be confused with the Boltzmann distribution, which the former can be derived from the latter by assuming the energy of a particle is equal to its translational kinetic energy.

As stated by the equipartition theorem. The same result can also be obtained by averaging the particle energy using the probability of finding the particle in certain quantum energy state.

===Quadratic energies and the partition function===
More generally, the equipartition theorem states that any degree of freedom which appears in the total energy only as a simple quadratic term , where is a constant, has an average energy of in thermal equilibrium. In this case the equipartition theorem may be derived from the partition function , where is the canonical inverse temperature. Integration over the variable yields a factor
:formula_62

in the formula for . The mean energy associated with this factor is given by
:formula_63

as stated by the equipartition theorem.

===General proofs===
General derivations of the equipartition theorem can be found in many statistical mechanics textbooks, both for the microcanonical ensemble and for the canonical ensemble.
They involve taking averages over the phase space of the system, which is a symplectic manifold.

To explain these derivations, the following notation is introduced. First, the phase space is described in terms of generalized position coordinates together with their conjugate momenta . The quantities completely describe the configuration of the system, while the quantities together completely describe its state.

Secondly, the infinitesimal volume
:formula_64
of the phase space is introduced and used to define the volume of the portion of phase space where the energy of the system lies between two limits, and :
:formula_65
In this expression, is assumed to be very small, . Similarly, is defined to be the total volume of phase space where the energy is less than :
:formula_66

Since is very small, the following integrations are equivalent
:formula_67
where the ellipses represent the integrand. From this, it follows that is proportional to 
:formula_68
where is the density of states. By the usual definitions of statistical mechanics, the entropy equals , and the temperature is defined by
:formula_69

====The canonical ensemble====
In the canonical ensemble, the system is in thermal equilibrium with an infinite heat bath at temperature (in kelvins). The probability of each state in phase space is given by its Boltzmann factor times a normalization factor formula_70, which is chosen so that the probabilities sum to one
:formula_71
where . Using Integration by parts for a phase-space variable the above can be written as
:formula_72
where , i.e., the first integration is not carried out over . Performing the first integral between two limits and and simplifying the second integral yields the equation
:formula_73

The first term is usually zero, either because is zero at the limits, or because the energy goes to infinity at those limits. In that case, the equipartition theorem for the canonical ensemble follows immediately
:formula_74

Here, the averaging symbolized by formula_75 is the ensemble average taken over the canonical ensemble.

====The microcanonical ensemble====
In the microcanonical ensemble, the system is isolated from the rest of the world, or at least very weakly coupled to it. Hence, its total energy is effectively constant; to be definite, we say that the total energy is confined between and . For a given energy and spread , there is a region of phase space in which the system has that energy, and the probability of each state in that region of phase space is equal, by the definition of the microcanonical ensemble. Given these definitions, the equipartition average of phase-space variables (which could be either or ) and is given by

:formula_76
where the last equality follows because is a constant that does not depend on . Integrating by parts yields the relation
:formula_77
since the first term on the right hand side of the first line is zero (it can be rewritten as an integral of &quot;H&quot; − &quot;E&quot; on the hypersurface where ).

Substitution of this result into the previous equation yields
:formula_78

Since formula_79 the equipartition theorem follows:
:formula_80

Thus, we have derived the general formulation of the equipartition theorem

:formula_81

which was so useful in the applications described above.

==Limitations==
===Requirement of ergodicity===
The law of equipartition holds only for ergodic systems in thermal equilibrium, which implies that all states with the same energy must be equally likely to be populated. Consequently, it must be possible to exchange energy among all its various forms within the system, or with an external heat bath in the canonical ensemble. The number of physical systems that have been rigorously proven to be ergodic is small; a famous example is the hard-sphere system of Yakov Sinai. The requirements for isolated systems to ensure ergodicity—and, thus equipartition—have been studied, and provided motivation for the modern chaos theory of dynamical systems. A chaotic Hamiltonian system need not be ergodic, although that is usually a good assumption.

A commonly cited counter-example where energy is &quot;not&quot; shared among its various forms and where equipartition does &quot;not&quot; hold in the microcanonical ensemble is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators. If the system is isolated from the rest of the world, the energy in each normal mode is constant; energy is not transferred from one mode to another. Hence, equipartition does not hold for such a system; the amount of energy in each normal mode is fixed at its initial value. If sufficiently strong nonlinear terms are present in the energy function, energy may be transferred between the normal modes, leading to ergodicity and rendering the law of equipartition valid. However, the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem states that energy will not be exchanged unless the nonlinear perturbations are strong enough; if they are too small, the energy will remain trapped in at least some of the modes.

Another simple example is an ideal gas of a finite number of colliding particles in a round vessel. Due to the vessel&#x27;s symmetry, the angular momentum of such a gas is conserved. Therefore, not all states with the same energy are populated. This results in the mean particle energy being dependent on the mass of this particle, and also on the masses of all the other particles.

Another way ergodicity can be broken is by the existence of nonlinear soliton symmetries. In 1953, Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou conducted computer simulations of a vibrating string that included a non-linear term (quadratic in one test, cubic in another, and a piecewise linear approximation to a cubic in a third). They found that the behavior of the system was quite different from what intuition based on equipartition would have led them to expect. Instead of the energies in the modes becoming equally shared, the system exhibited a very complicated quasi-periodic behavior. This puzzling result was eventually explained by Kruskal and Zabusky in 1965 in a paper which, by connecting the simulated system to the Korteweg–de Vries equation led to the development of soliton mathematics.

===Failure due to quantum effects===
The law of equipartition breaks down when the thermal energy is significantly smaller than the spacing between energy levels. Equipartition no longer holds because it is a poor approximation to assume that the energy levels form a smooth continuum, which is required in the derivations of the equipartition theorem above. Historically, the failures of the classical equipartition theorem to explain specific heats and black-body radiation were critical in showing the need for a new theory of matter and radiation, namely, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.

To illustrate the breakdown of equipartition, consider the average energy in a single (quantum) harmonic oscillator, which was discussed above for the classical case. Neglecting the irrelevant zero-point energy term since it can be factored out of the exponential functions involved in the probability distribution, the quantum harmonic oscillator energy levels are given by , where is the Planck constant, is the fundamental frequency of the oscillator, and is an integer. The probability of a given energy level being populated in the canonical ensemble is given by its Boltzmann factor
:formula_82
where and the denominator is the partition function, here a geometric series
:formula_83

Its average energy is given by
:formula_84

Substituting the formula for gives the final result
:formula_85

At high temperatures, when the thermal energy is much greater than the spacing between energy levels, the exponential argument is much less than one and the average energy becomes , in agreement with the equipartition theorem (Figure 10). However, at low temperatures, when , the average energy goes to zero—the higher-frequency energy levels are &quot;frozen out&quot; (Figure 10). As another example, the internal excited electronic states of a hydrogen atom do not contribute to its specific heat as a gas at room temperature, since the thermal energy (roughly 0.025 eV) is much smaller than the spacing between the lowest and next higher electronic energy levels (roughly 10 eV).

Similar considerations apply whenever the energy level spacing is much larger than the thermal energy. This reasoning was used by Max Planck and Albert Einstein, among others, to resolve the ultraviolet catastrophe of black-body radiation. The paradox arises because there are an infinite number of independent modes of the electromagnetic field in a closed container, each of which may be treated as a harmonic oscillator. If each electromagnetic mode were to have an average energy , there would be an infinite amount of energy in the container. However, by the reasoning above, the average energy in the higher-frequency modes goes to zero as &quot;ν&quot; goes to infinity; moreover, Planck&#x27;s law of black-body radiation, which describes the experimental distribution of energy in the modes, follows from the same reasoning.

Other, more subtle quantum effects can lead to corrections to equipartition, such as identical particles and continuous symmetries. The effects of identical particles can be dominant at very high densities and low temperatures. For example, the valence electrons in a metal can have a mean kinetic energy of a few electronvolts, which would normally correspond to a temperature of tens of thousands of kelvins. Such a state, in which the density is high enough that the Pauli exclusion principle invalidates the classical approach, is called a degenerate fermion gas. Such gases are important for the structure of white dwarf and neutron stars. At low temperatures, a fermionic analogue of the Bose–Einstein condensate (in which a large number of identical particles occupy the lowest-energy state) can form; such superfluid electrons are responsible for superconductivity.

<text>The Rootes Group was a British automobile manufacturer and, separately, a major motor distributors and dealers business. From headquarters in the West End of London, the manufacturer was based in the Midlands and the distribution and dealers business in the south of England. In the decade beginning 1928 the Rootes brothers, William and Reginald, made prosperous by their very successful distribution and servicing business, were keen to enter manufacturing for closer control of the products they were selling.

With the financial support of Prudential Assurance, the two brothers bought some well-known British motor manufacturers, including Hillman, Humber, Singer, Sunbeam, Talbot, Commer and Karrier.

At its height in 1960, Rootes had manufacturing plants in the Midlands at Coventry and Birmingham, in southern England at Acton, Luton and Dunstable, and a brand-new plant in the west of Scotland at Linwood. From its offices in Devonshire House, Piccadilly, in London it controlled exports and international distribution for Rootes and other motor manufacturers and its own local distribution and service operations in London, Kent, Birmingham and Manchester. There were assembly plants in nine countries outside the UK.

Rootes Group was under-capitalised and unable to survive industrial relations problems and losses from the 1963 introduction of a new aluminium-engined small car, the Hillman Imp. By mutual agreement, from mid-1964, Rootes Motors was taken over in stages by Chrysler, which bought control from the Rootes family in 1967. By the end of 1978 the last of the various elements of Chrysler UK had been sold to Groupe PSA.

==History==
===Dealer and distributor for other manufacturers===

Rootes was founded in Hawkhurst, Kent, in 1913 by William Rootes as a car sales agency independent from his father&#x27;s Hawkhurst motor business. Rootes had moved his operations to Maidstone by 1914 and there he contracted to repair aero engines. In 1917 he formed Rootes Limited to buy the Maidstone branch of his father&#x27;s motor business, founded by his father in 1897, to expand his aircraft engine repair business and the manufacture of aircraft parts.

In 1919 the distribution of cars and commercial vehicles resumed and operations extended to London and other part of the country. As early as 1924 Rootes had become the largest truck and car distributor in the United Kingdom. They advertised that their showrooms in Devonshire House, Piccadilly could supply new cars priced from £145 to £3,000 manufactured by Rolls-Royce, Daimler, Sunbeam, Austin, Hillman, Fiat or Clyno.

===Humber Limited===
A particular effort was put into overseas sales and it became clear the export opportunities warranted a move into car manufacture, which was achieved in 1929 by the purchase of controlling interests in first Hillman followed by Humber and Commer. Hillman and Commer were made wholly owned subsidiaries of Humber Limited and the Rootes brothers&#x27; holding eventually became 60 percent of the Humber ordinary shares. The Rootes brothers could now show their ability to manufacture handsome cars with a strong sales appeal.

===Humber Cycles===
There was a resurgence in domestic and export demand for pedal bicycles, and in February 1932 Raleigh acquired all the Humber cycles trade marks. Manufacture was transferred to Raleigh&#x27;s Nottingham works.

===Rootes Securities Limited===
Rootes Limited was renamed Rootes Securities Limited in 1933. During the Depression more businesses were picked up as they came available: Karrier (1934), Sunbeam (1934), Clement Talbot (1934) and British Light Steel Pressings (1937) were all bought and made subsidiaries of Humber Limited. London&#x27;s Mayfair coachbuilders and Rolls-Royce and Daimler dealers Thrupp &amp; Maberly had been bought in 1926 their royal warrant always proudly displayed.

===Rootes Limited and exports===
A new Rootes Limited was incorporated in 1933 to hold the very profitable core business of the Rootes brothers: the motor distribution and servicing functions, and its extension and development of export markets. It had been the largest truck and car distributor in the United Kingdom in 1924 and generated the capital to buy manufacturer Hillman, merge Hillman with manufacturer Humber and give the Rootes brothers control of Humber and the manufacturing subsidiaries they would have Humber buy.

Overseas representation of British motor manufacturers was not limited to group members.

===Ownership and control, Rootes family===
Rootes Motors Limited was the new name assumed 16 November 1949 of holding company Rootes Securities Limited. Substantially the whole of 1917&#x27;s initial capital had been provided by the two Rootes brothers. Thereafter the business&#x27;s expansion was financed by retained profits supplemented where necessary, for example the purchase of Hillman, by loans from Prudential and the company&#x27;s bankers principally Midland Bank. On 24 November 1949 shares in Rootes Motors Limited were issued to the public in exchange for £3,025,000. Rootes was now a public company and the new capital repaid the Prudential and Midland Bank loans. The listed shares however were preference shares. The equity capital remained in the hands of the Rootes family now with new partner Prudential who had taken up all of the offered £1,000,000 of ordinary shares. External shareholders continued to hold a large proportion of Humber Limited. The preference shares issued to the public by Humber remained listed. In addition there were external shareholdings in the Rootes Acceptances vehicle exporting business and in Automobile Products of India.

At this time employees totalled 17,000. Rootes owned, on average, about 80 per cent of the capital of its subsidiaries. The manufacturing subsidiaries were held through partly owned Humber Limited. Manufacture was carried out in three factories in Coventry with more at Luton, Cricklewood and Acton. There was a wholly owned assembly plant in Australia and similar facilities owned with associates in Argentina, Republic of Ireland and India. From Devonshire House in Piccadilly the original business, the marketing subsidiary, directed operations at five branches in Kent, their North Kensington service department and Birmingham and Manchester branches together with distribution companies overseas sometimes jointly owned.

Barely twelve months after listing preference shares the Rootes brothers recognised the effect death duties would have on their holdings and their businesses and the two brothers offered one quarter of Rootes Motors&#x27; ordinary shares to current holders of Rootes preference shares. Further issues of preference shares and debenture stock followed in November 1954 and November 1959. Rootes Acceptances Limited, the export financing arm, was sold.

===World War II===

With the outbreak of World War II, Rootes, like most other British car manufacturers, became involved with the production of armaments. In 1940, under the Government&#x27;s shadow factory scheme, Rootes built its massive assembly plant in Ryton-on-Dunsmore, near Coventry, initially manufacturing aircraft, one of the first types being the Bristol Blenheim. Production included a Royal Air Force heavy bomber, the Handley Page Halifax. These were built at a shadow factory at Speke Airport near Liverpool and at Blythe Bridge in Staffordshire from 1941 to 1943. Rootes also manufactured military vehicles, based on the Humber and Commer.

Rootes had a rare lapse of business judgement shortly after World War II. When he visited the Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg to evaluate it for war reparations, he opined that it – and the Beetle – had no value.

===Postwar acquisitions===
Tilling-Stevens with its subsidiary Vulcan Motors, both old-established and well-known commercial vehicle and bus manufacturers, was bought in the second half of 1950.
A new acquisition in 1956 was Singer Motors. Rootes&#x27; Singers, badge-engineered Hillmans, were aimed at slightly more upmarket small car buyers.

===Post-war development===

Following the war, Rootes also sponsored satellite manufacturing operations around the world, notably in Australasia (Rootes Australia) and the Middle East. The best known example of the latter was the Iranian-built Paykan, based on the Hillman Hunter. In 1950 it acquired Tilling-Stevens, a truck and bus manufacturer based in Maidstone, Kent.

Rootes successfully sold a range of cars priced at a slight premium to their major home market competitors, justified on the basis that they offered a level of superiority in design and finish.

Studebaker stylist Raymond Loewy was a design consultant to Rootes; evidence of his influence is most readily seen in the 1956 Audax range of cars, which included the contemporary Hillman Minx, a model also produced under licence by Isuzu of Japan as the Isuzu Hillman Minx.

===Engineering innovation===
Rootes introduced a novel supercharged diesel engine in 1954, based on a Sulzer Brothers concept. This was the Commer TS3 2-stroke 3-cylinder engine, with 2 opposed inward facing pistons per cylinder, which drove the crankshaft through bell cranks. The 3.25 litre engine developed , equivalent to contemporary 4-stroke diesel engines of more than twice the capacity.

The engine was used in Commer trucks as well as an industrial engine. Production ceased in 1968 after the Chrysler takeover.

===Range rationalisation===
Hillman when purchased had been making large cars. They introduced a straight-eight soon after Hillman became a subsidiary, but it was withdrawn as the Depression deepened. Their 2-1/2 and 3-litre cars were re-styled in the mid-1930s and renamed Humber Snipe and their small Minx was made the mainstay bread and butter member of the Rootes range. Sunbeam continued its sports appeal but downsizing postwar to small to medium-sized cars. Humber made the larger luxury passenger vehicles, Snipes and variants, and luxury mid-size cars ending with the compact Sceptre. The intervening break in medium-sized Humbers was filled by the postwar Sunbeams. Commer and Karrier were the commercial vehicle brands. Commer manufactured a full range of vans, trucks, tractors and bus chassis, and some badge-engineered small vehicles from the Hillman range. Karrier represented mainly municipal and special-purpose trucks, vans and buses, though towards the end included badge-engineered models from the Commer range.

===Sunbeam Tiger===
During the 1960s, Sunbeam&#x27;s Alpine convertible was moderately successful in the US market. Rootes considered that the Alpine&#x27;s sales would be improved with a more powerful model. As a result, in 1964 they introduced the Tiger, a V8 derivative powered by a Ford V8 engine. Carroll Shelby was involved in the development of the Tiger prototype.

A model followed in 1967, but few were built as it was considered inappropriate for a Chrysler vehicle to be powered by Ford. Consideration was given to installing a Chrysler V8 in the Tiger, but their engines were larger and heavier than the Ford engines, and the rear-mounted distributor would have required an unaffordable chassis design, given the limited sales.

=== Hillman Imp and the move to Linwood ===

In 1963, Rootes introduced the Hillman Imp, a compact rear-engined saloon with an innovative all-aluminium OHC engine, based on a Coventry Climax engine design (originally used for a fire pump). It was intended to be a response from Rootes to rival British Motor Corporation&#x27;s popular Mini, and a new factory (called the Linwood plant) on the boundary between Paisley and Elderslie, Renfrewshire was built for its assembly. The move to Linwood was forced upon the company by the British government, which had introduced the principle of industrial development certificates (IDCs) to build factories in depressed areas. The Linwood workforce had no experience in motor vehicle assembly and the build quality and reliability of the cars suffered. Another problem was that the component suppliers were still based in the Midlands, and the company incurred costs transporting half-finished engine castings from Linwood to be machined at Ryton and returned to Linwood once they had been assembled. Completed Imps returned south to Ryton, resulting in a round trip.

The Imp itself was underdeveloped, and the build quality and reliability problems, coupled with buyer apathy towards the design were reflected in poor sales. After a reasonably successful start in 1963–65, the Imp did not sell well. Lost production caused by frequent strike action at Linwood and escalating warranty claims left Rootes no money to develop other models.

===Competition history===

During the 1950s, Rootes&#x27;s promotion included a strategy of participation in major UK and European car rallies. Stirling Moss and Sheila van Damm were their top drivers, and the Sunbeam-Talbot 90&#x27;s win in the 1955 Monte Carlo Rally was the most significant victory.

In 1968, Rootes entered a factory team in the London-Sydney Marathon. Driving a Hillman Hunter, Andrew Cowan gained what was regarded as a surprise victory against stiff competition from other factory teams with bigger budgets.

===Business strategy===
William Rootes&#x27; particular business skills were in marketing. Rootes brothers&#x27; manufacturing business was best known for solid, dependable, well-engineered middle-market vehicles always of attractive appearance. Well-known Rootes models include the Hillman Minx, its successor the Hillman Hunter, the Humber Super Snipe and the Sunbeam Alpine.

William Rootes built the Rootes Group using specific brands for each market niche.

===Management succession===
Following the death in 1964 of Lord Rootes, his son, William Geoffrey Rootes, became the second Lord Rootes and became the new chairman of Rootes Motors. On 1 May 1967 Lord Rootes appointed Gilbert Hunt, a Wolverhampton-born business executive, who at the time was managing director of Massey Ferguson in the UK, to be the new managing director of the Rootes Group. Hunt&#x27;s appointment was made with the support of Chrysler, which was building its holding and control over the business during this period.

==Rootes&#x27; successors==
===Chrysler (1967–1978)===

In June 1964 Rootes Motors announced Chrysler would take a 30 per cent interest in their ordinary capital offering current shareholders double the market price and a 50 per cent share in the non-voting preference capital for almost three times market price. The purchase would leave control in British hands. On completion Rootes family holdings would still exceed those of Chrysler. The purchase was completed in October 1964. During 1966 the holdings were increased to 45 per cent of the ordinary shares and 65 per cent of the non-voting shares and in January 1967 holdings were increased to about two-thirds of Rootes Motors capital. It was renamed Chrysler UK on 30 June 1970.

It has been suggested that the demise of Rootes began with losses due to industrial relations problems at their BLSP plant in London, with knock-on problems down the supply chain. By the mid-1960s, Rootes was progressively taken over by Chrysler of the United States, following huge losses amid the commercial failure of the troubled Imp. The company&#x27;s financial year ran to 31 July, and in the year ended 31 July 1967 Rootes was able to report a pre-tax profit of just £3.8 million. It was the first reported profit since 1964 and compared with a pretax loss of £10.7 million in the year ending in 1966. Lack of funds for new model investment was a striking feature of the company&#x27;s final decade.

Chrysler was also keen to take control of the struggling firm as it wished to have its own wholly independent European subsidiaries like archrivals Ford and General Motors. Chrysler took over Simca of France and Barreiros of Spain at the same time, merging it with Rootes to create Chrysler Europe. In 1970, the Rootes name was replaced by Chrysler United Kingdom (correspondingly the French arm Simca was renamed Chrysler France at the same time), and subsequently disappeared from the public sphere. The various Rootes marques were progressively phased out during the 1970s. Only Hillman was left by 1977, when it, too, was shelved in favour of the Chrysler name. The Commer name was also phased out in the 1970s; the van and truck models mostly assuming the Dodge nameplate by 1976.

In &quot;Iacocca—an Autobiography&quot;, former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca was disparaging of the Rootes operation, writing that Chrysler should never have bought it. Chrysler UK continued with a range of rear-wheel-drive family cars such as the Hillman Avenger (introduced in 1970) and Hillman Hunter (introduced in 1966), while the Imp — which by now had most of its teething problems ironed out — was largely ignored by the new management. The Imp&#x27;s commercial chances were not helped by the launch of new imports in the early 1970s including the Fiat 127 and Renault 5, which not only showed that front engined, front wheel drive hatchbacks would become the industry standard format in the entry level market segment, but spearheaded an influx of popular imports.

In the late 1960s, Chrysler endeavoured to market the Rootes cars in the US. These efforts proved unsuccessful. Marketing in the US was impeded by an inability to offer cars for sale during part of 1968, as the Rootes cars could not comply with exhaust emission requirements.
In the early 1970s, with the rise of interest in sub-compact cars, Chrysler offered the Hillman Avenger in North America as the Plymouth Cricket. This attempt was aborted after only two years. At the same time, Chrysler&#x27;s Dodge Division offered the Dodge Colt as its subcompact, sourced from Mitsubishi in Japan. The Colt proved a popular and reliable car, hastening the Cricket&#x27;s demise.

However, Chrysler Fevre Argentina commenced manufacturing the Hillman Avenger-based Dodge 1500, and this car continued in production until 1990. During its last 10 years of production it was badged as a Volkswagen after that firm acquired Chrysler&#x27;s Argentine business. There was also a Brazilian variant until 1980.

By the early 1970s, Chrysler Europe was working on the development of two new family car ranges which would be produced at both its British and French plants, and sold under both the Chrysler and Simca marques on the relevant markets - similar to the integration of British and German model ranges which its rivals Ford and General Motors were carrying out at the time.

The Chrysler Alpine (sold in France as the Simca 1307/1308) was introduced in 1975, being produced at the former Rootes plant at Ryton as well as the former Simca plant at Poissy, near Paris. The Chrysler Sunbeam a three-door hatchback based on the Avenger floorpan, was introduced in 1977 as successor to the Hillman Imp. Also, Chrysler UK made a significant contribution to the design of Chrysler&#x27;s European range. As well as the Alpine and Sunbeam, there was the saloon derivative of the Alpine, the Talbot Solara (launched in early 1980 after Chrysler sold its European operations to Peugeot), and Chrysler/Simca Horizon. The Alpine and Horizon were both voted European Car of the Year on their launch, and the Horizon was the basis for the US Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni, which were very successful for Chrysler and continued in production in various guises for more than a decade.

The Imp was finally discontinued in 1976, and the Hunter followed it three years later (although it continued to be produced in Iran). Indeed, componentry for the Iranian version of the car was a successful UK export during the 1980s.
Only the Avenger-based Chrysler Sunbeam hatchback, launched in 1977 kept the Rootes lineage alive, although the Alpine name was still in use and later Alpine and Solara special edition models were given the old Rootes model names, Minx and Rapier. The rights to the Rapier name remained with the successors of the company, and were eventually resurrected again on a few limited edition Peugeot models. There was also a special Sceptre edition of the 205, 405 and the 605 SRi models. This used a black plastic badge with the chrome effect Sceptre cursive script similar to that on the sideflashes of the &#x27;60s saloons. In the case of the Peugeot cars, the Sceptre badging was applied to the bootlid and lower aft part of the front wing.

Chrysler had spent much of the 1970s unsuccessfully trying to integrate its Rootes and Simca ranges into one, coherent whole. The traditionally engineered, rear-wheel-drive cars of the British division had limited appeal outside the UK, although the Avenger and Hunter—the first locally assembled car to reach a total of 30,000 units sold in its 12-year lifespan—were both relatively successful in New Zealand. Hunter production continued there and in Ireland until 1979, and it was built in Iran by Iran Khodro as the Paykan for many years more.

Unfortunately, with its problems in the US, Chrysler did not have the capital to invest in refreshing their entire product range, and sales of the older designs stagnated in the face of more modern competition. Also, the production facilities were outmoded, industrial relations problems were persistent, and the products had a poor reputation for quality.

In the face of massive losses, and the risk of high unemployment in the surrounding areas if the factories closed, the Ryton and Linwood factories were the subject of frequent government bail-outs.

===Peugeot-Talbot (1978–2007)===
Despite the government assistance, the weight of problems bearing on Chrysler Europe resulted in its collapse in 1977, leading to the company&#x27;s 1978 takeover by PSA Peugeot-Citroen. PSA soon wielded the axe over the troubled Linwood factory in Scotland, and exhumed the Talbot marque from the pages of Rootes&#x27; history to re-badge the former Chrysler and Simca badged models. Whilst Ryton was saved, PSA took little interest in the heavy commercial vehicles and the former Commer/Dodge/Karrier truck and van factory was run in conjunction with the trucks division of Renault. After the withdrawal of the last Dodge-derived trucks (latterly badged as Renaults) it became an engine production plant for Renault Véhicules Industriels.
The first Rootes model to be discontinued under Peugeot&#x27;s ownership was the Hunter in 1979, and its production tooling subsequently went to Iran, where the Paykan went into local production, which continued until 2004. It remains a common sight throughout the Middle East, especially as a taxi. The closure of Linwood in 1981 spelled the end (in Europe at least) for the Avenger. Chrysler had retained the rights to the car, and continued its production in Argentina. The demise of Linwood also meant the demise of the Talbot Sunbeam after just four years in production. Its successor was the French built Talbot Samba, based on the Peugeot 104, and which went on sale in the UK in February 1982. By this stage, however, Peugeot was a year away from unveiling its highly acclaimed new 205 supermini, although it was originally planned that Peugeot would launch a Talbot badged supermini on the 205 platform as well as a Citroen some time around the mid-1980s.

The Simca-based models (the Horizon, Alpine and Solara) continued to be built at Ryton, using the resurrected Talbot badge from 1979. However, the Talbot-badged models declined in popularity over the next few years, with sales dropping from nearly 120,000 on the UK market in 1979 to around 25,000 in 1984, while at the same time the Peugeot brand was gaining ground thanks to the success of the 205.

By 1985 PSA had announced that it would abandon the three-marque strategy on passenger cars, and the Horizon replacement, developed as the Talbot Arizona, became the Peugeot 309 when it was launched in the autumn of 1985, and was the first Peugeot-badged car to be assembled at the Ryton plant. The Arizona&#x27;s styling was mismatched with the rest of the range, making it resemble an enlarged Simca 1108. The Talbot badge was discontinued on passenger cars, with the Alpine, Solara and Samba all finishing production in May 1986, and the last Horizon models leaving the production lines in Spain and Finland a year later. The Talbot brand survived on the Express van - part of a venture between Peugeot and Fiat - until 1994.

The Ryton plant was initially retained and went on to assemble the Peugeot 405 alongside the 309 from 1987, as well as the 309&#x27;s successor (the Peugeot 306) from late 1992, and finally the Peugeot 206 from 1998.
Ryton began assembling its last Peugeot, the 206, in 1998. At the height of the car&#x27;s success, the plant was working at capacity to satisfy demand. Ryton&#x27;s importance in PSA&#x27;s overall strategy was as an assembly operation with limited production capacity compared to PSA&#x27;s main factories in France and Spain - particularly as its location between two main roads made expansion impossible.

In April 2006, after years of speculation surrounding Ryton&#x27;s future, the PSA Group announced that production of the Peugeot 206 would be shifted to Slovakia and the Ryton plant would close within the next year.

Production at the plant ceased on 12 December 2006. It marked the end of nearly 60 years of car manufacturing at Ryton, and severed the motor industry&#x27;s final remaining direct link with the Rootes Group. More than 2,000 jobs were lost as a result of the factory&#x27;s closure. It was demolished soon after. The only physical remnant of the Rootes Group still in existence is the Whitley research and development centre - originally established during the Chrysler era, but subsequently sold by PSA and is now owned by Jaguar Land Rover.

The intellectual property owned by the former Rootes Group (including dormant marque and model names) was divided up between Chrysler and PSA Peugeot-Citroën following the divestment of the company&#x27;s assets in 1978; and still appear from time to time on both companies&#x27; products - for example Peugeot has used the names Minx, Rapier and Sceptre on various occasions, and on one occasion considered a second resurrection of the Talbot marque as a new budget brand - whilst Chrysler has reused the Avenger nameplate on the Dodge Avenger, and more recently on the Jeep Avenger in 2023.

In 2021 the successors of both conglomerates, namely Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and PSA Group merged to form Stellantis - effectively bringing together the surviving fragments of the Rootes Group back under one umbrella.

==Commemorations==

Maidstone, where William Rootes set up his business in 1914, managed to keep the Rootes name on their building until 2007. Built in 1938-39 for Rootes it is listed Grade II. On 1 January 2007, in line with the other 40 dealerships within its business group, the name was changed from Rootes Maidstone, to Robins &amp; Day Maidstone. Robins &amp; Day is wholly owned and operated by Peugeot UK, as opposed to many car dealerships which are franchises. As of April 2020 it is being converted into luxury penthouses and will be completed in 2024.

Rootes&#x27; contribution to Coventry&#x27;s history is commemorated by the University of Warwick in the naming of Rootes Hall, one of its largest halls of residence, on the main campus site on the outskirts of Coventry.

The name lives on in the short access to the Rootes Estate, a housing estate built in the early 1990s on most of the Ladbroke Grove site of the Clément-Talbot car factory. The main access to the redevelopment, Shrewsbury Street, is named after the founder of Clément-Talbot, Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 20th Earl of Shrewsbury. Soon after the Second World War the group of Clément-Talbot factory buildings was converted to a Rootes Group London administration and service depot which was later bought by Warwick Wright. One of the original buildings remains, the Talbot administration block now known as Ladbroke Hall, with the earl&#x27;s crest high above its main entrance. A tenant, Sunbeam studios, is named after the Sunbeam-Talbot car briefly produced there from 1938 to 1939 and 1945 to 1946. In the housing area there are short links one named Humber Drive and a Hillman Drive each side of a small park and there is a Sunbeam Crescent.

<doc id="516137" wikidata="Q14684510" url="?curid=516137" title="Fraser River (Colorado)">
<text>The Fraser River is a tributary of the Colorado River, approximately long, in north central Colorado in the United States. It drains a large portion of the Middle Park basin in Grand County in the Rocky Mountains west of Boulder and southwest of Rocky Mountain National Park. It rises at the continental divide on the north side of Berthoud Pass in the Arapaho National Forest. It flows NNW past Winter Park, Fraser, and Tabernash, and joins the Colorado River from the south two miles west of Granby.

==Fishing==
The Fraser holds wild rainbows, browns, brooks, and cutthroats. The Fraser River starts near Berthoud Pass. As it runs north for its first 8 miles, it is on National Forest land and is publicly accessible. The river is narrow and shallow here, but worthy of fishing.

From Winter Park to Fraser, the river can be accessed by the Fraser River Trail (hiking or mountain bikes), from USFS campgrounds, or road turnouts. The only exception is as the river flows through private land in the town of Winter Park. You can go fishing in the forested lands, or where the river starts into the valley.

Access to the Fraser River is limited downstream from the town of Fraser. Some of the best fishing is in the canyon downstream from Tabernash, however this is on private land.

<doc id="516138" wikidata="Q3961858" url="?curid=516138" title="Singularitarianism">
<text>Singularitarianism is a movement defined by the belief that a technological singularity—the creation of superintelligence—will likely happen in the medium future, and that deliberate action ought to be taken to ensure that the singularity benefits humans.

Singularitarians are distinguished from other futurists who speculate on a technological singularity by their belief that the singularity is not only possible, but desirable if guided prudently. Accordingly, they may sometimes dedicate their lives to acting in ways they believe will contribute to its rapid yet safe realization.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine describes the worldview of Singularitarians by saying &quot;even though it sounds like science fiction, it isn&#x27;t, no more than a weather forecast is science fiction. It&#x27;s not a fringe idea; it&#x27;s a serious hypothesis about the future of life on Earth. There&#x27;s an intellectual gag reflex that kicks in anytime you try to swallow an idea that involves super-intelligent immortal cyborgs, but... while the Singularity appears to be, on the face of it, preposterous, it&#x27;s an idea that rewards sober, careful evaluation&quot;.

==Definition==
The term &quot;Singularitarian&quot; was originally defined by Extropian thinker Mark Plus (Mark Potts) in 1991 to mean &quot;one who believes the concept of a Singularity&quot;. This term has since been redefined to mean &quot;Singularity activist&quot; or &quot;friend of the Singularity&quot;; that is, one who acts so as to bring about the singularity. 

Singularitarianism can also be thought of as an orientation or an outlook that prefers the enhancement of human intelligence as a specific transhumanist goal instead of focusing on specific technologies such as A.I. There are also definitions that identify a singularitarian as an activist or a friend of the concept of singularity, that is, one who acts so as to bring about a singularity. Some sources described it as a moral philosophy that advocates deliberate action to bring about and steer the development of a superintelligence that will lead to a theoretical future point that emerges during a time of accelerated change.

Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil, author of the 2005 book &quot;The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology&quot;, defines a Singularitarian as someone &quot;who understands the Singularity and who has reflected on its implications for his or her own life&quot; and estimates the singularity will occur around 2045.

==History==
An early singularitarian articulation that history is making progress toward a point of superhuman intelligence is found in Hegel&#x27;s work, &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;. In 1993, mathematician, computer scientist, and science fiction author Vernor Vinge hypothesized that the moment might come when technology will allow &quot;creation of entities with greater than human intelligence&quot; and used the term &quot;the Singularity&quot; to describe this moment. He suggested that the singularity may pose an existential risk for humanity, and that it could happen through one of four means:

#The development of computers that are &quot;awake&quot; and superhumanly intelligent. 
#Large computer networks (and their associated users) may &quot;wake up&quot; as a superhumanly intelligent entity.
#Computer/human interfaces may become so intimate that users may reasonably be considered superhumanly intelligent.
#Biological science may find ways to improve upon the natural human intellect. 

Singularitarianism coalesced into a coherent ideology in 2000, when artificial intelligence (AI) researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote &quot;The Singularitarian Principles&quot;, in which he stated that a Singularitarian believes that the singularity is a secular, non-mystical event which is possible and beneficial to the world and is worked towards by its adherents. Yudkowsky&#x27;s conceptualization of the singularity offered a broad definition developed to be inclusive of various interpretations. There are theorists such as Michael Anissimov who argued for a strict definition, one that refers only to the advocacy of the development of posthuman (greater than human) intelligence. 

In June 2000 Yudkowsky, with the support of Internet entrepreneurs Brian Atkins and Sabine Atkins, founded the Machine Intelligence Research Institute to work towards the creation of self-improving Friendly AI. MIRI&#x27;s writings argue for the idea that an AI with the ability to improve upon its own design (Seed AI) would rapidly lead to superintelligence. These Singularitarians believe that reaching the singularity swiftly and safely is the best possible way to minimize net existential risk.

Many people believe a technological singularity is possible without adopting Singularitarianism as a moral philosophy. Although the exact numbers are hard to quantify, Singularitarianism is a small movement, which includes transhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom. Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil, who predicts that the Singularity will occur circa 2045, greatly contributed to popularizing Singularitarianism with his 2005 book &quot;The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology&quot;.

With the support of NASA, Google, and a broad range of technology forecasters and technocapitalists, the Singularity University opened in June 2009 at the NASA Research Park in Silicon Valley with the goal of preparing the next generation of leaders to address the challenges of accelerating change.

In July 2009, many prominent Singularitarians participated in a conference organized by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard (i.e., cybernetic revolt). They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They warned that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved &quot;cockroach intelligence&quot;. They asserted that self-awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls. Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions. The President of the AAAI has commissioned a study to look at this issue.

==Reception==
There are several objections to Kurzweil&#x27;s singularitarianism, and these even include criticisms from optimists within the A.I. field. For instance, Pulitzer Prize winning author Douglas Hofstadter argued that Kurzweil&#x27;s predicted achievement of human-level A.I. by 2045 is not viable. Even Gordon Moore, the namesake of Moore&#x27;s Law that predicated the notion of singularity, maintained that it will never occur. According to some observers, these criticisms do not diminish enthusiasm for singularity because it has assumed a quasi-religious response to the fear of death, allowing its adherents to enjoy the benefits of religion without its ontological burdens. Science journalist John Horgan provided more insights into this notion as he likened singularitarianism to a religion:
Kurzweil rejected this categorization, stating that his predictions about the singularity are driven by the data that increases in computational technology have been exponential in the past. He claimed that critics who challenge his view mistakenly take an intuitive linear view of technological advancement rather than accounting for that exponential growth.

<doc id="516142" wikidata="Q3098353" url="?curid=516142" title="Air India Flight 855">
<text>Air India Flight 855 was a scheduled passenger flight from Bombay (now Mumbai), India, to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. On 1 January 1978, the Boeing 747 operating the flight crashed into the Arabian Sea about off the coast of Bandra, less than two minutes after take-off, killing all 213 passengers and crew on board. An investigation into the crash determined the most likely probable cause was the captain becoming spatially disoriented and losing control of the aircraft after the failure of one of the flight instruments. It was the deadliest air accident both in Air India&#x27;s and India&#x27;s history until Flight 182 in 1985 and the Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision in 1996.

==Aircraft and crew==
The aircraft involved, manufactured in 1971, was a Boeing 747-237B named &quot;Emperor Ashoka&quot; and registered as VT-EBD. This particular 747 was the first aircraft of this type in the Air India’s fleet.

The flight crew consisted of the following people:
* The captain was 51-year old Madan Lal Kukar. He had joined Air India in 1956, and was experienced, having almost 18,000 flight hours.
* The first officer was 43-year-old Indu Virmani, a former Indian Air Force Wing Commander who joined Air India in 1976. He had more than 4,500 flight hours.
* The flight engineer was 53-year-old Alfredo Faria, who joined Air India in 1955 and had 11,000 flight hours, making him one of Air India&#x27;s most senior flight engineers at the time of the accident.

== Accident ==
The aircraft departed from Bombay&#x27;s Santa Cruz Airport (later Sahar Airport, now called Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport). The destination was Dubai International Airport in Dubai.

Approximately one minute after takeoff from runway 27, Captain Kukar made a scheduled right turn upon crossing the Bombay coastline over the Arabian Sea, after which the aircraft briefly returned to a normal level position. Soon it began rolling to the left, and never regained level flight.

The cockpit voice recorder recovered from the wreckage revealed that Captain Kukar was the first to notice a problem, when he said, &quot;What&#x27;s happened here, my instruments ...&quot; The captain was explaining that his attitude direction indicator (ADI) had &quot;toppled&quot;, meaning that it was still showing the aircraft in a right bank. First Officer Virmani, whose presumably functional AI was now showing a left bank (and not noticing the captain&#x27;s concern), said, &quot;Mine has also toppled, looks fine.&quot; It is believed that the Captain mistakenly took this to mean that both primary AIs were indicating a right bank, in effect confirming what he believed he was seeing. It was after sunset and the aircraft was flying over a dark Arabian Sea, leaving the aircrew unable to visually cross-check their AI instrument readings with the actual horizon outside the cockpit windows.

The Boeing 747 had a third backup AI in the center instrument panel between the two pilots, and the transcripts of the cockpit conversation showed Flight Engineer Faria telling the captain, &quot;Don&#x27;t go by that one, don&#x27;t go by that one...&quot; trying to direct his attention towards that third AI, or perhaps to another instrument called the turn and bank indicator, just five seconds before the aircraft impacted the sea.

The captain&#x27;s mistaken perception of the aircraft&#x27;s altitude resulted in him using the aircraft flight control system to add more left bank and left rudder, causing the Boeing 747 to roll further left into a bank of 108 degrees and rapidly lose altitude. Just 101 seconds after leaving the runway, the jet hit the Arabian Sea at an estimated 35-degree nose-down angle. There were no survivors among the 190 passengers and 23 crew members.

== Investigation ==
The partially recovered wreckage revealed no evidence of explosion, fire, or any electrical or mechanical failure; and an initial theory of sabotage was ruled out.

The investigation concluded that the probable cause was &quot;due to the irrational control inputs by the captain following complete unawareness of the altitude as his ADI had malfunctioned. The crew failed to gain control based on the other flight instruments.&quot;

US Federal District Judge James M. Fitzgerald, in a 139-page decision issued 1 November 1985, rejected charges of negligence against the Boeing Company, Lear Siegler Inc, the manufacturer of the altitude director indicator, and the Collins Radio division of Rockwell International, which manufactured the backup system in a suit related to the crash. Steven C. Marshall, the attorney for Boeing asserted that the crash had been caused by Captain Madan Kukar, who he said was &quot;flying illegally under the influence of diabetic drugs, a condition compounded by his alcoholic intake and dieting in the 24 hours before the flight,&quot; and not due to equipment malfunctions. The suit was dismissed in 1986.
