<text>Winterreise (, &quot;Winter Journey&quot;) is a song cycle for voice and piano by Franz Schubert (D. 911, published as Op. 89 in 1828), a setting of 24 poems by German poet Wilhelm Müller. It is the second of Schubert&#x27;s two song cycles on Müller&#x27;s poems, the earlier being &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; (D. 795, Op. 25, 1823).

Both were originally written for tenor voice but are frequently transposed to other vocal ranges, a precedent set by Schubert himself. The two works pose interpretative demands on listeners and performers due to their scale and structural coherence. Although Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s cycle &quot;An die ferne Geliebte&quot; (&quot;To the Distant Beloved&quot;) was published earlier, in 1816, Schubert&#x27;s cycles hold the foremost place in the genre&#x27;s history.

The cycle consists of a monodrama from the point of view of the wandering protagonist, in which concrete plot is somewhat ambiguous. After his beloved falls for another, the grief-stricken young man steals away from town at night and follows the river and steep ways to a charcoal burner&#x27;s hut, where he rests before moving on. He comes across a village, passes a crossroads, and arrives at a cemetery. Here being denied even the death on which he has become fixated, he defiantly renounces faith before reaching a point of resignation. Finally he encounters a derelict street musician, the only instance in the cycle in which another character is present. The mysterious and ominous nature of the musician, along with the question posed in the last lines, leave the fate of the wanderer open to interpretation.

The autograph manuscript of the cycle is preserved in the Morgan Library &amp; Museum.

== Authorship and composition ==
&quot;Winterreise&quot; was composed in two parts, each with twelve songs, the first part in February 1827 and the second in October 1827. The two parts were also published separately by Tobias Haslinger, the first on 14 January 1828, and the second (the proofs of which Schubert was still correcting days before his death on 19 November) on 30 December 1828.

The text consists of poems by Wilhelm Müller. Müller, a poet, soldier and Imperial Librarian at Dessau in Prussia (present-day east-central Germany), died in 1827 aged 32, and probably never heard the first setting of his poems in &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; (1823), let alone &quot;Winterreise&quot;. &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; had become central to the performing repertoire and partnership of Schubert with his friend, the baritone singer Johann Michael Vogl, who introduced Schubert&#x27;s songs to many people in their tours through Austria in the mid-1820s.

Schubert found the first twelve poems under the title &quot;Wanderlieder von Wilhelm Müller. Die Winterreise. In 12 Liedern&quot; in an almanack (&quot;&quot;) published in Leipzig in 1823. His intimate friend Franz von Schober had provided this book for him. It was after he set these, in February 1827, that he discovered the full series of poems in Müller&#x27;s book of 1824, &quot;Poems from the posthumous papers of a travelling horn-player&quot;, dedicated to the composer Carl Maria von Weber (godfather of Müller&#x27;s son F. Max Müller), &quot;as a pledge of his friendship and admiration&quot;. Weber died in 1826. On 4 March 1827, Schubert invited a group of friends to his lodgings intending to sing the first group of songs, but he was out when they arrived, and the event was postponed until later in the year, when the full performance was given.

Between the 1823 and 1824 editions, Müller varied the texts slightly and also (with the addition of the further 12 poems) altered the order in which they were presented. Owing to the two stages of composition, Schubert&#x27;s order in the song-cycle preserves the integrity of the cycle of the first twelve poems published and appends the twelve new poems as a &quot;Fortsetzung&quot; (&quot;Continuation&quot;), following Müller&#x27;s order (if one excludes the poems already set) with the one exception of switching &quot;Die Nebensonnen&quot; and &quot;Mut!&quot;. In the complete book edition, Müller&#x27;s final running-order was as follows:&quot;Gute Nacht&quot;; &quot;Die Wetterfahne&quot;; &quot;Gefror&#x27;ne Tränen&quot;; &quot;Erstarrung&quot;; &quot;Der Lindenbaum&quot;; &quot;Die Post&quot;; &quot;Wasserflut&quot;; &quot;Auf dem Flusse&quot;; &quot;Rückblick&quot;; &quot;Der greise Kopf&quot;; &quot;Die Krähe&quot;; &quot;Letzte Hoffnung&quot;; &quot;Im Dorfe&quot;; &quot;Der stürmische Morgen&quot;; &quot;Täuschung&quot;; &quot;Der Wegweiser&quot;; &quot;Das Wirtshaus&quot;; &quot;[Das] Irrlicht&quot;; &quot;Rast&quot;; &quot;Die Nebensonnen&quot;; &quot;Frühlingstraum&quot;; &quot;Einsamkeit&quot;; &quot;Mut!&quot;; &quot;Der Leiermann&quot;.Thus, Schubert&#x27;s numbers would run 1–5, 13, 6–8, 14–21, 9–10, 23, 11–12, 22, 24, a sequence occasionally attempted by Hans Joachim Moser and Günther Baum.

Schubert&#x27;s original group of settings therefore closed with the dramatic cadence of &quot;Irrlicht&quot;, &quot;Rast&quot;, &quot;Frühlingstraum&quot; and &quot;Einsamkeit&quot;, and his second sequence begins with &quot;Die Post&quot;. Dramatically, the first half is the sequence from the leaving of the beloved&#x27;s house, and the second half the torments of reawakening hope and the path to resignation.

In &quot;Winterreise&quot; Schubert raises the importance of the pianist to a role equal to that of the singer. In particular, the piano&#x27;s rhythms constantly express the moods of the poet, like the distinctive rhythm of &quot;Auf dem Flusse&quot;, the restless syncopated figures in &quot;Rückblick&quot;, the dramatic tremolos in &quot;Einsamkeit&quot;, the glimmering clusters of notes in &quot;Irrlicht&quot;, or the sharp accents in &quot;Der stürmische Morgen&quot;. The piano supplies rich effects in the nature imagery of the poems, the voices of the elements, the creatures and active objects, the rushing storm, the crying wind, the water under the ice, birds singing, ravens croaking, dogs baying, the rusty weathervane grating, the post horn calling, and the drone and repeated melody of the hurdy-gurdy.

== Opinions of Schubert&#x27;s intentions ==

Many have attempted to explain the reason Schubert composed &quot;Winterreise.&quot; A possible explanation is documented in a book by Elizabeth Norman McKay, &quot;Schubert: The Piano and Dark Keys&quot;: &quot;Towards the end of 1822 ... Schubert was very sick, having contracted the syphilis that inevitably was to affect the remainder of his life: his physical and mental health, and the music he was to compose.&quot; As detailed below, he worked on &quot;Winterreise&quot; as he was dying of syphilis.

In addition to his friend Franz von Schober, Schubert&#x27;s friends who often attended his &quot;Schubertiaden&quot; or musical sessions included Eduard von Bauernfeld, Joseph von Spaun, and the poet Johann Mayrhofer. Both Spaun and Mayrhofer describe the period of the composition of &quot;Winterreise&quot; as one in which Schubert was in a deeply melancholic frame of mind, as Mayrhofer puts it, because &quot;life had lost its rosiness and winter was upon him.&quot; Spaun tells that Schubert was gloomy and depressed, and when asked the reason replied,
&quot;Come to Schober&#x27;s today and I will play you a cycle of terrifying songs; they have affected me more than has ever been the case with any other songs.&quot; He then, with a voice full of feeling, sang the entire &quot;Winterreise&quot; for us. We were altogether dumbfounded by the sombre mood of these songs, and Schober said that one song only, &quot;Der Lindenbaum&quot;, had pleased him. Thereupon Schubert leaped up and replied: &quot;These songs please me more than all the rest, and in time they will please you as well.&quot;
It is argued that in the gloomy nature of the &quot;Winterreise&quot;, compared with &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot;, there is 
a change of season, December for May, and a deeper core of pain, the difference between the heartbreak of a youth and a man. There is no need to seek in external vicissitudes an explanation of the pathos of the &quot;Winterreise&quot; music when the composer was this Schubert who, as a boy of seventeen, had the imagination to fix Gretchen&#x27;s cry in music once for all, and had so quivered year by year in response to every appeal, to Mignon&#x27;s and the Harper&#x27;s grief, to Mayrhofer&#x27;s nostalgia. It is not surprising to hear of Schubert&#x27;s haggard look in the &quot;Winterreise&quot; period; but not depression, rather a kind of sacred exhilaration... we see him practically gasping with fearful joy over his tragic &quot;Winterreise&quot; – at his luck in the subject, at the beauty of the chance which brought him his collaborator back, at the countless fresh images provoked by his poetry of fire and snow, of torrent and ice, of scalding and frozen tears. The composer of the &quot;Winterreise&quot; may have gone hungry to bed, but he was a happy artist.

Schubert&#x27;s last task in life was the correction of the proofs for part 2 of &quot;Winterreise&quot;, and his thoughts while correcting those of the last song, &quot;Der Leiermann&quot;, when his last illness was only too evident, can only be imagined. However, he had heard the whole cycle performed by Vogl (which received a much more enthusiastic reception), though he did not live to see the final publication, nor the opinion of the &quot;Wiener Theaterzeitung&quot;:
Müller is naive, sentimental, and sets against outward nature a parallel of some passionate soul-state which takes its colour and significance from the former. Schubert&#x27;s music is as naive as the poet&#x27;s expressions; the emotions contained in the poems are as deeply reflected in his own feelings, and these are so brought out in sound that no-one can sing or hear them without being touched to the heart.
Elena Gerhardt said of the &quot;Winterreise&quot;, &quot;You have to be haunted by this cycle to be able to sing it.&quot;

== Nature of the work ==

In his introduction to the Peters edition (with the critical revisions of Max Friedlaender), Professor Max Müller, son of the poet Wilhelm Müller, remarks that Schubert&#x27;s two song-cycles have a dramatic effect not unlike that of a full-scale tragic opera, particularly when performed by great singers such as Jenny Lind (&quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot;) or Julius Stockhausen (&quot;Winterreise&quot;). Like &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot;, Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot; is not merely a collection of songs upon a single theme (lost or unrequited love) but is in effect one single dramatic monologue, lasting over an hour in performance. Although some individual songs are sometimes included separately in recitals (e.g. &quot;Gute Nacht&quot;, &quot;Der Lindenbaum&quot; and &quot;Der Leiermann&quot;), it is a work which is usually presented in its entirety. The intensity and the emotional inflections of the poetry are carefully built up to express the sorrows of the lover, and are developed to an almost pathological degree from the first to the last note, something explored (along with the cultural context of the work) by the tenor Ian Bostridge in &quot;Schubert&#x27;s Winter Journey: Anatomy of an Obsession&quot;. Over the course of the cycle, grief over lost love progressively gives way to more general existential despair and resignation – the beloved is last directly mentioned only halfway into the work – and the literal winter&#x27;s journey is arguably at least in part allegorical for this psychological and spiritual one. Wintry imagery of cold, darkness, and barrenness consistently serve to mirror the feelings of the isolated wanderer.

The two Schubert cycles (primarily for male voice), of which &quot;Winterreise&quot; is the more mature, are absolute fundamentals of the German &quot;Lied&quot;, and have strongly influenced not only the style but also the vocal method and technique in German classical music as a whole. The resources of intellect and interpretative power required to deliver them, in the chamber or concert hall, challenge the greatest singers.

== Editions ==
Besides re-ordering Müller&#x27;s songs, Schubert made a few changes to the words: verse 4 of &quot;Erstarrung&quot; in Müller&#x27;s version read [Schubert&#x27;s text bracketed]: &quot;Mein Herz ist wie erfroren [erstorben]&quot; (&quot;frozen&quot; instead of &quot;dead&quot;); &quot;Irrlicht&quot; verse 2 read &quot;...unsre Freuden, unsre Wehen [Leiden]&quot; (&quot;pains&quot; instead of &quot;sorrows&quot;) and &quot;Der Wegweiser&quot; verse 3 read &quot;Weiser stehen auf den Strassen [Wegen]&quot; (&quot;roads&quot; instead of &quot;paths&quot;). These have all been restored in Mandyczewski&#x27;s edition (the widely available Dover score) and are offered as alternative readings in Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau&#x27;s revision of Max Friedlaender&#x27;s edition for Peters. A few of the songs differ in the autograph and a copy with Schubert&#x27;s corrections. &quot;Wasserflut&quot; was transposed by Schubert from F minor to E minor without alteration; &quot;Rast&quot; moved from D minor to C minor and &quot;Einsamkeit&quot; from D minor to B minor, both with changes to the vocal line; &quot;Mut&quot; was transposed from A minor to G minor; &quot;Der Leiermann&quot; was transposed from B minor to A minor. The most recent scholarly edition of &quot;Winterreise&quot; is the one included as part of the Bärenreiter &quot;New Schubert Edition&quot;, edited by Walther Dürr, volume 3, which offers the songs in versions for high, medium and low voices. In this edition the key relationships are preserved: only one transposition is applied to the whole cycle.

The following table names the keys used in different editions.

== Enduring influence ==
Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot; has had a marked influence on several key works, including Gustav Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen&quot; and Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Night-piece&quot;. In 1991, Maury Yeston composed both the original music and text of &quot;December Songs&quot;, a song cycle influenced by &quot;Winterreise&quot;, on commission from Carnegie Hall for its Centennial celebration. In 1994 Polish poet Stanisław Barańczak published his poems, entitled &quot;Podróż zimowa&quot;, which – apart from one translation of a work by Müller – were inspired by Schubert&#x27;s music.
2020 Deutschlandfunk presents a new production of the Winterreise by Augst &amp; Daemgen. In the program Atelier neuer Musik it says: &quot;Hardly any other recording of the Winterreise cycle deals with Müller&#x27;s texts and Schubert&#x27;s music in such a radically different way than the reading of the composers and interpreters Oliver Augst and Marcel Daemgen. The focus of the arrangements is not the brilliantly polished beautiful sound of centuries-old traditional musical tradition, but rather its strict breakthrough in order to gain a new, undisguised access to the topicality of old texts and the core of the music.&quot;

<text>Michael Antonio Cimino ( , ; February 3, 1939 – July 2, 2016) was an American film director, screenwriter, producer and author. Notorious for his obsessive attention to detail and determination for perfection, Cimino achieved widespread fame with &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978), which won five Academy Awards at the 51st Academy Awards ceremony, including Best Picture and Best Director.

With a background in painting and architecture, Cimino began his career as a commercial director in New York before moving to Los Angeles in the early 1970s to take up screenwriting. After co-writing the scripts for both &quot;Silent Running&quot; (1972) and &quot;Magnum Force&quot; (1973), he wrote the preliminary script for &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot; (1974). The latter became his directorial debut and one of the highest-grossing films of that year.

The accolades received for co-writing, directing, and producing &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; led to Cimino receiving creative control of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980). The film became a critical failure and a legendary box-office bomb, which lost production studio United Artists an estimated $37 million. Its failure was seen by many observers as the end of the New Hollywood era, with studios next shifting focus from director-driven films toward high-concept, crowd-pleasing blockbusters. More recently, however, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; has undergone a dramatic reappraisal, even being named by BBC Culture as one of the greatest American films of all time.

Cimino made only four subsequent films and grew infamous for the number of projects left unfinished due to his uncompromising artistry. In 2002, Cimino claimed he had written at least 50 scripts overall. Several of his ambitious &quot;dream projects&quot; included adaptations of the novels &quot;Conquering Horse&quot;, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;Man&#x27;s Fate&quot; as well as biopics on crime boss Frank Costello and Irish rebel Michael Collins.

== Early life ==
Cimino publicly shared few details of his early life and family background and is believed to have given false birth year information. Many Cimino biographies thus include inaccuracies about his early years, as well as his background in filmmaking.

Cimino&#x27;s presumed birth date was February 3, 1939. A third-generation Italian-American, Cimino and his two younger brothers, Peter and Edward, grew up with their parents in the town of Westbury, on Long Island. He was regarded as a prodigy in early private education, but rebelled as an adolescent by consorting with delinquents, getting into fights, and coming home drunk. Of this time, Cimino described himself as
&quot;always hanging around with kids my parents didn&#x27;t approve of. Those guys were so alive. When I was fifteen I spent three weeks driving all over Brooklyn with a guy who was following his girlfriend. He was convinced she was cheating on him, and he had a gun, he was going to kill her. There was such passion and intensity about their lives. When the rich kids got together, the most we ever did was cross against a red light.&quot;

His father was a music publisher. Cimino says his father was responsible for marching bands and organs playing pop music at football games.
&quot;When my father found out I went into the movie business, he didn&#x27;t talk to me for a year,&quot; Cimino said. &quot;He was very tall and thin... His weight never changed his whole life and he didn&#x27;t have a gray hair on his head. He was a bit like a Vanderbilt or a Whitney, one of those guys. He was the life of the party, women loved him, a real womanizer. He smoked like a fiend. He loved his martinis. He died really young. He was away a lot, but he was fun. I was just a tiny kid.&quot;His mother was a costume designer. After Cimino made &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, she said that she knew he had become famous because his name was in &quot;The New York Times&quot; crossword puzzle.

Cimino graduated from Westbury High School in 1956. He entered Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. At Michigan State, Cimino majored in graphic arts, was a member of a weightlifting club, and participated in a group that welcomed incoming students. He graduated in 1959 with honors and won the Harry Suffrin Advertising Award. He was described in the 1959 &quot;Red Cedar Log&quot; yearbook as having tastes that included blondes, Thelonious Monk, Chico Hamilton, Mort Sahl, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright, and &quot;drinking, preferably vodka.&quot;

In Cimino&#x27;s final year at Michigan State, he became art director, and later managing editor, of the school&#x27;s humor magazine &quot;Spartan&quot;. Steven Bach wrote of Cimino&#x27;s early magazine work:
&quot;It is here that one can see what are perhaps the first public manifestations of the Cimino visual sensibility, and they are impressive. He thoroughly restyled the &quot;Spartan&quot;&#x27;s derivative &quot;Punch&quot; look, designing a number of its strikingly handsome covers himself. The Cimino-designed covers are bold and strong, with a sure sense of space and design. They compare favorably to professional work honored in, say, any of the &quot;Modern Publicity&quot; annuals of the late fifties and are far better than the routine work turned out on Madison Avenue. The impact and quality of his work no doubt contributed to his winning the Harry Suffrin Advertising Award at MSU and perhaps to his acceptance at Yale University.&quot;

At Yale, Cimino continued to study painting as well as architecture and art history and became involved in school dramatics. In 1962, while still at Yale, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve. He trained for five months at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and had a month of medical training in Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Cimino graduated from Yale University, receiving his Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1961 and his Master of Fine Arts in 1963, both in painting.

After graduating, Cimino moved to Manhattan and was given a job by Pablo Ferro with a small company that produced documentary and industrial films: &quot;They taught me how to use a Moviola. I operated the Moviola and swept the floors and I was hooked — I decided to become a filmmaker.&quot; During this time, he also took ballet classes and studied under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio once every week in order to better understand how actors performed.

==Career==
===1960s===

Within eighteen months of directing TV ads, he was hired by Madison Pollack O&#x27;Hare to work on special assignments involving &quot;graphic design concepts and unusual approaches to live film&quot;. While there, he handpicked the best cameramen MPO employed to shoot his commercials, including Gordon Willis and Owen Roizman, before either rose to fame. He directed ads for L&#x27;eggs hosiery, Kool cigarettes, Pepsi, Canada Dry and Maxwell House coffee, among others. &quot;I met some people who were doing fashion stuffcommercials and stills. And there were all these incredibly beautiful girls,&quot; Cimino said. &quot;And then, zoomthe next thing I know, overnight, I was directing commercials.&quot; Few of Cimino&#x27;s early commercial work survived.

One of his more successful commercials was shot for United Airlines in 1967. Taking a song called &quot;Take Me Along&quot; from the short-lived Broadway musical, he created an ad in which a group of housewives plead, musically, to their husbands to take them along on their business trips. The commercial is filled with the dynamic visuals, American symbolism and lavish set design that would become Cimino&#x27;s trademarks. Later that year, he made his most famous commercial; for Eastman Kodak, called &quot;Yesterdays&quot;, which went on to win several awards that year. The elaborate commercial took six days to shoot — two on an intricately built set in New York and four on location in Connecticut. Cimino apparently shot close to eight thousand feet of film, which was whittled down to 2 minutes. Although the ads he made were considered among the most prestigious in the industry, they became increasingly costly. &quot;The clients of the agencies liked Cimino,&quot; remarked Charles Okun, his production manager from 1964 to 1978. &quot;His visuals were fabulous, but the amount of time it took was just astronomical. Because he was so meticulous and took so long. Nothing was easy with Michael.&quot;

At the height of his commercial career, Cimino met Joann Carelli, then a commercial director representative, and the two began to date. Encouraged by Carelli, Cimino began to write screenplays, despite no background in writing. To be more prolific, Cimino sought out collaborators to work with, including poet Thomas McGrath and playwright Deric Washburn, who had produced a one-act play off-Broadway. Washburn later recalled that there was always a big distance, socially, between him and Cimino:

&quot;I remember trying to get to know him a little better. A friend had a house in Poughkeepsie, and I invited him up for the weekend. He shows up in his Rolls-Royce, and he&#x27;s not comfortable there. But he wanted something from me, I think. Mike and I got closest when we started talking about a story. Then it was amazing. It was like one person. It was like a dance. We could boil together.&quot;

Thomas McGrath and Cimino co-wrote two scripts together, &quot;Paradise&quot; and &quot;Kef&quot;. McGrath also gave Cimino a copy of the 1959 Frederick Manfred novel &quot;Conquering Horse&quot;, tracing the history of the Dakota Indians in America before the arrival of the white man, which Cimino would go on throughout the rest of his life to try and make into a film.

===1970s===
By 1970, Cimino&#x27;s agent Michael Gruskoff was approached with an offer from studio executive Ned Tanen to produce a slate of low-budget films for Universal Pictures, with &quot;Conquering Horse&quot; among them. The estimated budget for the film had gone far over what initially was projected, and would have cost Universal substantially more than their cut-off figure of $1 million to produce it. Moreover, Cimino wanted to shoot the film in black-and-white and use authentic Sioux dialogue, with subtitles. Shortly after the project was cancelled, Gruskoff assigned Cimino to help draft the script for a story outline by Douglas Trumbull for his science fiction film &quot;Silent Running&quot;, and he brought aboard Deric Washburn to help. The two morphed the script to be more countercultural. However, Steven Bochco was later brought in and rewrote the story to be less bleak and more &quot;accessible&quot; to a mainstream audience.

The following year, Cimino and Joann Carelli moved to Los Angeles where they rented a house in Hidden Hills that belonged to British director J. Lee Thompson. Carelli told Cimino that the only way he would be able to direct a film is if he wrote an original screenplay and got the biggest star in Hollywood to agree to be in it. Cimino, who had never written on his own, began by writing stories about people he knew about. From this habit, the script for &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot; was born, which first began as a period story about the Irish outlaw folk heroes Capt. Thunderbolt and Capt. Lightfoot. Cimino gained representation from Stan Kamen of the William Morris Agency, who urged him to make it a contemporary story. Taking both their advice, Cimino took the spec script to Clint Eastwood, who loved it and wanted to direct it himself. Cimino told him that it wasn&#x27;t for sale, and that he would have to direct the film or else there was no deal. Eastwood agreed, but under one condition: &quot;I&#x27;ll give you three days. If it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll get another director.&quot; He also asked Cimino to finish John Milius&#x27; script treatment for the Dirty Harry sequel &quot;Magnum Force&quot;, which had a set shooting date. When &quot;Magnum Force&quot; was in production, Cimino was looking at various locations in Montana and preparing for &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot;. &quot;We traveled a lot,&quot; said Cimino, &quot;especially around the Great Falls; in the banks of the Dearborn and the Missouri; in the fields of wheat, east of Great Falls.&quot; In the film, Eastwood plays an aging Korean War veteran who, in the words of Cimino, &quot;has lost his zest for life&quot; and runs into an &quot;exuberant, freedom-loving kid&quot; (played by Jeff Bridges), who restores his youth. Bridges, for his part, felt hugely unprepared for the role, but was quickly reassured:

&quot;Mike looked at me, and said, &#x27;You know that game Tag?&#x27; &#x27;Yeah,&#x27; I said. &#x27;Well... you&#x27;re it,&#x27; Mike told me. He went on to say that this guy, Lightfoot, was no one other than me, that I couldn&#x27;t make a mistake, or a false move, even if I wanted to. I&#x27;ve never forgotten that bit of direction that that young director gave me on his first movie, that gift of confidence.&quot;

George Kennedy and Geoffrey Lewis were also cast to star in the film, chosen for the primary reason that neither actor had ever done comedic roles before. Cimino had since compared their chemistry in the film to that of Laurel and Hardy. The film shot from July to September with a schedule of forty-seven days on a budget of $4 million. Cimino was careful to make Eastwood happy by keeping things moving quickly and efficiently. &quot;I knew that the only way I could keep control of the movie was to be ahead of schedule,&quot; he said. Eastwood was impressed enough with Cimino&#x27;s work that he allowed him to finish it his way. &quot;I owe such a debt to that man,&quot; he later said of Eastwood. The film became a solid box office success at the time grossing $25 million and earned Bridges an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

With the success of &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot;, Cimino landed a deal at United Artists to write and direct &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, based on Ayn Rand&#x27;s sprawling novel about an architect who refuses to compromise, which he had loved for years. He sent his script to Elliott Kastner, who was going to produce, and his first choice to play the character of Howard Rourk was Clint Eastwood. Taking its cue from more than the novel, Cimino&#x27;s modern-day adaptation was largely modeled off of architect Jørn Utzon&#x27;s troubled building of the Sydney Opera House, as well as the construction of the Empire State Plaza in Albany, New York. &quot;Making it a contemporary story meant that there was a lot of new work that had to be done [in adapting],&quot; he said. According to Cimino, Eastwood turned the film down over concerns of being compared to his idol Gary Cooper, who had played the same character in the 1949 film adaptation. Over the years he continued to try to get it made, approaching different funding sources with copies of the script and each time rewriting it in the process.

He then worked for a year and a half at Paramount Pictures on a film from his original screenplay &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;. Cimino described the film as a political love story that bore &quot;some resemblance to &quot;Casablanca&quot;, involving the romantic relationship of three people.&quot; The film was sold to the studio as &quot;a romantic &quot;Z&quot;&quot; and was to star Roy Scheider, Romy Schneider and Oskar Werner in the lead roles. Cimino said they had come very close to doing it:

&quot;We&#x27;d already shot two weeks of pre-production stuff, but because of various political machinations at the studio, the project fell through. This was just before David Picker left. He was the producer. There were internal difficulties, that&#x27;s all. Nevertheless, I&#x27;d spent a year and a half of my life on something. It had been a difficult time. My father passed away while I was writing the screenplay. I kept working...&quot;

Around this time he also spent two years developing two projects for 20th Century Fox. One film, &quot;Pearl&quot;, based on an unpublished book he wrote, was to be a musical biopic about singer-songwriter Janis Joplin. Cimino conceived the film&#x27;s story with producer Marvin Worth and collaborated on the script in association with Oscar-winning screenwriter Bo Goldman. The film was made several years later under a rewritten script titled &quot;The Rose&quot;, with Joplin&#x27;s name cut out after her family denied the producers the rights to her story. While Goldman received screenplay credit for his work, Cimino did not. Then, after meeting with James Toback, the two began work on &quot;The Life and Dreams of Frank Costello&quot;, a biopic chronicling four decades of the life of Mafia boss Frank Costello. Cimino saw the mobster as Gatsby; to him, he had a vision of America. &quot;We got a good screenplay together,&quot; said Cimino, &quot;but again, the studio, 20th Century Fox in this case, was going through management changes and the script was put aside.&quot; Cimino added, &quot;&quot;Costello&quot; took a long time because Costello himself had a long, interesting life. The selection of things to film was quite hard.&quot; He also did a rewrite for United Artists of Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s &quot;The Dogs of War&quot; to be directed by Norman Jewison, and was briefly attached to direct the film after Jewison left.

The film that came closest to production was an original for Paramount, titled &quot;Head of the Dragon&quot;, that was set in a &quot;mythical South American country&quot; and revolved around a polo-playing WASP who springs a Mafia killer from jail in order to assassinate a rebel leader. The project was described as Cimino&#x27;s desperate attempt to come up with something commercial that might stand a chance at being made. With location scouting and pre-production work already three weeks in, the film was cancelled, due to issues Paramount was having with their other big production, &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, which was being shot in the same country. A month later, in October 1976, Cimino took what he thought would be another routine meeting at a production studio, where he gave a 1-hour pitch (with no script), verbally, to EMI executives for his ambitious Vietnam War drama &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. To his surprise, they accepted his pitch and gave him a set start date of March 17, later postponed to June.
Derived from some of Cimino&#x27;s personal experiences, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; tells the story of three blue-collar steelworkers, portrayed by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who during the Vietnam War volunteer to serve together. Since he had to spend the next several months prepping for the film and scouting for locations, Cimino brought in Deric Washburn to help him write the film&#x27;s script. According to Cimino, he would call Washburn every night and feed him lines of dialogue and scenes to write. When Cimino returned, he was shocked with what he read, recalling that he felt it was written by someone who was &quot;mentally deranged&quot;. Washburn, who said he couldn&#x27;t handle the pressure in writing within the time constraint, left the project. From there, Cimino wrote the screenplay by himself within six weeks. &quot;I had to write the thing on buses, on trains, in cars, at night in hotels, I mean I worked like a dog.&quot; Despite this, Washburn received sole writer&#x27;s credit from the Guild after he went to a lawyer demanding arbitration. Roy Scheider was initially considered for the lead role, but after he dropped out, Cimino took the script to Robert De Niro, who insisted that he accompany him for the location scouting. The film also starred John Cazale, who at the time was dying of cancer and was therefore considered a liability by EMI. The steel town of Clairton, Pennsylvania used in the film was not shot there, but was instead composed of eight different towns in four states, including several in Ohio; Cleveland, Steubenville and Mingo Junction. Principal photography began in June 1977, but since the film took place during the winter, everything had to be defoliated; the grass had to be browned and the leaves stripped from the trees, which made the film fall behind schedule. Many locals from the various towns they shot in played minor roles in the film. &quot;They brought an exceptional characteristic to the film,&quot; Cimino said, &quot;[they] had certain facial expressions. You couldn&#x27;t create that in professional extras.&quot; For the deer-hunting sequences, Cimino had his crew assemble, paint and transport a prefabricated cabin up to the Cascade mountain range. He also specifically requested that wild deer be used, which they had to ship from a special game preserve in New Jersey. The Vietnam scenes were filmed on location in Thailand, on the River Kwai and near the Burmese border, and in Bangkok, where the conditions were arduous, doubling the film&#x27;s initial budget of $8 million to $15 million. Once there, Cimino advised De Niro, Walken and Savage that they sleep in their uniforms and never take them off, wet or dry, for the entire month. Because of the unstable political situation in Thailand and the subject matter of the material, Cimino had been warned not to fly the processed footage back in. Cimino agreed not to see any dailies on the condition that &quot;I am going to have every camera we have rolling all the time because there is no coming back here.&quot; As a result, the film took a whole three months just to view the footage that had been shot, and another three to edit it down. Cimino&#x27;s chosen length came in at almost three and a half hours. Universal initially wanted to cut it down to two hours, so that more daily showings were possible. &quot;If we had done that,&quot; said Cimino, &quot;We would have lost important things. The first places people attack are those scenes that involve character development. A film lives, becomes alive, because of its shadows, its spaces, and that&#x27;s what people wanted to cut.&quot; Despite its grim subject matter, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; performed well when it opened in December 1978, but quickly aroused controversy, particular for the film&#x27;s depiction of Russian roulette, which the characters were forced to play when captured by the Viet Cong. Even though he had never intended the film to be political (himself referring to it as a story of what happens to ordinary people when they experience tragedy), some critics felt that Cimino was making a &quot;right-wing statement&quot;, particularly with the film&#x27;s ending. Nevertheless, the film became a massive critical and commercial success, winning five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for Cimino.

The day after the Academy Awards, Cimino flew up to Kalispell, Montana to begin shooting his Western epic &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, where it had been in pre-production for several months; finding locations, casting five hundred extras and building complicated sets. Joann Carelli, who had been a production consultant on &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, was the sole producer of the film, despite no longer having a romantic relationship with Cimino. An ambitious take on the American Western genre, the film follows a Harvard graduate who becomes a federal marshal investigating a Government-sanctioned plot to steal land from European settlers in Casper, Wyoming. The origins of the project dated back to a script Cimino had written earlier in the &#x27;70s titled &quot;The Johnson County War&quot;, based on a rare bit of history he stumbled across when researching the development of barbed wire and its use in the American West. At that time, his script was shelved due to its failure to attract big-name talent, such as John Wayne, who turned down the lead role. Later, in 1978, after a print of &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; was screened for the head of production at United Artists, they offered Cimino a two-picture deal. What he wanted to do was &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, but UA showed disinterest. Instead, he resurrected his screenplay for &quot;The Johnson County War&quot;, which he promptly rewrote before it went into production in April 1979 with an assembled cast of Kris Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert and Christopher Walken. Cimino gave UA the initial budget estimation of $7.8 million, even though the period detail required for the film was astronomical. To authentically re-create the period, Cimino built an entire boomtown on the Montana location and transported a working steam locomotive from a Denver museum. He also had less time to prepare the film, since it was given a shorter pre-production period by United Artists to qualify for the December Oscar nomination deadline. Because each setup took such a long time to prepare, by the sixth day of filming the film was five days behind schedule. As with &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, Cimino was famously demanding of his cast and crew, including cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, whom he had liked working with before because of his &quot;obstinacy&quot; on set. Second assistant director Michael Stevenson since admitted that Cimino &quot;lost his temper sometimes when people tried to interfere,&quot; but that the cast loved working with him &quot;because Michael treated them with respect.&quot; When they weren&#x27;t performing, the actors would take lessons on how to ride a horse, how to practice their characters&#x27; trades and how to dance. Even the extras used in the film were all considered with great detail; carefully chosen, dressed and even redressed if Cimino felt it wasn&#x27;t right. They were also classified into specific groups of immigrants and merchants. &quot;The idea,&quot; explained Cimino, &quot;is that you must be able to look at any part of that immense screen and isolate from it any small piece according to your choice.&quot; Music arranger David Mansfield noted that the film&#x27;s immigrant settlers were constantly filling out the background of crowd scenes. &quot;Some bit character might be in the background while the lead actor is in the foreground. So you always see everybody in the community constantly, become familiar with them over the course of the picture.&quot; UA nearly ended up firing Cimino as the production budget continued to increase, with Norman Jewison or David Lean in mind to replace him. Ironically, a few years later, Cimino would be the first director approached to take over for Lean on the out-of-control production of &quot;The Bounty&quot;. Cimino, however, was intent on &quot;painstakingly constructing his film according to photographs from the time&quot; and immersing the audience into the world created in the film:

&quot;I wanted you to feel what it was like to walk down a street in that period: to follow those noisy wagons, to cross all that activity, what you felt, what you heard. People made so much dust; my God, was it dusty! That makes the streets dirty... when hundreds of wagons go around, they raise dust. And very often, we took the time to record the background sound. In the store, for example, we recorded numerous conversations, with the intention of inserting them into the soundtrack later. This isn&#x27;t general background noise; you hear people, in a corner, argue over the price of a knife, discuss the merits of a particular rifle... each of those people are engaged in a very specific activity and you hear them.&quot;

Shooting in Kalispell officially completed in October. By that point, $36 million was spent on the production. Cimino and Carelli then worked out a post-production schedule that would involve him delivering a film of three hours on May 1, 1980.

===1980s===

After editing the footage shot in Montana, filming for the &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; prologue and epilogue began in March 1980. A rough edit of the film ended up screening for United Artists in June, running over five hours long. On November 18, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; had its world premiere in New York City. &quot;I remember going to the New York premiere,&quot; said Jeff Bridges, one of the film&#x27;s stars. &quot;I&#x27;m not sure he [Cimino] had seen the movie complete; he was scrambling to put it together.&quot; In the 219-minute version that was shown, sound-editing problems in critical scenes made the plot hard for audiences to follow, and Cimino and cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond tinted the film &quot;with a kind of yellow glow&quot; that was supposed to give an antique look, later removed in the 2012 restoration. &quot;Afterward, we heard that terrible stuttering applause,&quot; said Bridges, &quot;and it was that sinking feeling. We tried to tell ourselves, &#x27;Well, maybe they liked it so much that they are stunned into silence.&#x27; &quot; The reviews were devastating. Before the film opened in Los Angeles, Cimino asked for it to be withdrawn and re-edited. In 1981, a shorter version was released, with added narration. A new poster campaign and a submission into the Cannes Film Festival slate did little to make a dent in financial losses. The failure of the film was also blamed for the collapse of United Artists, which was then sold by the Transamerica Corporation, having lost confidence in the company and its management. As a result, UA executive Steven Bach wrote an entire book devoted to the topic, &quot;Final Cut: Art, Money, and Ego in the Making of Heaven&#x27;s Gate, the Film That Sank United Artists&quot;. Cimino referred to the book as &quot;work of fiction&quot; by a &quot;degenerate who never even came on the set.&quot; Bach retorted when he told a reporter he didn&#x27;t resent Cimino or wish the movie ill: &quot;It would be like wishing ill of a corpse.&quot; With its scathing reviews and financial loss, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; quickly became a Hollywood legend.

Cimino intended to follow up &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; with &quot;Conquering Horse&quot; through his two-picture deal with United Artists, but was never realized after its failure. The film, based on the Western novel written by Frederick Manfred, would have been a generational saga set in pre-white America that dealt with a young Sioux boy&#x27;s rite of passage. &quot;It&#x27;s a story of the American Plains,&quot; said Cimino in 1982, &quot;[taking] place in the Dakotas and Montana.&quot; Also at this time, Cimino had been attached as the director of &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;, which he withdrew from when &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; was green lit, but vowed to return to once production ended. The film was first reported in 1979 as a Joann Carelli production, with Buck Henry making revisions to the script. However, by 1981, Martin Scorsese had already entered negotiations to direct. According to Cimino, in his version he would have cast Andy Kaufman in the lead role as Rupert Pupkin. &quot;I shot videotape of Andy for weeks,&quot; he said. His version was to have also starred Meryl Streep and Orson Welles.

Following &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, Joann Carelli quickly landed him a picture deal at CBS Theatrical Films to direct &quot;Nitty Gritty&quot;, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a black comedy about news reporting&quot;. The film was scheduled to be released in 1982, alongside a slate of films including &quot;Table for Five&quot;, however, Cimino&#x27;s never went into production, just as with several of the other reported projects. It was later listed as a lost project of Cimino&#x27;s by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, who reported that it had been retitled &quot;Live on Tape&quot; prior to being dropped by CBS. He also allegedly proposed his Frank Costello biopic, then retitled &quot;Proud Dreamer&quot;, to CBS with Robert De Niro in mind to star, but his script was rejected due to the project&#x27;s budget.

In early September 1982, Cimino approached short story writer Raymond Carver and his wife Tess Gallagher (both fans of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;) to rework a screenplay based on the life of Fyodor Dostoevsky, in hopes that he would direct it. According to Carver, Cimino presented him an existing screenplay commissioned by the veteran Italian film producer Carlo Ponti. The first draft had been written by Russian novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and then translated to English by two Italian writers. Heavily researched, and taking Dostoevsky&#x27;s near-execution as the film&#x27;s focal point, Carver and Gallagher opted to rewrite the entire script, delivering a 220-page draft to Cimino in November. Cimino was impressed with the results, but Ponti returned to Europe shortly thereafter, halting further development. Fragments were later published in 1985, by Capra Press.
In December 1982, after being unable to finalize a deal with director Herbert Ross at the time, Paramount Pictures offered the job of directing &quot;Footloose&quot; to Cimino. Producer Daniel Melnick warned him that if the film went over its budget of $7.5 million, Cimino would have to cover the expenses himself and he agreed. Cimino&#x27;s proposed reimagination of the film, &quot;a John Steinbeck inspired musical-comedy&quot; set during the Great Depression, was to have followed a rich girl from Houston who falls in love with a dancer from a shanty town. Working from Dean Pitchford&#x27;s original script, Cimino was at the helm of the film for several months, making more and more extravagant demands in terms of set construction and overall production. Just when the film was to begin shooting, he asked Melnick to let him rewrite the screenplay for an additional $250,000 and to delay the start date. Melnick fired him, and Herbert Ross directed &quot;Footloose&quot; instead. According to Melnick, &quot;It might have been a good film [if Cimino had directed], but it wasn&#x27;t the film we wanted to make. It wasn&#x27;t the film we came to the party with.&quot; Craig Zadan, one of the film&#x27;s producers, also stated, &quot;Cimino wanted to make a darker film. We wanted to make entertainment.&quot;

Several other unproduced projects followed, including a collaboration with Steven Spielberg and Gary David Goldberg on a script titled &quot;Reel to Reel&quot;, which he was going to direct for Columbia Pictures, and a second collaboration with Raymond Carver on a film which they gave the elliptical title of &quot;Purple Lake&quot;. The latter of the two was written partly from a CBS documentary found by Joann Carelli called &quot;VisionQuest&quot; which was the name of an unorthodox social program to rehabilitate delinquent teenagers by sending them on a wagon train across the Rockies. Cimino also apparently tried to revive his &quot;Fountainhead&quot; adaptation again, even attracting the interest of Barbra Streisand for the role of Dominique Francon.

In August 1983, after Ronald F. Maxwell was dismissed as the director of &quot;The Pope of Greenwich Village&quot;, Cimino was named as a possible replacement. Cimino wanted to finesse its screenplay with some rewriting and restructuring, which would have taken beyond the mandated start date for shooting. Instead, as a favor to the producers who were on a deadline, Cimino generously went over his copious notes written on the script with the new director they hired, Stuart Rosenberg. According to MGM president Freddie Fields, Cimino&#x27;s contributions to the film were invaluable; &quot;He&#x27;s been a terrific consultant.&quot;

In the summer of 1984, an old project Cimino had been attached to finally seemed to be moving toward production. The film was &quot;The Yellow Jersey&quot;, based upon a novel by Ralph Hurne about an aging, woman-chasing professional cyclist who nearly wins the Tour de France. The rights had been optioned back in 1973 by film producer Gary Mehlman, who then made a development deal with Columbia Pictures. In 1975, Cimino had been brought on board to direct the film and visited the Tour for the first time, for research. Over the next decade, the film generated expenses of nearly $2 million, and been in development with four studios and several independent production companies. Then, when Dustin Hoffman indicated an interest in starring in it, Mehlman took it back to Columbia in 1983. With Hoffman coming off the success of Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Tootsie&quot;, &quot;the film would have gone [into production] the moment he was ready,&quot; said Mehlman. By then, Colin Welland and Carl Foreman were brought aboard as scriptwriters, as well as Danish filmmaker Jørgen Leth (who had made the 1976 bicycle-racing documentary &quot;A Sunday in Hell&quot;), as Hoffman&#x27;s research adviser. Cimino said that production was long controlled by Foreman, who died in June 1984. The following month, Mehlman, Leth, Cimino, Welland and Hoffman went to France for the Tour, for yet more research. Shooting with the Tour de France was initially scheduled for 1980 and nearly every year since. Welland was still working on the script and hoped to have a draft by October of that year. It has been rumored that Hoffman fired Cimino from the production, although multiple sources claim that the deal simply &quot;fell apart with Cimino&quot;. After he exited, none of the replacement directors that Mehlman or the studio suggested were satisfactory to Hoffman, so he too left and the film continued to sink further into development hell.

After working on a script about the role of Chinese immigrants in the construction of the first transcontinental railroad in the American West, Cimino finally accepted Dino De Laurentiis&#x27; offer to adapt Robert Daley&#x27;s novel &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot; into a feature film, due to similarities in subject matter. Cimino accepted under the conditions that the book be nothing more than a point of departure, that he keep the freedom to tell the story his way and to change characters, and De Laurentiis agreed. Since the project already had a set start date for shooting, Cimino enlisted the help of Oliver Stone in writing the screenplay. The two apparently did over a year of research for the film, frequenting several Chinatown nightclubs and bars each night &quot;to insinuate ourselves into their life.&quot; &quot;With Michael, it&#x27;s a 24-hour day,&quot; Stone later said of working with Cimino. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t really sleep... he&#x27;s truly an obsessive personality. He&#x27;s the most Napoleonic director I ever worked with.&quot; At this time, Cimino was simultaneously doing extensive work for the production of &quot;The Yellow Jersey&quot;. Several actors were considered for the lead role of Stanley White, including Jeff Bridges, Christopher Walken and Nick Nolte. Cimino eventually settled on Mickey Rourke after collaborating with him briefly on the production of &quot;The Pope of Greenwich Village&quot;, as well as &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; several years prior. &quot;Mickey is a true original,&quot; Cimino said of Rourke, &quot;He&#x27;s like a slugger, a battler... Mickey&#x27;s like Joe Frazier and John [Lone] is like Ali.&quot; Cimino took note of the design of other Chinatowns throughout the world, and used the research to replicate New York&#x27;s Chinatown and Mott Street for a detailed backlot which was constructed in Wilmington, North Carolina. Since its construction, the set for the film has been re-used extensively for other Hollywood film productions. The street was re-created in such extraordinary detail that even Stanley Kubrick (who was born in the Bronx), thought it had been the real Chinatown. Cimino, who often liked to shoot interiors in one city and exteriors in another, also filmed parts in New York City, Toronto, Vancouver, Bangkok, Thailand and Chiang Rai. Confident that he&#x27;d deliver on time and within budget, Cimino had a wager going with De Laurentiis that if he didn&#x27;t go over budget, he would get the luxurious Mercedes that John Lone&#x27;s character drove in the film. If not, Cimino would forfeit $50,000 of his salary. &quot;It was four days over schedule, but $130,000 under-budget,&quot; said production manager Randolph Cheveldave, so Cimino collected. Upon its release, &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot; was sharply criticized for what many saw as offensively stereotypical depictions of Chinese Americans, but still managed to turn a profit at the box office. Afterwards, De Laurentiis signed a picture deal for Cimino to direct a film adaptation of the Truman Capote novella, &quot;Handcarved Coffins&quot;. De Laurentiis had planned to release the film in 1986 following his purchase of Embassy Pictures.

In 1986, Cimino accepted the deal to direct the adaptation of the best-selling Mario Puzo novel &quot;The Sicilian&quot;, after Dino De Laurentiis cancelled the production of &quot;Hand Carved Coffins&quot;. &quot;The Sicilian&quot; had been offered previously to directors Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, who all declined. At the time Cimino boarded the project, it initially had Michael Corleone set up as a character, but due to rights issues, all &quot;Godfather&quot; references were removed. There had already been a screenplay by Steve Shagan, but since Cimino felt the film needed more &quot;political bite&quot;, he brought aboard novelist Gore Vidal to help rewrite the script. Around 80 pages of material were added to Shagan&#x27;s initial draft, either by Cimino himself or Vidal, who later sued the Writers Guild for receiving no credit. According to film critic F. X. Feeney, Cimino&#x27;s first casting choice for Salvatore Giuliano was Daniel Day-Lewis, but since he was relatively unknown at the time, the producers suggested Christopher Lambert, whom Cimino accepted because his name guaranteed financing. During production, Cimino worked closely with Umberto Tirelli (a frequent collaborator of Luchino Visconti&#x27;s, whom Cimino admired) on the period wardrobe required for the film. Cimino had specifically requested that he work with him directly during the fitting, much to Tirelli&#x27;s chagrin, who exclaimed in rage, &quot;Goddamn it! I promised myself when Luchino died that I would never work this hard again!&quot; Cimino said this was the best backhanded compliment he ever received in his career. Filming began in Sicily that July, shot extensively in the capital city of Palermo as well as in the mountains of western Sicily. Soon after production ended in September, Cimino turned in his cut of the film, which ran over the agreed runtime of 105–125 minutes stipulated in his contractual obligation. When Gladden tried to re-edit the film, Cimino filed a lawsuit to stop them. Cimino&#x27;s contract granted him final cut privilege as well as two test screenings of his longer version, which he was never given. Cimino lost, and the film was released a year later, in October. When released in 1987, the film did poorly, but received some critical acclaim, notably by F. X. Feeney, who saw Cimino&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut, released only in France.

In 1987, before the release of &quot;The Sicilian&quot;, Cimino began work on an epic saga chronicling the life of the Irish patriot Michael Collins, based on a screenplay by Eoghan Harris. After disagreements with Harris over Collins as a character, his draft was heavily rewritten by Cimino with the assistance of Robert Bolt, which the two developed in London. Their script, now titled &quot;Blest Souls&quot;, was described by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;a love story set against the backdrop of the Irish rebellion&quot; and would have starred Gabriel Byrne in the lead role as Collins. Joann Carelli assisted with casting for the project; finding Sean Bean and Tilda Swinton to co-star. To inspire the mood of the film, Cimino spent countless hours reading the work of Irish poet W. B. Yeats. He also began scouting for locations in Edinburgh, Liverpool and in Ireland. While there, him and his team of production managers sought permission from the Irish Government to use their army for the production, which they got. Bono and Bob Geldof were also signed on to compose the music. The film was backed by Nelson Entertainment and would have re-teamed Cimino with his &quot;Deer Hunter&quot; co-producer Barry Spikings. David Puttnam of Columbia Pictures reportedly gave Cimino the green light to begin shooting, however due to the corporate meddling of Coca-Cola who wanted to go for something decidedly more mainstream, he would be forced to compromise his vision for the film. Instead, Cimino quit, and a separate script by Neil Jordan later resurfaced and was made into a film in 1996 starring Liam Neeson as Collins. Bolt later admitted he didn&#x27;t know what came of the project or their script: &quot;Yes, he [Cimino] fled back to America, and all of a sudden, that was that. I don&#x27;t know what happened.&quot;

Less than three weeks after the Collins biopic was cancelled, Cimino started pre-production work on &quot;Santa Ana Wind&quot;, a contemporary romantic drama set in L.A. offered to him by Barry Spikings. Budgeted at roughly $15 million, the set start date for shooting was early December 1987. The screenplay was written by Floyd Mutrux and the film was to be bankrolled again by Nelson Entertainment. Cimino&#x27;s representative added that the film was &quot;about the San Fernando Valley and the friendship between two guys&quot; and &quot;more intimate&quot; than Cimino&#x27;s previous big-budget work like &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; and the then unreleased &quot;The Sicilian&quot;. However, Nelson Holdings International Ltd. cancelled the project after disclosing that its banks, including Security Pacific National Bank, had reduced the company&#x27;s borrowing power after Nelson failed to meet certain financial requirements in its loan agreements. A spokesman for Nelson said the cancellation occurred &quot;in the normal course of business,&quot; but declined to elaborate. The film, also intended for distribution by Columbia, did not feature any major stars.

Cimino finished out his picture deal with Dino De Laurentiis in 1989 when Mickey Rourke suggested he direct the remake of the 1955 home invasion thriller &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot;. The film had been in preparation for several years with directors Christopher Cain and William Friedkin attached at different points. Rourke only agreed to do the film if Cimino would direct it due to his ability to transcend the material, &quot;Michael&#x27;s one of the few directors able to elevate beyond what an actor&#x27;s capable of doing.&quot; Since Alex Thomson was unavailable, Cimino enlisted the services of rookie cinematographer Doug Milsome, whom he got to know through Stanley Kubrick. While shot on 35 mm film, &quot;Desperate Hours&quot; is the first of Cimino&#x27;s works not to be photographed in his preferred Anamorphic aspect ratio. Principal photography began in October 1989 at Trout Lake near Telluride, Colorado. From there, the production moved to Salt Lake City. Like many of Cimino&#x27;s works, the film was shot in a variety of locations, mainly in Utah. Although Cimino was allegedly shooting from his own separate script, Writers Guild arbitration established that since the first draft by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal (along with the original author Joseph Hayes), was the one Cimino agreed to, his name was removed from the credit. The interior house from the film, which was also designed by Cimino, was built at the Ventura Entertainment Center in Orem, Utah, with fully constructed rooms in order to create a look and feel of claustrophobia. It was also designed &quot;with complete fluidity of movement, in any direction&quot; featuring hidden compartments and passages so that the camera could be placed anywhere throughout the house. According to Cimino, co-star Anthony Hopkins would often get angered by Rourke&#x27;s unprepared habits and improvisations on set: &quot;Mickey&#x27;s been shot in the head with Brando. This whole &#x27;I don&#x27;t have to know my fucking lines&#x27; thing. Tony Hopkins wanted to kill him.&quot; Filming wrapped that December, five days ahead of the schedule. De Laurentiis took a two-page ad in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; congratulating Cimino for finishing on time and within budget, dubbing the film &quot;a picture of shattering importance.&quot; After poor previews however, De Laurentiis apparently edited out several scenes, including an intense, eight-minute confrontation between Lindsay Crouse and Kelly Lynch in &quot;a huge, empty football field&quot; because test audiences &quot;read lesbian overtones&quot; into their relationship. Cimino&#x27;s original cut apparently lasted over two and half hours. The only known evidence of additional footage are from a few stills, which seemingly show a few of them.

===1990s===
In 1991, Cimino participated in that year&#x27;s Avoriaz Fantasy Film Festival, where he served as jury president and awarded director John Harrison with the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; for his film &quot;Tales from the Darkside: The Movie&quot;.

Following the poor reception of &quot;Desperate Hours&quot;, Cimino wrote an original screenplay called &quot;Heaven Is a Sometime Thing&quot; which he began submitting to studios circa 1992. It was conceived with Joann Carelli and told the story of a New Mexico mine-worker named C.J. who becomes a brilliant golfer and is estranged from his working-class waitress girlfriend when he meets an heiress and is taken up by high society. F. X. Feeney, who helped him with the script, compared it to the triangle of Montgomery Clift, Shelley Winters and Elizabeth Taylor in &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Cimino had developed the project at Paramount. He later resurrected the script and was able to publish it in France as a short novel.

Taking on &quot;writer-for-hire work&quot; in Hollywood, Cimino wrote an adapted script for Clint Eastwood&#x27;s Malpaso Productions from the 1993 novel &quot;Paradise Junction&quot;, which Eastwood would have either directed/starred in. He was also writing a script for filmmaker John Woo based on his story titled &quot;Full Circle&quot;, which Woo claimed would &quot;have a similar style to &quot;The Killer&quot;.&quot;

In the mid-90s, Oliver Stone encouraged producer Mario Kassar to help fund Cimino&#x27;s ambitious &quot;Conquering Horse&quot; project. However, as Stone recalled, &quot;He [Cimino] was too difficult to deal with. He was arrogant, and I don&#x27;t know that he ever gave it up. He never could eat humble pie or didn&#x27;t seem to.&quot;
In 1995, Cimino was approached by Regency producer Arnon Milchan to helm &quot;The Sunchaser&quot;, which would ultimately become Cimino&#x27;s last feature-length film. A spiritual road odyssey, the film stars Woody Harrelson as a Los Angeles doctor who is held at gunpoint by a teenage convict dying of abdominal cancer (played by Jon Seda), and forced to drive into Navajo Country in search of a sacred mountain lake with healing powers. The script by Charles Leavitt (which had been offered previously to Diane Keaton and Mel Gibson), was virtually rewritten by Cimino. Incorporating elements of his unproduced screenplays for both &quot;Conquering Horse&quot; and &quot;Purple Lake&quot; into it, the film had a personal resonance to Cimino; &quot;When I was very young, I was lucky enough to spend some time... with the tribe of the Dakota Indians,&quot; he said. &quot;I immersed myself so heavily in their culture that, in a way, it became my religion—a religion based on a very simple idea: a stone, a cloud, a rock, everything has spirit, is life. &quot;Sunchaser&quot; allowed me to return to this.&quot; Jack Nitzsche was the original composer but Cimino fired him after the two didn&#x27;t get on well. Instead, he hired Maurice Jarre, who orchestrated a bombastic, old-school score. &quot;The Sunchaser&quot; made its debut at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, where it screened in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or. However, unsupported by its distributor, the film was released theatrically only in a few theaters in the southwest, where it played for a week, grossing roughly $30,000 on a budget of $31 million.&quot;

Cimino was to follow the film up with &quot;An American Dream&quot; in 1997, about the first Asian immigrant to join Al Capone&#x27;s mob. Jason Scott Lee was attached to star and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; indicated that the film was to shoot in Chicago, San Francisco and South Korea. That same year, Cimino was reported to direct &quot;The Dreaming Place&quot; for Trimark Pictures. Originally titled &quot;Law of the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that the film, which was in the early stages of development, was to be a male vigilante story along the lines of Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Eye for an Eye&quot;. Rodney Patrick Vaccaro wrote the screenplay under the supervision of Cimino, and Jonathon Komack Martin was to executive produce the film. The planned budget was not revealed, however, it was Trimark&#x27;s attempt to make a bigger-budgeted film than usual which is ultimately why it was never produced. According to Vaccaro, he and Cimino apparently collaborated on two projects in total together over a period of four years.

In July 1997, Cimino served as president of the international competition jury at the 42nd annual Taormina Film Fest.

As early as 1997, Cimino was attached as the director of a film called &quot;Brasil 1500&quot;, planned to debut in the United States under the title &quot;Gonçalo&quot;, after the main character. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine incorrectly referred to the film&#x27;s title as &quot;1500&quot;. This Brazilian-American co-production intended to portray the events of the day of the arrival of Pedro Álvares Cabral&#x27;s flagship in Santa Cruz Cabrália on April 21, 1500. Written by first-time Brazilian scribe Fábio Fonseca, the film was to have been told through the eyes of a fictional character (similarly to &quot;Titanic&quot;), named Gonçalo, a Portuguese sailor from Cabral&#x27;s fleet. Antonio Banderas was eyed as a possible star, with a supporting cast planned to be composed largely of Brazilian natives. Cimino and producer Ilya Salkind were also interested in casting several British actors for the project, chief among them being Paul Scofield. A budget of $35 million was estimated, with principal photography initially set for January and February 1998. Filming was then pushed back to early 1999, for a planned release in 2000, coinciding with the 500th anniversary of the discovery of Brazil. That year, Cimino was in Brazil to choose sets and scout locations, which included Porto Seguro and Portugal. For research, he read the famous epic poem &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot;, about the discovery of a sea route to India. Speaking at a press conference in Lisbon, Cimino said that unlike the films made about Christopher Columbus&#x27; discovery of the Americas, this film would follow a young man as its protagonist, &quot;in a story very similar to that of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;,&quot; he said. He also claimed that an exact replica of Cabral&#x27;s flagship had been constructed for the production. The film was not made due to producers Ilya Salkind and Jane Chaplin&#x27;s failure to secure a deal with an international investor.

===2000s===
After &quot;Gonçalo&quot; was rejected by Warner Bros., Paramount and Disney, Cimino began to work on writing his first novel, titled &quot;Big Jane&quot;. Set in 1951, and 173 pages in length, the story follows a &quot;dynamite-looking, six-foot blonde who wears blue jeans, a Miss Universe of muscle,&quot; who travels by motorcycle across America and ends up fighting in the Korean War alongside a brigade of women. Initially conceived as a screenplay, &quot;Big Jane&quot; was meticulously translated from English to French and published on September 5, 2001, by publishing house Éditions Gallimard. Cimino later tried seeking interest from U.S. publishers, to no avail. He first appeared with the screenplay treatment (written in prose at novel length), at that year&#x27;s Venice Film Festival, where he conducted a staged reading from the piece and proclaimed that the next time he would return with a film made from the story. Cimino was then honored at Deauville, where he received the Prix littéraire Lucien-Barrière, an award that previously went to Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal. &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m the happiest, I think, I&#x27;ve ever been!&quot; he said in response.

In September 2001, it was reported that Cimino would return to the director&#x27;s chair to make &quot;Man&#x27;s Fate&quot;, a 3-hour epic set against the backdrop of the Chinese Revolution. Based on French author André Malraux&#x27;s 1933 novel, the film, as described by Cimino, was to have depicted &quot;the deep, emotional bonds that develop between several Europeans living in Shanghai during the tragic turmoil that characterized the onset of China&#x27;s Communist regime.&quot; The roughly $25 million project was to have been shot wholly on location in Shanghai in June of the following year and would have benefited from the support of China&#x27;s government, which said it would provide $2 million worth of local labor costs. The film&#x27;s producer, Mirko Ikonomoff was in early talks to pre-sell &quot;Man&#x27;s Fate&quot; to several European groups, including Italy&#x27;s RAI and France&#x27;s TF1, but failed in his attempts. Actors Johnny Depp, Daniel Day-Lewis, John Malkovich and Alain Delon were all in negotiations as possible stars for the project, as well as Uma Thurman or Nicole Kidman as the female lead. After failing to raise money elsewhere, Cimino took his script to Martha De Laurentiis who passed on it. &quot;If you edit it down, it could be a very tight, beautiful, sensational movie,&quot; De Laurentiis said, &quot;but violent, and ultimately a subject matter that I don&#x27;t think America is that interested in.&quot; Cimino however, felt differently, &quot;There was never a better time to try to do &quot;Man&#x27;s Fate&quot;,&quot; he said, &quot;because &quot;Man&#x27;s Fate&quot; is what it&#x27;s all about right now. It&#x27;s about the nature of love, of friendship, the nature of honor and dignity. How fragile and important all of those things are in a time of crisis.&quot; In a March 2002 interview for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Cimino called the screenplay &quot;the best one I&#x27;ve ever done,&quot; adding that he had &quot;half the money; [we&#x27;re] trying to raise the other half.&quot; Up until his death, Cimino tried to get the film off the ground several times, struggling to secure financing. In what would be his last interview in March 2015, Cimino had said he still hoped to make the film someday.

Cimino was attached to produce the independent film &quot;The Silk Curtain&quot; about Empress Dowager Cixi, who ruled China for 47 years until 1908. Consulina Wong was to have directed from her own screenplay, and was to have starred as Cixi. Jason Scott Lee was also considered for a role. Cimino said he was drawn to &quot;The Silk Curtain&quot; by the strength of the characters and &quot;the intimate story about their relationships played out against one of the most tumultuous periods in China&#x27;s history.&quot; The film was to have been produced by COJODA Productions, and a private reading was held at the Kumu Kahua Theatre in Honolulu in 2002, but the project failed to pique interest from potential investors.

In 2003, Cimino published his second novel, a two-volume work; the first a partially fictitious memoir called &quot;Conversations en miroir&quot; (English translation: &quot;Shadow Conversations&quot;) which he co-authored with Francesca Pollock, and the other a short story called &quot;A Hundred Oceans&quot;. The latter of the two Cimino adapted from his pre-existing feature-length screenplay &quot;Heaven Is a Sometime Thing&quot;. Neither this, nor his first novel &quot;Big Jane&quot; were released in the states. Cimino has mentioned in interviews that he wrote a third book called &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot; (named after the poem by W. B. Yeats), about a dying tycoon who reflects on his life. He began writing it as early as 1997, and it still to this day, remains unpublished. Cimino had apparently sent an early draft of the novel to a friend, requesting later that they burn their copy: &quot;I want to hear every page going into the incinerator.&quot;

In 2004, after Terrence Malick exited as director of the Che Guevara biopic, Cimino apparently pitched himself to direct it. Steven Soderbergh was eventually chosen as the film&#x27;s director.

In 2007, Cimino was asked by Cannes director Thierry Frémaux to contribute a 3-minute short segment for the collective film &quot;To Each His Own Cinema&quot;, celebrating the 60th year of the Cannes Film Festival. The project consisted of 34 short films by 36 acclaimed directors. Representing five continents and 25 countries, the filmmakers were invited to express &quot;their state of mind of the moment as inspired by the motion picture theatre&quot;. Cimino&#x27;s segment depicts a cigar-smoking French filmmaker who films a Cuban pop star&#x27;s music video in a movie theater. Later, when she is shown the footage, she is angered by his editing decisions and begins to strangle him. While spoken entirely in different languages, the film has no subtitles. But as its title, (&quot;No Translation Needed&quot;) suggests, they are not necessary.

===2010s===
In the early 2010s, French film producer Vincent Maraval worked on various projects with Cimino, none of which came to fruition. One film, an original screenplay by Cimino himself titled &quot;Cream Rises&quot;, followed the daily lives of two young female models, (whom Maraval compared to Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie) who are &quot;completely disconnected from reality&quot; and live a hedonistic life in Los Angeles filled with empty sex and boozing. Cimino wanted Taylor Swift to play one of leads, but since she was unknown at the time, Maraval passed on it. Halfway through the film, the more timid of the two girls is murdered and the other heads to the countryside to find her uncle, &quot;An old cowboy farmer with very Western values&quot;, whom Christopher Walken was to embody. &quot;It was something very contemporary,&quot; Maraval explained, &quot;About the world of today and its confrontation with the world of yesterday. As if the cinema of Cimino looked at the cinema of today. It was very moving.&quot; The script for &quot;Cream Rises&quot; was also read by the TV channel Arte, who were apparently &quot;enthusiastic&quot; about possibly investing.

Other projects Cimino worked on with Maraval later in his life include a feature adaptation of the Tennessee Williams short story &quot;One Arm&quot; as well as a film about the history of America from the point of view of the Native Americans.

At the persistence of Joann Carelli, Cimino meticulously supervised a restoration of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; frame-by-frame, for The Criterion Collection, where he restored the original film&#x27;s color. Cimino said, while at first hesitant to revisit the film, that his instincts quickly took over:

&quot;The minute I sat down at the editing console, something else in me took over, and my hands began to work. My brain began to work. And before I knew it, I was working on this restoration, which I swore I would not do... The more I worked on it, the more I became absolutely blown away by the commitment of people like Kris [Kristofferson], and Chris Walken, Isabelle Huppert, all the actors. The intensity that they brought to every moment that they were on film, and off film. I owe a great debt to them because they dedicated the better part of a year to this enterprise. And when we first showed it, of course, in New York, it was like we all got guillotined at the same time. And I was always especially upset at the fact that the actors&#x27; work was never recognized. You know, for some reason I was singled out.&quot;

In 2012, at the 69th Venice Film Festival, the restored director&#x27;s cut was screened and was met with a standing ovation. The film was also shown at the New York Film Festival, a return to &quot;the scene of the crime&quot; said Cimino, where it received subsequent acclaim, even being dubbed by critics as a misunderstood masterpiece. Cimino was deeply moved by the positive reception at the film&#x27;s re-release, &quot;All of those years, I felt like &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; was a beautiful, fantastically colored balloon tied to a string fastened to my wrist, so the balloon could never fly,&quot; he said.

Despite previous mentions of his distaste for the genre, Cimino revealed through his Twitter account in late 2012 that he had &quot;Recently finished a sci-fi script,&quot; but no further details were reported.

In 2015, he was awarded the Leopard of Honour at the Locarno Film Festival, for his life&#x27;s work achievement. After receiving the award, the following day Cimino took part in a discussion about his career in front of an audience in one of his last public appearances. When asked if he was working on another project, he replied, &quot;Always. I never stop. If you stop, you die.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Cimino was confirmed dead on July 2, 2016, at age 77, at his home in Beverly Hills, California. No cause has been disclosed officially to the public. Since his death, many directors, actors, and other public figures paid tribute to him, including Robert De Niro, Thierry Frémaux, Edgar Wright, William Friedkin, Paul Rust, Christopher McQuarrie, Kelly Lynch, Jason Reitman, Mark Romanek, Jay Baruchel, Mark Harris and Sophie Marceau. Film critic F. X. Feeney (a close friend of Cimino&#x27;s) wrote:
&quot;A few weeks before his death, Michael consulted a physician about a mild respiratory complaint but otherwise suffered no signs of ill health. When I last had lunch with him on June 19th, he was full of energy and plans. Nevertheless, because he was an intuitive man, I feel certain looking back that he had an inkling his life was drawing to a close. He took deliberate care to mend fences with as many people as he could in the last year of his life, and with me that last day he was more reflective than I&#x27;d ever known him to be about his early life. He was full of amused memories centered on his dad&#x27;s fierce perfectionism. Friends and loved ones found him impossible to reach after the 28th of June, and – when the police entered his house after several days – the officer who found him tucked in his bed described him as &quot;peacefully deceased.&quot; His heart had apparently stopped without trauma, in sleep. There was no funeral or public memorial thereafter, and he needs none. His monuments are onscreen.&quot;

His work has been lauded by such filmmakers as Stanley Kubrick, Agnès Varda, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Miloš Forman, Spike Lee, Olivier Assayas, Greta Gerwig, Steven Soderbergh, Brett Ratner, David Gordon Green, James Gray and Quentin Tarantino.

The director was the subject of the 2021 documentary &quot;Michael Cimino, un mirage américain&quot;, featuring audio recordings conducted by French critic Jean-Baptiste Thoret. Reflecting on the time he spent with him, Thoret said:

&quot;I understood that he [Cimino] had a terrible time inhabiting the present, the reality of the life of every day. Physically but also in his way of thinking: he was always elsewhere. Not in an ethereal or disconnected way. He was in a very precise past and therefore also a bit in a fantasy... he fantasized about a relationship with America, with John Ford.&quot;

Joann Carelli and her daughter Calantha Mansfield have been the proprietors of Cimino&#x27;s legacy following his death. According to biographer Charles Elton (who published a book on the late director in 2022), Carelli currently resides in Europe where she spends her time looking for funding for films based on some of Cimino&#x27;s unpublished writings.

==Other projects==
At some point between the releases &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot; and &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, Cimino attempted to write an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;.

In the month before he gave the pitch for &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, Cimino was briefly attached to helm James A. Michener&#x27;s adventure novel &quot;Caravans&quot;, set in contemporary Afghanistan. The film had spent roughly a decade in development before it was released.

In 1976, Cimino met Oliver Stone who offered him the chance to direct his script adaptation of &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (before the book had even been published), which he loved. Cimino declined however, as he was already doing extensive pre-production work for &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, but the two remained in touch and would collaborate on several other projects. A few years later, he met Stone again, who was optioning his screenplay for &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;. Al Pacino was attached to star as Ron Kovic. At that time, Cimino was eager to make another film about Vietnam and the stories of returning veterans, even going as far as to offer to work for free. However, the producer, Martin Bregman, declined. The film was later resurrected in 1989, and directed by Stone himself.

Sometime after Cimino finished post-production work on &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, he gave a &quot;unique pitch&quot; to direct &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. &quot;Everyone was pitching ideas for &quot;Star Wars&quot;,&quot; he said in 2012, &quot;Mine was simple: A straight Western, but with lasers.&quot;

It was rumored that Cimino had been in early discussions with producer Robert Stigwood to direct the adaptation of the musical &quot;Evita&quot; at EMI, after he had finished &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. However, following the disastrous reception of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; in New York and Hollywood, a spokesman with Stigwood claimed that Cimino had never been involved with &quot;Evita&quot; at any capacity and that they &quot;planned to seek a retraction from &quot;Time&quot; magazine,&quot; which had listed him as the film&#x27;s director.

Producer Dino De Laurentiis purchased the film rights to the horror novel &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; after Stanley Donen left the project as director, at Lorimar. De Laurentiis approached Cimino to direct, and was very briefly attached but was championed by author Stephen King to be replaced after disagreements over the rewriting of the script when King attempted to adapt it himself.

For a period of time in 1984, Cimino agreed to produce &quot;Platoon&quot; for Oliver Stone, with Emilio Estevez attached at that time to star as Staff Sgt. Barnes. Stone then signed on to co-write Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot; for Dino De Laurentiis under the condition that he would next finance &quot;Platoon&quot; as a result. Cimino moved on after the project fell through with De Laurentiis at MGM, and from there the script was passed to John Daly and released in 1986. According to Stone, it was Cimino who had encouraged him to bring back his script for the film when Stone had given up on it: &quot;He said &#x27;It&#x27;s going to come back&#x27;, and I&#x27;m glad he said that.&quot;

Around the same time he was doing &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot; for Dino De Laurentiis, Cimino had a deal to direct a biopic at Embassy Pictures based on the William Kennedy novel &quot;Legs&quot;. Mickey Rourke was attached to play the gangster Legs Diamond, and had told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1985 that, &quot;One side&#x27;s waiting for a rewrite, the other side&#x27;s waiting for the money for a rewrite,&quot; but felt that it still would be made eventually. Leonard Termo was also attached to the project, as Diamond&#x27;s bodyguard.

One of Cimino&#x27;s hopes since first arriving in Hollywood was to helm a big-budget, old-fashioned Hollywood musical loosely inspired by the &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; opera. In a 1985 interview for &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, Cimino said that he wanted to reimagine it as a romantic tale of a young, black Gospel-singing girl from the South (loosely based on Eva Jessye) who falls for a white Juilliard concert pianist (loosely based on George Gershwin). Together, the two struggle to stage a Broadway production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. In the same edition, Cimino discussed his love for the work of Ayn Rand, expressing interest in someday adapting her novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; for the screen, in addition to &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;.

==Influences and style==
===Influences===

Cimino has shown great admiration for Luchino Visconti, John Ford and Akira Kurosawa, dubbing them &quot;The Holy Trinity of movies.&quot; He has also praised the work of film director Vincente Minnelli and &quot;his attention to detail, especially in the musicals.&quot; He once named his literary influences as Vladimir Nabokov, Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Gore Vidal, Raymond Carver, Cormac McCarthy, the classics of Islamic literature, Frank Norris and Steven Pinker. Cimino also said that he liked to begin research for a new film by reading that country&#x27;s poets; Li Bo (&quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;) and W. B. Yeats (&quot;Blest Souls&quot;, unproduced).

In 1992, Cimino participated in the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; film polls. Held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, directors were asked to select ten films of their choice. Cimino&#x27;s choices were:

* &quot;The Leopard&quot; (Italy, 1963)
* &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; (USA, 1945)
* &quot;Ludwig&quot; (Italy/France, 1973)
* &quot;The Searchers&quot; (USA, 1956)
* &quot;La Strada&quot; (Italy, 1954)
* &quot;Children of Paradise&quot; (France, 1945)
* &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (USA, 1946)
* &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (Italy, 1960)
* &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot; (Italy, 1960)
* &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (Japan, 1954)
===Themes and style===
Cimino&#x27;s films have been noted for their controversial subject matter and striking visual style. Elements of Cimino&#x27;s visual sensibility include shooting in Anamorphic widescreen, painterly compositions, jittery tracking shots and wide vista establishing shots that emphasize the Earth&#x27;s landscape and nature. Cimino&#x27;s films are also slowly paced, focusing less on story and more on characters, allowing the viewer to observe their nuances and the setting. The subject matter in Cimino&#x27;s films frequently focuses on aspects of U. S. history and culture, notably disillusionment over the American Dream. Other trademarks include love triangles between main characters, sudden bursts of violence in seemingly tranquil or naturalistic settings and the casting of non-professional actors in supporting roles.

===Frequent collaborators===
Frequent collaborators of Cimino&#x27;s included actors Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, Jeff Bridges, Clint Eastwood, Geoffrey Lewis, Richard Bauer and Caroline Kava, writers Deric Washburn, Oliver Stone, Thomas McGrath, Rodney Patrick Vaccaro and Raymond Carver, producers Joann Carelli, Dino De Laurentiis and Barry Spikings, cinematographers Vilmos Zsigmond, Alex Thomson and Doug Milsome, composer David Mansfield, and assistant director Brian W. Cook.

==Public image==
Cimino developed a reputation for giving exaggerated stories about himself, his background, and his filmmaking experiences. &quot;When I&#x27;m kidding, I&#x27;m serious, and when I&#x27;m serious, I&#x27;m kidding,&quot; said Cimino in a 2002 interview. &quot;I am not who I am, and I am who I am not.&quot;

Following &quot;The Sunchaser&quot;, Cimino became more reclusive; spending the majority of the last two decades of his life retreating to his home in Beverly Hills where he wrote incessantly: &quot;Books and screenplays. Sometimes songs.&quot; He even claimed he kept track of how many pages he wrote day-to-day, &quot;One page one day, five the next. Sometimes zero. Those are the hard days because you still have to get your butt in the chair and keep writing.&quot; Cimino&#x27;s agent, Mike Wise, called him &quot;the Howard Hughes of Hollywood.&quot;

Due to his reclusive habits and fluctuations in his physical appearance, Cimino had several rumors circulating him over the course of his life, with people claiming he had dressed in drag, gotten plastic surgery, and even gone through a sex change.

Beginning in 1997, a columnist with &quot;Variety&quot; magazine devoted an item to dispelling unspecified &quot;reports&quot; that he had changed his name to &quot;Michelle&quot; and his gender via surgery. Cimino explained that he had not had nor intended to have a sex change and that he was not a cross-dresser, suspecting a former girlfriend of his to have started the rumors. His change in appearance was attributed to weight fluctuations, saying in 2002 that he&#x27;d gained weight while editing &quot;The Sunchaser&quot;; &quot;They&#x27;re always ordering food. You&#x27;re in there [the editing room] for twenty hours a day, seven days a week, getting no sleep.&quot; With the help of &quot;Sunchaser&quot; star Woody Harrelson, Cimino began fasting and lost roughly eighty pounds: &quot;He had me on fat-free foods, yoga, etcetera... I am now back to my college wrestling weight,&quot; said Cimino.

<text>The pelagic zone consists of the water column of the open ocean and can be further divided into regions by depth. The word &quot;pelagic&quot; is derived . The pelagic zone can be thought of as an imaginary cylinder or water column between the surface of the sea and the bottom. Conditions in the water column change with depth: pressure increases; temperature and light decrease; salinity, oxygen, micronutrients (such as iron, magnesium and calcium) all change. In a manner analogous to stratification in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the water column can be divided vertically into up to five different layers (illustrated in the diagram), with the number of layers depending on the depth of the water.

Marine life is affected by bathymetry (underwater topography) such as the seafloor, shoreline, or a submarine seamount, as well as by proximity to the boundary between the ocean and the atmosphere at the ocean surface, which brings light for photosynthesis, predation from above, and wind stirring up waves and setting currents in motion. The pelagic zone refers to the open, free waters away from the shore, where marine life can swim freely in any direction unhindered by topographical constraints.

The oceanic zone is the deep open ocean beyond the continental shelf, which contrasts with the inshore waters near the coast, such as in estuaries or on the continental shelf. Waters in the oceanic zone plunge to the depths of the abyssopelagic and further to the hadopelagic. Coastal waters are generally the relatively shallow epipelagic. Altogether, the pelagic zone occupies 1,330 million km3 (320 million mi3) with a mean depth of and maximum depth of . Pelagic life decreases as depth increases. 

The pelagic zone contrasts with the benthic and demersal zones at the bottom of the sea. The benthic zone is the ecological region at the very bottom, including the sediment surface and some subsurface layers. Marine organisms such as clams and crabs living in this zone are called benthos. Just above the benthic zone is the demersal zone. Demersal fish can be divided into benthic fish, which are denser than water and rest on the bottom, and benthopelagic fish, which swim just above the bottom. Demersal fish are also known as bottom feeders and groundfish.

==Depth and layers==
The pelagic zone is subdivided into five vertical regions. From the top down, these are:

===Epipelagic (sunlight)===

The illuminated zone at the surface of the sea with sufficient light for photosynthesis. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here, and marine life is concentrated in this zone, including plankton, floating seaweed, jellyfish, tuna, many sharks and dolphins.

===Mesopelagic (twilight)===

The most abundant organisms thriving into the mesopelagic zone are heterotrophic bacteria. Animals living in this zone include swordfish, squid, wolffish and some species of cuttlefish. Many organisms living here are bioluminescent. Some mesopelagic creatures rise to the epipelagic zone at night to feed.

===Bathypelagic (midnight)===

The name stems . The ocean is pitch black at this depth apart from occasional bioluminescent organisms, such as anglerfish. No plants live here. Most animals survive on detritus known as &quot;marine snow&quot; falling from the zones above or, like the marine hatchetfish, by preying on other inhabitants of this zone. Other examples of this zone&#x27;s inhabitants are giant squid, smaller squid and the [[

===Abyssopelagic (abyssal zone)===

The name is derived - a holdover from times when the deep ocean was believed to indeed be bottomless. Among the very few creatures living in the cold temperatures, high pressures and complete darkness here are several species of squid; [[echinoderm]]s including the [[basket star]], swimming cucumber, and the [[Scotoplanes|sea pig]]; and marine arthropods including the [[sea spider]]. Many species at these depths are transparent and eyeless.

===Hadopelagic (hadal zone)===
The name is derived from the realm of [[Hades]], the [[Greek underworld]]. This is the deepest part of the ocean at more than or , depending on authority. Such depths are generally located in [[ocean trench|trenches]].

==Pelagic ecosystem==
The pelagic ecosystem is based on [[phytoplankton]]. Phytoplankton manufacture their own food using a process of [[photosynthesis]]. Because they need sunlight, they inhabit the upper, sunlit epipelagic zone, which includes the coastal or [[neritic zone]]. Biodiversity diminishes markedly in the deeper zones below the epipelagic zone as dissolved oxygen diminishes, water pressure increases, temperatures become colder, food sources become scarce, and light diminishes and finally disappears.

===Pelagic invertebrates===
Some examples of pelagic invertebrates include [[krill]], [[copepod]]s, [[jellyfish]], [[Decapodiformes|decapod]] [[larvae]], [[hyperiid]] [[amphipod]]s, [[rotifer]]s and [[cladocera]]ns.

[[Thorson&#x27;s rule]] states that [[benthic]] [[marine invertebrates]] at low latitudes tend to produce large numbers of eggs developing to widely dispersing pelagic larvae, whereas at high latitudes such organisms tend to produce fewer and larger [[lecithotrophic]] (yolk-feeding) eggs and larger offspring.

===Pelagic fish===
Pelagic fish live in the [[water column]] of coastal, ocean, and lake waters, but not on or near the bottom of the sea or the lake. They can be contrasted with demersal fish, which do live on or near the bottom, and [[coral reef fish]].

Pelagic fish are often [[fish migration|migratory]] [[forage fish]], which feed on [[plankton]], and the larger [[predatory fish]] that follow and feed on the forage fish. Examples of migratory forage fish are [[herring]], [[anchovy|anchovies]], [[capelin]], and [[menhaden]]. Examples of larger pelagic fish which [[predation|prey]] on the forage fish are [[billfish]], [[tuna]], and oceanic [[shark]]s.

===Pelagic reptiles===
&quot;[[Yellow-bellied sea snake|Hydrophis platurus]]&quot;, the yellow-bellied sea snake, is the only one of the 65 species of [[Hydrophiinae|marine snake]]s to spend its entire life in the pelagic zone. It bears live young at sea and is helpless on land. The species sometimes forms aggregations of thousands along slicks in surface waters. The yellow-bellied sea snake is the world&#x27;s most widely distributed snake species.

Many species of [[sea turtle]]s spend the first years of their lives in the pelagic zone, moving closer to shore as they reach maturity.

===Pelagic birds===
Pelagic birds, also called &quot;oceanic birds&quot; or [[seabird]]s, live on open seas and oceans rather than inland or around more restricted waters such as rivers and lakes. Pelagic birds feed on planktonic [[crustacean]]s, [[squid]] and [[forage fish]]. Examples are the [[Atlantic puffin]], [[macaroni penguin]]s, [[sooty tern]]s, [[shearwater]]s, and [[Procellariiformes]] such as the [[albatross]], [[Procellariidae]] and [[petrel]]s.

<text>San Luis () is a province of Argentina located near the geographical center of the country (on the 32° South parallel). Neighboring provinces are, from the north clockwise, La Rioja, Córdoba, La Pampa, Mendoza and San Juan.

==History==

The city of San Luis was founded in 1594 by Luis Jufré de Loaysa y Meneses, but was subsequently abandoned. It was refounded by Martín García Óñez de Loyola in 1596 under the name &quot;San Luis de Loyola&quot;.

Since Argentina&#x27;s return to democratic rule in 1983, in particular, the Rodríguez Saá family (of Peronist affiliation) has occupied the governor&#x27;s seat. Former governor (now Senator) Adolfo Rodríguez Saá has overseen investment by light manufacturers (mostly food processors and bottling plants) and advances like the construction of Argentina&#x27;s most extensive expressway network. Since 2023, Claudio Poggi has been the governor of San Luis Province, a position he previously held from 2011 to 2015.

==Economy==

San Luis&#x27; economy has, over the past generation, been among the most improved in Argentina. Its 2006 output, estimated at US$3.386 billion, yielded a per capita income of US$9,203 (somewhat above the national average).

== Demographics==

Historical evolution of the population of the province:
== Government ==
The provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

==Political division==
The province is divided into nine departments (&quot;departamentos&quot;).

<doc id="522355" wikidata="Q7166844" url="?curid=522355" title="Per stirpes">
<text>Per stirpes (; &quot;by roots&quot; or &quot;by stock&quot;) is a legal term from Latin, used in the law of inheritance and estates. An estate of a is distributed &quot;per stirpes&quot; if each &quot;branch&quot; of the family is to receive an equal share of an estate in accordance with their deceased ancestor&#x27;s share. When an heir in the first generation of a branch predeceased the decedent, the share that would have been given to that heir would be distributed among that heir&#x27;s issue in equal shares.

Historically, per stirpes distribution occurred at the level of the generation closest to the deceased person, whether or not there were surviving heirs within that generation. That could result in an uneven distribution of an inheritance. For example, if two first cousins represent the first generation, one having three children and the other having one child, and they are deceased at the time of the distribution, the children of the first cousin would each receive one sixth of the inheritance (one third of their deceased parent&#x27;s half) while the children of the other cousin would receive half. The modern approach looks instead to the first generation with surviving heirs, which would mean that all four surviving children would each receive one quarter of the inheritance, a per capita distribution. The historic rule, where members of the same generation may inherit different amounts, is now often described as strict per stirpes. or the old English approach,

==Examples==

Example 1A: The testator &quot;A&quot;, specifies in their will that their estate is to be divided among their descendants in equal shares &quot;per stirpes&quot;. &quot;A&quot; has three children, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;. &quot;B&quot; is already dead, but has left two children (grandchildren of &quot;A&quot;), &quot;B1&quot; and &quot;B2&quot;. When &quot;A&quot;″s will is executed, under a distribution &quot;per stirpes&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; each receive one-third of the estate, and &quot;B1&quot; and &quot;B2&quot; each receive one-sixth. &quot;B1&quot; and &quot;B2&quot; constitute one &quot;branch&quot; of the family, and collectively receive a share equal to the shares received by &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; as branches (figure 1).

Example 1B: If grandchild &quot;B1&quot; had predeceased &quot;A&quot;, leaving two children &quot;B1a&quot; and &quot;B1b&quot;, and grandchild &quot;B2&quot; had also died leaving three children &quot;B2a&quot;, &quot;B2b&quot;, and &quot;B2c&quot;, then distribution &quot;per stirpes&quot; would give one-third each to &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;; one-twelfth each to &quot;B1a&quot; and &quot;B1b&quot;, who would constitute a branch; and one-eighteenth each to &quot;B2a&quot;, &quot;B2b&quot;, and &quot;B2c&quot;. Thus, the &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; branches receive equal shares of the whole estate, the &quot;B1&quot; and &quot;B2&quot; branches receive equal shares of the &quot;B&quot; branch&#x27;s share, &quot;B1a&quot; and &quot;B1b&quot; receive equal shares of the &quot;B1&quot; branch&#x27;s share, and &quot;B2a&quot;, &quot;B2b&quot;, and &quot;B2c&quot; receive equal shares of the &quot;B2&quot; branch&#x27;s share.

==Per capita at each generation==

Per capita at each generation is an alternative way of distribution, where heirs of the same generation will each receive the same amount. The estate is divided into equal shares at the generation closest to the deceased with surviving heirs. The number of shares is equal to the number of original members either surviving or with surviving descendants. Each surviving heir of that generation gets a share. The remainder is then equally divided among the next-generation descendants of the deceased descendants in the same manner.

Example 2A: In the first example, children &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; survive, so the estate is divided at their generation. There were three children, so each surviving child receives one-third. The remainder – &quot;B&quot;″s share – is then divided in the same manner among &quot;B&quot;″s surviving descendants. The result is the same as under &quot;per stirpes&quot; because &quot;B&quot;″s one-third is distributed to &quot;B1&quot; and &quot;B2&quot; (one-sixth to each).

Example 2B: The &quot;per capita&quot; and &quot;per stirpes&quot; results would differ if &quot;D&quot; also pre-deceased with one child, &quot;D1&quot; (figure 2). Under &quot;per stirpes&quot;, &quot;B1&quot; and &quot;B2&quot; would each receive one-sixth (half of &quot;B&quot;″s one-third share), and &quot;D1&quot; would receive one-third (all of &quot;D&quot;″s one-third share). Under &quot;per capita&quot;, the two-thirds remaining after &quot;C&quot;&#x27;s one-third share was taken would be divided equally among all three children of &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot;. (Two-thirds = six-ninths) Each would receive two-ninths: &quot;B1&quot;, &quot;B2&quot;, and &quot;D1&quot; would all receive two-ninths.

&quot;Notes:&quot;
*To give the effect indicated in these examples the clause should also include a provision that no beneficiary being a grandchild or more remote descendant will take a share if his or her parent is alive and takes a share.
*The spouses of the children (that is, spouses of &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;) are not considered. Spouses are not a part of the branch. Therefore, even if &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, or, &quot;D&quot; died leaving a spouse as well as children, all (100%) of the assets pass to the children and (0%) nothing passes to the spouses of &quot;A&quot;″s children &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;. From the example above, if &quot;A&quot;″s child &quot;B&quot; died before &quot;A&quot;″s death, &quot;A&quot;″s grandchildren &quot;B1&quot; and &quot;B2&quot; would each receive half of &quot;B&quot;″s share. Even if &quot;B&quot; had a living spouse at the time of &quot;A&quot;″s death, that person would receive nothing from &quot;A&quot;″s estate.

==Per capita with representation==
In many US states, a statute has modified the &quot;per stirpes&quot; approach and uses instead a per capita with representation approach (also known as modern American per stirpes). Under this approach, the number of branches is determined by reference to the generation nearest the testator which has a surviving descendant. Thus, in the first example, if &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; also are already dead, and each left one child, &quot;C1&quot; and &quot;D1&quot; respectively, then each of &quot;B1&quot;, &quot;B2&quot;, &quot;C1&quot; and &quot;D1&quot; would receive one quarter of the estate. This method is used in the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah, and West Virginia.

<text>Indium phosphide (InP) is a binary semiconductor composed of indium and phosphorus. It has a face-centered cubic (&quot;zincblende&quot;) crystal structure, identical to that of GaAs and most of the III-V semiconductors.

==Manufacturing==

Indium phosphide can be prepared from the reaction of white phosphorus and indium iodide at 400 °C., also by direct combination of the purified elements at high temperature and pressure, or by thermal decomposition of a mixture of a trialkyl indium compound and phosphine.

==Applications==
The application fields of InP splits up into three main areas. It is used as the basis for optoelectronic components, high-speed electronics, and photovoltaics

===High-speed optoelectronics===
InP is used as a substrate for epitaxial optoelectronic devices based other semiconductors, such as indium gallium arsenide. The devices include pseudomorphic heterojunction bipolar transistors that could operate at 604 GHz.

InP itself has a direct bandgap, making it useful for optoelectronics devices like laser diodes and photonic integrated circuits for the optical telecommunications industry, to enable wavelength-division multiplexing applications. It is used in high-power and high-frequency electronics because of its superior electron velocity with respect to the more common semiconductors silicon and gallium arsenide. 

=== Optical Communications ===
InP is used in lasers, sensitive photodetectors and modulators in the wavelength window typically used for telecommunications, i.e., 1550 nm wavelengths, as it is a direct bandgap III-V compound semiconductor material. The wavelength between about 1510 nm and 1600 nm has the lowest attenuation available on optical fibre (about 0.2 dB/km). Further, O-band and C-band wavelengths supported by InP facilitate single-mode operation, reducing effects of intermodal dispersion. 

===Photovoltaics and optical sensing===
InP can be used in photonic integrated circuits that can generate, amplify, control and detect laser light. 

Optical sensing applications of InP include 
*Air pollution control by real-time detection of gases (CO, CO2, NOX [or NO + NO2], etc.).
*Quick verification of traces of toxic substances in gases and liquids, including tap water, or surface contaminations.
*Spectroscopy for non-destructive control of product, such as food. Researchers of Eindhoven University of Technology and MantiSpectra have already demonstrated the application of an integrated near-infrared spectral sensor for milk. In addition, it has been proven that this technology can also be applied to plastics and illicit drugs.

<text>Susan Jane Powter (born December 22, 1957) is an Australian-born American motivational speaker, nutritionist, personal trainer, and author, who rose to fame in the 1990s with her catchphrase &quot;Stop the Insanity!&quot;, the centerpiece of her weight-loss infomercial. Powter has been described as a cross between Richard Simmons and Betty Friedan and &quot;the Lenny Bruce of Wellness&quot;. 

She hosted her own talk show &quot;The Susan Powter Show&quot; in the 1990s.

== Early life ==
Powter, who was born in Sydney, Australia, on December 22, 1957, immigrated to the United States at the age of 10. She left school in 9th grade, eventually obtaining a GED. In 1980, her family relocated to Dallas, Texas. A year later, she met her first husband, Nic Villarreal; they married in 1982 and had two sons. A month after giving birth to their second son, Powter discovered that Villareal had been having an affair. The couple separated in 1986 and Powter turned to food to alleviate her stress. She went from 130 pounds to 260. Powter turned to diet books and workout tapes and found neither to be helpful. She eventually managed to slim down to 114 pounds by walking and cutting out sugar and processed foods.

In Dallas, prior to her fitness career taking off, Powter worked as a topless dancer to pay her bills.

With the money she inherited after the death of her mother in 1988, Powter opened her own fitness studio in Dallas. In 1990, Powter approached Dallas publicity representative Rusty Robertson with hopes of promoting her business. Robertson was struck by Powter&#x27;s charismatic personality and began booking her on radio talk shows, eventually securing her a book deal. The pair put together an infomercial for Powter&#x27;s &quot;Stop the Insanity&quot; (based off of a catch phrase that would become her trademark) health and wellness kit, which reached an audience well beyond the Dallas area. The kit included audio cassettes, an exercise video, and recipes.

== Career ==
=== Television ===
In 1994, Powter starred in her own talk-show style television program called &quot;The Susan Powter Show&quot;, which ran for one season. On the show, she discussed nutrition and fitness, as well as other topics, with her guests. She was also a special guest on the first episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, titled &quot;Spanish Translation&quot;.

It was planned for Powter to become a regular on the television sitcom &quot;Women of the House&quot; in 1995. The series was cancelled after just one season with Powter appearing in one episode.

=== Motivational speaker and nutritionist ===
Advocate of a whole-foods, organic, low-fat diet, and regular cardiovascular and strength-training exercise, Powter also condemned the diet industry.

Her platinum-white close cropped haircut, aggressive speaking manner, and habit of being barefoot while speaking in public became elements of her celebrity.

Powter was originally based in Dallas, Texas, at the height of her fame. In 2012, she moved into an earthship-style home in Taos, New Mexico. More recently, she lived in Las Vegas, New Mexico.

=== Author and blogger ===
Powter is an author of several books, three of which became &quot;New York Times&quot; best-sellers in the 1990s. In 2002, she returned to writing with &quot;The Politics of Stupid&quot;, a stream-of-consciousness, self-published manifesto encouraging women to take control of their brains and bodies from food manufacturers, corrupt governments, and fitness/diet industries. She puts out &quot;The Monthly Flow&quot;, a subscription-based multi-media e-zine. Powter released her memoir, &quot;And Then Em Died... Stop the Insanity! A Memoir&quot;, in October 2024.

=== &quot;Waterworld&quot; ===
Powter said in 2025 that she had declined the offer of starring in Kevin Costner&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Waterworld&quot; after receiving a personal phone call from Costner. &quot;My manager was livid,&quot; Powter said. She reportedly told Coster she didn&#x27;t see herself in the character she was being asked to portray.

== Personal life ==
Powter has been married twice. She has two sons from her first marriage, Damien and Kiel. She adopted a third son Gabriel, after her second marriage.

In 1993, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Powter&#x27;s then curent living situation could be the basis of a sitcom. She rented a Dallas duplex where she lived with her second husband at the time, Lincoln Apeland, her two sons, and her first husband Nic Villarreal, who she divorced in 1988, all in the same house.
Powter later came out as a lesbian, and in a 2004 interview with &quot;Curve&quot; magazine, she described herself as a &quot;radical feminist housewife&quot;. She dated comedian Jessica Kirson in 2008.

In 1995, Powter filed for personal bankruptcy. In October 2024, Powter revealed that due to a series of lawsuits in the 1990s and poor financial planning she had been left virtually destitute, living in an RV, and delivering food for Grubhub and Ubereats. After a health scare, she enrolled in Medicaid. An upcoming documentary about her life, &quot;Stop the Insanity: Finding Susan Powter&quot;, co-produced by actress Jamie Lee Curtis, has been filmed.

<doc id="522372" wikidata="Q8074040" url="?curid=522372" title="Zoo Diaries">
<text>Zoo Diaries is a Canadian documentary television series airing on Life Network. The series documents the live of animals and people at a zoo with a record of breeding endangered species. 74 episodes have been produced since 2000 by DocuTainment Productions. The final episode aired in 2007.

Each episode opens with a brief description of the show&#x27;s contents. Events in the life of three or four animals are shown, cutting between stories every couple of minutes. Each story focuses on an animal in an interesting situation, and the zoo person responsible for handling the situation. Some situations are resolved over a number of episodes, for example, developing and performing an animal show designed to startle the audience. Topics vary from birth to death.

The series is candid about the zoo employees&#x27; behavior and opinions.

It is filmed at the Toronto Zoo in Toronto, Ontario and narrated by Vince Corazza.

Episodes 1-37 are available on DVD. In Canada, the show currently airs on National Geographic, Nat Geo Wild and Nickelodeon Canada.

<doc id="522375" wikidata="Q3155375" url="?curid=522375" title="Islamic Human Rights Commission">
<text>The Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) is a non-profit organisation based in London. Its stated mission is to &quot;champion the rights &amp; duties revealed for human beings&quot; and to &quot;promote a new social [and] international order, based on truth, justice, righteousness [and] generosity, rather than selfish interest.&quot; The group was established in 1997. The organisation, since 2007, has held consultative status with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

The organisation has been accused of ties with the government of Iran and spreading Islamic extremism in the United Kingdom. In the British government’s independent 2023 review of its Prevent counter-extremism programme, directed by William Shawcross, the final report described the organisation as &quot;an Islamist group ideologically aligned with the Iranian regime, that has a history of ‘extremist links and terrorist sympathies’ &quot;. Amnesty International UK’s Racial Justice Director Ilyas Nagdee described Shawcross’ review as “riddled with biased thinking, errors and plain anti-Muslim prejudice” and “has no legitimacy.” He accused the Prevent counter-extremism programme of unfairly targeting British Muslims, a claim which has been contested by policy experts.

The IHRC organises yearly Quds Day rallies to support Palestinians and oppose Israel and Zionism. Prior to 2019, the marches commonly included the display of Hezbollah flags, a group proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom in 2019.

==Philosophy==
The IHRC states its philosophy derives from:
Qur&#x27;anic injunctions that command believers to rise up in defence of the oppressed. &quot;And what reason have you that you should not fight in the way of Allah and of the weak among the men and the women and the children, (of) those who say: Our Lord! cause us to go forth from this town, whose people are oppressors, and give us from Thee a guardian and give us from Thee a helper.&quot; Qur&#x27;an 4:75

Jytte Klausen of Brandeis University writes that the IHRC forms part of the organized Muslim community in Europe.

Public intellectual and journalist Stuart Weir wrote that the IHRC is one of the representative voices of Muslims in the UK stating:

...the staff and voluntary workers of the Islamic Human Rights Commission – ... put the lie to the common idea that Islam and human rights are irreconcilable.

==Activities==
The organisation states it is a campaign, research and advocacy organisation. It also engages in ad hoc and one-off projects.

===Campaigns===

The campaigns section features heavily on the organisation&#x27;s website.

Its current campaigns focus on repealing anti-terrorism legislation and counter-radicalisation legislation in the UK. Other main campaigns include one for political prisoners in Saudi Arabia. During the 2014 Gaza War, the IHRC held a high-profile campaign to get people to show solidarity with Palestinians by flying a Palestinian flag.

Other campaigns include the ‘Prisoners of Faith’ project, which has included campaigns to release various religious figures from imprisonment for their religious beliefs. Among these are Mu&#x27;allim Ibrahim Zakzaky released 1998, Gul Aslan released 1999, Nureddin Sirin, released 2004. The organisation also states the following have been released as a result of their campaigning: Mallam Turi, Zeenah Ibrahim from Nigeria; Sheikh Al-Jamri, Bahrain; Huda Kaya, Bekir Yildiz, Recep Tayyep Erdogan, Nurilhak Saatcioglu, Nurcihan Saatioglu, Turkey; Sheikh Ahmed Yassine, Abdul Aziz Rantissi, Rabbi Biton, Sheikh Abdulkareem Obeid, Mustafa Dirani from Israeli detention; Mohammed Mahdi Akef, Egypt; Dr. Muhammad Osman Elamin, Sudan; Cehl Meeah, Mauritius; Abbasi Madani and Ali Behadj, Algeria.

Previous campaigns for &#x27;Prisoners of Faith&#x27; focused on US detainees, and include Omar Abdul Rahman (the perpetrator of the 1993 World Trade Centre bombing), his attorney Lynne Stewart (convicted on charges of conspiracy and providing material support to terrorists in 2005), Ghassen Elashi (convicted of terrorist financing for funnelling $12 million to the Palestinian terrorist organisation Hamas), former Black Panther Imam Jamil Al-Amin (serving a life sentence for murder), as well as Egyptian detainees including Khairet El-Shater, Deputy Supreme Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, released in 2010 and reincarcerated in 2013 after the coup.

Other campaign work includes thematic and country based campaigns e.g. for release of detainees in Bahrain, against brutalisation of immigrant women in France, and against niqāb bans in France, Bosnia, Belgium and Spain.

In 2000 the IHRC &quot;protested against a government-backed European directive, which, according to them, would force Muslim charities and schools to employ non-believers and homosexuals&quot;.

IHRC has promoted various boycott, divestment and sanctions actions, including a boycott of Israeli dates in the UK. In May 2010, the IHRC organised and led a delegation of European Muslim organisations to Turkey to lobby the Turkish government to veto Israel&#x27;s accession to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The bid was unsuccessful as all 31 members of the OECD voted unanimously for Israel’s accession.

Other notable campaigns saw the campaign to have Mat Sah Satray and other ISA detainees in Malaysia released in 2009.

In 2006, IHRC began an emergency campaign against the imminent execution of British and Pakistani dual national Mirza Tahir Hussain. Other organisations, including Fair Trials Abroad and Amnesty International, joined the campaign.

After a BBC documentary broadcast on 15 July 2004 exposed very strong anti-Islamic opinions within the far-right British National Party, the IHRC has campaigned for the prohibition of that party.

===Advocacy===

The bulk of IHRC&#x27;s advocacy work, it claims, is undertaken away from the public glare and involves helping individuals with discrimination cases involving Islamophobia and anti-Muslim racism. Some public testimonies and case reports exist highlighting this section of IHRCs work. In 2004 PhD student Yasir Abdelmouttalib was viciously assaulted in a race hate attack and left severely disabled. His mother states:
&#x27;Fortunately... I got support from... Islamic Human Rights
Commission (IHRC), the only community group in London with case workers to help Muslim victims of hate crimes like Yasir, and that helped us to pull through&#x27;.
On 3 August 2006, the IHRC asked for judicial review of its allegations that the British government assisted with military shipments to Israel, which was eventually denied.

In 2010, IHRC publicly advocated against the introduction of full body scanners at UK ports.

In 2013 it claimed victory in the case, after the British government made a U-turn on the introduction of the full naked body scanners, before the matter came to court. The case, which IHRC supported objected to the scanners on the grounds of:

the dissolution of civil liberties, health issues, the explicit nature of the body scanners and storage of images, as well as the fact that the scanners could not detect plastics and liquids which was given as a reason for their introduction.

In 2014, IHRC Legal, a new section of IHRC was launched, quickly claiming a victory in a discrimination case featuring university lecturer who claimed indirect racial discrimination against his employers. His case was settled out of court.

The advocacy section is also involved in trial monitoring, with observer trips to Turkey, Mauritius and Bahrain featuring in this field.

====Campaign for release of Abu Hamza al-Masri====
IHRC&#x27;s chairman, Massoud Shadjareh criticised the prosecution of Abu Hamza al-Masri in 2006, his extradition in 2012 to the US, and his conviction in 2014 in the US.

IHRC has been deeply critical of the treatment of Abu Hamza al-Masri on various counts. It has highlighted what it calls &quot;double standards&quot; in his treatment by the press, politicians and the legal system, arguing that the case of al-Masri highlighted societal and judicial double standards, averring to the failure to convict British National Party leader Nick Griffin and his colleague in the same week as convicting al-Masri of similar crimes. IHRC&#x27;s chair, Massoud Shadjareh stated:

Notwithstanding Abu Hamza&#x27;s controversial character and views, it seems astounding that this week Nick Griffin and his co-defendant from the BNP walked free from court and Abu Hamza has been convicted. 

At a time when we are witnessing free speech mania directed at Muslims who have been told to put up with any insult, offence and abuse in the name of free speech, this verdict sends yet another signal that Muslims are not equal in the eyes of the law of this country.

In 2006, a British court found Abu Hamza al-Masri guilty of inciting violence, and sentenced him to seven years&#x27; imprisonment. On 5 October 2012, after an eight-year legal battle, he was extradited from the UK to the United States to face terrorism charges and on 14 April 2014 his trial began in New York.

On 19 May 2014, Hamza was found guilty of eleven terrorism charges by a jury in Manhattan.

On 9 January 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

====Campaign for release of Omar Abdel-Rahman====

The group had campaigned for the release of Omar Abdel-Rahman, the &quot;Blind Sheikh&quot; who was convicted for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and was the leader of Al-Jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya, an armed terrorist group in Egypt which is proscribed by the British Government. The IHRC criticised the court&#x27;s judgment including the use of laws &quot;not used since the American Civil War&quot; to convict Abdel-Rahman.

The organisation also campaigned for the release of Abdel-Rahman&#x27;s lawyer Lynne Stewart, who was convicted on charges of conspiracy and providing material support to terrorists in 2005, and sentenced to 28 months in prison. Her felony conviction led to her being automatically disbarred. She was convicted of helping pass messages from her client Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, an Egyptian cleric convicted of planning terror attacks, to his followers in al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya, an organization designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States Secretary of State.

The Islamic Human Rights Commission presented Stewart with an award for her &quot;fight against Islamophobia&quot; in February 2014.

On Abdel-Rahman&#x27;s death in 2017, the IHRC described him as &quot;a rare man of principle…[whose] death will only make him a martyr and more of an inspiration.&quot;

===Research===

====Hate crimes and discrimination====
The organisation published several reports which were based on third party reporting of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the UK, including statistics which were published one month after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and statistics which were published one year after the attacks.

Previously, it had employed basic survey methods to generate statistics for 1999 and 2000.

In 2009–10, it launched a pilot project in the UK and France by using a survey method, resulting in the publication of its findings in &quot;Getting the Message: The Recurrence of Hate Crimes in the UK&quot; (2011) and &quot;France and the Hated Society: Muslims Experiences&quot; (2012).

The project was refined and rerun in California, the rest of the US and Canada, resulting in the publication of &quot;Once Upon a Hatred: Anti-Muslim experiences in the USA&quot; (2013) and &quot;Only Canadian: The Experience of Hate Moderated Differential Citizenship for Muslims&quot; (2014).

In 2014, the organisation undertook data collection in the UK once more.

Its methodology involves surveying a sample of the Muslim population in each country and assessing the levels of negative experience encountered. It assesses levels of physical attack (hate crimes), verbal abuse, seeing negative depiction of Islam and Muslims in the media.

The statistics for physical assault in the various surveys showed that in the UK, nearly 14% had experienced a violent physical assault. In France, 11%, in the US (California) nearly 30% and in Canada, 11%. If the UK figures are extrapolated to the entire UK population of Muslims (nearly 3 million), it suggest that some 420,000 Muslims have experienced a physical hate attack.

====Country reports====
IHRC produces country reports on human rights abuses e.g. Nigeria. It also submits reports to the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism at the United Nations. The list of countries it has submitted reports on in the period 2007–2010 are: Iraq, China, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, France, Sri Lanka, The Philippines, Tunisia, Morocco, India, Bahrain, United Kingdom.

====Thematic reports====
It also produces thematic reports e.g. on hijab and freedom of religious expression, even submitting some of these to UN committees such as the Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).

====Anti-terrorism laws====
It has also produced several critical works opposing anti-terrorism legislation, particularly in the UK. Its 2006 report &#x27;Anti-terrorism: A Modern day Witch-hunt&#x27; by Fahad Ansari was praised by Tony Benn and Bruce Kent. According to Benn:

Scholarly work of this kind helps us by emphasising the importance of Civil Liberties to all communities.

Kent stated it was a:
... most interesting – and shocking – terrorism report... it will do much good.

Further reports, briefings and submissions to the government&#x27;s consultations tackled various anti-terrorism laws and policies including the CONTEST and PREVENT strategies, moves to remove citizenship from terror suspects, stops and searches, and stops at ports and airports. They have also expressed the importance for &#x27;reform&#x27; of Schedule 7 on the basis that it was &#x27;discriminatory&#x27; towards Muslims.

In 2014 it produced a response to the UK government&#x27;s Tackling Extremism in the UK report.

The organisation started 2015 by stating that it was pulling out of the consultative process on the anti-terror laws with the government, claiming that participation only legitimated the raft of unjust laws. It announced this move in conjunction with the launch of its briefing &quot;Proposed Counter Terrorism and Security Bill: an Orwellian Possibility.&quot;

====Citizenship====
In 2004, IHRC launched the British Muslims&#x27; Expectations of the Government (BMEG) research project. It culminated in six reports on citizenship, discrimination, education, hijab, law and media and representation. The focus on theoretical aspects of citizenship in this project has become a key theme in IHRC research work. According to Professor D. Ray Heisey, the project:

... examined 1125 responses to a questionnaire and the responses from 52 personal interviews of Muslims living in various cities within the UK. They included a range of respondents in age, education, gender, and economic class...

The strength of these studies is in the intercultural approach taken and the comprehensive nature of the investigation in looking at the topics as seen in the literature as well as the results of their extensive array of questions on numerous topics related to their perceptions of the consequences of living in a majority culture. Each volume ends with the views of leading citizens on the given topic and a list of recommendations for the British government to consider at the policy level as a result of the findings.

In addition to the BMEG project, IHRC&#x27;s research section has used the idea of citizenship as a critical lens through which to discuss social issue. It looks both at the technical specificity of citizenship and its denial (in a crossover of concern with the advocacy and campaigns departments) e.g. on issues of citizenship stripping in countries as diverse as the UK, Bahrain, UAE and Kuwait. It also looks at the sociological implications and discriminatory aspects of citizenship tests as they have developed e.g. in the UK and Germany.

====Human rights theory====
Other theoretical work includes papers on human rights discourse, as well as Islam and human rights represented in reports, papers presented at seminars, participation in wider research projects e.g. Trust Building in Conflict Transformation with the Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Contemporary Political Violence.

===Collaborative work===

In 2006, IHRC issued a joint statement signed by various public figures calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Lebanon war, and calling on the British government to be evenhanded. Signatories included Vanessa Redgrave, various other MPs including David Gottlieb, Ann Cryer, Clare Short, Frank Dobson, Ian Gibson, John Austin and Jeremy Corbyn, as well as various Islamic, Christian and Jewish groups and individuals including Muslim Council of Britain, Jews Against Zionism, Rev Fr. Frank Gelli, Rev Steven Sizer, Roland Rance, and Lord Nazir Ahmed. This statement and IHRC&#x27;s research work and participation in protest events during the war attracted controversy in the right-wing press (see Controversy and Criticism below).

The IHRC has on a number of occasions organised joint statements with various Islamic groups about British terror legislation, and has collaborated with prominent civil liberties lawyers Gareth Peirce and Louise Christian.

===Other projects===

====Institutional Islamophobia Conference====

In December 2014, the organisation is organised the conference Institutional Islamophobia, subtitling it &#x27;A conference to examine state racism and social engineering of the Muslim community&#x27;. Speakers slated to talk on the day were Hatem Bazian (co-founder of Zaytuna College, and Professor at UC Berkeley), Malia Bouattia – Black Students&#x27; Officer at the National Union of Students, author and academic Marie Breen Smyth from the University of Surrey, Ramon Grosfoguel a professor from UC Berkeley, Les Levidow from the Campaign Against Criminalising Communities and Jews for Boycotting Israeli Goods, Richard Haley, the Chair of Scotland Against Criminalising Communities, Peter Oborne, the Chief political commentator of the Daily Telegraph and associate editor of The Spectator, Salman Sayyid the author and academic based at the University of Leeds, AbdoolKarim Vakil who is Chair of the Research and Documentation Committee of the Muslim Council of Britain, and an academic at King&#x27;s College London, Lee Jasper, former adviser to the London Mayor, and co-chair of Black Activists Rising Against Cuts &amp; National Black Members Officer for the Respect Party, and the organisation&#x27;s Head of Research, Arzu Merali.

The conference was part of an initiative by Decoloniality Europe where several organised across Europe as part of the International Day Against Islamophobia Initiative, launched on 9 December in Brussels, Belgium.

Other conferences took place in Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels.

Two days before the conference was scheduled to take place, Birkbeck, University of London cancelled the organisation&#x27;s booking for the conference (see Controversies below), forcing the event to be relocated to the P21 Gallery. Birkbeck were roundly criticised for the cancellation with academics and teaching unions protesting the move, claiming that the cancellation was itself evidence of Islamophobia and racism.

====The New Colonialism: The American Model of Human Rights====

The New Colonialism: The American Model of Human Rights was a 2018 conference by IHRC, the papers presented at which were published in 2019 in a book of the same name. Speakers at the conference were: Saied Reza Ameli, Laurens de Rooij, Saeed A. Khan, Ramon Grosfoguel, Sandew Hira, Mary K. Ryan, Sohail Daulatzai, Tasneem Chopra and Rajeesh Kumar. The stated aim of the conference and book was to look at how human rights discourse has been co-opted and adulterated by the US in both its domestic and foreign policy.

====Annual Islamophobia Awards====

The Annual Islamophobia Awards is the name of a spoof awards ceremony held by the organisation in 2003–2006 and again from 2014 onwards. The organisation seek nominations from the public and open a public voting system to find the &#x27;Islamophobes&#x27; of the year from any sector of public life.

In the Islamophobia Awards there are two divisions of awards given, one division is the spoof division given to the public vote for Islamophobes for being &#x27;Islamophobic&#x27;, the other is given to people who have dedicated their work to tackling Islamophobia and to recognize them.

During the 2003 Annual Islamophobia Awards, Ariel Sharon was announced as the winner of the &quot;Most Islamophobic International Politician of the Year&#x27;&quot;, for an interview allegedly given in 1956.

The Islamophobia Awards were revived in the 2010s by the organisation and ran from 2013 to 2018.

In 2015, author and commentator Douglas Murray criticised the IHRC for giving French satirical magazine &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; an ‘award’ for Islamophobia, two months after 12 of Charlie Hebdo’s staff were shot dead in an Islamic terrorist attack.

====Al-Quds Day, UK====

The commission is one of the organisers of the annual Al-Quds Day event in London.

====Against Zionism: Jewish Perspectives====

In 2006, the organisation brought together leading Jewish activists in London, for an international conference, held at SOAS University of London. The papers from the conference were published in English and Turkish. Speakers at the conference included Michel Warschawski, Uri Davis, Rabbi Yisroel Weiss, Rabbi Ahron Cohen, Roland Rance, Les Levidow, Jeffrey Blankfort, Professor Yakov Rabkin, and John Rose.

====Human Rights and Israel at 60====
In 2008, IHRC organised the international conference &#x27;Human Rights and Israel at 60&#x27;. Speakers included: Michael Warschawski (Alternative Information Center); Yehudit Keshet (Checkpoint Watch); Daud Abdullah (Palestinian Return Centre); Jennifer Loewenstein (University of Wisconsin); Michael Bailey (Oxfam); Meir Margalit (Israeli Committee against House Demolitions).

====Convivencia Alliance====

In 2022, IHRC, alongside the Jewish Network for Palestine and the Peacemakers Trust set up the Convivencia Alliance, an interfaith group setup to help bring about a &quot;just peace in Palestine&quot;. The alliance is supported by organisations including Ahlulbayt Islamic Mission, Decolonial International Network, Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions, One Democratic State, The Palestinian Forum in Britain, Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, and Simon Bolivar Institute.

==Controversies==

===2006 Lebanon War===

During the 2006 Lebanon War, IHRC undertook various actions in opposition to the war and called on the British government to be evenhanded in its treatment of the parties. It issued a briefing entitled &#x27;The Blame Game: International Law and the Current Crisis in the Middle East&#x27;. The IHRC also brought a court challenge against the British government over its decision to allow military supply flights from the USA to Israel to land and refuel in the UK. The challenge was unsuccessful.

Melanie Phillips in &quot;The Spectator&quot; claimed that in the briefing &#x27;The Blame Game: International Law and the Current Crisis in the Middle East&#x27;, IHRC Chair Massoud Shadjareh asked &quot;his followers&quot; and &quot;British Muslims&quot; to provide financial assistance to Hezbollah, and called for the occupation of Israel and &quot;regime change&quot; by Hezbollah on self-defence grounds. She also highlighted that banners were seen at IHRC demonstrations saying &quot;We are all Hezbollah now&quot;.

Israeli professor and historian Ilan Pappe supported the IHRC and its briefing in a letter to the editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, asserting that it was accurate and similar to those &quot;one can find in the annual reports of Amnesty international and the Israeli human rights societies reports&quot;, describing Philips&#x27; accusations as &quot;vicious and unfounded&quot;.

In a 2008 essay, &quot;Brixton, Berkley and Other Roads to Radicalisation&quot;, Shadjareh states:
The primary slaughter was of a people of another nation, and for that reason, back in &#x27;68, &quot;We were all Ho Chi Minh&quot;, and for the same reason in 2006, aside from any other affiliations the authors may have, we authorised IHRC to add its name to the posters of dead and injured Lebanese children during the 33-day war, because then and now, &quot;We are All Hizbullah.&quot; The Spectator and various parts of the right wing press declared that this was a sign that an Iranian backed spate of terror attacks on the UK were imminent, citing in particular the posters and IHRC. They failed to note that Hizbullah flags at said demonstrations were sported by many including orthodox Rabbis, and the now infamous banners held by amongst others middle class English women appalled at the slaughter.

===2007 Apology from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;===

On 2 December 2007, in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Shiraz Maher wrote an article entitled &quot;A failure to confront radical Islam&quot;. The article claimed that IHRC Chair Massoud Shadjareh, whilst appearing on the Today programme, made moral equivalents between Muslims in Guantanamo Bay and the fate of Gillian Gibbons in Sudan. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; subsequently issued a correction, which held that this and other suggestions that Shadjareh had condoned the Sudanese government&#x27;s actions were &quot;totally untrue&quot;, and that he had in fact &quot;condemned outright&quot; Gibbons&#x27; treatment by the Sudanese government. Shadjareh brought a libel complaint against the newspaper which he won. The newspaper published an apology and agreed to pay Shadjareh &quot;substantial damages&quot;.

===2015 Charlie Hebdo award===
In March 2015, IHRC gave the French satirical magazine &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; their &quot;International Islamophobe of the Year&quot; award, less than two months after 12 members of staff at the magazine had been killed by Islamist extremists. According to &quot;The Independent,&quot; &quot;The controversial commendation has been branded &#x27;insensitive&#x27;, as it comes in the wake of the massacre on January 7 this year, in which brothers Saïd and Chérif Kouachi forced their way into the Paris offices and killed a dozen journalists and cartoonists.&quot;

The group was also criticised for giving counter extremism campaigner and Muslim Maajid Nawaz its &quot;UK Islamophobe of the Year&quot; award.

===2017 Nazim Ali&#x27;s Grenfell Tower comments===

In June 2017 after the Grenfell Tower fire, Nazim Ali, a director of the IHRC, was videotaped telling a group of protestors that &quot;It is the Zionists who give money to the Tory party, to kill people in high rise blocks&quot; and &quot;Careful, careful, careful of those rabbis who belong to the Board of Deputies, who have got blood on their hands.&quot; Ali later said that &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; had &quot;not presented what I said accurately in the wider context of what was said in the prelude to the minute&#x27;s silence for Grenfell. As presented it sounds somewhat inelegant... To say that some of Theresa May or the Tory party&#x27;s supporters are Zionists is hardly controversial.&quot; An attempt by the Campaign Against Antisemitism to bring a private prosecution for inciting racial or religious hatred, was blocked by the Crown Prosecution Service as they determined there was no &quot;realistic prospect of conviction&quot;.

==Criticisms==
===Alleged connections with Iranian government and support for Hezbollah===
According to &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, British government officials believe the organisation has direct ties to the Iranian government in Tehran.

In May 2019, a Henry Jackson Society report stated that co-founder and board member of the IHRC Saied Reza Ameli had been promoted to Secretary of the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution in Iran. 

In 2022 the times reported that as secretary of the Council, Saied Reza Ameli had played a key role in drawing up the government’s tougher rules on the mandatory wearing of the hijab in Iran while serving as Director of the IHRC in Britain. He said the laws on “chastity and hijab” in 2019, were needed for &quot;social health, protection of the family&quot; and that foreign television shows were designed to “weaken chastity and hijab”.

The investigation also claimed that co-director of the IHRC Azru Merali said in a speech at a 2014 conference that “We know who the enemy is. It’s the West, Nato countries [and] . . . the white supremacist or liberal structure we’re all suffering at the hands of.” The third director of the IHRC, Nazim Ali, speaking at a rally after the Grenfell Tower fire, condemned “Zionists who give money to the Tory party to kill people in high-rise blocks”.

The Iranian-American women’s rights activist Masih Alinejad has described the organisation as a “propaganda tool” of the Iranian government.

According to a 2021 report in &quot;The Times&quot;, in 2008 the chair of the IHRC, Massoud Shadjareh, who was born in Iran, co-authored a paper in which he wrote: “We are all Hezbollah”, had described the Ayatollah Khomenei as “a torch of light for the whole of mankind”, and said that he “aspired to become like” Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force who was assassinated in a US drone strike in 2020. The IHRC is one of the chief organisers of the yearly pro-Palestine and anti-Israel Quds Day marches.

In February 2024, the IHRC was accused of intimidation after it criticised the opening of a Charity Commission investigation into the Islamic Centre of England, whose Imam, Seyed Hashem Moosavi, is a direct representative of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei.

According to the now defunct Awaaz, the IHRC is &quot;a radical Islamist organisation that uses the language of human rights to promote an extremist agenda including the adoption of shariah law&quot;. In a 2006 report entitled &quot;The Islamist Right – key tendencies&quot;, Awaaz stated the IHRC is part of a corpus of right-wing Islamist and neo-Khomeiniist organisations, a claim which the IHRC rejected. Awaaz&#x27;s claims were echoed by journalist Melanie Phillips, who stated in &quot;The Spectator&quot; that the IHRC was, &quot;the most conspicuous promoter of Khomeini jihadism in the UK, ... [and] is said to be close to Iran.&quot;

=== Selectivity ===
There is disagreement over the organisation&#x27;s stance on Muslim countries. Its supporters, including British MPs, US academics and others state that it is a source of good and reliable information for abuses in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Malaysia. Anthony McRoy, in his 2006 book &quot;From Rushdie to 7/7: The Radicalisation of Islam in Britain&quot; writes that 
... an interesting aspect of IHRC radicalism is that the group does not restrict criticism of human rights abuses to Western governments... it also condemns &#x27;militant&#x27; Islamic regimes, such as Sudan for human rights abuses in Darfur...

In a 2008 article published in the &quot;Harvard Human Rights Journal&quot;, Eric Heinze writes that:
On the whole, the more oppressive an Islamic state is, and the more it officially propagates pro-Islamic doctrines or institutions, the less likely the Islamic Human Rights Commission has been to criticize it. That approach offends any concept of fairness in the application of human rights.

The pro-Israel group Stephen Roth Institute critiqued IHRC&#x27;s opposition to the Saudi Arabian government, including links it claims the organisation has with UK based Saudi dissident Muhammad al-Mas&#x27;ari. The institute also criticised IHRC for working with Imam Muhammad al-&#x27;Asi (whom they incorrectly refer to as an American convert), who was the elected Imam of the Washington D.C. Mosque but who was locked out of the premises and banned by the Saudi Embassy.

===Alcohol investment===
On 23 August 2013, an article in &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that the IHRC held shares in the Baa Bar Group, a Liverpool-based bar chain that sells alcoholic beverages. The article contrasted this with the IHRC&#x27;s own publication that warned people against the use of alcohol, stating that &quot;the greatest underminer and saboteur of discipline and confidence is alcohol and so-called social drinking&quot;, and stating that &quot;alcohol is the curse of the oppressed people and a boon for the oppressors. Not only is the oppressor making enormous profits from liquor but it also totally immobilizes and paralyses the critical faculties of the oppressed&quot;. The IHRC responded to the article four days later, explaining that the shares were a gift from a supporter, who told the Commission that they were shares in property. It pointed out that &quot;some considerable time later, we came to know that the company was related to a company that dealt in alcohol, by which time the company had been delisted from the stock exchange, and the shares were deemed almost worthless&quot;. It stated that the commission has &quot;sought advice as to how best to dispose of these shares without financially benefiting from this trade&quot;.

=== 2024 Claim of Zionist financiers ===
On 6 August 2024, Chair of the IHRC, Massoud Shadjareh, published an open letter to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper in which the organisation blamed “Zionist financiers abroad” for “enabling” the British Far-Right.

The IHRC&#x27;s letter was condemned by the by 50 peers in the House of Lords as &quot;primitive, dangerous and disgraceful antisemitism&quot; The organisation denied the accusation, stating that those peers who had signed the letter had conflated Zionism and Judaism and were being disingenuous, anti-semitic and Islamophobic.

<doc id="522378" wikidata="Q830859" url="?curid=522378" title="Fischer projection">
<text>In chemistry, the Fischer projection, devised by Emil Fischer in 1891, is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional organic molecule by projection. Fischer projections were originally proposed for the depiction of carbohydrates and used by chemists, particularly in organic chemistry and biochemistry. The use of Fischer projections in non-carbohydrates is discouraged, as such drawings are ambiguous and easily confused with other types of drawing. The main purpose of Fischer projections is to show the chirality of a molecule and to distinguish between a pair of enantiomers. Some notable uses include drawing sugars and depicting isomers.

== Conventions ==
All bonds are depicted as horizontal or vertical lines. The carbon chain is depicted vertically, with carbon atoms sometimes not shown and represented by the center of crossing lines (see figure below). The orientation of the carbon chain is so that the first carbon (C1) is at the top. In an aldose, C1 is the carbon of the aldehyde group; in a ketose, C1 is the carbon closest to the ketone group, which is typically found at C2.

The proper way to view a Fischer projection is to vertically orient the molecule in relation to the carbon chain, have all horizontal bonds point toward the viewer, and orient all vertical bonds to point away from the viewer. Molecules with a simple tetrahedral geometry can be easily rotated in space so that this condition is met (see figures). Fischer projections are commonly constructed beginning with a sawhorse representation. To do so, all attachments to main chain carbons must be rotated such that resulting Newman projections show an eclipsed configuration. The carbon chain is then positioned vertically upward with all horizontal attachments pointing toward the viewer. Finally, attachments to main chain carbons that face away from the viewer are placed in the vertical position of the Fischer projection, and those that face toward the viewer are placed in the horizontal position of the Fischer projection. Each intersection between a horizontal and vertical line on the Fischer projection represents a carbon in the main carbon chain.

Fischer projections are effective representations of 3D molecular configuration in certain cases. For example, a monosaccharide with three carbon atoms (triose), such as the D-Glyceraldehyde depicted above, has a tetrahedral geometry, with C2 at its center, and can be rotated in space so that the carbon chain is vertical with C1 at the top, and the horizontal bonds connecting C2 with the Hydrogen and the Hydroxide are both slanted toward the viewer.

However, when creating a Fischer projection for a monosaccharide with more than three carbons, there is no way to orient the molecule in space so that all horizontal bonds will be slanted toward the viewer. After rotating the molecule so that both the horizontal bonds with C2 are slanted toward the viewer, the horizontal bonds with C3 will be typically slanted away. So, after drawing the bonds with C2, before drawing the bonds with C3 the molecule must be rotated in space by 180° about its vertical axis. Further similar rotations may be needed to complete the drawing.

This implies that in most cases a Fischer projection is not an accurate representation of the actual 3D configuration of a molecule. It can be regarded as a projection of a modified version of the molecule, ideally twisted at multiple levels along its backbone. For instance, an open-chain molecule of D-glucose rotated so that the horizontal bonds with C2 are slanted toward the viewer, would have the bonds with C3 and C5 slanted away from the viewer, and hence its accurate projection would not coincide with a Fischer projection. For a more accurate representation of an open-chain molecule, a Natta projection may be used.

According to IUPAC rules, all hydrogen atoms should preferably be drawn explicitly; in particular, the hydrogen atoms of the end group of carbohydrates should be present.
 In this regard Fischer projection is different from skeletal formulae.

== Chirality ==

Chiral molecules can be described as ones with a set of stereoisomers or left and right-handed enantiomers. As defined by Lord Kelvin, a molecule has chirality “if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot be brought to coincide with itself.” In other words, a chiral molecule is asymmetrical in the sense that its mirror image will not be an exact copy of itself. Chirality is key to understand in many fields such as drug development as one enantiomer of a drug may cause severe adverse effects while the other provides relief from an ailment. This is significant in terms of Fischer Projections as chirality is an important factor to consider when both drawing and reading them. A great benefit of the model is the ability to interpret chirality with ease based on the orientation of the substituents. Slight changes in the formatting of these models can cause the stereochemistry to be interpreted differently thereby meaning that the molecule has been depicted incorrectly. Fischer Projections provide aid in visualizing chirality as well as where substituents are oriented within space which is why their application can be useful to many.

=== Chirality from projection ===
Determining chirality based on Fischer Projections is effectively the same as the standard method. The primary difference is the benefit that Fischer Projections provide in depicting the orientation of substituents with the vertical and horizontal lines. Considering that orientation of these molecules is already known, it may be properly depicted with wedges and dashes if needed. After this, the priority of each of the groups bonded to the carbon are ranked and the chirality is determined in the standard fashion. While there is no significant difference in the actual process of determining chirality, Fischer Projections allow one to better visualize where substituents are in space making it convenient to assign S or R chirality based on this model. In certain cases, it can be helpful to draw a Fischer Projection from a larger molecule to visualize and determine the chirality of a specific carbon.

== Other Models ==

Haworth projections are a related chemical notation used to represent sugars in ring form. The groups on the right hand side of a Fischer projection are equivalent to those below the plane of the ring in Haworth projections. Fischer projections should not be confused with Lewis structures, which do not contain any information about three dimensional geometry. Newman projections are another system that can be used as they showcase the structure of a molecule in the staggered or eclipsed conformation states. The wedge and dash notation will help to showcase the stereochemistry within a specific molecule.

<doc id="522384" wikidata="Q828458" url="?curid=522384" title="MS Estonia">
<text>MS &quot;Estonia&quot; was a cruiseferry built in 1980 for the Finnish shipping company Rederi Ab Sally by Meyer Werft, in Papenburg, West Germany. It was employed on ferry routes between Finland and Sweden by various companies (first Viking Line, then EffJohn) until the end of January 1993, when it was sold to Nordström &amp; Thulin for use on Estline&#x27;s Tallinn–Stockholm route. The ship&#x27;s sinking on 28 September 1994, in the Baltic Sea between Sweden, Finland and Estonia, was one of the worst peacetime maritime disasters of the 20th century, claiming 852 lives. An official inquiry found that failure of the locks on the bow visor caused water to flood the car deck and quickly capsize the ship. The report also noted a lack of crew action. A 2023 investigation noted additional construction flaws in the bow visor.

==Construction==
The ship was originally ordered from the Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg, Germany by a Norwegian shipping company led by Parley Augustsen with intended traffic between Norway and Germany. At the last moment, the company withdrew their order and the contract went to Rederi Ab Sally, one of the partners in the Viking Line consortium (SF Line, another partner in Viking Line, had also been interested in the ship).

Originally the ship was conceived as a sister ship to &quot;Diana II&quot;, built in 1979 by the same shipyard for Rederi AB Slite, the third partner in Viking Line. When Sally took over the construction contract, the ship was lengthened from the original length of approximately to approximately and the superstructure of the ship was largely redesigned.

Viking Line received a total of four new ships in 1980 alone, three of which were built for Rederi AB Sally. In addition to the &quot;Viking Sally&quot;, the &quot;Viking Saga&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Viking Song&quot; also entered service in 1980, having been built by Wärtsilä (now Aker Finnyards) in Turku, Finland.

Meyer Werft had constructed a large number of ships for various Viking Line partner companies during the 1970s. The construction of the ship&#x27;s bow consisted of an upwards-opening visor and a car ramp that was placed inside the visor when it was closed. An identical bow construction had also been used in &quot;Diana II&quot;.

==Service history==
&quot;Estonia&quot; previously sailed as Viking Sally (1980–1990), Silja Star (1990–1991), and Wasa King (1991–1993).

===Viking Line===

On 29 June 1980, &quot;Viking Sally&quot; was delivered to Rederi Ab Sally, Finland and was put into service on the route between Turku, Mariehamn and Stockholm (during summer 1982 on the Naantali–Mariehamn–Kapellskär route). She was the largest ship to serve on that route at the time. As with many ships, &quot;Viking Sally&quot; suffered some mishaps during her Viking Line service, being grounded in the Åland Archipelago in May 1984 and suffering some propeller problems in April of the following year. In 1985 she was also rebuilt with a &quot;duck tail&quot;. In 1986, a passenger was murdered on board. In 1987, another murder and attempted murder took place. The latter remains unsolved.
Rederi Ab Sally had been experiencing financial difficulties for most of the 1980s. In late 1987, Effoa and Johnson Line, the owners of Viking Line&#x27;s main rivals Silja Line, bought Sally. As a result of this, SF Line and Rederi AB Slite forced Sally to withdraw from Viking Line. &quot;Viking Sally&quot; was chartered to Rederi AB Slite to continue on her current traffic for the next three years.

===Silja Line===

When her charter ended in April 1990, &quot;Viking Sally&quot; had an unusual change of service. She was painted in Silja Line&#x27;s colours, renamed &quot;Silja Star&quot; and placed on the same route that she had plied for Viking Line: Turku–Mariehamn–Stockholm. The reason for this was that Silja&#x27;s new ship for Helsinki–Stockholm service was built behind schedule and one of the Turku–Stockholm ships, &quot;Wellamo&quot;, was transferred to that route until the new ship was complete in November 1990. Also in 1990 Effoa, Johnson Line and Rederi Ab Sally merged into EffJohn.

The following spring &quot;Silja Star&quot; began her service with Wasa Line, another company owned by EffJohn. Her name was changed to &quot;Wasa King&quot; and she served on routes connecting Vaasa, Finland to Umeå and Sundsvall in Sweden. It has been reported that the &quot;Wasa King&quot; was widely considered to be the best behaving ship in rough weather to have sailed from Vaasa.

===Estline===
In January 1993, at the same time when EffJohn decided to merge Wasa Line&#x27;s operations into Silja Line, &quot;Wasa King&quot; was sold to Nordström &amp; Thulin for use on Estline&#x27;s Tallinn–Stockholm traffic under the name &quot;Estonia&quot;. The actual ownership of the ship was rather complex, in order for Nordström &amp; Thulin to get a loan to buy the ship. Although Nordström &amp; Thulin was the company which bought the ship, her registered owner was Estline Marine Co Ltd, Nicosia, Cyprus, which chartered the ship to E.Liini A/S, Tallinn, Estonia (daughter company of Nordström &amp; Thulin and ESCO), which in turn chartered the ship to Estline AB. As a result, the ship was actually registered in both Cyprus and Estonia.

As the largest Estonian-owned ship of the time, the &quot;Estonia&quot; symbolized the independence that her namesake regained after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

==Decks and facilities==
MS &quot;Estonia&quot; consisted of 11 decks, counting from the lowest (0) to the highest (10). Passenger facilities were located on decks 6, 5, 4, and 1, while the crew members occupied decks 8 and 7. Decks 2 and 3 were dedicated to cargo.

===As &quot;Viking Sally&quot;===
==Sinking==

&quot;Estonia&quot; sank on Wednesday, 28 September 1994, between about 00:50 and 01:50 (UTC+2) as the ship was crossing the Baltic Sea, en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm, Sweden.

The official report concluded that the bow door had separated from the vessel, pulling the ramp ajar. The ship was already listing because of poor cargo distribution, and the list increased rapidly, flooding the decks and the cabins. Power soon failed altogether, inhibiting search and rescue, and a full-scale emergency was not declared for 90 minutes. Of the 989 on board, 137 were rescued. The report criticised primarily the ship&#x27;s construction, as well as the passive attitude of the crew, failing to notice that water was entering the vehicle deck, delaying the alarm, and providing minimal guidance from the bridge.

The HBO documentary raised other possibilities for the sinking including a hit or collision with an object of about 1000 tons. 

The sinking was one of the worst maritime disasters of the 20th-century. It is one of the deadliest peacetime sinkings of a European ship, after the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; (1912) and the RMS &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; (1914), and the deadliest peacetime shipwreck to have occurred in European waters, with 852 lives lost. There is a memorial for the event in Tallinn and Sweden.

<text>Dahir Riyale Kahin (, ; born 12 March 1952) is a Somaliland politician who was President of Somaliland from 2002 to 2010. He previously served as a senior officer in the National Security Service in Somalia, and he was Vice President of Somaliland from 1997 to 2002

==Personal life==
Kahin was born in the town of Quljeed, situated in the northwestern Awdal region of Somaliland. He hails from the Jibreel Younis sub-clan of the Gadabuursi clan. He was educated in Amoud, and was later trained in Mogadishu.

==Career==
===Early career===
Kahin&#x27;s previous posts included a diplomatic position at the Somali Embassy in Djibouti.

In the last years of the Siad Barre government, during the 1980s, Kahin was the highest-ranking National Security Service (NSS) officer in Berbera. He was stationed in Las Anod in 1981 to 1982.

From 1997 to 2002, Kahin served as the Vice President of Somaliland.

===President of Somaliland===
On 3 May 2002, Kahin became the third President of Somaliland, after the death of the self-declared republic&#x27;s President Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal. Kahin later won the elections on 14 April 2003, representing the Ururka Dimuqraadiga Umada Bahawday (UDUB), or United Democratic People&#x27;s Party. He was sworn into office on 16 May, the day after Egal&#x27;s funeral.

In 2008, Kahin established by decree new regions and districts, which drew criticism. Regions and districts in Somaliland are not just an instrument for the organisation of local government, they are also used as electoral districts. Kahin&#x27;s move was considered by several to have motives rooted in electoral and clan-politics. Moreover, as these new regions and districts were never geographically delimitated, they argued that he saddled the region with a legacy that hampers the efficient organisation of local government to this day.

Throughout his tenure as President of Somaliland, Kahim sought to maintain peace and tranquility in the region. His administration contributed to various state-building and institutional development initiatives. In terms of democratization, his government also successfully organized local council elections, parliamentary elections, and two presidential elections. Additionally, Kahin is noted for having peacefully transferred power to his successor in office, President Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud.

<doc id="522388" wikidata="Q44805" url="?curid=522388" title="San Juan Province, Argentina">
<text>San Juan Province () is a province of Argentina, located in the western part of the country. Neighbouring provinces are, moving clockwise from the north, La Rioja, San Luis and Mendoza. It borders with Chile to the west.

The province has an area of 89,651 km2, covering a mountainous region with scarce vegetation, fertile oases and turbulent rivers. Throughout the province there are a number of paleontological sites.

Similar to other regions in Argentina, agriculture is one of the most important economic activities, highlighting wine production and olive oil. Additionally, a variety of fruits and vegetables are produced in the fertile valleys irrigated by artificial channels in the western part, close to the Andes mountain range. This is the second province in terms of the volume of wine production at the national level and in South America, and possesses outstanding varietal wines. It is also an important center of mining and oil production.

==History==


Before the arrival of Spanish conquistadores, different tribes like Huarpes, Diaguitas, Capazanes, Olongastas and Yacampis, highly influenced by the Inca Empire, inhabited the area.

The city of San Juan de la Frontera was founded by Juan Jufré y Montesa in 1562 and relocated 2 kilometres south in 1593 due to the frequent flooding of the San Juan River.

In 1776, San Juan was annexed to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, becoming one of the cities of the Province of Cuyo. In the same year, the first recorded earthquake caused massive damage to the city.

The father of Argentine independence, Gen. Jose de San Martin, was appointed Governor of the Province of Cuyo in 1814. From there, San Martin began his legendary crossing of the Andes, one of military history&#x27;s great tactical decisions. San Juan, then a small town, was a great supporter of the expedition supplying gold, men and mules.

In 1820, San Juan was granted autonomy from the Province of Cuyo, thereby becoming an autonomous province. The remainder of Cuyo region became Mendoza Province.

Following an era of international isolation for Argentina, the advent of new, more liberal government in 1853 attracted a number of exiled intellectuals back into San Juan. Among these, was a San Juan military officer and novelist named Domingo Sarmiento. Sarmiento was eventually elected governor in 1862, pursuing sorely needed public investments and enacting Argentina&#x27;s first law mandating compulsory education (at that time about 80% of the adult population lacked any form of education). Once elected President of Argentina in 1868, those policies became national law.

In 1944 a moderate, yet highly destructive earthquake near the capital destroyed most of the city and killed 10,000 people. A fundraiser was organized to raise money for the victims of the quake where Colonel Juan Perón met his eventual wife and political companion Eva Duarte.

A more powerful earthquake stuck the same city in 1977; however new construction codes put in effect following the 1944 incident kept damage to a relative minimum. The most noteworthy loss following this event was the destruction of the Cathedral of San Juan (&quot;image, at top&quot;). A new, modernist house of worship was quickly put up in its place and inaugurated in 1979.

Among the most rapidly growing provinces in Argentina after 1945, the national government began the construction of the , which opened its doors in 1973. Congress further responded to the needs of San Juan&#x27;s growing agricultural sector by breaking ground in the mid &#x27;70s for the largest hydrostructural project in the province up to that point, the . Inaugurated in 1980, it has contributed to the province&#x27;s production of irrigated desert crops, like olives, figs and, most importantly, wine grapes.

In 2005, Barrick Gold Corporation, one of the world&#x27;s largest gold-mining conglomerates, announced the purchase of large tracts in the San Juan Andes where a gold mine was started. These have, so far, been yielding over 11,000 ounces of gold yearly, though evidence suggests these activities may be having an adverse impact on San Juan&#x27;s glaciers.

In 2007, the same company installed the world&#x27;s highest-situated wind turbine at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province at nearly 4,200m elevation.

==Geography==


The province is part of the continental semi-desert Cuyo region. The arid plains start on the east, with a few low hills in the middle and swiftly turn into 6,000-meter-high mountain peaks towards the west. Both areas are subject to the dry hot Zonda (a kind of foehn wind). Most of the precipitations take place during the summer, often as electrical storms.

The hot wind has modeled the clay-rich red soil into &quot;Pampa del Leoncito&quot; (&quot;Reserva Natural Estricta El Leoncito&quot;) and &quot;Valle de la Luna&quot; (&quot;Parque Provincial Ischigualasto&quot;) 200-million-year-old geological formations.

The Jáchal and San Juan rivers, both part of Desaguadero River system, are the source of fertile valleys and centre of the province&#x27;s economy. The San Juan River finishes in the Huanacache lagoons (sometimes called &quot;Guanacache&quot;), on the southeast.

The Andes of San Juan Province belong to the Dry Andes climatic province. Permafrost is widespread above 3000 masl in the Andes and rock glaciers are common.

The northern part of the province contain both intrusive rocks of the Colangüil Batholith and a large sedimentary basin known as Iglesia Basin. Within this basin there are hot springs.

==Demographics==
San Juan concentrates most of its population in the oases or central valleys, Tulum Valley, Zonda, Ullum and Jáchal, containing nearly 80% of this population. The remaining is located in the oasis located at the foot of the Andes in Iglesias and Calingasta. Another population concentration is in Fertile Valley.

==Economy==
San Juan focuses its economy in agriculture, specially wine production. Additionally, preserved foods production is highly developed. Mining is a growing activity, with the extraction of various minerals financed by multinational companies. Tourism is a relatively new and flourishing activity and it is becoming an important source of revenue for the province.

San Juan&#x27;s is a somewhat underdeveloped, yet diversified, economy. Its output was estimated in 2006 at US$3.613 billion, or US$5,827 per capita (a third less than the national average).

Agriculture has, traditionally, played a small, though significant role in San Juan&#x27;s economy. The province produces crops not widely grown in other regions of Argentina. San Juan is the second-largest producer of Argentine Wine, after neighboring Mendoza Province.

The winemaking industry reached San Juan between the years 1569 and 1589 carried by the Spanish conquistadors. Blessed by the optimal weather conditions and soil, the wine-making largely expanded and accelerated development in the province. Since the beginning, the inhabitants of the region understood that the arid climate required an advanced artificial irrigation system with dams and channels.

Viticulture is the main crop of the province&#x27;s economy, with some 500 km2 (56% of the productive area), and the rest is reserved for wine production counting 90% of the crop. Other products include tomato, maize, potato, fig and peach.

Since 1980, San Juan has experienced an industrial expansion that now includes, in addition to the wineries, food processing plants, chemical, plastics, iron, auto parts and textiles factories. Manufacturing now accounts for nearly 20% of San Juan&#x27;s production output.

In the year 2000, the province came into mineral development with the Veladero Project of Barrick Gold, which, on the first year of mining alone, yielded more than 11,000 ounces of gold. These efforts were intensified with more projects including the Easter Lama, with the particularity that it is shared with neighboring Chile. The more widespread mining products are gold, lead, graphite and clay.

Large-scale efforts began, in 2006, in the search for petroleum in the department of Jáchal.

Energy production is mainly hydroelectric, produced by a few dams such as Quebrada de Ullum, La Roza, San Emiliano and El Pinar Station, which also help to regulate the water level for irrigation of the arid lands. Electricity is also produced, in a lesser proportion, by thermal power stations.

San Juan has recently started to have a flourishing tourism industry. Remarkable places are the city of San Juan, the Ischigualasto Provincial Park, the Ullum Dam, San Guillermo National Park, the Pismanta hot springs, the Mercedario Mount and the pagan &quot;Difunta Correa&quot; shrine. These sites are specially suitable for ecotourism or adventure tourism. Furthermore, an increase in agrotourism has started recently, particularly, around the wine industry, creating the so-called &quot;Wine Routes.&quot;

== Government ==

The provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution of San Juan Province, Argentina forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the San Juan Provincial Police.

==Political division==

The province is divided into 19 departments (). They are formally considered to be a single municipality, and usually contain one or more population centers (i.e. towns and cities).

==Tourism==

San Juan, known as &quot;The Land of the Sun&quot;, offers mountains, valleys and turbulent rivers of melting glacier water from the Andes. This features create a unique landscape that is beginning to be intensively exploited by tourism.

Tourism infrastructure has been also improved recently with the installation of a considerable number of hotels and other accommodation. Heavily developed areas are the northwest, in the town of Rodeo, where posts and countryside hotels have been installed. In the west, the towns of Calingasta Barreal and Tamberías, many projects are being develop to foster adventure tourism by with the practice of climbing the Mount Mercedario, which is one of the highest peaks in America. The northern zone, Jáchal, is known for its cultural tourism related to the gaucho tradition.

Nevertheless, San Juan is the economic center of the province and also the most visited place. It is known for its modern architecture that differentiates it from others cities in the rest of the country, with wide tree-lined streets as well as hardwood parks, plazas and walkways, in the middle of the desert of San Juan. This is the cause for which has the nickname of &#x27;city oasis&#x27;. The city holds several attractions such as Sarmiento&#x27;s birthplace and modern Cathedral, among others.

A number of joyful celebrations are held in the province, combining old and new traditions that pay homage to economic activities or natural events like Fiesta Nacional del Sol, which takes the form of annual parades carousel and various artistic performances. 
The winter sports industry has a prosper future in the province. A ski resort is under development, located in the mountainous area of Calingasta, western part of the province, where the largest ski tracks in South America are being constructed. This will be the northernmost ski resort in Argentina and will be known as &quot;Manantiales&quot;&#x27;

==Transportation==
San Juan has a good transportation network, as most of the routes that connect with the rest of the country are in very good maintenance condition. The more important routes are the RN40, which crosses from north to south and joins the provinces of Mendoza and La Rioja, the RN20, which links San Juan with the city of Buenos Aires and Cordoba, the RN150, which allows a connection to the country of Chile. There are important projects under way that will allow a connection with the province of La Rioja, the entire northern Fertile Valley, Jáchal and Church, and with Chile, which will be a vital part of the strategic corridor Pacific-Atlantic .

This project for the construction of a communication path connecting the Pacific ports of (Coquimbo, Chile) and Atlantic (Porto Alegre, Brazil) by Paso de Agua Negra, has been under development for more than a decade. Its importance lies in the necessity of the Southern Cone countries to put their export production into the global market at lower costs. 
Long-distance transportation exists and allows weekly trips to almost all the other provinces and cities in the country. The main hub is the modern bus terminal of the city of San Juan. There are another important transportation centers in San José de Jáchal and in the city of Caucete, which is currently under construction. By bus, it takes around 18 hours to get Buenos Aires.

There are daily flight services to Buenos Aires from Domingo Faustino Sarmiento Airport.

The public transportation system in the city of San Juan and surrounding areas includes buses that connect downtown with other cities such as Villa Krause, Rivadavia, Santa Lucia, Villa Paula Sarmiento Albarracín and Aberastain. Private taxis (called &quot;Remis&quot;) and public taxis also exist. Rapid population growth has led to a number of projects for the construction of mass transit systems.

<text>The Owl Creek Mountains are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains in central Wyoming in the United States, running east to west to form a bridge between the Absaroka Range to the northwest and the Bridger Mountains to the east. The range forms the boundary between the Bighorn Basin to the north and the Shoshone Basin to the south. The Wind River passes through the gap between the range and the Bridger Mountains to the east, and becomes the Bighorn River on the north side of the mountains. The high point of the range is . The range is entirely within the Wind River Indian Reservation.

==Geology==
During the Tertiary period, the rivers in the region removed much of the basin fill exposing older bedrock. The rocks in the Owl Creek Range date from the Mississippian age through the Cretaceous period. 
The mountains likely emerged in the late Cretaceous, in the Laramide orogeny. In areas near the Boysen Fault, just north of Boysen Reservoir&#x27;s dam at the southern mouth of Wind River Canyon, erosion has removed the upper part of the thrust of the mountain, exposing Cambrian and Ordovician rocks, overlaying Triassic age rocks. 

Wind River Canyon has several markers along the main roadway through it, which indicate the time period the rocks are from. 

Metavolcanic rocks of predominantly basaltic and dacitic composition have been found in the canyon.

<doc id="522394" wikidata="Q429006" url="?curid=522394" title="Duathlon">
<text>Duathlon is an athletic event that consists of a running leg, followed by a cycling leg and then another running leg in a format similar to triathlons. The World Triathlon governs the sport internationally.

==Distance and format==
Duathlons are conducted at sprint, standard, middle and long distances. The following distances are considered typical for the sport; however, individual races may vary. 
*Sprint distance - 5 km run, 20 km bike, 2.5 km run
*Standard distance - 10 km run, 40 km bike, 5 km run
*Middle distance - 10 km run, 60 km bike, 10 km run
*Long distance - 10 km run, 150 km bike, 30 km run

===Off-road duathlon===
Off-road duathlon is a form of duathlon, where the competitors have to go through a trail-running stage and a mountain-biking stage, finishing with a final running stage. Off-road duathlons are distinguished from conventional duathlons in that the terrain for the cycling and running stages are generally unpaved, rough, and very steep and hilly. They require different techniques than conventional duathlon races, and the athletes employ mountain bikes rather than road bikes.

==Relationships to similar sports==
Duathlons are most similar to triathlons, with the key difference being the replacement of the swimming leg with a second run. Other sports derived from triathlon include aquathlon, which combines swimming and running but has omitted the cycling part, and aquabike, with the swim and bike and no run.

The word &quot;duathlon&quot; is also used for some events which comprise running or walking and cycling, but not in three stages, such as the annual Highland Cross in Scotland. The word &quot;duathlon&quot; does not appear in the online &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; , nor in the 11th edition (2008) of &quot;Chambers Dictionary&quot;, but a definition available online from Collins English Dictionary defines it as &quot;an athletic contest in which each athlete competes in running and cycling events&quot; without specifying the three-stage structure of the International Triathlon Union&#x27;s definition.

==Team duathlon==

In this variation, the cycling and running segments need to be undertaken simultaneously by a team consisting of a predetermined number of individuals. Only one of the team members is running while all others are cycling. All the members of a team must be together at any given point of time but exchanging the tasks of running and cycling amongst the team members themselves is permitted.

The challenge is to rotate the task of running at an optimum rate such that the time from start to destination is minimized. This demands a smooth coordination amongst all team members which makes the sport more exciting. An example is the 100 km-Duathlon around Dresden which is the oldest of its kind in Germany.

== Notable duathlons ==
World Triathlon organizes the World Triathlon Duathlon Championships on a yearly basis since 1990. Since 2017, it has been part of the World Triathlon Multisport World Championships although it was run as a separate event again in 2021, as the Multisport World Championships was cancelled.

Powerman Duathlon is a major run bike run brand in the world. The Powerman Duathlon World Series is the major international duathlon series with 10-20 middle to long distance races across the globe each year. The series incorporates National, Continental and World Championships as well as numerous series races awarding points to crown an overall series winner at the end of the season after the world championships in September.
The world&#x27;s largest duathlon to date is the inaugural London Duathlon, which took place on 17 September 2005 in Richmond Park, Surrey. Approximately 2,500 people took part. The main race consisted of a run, cycle ride and run. Since 2005 London Duathlon has grown to just under 4,000 participants. 2010 saw the first running of the Ultra Distance at London which will consisted of run, bike and run. In its ninth year, London Duathlon took place on Sunday 14 September 2014 and offered athletes of all abilities the chance to race through the stunning surroundings of Richmond Park while on closed roads. &quot;Classic&quot; distance consists of a run, cycle ride and run.

The World&#x27;s premier duathlon is Powerman Zofingen, in Switzerland. It is a hilly run, mostly on trails, followed by a very hilly road bike consisting of three, loops each of which feature the Bodenburg ascent (scene of Kenny Souza&#x27;s DNF in a snow storm when he raced in a neon Speedo and small tank top), and finally a very hilly two loop trail run.

The longest continually running duathlon series is still organized by the NY Triathlon Club in and around New York City, US.

With the popularity of extreme sports, a new form of duathlon has become popular in the last few years. Referred to as an off-road duathlon, or &quot;Dirty-Du&quot;, it consists of an off-road or trail run, followed by a mountain bike leg followed by a final off-road or trail run. The Dirty Du off-road duathlon series, held in Texas, was made famous by Lance Armstrong, who won it in 2003.

<text>Yes You Can was a Canadian children&#x27;s television series broadcast on CBC Television from 1980 to 1983. Hosted by singer Kevin Gillis, and co-hosted by Trevor Bruneau and Tammy Bourne, the half-hour live-action series was sports-themed and encouraged fitness and good health. Also featured were the comedic Coach Cuddles Ford (played by Patrick Ford), and two animated characters, &quot;Harry Hog&quot; and &quot;Body Man&quot;, voiced by Michael Magee.

Each show also featured an appearance from a professional athlete, such as Gordie Howe, Karen Kain and Toller Cranston.

The show was written by Jack Hutchinson and Jamie Wayne, produced by Bill Hunt, directed by Ron Piggott and executive produced by Michael Lansbury.

Reruns of &quot;Yes You Can&quot; aired in the launch schedules of TSN and YTV.

Kevin Gillis went on to create and produce &quot;The Christmas Raccoons&quot; animated special – which led to &quot;The Raccoons on Ice&quot;, &quot;The Raccoons and the Lost Star&quot;, &quot;The Raccoons: Let&#x27;s Dance!&quot; and &quot;The Raccoons&quot; animated series. Many of the songs Gillis used the &quot;Yes You Can&quot; series were later re-recorded and used in the &quot;Raccoons&quot; animated series.

<text>Battlecruiser 3000AD is a space trading and combat simulator video game developed by 3000 AD. It was designed by 3000 AD president and lead developer Derek Smart as the studio&#x27;s first project.

Announced in 1992, the game underwent a lengthy and troubled development history. It was first released against Smart&#x27;s wishes in 1996 by publisher Take-Two Interactive for MS-DOS and Windows and negatively received for its incomplete nature. A patched version was later released for Windows by publisher Interplay Entertainment in 1998. It was released in 2021 on Steam as a compilation pack titled &quot;Battlecruiser Generations&quot;, which included both versions of 3000AD and its sequel &quot;Millennium&quot;. Smart designed and self-published a sequel entitled &quot;Millennium&quot;, which was released in 2001, and an updated version was released by publisher DreamCatcher Interactive in 2003.

==Story==
The game takes place in the year 3000 AD, centuries after mankind has developed advanced spacecraft, and discovered new worlds and intelligent life-forms within and beyond the Solar system. However, space travel is described as restricted to military personnel and scientists despite its conveniences. The story goes on to describe an interplanetary war, started in 2041AD, with Earth involved. In 2044AD, Galactic Command (GALCOM) is formed to maintain law and order amongst planets. The Gammulan race opposes the alliance and war is waged between GALCOM and Gammulans.

The player takes the role of a recruit assigned to defend the GALCOM consortium of planets against Gammulans. The events of the game begin with GALCOM diplomatic craft developing a navigational malfunction and straying into Gammulan territory. GALCOM supreme commander Stranix reports a Sphinx class battlecruiser intentionally destroyed by a Gammulan orbital defence system, with no survivors; meanwhile, a team of Renegade class interceptors ambushes a Gammulan starfighter in GALCOM space.

==Gameplay==
*Free Flight: Player freely cruises the galaxy and learns the large array of controls and computer interfaces without fear of attack by alien craft or pirates.
*Advanced Campaign Mode: In this mode the game is dynamic, and changes can occur rapidly and often through political and military influences.
*Xtreme Carnage Combat Simulator: It is a combat simulator that allows the player to gain experience in combat operations, both planetbound and in free flight.

==Development==
Derek Smart began his game development career in the late 1980s, with a vision of creating an all-encompassing space simulation game, featuring strategy elements along with space, planetary, air and ground combat. According to Smart, he began work on &quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD&quot; in 1989. Smart became a notable personality in the video game world during the early 1990s, even before releasing his software debut. Smart became known to the then-nascent online gaming world through discussions taking place on Usenet about the game, his development efforts, and many other topics.

The game first appeared on the cover of &quot;Strategy Plus&quot; in 1992. A release date of April 1993 was announced. Shortly afterwards, Three-Sixty Pacific obtained the rights. It held the rights for a year and went out of business shortly afterwards. 3000AD, Inc. then signed the rights with Mission Studios. Mission Studios also signed a distribution deal with Interplay Productions for its products. The game was showcased in 1994 winter and 1994 summer in CES under the Interplay Affiliated label brand. However, due to financial constraints, an agreement was reached which allowed 3000AD, Inc. to seek a new publisher. Intracorp bid for the rights to publish the game; with a disagreement over source code release, the deal never progressed beyond a letter of intent. The game appeared in E3 1995, then Intracorp went bankrupt shortly afterwards. Take-Two Interactive bought the publishing rights to the game from Mission Studios in 1995, and released v1.00 of the game, with GameTek (UK) publishing the game in 1997.

In Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s SEC filings on February 10, 1997, the company stated that &quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD&quot; accounted for 14.2% of revenue for the fiscal year ending October 31, 1996. The filing also stated that Take-Two Interactive &quot;made advances in the aggregate amount of approximately $618,000&quot; for the title.

== Versions ==
===&quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0&quot;===

Development of version 2.0 of the game continued throughout 1998, and Interplay announced that it would publish an improved version (dubbed &quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0&quot;) through its Value Product Division. Unlike the previous product, only a Windows version was supported.

3D acceleration is supported only through 3dfx hardware. The game now contains 13 alien races, 25 castes. The in-game map contains 25 star systems with 75 planets and 145 moons in total.

===&quot;Battlecruiser Millennium&quot;===

From 1998 to 2001, Smart developed his next game in the &quot;Battlecruiser&quot; franchise, &quot;Battlecruiser Millennium&quot;. The game was to be exclusively distributed at Electronics Boutique locations and was self-published by his company 3000AD, Inc. The deal made with EB was a first of its kind merchant exclusivity deal for a game&#x27;s release, with an independent developer paying for all materials to publish the game for distribution through the retailer. When asked by the gaming media about his thoughts on the deal, Smart stated &quot;I&#x27;m paying for everything. I bear all the risk. I pay for the cost of goods, including the boxes and manuals.&quot;

After its retail run, Smart released &quot;Battlecruiser Millennium&quot; on the Internet for free as he had done with his previous titles. He has mentioned that he intends to keep up this practice of releasing his products for free once their &quot;shelf life&quot; has expired.

===&quot;Battlecruiser Millennium Gold&quot;===

It is a version of &quot;Battlecruiser Millennium&quot; with complete updates. A client-server multiplayer engine is introduced in this version. Flight controls can now be done using a mouse.

Other new elements include:
*One new small galaxy containing 12 space regions, 12 planetary regions, 272 planetary mission zones and 1,086 planetary areas of interest (scenes). This galaxy does not include a map. All the new scenarios included in this game take place in this new galaxy. The full map now includes 152 space regions containing 238 planets, 4,033 planetary mission zones, 21,548 planetary areas of interest in total.
*44 planetary starbases, 1,011 military bases and 13 star stations. The full map now includes 96 starbases, 14,408 military bases and 71 star stations in total.
*20 new Instant Action scenarios with a variety of missions ranging from easy to extremely hard, which brings the total number of Instant Action scenarios to 45.
*One new ACM scenario (Broken Arrow?) with multi-branch scenarios which can either end up being 11 or 15 missions depending on the resolution of certain missions. In the GameStop exclusive version of the game, there is yet another ACM scenario. The total number of ACM scenarios is five depending on version.

The developer originally intended to introduce multiplayer feature when making the original &quot;Battlecruiser Millennium&quot; back in late 1999, but due to unforeseen circumstances, this feature was dropped in the initial product. The product was to use the RTIME Interactive Networking Engine.

When the game was redesigned, the developer discovered that the original design architecture of the game kernel prevented the implementation of multiplayer, so the game was redesigned. Further information about it was revealed in the Smart Speak section of the manual.

===Cancelled releases===
*&quot;Battlecruiser Commander&quot; - It is the working title for the sequel of &quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD&quot;.
*&quot;Battlecruiser 3020AD&quot; - It is the working title for the sequel of &quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD&quot;, to be released after Battlecruiser Millennium. The game would include an online multiplayer universe, and a first-person in-ship mode.
*&quot;BC3K: Strike Pak&quot; - This game allows the player to board, in a first-person perspective, ships targeted by the player. It was designed to be a standalone game or be linked to &quot;Battlecruiser Commander&quot;.
*&quot;BC3K: Skirmish Pak&quot; - This was intended to be a multiplayer addon to the &quot;Battlecruiser Commander&quot;, but the multiplayer feature had never been implemented until &quot;Battlecruiser Millennium Gold&quot;.
*&quot;Battlecruiser Tactical Engagement&quot; - It is an in-ship first-person perspective add-on module for &quot;Battlecruiser Millennium&quot;. That project was replaced by &quot;Project ABC,&quot; for &quot;After Battlecruiser,&quot; which later became &quot;Universal Combat&quot;. A prototype for the add-on was produced.
*&quot;Battlecruiser Online&quot; - It is a massively multiplayer online version of &quot;Battlecruiser Generations&quot; (later called &quot;Universal Combat&quot;), with an off-line single-player training component. However, neither Battlecruiser Online nor Universal Combat series have included games that feature persistent online worlds.

==Controversies==
After publisher Take-Two Interactive released &quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD&quot; in September 1996, it generated one of the longest and largest flame wars in the history of Usenet. This flame war lasted for several years, garnered over 70,000 posts, and yielded a series of sites that documented and parodied its history.

Smart and Take-Two Interactive advertised that &quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD&quot; used a neural network to perform artificial intelligence tasks in the game. However, this claim has been criticised as highly improbable by other game designers. In one article in a computer games magazine, Keith Zabalaoui, former NASA programmer and one of the designers of the &quot;Close Combat&quot; series of strategy games, was quoted as saying, &quot;I have a hard time believing it&#x27;s in there... the concept of training [neural nets] to do the complex tasks required in a game is inconceivable. It&#x27;s mumbo jumbo. I guarantee you that if there&#x27;s a neural net that does &quot;anything&quot; in [BC3K] this man would be in the Computer Science Hall of fame.&quot;

Upon its initial release of &quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD&quot;, the game contained many bugs that made it unstable, according to a GameSpy.com reviewer, who asserted that &quot;Smart consistently overrates his own products and his own abilities.&quot; For his part, Derek Smart claimed that the buggy release was the responsibility of Take-Two Interactive, who in turn said Smart was solely to blame. After the initial release, Smart issued several patches and upgrades for the product over the next few months, and eventually a final patch was released to fix some of the major bugs. In February 1998, after obtaining publishing rights from Take-Two Interactive, Smart released the game on the Internet for download free of charge.

Derek Smart filed a lawsuit against Take-Two Interactive (who also released the game in the UK through a sub-license deal with GameTek), alleging breach of contract. The lawsuit was later settled out of court, and both parties released statements of resolution in late 1998. Smart regained the rights to the game via the settlement. He continued to develop a new version through his personal company, &quot;3000 AD&quot;.

Gametek promoted the game in the UK with a notorious print ad featuring model Joanne Guest wearing lingerie and straddling a copy of the game. THQ later ran a parody of the ad, featuring a fully dressed, matronly woman mimicking Guest&#x27;s pose (down to her chewing on the same finger) and &quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD&quot; replaced by a sign with the THQ logo.

==Reception==
&quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD&quot; was covered extensively in gaming magazines during the development process, including a 1992 cover story in &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;. The game was marketed as &quot;The last thing you&#x27;ll ever desire&quot; in pre-release ads that ran in computer gaming magazines.

&quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD&quot; was released against the wishes of its main designer, Derek Smart, as it was still incomplete and buggy. GameSpot gave it a score of 2.6/10, writing that &quot;it will go down in legend as the most bug-ridden, unstable, unplayable pieces of software ever released.&quot; A column about video game patches in &quot;Next Generation&quot; remarked that the patches for &quot;Battlecruiser 3000&quot; &quot;broke as many elements as [they] fixed&quot;.

&quot;Battlecruiser Millennium&quot; was better received, with scores of 65% and 68% at aggregate review sites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. According to some reviews of the game, it was as encompassing and strategically pleasing as the developer had set out to make, but lacked in user interface design friendliness and atmosphere. In 2003 Gamespy named it the 19th most overrated game of all time due to the hype Smart produced with his extremely ambitious gameplay promises that he would ultimately be unable to fulfill.

The game shipped around 80,000 units.

<text>Sorbose is a ketose belonging to the group of sugars known as monosaccharides. It has a sweetness that is equivalent to sucrose (table sugar). The commercial production of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) often begins with sorbose. -Sorbose is the configuration of the naturally occurring sugar. It can be prepared from inexpensive O-benzylglucose. 

==Synthesis==
Under conditions employed for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, the tetra-O-benzyl aldose converts to tetra-&quot;O&quot;-benzylsorbose. Hydrogenolysis removes the four benzyl groups, leaving sorbose.

<text>In organic chemistry, an amino sugar is a sugar molecule in which a hydroxyl group has been replaced with an amine group. More than 60 amino sugars are known, with one of the most abundant being &quot;N&quot;-acetyl--glucosamine (a 2-amino-2-deoxysugar), which is the main component of chitin.

Derivatives of amine containing sugars, such as &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid, whose nitrogens are part of more complex functional groups rather than formally being amines, are also considered amino sugars. Aminoglycosides are a class of antimicrobial compounds that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. These compounds are conjugates of amino sugars and aminocyclitols.

==Synthesis==

===From glycals===
Glycals are cyclic enol ether derivatives of monosaccharides, having a double bond between carbon atoms 1 and 2 of the ring. &quot;N&quot;-functionalized of glycals at the C2 position, combined with glycosidic bond formation at C1 is a common strategy for the synthesis of amino sugars. This can be achieved using azides with subsequent reduction yielding the amino sugar. One advantage of introducing azide moiety at C-2 lies in its non-participatory ability, which could serve as the basis of stereoselective synthesis of 1.2-cis-glycosidic linkage.

Azides give high regioselectivity, however stereoselectivity both at C-1 and C-2 is generally poor. Usually anomeric mixtures will be obtained and the stereochemistry formed at C-2 is heavily dependent upon the starting substrates. For galactal, addition of azide to the double bond will preferentially occur from equatorial direction because of steric hindrance at the top face caused by axial group at C-4. For glucal, azide could attack from both axial and equatorial directions with almost similar probability, so its selectivity will decrease.

Glycals may also be converted into amino sugars by nitration followed by treatment with thiophenol (Michael addition) to furnish a thioglycoside donor. This is a versatile donor and can react with simple or carbohydrate alcohols to establish the glycosidic linkage, with reduction and &quot;N&quot;-acetylation of nitro group will give the targeted product.

One-pot reactions have also been reported. For instance glycal, activated by thianthrene-5-oxide and Tf2O is treated with an amide nucleophile and a glycosyl acceptor to produce various 1,2-trans C-2-amidoglycosides. Both the C-2 nitrogen introduction and the glycosidic bond formation precede stereoselectively. This methodology makes the introduction of both natural and non-natural amide functionalities at C-2 possible and more importantly with glycosidic bond formation at the same time in a one-pot procedure.

=== Via nucleophilic displacement===
Nucleophilic displacement can be an effective strategy for the synthesis of amino sugars, however success strongly depends upon the nature of nucleophile, the type of leaving group and site of displacements on sugar rings. One aspect of this problem is that displacements at the C2 position tend to be slow as it is adjacent to the anomeric centre; this is particularly true for glycosides with axially-oriented aglycones.

Epoxides are suitable starting materials for realizing nucleophilic displacement reaction to introduce azide into C-2. Anhydrosugar 21 could be transformed into thioglycoside 22, which serves as a donor to react with alcohols to obtain 2-azide-2-deoxy-&quot;O&quot;-glycosides. The subsequent reduction and &quot;N&quot;-acetylation will furnish the desired 2-&quot;N&quot;-acetamido-2-deoxyglycosides.

<text>XPM was a short-lived Canadian television sitcom broadcast in 2004 on CBC Television. It was centred on shamed former Prime Minister Bennett Macdonald, played by Don Ferguson, who was trying to adjust to a life where the best job he could find was at a small law firm in a shopping mall. The series also starred Dave Broadfoot as Macdonald&#x27;s law partner, Kathy Greenwood as his wife, and Jessica Holmes as his secretary Jasmine.

The series produced just two episodes, which the CBC aired back-to-back as a one-off comedy special on February 27, 2004, after declining to pick up any further episodes. It was created by Steven Barwin and Gabriel David Tick, who were also executive producers along with Don Ferguson and Roger Abbott.

<doc id="522413" wikidata="Q38650" url="?curid=522413" title="Rough Collie">
<text>The Rough Collie (also known as the Long-Haired Collie) is a long-coated dog breed of medium to large size that, in its original form, was a type of collie used and bred for herding sheep in Scotland. More recent breeding has focused on the Collie as a show dog, and also companion. The breed specifications call for a distinctive long narrow tapered snout and tipped (&quot;semiprick&quot;) ears, so some dogs have their ears taped when young. Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable and white (sometimes mahogany), blue merle, tri-coloured, and colour-headed white.

Originating in the 19th century, the breed is now well known through the stories of author Albert Payson Terhune about his dog &quot;Lad&quot;, and later with Eric Knight&#x27;s character of &quot;Lassie&quot; and her novels, movies, and television shows.

There is a smooth-coated variety known as a Smooth Collie; some breed organisations, including both the American and Canadian Kennel Clubs, consider smooth-coat and rough-coat collies to be variations of the same breed. Rough Collies closely resemble the smaller Shetland Sheepdogs or &quot;Shelties&quot;, but the two breeds do not have an exclusive linear relationship.

==History==
Both Rough and Smooth collies are descended from a localised variety of herding dog originating in Scotland and Wales. The Scottish variety was a large, strong, aggressive dog, bred to herd highland sheep. The Welsh variety was small and nimble, domesticated and friendly, and also herded goats. When the English saw these dogs at the Birmingham market, they interbred them with their own variety of sheepdogs, producing a mixture of short- and long-haired varieties. After the Industrial Revolution, dog ownership became fashionable, and these early collies were believed to have been crossed with the Borzoi (Russian Wolfhound) to get a more &quot;noble&quot; head (longer muzzle), which is today one of the true characteristics of the Rough Collie. It is not known conclusively if the Borzoi cross made it into the mainstream of the breed.

When Queen Victoria acquired a Rough Collie, after seeing one at Balmoral Castle, they were transformed into something of a fashion item. Continued breeding for show purposes drastically changed the appearance of the dogs; in the 1960s, it was a much taller dog than it is today (in the UK; in the US, the size standard has not been revised downward and dogs have remained between 24 and 26&quot;). Earlier dogs were also more sturdy in build and reportedly capable of covering up to 100 miles in one day. In the UK the Rough Collie is no longer used for serious herding, having been replaced by the Border Collie, though in the United States and a number of European countries, there has been a resurgence in the use of the Collie as a working and performance dog.

The Collie Club of America is one of the oldest breed-specific clubs in existence in the United States (founded in 1886). The Collie Club in England dates from 1881.

Quoted from Collie Club of America:
Unfortunately, the Collie&#x27;s exact origins are shrouded in obscurity. It has been the subject of much research and speculation. The word &quot;Collie&quot; is as obscure as the breed itself. The name has been spelled many different ways: Coll, Colley, Coally and Coaly. Generally, the most accepted origin of the word is &quot;Coll&quot; - the Anglo-Saxon word for &quot;black&quot;.

In the 18th century, the Rough Collie&#x27;s natural home was in the highlands of Scotland, where he had been used for centuries as a sheepdog. The dogs were bred with great care in order to assist their masters in the herding and guarding of their flock.

 Without a doubt, it is to the English fancy of the late 1800s that the breed owes its development as a popular show dog. Rough Collies were first exhibited in 1860 at the Birmingham, England dog show, in the generic class &quot;Scotch Sheep-Dogs&quot;.
In 1879 the first English Rough Collie was imported to this country. It is from England that we find the famous pillars of the breed, from which the American fanciers sought not only their next big winner, but also their foundation stock.

By the turn of the century, the American Rough Collie was in a state of continued development. The breed continued to thrive in England. American show prizes were dominated by the British imports. As a result of the imports, the breed made rapid progress between 1900 to 1920. These dogs built the foundations upon which the present day Rough Collie is based and paved the way for the emergence of the great American kennels of the 1920s and 1930s

==Appearance==

Recognized colours include:

* Sable and white, where the &quot;sable&quot; ranges from pale tan to a mahogany
* Tricolour, which is primarily black edged in tan
* Merle, Blue or Sable merle, which is mottled. 
* Colour-headed white, which is a mainly all-white coat, except for the head, which could be tri-, sable or blue.

All have white coat areas, in the collar, parts of the leg, and usually the tail tip. Some may have white blazes on their faces. Note that the American Kennel Club accepts &quot;colour-headed white&quot;, where the dog is predominantly white with coloured markings of sable, tricolour, or blue merle on the head and sometimes body patches. The downy undercoat is covered by a long, dense, coarse outer coat with a notable ruff around the neck, feathers about the legs, a petticoat on the abdomen, and a frill on the hindquarters.One of the characteristic features of the Rough Collie is its head. This is light in relation to the rest of the body, and resembles a blunted wedge tapering smoothly from ears to black nose, with a distinct stop and parallel head planes. The muzzle is well rounded, and never square. There is considerable variation in the colour of the head, however. The eyes are medium-sized and almond shaped. The ears are supposed to be &quot;semi-prick&quot;, or &quot;tipped&quot;, with the upper third folded over. Ears which do not &quot;tip&quot; properly, however, are common, and many collies have their ears &quot;taped&quot; as puppies (using medical adhesive or paper tape) to encourage them to lie properly – no cutting or surgery is involved.

Rough Collies have a more blunt, gradually tapering, face than the smaller, but otherwise very similar Shetland Sheepdog, which is partly descended from the Rough Collie. The planes of the muzzle and the top of the skull should be parallel in collies, with a slight but distinct stop. (In shelties, the planes are not parallel.) The ears of a Rough Collie are similar to a Shetland Sheepdog&#x27;s, but larger. Furthermore, once seen, the contrast between the Rough Collie head and that of a Border Collie is immediately apparent, the latter having a considerably shorter muzzle and a more distinct stop between muzzle and forehead. The ruff is also distinctive in distinguishing the two breeds.

The size and weight varies among breed standards; male collies can stand 55.8 to 66 cm (22 to 26 in) at the shoulder; the female averages 5 cm (2 in) shorter. The males are usually in the weight range (50–70 lbs), and the females are usually 5 to 10 lbs less. Collies in the US are sometimes reported to be over one hundred pounds, but a large collie typically weighs no more than 70 pounds. US and UK standards may differ. The UK standard calls for dogs to be significantly smaller than those under the American Kennel Club.

==Temperament==

Rough collies should show no nervousness or aggression, and are generally great with children and other animals. However, they must be well socialised to prevent shyness. They are medium to large sized dogs, and they generally need a house instead of being in a small apartment. Like many herding dogs, collies can be fairly vocal, and some are easily trained not to bark. The amount of herding instinct varies, with some dogs being quite drivey and others calmer.

Rough Collies are very loyal and may be one-family dogs (although most make exceptions for children), but are very rarely aggressive or protective beyond barking and providing a visual deterrent. They are typically excellent with kids. They are eager to learn and respond best to a gentle hand.

The rough collie&#x27;s long coat has made the breed successful on northern Midwest farms as an able herder and guardian of the farm during the winter. The dog needs to be gradually acclimated to the cold and a suitable insulated outdoor shelter must be provided for the dog along with ample quality food and a source of unfrozen water. The rough collie also relishes playing in the snow with children during the winter months. They guard the farm while the owner is away and are naturally protective of small children.

==Health==

While Rough Collies are generally resilient and healthy, there are some health problems that can affect the breed.

Collie eye anomaly (CEA), a genetic disease which causes improper development of the eye and possible blindness, is a common ailment in the breed. More rarely, Rough Collies can be affected by progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), another genetic disease in which bilateral degeneration of the retina results in progressive vision loss culminating in blindness. Through genetic testing and careful screening program it would be theoretically possible to eradicate both of these problems in purebred lines, however, certainly in the UK, the Kennel Club does not require these tests to be done either for registration or showing. CEA is so prevalent that elimination of affected dogs except through very slow and careful breeding decisions to avoid shrinking the gene pool more than absolutely necessary. Rough Collie puppies should be screened at an early age (6–8 weeks) by a certified veterinary ophthalmologist to check for CEA. PRA has a later onset and can be detected by DNA test, but is much less widespread (in the US) than CEA. (In the UK, PRA is more common.) Note, the UK Kennel Club &quot;Accredited Breeder Scheme&quot; requires eye tests and &quot;recommends&quot; the genetic test for this class of members.

Canine cyclic neutropenia is a cyclic blood disorder that is usually fatal to affected puppies. The disease is also referred to as &quot;gray collie syndrome&quot;, due to affected puppies having a pale gray, pinkish/gray or beige colouring, none of which are normal Rough Collie colours. Puppies that survive through adulthood are plagued with immune disorders throughout their lives and rarely live more than three years. DNA testing can help detect carriers of the recessive gene that causes the disease.

Hip dysplasia: As with most of the larger breeds, hip dysplasia is a potential concern for Rough Collies. Although this disease appears to be &quot;multigene&quot;, careful selection by many breeders is reducing this problem. The UK Kennel Club &quot;Accredited Breeder Scheme&quot; requires hip-scores this class of members, however, a very small proportion of UK registered puppies are bred under this scheme. Hip dysplasia is rare in collies compared to their closest relatives and other breeds of the same size.Rough Collies may carry a mutant Mdr1 gene that results in a sensitivity to Ivermectin and related drugs. A screening test is used to determine if alternative medications are required. Overdoses from the proscribed medications can result in neurological impairment or even death, but preventative doses are usually safe. This faulty gene is present in several breeds, but is well known among collies.

In addition to these problems, all of which can be tested for, there are a number of problems which are thought to be genetic but for which no screening test exists. These include epilepsy, bloat, a tendency towards allergies, and thyroid disorders (primarily hypothyroidism.). Because no DNA tests exist for these disorders (and all can have causes other than genetic origins), breeders can only do their best to avoid producing them by removing affected dogs from the gene pool.

Ulcerative dermatosis of Shetland sheepdog and rough collie (UDSSC) is a disease that is believed to be a vesicular variant of discoid lupus erythematosus. It is an ulcerative dermatosis that affects the thigh, groin, axillae, and ventral abdomen.

In the 18th century, the Collie&#x27;s natural home was in the highlands of Scotland, where it had been used for centuries as a sheepdog. The dogs were bred with great care in order to assist their masters in the herding and guarding of their flock.

Collies are capable of being keen herders while remaining sensible, flexible family companions, whether as working dogs on a ranch or farm or helping out a suburban owner who keeps a few sheep, goats, or ducks as a hobby. Participation in herding helps preserve the special heritage of the Collie and opens up new opportunities for owner and dog. The qualities that make a good herding dog – trainability, adaptability, loyalty, soundness of body and character, agility, grace – are important in many areas, and contribute so much toward making the dog an outstanding companion as well.

Throughout the country there are local herding clubs that provide clinics, work days, trials and tests. Several organizations provide herding title programs in which Collies regularly participate. A Herding Instinct Test introduces Collies and their handlers to herding at the basic level. It is designed to show whether or not a Collie, who may have never had any exposure to livestock, still has the natural instinct to perform the function for which the breed was initially created. It is a non-competitive introduction to carefully selected and easily handled livestock under favorably controlled conditions.

===Activities===
Rough Collies can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, conformation, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Rough Collies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. The breed has also been known to work as search and rescue dogs, therapy dogs and guide dogs for the blind.

==Notable Rough Collies==
* Lassie, a line of Rough Collies originally owned by Rudd Weatherwax that have starred in numerous films, multiple television series, a radio program, and has been the subject of various novels and non-fiction works. One of the few animal actors to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
* Reveille is the name of the current mascot of Texas A&amp;M University. Since Reveille III became the mascot in 1966, each dog to bear that name has been a Rough Collie; the current mascot is Reveille X. She assumed her duties in 2021, and she was donated by Rough Collie breeders Julie Hinrichsen and Russell Dyke of Juell Collies.
* Dylan, Argentine president Alberto Fernández&#x27;s pet dog.
* Lad, the main hero of Albert Payson Terhune&#x27;s early 20th-century novels about his Sunnybank Rough Collies.
* Wolf, the main hero of Albert Payson Terhune&#x27;s early 20th-century novels about his Sunnybank Rough Collies.
* Gray Dawn, another of Albert Payson Terhune&#x27;s early 20th-century novels about his Sunnybank Rough Collies.

<text>La Rioja (), officially Province of La Rioja is a province of Argentina located in the west of the country. The landscape of the province consists of a series of arid to semi-arid mountain ranges and agricultural valleys in between. It is in one of these valleys that the capital of the province, the city of La Rioja, lies. Neighboring provinces are, from the north clockwise, Catamarca, Córdoba, San Luis and San Juan. The Triassic sauropodomorph dinosaur &quot;Riojasaurus&quot; is named after the province.

==History==
Petroglyphs created by early indigenous peoples at the Talampaya National Park are dated around 10,000 years BC. Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples developed here. The Diaguita, Capayan and the Olongasta peoples inhabited the territory of present-day La Rioja Province at the time of encounter with the Spanish colonists in the 16th century.

Juan Ramírez de Velazco founded &quot;Todos Los Santos de la Nueva Rioja&quot; in 1591 under the government of Tucumán of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In 1630 the Calchaquí people revolted against the Spanish, but the governor Albornoz suppressed them.

In 1783, after the creation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, the control of the province of 10,000 inhabitants passed to the Córdoba independency. The province acquired independence from Córdoba in 1820. Following attempts by Bernardino Rivadavia, the first elected President of Argentina, to impose a centralist constitution, the &quot;caudillo&quot; Juan Facundo Quiroga emerged as a popular leader. He represented their preference for more autonomy, for which they continued to press following Quiroga&#x27;s 1835 assassination. After a period of internal instability in Argentina, the province finally joined the &quot;Argentine Confederation&quot; in 1853.

La Rioja attracted fewer immigrants from Europe than did other Argentine provinces from 1890 to the 1930s.

Some Syrian and Lebanese immigrants did settle in the province, among whom the most well-known is probably the Menem family. Coming from what had been the Ottoman Empire, Saul Menem and his wife were of Armenian and Alawi ancestry. He prospered as a traveling salesman and sent his eldest son, Carlos Menem, to Spain for college. The younger Menem was elected governor of La Rioja Province in March 1973, was imprisoned during the subsequent dictatorship and was elected president of Argentina in 1989, serving until 1999. During those years, he steered billions in federal public works spending into La Rioja. Although the province remains less developed than the average in the nation, its economy today compares favorably with those of its neighbors.

==Geography==

Located in the Argentine Northwest area, its landscape is arid to semi-arid, and the dry climate receives annually 200 mm of precipitation, has short winters, and very hot summers.

From the Andes at the west, with peaks of up to 6,795 meters (&quot;Monte Pissis&quot;), the relief&#x27;s height descends towards the sierras of the neighbouring dry Pampas zone. Most ranges in La Rioja are oriented north-south. The province&#x27;s two largest cities, La Rioja and Chilecito are separated by Sierra de Velasco and west of Chilecito and Famatina rises the Sierra de Famatina with heights of up to 6,250 m.a.sl. (≈20500 feet).

The Talampaya National Park is a dry red-soil canyon of the dry Talampaya river, which contains many cliff walls and rock formations that make it an interesting tourist destination.

==Economy==
La Rioja&#x27;s economy, estimated at US$1.822 billion in 2006, is the second-smallest among Argentina&#x27;s provinces. Its per capita output of US$6,283, though about 30% below the national average, makes it the most well-developed in northern Argentina.

Its economy is, likewise, very well-diversified. Agriculture (long limited by La Rioja&#x27;s dry, mountainous terrain) adds less than 5% to its output. La Rioja&#x27;s agriculture (as well as cities) lies on the banks of the few permanent rivers and oases that allow irrigation, with only 190 square kilometres of cultivated land. Vineyards, nuts and olive plantations are the most common, followed by cotton.

The province&#x27;s main crop is the grape, and its associated wine production, especially around the Chilecito area, with a production of 8 million litres per year.

Cattle (250,000 head) and goats (150,000 head) are secondary activities, particularly for skin and leather. Clay represents the main mining activity, and uranium is also extracted near &quot;El Colorado&quot;.

Manufacturing in La Rioja has expanded considerably since Gov. Menem began attracting investment into the province, after 1983. Limited mostly to light industry like bottling and food processing, it, nevertheless, adds about 20% to La Rioja&#x27;s output. Tourism is, likewise, an expanding activity. Besides the Talampaya National Park, tourists visiting La Rioja usually go also to the Chilecito town, &quot;Cerro de La Cruz&quot;, &quot;Termas de Santa Teresita&quot; hot springs and the village of &quot;Villa Sanagasta&quot;.

Since 2024 it has its own currency, the chacho, which was introduced in response to the economic problems caused by President Javier Milei&#x27;s austerity program and accompanying cuts to federal budget transfers.

== Government ==
The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution of La Rioja Province, Argentina forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the La Rioja Provincial Police.

==Political divisions==
The province is divided in 18 departments (Spanish &quot;departamentos&quot;). They are formally considered to be a single municipality, and usually contain one or more population centers (i.e. towns and cities).

<text>X PixMap (XPM) is an image file format used by the X Window System, created in 1989 by Daniel Dardailler and Colas Nahaboo working at Bull Research Center at Sophia Antipolis, France, and later enhanced by Arnaud Le Hors.

It is intended primarily for creating icon pixmaps, and supports transparent pixels. Derived from the earlier XBM syntax, it is a plain text file in the XPM2 format or of a C programming language syntax, which can be included in a C program file.

== History ==

=== XPM1 ===

The first (1989) XPM format is relatively similar to the XBM format. Compared to XBM, it uses additional macro definitions and variables for indexed colors, and replaces bits with characters for describing the image. The following is a black-and-white image in the 1989 XPM format.
#define XFACE_format 1
#define XFACE_width 48
#define XFACE_height 48
#define XFACE_ncolors 2
#define XFACE_chars_per_pixel 1
static char *XFACE_colors[] = {
&quot;a&quot;, &quot;#ffffff&quot;,
&quot;b&quot;, &quot;#000000&quot;
static char *XFACE_pixels[] = {
&quot;abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab&quot;,
// and so on for 48 rows with 48 pixels
=== XPM2 ===

XPM2 (1990) simplifies the format by removing all C code. The structure is simplified to
* The value section describes the overall dimension of the image similar to the codice_1 statements.
* The color section defines the values, and a new concept of the &quot;type&quot; of the color. The types may be c for &quot;color&quot;, m for &quot;monochrome&quot; output, g for &quot;grayscale&quot;, and s for &quot;symbolic&quot;, explaining what a defined color is supposed to do.
* The pixels and optional extensions remain as in the original format.

The above file, with width 48, height 4, 2 colors, and 1 character per pixel, becomes:

==== Colors ====
In addition to hexcodes, the colors can be any of the X11 color names. In addition, codice_2 indicates transparency.

The &quot;symbolic&quot; feature permits adjusting colors depending on the context where they are used. Code such as codice_3 could be adjusted on a blue background.

==== Many-color encoding ====

One tool is known to use only a to p for 16 colors, switching to aa up to dp for 64 colors, but still reading single character encodings for 64 colors; compare Base64.

With more colors the codes use more characters, e.g. aa up to pp for 16 × 16 = 256 colors. This is less useful for text editors, because a string ab could be actually the middle of two adjacent pixels dabc. Spaces are allowed as color code, but might be a bad idea depending on the used text editor. Without control codes, backslash, and quote (needed in XPM1 and XPM3) 128 − 33 − 2 = 93 ASCII characters are available for single character color codes.

Simplified example: 90 US-ASCII characters could be arranged into nine non-overlapping sets of 10 characters. Thus unambiguous strings of nine characters could set the color of each pixel by its XPM palette index with up to 109 = colors (compare to GIF, which supports only 256).

For XPM2 it is clear how many lines belong to the image – two header lines, the second header line announcing the number of color codes (2 lines in the example above) and rows (height 4 in the example above), e.g. 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 lines.

=== XPM3 ===

The current and last format is XPM3 (1991). It re-introduces the C wrapper, but instead of explicitly showing a file&#x27;s structure, the strings stored are essentially identical to XPM2.
/* XPM */
static char * XFACE[] = {
&quot;48 4 2 1&quot;,
&quot;a c #ffffff&quot;,
&quot;b c #000000&quot;,
&quot;abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab&quot;,
&quot;abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab&quot;,
&quot;abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab&quot;,
&quot;abaabaababaaabaabababaabaabaababaabaaababaabaaab&quot;


If the &quot;values&quot; line contains six instead of four numbers, the additional values indicate the coordinates of a &quot;hotspot&quot;, where 0 0 is the upper left corner of a box containing the icon and the default. A &quot;hotspot&quot; is used for mouse pointers and similar applications.

== Comparison with other formats ==
The following code displays the same blarg file in the XBM, XPM and PBM formats.

XBM version:
#define test_width 16
#define test_height 7
static char test_bits[] = {
0x13, 0x00, 0x15, 0x00, 0x93, 0xcd, 0x55, 0xa5, 0x93, 0xc5, 0x00, 0x80,
0x00, 0x60 };

XPM2 version:

XPM3 version:
/* XPM */
static char * blarg_xpm[] = {
&quot;16 7 2 1&quot;,
&quot;* c #000000&quot;,
&quot;. c #ffffff&quot;,
&quot;*.*.*...&quot;,
&quot;*.*.*.*.*.*..*.*&quot;,
&quot;...*&quot;,
};
PBM file:
==Application support==
ACDSee, Amaya, CorelDRAW, GIMP, ImageMagick, IrfanView (formats plugin), PaintShop Pro, PMView, Photoshop (plugins), and XnView among others support XPM. Gravatar also supports XPM.

An X11 libXpm vulnerability was fixed in 2005, and three more in 2023.

FFmpeg version 3.3 or later can decode XPM.

<text>A furanose is a collective term for carbohydrates that have a chemical structure that includes a five-membered ring system consisting of four carbon atoms and one oxygen atom. The name derives from its similarity to the oxygen heterocycle furan, but the furanose ring does not have double bonds.

==Structural properties==
The furanose ring is a cyclic hemiacetal of an aldopentose or a cyclic hemiketal of a ketohexose.

A furanose ring structure consists of four carbon and one oxygen atom with the anomeric carbon to the right of the oxygen. The highest numbered chiral carbon (typically to the left of the oxygen in a Haworth projection) determines whether or not the structure has a -configuration or -configuration. In an -configuration furanose, the substituent on the highest numbered chiral carbon is pointed downwards out of the plane, and in a -configuration furanose, the highest numbered chiral carbon is facing upwards.

The furanose ring will have either alpha or beta configuration, depending on which direction the anomeric hydroxy group is pointing. In a -configuration furanose, alpha configuration has the hydroxy pointing down, and beta has the hydroxy pointing up. It is the opposite in an -configuration furanose. Typically, the anomeric carbon undergoes mutarotation in solution, and the result is an equilibrium mixture of α and β configurations.

<doc id="522442" wikidata="Q898232" url="?curid=522442" title="Mutarotation">
<text>In stereochemistry, mutarotation is the change in optical rotation of a chiral material in a solution due to a change in proportion of the two constituent anomers (i.e. the interconversion of their respective stereocenters) until equilibrium is reached. Cyclic sugars show mutarotation as α and β anomeric forms interconvert.
The optical rotation of the solution depends on the optical rotation of each anomer and their ratio in the solution.

Mutarotation was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1844, when he noticed that the specific rotation of aqueous sugar solution changes with time.

== Measurement ==
The α and β anomers are diastereomers of each other and usually have different specific rotations. A solution or liquid sample of a pure α anomer will rotate plane polarised light by a different amount and/or in the opposite direction than the pure β anomer of that compound. The optical rotation of the solution depends on the optical rotation of each anomer and their ratio in the solution.

For example, if a solution of β--glucopyranose is dissolved in water, its specific optical rotation will be +18.7°. Over time, some of the β--glucopyranose will undergo mutarotation to become α--glucopyranose, which has an optical rotation of +112.2°. The rotation of the solution will increase from +18.7° to an equilibrium value of +52.7° as some of the β form is converted to the α form. The equilibrium mixture is about 64% of β--glucopyranose and about 36% of α--glucopyranose, though there are also traces of the other forms including furanoses and open chained form.

The observed rotation of the sample is the weighted sum of the optical rotation of each anomer weighted by the amount of that anomer present. Therefore, one can use a polarimeter to measure the rotation of a sample and then calculate the ratio of the two anomers present from the enantiomeric excess, as long as one knows the rotation of each pure anomer. One can monitor the mutarotation process over time or determine the equilibrium mixture by observing the optical rotation and how it changes.

<text>In systems engineering and software engineering, requirements analysis focuses on the tasks that determine the needs or conditions to meet the new or altered product or project, taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders, &quot;analyzing&quot;, &quot;documenting&quot;, &quot;validating&quot;, and &quot;managing&quot; software or system requirements.

Requirements analysis is critical to the success or failure of systems or software projects. The requirements should be documented, actionable, measurable, testable, traceable, related to identified business needs or opportunities, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system design.

== Overview ==
Conceptually, requirements analysis includes three types of activities:
*Eliciting requirements: (e.g. the project charter or definition), business process documentation, and stakeholder interviews. This is sometimes also called requirements gathering or requirements discovery.
*Recording requirements: Requirements may be documented in various forms, usually including a summary list, and may include natural-language documents, use cases, user stories, process specifications, and a variety of models including data models.
*Analyzing requirements: determining whether the stated requirements are clear, complete, unduplicated, concise, valid, consistent and unambiguous, and resolving any apparent conflicts. Analyzing can also include sizing requirements.

Requirements analysis can be a long and tiring process during which many delicate psychological skills are involved. New systems change the environment and relationships between people, so it is important to identify all the stakeholders, take into account all their needs, and ensure they understand the implications of the new systems. Analysts can employ several techniques to elicit the requirements from the customer. These may include the development of scenarios (represented as user stories in agile methods), the identification of use cases, the use of workplace observation or ethnography, holding interviews, or focus groups (more aptly named in this context as requirements workshops, or requirements review sessions) and creating requirements lists. Prototyping may be used to develop an example system that can be demonstrated to stakeholders. Where necessary, the analyst will employ a combination of these methods to establish the exact requirements of the stakeholders, so that a system that meets the business needs is produced. Requirements quality can be improved through these and other methods:
* Visualization. Using tools that promote better understanding of the desired end-product such as visualization and simulation.
* Consistent use of templates. Producing a consistent set of models and templates to document the requirements.
* Documenting dependencies. Documenting dependencies and interrelationships among requirements, as well as any assumptions and congregations.

== Requirements analysis topics ==
=== Stakeholder identification ===
See Stakeholder analysis for a discussion of people or organizations (legal entities such as companies, and standards bodies) that have a valid interest in the system. They may be affected by it either directly or indirectly.

A major new emphasis in the 1990s was a focus on the identification of &quot;stakeholders&quot;. It is increasingly recognized that stakeholders are not limited to the organization employing the analyst. Other stakeholders will include:
* anyone who operates the system (normal and maintenance operators)
* anyone who benefits from the system (functional, political, financial, and social beneficiaries)
* anyone involved in purchasing or procuring the system. In a mass-market product organization, product management, marketing, and sometimes sales act as surrogate consumers (mass-market customers) to guide the development of the product.
* organizations that regulate aspects of the system (financial, safety, and other regulators)
* people or organizations opposed to the system (negative stakeholders; see also Misuse case)
* organizations responsible for systems that interface with the system under design.
* those organizations that integrate horizontally with the organization for whom the analyst is designing the system.

=== Joint Requirements Development (JRD) Sessions ===
Requirements often have cross-functional implications that are unknown to individual stakeholders and often missed or incompletely defined during stakeholder interviews. These cross-functional implications can be elicited by conducting JRD sessions in a controlled environment, facilitated by a trained facilitator (Business Analyst), wherein stakeholders participate in discussions to elicit requirements, analyze their details, and uncover cross-functional implications. A dedicated scribe should be present to document the discussion, freeing up the Business Analyst to lead the discussion in a direction that generates appropriate requirements that meet the session objective.

JRD Sessions are analogous to Joint Application Design Sessions. In the former, the sessions elicit requirements that guide design, whereas the latter elicit the specific design features to be implemented in satisfaction of elicited requirements.

=== Contract-style requirement lists ===
One traditional way of documenting requirements has been contract-style requirement lists. In a complex system such requirements lists can run hundreds of pages long.

An appropriate metaphor would be an extremely long shopping list. Such lists are very much out of favor in modern analysis; as they have proved spectacularly unsuccessful at achieving their aims; but they are still seen to this day.

====Strengths====

* Provides a checklist of requirements.
* Provide a contract between the project sponsor(s) and developers.
* For a large system can provide a high level description from which lower-level requirements can be derived.

====Weaknesses====

* Such lists can run to hundreds of pages. They are not intended to serve as a reader-friendly description of the desired application.
* Such requirements lists abstract all the requirements and so there is little context. The Business Analyst may include context for requirements in accompanying design documentation.
** This abstraction is not intended to describe how the requirements fit or work together.
** The list may not reflect relationships and dependencies between requirements. While a list does make it easy to prioritize each item, removing one item out of context can render an entire use case or business requirement useless.
** The list does not supplant the need to review requirements carefully with stakeholders to gain a better-shared understanding of the implications for the design of the desired system/application.
* Simply creating a list does not guarantee its completeness. The Business Analyst must make a good faith effort to discover and collect a substantially comprehensive list and rely on stakeholders to point out missing requirements.
* These lists can create a false sense of mutual understanding between the stakeholders and developers; Business Analysts are critical to the translation process.
* It is almost impossible to uncover all the functional requirements before the process of development and testing begins. If these lists are treated as an immutable contract, then requirements that emerge in the Development process may generate a controversial change request.

====Alternative to requirement lists====

As an alternative to requirement lists, Agile Software Development uses User stories to suggest requirements in everyday language.

=== Measurable goals ===

Best practices take the composed list of requirements merely as clues and repeatedly ask &quot;why?&quot; until the actual business purposes are discovered. Stakeholders and developers can then devise tests to measure what level of each goal has been achieved thus far. Such goals change more slowly than the long list of specific but unmeasured requirements. Once a small set of critical, measured goals has been established, rapid prototyping and short iterative development phases may proceed to deliver actual stakeholder value long before the project is half over.

===Prototypes===

A prototype is a computer program that exhibits a part of the properties of another computer program, allowing users to visualize an application that has not yet been constructed. A popular form of prototype is a mockup, which helps future users and other stakeholders get an idea of what the system will look like. Prototypes make it easier to make design decisions because aspects of the application can be seen and shared before the application is built. Major improvements in communication between users and developers were often seen with the introduction of prototypes. Early views of applications led to fewer changes later and hence reduced overall costs considerably. 

Prototypes can be flat diagrams (often referred to as wireframes) or working applications using synthesized functionality. Wireframes are made in a variety of graphic design documents, and often remove all color from the design (i.e. use a greyscale color palette) in instances where the final software is expected to have a graphic design applied to it. This helps to prevent confusion as to whether the prototype represents the final visual look and feel of the application. 

===Use cases===

A use case is a structure for documenting the functional requirements for a system, usually involving software, whether that is new or being changed. Each use case provides a set of &quot;scenarios&quot; that convey how the system should interact with a human user or another system, to achieve a specific business goal. Use cases typically avoid technical jargon, preferring instead the language of the end-user or &quot;domain expert&quot;. Use cases are often co-authored by requirements engineers and stakeholders.

Use cases are deceptively simple tools for describing the behavior of software or systems. A use case contains a textual description of how users are intended to work with the software or system. Use cases should not describe the internal workings of the system, nor should they explain how that system will be implemented. Instead, they show the steps needed to perform a task without sequential assumptions.

===Requirements specification===
Requirements specification is the synthesis of discovery findings regarding current state business needs and the assessment of these needs to determine, and specify, what is required to meet the needs within the solution scope in focus. Discovery, analysis, and specification move the understanding from a current as-is state to a future to-be state. Requirements specification can cover the full breadth and depth of the future state to be realized, or it could target specific gaps to fill, such as priority software system bugs to fix and enhancements to make. Given that any large business process almost always employs software and data systems and technology, requirements specification is often associated with software system builds, purchases, cloud computing strategies, embedded software in products or devices, or other technologies. The broader definition of requirements specification includes or focuses on any solution strategy or component, such as training, documentation guides, personnel, marketing strategies, equipment, supplies, etc.

== Types of requirements ==

Requirements are categorized in several ways. The following are common categorizations of requirements that relate to technical management:

===Business requirements===

Statements of business level goals, without reference to detailed functionality. These are usually high-level (software and/or hardware) capabilities that are needed to achieve a business outcome.

===Customer requirements===
Statements of fact and assumptions that define the expectations of the system in terms of mission objectives, environment, constraints, and measures of effectiveness and suitability (MOE/MOS). The customers are those that perform the eight primary functions of systems engineering, with special emphasis on the operator as the key customer. Operational requirements will define the basic need and, at a minimum, answer the questions posed in the following listing:
*&quot;Operational distribution or deployment&quot;: Where will the system be used?
*&quot;Mission profile or scenario&quot;: How will the system accomplish its mission objective?
*&quot;Performance and related parameters&quot;: What are the critical system parameters to accomplish the mission?
*&quot;Utilization environments&quot;: How are the various system components to be used?
*&quot;Effectiveness requirements&quot;: How effective or efficient must the system be in performing its mission?
*&quot;Operational life cycle&quot;: How long will the system be in use by the user?
*&quot;Environment&quot;: What environments will the system be expected to operate in an effective manner?

===Architectural requirements===
Architectural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary systems architecture of a system.

===Behavioral requirements===
Behavioral requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary behavior of a system.

===Functional requirements===

Functional requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary task, action or activity that must be accomplished. Functional requirements analysis will be used as the toplevel functions for functional analysis.

===Non-functional requirements===

Non-functional requirements are requirements that specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.

===Performance requirements===
The extent to which a mission or function must be executed; is generally measured in terms of quantity, quality, coverage, timeliness, or readiness. During requirements analysis, performance (how well does it have to be done) requirements will be interactively developed across all identified functions based on system life cycle factors; and characterized in terms of the degree of certainty in their estimate, the degree of criticality to the system success, and their relationship to other requirements.

===Design requirements===
The &quot;build to&quot;, &quot;code to&quot;, and &quot;buy to&quot; requirements for products and &quot;how to execute&quot; requirements for processes are expressed in technical data packages and technical manuals.

===Derived requirements===
Requirements that are implied or transformed from higher-level requirements. For example, a requirement for long-range or high speed may result in a design requirement for low weight.

===Allocated requirements===
A requirement is established by dividing or otherwise allocating a high-level requirement into multiple lower-level requirements. Example: A 100-pound item that consists of two subsystems might result in weight requirements of 70 pounds and 30 pounds for the two lower-level items.

Well-known requirements categorization models include FURPS and FURPS+, developed at Hewlett-Packard.

==Requirements analysis issues==

===Stakeholder issues===
Steve McConnell, in his book &quot;Rapid Development&quot;, details a number of ways users can inhibit requirements gathering:
* Users do not understand what they want or users do not have a clear idea of their requirements
* Users will not commit to a set of written requirements
* Users insist on new requirements after the cost and schedule have been fixed
* Communication with users is slow
* Users often do not participate in reviews or are incapable of doing so
* Users are technically unsophisticated
* Users do not understand the development process
* Users do not know about present technology
This may lead to the situation where user requirements keep changing even when system or product development has been started.

===Engineer/developer issues===
Possible problems caused by engineers and developers during requirements analysis are:
* A natural inclination towards writing code can lead to implementation beginning before the requirements analysis is complete, potentially resulting in code changes to meet actual requirements once they are known.
* Technical personnel and end-users may have different vocabularies. Consequently, they may wrongly believe they are in perfect agreement until the finished product is supplied.
* Engineers and developers may try to make the requirements fit an existing system or model, rather than develop a system specific to the needs of the client.

===Attempted solutions===
One attempted solution to communications problems has been to employ specialists in business or system analysis.

Techniques introduced in the 1990s like prototyping, Unified Modeling Language (UML), use cases, and agile software development are also intended as solutions to problems encountered with previous methods.

Also, a new class of application simulation or application definition tools has entered the market. These tools are designed to bridge the communication gap between business users and the IT organization — and also to allow applications to be &#x27;test marketed&#x27; before any code is produced. The best of these tools offer:
* electronic whiteboards to sketch application flows and test alternatives
* ability to capture business logic and data needs
* ability to generate high-fidelity prototypes that closely imitate the final application
* interactivity
* capability to add contextual requirements and other comments
* ability for remote and distributed users to run and interact with the simulation

<doc id="522450" wikidata="Q1113690" url="?curid=522450" title="USS Lunga Point">
<text>USS &quot;Lunga Point&quot; (CVE-94), originally named &quot;Alazon Bay&quot;, was a of the United States Navy. It was named for Lunga Point on the northern coast of Guadalcanal, the site of a naval battle during World War II. The ship notably participated in support of the landings on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Post war, the ship was decommissioned in 1946, before becoming part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. In 1960, the ship was struck from the Navy list and broken up.

==Design and description==
&quot;Lunga Point&quot; was a Casablanca-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck, a long flight deck. She was powered with two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines, which provided a force of , driving two shafts, enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of , assuming that she traveled at a constant speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow end, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one on the fore, another on the aft.

One /38-caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern, and she was equipped with 16 Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, which were used in an anti-aircraft capability. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry 30 20 mm cannons, as a response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Anti-aircraft guns were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but she sometimes went over or under this number. For example, during the Philippines campaign, she carried 14 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 26 aircraft. However, during the Iwo Jima campaign and the Okinawa campaign, she carried 18 FM-2 fighters, 11 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, and a TBM-3P reconnaissance plane, for a total of 30 aircraft.
==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington, under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name &quot;Alazon Bay&quot; (a misspelling of Alazan Bay, located in Kleberg County, Texas, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds). She was laid down on 19 January 1944 under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1131, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company of Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 11 April 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Mary Elizabeth McKay. She was renamed &quot;Lunga Point&quot;, and was transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 14 May 1944, Captain G. A. T. Washburn in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Following a period of brief training in the months following her commissioning, &quot;Lunga Point&quot; sailed for the Pacific to ferry United States Army bombers to New Guinea and to bring damaged P-47 Thunderbolts back to the United States. Upon return, she became a unit of Carrier Division 29 (CarDiv 29), a component of Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid&#x27;s 7th Fleet, alongside her fellow sister ships , , , and . She departed San Diego, California, on 16 October to participate in the Leyte Gulf operations, touching Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Kossol Roads en route. From 13 to 22 November, she provided air cover for transports and surface units engaged in the campaign. Relieved on the 23rd, she sailed to Manus Island, Admiralty Islands, to prepare for the Luzon campaign.

====Philippine Sea====

&quot;Lunga Point&quot; sailed on 27 December from Manus to supply air support for 6th Army landing operations at Lingayen Gulf. En route, on 4 January 1945, at 17:00, approximately 15 Japanese planes were picked up on radar, west of the task group, and approaching quickly. These planes split into two groups, one group heading towards the rear of the task group, whilst the other continued on its course towards the center. Albeit fighters from the carrier group was scrambled, false radar signals hampered their efforts to intercept, and the only successful interception was when P-47 fighters intercepted two enemy planes, shooting down one. The other plane escaped, and is believed to be the kamikaze which would attack . A lack of radar contacts led the task group to believe that the enemy planes had called off their attack.

At 17:12, a Yokosuka P1Y dove onto &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot;, rupturing the fire mains and sparking a fire which quickly became untenable. She quickly sank, with the loss of 95 crewmen. Minutes after &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; was hit, a second kamikaze dove towards &quot;Lunga Point&quot;. Gunners on the battleship and cruiser , joined with anti-aircraft fire on &quot;Lunga Point&quot;, tore the kamikaze apart. The flaming wreckage passed over her, about a hundred feet above her stern, showering her deck with metal fragments, which slightly wounded two men.

For the next few days, her task group fought their way through 14 enemy attacks, the majority of them kamikazes, most of which were repelled through excellent fighter cover and anti-aircraft fire. During this running engagement, , , and were all damaged by kamikazes. She arrived off Lingayen Gulf on 6 January, commencing 11 days of intensive air support during which time her aircraft flew an average of 41 sorties a day. On 17 January, the support carriers were withdrawn and returned to Ulithi.

====Iwo Jima====
From 23 January 1945 to 10 February, &quot;Lunga Point&quot; prepared for the invasion of Iwo Jima, and stood off the beaches with the amphibious forces, acting as target coordinators and striking enemy positions during the landings on 19 February.

On 16 February 1945, Vice-Admiral Kimpei Teroaka authorized the formation of a kamikaze special attack unit to counter the imminent landings on Iwo Jima. The kamikaze force consisted of twelve fighters, twelve carrier bombers, and eight torpedo bombers, divided into five groups, thirty-two aircraft in total. On the early morning of 21 February, they departed from Katori Naval Air Base, in Asahi, Chiba. They refueled at Hachijō-jima, and then proceeded towards the U.S. naval contingent surrounding Iwo Jima, arriving near sunset.

On the evening of 21 February, &quot;Lunga Point&quot; was performing routine close air support with the rest of Task Group 77.4. At the time, the escort carrier task group consisted of &quot;Lunga Point&quot;, her sister ships &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot;, &quot;Makin Island&quot;, , , and , along with a destroyer contingent. The task group was steaming approximately east of Iwo Jima. At 18:45, the task group spotted the Japanese planes headed for them, when a Mitsubishi G4M made a dive towards &quot;Lunga Point&quot;. Gunners from &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; shot it down. At 18:46, five Nakajima B6Ns dove towards &quot;Lunga Point&quot;. The first plane, approaching from the starboard missed with its torpedo, passing harmlessly in front of &quot;Lunga Point&quot;. It subsequently crashed into the ocean at a high velocity. The second plane also missed with its torpedo, but managed to disengage and fly away. The third plane also missed with its torpedo, which proceeded behind the stern, and, set aflame and damaged heavily, attempted to crash into the carrier, approaching from the starboard side. The kamikaze exploded before it could hit the ship, and the wreckage of the plane skidded across the deck, and off the side of the carrier, sparking a brief gasoline fire. The fourth plane detonated in mid-air, due to a direct hit from a anti-aircraft shell. The fifth plane switched targets to &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot;, sinking it with the loss of 318 lives. Damage to &quot;Lunga Point&quot; was minimal, and eleven of her crew was wounded. There were no fatalities. She was able to continue operating in support of troops on Iwo Jima.

The special attack unit, in addition to sinking &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot;, also heavily damaged , , and slightly damaged &quot;Lunga Point&quot;, , and . &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; was the only ship to sink as a result of the attacks. The kamikaze attacks killed 43 Japanese in total.

She supported operations on Iwo Jima until 8 March, when land-based planes were present in sufficient strength to allow the ship to return to Ulithi to get ready for the Okinawa campaign. When &quot;Lunga Point&quot; returned to Ulithi, she only had six bombs left in her magazine, having dropped 596 in support of operations on Iwo Jima.

====Okinawa====

The ship re-provisioned, and on 21 March sortied from Ulithi with Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague&#x27;s Task Unit. Three days later, on 24 March, she, along with her task group, arrived south of Kerama Retto, providing air cover and bombing targets throughout Okinawa. On 2 April, several kamikazes attempted to strike &quot;Lunga Point&quot;, all of them being shot down before they came close. However, several transports were damaged and the destroyer was heavily damaged in the attack, subsequently being scuttled on 4 April. On 3 April, whilst making a turn, &quot;Lunga Point&quot; rolled 23 degrees, flinging an FM-2 Wildcat and a lookout off the deck. The lookout was quickly recovered. &quot;Lunga Point&quot; remained in support of the operation providing air cover, pounding enemy ground targets in the Ryukyu Islands and fighting off constant kamikaze attacks. She completed this duty without mishap, and returned to Leyte on 27 June.

This was followed by a minesweeping operation west of Okinawa in early July, and on 1 August, she departed on an anti-shipping sweep along the Chinese coast from Shanghai northward. On 5 August, Wildcats from &quot;Lunga Point&quot; downed a Yokosuka P1Y, the last recorded kill by a Wildcat, which had, in the service of escort carriers, shot down a recorded total of 422 Japanese aircraft. On 6 August, an air contingent was sent to attack Japanese installations near Tinghai Harbor, southeast of Shanghai, including an airfield. On 7 August, further strikes were deemed unproductive, and she sailed to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where she received news of the Japanese peace offerings on 15 August.

===Postwar===
In late August the ship, attached to the 5th Fleet, aided in repatriating Allied prisoners of war (POWs) from the ports of Wakayama and Nagasaki. On 15 September, she arrived, steered through Japanese minefields, in the port of Wakayama. On 19 September she transported 760 men of various nationalities to Okinawa. The captain was obliged to assign two men to a bunk to accommodate the ex-POWs. She then unloaded her cargo in Manila harbor. She was ordered to Tokyo Bay in early October, and en route took part in the unsuccessful search for Rear Admiral W. D. Sample missing in a PBM Mariner on a patrol flight. &quot;Lunga Point&quot; stood out of Tokyo Bay 28 October, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 November. She sailed to San Diego arriving on 15 November, and made voyages to the Pacific before returning to the west coast early in 1946.

On 24 October 1946, the ship was decommissioned and became part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Tacoma, Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was reclassified CVU-94 on 12 June 1955 and AKV-32 on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 April 1960, and sold at San Diego to Hyman Michaels Co. on 25 July 1960. Later in the year, she was broken up in Japan.

<doc id="522457" wikidata="Q1135146" url="?curid=522457" title="Eridanos (mythological river)">
<text>The river Eridanos or Eridanus (; ) is, both, the name of a river in Northern Europe mentioned in Greek mythology and historiography, and the name of the god of said-river.

== Mythical stream ==
Hesiod, in the &quot;Theogony,&quot; calls it &quot;deep-eddying Eridanos&quot; in his list of rivers, the offspring of the Titans Tethys and her brother-husband Oceanus. He was called the king of the rivers.

Herodotus suspects the word &quot;Eridanos&quot; to be essentially Greek in character, and notably forged by some unknown poet, and expresses his disbelief in the whole concept—passed on to him by others, themselves not eye-witnesses—of such a river flowing into a northern sea, surrounding Europe, where the mythical Amber and Tin Isles were supposed; he upholds the belief in the abundance of natural goods at the world&#x27;s ends though, to be found in the north of Europe as well as in India (east: big animals, gold, cotton) and Arabia (south: incense, myrrh, etc.). The Eridanos was later associated with the river Po, because the Po was located near the end of the Amber Trail.

According to Apollonius of Rhodes and Ovid, amber originated from the tears of the Heliades, encased in poplars as dryads, shed when their brother, Phaethon, died and fell from the sky, struck by Zeus&#x27; thunderbolt, and tumbled into the Eridanos, where &quot;to this very day the marsh exhales a heavy vapour which rises from his smouldering wound; no bird can stretch out its fragile wings to fly over that water, but in mid-flight it falls dead in the flames&quot;; &quot;along the green banks of the river Eridanos,&quot; Cygnus mourned him—Ovid told—and was transformed into a swan. There in the far west, Heracles asked the river nymphs of Eridanos to help him locate the Garden of the Hesperides. Strabo commented disregardingly on such mythmaking:
[...] one must put aside many of the mythical or false accounts such as those of Phaethon and of the Heliades changed into black poplars near the Eridanos (a river that does not exist anywhere on earth, although it is said to be near the Po), and of the Islands of Amber that lie off the Po, and of the guinea-fowl on them, because none of these exist in this area. 
[...] τὰ δὲ πολλὰ τῶν μυθευομένων ἢ κατεψευσμένων ἄλλως ἐᾶν δεῖ͵ οἷον τὰ περὶ Φαέθοντα καὶ τὰς Ἡλιάδας τὰς ἀπαιγειρουμένας περὶ τὸν Ἠριδανόν͵ τὸν μηδαμοῦ γῆς ὄντα͵ πλησίον δὲ τοῦ Πάδου λεγόμενον͵ καὶ τὰς Ἠλεκτρίδας νήσους τὰς πρὸ τοῦ Πάδου καὶ μελεαγρίδας ἐν αὐταῖς· οὐδὲ γὰρ τούτων οὐδέν ἐστιν ἐν τοῖς τόποις.Virgil introduced it as one of the rivers of Hades in his &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

===&quot;Starry Eridanus&quot;===

When in Nonnus&#x27; fourth- or fifth-century CE &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; the vast monster Typhon boasts that he will bathe in &quot;starry Eridanus&quot;, it is hyperbole, for the constellation Eridanus, represented as a river, was one of the 48 constellations listed by the second-century astronomer Ptolemy; it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

==Real river==
There have been various guesses at which real river was the Eridanos: these include the Po River in north Italy, the Rhone in France and the Rhine. The Eridanos is mentioned in Greek writings as a river in northern Europe rich in amber (Vistula on Amber Road?). A small river near Athens was named Eridanos in ancient times, and has been rediscovered with the excavations for construction of the Athens Metro.There were no serious scientific works that would investigate the connection of Eridanus with the Balkan hydronym for the river Drina, although such studies would be necessary, bearing in mind the proximity of the Lower Danube to ancient trade centers on the Mediterranean, as well as the archaeologically increasingly confirmed importance of this area in ancient and pre-antique history.

<doc id="522460" wikidata="Q744023" url="?curid=522460" title="Mike O'Callaghan">
<text>Donal Neil &quot;Mike&quot; O&#x27;Callaghan (September 10, 1929 March 5, 2004) was an American politician and educator who served as the 23rd Governor of Nevada from 1971 to 1979. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early life==
Born in La Crosse, Wisconsin, O&#x27;Callaghan later moved to Sparta, where his family subsistence farmed. He lied about his age to join the U.S. Marine Corps, at the age of 16 and served from 1946 to 1948.

He attended Boise Junior College and joined the U.S. Air Force in 1950 and served as an intelligence operator in the Aleutian Islands. O&#x27;Callaghan was transferred to the U.S. Army in 1952 to see combat and lost part of his left leg after being hit by a mortar round during a battle in the Korean War. He was awarded the Silver Star and Bronze Star and returned to the United States.

O&#x27;Callaghan resumed his college studies at the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, and completed his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree in education in 1956, then became a high school teacher and boxing coach in Nevada. He was U.S. Senator Harry Reid&#x27;s history teacher at Basic High School in Henderson and later promoted Reid&#x27;s political career. From 1961 to 1963, he was the chief probation officer and director of court services for Clark County.

==Political career==
O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s political career began in 1963, when Governor Grant Sawyer appointed him to head the state&#x27;s new department of health and welfare. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed O&#x27;Callaghan to be the regional director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness.

In 1966, O&#x27;Callaghan ran in the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor, but lost. In 1970, he received the Democratic gubernatorial nomination and won a surprising victory in the general election over his Republican opponent, Edward Fike. He proved to be an extremely popular governor and was re-elected in 1974 by a four-to-one margin, the greatest landslide in a gubernatorial election in state history.

The last Nevada governor before term limits, who was eligible for an elected third term, O&#x27;Callaghan chose not to run again in 1978. After he left office O&#x27;Callaghan became the executive editor of the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot;, a job he held until his death in 2004. He was also the publisher of the &quot;Henderson Home News&quot; and &quot;Boulder City News&quot;. In the 1990s, O&#x27;Callaghan monitored elections in Nicaragua and northern Iraq, and was a strong supporter of the nation of Israel.

==Death==
Mike O&#x27;Callaghan died on March 5, 2004, of a heart attack at the age of 74, after collapsing during the morning mass hours at the Saint Viator Catholic Church in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was pronounced dead at the Desert Springs Hospital in Paradise, Nevada. His widow Carolyn, a native of Twin Falls, Idaho, died seven months later on October 7, 2004, of complications from cardiac surgery, at the age of 68. They were married on October 25, 1954, in Twin Falls, Idaho and had five children; the former governor died one month before their 50th anniversary. Both are interred at the Southern Nevada Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Boulder City, Nevada.

==Legacy==
O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s legacy as Nevada politician and philanthropist survives through three structures that bear his name. Mike O&#x27;Callaghan Middle School opened on the east side of Las Vegas in 1991. The Mike O&#x27;Callaghan Federal Hospital is located on Nellis Air Force Base northeast of Las Vegas. A bridge that is a part of the highway bypass around the Hoover Dam, spanning the Colorado River between Nevada and Arizona, bears O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s name, as well as that of former NFL Arizona Cardinals player and U.S. Army veteran Pat Tillman. Tillman died in a friendly fire incident in Afghanistan. The Mike O&#x27;Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge was completed on October 14, 2010. Also in 2010, The O&#x27;Callaghan Resource Integrated Oncology Network (ORION) Cancer Foundation, a nonprofit charity that assists cancer patients in Nevada was established in honor of Mike and Carolyn O&#x27;Callaghan, both cancer survivors.

<text>Gara (Basque: We Are) is a bilingual (Basque/Spanish) leftwing Basque Nationalist newspaper published in the city of Donostia-San Sebastián in the Basque Autonomous Community. The newspaper&#x27;s target market comprises the area of the Basque Country, but its circulation is largely constrained to the Southern Basque territory (Spain), since Spanish is mainly used rather than French.

Gara, the third most-read newspaper in the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre, was first published on 30 January 1999 as successor to the leftist and Basque nationalist newspaper &quot;Egin&quot;, which had been shut down by the noted prosecuting judge Baltasar Garzón in a highly controversial move on 15 July 1998. The case was dismissed and defendants acquitted, with the final verdict stating that no illicit activity was engaged by Egin (2009).

On 12 March 2004, ETA denied in a communique to Gara and the Basque public broadcaster EITB its involvement in the March 11, 2004 Madrid attacks. In July 2008, the newspaper denounced that its communications were being tapped by the police, and diverted to the Spanish National Police headquarters in Pamplona.

Despite the illegal closure of the newspapers &quot;Egin&quot; and &quot;Egunkaria&quot; by the Spanish justice courts, the €4.7 million debt incurred by &quot;Egin&quot; with the Social Security was after its shutdown shouldered over to the new daily Gara, as an &quot;ideological successor&quot; to &quot;Egin&quot;. By May 2019, the media outlet looks to counter the Spanish government&#x27;s and justice system&#x27;s attempts to subdue it by searching new subscribers and organizing special events to garner support and financial viability.

<doc id="522467" wikidata="Q4966633" url="?curid=522467" title="Bridger Mountains (Wyoming)">
<text>The Bridger Mountains are a short subrange of the Rocky Mountains, approximately long, in central Wyoming in the United States. The range forms a bridge between the Owl Creek Mountains to the west and the southern end of the Bighorn Mountains to the east. The Wind River passes through the gap between the range and the Owl Creek Mountains. Bridger Creek passes through the gap between the range and the Bighorns. The highest point in the range is Copper Mountain at .

The range is named after Jim Bridger, who pioneered the Bridger Trail through the mountains from southern Wyoming into the Bighorn Basin in 1864.
Bates Creek in the eastern part of the range is the location of Bates Battlefield, a significant battle on July 4, 1874, in which the U.S. Army soldiers from Camp Brown (Today&#x27;s Fort Washakie) with 167 Shoshone scouts attacked the village of Chief Black Coal (Northern Arapaho), killing at least 34 Northern Arapahos.

A trail running through the mountains starts southeast of Shoshoni, Wyoming ending north of Thermopolis, Wyoming.

<doc id="522468" wikidata="Q902134" url="?curid=522468" title="Synthetic oil">
<text>Synthetic oil is a lubricant consisting of chemical compounds that are artificially modified or synthesised. Synthetic oil is used as a substitute for petroleum-refined oils when operating in extreme temperature, in metal stamping to provide environmental and other benefits, and to lubricate pendulum clocks. There are various types of synthetic oils. Advantages of using synthetic motor oils include better low-and high-temperature viscosity performance, better (higher) viscosity index (VI), and chemical and shear stability, while disadvantages are that synthetics are substantially more expensive (per volume) than mineral oils and have potential decomposition problems.

== Description ==
Synthetic oil lubricant comprises chemical compounds that are artificially modified or synthesised. Synthetic lubricants can be manufactured using chemically modified petroleum components rather than whole crude oil, but can also be synthesized from other raw materials. The base material, however, is still overwhelmingly crude oil that is distilled and then modified physically and chemically. The actual synthesis process and composition of additives is generally a commercial trade secret and will vary among producers.

== Use ==
* Synthetic oil is used as a substitute for petroleum-refined oils when operating in extreme temperature. Aircraft jet engines, for example, require the use of synthetic oils, whereas aircraft piston engines do not.
* Synthetic oils are also used in metal stamping to provide environmental and other benefits when compared to conventional petroleum and animal-fat based products. These products are also referred to as &quot;non-oil&quot; or &quot;oil free&quot;.
* A polyalcanoate synthetic oil is widely used to lubricate pendulum clocks.

==Types==

===Full===
Some synthetic oils are made from Group III base stock, some from Group IV while other synthetic oils may be a blend of the two. Mobil sued Castrol and Castrol prevailed in showing that their Group III base stock oil was changed enough that it qualified as full synthetic. Since then American Petroleum Institute (API) has removed all references to synthetic in their documentation regarding standards. &quot;Full synthetic&quot; is a marketing term and is not a measurable quality.

====Group IV: PAO====
Poly-alpha-olefin (poly-α-olefin, PAO) is a non-polar polymer made by polymerizing an alpha-olefin. They are designated at API Group IV and are a 100% synthetic chemical compound. It is a specific type of olefin (organic) that is used as a base stock in the production of most synthetic lubricants. An alpha-olefin (or α-olefin) is an alkene where the carbon-carbon double bond starts at the α-carbon atom, i.e. the double bond is between the #1 and #2 carbons in the molecule.

====Group V: Other synthetics====
Group V base oils are defined by API as any other type of oil other than mineral oils or PAO lubricants.

Esters are the most famous synthetics in Group V, which are 100% synthetic chemical compounds consisting of a carbonyl adjacent to an ether linkage. They are derived by reacting an oxoacid with a hydroxyl compound such as an alcohol or phenol. Esters are usually derived from an inorganic acid or organic acid in which at least one -OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an -O-alkyl (alkoxy) group, most commonly from carboxylic acids and alcohols. That is to say, esters are formed by condensing an acid with an alcohol.

Many chemically different &quot;esters&quot;—due to their polarity and usually excellent lubricity—are used for various reasons as either &quot;additives&quot; or &quot;base stocks&quot; for lubricants.

=====Polyalkylene glycol (PAG) synthetic oil=====

======Industrial PAG======
* The terms polyalkylene glycol and polyglycol are used interchangeably.
* Synthetic lubricants are about 4% of the lubricants market. PAGs are about 24% of the synthetic lubricants market.
* Ethylene is the basic raw material used to make the synthetic lubricant polyglycols oils. When ethylene and propylene react with oxygen we obtain ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO), from which the polyalkylene glycols are produced by means of polymerization. Polyalkylene glycols are usually made by combining ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide with an alcohol or water.
* The mixing ratio between EO and PO, plus the oxygen bonded in the chemical structure, crucially affect the behavior of polyglycols. The gear industry predominantly uses polyglycols with an EO/PO ratio of 50:50 to 60:40, which exhibit very similar behavior. The polyglycols featuring this composition are also generally referred to as water soluble polyglycols.
* Polyalkylene glycol base oils are formed by reacting an alcohol with one or more alkylene oxides: Propylene oxide provides water insolubility, Ethylene oxide provides water solubility.

======PAG properties======
PAGs offer properties that include: high lubricity, polarity, low traction properties, high viscosity index, controlled quenching speeds, good temperature stability and low wear. They are available in both water soluble and insoluble forms.

======PAG uses======

PAGs are commonly used in quenching fluids, metalworking fluids, gear oils, chain oils, food-grade lubricants and as lubricants in HFC type hydraulics and gas compressor equipment. PAG lubricants are used by the two largest U.S. air compressor OEMs in rotary screw air compressors. PAG oils of different viscosity grades (usually either ISO VG 46 or ISO VG 100) are often used as compressor lubricants for automotive air conditioning systems employing low global warming potential refrigerants.

======PAG advantages======
* PAGs are available in a wide range of viscosity grades and additive packages for a variety of uses. Some PAGs properties such as water solubility are not commonly provided by other synthetic lubricants, such as polyalphaolefins (PAO).
* PAGs prevent sludge and varnish from developing at high temperatures. PAGs have viscosity indexes that are higher than PAOs.
* In large gears, PAG lubricant yielded lower friction than PAO lubricant.
* PAG oils are polar, which means that an oil film easily develops upon all moving metal parts, reducing startup wear.
* PAGs can be highly biodegradable, particularly the water-soluble PAGs.
* PAGs perform better than in extreme weather condition.

======PAG disadvantages======
* PAGs are not compatible with mineral oils, most seals, paints, varnishes.
* Synthetic oil is more expensive than mineral oils.

======PAG seal compatibility======
* PAG is usually compatible with fluorocarbon-based fluoroelastomer materials and vinyl methyl silicone (VMQ) silicone rubber.
* PAG acts as a solvent and dissolves and removes the mineral grease which causes slower motions, air leaks, and can stop 4-way valves from operating.
* Natural rubber, Buna-N, and most regular seals are incompatible with PAG oils, especially seals coated in mineral grease. PAG oils can cause seals to shrink or swell, thus causing severe leakage or seizure of the seal. Pneumatic air cylinders and 4-ways valves commonly use Buna-N rubber seals that are coated in mineral grease.

===Semi-synthetic oil===
Semi-synthetic oils (also called &quot;synthetic blends&quot;) are a mixture of mineral oil and synthetic oil, which are engineered to have many of the benefits of full synthetic oil without the cost. Motul introduced the first semi-synthetic motor oil in 1966.

Lubricants that have synthetic base stocks even lower than 30% but with high-performance additives consisting of esters can also be considered synthetic lubricants. In general, the ratio of the synthetic base stock is used to define commodity codes among the customs declarations for tax purposes.

===Other base stocks help semi-synthetic lubricants===
API Group II- and API Group III-type base stocks help to formulate more economic-type semi-synthetic lubricants. API Group I-, II-, II+-, and III-type mineral-base oil stocks are widely used in combination with additive packages, performance packages, and ester and/or API Group IV poly-alpha-olefins in order to formulate semi-synthetic-based lubricants. API Group III base oils are sometimes considered fully synthetic, but they are still classified as highest-top-level mineral-base stocks. A synthetic or synthesized material is one that is produced by combining or building individual units into a unified entity. Synthetic base stocks as described above are man-made and tailored to have a controlled molecular structure with predictable properties, unlike mineral base oils, which are complex mixtures of naturally occurring hydrocarbons and paraffins.

==Performance of synthetic oil==
The advantages of using synthetic motor oils include better low-and high-temperature viscosity performance at service temperature extremes, better (higher) Viscosity Index (VI), and chemical and shear stability. This also helps in decreasing the loss due to evaporation. It is resistant to oxidation, thermal breakdown, oil sludge problems and provides extended drain intervals, with the environmental benefit of less used oil waste generated. It provides better lubrication in extreme cold conditions. The use of synthetic oils promises a longer engine life with superior protection against &quot;ash&quot; and other deposit formation in engine hot spots (in particular in turbochargers and superchargers) for less oil burn-off and reduced chances of damaging oil passageway clogging. The performance of automobiles is improved as net increase in horsepower and torque due to less internal drag on engine. Moreover, it can improve fuel efficiency - 1.8% to 5% as has been documented in fleet tests.

However, synthetic motor oils are substantially more expensive (per volume) than mineral oils and have potential decomposition problems in certain chemical environments (predominantly in industrial use).

<text>Sergio Ortega Alvarado (February 2, 1938 – September 16, 2003) was a Chilean composer, pianist, poet, teacher and politician. He is recognized for having composed important Chilean left-wing politics anthems, among them are &quot;Venceremos&quot; and &quot;El pueblo unido jamás será vencido&quot;, as well as the anthem of the Radical Party, Communist Youth and Workers&#x27; United Center of Chile.

== Biography ==
Sergio Ortega Alvarado was born in Antofagasta, Chile on February 2, 1938. He had brief studies of Architecture and Literature, until he entered the National Conservatory of the University of Chile and began to study composition with Roberto Falabella and Gustavo Becerra-Schmidt. After graduating, he worked at the Institute of Musical Extension and six years as a sound engineer at the Experimental Theater of the University, at the Antonio Varas Theater.

During this period he composed music for theater and cinema. he composed music for works by Alejandro Sieveking and Isidora Aguirre, including &quot;Asunto sofisticado&quot; and &quot;La dama del canasto&quot;, respectively. In 1964, the filmmaker Pedro Chaskel heads the music project for the 1925 silent film, El Húsar de la muerte by Pedro Sienna, commissioned by Ortega himself, who made a special composition that was registered in the Hall of Honor of the University of Chile. Later he composed the soundtrack of El Chacal de Nahueltoro in 1969 by filmmaker Miguel Littin. In 2001, he also composed a song for the film &quot;Taxi para tres&quot;. Ortega&#x27;s music was based mainly on a typical classical music sound, full of polyphonies and dissonances. His colleague, Luis Advis, also presented these characteristics within his music.

Pablo Neruda entrusted him with musicalizing the assembly of his translation of Romeo and Juliet. Later, he would ask her to compose the soundtrack for his only play, &quot;Fulgor y muerte de Joaquín Murieta&quot;, premiered in 1967 at the Antonio Varas Theater, under the direction of Pedro Orthous. The work, which made a successful tour of Europe, tells the story of Joaquín Murieta, a Chilean gold prospector who comes to California in search of fortune. The story had already appeared in Neruda&#x27;s books as the fourth episode of &quot;La barcarola&quot;. However, Neruda writes the play, with characters, dialogues, script, etc. On December 14, 1998, the two-act opera &quot;Fulgor y muerte de Joaquín Murieta&quot;, composed by him and with a libretto based on the homonymous work by Neruda, premiered at the Municipal Theatre of Santiago.

In 1967, he worked with the singer-songwriter Víctor Jara in the musical arrangements of some of the songs on his self-titled album, at the same time he directed his orchestra that he accompanied on the tracks &quot;El aparecido&quot;, &quot;Solo&quot; and &quot;Así como hoy matan negros&quot;. Ortega was a member of the Communist Party of Chile. He together with the singer-songwriter Victor Jara and the lyricist Claudio Iturra, he composed &quot;Venceremos&quot; the electoral theme of the socialist president Salvador Allende and a world anthem of leftist movements. He composed the 1970 album by Inti-Illimani, &quot;Canto al programa&quot;, with contributions from Luis Advis and lyrics by Julio Rojas. He also worked on a musical version of Neruda&#x27;s &quot;Canto General&quot; with Gustavo Becerra and the group Aparcoa, which was staged in 1970. About three months before the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état against La Moneda, he recorded &quot;El pueblo unido jamás será vencido&quot; together with the group Quilapayún, a recognized worldwide protest anthem. After the coup, he took refuge in the embassy of Panama. He then moved to France, where he would continue his musical career. 

In 1978, he composed and premiered at an Austrian festival, &quot;Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Riquelme, 1810. Poema sonoro para el padre de mi patria&quot;. For the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution, Ortegra worked on a praised operatic trilogy. Ortega worked with his eldest son, Chañaral Ortega-Miranda (later member of the French faction of Quilapayún), on an operatic version of &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot;, the novel by Mexican writer Juan Rulfo.

In 1970, he began to direct the university&#x27;s TV station, Channel 9, which he continued until 1973. In 1977 Ortega visited the USSR, participated in the festival &quot;Red Carnation&quot;. He was given permission to return to Chile in 1983, and did so several times. During his exile, Ortega directed L&#x27;Ecole Nationale de Musique, in Pantin, France. 

During the 30th anniversary of the Military Coup, he was diagnosed with advanced Pancreatic cancer. In September 2003, Sergio Ortega was already in a coma at the Saint Louis hospital in Paris. He died on September 15, at the age of 65, surrounded by his wife and their three sons. On the 27th of the same month, his remains would be buried in the General Cemetery. The Workers&#x27; United Center, the Antonio Varas Theater and the Faculty of Arts of the University of Chile made official tributes. In the Municipal Theatre, the choir led by Max Valdés, interpreted the final parts of &quot;Fulgor y muerte de Joaquín Murieta&quot;.

<text>The middlegame is the portion of a chess game between the opening and the endgame. It is generally considered to begin when each player has completed the development of all or most of their pieces and brought their king to relative safety, and it is generally considered to end when only a few pieces remain on the board. However, there is no clear line between the opening and middlegame or between the middlegame and endgame. At master level, the opening analysis may go well into the middlegame; likewise, the middlegame blends into the endgame.

Theory on the middlegame is less developed than the opening or endgames. Since middlegame positions are unique from game to game, memorization of theoretical variations is not possible as it is in the opening. Likewise, there are usually too many pieces on the board for theoretical positions to be completely analyzed as can be done in the simpler endgames.

==Defining the middlegame==
Views vary on when the opening ends and the middlegame begins. In general, the opening is defined as ending when the development of pieces is mostly complete.

Similarly, there are differing opinions and criteria for when the middlegame ends and the endgame begins (see the start of the endgame). Factors such as control of the center are less important in the endgame than the middlegame. In endgames the number of pieces and pawns is much reduced, though even after queens are traded, it is possible to have a middlegame without queens. The endgame is often said to begin when the kings can safely play an active role.

==Aims of the middlegame==
&quot;The Middle Game in Chess&quot; by Reuben Fine lists three major factors in the middlegame: king safety, force (material), and mobility, although not all of these factors are of equal importance. If king safety is a serious issue, a well-executed attack on the king can render other considerations, including material advantages, irrelevant. Material is another important consideration: Fine notes that—if all other things are equal—any material advantage will usually be decisive. According to Fine, a material advantage will usually not give a direct mating attack unless the advantage is very large (a rook or more); rather, it can be used as a means of gaining more material and a decisive endgame advantage. To gain mobility is to ensure that the pieces have a wide scope of action and targets to focus on. The concept is largely strategic in nature, and involves such concepts as space, pawn weaknesses (since weak pawns can compel pieces to defensive duties, reducing their mobility), and securing outposts for the pieces.

The strategy required for middlegame play varies considerably. Some middlegame positions feature featuring maneuvering behind the lines, while other middlegames are wide open, where both players attempt to gain the initiative. Dan Heisman noted three features which can seriously alter the way the middlegame is played.

First, if the kings are castled on opposite wings, and queens remain on the board, the position can be very violent, with both players aiming to assault the enemy king. Material considerations are often secondary to pursuing the attack, and it can even be advantageous to lose pawns in front of the enemy king in order to open up lines for the rooks and queen.

Second, positions where the pawn structure is static and locked can also feature mutual attacks, since players often elect to play on the side where they have more space (playing on the side of the board in which their pawns are pointing). Time is often less of a concern in such middlegames, allowing lengthy maneuvers. Players attempt to strengthen their positions and weaken their opponent&#x27;s. Both players need to be on the lookout for pawn breaks, and the possibility of taking advantage of the open files which may arise from them.

Third, if one player has an overwhelming material advantage and is clearly winning, the stronger player can usually afford to violate several of the normal middlegame principles in order to trade down to an endgame. For example, trading queens even at the cost of a ruined pawn structure may be a viable option.

==Transition to the endgame==
Not all games reach the endgame, since an attack on the king, or a combination leading to large material gains can end the game while it is still in the middlegame. At other times, an advantage needs to be pursued in the endgame, and learning how to make favorable exchanges leading to a favorable endgame is an important skill.

The last thing that happens in the middlegame is the setup for endgame. Since many endgames involve the promotion of a pawn, it is usually good to keep that in mind when making trades during the middlegame. For example, World Champion Max Euwe considered a preponderance of pawns on the (queenside majority) an advantage because this might be used to create a passed pawn.

<doc id="522474" wikidata="Q1700405" url="?curid=522474" title="John Haynes (governor)">
<text>John Haynes (May 1, 1594 – c. January 9, 1653/4), also sometimes spelled Haines, was a colonial magistrate and one of the founders of the Connecticut Colony. He served one term as governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and was the first governor of Connecticut, ultimately serving eight separate terms. Although Colonial Connecticut prohibited Governors from serving consecutive terms at the time, &quot;John Haynes was so popular with the colonists that he served alternately as governor and often as deputy governor from 1639 to his death in 1653.&quot;

Haynes was influential in the drafting of laws and legal frameworks in both Massachusetts and Connecticut. He was on the committee that drafted the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, which has been called one of the first written constitutions. He also invested most of his fortune in Connecticut, &quot;to the ruine of his famylye in Englande&quot;.

==Early life==

Haynes was likely born at Messing, Essex, England, the eldest son of John Haynes and Mary Michel Haynes. The family was an armigerous gentry or &#x27;visitation family&#x27; who had lived at Codicote, Herefordshire, and at Great Haddam. In 1605, when he was eleven, his father died, and he eventually inherited the family&#x27;s many properties. It is possible that Haynes attended Cambridge; during the relevant time period, two John Hayneses are listed as attending. By about 1616, Haynes was living at Gurney&#x27;s Manor, Hingham, Norfolk, a hotbed of Puritan sentiment, where Haynes was Lord of the Manor. There he married Mary Thorneton, the daughter of Norfolk nobility, with whom he had six children. In 1627, his wife Mary died and was buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Hingham. In the early 1620s, he purchased Copford Hall, near Colchester in Essex; this estate alone was reported to produce £1,100 per year.

Essex was also a Puritan center, and Haynes was greatly influenced by the pastor Thomas Hooker, who was a close friend. In about 1630, John Winthrop and John Humphreys, two of the founders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, extended invitations to Hooker and Haynes to join them in the New World. Apparently leaving his minor children behind, Haynes emigrated in 1633, sailing aboard the &quot;Griffin&quot; with Hooker. They settled first at Newtowne (later renamed Cambridge), where Haynes was the guest of Thomas Dudley until his own house was ready.

==Massachusetts Bay Colony==
As a man of some means, (Winthrop referred to him as a &quot;man of great estate&quot;) in 1634, Haynes was admitted as a freeman and elected to the colony&#x27;s council of assistants. He was also named to a committee overseeing military matters, a position that assumed some importance when war broke out with the Pequot tribe that year. The assistants were called on to consider the controversial defacement of the English flag by John Endecott in 1634. Claiming that St George&#x27;s Cross was a symbol of popery, he had cut it from the Salem militia company&#x27;s banner. Haynes was part of a moderate faction that disagreed with Endecott&#x27;s action, claiming that the cross had been reduced to a symbol of nationalism. For his action, Endecott was censured and deprived of serving in any offices for one year.

In 1634, Haynes served in a variety of municipal capacities. He was a Cambridge selectman and served on a commission that decided the boundary between Boston and Charlestown. He was elected governor in 1635, winning an election that Roger Ludlow had been expected to win. Haynes had argued for the lowering of taxes; Ludlow also alleged that the deputies of some towns had made private agreements that concerned the vote before it occurred. Ludlow, who was not even elected as an assistant, was apparently motivated by his loss to leave the colony for a settlement on the Connecticut River.

Haynes&#x27; one-year term as governor was marked by political conflict between a faction led by Haynes, Hooker, and Dudley, and another led by Winthrop. The major disagreement between them concerned the strictness of judicial procedures and the process of rendering judgments; the Haynes faction believed that Winthrop had been lax in some of his decisions. The conservative faction was successful in enacting regulations for stricter judicial procedures; it also passed legislation banning the smoking of tobacco and restricting overly ostentatious or fashionable clothing. Haynes also presided over the trial and banishment of Roger Williams, an act that Williams reports Haynes later expressed some regret over.

==Connecticut Colony==
In 1635, a significant religious division began to grow in the Massachusetts colony. Anne Hutchinson and others espoused the Antinomianist view that the laws of the Church of England did not apply to them, while others argued the opposing Legalist position. Harsh reactions to the controversy may have played a role in the decision by Hooker, and consequently Haynes, to leave the colony for new settlements on the Connecticut River. Historians have also cited shortages of land and food as a reason for this migration, and political competition between Haynes and Winthrop. Winthrop recorded that Hooker&#x27;s company was motivated by &quot;the strong bent of their spirits to remove&quot;.
Haynes, while making arrangements to follow Hooker, continued to be involved in Massachusetts through 1636, serving as an assistant and as colonel of one of the colony&#x27;s militia regiments. His lieutenant colonel was Roger Harlakenden, who in 1635 came over from England with his sister Mabel. John and Mabel were married in 1636; they had five children.

Haynes joined Hooker at the settlement they called Hartford in 1637. The colonial settlements on the river were established without any sort of royal charter and were not within the bounds of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. For the first two years, the few small settlements were governed by a general court of magistrates, headed by Haynes, and were likely preoccupied with the ongoing conflict with the Pequots. After the war ended in late 1638, the magistrates began drafting a body of principles and laws; these were ratified in January 1638/9. Now known as the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, this document has been called the &quot;first written constitution&quot;. The chief architects of the Fundamental Orders were Ludlow, the colony&#x27;s principal legal mind, Haynes, and Thomas Hooker, who was known to advocate for the liberties the document enshrines.

Pursuant to the terms of this constitution, elections were held on April 11, 1639, and Haynes was elected as the colony&#x27;s first governor. Because of restrictions in the constitution that disallowed consecutive terms, he was in and out of the office of governor a total of eight times between 1639 and his death in 1653/4. During most of the years he was not governor, he was instead the deputy governor.

Due to a lack of detailed documentation, the exact role Haynes played in the colony&#x27;s political activities is unclear. One of his more notable achievements was the negotiations with some of the neighboring colonies that led to the creation of the New England Confederation in 1643. This organization was a loose confederation of the Connecticut, Massachusetts Bay, New Haven, and Plymouth Colonies, principally established to coordinate defense against common threats. For Connecticut, the major threats came from Indians and from the Dutch of the New Netherlands to the west. In particular, the smaller colonies benefited from this confederation at the expense of the significantly more populous Massachusetts colony. During his terms in office, he was called upon to mediate disputes between local Indians and to negotiate with Dutch representatives of the New Netherlands, who claimed land south of Hartford on the Connecticut River. When one Dutch trader complained about the seizure by some Englishmen of land he claimed, Haynes responded that because the Dutchman had done nothing to develop the land, and that because &quot;it was a sin to let such rich land ... lie uncultivated&quot;, he had effectively forfeited his claim. This dispute resulted in minor military confrontations between the English and Dutch in the 1640s and was resolved temporarily in the 1650 Treaty of Hartford, in which the Dutch ceded their claims on the river. Some territorial disputes continued even after the English took New Netherlands from the Dutch in 1664, and the territory described in the Duke of York&#x27;s charter overlapped that of Connecticut.

==Death and legacy==
Contrary to the engraved date on his tombstone in Hartford&#x27;s Ancient Burying Ground, Haynes did not die on March 1, 1653/4. A letter, written by John Winthrop the Younger on January 9, 1653/4, mentions his recent death. The Connecticut General Court issued a statement on March 6, calling for a &quot;day of humiliation&quot; following the &quot;sudden death of our late Governor&quot;. Haynes&#x27; son, Hezekiah, a military officer who served in the English Civil War, noted that his father had invested between £7,000 and £8,000 in the colony &quot;to the ruine of his famylye in Englande&quot;; his estate was valued at about £1,500. Haynes was a significant landowner in the Hartford area, and he and Edward Hopkins operated a mill in the town. Haynes&#x27; daughter Ruth married Samuel Wyllys, the son of another Connecticut founder, George Wyllys. Their descendants have continued the legacy of political involvement in Connecticut and elsewhere.

<text>In stereochemistry, a stereocenter of a molecule is an atom (center), axis or plane that is the focus of stereoisomerism; that is, when having at least three different groups bound to the stereocenter, interchanging any two different groups creates a new stereoisomer. Stereocenters are also referred to as stereogenic centers. 

A stereocenter is geometrically defined as a point (location) in a molecule; a stereocenter is usually but not always a specific atom, often carbon. Stereocenters can exist on chiral or achiral molecules; stereocenters can contain single bonds or double bonds. The number of hypothetical stereoisomers can be predicted by using 2&quot;n&quot;, with &quot;n&quot; being the number of tetrahedral stereocenters; however, exceptions such as meso compounds can reduce the prediction to below the expected 2&quot;n&quot;. 

[[Stereocenter|Chirality centers]] are a type of stereocenter with four different substituent groups; chirality centers are a specific subset of stereocenters because they can only have sp3 hybridization, meaning that they can only have single bonds.

== Location ==
Stereocenters can exist on chiral or achiral molecules. They are defined as a location (point) within a molecule, rather than a particular atom, in which the interchanging of two groups creates a stereoisomer. A stereocenter can have either four different attachment groups, or three different attachment groups where one group is connected by a double bond. Since stereocenters can exist on achiral molecules, stereocenters can have either sp3 or sp2 hybridization. 

==Possible number of stereoisomers==
Stereoisomers are compounds that are identical in composition and connectivity but have a different spatial arrangement of atoms around the central atom. A molecule having multiple stereocenters will produce many possible stereoisomers. In compounds whose stereoisomerism is due to tetrahedral (sp3) stereogenic centers, the total number of hypothetically possible stereoisomers will not exceed 2&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of tetrahedral stereocenters. However, this is an upper bound because molecules with symmetry frequently have fewer stereoisomers. 

The stereoisomers produced by the presence of multiple stereocenters can be defined as enantiomers (non-superposable mirror images) and diastereomers (non-superposable, non-identical, non-mirror image molecules). Enantiomers and diastereomers are produced due to differing stereochemical configurations of molecules containing the same composition and connectivity (bonding); the molecules must have multiple (two or more) stereocenters to be classified as enantiomers or diastereomers. Enantiomers and diastereomers will produce individual stereoisomers that contribute to the total number of possible stereoisomers. 

However, the stereoisomers produced may also give a meso compound, which is an achiral compound that is superposable on its mirror image; the presence of a meso compound will reduce the number of possible stereoisomers. Since a meso compound is superposable on its mirror image, the two &quot;stereoisomers&quot; are actually identical. Resultantly, a meso compound will reduce the number of stereoisomers to below the hypothetical 2&quot;n&quot; amount due to symmetry.

Additionally, certain configurations may not exist due to steric reasons. Cyclic compounds with chiral centers may not exhibit chirality due to the presence of a two-fold rotation axis. Planar chirality may also provide for chirality without having an actual chiral center present.

== Configuration ==
Configuration is defined as the arrangement of atoms around a stereocenter. The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) system uses R and S designations to define the configuration of atoms about any stereocenter. A designation of R denotes a clockwise direction of substituent priority around the stereocenter, while a designation of S denotes a counter-clockwise direction of substituent priority.

==Chirality centers==
A chirality center (chiral center) is a type of stereocenter. A chirality center is defined as an atom holding a set of four different ligands (atoms or groups of atoms) in a spatial arrangement which is non-superposable on its mirror image. Chirality centers must be sp3 hybridized, meaning that a chirality center can only have single bonds. In organic chemistry, a chirality center usually refers to a carbon, phosphorus, or sulfur atom, though it is also possible for other atoms to be chirality centers, especially in areas of organometallic and inorganic chemistry.

The concept of a chirality center generalizes the concept of an asymmetric carbon atom (a carbon atom bonded to four different entities) to a broader definition of any atom with four different attachment groups in which an interchanging of any two attachment groups gives rise to an enantiomer.
==Stereogenic on carbon==
A carbon atom that is attached to four different substituent groups is called an &quot;asymmetric carbon atom&quot; or &quot;chiral carbon&quot;. Chiral carbons are the most common type of chirality center.

==Stereogenic on other atoms==
Chirality is not limited to carbon atoms, though carbon atoms are often centers of chirality due to their ubiquity in organic chemistry. Nitrogen and phosphorus atoms can also form bonds in a tetrahedral configuration. A nitrogen in an amine may be a stereocenter if all three groups attached are different because the electron pair of the amine functions as a fourth group. However, nitrogen inversion, a form of pyramidal inversion, causes racemization which means that both epimers at that nitrogen are present under normal circumstances. Racemization by nitrogen inversion may be restricted (such as quaternary ammonium or phosphonium cations), or slow, which allows the existence of chirality.

Metal atoms with tetrahedral or octahedral geometries may also be chiral due to having different ligands. For the octahedral case, several chiralities are possible. Having three ligands of two types, the ligands may be lined up along the meridian, giving the &quot;mer&quot;-isomer, or forming a face—the &quot;fac&quot; isomer. Having three bidentate ligands of only one type gives a propeller-type structure, with two different enantiomers denoted Λ and Δ.

== Chirality and stereocenters ==
As mentioned earlier, the requirement for an atom to be a chirality center is that the atom must be sp3 hybridized with four different attachments. Because of this, all chirality centers are stereocenters. However, only under some conditions is the reverse true. Recall that a point can be considered a sterocenter with a minimum of three attachment points; stereocenters can be either sp3 or sp2 hybridized, as long as the interchanging any two different groups creates a new stereoisomer. This means that although all chirality centers are stereocenters, not every stereocenter is a chirality center. 

Stereocenters are important identifiers for chiral or achiral molecules. As a general rule, if a molecule has no stereocenters, it is considered achiral. If it has at least one stereocenter, the molecule has the potential for chirality. However, there are some exceptions like meso compounds that make molecules with multiple stereocenters considered achiral.

<doc id="522477" wikidata="Q1683532" url="?curid=522477" title="Jarlshof">
<text>Jarlshof ( ) is the best-known prehistoric archaeological site in Shetland, Scotland. It lies in Sumburgh, Mainland, Shetland and has been described as &quot;one of the most remarkable archaeological sites ever excavated in the British Isles&quot;. It contains remains dating from 2500 BC up to the 17th century AD.

The Bronze Age settlers left evidence of several small oval houses with thick stone walls and various artefacts including a decorated bone object. The Iron Age ruins include several different types of structures, including a broch and a defensive wall around the site. The Pictish period provides various works of art including a painted pebble and a symbol stone. The Viking Age ruins make up the largest such site visible anywhere in Britain and include a longhouse; excavations provided numerous tools and a detailed insight into life in Shetland at this time. The most visible structures on the site are the walls of the Scottish period fortified manor house, which inspired the name &quot;Jarlshof&quot; that first appears in an 1821 novel by Walter Scott.

The site is in the care of Historic Scotland and is open year-round, with longer opening hours during April to September. In 2012 &quot;Zenith of Iron Age Shetland&quot; including Mousa, Old Scatness and Jarlshof was added to the UK&#x27;s tentative list of proposed World Heritage Sites.

==Location and etymology==
Jarlshof lies near the southern tip of the Shetland Mainland, close to the settlements of Sumburgh and Grutness and to the south end of Sumburgh Airport. The site overlooks an arm of the sea called the West Voe of Sumburgh and the nearby freshwater springs and building materials available on the beach will have added to the location&#x27;s attraction as a settlement. The south Mainland also provides a favourable location for arable cultivation in a Shetland context and there is a high density of prehistoric settlement in the surrounding area. Jarlshof is only one mile from Scatness where the remains of another broch and other ruins of a similar longevity were discovered in 1975. There is a small visitor centre at Jarlshof with displays and a collection of artefacts.

The name &quot;Jarlshof&quot; meaning &quot;Earl&#x27;s Mansion&quot; is a coinage of Walter Scott, who visited the site in 1814 and based it on the Scottish period name of &quot;the laird&#x27;s house&quot;. It was more than a century later before excavations proved that there had actually been Viking Age settlement on the site, although there is no evidence that a Norse &quot;jarl&quot; ever lived there.

==History==

The remains at Jarlshof represent thousands of years of human occupation, and can be seen as a microcosm of Shetland history. Other than the Old House of Sumburgh (see below) the site remained largely hidden until a storm in the late 19th century washed away part of the shore, and revealed evidence of these ancient buildings. Formal archaeological excavation started in 1925 and Bronze Age relics were soon discovered. Jarlshof was one of two broch sites which were the first to be excavated using modern scientific techniques between 1949 and 1952. Although the deposits within the broch had been badly disturbed by earlier attempts, this work revealed a complex sequence of construction from different periods. Buildings on the site include the remains of a Bronze Age smithy, an Iron Age broch and roundhouses, a complex of Pictish wheelhouses, a Viking longhouse, and a mediaeval farmhouse. No further excavations have been undertaken since the early 1950s and no radiocarbon dating has been attempted.

===Neolithic===
The earliest finds are pottery from the Neolithic era, although the main settlement dates from the Bronze Age (see below). A site nearby has been dated to 3200 BC.

===Bronze Age===
The Bronze Age in Scotland lasted from approximately 2000 BC to 800 BC. The oldest known remains on the Jarlshof site date from this period, although there is evidence of inhabitation as far back as 2500 BC. The remains of several small oval houses with thick stone walls date to the late Bronze Age and the structures show some similarity to Skara Brae on Mainland, Orkney, but are smaller and of a later date. These buildings may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation.

There is also evidence of a cattle stall with a waste channel leading to a tank in a courtyard and a whale vertebra set into a wall that may have been used as a tethering post. Broken moulds from the smithy indicate that axes, knives, swords and pins were produced there and a bronze dagger was found at the site. The objects indicate the smith was trained in the Irish style of working. Bone pins and awls also survive and an extraordinary bone &quot;plaque&quot;. This latter object is long, has three holes bored into the ends and is decorated with various linear patterns. Its function is unknown. The Bronze Age structures are overlain with sterile sand, suggesting a break in occupation prior to the next phase of building.

===Iron Age and Pictish period===

The inhabitants of the Iron Age built part of their settlement on top of the Bronze Age one. The structures include a complex roundhouse, replaced at a later stage by an &quot;aisled roundhouse&quot;. Neither have been dated although artefacts found at this level include querns that suggest the latter may have been constructed prior to 200 BC.

It is in this period that the broch was built. Part of the structure has been lost to coastal erosion, and modern sea defences have been erected. The tower was probably originally 13 metres (40 feet) or more high and as with many broch sites the position would have commanded fine views of the surrounding seas. During this period archaeological sites in Shetland usually exhibit defensive fortifications of some kind, and Jarlshof is no exception. An outer defensive wall associated with the broch contained a substantial (although rather poorly constructed) house and byre at one time. This wall was utilised at a later stage to build a large roundhouse in the lee of the broch.

The earliest part of the wheelhouse complex has been dated to 200 BC, although other parts were built later, post-dating the 1st century BC–2nd century AD profusion of these structures in the Western Isles by several centuries. Construction used the stones of the broch itself and two of the four main structures are amongst the best examples of their type. Three successive periods of construction were undertaken, and the best preserved retains a significant proportion of the stone part of its roof and displays a series of corbelled bays. One structure was built as a circular building and the radial piers were inserted afterwards. This may have been an earlier, less stable design. In one case the piers are alternately rectangular and V-shaped, in another all are to the latter design, again suggesting a developing style. Unlike many wheelhouses elsewhere in Scotland that are built into the earth, the Jarlshof structures seem to have been built from ground level upwards.

Amongst the artefacts dated to the later Pictish period is a bone pin with a rounded head probably used as a hair or dress pin. It has been dated to AD 500–800. &quot;Painted pebbles&quot; are associated with more than two dozen Pictish sites and one such stone was unearthed at Jarlshof. This rectangular slate fragment had a cross painted onto it and two small S-shaped scrolls suggesting an association with Christian beliefs. One of only two Pictish symbol stones found in Shetland was found here, exhibiting a &quot;double disc&quot; shape and a &quot;Z-rod&quot;. Pottery finds include &quot;buff ware&quot; from the period after AD 10, including bowls with flat rims. The quality of the pots appears to decline in the period prior to Viking settlement, becoming thinner-walled and generally more crude in design.

In AD 43 and 77 the Roman authors Pomponius Mela and Pliny the Elder referred to the seven islands they call &quot;Haemodae&quot; and &quot;Acmodae&quot; respectively, both of which are assumed to be Shetland. Another early written reference to the Shetland islands may have been when Tacitus reported that the Roman fleet had seen &quot;Thule&quot; on a voyage that included the Orkney archipelago in AD 98. Watson in 1926 stated that Tacitus was referring to southern Shetland, probably the area of the brochs in Jarlshof.

===Norse period===
Remains from this era used to cover most of the site, and it is believed the Norse inhabited the site continuously from the ninth to the 14th centuries. Excavations in the 1930s by Alex Curle found the first confirmed Norse longhouse in the British Isles and later digs in the 1950s found evidence of fishing and farming activities. Sheep, cattle, pigs and ponies were kept, Atlantic cod, saithe and ling were eaten, and whale and seal bones have also been found along with the remains of a single dog. Chicken bones are rare in the Norse levels.
There are seven Norse-era houses at Jarlshof, although no more than two were in use at one time. There were several outbuildings, including a small square structure with a large hearth that may have been a sauna and which was later replaced by two separate outhouses. The largest house from this period is a rectangular chamber with opposing doors, timber benches along the long sides, and a hearth in the centre. Unlike the earlier structures that had conical thatched roofs, those of the Norse buildings had ridged timber frames. At a later period this large structure was also used to shelter domesticated animals (at which stage it had a paved centre and animal stalls along the sides) and later still may have become an outbuilding. The door to the byre puzzled archaeologists as it appeared to be too narrow to admit a cow. The mystery was solved when a byre door was excavated at Easting on Unst which had a narrow base similar to Jarlshof&#x27;s but which widened out to become cow-shaped. Another outbuilding has been interpreted as a corn-drying room. Later houses were built at 90 degrees to the longhouse and these are of a type and size that is similar to croft houses that were common in Shetland until the mid-19th century.

One hundred and fifty loom weights were found suggesting wool was an important aspect of Norse-era life. Line weights from the later Norse period and associated evidence from elsewhere in Shetland indicates that deep-water fishing was also a regular undertaking. The Jarlshof site also produced ample evidence of the use of iron tools such as shears, scissors, sickles, and a fish-hook and knife. The ore was locally obtained bog iron. Hazel, birch and willow grew in the area at this time but the pine and oak must have been driftwood or imported timber.

Drawings scratched on slate have been found of dragon-prowed ships, portraits of an old man and of a young, bearded man and of a four-legged animal. The drawings were found in the Viking levels but are Pictish in style and may either pre-date the arrival of the Norse or indicate a continuity of art and culture from one period to the next. Similarly, although the rectangular shape of the Norse-era buildings are quite unlike the earlier rounded Pictish style, the basement courses of the two periods are constructed in the same way. The Viking-style loom weights, spindle whorls and other vessels were found with stone discs and other objects of a Pictish design. A bronze–gilt harness mounting made in Ireland in the 8th or 9th centuries has also been found and many items from this period are in the Shetland Museum. Jarlshof contains the most extensive remains of a Viking site visible anywhere in Britain.

===Old House of Sumburgh===

The castle, now known as Jarlshof House, was built during the Scottish period. Originally a medieval stone farmhouse, it was converted into a fortified house during the 16th century, by Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney after Scotland annexed Shetland. The building was named &quot;New Hall&quot; at this time. It was further modernised in the early 17th century by his son Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney who renamed it the &quot;Old House of Sumburgh&quot;. It then passed into the keeping of John Buchanan and Margaret Hartsyde, but was abandoned in the late 17th century. The structure was also known as &quot;The laird&#x27;s house&quot; and &quot;Stewart Mansion&quot;.

==Cultural references==
Walter Scott set part of his 1821 novel &quot;The Pirate&quot; in the Old House of Sumburgh during the 17th century, which he named &quot;Jarlshof&quot;.

:Man, however, had in former days considered this as a remote or unlikely event; for a Norwegian chief of other times, or, as other accounts said, and as the name of Jarlshof seemed to imply an ancient Earl of the Orkneys had elected this neck of land as the place for establishing a mansion-house. It has been long entirely deserted, and the vestiges only can be discerned with difficulty; for the loose sand, borne on the temptestuous gales of those stormy regions, has overblown, and almost buried, the ruins of the buildings; but in the end of the seventeenth century, a part of the Earl&#x27;s mansion was still entire and habitable. It was a rude building of rough stone, with nothing about it to gratify the eye, or to excite the imagination; a large old-fashioned narrow house, with a very steep roof, covered with flags composed of grey sandstone, would perhaps convey the best of idea of the place to a modern reader. The windows were few, very small in size, and distributed up and down the building with utter contempt of regularity. Against the main structure had rested, in former times, certain smaller compartments of the mansion-house, containing offices, or subordinate apartments, necessary for the Earl&#x27;s retainers and menials. But these had become ruinous; and the rafters had been taken down for fire-wood, or for other purposes; the walls had given way in many places; and, to complete the devastation, the sand had already drifted amongst the ruins, and filled up what had been once the chambers the contained, to the depth of two or three feet.

:Amid this desolation, the inhabitants of Jarlshof had contrived, by constant labour and attention, to keep in order a few roods of land, which had been enclosed as a garden, and which, sheltered by the walls of the house itself, from the relentless sea-blast, produced such vegetables as the climate could bring forth, or rather as the sea-gale would permit to grow; for these islands experience even less of the rigour of cold than is encountered on the mainland of Scotland; but, unsheltered by a wall of some sort of other, it is scarce possible to raise even the most ordinary culinary vegetables; and as for shrubs or trees, they are entirely out of the question, such is the force of the sweeping sea-blast.

<text>In chemistry, a Haworth projection is a common way of writing a structural formula to represent the cyclic structure of monosaccharides with a simple three-dimensional perspective. A Haworth projection approximates the shapes of the actual molecules better for furanoses—which are in reality nearly planar—than for pyranoses that exist in solution in the chair conformation. Organic chemistry and especially biochemistry are the areas of chemistry that use the Haworth projection the most.

The Haworth projection was named after the British chemist Sir Norman Haworth.

A Haworth projection has the following characteristics:
* Carbon is the implicit type of atom. In the example on the right, the atoms numbered from 1 to 6 are all carbon atoms. Carbon 1 is known as the anomeric carbon.
* Hydrogen atoms on carbon are implicit. In the example, atoms 1 to 6 have extra hydrogen atoms not depicted.
* A thicker line indicates atoms that are closer to the observer. In the example on the right, atoms 2 and 3 (and their corresponding OH groups) are the closest to the observer. Atoms 1 and 4 are further from the observer. Atom 5 and the other atoms are the furthest.
*The groups below the plane of the ring in Haworth projections correspond to those on the right-hand side of a Fischer projection. This rule does not apply to the groups on the two ring carbons bonded to the endocyclic oxygen atom combined with hydrogen.

<doc id="522489" wikidata="Q6914055" url="?curid=522489" title="Morrison v. Olson">
<text>Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), was a Supreme Court of the United States decision that determined the Independent Counsel Act was constitutional. &quot;Morrison&quot; also set important precedent determining the scope of Congress&#x27;s ability to encumber the President&#x27;s authority to remove Officers of the United States from office. In &quot;Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&quot; (2020), the Supreme Court distinguished &quot;Morrison&quot; as a narrow exception applying only to inferior officers.

Over the years, the case has become at least as well known for its lone dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia.

==Facts==
The case involved subpoenas from two subcommittees of the United States House of Representatives that directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to produce documents relating to the efforts of the EPA and the Land and Natural Resources Division of the Justice Department to enforce the Superfund law. President Ronald Reagan ordered the Administrator of the EPA to withhold the documents on the grounds that they contained &quot;enforcement sensitive information.&quot; This led to an investigation by the House Judiciary Committee that later produced a report suggesting that Theodore Olson, the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, had given false and misleading testimony before a House subcommittee during the early parts of the investigation.

The Chairman of the Judiciary Committee forwarded a copy of the report to the Attorney General with a request that he seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the allegations against Olson and two others. Alexia Morrison was named independent counsel and given jurisdiction to investigate whether Olson had violated federal law. Olson moved to quash the subpoenas and sued Morrison in her official capacity.

Olson argued that the Office of the Independent Counsel took executive powers away from the office of the President of the United States and created a hybrid &quot;fourth branch&quot; of government that was ultimately answerable to no one. He argued that the broad powers of an independent counsel could be easily abused or corrupted by partisanship. Morrison in turn argued that her position was necessary in order to prevent abuses by the executive branch, which historically operated in a closed environment.

==Holding==
The Court held that the independent counsel provision of the Ethics in Government Act did not violate the principle of separation of powers because it did not increase the power of one branch at the expense of another. Instead, even though the President (an executive office) cannot fire Independent Counsel, he still counts as an officer of the Executive branch, i.e., he is not under the control of either the U.S. Congress or the courts.

===Justice Scalia&#x27;s dissent===

==== Opinion ====
Justice Scalia, the lone dissenter, said that the law should be struck down because (1) criminal prosecution is an exercise of &quot;purely executive power&quot; and (2) the law deprived the president of &quot;exclusive control&quot; of that power.

In his opinion, Scalia predicted how the law might be abused in practice, writing, &quot;I fear the Court has permanently encumbered the Republic with an institution that will do it great harm.&quot; His discussion of the separation of powers affected by &quot;Morrison v. Olson&quot; is famous for its rhetorical comparison to other Supreme Court cases on separation of powers:

Scalia&#x27;s dissent in &quot;Morrison&quot; is frequently cited as one of his most memorable and rhetorically powerful opinions, and it is considered by many to be at the top of the list. Over time, Scalia&#x27;s lone dissent has become far more widely accepted as the correct view and likely led to the 1999 Congressional vote to scuttle the independent counsel statute.

==== Agreement with the dissent from politicians and commentators ====
Conservatives like Senator Bob Dole shared similar concerns when Lawrence Walsh announced the re-indictment of former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger on charges related to the Iran–Contra affair four days before the 1992 U.S. presidential election. Critics also sensed partisan politics when Walsh&#x27;s office leaked a note suggesting President Bush Sr. had lied about his connections to the affair.

Concerns were also raised, in line with Scalia&#x27;s dissent, when independent counsel Kenneth Starr spent $40 million and more than four years investigating President Clinton&#x27;s land deals and extramarital affairs. Writing in the New York Times while Starr&#x27;s work was ongoing, legal journalist Linda Greenhouse reported that Scalia&#x27;s dissent, formerly disregarded by liberals, was instead being &quot;cited and passed around in liberal circles like samizdat.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Congress let the Independent Counsel Act expire in 1999. Then-Judge Samuel Alito said the decision hit the separation of powers doctrine &#x27;about as hard as heavy-weight champ Mike Tyson usually hits his opponents.&#x27;&quot; It seemingly &quot;drove a stake into the heart of&quot; &quot;Myers v. United States&quot;, the controlling case on presidential removal powers at that time. In 2013, Justice Scalia described &quot;Morrison v. Olson&quot; as the most wrenching case in which he had participated:

Probably the most wrenching was &quot;Morrison v. Olson&quot;, which involved the independent counsel. To take away the power to prosecute from the president and give it to somebody who&#x27;s not under his control is a terrible erosion of presidential power. And it was wrenching not only because it came out wrong—I was the sole dissenter—but because the opinion was written by Rehnquist, who had been head of the Office of Legal Counsel, before me, and who I thought would realize the importance of that power of the president to prosecute. And he not only wrote the opinion; he wrote it in a manner that was more extreme than I think Bill Brennan would have written it. That was wrenching.&quot;In April 2006, a court citing &quot;Morrison&quot; rejected I. Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby&#x27;s argument that Special Counsel Patrick J. Fitzgerald lacked the legal authority to bring charges against him. &quot;Morrison&quot; was distinguished in &quot;Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&quot; (2020) as being an exception to the President&#x27;s generally unencumbered authority to remove officers of the United States at will. The Court held that &quot;Morrison&quot;&#x27;s holding was a narrow exception only applying to inferior officers.

<doc id="522495" wikidata="Q340515" url="?curid=522495" title="The Fall of Gondolin">
<text>The Fall of Gondolin is a 2018 book of fantasy fiction by J. R. R. Tolkien, edited by his son Christopher. The story is one of what Tolkien called the three &quot;Great Tales&quot; from the First Age of Middle-earth; the other two are &quot;Beren and Lúthien&quot; and &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot;. All three stories are briefly summarised in the 1977 book &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, and all three have now been published as stand-alone books. A version of the story also appears in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;. In the narrative, Gondolin was founded by King Turgon in the First Age. The city was carefully hidden, enduring for centuries before being betrayed and destroyed. Written in 1917, it is one of the first stories of Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium.

== Text ==

=== Origins ===

Tolkien began writing the story that would become &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot; in 1917 in an army barracks on the back of a sheet of military marching music. It is one of the first stories of his Middle-earth legendarium that he wrote down on paper, after his 1914 tale, inspired by the Old English manuscript Crist 1, &quot;The Voyage of Earendel, the Evening Star&quot;. While the first half of the story &quot;appears to echo Tolkien&#x27;s creative development and slow acceptance of duty in the first year of the war,&quot; the second half echoes his personal experience of battle. The story was read aloud by Tolkien to the Exeter College Essay Club in the spring of 1920.

Tolkien was constantly revising his First Age stories; however, the narrative he wrote in 1917, published posthumously in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, remains the only full account of the fall of the city.

=== Publication of versions of the story ===

The narrative &quot;Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin&quot; in the 1977 book &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; was the result of the editing by his son Christopher using the 1917 narrative (minus some elements all too obviously evocative of World War I warfare) and compressed versions from the different versions of the &quot;Annals&quot; and &quot;Quentas&quot; as additional sources. The later &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot; and the &quot;Grey Annals&quot;, the main sources for much of the published &quot;Silmarillion&quot;, both stop before the beginning of the Tuor story.

A partial later version of &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot; was published in the 1980 book &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; under the title &quot;Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin&quot;. Originally titled &quot;Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin,&quot; this narrative shows a great expansion of the earlier tale. Christopher Tolkien retitled the story before including it in &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, because it ends at the point of Tuor&#x27;s arrival in Gondolin, and does not depict the actual Fall.

There is also an unfinished poem, &quot;The Lay of the Fall of Gondolin&quot;, of which a few verses are quoted in the 1985 book &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot;. In 130 verses Tolkien reaches the point where dragons attack the city.

== Reception ==

=== By Tolkien scholars ===

Douglas Kane writes in &quot;Journal of Tolkien Research&quot; that &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot; was the first of Tolkien&#x27;s three &quot;Great Tales&quot; to be written, and the last to be published, the other two being the Great Tale of Túrin Turambar (published in &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot;, 2007, edited into a continuous story) and &quot;Beren and Lúthien&quot; (2017, presented as a set of versions of the story). That left the tale which was &quot;arguably the one in which the world of Middle-earth is most vividly presented and in which Tolkien’s philosophical themes are most profoundly expressed.&quot; Kane adds that although the book collects material already published, &quot;it still succeeds in rounding out that task&quot;, for instance by putting the &quot;Sketch of the Mythology&quot; in the prologue. He wonders, though, why the editor included part of the poem &quot;The Flight of the Noldoli from Valinor&quot; (already in &quot;The Lays of Beleriand&quot;), but omits the poem fragment &quot;The Lay of the Fall of Gondolin&quot; which is far more obviously relevant. Kane admires Alan Lee&#x27;s illustrations, both in colour and in black and white, as providing &quot;a perfect complement&quot; to the final book in the &quot;unique and remarkable&quot; collaboration between Christopher Tolkien and his father.

Jennifer Rogers, reviewing the book for &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot;, writes that it &quot;highlights the power of the Gondolin story in its own right with minimal editorial intrusion.&quot; As Tolkien&#x27;s first tale and the last one to be published by his son, the book is &quot;laden with the sense of weight such a publication brings&quot;, taking the reader back to the place where the whole Legendarium began, the story about Eärendel (later called Eärendil).

=== In newspapers ===

According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Patient and dedicated readers will find among the references to other books and their many footnotes and appendices a poignant sense of completion and finality to the life&#x27;s pursuit of a father and son.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, writer Andrew Ervin said that &quot;&quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot; provides everything Tolkien&#x27;s readers expect.&quot; According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;Even amid the complexities and difficulties of the book—and there are many—there is enough splendid imagery and characterful prose that readers will be carried along to the end even if they don&#x27;t know where they are going.&quot;

<doc id="522513" wikidata="Q967732" url="?curid=522513" title="Belltown, Seattle">
<text>Belltown is the most densely populated neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States, located on the city&#x27;s downtown waterfront on land that was artificially flattened as part of a regrading project. Formerly a low-rent, semi-industrial arts district, in recent decades it has transformed into a neighborhood of trendy restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, and residential towers as well as warehouses and art galleries. The area is named after William Nathaniel Bell, on whose land claim the neighborhood was built.

In 2007, CNNMoney named Belltown the best place to retire in the Seattle metro area, calling it &quot;a walkable neighborhood with everything you need.&quot;

Belltown is home to Antioch University, Argosy University, City University of Seattle, and the Seattle School of Theology &amp; Psychology. It lies directly west of the Denny Triangle neighborhood, where online retailer Amazon&#x27;s three office towers house its downtown headquarters, and where the Cornish College of the Arts is located.

==Businesses==
Although many new businesses have eclipsed older ones, some venerated establishments still draw crowds of loyal patrons. Some of the classic, old Seattle nightspots in Belltown are: The Rendezvous, The Lava Lounge, Ohana, The Crocodile Cafe, and Shorty&#x27;s. At one time Alaska Airlines had its headquarters in what is now Belltown. The original Ace Hotel was founded in Belltown and is still active today.

==Geography==

The neighborhood is bounded on the north by Denny Way, beyond which lies Seattle Center, Lower Queen Anne, and Queen Anne Hill, on the southwest by Elliott Bay, on the southeast by Virginia Street, beyond which lies the Pike Place Market and the rest of Downtown, and on the northeast by 5th Avenue, beyond which lies the Denny Triangle.

All of its northwest- and southeast-bound streets are major thoroughfares (Alaskan Way and Elliott, Western, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Avenues); major northeast- and southwest-bound thoroughfares are Broad, Wall, and Battery Streets. The State Route 99 tunnel runs under Belltown for a number of blocks as it connects the Alaskan Freeway to Aurora Avenue North.

North on Western Avenue at Vine Street is the Belltown P-Patch and the Cottage Park. These single family homes built in 1916 are the last of 11 on the 1/4 block. The Cottages mark the 1850s shoreline and are the last remaining wood framed residences in downtown Seattle. The Belltown P-Patch provides gardening opportunities through the City of Seattle P-Patch program.

==Sculpture garden==
The Olympic Sculpture Park, a public sculpture garden of adjacent to Myrtle Edwards Park, is located on the northern edge of the Belltown waterfront. The park features contemporary pieces, various ecosystems with plants indigenous to the Pacific Northwest, and a restored beach and seawall. The park&#x27;s construction was funded entirely with private donations and is operated by the Seattle Art Museum. Unlike other such parks in the United States, the Olympic Sculpture Park is unwalled, and admission is free.

== Transportation ==
Belltown is traversed by multiple high-frequency transit routes operated by King County Metro, including light Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) services branded RapidRide. As of 2022, RapidRide route E, which provides frequent service from North Seattle to Downtown Seattle via Aurora Avenue and through Belltown, has the highest ridership of all of King County Metro&#x27;s transit services. Westlake Station is located just to the south of Belltown and is served by Sound Transit&#x27;s 1 Line, part of the Seattle metropolitan area&#x27;s regional light rail system.

==&quot;Film Row&quot;==

The Pathé Theatre at 717 1st Avenue opened around 1910 and a Pathé Exchange debuted at 2113 3rd Avenue. In August 1916, the Mutual Exchange opened at 3rd and Virginia in a building with an auditorium.

The first building constructed for Seattle&#x27;s burgeoning film industry and in what would become &quot;Film Row&quot; in Belltown opened in 1922 in the Pathe Building designed by Julian F. Everett at 2025 3rd Avenue (which was demolished in 2016). Eventually, silent-era film exchanges in Seattle serviced approximately 470 commercial movie theaters throughout Washington, Idaho, Montana and Oregon.
Concern about the flammability of nitrocellulose film resulted in the concentration of film exchanges in this single neighborhood, as a zoning issue.

Polk&#x27;s 1923 &quot;Seattle City Directory&quot; shows 26 listings for &quot;Motion Picture Machines and Supplies&quot;. All except the U.S. Army Motion Picture Service are within one block of the corner of Virginia Street and Third Avenue.

From the 1920s into at least the 1960s, Second Avenue in Belltown was home to Seattle&#x27;s second &quot;Film Row.&quot; In 1928, just after the era of talkies began, the role of the Second Avenue film row was consolidated by the erection of the terra-cotta-ornamented, art deco Film Exchange Building (FEB, also known as the Canterbury Building) designed by Seattle architect Earl W. Morrison; it covered an entire block on the west side of Second Avenue, from Battery Street to Wall Street.

By 1930, Polk lists only 18 Seattle film exchanges; while Kodascope Libraries is at 111 Cherry Street in the Pioneer Square neighborhood, all of the others are on Second Avenue within a block of Battery Street (save only Columbia Pictures at First and Battery). This situation was essentially unchanged in 1948: 19 entries under &quot;Motion Picture Distributors and Film Exchanges&quot;, 15 of them in this same two blocks, and two of the others elsewhere in Belltown.

Nothing remains of the FEB. Universal Pictures was the last film business to pull out, in 1980. The building closed in 1991 and was demolished in 1992. Immediately south, the block of Second Avenue on the other side of Battery still contains many remnants of the Film Row era. The Jewel Box theater of the Rendezvous bar is the one remaining screening room in the neighborhood, but several other buildings remain. The McGraw-Kittenger-Case building on the southwest corner of Second and Battery was once the MGM building, and is now a bar and restaurant.

Just south of it is the former William Tell Hotel, once the film industry favorite, later low-income housing, and now a traveler&#x27;s hostel. Farther down the block, the former National Theater Building now houses several small businesses. At 2332 First Avenue, Paramount&#x27;s former film exchange building has housed the Catholic Seaman&#x27;s Club since 1955; the ground floor is now the Sarajevo restaurant and lounge, and the Catholic Seaman&#x27;s Club is upstairs.

<doc id="522518" wikidata="Q3499879" url="?curid=522518" title="Stornoway (residence)">
<text>Stornoway is the name of the official residence of the leader of the Official Opposition in Canada, and has been used as such since 1950. It is provided in recognition of the opposition leader&#x27;s position and is located at 541 Acacia Avenue in the Rockcliffe Park area of Ottawa, Ontario. Stornoway has assessed value $4,225,000 (2008) (based on this value, which is only an approximation of the market value, the municipal property taxes are calculated) and is maintained with $70,000 a year in government funds. The property has been owned and managed by the National Capital Commission since April 1986. The lot size, with a frontage of and depth of , is slightly irregular.

The property is from Ottawa&#x27;s Parliament Buildings, whereas the prime minister&#x27;s official residence is only away from Parliament. It is located in an area which contains many ambassadorial residences.

==History==
The house was built by architect Allan Keefer in 1914 for Ottawa grocer Ascanio J. Major and was given the name &quot;Stornoway&quot; by the second occupants, Irvine Gale Perley-Robertson and Ethel Lesa Perley, after the ancestral home of the Perley family in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland.

During the Second World War, from summer 1941 to 1945, Mrs. Perley-Robertson offered Stornoway to (then) Princess Juliana of the Netherlands as a temporary home-in-exile for the Dutch royal family, including the future Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.

Stornoway has served its present role as the Official Opposition leader&#x27;s residence since 1950, when it was purchased by a group of concerned citizens and later transferred to the Government of Canada.

Although the Bloc Québécois were the official Opposition from 1993 to 1997, party leader Lucien Bouchard declined to move into the residence as a mark of protest against the federal government, choosing instead to live in nearby Gatineau, Quebec. His successors, Gilles Duceppe and Michel Gauthier, likewise did not reside in Stornoway.

Following the 1997 election, when the Reform Party of Canada displaced the Bloc Québécois to become the Official Opposition, Reform leader Preston Manning also declined to move in, but for a different reason. Manning protested that Stornoway was too extravagant and a waste of taxpayer money, even joking that it should be used as a bingo hall to pay off the national debt. He asked to be provided with a more &quot;modest&quot; residence, but soon moved into Stornoway after his refusal to do so began to be portrayed in the media as a mark of disrespect for his position as the leader of the Opposition.

Renovations from 2002 to 2006 included an overhaul of the living room and kitchen, repair of the chimney, replacement of carpets, refinishing of hardwood floors, and painting, among other things.

Jack Layton, who had led the New Democratic Party to official Opposition status in the May 2, 2011 election, moved in a month later, but stated that he would continue to live in Toronto when Parliament was out of session. He died on August 22 of cancer; it was subsequently revealed that Layton and his wife Olivia Chow actually spent just one night in the house. His interim successor as NDP leader, Nycole Turmel, also did not formally move into the house, though she used Stornoway for entertaining purposes and slept over on occasion.

Of the leaders of the Opposition, John Reynolds, Bill Graham, Rona Ambrose, and Candice Bergen are the only interim party leaders to have resided at Stornoway; Bergen was the most recent resident after being selected as interim leader of the Conservative Party of Canada after Erin O&#x27;Toole was ousted as leader in a vote by Conservative MPs according to the terms of the &quot;Reform Act&quot;. Permanent Conservative leaders Andrew Scheer and Erin O&#x27;Toole moved in after their party elected them as leaders in its 2017 and 2020 leadership elections, respectively.

===List of residents===
Completed in 1914, the building had three occupants prior to its acquisition by the Government of Canada. Ascanio Joseph Major, a local grocer, was the original occupant of Stornoway, residing there from 1914 to 1923. In 1923, the Perley-Robertson family acquired the home. From 1941 to 1945, during the Second World War, the Dutch royal family leased the home from the Perley-Robertson family. 

In 1950, the building was acquired by a private trust, and later transferred to the Government of Canada. Since 1950, Stornoway has been used as the official residence of the leader of the official opposition in the House of Commons of Canada. Official opposition leaders (including interim leaders) who resided in Stornoway include:

*George A. Drew 1950–56
*Vacant, 1956–58 as William Earl Rowe, John Diefenbaker, and Louis St. Laurent did not use the house during their respective terms as opposition leader.
*Lester B. Pearson 1958–63
*John Diefenbaker 1963–67
*Robert Stanfield 1968–76
*Joe Clark 1976–79
*Pierre Trudeau 1979–80
*Joe Clark 1980–83
*Brian Mulroney 1983–84
*John Turner 1984–90
*Jean Chrétien 1990–93
*Vacant, 1993–97 as Bloc Québécois leaders Lucien Bouchard, Gilles Duceppe, and Michel Gauthier refused to use the house
*Preston Manning 1997–2000
*Stockwell Day 2000–01
*John Reynolds 2001–02
*Stephen Harper 2002–06
*Bill Graham February–December 2006
*Stéphane Dion 2006–08
*Michael Ignatieff 2008–11
*Jack Layton May–August 2011 
*Nycole Turmel 2011–12 
*Tom Mulcair 2012–15
*Rona Ambrose 2015–17
*Andrew Scheer 2017–20
*Erin O&#x27;Toole 2020–22
*Candice Bergen February–September 2022
*Pierre Poilievre 2022–present
==Architecture==
Stornoway is a 19-room mansion with eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, living room, sitting room (2nd floor), and dining room, and sits on extensive grounds.

Besides the residents in the home, Stornoway is served by a staff of three: a chef, chauffeur, and household administrator. Like 24 Sussex and Rideau Cottage the public is not allowed to visit Stornoway.

<doc id="522519" wikidata="Q268477" url="?curid=522519" title="Diastereomer">
<text>In stereochemistry, diastereomers (sometimes called diastereoisomers) are a type of stereoisomer. Diastereomers are defined as non-mirror image, non-identical stereoisomers. Hence, they occur when two or more stereoisomers of a compound have different configurations at one or more (but not all) of the equivalent (related) stereocenters and are not mirror images of each other. 
When two diastereoisomers differ from each other at only one stereocenter, they are epimers. Each stereocenter gives rise to two different configurations and thus typically increases the number of stereoisomers by a factor of two.

Diastereomers differ from enantiomers in that the latter are pairs of stereoisomers that differ in all stereocenters and are therefore mirror images of one another.
Enantiomers of a compound with more than one stereocenter are also diastereomers of the other stereoisomers of that compound that are not their mirror image (that is, excluding the opposing enantiomer).
Diastereomers have different physical properties (unlike most aspects of enantiomers) and often different chemical reactivity.

Diastereomers differ not only in physical properties but also in chemical reactivity — how a compound reacts with others. Glucose and galactose, for instance, are diastereomers. Even though they share the same molar weight, glucose is more stable than galactose. This difference in stability causes galactose to be absorbed slightly faster than glucose in human body.

Diastereoselectivity is the preference for the formation of one or more than one diastereomer over the other in an organic reaction. In general, stereoselectivity is attributed to torsional and steric interactions in the stereocenter resulting from electrophiles approaching the stereocenter in reaction.

==Syn / anti==
When the single bond between the two centres is free to rotate, cis/trans descriptors become invalid. Two widely accepted prefixes used to distinguish diastereomers on sp³-hybridised bonds in an open-chain molecule are syn and anti. Masamune proposed the descriptors which work even if the groups are not attached to adjacent carbon atoms. It also works regardless of CIP priorities. Syn describes groups on the same face while anti describes groups on opposite faces. The concept applies only to the Zigzag projection. The descriptors only describe relative stereochemistry rather than absolute stereochemistry.
All isomers are same.

==Erythro / threo==
Two older prefixes still commonly used to distinguish diastereomers are threo and erythro. In the case of saccharides, when drawn in the Fischer projection the erythro isomer has two identical substituents on the same side and the threo isomer has them on opposite sides. When drawn as a zig-zag chain, the erythro isomer has two identical substituents on different sides of the plane (anti). The names are derived from the diastereomeric four-carbon aldoses erythrose and threose. These prefixes are not recommended for general use because it is often difficult to discern how to apply their definitions to particular comounds. However, the prefixes can usefully describe the relative configuration of a compound that has the following properties: it has at least four C atoms, exactly two of those C atoms are stereocenters, the stereocenters are adjacent, and the two substituents on each stereocenter can clearly be labeled as &quot;larger&quot; (usually a heteroatom such as N, O, or S) and &quot;smaller&quot; (usually H).

Threitol and erythritol are both four-carbon sugar alcohols. Erythritol is achiral (has at least one conformation with a plane or center of symmetry), whereas threitol is chiral. A useful English-language mnemonic device is that &quot;threitol&quot; and &quot;chiral&quot; both begin with consonants, whereas &quot;erythritol&quot; and &quot;achiral&quot; both begin with vowels. 

Another threo compound is threonine, one of the amino acids coded by DNA. Its erythro diastereomer, allothreonine, is not coded by DNA and is very rare in nature.

In alkene addition reactions, syn addition to a trans alkene, or anti addition to a cis alkene, gives a threo product, whereas syn addition to a cis alkene, or anti addition to a trans alkene, gives an erythro product.

== Multiple stereocenters ==

If a molecule contains two asymmetric centers, there are up to four possible configurations, and they cannot all be non-superposable mirror images of each other. The possibilities for different isomers continue to multiply as more stereocenters are added to a molecule. In general, the number of stereoisomers of a molecule can be determined by calculating 2&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; = the number of chiral centers in the molecule. This holds true except in cases where the molecule has meso forms. These meso compounds are molecules that contain stereocenters, but possess an internal plane of symmetry allowing it to be superposed on its mirror image. These equivalent configurations cannot be considered diastereomers.

For &quot;n&quot; = 3, there are eight stereoisomers. Among them, there are four pairs of enantiomers: R,R,R and S,S,S; R,R,S and S,S,R; R,S,S and S,R,R; and R,S,R and S,R,S. There are many more pairs of diastereomers, because each of these configurations is a diastereomer with respect to every other configuration excluding its own enantiomer (for example, R,R,R is a diastereomer of R,R,S; R,S,R; and R,S,S). For &quot;n&quot; = 4, there are sixteen stereoisomers, or eight pairs of enantiomers. The four enantiomeric pairs of aldopentoses and the eight enantiomeric pairs of aldohexoses (subsets of the five- and six-carbon sugars) are examples of sets of compounds that differ in this way.

== Diastereomerism at a double bond ==
Double bond isomers are always considered diastereomers, not enantiomers. Diastereomerism can also occur at a double bond, where the &quot;cis&quot; vs &quot;trans&quot; relative positions of substituents give two non-superposable isomers. Many conformational isomers are diastereomers as well.

In the case of diastereomerism occurring at a double bond, E-Z, or entgegen and zusammen (German), is used in notating nomenclature of alkenes.

==Applications==
As stated previously, two diastereomers will not have identical chemical properties. This knowledge is harnessed in chiral synthesis to separate a mixture of enantiomers. This is the principle behind chiral resolution. After preparing the diastereomers, they are separated by chromatography or recrystallization. Note also the example of the stereochemistry of ketonization of enols and enolates.

The town&#x27;s population is around 6,953, making it the third-largest island town in Scotland after Kirkwall in Orkney and Lerwick in Shetland. The historical civil parish of Stornoway, which includes various nearby villages, has a combined population of just over 10,000. The Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (the Western Isles Council) measures population in a different area: the &quot;Stornoway settlement&quot; area, Laxdale, Sandwick and Newmarket; in 2019, the estimated population for this area was 6,953.

Stornoway is an important port and the administrative centre of the Outer Hebrides. It is home to Comhairle nan Eilean Siar and a variety of educational, sporting and media establishments. Until relatively recently, observance of the Christian Sabbath (Sunday) has been associated with Hebridean culture. Recent changes mean that Sundays on Lewis now more closely resemble those in most parts of the Southern Isles, i.e. Benbecula, South Uist, Barra, and Vatersay, and on mainland Scotland.

==History==

The town was founded by Vikings in the early 9th century, with the Old Norse name &quot;Stjórnavágr&quot;. The settlement grew up around a sheltered natural harbour and became a hub for people from all over the island, who travelled to Stornoway either by family boat or by horse-drawn coach, for onward travel to and trade with the rest of Scotland and further afield.

At some point in the mid-1500s, the already ancient MacLeod castle in Stornoway &#x27;fell victim to the cannons of the Duke of Argyle&#x27;. By the early 1600s rumbling trade wars came to a head, and all further government attempts to curtail traditional shipping rights were firmly resisted by the islanders, as was an attempt by James VI, King of Scotland, to establish on the island the Scottish trading company known as the Fife Adventurers around 1598. As a result, James VI transferred Lewis to the MacKenzies of Seaforth in 1610. 

In 1844, the MacKenzies sold Stornoway, and the Isle of Lewis as a whole, to Sir James Matheson. He and his descendants built the present Lews Castle on a hill overlooking the bay of Stornoway. Fragmentary ruins of the old Stornoway Castle had survived in the bay until that time, and can even be seen in Victorian photographs, but Matheson destroyed them in 1882, in order to expand the harbour; a few remains of Stornoway Castle still remain, hidden beneath pier number 1, close to the shore, slightly west of centre. By 1863, the town had become a police burgh.

In 1918, Matheson&#x27;s great-nephew sold the island to William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme. Lord Leverhulme held the island for a short time. His economic plans for the island (together with various business setbacks) overstretched his finances. Faced with failure in Lewis, he gave Stornoway parish to the people of the town. The Stornoway Trust was formed and continues to administer the parish.

During World War II the Stornoway aerodrome was used by the military, and the town was a base for anti-submarine planes and a fuelling station for other aircraft. The castle was used as a hospital and living quarters for the personnel of 700 Naval Air Squadron. Between 1986 and 1993, the airport was employed as a &quot;NATO Forward Operating Base for Air Defence aircraft protecting the fleet&quot; for six weeks each year.

Stornoway Town Hall was officially re-opened for community use in March 2012.

==Economy==
The Isle of Lewis website states that the town&#x27;s &quot;economy is a mix of traditional businesses like fishing, Harris Tweed and farming, with more recent influences like tourism, the oil industry and commerce&quot;. The sheltered harbour has been important for centuries; it was named Steering Bay by Vikings who often visited.

A 2018 report states that the fishing industry&#x27;s primary focus is on aquaculture (fish farming). A conventional fishery still existed, &quot;composed solely of inshore shellfish vessels targeting prawns, crabs and lobsters around the islands and throughout the Minch&quot;.

=== Harbour and maritime industry ===
On 1 January 1919, &quot;Iolaire&quot; sank at the entrance of the harbour, one of the worst maritime disasters in Scottish or UK waters, with a death toll of 205 men, who were returning home from World War I.

Today, the harbour hosts a fishing fleet (and associated shoreside services) somewhat reduced from its heyday, a small marina and moorings for pleasure craft, a small shipyard and slipway, three larger piers for commercial traffic and Stornoway Lifeboat Station, run by the RNLI and home to a , &quot;Tom Sanderson&quot;. His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard operates a Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre from a building near the harbour.

A lighthouse, seaweed processing plant and a renewable energy manufacturing yard are situated on Arnish Point at the mouth of the harbour and visually dominate the approaches. Arnish Point is also proposed by AMEC as the landfall for its proposed private sub-sea cable which would export the electricity generated from the Lewis Windpower wind farm. A planning application for 181 turbines was submitted to the Scottish Executive; but in 2008, the Scottish Government rejected the plans.

Since then Lewis Windpower has obtained planning consent for a maximum of 36 wind turbines to be sited to the west of Stornoway on land held by community-owned Stornoway Trust Estate.

The Arnish area was also surveyed by SSE for a second sub-sea cable, but lost out in favour of Gravir to the south as the preferred site. SSE preferred Arnish Point as of 2016. The manufacturing yard was originally established in the 1970s as a fabrication plant for the oil industry, but suffered regular boom and bust cycles. The downturn in business from the North Sea oil industry in recent years led to a move away from serving this market. The yard is now proposed as a key business in the development of the whole Arnish Point industrial estate and has received large amounts of funding in recent years.

In 2007, the Arnish yard was taken over by its third tenant in as many years. Cambrian Engineering fell into liquidation as did Aberdeen-owned Camcal Ltd with relatively large-scale redundancies. Both firms were affected by the absence of a regular stream of orders and left a chain of large debts impacting upon local suppliers. Altissimo Ltd is a new firm backed by a group of Swiss and Dutch investors, and has purchased the Camcal name from the previous operator. In December 2007, the yard won a contract to construct 49 towers for wind turbines in Turkey. This will ensure employment for around 70 employees for over six months.

As of 2021, the yard is now operated by Harland and Wolff.

In September 2020, Stornoway Port Authority announced that development of a new £49 million deep water terminal was to go ahead following the approval of marine licences by Marine Scotland.

The new multi-purpose terminal will provide berthing for vessels up to 360m long with a water depth of 10m below Chart datum, a ferry berth, and 6.5 hectares of land for unloading, storage and industrial uses.

In April 2022, Stornoway Port Authority announced they had signed a £49 million construction contract for their new Deep Water Terminal. The contract was awarded to building and civil engineering firm McLaughlin and Harvey. Work is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.

=== Wind farm ===
The UK&#x27;s largest community-owned wind farm, the 9 MW Beinn Ghrideag, is located outside Stornoway and is operated by Point and Sandwick Trust (PST). In February 2021, that organisation was shortlisted for the title of Best Community Energy Project at the Scottish Highlands and Islands Renewable Energy Awards. A February 2021 report stated that this operation &quot;already has a number of awards and multiple nominations&quot;. Point and Sandwick Trust helps fund community activities &quot;because of the revenue created at our wind farm, Beinn Ghrideag. The 3 turbine, 9 MW scheme is built on common grazings land on the Isle of Lewis&quot;.

==Climate==
Like much of the British Isles, Stornoway has an oceanic climate, with relatively little variation of temperature and damp conditions throughout the year. Winters are exceptionally mild for such a northerly location; average nighttime low temperatures in January and February, the coldest months, are above , while daytime high temperatures average about . Summers are cool, due to influence from the Atlantic Ocean; average daytime high temperatures in July and August are just over . Precipitation falls mostly as rain (though snow occasionally falls in winter), and October through January are the wettest months due to frequent, sometimes intense storms from the North Atlantic, which can bring heavy rain and high winds. April through July represents a markedly drier season, when storm frequency and intensity diminish markedly. June is the driest month in Stornoway, averaging of precipitation, while January is the wettest month, averaging .

A quirk of the climate on Stornoway and the Isle of Harris more widely is that it records the highest frequency of hail in the UK, with 30 or more days per year of measurable hail falling. 
==Transport==

The Caledonian MacBrayne-operated ferry has been sailing since 2015, from Stornoway harbour to Ullapool on the Scottish mainland, taking 2 hours 30 minutes. There are an average of two return crossings a day: more in summer than in winter. The former main ship on the route, (1995), used to carry the freight crossing; however, she has now been reassigned elsewhere by CalMac. This means that MV &quot;Loch Seaforth&quot; is often heavily congested, particularly during the summer months.

The idea of an undersea tunnel linking Lewis and Harris to the Scottish mainland was suggested in early 2007. One of the possible routes, between Stornoway and Ullapool, would be over long: the longest road tunnel in the world.

Stornoway is the hub of bus routes in Lewis: buses run to Point, Ness, Back and Tolsta, Uig, the West Side, Lochs and Tarbert, Harris. These buses are operated by Comhairle nan Eilean Siar and several private operators.

Stornoway Airport is located next to the village of Melbost, east of the town; there are flights to Edinburgh, Inverness and Glasgow, all operated by Loganair. and Benbecula operated by Hebridean Air Services. The airport is also the base of an HM Coastguard Search &amp; Rescue Sikorsky S-92 helicopter, and was previously home to RAF Stornoway. In 1898, the Hebridean Light Railway Company was proposed, with a terminus at Stornoway, but the line was never constructed.

Cruise ships visit the town and anchor in the bay, with passengers coming ashore on tenders.

== Education ==
Stornoway is home to the Nicolson Institute: founded in 1873, it is the largest school in the Western Isles and the only secondary school in Lewis, providing a six-year course. It has a roll of around 1,000 pupils. After a two-year rebuilding project costing £29 million, the new school building was formally opened in October 2012.

Primary education in Stornoway is in Stornoway Primary School, which opened in August 1969. The school is on Jamieson Drive and has around 400 pupils. The head teacher is Annette Murray.

There is a further education college, Lews Castle College, which was founded in 1953 and is now part of the University of the Highlands and Islands. Lews Castle College runs over 140 courses and has around 2700 students.

There is also a small campus of the University of Stirling in Stornoway, teaching nursing, based in the Western Isles Hospital. It provides undergraduate degree programmes for adult nursing and supports postgraduate students, who can choose from various higher-level courses.

==Sport==

Football is the most popular amateur sport and Goathill Park is the home ground of Stornoway United, with a capacity of 1,000. Stornoway United play in the Lewis and Harris Football League.

Shinty is making a resurgence thanks to the Lewis Camanachd team, who are based in the town. Rugby Union is also popular, and Stornoway RFC men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams compete regularly in national leagues and cups.

The town also has a very popular gymnastics group, which competes annually in sports festivals. Stornoway Golf Club, the only 18-hole golf course in the Outer Hebrides, is set in the undulating slopes of the Lews Castle Grounds.

Very near to the Nicolson Institute is the Lewis Sports Centre (&quot;Ionad Spors Leòdhas&quot;), which has a sports hall, fitness suite, climbing wall, swimming pool and various other facilities. It has a running track and an AstroTurf football pitch. There is also the Stornoway Karate Club, a member of the International Japan Karate Association.

== Culture and media ==
According to the 2011 Census, there are 5,492 Scottish Gaelic speakers (43%) in the greater Stornoway area.

The annual Hebridean Celtic Festival is a 4-day community-led festival which attracts over 10,000 visitors each July. The Royal National Mòd has been held in Stornoway on a number of occasions, most recently in 2005, 2011 and 2016. Large influxes of visitors such as for these events can strain the town&#x27;s accommodation capacity.

Stornoway is a sister town of Pendleton, in Anderson County, South Carolina, United States.

=== An Lanntair ===
An Lanntair (The Lantern) is a multi-purpose arts centre on Stornoway&#x27;s seafront. The purpose-built facility opened in October 2005. The arts centre was previously housed upstairs in Stornoway Town Hall.

==Stornoway in popular media and culture==
Stornoway became immortalised in the song &quot;Lovely Stornoway&quot; by Calum Kennedy and Bob Halfin, the song has recently been covered in by Hebridean rock band Peat and Diesel.

The 4AD Records folk-rock band Stornoway took their name from the town, after seeing it on the BBC weather report. They signed their record deal outside the Woodlands Centre in Lews Castle Grounds, Stornoway, after performing in the town for the first time in April 2010. Their second concert there was as headliners on the main stage of the Hebridean Celtic Festival on 13 July 2011.

&quot;Stornoway&quot; is the name of the official residence of the Leader of the Opposition in Canada&#x27;s Parliament. It was built in 1913 by wholesale grocery magnate Ascanio Joseph Major. He commissioned architect Alan Keefer to design this &#x27;country house&#x27;. Stornoway was bought by the local Perley-Robertson family in 1923 and they extended the property over the next few years.

The novel &quot;The Stornoway Way&quot; by Lewisman Kevin MacNeil tells of one man&#x27;s attempts to escape his hometown. The novel was later adapted for the stage and premiered at An Lanntair, Stornoway on 30 August 2019.

RAF Stornoway is featured in the Tom Clancy novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; as a base for Allied air operations over the North Atlantic and against Soviet-held Iceland.

In the motion picture &quot;Latitude Zero&quot; by Toho Productions (1969), Stornoway Harbour is featured on a wall plaque as the construction site of the submarine &quot;Alpha&quot;.

In 2007, British car manufacturer Land Rover introduced &quot;Stornoway Grey&quot; as a colour choice for its vehicle line-up. In response, Stornoway&#x27;s councillor Angus Nicolson appealed to Land Rover to relabel the colour as &quot;Silvery Stornoway&quot;, fearing that the association of &quot;grey&quot; with &quot;dull&quot; and &quot;boring&quot; would hurt the image of the town with tourists. Mr Nicolson said: &quot;This is deeply insulting and is offensive, inaccurate and inherently degrading. This will hit tourism as it subliminally implants adverse connotations in the minds of those who have never experienced the reality of these beautiful islands.&quot; Land Rover replied that the colour in question is one of the most popular ones and the use of Stornoway in its name will instead &quot;keep it on the map&quot;.

In 2011, Scottish author Peter May published &quot;The Blackhouse&quot;, the first of The Lewis Trilogy of thrillers based on Lewis, where the primary police murder investigation is based in Stornoway.

<text>Donald Pearce Shiley (January 19, 1920 – July 31, 2010) was the inventor of the Bjork–Shiley valve, a prosthetic heart valve. He was a 1951 alumnus of the University of Portland, where he studied engineering.

==Early life==
He was born in Yakima, Washington, on January 19, 1920. His family was homesteaders, and followed the fruit harvest; he joined his brothers at harvest time through the years of the Great Depression, but quickly learned that his interest and skill were in “fixing things” on the farm. He said that “I liked machines. I liked the way they are ideas that get built.“

Shiley attended Oregon State University, the Land-grant university in Oregon, on a scholarship, but left to join the Navy for service in World War II. After the war, he enrolled at the University of Portland, a private Roman Catholic institution, using the G.I. Bill benefits to study engineering and chemistry. In 1951, he graduated first in his class.

==Career==
Shiley began working at Edwards Laboratories, located in Orange County, California, south of Los Angeles, the first manufacturer of artificial heart-valves.

Later he established his own company, Shiley Laboratories, in the same area. His first valve was developed together with the American heart-surgeon Kay, and was the first disc heart-valve. Compared with the Edwards valve, which had the shape of a little ball, the disc valve needed much less space within the heart when implanted.

Some years later, Shiley improved his design in cooperation with Swedish heart surgeon Viking Björk, which led to the first tilting disc heart-valve, resulting in a much better flow of blood through the valve.

Shiley Labs developed and manufactured other products, especially tracheal and endotracheal tubes for respiration after surgery in the mouth or throat, and during anesthesia.

The Björk–Shiley heart valve underwent several improvements in the following years, primarily in the degree of opening of the disc, thus reducing turbulence in the bloodstream.

Some years later, Shiley decided to sell his company to Pfizer, and retired.

==Personal life==
Shiley was married twice: to Pat, the mother of his four children and who died in middle-age; and to Darlene Marcos.

==Death==
Shiley died on July 31, 2010, after deteriorating health. He is survived by his wife, Darlene Marcos, and four children and five grandchildren

==Legacy==
In March 2007, the Shileys donated $12 million to the University of Portland, for renovating the University&#x27;s School of Engineering. The grant was the largest the university had ever received. Shiley also made a donation to the University of San Diego for the Donald P. Shiley Center for Science and Technology. In 2012, Darlene Shiley donated $1 million to MASTERPIECE Trust, the PBS fund which supports the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; program series, when the &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; series brought increased interest in Masterpiece and after the fund had lost a major donor.

<text>The Transverse Ranges are a group of mountain ranges of southern California, in the Pacific Coast Ranges physiographic region in North America. The Transverse Ranges begin at the southern end of the California Coast Ranges and lie within Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside and Kern counties. The Peninsular Ranges lie to the south. The name is due to the ranges&#x27; east–west orientation, making them to the general northwest–southeast orientation of most of California&#x27;s coastal mountains.

The ranges extend from west of Point Conception eastward approximately 500 kilometers into the Mojave and Colorado Desert. The geology and topography of the ranges express three distinct segments that have contrasting elevations, rock types, and vegetation. The western segment extends to the San Gabriel Mountains and San Gabriel fault. The central segment includes mountains that range eastward to the San Andreas fault. The eastern segment extends from the Cajon Pass at the San Andreas fault eastward to the Colorado Desert. The central and eastern segments (near the San Andreas fault) have the highest elevations.

Most of the ranges lie in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. Lower elevations are dominated by chaparral and scrubland, while higher elevations support large conifer forests. Most of the ranges in the system are fault blocks, and were uplifted by tectonic movements late in the Cenozoic Era. West of Tejon Pass, the primary rock types are varied, with a mix of sedimentary, volcanic, and metamorphic rocks, while regions east of the pass are dominated by plutonic granitic and metasedimentary rocks.

==Geography==

The western and central segments of the Transverse Ranges are bounded to the north and east by the San Andreas Fault, which separates those segments from the Mojave Desert. The eastern segment bounds the southern Mojave Desert. Notable passes along the San Andreas fault include Tejon Pass, Cajon Pass, and San Gorgonio Pass. Components of Transverse Ranges to the north and east of the fault include the San Bernardino Mountains, Little San Bernardino Mountains, Pinto and Eagle Mountains. The western and southern boundaries are acknowledged to be the Pacific Ocean and the northern Channel Islands. Onshore the Los Angeles Basin lies at the southern boundary of the western and central segments of the ranges. Major passes not along the San Andreas Fault include Gaviota Pass, San Marcos Pass, the Conejo Grade, Newhall Pass, and Cahuenga Pass.

The Transverse Ranges manifest themselves as a series of roughly parallel ridges with an average height of . The ranges are dissected by young, steep streams of relatively low flow rate; as a result, there is high topographic relief throughout the range, and other than in marginal areas (e.g. the San Fernando Valley) and a few river valleys (such as Lockwood Valley and Big Bear Valley), there are no large, flat basins within the ranges.

The mountains are notable for being steep and difficult to traverse. There are few passes that are sufficiently low or wide enough to accommodate significant volumes of traffic. This has resulted in situations where major cities are linked to the rest of the state by relatively few roads; for example, the vast majority of traffic between the Central Valley and the Los Angeles area is routed through Tejon Pass. This results in significant traffic issues throughout Southern California when a pass has to be shut down due to heavy snow or construction. Occasionally, major cities, such as Santa Barbara during the 2005 La Conchita landslide and the 2018 Southern California mudflows, may be cut off from timely road access to the rest of Southern California.

=== Ranges ===

==== Western segment ====
This segment begins at Point Conception in Santa Barbara County, and include the Santa Ynez Mountains that run parallel to the coast behind Santa Barbara and the San Rafael Mountains on the other side of the Santa Ynez Valley. The western Transverse Ranges also include the Topatopa Mountains and the Santa Susana Mountains of Ventura County and Los Angeles County, the Simi Hills, the Santa Monica Mountains that run along the Pacific coast behind Malibu, and whose eastern portion are known as the Hollywood Hills, and the Chalk Hills. The northern Channel Islands of California are also part of the Transverse Ranges; San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and Anacapa Islands are a westward extension of the Santa Monica Mountains.

==== Central segment ====
The Ranges include the steep San Gabriel Mountains northeast of Los Angeles, the Sierra Pelona Mountains just south of the San Andreas fault, the Tehachapi Mountains southeast of Bakersfield, the Verdugo Mountains, the Liebre-Sawmill Mountains, the San Rafael Hills, Puente Hills, San Jose Hills, and Chino Hills.

==== Eastern segment ====
The San Bernardino Mountains, Little San Bernardino Mountains, and the Pinto, Eagle, and Orocopia Mountains are within the eastern segment. The Mojave Desert and California&#x27;s low desert, including the Coachella Valley, are at the eastern end of the ranges.

Ranges north of the western segment that are nearly transverse but are part of the California Coast Ranges include the San Rafael Mountains and the Sierra Madre Mountains. Likewise, the Tehachapi Mountains north of the Mojave Desert, although nearly transverse, are the southern end of the Sierra Nevada.

==== Component ranges ====
Mountain ranges with peaks exceeding , listed west to east, include:
* Santa Ynez Mountains
* San Rafael Mountains
* Pine Mountain Ridge
* San Emigdio Mountains
* Topatopa Mountains
* Sierra Pelona Ridge
* San Gabriel Mountains
* San Bernardino Mountains
* Little San Bernardino Mountains

Examples of smaller mountain and hill ranges include:
* Santa Monica Mountains
* Santa Susana Mountains
* Simi Hills
* Chalk Hills
* San Rafael Hills
* Puente Hills
* San Jose Hills
* Shandin Hills
===Climate===
The climate in most of the range is &quot;Csb&quot; (Warm-summer Mediterranean) under the Köppen climate classification; the upper reaches of San Gorgonio Mountain have an alpine tundra climate (&quot;ET&quot;), while the lower northern slopes of the range have a desert (&quot;BW&quot;) or steppe (&quot;BS&quot;) climate; most of the nearby lowlands to the south and west have a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;).

Snow falls above most winters, and above every few years. It is rare for elevations above to go multiple winters without snow, even during severe droughts. Due to relatively low humidity, the regional snow line lies at about , above the highest elevation of the range; as such, snow does not persist year-round except in the form of snow patches.

The tree line lies at about ; San Gorgonio Mountain is the only peak with an alpine environment.
==Geology==


===Tectonics===
The Transverse Ranges result from a complex of tectonic forces and faulting stemming from the interaction of the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate along the dextral (right slip) San Andreas Fault system. Their orientation along an east–west axis as opposed to the general northwest–southeast trend of most California ranges results from a pronounced left step in the San Andreas Fault that occurred in the Pliocene ( million years ago) when southern reaches of the fault moved east to open the Gulf of California. The crust within the Pacific Plate south of the ranges can not easily make the left turn westward as the entire plate moves northwestward, forcing pieces of the crust to compress and lift.

Prior to this shift of the fault to create the left bend, northwest–southeast trending rock belts in all of the Transverse Ranges began to rotate clockwise in the right shear of Pacific Plate – North American Plate motion. This tectonic rotation began in Early Miocene Time and continues today. The total rotation is about 90° in the Western Transverse Ranges and less (about 40°) in the eastern ranges. Catalina Island shows the most rotation: almost 120°.

A mechanism proposed for the rotation event is capture of the subducting Monterey plate by the outboard Pacific plate. Because the Monterey plate was then beneath southern California, the capture resulted in pulling of the overlying crust out and northward from the rest of California.

===Rocks===
Rocks of the Transverse Ranges exhibit extreme differences in geologic age and composition, varying from sedimentary rocks in the western Santa Ynez and volcanic rocks in the Santa Monica Mountains to primarily granitic and metamorphic rock in the central and eastern segments, including the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains.

The oldest basement (deepest) rocks are of Proterozoic age, and are found in the San Gabriel Mountains and the San Bernardino Mountains. The Jurassic-Cretaceous Franciscan Assemblage is found in the western section of the ranges and is the presumed basement in this segment. Exposed plutonic rocks from the Mesozoic, mostly granites, can be found on Mount Pinos and generally in regions east of Tejon Pass. The youngest rocks are Cenozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks that can be found throughout the ranges.

The western segment is distinctive for the large thickness of Cretaceous and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, estimated to be up to 10 kilometers. The thickest deposits of these are in the Santa Barbara Channel and Ventura basin. These are mostly marine in origin with a marked change to red beds of river systems of Oligocene age in the western and central segments.

Limestones and dolomites of the marine Miocene Monterey Formation are found in the Santa Ynez Mountains and in the Coast Ranges to the north.

===Faults===
The distinctive feature of the Transverse Ranges besides their anomalous orientation is that they are bounded by east-west trending faults. Most are left slip, strike slip faults. In the western and central segments many of the faults are thrust faults. Faults in the Coast Ranges and Peninsular Ranges trend northwest-southeast and butt into the east-west trending faults of the Transverse Ranges. Because all of these faults are considered active and seismic but they do to cut each other, the only geometry that satisfies that observation is if the east-west faults and Transverse Ranges are rotating clockwise with respect to the faults outside that province.

Between the western segment and the Peninsular Ranges to the south is the complex Malibu Coast—Santa Monica—Hollywood fault, which exists as the border between these two mostly geologically unitary provinces. These faults are part of the same thrust fault system south of the northern Channel Islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Anacapa Islands. North of the western segment the bounding faults are left slip Santa Ynez and Pine Mountain Faults. The San Gabriel Fault and San Andreas bound the central segment. The eastern segment is bounded by the Pinto Mountain Fault in the north and the Salton Creek Fault in the south.

===Petroleum===

The large thickness of marine sediments in the western segment have made it a habitat for oil. Several dozen fields are found onshore and offshore, particularly in the Santa Barbara Channel and Ventura Basin. Much oil has pooled in the Monterey Formation, which is produced onshore and offshore. In the eastern Santa Barbara Channel oil is held in younger sedimentary rocks. The Los Angeles Basin south of the western segment, formed during rotation of that segment away from the Peninsular Ranges. It is also a site of prolific oil production. The California Geologic Survey states:

Great thicknesses of Cenozoic petroleum-rich sedimentary rocks have been folded and faulted, making California one of the most important oil-producing areas in the United States.

==Ecology==

The plant place of the Transverse ranges include coastal sage scrub, oak woodland and savanna, and pinyon-juniper woodland at lower elevations, and yellow pine forest, Lodgepole Pine, and subalpine forest at higher elevations. The Angeles and Los Padres National Forests cover portions of the Transverse ranges. The ranges are part of the WWF-designated California montane chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, but the eastern points of the range touch two desert regions, the Mojave Desert and the Colorado Desert section of the Sonoran Desert. The Carrizo Plain adjoins the northern edge of the Transverse Range.

Chaparral is a common feature of the Transverse Ranges. Common plant associates in chaparral, especially in the transition between coastal chaparral and coastal sage scrub, include California sagebrush and Toyon, the latter shrub having its southern distribution limit defined by the Transverse Ranges.

Pinyon-juniper woodland is common on the north slopes of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains. This ecosystem is easily visible in the well-travelled Soledad Pass region, between Pearblossom and Santa Clarita.

===Urban impact===
A number of densely populated coastal plains and interior valleys lie between the mountain ranges, including the Oxnard Plain of coastal Ventura County, the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley, which is mostly included in the City of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Basin, which includes the portion of Los Angeles County south of the Santa Monica Mountains and most of Orange County, and the Inland Empire basin, which includes the cities of San Bernardino and Riverside, lie between the Transverse Ranges and the Peninsular Ranges to the south.

==Transportation==

There are a number of important freeways that cross the Transverse Ranges, such as (from west to east) US-101, I-5 at Tejon Pass, SR 14 at Soledad Pass, and I-15 at Cajon Pass. These highways link Southern California with places to the north and northeast like San Francisco and Las Vegas, respectively. With the exception of several high passes on less-traveled SR 33, SR 2, SR 330. SR 18 and SR 38, none of these passes are at high elevations, with Cajon Pass being at a modest 4,190 ft (1,277 m) above mean sea level; this means that snow is less of a factor here than in the moderate to high mountain passes to the north like Donner Pass. Still sometimes, heavy snowfall can snarl traffic on Tejon and Cajon Pass, the higher two of the three freeway passes. I-5 and I-15 commonly experience heavy traffic over their mountainous route across these mountains.

<text>The Queen Anne style of British architecture refers to either the English Baroque architecture of the time of Queen Anne (who reigned from 1702 to 1714) or the British Queen Anne Revival form that became popular during the last quarter of the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century. In other English-speaking parts of the world, New World Queen Anne Revival architecture embodies entirely different styles.

==Overview==
With respect to British architecture, the term is mostly used for domestic buildings up to the size of a manor house, and usually designed elegantly but simply by local builders or architects rather than the grand palaces of noble magnates. The term is not often used for churches. Contrary to the American usage of the term, it is characterised by strongly bilateral symmetry, with an Italianate or Palladian-derived pediment on the front formal elevation.

Colours were made to contrast with carefully chosen red brick for the walls, with details in a lighter stone that is often rather richly carved. Christopher Wren used this technique, which achieved a rich effect for a considerably lower cost than using stone as a facing throughout, in his rebuilding of Hampton Court Palace, commissioned by William and Mary. Here, it harmonized well with the remaining Tudor parts of the palace. This highly visible example probably influenced many others.

The architectural historian Marcus Binney, writing in &quot;The Times&quot; in 2006, describes Poulton House in Poulton, Wiltshire (built in 1706, during the reign of Queen Anne) as &quot;...Queen Anne at its most delightful&quot;. Binney lists what he describes as the typical features of the Queen Anne style:
* a sweep of steps leading to a carved stone door-case
* rows of painted sash windows in boxes set flush with the brickwork
* stone quoins emphasizing corners
* a central triangular pediment set against a hipped roof with dormers
* typically box-like &quot;double pile&quot; plans, two rooms deep

When using the revived &quot;Queen Anne style&quot; of the 19th and 20th centuries, the historical reference in the name should not be taken at all literally, as buildings said to be in the &quot;Queen Anne style&quot; in other parts of the English-speaking world normally bear even less resemblance to English buildings of the early 18th century than those of any style of revival architecture to the original. In particular, Queen Anne style architecture in the United States is a wholly different style, as in Australia, and normally includes no elements typical of the actual architecture of Queen Anne&#x27;s reign, the names being devised for marketing purposes.

==British Queen Anne Revival==

George Devey (1820–1886) and the better-known Norman Shaw (1831–1912) popularized the Queen Anne style of British architecture of the industrial age in the 1870s. Norman Shaw published a book of architectural sketches as early as 1858, and his evocative pen-and-ink drawings began to appear in trade journals and artistic magazines in the 1870s. American commercial builders quickly adopted the style.

Shaw&#x27;s eclectic designs often included Tudor elements, and this &quot;Old English&quot; style also became popular in the United States, where it became known (inaccurately) as the Queen Anne style. Confusion between buildings constructed during the reign of Queen Anne and the &quot;Queen Anne&quot; style persists, especially in England.

British Victorian Queen Anne architecture empathises more closely with the Arts and Crafts movement than its American counterpart. A good example is Severalls Hospital in Colchester, Essex (1913–1997), which is now defunct.

The historical precedents of the architectural style were broad and several:
* fine brickwork, often in a warmer, softer finish than the Victorians characteristically used, varied with terracotta panels or tile-hung upper storeys, with crisply-painted white woodwork or blond limestone detailing
* oriel windows, often stacked one above another
* corner towers
* asymmetrical fronts and picturesque massing
* Flemish mannerist sunken panels of strapwork
* deeply shadowed entrances
* broad porches
* overall, a domesticated free Renaissance style

In the 20th century, Edwin Lutyens and others used an elegant version of the style, usually with red-brick walls contrasting with pale stone details.

==New World Queen Anne Revival==

===United States===

In the United States, &quot;Queen Anne&quot; is used to describe a wide range of picturesque buildings with &quot;free Renaissance&quot; (non-Gothic Revival architecture) details and as an alternative both to the French-derived Second Empire and the less &quot;domestic&quot; Beaux-Arts architecture, is broadly applied to architecture, furniture, and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910; some &quot;Queen Anne&quot; architectural elements, such as the wraparound front porch, continued to be found into the 1920s.

The gabled and domestically scaled style arrived in New York City with the new housing for the New York House and School of Industry Sidney V. Stratton, architect, 1878. Distinctive features of American Queen Anne architecture may include an asymmetrical façade; dominant front-facing gable, often cantilevered beyond the plane of the wall below; overhanging eaves; round, square, or polygonal tower(s); shaped and Dutch gables; a porch covering part or all of the front façade, including the primary entrance area; a second-story porch or balconies; pedimented porches; differing wall textures, such as patterned wood shingles shaped into varying designs, including resembling fish scales, terra cotta tiles, relief panels, or wooden shingles over brickwork, etc.; dentils; classical columns; spindle work; oriel and bay windows; horizontal bands of leaded windows; monumental chimneys; painted balustrades; and wooden or slate roofs. Front gardens often had wooden fences.

===Australia===

In Australia the influence of Richard Norman Shaw contributed to the development of the Federation style, of which the heyday lasted from 1890 to 1915, and which is subdivided into twelve phases, Federation Queen Anne being one and the most popular style for houses built between 1890 and 1910. The style often used Tudor-style woodwork and elaborate fretwork that replaced the Victorian taste for wrought iron. Verandahs were usually a feature, as were the image of the rising sun and Australian wildlife, plus circular windows, turrets, and towers with conical or pyramid-shaped roofs.
The first Queen Anne house in Australia was Caerleon in the suburb of Bellevue Hill, Sydney. Caerleon was designed initially by a Sydney architect, Harry Kent, but was then substantially reworked in London by Maurice Adams. This led to some controversy over who deserved the credit. The house was built in 1885 and was the precursor for the Federation Queen Anne house that was to become so popular. The APA Building in the Melbourne central business district was an example of the Queen Anne style being used for non-residential purposes. However, at some stage, the building may have been apartments. It was demolished in 1981 after the modernism boom in Melbourne took off – factors that sealed its demolition included rapacious development, lax heritage attitudes in Australian cities, and the owner&#x27;s decision to argue for a demolition permit, which was granted.

Caerleon was followed soon after by West Maling, in the suburb of Penshurst, New South Wales, and Annesbury, in the suburb of Ashfield, both built circa 1888. Although built around the same time, these houses had distinct styles, West Maling displaying a robust Tudor influence that was not present in Annesbury. The style became increasingly popular, appealing predominantly to reasonably well-off people with an &quot;Establishment&quot; leaning.

The style as it developed in Australia was highly eclectic, blending Queen Anne elements with various Australian influences. Old English characteristics like ribbed chimneys and gabled roofs were combined with Australian aspects like encircling verandahs, designed to keep the sun out. One outstanding example of this eclectic approach is Urrbrae House, in the Adelaide suburb of Urrbrae, part of the Waite Institute. Another variation connected to the Federation Queen Anne style was the Federation Bungalow, featuring extended verandahs. This style generally incorporated familiar Queen Anne elements, but usually in simplified form.

Some prominent examples are:
* West Maling, corner of Penshurst Avenue and King Georges Road, Penshurst, Sydney
* Homes, Appian Way, Burwood, Sydney
* Homes, Haberfield, Sydney
* Caerleon, 15 Ginahgulla Road, Bellevue Hill, Sydney
* Annesbury, 78 Alt Street, Ashfield, Sydney
* Weld Club, Barrack Street, Perth
* ANZ Bank, Queens Parade, Fitzroy North, Melbourne
* Campion College, Studley Park Road, Kew, Melbourne
* Redcourt Estate, Armadale, Melbourne
* Tay Creggan, Hawthorn, Melbourne

<text>The Bighorn Basin is a plateau region and intermontane basin, approximately 100 miles (160 km) wide, in north-central Wyoming in the United States. It is bounded by the Absaroka Range on the west, the Pryor Mountains on the north, the Bighorn Mountains on the east, and the Owl Creek Mountains and Bridger Mountains on the south. It is drained to the north by tributaries of the Bighorn River, which enters the basin from the south, through a gap between the Owl Creek and Bridger Mountains, as the Wind River, and becomes the Bighorn as it enters the basin. The region is semi-arid, receiving only 6–10 in (15–25 cm) of rain annually.

The largest cities in the basin include the Wyoming towns of Cody, Thermopolis, Worland, and Powell. Sugar beets, pinto beans, sunflowers, barley, oats, corn and alfalfa hay are grown on irrigated farms in the region.

==History==
The basin was explored by John Colter in 1807. Just west of Cody, he discovered geothermal features that were later popularly called &quot;Colter&#x27;s Hell&quot;. The region was later transversed by the Bridger Trail, which was blazed in 1864 by Jim Bridger to connect the Oregon Trail to the south with Montana. The route was an important alternative to the Bozeman Trail, which had crossed the Powder River Country, but had been closed to white settlers following Red Cloud&#x27;s War. Around the turn of the 20th century the Bighorn Basin was settled by ranchers such as William &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody who founded the town of Cody and owned a great deal of land surrounding the Shoshone River. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad extended a branch line to Cody in 1901 and ultimately built through the entire basin. In 1904, Cody helped to form the Shoshone project, the nation&#x27;s first federal water development project to help irrigate the western portion of the basin. The project culminated in the construction of the Buffalo Bill Dam and reservoir. The wealth in the region also attracted outlaws. Butch Cassidy lived near Meeteetse for a while and was arrested at the insistence of local cattle baron Otto Franc and sent to the Wyoming State Penitentiary for horse theft. Following his release, he formed the Wild Bunch gang which operated from the Hole-in-the-Wall area southeast of the Bighorn Basin.

In 1942 one of the nation&#x27;s ten Japanese American internment camps was located in Park County in the western part of the basin. The camp was named Heart Mountain Relocation Center, after nearby Heart Mountain. The camp operated until 1945, and at its peak detained over 10,000 internees.

==Geology==

The Bighorn Basin forms a geologic structural basin filled with more than of sedimentary rocks from Cambrian to Miocene in age. Since the early 20th century the basin has been a significant source of petroleum, and has produced more than of oil. The principal reservoir of oil is the Pennsylvanian Tensleep Formation; Other important petroleum horizons are the Mississippian Madison Limestone, Permian Phosphoria Formation and the Cretaceous Frontier Sandstone.

Some uranium has been mined in the northern part of the basin, along the Bighorn Mountains.

The eastern section of the basin is famously rich in fossils, with formations such as the Cretaceous period Cloverly Formation yielding numerous dinosaur fossils.

The alluvial strata of the Willwood and Fort Union Formations of the Bighorn Basin contain a well-documented record of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Analysis of paleosols here shows that the Bighorn Basin became more arid during the PETM, with wet/dry cycles superimposed over this general increase in aridity. These changes in environment are coupled with changes in paleoecology.

<doc id="522627" wikidata="Q255268" url="?curid=522627" title="Gretchen Mol">
<text>Gretchen Mol (born November 8, 1972) is an American actress. She is known for her role as Gillian Darmody in the HBO series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; (2010–2014). She also appeared in the films &quot;Rounders&quot; (1998), &quot;Celebrity&quot; (1998), &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; (1999), &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot; (2005) – in which she played the title character – &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; (2007), and &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot; (2016).

==Early life==
Mol was born on November 8, 1972, in Deep River, Connecticut, where her mother, Janet (née Morgan), is an artist and teacher, and her father is a teacher at RHAM High School. She went to high school with Broadway actor Peter Lockyer, with whom she performed in school musicals and plays. Her brother, Jim Mol, is a director and editor in the film industry. Mol attended The American Musical and Dramatic Academy and graduated from the William Esper Studio. She took a job for a while as an usher at Angelika Film Center in New York. She had followed her brother there when he was in NYU film school.

==Stage==

Mol&#x27;s acting career began in summer stock theatre in Vermont where she played a variety of roles, including &quot;Godspell&quot; and &quot;110 in the Shade&quot;. She played Jenny in Neil LaBute&#x27;s &quot;The Shape of Things&quot; on stage in both London and New York in 2001, in a role she reprised in the film version, released in 2003. The &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Ben Brantley, in his review of the play (which he disliked), wrote, &quot;[Mol] gives by far the most persuasive performance as the unworldly Jenny, and you wind up feeling for her disproportionately, only because she seems to be entirely there, in the present tense&quot;. In 2004, Mol spent a year singing and dancing as Roxie Hart in the Broadway production of &quot;Chicago&quot;. In 2014–2015, Mol played the role of Emily in the Broadway debut of Ayad Akhtar&#x27;s Pulitzer-Prize-winning play, &quot;Disgraced&quot;.

==Film==

While major roles have been sporadic, Mol has been in more than 30 feature films. She made her film debut in Spike Lee&#x27;s 1996 film, &quot;Girl 6.&quot; She said, &quot;I was auditioning for &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and I was happy I got a Spike Lee movie, which was a tiny part, but all of a sudden I had Spike Lee on my resume. I didn&#x27;t audition for day player anymore&quot;.

After &quot;Girl 6&quot;, New York filmmaker Abel Ferrara took notice and cast her in two movies, &quot;The Funeral&quot; (1996) and &quot;New Rose Hotel&quot; (1998). She had a small role in &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; (1997), but by now, she was being typecast as &quot;the girlfriend&quot;, which she attempted to change by taking a role opposite Jude Law in &quot;Music from Another Room&quot; (1998), a romantic comedy. The film went virtually unnoticed by critics and audiences.

In 1998, she appeared in several notable films, including &quot;Rounders&quot;, starring Matt Damon and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity&quot; opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. In 1998, she also came to prominence when she was featured on the cover of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, dubbed the &quot;It Girl of the Nineties&quot; by the magazine.

For her second film with Woody Allen, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Sweet and Lowdown,&quot; she played a minor role which the &quot;Greenwich Village Gazette&quot; called &quot;notable&quot;. She played the female lead role in the 1999 film &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot;. She played the victim of a con artist in the 2003 short film &quot;Heavy Put-Away&quot;, based on the Terry Southern story. In 2006, she shared the lead in a romantic comedy, &quot;Puccini for Beginners&quot;, in which her character has a lesbian affair.

Mol worked with Mary Harron for two years as the director struggled to finance &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot;: &quot;I kind of felt like I lived with it for a while; certainly not as long as Mary Harron did but I got a good chance to really feel like I knew something about Bettie so by the time the role was mine and I was on set, I was pretty confident. I felt like I really worked for it.&quot;

The next year, 2007, was one of her busiest, with four films in production or in release, including a remake of &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; starring Russell Crowe, and &quot;An American Affair&quot;, in which her character, Catherine Caswell, has an affair with John F. Kennedy. When released in February 2009, the film was harshly criticized by &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Stephen Holden, though he said that Mol&#x27;s part was &quot;quite well acted&quot;.

In April 2008, she began filming &quot;Tenure&quot; in Philadelphia, working opposite Luke Wilson and Andrew Daly. Though it had received some good reviews after being screened at several film festivals, it was released direct-to-video in February 2010. She appeared in Kenneth Lonergan&#x27;s acclaimed film &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot; in 2016.

==Television==
Mol&#x27;s first television work was in a Coca-Cola commercial. Mol had a small role of Maggie Tilton in the 1996 miniseries &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Walk&quot;, based on the Larry McMurtry novel. She also was in a few episodes of &quot;Spin City&quot;. She was among the three lead actresses in David E. Kelley&#x27;s 2002 series &quot;girls club&quot;, though it ended after its second episode due to underwhelming ratings.

She appeared in two TV remakes of classic films: &quot;Picnic&quot; (2000), in the role of Madge Owens, and &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; as Lucy Morgan (2002). She made a Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie in January 2007, starring in &quot;The Valley of Light&quot;, a story set in post–World War II based on a novel by Terry Kay. It was her second Hallmark production. She had a minor role in &quot;Calm at Sunset&quot; in 1996.

She played Norah in &quot;The Memory Keeper&#x27;s Daughter&quot; which aired on The Lifetime Channel in the U.S. in April 2008.

She played NYPD Officer Annie Norris in the ABC series &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, the U.S. remake of the British show of the same name. It started airing in the U.S. on October 9, 2008 and ran 17 episodes, concluding on April 1, 2009.

Mol had a recurring role on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; as Gillian Darmody, a showgirl at the Beaux Arts and mother and incestuous lover to gangster Jimmy Darmody (played by Michael Pitt). The actress shared two SAG Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series with the cast in 2010 and 2011.

In February 2018, she played attorney Sam Henessy in the Netflix series &quot;Seven Seconds&quot;. On April 18, 2018, Netflix confirmed the show would not have a second season, deeming it a limited series.

==Personal life==
Interviewed by the Associated Press in Baltimore in December 2006, Mol commented about how she maintained her confidence as an actress: &quot;It is an ongoing struggle. Confidence is something that sometimes you have and sometimes you don&#x27;t. And the older you get, hopefully, the more you have some tools to at least fake it&quot;.

She married film director Tod Williams on June 1, 2004. Their first child, a son, was born in September 2007. In February 2011, Mol gave birth to their second child, a daughter. Since becoming a mother, Mol has only taken jobs close to her home in New York City. &quot;I told my agent I didn&#x27;t want to work in L.A., even if it was the greatest job in the world. I didn&#x27;t want to compromise.&quot;

Mol serves as the national spokesperson in the United States for the PMD Foundation, which funds research and awareness of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease, a neurological disorder which affects children worldwide. Mol became involved with PMD after one of her cousins died from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (familiarly known as &quot;Lou Gehrig&#x27;s Disease&quot;).

<text>Silverstone is a village and civil parish in Northamptonshire, England. It is about from Towcester on the former A43 main road, from the M1 motorway junction 15A and about from the M40 motorway junction 10, Northampton, Milton Keynes and Banbury. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 2,176. The A43 now bypasses to the south-east of the village.

The village&#x27;s name probably means, &#x27;farm/settlement of Saewulf/Sigewulf&#x27;.

The Silverstone Circuit, the current home of the British Grand Prix, is located nearby; it straddles the Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire border.

The village is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Silvestone&quot; and &quot;Selvestone&quot;.

==Parish church==
Silverstone had a chapel by 1200 CE. In about 1780 the medieval building was replaced by a Georgian one, which was enlarged by the addition of a chancel in 1841 and a north aisle and vestry in 1852. The entire church was demolished in the 1880s and replaced by the present Church of England parish church of Saint Michael, which is a Gothic Revival building designed by James Piers St Aubyn and completed in 1884.

On the north side of the parish churchyard are the remains of medieval fish ponds.

==Facilities==
The village has one public house: the White Horse Inn.

About south of the village is the Silverstone Circuit, a former Royal Air Force World War II bomber base and now the traditional home of the British Grand Prix, a Formula One race that attracts more than 300,000 visitors each year.

Silverstone University Technical College opened at the circuit in September 2013.

Adjacent to Silverstone Circuit is Silverstone Park, a business park operated by MEPC plc, with a focus on engineering and high-tech activities. The site is home to over 80 organisations, including Envision Racing, David Brown Automotive, Delta Motorsport, Ducati UK Ltd, National College for Motorsport, Danecca Limited and Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence. It also features the UK&#x27;s only dedicated sub-contract inspection metrology facility, managed by Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, a technical partner to Red Bull Formula 1.

Silverstone is also the base of the Formula One constructor Aston Martin—formerly known as Racing Point, Force India and Jordan—and is set to be the British base of Cadillac.

In the Middle Ages, the village trade was primarily in timber from the surrounding Whittlewood forest through the use of coppicing. Linnell Brothers still operate a woodyard to this day.

<doc id="522633" wikidata="Q2398227" url="?curid=522633" title="The Wall (Sartre short story collection)">
<text>The Wall () by Jean-Paul Sartre, a collection of 5 short stories published in 1939 containing the eponymous story &quot;The Wall&quot;, is considered one of the author&#x27;s greatest existentialist works of fiction. Sartre dedicated the book to his companion Olga Kosakiewicz, a former student of Simone de Beauvoir.

==&quot;The Wall&quot;==
The eponymous story coldly depicts a situation in which prisoners are condemned to death. Written in 1939, the story is set in the Spanish Civil War, which began July 18, 1936, and ended April 1, 1939, when the Nationalists (known in Spanish as the &quot;Nacionalistas&quot;), led by General Francisco Franco, overcame the forces of the Spanish Republic and entered Madrid. 

The title refers to the wall used by firing squads to execute prisoners. The Wall itself symbolises the inevitability and unknowing of one&#x27;s death. The protagonist, Pablo Ibbieta, along with two others in his cell, is sentenced to death. He is offered a way out if he reveals the location of his comrade, Ramón Gris. Pablo begins thinking to himself and finds that he no longer cares about his cause or his life. Pablo continues to refuse to cooperate until just before his scheduled execution, when, seeing no harm in it, he gives the authorities what he believes to be false information on Ramón Gris&#x27; whereabouts. Ramón Gris moved from his previous hiding place to the very spot where Pablo tells the authorities he may be found. Thus Ramón Gris is shot and Pablo&#x27;s life is, at least temporarily, spared from death.

==&quot;The Room&quot;==
In &quot;La Chambre&quot; (&quot;The Room&quot;), Mme Darbédat is confined to her room by an unknown illness, where she spends her bedridden days reminiscing about the past and eating rahat-loukoums. She receives weekly visits from her husband, M. Darbédat; that day, during their conversation, it is revealed that the Darbédats&#x27; daughter, Ève, refuses to allow her husband Pierre – who suffers from apparent insanity – to be put away into an asylum. Mme Darbédat hints at Ève and Pierre&#x27;s continued romantic intimacy, further angering her husband. M. Darbédat decides to pay Ève a visit, and the narrative shifts from the “sane” world of the Darbédats into the “sick,” perverse world of Pierre. After witnessing some of Pierre’s eccentric, abnormal behavior, M. Darbédat, unable to convince Ève to send the &quot;madman&quot; to Dr Franchot&#x27;s clinic, finally leaves the apartment in helpless frustration. In the second part of the story, the nature of Pierre’s bizarre psychosis is explored more fully: he remains locked in a room that he has painted in black, calls his wife “Agatha” and recounts delusions about a time spent with her in Hamburg, and keeps a talisman (which he calls a “ziuthre”) to deal with his hallucinations. Nevertheless, Ève wishes to understand and engage in Pierre&#x27;s psychotic world, which she finds authentic (in so doing, Ève has cut herself off from &quot;normal&quot; society). Ève watches as Pierre hallucinates a group of flying, buzzing statues, after which he goes to sleep. As she watches him sleep, Ève wonders how soon it will be before he shows signs of degeneration, bestialization, and utter dementia; the story ends with her chilling resolution to the sleeping Pierre: “&quot;Je te tuerai avant&quot;” (I’ll kill you before that.)

==&quot;Erostratus&quot;==
A story about a misanthropic man who resolves to follow the path of Herostratus and make history by means of an evil deed—in this case, by killing six random people (one for each bullet in his revolver). The man is exhilarated by the sense of power he receives when carrying his revolver on the streets within his pocket. &quot;But I no longer drew assurance from that [the revolver], it was from myself: I was a being like a revolver, a torpedo or a bomb.&quot; Sartre gives the reader an insightful account about how a man&#x27;s nature changes with the objects of his possession, but the object itself is unable to change the internal man, as seen in the conclusion.

==&quot;&quot;Intimacy&quot;==
Young Lulu struggles with authenticity as she seeks to liberate herself from social stereotypes. She decides to leave her husband Henri and run off with her lover Pierre at the insistence of her friend Rirette. She goes through several stages of realisation as she sees that the roles of wife, friend, and even lover are meaningless. However, she does not have enough strength to use the resulting angst to become an authentic being, so she finally decides to remain with her husband.

==&quot;The Childhood of a Leader&quot;&quot;==
&quot;The Childhood of a Leader&quot; is the tale of the mental progress of a boy named Lucien Fleurier from around age 4 to his early adulthood. Lucien, the son of a rich industrialist, searches for identity and meaning in order to find out &quot;what&#x27;s wrong&quot; with him. He journeys from Freudian psychoanalysis and being a one-time sexual partner of a paederast poet, to finally becoming part of a Fascist youth organisation and attacking/punching a Jewish man who is reading &quot;l&#x27;Humanité&quot;, with his friends.

==Adaptations==
The 1967 film &quot;The Wall&quot; is based on the story of the same name.

The 2016 film &quot;The Childhood of a Leader&quot; is based on the story of the same name.</text><links>

<text>Cædwalla (; 659 – 20 April 689) was the King of Wessex from approximately 685 until he abdicated in 688. His name is derived from the Welsh Cadwallon. He was exiled from Wessex as a youth and during this period gathered forces and attacked the South Saxons, killing their king, Æthelwealh, in what is now Sussex. Cædwalla was unable to hold the South Saxon territory, however, and was driven out by Æthelwealh&#x27;s ealdormen. In either 685 or 686, he became King of Wessex. He may have been involved in suppressing rival dynasties at this time, as an early source records that Wessex was ruled by underkings until Cædwalla.

After his accession, Cædwalla returned to Sussex and won the territory again. He also conquered the Isle of Wight, gained control of Surrey and the kingdom of Kent, and in 686 he installed his brother Mul as king of Kent. Mul was burned in a Kentish revolt a year later, and Cædwalla returned, possibly ruling Kent directly for a period.

Cædwalla was wounded during the conquest of the Isle of Wight, and perhaps for this reason he abdicated in 688 to travel to Rome for baptism. He reached Rome in April 689 and was baptised by Pope Sergius I on the Saturday before Easter, dying ten days later on 20 April 689. He was succeeded by Ine.

== Sources ==
A major source for West Saxon events is the &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, written about 731 by Bede, a Northumbrian monk and chronicler. Bede received a good deal of information relating to Cædwalla from Bishop Daniel of Winchester; Bede&#x27;s interest was primarily in the Christianisation of the West Saxons, but in relating the history of the church he sheds much light on the West Saxons and Cædwalla. The contemporary &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot; or &quot;Life of St Wilfrid&quot; (by Stephen of Ripon, but often misattributed to Eddius Stephanus) also mentions Cædwalla. Another useful source is the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, a set of annals assembled in Wessex in the late 9th-century, probably at the direction of King Alfred the Great. Associated with the &quot;Chronicle&quot; is a list of kings and their reigns, known as the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List&quot;.&quot; There are also six surviving charters, though some are of doubtful authenticity. Charters were documents drawn up to record grants of land by kings to their followers or to the church and provide some of the earliest documentary sources in England.

== West Saxon territory in the 680s ==
In the late 7th century, the West Saxons occupied an area in the west of southern England, though the exact boundaries are difficult to define. To their west was the native British kingdom of Dumnonia, in what is now Devon and Cornwall. To the north were the Mercians, whose king, Wulfhere, had dominated southern England during his reign. In 674 he was succeeded by his brother, Æthelred, who was less militarily active than Wulfhere had been along the frontier with Wessex, though the West Saxons did not recover the territorial gains Wulfhere had made. To the southeast was the kingdom of the South Saxons, in what is now Sussex; and to the east were the East Saxons, who controlled London.

Not all the locations named in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; can be identified, but it is apparent that the West Saxons were fighting in north Somerset, south Gloucestershire, and north Wiltshire, against both British and Mercian opposition. To the west and south, evidence of the extent of West Saxon influence is provided by the fact that Cenwalh, who reigned from 642 to 673, is remembered as the first Saxon patron of Sherborne Abbey, in Dorset; similarly, Centwine (676–685) is the first Saxon patron of Glastonbury Abbey, in Somerset. Evidently, these monasteries were in West Saxon territory by then. Exeter, to the west, in Devon, was under West Saxon control by 680, since Boniface was educated there at about that time.

== Ancestry ==
A number of the early kings of Wessex had Celtic names, which may indicate Brythonic ancestry. Cædwalla&#x27;s name ultimately derives from the Proto-Celtic *&quot;Katu-welnā-mnos&quot;, meaning &quot;The One Who (-mnos) Leads (welnā-) into Battle (katu-)&quot;. However, the form &quot;Cædwalla&quot; appears to be a Saxon variant of &quot;Cadwallon&quot;, a contemporary Welsh name.

Bede states that Cædwalla was a &quot;daring young man of the royal house of the Gewissæ&quot;, and gives his age at his death in 689 as about thirty, making the year of his birth about 659. &quot;Gewisse&quot;, a tribal name, is used by Bede as an equivalent to &quot;West Saxon&quot;: the West Saxon genealogies trace back to one &quot;Gewis&quot;, an eponymous ancestor. According to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, Cædwalla was the son of Coenberht, and was descended via Ceawlin from Cerdic, the first of the Gewisse to land in England. However, it appears that the many difficulties and contradictions in the regnal list are caused partly by the efforts of later scribes to demonstrate that each king on the list was descended from Cerdic; thus Cædwalla&#x27;s genealogy must be treated with caution.

== First campaign in Sussex ==
The first mention of Cædwalla is in the &quot;Life of St Wilfrid,&quot; in which he is described as an exiled nobleman in the forests of Chiltern and Andred. It was not uncommon for a 7th-century king to have spent time in exile before gaining the throne; Oswald of Northumbria is another prominent example. According to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, it was in 685 that Cædwalla &quot;began to contend for the kingdom&quot;. Despite his exile, he was able to put together enough military force to defeat and kill Æthelwealh, the king of Sussex. He was, however, soon expelled by Berthun and Andhun, Æthelwealh&#x27;s ealdormen, &quot;who administered the country from then on&quot;, possibly as kings.

The Isle of Wight and the Meon valley in what is now eastern Hampshire had been placed under Æthelwealh&#x27;s control by Wulfhere; the &quot;Chronicle&quot; dates this to 661, but according to Bede it occurred &quot;not long before&quot; Wilfrid&#x27;s mission to the South Saxons in the 680s, which implies a rather later date. Wulfhere&#x27;s attack on Ashdown, also dated by the &quot;Chronicle&quot; to 661, may likewise have actually happened later. If these events happened in the early 680s or not long before, Cædwalla&#x27;s aggression against Æthelwealh would be explained as a response to Mercian pressure.

Another indication of the political and military situation may be the division in the 660s of the West Saxon see at Dorchester-on-Thames; a new see was established at Winchester, very near to the South Saxon border. Bede&#x27;s explanation for the division is that Cenwalh grew tired of the Frankish speech of the bishop at Dorchester, but it is more likely that it was a response to the Mercian advance, which forced West Saxon expansion, such as Cædwalla&#x27;s military activities, west, south, and east, rather than north. Cædwalla&#x27;s military successes may be the reason that at about this time the term &quot;West Saxon&quot; starts to be used in contemporary sources, instead of &quot;Gewisse&quot;. It is from this time that the West Saxons began to rule over other Anglo-Saxon peoples.

== Accession and reign ==
In 685 or 686, Cædwalla became king of the West Saxons after Centwine, his predecessor, retired to a monastery. Bede gives Cædwalla a reign of two years, ending in 688, but if his reign was less than three years then he may have come to the throne in 685. The &quot;West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List&quot; gives his reign a length of three years, with one variant reading of two years.

According to Bede, before Cædwalla&#x27;s reign, Wessex was ruled by underkings, who were conquered and removed when Cædwalla became king. This has been taken to mean that Cædwalla himself ended the reign of the underkings, though Bede does not directly say this. Bede gives the death of Cenwalh as the start of the ten-year period in which the West Saxons were ruled by these underkings; Cenwalh is now thought to have died in about 673, so this is slightly inconsistent with Cædwalla&#x27;s dates. It may be that Centwine, Cædwalla&#x27;s predecessor as king of the West Saxons, began as a co-ruler but established himself as sole king by the time Cædwalla became king. It may also be that the underkings were another dynastic faction of the West Saxon royal line, vying for power with Centwine and Cædwalla; the description of them as &quot;underkings&quot; may be due to a partisan description of the situation by Bishop Daniel of Winchester, who was Bede&#x27;s primary informant on West Saxon events. It is also possible that not all the underkings were deposed. There is a King Bealdred, who reigned in the area of Somerset and West Wiltshire, who is mentioned in two land-grants, one dated 681 and the other 688, though both documents have been treated as spurious by some historians. Further confusing the situation is another land-grant, thought to be genuine, showing Ine&#x27;s father, Cenred, still reigning in Wessex after Ine&#x27;s accession.

Once on the throne, Cædwalla attacked the South Saxons again, this time killing Berthun, and &quot;the province was reduced to a worse state of subjection&quot;. He also conquered the Isle of Wight, which was still an independent pagan kingdom, and set himself to kill every native on the island, resettling it with his own people, though Bede states that the natives remained a majority on the island. Arwald, the king of the Isle of Wight, left his two young brothers as heirs. They fled the island, but were found at Stoneham, in Hampshire, and killed on Cædwalla&#x27;s orders, though he was persuaded by a priest to let them be baptised before they were executed. Bede also mentions that Cædwalla was wounded; he was recovering from his wounds when the priest found him to ask permission to baptise the princes.

In a charter of 688, Cædwalla grants land at Farnham for a minster, so it is evident that Cædwalla controlled Surrey. He also invaded Kent, in 686, and may have founded a monastery at Hoo, northeast of Rochester, between the Medway and the Thames. He installed his brother, Mul, as king of Kent, in place of its king Eadric. In a subsequent Kentish revolt, Mul was &quot;burned&quot; along with twelve others, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. Cædwalla responded with a renewed campaign against Kent, laying waste to its land and leaving it in a state of chaos. He may have ruled Kent directly after this second invasion.

== Christianity ==
Cædwalla was unbaptised when he came to the throne of Wessex, and remained so throughout his reign, but though he is often referred to as a pagan this is not necessarily the most apt description; it may be that he was already Christian in his beliefs but delayed his baptism to a time of his choice. He was clearly respectful of the church, with charter evidence showing multiple grants to churches and for religious buildings. When Cædwalla first attacked the South Saxons, Wilfrid was at the court of King Æthelwealh, and on Æthelwealh&#x27;s death Wilfrid attached himself to Cædwalla; the &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; records that Cædwalla sought Wilfrid out as a spiritual father. Bede states that Cædwalla vowed to give a quarter of the Isle of Wight to the church if he conquered the island and that Wilfrid was the beneficiary when the vow was fulfilled; Bede also says that Cædwalla agreed to let the heirs of Arwald, the king of the Isle of Wight, be baptised before they were executed. Two of Cædwalla&#x27;s charters were grants of land to Wilfrid, and there is also subsequent evidence that Cædwalla worked with Wilfrid and Eorcenwald, a bishop of the East Saxons, to establish an ecclesiastical infrastructure for Sussex. However, there is no evidence that Wilfrid exerted any influence over Cædwalla&#x27;s secular activities or his campaigns.

Wilfrid&#x27;s association with Cædwalla may have benefited him in other ways: the &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; asserts that the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore, expressed a wish that Wilfrid succeed him in that role, and if this is true it may be a reflection of Wilfrid&#x27;s association with Cædwalla&#x27;s southern overlordship.

== Abdication, baptism and death ==
In 688, Cædwalla abdicated and went on a pilgrimage to Rome, possibly because he was dying of the wounds he had suffered while fighting on the Isle of Wight. Cædwalla had not been baptised, and Bede states that he wished to &quot;obtain the particular privilege of receiving the cleansing of baptism at the shrine of the blessed Apostles&quot;. He stopped in Francia at Samer, near Calais, where he gave money for the foundation of a church, and is also recorded at the court of Cunincpert, king of the Lombards, in what is now northern Italy. In Rome, he was baptised by Pope Sergius I on the Saturday before Easter (according to Bede) taking the baptismal name Peter, and died not long afterwards, &quot;still in his white garments&quot;. He was buried in St Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; agree that Cædwalla died on 20 April, but the latter says that he died seven days after his baptism, although the Saturday before Easter was on 10 April that year. The epitaph on his tomb described him as &quot;King of the Saxons&quot;.

Cædwalla&#x27;s departure in 688 appears to have led to instability in the south of England. Ine, Cædwalla&#x27;s successor, abdicated in 726, and the &quot;West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List&quot; says that he reigned for thirty-seven years, implying his reign began in 689 instead of 688. This could indicate an unsettled period between Cædwalla&#x27;s abdication and Ine&#x27;s accession. The kingship also changed in Kent in 688, with Oswine, who was apparently a Mercian client, taking the throne; and there is evidence of East Saxon influence in Kent in the years immediately following Cædwalla&#x27;s abdication.

In 694, Ine extracted compensation of 30,000 pence from the Kentishmen for the death of Mul; this amount represented the value of an aetheling&#x27;s life in the Saxon system of Weregild. Ine appears to have retained control of Surrey, but did not recover Kent. No king of Wessex was to venture so far east until Egbert, over a hundred years later.
