<text>A transverse mode of electromagnetic radiation is a particular electromagnetic field pattern of the radiation in the plane perpendicular (i.e., transverse) to the radiation&#x27;s propagation direction. Transverse modes occur in radio waves and microwaves confined to a waveguide, and also in light waves in an optical fiber and in a laser&#x27;s optical resonator.

Transverse modes occur because of boundary conditions imposed on the wave by the waveguide. For example, a radio wave in a hollow metal waveguide must have zero tangential electric field amplitude at the walls of the waveguide, so the transverse pattern of the electric field of waves is restricted to those that fit between the walls. For this reason, the modes supported by a waveguide are quantized. The allowed modes can be found by solving Maxwell&#x27;s equations for the boundary conditions of a given waveguide.

==Types of modes==
Unguided electromagnetic waves in free space, or in a bulk isotropic dielectric, can be described as a superposition of plane waves; these can be described as TEM modes as defined below.

However in any sort of waveguide where boundary conditions are imposed by a physical structure, a wave of a particular frequency can be described in terms of a transverse mode (or superposition of such modes). These modes generally follow different propagation constants. When two or more modes have an identical propagation constant along the waveguide, then there is more than one modal decomposition possible in order to describe a wave with that propagation constant (for instance, a non-central Gaussian laser mode can be equivalently described as a superposition of Hermite-Gaussian modes or Laguerre-Gaussian modes which are described below).

===Waveguides===

Modes in waveguides can be classified as follows:
; Transverse electromagnetic (TEM) modes: Neither electric nor magnetic field in the direction of propagation.
; Transverse electric (TE) modes: No electric field in the direction of propagation. These are sometimes called &quot;H modes&quot; because there is only a magnetic field along the direction of propagation (&quot;H&quot; is the conventional symbol for magnetic field).
; Transverse magnetic (TM) modes: No magnetic field in the direction of propagation. These are sometimes called &quot;E modes&quot; because there is only an electric field along the direction of propagation.
; Hybrid modes: Non-zero electric and magnetic fields in the direction of propagation. &quot;See also &quot;.

====Conductor-based transmission lines====
In coaxial cable energy is normally transported in the fundamental TEM mode. The TEM mode is also usually assumed for most other electrical conductor line formats as well. This is mostly an accurate assumption, but a major exception is microstrip which has a significant longitudinal component to the propagated wave due to the inhomogeneity at the boundary of the dielectric substrate below the conductor and the air above it.
Inhomogeneity also occurs at connectors or bends in a coaxial cable. Non-TEM modes created by connectors are usually negligible unless the signal has a high enough frequency. This is referred to as maximum extraneous-mode-free operation or simply mode-free operation frequency of the connector.

In an optical fiber or other dielectric waveguide, modes are generally of the hybrid type.

====Waveguides====
Hollow metallic waveguides filled with a homogeneous, isotropic material (usually air) support TE and TM modes but not the TEM mode.
In rectangular waveguides, rectangular mode numbers are designated by two suffix numbers attached to the mode type, such as TE&quot;mn&quot; or TM&quot;mn&quot;, where &quot;m&quot; is the number of half-wave patterns across the width of the waveguide and &quot;n&quot; is the number of half-wave patterns across the height of the waveguide. In circular waveguides, circular modes exist and here &quot;m&quot; is the number of full-wave patterns along the circumference and &quot;n&quot; is the number of half-wave patterns along the diameter.

====Optical fibers====
The number of modes in an optical fiber distinguishes multi-mode optical fiber from single-mode optical fiber. To determine the number of modes in a step-index fiber, the V number needs to be determined: formula_1 where formula_2 is the wavenumber, formula_3 is the fiber&#x27;s core radius, and formula_4 and formula_5 are the refractive indices of the core and cladding, respectively. Fiber with a V-parameter of less than 2.405 only supports the fundamental mode (a hybrid mode), and is therefore a single-mode fiber whereas fiber with a higher V-parameter has multiple modes.

Decomposition of field distributions into modes is useful because a large number of field amplitudes readings can be simplified into a much smaller number of mode amplitudes. Because these modes change over time according to a simple set of rules, it is also possible to anticipate future behavior of the field distribution. These simplifications of complex field distributions ease the signal processing requirements of fiber-optic communication systems.

The modes in typical low refractive index contrast fibers are usually referred to as &quot;LP&quot; (linear polarization) modes, which refers to a scalar approximation for the field solution, treating it as if it contains only one transverse field component.

===Lasers===

In a laser with cylindrical symmetry, the transverse mode patterns are described by a combination of a Gaussian beam profile with a Laguerre polynomial. The modes are denoted where and are integers labeling the radial and angular mode orders, respectively. The intensity at a point (in polar coordinates) from the centre of the mode is given by:
formula_6
where , is the associated Laguerre polynomial of order and index , and is the spot size of the mode corresponding to the Gaussian beam radius.

With , the TEM00 mode is the lowest order. It is the fundamental transverse mode of the laser resonator and has the same form as a Gaussian beam. The pattern has a single lobe, and has a constant phase across the mode. Modes with increasing show concentric rings of intensity, and modes with increasing show angularly distributed lobes. In general there are spots in the mode pattern (except for ). The mode, the so-called &quot;doughnut mode&quot;, is a special case consisting of a superposition of two modes (), rotated with respect to one another.

The overall size of the mode is determined by the Gaussian beam radius , and this may increase or decrease with the propagation of the beam, however the modes preserve their general shape during propagation. Higher order modes are relatively larger compared to the mode, and thus the fundamental Gaussian mode of a laser may be selected by placing an appropriately sized aperture in the laser cavity.

In many lasers, the symmetry of the optical resonator is restricted by polarizing elements such as Brewster&#x27;s angle windows. In these lasers, transverse modes with rectangular symmetry are formed. These modes are designated with and being the horizontal and vertical orders of the pattern. The electric field pattern at a point for a beam propagating along the z-axis is given by
formula_7
where formula_8, formula_9, formula_10, and formula_11 are the waist, spot size, radius of curvature, and Gouy phase shift as given for a Gaussian beam; formula_12 is a normalization constant; and formula_13 is the -th physicist&#x27;s Hermite polynomial. The corresponding intensity pattern is
formula_14

The TEM00 mode corresponds to exactly the same fundamental mode as in the cylindrical geometry. Modes with increasing and show lobes appearing in the horizontal and vertical directions, with in general lobes present in the pattern. As before, higher-order modes have a larger spatial extent than the 00 mode.

The phase of each lobe of a is offset by radians with respect to its horizontal or vertical neighbours. This is equivalent to the polarization of each lobe being flipped in direction.

The overall intensity profile of a laser&#x27;s output may be made up from the superposition of any of the allowed transverse modes of the laser&#x27;s cavity, though often it is desirable to operate only on the fundamental mode.

<text>Crypto.com Arena (stylized as crypto.com Arena; originally and colloquially known as Staples Center) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in downtown Los Angeles. Opened on October 17, 1999, as Staples Center, it is located next to the Los Angeles Convention Center complex along Figueroa Street, and has since been considered a part of L.A. Live. Owned and operated by Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), it is the home venue of the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL)—which are both owned in part by AEG&#x27;s founder Philip Anschutz, as well as the WNBA&#x27;s Los Angeles Sparks.

The Los Angeles Clippers of the NBA also played in the arena from 1999 to 2024, before leaving for their new arena, Intuit Dome, located in Inglewood.

From 1999 to 2024, it was the only arena in the NBA shared by two teams, as well as one of only three North American professional sports venues (alongside SoFi Stadium in nearby Inglewood, and New Jersey&#x27;s MetLife Stadium) to have hosted two teams from the same league. The venue is also frequently used for major concerts, and has been the most frequent host of the Grammy Awards ceremony since its opening.

Crypto.com Arena will host the gymnastics competition during the 2028 Summer Olympics.

==Description==
Crypto.com Arena has of total space, with a by arena floor. It stands tall. The arena seats up to 19,067 for basketball, 18,145 for ice hockey, and around 20,000 for concerts or other sporting events. Two-thirds of the arena&#x27;s seating, including 2,500 club seats, are in the lower bowl. There are also 160 luxury suites, including 15 event suites, on three levels between the lower and upper bowls. The arena&#x27;s attendance record is held by the fight between World WBA Welterweight Champion Antonio Margarito and Shane Mosley with a crowd of 20,820, set on January 25, 2009.

=== Star Plaza ===

Outside the arena at the Star Plaza are 13 statues of famous Los Angeles athletes and broadcasters. Additionally, the Los Angeles Kings Monument was erected in Star Plaza in 2016. The Kobe and Gianna Bryant Memorial Statue was erected in 2024. A third statue of Kobe Bryant, honoring his number 24, is planned. In November 2024, the Lakers announced plans to honor former player and coach Pat Riley with a statue in Star Plaza.

Following is a list of statues on display:

==History==

The arena has been referred to as &quot;the deal that almost wasn&#x27;t.&quot; Long before construction broke ground, plans for the arena were negotiated between elected city officials and real estate developers Edward P. Roski of Majestic Realty and Philip Anschutz. Roski and Anschutz had acquired the Los Angeles Kings in 1995 and in 1996 began looking for a new home for their team, which then played at the Forum in Inglewood.

Majestic Realty Co. and AEG were scouring the Los Angeles area for available land to develop an arena when they were approached by Steve Soboroff, then president of the LA Recreation and Parks Commission. Soboroff requested that they consider building the arena in downtown Los Angeles adjacent to the convention center. This proposal intrigued Roski and Anschutz, and soon a plan to develop the arena was devised.

Months of negotiations ensued between Anschutz and city officials, with Roski and John Semcken of Majestic Realty Co. spearheading the negotiations for the real estate developers. The negotiations grew contentious at times and the real estate developers threatened to pull out altogether on more than one occasion. The main opposition came from Councilman Joel Wachs, who opposed utilizing public funds to subsidize the proposed project, and councilwoman Rita Walters, who objected to parts of it.

Ultimately, the developers and city leaders reached an agreement, and in 1997, construction broke ground on the new building, which opened two years later. It was financed privately at a cost of US$375 million and was named for the office-supply company Staples, Inc., which was one of the center&#x27;s corporate sponsors that paid for naming rights. Staples&#x27; 20-year naming rights deal was renewed in 2009. The arena opened on October 17, 1999, with a Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band concert as its inaugural event.

On October 21, 2009, the arena celebrated its tenth anniversary. To commemorate the occasion, the venue&#x27;s official web site nominated 25 of the arena&#x27;s greatest moments from its first ten years with fans voting on the top ten.

The Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football League (AFL) and the South Bay Lakers of the NBA G League were also tenants of Staples Center; the Avengers folded in 2009, and the D-Fenders moved to the Lakers&#x27; practice facility at the Toyota Sports Center in El Segundo, California for the 2011–12 season.

During the 2010 NBA and NHL offseason, the arena was renovated with refurbished locker rooms for the Lakers, Kings, and Clippers, and the installation of a new US$10 million HD center-hung video scoreboard and jumbotron, replacing the original one that had been in place since the building opened in 1999. The Panasonic Live 4HD scoreboard was officially unveiled on September 22, 2010, as AEG and Staples Center executives, as well as player representatives from the Lakers (Sasha Vujacic), Clippers (Craig Smith), and Kings (Matt Greene) were on hand for the presentation.

On January 15, 2018, in the aftermath of an NBA basketball game between the Houston Rockets and the Los Angeles Clippers, point guard Chris Paul utilized a secret tunnel (connecting the away team&#x27;s locker room to the backdoor of the Clippers locker room) to confront former Clipper teammates Austin Rivers and Blake Griffin. Paul was joined by teammates Trevor Ariza, James Harden, and Gerald Green to confront the opponents, which only resulted in verbal altercations.

Following the death of Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna, and seven others in a helicopter crash in January 2020, a number of media outlets picked up on a phrase used by some, referring to the arena as &quot;The House That Kobe Built&quot;, due to his historic 20-year career with the Lakers. On August 24, 2020, Los Angeles City Council president Herb Wesson announced a proposal to rename the stretch of Figueroa Street around Staples Center to &quot;Kobe Bryant Boulevard&quot;.

In September 2021, the Clippers broke ground on a new arena in Inglewood, California, known as Intuit Dome, which became its new home arena in 2024.

On November 16, 2021, it was announced that the naming rights to Staples Center had been acquired by Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com, renaming it Crypto.com Arena effective December 25, 2021 (with the changeover coinciding with the Lakers&#x27; nationally televised Christmas Day game). The deal was reported to be valued at $700 million over 20 years, in comparison to the $116 million paid by Staples under its previous 20-year agreement—making it the most valuable naming rights contract in all of sports. The name change was met with opposition and many fans still refer to this arena as Staples Center.
In 2022, the arena began to undergo a multi-phase renovation, expected to be completed in 2024; the first phase over the 2022 NBA and NHL offseason included new video boards and ribbon displays, and updated concessions. There are plans for the City View Terrace to be converted into an indoor outdoor deck, a new area known as the Tunnel Club, Chick Hearn Court to be converted into a pedestrian plaza between the arena and the rest of L.A. Live, and updated player facilities such as locker rooms.

==Events==

===Music===
Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band were the first act to perform at the venue on its opening in 1999. Dave Matthews Band famously played the venue twice in 2008, despite the first show being the day of founding member and saxophonist LeRoi Moore&#x27;s death.

After the American singer Michael Jackson died in 2009, a televised memorial service was held at the arena. Its operator, AEG, had promoted the This Is It concert residency that Jackson had been scheduled to perform at The O2 Arena in London. Jackson had been rehearsing at the arena in the weeks prior to his death; he last had rehearsed there approximately 12 hours before his death (on the same day).

It hosted the 1st Annual Latin Grammy Awards in 2000 and the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. In 2011, Jenni Rivera became the first female regional Mexican musician to perform a sell-out at the arena.

Taylor Swift has performed 16 sellouts at Crypto.com Arena—the most of any performer at the venue. On August 21, 2015, prior to one of her performances on the 1989 Tour, Kobe Bryant presented Swift with a banner commemorating this achievement, which was hung in the arena&#x27;s rafters. The Taylor Swift banner, however, became the subject of a curse among Lakers and Kings fans, who suspected that the banner was contributing to their teams&#x27; respective playoff droughts. Eventually, the Kings began to hide the Taylor Swift banner during home games, and the banner was taken down entirely in December 2020.

Mexican musicians Gloria Trevi and Alejandra Guzmán played two sellout shows at the arena in 2017. Rapper Nipsey Hussle&#x27;s memorial service was held at the venue on April 11, 2019. As part of Super Bowl LVI festivities, the arena hosted the &quot;Super Bowl Music Fest&quot; in February 2022, headlined by Halsey, Machine Gun Kelly, Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, Miley Cyrus, and Green Day.

====Grammy Awards====
The annual Grammy Awards ceremony has been held at Crypto.com Arena since 2000, with the exception of 2003, 2018, 2021 and 2022. As of 2025, the venue has hosted the Grammy Awards 22 times, hosting more than any other venue in the history of the Grammy Awards.

==== KCON ====
The arena hosted the concert portion of the US legs of KCON 2022 and 2024, held from 20–21 August 2022 and 26–28 July 2024, respectively.

===Sports===
The venue opened in 1999 as the home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers (NBA), and Los Angeles Kings of the NHL. The Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA joined in 2001, while the Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA D-League joined in 2006. It became home to the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football League in 2000 until the team&#x27;s discontinuation in 2009.

On June 21, 2003, the arena hosted the boxing event Lennox Lewis vs. Vitali Klitschko, which was Lennox Lewis&#x27; final title defense before retiring. Klitschko was leading on the scorecards however the fight ended as a 6th-round TKO due to a sustained cut over Klitschko&#x27;s eye.

Since its opening day, the arena has hosted seven NBA Finals series with the Lakers, the 2012 and 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, three WNBA Finals, the 2002 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, the 52nd and 62nd NHL All-Star game, three NBA All-Star Games (2004, 2011 and 2018), the Pac-10 Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament (2002–12), the WTA Tour Championships (2002–05), UFC 60 in 2006, UFC 104 in 2009, UFC 184 in 2015, UFC 227 in 2018, the 2009 World Figure Skating Championships, the Summer X Games indoor competitions (2003–13), and several HBO Championship Boxing matches.
On January 22, 2006, Los Angeles Lakers player Kobe Bryant scored a career-high 81 points in the Crypto.com Arena against the Toronto Raptors, the second-highest number of points scored in a single game in NBA history, second only to Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s 100-point performance. Of the team&#x27;s six NBA championships since moving to the venue, the Lakers have celebrated their and victories at Crypto.com Arena with series-winning victories at home.

Prior to the 2006–07 NBA season, the lighting inside the arena was modified for Lakers games. The lights were focused only on the court itself (hence the promotional &quot;Lights Out&quot; campaign), reminiscent of the Lakers&#x27; early years at The Forum. The initial fan reaction was positive and has been a fixture on home games since. The Daktronics see-through shot clock was first installed prior to the 2008–09 NBA season. The Clippers adopted the new see-through shot clock prior to the 2010–11 NBA season. For Sparks games, the court used is named after Sparks player Lisa Leslie, and was officially named prior to the 2009 home opener against the Shock on June 23, 2006.

The Los Angeles Kings hosted the 2010 NHL Entry Draft at the arena in June 2010. In 2012, the Clippers, Kings, and Lakers all advanced to their leagues&#x27; respective playoffs, with the Kings ultimately playing their first Stanley Cup Finals at the arena; on June 11, the Kings defeated the New Jersey Devils in Game 6 to win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history.

The Lakers unveiled a new hardwood court before their preseason game on October 13, 2012. Taking a cue from soccer clubs, the primary center court logo was adorned with 16 stars, representing the first 16 championships the Lakers franchise had won. A 17th star was added to the court and unveiled before their regular season opener on December 22, 2020, to represent the franchise winning its 17th championship in the 2020 NBA Finals.
Crypto.com Arena has hosted the following championship events:
*NBA Finals:
**: On June 19, 2000, the Lakers defeated the Indiana Pacers 116–111 in game 6, which took place at home, to win their twelfth championship title. This was also notable for being their first championship since .

<text>Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre is a London performing arts venue, located in Rosebery Avenue, Islington. The present-day theatre is the sixth on the site. Sadler&#x27;s Wells grew out of a late 17th-century pleasure garden and was opened as a theatre building in the 1680s. 

Lacking the requisite licence to perform straight drama, the house became known for dancing, performing animals, pantomime, and spectacular entertainments such as sea battles in a huge water tank on the stage. In the mid-19th century, when the law was changed to remove restrictions on staging drama, Sadler&#x27;s Wells became celebrated for the seasons of plays by Shakespeare and others presented by Samuel Phelps between 1844 and 1862. From then until the early 20th century the theatre had mixed fortunes, eventually becoming abandoned and derelict.

The philanthropist and theatre owner Lilian Baylis bought and rebuilt the theatre in 1926. Together with Baylis&#x27;s Old Vic, Sadler&#x27;s Wells became home to dance, drama and opera companies that developed into the Royal Ballet, the National Theatre and English National Opera. From the 1930s to the 1980s the theatre was home to 21 London seasons by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company; from the 1950s to the 1970s the English Opera Group, founded by Benjamin Britten, had its London base at Sadler&#x27;s Wells; and between the 1950s and 1980s the Handel Opera Society staged productions there. Visiting dance troupes included the Alvin Ailey and Merce Cunningham companies, the Dance Theatre of Harlem, London Contemporary Dance Theatre and the Ballet Rambert.

The current theatre dates from 1998. It consists of two performance spaces: a 1,500-seat main auditorium and the Lilian Baylis Studio, with extensive rehearsal rooms and technical facilities also housed within the site. Sadler&#x27;s Wells is now chiefly known as a dance venue. As well as hosting visiting companies, the theatre is also a producing house, with associated artists and companies who create original works for the theatre. Sadler&#x27;s Wells maintains an additional base at the Peacock Theatre in the West End as well as opening a new theatre, Sadler&#x27;s Wells East Theatre, in Stratford, London in 2025. 

==History==
===First theatre: 1683–1765===
Details of the origins of Sadler&#x27;s Wells are disputed. According to Dennis Arundell in his history of the theatre, its founder was called Dick Sadler. Many other sources, from the 18th century onwards, say the same, but others give Sadler the forename Thomas, and according to the Survey of London he was Edward. It is also uncertain when Sadler established his auditorium: many sources give the year as 1683; others give it as 1684 or 1685. According to Arundell, Sadler had already opened his &quot;Musick-House&quot; at an unspecified date before 1683; a history of the house published in 1847 confines itself to saying that the house was built at some time after the creation of the adjoining New River in 1614.

A well with water from a mineral spring was discovered on Sadler&#x27;s land in Islington, near the boundary with Clerkenwell. After an eminent physician tested the water and praised its supposed health-giving properties, Sadler found two more wells nearby. Taking the waters was fashionable at the time – there were popular spas at Bath, Tunbridge and Epsom – and Sadler started marketing the water from his wells. Visitors to the Musick-House began to drink it, and many London physicians recommended their patients to do so. By the end of the summer of 1685 five or six hundred people frequented the Musick-House every morning for the water. Sadler laid out ornamental gardens and engaged entertainers to amuse his patrons: there were tumblers, rope-dancers and musicians. Sadler took as his business partner a violinist, Francis Forcer, who was both dancing-master and composer. 

The initial popularity of Sadler&#x27;s spa did not last long, and by 1691 it had ceased to be a fashionable resort. He sold two of his wells, and the original one dried up for a time; his entertainments became the main draw for those of the public still interested. There is no documentary proof, but Arundell conjectures that by 1697 Sadler had either died or retired; Forcer went into partnership with a glover, James Miles, and the wooden auditorium was renamed &quot;Miles&#x27;s Musick-House&quot;. Under their management the public could hear ballad singers and see jugglers, wrestlers, fighters, dancing dogs and, according to the theatre&#x27;s 21st-century historian, &quot;even a singing duck&quot;.

In the early years of the 18th century the reputation of the spa declined. By the time Hogarth produced his Four Times of the Day series in 1736, the theatre had lost any vestiges of fashionability and was satirised as having an audience consisting of tradesmen and their pretentious wives. Ned Ward described the clientele in 1699 as:

The proprietors advertised for a new manager in 1700, but the decline continued. In 1711, after its fashionable clients had taken their trade elsewhere, Sadler&#x27;s Wells was described in &quot;The Inquisitor&quot; as &quot;a nursery of debauchery&quot;, and the place was frequented by many &quot;unaccountable and disorderly&quot; people. In 1712 a man called French was sentenced to death at the Old Bailey for killing a Mr Thwaits at Sadler&#x27;s Wells.

Miles died in 1724, and under Forcer&#x27;s son the auditorium was &quot;entirely new modelled and made every way more commodious than heretofore for the better reception of company&quot;. Forcer junior sought to improve standards – according to one historian he &quot;succeeded, to a great degree,&quot; in driving away &quot;the mass of incomprehensible vagabonds&quot; – but after his death in 1743 John Warren took over, and standards fell again, to the extent that the authorities closed the place. The lease was acquired by Thomas Rosoman and Peter Hough, who reopened Sadler&#x27;s Wells in April 1746. According to Arundell they &quot;thereby started twenty years&#x27; prosperity for the old wooden theatre&quot;. Rosoman substantially reconstructed the wooden building in 1748–49.

Rosoman engaged a regular resident company of actors, and the old Musick-House became a theatre. Rosoman introduced burlettas, at that time a genre new to England. According to the current laws, only the two patent companies were permitted to present non-musical dramas. Sadler&#x27;s Wells and other theatres were obliged by the Minor Theatres Act (1751) to avoid spoken dialogue. To circumvent this rule, theatre managers had their actors speaking against a continuous background of instrumental music, so that it was passed off as a musical entertainment. In general the authorities did not enforce the letter of the law with particular rigour. &quot;The Tempest&quot; was performed there in 1764, but Arundell suggests it was not Shakespeare&#x27;s original, but &quot;Garrick&#x27;s version of the Dryden-Shakespeare-Purcell work castrated into an opera&quot;.

In 1763 Rosoman engaged the dancers from the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. This suited both theatres, as at that time Sadler&#x27;s Wells customarily opened from late spring to early autumn and the patent theatres were open for the other half of the year. Arundell comments that this engagement added to the prestige of Sadler&#x27;s Wells &quot;and ultimately benefited the place enormously, for the new Ballet Master was Giuseppe Grimaldi&quot;. (Grimaldi&#x27;s son, Joseph, later became one of Sadler&#x27;s Wells&#x27;s star attractions.) Rosoman prospered and in the summer of 1764 he announced that Sadler&#x27;s Wells would be pulled down at the end of the season and rebuilt &quot;in a most elegant manner&quot;.

===Second theatre: 1765–1802 ===
Rosoman was a builder by trade, and he had the wooden theatre replaced with a brick structure. The new building was completed in seven weeks, and cost £4,225; it opened in April 1765. The new house was well received: a London newspaper reported, &quot;Sadler&#x27;s Wells is now rebuilt and considerably enlarged; each of the entrances is decorated with an elegant iron gate and pallisades [with] a degree of splendor and magnificence ... that do equal honour to the taste and liberality of the Proprietor&quot;.

In 1771 Rosoman retired. He sold his three-quarter share in the theatre to Thomas King, a friend and Drury Lane colleague of Garrick. King took over the management from December 1771, and continued to offer entertainments of the traditional variety – tumblers, singers, acrobats and &quot;Several surprising and pleasing Performances by Messrs Sigels, lately arrived from Paris&quot;. Although his own tastes favoured the dramatic, King catered for the tastes of his audiences, and in particular featured pantomimes, establishing the theatre as a rival to the Theatre Royal, Haymarket in that genre. His shows, with music by Charles Dibdin, included such pieces as &quot;Vineyard Revels, or, The Harlequin Bacchanal&quot;, and &quot;The Whim-Wham, or, Harlequin Captive&quot;. In 1781 Joseph Grimaldi made his debut, aged two, dancing with his sister.

In the 1790s Dibdin was stage manager as well as composer, with Grimaldi as comic star. The theatre was by now in need of renovation, not least because of concerns about safety. The proprietors, led by William Siddons, husband of Sarah Siddons, proposed &quot;an Entire new inside&quot; so that &quot;the Building will be a stable one for fifty years to come&quot;.

===Third theatre: 1802–1879===

Sadler&#x27;s Wells reopened in 1802 with an interior &quot;entirely re-built at an immense Expence&quot;. In 1804 it acquired a new attraction, dubbed the Aqua-show. A huge water tank was installed under the stage for the production of aquatic spectacles. This tank and a second, above the stage to provide waterfall effects, were supplied with water from the New River alongside the theatre. The historian Shirley S. Allen writes that such was the remarkable realism in the performance of sea stories that Sadler&#x27;s Wells became for thirty years the home of the &quot;nautical drama&quot;. Grimaldi, by the early 19th century established as &quot;the unchallenged king of clowns&quot;, continued as the theatre&#x27;s principal clown until 1820, while pursuing a parallel career at Drury Lane.

The law restricting non-musical drama to the two patent theatres was repealed by the Theatres Act 1843, and the following year serious drama came to Sadler&#x27;s Wells. From 1844 to 1862 the actor Samuel Phelps managed and starred at the theatre. He intended to bring Shakespeare to the masses. Sadler&#x27;s Wells at this stage had a largely local Islington audience, working class and relatively uneducated; economically the theatre had its advantages: a large capacity (2,500) and a low rent. 
Phelps believed that the theatre should be a &quot;place for justly representing the works of our great dramatic poets&quot;, particularly since the leading London theatres were not presenting &quot;the real drama of England&quot;. His biographer J. P. Wearing writes:

Among the leading players in Phelps&#x27;s company were Laura Addison, George Bennett, Fanny Cooper and Isabella Glyn; Phelps starred in roles from Hamlet to Falstaff. His productions purged Shakespeare&#x27;s texts of 18th-century alterations and additions, and he presented the plays with attention to period detail and dramatic veracity. The theatre began to attract audiences from beyond Islington, including literary figures such as Charles Dickens and John Forster.

After Phelps&#x27;s withdrawal in 1862 the theatre presented a variety of shows, but despite appearances by stars such as J. L. Toole, Hermann Vezin and the young Nellie Farren, they made little impact. A succession of managements tried unsuccessfully to make the theatre pay; in 1874 it closed, and there were plans to turn it into baths and washhouses. The building, by that time in a perilous state of repair, was used as a roller-skating rink and for lectures, boxing and wrestling, until in August 1878 Sidney Bateman, who had been running the Lyceum Theatre in the West End, bought the unexpired thirty-three year term of the lease of Sadler&#x27;s Wells.

===Fourth theatre: 1879–1915===

Bateman commissioned C. J. Phipps to design a new interior for the theatre, which reopened in October 1879. Phipps remodelled the auditorium, with a stronger horseshoe profile for the front of the dress circle and the gallery above. These extended further toward the stage than the previous circle and gallery, increasing the theatre&#x27;s capacity. The theatrical newspaper &quot;The Era&quot; reported, &quot;The changes made are so remarkable that Sadler&#x27;s Wells may now claim to be one of the largest and most conveniently-constructed London Theatres&quot;. By this time Islington was no longer an isolated village but an inner suburb of the capital, and &quot;The Era&quot; remarked, &quot;no part of London can be reached with greater facility, as omnibuses, trams, &amp;c, from various directions pass the Angel, not two hundred yards from Sadler&#x27;s Wells.&quot;

Bateman hoped to restore the theatre&#x27;s reputation as a classical playhouse, as in Phelps&#x27;s time, but she died in 1881. The historian Philip Temple quotes an earlier writer&#x27;s comment that despite Bateman&#x27;s improvements, &quot;in the 1880s the Saturday night gallery contained the most villainous, desperate, hatchet-faced assembly of ruffians to be found in all London&quot;. There were several attempts to convert the theatre into a music hall, but the authorities refused to license it.

The only major changes to Phipps&#x27;s building was the addition by the architect Bertie Crewe of a new portico in 1894, aligned to the newly completed Rosebery Avenue. In the early years of the 20th century the theatre doubled as a cinema, showing films on Sundays, with live shows – described as &quot;cowboy melodramas&quot; – during the week, but it did not prosper. The drama critic of &quot;The Daily Chronicle&quot; wrote in February 1914, &quot;Poor wounded old playhouse! Here it stands even now, shabby and disconsolate, its once familiar frontage half hidden with glaring posters&quot;.

With the support of leading theatre figures including Bernard Shaw, Arthur Wing Pinero and Seymour Hicks, a plan was put forward in 1914 for saving the building and turning it into &quot;a people&#x27;s theatre&quot;. The outbreak of the First World War led to the abandonment of the plan, and Sadler&#x27;s Wells declined into dereliction. It closed in 1915 and did not reopen after the war.

===Fifth theatre: 1931–1998===

Since 1914 the theatre proprietor and philanthropist Lilian Baylis had run drama and opera companies at her south London theatre, the Old Vic, with cheap prices aimed at attracting a local, working-class audience. In 1925 she began a campaign to reopen the derelict Sadler&#x27;s Wells on a similar basis. She raised the necessary funds and the new theatre was designed by F.G.M. Chancellor, who had succeeded Frank Matcham as senior partner of Matcham and Co..

The new theatre opened with a gala performance on 6 January 1931 of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; starring John Gielgud as Malvolio and Ralph Richardson as Toby Belch. Acquiring Sadler&#x27;s Wells enabled Baylis to set up a dance company, something she had wished to do since 1926 when she engaged Ninette de Valois to improve the standard of dancing in operas and plays at the Old Vic. The three companies Baylis founded developed over the next three decades to become the Royal Ballet, the National Theatre and English National Opera.

For the first few years the opera, drama and ballet companies, known as the &quot;Vic-Wells&quot; companies, moved between the Old Vic and Sadler&#x27;s Wells but by 1935 the established pattern was drama at the former and opera and ballet at the latter. In 1935 both the opera and ballet companies went on summer tours for the first time. In their absence the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company took the theatre for a season of Gilbert and Sullivan, the first of 21 such London seasons at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, returning in every decade until the 1980s.

After Baylis died in 1937 the Vic-Wells Ballet was led by de Valois and the opera company was under the direction of Tyrone Guthrie. In the Second World War the government requisitioned Sadler&#x27;s Wells as a refuge for those made homeless by air-raids. The two companies toured for the duration of the war. When the theatre reopened in 1945 the companies were briefly reunited there, but de Valois objected to Guthrie&#x27;s treatment of her company as the junior partner, more valued for financial than for artistic reasons. She accepted an invitation from David Webster to base her main ballet company at the reopened Covent Garden, opening there in 1946, leaving Sadler&#x27;s Wells with a small company known as the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre Ballet. The previous year the theatre had hosted the world premiere of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; and over the next twenty years the opera company gave British premieres of works by Verdi, Janáček, Stravinsky, Weill and others. Britten&#x27;s ensemble the English Opera Group had London seasons at Sadler&#x27;s Wells between 1954 and 1975. From 1959 to 1985 the theatre was the main venue for the annual seasons of the Handel Opera Society.

In the 1960s there were plans for a new opera house on the South Bank; Norman Tucker and his successor, Stephen Arlen, the directors of Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera, hoped to relocate the company there. The plans fell through when the government declined to contribute to the capital cost of the proposed building, but Arlen remained convinced that Sadler&#x27;s Wells was too small for productions of large-scale works such as Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, and in 1968 the company left Sadler&#x27;s Wells and moved to the London Coliseum. Sadler&#x27;s Wells turned to dance as its main focus. By the 1970s, the historian Sarah Crompton records, the dance programme of Sadler&#x27;s Wells had diversified considerably. Among the companies appearing there were the Ballet Rambert and London Contemporary Dance Theatre, who both held residencies there, and visiting ensembles including those of Alvin Ailey and Merce Cunningham, Nederlands Dans Theater and the Dance Theatre of Harlem. 

After the opera company moved out, Sadler&#x27;s Wells hosted operatic productions by, among others, Cologne Opera (1969) and the Camden Festival (1972). In 1983 a new opera company was established, with its base at Sadler&#x27;s Wells. With a four-year sponsorship from the National Westminster Bank, the New Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera company focused on operetta, sung in English, in London and on tour. The first season opened with Lehar&#x27;s &quot;The Count of Luxembourg&quot;, followed by Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot; and Kálmán&#x27;s &quot;Countess Maritza&quot;. Later productions included Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;Ruddigore&quot; and &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;La belle Hélène&quot;, Lehár&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; and Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot;. Most of these productions were commercially recorded and released on LP and CD. After the sponsorship ended, costs outstripped income, and the opera company – though not the theatre – went into liquidation with heavy debts in 1989.

In 1994 a new chief executive, Ian Albery, led a campaign to transform Sadler&#x27;s Wells into a purpose-built dance theatre. During the two-year rebuilding, Sadler&#x27;s Wells moved temporarily to the Peacock Theatre in the West End, where it has maintained a presence ever since.

===Sixth theatre: 1998–===
The new theatre was designed by the Arts Team division of the architects RHWL. It opened in October 1998 with a design that incorporates the skeleton of the 1931 Chancellor theatre (which itself contained bricks from the Victorian structure). It has an expanded 15 m2 sprung stage, a 1,500-seat auditorium, three rehearsal studios and the smaller 200-seat Lilian Baylis studio theatre for the development and presentation of small-scale work. The current building retains the Grade II listing applied to the Matcham theatre in 1950.

The opening season included performances by Pina Bausch&#x27;s Tanztheater Wuppertal, William Forsythe&#x27;s Ballett Frankfurt, and Rambert Dance. Operatic productions at the new house have included seasons by the Royal Opera (1999), Welsh National Opera (1999 and 2001), Polish National Opera (2004), Glyndebourne Touring Opera (2007) and English Touring Opera (2010). 

In 2004 a new director, Alistair Spalding, concluded that Sadler&#x27;s Wells &quot;had been at its best when it had had resident companies and new works being created within its walls&quot;. He announced:

In accordance with this policy Sadler&#x27;s Wells has appointed an increasing number of choreographers and other associate artists and has commissioned and produced new work. In 2004 Breakin&#x27; Convention joined Sadler&#x27;s Wells, &quot;representing the origins and evolution of hip hop culture through performance and education.&quot; The theatre now claims to create and share more new work than any other dance organisation in the world. In the 2020s the theatre has been criticised for its sponsorship by Barclays Bank, which some campaigners associate with investment damaging to the environment.

==Sadler&#x27;s Wells East==
In June 2018 Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, announced an additional venue Sadler&#x27;s Wells East Theatre as part of the East Bank project in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Stratford, London and to open in February 2025.

==In popular culture==
* Lorna Hill wrote a series of children&#x27;s fiction in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, starting with &#x27;A Dream of Sadlers Wells&#x27; (1950), which featured teenage girls learning ballet at Sadler&#x27;s Wells.
* The play &quot;Trelawny of the &quot;Wells&quot;&quot; (1898) is set at a theatre named Barridge Wells, based on Sadler&#x27;s Wells. Two of the characters in the play are modelled on the actress Alice Marriott, co-manager of Sadler&#x27;s Wells in the 1860s.

<text>Mason Locke Weems (October 11, 1759 – May 23, 1825), usually referred to as Parson Weems, was an American minister, evangelical bookseller and author who wrote (and rewrote and republished) the first biography of George Washington immediately after his death. Some popular stories about Washington thought during the 20th century to be apocryphal can be traced to Weems, including the cherry tree tale (&quot;I cannot tell a lie, I did it with my little hatchet&quot;). Weems&#x27; biography of Washington was a bestseller that depicted Washington&#x27;s virtues and was intended to provide morally instructive tales for the youth of the young nation.

==Early life==

Mason Weems was born on October 11, 1759, in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, the youngest of nineteen children. His family traced its ancestry to Scotland. When he was ten years old, his parents sent him away to study at the Kent County Free School in Chestertown, Maryland (which later became Washington College). During the 1770s, Weems studied medicine in Edinburgh; then, in the 1780s, after a religious conversion, he studied theology in London.

==Minister and traveling bookseller==

Returning to the new United States, and with the help of John Adams and Benjamin Franklin, Weems was ordained in the Episcopal Church. In 1784, he became the rector of All Hallows Parish in his native Anne Arundel County, served as chaplain of a school for girls, and preached to local African Americans. He soon began disseminating prayer books and established a charitable society to relieve widows and orphans. However, his tendencies toward Methodism (whose ministers were itinerant) proved unpopular with his bishop, Thomas John Claggett, so by 1792 Weems resigned as rector and began a traveling ministry, which included selling books on behalf of Mathew Carey, a prominent Philadelphia publisher who had emigrated from Ireland to flee persecution based on his Catholic faith.

In 1795 Weems married Frances Ewell, the daughter of prominent local patriot and planter Jesse Ewell (1734-1805), and established a household in Dumfries, Virginia. He had a small bookstore in Dumfries, which now houses the Weems–Botts Museum, but continued to travel extensively, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic states and South, a market previously dominated by British booksellers, selling books and preaching.

Dumfries is not far from Pohick Church, part of Truro Parish, in Lorton, Virginia, where both George Washington and his father, Augustine, worshiped in pre-Revolutionary days. Weems occasionally preached at Pohick Church but later inflated this Washington connection and promoted himself as the former &quot;rector of Mount-Vernon parish&quot;. In fact, Washington had provided an invaluable endorsement to what would be Weems&#x27;s first bestselling pamphlet, condemning partisanship shortly before the former president&#x27;s death, &quot;The Philanthropist: or a Good Twenty-Five Cents Worth of Political Love Powder, for Honest Adamites and Jeffersonists&quot;. In 1792 and 1793, Weems received Washington&#x27;s endorsement of his first publishing venture, a two-volume edition of sermons by Hugh Blair, and would receive other endorsements from later presidents as well as prominent local figures. Furthermore, Weems learned from his interaction with bishop Claggett. When Virginia&#x27;s evangelically-oriented bishop William Meade complained about Weems selling works by confirmed atheist Thomas Paine, Weems responded that he would only sell it together with Richard Watson&#x27;s reply, &quot;An Apology for the Bible.&quot;

In 1800 he published &quot;A History of the Life and Death, Virtues and Exploits of General George Washington&quot;, a popular book in its time that went into many reprints. Other notable works by Weems include &quot;Life of General Francis Marion&quot; (1805); &quot;Life of Benjamin Franklin, with Essays&quot; (1817); and &quot;Life of William Penn&quot; (1819). Weems also wrote several morality pamphlets, including &quot;God&#x27;s Revenge Against Gambling&quot;, &quot;Against Duelling,&quot; and &quot;The Drunkard&#x27;s Looking Glass&quot;. 

Not long after his father-in-law died in 1805, Weems began managing the Ewell family estate and by 1808 moved his family within Prince William County to the Ewell family mansion, Bel Air. However, he had debts, so in 1808 he sold Carey the copyright to his biography of George Washington for $1000, a sale which he soon regretted. In 1830, Weems owned two slaves, a young man and woman, both between 10 and 24 years old. Although Weems continued to travel extensively, Bel Air became his base, where his wife and family lived. 

He was an accomplished violinist and took a violin with him on his trips.

While traveling in Beaufort, South Carolina, Weems died on May 23, 1825, of unspecified causes. He is buried at Bel Air.

==Influence and historical reliability==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; has described Weems as one of the &quot;early hagiographers&quot; of American literature, &quot;who elevated the Swamp Fox, Francis Marion, into the American pantheon and helped secure a place there for George Washington&quot;. 

Weems&#x27;s name would probably be forgotten today were it not for the tension between the liveliness of his narratives and what &quot;Appletons&#x27; Cyclopaedia of American Biography&quot; (1889) called &quot;this charge of a want of veracity [that] is brought against all Weems&#x27;s writings,&quot; adding that &quot;it is probable he would have accounted it excusable to tell any good story to the credit of his heroes.&quot; The cherry-tree anecdote illustrates this point. Another dubious anecdote found in Weems&#x27;s biography is that of Washington&#x27;s prayer during the winter at Valley Forge.

According to the historian James M. McPherson, Weems&#x27;s biography of George Washington was likely Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s only exposure to the study of history as a boy. In a lecture given on Lincoln&#x27;s birthday in 2010 at Washington and Lee University, McPherson explained how Lincoln, as president-elect, had spoken to the legislature at Trenton, New Jersey near the location where, on the day after Christmas 1776, the American Revolution was saved from collapse by Washington&#x27;s ragged troops. According to McPherson, Lincoln said: &quot;I remember all the accounts in Weems&#x27;s books of the battlefields and struggles for the liberty of the country and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so deeply as the struggle here at Trenton: the crossing of the river, the contest with the Hessians, the great hardships endured at that time—all fixed themselves on my memory more than any single revolutionary event. I recollect thinking then, boy even though I was, that there must have been something more than common that those men struggled for.&quot;

Weems&#x27;s book &quot;Life of George Washington&quot; (1800) is an early source that helped popularize the phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t fire until you see the whites of their eyes!&quot;, said to have come from the Battle of Bunker Hill. According to modern scholarly consensus, though, the phrase was never said at the battle and originated elsewhere.

===Exaltation of Washington===
The exalted esteem in which the Founding Fathers of the United States, especially George Washington, were held by 19th-century Americans may seem absurd today, but that Washington &quot;was&quot; so regarded is undisputed. The strength of this esteem can be seen on the ceiling of the United States Capitol Building in the form of Constantino Brumidi&#x27;s fresco The Apotheosis of Washington.

Weems&#x27;s &quot;A History of the Life and Death, Virtues and Exploits of General George Washington&quot;, was a biography written in this spirit, amplified by the florid, rollicksome style that was Weems&#x27;s trademark. According to this account, his subject was &quot;... Washington, the &quot;hero&quot;, and the Demigod ...&quot; and at a level above that &quot;... what he really was, [was] &#x27;the Jupiter Conservator,&#x27; the friend and benefactor of men.&quot; With this hyperbole, Weems elevated Washington to the Augustan level of the god &quot;Jupiter Conservator [Orbis]&quot; (that is, &quot;Jupiter, Conservator of the Empire&quot;, later rendered &quot;Jupiter, Savior of the World&quot;).

===Cherry-tree anecdote===
Among the exaggerated or invented anecdotes is that of the cherry tree, attributed by Weems to &quot;an aged lady, who was a distant relative, and, when a girl, spent much of her time in the family&quot;, who referred to young George as &quot;cousin&quot;.

It went on to be reprinted in the popular &quot;McGuffey Reader&quot; used by schoolchildren, making it part of American culture, causing Washington&#x27;s February 22 birthday to be celebrated with cherry dishes, with the cherry often claimed to be a favorite of his.

As early as 1889, in Henry Cabot Lodge&#x27;s biography of Washington, historians have acknowledged that while there was &quot;nothing intrinsically impossible&quot; about the story, it and other stories recounted by Weems were &quot;on their face hopelessly and ridiculously false.&quot;

==Cultural references==
In 1911 Lawrence C. Wroth published &quot;Parson Weems: A Biographical and Critical Study&quot;. In this he confronts the fact that Weems is best known for the story of the cherry tree (p. 6) and examines the evidence for its likelihood (pp. 65ff).

Grant Wood painted the scene under the title &quot;Parson Weems&#x27; Fable&quot; in 1939. It is among his gently ironic depictions of Americana and shows the parson pulling back a curtain rimmed with cherries to show the story.

<text>Dmitrii Grigor&#x27;evich Bogrov (; – ) was a Ukrainian Jewish lawyer, known for his assassination of the Russian prime minister Pyotr Stolypin.

Raised in a wealthy Jewish family in Kyiv, Bogrov developed sympathies for revolutionary socialism from an early age and became involved with the Ukrainian anarchist movement while studying law at university. Disillusioned by the local anarchist group&#x27;s activism, he was hired as an informant by the Okhrana and kept tabs on the group&#x27;s activities. After graduating, he moved to Saint Petersburg in order to practice law and seek safety from the rising environment of antisemitism in the Russian Empire.

Disturbed by the pogroms in the Russian Empire and feeling guilty for his collaboration with the police, he began to plot the assassination of the Russian prime minister Pyotr Stolypin, who he held responsible for the attacks. He unsuccessfully attempted to elicit the support of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which caused him to have a nervous breakdown. After returning to Kyiv, he was confronted by members of his former anarchist group, who had discovered his involvement with the Okhrana and made threats against his life for it.

He again resolved to assassinate Stolypin. He told the Okhrana that assassins were planning to kill a government official, convincing them to grant him a ticket to the Kyiv Opera House, where the prime minister was due to attend a play. Having convinced the authorities that he was still on their side, he managed to get close to the prime minister and shot him twice. Stolypin died four days later. Bogrov himself was executed days after his target&#x27;s death.

Bogrov&#x27;s actions have become the subject of conspiracy theories, as well as numerous historiographical debates about his motives.

==Biography==
===Early life and activism===
Dmitrii Grigor&#x27;evich Bogrov was born in Kyiv, on , into a wealthy Jewish family. His grandfather was a well-known writer and maskil; and his father was a prominent lawyer in Kyiv, who had converted to Russian Orthodoxy. Despite his father&#x27;s conversion, Dmitrii himself continued to practice Judaism, which was the religion that was marked on his school diploma. 

The Bogrov family was deeply involved in left-wing politics: Dmitrii&#x27;s cousin was a member of the Bolsheviks, while his father supported the left of the Constitutional Democratic Party. By the time he was a teenager, Dmitrii Bogrov himself had developed sympathies for revolutionary socialism and became involved in revolutionary activities, initially as a supporter of the Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries-Maximalists. He came to identify himself as an &quot;anarchist-individualist&quot;, as he resented formal organisation, rejected conventional morality and believed revolutionaries ought to operate alone under their own direction, even once declaring &quot;I am my own party&quot;.

===Law education and informant activities===
In the wake of the 1905 Russian Revolution, Bogrov enrolled in the law school of Kyiv University. As the government began cracking down on the revolution, Bogrov&#x27;s parents sent him abroad to study at the University of Munich. There he familiarised himself with the works of Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin, before returning in 1906 to resume his studies in Kyiv. By December 1906, he had joined an anarchist communist group in Kyiv, but soon became disillusioned with their activities. 

Although his father paid for his education and provided him with a generous allowance, Bogrov started to experience financial difficulties due to his gambling habit. In February 1907, he took a job as an informant for the Okhrana. Working under the pseudonym of &quot;Alensky&quot;, he supplied the police with information on the Kyiv anarchists&#x27; activities. Many the group&#x27;s members were imprisoned or deported to Siberia during this period, including its leaders and Naum Tysh, although it&#x27;s uncertain how many of these were due to Bogrov&#x27;s reports. 

By 1908, some of the group&#x27;s members began to suspect that Bogrov was an &quot;agent provocateur&quot;. Naum Tysh and Peter Liatkovskyi accused him of betraying them to the police, but he was defended against the charges by Sandomirskyi. He also managed to convince and Juda Grossman that he was innocent of the charges against him. In July of that year, Bogrov supplied the Okhrana with information about the bomb-manufacturing activities of the Maximalists, although he would later claim that he deliberately kept the exact address from them in order to prevent a police raid from taking place. In September, he informed the police of a Maximalist plot to break Naum Tysh out of prison, resulting in the arrest of all conspirators. Bogrov himself took the opportunity to go abroad, where he told the editor of an anarchist newspaper that either Tsar Nikolai II or prime minister Pyotr Stolypin ought to be assassinated. He returned to Kyiv in April 1909.

After graduating from university in February 1910, he decided to move away from Kyiv in order to work as a lawyer&#x27;s apprentice in Saint Petersburg, believing the city was safer for Jewish people than either Kyiv or Moscow, due to the rising environment of antisemitism and pogroms in the Russian Empire. By this time, he had ceased all contact with the Okhrana in Kyiv. After a few months in Saint Petersburg, he again approached the Okhrana and was hired as an agent, working under the pseudonym &quot;Nadezhdin&quot;. But this time, he provided the police with unvaluable and even fabricated information, later claiming he did this &quot;for revolutionary purposes, so that I could make close contacts in these institutions and learn how they work.&quot;

===Assassination plot and motivation===

In June 1910, Bogrov contacted Egor Lazarev, informing him of his intention to assassinate the prime minister Pyotr Stolypin. He claimed that his motivations were both personal and ideological, although he concealed his feelings of guilt over his past role as an informant. According to Lazarev, Bogrov claimed that he sought revenge for the antisemitic pogroms that had been carried out in the Russian Empire and held Stolypin to be responsible. He requested the official sanction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, declaring that he wished &quot;to have the certainty that, after my death, there will remain people and a party who will interpret my conduct correctly, explaining it on the basis of a social and not from a personal motive.&quot; Although Lazarev himself was worried about Bogrov&#x27;s apparent indifference towards his own life, he took the proposal to the party. The SRs were initially divided over their enthusiasm for the plan, but ultimately deciding against it, fearing that it would bring repression against the party. Bogrov was devastated by the party&#x27;s rejection and subsequently suffered from a nervous breakdown. On the advice of his physician and his parents, he went abroad to Nice, in southern France, where he spent the next few months in recovery.

By March 1911, Bogrov had recovered and returned to Kyiv, where he attempted to resume his legal apprenticeship. As rumours of his past involvement with the police circulated, he received an angry letter from Juda Grossman, who demanded answers, but Bogrov responded that he was no longer involved in political activity and refused to engage further in correspondence. On 16 August, Bogrov was visited by a member of the anarchist group, who informed him that the revolutionaries intended to kill him for his collaboration with the police. When Bogrov asked how he could prevent this and &quot;rehabilitate&quot; himself, they demanded that he assassinate a Tsarist official.

Bogrov again committed himself to his plan to assassinate Stolypin, who he considered to be the &quot;source of all evil in Russia&quot;. In late August, he went to the Okhrana and told them that revolutionaries by the names of &quot;Nikolai Iakovlevich&quot; and &quot;Nina Aleksandrovna&quot; intended to assassinate a member of the government during the Tsar&#x27;s upcoming visit to the city, claiming they had a bomb and were staying at his flat. Convinced of his reliability due to his past work as an informant, the Okhrana gave him a pass to attend the events, so that he could identify and apprehend the assassin. He was provided with a ticket to a performance of The Tale of Tsar Saltan at the Kyiv Opera House, where Stolypin was due to attend and where Bogrov claimed the assassin planned to carry out his attack.

===Assassination of Stolypin===

On the evening of 1 September, while police agents staked out Bogrov&#x27;s flat, he went to the theatre and was questioned on the whereabouts of the assassins. He pretended to return to his flat and claimed that the assassin was still eating supper. Bogrov went to his seat in the seventeenth row, while Stolypin arrived and took his seat in the front row. Also among the attendees were Tsar Nikolai II, his daughters Olga and Tatiana, and the Bulgarian crown prince Boris.

The performance started at 21:00. During the first intermission, Bogrov stayed back, as Stolypin was surrounded by other people. During the second intermission, at 23:30, Bogrov was ordered to return to his flat and keep tabs on the assassins. Noticing that Stolypin was standing alone, he decided that was the moment to act. He made his way down the aisle towards the front row and all the way up to the prime minister. When he arrived in front of Stolypin, Bogrov drew his revolver and shot him twice. One bullet ricocheted off Stolypin&#x27;s wrist into the orchestra pit and hit a violinist&#x27;s leg, the other hit Stolypin in his chest, piercing through a medallion of Vladimir the Great.

As those around the prime minister were left stunned by the attack, Bogrov calmly walked away towards the exit, making it halfway down the aisle before he was apprehended. He was disarmed and removed from the theatre by the police, while people attempted to aid the dying prime minister. Stolypin was taken away to a clinic, but died four days later. When the police raided Bogrov&#x27;s flat, they found nobody there. Russian nationalists in Kyiv responded by calling for a pogrom, but the authorities refused to support their invocation, as the Tsar was still in the city. In order to pre-empt such a pogrom from taking place, Kyiv&#x27;s Jewish community denounced Bogrov&#x27;s actions and held a special service wishing health for the Tsar&#x27;s family and to Stolypin. For its part, the Socialist Revolutionary Party publicly denied taking part in the assassination.

===Interrogation, trial and execution===
When he was interrogated about the attack, Bogrov confessed that he had fabricated the story of the two assassins so that he could get access to Stolypin. He claimed that he had been threatened by revolutionaries due to their discovery of his past as an &quot;agent provocateur&quot;; he thought that this revelation alone was &quot;worse than death&quot; and desired to free himself from the guilt he felt due to his collaboration with the police. He also repeatedly identified himself as a member of the Jewish faith and claimed that he was acting in the interests of the Jewish people. He declared that he had not attempted an attack against the Tsar, as he feared it would have provoked further antisemitic pogroms.

On , Bogrov was tried by a court martial, which found him guilty of murder and sentenced him to death by hanging. He was executed on , in Lysa Hora. He died in the presence of thirty witnesses, including representatives of reactionary groups such as the Black Hundreds. The religious representative at Bogrov&#x27;s execution was Iakov Aleshkovskii, the Chief Rabbi of Kyiv. In his final words to Aleskhovskii, Bogrov asked him: &quot;Please tell the Jews that I did not want to harm them in any way, on the contrary, I struggle for their good and for the happiness of the Jewish people.&quot; His death was mourned by young Jewish and Ukrainian radicals, who had sympathised with his motives for assassinating Stolypin. 

==Legacy and historical debate==
Bogrov&#x27;s assassination of Stolypin was the last major attack in a sustained period of terrorism in the Russian Empire, which had started in 1866 with Dmitrii Karakazov&#x27;s attempted assassination of Alexander II. The assassination of Stolypin further destabilised the Empire, leading to its ultimate collapse in the 1917 Revolution. Bogrov&#x27;s actions have been compared to those of Marinus van der Lubbe and Lee Harvey Oswald, who likewise acted individually, but whose acts were nevertheless subject to widespread conspiracy theories.

Since the assassination, there has been some historical debate about Bogrov&#x27;s motives for the assassination and whether or not he acted on behalf of one group or another. Although Bogrov acted alone, he was variously accused of acting on behalf of revolutionaries, reactionaries or even the police. In his book &quot;A People&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, British historian Orlando Figes commented that this variety of possible explanations for Bogrov&#x27;s actions stemmed from Stolypin having had enemies on all sides of the political spectrum: &quot;Long before Bogrov&#x27;s bullet killed him, he [Stolypin] was politically dead.&quot; Documents regarding the assassination were also published in a heavily redacted form in 1914; it took until 2003 for a complete volume of more than 700 pages of evidence to finally be published by ROSSPEN.

The most common explanation for the assassination is that Bogrov was motivated by the threats against his life by the revolutionary anarchist group, a version which is supported by historians Abraham Ascher, Anna Geifman, George Tokmakoff, and Jonathan Daly. Geifman further suggested that Bogrov, known to have suffered from depression, had decided to commit suicide by way of homicide. Russian historian Sergei Stepanov and American historian Victoria Khiterer have also theorised that Bogrov sought revenge for the recent pogroms in the Russian Empire. American historian Norman Naimark depicted the actions of Bogrov and other Jewish assassins of the period as having resulted from the direct antisemitic oppression that they faced and a consequential disillusionment with the results of assimilation. American historian Paul Avrich also considered the assassination to have been a &quot;personal act&quot; by Bogrov, rather than having been influenced by his associations with the police or revolutionary groups. In his historical fiction novel &quot;The Red Wheel&quot;, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn suggested that Bogrov was motivated by protecting the interests of his Jewish family against rising Russian nationalism. The 2012 Russian docu-drama &quot;Stolypin: A Shot at Russia&quot; likewise highlighted Bogrov&#x27;s Jewish background as a motivation for the assassination, while also portraying his character as a gambler and insect collector. This &quot;Jewish motivation&quot; has been disputed by Ascher and Geifman, as well as Simon Dixon, who each highlighted the assimilation of Bogrov&#x27;s family into the Russian elite. 

Other hypotheses included that of Stolypin&#x27;s own brother , who speculated that Grigori Rasputin had directed the assassination, although there is no evidence that Rasputin and Bogrov were ever in contact. The hypothesis of police manipulation claims that the Tsar had become jealous of Stolypin&#x27;s popularity and pressed the Okhrana to have him eliminated; but the Tsar himself had the power to dismiss ministers, so he could have already done so. Solzhenitsyn also alleged Bogrov to have been working as a double agent for the Okhrana. Yakov Protazanov&#x27;s 1928 film &quot;The White Eagle&quot; also makes allusions to the culpability of the Tsarist government in Bogrov&#x27;s assassination of Stolypin. But allegations of a conspiracy on the part of the police are disputed, with evidence pointing to police incompetence rather than malice.

<doc id="516173" wikidata="Q649771" url="?curid=516173" title="Lake Makgadikgadi">
<text>Lake Makgadikgadi (, ) was a paleolake that existed in what is now the Kalahari Desert in Botswana from 2,000,000 years BP to 10,000 years BP. It may have once covered an area of from and was deep. The Okavango, Upper Zambezi, and Cuando rivers once all emptied into the lake. Its remains are seen in the Makgadikgadi salt pans, one of the largest salt pans in the world.

DNA research suggests the lake region is the homeland of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, where humans first evolved as a distinct species about 200,000 years ago, before expanding to other parts of Africa about 70,000 years later.

==Origin and history==
Approximately 3 million years ago, strong easterly winds formed long dunes, which ran from east to west across the middle of the Kalahari Desert. During wetter times, these dunes channeled the great rivers of the area, the Okavango, Chobe, and Upper Zambezi, southeastward to join with the Limpopo River and drain into the Indian Ocean.

Northern Botswana has a series of deep, underlying fault lines running beneath its sands. These faults are thought to be the southernmost extensions of the same system of parallel fault lines that are pulling away from each other and have formed East Africa&#x27;s Great Rift Valley. Parts of the courses of both the Linyanti River and Chobe River, mark the line of these faults today.

Approximately 2 million years ago, the fault known as the Ovamboland-Kalahari-Zimbabwe axis (which runs from NE to SW from Harare through Bulawayo and ends in the east side of the Kalahari Desert) moved in an epeirogenic flexure, and cut off the drainage route into the Limpopo. The blocked outflow allowed for the creation of Lake Makgadikgadi.

The great Magwikwe Sand Ridge between Savuti and North Gate probably defined one of its northwestern shorelines. Another is thought to have been the less obvious Gidikwe Sand Ridge lying just to the west of the western border of the present Makgadikgadi National Park.

Wave-washed features can be found on several of the Kalahari&#x27;s higher places in this region. The eastern side of the Ghoha Hills, north of Savuti, is a particularly clear example of this. Round, water-eroded pebbles can also be found.

As the millennia passed, the lake filled to capacity. It began to overflow about 20,000 years ago, taking the lowest point in the watershed in the north east as its new outlet. This caused the middle and lower Zambezi Rivers to connect, forming the Victoria Falls. With the water now able to flow out of the basin, Lake Makgadikgadi drained partially and its average level decreased.

A drier climatic period followed, which increased evaporation and decreased the flow of the rivers that fed the lake. By about 10,000 years ago the drying of Lake Makgadikgadi was in an advanced stage. Sediment and debris from the Okavango River and windblown sand were gradually filling the lake.

The Gumare fault formed and lowered the land. As a result, the water of the Okavango River spread out over a much larger area of land than it previously had, forming the now characteristic fan-shaped inland delta of the Okavango, which further reduced the water that flowed into Lake Makgadikgadi and hastened its demise.

=== Human origin theory ===
In October 2019, a team led by Vanessa Hayes proposed that land around Lake Makgadikgadi was the area where modern humans (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) first evolved. The findings are based on 1,217 samples of mitochondrial DNA, taken from populations in Southern Africa. The researchers were able to trace where the earliest maternal lineage of modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; emerged, about 200,000 years ago (200 kya). They concluded this was in an area south of the Zambezi River, encompassing parts of what’s now known as Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. This corresponds to the shores of the ancient Lake Makgadikgadi.

The conclusion is disputed by Chris Stringer, head of human origins at the Natural History Museum in London, and Sarah Tishkoff, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania.

Excavations of early &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; activities have been found at Ga-Mohana Hill in Northern Cape dated to 105,000 years ago (105 kya).

==Ecology==
Lake Makgadikgadi is theorised to have been the birthplace of the vast number of cichlids that once swam the Congo, Zambezi, Okavango and Limpopo rivers—as many as 100 to 400 new species, of which approximately 25 survive today. The lake&#x27;s sheer size may have provided the ancestors of these fish with an extremely wide range of new ecological niches to exploit and thus could have served as the stimulus for the evolution of the new species, which they may have done in record time before the lake drained completely. The theory further says that the new species, after having evolved within the confines of the lake, could have escaped with the lakewater as it drained, and populated the rivers of the region to evolve into the cichlids that exist today.

In current times this land is desiccated most of the year and is a seasonal wetland in the rainy summer months.

== Legacy ==

Today the only remains of Lake Makgadikgadi are the Okavango Delta, the Nxai Pan, Lake Ngami, Lake Xau, the Mababe Depression, and the two main Makgadikgadi pans: the Sua Pan and the Nwetwe Pan.

The Makgadikgadi Salt Pans are among the largest in the world and are formed from the last remnants of this great lake. The Okavango Delta is a very large, swampy inland delta formed where the Okavango River reaches the former bed of the lake. It is now an endorheic basin in which all the water reaching the basin is ultimately evaporated and transpired.

The other south draining rivers that once fed the lake have now all been captured by the Zambezi.

<doc id="516176" wikidata="Q1019180" url="?curid=516176" title="Westward Ho!">
<text>Westward Ho! is a seaside village near Bideford in Devon, England. The A39 road provides access from the towns of Barnstaple, Bideford, and Bude. It lies at the south end of Northam Burrows and faces westward into Bideford Bay, opposite Saunton Sands and Braunton Burrows. There is an electoral ward with the same name. The population at the 2011 census was 2,112.

==Name==

Westward Ho! is noted for its unusual place name. The village name comes from the title of Charles Kingsley&#x27;s novel &quot;Westward Ho!&quot; (1855), which was set in nearby Bideford. The book was a bestseller, and entrepreneurs saw the opportunity to develop tourism in the area. The Northam Burrows Hotel and Villa Building Company, chaired by Isaac Newton Wallop, 5th Earl of Portsmouth, was formed in 1863, and its prospectus stated:

The hotel was named the Westward Ho!-tel, and the adjacent villas were also named after the book. As further development took place, the expanding settlement also acquired the name of Westward Ho! The exclamation mark is therefore an intentional part of the village&#x27;s name. It is the only such place name in the British Isles; Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!, Quebec, Canada, shares the distinction of having an exclamation mark in its name.

==Development==

Development of the village began ten years after the 1855 Kingsley novel was published, in order to satisfy the Victorians&#x27; passion for seaside holidays. The United Services College was founded in the village in 1874.

Shell middens and a submerged forest that date to the Mesolithic period have been excavated on the shoreline at Westward Ho!.

The village has become more residential as holiday camps closed and houses and flats were erected. One former camp was Torville Camp. The two major holiday camps still running are Surfbay Holiday Park and Braddick&#x27;s Holiday Centre.

==United Services College==

The United Services College, a public school for boys aged about thirteen to eighteen, was founded at Westward Ho! in 1874 and had the aim of preparing boys for the army and navy and for the service of the British Empire. It lasted until 1906, when it merged with the Imperial Service College in Berkshire and closed its site at Westward Ho!. Notable old boys included Rudyard Kipling, whose book &quot;Stalky &amp; Co.&quot; (1899) is based on his time at the College.

==Geography==

Westward Ho! is known for its surfing seas and the long expanse of clean sand backed by a pebble ridge and grasslands which extends for about three miles. It has two churches, Westward Ho! Baptist Church and Holy Trinity Church.

The seaward part of the village lies within the North Devon Coast, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==Geology==
The rocks on the coastline of Westward Ho! are of Upper Carboniferous age. The rocks were tilted during the Variscan Orogeny; in the present day they dip at 50–70 degrees north and south. The wave-cut platform is an example of a multi-scale fault system, with the phases of tectonic activity exposed at low tide.

==Transport==
===Bus services===
* Stagecoach 21 – The North Devon Wave – Westward Ho! – Northam – Bideford – Instow Anstey Way – Fremington – Bickington – Railway Station – Barnstaple Bus Station - Braunton - Ilfracombe
* Stagecoach services run right through the day at 30-minute intervals, 2 buses an hour during the summer months and hourly during the winter.
* Stagecoach 16 runs to Appledore – Northam – Bideford 6 times a week only on Tuesdays and Thursdays 3x per day.
*National Express Coaches used to serve Westward Ho!.

===Railway===

A railway served Westward Ho! from 1901 to 1917. The Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway was a standard gauge railway which ran between these places, but had no connection with the rest of the railway system, though there was a pedestrian ferry link from Appledore to Instow which was connected to the rest of the rail network of Britain. A section of the trackbed is used as part of the South West Coast Path.
The West Country class locomotive number &quot;21C136&quot; (later &quot;34036&quot;), built initially for Southern Railways and later British Rail, was named &quot;Westward Ho!&quot; after the town.

==Sports==
It is also known for the Royal North Devon Golf Club, the oldest golf course in England and Wales. Other attractions of the village include the arcades, a go-kart track and the Rock Pool, a tidal lido.

== World War II ==
Adapted Bailey bridges were tested at Westward Ho! as part of the Mulberry Harbour project, as well as the Panjandrum by the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development.

==Notable resident==
Rudyard Kipling spent several of his childhood years at Westward Ho!, where he attended the United Services College (later absorbed by Haileybury College, which is now in Hertfordshire). His collection of stories, &quot;Stalky &amp; Co&quot;, published in 1899, was based on his experiences at the College. To commemorate his living there, the first stanza of his poem &quot;If—&quot; is set into the pavement on the promenade in granite setts.
==Twin towns==
Westward Ho! is twinned with Mondeville in France, and Büddenstedt in Germany.

==In popular culture==
The town lends its name to the song &quot;Westward Ho! - Massive Letdown&quot; by the band Half Man Half Biscuit which recounts a dream about holidaying in the town. The song also mentions the nearby town of Northam.

<text>Carolina Maria de Jesus (14 March 1914 – 13 February 1977) was a Brazilian outskirts memoirist who lived most of her life as a slum-dweller. She is best known for her diary, published in August 1960 as &quot;Quarto de Despejo&quot; (lit. &quot;Junk Room&quot;) after attracting the attention of a Brazilian journalist, which became a bestseller and won international acclaim. Appearing in English translation under the title &quot;Child of the Dark: The Diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus&quot; (US) or &quot;Beyond All Pity&quot; (UK), the work remains the only document published in English by a Brazilian slum-dweller of that period. De Jesus spent a significant part of her life in the Canindé [pt] favela in North São Paulo, supporting herself and three children as a scrap collector.

&quot;Quarto de despejo&quot; did not stop at being an editorial success, it also spawned theatrical plays, musical compositions (some by de Jesus herself), illustrations and sayings, and is a source for both individual and collective artistic creations, especially by other Black women from Brazilian city outskirts. De Jesus lends her name to community preparatory schools, theatre halls, saraus and collective action groups. The 2020 edition of the (Outskirts Literary Festival) was held in honour of de Jesus&#x27; memory, on the 60th anniversary of the book&#x27;s publication.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Carolina Maria de Jesus was born in 1914 in Sacramento, Minas Gerais, which at that time was a small rural town. Her parents were illiterate sharecroppers. She was the daughter of a single mother, and her father was married to another woman. For those reasons, she was treated as an outcast as a child and was a victim of child mistreatment. When she reached the age of seven, de Jesus&#x27; mother forced her to attend school. Maria Leite Monteiro de Barros, a wealthy landowner&#x27;s wife who was also a benefactor to other poor black neighbourhood children, supported her for a while and paid for her schooling. Her formal education lasted a meagre two years, though by then she was already able to read and write. As her mother had illegitimate children, her family was excluded from Catholic Church. Nevertheless, she never stopped considering herself a Catholic. For instance, she often made biblical references and praises to God in her diary: &quot;I dreamt I was an angel. My dress was billowing and had long pink sleeves. I went from earth to heaven. I put stars in my hands and played with them. I talked to the stars. They put on a show in my honor. They danced around me and made a luminous path. When I woke up I thought: I’m so poor. I can&#x27;t afford to go to a play so God sends me these dreams for my aching soul. To the God who protects me, I send my thanks.&quot;

In 1937, the year her mother died, de Jesus migrated to the metropolis of São Paulo, which was experiencing a demographic upswing and witnessing the appearance of its first slums. Here, she worked as a maid for white families, but found that the work clashed with her independent personality. In 1948, she became pregnant. These reasons led to her dismissal by the family for which she was a maid, and she ended up needing to live in the nearby favela, Canindé. It is reported that authorities in her hometown thought her ability to read meant that she was a practitioner of witchcraft, because it was so unusual for someone like her. In São Paulo, she earned a living by collecting recyclable materials. She would purchase what little food she could afford with the earnings of her hard work. De Jesus made her own shack out of scrap plywood, cans, cardboard, or pretty much anything she could obtain. Among the materials she collected, there would be an occasional journal or notebook, as well as books, which encouraged her to start recording her day-to-day activities and write about life in the favela. It angered her neighbours that she was always writing because they were illiterate and felt uncomfortable at the thought of her writing about them. Her neighbours were jealous of her and tended to treat de Jesus and her children badly. She never considered getting married, on account of having witnessed too much domestic violence in the slums and preferring to remain an independent woman. She had three children, each from a different relationship (at least one of whom was with a wealthy white man). Unlike many fellow black women, de Jesus celebrated her race and was proud of it. To her, her skin and hair looked beautiful.

In her diary, she gives details about the daily life of favelados (the inhabitants of favelas), and bluntly describes the political and social facts which impacted their lives. She writes of how poverty and desperation can cause people of elevated moral character to abandon their principles and dishonour themselves to simply feed their families. According to her, favelados would never get the chance to save money, as any extra earnings would immediately be used to pay off debts.

==Publication of her diary==
De Jesus&#x27; diary was published in August 1960. She had been discovered by journalist Audálio Dantas in April 1958. Dantas was covering the opening of a neighbouring city playground when, immediately after the ribbon-cuttings, a street gang stormed in and claimed the area, chasing the children away. Dantas saw de Jesus standing at the edge of the playground shouting, &quot;If you continue mistreating these children, I&#x27;m going to put all of your names in my book!&quot;. The intruders departed. Dantas asked what she meant by &quot;book&quot;; she was shy at first, but took him to her shack and showed him everything she had written. He asked her for a small sample and subsequently ran it in the newspaper. However, de Jesus is known to have given interviews and made other newspaper appearances since the early 1940s.

The inspiration for the book&#x27;s title came from de Jesus&#x27; believing the favela was society&#x27;s junk room: &#x27;I live in the junk room. And whatever&#x27;s in there, people either set on fire, or throw in the garbage&#x27;.

De Jesus&#x27;s story electrified the town and in 1960, &quot;Quarto&quot; de Despejo was released. The first edition quickly sold its 10,000 initial copies. 20,000 copies of the second edition and an additional 50,000 copies of the third edition were soon printed to meet the popular demand of the book. Though written in the simple language of a favela dweller, the book was translated into thirteen (another source says fourteen) languages and became a bestseller in North America and Europe. It was published in the United States and UK as &quot;Child of the Dark: The Diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus&quot; in 1962. The book was heavily edited by Dantas, and some critics suspected it a fraud; but the original manuscript was preserved and reprinted in full in 1999, proving not only that de Jesus wrote the book herself, but that she was a much livelier and more poetic writer than Dantas&#x27; edition seemed to suggest. Additionally, we know that while de Jesus wanted to publish more of her own stories and poems, Dantas heavily advised her against doing so.

The book&#x27;s status as a bestseller came as a surprise to her neighbourhood as well as the country. Many of de Jesus&#x27;s neighbours knew about her writings before the publication and would tease and ridicule her because of them. &quot;Most couldn&#x27;t even read, but thought she should be doing other things with her spare time than writing and saving old writings.&quot; Despite the large amount of publicity and popularity caused by the diary, de Jesus continued to be a social pariah.

De Jesus&#x27; diary detailed the grim reality of her life as well as that of those around her. She judged her neighbours based on their lifestyles, using actual names and circumstances in the book. &quot;You wrote bad things about me, you did worse than I did&quot;, a drunken neighbour once yelled. Many neighbours despised de Jesus because she seemed to look down on slum people&#x27;s way of life. One man &quot;screamed at her that she was a &#x27;black whore&#x27; who had become rich by writing about favelados but refused to share any of her money with them.&quot; In addition to their cruel words, people threw stones and full chamber pots at her and her children. They were also angry because she used the proceeds of her diary to move into a brick-house in the high-end neighbourhood of Santana. &quot;Neighbors swarmed around the truck and wouldn&#x27;t let her leave. &#x27;You think you are high class now, don&#x27;t you&#x27;&quot;, they would scream. They despised her for what they saw as a disparagement of their way of life, even though a major achievement of her diary was to increase awareness about Brazilian favelas the world over.

Seeing as de Jesus raised concerns about conditions in the favelas, local politicians started wanting to meet with her to discuss possible ways to amend the situation. São Paulo&#x27;s governor Francisco Prestes Maia made a move to engage state agencies in providing poverty relief for favelados. Most of his projects were concerned with teaching women to sew, care properly for their children and practice good hygiene. However, these initiatives quickly faded.

==Children==

De Jesus&#x27; had three children: João José, José (aka Zé) Carlos, and Vera Eunice. Through interviews for &quot;The Life and Death of Maria de Jesus&quot; (see below ), second eldest Zé and daughter Vera provide vital information about her personality.

In her interview, Vera clearly describes how her mother devoted herself entirely to her dream of becoming a writer, without any help from others. Vera admired her mother&#x27;s aspiration to create a better life not only for herself but for her children. Although living with de Jesus&#x27; could be challenging, Vera stated &quot;There is no one in the world I admire more than her.&quot; Vera stresses how the success of her mother&#x27;s work quickly resulted in the family constantly traveling, attending parties, and living in a large mansion that seemed almost prison-like due to its large size. Constantly praising her mother during the interview, Vera gives full credit to de Jesus for her achievements; according to her, she would never have been able to attend school if it were not for her mother&#x27;s success.

Vera constantly mentions the danger of living in the favela and how, although she and her siblings were born poor, their mother fought for a better life for them. Violence in the favela made it dangerous for Vera and her brothers to be on the streets with her mother, so most of their time was spent idly, sometimes studying, in their shack waiting for her to return. De Jesus rarely let her children leave their shack, fearing for their safety. Leaving her children alone at night was too dangerous. Vera states: &quot;We didn’t have enough money to buy proper food, but my mother wanted us to stay out of the favela! She disliked not only the favela, but the people who lived in it... my mother gave [my brothers] money to stay away the whole day. They only returned at night, to sleep. Movie tickets ended up costing much of our money for food, but she preferred it that way. She preferred to leave at dawn, with her sack on her shoulders, to walk, walk, walk and to go to bed hungry, rather than to leave us alone in Canindé.&quot; &quot;Hunger is the world plague of the favela&quot;, Vera stated.

Vera made it clear that there was constantly a man in her mother&#x27;s life. In her words, de Jesus loved being infatuated and was very sexually-oriented. She stressed how her mother did not fancy the Black men of the favela and how they did not favour her too much either. While she had been called a witch in her hometown, in Canindé she was regarded merely as an eccentric. People there were less in awe of her writing than intimidated by it: &quot;In the favela, they thought that she was crazy, walking with her notebook under her arm. There were people who laughed. The worst ones laughed at her piles of paper, but they stopped when they realized that it was neither a joke nor craziness&quot;. When someone upset her, she threatened to write about them in her book. Jealousy of her writing, men, and lifestyle resulted in other faveladas (the female inhabitants of favelas) antagonizing her. However, that did not stop de Jesus from continuing to write about what was going on in the favela.

During the interview, Vera recalls an event specifically showing her mother&#x27;s love and protection towards her children. She recalled a childhood event in which she was playing on the grass when a man approached her and asked her to help him find something. The two headed down towards a river and soon the man began removing Vera&#x27;s clothes in an indication that he was about to rape her. De Jesus instinctively felt her daughter was in danger, and soon made her way down to the river, thereby rescuing her daughter and chasing the stranger away.

According to Vera, before the publication of &quot;Quarto de despejo&quot; her mother became obsessed with Audálio Dantas, her publisher, and was constantly anxious about him sending word about her diary. Soon after the book was released, Vera found herself attending her mother&#x27;s book signings, wearing new clothes, and traveling across Brazil. All of a sudden, everything Vera, her brothers, and her mother wanted was at their fingertips. Vera said her mother always liked to be the centre of attention, and aspired to become a singer and an actress. In spite of her ambitions, her publisher argued that this would bring her no benefit and insisted she should continue writing books.

Soon after the family switched neighbourhoods from the favela to Santana the children witnessed intense discrimination from their wealthy neighbors. There, the family lived in a large brick-house that they thought of as a prison due to its large size in comparison to their previous home. Neighbourhood kids were not allowed to play with Vera and her brothers as their families considered de Jesus was &quot;marked by the favela&quot;.

Despite her mother&#x27;s fame and fortune, Vera noticed de Jesus was becoming impatient due to her lack of privacy. Before the fame, all de Jesus wanted was to have her writing noticed, but she had started regretting her decisions. Now that money was plentiful (it is estimated she made ₢$2,000 by selling her author&#x27;s rights, as compared to a 20 cruzeiros income from collecting paper), de Jesus began to spend it for no reason. She had intentions of sending both Vera and Zé Carlos to Italy but soon changed her mind and decided to invest in a small ranch in far-flung Parelheiros where she ended up moving with her children. The family was excited about living in a rural area and Vera saw her mother become hard-working again: growing crops, taking care of the household, and tending to her youngest João as his health grew ill. The family was prevented from getting medical help for him from public health services at the time as they did not have a work card, which was required by the social security agency.

De Jesus&#x27; new fame was found to be brief mainly due to the military dictatorship coming into power in 1964 (citation of military dictatorship), which turned people away from socially critical works of literature, such as Quarto de Despejo. Without a propagation of her status to provide income, she eventually was forced to move back to the favela, making the situation even more complicated for her sick son, João.

Eventually, João died of kidney failure only four months after his mother had passed from respiratory failure in 1977. Vera Eunice, who was interviewed in 1994, got married and became a teacher, and at the time of the interview was a nighttime higher education student with plans of becoming an English-language translator. On the other hand, her second oldest, José Carlos was twice divorced, occasionally homeless and an alcoholic, and purportedly as smart, angry and erratic as his mother.

==Perspective==
One of the characteristics differentiating Carolina Maria de Jesus from her neighbours in the Canindé favela was her distinctive perspective on life. Though living among the lowest classes of society, de Jesus had dreams and aspirations not unlike those of any privileged person who enjoyed a comfortable living in Brazil during the mid-1900s. De Jesus believed that her dreams could be realized and, against great odds, many of them were. She stood by a different paradigm than her favelado counterparts, and lived accordingly.

At no point in de Jesus&#x27;s life was she at peace with the fact that she was born into the lower classes. The activities she occupied her spare time with, her decision to avoid the many risks of a vulnerable life as well as her affairs, all indicated that while she was physically in the favela, her mind wandered free. &quot;[W]hat set Carolina apart in Canindé was her penchant for spending several hours a day writing&quot;. In an environment with high illiteracy rates, eloquent writing was a particularly rare accomplishment. She wrote poems, novels and stories. In the early 1940s, de Jesus began taking her work to editors in an attempt to get it published. She persevered until in 1960, Dantas decided to publish her diary.

Among the many things de Jesus chose to write about in her diary were the people living around her. She describes herself as being very different from fellow favelados, and claimed that &quot;she detested other blacks from her social class&quot;. While she watched many of the people around her succumb to drugs, alcohol, prostitution, violence, and robbery, she strived to stay loyal to her children and her writing. De Jesus was consistently able to provide for her children by recycling scrap material for money or diving through dumpsters for food and clothing. By saving some of the paper she collected, de Jesus had the material she needed to go on with her writing.

De Jesus offers a non-academic perspective on poverty and exclusionary economic expansion in Brazil, which was then rarely made by someone who did not come from the educated classes. The moment is particularly ironic, as it was a time when Brasília, the symbol of a &#x27;New Brasil&#x27;, had just been inaugurated.

Another atypical part of de Jesus&#x27; life concerned romantic affairs. Although it was not unusual for Black women at the time to seek light-skinned partners, since lighter skin was openly associated with higher economic status due to white systemic racism and anti-Blackness, de Jesus did not want to leverage relationships in order to improve her own situation. Her children were fathered by white foreigners from Italy, Portugal, and the United States. A few romantic partners offered to marry her, yet she accepted none of their proposals, even though by marrying them, she would have been lifted out of poverty. A possible explanation for that may be that she did not want anyone dictating how she lived. Regardless of the reason, de Jesus remained true to her beliefs and did not conform to the way of life of the favela.
==Global impact==

Carolina Maria de Jesus had a great cultural impact on Brazil. Her decision to write about the struggles of the community versus strictly about her own struggles was something unprecedented in Brazil and was a perspective that was appreciated internationally

De Jesus wrote another four books after &quot;Quarto de despejo&quot;, to a scanty success. She rose to fame and fell from grace very rapidly. This could be because of her strong personality, which kept her from getting along with people very well. Also, the Brazilian political landscape changed drastically after the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état, which left little room for freedom of expression. She still wrote poems, short stories, and brief memoirs, none of which were ever published. In fact, her obituary in a 1977 edition of the &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot; speaks of her blaming herself for not being able to take advantage of her brief celebrity status and states that her stubbornness led her to die in poverty. Still, her biography and memoirs provide insight into Brazilian favela life. While her life story can be seen as a struggle with tragedy, it is possible to regard her views as common Brazilian attitudes towards society, family life, equality, poverty, and other aspects of daily existence in the 1960s.

Her book was read extensively both in capitalist areas such as Western Europe and the United States, as well as in the Eastern Bloc and Cuba, the wide range of the audience demonstrating how many people were affected by her story outside of Brazil. For the liberal capitalist West, the book portrayed a cruel and corrupt system which had been reinforced by centuries of colonial ideals they also shared. By contrast, for communist readers the stories depicted perfectly the fundamental flaws of capitalist production in which the worker is the most downtrodden part of the economic system.

As Brazilian historian José Carlos Sebe Bom Meihy noted, &quot;many foreign specialists in Brazil year after year used her translated diary in their classes&quot;, which indicates her worldwide role in providing an uncommon first-hand account of 1960s favela life. According to Robert M. Levine, &quot;Carolina&#x27;s words brought alive a slice of Latin American reality rarely acknowledged in traditional textbooks.&quot;

A biography about her was written by author Jarid Arraes as part of her 2015 cordel collection and book &quot;Heroínas Negras Brasileiras em 15 cordéis&quot;.

On 14 March 2019, search engine Google commemorated de Jesus with a Doodle on the 105th anniversary of her birth.

<text>Myron Waldman (April 23, 1908 – February 4, 2006) was an American animator, best known for his work at Fleischer Studios.

==Early life==
Waldman was born in Brooklyn, New York on April 23, 1908. He was a graduate of the Pratt Institute, where he majored in Art.

==Career==
Waldman started his first work in 1930 at Fleischer Studio. At Fleischer he worked on Betty Boop, Raggedy Ann, &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, the animated adaptations of Superman, and Popeye. He was head animator on two Academy Award-nominated shorts, &quot;Educated Fish&quot; (1937) and &quot;Hunky and Spunky&quot; (1939).

Waldman made the transition when Fleischer Studios was acquired by Paramount Pictures and reorganized as Famous Studios in 1942. At Famous he worked mostly on the Casper the Friendly Ghost series.

Waldman served three years in the U.S. Army (1939-1942).

In 1943, Waldman partnered with writer Steve Carlin to produce the &quot;Happy the Humbug&quot; comic strip.

In 1943, his &quot;wordless novel&quot;, &quot;Eve: A Pictorial Love Story&quot; was a critical success.

In 1957, he left Famous to become an animation director at Hal Seeger Productions where he worked on the revival of the &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; series, as well as Milton the Monster, until his retirement in 1968.

In 1986, Waldman received the Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists Award, and in 1997 was given the Winsor McCay Award for his lifetime work in the field of animation.

Waldman made limited edition cel, drawing characters on which he worked, Betty Boop, Popeye and Superman.

==Personal life==
Waldman met his wife, Rosalie, when she was an animation checker at the Fleischer Studio in the early 1940s, and had two sons, Robert and Steve. Waldman died of congestive heart failure on February 4, 2006, at the age of 97 at a hospital in Bethpage, New York.

<text>Fulton Hall is a building on the campus of Boston College that houses the Carroll School of Management. It is named for university president Robert J. Fulton.

==History==
When World War II ended in 1945 there was a dramatic increase in enrollment at Boston College, due to the returning soldiers and the opportunities afforded to them by the G.I. Bill. The number of undergraduates swelled from 1,000 before the war to 5,000 by 1946. The available facilities could no longer accommodate any more students, so Boston College decided to build Fulton Hall. This building was, by far, the most sparse due to budget constraints. Students went door to door throughout the city of Boston selling “Bricks for Boston College” for $1 each in an attempt to raise funds. Working with whatever resources they could, Maginnis &amp; Walsh designed a building that would never be able to live up to the rest of the existing buildings. The construction of Fulton Hall began in June 1947 and ended in 1948. The building was laid out on the south side of what is now known as the main quad. This area is composed of a large grassy courtyard surrounded by the Lyons, Gasson, Devlin, and Fulton buildings, one in each cardinal direction. The original design consisted of a simple 2-story Gothic-style building with a plain masonry façade, two towers in the front corners and a recessed courtyard on the south side. Because of its hilly location, and a request from the Trustees of Boston College that the building not block the view of Gasson Hall, only the top two stories were visible from the front of the building and the Gasson quadrangle, making it look small amongst the taller adjacent buildings.

==Architectural description and renovation==
In the summer of 1993, Svigals &amp; Associates radically renovated the exterior with the same polychrome masonry work as the rest of the building, but its interior is drastically different.

and reduces the industrial feel of the exposed structural members. The contrast of a warm and soft material like wood and a cold and stiff one like metal creates a very interesting effect, where the softer warmer material gives the building a finished, refined and elegant look while the steel makes it feel modern, strong and minimalist.

The large glass ceiling of the atrium allows large amounts of light to flow into the building throughout the day because of its east to west layout. This light is softened by the use of diffusing finishes on all of the interior surfaces, creating a naturally lit environment where it is nearly impossible to identify the source of light. All exposed wood has an eggshell finish that diffuses the light, as the masonry walls of the original building naturally do. To use the atrium&#x27;s natural light and provide a sense of openness, the third, fourth, and fifth-floor north-facing walls (that face the atrium) on the rear section feature large windows. The second floor has a U-shaped balcony area that overlooks the open area in first floor, which is furnished with couches benches and tables and meant to be a meeting place and lounge area for students. The balcony, which connects the old building to the new one, features steel and wood handrails composed of steel vertical elements and wood horizontal elements that provide a softer and warmer material for human interaction. The handrails also feature gothic arches that span from column to column, and represent the union of the classic gothic building and the new, modern addition.

Because of lack of funds when it was constructed, the original Fulton Hall was a short, plain stone building. Many felt it looked out of place amongst the other much more ostentatious and taller colored-stone buildings. For many years, many regarded it as the most unsuccessful of the Maginnis &amp; Walsh buildings. It went through many minor renovations, including construction of a small Library on the south side of the building overlooking the courtyard. This small library now overlooks the atrium. This wall features seven evenly spaced windows in the form of large Gothic arches, each of which is divided into three columns, each featuring a drop-shaped subdivision near the top for decoration. A lead rectangular grid pattern applied to large panels of glass creates the effect of the window being composed of small panes. This is a sharp contrast from the windows in the new addition, which are rectangular and feature large uninterrupted glass panes.

<doc id="516202" wikidata="Q1756747" url="?curid=516202" title="Prime Minister of Dominica">
<text>The prime minister of Dominica is the head of government in the Commonwealth of Dominica. Nominally, the position was created on November 3, 1978, when Dominica gained independence from the United Kingdom. Hitherto, the position existed de facto as Premier.
Roosevelt Skerrit is the incumbent prime minister. He took office on 8 January 2004

==Authority and duties==
According to Chapter 59 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Dominica;
# There shall be a Prime Minister of Dominica, who shall be appointed by the President.
# Whenever the President has occasion to appoint a Prime Minister he shall appoint an elected member of the House who appears to him likely to command the support of the majority of the elected members of the House.

The President, acting in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister, appoints the Cabinet of Minister. The Prime Minister supervises Cabinet meetings and in the spirit of the Westminster system is nominally &#x27;Primus Inter Pares&#x27; or first among equals. However Prime Ministers of Dominica, like most Prime Ministers in Small-Island States, have generally governed in a presidential manner.

<doc id="516209" wikidata="Q1652953" url="?curid=516209" title="I. A. L. Diamond">
<text>I. A. L. Diamond (born Ițec (Itzek) Domnici; June 27, 1920 – April 21, 1988) was a Romanian–American screenwriter, best known for his collaborations with Billy Wilder.

==Life and career==
Diamond was born in Ungheni, Bessarabia, Romania, i.e. present day Moldova. He emigrated with his mother and sister, following his father to the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn in the United States. There, he studied at the Boy&#x27;s High School, showing ability in mathematics, competing in the state Mathematics Olympiads in 1936–37 and winning several medals therein. Diamond was referred to as &quot;Iz&quot; in Hollywood, and was known to quip that his initials stood for &quot;Interscholastic Algebra League&quot;, a prize he also won while attending Boys&#x27; High School. Diamond completed his undergraduate studies at Columbia in 1941. There he studied journalism, publishing in the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;I. A. L. Diamond&quot;. He was editor of the humor magazine &quot;Jester of Columbia&quot; and a member of the Philolexian Society. He became the only person to single-handedly write four consecutive productions of the annual revue, the Varsity Show and a spare should they need one. After graduating, he abandoned the plan to pursue his master&#x27;s in engineering at Columbia and accepted a short-term contract in Hollywood. A succession of limited-term contracts ensued, notably at Paramount, where Diamond worked on projects without receiving a writing credit. He moved to Universal Pictures, where he made his first film &quot;Murder in the Blue Room&quot;. It was a year later at Warner Bros., that he achieved his first real success and consequent recognition with &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot;. He worked at 20th Century Fox for four years. In 1957, he began collaborating with Billy Wilder, working on the film &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot;. They later wrote the classic films, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, &quot;The Apartment&quot; (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay), &quot;One, Two, Three&quot;, &quot;Irma la Douce&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me, Stupid&quot; and &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. In 1969, Diamond wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of the play Cactus Flower. In total, Diamond and Wilder wrote the scripts for twelve films. Some featured characters engaging in an endless but friendly squabbling, such as Joe and Jerry in &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; and Holmes and Watson in &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Diamond&#x27;s widow said that these characters were based on her husband&#x27;s relationship with Wilder. In 1980, Diamond and Wilder received the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s Laurel Award for career achievement in screenwriting. Wilder had previously received the Laurel Award in 1957 for his partnership with Charles Brackett. Diamond died of multiple myeloma on April 21, 1988.

<text>Muddy Creek is a tributary of the Colorado River, approximately long, in north central Colorado in the United States.

It rises in northwestern Grand County, in the Routt National Forest west of Rabbit Ears Pass at the continental divide. It flows south, east, then southwest, and joins the Colorado near Kremmling.

==Wolford Mountain Reservoir==
The creek was dammed in 1996 to create the Wolford Mountain Reservoir, which forms part of the Wolford Mountain Recreation Area.

<doc id="516225" wikidata="Q3586416" url="?curid=516225" title="1956 Quebec general election">
<text>The 1956 Quebec general election was held on June 20, 1956, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Union Nationale, led by Maurice Duplessis, won re-election, defeating the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Georges-Émile Lapalme.

This was the fifth and final time (and the fourth in a row) that Duplessis led his party to a general election victory. No party has since been able to win more than three elections in a row. Duplessis died in office in 1959.

It was Lapalme&#x27;s second (and final) loss in a row as Liberal leader. The Liberals did not manage to improve on their performance in the previous 1952 election.

==Expansion of the Legislative Assembly and titles==
An Act passed in 1954 provided for the creation of the new electoral district of Jonquière-Kénogami for the next election, which was carved out from Chicoutimi and Lac-Saint-Jean. In 1955, a bill was passed designated members of the assembly as Members of Provincial Parliament or MPPs.

==Campaign==
The Liberals and the &quot;Union des électeurs&quot; pooled their resources to conduct a joint campaign against the UN in at least 50 ridings. They collaborated to such a degree that in February 1956 the Liberal MPP René Hamel had proposed a motion espousing social credit theory in the Assembly, and a joint rally was held in May 1956 in Shawinigan to mark that event. While the strategy was viewed within the parties as a means to maximize their strength in opposing the UN, the electorate tended to view it as being confusing, while the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; called it &quot;an irresponsible alliance&quot;. There were also Liberals in the old guard that wanted the UN to win.

The Liberals supported four UdE and two Nationalist candidates, respectively running as Liberals and Independents, of which none won:

:* on the Social Credit side, there were Réal Caouette (Abitibi-Est), Arthur Marcoux (Beauce), Urbain Lajeunesse (Îles-de-la-Madeleine) and Paul-Eugène Drolet (Portneuf), 
:* René Chaloult campaigned in the new riding of Jonquière-Kénogami, and came within 320 votes of winning. This would be his last campaign.
:* Pierre Laporte, director of the magazine &quot;L&#x27;Action nationale&quot; and previously parliamentary correspondent for &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, ran in Montréal-Laurier. He would later campaign and win as a Liberal candidate in a 1961 byelection in Chambly.

One observer noted, &quot;The Union Nationale’s strongly entrenched position could not be seriously challenged unless a united front was formed of all opposing groups.&quot; The UN chose to campaign on Quebec&#x27;s right to fiscal autonomy, the party&#x27;s accomplishments and the future of Ungava, while the Liberals&#x27; chances were restrained by their alliance with the UdE (while shutting out the &quot;Parti social démocratique&quot;), the choice of Chaloult and Laporte not to identify themselves as Liberal candidates, and the party&#x27;s tendency to side with Ottawa&#x27;s centralizing policies. The UN correctly assumed that Quebec voters, when given a choice, would prefer a nationalist policy over a social one.

<text>The 1952 Quebec general election was held on July 16, 1952, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent , led by Maurice Duplessis, won re-election, defeating the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Georges-Émile Lapalme.

This was the fourth time (and the third in a row) that Duplessis led his party to a general election victory.

The number of seats won by the Liberals, and their share of the popular vote, were considerably increased over the previous election in 1948.

==Campaign==
Thérèse Casgrain became the first female leader of a Quebec political party, heading the CCF.

Of the 92 races, 56 were two-way contests between the two major parties:

==Outcome==
Henri Groulx (Montréal-Outremont) was the first candidate to learn that he had been reelected, but he died within an hour of hearing the news. Georges-Émile Lapalme, who had lost his campaign to take Joliette, would subsequently win the Outremont byelection held on July 9, 1953.

There were two notable results that arose from the election:

:* From 1952 until the 1966 election, Frank Hanley (Montréal–Sainte-Anne) would be the only candidate outside the UN and Liberals to win a seat in the Legislature.
:* For the first time since the 1936 election, no party other than the UN and the Liberals received more than 1% of the popular vote. This would continue until 1966.

<doc id="516234" wikidata="Q1117837" url="?curid=516234" title="WWIII (album)">
<text>WWIII is KMFDM&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, released on September 23, 2003. It follows the common KMFDM practice of naming albums with five-letter words. This is KMFDM&#x27;s only release on Sanctuary Records. Lyrically, the album is very political. The songs primarily attack George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency, various US wars in the Middle East, and America&#x27;s foreign policy. The last track, &quot;Intro&quot;, introduces the members of the band. It was recorded in Seattle, Washington. The album&#x27;s first and eponymous single was featured in the game &quot;Saints Row: The Third&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;WWIII&quot; received mixed reviews. &quot;The News-Times&quot; called it a &quot;butt-rock masterpiece&quot;. David Jeffries of AllMusic said, &quot;The most frustrating thing about &quot;WWIII&quot; is that it&#x27;s so darn inconsistent&quot;.

<text>The Eagle River is a tributary of the Colorado River, approximately long, in west central Colorado in the United States.

It rises in southeastern Eagle County, at the continental divide, and flows northwest past Gilman, Minturn, Avon. Near Wolcott, it turns west, flowing past Eagle and Gypsum, and joins the Colorado at Dotsero, in western Eagle County.

Its flow ranges from in late summer of dry years to during spring runoff.

Acid mine drainage from the abandoned Eagle Mine has entered the river.

<doc id="516247" wikidata="Q3629091" url="?curid=516247" title="Attak">
<text>Attak is the eleventh studio album by German industrial band KMFDM, released on March 19, 2002 by Metropolis Records. The band&#x27;s first album following a three-year hiatus, it was the first to feature member Lucia Cifarelli and the last to feature member Tim Sköld.

==History==
The album was originally going to be titled &quot;Attaq&quot; and written in a Middle Eastern font, but was changed by Konietzko after the September 11 attacks, who explained that the band&#x27;s history with the Columbine shootings would have made the original title &quot;pretty fucking harsh&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Attak&quot; received mixed reviews. Bradley Torreano of AllMusic describes the album&#x27;s production as &quot;ugly&quot; and that it has a &quot;few songs that are way too long&quot; but still claims it has a &quot;few truly inspiring industrial metal anthems&quot;. Sonya Sutherland of The Michigan Daily is more positive of the album, stating its &quot;filled with subtle beat changes and progressive riffs every track on Attak is superior to the metal shit that’s being served up to the mainstream by the spoonful and reflects the true talent of these Deutschland musical heroes&quot;.

<doc id="516254" wikidata="Q3586414" url="?curid=516254" title="1948 Quebec general election">
<text>The 1948 Quebec general election was held on July 28, 1948, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent &quot;Union Nationale&quot;, led by Maurice Duplessis, won re-election, defeating the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Adélard Godbout.

This was the third time (and the second in a row) that Duplessis led his party to a general election victory.

It was Godbout&#x27;s third (and final) loss to Duplessis in a general election, and the second in a row. He had won one victory against Duplessis years earlier in the 1939 election. In this election, the Liberals fared particularly poorly, reduced to only 8 seats, although their share of the popular vote was around 36%.

==Adjustment of representation==
The Legislative Assembly was expanded from 91 to 92 members, as a consequence of Charlevoix—Saguenay no longer returning a joint member, separate members being elected from Charlevoix and Saguenay.

==Campaign==
The &quot;Union des électeurs&quot; fielded candidates in all 92 ridings, with 71 becoming, at minimum, three-way contests between them, the UN and the Liberals:

<doc id="516261" wikidata="Q2654550" url="?curid=516261" title="Rockingham Motor Speedway">
<text>Rockingham Motor Speedway is a former racing motorsport venue in Rockingham, Northamptonshire, England, United Kingdom, near the town of Corby. It hosted professional and club races, as well as testing, track days, driver training, exhibitions and conferences. It claimed to be Europe&#x27;s fastest racing circuit, and was the first banked oval constructed in Britain since the closure of Brooklands in 1939.

The venue entered administration in 2017 and hosted its final motor race in November 2018. In 2021, the facility was purchased by Constellation Automotive for £80million.

==History==
Construction of Rockingham started late in 1999, with the opening meeting planned for May 2001.

Rockingham Motor Speedway was constructed on a British Steel works &quot;brown field&quot; site as a banked oval with the intention of bringing the American oval racing across the Atlantic for the first time. The opportunity was taken to use the infield for further circuits.

After almost ten years of planning and 23 months of construction work, Rockingham opened for business on Monday 15 January 2001. It was formally opened by the Queen on 26 May 2001.

After the sale of the venue, Rockingham held a &quot;super send-off&quot; to mark its final day as a racing circuit on 24 November 2018. The circuit was sold to Rockingham Automotive Limited, who used the facility for vehicle storage and logistics. In mid-2021, Constellation Automotive who own brands such as Cinch, and We Buy Any Car purchased the site.

Since then, Constellation Automotive&#x27;s online car sales brand, Cinch, has used the circuit to film YouTube content, including car reviews and lap time challenges, titled on its channel as &#x27;Fast Laps&#x27;. Cinch Motoring Editor, Sam Sheehan, has driven cars ranging from the Hyundai i20N hot hatch to a road-legal track car produced by Spartan Motor Company.

Sheehan used the Spartan to set an overall lap record for Rockingham&#x27;s National Circuit on 26 May 2023, beating the previous fastest time of 1:14.20, set by a Palmer Jaguar JP1 prototype, by five-hundredths of a second.

==The circuit==

Rockingham had 13 configurations of track, which could be used for anything from touring cars to motorcycles to rally cars. The circuit was overlooked by the 6280 seat Rockingham Building, a steel-framed, glass-fronted grandstand building containing suites, offices, bars and kitchens, and by four grandstands. Together, the building and grandstands offered a total seating capacity of 52,000. The inner pit and paddock complex was accessed from the Rockingham Building via two pedestrian tunnels and there was a further spectator viewing area on top of the pit garages.

===The oval circuit===
The American-style banked oval circuit was wide and had a maximum bank angle of seven degrees and comprised four very distinct corners. Rockingham&#x27;s oval was unique in the UK and one of only two speedways in Europe (the other being Lausitzring). The oval circuit could also be converted to a road course layout for events by positioning temporary chicanes and curves both on the main area and apron of the circuit.

In early September 2001, the Champ cars came to Germany and England for the first time, to contest oval racing at the German 500 (kilometer, not miles) and the Rockingham 500, rounds of the 2001 CART season (Championship Auto Racing Teams) FedEx Championship Series. After the 11 September terrorist attacks and subsequent closing of airspaces, but with most equipment and personnel already being in continental Europe, the first ever German 500 was held under difficult circumstances. Unreliable weather and a bad crash of Alex Zanardi did not help, either.

The British round at the weekend of 20–22 September was in jeopardy, too. However, the logistics were worked out, with many of the teams stripping off their sponsors&#x27; logos (&quot;livery&quot;) as a mark of respect for the victims of the attacks. The race distance was also shortened to 300 km. Victory was snatched on the exit of Turn Four of the last lap by Gil de Ferran driving the Marlboro Team Penske Honda–powered Reynard 01I at a race average speed of from Kenny Bräck at the wheel of the Team Rahal Lola-Ford Cosworth B1/00, and the Newman-Haas Racing Lola-Toyota B1/00 driven by Cristiano da Matta. The fastest lap, and therefore outright lap record, was set by Patrick Carpentier in 25.551secs () in the Player&#x27;s Forsythe Racing Reynard-Cosworth. Carpentier became for first Canadian to ever hold the outright lap record at an English circuit.

The US-based series returned in September 2002. This was the last time Champ Cars raced at this facility. The race ran over the full distance of 500 km, Scotland&#x27;s Dario Franchitti took the chequered flag in his Team KOOL Green Lola-Honda, beating Cristiano da Matta by just 0.986 of a second .

===The International Super Sportscar Circuit (ISSC)===
The ISSC was long and between wide, with a maximum bank angle of seven degrees at turn one. Rockingham&#x27;s International Super Sportscar Circuit was used by the Dunlop MSA British Touring Car Championship, as well as for most other car race events. The circuit combined long straights, sweeping high-speed bends (including the infamous Turn 1 and Gracelands) with a lower speed, highly technical infield layout. Average lap speeds around the circuit ranged from 1m 24s in the BTCC to 1m 12s in British F3.

===Wet handling facility===
The site had a wet handling area with a kick plate which was used to simulate a variety of driving conditions including ice, rain and slippery wet leaves. These different road conditions were simulated at much slower speeds than in normal driving and in a fully controlled environment. The area was designed to give drivers a greater understanding of the latest ABS, traction control and crash mitigating technologies, and the way that they affect vehicle control.

===Layout configurations===
==Lap records==

Rockingham is Europe&#x27;s fastest banked oval racing circuit, with the unofficial lap record for the oval set at 24.719 seconds by Tony Kanaan in his Lola B01/00 Champ Car on 22 September 2001 – an average speed of . Rockingham was the first purpose-built banked oval in the UK since Brooklands in 1907. It has an all-seating capacity of 52,000 and has both an oval and a racing circuit. The fastest official race lap records at Rockingham Motor Speedway are listed as:

==Major racing results==
===CART Championship===
+ Race shortened due to lack of practice.
===British Formula Three season===
===British Touring Car Championship===


===British Superbike Championship===

+ Qualification cancelled due to dangerous track conditions, grid decided by championship positions.

===Other events===
===The Rockingham Stages===
On 12 December 2004, the first Stage Rally, the Rockingham Stages, was held at the venue. This was jointly promoted by Middlesex County Automobile Club and Thame Motorsport Club. The two day event rapidly grew to be one of the favourite events on the British stage rally calendar. For several years it was a round of the MSN (Motor Sports News) Circuit Rally Championship. The 2018 Rockingham Stages was the last competitive motorsport event to be held at the Speedway.


===Oval racing===

From 2001 to the end of 2007, Rockingham organised and funded American-style Stockcar racing on the oval. Originally known as ASCAR, the series changed name to &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, and then to SCSA (Stock Car Speed Association), before re-branding to the MAC Tools V8 Trophy for its final season in 2007. All cars were UK variants of the American &quot;ASA National-Tour&quot; Howe Racing chassis, running with either Ford, Chevrolet or Pontiac bodies. A change of circuit ownership for 2006 saw the end of promotion and funding for the series, and low grids in 2007 led the organising club (BRSCC) to amalgamate it with a road course series, and eventually to the demise of both championships before the end of 2008.

==Other activities==
The circuit was operational 357 days a year and the majority of events that took place at the venue were not motorsport competitions. Events ranged from manufacturer product launches to dealer training, track days and testing, and corporate and experience days.

The City Auction Group holds an auction weekly at the circuit.

The Learning Grid Rockingham Festival in the first week of July promotes science and engineering to school pupils.

The venue had a sizeable showground area which has hosted the following shows:

* The French Car Show
* The Site Equipment Demonstration (SED) Show
* Greenfleet
* The LCV Show
* Stobart Fest
* Japfest 2

===Magazines and newspapers===
The &quot;Telegraph&quot; and Fiat held a track day at Rockingham in 2012 and published a number of articles featuring the circuit. &quot;Autosport&quot; Caterham SP300R video review was made on the ISSC , and &quot;Car Magazine&quot; did a track test on the Nissan GT-R vs Porsche 911 Turbo in 2012 and a McLaren supercar group test in 2010 . Car Dealer magazine reviewed the BMW M5 at Rockingham and compared it with a Mercedes E63 AMG, a Lexus ISF, a Porsche Panamera and an Infiniti M35h . The circuit also features on the Pistonheads website with videos showing the Caterham SP300 R and the new Astra VXR. Chris Harris on &quot;Cars&quot; showcased the BAC Mono .

<doc id="516264" wikidata="Q3605364" url="?curid=516264" title="Adios (KMFDM album)">
<text>Adios is the tenth studio album released by German industrial band KMFDM. The album was originally conceived as the group&#x27;s parting shot to its longtime record label, Wax Trax! Records, but it ended up also signaling the break-up of KMFDM itself until the band reformed in 2002. Recorded in Seattle, Washington, this was the last album to feature En Esch and Günter Schulz, who both went on to form Slick Idiot. Following the break-up, founding member Sascha Konietzko created the band MDFMK, before reforming KMFDM in 2002 without Esch or Schulz.

The album was released on April 20, 1999, the same date the Columbine High School massacre took place. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the two perpetrators of the massacre, were both avid KMFDM fans. Eric Harris noted the coincidence of the album&#x27;s title and release date in his journal.

A digitally remastered reissue of &quot;Adios&quot; was released on May 8, 2007, along with the digitally remastered reissue of &quot;Symbols&quot;.

==Background==
The 1990s core of KMFDM (Sascha Konietzko, En Esch, and Günter Schulz) had reunited for the previous album, &quot;Symbols&quot;, and toured together along with fellow German industrial metal band Rammstein in 1997. The core line-up was joined on tour by John DeSalvo, Nivek Ogre, and Tim Sköld. &quot;Adios&quot; was written almost entirely by Konietzko and Sköld, who became an official member for the band&#x27;s final release with Wax Trax! Records. Schulz, who had done significant writing for the previous five albums, acted only as a studio musician, while Esch helped write only a pair of songs.
It was originally intended to be released in 1998 but was pushed back by the record label as the &quot;rarities&quot; compilation album AGOGO was offered up instead. KMFDM had already disbanded by the time of its eventual release.

==Release date controversy==
&quot;Adios&quot; was released on April 20, 1999, which coincided with the Columbine High School massacre and Adolf Hitler&#x27;s birthday. 
Although Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were big fans of the group, KMFDM released an official statement denouncing the violence, sympathizing with the victims and their families, and explaining that the band had no Nazi affiliations whatsoever.

==Reception==

&quot;Adios&quot; received positive reviews. Gina Boldman of AllMusic said of the album: &quot;KMFDM sound smoother yet maintain their emotive mayhem in all its glory.&quot; The staff of &quot;PopMatters&quot; called &quot;Adios&quot; a &quot;superb mix of the anarchaic fueled fury of the 80’s and a full awareness of what their genre has become.&quot; Remarking on the band&#x27;s then-disbandment, they further stated that KMFDM &quot;left us with something to remember them by.&quot; Amy Sciarretto of &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; said that &quot;Adios&quot; &quot;continues in the group&#x27;s grand tradition of techno-informed, industrial-fueled beat manipulation&quot;. She said the beats, guitars, and female vocals formed &quot;an electrifying chemistry&quot;, concluding, &quot;&quot;Adios&quot; is a satisfying sendoff for KMFDM and its legion of fans.&quot;

<doc id="516265" wikidata="Q2903687" url="?curid=516265" title="3-2-1 Contact">
<text>3-2-1 Contact is an American science educational television show produced by the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW, now known as Sesame Workshop). It aired on PBS from 1980 to 1988 and later ran on Noggin (a joint venture between the CTW and Nickelodeon) from 1999 to 2003. The show teaches scientific principles and their applications. Edward G. Atkins, who was responsible for much of the scientific content of the show, felt that the TV program would not replace a classroom but would encourage viewers to ask questions about the scientific purpose of things.

==History==

===Initial conception===
&quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot; was the brainchild of Samuel Y. Gibbon Jr., who had been the executive producer of the original &quot;The Electric Company&quot; for the CTW from 1971 to 1977. (Gibbon had left the CTW before &quot;Contact&quot;&#x27;s production officially began, though he was still credited as &quot;Senior Consultant&quot;.) The show was based on the original concept of &quot;The Curiosity Show&quot;, an Australian science-based children&#x27;s educational TV show that had been running since 1972. That program was hosted by Australian scientists Rob Morrison and Deane Hutton, who were consultants to The Children&#x27;s Television Workshop in the early planning stages of what became &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot;. CTW wanted to make a version using American scientists as presenters, but PBS did not think that middle-aged scientists would engage a young audience (despite the popularity of the format in Australia) and insisted that any science show be hosted/presented by young people. CTW eventually reworked the concept into &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot;.

===Seasons production===
The first season of 65 programs began airing January 14, 1980, on selected PBS member stations; it featured a cast of three college students who socialized and discussed science in an on-campus room known as &quot;the workshop&quot;. The show also used brief segments at the beginning of the show featuring a celebrity and/or famous character making a brief scientific statement. Some of the celebrities and/or characters who appeared were Robert Guillaume for &quot;Food/Fuel&quot; week; Sarah Jessica Parker, then performing in the Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot; for &quot;Hot/Cold&quot; week; cast members of &quot;Eight is Enough&quot; for &quot;Crowded/Uncrowded&quot; week; Donny Most and Ron Palillo for &quot;Fast/Slow&quot; week; Billy Barty and Carl Weathers for &quot;Big/Small&quot; week; Tim O&#x27;Connor and Felix Silla (and the voice of by Mel Blanc) from &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; for &quot;Near/Far&quot; week; Gene Wilder for &quot;Communication&quot; week, Arte Johnson, reprising a character from &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; for &quot;Growth/Decay&quot; week; Sha Na Na members Jon &#x27;Bowzer&#x27; Bauman and Screamin&#x27; Scott Simon for &quot;Noisy/Quiet&quot; week; Rita Moreno (who was part of &quot;The Electric Company&quot; cast for its entire run) for &quot;Forces&quot; week; the Harlem Globetrotters&#x27; Meadowlark Lemon and the cast of &quot;The White Shadow&quot; for &quot;Order/Disorder&quot; week; and Larry Wilcox of &quot;CHiPs&quot; for &quot;Surfaces&quot; week. The segment ended with a brief visual film similar to the Scanimate animations used on &quot;The Electric Company&quot; showcasing the big words of the week and their role in science. This season came to an end on April 11, 1980, and continued in reruns (or removed entirely from scheduling on some stations) for the following three years, as funding for additional episodes was not yet sufficient.

When production finally resumed for the second season, which premiered on October 17, 1983, the show presented a more realistic appearance, as the new cast convened in a suburban basement (these segments were shot at Reeves Teletape, which also housed &quot;Sesame Street&quot; at the time). The celebrity segments were discontinued and the science topic was introduced by a computer cursor which typed out the week&#x27;s topic and subtopic of the day, replacing the visual films used in the first season. This cast continued until October 18, 1985. Ozzie Alfonso was &quot;Contact&quot;″s new director and Al Hyslop its executive producer.

When the fifth season began on September 22, 1986, a third cast was introduced. However, unlike the previous casts, they did not meet in any specific setting; instead, they appeared in various taped and filmed segments. The show ended after seven seasons and 225 episodes on November 18, 1988, with reruns airing until September 27, 1992. Reruns resumed the next year on commercial television, with All American Television handling syndication.

A frequent segment of the show was &quot;The Bloodhound Gang&quot;, a series about a group of young detectives who used science to solve crimes. Episodes of the series needed to be run in regular sequence for understandable viewing, as many &quot;Bloodhound Gang&quot; mysteries were cut among two or three &quot;Contact&quot; episodes.

===International and school versions===

For a time in the mid-1980s, the program was co-produced with the French television network FR3 and featured several new French cast members in addition to the American cast. From 1982 to 1983 the program was aired in Spain with dubbed-over versions of the American original broadcasts, and some local add-ons with four Spanish cast members: Sonia Martínez, Luis Bollain, Fernando Rueda, and Marifé Rodríguez. Another Spanish version of the broadcast was aired from 1990 to 1992.

It was reported in 1984 that &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot; had an audience of over 7 million viewers and was broadcast in 26 countries including West Germany, France, Italy, and Spain making their own dubbed-over versions.

From September 1, 1991, to May 1, 1992, an edited version titled 3-2-1 Classroom Contact was produced, specifically for in-school viewing. It was hosted by either Stephanie Yu, Z. Wright, or both and used previously aired segments from the past series.

Broadcasters wanted children and schools to record and replay the episodes without being afraid of infringement of copyright violations.

==Magazine==
Three months before the show premiered, a print magazine of the same name that also focused on science was released. In 1985, the magazine absorbed some of the content of sibling publication &quot;Enter&quot; (which went out of print that same year), including reader submissions of computer programs written in the BASIC computer language as well as reviews of popular computer programs. The &quot;Enter&quot; section also contained a new feature called &quot;The Slipped Disk Show&quot;, in which a fictional disc jockey answered computer-related questions submitted by readers.

In 1987, the magazine began featuring content from another CTW production, &quot;Square One Television&quot;. Such content frequently took the form of a two-page comic strip, often parodying a popular show or movie of the time, with a math-related question at the end.

The &quot;Bloodhound Gang&quot; mysteries also made the leap to the magazine, but they were subsequently replaced with a series entitled The Time Team in September 1990. These stories found teenage characters Sean Nolan and Jenny Lopez traveling to different time periods in the past and future. Their surroundings and personal encounters were described with great detail, educating readers as to the customs of various cultures throughout history, and – on trips to the future – often pushing present day hot-button issues. For example, a 1993 story saw the duo traveling to what appeared to be a prehistoric forest, but near the end, they found a Brazil flag, a newspaper clipping from 1995, and a bulldozer at work: this was in fact a Brazilian rainforest being levelled.

In 1996, &quot;The Time Team&quot; was replaced by a comic serial, Cosmic Crew, which focused on the adventures of a group of teenagers and their robot butler in space. Their first story arc (which ran for more than a year) had them trying to figure out a series of riddles relating to places in the solar system in order to claim a treasure (which turned out to be a scholarship fund). Another story arc had a delinquent (who had been a villain in the first arc) join them in order to chase down a gang of other delinquents. Despite being effectively replaced, a few &quot;Time Team&quot; stories were run whenever there were gaps between installments of &quot;Cosmic Crew&quot;.

Many of the magazine&#x27;s cover stories involved current events, such as 1990s oil fires in the Middle East. In addition, the magazine offered a games section in which most of the games were related to the stories in the issue.

In 1996, CTW presumably concluded that faithful readers from the late 1980s and early 1990s had long since moved on, and the magazine began to reprint non-time-sensitive stories from years past. For example, a 1991 article on the geography of the Galápagos Islands – a subject relatively unchanging due to the islands&#x27; well-enforced ecologically protected status – could very well re-appear in an identical format a half a decade later.

Under Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (now known as Sesame Workshop), the magazine later became &quot;Contact Kids&quot;, removing the original reference to the television show. Production of the magazine was suspended indefinitely in 2001.

<text>The Fish River (Visrivier in Afrikaans, Fischfluss in German) is a river in Namibia. It is 650 km long, flowing from the Naukluft Mountains 150 km to the Hardap Dam near Mariental. From there the flow is entirely blocked, all further flow downstream coming from tributaries downstream from the dam. The flow of the river is seasonal; in winter the river can dry up completely. Despite this, the river is the site of the spectacular Fish River Canyon, a canyon 160 km long, and at points as much as 550 m deep.

The outflow of the Fish River joins the Orange River at the border with South Africa about 100 km from the Atlantic Ocean.

<doc id="516272" wikidata="Q3586413" url="?curid=516272" title="1944 Quebec general election">
<text>The 1944 Quebec general election was held on August 8, 1944 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The , led by former premier Maurice Duplessis, defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Adélard Godbout. This was the first Quebec provincial election in which women were allowed to vote, having been granted suffrage at the provincial level in 1941 (much later than what had been fully attained at the federal level in 1919).

This election marked Duplessis&#x27;s comeback after having defeated Godbout in the 1936 election and having lost to him in the 1939 election. Unlike in the 1939 election, when the alcoholic Duplessis was clearly drunk at numerous campaign rallies, &quot;le chef&quot; had benefited from the time he had spent in an American sanatorium in 1942-43, where he had sobered up, and in the 1944 election, Duplessis refrained from drinking.

The biggest issue during this election was provincial autonomy. In order to appeal to nationalist voters, Duplessis attacked the incumbent premier, claiming that he was not taking a strong enough stand against Ottawa. He mainly criticized Godbout for agreeing to transfer unemployment insurance from the province to the federal government. He also criticized the Rowell-Sirois Commission for its stance on unemployment insurance and equalization payments.

Another reason Duplessis won the election was by appealing to anti-Semitic prejudices in Quebec by making the false claim in a violently anti-Semitic speech that the Dominion government together with the Godbout government had made a secret deal with the &quot;International Zionist Brotherhood&quot; to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees left homeless by the Holocaust in Quebec after the war in exchange for Jewish campaign contributions to both the federal and provincial Liberal parties. By contrast, Duplessis claimed that he was not taking any money from the Jews, and if he were elected Premier, he would stop this plan to bring Jewish refugees to Quebec. To further push on the message, the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; handed out campaign pamphlets warning about the alleged plan to bring 100,000 Jewish refugees to Quebec, which featured a cartoon of the standard stereotype of an evil-looking, hook-nosed Jew handing bags of money to Godbout while in the background a vast horde of dirty, disreputable-looking, hook-nosed Jewish refugees were ready to descend on &quot;la belle province&quot;. Through Duplessis&#x27;s story about the plan to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees in Quebec was entirely false, his story was widely believed in Quebec, and ensured he won the election. Duplessis&#x27;s biographer Conrad Black argued that Duplessis was in no way personally anti-Semitic, but because the majority of Quebecois were at the time, Duplessis had merely used antisemitism to win the 1944 election. Duplessis won another three elections in a row, for a total of five terms of office (four consecutive), before dying in office in 1959.

In this wartime election, Godbout&#x27;s support for Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in the Conscription Crisis of 1944 may have contributed to his defeat.

The &quot;Bloc Populaire&quot; won four seats on an anti-conscription platform. More importantly, they siphoned off enough votes from the Liberals to deny them a second term. Even though the Liberals narrowly won the popular vote, massive vote-splitting with the Bloc Populaire allowed the Union Nationals to win a narrow majority of seats.

The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (predecessor of the New Democratic Party) won one seat. Party member David Côté was elected to the legislature, but in July 1945, he decided to sit as an independent.

==Redistribution of ridings==
An Act passed before the election increased the number of MLAs from 86 to 91 through the following changes:

<text>The 1939 Quebec general election was held on October 25, 1939, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Quebec Liberal Party, led by former premier Adélard Godbout, defeated the incumbent Union Nationale, led by Maurice Duplessis.

This was Godbout&#x27;s second non-consecutive term of office and his only victory out of four consecutive general elections opposing Duplessis.

The Action libérale nationale, which had won 25 seats in the 1935 election and then merged with the Quebec Conservative Party, was re-formed by Paul Gouin, who had split with Duplessis soon after the formation of the Union Nationale. However the ALN obtained only 4.5% of the vote and no seats. It soon disbanded. Also, a rump Conservative Party ran three candidates who won 0.2% of the vote and no seats. This party also disbanded.

==Redistribution of ridings==
An Act passed before the election reduced the number of MLAs from 90 to 86 through the following changes:

<text>The Municipal Stadium of Braga () is an all-seater football stadium located in Braga, Portugal, and the current home of Sporting Clube de Braga. It has a capacity of 30,286 spectators, making it the seventh largest football stadium in Portugal. The stadium was designed by Portuguese architect Eduardo Souto de Moura who was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize in part for this design.

Nicknamed &quot;A Pedreira&quot; (&quot;The Quarry&quot;), for being carved into the side of a hill at its south end, the stadium was built in 2003 as a venue for the UEFA Euro 2004.

==History==
The project to build a stadium was developed in 2000 by architect Eduardo Souto Moura. On 5 June, the program to build the new municipal stadium for the European championships in 2004 began, promoted by the municipal council of Braga. Between 2002 and 2003, the municipal stadium was built. A football game between Sporting Braga and Celta Vigo inaugurated the opening of the stadium on 30 December 2003.

The enormous rock moving process contributed heavily to the exorbitant final €200 million cost, when the estimated cost for the initial project was just 29.9 million euros. This made it the most expensive of the ten new stadiums built for Euro 2004, even more expensive than the Estádio da Luz (capacity: 64,642), Estádio do Dragão (capacity: 50,033) and Estádio José Alvalade (capacity: 50,095).

During the UEFA European Championship in 2004, it was the site of various matches including: the 13th game, between Group C teams Bulgaria and Denmark (18 June 2004) and the 23rd match between Group D teams Netherlands and Latvia (22 June 2004). This match marked the stadium&#x27;s last event during the UEFA championship in 2004, even as in October of the same year, the public work along the &quot;Avenida do Estádio&quot; was concluded.

On 27 January 2005, a dispatch was opened by the president of the IPPAR to classify the stadium as a national patrimony. In the same year, Eduardo Souto Moura received the Secil Prize from Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio, for his work on the municipal stadium. It was followed six years later by the Pritzker Prize. In 2006 the stadium won the Chicago Athenaeum International Architecture Award for the best new global design. A &quot;Financial Times&quot; article on Britain&#x27;s stadia referred to the municipal stadium as one of the four examples of &quot;beautiful grounds&quot;, noting that: &quot;There has been nothing in this country to match the architectural delight of Eduardo Souto de Moura’s stadium for Braga in Portugal, a breathtaking arena carved into the side of a rock face on the site of a former quarry.&quot;

In July 2007, Sporting Braga announced a three-year sponsorship deal with French insurance company AXA, which included a promotional change to the name of the municipal stadium by the club. Following this agreement, promoters and team officials began to refer to the municipal stadium of Braga as the Estádio AXA (&quot;AXA Stadium&quot;). However, the municipality (as landlord) clarified that the stadium had not been officially renamed, as this was a deal between its tenant and its partner. On 23 October 2009, the process to classify the stadium ran out, under terms of article 78 (decree 309/2009), but was prorogued on 23 October. As the principal tenant, Sporting Braga paid a monthly symbolic rent of for the use of the stadium but by 2023 the municipality, the owner of the stadium which was built for a total cost of 200 million euros including concomitant infrastructure, had started a process of selling it for 15 million euros to the club or to one of the club&#x27;s major shareholders.

==Architecture==
The stadium is situated in an isolated, urban area on the north flank of Monte do Castro, in the sporting park of Dume. The stadium was carved from the Monte do Castro quarry that overlooked Braga; stands were constructed on either side of the pitch, while one of the goal backdrops was carved from the rock walls of the quarry. The opposite goal backdrop is dominated by the city sprawl. Each stand is covered with a canopy-style roof and connected by dozens of steel strings, a design inspired by ancient South American Incan bridges. Movement between stands is accomplished through a plaza under the pitch.

==Events==
* The stadium plaza held the Minho Campus Party, a LAN party, in 2004.
* The Corrs performed at the stadium in 2004 on their Borrowed Heaven Tour.
* The outskirts of the stadium annually host the &quot;Enterro da Gata&quot;, a university festival that celebrates the end of the school year with multiple concerts and festivities, organized by the University of Minho.

===2004 European Championship===
The stadium hosted two Euro 2004 group stage matches, Bulgaria vs. Denmark and Netherlands vs. Latvia.
===Portugal National Team===
The following national team matches were held in the stadium.

<doc id="516290" wikidata="Q3379036" url="?curid=516290" title="Philip Livingston (1686–1749)">
<text>Philip Livingston (July 9, 1686February 11, 1749) was an American merchant, slave trader and politician in colonial New York. The son of Robert Livingston the Elder and elder brother of Robert of Clermont, Philip was the second lord of Livingston Manor.

==Early life==

Philip Livingston was the fourth child and second son of Robert Livingston and Alida (née Schuyler) van Rensselaer Livingston. He was born on July 9, 1686, in his father&#x27;s Albany, New York town house, at &quot;Elm Tree Corner&quot;, the intersection of State and Pearl Streets and one of early Albany&#x27;s principal crossroads. The name commemorates a legendary elm tree that reputedly was planted in 1735 by a young Philip Livingston in front of his father&#x27;s house on the northwestern corner. Something of an Albany landmark, the old elm was removed in June 1877.

At the time of Philip&#x27;s birth, his father was downriver in New York engaged in persuading Governor Dongan to grant a city charter to Albany. Philip was named for his maternal grandfather Philip Pieterse Schuyler.

Alida Livingston taught her children to read and write both English and Dutch. Philip spent a year with the Huguenot community of New Rochelle in order to learn French, in anticipation of a career as an Albany trader dealing with French Canada. Philip grew up learning the intricacies of business, and trade from his father, the most successful entrepreneur in the Hudson Valley. From 1707, he acted as his father&#x27;s unofficial deputy in the offices of clerk of the county and city of Albany. Philip Livingston is described as &quot;a handsome, gay &#x27;breaker of hearts&#x27;&quot;.

==Career==
===Merchant===
His parents relocated to Livingston Manor sometime prior to Philip&#x27;s marriage Catherine van Brugh in 1708. Philip and his wife took up residence in the Albany townhouse. From there he took over management of his father&#x27;s Albany enterprises. Philip Livingston began his mercantile career at the age of 23 after an apprenticeship with one of his Schuyler uncles in Albany. Later, he became a mercantile factor in his own right, trading furs with New York merchants such as Stephen DeLancey and Henry Cuyler. With vast land tracts and abundant water resources at their disposal, the Livingstons were well placed to recognize the importance of grain as a commodity New York could export. Robert Livingston built two gristmills on the Manor and Philip Livingston acted as his father&#x27;s agent buying grain in the Hudson valley and selling flour in New York or shipping it the British West Indies. His younger brother, Robert, served as his agent in New York City.

Early in his career, Philip Livingston surveyed land titles. In late 1719, he was licensed to practice law. In 1720 Philip was appointed one of the Commissioners for Indian Affairs. That same year Robert Livingston resigned the positions of Secretary for the Commission of Indian Affairs, and Town Clerk of Albany in favor of Philip. The appointment was confirmed by Governor Burnet. The position of Secretary to the Commission of Indian Affairs Robert put to good advantage in acquiring thousands of acres of unimproved land in the Mohawk Valley. In 1725, Philip was appointed to the Provincial Council, a position he held until his death.

Unlike his father, Philip preferred business to politics, and considered himself primarily a merchant. In 1724 he declined a seat in the assembly as he thought attending the legislature would hurt business.

Philip Livingston spent a good deal of time in New York city where he owned a townhouse on Broad Street. Livingston also owned ships and participated with his sons in lucrative privateering and Triangular Trade operations.

===Slave trade===
Philip Livingston inherited slaves from both his parents and in-laws. One of Robert Livingston&#x27;s earliest investments in 1690 was a half-interest in the &quot;Margriet&quot;, a slave ship that journeyed to Madagascar, Barbados, and Virginia to trade in slaves, sugar, and tobacco. Philip and his sons continued this lucrative trade. Philip traded extensively with the West Indies; in the 1730s and 1740s, he was one of New York&#x27;s leading importers of slave labor from the sugar islands.

Philip formed a company with his sons Philip and Pieter Van Brugh Livingston, called Philip Livingston &amp; Sons, New York. At first the Livingstons imported small numbers of slaves from Antigua and Jamaica. One of the most notorious open-air markets was along the East River at the end of Wall Street. In August 1733, Philip&#x27;s sloop &quot;Katherine&quot; returned with fifty blacks from Jamaica. In 1738, Philip bought a one-third share in a voyage to Guinea, where two hundred slaves were purchased and consigned to his son Peter Van Brugh and his partner in Jamaica. The ships also handled gold and ivory. The ship &quot;Oswego&quot; out of Jamaica, arrived in New York in August 1741, carrying a consignment of twelve African slaves. Slave ships continued to arrive in port despite the panic caused that summer by a so-called slave insurrection in the city. In 1749, the sloop &quot;Rhode Island&quot;, owned by the company Philip Livingston &amp; Sons, traded rum, tobacco and cheese for guns, cloth and ivory, which it then traded on the African coast for 124 slaves. In 1750 Livingston &amp; Sons had three vessels working the African coast. They also owned shares in the &quot;Stork&quot; and the &quot;Sarah and Elizabeth&quot;. When the &quot;Wolf&quot; docked in New York Harbor in May 1751, 66 slaves had survived the voyage out of 147 boarded.

One Livingston Manor tenant farmer, John Dykeman, was murdered in 1715 by his slave, Ben. Coming in the aftermath of the New York Slave Revolt of 1712, it was first thought to be part of another such uprising. But after a preliminary hearing conducted by Robert Livingston, Sr. and some county magistrates, it was determined that the murder was the sole act of a heartbroken, vengeful father: Dykeman had sold Ben&#x27;s daughter off the manor to one of Livingston&#x27;s kin in New York City.

===Lord of Livingston Manor===
Robert Livingston, first Lord of the Manor died on October 1, 1728. As Philip&#x27;s older brother Johannes had died in 1720, Philip succeeded as second Lord of Livingston Manor. He was well prepared, having assisted his father in the management of the estate. He increased the family&#x27;s real estate holdings and in 1743 establishing the colony&#x27;s first iron works at Ancram, named for a village in Scotland. Livingston Manor became an integrated agricultural, mercantile and industrial concern. However, business affairs kept him in Albany, where he was clerk of the county and city.

In 1737, he was appointed to the commission to set the boundary between Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

==Personal life==
In September 1708, Livingston married nineteen-year-old Catherine Van Brugh, the only child of Albany mayor Pieter Van Brugh. Three months later, the first of their eleven children was baptized in the Albany Dutch church. Livingston trained his sons for the mercantile profession, sending them into apprenticeship with merchant friends and correspondents in New York, London and Jamaica. The children were:

* Robert Livingston (1708–1790), the 3rd Lord of the Manor who married Maria Thong (1711–1765), a granddaughter of Gov. Rip Van Dam. After her death, he married Gertrude (née Van Rensselaer) Schuyler (b. 1714), daughter of Kiliaen Van Rensselaer.
* Pieter Livingston (b. 1710), who died young.
* Peter Van Brugh Livingston (1712–1792), who married Mary Alexander (1721–1767), the daughter of James Alexander and Mary Spratt Provoost.
* John Livingston (1714–1786), who married Catharine de Peyster (1724–1804), a granddaughter of the Mayor of New York City Abraham de Peyster.
* Philip Livingston (1716–1778), a signer of the Declaration of Independence who married Christina Ten Broeck (1718–1801), daughter of Albany Mayor Dirck Ten Broeck.
* Hendrick &quot;Henry&quot; Livingston (1719–1772), who lived and died in the Jamaica, West Indies.
* Sara Livingston (1721–1722), who died young.
* William Livingston (1723–1790), a signer of the United States Constitution and the first Governor of New Jersey, who married Susannah French (1723–1789) in 1745.
* Sarah Livingston (1725–1805), who married William Alexander, Lord Stirling (1726–1783), in 1748.
* Alida Livingston (1728–1790), who married Henry Hansen (d. 1758). After his death, she married Martinus Hoffman (1706–1772), a member of the Hoffman family and the father-in-law of New York State Senator Isaac Roosevelt.
* Catherine Livingston (1733–1807), who married Alderman John Lawrence (1721–1764) of New York in 1759. After his early death, Catherine, who did not have children, never remarried.

Philip Livingston died in New York on February 11, 1749. His body was transported upriver and buried at Livingston Memorial Church and Burial Ground in Livingston Manor.

===Philanthropy===
He donated 28 pounds sterling to Yale College in 1745 &quot;as a small acknowledgement of the sense I have for the favour and Education my sons have had there.&quot; The donation was used in 1756 by President Thomas Clap to establish the Livingstonian Professorship of Divinity. The Livingston Gateway at Yale stands in his honor.

<text>Post Office Limited, formerly Post Office Counters Limited and commonly known as the Post Office, is a state-owned retail post office company in the United Kingdom that provides a wide range of postal and non-postal related products including postage stamps, banking, insurance, bureau de change and identity verification services to the public through its nationwide network of around 11,500 branches. Most of these branch post offices (%) are run by franchise partners or by independent business people known as subpostmasters; Post Office Limited directly manages the remaining 1%, known as Crown post offices.

Since 2020, a public enquiry has been under way into the company&#x27;s actions which led to between 700 and 900 subpostmasters being wrongfully prosecuted for financial crimes, in what has been described by the Criminal Cases Review Commission as &quot;the biggest single series of wrongful convictions in British legal history&quot;.

==History==
Post Office branches, along with the Royal Mail delivery service, were formerly part of the General Post Office and, after the passage of the Post Office Act 1969, the Post Office, a statutory corporation. Post Office Counters Limited was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Post Office in 1987. The first managing director of Post Office Counters was John Roberts, who took up the post in 1987. A former civil servant, Richard Dykes, took over as managing director of Post Office Counters in September 1993. Dykes was succeeded in May 1996 by Stuart Sweetman, who continued to serve in that role until his retirement in November 2001.

As part of the Postal Services Act 2000, the Post Office statutory corporation was changed to a public company, Royal Mail Group, in 2001, and Post Office Counters Limited became Post Office Limited. In 2002, David Mills was appointed as chief executive of Post Office Limited, a newly created role. Mills stepped down at the end of 2005. His successor, Alan Cook, was appointed with the title of managing director in January 2006. Cook had previously been chief executive of National Savings &amp; Investments.

With declining mail usage, Post Office Limited had chronic losses, with a reported £102 million lost in 2006, raising concerns in the media regarding its ability as a company to operate efficiently. Minutes of a board meeting in April 2006 state that the company was insolvent and unable to meet its future debts. Plans to cut the £150m-a-year subsidy for rural post offices led to the announcement that 2,500 local post offices were to be closed during 2007.
In 2007, the government gave a £1.7 billion subsidy to Royal Mail Group so that it could turn a profit by 2011. This was to be used to invest across the whole network of Royal Mail, Post Office Limited, and Parcelforce. 85 Crown post offices were closed, 70 of which were sold to WHSmith. This followed a trial of 6 Post Office outlets in WHSmith stores. WHSmith was expected to make up to £2.5 million extra in annual profit. 2,500 sub-post offices closed between 2008 and 2009. Redundancy packages were provided from public funding (subpostmasters were paid over 20 months salary, roughly £65,000 each).

In 2010, David Smith succeeded Alan Cook as managing director. Smith had previously been managing director of Parcelforce, another Royal Mail subsidiary. In November 2010, the government committed £1.34 billion of funding up to 2015 to Post Office Limited to enable it to modernise the Post Office network.

As part of the Postal Services Act 2011, Post Office Limited became independent of Royal Mail Group on 1 April 2012. A ten-year inter-business agreement was signed between Royal Mail and Post Office Limited to allow post offices to continue issuing stamps, and handling letters and parcels for Royal Mail. The Act also contained the option for Post Office Limited to become a mutual organisation in the future. In April 2012, Paula Vennells was appointed as chief executive; she had been with Post Office Limited since 2007 as the network director. The first chair of the board of the new company was Alice Perkins, who had for a time led human resources management in the Civil Service. 

In February 2013, Post Office Limited announced it was planning to move around 70 of its Crown post offices into shops. This would reduce the Crown network, which it stated was losing £40 million a year, to around 300. In November 2013, the government committed an additional £640 million of funding for 2015 to 2018 to allow Post Office Limited to complete its network modernisation. In June 2015, the Post Office launched its own mobile virtual network operator service, Post Office Mobile. However, in August 2016 it decided &quot;to conclude the trial as the results did not give us sufficient confidence that mobile will contribute to our goal of commercial sustainability&quot;.

In January 2016, the Post Office announced plans to franchise 39 Crown branches and close 3 more. In April 2016, the Post Office agreed to hand over up to 61 more branches to WHSmith in a 10-year deal. The deal was condemned as &quot;blatant back-door privatisation&quot; by the Communications Workers Union. In January 2017, the Post Office announced it was to close and franchise another 37 Crown branches. In December 2017, the government agreed a £370 million funding deal for 2018 to 2021 to further modernise the Post Office network and protect rural branches. In June 2018, the Post Office agreed to acquire Payzone&#x27;s UK bill payment business after it was split from Payzone Ireland, to expand its bill payment network. In October 2018, the Post Office announced that 74 more Crown branches would be franchised to WHSmith, including the 33 branches already operating in the company&#x27;s stores under the 2016 agreement.

Perkins stood down as chair in July 2015 and was replaced in October of that year by Tim Parker, a businessman who had led and restructured a number of companies. He at first worked one-and-a-half days a week, reducing to two days a month in November 2017. Speaking in 2024, Parker described a business in &quot;deep crisis&quot;: 

In February 2019, the Post Office announced that Vennells would leave her role as CEO to become chair of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. It was subsequently confirmed that the new CEO would be Nick Read, who had held senior roles at several customer-facing businesses and had been CEO of the Nisa convenience store group. Read promoted &quot;click and collect&quot; services for retailers, alongside parcel drop-off services.

In February 2021, the Post Office agreed to sell its broadband and home phone services to Shell Energy and exit the telecoms market. The purchase price was around £80million, with around 500,000 customers transferring to the new provider.

Parker completed a second term as chair in September 2022. He was replaced in December by Henry Staunton, who had held senior board roles at a number of companies and had chaired WHSmith until June of that year. He was removed on 27 January 2024, following disagreements with the Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch on matters including the appointment of a new independent director.

In April 2024, CEO Read was &quot;exonerated of all the misconduct allegations&quot; in relation to claims made by a whistleblower, revealed in Parliament. This followed an investigation by an external barrister. Nigel Railton, previously CEO of Camelot UK, was appointed interim chair in May 2024 for a 12-month term.

In November 2024, as part of a strategic review led by Railton, the Post Office announced plans to franchise or close its remaining 115 Crown post offices, equating to around one per cent of the company&#x27;s retail footprint.

==Services==

As of March 2024 there were 11,805 post office branches across the UK, of which 115 were directly managed by Post Office Limited (known as Crown branches). The majority of other branches (9,250 in total) were agency branches, run either by franchise partners or by local subpostmasters (who may be members of the National Federation of SubPostmasters or the CWU Postmasters Branch). Of the remaining branches, 1,834 were outreach services – typically small, part-time branches, perhaps making use of a mobile van or a village hall – and 606 were &#x27;drop and collect&#x27; branches, focussing on pre-paid parcels and bill payments.

The Post Office rolled out the &#x27;ParcelShop&#x27; scheme in Summer 2019, allowing retail stores to accept Royal Mail Internet returns, in order to expand Post Office facilities.

In some villages an outreach service is provided in village halls or shops. There are also &quot;mobile post offices&quot; using converted vans which travel between rural areas.

===Postal services===

The Post Office provides information on services and accepts postal items and payment on behalf of the two collection and delivery divisions of Royal Mail Group, Royal Mail and Parcelforce, plus parcel services on behalf of Evri and DPD.

==== Royal Mail Group ====
Services provided include a variety of new ordinary and guaranteed services both for delivery within the United Kingdom and to international destinations. Postage stamps (including commemorative stamps and other philatelic items) are sold, while applications for redirection of mail are accepted on behalf of Royal Mail. Post Office Local Collect is a scheme whereby undelivered mail can be redirected at customer request to a post office for convenient collection. &quot;Poste restante&quot; mail can also be held for collection by people travelling.

==== Other couriers ====
Since March 2021, Post Office no longer works exclusively with Royal Mail Group and offers parcel services from third party couriers including Evri and DPD, at selected locations.

===Financial services===

The Post Office provides credit cards, insurance products, mortgages, access to high street banking services and savings through the Post Office Money umbrella brand which was launched in 2015. Most Post Office Money branded products are provided by Bank of Ireland (UK) plc with Post Office Limited acting as an appointed representative and credit broker. However, with the sale of the Bank of Ireland&#x27;s UK assets to Jaja Finance in 2019, Post Office branded Credit Cards are now issued by Capital One UK. Life insurance is provided in partnership with Neilson Financial Services 

===Branch banking===

Personal banking services are offered on behalf of a number of &quot;partner banks&quot; that the Post Office has agreements with. Although different services are available on behalf of different institutions, these may include cash withdrawals, paying in cash and cheques, and balance enquiries. Some post offices have cash machines, mainly provided by Bank of Ireland. Business banking services are also offered for customers of twenty different UK banks. 

===Bill payments===

A number of bill payments can be accepted on behalf of a variety of organisations including utilities, local authorities and others. These are in the form of automated payments (barcoded bills, swipe cards, key charging). The Santander Transcash system, which had been a Girobank service, enabled manual bill payment transactions, but this service was discontinued by Santander in December 2017.

===Directory enquiries===
Post Office also runs its own flat-rate 118 Directory Enquiries service (118 855). Mobile phone top-ups are also available in Post Office branches on behalf of all the major UK mobile networks.

===ID services===
A passport check-and-send service is available for passport applications, where the post office staff check that a passport application is filled in correctly and has an acceptable photograph accompanying it. The service is not affiliated with HM Passport Office. Check-and-send service is not guaranteed service. The Post Office also offer a photocard driving licence renewal service.

Selected branches issue International Driving Permits. In 2019, availability of this service was expanded from 89 to approximately 2,500 branches due to increased demand associated with the possibility of a &quot;no deal&quot; Brexit.

==Horizon scandal==
In April 2015, the BBC described a confidential report that alleged that the Post Office had made &#x27;failings&#x27; with regard to accounting issues with its Horizon IT system, which were identified by subpostmasters as early as 2000. The article claimed that an independent investigation by forensic accountants Second Sight had found that the Post Office had failed to identify the root cause of accounting shortfalls in many cases before launching court proceedings against subpostmasters. The shortfalls could have been caused by criminals using malicious software, by IT systems or by human error, the report said. An earlier article by the BBC had claimed that a confidential report contained allegations that the Post Office had refused to hand over documents that the accountants felt they needed to investigate properly, that training was not good enough, that equipment was outdated, and that power cuts and communication problems had made things worse.

In 2019, the Post Office was lambasted by the High Court for its &#x27;institutional obstinacy or refusal to consider&#x27; that its Horizon computer system might be flawed. The judge, Mr Justice Fraser, characterised this stance as &quot;the 21st-century equivalent of maintaining that the earth is flat.&quot; In spite of the court action against its subpostmasters, which was described by a judge as &quot;aggressive and, literally, dismissive&quot;, the Post Office&#x27;s chief executive Paula Vennells, who had in the meantime left the Post Office and taken up posts in the NHS and the Cabinet Office, was controversially awarded a CBE in the 2019 New Year Honours for &quot;services to the Post Office and to charity&quot;. On 19 March 2020 she was harshly criticised in the House of Commons, particularly by Kevan Jones, MP for North Durham, who said:

On 8 January 2024, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak&#x27;s spokesman said he would &quot;strongly support&quot; the Honours Forfeiture Committee if it decided to look at removing Vennells&#x27;s CBE appointment. Vennells issued a statement on 9 January 2024, stating that she would &quot;return my CBE with immediate effect&quot;. This had no formal effect, as only the monarch, on the advice of the Honours Forfeiture Committee, can annul honours. Vennells&#x27;s appointment as CBE was formally revoked by King Charles III on 23 February for &quot;bringing the honours system into disrepute&quot;.

<text>Interstate 285 (I-285) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway encircling Atlanta, Georgia, for . It connects the three major Interstate Highways to Atlanta: I-20, I-75, and I-85. Colloquially referred to as the Perimeter, it also carries unsigned State Route 407 (SR 407) and is signed as Atlanta Bypass on I-20, I-75, and I-85.

Because of suburban sprawl, it is estimated that more than two million people use the highway each day, making it one of the busiest Interstates in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and one of the most heavily traveled roadways in the US. During rush hour, portions of the highway slow, sometimes to a crawl.

==Route description==
I-285 is 8 to 12 lanes wide, with the northern part from I-75 to SR 400 to I-85 the most heavily traveled. One segment of the highway near Tom Moreland Interchange (a large, flyover highway interchange northeast of Atlanta colloquially called Spaghetti Junction) with I-85 widens to 18 lanes, including collector–distributor lanes. Exits are numbered clockwise, starting at the southwesternmost point at I-85 and ending just east of there where it meets I-85 again near Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

Between I-85 and I-20 in southwest Fulton County, I-285 is designated as the Bob A. Holmes Freeway (named after the member of the Georgia House of Representative), where I-285 heads north, and has an interchange with the Langford Parkway. Between I-20 in northwest Atlanta and I-75 near Cumberland Mall, it is designated as the James E. &#x27;Billy&#x27; McKinney Highway (named after the member of the Georgia House of Representatives) as it continues north and starts to curve to the east just west of the I-75 interchange.

The northern portion of I-285, east of the Cobb Cloverleaf (I-75 interchange) to Spaghetti Junction (I-85 interchange), is frequently called the Top End Perimeter. This section, which includes an interchange with SR 400 at exit 27 (frequently cited as the most dangerous intersections in Atlanta), is one of the busiest freeways in the US, handling about 250,000 cars per day and crossing through Cobb, Fulton, and DeKalb counties, with several interchanges (SR 141, SR 13, and I-85) bringing additional traffic to and from Gwinnett County. Through that stretch, the freeway expands from six or eight lanes to between 10 and 14  lanes.

While I-285 does not travel through Gwinnett County, the highway travels very close to the DeKalb–Gwinnett county line, and many major highways in Gwinnett County connect to I-285, with some prominent ones being US Route 78 (US 78), I-85, and SR 141. Major Gwinnett cities near I-285 are Peachtree Corners and Norcross.

From exit 25 to exit 27, I-285 is concurrent with US 19.

Much of Atlanta&#x27;s high-end commercial real estate has developed along I-285, particularly at the northwestern I-75 and the SR 400 interchanges. Notable buildings include the 35-story Concourse at Landmark Center in the Perimeter Center business district and the Cobb Galleria complex in the Cumberland area.

East of Spaghetti Junction, I-285&#x27;s direction switches from east to south, as it connects with the Stone Mountain Freeway at exit 39, and has an interchange with I-20 at exit 46, where I-285 starts to curve toward the southwest. At exit 52, it has an interchange with I-675 and heads straight west after the interchange with I-75 near the Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
A portion of the section between I-75 and I-85 on the south side of I-285 has been bridged with a new runway and taxiway of Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, one of only two Interstates in the nation (along with I-564 in Norfolk, Virginia) to have an underpass beneath a runway (underpasses for taxiways do occur elsewhere). Computer animations were developed prior to construction to simulate a jumbo jet touching down on the runway from a driver&#x27;s perspective. The entire highway within the tunnels is outfitted with stopped-vehicle sensors and fire detectors. Two electronic signs on either side of the tunnel can warn drivers if the tunnel is closed in an emergency. For in the southwest corner, I-85 occupies the median of I-285, yet the roadways remain separate.

Heavy trucks traveling through (but not into) Atlanta are required to bypass the city on I-285, as there is a well-signed and heavily enforced ban on through truck traffic along I-75, I-85, I-20, SR 400, and many other major Atlanta thoroughfares. As with highways just outside I-285, trucks are also prohibited from the far-left one or two lanes (except where there are left exits open to trucks).

The complete circumference of I-285 is covered by Georgia Navigator, Georgia&#x27;s intelligent transportation system (ITS). There have been 153 closed-circuit television traffic cameras, 26 electronic-message signs, and traffic-detection sensors installed in phases between 1999 and 2010 by the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT). Additionally, ramp meters are present at nearly all entrance ramps onto I-285, with the exception of the southeast section of I-285 and the major freeway-to-freeway connection ramps.

To many residents of Atlanta, the Perimeter defines a useful boundary to separate the Atlanta metropolitan area&#x27;s core from its surrounding suburbs. People distinguish a location as being inside or outside the Perimeter, sometimes abbreviated as ITP and OTP, a recent local neologism. This was also the rough boundary chosen by BellSouth for separating landline telephone exchanges in suburban area code 770 from the existing area code 404 in 1995. Generally, 404 is Atlanta itself and most suburbs inside the Perimeter, while 770 serves most of the suburbs outside the Perimeter.

The entire length of I-285 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation&#x27;s economy, mobility, and defense.

==History==
===Early history===
The route that became I-285 was first proposed by the Metropolitan Plan Commission, the predecessor agency to the Atlanta Regional Commission, in 1952, and added to the proposal that became the Interstate Highway System in 1955. At the time, much of the area through which the freeway now passes was still rural, but beginning to suburbanize, and the Interstate was initially intended to serve as a bypass of the city.

The first contract for I-285, a section in DeKalb County that included part of the then-cloverleaf interchange with I-85, was awarded in June 1958. The stretch between I-20 and East Ponce De Leon Avenue on the east side opened on August 24, 1968. The section between I-20 on the east side and US 23 opened in early September 1968. The last stretch of the route opened on October 15, 1969, in a ceremony officiated by then-Governor Lester Maddox. Construction of the Interstate cost $90 million (equivalent to $ in ), and the entire route was initially two lanes in each direction for its entire length.

I-285 was widened to eight lanes in multiple phases as part of the Freeing the Freeways program at a cost of $355 million (equivalent to $ in ). The first stretch to be widened was the Top End section between Paces Ferry Road directly west of the interchange with I-75 and Chamblee Tucker Road, which began in July 1976 and was completed in August 1978. The section on the south end between US 19/41 and the eastern I-20 interchange was widened between June 1978 and November 1979. The section between the eastern I-20 interchange and Chamblee Tucker road was widened between August 1980 and December 1982. Work on widening the stretch on the west side between I-85 and Paces Ferry Road began in September 1981 and was completed in August 1983. The final widening project was completed in 1989 with the completion of the reconstruction of the concurrent section with I-85.

The Top End section between I-75 and I-85 was expanded to 10 lanes in the mid-1990s by narrowing the lanes by and narrowing parts of the shoulders.

===Interchange modification projects===
Since its construction, most of the system-to-system interchanges on I-285 have been modified from their original configurations. Most of these were rebuilt or expanded during the Freeing the Freeways program.

The cloverleaf interchange with I-85 in DeKalb County, which had earned the nickname &quot;Malfunction Junction&quot;, was reconstructed into the present Tom Moreland Interchange configuration, commonly known as &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;, between January 10, 1983, and July 9, 1987.

The Emory Parrish Interchange, commonly known as the Cobb Cloverleaf, has been modified on multiple occasions. The first project, which took place in the late 1970s, constructed new mainline carriageways for I-285 traffic through the interchange, eliminating lefthand exits, and repurposed the original lanes into adjacent collector–distributor ramps. The next project, which took place in the mid-1980s, constructed a new flyover ramp between I-75 southbound and I-285 eastbound, and modified the connections between the interchange and the I-75 interchange to the north with Windy Hill Road with the addition of several new collector–distributor lanes and slip ramps to eliminate weaving. The original loop ramp that the flyover replaced, however, was left in place and remains in operation in the present day. The next modification occurred between 1996 and 1999 with the construction of the Cumberland Boulevard interchange on I-75 to the south. As part of this project, new collector–distributor ramps were constructed along I-75 between the Cobb Cloverleaf and the new interchange. In addition, the grading for a new flyover ramp from I-75 north to I-285 west to replace the existing loop ramp was constructed; however, no such ramp was ever constructed. The most recent modification, which took place between 2014 and 2018, added new access points to I-285 within the interchange for the Northwest Corridor Express Lanes.

The approximately stretch of I-285 that runs concurrent with I-85 was heavily modified in multiple projects between the early and late 1980s that included the construction of separate adjacent carriageways for I-85 and I-285 in an effort to eliminate weaving and the addition of several collector–distributor ramps serving other roads.

===Recent history===
Until 2000, the state of Georgia used the sequential interchange numbering system on all of its Interstate Highways. The first exit on each highway began with the number &quot;1&quot; and increase numerically with each exit. In 2000, GDOT switched to a mileage-based exit system, in which the exit number corresponded to the nearest milepost.

GDOT voted in September 2012 to raise the speed limit from on the entire freeway and, by 2013, to install electronic signs for variable speed limits north of I-20, to lower the speed limit when traffic or weather conditions warrant. This is intended to keep traffic moving at a reduced but steady speed, rather than suddenly braking drivers causing traffic to &quot;clot&quot; simply because other drivers are also braking (which causes unnecessary stop-and-go traffic).

In 2013, there were 26 fatal accidents on I-285, giving it the highest rate of such accidents per of any Interstate in the country.

==Future==
Since the 1970s, GDOT has planned an outer loop, which would be a roughly circumferential loop around the Atlanta metropolitan area. Under Governor Sonny Perdue, the plans were dropped from the Regional Transportation Plan, in favor of the expansion of the rural state road network outside of Atlanta. The state will instead widen portions of SR 20 north of the Atlanta metropolitan area, along a similar alignment to the Northern Arc.

GDOT broke ground in November 2017 on major improvements to the I-285/SR 400 interchange. The project includes collector–distributor roads along I-285 and SR 400, the addition of a diverging diamond interchange at SR 400 and Abernathy Road, and new flyover ramps. The project has total costs of $800 million and construction is expected to be complete in late 2020.

In January 2016, Governor Nathan Deal announced the major mobility investment program (MMIP), a collection of megaprojects planned around the state. The program includes the addition of express lanes on I-285 from I-20 (exit 10) across the north end of Atlanta to I-20 (exit 46). The program also includes reconstructing the interchanges with I-20.

The MMIP will construct two express lanes in each direction between Paces Ferry Road (mile 19) and Henderson Road (mile 35). This segment includes the addition of express lanes through major interchanges with I-75, SR 400, and I-85. Other projects will construct one express lane in each direction between I-20 (exit 10) and Paces Ferry Road, and from Henderson Road to I-20 (exit 46). The completion of all express lanes is planned in 2032.

On July 31, 2012, metro-area voters rejected the T-special-purpose local-option sales tax comprehensive transportation plan that was to be funded by an additional one-percent sales tax over a 10-year period. Among the projects included in the plan was a new exit on I-285 at Greenbriar Parkway on the southwest side of Atlanta (between present exits 2 and 5), as well as major reconstruction of interchanges at exits 27 (US 19/SR 400), 10 (I-20 west of Atlanta), and 33 (I-85 northeast of Atlanta).

==Exit list==

The following exits are listed clockwise from the southwest: going south to north, west to east, north to south, and east to west. An exception is that heading counterclockwise, exit 33 comes before exit 34.

















==In popular culture==
Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez became widely associated with I-285 after he got lost on it while trying to drive to a game. On August 19, 1982, Pérez, who had just received his first US driver&#x27;s license, decided to drive himself to Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium (where the Braves played their home games at the time), where he was scheduled to start that evening&#x27;s game against the Montreal Expos. He was unable to find the proper exit and circled the city several times before running out of gas and calling for help. When Pérez failed to arrive at the stadium by game time, the Braves called upon veteran pitcher Phil Niekro to make the emergency start. The Braves, who had been mired in a 2–19 slump, won the game, kicking off a 13–2 winning streak that carried the team to the National League West division title. The team subsequently made for Pérez a warmup jacket with the notation &quot;I-285&quot; in place of his uniform number. The humor of the incident was credited for helping to improve the morale of the team and breaking the losing streak.

Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti mentioned the interstate in his single &quot;Stop Breathing&quot;, on his second studio album, Whole Lotta Red

<text>Hillman was a British automobile marque created by the Hillman-Coatalen Company, founded in 1907, renamed the Hillman Motor Car Company in 1910. The company was based in Ryton-on-Dunsmore, near Coventry, England. Before 1907 the company had built bicycles. Newly under the control of the Rootes brothers, the Hillman company was acquired by Humber in 1928. Hillman was used as the small car marque of Humber Limited from 1931, but until 1937 Hillman did continue to sell large cars. The Rootes brothers reached a sixty per cent holding of Humber in 1932 which they retained until 1967, when Chrysler bought Rootes and bought out the other forty per cent of shareholders in Humber. The marque continued to be used under Chrysler until 1976.

==History==

===Origins===


In 1857 Josiah Turner and James Starley formed the Coventry Sewing Machine Company, and recruited skilled engineers from the London area to join them, one of whom was William Hillman. In 1869 the firm changed its name to the Coventry Machinists Company, and like many other manufacturers in the area embarked on producing velocipedes. In 1870 Hillman and Starley patented a new bicycle called the &quot;Ariel&quot; and by 1885 Hillman was a partner of the bicycle manufacturer Hillman Herbert and Cooper, producing a bicycle called the Kangaroo. Hillman&#x27;s new company soon established itself, and before the turn of the 20th century, Hillman was a millionaire. With wealth came the means to fulfil Hillman&#x27;s next ambition, to become a car producer. Hillman had moved into Abingdon House in Stoke Aldermoor near Coventry and decided that a sensible plan would be to set up a car factory in its grounds. In 1907 Hillman-Coatalen was founded by William Hillman with the Breton Louis Coatalen as designer and chief engineer. They launched the 24HP Hillman-Coatalen, which was entered into that year&#x27;s Tourist Trophy. The car was put out of the race by a crash, but it had made a splash. Coatalen left in 1909 to join Sunbeam and the company was re-registered as the Hillman Motor Car Company in 1910.

The first cars were large, featuring a 9.76-litre 6-cylinder engine or a 6.4-litre four. A smaller car, the 9 hp of 1913 with a 1357 cc side-valve four-cylinder engine, was the first to sell in significant numbers and was re-introduced after the First World War as the 11 hp, having grown to 1600 cc. The big seller was the 14 hp introduced in 1925, and the only model made until 1928. Following the fashion of the time a Straight Eight of 2.6 litres and Hillman&#x27;s first use of overhead valves came in 1928 but soon gained a reputation for big-end problems.

==Alumni==
William Hillman had six daughters and no sons. A daughter married John Black, managing director of Hillman, who left at the time of the Rootes takeover and went to Standard Motor Co. Another daughter married Maurice Wilks who left Hillman in the same period and eventually went to Rover Company.

== Hillman brand ==
===Rootes Group===

In 1928, Hillman fell under the control of the Rootes brothers and then merged with Humber. The Rootes brothers obtained further backing from Prudential Assurance during 1931 and brought their holding up to 60 per cent of Humber. Then, in stages, Hillman was switched to manufacturing small cars and became the best known brand within the Rootes empire alongside Humber, Sunbeam and, in the Rootes Group&#x27;s final decade, Singer.
The 1930s saw a return to side valves with a 6-cylinder Wizard first produced in April 1931 and, in 1932, inspired by the Rootes brothers, the first car to carry the Minx name. This had a 1185 cc four-cylinder engine and went through a series of updates in body style and construction until the end of the Second World War. In 1934 the Hillman Wizard &quot;65&quot; and &quot;75&quot; were replaced by the 2110 cc Hillman &quot;16 hp&quot; and 2810cc &quot;20/70&quot;, which lasted until 1936 when a new body design in the form of the 2576 cc Hillman &quot;Sixteen&quot; and the 3181 cc &quot;Hawk&quot; and &quot;80&quot;, all with side valve straight-six engines, were introduced. These later cars were also sold as Humbers.

After the war, the Minx was reintroduced with the same 1185 cc engine. It went through a series of models given Phase numbers and the Phase VIII of 1955 saw the arrival of an overhead-valve engine 1390cc, the Mk 8. The later 1956 Two Tone version of this model, the Mark 8A, was called the &quot;Gay Look&quot; and led to the advertising slogan &quot;As Gay as a Mardi Gras&quot;. A smaller car, the Husky with van like body and using the old side-valve engine, was also new for 1954. The floor pan of this model was later to form the basis for the Sunbeam Alpine, Sunbeam also being part of the Rootes empire. A complete departure in 1963 was the Hillman Imp using a Coventry Climax derived all alloy, 875 cc rear engine and built in a brand new factory in Linwood, Scotland. The location was chosen under government influence to bring employment to a depressed area. A fastback version, the Californian, and an estate re-using the Husky name were also made. A new car called the Hunter was introduced in 1966 with, in 1967, a smaller-engined standard version using the old Minx name. These are frequently given their factory code of &quot;Arrow&quot;, but this name was never officially used in marketing.

===Chrysler===
Chrysler had assumed complete control of Rootes by 1967, and the first new Hillman model whose development was financed by the American giant was the Avenger of 1970.

===Peugeot===
The Avenger and Hunter ranges were badged as Chryslers from 1976 until 1979, when Chrysler sold its European division to Peugeot. At this point, Hunter production was shelved and the Avenger was rebadged as a Talbot until it was finally withdrawn from sale at the end of 1981.

Hillman&#x27;s Ryton factory, which had assembled various Peugeot models for the European market, closed in 2007. The French company still owns the rights to the Hillman name.

<doc id="516297" wikidata="Q3586411" url="?curid=516297" title="1936 Quebec general election">
<text>The 1936 Quebec general election was held on August 17, 1936, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The &quot;Union Nationale&quot;, led by Maurice Duplessis, defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Adélard Godbout.

This marked the end of slightly more than 39 consecutive years in power for the Liberals, who had governed Quebec since the 1897 election.

This 1936 election had been called less than one year after the 1935 election after Liberal premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau resigned because of a scandal. He was replaced by Godbout as Liberal leader and premier.

This was Duplessis&#x27;s first term in office. After losing the subsequent 1939 election, he later won four more general elections in a row, and became the dominant politician of his time. It was also the &quot;Union Nationale&quot;&#x27;s first election, having been formed from a merger between the &quot;Action libérale nationale&quot; and the Quebec Conservative Party.

<doc id="516315" wikidata="Q654376" url="?curid=516315" title="Robert Pastorelli">
<text>Robert Joseph Pastorelli (June 21, 1954 – March 8, 2004) was an American actor.

After he acquired a reputation as a skilled character actor in the 1980s and 1990s, Pastorelli&#x27;s career went into decline after the death of his girlfriend under mysterious circumstances at his home in 1999. He died of a narcotic overdose in 2004. He was best known as Eldin in &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; (1988–1994), Johnny C. in &quot;Eraser&quot; (1996), and Hughey in &quot;Michael&quot; (1996).

==Early life==
Pastorelli was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the son of Ledo (&quot;Tally&quot;) Pastorelli, an insurance salesman and Dorothy (&quot;Dottie&quot;), an artist. His sister, Gwen Pastorelli, is an opera singer and a real estate agent.

He spent his childhood years in Edison, New Jersey, graduating from Edison High School in 1972. He initially intended a career as a professional boxer, but had to abandon the sport due to injuries sustained in a near-fatal high-speed car crash at the age of 19 (he later claimed that he had a &quot;near death&quot; incident at this time, and that he had experienced himself looking down from above upon his body in the hospital bed with his father at the bedside overcome with grief). He acquired a narcotic habit in his early twenties prior to his acting career that he overcame, but he would relapse throughout his later life.

==Theater career==
He entered the acting profession via New York City theater in the late 1970s after studying at the New York Academy of Theatrical Arts and the Actors Studio, financially maintaining himself by working as a bartender and a male exotic dancer. In 1977 he made his stage debut in a production of &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;. He also performed in productions of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, and &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;. Later in his career he performed at London&#x27;s South Bank theater in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in 2002.

==Hollywood==
In 1982 Pastorelli headed west to Los Angeles seeking opportunities in Hollywood. Spending the early 1980s employed in television bit-part appearances, he found a niche playing streetwise characters, appearing also in supporting roles in the cinema films &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; (1987) and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; (1987). His first substantial cinematic role came with &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (1990). His big break in television came with the role of the gruff but lovable house painter Eldin Bernecky on the series &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, which was a ratings hit, and he stayed with the show for seven seasons from 1988 to 1994. &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; producer Diane English was sufficiently impressed with his abilities that she worked with him to produce his first starring vehicle, the television sitcom &quot;Double Rush&quot; which lasted one season in 1995. Two years later, he starred in the American adaptation of the British detective series &quot;Cracker&quot; (1997–1999).

As his television career gained momentum Pastorelli&#x27;s opportunities in cinema roles increased: &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot; (1993); a career defining performance playing a demented serial killer in the 1993 murder mystery thriller &quot;Striking Distance&quot;; &quot;Eraser&quot; (1996), &quot;Michael&quot; (1996), and &quot;Modern Vampires&quot; (1998).

==Charemon Jonovich shooting==
On the evening of March 15, 1999, during an incident at his Hollywood home, Pastorelli&#x27;s 25-year-old girlfriend, Charemon Jonovich, was killed by a gunshot to the head. During the authorities&#x27; investigation that followed, Pastorelli testified that in the midst of an argument between the two of them, she suddenly produced a handgun and killed herself. The incident was investigated as an accident or suicide, and the Los Angeles Department of Coroner declared the cause of death undetermined.

==Final years==
Pastorelli was exonerated of responsibility for Charemon Jonovich&#x27;s death and received public expressions of sympathy within Hollywood and from the Los Angeles media, but his career went into noticeable decline afterwards. He appeared in two more cinema productions in small roles in the early 2000s as well as some minor supporting roles in television productions. He developed a friendship with Glenn Close towards the end of his career, and appeared alongside her in the television films &quot;The Ballad of Lucy Whipple&quot;, and in &quot;South Pacific&quot; in 2001. In 2002 he again appeared alongside her at London&#x27;s Royal National Theatre in a performance of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. In 2002 he co-founded the Garden State Film Festival. His posthumous final screen appearance was in the film &quot;Be Cool&quot; (2005).

==Death==
Pastorelli was found dead at the age of 49 at his home in the Hollywood Hills on March 8, 2004, from a narcotics overdose. The Coroner&#x27;s Office reported Pastorelli died of a &quot;fatal blood concentration of morphine&quot;. Pastorelli&#x27;s body was interred in the mausoleum at Saint Catharine&#x27;s Cemetery in Sea Girt, New Jersey.

<doc id="516316" wikidata="Q2420169" url="?curid=516316" title="New Brunswick Route 15">
<text>Route 15 is long and is in the southeastern corner of the province of New Brunswick. Starting at the north end of the Petitcodiac River Causeway, it loops around the city of Moncton on Wheeler Boulevard, then turns northeast from Dieppe to Shediac. From there, it turns east and bypasses Cap-Pelé crossing the Scoudouc River, then southeast to meet the Trans-Canada Highway at Port Elgin. The highway is a divided freeway from Moncton to just east of Shediac, where it remains a controlled-access highway until east of Cap-Pele.

== History ==
Route 15 only extended from Shediac to Strait Shores until the early 1970s, when the Shediac Four-Lane Highway (the first rural expressway in New Brunswick) was built from Dieppe to Shediac. Its construction was controversial, with critics alleging that it was only built to give Moncton-area politicians better access to their summer cottages in the Shediac area. A two-lane bypass of Shediac itself was built shortly afterward.

The Wheeler Boulevard was developed and constructed through the 1970s and 1980s, and was fully complete by 1989.

A two-lane bypass of Cap-Pele opened to traffic in 1998.

In 2012, a section of this highway between Moncton and Shediac was designated &quot;Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Highway&quot;.&#x27;

<doc id="516324" wikidata="Q5305924" url="?curid=516324" title="Minced oath">
<text>A minced oath is a euphemistic expression formed by deliberately misspelling, mispronouncing, or replacing a part of a profane, blasphemous, or taboo word or phrase to reduce the original term&#x27;s objectionable characteristics. An example is &quot;gosh&quot; for &quot;God&quot;, or &quot;fudge&quot; for &quot;fuck&quot;.

Many languages have such expressions. In the English language, nearly all profanities have minced variants.

==Formation==
Common methods of forming a minced oath are rhyme and alliteration. Thus the word &quot;&quot; can become &quot;&quot;, or &quot;&quot;. Alliterative minced oaths such as &quot;darn&quot; for &quot;damn&quot; allow a speaker to begin to say the prohibited word and then change to a more acceptable expression. In rhyming slang, rhyming euphemisms are often truncated so that the rhyme is eliminated; &quot;prick&quot; became &quot;Hampton Wick&quot; and then simply &quot;Hampton&quot;. Another well-known example is &quot;cunt&quot; rhyming with &quot;Berkeley Hunt&quot;, which was subsequently abbreviated to &quot;berk&quot;. Alliteration can be combined with metrical equivalence, as in the pseudo-blasphemous &quot;Judas Priest&quot;, substituted for the blasphemous use of &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;.

Minced oaths can also be formed by shortening: e.g., &quot;b&quot; for &quot;bloody&quot; or &quot;f&quot; for &quot;fuck&quot;. Sometimes words borrowed from other languages become minced oaths; for example, &quot;&quot; comes from the Dutch , meaning &#x27;soft dung&#x27;. The minced oath &quot;blank&quot; is an ironic reference to the dashes that are sometimes used to replace profanities in print. It goes back at least to 1854, when Cuthbert Bede wrote &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t give a blank for such a blank blank. I&#x27;m blank, if he doesn&#x27;t look as if he&#x27;d swallowed a blank codfish.&quot; By the 1880s, it had given rise to the derived forms &quot;blanked&quot; and &quot;blankety&quot;, which combined gave the name of the long-running British TV quiz show &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;. In the same way, &quot;bleep&quot; arose from the use of a tone to mask profanities on radio.

==History==
The Cretan king Rhadamanthus is said to have forbidden his subjects to swear by the gods, suggesting that they instead swear by the ram, the goose or the plane tree. Socrates favored the &quot;Rhadamanthine&quot; oath &quot;by the dog&quot;, with &quot;the dog&quot; often interpreted as referring to the bright &quot;Dog Star&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, Sirius. Aristophanes mentions that people used to swear by birds instead of by the gods, adding that the soothsayer Lampon still swears by the goose &quot;whenever he&#x27;s going to cheat you&quot;. Since no god was called upon, Lampon may have considered this oath safe to break.

Michael V. Fox says there are minced oaths in the Bible: the Hebrew words &quot;ṣᵉba’ot&quot; &#x27;gazelles&#x27; and &quot;’aylot haśśadeh&quot; &#x27;wild does&#x27; () are circumlocutions for titles of God, the first for either &quot;(’elohey) ṣᵉba’ot&quot; &#x27;(God of) Hosts&#x27; or &quot;(YHWH) ṣᵉba’ot&quot; &#x27;(Yahweh is) Armies&#x27; and the second for &quot;’el šadday&quot; &#x27;El Shaddai&#x27;. The New English Translation footnotes dispute this interpretation of the Hebrew.

The use of minced oaths in English dates back at least to the 14th century, when &quot;gog&quot; and &quot;kokk&quot;, both euphemisms for God, were in use. Other early minced oaths include for Jesus (1528).

Late Elizabethan drama contains a profusion of minced oaths, probably due to Puritan opposition to swearing. Seven new minced oaths are first recorded between 1598 and 1602, including &quot;&quot; for &quot;By God&#x27;s blood&quot; from Shakespeare, &quot; &#x27;slight &quot; for &quot;God&#x27;s light&quot; from Ben Jonson, and &quot; &#x27;snails &quot; for &quot;God&#x27;s nails&quot; from the historian John Hayward. Swearing on stage was officially banned by the Act to Restrain Abuses of Players in 1606, and a general ban on swearing followed in 1623. Other examples from the 1650s included &quot;&#x27;slid&quot; for &quot;By God&#x27;s eyelid&quot; (1598), &quot;&quot; for &quot;By God&#x27;s foot&quot; (1602), and &quot;&quot; for &quot;By God&#x27;s hooks&quot; (referring to the nails on Christ&#x27;s cross). In the late 17th century, &quot;&quot; meant &quot;oh God&quot;, and &quot;&quot; for &quot;By God&#x27;s bodkins [i.e. nail]s&quot; in 1709.

In some cases the original meanings of these minced oaths were forgotten; the oath &quot;&quot; (&quot;By God&#x27;s truth&quot;) came to be spelled &quot;&quot;. The oath &quot;&quot; and related &quot;Wounds&quot; changed pronunciation in the Great Vowel Shift, but the normal word &quot;wound&quot; did not (at least not in RP), so that they no longer sound like their original meaning of &quot;By God&#x27;s wounds&quot;.

==Acceptability==
Although minced oaths are not as strong as the expressions from which they derive, some audiences may still find them offensive. One writer in 1550 considered &quot;idle oaths&quot; like &quot;by cocke&quot; (by God), &quot;by the cross of the mouse foot&quot;, and &quot;by Saint Chicken&quot; to be &quot;most abominable blasphemy&quot;. The minced oaths &quot;&#x27;sblood&quot; and &quot;zounds&quot; were omitted from the Folio edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot;, probably as a result of Puritan-influenced censorship. In 1941, a United States federal judge threatened a lawyer with contempt of court for using the word &quot;darn&quot;. &quot;Zounds&quot; may sound amusing and archaic to the modern ear, yet as late as 1984 the columnist James J. Kilpatrick recalled that &quot;some years ago&quot;, after using it in print, he had received complaints that it was blasphemous because of its origin as &quot;God&#x27;s wounds&quot;. (He had written an article entitled &quot;Zounds! Is Reagan Mad?&quot; in the &quot;Spartanburg Herald&quot; for 12 June 1973, and also used &quot;zounds&quot; in June 1970.)

==Literature and censorship==

It is common to find minced oaths in literature and media. Writers sometimes face the problem of portraying characters who swear and often include minced oaths instead of profanity in their writing so that they will not offend audiences or incur censorship. One example is &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;, where publishers required author Norman Mailer to use the minced oath &quot;fug&quot; over his objections. Somerset Maugham referred to this problem in his novel &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; (1919), in which the narrator explained that &quot;Strickland, according to Captain Nichols, did not use exactly the words I have given, but since this book is meant for family reading, I thought it better—at the expense of truth—to put into his mouth language familiar to the domestic circle&quot;.

J. R. R. Tolkien pretends a similar mincing of profanity in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, stating in Appendix F of the novel: &quot;But Orcs and Trolls spoke as they would, without love of words or things; and their language was actually more degraded and filthy than I have shown it. I do not suppose that any will wish for a closer rendering, though models are easy to find.&quot;

<doc id="516327" wikidata="Q558332" url="?curid=516327" title="Michael Snow">
<text>Michael James Aleck Snow (December 10, 1928 – January 5, 2023) was a Canadian artist who worked in a range of media including film, installation, sculpture, photography, and music. His best-known films are &quot;Wavelength&quot; (1967) and &quot;La Région Centrale&quot; (1971), with the former regarded as a milestone in avant-garde cinema.

==Life==
Michael James Aleck Snow was born in Toronto on December 10, 1928. He studied at Upper Canada College and the Ontario College of Art. He had his first solo exhibition in 1957. Snow exhibited with the Isaacs Gallery in Toronto throughout the 1960s, becoming even more involved with the gallery upon his return to Toronto in 1971. In the early 1960s Snow moved to New York with his wife, artist Joyce Wieland, where they remained for nearly a decade. For Snow this move resulted in a proliferation of creative ideas and connections and his work increasingly gained recognition. He returned to Canada in the early 1970s &quot;an established figure, multiply defined as a visual artist, a filmmaker, and a musician.&quot;

His work has appeared at exhibitions across Europe, North America and South America. Snow&#x27;s works were included in the shows marking the reopening of both the Centre Pompidou in Paris in 2000 and the MoMA in New York in 2005. In March 2006, his works were included in the Whitney Biennial.

Snow&#x27;s first wife was fellow artist Joyce Wieland, whom he married in 1956. The couple moved to New York City in 1963, but they moved back to Toronto about a decade later and divorced in 1976. In 1990, he married curator and writer Peggy Gale, and they had one son. He was the uncle of filmmaker and video artist Su Rynard.

Snow died from pneumonia in Toronto on January 5, 2023, at the age of 94.

==Work==

===Films===
Snow is considered one of the most influential experimental filmmakers of all time. Annette Michelson, in writing about Snow, his 1967 film &quot;Wavelength&quot;, and his films in general, speaks of the impact of Snow&#x27;s films, placing viewers in a &quot;position to more fully understand the particular impact of Snow&#x27;s filmic work from 1967 on, to discern the reasons for the large consensus given&quot; to &quot;Wavelength&quot; when it was honoured with the Grand Prize at the 1967 Experimental Film Festival &quot;EXPRMNTL 4&quot; in Knokke, Belgium, and that &quot;&quot;Wavelength&quot;, [appears] as a celebration of the &#x27;apparatus&#x27; and a confirmation of the status of the subject, and it is in those terms that we may begin to comprehend the profound effect it had upon the broadest spectrum of viewers...&quot; &quot;Wavelength&quot; has been the subject of numerous retrospectives internationally. Film scholar Scott MacDonald says of Snow that &quot;[f]ew filmmakers have had as large an impact on the recent avant-garde film scene as Canadian Michael Snow, whose &quot;Wavelength&quot; is probably the most frequently discussed &#x27;structural&#x27; film.&quot;

&quot;Wavelength&quot; has been designated and preserved as a masterwork by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada and was named #85 in the 2001 &quot;Village Voice&quot; critics&#x27; list of the 100 Best Films of the 20th Century .

Snow&#x27;s films have premiered in film festivals worldwide and five of his films have premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). In 2000, TIFF commissioned Snow, along with Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg, to make a series of short films collectively titled &quot;Preludes&quot;, for the 25th Anniversary of the festival.

In his &quot;Village Voice&quot; review of Snow&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;*Corpus Callosum&quot;, J. Hoberman writes that Snow&#x27;s films are &quot;[r]igorously predicated on irreducible cinematic facts [and] Snow&#x27;s structuralist epics—&quot;Wavelength&quot; and &quot;La Région Centrale&quot;—[announce] the imminent passing of the film era. Rich with new possibilities, &quot;*Corpus Callosum&quot; heralds the advent of the next. Whatever it is, it cannot be too highly praised.&quot; &quot;*Corpus Callossum&quot; was screened at the Toronto, Berlin, Rotterdam, and Los Angeles film festivals amongst others. In January 2003, Snow won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association&#x27;s Douglas Edwards Experimental/Independent Film/Video Award for &quot;*Corpus Callosum&quot;.

===Music===
Originally a professional jazz musician, Snow has a long-standing interest in improvised music, as indicated by the soundtrack to his film &quot;New York Eye and Ear Control&quot;. As a pianist, he has performed solo and with other musicians in North America, Europe and Japan. Snow performed regularly in Canada and internationally, often with the improvisational music ensemble CCMC and has released more than a half dozen albums since the mid-1970s. In 1987, Snow issued &quot;The Last LP&quot; (Art Metropole), which purported to be a documentary recording of the dying gasps of ethnic musical cultures from around the globe including Tibet, Syria, India, China, Brazil, Finland and elsewhere, with thousands of words of pseudo-scholarly supplementary notes, but was, in fact, a series of multi-tracked recordings of Snow himself, who gave the joke away only in a single column of text in the disc&#x27;s gatefold jacket, printed backwards and readable in a mirror. One track, purported to be a document of a coming-of-age ritual from Niger, is a pastiche of Whitney Houston&#x27;s song &quot;How Will I Know.&quot;

Snow, with Richard Serra, James Tenney and Bruce Nauman, performed Steve Reich&#x27;s &quot;Pendulum Music&quot; on May 27, 1969 at the Whitney Museum of American Art.

===Other media===
Before Snow moved to New York in 1963, he began a long-term project that for six years would be his trademark: the Walking Woman. Martha Langford in &quot;Michael Snow: Life &amp; Work&quot; describes this work as employing a single form that offered an infinite number of creative possibilities, the figure itself perceived variably as &quot;a positive (a presence to be looked at) and a negative (an absence to be looked through).&quot; His 1962 work &quot;Four to Five&quot; consisted of a grid of photographs of the Walking Woman placed in Toronto streets and subway stations, inviting the viewer to consider how public space transforms the sculpture.

Langford identifies duality as a guiding principle in Snow’s work. By combining materials and methods Snow creates hybrid objects that often defy classification. A work which exemplifies Snow&#x27;s testing of stylistic boundaries is his 1979 installation &quot;Flight Stop&quot; (also titled &quot;Flightstop&quot;), a site-specific work in Toronto&#x27;s Eaton Centre mall, which looks like a sculptural representation of sixty geese, but is in fact an intricate combination of fibreglass forms and photographs of a single goose.

In 1982, Snow sued the corporate owner of the Toronto Eaton Centre for violating his moral rights by altering &quot;Flight Stop&quot;. In the landmark case Snow v Eaton Centre Ltd, the Ontario High Court of Justice affirmed the artist&#x27;s right to the integrity of their work. The operator of the Toronto Eaton Centre was found liable for violating Michael Snow&#x27;s moral rights by putting Christmas bows on the work.

Snow&#x27;s works have been in Canadian pavilion at world fairs since his &quot;Walking Women&quot; sculpture was exhibited at Expo 67 in Montréal. He was chosen to represent Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1970; this was the first solo exhibition held at the Biennale&#x27;s Canadian Pavilion. His bookwork &quot;BIOGRAPHIE of the Walking Woman / de la femme qui marche 1961-1967&quot; (2004) was published in Brussels by La Lettre vole. It consists of images of the public appearances of his globally famous icon.

&quot;Anarchive2: Digital Snow&quot; describes Michael Snow as &quot;one of the most significant artists in contemporary art and cinema of the past 50 years.&quot; This 2002 DVD was initiated by Paris’ Centre Pompidou and was produced with the support of la foundation Daniel Langlois, Université de Paris, Heritage Canada, the Canada Council, Téléfilm Canada and Montreal’s Époxy. It is an encyclopedia of Snow&#x27;s works across media, browsed in a manner inimitably and artfully created by Snow. Its 4,685 entries include film clips, sculpture, photographs, audio and musical clips, and interviews.

==Retrospectives and honours==

In 1993, The Michael Snow Project, lasting several months, was a multivenue retrospective of Snow’s works in Toronto exhibited at several public venues and at the Art Gallery of Ontario and The Power Plant. Concurrently his works were the subjects of four books published by Alfred A. Knopf Canada. Snow has shown internationally in both galleries and cinemas, including a retrospective of his work at the British Film Institute, London where his celluloid works were shown in the cinemas and his digital works in the gallery (The BFI Gallery). The project, titled &#x27;Yes Snow Show&#x27;, took place in 2009 and was co-curated by Elisabetta Fabrizi and Chris Meigh-Andrew.

In 1981, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 2007 &quot;for his contributions to international visual arts as one of Canada’s greatest multidisciplinary contemporary artists&quot;. In 2000 he was one of the seven first winners of the Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts.

In 2004, the Université de Paris I, Panthéon-Sorbonne awarded him an honorary doctorate. The last artist so awarded was Pablo Picasso.
In 2006, Lima&#x27;s Museum of Art (MALI) held a selective retrospective exhibition as well as a screening of his films in Peru, as part of the Vide/Art/Electronic Festival.

<text>Silvio Manfred Dante is a fictional character on the HBO TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, portrayed by Steven Van Zandt. He is the consigliere and right-hand man to Tony Soprano in the DiMeo crime family. John Magaro portrays a young Silvio Dante in the 2021 prequel film, &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;.

==Character biography==
According to &quot;The Sopranos, A Family History&quot;, Silvio was born in June 1957 in West Orange, New Jersey. His father was Joseph &quot;Beppo&quot; Dante, of Calabrian origin, a member of Knights of Columbus and mob soldier who was gunned down in 1959. Silvio was a childhood friend of Tony Soprano. His early criminal activity often involved Tony and Jackie Aprile Sr. His original career plan was to be a professional singer, but this dream never materialized.

Despite this, Silvio has maintained a connection to show business through ownership of numerous clubs in North Jersey over the years, and in backing aspiring young starlets who come up through his clubs. Silvio&#x27;s support was instrumental in ensuring Tony took over as capo following the death of his father. Through his association with the Soprano crew, Silvio formed friendships with Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero and Paulie &quot;Walnuts&quot; Gualtieri.

Silvio is one of Tony&#x27;s more level-headed associates. Where many of Tony&#x27;s men immediately become hot-headed and readily resort to violence, Silvio generally helps to mediate situations and gets along with everyone. He accompanies Tony to most of his &quot;sit-downs&quot;—formal meetings within the organization to resolve disputes. Because of this, Tony relies on Silvio to be a clear-headed thinker and someone he can trust.

It was Silvio who reported to Tony that Uncle Junior planned to murder Pussy Malanga in Artie Bucco&#x27;s restaurant and who was later entrusted with starting the fire which would ensure the original Vesuvio&#x27;s burnt down, therefore not ruining its reputation. In the short and bloody war of 1999 with the Junior Soprano crew, Silvio helped Tony to plan hits on Chucky Signore and Mikey Palmice and remained supportive when Tony revealed that he had been seeing a therapist.

Silvio is most often the one to quote Mafia rules and norms when a tough decision is to be made, even if he ends up disagreeing with Tony. Silvio&#x27;s move to consigliere once Tony becomes acting boss seems completely natural. Silvio remains Tony&#x27;s most reliable adviser and enforcer, only displaying his aggression in a small number of incidents. One such is when Fat Dom Gamiello makes a remark about the late Vito Spatafore, which implied that Carlo Gervasi was gay.

An enraged Silvio attacked Fat Dom by hitting him in the back of the head with a handheld vacuum and then holding his arms behind his back, which allowed Carlo to stab Dom repeatedly in the abdomen with a large kitchen knife. In poker, Silvio often becomes foul-mouthed and paranoid. Silvio likes to do an impression of Al Pacino, specifically a scene from &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, which his friends find amusing.

Silvio&#x27;s criminal interests include loan sharking and bookmaking but his day-to-day role is that of managing the Bada Bing, the most recent in a string of strip clubs that he has operated. &quot;The Bing&quot;, as it is often referred to, is one of the crime family&#x27;s major meeting spots, and doubles as a brothel. Silvio loves and cares about, and is a strong father to his teenage daughter Heather, whom he calls &quot;The Principessa&quot;. Silvio says that Heather disapproves of his profession, calling it &quot;degrading to women&quot;. Tony has said to him, &quot;You&#x27;re a good father.&quot;

When his daughter&#x27;s soccer coach was found to be involved with one of his young players, Silvio looked for vengeance but followed Tony&#x27;s decision to let the authorities deal with him. Apart from periodic instances of adultery—Christopher says during his intervention in &quot;The Strong, Silent Type&quot; that Silvio was &quot;fucking every slut you got working in the place&quot;—it can be said that he loves his wife, Gabriella Dante (played by Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s real-life wife Maureen Van Zandt), very much.

Silvio has a long record of executing traitors throughout the show, including Jimmy Altieri at the end of season 1, Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero in season 2 (in league with Tony and Paulie), and Adriana La Cerva in season 5. All were killed when they were discovered to have been cooperating—or, in the case of Altieri, suspected to have been cooperating—with the FBI in their ongoing investigation of the Soprano crime family. Like Tony and Paulie, Bonpensiero&#x27;s killing haunted Silvio. In Season 6, Silvio also carries out the execution of Burt Gervasi, garroting him after he discovers that he had been working with the Lupertazzi crime family.

Silvio&#x27;s judgment wavered when he realized Tony was positioning Christopher Moltisanti as an intermediary between himself and the rest of the organization because of Christopher&#x27;s and Tony&#x27;s blood ties. This was made most apparent when Paulie was arrested on a gun charge and Tony made Christopher acting capo of his crew in Paulie&#x27;s absence. Silvio responded by encouraging Gualtieri crew soldier Patsy Parisi to steal from the Esplanade construction site against Tony&#x27;s and Christopher&#x27;s orders.

Silvio also became embroiled in a conflict with Native American protesters over a Columbus Day celebration—something Tony saw as a distraction—and went so far as to get many of the family&#x27;s associates involved in a violent altercation with the protesters. Silvio found it hard to let the conflict die even once Tony had exhausted all avenues of winning the dispute. Silvio did not take this uncharacteristic behavior any further and although Tony noticed it, nothing became of it. Silvio got a chance to vent his frustration with Christopher at an intervention for his drug problems that ended with Christopher being violently put in his place by Paulie and Silvio. Since Christopher returned from rehab, his relationship with Silvio seems to have returned to their previous friendly association.

Silvio maintains a realistic relationship with Paulie Gualtieri, well aware of Paulie&#x27;s tight-fisted attitude towards money and dangerous tendencies. Silvio has remarked to Tony that they know that Paulie does not kick up his full amount. Silvio also tried to warn Paulie that his distractedness had been noticed when Paulie let his loyalties to the Soprano family waver, not long after Silvio&#x27;s own crisis of faith in Tony. Paulie and Silvio argued about this—Paulie had been harboring resentment toward Silvio since his illness got Paulie into the Pine Barrens fiasco. However, it was not long before Paulie returned his attention to staying in Tony&#x27;s good graces.

Silvio counseled Tony through difficult decisions about Richie Aprile, and his disputes with Ralph Cifaretto, Feech La Manna and Tony Blundetto. He is often forced to convince Tony to go against his impulses—something that he usually manages without setting off Tony&#x27;s hair-trigger temper. More often than not, when Silvio has something on his mind but will not speak about it, Tony often senses this and gets him to speak up.

When Tony ends up in a coma after being shot by his uncle in a fit of dementia, it falls upon Silvio to take the reins as acting boss of the Soprano family. At first, Silvio seemingly enjoys the job, and even feels a degree of regret that he did not accept an offer from the late Jackie Aprile Sr. to become the boss back in the late 1990s. His wife Gabriella prompts him to consider the possibilities of a permanent change.

His ambitions quickly subside when he feels the immense pressure of being boss and begins to have asthma attacks brought on by anxiety, as later alluded to by Tony when he says, &quot;All due respect, you got no fucking idea what it&#x27;s like being #1&quot;. As boss, Silvio dealt effectively with Paulie in a dispute over the split of profits from a heist Paulie had undertaken following a tip from Vito Spatafore. However, Silvio was indecisive in his handling of a dispute between Vito and Bobby Baccalieri over a collection route.

After his return to the more comfortable role of consigliere, Silvio again counseled Tony about contentious issues. When Vito Spatafore was outed to the organization, Silvio convinced Tony of the need to restrain his desire to &quot;give him a pass&quot; because of the effect it would have on the other captains&#x27; view of his leadership. When Tony responded with distasteful jokes about Bobby&#x27;s serious injury, a look from Silvio was enough to tell him he was being unfair.

When Vito came back from New Hampshire, Silvio said that there would be popular sentiment to get rid of him, but Tony initially decided to let Vito run a prostitution ring in Atlantic City. However, when Phil Leotardo confronted Tony about Vito being in New Jersey, Silvio and Tony both knew that they could not keep fighting with Phil over the issue and that if they wanted to keep the &quot;no show&quot; jobs, Vito would have to go. Silvio had always pushed for Vito to be taken care of and told Tony that it was the right move and not to beat himself up over the issue.

When Phil Leotardo and his men killed Vito (without permission from Tony), Tony told Silvio that it was not about Vito, it was about him. Silvio initially told Tony that they should go after one of Phil&#x27;s men but Tony was trying to avoid a war and instead decided to blow up Phil&#x27;s wire room in Sheepshead Bay.

Silvio and Carlo were at Satriale&#x27;s Pork Store later that day when &quot;Fat Dom&quot; Gamiello came by. Dom started making jokes about Vito&#x27;s homosexuality and implied that Carlo was homosexual. Silvio told Dom to leave, but when Dom continued his ridicule, anger got the best of the usually calm consigliere as he smashed his hand-held vacuum over Dom&#x27;s head and held him while Carlo stabbed him to death. A short time afterward, Tony came by the shop to see them. Silvio advised Tony not to enter, but he couldn&#x27;t stop Tony from finding Dom. Tony stormed out of the shop with Silvio right behind him telling Tony that &quot;When you kill a made guy, this is what happens.&quot;

In the episode &quot;Stage 5&quot; Silvio was out at lunch with Gerry Torciano, the man Phil Leotardo wanted to take over as boss of the Lupertazzi family, when one of Doc Santoro&#x27;s assassins killed Torciano. This outraged Tony, as Silvio could have been hurt during the altercation.

In the episode &quot;The Blue Comet&quot;, it is revealed that the Lupertazzi family has recruited Burt Gervasi to begin a rebellion against Tony. Burt goes to Silvio to join in a coup d&#x27;état against the boss, but Silvio responds by strangling him to death at his home a short time later. Eventually, Phil Leotardo has contracts put out on Silvio, Bobby Bacala, and Tony in order to incapacitate the leadership of the family. Shortly after Bobby is killed, while Patsy Parisi drives Silvio outside of the Bada Bing club, a car moves in front of them, with two men coming out shooting multiple times. Silvio tries taking a pistol off of the back seat, only to be shot in the back. Silvio manages to grab his pistol in time while Parisi holds them off. Parisi manages to defend them, but soon the two men begin to target Silvio more. He is shot once more in the chest, while Patsy runs into the woods, fleeing for his life. Afterward, Silvio is rushed to the hospital and placed in an intensive care unit.

Paulie later tells Tony that Silvio survived the assassination attempt but is in a coma. The doctors say that he is unlikely to regain consciousness. In the final episode, an emotional Tony visits the still comatose Silvio, whose fate is not mentioned further.

==Character origins==
&quot;Sopranos&quot; creator David Chase was impressed with Van Zandt&#x27;s humorous appearance and presence after seeing him induct the Rascals into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, and invited him to audition. Van Zandt, a guitarist best known for playing in Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band, had never acted before. He auditioned for the role of Tony Soprano, but both HBO and Van Zandt himself felt that the role should go to an experienced actor, so Chase decided to create a role specifically for Van Zandt. Van Zandt eventually agreed to star on the show as consigliere, Silvio Dante. His real-life spouse Maureen was cast as his on-screen wife Gabriella.

<text>The 1935 Quebec general election was held on November 25, 1935, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party led by Louis-Alexandre Taschereau was re-elected, defeating the &quot;Action libérale nationale&quot;, led by Paul Gouin, and the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Maurice Duplessis.

It was the fourth and final general election victory in a row for Taschereau, who had held office since 1920. He resigned less than seven months later due to a scandal.

The &quot;Action libérale nationale&quot; (ALN) was a newly formed party led by the son of former Liberal premier Lomer Gouin. It was established by former Liberals who had become dissatisfied with the party. The ALN and Conservatives formed an alliance, the &quot;Union Nationale&quot;, to contest this election. They merged after the election to become a single party, which soon became a dominant political force.

==Campaign==
===Nominations===
There were 208 candidates nominated, of which five subsequently withdrew:

:* Wilfrid Bullock (Ind-Liberal, Shefford)
:* Wilfrid Labelle (ALN, Iberville), thus allowing Lucien Lamoureux (Liberal) to be reelected by acclamation
:* Roy Sasseville and René Mercier (Ind-Liberals, Gaspé-Nord)
:* Arthur Arcand (Ind-Liberal, Montréal–Sainte-Marie), in favour of Gaspard Fauteux (Liberal)

All three candidates returned by acclamation were incumbents:

:* Lucien Lamoureux (Lib, Iberville)
:* Peter Bercovitch (Lib, Montréal–Saint-Louis)
:* Avila Turcotte (Lib, Richelieu)

===Distribution of candidates===

===Controversy in Terrebonne===
In Terrebonne, the election of Athanase David was contested on the ground that the ballot papers were not printed in the form prescribed under the &quot;Election Act&quot;. At the subsequent hearing, the judge ruled that all cast ballots were declared void. Immediately afterwards, the returning officer announced that, as this resulted in a 0-0 tie, he cast his deciding vote in favour of David.

The returning officer&#x27;s action was considered to have been without precedent anywhere in the world in countries with parliamentary-style legislatures. The Conservatives lodged an appeal, but the result was upheld by the Quebec Court of Appeal in April 1936. David would become the only member of the Assembly in Quebec history to be elected on only one cast vote.

<doc id="516352" wikidata="Q538867" url="?curid=516352" title="Nazca plate">
<text>The Nazca plate or Nasca plate, named after the Nazca region of southern Peru, is an oceanic tectonic plate in the eastern Pacific Ocean basin off the west coast of South America. The ongoing subduction, along the Peru–Chile Trench, of the Nazca plate under the South American plate is largely responsible for the Andean orogeny. The Nazca plate is bounded on the west by the Pacific plate and to the south by the Antarctic plate through the East Pacific Rise and the Chile Rise, respectively. The movement of the Nazca plate over several hotspots has created some volcanic islands as well as east–west running seamount chains that subduct under South America. Nazca is a relatively young plate in terms of the age of its rocks and its existence as an independent plate, having been formed from the breakup of the Farallon plate about 23 million years ago. The oldest rocks of the plate are about 50 million years old.

==Boundaries==

===East Pacific and Chile Rise===
A triple junction, the Chile triple junction, occurs on the seafloor of the Pacific Ocean off Taitao and Tres Montes Peninsula at the southern coast of Chile. Here, three tectonic plates meet: the Nazca plate, the South American plate, and the Antarctic plate.

===Peru–Chile Trench===
The eastern margin is a convergent boundary subduction zone under the South American plate and the Andes Mountains, forming the Peru–Chile Trench. The southern side is a divergent boundary with the Antarctic plate, the Chile Rise, where seafloor spreading permits magma to rise. The western side is a divergent boundary with the Pacific plate, forming the East Pacific Rise. The northern side is a divergent boundary with the Cocos plate, the Cocos–Nazca spreading centre.

The subduction of the Nazca plate under southern Chile has a history of producing massive earthquakes, including the largest ever recorded on earth, the moment magnitude 9.5 1960 Valdivia earthquake.

==Intraplate features==

===Hotspots===
A second triple junction occurs at the northwest corner of the plate where the Nazca, Cocos, and Pacific plates all join off the coast of Colombia. Yet another triple junction occurs at the southwest corner at the intersection of the Nazca, Pacific, and Antarctic plates off the coast of southern Chile. At each of these triple junctions an &quot;anomalous&quot; microplate exists, the Galapagos microplate at the northern junction and the Juan Fernandez microplate at the southern junction. The Easter Island microplate is a third microplate that is located just north of the Juan Fernandez Microplate and lies just west of Easter Island.

===Aseismic ridges===
The Carnegie Ridge is a and up to feature on the ocean floor of the northern Nazca plate that includes the Galápagos archipelago at its western end. It is being subducted under South America with the rest of the Nazca plate.

==Plate motion==
The absolute motion of the Nazca plate has been calibrated at east motion (88°), one of the fastest absolute motions of any tectonic plate. The subducting Nazca plate, which exhibits unusual flat slab subduction, is tearing as well as deforming as it is subducted (Barzangi and Isacks). The subduction has formed and continues to form the volcanic Andes Mountain Range. Deformation of the Nazca plate even affects the geography of Bolivia, far to the east (Tinker et al.). The 1994 Bolivia earthquake occurred on the Nazca plate; this had a magnitude of 8.2 formula_1, which at that time was the strongest instrumentally recorded earthquake occurring deeper than .

Aside from the Juan Fernández Islands, this area has very few other islands that are affected by the earthquakes resulting from complicated movements at these junctions.

==Geologic history==
The precursor of the Nazca plate, Juan de Fuca plate, and the Cocos plate was the Farallon plate, which split in the late Oligocene, about 22.8 Mya, a date arrived at by interpreting magnetic anomalies. Subduction under the South American continent began about 140 Mya, although the formation of the high parts of the Central Andes and the Bolivian orocline did not occur until 45 Mya. It has been suggested that the mountains were forced up by the subduction of the older and heavier parts of the plate, which sank more quickly into the mantle.

<doc id="516363" wikidata="Q1073961" url="?curid=516363" title="Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association">
<text>The Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA) is the national organization for Catholicism in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It was established in 1957 after a group of Chinese Catholics met in Beijing with officials from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Religious Affairs Bureau. It is the main organizational body of Catholics in China officially sanctioned by the Chinese government.

The organization is not recognized by the worldwide Catholic Church. The organization is controlled by the United Front Work Department (UFWD) of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party following the State Administration for Religious Affairs&#x27; absorption into the UFWD in 2018.

==History==
After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party sought for ways to bring religions in alignment with its ideology. While all religions were seen as superstitious, Christianity had the added challenge of being foreign.

Efforts were made by Chinese Protestants in May 1950 in a meeting with Premier Zhou Enlai. This resulted in the penning of the &quot;Christian Manifesto&quot; that condemned foreign imperialism and argued for building a Chinese Protestant church apart from foreign control. This was based in part on earlier Protestant missiological strategy of creating an indigenous church based on the so-called &quot;three-self principles&quot;: self-government, self-support, and self-propagation.

In December 1950, Chinese Catholics followed suit, with Father Wang Liangzuo in north Sichuan province, penning the &quot;Guangyuan Manifesto&quot; and signed by some 500 Catholics. It declared:

Other Catholic manifestos followed, such as the &quot;Chongqing Manifesto&quot; published in January 1951 with over 700 signatures. Similar to the Protestant &quot;Christian Manifesto&quot;, the Catholic manifestos spoke of the need for a &quot;three-self&quot; or &quot;three-autonomies&quot; (as it was translated into English), even though this was previously only part of the Protestant missiological literature and not discussed among Catholic missionaries. Premier Zhou Enlai met with Chinese Catholics and spoke of his appreciation for the sacrifices of the Catholic Church and its missionaries, and the need to remain united with Rome on spiritual matters. But he also encouraged the development of the &quot;three-self&quot;. Pope Pius XII issued &quot;Cupimus Imprimis&quot; (1952) and &quot;Ad Sinarum Gentes&quot; (1954) praising Chinese Catholics for their loyalty and underscoring the importance of martyrdom. &quot;Ad Sinarum Gentes&quot; additionally spoke out against the &quot;three-self&quot;, arguing that independence would make a church no longer &quot;Catholic&quot;.

In July 1957, 241 Chinese Catholics from all parts of China, including laity, priests, and bishops, convened a meeting in Beijing with officials from the CCP and the Religious Affairs Bureau. They approved the creation of the CCPA with Archbishop Ignatius Pi Shushi of Shenyang elected as president. By early 1958, the first Catholic bishops were illicitly appointed without reference to Rome or the Pope. In June 1958, Pope Pius XII issued &quot;Ad Apostolorum Principis&quot;, refusing to recognize any consecrations performed without prior Vatican approval. The question of consecrating bishops would be a major sticking point in Sino-Vatican relations ever since.

With the rise of the Anti-Rightist Campaign and the Cultural Revolution, all public religious activities came to an end and organizations like the CCPA were shut down. However, as Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s reforms enabled a restoration of religions in the 1980s, the CCPA once again became the official state-sanctioned organization for Catholicism in China. A sizable population of Chinese Catholics remain as part of the so-called &quot;underground church&quot;, seen as &quot;Vatican loyalists&quot;, and who boycott masses said by CCPA priests.

The CCPA does not recognize the proclamation of the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary by Pope Pius XII in 1950, canonizations from 1949 onward (e.g. the canonization of Pope Pius X), Vatican declarations on even well-established devotional piety (e.g. on the Sacred Heart of Jesus or on Mary as Queen), and the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). In practice, however, the Catholic Church in China uses Chinese translations of the documents of the Second Vatican Council, of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, of the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church (revised in 1997) and of the 1970 Roman Missal. These had at first to be imported from Taiwan and Hong Kong, but have been printed locally for some years.

In 1980, the CCP Central Committee approved a request by the United Front Work Department to create a national conference for religious groups. The CCPA was one of five such religious groups, which also included the Islamic Association of China, the Chinese Taoist Association, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, and the Buddhist Association of China.

In 2018, the CCPA&#x27;s parent organization, the State Administration for Religious Affairs, was absorbed into the United Front Work Department.

==Appointment of bishops==

In 1978, Pope Paul VI offered a special faculty that opened up the possibility of bishops in the underground church to appoint new bishops. This was particularly important during a time when the last Vatican-approved bishops occurred in the 1950s, three decades earlier. Peter Joseph Fan Xueyan, the Bishop of Baoding, in 1981 became the first to make use of this special faculty and consecrated three bishops without any prior approval from the Holy See. Pope John Paul II retrospectively gave approval for Fan&#x27;s actions, and gave further authority to Fan to consecrate more bishops without prior consent. However, given the dire situation of the Catholic Church in China, Pope John Paul II gave permission to five bishops belonging to the underground church and four bishops connected to the CCPA, all of whom were consecrated bishop between 1949 and 1955, the authority to appoint new bishops without prior approval. It was precisely in that period that bishops ordained according to CCPA rules began to request and obtain recognition from the Holy See.

In June 2007, fifty years after the establishment of the CCPA, Pope Benedict XVI made publicly available a letter to the Church in China underscoring the importance of unity and outlining a willingness to engage in &quot;respectful and constructive dialogue&quot; with Chinese bishops and government authorities. Following the letter, five new bishops associated with the CCPA were ordained in 2007, all with papal and Chinese government approval.

In September 2018, a provisional agreement was signed between the Vatican and the Chinese government that stipulated that China would recommend bishops for papal approval and that the pope had the ability to veto any recommendations. Pope Francis also recognized seven bishops of the CCPA who were previously not in communion with the Vatican. Some have raised concerns that the agreement would divide Catholics across China because it offers more control to the Chinese government. Among the most outspoken critics has been the Hong Kong cardinal Joseph Zen, who published an opinion piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; entitled &quot;The Pope Doesn&#x27;t Understand China&quot;, and asserting that this attempt at unifying the Chinese church will instead lead to the &quot;annihilation of the real Church in China&quot;. While the agreement has generally been recognized as far from perfect, it is also seen by Pope Francis as a step towards healing and the task of evangelization.

In October 2022, the agreement was renewed for another two years. In November 2022, the Vatican accused the Chinese government of violating the terms of the agreement.

==Theology==
Since its creation, the CCPA has put Chinese patriotism and the Catholic duty to fulfill one&#x27;s duty to the central government at the front of its theology. It also stresses its anti-imperialism and the need to mark a drastic change from the previous associations of the Catholic Church in China with colonialism and imperialism. In the Guangyuan manifesto, the church stated: &quot;We won’t let the Church be tainted by imperialism.&quot; The CCPA uses messaging such as &quot;Jesus was himself a labourer&quot; to argue that Chinese Catholics should make a stand as fellow labourers and willingly contribute to the good of the Chinese socialist state. The CCPA argues that there is an ideological harmony between socialism and Catholicism, and attributes socialist values to Pope Francis and other progressive clergymen.

The CCPA also pursues the policy of Sinicization, which is meant to reinforce the Chinese national identity and adapt the Catholic liturgy and sacred art to the traditional Chinese culture. Additionally, the Catholic teaching is interpreted in accordance with the Communist doctrine and in agreement with the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party. A bishop in the CCPA, Joseph Shen Bin, also remarked that Chinese Catholic theology uses &quot;core socialist values as guidance to provide a creative interpretation of theological classics and religious doctrines that aligns with the requirements of contemporary China’s development and progress, as well as with China’s splendid traditional culture&quot;.

The Vatican became increasingly conciliatory towards the Chinese government since Pope John XXIII and his Vatican II reform, allowing it to influence the teachings and stance of the CCPA. Initial efforts to reconcile with the CCPA were stalled by the Cultural Revolution, but contact was eventually established after Deng Xiaoping came to power, and further reconciliation took place under the papacies of John Paul II and Francis. Despite his conservative reputation, Pope John Paul II approved of the theologic message of the CCPA, stating: &quot;A genuine and faithful Christian is also a genuine and good citizen. A good Chinese Catholic works loyally for the progress of the nation, observes the obligations of filial piety towards parents, family and country.&quot;

In 2018, the Holy See released a statement further clarifying its stance towards the CCPA:
This statement resulted in some underground Catholic underground bishops stepping down from their posts and recognizing the CCPA authority, and Chinese Catholics who join the CCPA are not considered disloyal to the Vatican.

The CCPA is strongly supportive of Pope Francis, considering his theology to be very similar with the goals of the CCP - the CCPA emphasizes Pope Francis&#x27; support for the poor and condemnation of the free market economy. Liberation theology, which considers fascism and capitalism immoral, unlawful and evil and a means to oppress the poor, weak, sick and needy is also promoted, with Pope Francis&#x27; chapter &quot;The limits of capitalism&quot;, in which he equated capitalism with the promotion of selfish and unjust behaviour, seen as an endorsement of liberation theology. The CCPA also argues that Pope Francis seeks to free the Vatican from &quot;materialism and elitism&quot;, highlighting the Pope&#x27;s withdrawals of numerous honorary degrees and his criticism of using the social hierarchy of the Church for financial gain.

The religious message of Pope Francis is also connected to the Marxist notion of class struggle, while McQuillan and Park, writing on Pope Francis and his connection to Chinese Catholic theology, conclude: &quot;Pope Francis calls for an expanded role for government redistribution in efforts to alleviate poverty [but in doing so, he] also makes an unrelenting attack on capitalism.&quot; The CCPA promotes messages that depict Pope Francis as communist or communist-oriented, with some in the CCPA arguing that Pope Francis is an example of a &quot;good communist&quot;.

Some within the official Catholic Church also praise the CCPA and reflect its message. A Chinese priest of the official Church remarked that &quot;the Ten Commandments and the core socialist values are the same&quot;. He stated: 

Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, the chancellor Vatican&#x27;s Academy of Social Sciences, argues that the economic policies of the People&#x27;s Republic of China best represent the Catholic social teaching:

<doc id="516369" wikidata="Q3586409" url="?curid=516369" title="1931 Quebec general election">
<text>The 1931 Quebec general election was held on August 24, 1931, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Louis-Alexandre Taschereau, was re-elected, defeating the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Camillien Houde.

It was the third general election victory in a row for Taschereau, who had held office since 1920.

==Redistribution of ridings==
An Act passed in 1930 increased the number of MLAs from 85 to 90 through the following changes:


==Campaign==
The Liberals and Conservatives contested all 90 ridings, with 74 being two-way contests, and the remainder were three-way affairs.

==Aftermath==
The Conservatives initiated proceedings to attempt to quash up to 63 of the Liberal wins. In one of the hearings, Houde confessed that he had personally furnished $60,000 towards the effort, but did not disclose where he had gotten the funds from. In response, the Taschereau government passed the &quot;Dillon Act&quot;, which retroactively amended the laws governing the contesting of controverted elections, thus effectively gutting the ongoing actions. When the Union Nationale subsequently gained power after the 1936 election, one of its first measures was to repeal this Act and restore the law to what it was before its passage.

==Results==
This was the last election in which a candidate campaigned in multiple ridings. Camillien Houde was nominated in both Montréal–Saint-Jacques and Montréal–Sainte-Marie, and he lost both contests.

<text>Fluorescein is an organic compound and dye based on the xanthene tricyclic structural motif, formally belonging to triarylmethine dyes family. It is available as a dark orange/red powder slightly soluble in water and alcohol. It is used as a fluorescent tracer in many applications.

The color of its aqueous solutions is green by reflection and orange by transmission (its spectral properties are dependent on pH of the solution), as can be noticed in bubble levels, for example, in which fluorescein is added as a colorant to the alcohol filling the tube in order to increase the visibility of the air bubble contained within. More concentrated solutions of fluorescein can even appear red (because under these conditions nearly all incident emission is re-absorbed by the solution).
It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

== Uses ==

Fluorescein sodium, the sodium salt of fluorescein, is used extensively as a diagnostic tool in the field of ophthalmology and optometry, where topical fluorescein is used in the diagnosis of globe rupture, corneal abrasions, corneal ulcers and herpetic corneal infections. It is also used in rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting to evaluate the tear layer under the lens. It is available as sterile single-use sachets containing lint-free paper applicators soaked in fluorescein sodium solution.

The thyroxine ester of fluorescein is used to quantify the thyroxine concentration in blood.

Fluorescein is also known as a color additive (D&amp;C Yellow no. 7). The disodium salt form of fluorescein is known as uranine or D&amp;C Yellow no. 8.

Fluorescein is a precursor to the red dye eosin Y by bromination.

== Safety ==
Oral and intravenous use of fluorescein can cause adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting, hives, acute hypotension, anaphylaxis and related anaphylactoid reaction, causing cardiac arrest and sudden death due to anaphylactic shock.

Intravenous use has the most reported adverse reactions, including sudden death, but this may reflect greater use rather than greater risk. Both oral and topical uses have been reported to cause anaphylaxis, including one case of anaphylaxis with cardiac arrest (resuscitated) following topical use in an eye drop. Reported rates of adverse reactions vary from 1% to 6%. The higher rates may reflect study populations that include a higher percentage of persons with prior adverse reactions. The risk of an adverse reaction is 25 times higher if the person has had a prior adverse reaction. The risk can be reduced with prior (prophylactic) use of antihistamines 
and prompt emergency management of any ensuing anaphylaxis. A simple prick test may help to identify persons at greatest risk of adverse reaction.

== Chemistry ==

The fluorescence of this molecule is very intense; peak excitation occurs at 495 nm and peak emission at 520 nm. Values for the deprotonated form in basic solution.

Fluorescein has a p&quot;K&quot;a of 6.4, and its ionization equilibrium leads to pH-dependent absorption and emission over the range of 5 to 9. Also, the fluorescence lifetimes of the protonated and deprotonated forms of fluorescein are approximately 3 and 4 ns, which allows for pH determination from nonintensity based measurements. The lifetimes can be recovered using time-correlated single photon counting or phase-modulation fluorimetry. Upon exhaustive irradiation with visible light fluorescein decomposes to release phthalic and formic acids and carbon monoxide, effectively acting as a photoCORM. The remaining resorcinol rings react with singlet oxygen formed &quot;in situ&quot; to give oxidized, ring-opened products.

Fluorescein has an isosbestic point (equal absorption for all pH values) at 460 nm.
== Derivatives ==

Many derivatives of fluorescein are known. Examples are:
*fluorescein isothiocyanate 1, often abbreviated as FITC, features an isothiocyanate group (−N=C=S) substituent. FITC reacts with the amine groups of many biologically relevant compounds including intracellular proteins to form a thiourea linkage. 
*succinimidyl ester modified fluorescein, i.e. NHS-fluorescein, is another common amine-reactive derivative, yielding amide adducts that are more stable than the aforementioned thioureas. 
*Others: carboxyfluorescein, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester, Pentafluorophenyl esters (PFP), tetrafluorophenyl esters (TFP) are other useful reagents.

In oligonucleotide synthesis, several phosphoramidite reagents containing protected fluorescein, e.g. 6-FAM phosphoramidite 2, are used for the preparation of fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides.

The extent to which fluorescein dilaurate is broken down to yield lauric acid can be detected as a measure of pancreatic esterase activity.

== Synthesis ==
Approximately 250 tons were produced in the year 2000. The method involves the fusion of phthalic anhydride and resorcinol, similar to the route described by Adolf von Baeyer in 1871. In some cases, acids such as zinc chloride and methanesulfonic acid are employed to accelerate the Friedel-Crafts reaction.
== Research ==
Fluorescein is a fluorophore commonly used in microscopy, in a type of dye laser as the gain medium, in forensics and serology to detect latent blood stains, and in dye tracing. Fluorescein has an absorption maximum at 494 nm and emission maximum of 512 nm (in water). The major derivatives are fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and, in oligonucleotide synthesis, 6-FAM phosphoramidite.

=== Biosciences ===
In cellular biology, the isothiocyanate derivative of fluorescein is often used to label and track cells in fluorescence microscopy applications (for example, flow cytometry). Additional biologically active molecules (such as antibodies) may also be attached to fluorescein, allowing biologists to target the fluorophore to specific proteins or structures within cells. This application is common in yeast display.

Fluorescein can also be conjugated to nucleoside triphosphates and incorporated into a probe enzymatically for in situ hybridisation. The use of fluorescein amidite, shown below right, allows one to synthesize labeled oligonucleotides for the same purpose. Yet another technique termed molecular beacons makes use of synthetic fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides. Fluorescein-labelled probes can be imaged using FISH, or targeted by antibodies using immunohistochemistry. The latter is a common alternative to digoxigenin, and the two are used together for labelling two genes in one sample.
 
Intravenous or oral fluorescein is used in fluorescein angiography in research and to diagnose and categorize vascular disorders including retinal disease, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, inflammatory intraocular conditions, and intraocular tumors. It is also being used increasingly during surgery for brain and spine tumors.

Diluted fluorescein dye has been used to localise multiple muscular ventricular septal defects during open heart surgery and confirm the presence of any residual defects.

=== Earth sciences ===
Fluorescein is used as a rather conservative flow tracer in hydrological tracer tests to help in understanding of water flow of both surface waters and groundwater. The dye can also be added to rainwater in environmental testing simulations to aid in locating and analyzing any water leaks, and in Australia and New Zealand as a methylated spirit dye.

As fluorescein solution changes its color depending on concentration, it has been used as a tracer in evaporation experiments.

One of its more recognizable uses was in the Chicago River, where fluorescein was the first substance used to dye the river green on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day in 1962. In 1966, environmentalists forced a change to a vegetable-based dye to protect local wildlife.

Fluorescein dye solutions, typically 15% active, are commonly used as an aid to leak detection during hydrostatic testing of subsea oil and gas pipelines and other subsea infrastructure. Leaks can be detected by divers or ROVs carrying an ultraviolet light.

=== Plant science ===
Fluorescein has often been used to track water movement in groundwater to study water flow and observe areas of contamination or obstruction in these systems. The fluorescence that is created by the dye makes problem areas more visible and easily identified. A similar concept can be applied to plants because the dye can make problems in plant vasculature more visible. In plant science, fluorescein, and other fluorescent dyes, have been used to monitor and study plant vasculature, particularly the xylem, which is the main water transportation pathway in plants. This is because fluorescein is xylem-mobile and unable to cross plasma membranes, making it particularly useful in tracking water movement through the xylem. Fluorescein can be introduced to a plant&#x27;s veins through the roots or a cut stem. The dye is able to be taken up into the plant the same way as water and moves from the roots to the top of the plant due to a transpirational pull. The fluorescein that has been taken up into the plant can be visualized under a fluorescent microscope.

<text>The 1927 Quebec general election was held on May 16, 1927, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Louis-Alexandre Taschereau, was re-elected, defeating the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Arthur Sauvé.

It was the second general election victory in a row for Louis-Alexandre Taschereau, who had held office since 1920.

==Results==
Twelve Liberal MLAs were returned by acclamation, including one on the Island of Montreal. Taschereau himself was acclaimed in Montmorency, because of the alleged technical rejection of the Conservative candidate Lucien Drolet&#x27;s nomination papers. Drolet would later sue the returning officer over this.

The Liberals won back six of the Montreal seats they had lost in 1923. There was a controversy in Montréal–Saint-Louis, where the Conservative candidate Louis Fitch claimed that he had been subject to false arrest on Election Day.

Polling was deferred to May 23 in Gaspé. This was because weather conditions caused the closure of many roads in the area.

<doc id="516382" wikidata="Q1584928" url="?curid=516382" title="Harbourfront, Toronto">
<text>Harbourfront is a neighbourhood on the northern shore of Lake Ontario within downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Part of the Toronto waterfront, Harbourfront extends from Bathurst Street in the west, along Queens Quay, with its ill-defined eastern boundary being either Yonge Street or York Street. Its northern boundary is the Gardiner Expressway. Much of the district was former water lots filled in during the early 1900s to create a larger harbour district. After shipping patterns changed and the use of the Toronto Harbour declined, the area was converted from industrial uses to a mixed-use district that is mostly residential and leisure.

==History==

Toronto&#x27;s harbour has been used since the founding of Toronto for shipping and industrial purposes. The Town of York was founded to the west of the Don River, along the waterfront. When the town was founded, the water&#x27;s edge was approximately where today&#x27;s Front Street is located. Over time, the area south of Front Street to today&#x27;s water&#x27;s edge south of Queen&#x27;s Quay was filled in with landfill, creating piers and area for industrial development.

Prior to the 1972 federal election, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau announced the Harbourfront project, which would expropriate the industrial port lands from York Street west to Bathurst Street, south of Queen&#x27;s Quay and convert them to a cultural and residential district for Toronto, similar to the Granville Island district in Vancouver. The federal government has converted the industrial area to an area mixed with art galleries, performance spaces, boating areas and parks. The surrounding neighbourhood, formerly industrial has been converted by private land developers into a series of condominium towers overlooking the project and Lake Ontario.

From its beginnings as Harbourfront Corporation, a federal Crown Corporation established in 1972, Harbourfront Centre was formed on January 1, 1991, as a non-profit charitable organization with a mandate to organize and present public events and to operate a site encompassing York Quay and John Quay (south of Queens Quay West). Since its inception, Harbourfront Centre has been used by artists whose work would not normally be seen in commercial venues in an effort to foster new forms of arts and expression.

In July 2012, Waterfront Toronto began a major reconstruction of Queen&#x27;s Quay West, requiring the 509 streetcar to be replaced with buses for the duration of the construction. On October 12, 2014, streetcar service resumed on 509 Harbourfront route after an absence of over two years in order to rebuild the street to a new design. With the new street design, two auto lanes south of the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s (TTC) streetcar tracks were eliminated between Spadina Avenue and York Street in order to extend Harbourfront parkland to the edge of the streetcar tracks. The Martin Goodman Trail (a bicycle path), two rows of trees, benches and a wider pedestrian space are located on the immediate south side of the streetcar tracks.

==Character==

The area along the waterfront is composed of mixed uses. The federal government lands to the south of Queen&#x27;s Quay include a community centre, a Toronto Fire Services station, various boating uses, parkland and the Harbourfront Centre. To the north of Queen&#x27;s Quay, all of the industrial lands along the street have been replaced with high-rise condominium towers. To the east of the federal government lands, the waterfront is mixed with industrial uses, a hotel, ferry docks, boating uses, a sugar factory and vacant lands.

===Neighbourhood issues===
The neighbourhood is separated from the rest of downtown Toronto by the elevated Gardiner Expressway. A project to link Lower Simcoe with Simcoe Street via tunnel was completed to provide a new link between Harbourfront and downtown, though access between the waterfront and the core remains an issue. Proposals have been made to demolish the expressway in the area. One proposal was to demolish the highway east of Spadina Avenue. Another proposal, to demolish the highway from the Don River to Jarvis Street, is being actively studied by the City of Toronto.

Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, also known as Toronto Island Airport, presents other neighbourhood issues. The airport, located to the southwest of the neighbourhood, is opposed by local community groups and some city politicians, including Toronto&#x27;s past mayor, David Miller, as an impediment to the redevelopment of the waterfront lands. Another former mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, backed an expansion of the airport, as it created jobs. The airport, built in the 1930s, is utilized for regional air travel. The airport generates hundreds of noise complaints monthly to its operator, the Toronto Port Authority, now PortsToronto. The Toronto Port Authority confirmed on September 12, 2008, that Porter Airlines was fined for breaking noise curfews in its operations at the airport. In 2008, a study by the Port Authority was conducted seeking ways to reduce noise from Porter&#x27;s takeoffs and landings.

==Notable buildings and facilities==

Harbourfront is the site of the Jack Layton Ferry Terminal which provides transportation services to the Toronto Islands from the foot of Bay Street.

Captain John&#x27;s Harbour Boat Restaurant was also a ship moored at the Yonge Street slip and removed in 2015. Toronto Maritime Museum was relocated from Exhibition Place in 1997, but closed in 2003.

Harbourfront Centre, housing galleries and performance spaces is located at the foot of Lower Simcoe Street. Harbourfront houses four craft studios; ceramics, glass, metal and textiles. All studios began in 1974 and still operate, providing new craft artists with subsidized work spaces at the beginning of their careers. Harbourfront hosts an extensive program of arts and cultural events throughout each summer, including craft and artisan fairs, theatre and dance performances and musical concerts. A series of free concerts is staged at Harbourfront&#x27;s outdoor concert stage every weekend throughout the summer and in winter there is a free open-air ice rink.

Queen&#x27;s Quay Terminal, next to Harbourfront Centre, is a former warehouse converted into a mixed-use building including a shopping centre designed for high-end retailers, commercial office space, and a residential condominium development. Today, the mall houses some stores and restaurants, predominantly catering to tourists.

The Canada Malting Silos along the waterfront at the western edge of Harbourfront, are one of the last vestiges of the industrial past of the neighbourhood. The buildings were long ago abandoned by the company that built them, but a proposal for demolition was cancelled when the estimated cost for demolition rose into the millions of dollars. The site is also now considered a heritage site, and any development must conserve some aspect of the industrial past. Two proposals have been made, a Canadian music museum and a Toronto history museum have both been proposed for the site. Both proposals keep the silos, but demolish other buildings on the site. The silos are one two remaining silos in the area (see Victory Soya Mills Silos) and reminder of the past uses of the area.

To the south of the silos, Toronto&#x27;s Ireland Park was inaugurated in 2004. The site commemorates the men and women who were forced to flee Ireland during the Great Famine.

To the east of Harbourfront, at the foot of Jarvis Street, is the Redpath Sugar Refinery, which is both an active sugar refinery and a sugar production museum.

==Parks and open spaces==

Although Toronto has often been criticized for not having a dynamic and beautiful waterfront park, Harbourfront has a network of parks, open spaces and trails that allow residents and visitors to access the public realm. Parks and public spaces like HTO Park, the Martin Goodman Trail, the Yo-Yo Ma Music Garden, and the Toronto Waterfront WaveDecks at the foot of Spadina Avenue, Rees Street and Lower Simcoe combine to beautify the area and bring people to the water&#x27;s edge.

==Transportation==

The area is served by the Toronto streetcar system, with links to subway stations at Union, Spadina, and Bathurst. The 510 Spadina and 509 Harbourfront streetcar routes terminate at Union Station, travel underground along Bay Street, and surface through in the centre right-of-way lane on Queens Quay west. The streetcar route travels along Queen&#x27;s Quay in a separate right-of-way, either to the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) grounds, up to Spadina or to Bathurst, depending on day of the week and other factors.

The area is accessible from the Spadina Avenue, Yonge/Bay and Jarvis street off-ramps of the Gardiner Expressway.

The Toronto Island ferries operate from the City / Bay Street Docks at the foot of Bay Street (all ferries excluding &quot;Trillium&quot;) and the Yonge Street slip (&quot;Trillium&quot;).

==Climate==
Weather records are from Toronto Island Airport (Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport).

<text>Fluorescence spectroscopy (also known as fluorimetry or spectrofluorometry) is a type of electromagnetic spectroscopy that analyzes fluorescence from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light; typically, but not necessarily, visible light. A complementary technique is absorption spectroscopy. In the special case of single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, intensity fluctuations from the emitted light are measured from either single fluorophores, or pairs of fluorophores.

Devices that measure fluorescence are called fluorometers.

==Theory==
Molecules have various states referred to as energy levels. Fluorescence spectroscopy is primarily concerned with electronic and vibrational states. Generally, the species being examined has a ground electronic state (a low energy state) of interest, and an excited electronic state of higher energy. Within each of these electronic states there are various vibrational states.

In fluorescence, the species is first excited, by absorbing a photon, from its ground electronic state to one of the various vibrational states in the excited electronic state. Collisions with other molecules cause the excited molecule to lose vibrational energy until it reaches the lowest vibrational state from the excited electronic state. This process is often visualized with a Jablonski diagram.

The molecule then drops down to one of the various vibrational levels of the ground electronic state again, emitting a photon in the process. As molecules may drop down into any of several vibrational levels in the ground state, the emitted photons will have different energies, and thus frequencies. Therefore, by analysing the different frequencies of light emitted in fluorescent spectroscopy, along with their relative intensities, the structure of the different vibrational levels can be determined.

For atomic species, the process is similar; however, since atomic species do not have vibrational energy levels, the emitted photons are often at the same wavelength as the incident radiation. This process of re-emitting the absorbed photon is &quot;resonance fluorescence&quot; and while it is characteristic of atomic fluorescence, is seen in molecular fluorescence as well.

In a typical fluorescence (emission) measurement, the excitation wavelength is fixed and the detection wavelength varies, while in a fluorescence excitation measurement the detection wavelength is fixed and the excitation wavelength is varied across a region of interest. An emission map is measured by recording the emission spectra resulting from a range of excitation wavelengths and combining them all together. This is a three dimensional surface data set: emission intensity as a function of excitation and emission wavelengths, and is typically depicted as a contour map.

== Instrumentation ==
Two general types of instruments exist: filter fluorometers that use filters to isolate the light and fluorescent light and spectrofluorometers that use diffraction grating monochromators to isolate the incident light and fluorescent light.

Both types use the following scheme: the light from an excitation source passes through a filter or monochromator, and strikes the sample. A proportion of the incident light is absorbed by the sample, and some of the molecules in the sample fluoresce. The fluorescent light is emitted in all directions. Some of this fluorescent light passes through a second filter or monochromator and reaches a detector, which is usually placed at 90° to the incident light beam to minimize the risk of transmitted or reflected incident light reaching the detector.

Various light sources may be used as excitation sources, including lasers, LED, and lamps; xenon arcs and mercury-vapor lamps in particular. A laser only emits light of high irradiance at a very narrow wavelength interval, typically under 0.01 nm, which makes an excitation monochromator or filter unnecessary. The disadvantage of this method is that the wavelength of a laser cannot be changed by much. A mercury vapor lamp is a line lamp, meaning it emits light near peak wavelengths. By contrast, a xenon arc has a continuous emission spectrum with nearly constant intensity in the range from 300-800 nm and a sufficient irradiance for measurements down to just above 200 nm.

Filters and/or monochromators may be used in fluorimeters. A monochromator transmits light of an adjustable wavelength with an adjustable tolerance. The most common type of monochromator utilizes a diffraction grating, that is, collimated light illuminates a grating and exits with a different angle depending on the wavelength. The monochromator can then be adjusted to select which wavelengths to transmit. For allowing anisotropy measurements, the addition of two polarization filters is necessary: One after the excitation monochromator or filter, and one before the emission monochromator or filter.

As mentioned before, the fluorescence is most often measured at a 90° angle relative to the excitation light. This geometry is used instead of placing the sensor at the line of the excitation light at a 180° angle in order to avoid interference of the transmitted excitation light. No monochromator is perfect and it will transmit some stray light, that is, light with other wavelengths than the targeted. An ideal monochromator would only transmit light in the specified range and have a high wavelength-independent transmission. When measuring at a 90° angle, only the light scattered by the sample causes stray light. This results in a better signal-to-noise ratio, and lowers the detection limit by approximately a factor 10000, when compared to the 180° geometry. Furthermore, the fluorescence can also be measured from the front, which is often done for turbid or opaque samples

The detector can either be single-channeled or multichanneled. The single-channeled detector can only detect the intensity of one wavelength at a time, while the multichanneled one detects the intensity of all wavelengths simultaneously, making the emission monochromator or filter unnecessary.

The most versatile fluorimeters with dual monochromators and a continuous excitation light source can record both an excitation spectrum and a fluorescence spectrum. When measuring fluorescence spectra, the wavelength of the excitation light is kept constant, preferably at a wavelength of high absorption, and the emission monochromator scans the spectrum. For measuring excitation spectra, the wavelength passing through the emission filter or monochromator is kept constant and the excitation monochromator is scanning. The excitation spectrum generally is identical to the absorption spectrum as the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the absorption.

==Analysis of data==
At low concentrations the fluorescence intensity will generally be proportional to the concentration of the fluorophore.

Unlike in UV/visible spectroscopy, ‘standard’, device independent spectra are not easily attained. Several factors influence and distort the spectra, and corrections are necessary to attain ‘true’, i.e. machine-independent, spectra. The different types of distortions will here be classified as being either instrument- or sample-related. Firstly, the distortion arising from the instrument is discussed. As a start, the light source intensity and wavelength characteristics varies over time during each experiment and between each experiment. Furthermore, no lamp has a constant intensity at all wavelengths. To correct this, a beam splitter can be applied after the excitation monochromator or filter to direct a portion of the light to a reference detector.

Additionally, the transmission efficiency of monochromators and filters must be taken into account. These may also change over time. The transmission efficiency of the monochromator also varies depending on wavelength. This is the reason that an optional reference detector should be placed after the excitation monochromator or filter. The percentage of the fluorescence picked up by the detector is also dependent upon the system. Furthermore, the detector quantum efficiency, that is, the percentage of photons detected, varies between different detectors, with wavelength and with time, as the detector inevitably deteriorates.

Two other topics that must be considered include the optics used to direct the radiation and the means of holding or containing the sample material (called a cuvette or cell). For most UV, visible, and NIR measurements the use of precision quartz cuvettes is necessary. In both cases, it is important to select materials that have relatively little absorption in the wavelength range of interest. Quartz is ideal because it transmits from 200 nm-2500 nm; higher grade quartz can even transmit up to 3500 nm, whereas the absorption properties of other materials can mask the fluorescence from the sample.

Correction of all these instrumental factors for getting a ‘standard’ spectrum is a tedious process, which is only applied in practice when it is strictly necessary. This is the case when measuring the quantum yield or when finding the wavelength with the highest emission intensity for instance.

As mentioned earlier, distortions arise from the sample as well. Therefore, some aspects of the sample must be taken into account too. Firstly, photodecomposition may decrease the intensity of fluorescence over time. Scattering of light must also be taken into account. The most significant types of scattering in this context are Rayleigh and Raman scattering. Light scattered by Rayleigh scattering has the same wavelength as the incident light, whereas in Raman scattering the scattered light changes wavelength usually to longer wavelengths. Raman scattering is the result of a virtual electronic state induced by the excitation light. From this virtual state, the molecules may relax back to a vibrational level other than the vibrational ground state. In fluorescence spectra, it is always seen at a constant wavenumber difference relative to the excitation wavenumber e.g. the peak appears at a wavenumber 3600 cm−1 lower than the excitation light in water.

Other aspects to consider are the inner filter effects. These include reabsorption. Reabsorption happens because another molecule or part of a macromolecule absorbs at the wavelengths at which the fluorophore emits radiation. If this is the case, some or all of the photons emitted by the fluorophore may be absorbed again. Another inner filter effect occurs because of high concentrations of absorbing molecules, including the fluorophore. The result is that the intensity of the excitation light is not constant throughout the solution. Resultingly, only a small percentage of the excitation light reaches the fluorophores that are visible for the detection system. The inner filter effects change the spectrum and intensity of the emitted light and they must therefore be considered when analysing the emission spectrum of fluorescent light.

==Tryptophan fluorescence==
The fluorescence of a folded protein is a mixture of the fluorescence from individual aromatic residues. Most of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of a folded protein are due to excitation of tryptophan residues, with some emissions due to tyrosine and phenylalanine; but disulfide bonds also have appreciable absorption in this wavelength range. Typically, tryptophan has a wavelength of maximum absorption of 280 nm and an emission peak that is solvatochromic, ranging from ca. 300 to 350 nm depending in the polarity of the local environment Hence, protein fluorescence may be used as a diagnostic of the conformational state of a protein. Furthermore, tryptophan fluorescence is strongly influenced by the proximity of other residues (&quot;i.e.&quot;, nearby &quot;protonated&quot; groups such as Asp or Glu can cause quenching of Trp fluorescence). Also, energy transfer between tryptophan and the other fluorescent amino acids is possible, which would affect the analysis, especially in cases where the Förster acidic approach is taken. In addition, tryptophan is a relatively rare amino acid; many proteins contain only one or a few tryptophan residues. Therefore, tryptophan fluorescence can be a very sensitive measurement of the conformational state of individual tryptophan residues. The advantage compared to extrinsic probes is that the protein itself is not changed. The use of intrinsic fluorescence for the study of protein conformation is in practice limited to cases with few (or perhaps only one) tryptophan residues, since each experiences a different local environment, which gives rise to different emission spectra.

Tryptophan is an important intrinsic fluorescent (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of microenvironment of the tryptophan. When performing experiments with denaturants, surfactants or other amphiphilic molecules, the microenvironment of the tryptophan might change. For example, if a protein containing a single tryptophan in its &#x27;hydrophobic&#x27; core is denatured with increasing temperature, a red-shifted emission spectrum will appear. This is due to the exposure of the tryptophan to an aqueous environment as opposed to a hydrophobic protein interior. In contrast, the addition of a surfactant to a protein which contains a tryptophan which is exposed to the aqueous solvent will cause a blue-shifted emission spectrum if the tryptophan is embedded in the surfactant vesicle or micelle. Proteins that lack tryptophan may be coupled to a fluorophore.

With fluorescence excitation at 295 nm, the tryptophan emission spectrum is dominant over the weaker tyrosine and phenylalanine fluorescence.

==Applications==
Fluorescence spectroscopy is used in, among others, biochemical, medical, and chemical research fields for analyzing organic compounds. There has also been a report of its use in differentiating malignant skin tumors from benign.

Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (AFS) techniques are useful in other kinds of analysis/measurement of a compound present in air or water, or other media, such as CVAFS which is used for heavy metals detection, such as mercury.

Fluorescence can also be used to redirect photons, see fluorescent solar collector.

Additionally, Fluorescence spectroscopy can be adapted to the microscopic level using microfluorimetry

In analytical chemistry, fluorescence detectors are used with HPLC.

In the field of water research, fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to monitor water quality by detecting organic pollutants. Recent advances in computer science and machine learning have even enabled detection of bacterial contamination of water. 

In biomedical research, fluorescence spectroscopy is used to evaluate the efficiency of drug distribution through the cross-linking of fluorescent agents to various drugs. 

Fluorescence spectroscopy in biophysical research enables individuals to visualize and characterize lipid domains within cellular membranes.

<text>The 1923 Quebec general election was held on February 5, 1923, to elect members of the 16th Legislative Assembly of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Louis-Alexandre Taschereau, was re-elected, defeating the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Arthur Sauvé.

It was the first of four election victories in a row for Taschereau. However, he had held office since 1920, following the resignation of the previous premier, Lomer Gouin.

An Act passed prior to the election increased the number of MLAs from 81 to 85 through the following changes:


==Results==
This was the last Quebec election in which a candidate won in multiple ridings. Joseph-Édouard Perrault took both Abitibi and Arthabaska, and he would later resign from Abitibi to allow Hector Authier to be elected in a byelection later that year.

<text>Corrado John &quot;Junior&quot; Soprano Jr., portrayed by Dominic Chianese, is a fictional character from the HBO TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Usually referred to as &quot;Junior&quot; or &quot;Uncle Jun&quot; (pronounced “June”), he is the &quot;de jure&quot; boss of the DiMeo crime family for most of the series. A younger Corrado sometimes appears in flashbacks and is played by Rocco Sisto. Corey Stoll portrays a young Junior Soprano in the 2021 prequel film, &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;. Dominic Chianese&#x27;s performance as Junior received critical acclaim, garnering two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor In A Drama Series.

Junior is depicted as being intelligent, old-fashioned, stubborn and insecure about his power. Although Junior is portrayed as bitter and deceitful in season one, he shows a more considerate and humorous side of himself in the later seasons. He reveals a more sensitive aspect of his personality during his illness and house arrest. According to series creator David Chase, the name Junior was taken from one of his cousins. Chianese landed the role of Junior over Tony Sirico who played Paulie Gualtieri, and Frank Vincent who played Phil Leotardo.

==Background==
In Season One, it&#x27;s stated that Junior is 70 years old, placing his birth date in 1928 or 1929. Corrado Soprano, Jr. is the eldest of three sons of Corrado and Mariangela D&#x27;Agostino Soprano, who were from Ariano (an Italian town) and immigrated to the United States in 1911. Junior is the uncle of Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini). Junior had two younger brothers, Ercole &quot;Eckley&quot; Soprano and Giovanni “Johnny” Soprano. Eckley was intellectually disabled and lived in a mental institution for most of his life. Junior&#x27;s youngest brother was Tony&#x27;s father, Johnny Soprano. Both of his brothers died in the 1980s, meaning that he outlived both of them. He tells the court-ordered psychologist, when feigning mental incompetence, that he was getting a haircut when he heard about the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

He tells Tony that he admired John F. Kennedy but didn&#x27;t like his brother Robert because of the latter&#x27;s involvement with the United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management, as well as the prosecution of Jimmy Hoffa and investigation into the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Tony fondly recalls how as a child, Junior taught him how to play baseball and took him to New York Yankees games. Junior also apparently enjoys surfing. He recounts fondly teaching Tony body surfing on the Jersey Shore as a child, and purchases AJ a $400 surfboard for his birthday. 

Both Junior and Johnny dropped out of high school and turned to a life of organized crime, joining the DiMeo crime family. In the episode &quot;In Camelot&quot;, Junior Soprano reveals that he was on a date with Fran Felstein at the 500 Club in Atlantic City, New Jersey to see Enzo Stuarti perform when Fran met his brother Johnny. Junior was in love with Fran and wanted to propose, even buying a ring for her, but couldn&#x27;t allow a marriage to affect his status in organized crime or summon the courage to ask her.

Junior always watched over Tony, especially after Johnny&#x27;s death from emphysema in 1986. Junior guided Tony&#x27;s ascension into the crime family when Tony took over his father&#x27;s crew becoming the family&#x27;s youngest captain.

Following the arrest of longtime boss Ercole &quot;Eckley&quot; DiMeo in late 1995, Junior got into a trucking dispute with new acting boss Jackie Aprile Sr. (Michael Rispoli). He fled to Boca Raton to avoid any possible repercussions, but Tony and Soprano soldier &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero (Vincent Pastore) arranged a meeting to solve the problem. Junior sometimes resented having to answer to the young Aprile, who used to fetch Junior sambucas.

Junior never married and had no children. He lives in Belleville, New Jersey. He tells Bobby Baccalieri (Steve Schirripa) that he has a problem with feet, and does not even like talking about bunions.

==Plot details==
===&quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;===
Junior briefly takes over as caporegime of his brother Giovanni &quot;Johnny Boy&quot; Soprano&#x27;s crew from 1967, after he is sent to prison. At the funeral of &quot;Hollywood Dick&quot; Moltisanti, Junior takes Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; Moltisanti aside and tells him he considers them to be brothers. He offers Dickie his hand in friendship and promises to provide any favors he requires.

Five years later, in 1972, Johnny Boy is released from prison and takes back the reins of his crew. To Junior&#x27;s chagrin, Johnny reprimands him for apparently letting his neighborhood &quot;fall apart&quot; in his absence. Johnny urges his brother to follow Dickie&#x27;s &quot;example&quot;, but this only fractures the close relationship that Corrado once had with Dickie. It is clear that Johnny is beginning to hold Dickie favorably to his brother, who now sees Dickie as a rival, not a partner.

Sometime later, Junior attends the funeral of &quot;Buddha&quot; Bonpensiero, a made man killed by Harold McBrayer&#x27;s African-American mob in a gangland hit. Corrado slips down the stairs of the mortuary, and Dickie laughs, mocking Junior as he struggles to get back onto his feet. Months later, Junior is further frustrated when his injury prevents him from having sex with his comare. Humiliated and enraged, Junior secretly orders a hit on Dickie Moltisanti, knowing it will be blamed on Harold&#x27;s crew. Moltisanti is shot in the head from behind in the driveway of his home by an unknown assailant. At Moltisanti&#x27;s own funeral, Corrado stares coldly at his corpse, content with the knowledge that Dickie&#x27;s death will never come back to him.

===&quot;The Sopranos&quot;===
In the opening episode of the show, Junior plans to kill &quot;Little Pussy&quot; Malanga at a restaurant owned by Tony&#x27;s childhood friend, Artie Bucco (John Ventimiglia). Tony makes many attempts to prevent the murder and eventually resorts to fire bombing the restaurant to force its closure so the hit would happen elsewhere, enraging Junior. Tensions escalate further when two of Tony&#x27;s criminal associates Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli) and Brendan Filone (Anthony DeSando) hijack a truck owned by a Harrison, New Jersey, company that pays protection to Junior. Junior constantly expresses outrage and threats over the issue despite Tony&#x27;s attempts to resolve it. When Brendan hijacks another truck, and the driver is accidentally killed, Junior orders Brendan&#x27;s murder. He spares Christopher&#x27;s life because he is a surrogate nephew of Tony&#x27;s, ordering a mock execution instead.

Junior has been waiting a long time to become boss and, with his senior rank, feels he is next in line. Upon Jackie Aprile&#x27;s death, Tony has the support to take over the family but fears Junior will start a war if he is not named boss. Tony resolves the situation by letting Junior become boss in order to steer law enforcement attention away from the rest of the family. With the support of the other captains, Tony runs things behind the scenes, especially as Junior becomes greedier and more abusive of his authority. When Junior finds out about this from Tony&#x27;s mother, he is furious.

Around this time, Junior&#x27;s long-time &quot;goomah&quot;, Bobbi Sanfillipo, inadvertently causes word of Junior&#x27;s talent for oral sex to spread among the mob wives, eventually reaching Tony, who mocks him in front of several other men. Junior furiously breaks up with Bobbi over this, smashing a lemon meringue pie in her face. He also learns through Livia (Nancy Marchand) that Tony is seeing a psychiatrist. Junior then orders Tony&#x27;s failed assassination, which, due to his fondness for Tony, upsets him. Junior vomits while discussing details of the hit and is visibly upset when his associates discuss the hit with him. Tony retaliates by having two of Junior&#x27;s enforcers, Mikey Palmice (Al Sapienza) and Chucky Signore (Sal Ruffino), murdered. Junior is spared only because the FBI arrests him on racketeering charges.

Junior&#x27;s acting captain, Philly &quot;Spoons&quot; Parisi, comments on the conflict between Tony and his uncle and also Livia&#x27;s involvement, so Tony has him killed. With Junior and his main supporters either in jail or dead, Tony takes full control of the family. He lets Junior keep the title of boss while Tony runs everything as the street boss. Junior is allowed to run his old crew but must give 95% of the proceeds to Tony. Along with a bigger share from his old high-end poker game, union rackets, and car theft ring, this enables Junior to live on a subsistence level while also making enough to pay his legal fees.

Finally, Tony moves two soldiers from Junior&#x27;s crew, Patsy Parisi (Dan Grimaldi), the twin brother of Philly, and Gigi Cestone (John Fiore), over to his own crew. This leaves Junior the senile Murf Lupo (Val Bisoglio) as &quot;capo&quot;, Beppy Scerbo (Joe Pucillo), and Bobby Baccalieri as soldiers.

Soon, Junior is released from jail and placed under house arrest in his Belleville, New Jersey home while awaiting trial, after his attorney convinces the judge that Junior is much sicker than he actually is. While he is under house arrest, Soprano captain Richie Aprile (David Proval) is released from prison after serving ten years, and actively seeks Junior&#x27;s friendship. Richie wants him and Junior to kill Tony and take over the crime family.

While Junior wants to take back control, he is cautious of Richie&#x27;s plans. Junior is conflicted over which side to favor but eventually decides that while Tony can be selfish and impulsive, Richie simply is not respected enough by the rest of the family. Junior tells Tony of Richie&#x27;s plans against him. Grateful for the warning, Tony increases Junior&#x27;s take of his former rackets from 5% to 7.5%, and the two (more or less) bury the hatchet.

During this time, Bobby Baccalieri becomes Junior&#x27;s replacement, right-hand man, and closest confidant. Bobby accompanies Junior on hospital visits during his battles with stomach cancer, which he eventually overcomes. Junior finds various ways to get around his house arrest—using his doctor&#x27;s office and lawyer&#x27;s office to conduct business and attending as many funerals and family functions as possible. Despite their disputes, Tony often seeks Junior&#x27;s advice as the voice of experience.

In Season Four, Junior&#x27;s trial ends in a mistrial after they are able to intimidate one of the jurors into voting not guilty and forcing a hung jury. Although Junior has survived cancer and possible prison time, the toll of a series of &#x27;mini-strokes&#x27; and the confinement of house arrest has left him confused, depressed, and in failing health. By season five, Junior starts to show signs of dementia, requiring care and support. In &quot;Where&#x27;s Johnny?&quot;, Junior wanders the streets in his bathrobe and slippers, looking for his deceased brother.

In Season Six, Junior&#x27;s dementia has worsened, as he becomes paranoid that his long-deceased enemy, &quot;Little Pussy&quot; Malanga, is after him. Tony refuses to put his uncle in a nursing home, feeling obligated to care for Junior himself with the aid of his sisters and Bobby. In the season six debut episode, Tony arrives at Junior&#x27;s house one evening. Junior, believing his nephew to be Malanga, shoots Tony in the abdomen. Frightened, Junior runs upstairs, hiding away in his bedroom closet while Tony struggles to dial 9-1-1 before losing consciousness.

Junior is arrested and taken into federal custody over the shooting, but his lawyer secures him a release into a cushy mental institution, claiming he is currently unfit to stand trial. Junior remains confused and distressed, denying that he could have deliberately shot his own nephew. Junior&#x27;s dementia has progressed to such an extreme state that when his great-nephew A.J. Soprano (Robert Iler) visits him with the intention of killing him as revenge, Junior thinks A.J. is Tony and greets him with excitement. A.J.&#x27;s plan is botched when he inadvertently drops the knife on the floor. Tony pulls some strings with former Assemblyman, now State Senator, Ronald Zellman (Peter Riegert) to get A.J. released without charges being filed.

In the Wyckoff therapeutic center, Junior begins to put his old life back together. He still collects weekly payments from his organizations and is occasionally visited by Pat Blundetto and Beppy Scerbo. Within the confines of the mental home, Junior behaves like a typical Mafia chieftain; bribing orderlies, organizing card games, and even physically abusing a rival. A young patient named Carter Chong looks up to Junior as a mentor and father figure and admires his aggressive, imposing, and rebellious nature.

After Junior loses control of his bladder, the center&#x27;s administrators conclude that he is not taking his medications. Junior is confronted with the choice of either taking the medication or being moved to a less pleasant facility. Junior agrees to take the medication and begins to become more docile. He is badly beaten by his anger-prone protégé, who doesn&#x27;t want to lose Junior as a mentor. In the final scene of &quot;Remember When&quot; Junior sits passively, black and blue, with broken glasses from his beating, silently sitting and petting a cat sitting on his lap.

In the episode &quot;The Blue Comet&quot;, Janice (Aida Turturro) approaches Tony and tells him that Junior has run out of money, and will be removed from the Wyckoff therapeutic center. She implores Tony to help him out. Tony shows no sympathy for Junior and offers no support, telling Janice that she and Bobby are cut out of his life too, although it is just an empty threat. In the final episode, &quot;Made in America&quot;, Junior is moved to a state facility. When Janice goes to visit him, Junior thinks she is her mother, Livia, and thinks that a picture of Janice&#x27;s daughter is Janice herself.

She tries to tell him that Bobby has been murdered, but Junior does not comprehend, thinking she means Bobby Kennedy. Tony later visits a now sick and wheelchair-bound Junior for the first time since the shooting. Junior recognizes him as someone he used to play catch with, remembering playing with Tony 40 years earlier. Tony tries to remind Junior of who he was, and even who his brother was, but Junior cannot remember.

Tony tells him that he and his father used to run North Jersey, to which Junior simply smiles and replies, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s nice&quot;. Tony finally realizes Junior is in an advanced stage of dementia and is saddened and frustrated that Junior is lost for good. Tony simply looks at Junior and then tearfully leaves his uncle for the last time without saying another word.

<text>Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a class of error correction codes which (together with the closely-related turbo codes) have gained prominence in coding theory and information theory since the late 1990s. The codes today are widely used in applications ranging from wireless communications to flash-memory storage. Together with turbo codes, they sparked a revolution in coding theory, achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in performance compared to traditional error correction codes.

Central to the performance of LDPC codes is their adaptability to the iterative belief propagation decoding algorithm. Under this algorithm, they can be designed to approach theoretical limits (capacities) of many channels at low computation costs.

Theoretically, analysis of LDPC codes focuses on sequences of codes of fixed code rate and increasing block length. These sequences are typically tailored to a set of channels. For appropriately designed sequences, the decoding error under belief propagation can often be proven to be vanishingly small (approaches zero with the block length) at rates that are very close to the capacities of the channels. Furthermore, this can be achieved at a complexity that is linear in the block length.

This theoretical performance is made possible using a flexible design method that is based on sparse Tanner graphs (specialized bipartite graphs).

==History==
LDPC codes were originally conceived by Robert G. Gallager (and are thus also known as Gallager codes). Gallager devised the codes in his doctoral dissertation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1960. The codes were largely ignored at the time, as their iterative decoding algorithm (despite having linear complexity), was prohibitively computationally expensive for the hardware available.

Renewed interest in the codes emerged following the invention of the closely-related turbo codes (1993), whose similarly iterative decoding algorithm outperformed other codes used at that time. LDPC codes were subsequently rediscovered in 1996. Initial industry preference for LDPC codes over turbo codes stemmed from patent-related constraints on the latter. Over the time that has elapsed since their discovery, advances in LDPC codes have seen them surpass turbo codes in terms of error floor and performance in the higher code rate range, leaving turbo codes better suited for the lower code rates only. Although the fundamental patent for turbo codes has expired (on August 29, 2013), LDPC codes are now still being preferred for their technical merits.

Theoretical interest in LDPC codes also follows from their amenability to mathematical analysis. In his dissertation, Gallager showed that LDPC codes achieve the Gilbert–Varshamov bound for linear codes over binary fields with high probability. Over the binary erasure channel, code sequences were designed at rates arbitrary close to channel capacity, with provably vanishing decoding error probability and linear decoding complexity. In 2020 it was shown that Gallager&#x27;s LDPC codes achieve list decoding capacity and also achieve the Gilbert–Varshamov bound for linear codes over general fields.

==Applications==
In 2003, an irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) style LDPC code beat six turbo codes to become the error-correcting code in the new DVB-S2 standard for digital television. The DVB-S2 selection committee made decoder complexity estimates for the turbo code proposals using a much less efficient serial decoder architecture rather than a parallel decoder architecture. This forced the turbo code proposals to use frame sizes on the order of one half the frame size of the LDPC proposals.

In 2008, LDPC beat convolutional turbo codes as the forward error correction (FEC) system for the ITU-T G.hn standard. G.hn chose LDPC codes over turbo codes because of their lower decoding complexity (especially when operating at data rates close to 1.0 Gbit/s) and because the proposed turbo codes exhibited a significant error floor at the desired range of operation.

LDPC codes are also used for 10GBASE-T Ethernet, which sends data at 10 gigabits per second over twisted-pair cables. As of 2009, LDPC codes are also part of the Wi-Fi 802.11 standard as an optional part of 802.11n and 802.11ac, in the High Throughput (HT) PHY specification. LDPC is a mandatory part of 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6).

Some OFDM systems add an additional outer error correction that fixes the occasional errors (the &quot;error floor&quot;) that get past the LDPC correction inner code even at low bit error rates.

For example:
The Reed-Solomon code with LDPC Coded Modulation (RS-LCM) uses a Reed-Solomon outer code. The DVB-S2, the DVB-T2 and the DVB-C2 standards all use a BCH code outer code to mop up residual errors after LDPC decoding.

5G NR uses polar code for the control channels and LDPC for the data channels.

Although LDPC code has had its success in commercial hard disk drives, to fully exploit its error correction capability in SSDs demands unconventional fine-grained flash memory sensing, leading to an increased memory read latency. LDPC-in-SSD is an effective approach to deploy LDPC in SSD with a very small latency increase, which turns LDPC in SSD into a reality. Since then, LDPC has been widely adopted in commercial SSDs in both customer-grades and enterprise-grades by major storage venders. Many TLC (and later) SSDs are using LDPC codes. A fast hard-decode (binary erasure) is first attempted, which can fall back into the slower but more powerful soft decoding.

==Operational use==

LDPC codes functionally are defined by a sparse parity-check matrix. This sparse matrix is often randomly generated, subject to the sparsity constraints—LDPC code construction is discussed later. These codes were first designed by Robert Gallager in 1960.

Below is a graph fragment of an example LDPC code using Forney&#x27;s factor graph notation. In this graph, &quot;n&quot; variable nodes in the top of the graph are connected to (&quot;n&quot;−&quot;k&quot;) constraint nodes in the bottom of the graph.

This is a popular way of graphically representing an (&quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;) LDPC code. The bits of a valid message, when placed on the T&#x27;s at the top of the graph, satisfy the graphical constraints. Specifically, all lines connecting to a variable node (box with an &#x27;=&#x27; sign) have the same value, and all values connecting to a factor node (box with a &#x27;+&#x27; sign) must sum, modulo two, to zero (in other words, they must sum to an even number; or there must be an even number of odd values).
Ignoring any lines going out of the picture, there are eight possible six-bit strings corresponding to valid codewords: (i.e., 000000, 011001, 110010, 101011, 111100, 100101, 001110, 010111). This LDPC code fragment represents a three-bit message encoded as six bits. Redundancy is used, here, to increase the chance of recovering from channel errors. This is a (6, 3) linear code, with &quot;n&quot; = 6 and &quot;k&quot; = 3.

Again ignoring lines going out of the picture, the parity-check matrix representing this graph fragment is

:formula_1

In this matrix, each row represents one of the three parity-check constraints, while each column represents one of the six bits in the received codeword.

In this example, the eight codewords can be obtained by putting the parity-check matrix H into this form formula_2 through basic row operations in GF(2):
:formula_3

Step 1: H.

Step 2: Row 1 is added to row 3.

Step 3: Row 2 and 3 are swapped.

Step 4: Row 1 is added to row 3.

From this, the generator matrix G can be obtained as formula_4 (noting that in the special case of this being a binary code formula_5), or specifically:

:formula_6

Finally, by multiplying all eight possible 3-bit strings by G, all eight valid codewords are obtained. For example, the codeword for the bit-string &#x27;101&#x27; is obtained by:

:formula_7,

where formula_8 is symbol of mod 2 multiplication.

As a check, the row space of G is orthogonal to H such that formula_9

The bit-string &#x27;101&#x27; is found in as the first 3 bits of the codeword &#x27;101011&#x27;.

== Example encoder ==

During the encoding of a frame, the input data bits (D) are repeated and distributed to a set of constituent encoders. The constituent encoders are typically accumulators and each accumulator is used to generate a parity symbol. A single copy of the original data (S0,K-1) is transmitted with the parity bits (P) to make up the code symbols. The S bits from each constituent encoder are discarded.

The parity bit may be used within another constituent code.

In an example using the DVB-S2 rate 2/3 code the encoded block size is 64800 symbols (N=64800) with 43200 data bits (K=43200) and 21600 parity bits (M=21600). Each constituent code (check node) encodes 16 data bits except for the first parity bit which encodes 8 data bits. The first 4680 data bits are repeated 13 times (used in 13 parity codes), while the remaining data bits are used in 3 parity codes (irregular LDPC code).

For comparison, classic turbo codes typically use two constituent codes configured in parallel, each of which encodes the entire input block (K) of data bits. These constituent encoders are recursive convolutional codes (RSC) of moderate depth (8 or 16 states) that are separated by a code interleaver which interleaves one copy of the frame.

The LDPC code, in contrast, uses many low depth constituent codes (accumulators) in parallel, each of which encode only a small portion of the input frame. The many constituent codes can be viewed as many low depth (2 state) &quot;convolutional codes&quot; that are connected via the repeat and distribute operations. The repeat and distribute operations perform the function of the interleaver in the turbo code.

The ability to more precisely manage the connections of the various constituent codes and the level of redundancy for each input bit give more flexibility in the design of LDPC codes, which can lead to better performance than turbo codes in some instances. Turbo codes still seem to perform better than LDPCs at low code rates, or at least the design of well performing low rate codes is easier for turbo codes.

As a practical matter, the hardware that forms the accumulators is reused during the encoding process. That is, once a first set of parity bits are generated and the parity bits stored, the same accumulator hardware is used to generate a next set of parity bits.

==Decoding==

As with other codes, the maximum likelihood decoding of an LDPC code on the binary symmetric channel is an NP-complete problem, shown by reduction from 3-dimensional matching. So assuming P != NP, which is widely believed, then performing optimal decoding for an arbitrary code of any useful size is not practical.

However, sub-optimal techniques based on iterative belief propagation decoding give excellent results and can be practically implemented. The sub-optimal decoding techniques view each parity check that makes up the LDPC as an independent single parity check (SPC) code. Each SPC code is decoded separately using soft-in-soft-out (SISO) techniques such as SOVA, BCJR, MAP, and other derivates thereof. The soft decision information from each SISO decoding is cross-checked and updated with other redundant SPC decodings of the same information bit. Each SPC code is then decoded again using the updated soft decision information. This process is iterated until a valid codeword is achieved or decoding is exhausted. This type of decoding is often referred to as sum-product decoding.

The decoding of the SPC codes is often referred to as the &quot;check node&quot; processing, and the cross-checking of the variables is often referred to as the &quot;variable-node&quot; processing.

In a practical LDPC decoder implementation, sets of SPC codes are decoded in parallel to increase throughput.

In contrast, belief propagation on the binary erasure channel is particularly simple where it consists of iterative constraint satisfaction.

For example, consider that the valid codeword, 101011, from the example above, is transmitted across a binary erasure channel and received with the first and fourth bit erased to yield ?01?11. Since the transmitted message must have satisfied the code constraints, the message can be represented by writing the received message on the top of the factor graph.

In this example, the first bit cannot yet be recovered, because all of the constraints connected to it have more than one unknown bit. In order to proceed with decoding the message, constraints connecting to only one of the erased bits must be identified. In this example, only the second constraint suffices. Examining the second constraint, the fourth bit must have been zero, since only a zero in that position would satisfy the constraint.

This procedure is then iterated. The new value for the fourth bit can now be used in conjunction with the first constraint to recover the first bit as seen below. This means that the first bit must be a one to satisfy the leftmost constraint.

Thus, the message can be decoded iteratively. For other channel models, the messages passed between the variable nodes and check nodes are real numbers, which express probabilities and likelihoods of belief.

This result can be validated by multiplying the corrected codeword r by the parity-check matrix H:

:formula_10

Because the outcome z (the syndrome) of this operation is the three × one zero vector, the resulting codeword r is successfully validated.

After the decoding is completed, the original message bits &#x27;101&#x27; can be extracted by looking at the first 3 bits of the codeword.

While illustrative, this erasure example does not show the use of soft-decision decoding or soft-decision message passing, which is used in virtually all commercial LDPC decoders.

=== Updating node information ===
In recent years, there has also been a great deal of work spent studying the effects of alternative schedules for variable-node and constraint-node update. The original technique that was used for decoding LDPC codes was known as &quot;flooding&quot;. This type of update required that, before updating a variable node, all constraint nodes needed to be updated and vice versa. In later work by Vila Casado &quot;et al.&quot;, alternative update techniques were studied, in which variable nodes are updated with the newest available check-node information.

The intuition behind these algorithms is that variable nodes whose values vary the most are the ones that need to be updated first. Highly reliable nodes, whose log-likelihood ratio (LLR) magnitude is large and does not change significantly from one update to the next, do not require updates with the same frequency as other nodes, whose sign and magnitude fluctuate more widely.
These scheduling algorithms show greater speed of convergence and lower error floors than those that use flooding. These lower error floors are achieved by the ability of the Informed Dynamic Scheduling (IDS) algorithm to overcome trapping sets of near codewords.

When nonflooding scheduling algorithms are used, an alternative definition of iteration is used. For an (&quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;) LDPC code of rate &quot;k&quot;/&quot;n&quot;, a full &quot;iteration&quot; occurs when &quot;n&quot; variable and &quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot; constraint nodes have been updated, no matter the order in which they were updated.

== Code construction ==
For large block sizes, LDPC codes are commonly constructed by first studying the behaviour of decoders. As the block size tends to infinity, LDPC decoders can be shown to have a noise threshold below which decoding is reliably achieved, and above which decoding is not achieved, colloquially referred to as the cliff effect. This threshold can be optimised by finding the best proportion of arcs from check nodes and arcs from variable nodes. An approximate graphical approach to visualising this threshold is an EXIT chart.

The construction of a specific LDPC code after this optimization falls into two main types of techniques:

*Pseudorandom approaches
*Combinatorial approaches

Construction by a pseudo-random approach builds on theoretical results that, for large block size, a random construction gives good decoding performance. In general, pseudorandom codes have complex encoders, but pseudorandom codes with the best decoders can have simple encoders. Various constraints are often applied to help ensure that the desired properties expected at the theoretical limit of infinite block size occur at a finite block size.

Combinatorial approaches can be used to optimize the properties of small block-size LDPC codes or to create codes with simple encoders.

Some LDPC codes are based on Reed–Solomon codes, such as the RS-LDPC code used in the 10 Gigabit Ethernet standard. Compared to randomly generated LDPC codes, structured LDPC codes—such as the LDPC code used in the DVB-S2 standard—can have simpler and therefore lower-cost hardware—in particular, codes constructed such that the H matrix is a circulant matrix.

Yet another way of constructing LDPC codes is to use finite geometries. This method was proposed by Y. Kou &quot;et al.&quot; in 2001.

== Compared to turbo codes ==
LDPC codes can be compared with other powerful coding schemes, e.g. turbo codes. In one hand, BER performance of turbo codes is influenced by low codes limitations. LDPC codes have no limitations of minimum distance, that indirectly means that LDPC codes may be more efficient on relatively large code rates (e.g. 3/4, 5/6, 7/8) than turbo codes. However, LDPC codes are not the complete replacement: turbo codes are the best solution at the lower code rates (e.g. 1/6, 1/3, 1/2).

<text>The 1919 Quebec general election was held on June 23, 1919, to elect members of the 15th Legislative Assembly of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Lomer Gouin, was re-elected, defeating the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Arthur Sauvé.

Gouin, who had held office since 1905, resigned precisely one year after the election to make way for his successor Louis-Alexandre Taschereau. Gouin himself had originally come to power in much the same way, after his predecessor Simon-Napoléon Parent resigned soon after winning his final election.

<doc id="516397" wikidata="Q659563" url="?curid=516397" title="Video game genre">
<text>A video game genre is an informal classification of a video game based on how it is played rather than visual or narrative elements. This is independent of setting, unlike works of fiction that are expressed through other media, such as films or books. For example, a shooter game is still a shooter game, regardless of where or when it takes place. A specific game&#x27;s genre is open to subjective interpretation. An individual game may belong to several genres at once.

==History==
Early attempts at categorizing video games were primarily for organizing catalogs and books. A 1981 catalog for the Atari Video Computer System uses 8 headings: Skill Gallery, Space Station, Classics Corner, Adventure Territory, Race Track, Sports Arena, Combat Zone, and Learning Center. (&quot;Classics&quot;, in this case, refers to chess and checkers.) In Tom Hirschfeld&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;How to Master the Video Games&quot;, he divides the games into broad categories in the table of contents: &quot;Space Invaders&quot;-type, &quot;Asteroids&quot;-type, maze, reflex, and miscellaneous. The first two of these correspond to the still-used genres of fixed shooter and multidirectional shooter.

For home computers, two publications established a small number of categories based on the best-selling software in the early 1980s: &quot;Softalk&quot;, which ran its Top Thirty list from 1980 to 1984 with the genres of strategy, adventure, fantasy and arcade; and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, which collected user-submitted rankings. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; initially used three categories in 1981—arcade, wargame, and adventure—but by 1989 had expanded its genre list to strategy, simulation, adventure, role-playing adventure, wargame, and action/arcade.

Chris Crawford attempted to classify video games in his 1984 book &quot;The Art of Computer Game Design&quot;. Crawford focused on the player&#x27;s experience and activities required for gameplay. He wrote, &quot;the state of computer game design is changing quickly. We would therefore expect the taxonomy presented [in this book] to become obsolete or inadequate in a short time.&quot;

Nintendo, in bringing its Famicom system into the North American market as the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985, looked to avoid the issues with loss of publishing control that had led to the video game crash of 1983 and to prevent unauthorized games for the system. To solve this, Nintendo required approval of all games for the NES. To support this, Nintendo classified games into eight major series: Adventure, Action, Sports, Light-Gun, Programmable, Arcade, Robot, and Educational. The series description appeared on early &quot;black box&quot; covers and subsequently in the &quot;NES Player&#x27;s Guide&quot;. By the time of the Game Boy and Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo had retired the Arcade, Light-Gun, Robot, Programmable, and Educational series, but added RPG &amp; Simulation and Puzzle.

Consoles manufacturers that followed the NES followed similar behavior in requiring licenses to develop games for their systems. To assure they would get these licenses, console developers tended to stay with gameplay of previously published games for that console, thus causing groups of games within the same genre to grow. Subsequently, retailers displayed games grouped by genres, and market research firms found that players had preferences for certain types over others, based on region, and developers could plan out future strategies through this.

With the industry expanding in the 1990s and budgets for video games began growing, large publishers like Electronic Arts began to form to handle the marketing and publication of games, both for consoles and personal computers. Targeting high-value, low-risk video game genres was key for some publishers, and small and independent developers were typically forced to compete by abandoning more experimental gameplay and settling into the same genres used by larger publishers.

As hardware capabilities have increased, new genres have become possible, with examples being increased memory, the move from 2D to 3D, new peripherals, online functionalities, and location-based mechanics. Experimental gameplay from indie game development drew more attention in the late 2000s and 2010s aided by independent digital distribution, as large publishers focused on triple-A titles were extremely risk-averse. Through indie games, a revival of experimental gameplay had emerged, and several new genres have emerged since then.

==Definition==
Due to &quot;direct and active participation&quot; of the player, video game genres differ from literary and film genres. Though one could state that &quot;Space Invaders&quot; is a science fiction video game, author Mark J.P. Wolf wrote that such a classification &quot;ignores the fundamental differences and similarities which are to be found in the player&#x27;s experience of the game&quot;. In contrast to the visual aesthetics of games, which can vary greatly, it is argued that it is interactivity characteristics that are common to all games.

Like film genres, the names of video game genres have come about generally as a common understanding between the audience and the producers. Descriptive names of genres take into account the goals of the game, the protagonist and even the perspective offered to the player. For example, a first-person shooter is a game that is played from a first-person perspective and involves the practice of shooting. Whereas &quot;shooter game&quot; is a genre name, &quot;first-person shooter&quot; and &quot;third-person shooter&quot; are common subgenres of the shooter genre. Other examples of such prefixes are real-time, turn based, top-down and side-scrolling.

Genre names may evolve over time. The platform game genre started as &quot;climbing games&quot;, based on Steve Bloom&#x27;s 1982 book &quot;Video Invaders&quot;, as they were inspired by games like &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; with ladders and jumping. The same term was used by the US and UK press in 1983, including magazines &quot;Electronic Games&quot; and &quot;TV Gamer&quot;. First-person shooters were originally known as &quot;&quot;Doom&quot; clones&quot; in the years following 1993&#x27;s &quot;Doom&quot;, while the term &quot;first-person shooters&quot; became more common by around 2000.

New genres emerge continuously throughout the history of video games, often due to the cross-pollination of ideas borrowed from different games into new ones. For example, the seminal text-based adventure game &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; directly inspired the Atari VCS game &quot;Adventure&quot;, but incorporating joystick control as in an action game rather than typed commands. &quot;Adventure&quot; served as the prototype of the action-adventure game genre that would be popularized by &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.

The target audience, underlying theme or purpose of a game are sometimes used as a genre identifier, such as with &quot;Christian game&quot; and &quot;serious game&quot; respectively. However, because these terms do not indicate anything about the gameplay of a video game, these are not considered genres.

== Classifications ==
Video game genres vary in specificity, with popular video game reviews using genre names varying from &quot;action&quot; to &quot;baseball&quot;. In this practice, basic themes and more fundamental characteristics are used alongside each other.

A game may combine aspects of multiple genres in such a way that it becomes hard to classify under existing genres. For example, because &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; combined shooting, driving and roleplaying in an unusual way, it was hard to classify using existing terms. The term &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; clone has been used to describe games mechanically similar to &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;. Similarly, the term roguelike has been developed for games that share similarities with &quot;Rogue&quot;.

Elements of the role-playing genre, which focuses on storytelling and character growth, have been implemented in many different genres of video games. This is because the addition of a story and character enhancement to an action, strategy or puzzle video game does not take away from its core gameplay, but adds an incentive other than survival to the experience.

In addition to gameplay elements, some games may be categorized by other schemes; such are typically not used as genres:
* By platform: generally to the nature of the computer hardware that the game is played on and not the specific branding. This would include game genres like mobile games for smartphone, tablet computers, or other similar portable devices; and browser games that can be played in a web browser. Identification of the type of hardware a game is played on implied certain limits to the type of gameplay that is available; a mobile game will typically lack as much action compared to a game playable on a home console or computer due to limitations on player input.
* By mode: referring to whether a game is single player, multiplayer, or variations on that, including massively multiplayer online (MMO) games, cooperative games, player versus environment (PvE) or player versus player (PvP) games, and so forth.
* By narrative: Classifying video games by their narrative style, such as science fiction or fantasy, is typically not used within the field, with the key exception of horror games, which broadly cover any game dealing with elements of horror fiction.

==Popularity==
According to some analysts, the percentage of each broad genre in the best-selling physical games worldwide is broken down as follows.
In the last decade, puzzle games have declined when measured by sales, however, on mobile, where the majority of games are free-to-play, this genre remains the most popular worldwide.

<text>A monochromator is an optical device that transmits a mechanically selectable narrow band of wavelengths of light or other radiation chosen from a wider range of wavelengths available at the input. The name is .

==Uses==

A device that can produce monochromatic light has many uses in science and in optics because many optical characteristics of a material are dependent on wavelength. Although there are a number of useful ways to select a narrow band of wavelengths (which, in the visible range, is perceived as a pure color), there are not as many other ways to easily select any wavelength band from a wide range. See below for a discussion of some of the uses of monochromators.

In hard X-ray and neutron optics, crystal monochromators are used to define wave conditions on the instruments.

==Techniques==
A monochromator can use either the phenomenon of optical dispersion in a prism, or that of diffraction using a diffraction grating, to spatially separate the colors of light. It usually has a mechanism for directing the selected color to an exit slit. Usually the grating or the prism is used in a reflective mode. A reflective prism is made by making a right triangle prism (typically, half of an equilateral prism) with one side mirrored. The light enters through the hypotenuse face and is reflected back through it, being refracted twice at the same surface. The total refraction, and the total dispersion, is the same as would occur if an equilateral prism were used in transmission mode.

===Collimation===
The dispersion or diffraction is only controllable if the light is collimated, that is if all the rays of light are parallel, or practically so. A source, like the sun, which is very far away, provides collimated light. Newton used sunlight in his famous experiments. In a practical monochromator, however, the light source is close by, and an optical system in the monochromator converts the diverging light of the source to collimated light. Although some monochromator designs do use focusing gratings that do not need separate collimators, most use collimating mirrors. Reflective optics are preferred because they do not introduce dispersive effects of their own.

===Geometrical design of a prism or grating monochromator===

There are grating/prism configurations that offer different tradeoffs between simplicity and spectral accuracy.
* Czerny–Turner (discussed below)
* Paschen-Runge
* Eagle
* Wadsworth
* Ebert-Fasti
* Littrow
* Pfund


In the common Czerny–Turner design, the broad-band illumination source (A) is aimed at an entrance slit (B). The amount of light energy available for use depends on the intensity of the source in the space defined by the slit (width × height) and the acceptance angle of the optical system. The slit is placed at the effective focus of a curved mirror (the collimator, C) so that the light from the slit reflected from the mirror is collimated (focused at infinity). The collimated light is diffracted from the grating (D) and then is collected by another mirror (E), which refocuses the light, now dispersed, on the exit slit (F). In a prism monochromator, a reflective Littrow prism takes the place of the diffraction grating, in which case the light is refracted by the prism.

At the exit slit, the colors of the light are spread out (in the visible this shows the colors of the rainbow). Because each color arrives at a separate point in the exit-slit plane, there are a series of images of the entrance slit focused on the plane. Because the entrance slit is finite in width, parts of nearby images overlap. The light leaving the exit slit (F) contains the entire image of the entrance slit of the selected color plus parts of the entrance slit images of nearby colors. A rotation of the dispersing element causes the band of colors to move relative to the exit slit, so that the desired entrance slit image is centered on the exit slit. The range of colors leaving the exit slit is a function of the width of the slits. The entrance and exit slit widths are adjusted together.

===Stray light===
The ideal transfer function of such a monochromator is a triangular shape. The peak of the triangle is at the nominal wavelength selected, so that the image of the selected wavelength completely fills the exit slit. The intensity of the nearby colors then decreases linearly on either side of this peak until some cutoff value is reached, where the intensity stops decreasing. This is called the &quot;stray light&quot; level. The cutoff level is typically about one thousandth of the peak value, or 0.1%.

===Spectral bandwidth===
Spectral bandwidth is defined as the width of the triangle at the points where the light has reached half the maximum value (full width at half maximum, abbreviated as FWHM). A typical spectral bandwidth might be one nanometer; however, different values can be chosen to meet the need of analysis. A narrower bandwidth does improve the resolution, but it also decreases the signal-to-noise ratio.

===Dispersion===
The dispersion of a monochromator is characterized as the width of the band of colors per unit of slit width, 1 nm of spectrum per mm of slit width for instance. This factor is constant for a grating, but varies with wavelength for a prism. If a scanning prism monochromator is used in a constant bandwidth mode, the slit width must change as the wavelength changes. Dispersion depends on the focal length, the grating order and grating resolving power.

===Wavelength range===
A monochromator&#x27;s adjustment range might cover the visible spectrum and some part of both or either of the nearby ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) spectra, although monochromators are built for a great variety of optical ranges, and to a great many designs.

===Double monochromators===
It is common for two monochromators to be connected in series, with their mechanical systems operating in tandem so that they both select the same color. This arrangement is not intended to improve the narrowness of the spectrum, but rather to lower the cutoff level. A double monochromator may have a cutoff about one millionth of the peak value, the product of the two cutoffs of the individual sections. The intensity of the light of other colors in the exit beam is referred to as the stray light level and is the most critical specification of a monochromator for many uses. Achieving low stray light is a large part of the art of making a practical monochromator.

===Diffraction gratings and blazed gratings===
Grating monochromators disperse ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation typically using replica gratings, which are manufactured from a master grating. A master grating consists of a hard, optically flat, surface that has a large number of parallel and closely spaced grooves. The construction of a master grating is a long, expensive process because the grooves must be of identical size, exactly parallel, and equally spaced over the length of the grating (3–10 cm). A grating for the ultraviolet and visible region typically has 300–2000 grooves/mm, however 1200–1400 grooves/mm is most common. For the infrared region, gratings usually have 10–200 grooves/mm. When a diffraction grating is used, care must be taken in the design of broadband monochromators because the diffraction pattern has overlapping orders. Sometimes broadband preselector filters are inserted in the optical path to limit the width of the diffraction orders so they do not overlap. Sometimes this is done by using a prism as one of the monochromators of a dual monochromator design.

The original high-resolution diffraction gratings were ruled. The construction of high-quality ruling engines was a large undertaking (as well as exceedingly difficult, in past decades), and good gratings were very expensive. The slope of the triangular groove in a ruled grating is typically adjusted to enhance the brightness of a particular diffraction order. This is called blazing a grating. Ruled gratings have imperfections that produce faint &quot;ghost&quot; diffraction orders that may raise the stray light level of a monochromator. A later photolithographic technique allows gratings to be created from a holographic interference pattern. Holographic gratings have sinusoidal grooves and so are not as bright, but have lower scattered light levels than blazed gratings. Almost all the gratings actually used in monochromators are carefully made replicas of ruled or holographic master gratings.

===Prisms===

Prisms have higher dispersion in the UV region. Prism monochromators are favored in some instruments that are principally designed to work in the far UV region. Most monochromators use gratings, however. Some monochromators have several gratings that can be selected for use in different spectral regions. A double monochromator made by placing a prism and a grating monochromator in series typically does not need additional bandpass filters to isolate a single grating order.

===Focal length===
The narrowness of the band of colors that a monochromator can generate is related to the focal length of the monochromator collimators. Using a longer focal length optical system also unfortunately decreases the amount of light that can be accepted from the source. Very high resolution monochromators might have a focal length of 2 meters. Building such monochromators requires exceptional attention to mechanical and thermal stability. For many applications a monochromator of about 0.4 meters&#x27; focal length is considered to have excellent resolution. Many monochromators have a focal length less than 0.1 meters.

===Slit height===
The most common optical system uses spherical collimators and thus contains optical aberrations that curve the field where the slit images come to focus, so that slits are sometimes curved instead of simply straight, to approximate the curvature of the image. This allows taller slits to be used, gathering more light, while still achieving high spectral resolution. Some designs take another approach and use toroidal collimating mirrors to correct the curvature instead, allowing higher straight slits without sacrificing resolution.

===Wavelength vs. energy===
Monochromators are often calibrated in units of wavelength. Uniform rotation of a grating produces a sinusoidal change in wavelength, which is approximately linear for small grating angles, so such an instrument is easy to build. Many of the underlying physical phenomena being studied are linear in energy though, and since wavelength and photon energy have a reciprocal relationship, spectral patterns that are simple and predictable when plotted as a function of energy are distorted when plotted as a function of wavelength. Some monochromators are calibrated in units of reciprocal centimeters or some other energy units, but the scale may not be linear.

===Dynamic range===
A spectrophotometer built with a high quality double monochromator can produce light of sufficient purity and intensity that the instrument can measure a narrow band of optical attenuation of about one million fold (6 AU, Absorbance Units).

==Applications==
Monochromators are used in many optical measuring instruments and in other applications where tunable monochromatic light is wanted. Sometimes the monochromatic light is directed at a sample and the reflected or transmitted light is measured. Sometimes white light is directed at a sample and the monochromator is used to analyze the reflected or transmitted light. Two monochromators are used in many fluorometers; one monochromator is used to select the excitation wavelength and a second monochromator is used to analyze the emitted light.

An automatic scanning spectrometer includes a mechanism to change the wavelength selected by the monochromator and to record the resulting changes in the measured quantity as a function of the wavelength.

If an imaging device replaces the exit slit, the result is the basic configuration of a spectrograph. This configuration allows the simultaneous analysis of the intensities of a wide band of colors. Photographic film or an array of photodetectors can be used, for instance to collect the light. Such an instrument can record a spectral function without mechanical scanning, although there may be tradeoffs in terms of resolution or sensitivity for instance.

An absorption spectrophotometer measures the absorption of light by a sample as a function of wavelength. Sometimes the result is expressed as percent transmission and sometimes it is expressed as the inverse logarithm of the transmission. The Beer–Lambert law relates the absorption of light to the concentration of the light-absorbing material, the optical path length, and an intrinsic property of the material called molar absorptivity. According to this relation the decrease in intensity is exponential in concentration and path length. The decrease is linear in these quantities when the inverse logarithm of transmission is used. The old nomenclature for this value was optical density (OD), current nomenclature is absorbance units (AU). One AU is a tenfold reduction in light intensity. Six AU is a millionfold reduction.

Absorption spectrophotometers often contain a monochromator to supply light to the sample. Some absorption spectrophotometers have automatic spectral analysis capabilities.

Absorption spectrophotometers have many everyday uses in chemistry, biochemistry, and biology. For example, they are used to measure the concentration or change in concentration of many substances that absorb light. Critical characteristics of many biological materials, many enzymes for instance, are measured by starting a chemical reaction that produces a color change that depends on the presence or activity of the material being studied. Optical thermometers have been created by calibrating the change in absorbance of a material against temperature. There are many other examples.

Spectrophotometers are used to measure the specular reflectance of mirrors and the diffuse reflectance of colored objects. They are used to characterize the performance of sunglasses, laser protective glasses, and other optical filters. There are many other examples.

In the UV, visible and near IR, absorbance and reflectance spectrophotometers usually illuminate the sample with monochromatic light. In the corresponding IR instruments, the monochromator is usually used to analyze the light coming from the sample.

Monochromators are also used in optical instruments that measure other phenomena besides simple absorption or reflection, wherever the color of the light is a significant variable. Circular dichroism spectrometers contain a monochromator, for example.

Lasers produce light which is much more monochromatic than the optical monochromators discussed here, but only some lasers are easily tunable, and these lasers are not as simple to use.

Monochromatic light allows for the measurement of the quantum efficiency (QE) of an imaging device (e.g. CCD or CMOS imager). Light from the exit slit is passed either through diffusers or an integrating sphere on to the imaging device while a calibrated detector simultaneously measures the light. Coordination of the imager, calibrated detector, and monochromator allows one to calculate the carriers (electrons or holes) generated for a photon of a given wavelength, QE.

*Atomic absorption spectrometers use light from hollow cathode lamps that emit light generated by atoms of a specific element, for instance iron or lead or calcium. The available colors are fixed, but are very monochromatic and are excellent for measuring the concentration of specific elements in a sample. These instruments behave as if they contained a very high quality monochromator, but their use is limited to analyzing the elements they are equipped for.
* A major IR measurement technique, Fourier transform IR, or FTIR, does not use a monochromator. Instead, the measurement is performed in the time domain, using the field autocorrelation technique.
*Polychromator
*Ultrafast monochromator – a monochromator that compensates for path length delays that would stretch ultrashort pulses
*Wien filter – a technique for producing &quot;monochromatic&quot; electron beams, where all the electrons have nearly the same energy

<doc id="516418" wikidata="Q2463192" url="?curid=516418" title="Adriana La Cerva">
<text>Adriana La Cerva is a fictional character on the HBO TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, portrayed by Drea de Matteo. She is the long-time girlfriend and, later, fiancée of Tony Soprano&#x27;s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti. For her performance, de Matteo won the 2004 Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.

==Character history==
Adriana is the niece of Jackie and Richie Aprile. She is not repulsed by the Mafia lifestyle and starts out as a hostess at Artie Bucco&#x27;s restaurant, Vesuvio. Adriana is initially portrayed as shallow and materialistic, interested in the things that her boyfriend Christopher&#x27;s money could buy: expensive cars, shoes, jewelry, drugs, and designer clothing. Despite the couple growing closer, she becomes a frequent victim of domestic violence at the hands of Christopher.

After he and Adriana fight, she moves in with her mother, but Chris gets her back by proposing to her, against her mother&#x27;s advice. Despite this, the two do not get married. She reveals to Chris that she is potentially infertile, which leads to another bout of domestic violence.

Adriana desires to have a business of her own. In Season 3, Christopher acquires The Lollipop Lounge in Long Branch, New Jersey, from a gambling debtor, and turns it over to Adriana to manage as she pleases. Adriana renames the bar &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; and makes it successful as a venue for local alternative rock bands and as a bar for college students from nearby Monmouth University and elsewhere. Benny Fazio is beaten in the nightclub&#x27;s parking lot by Phil Leotardo. In season 4, Adriana reveals that she is possibly infertile due to complications from a previous abortion. In season 5, Adriana is diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.

===The mole===
By the end of season 3, The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) targets Adriana as a potential witness in the family&#x27;s organization. Upon the death of Sal &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero, the FBI looks to Adriana as a close relation to Christopher, a rising star in the crime family, and sends Special Agent Deborah Ciccerone to befriend her in &quot;Army of One&quot;. Ciccerone, who goes by &quot;Danielle Ciccolella&quot;, succeeds at befriending Adriana, but the FBI have to abandon the mission earlier than planned when Christopher makes a pass at Ciccerone, upsetting Adriana.

In &quot;No Show&quot;, the FBI brings Adriana in and threatens her with long imprisonment for drug possession, or perhaps punishment by Tony Soprano, if she does not co-operate. Adriana vomits all over herself, the table, and the agents.

Out of loyalty to Christopher, Adriana avoids giving up any serious information on the family and does her best to avoid the Soprano family house in order to have nothing to give back to the FBI. In &quot;Long Term Parking&quot;, her deception catches up with her after the FBI learns of her involvement in covering up a murder at her club. The FBI threatens to press charges of being an accessory to murder against her unless she offers full cooperation. Adriana refuses to wear a wire, instead asking the FBI for a chance to bring Christopher in with her and cooperate together.

She reveals the truth to Christopher, hoping they can go into the Witness Protection Program together and start new lives. An enraged Christopher beats and almost strangles her, before breaking down crying. His loyalty to his crime family turns out to be greater than his love for Adriana, and he reveals her status as an informant to Tony. Tony telephones Adriana, falsely informing her that Christopher attempted suicide at a diner in Ramapo Mountain State Forest before being found by the New Jersey State Police and has been hospitalized, and that Silvio Dante will drive her to the hospital.

En route on Interstate 287, Silvio stops the car in the middle of the woods. Realizing what is about to happen, a terrified Adriana tries to flee, crawling away from the car on all fours off screen when Silvio shoots her dead. Christopher is later seen putting some of her clothes in a red suitcase, which he then discards. He then leaves her light blue Ford Thunderbird in the long-term parking lot at Newark Liberty International Airport.

===Post-mortem===
In the season 6 episode &quot;The Ride&quot;, Carmela Soprano runs in to Adriana&#x27;s mother, Liz La Cerva, who tells Carmela that she believes Christopher killed Adriana and that the FBI questioned her about Adriana&#x27;s disappearance. When Carmela tells Tony about their conversation, he dismisses her fears, explaining that if Christopher had killed Adriana then her body would have been found by now. In addition, he points out to Carmela that if the FBI really suspected Christopher, then they would have arrested him.

While in Paris, Carmela dreams of seeing Adriana in a park, but a policeman tells her Adriana is dead. Carmela is intent on finding her, especially after Liz La Cerva tries to kill herself. However, Tony and Silvio pull some strings and Carmela is able to continue construction on her spec house, and the distraction keeps her from investigating the matter further.

<text>is the day before the beginning of spring in the old calendar in Japan. The name literally means &#x27;seasonal division&#x27;, referring to the day just before the first day of spring in the traditional calendar, known as ; though previously referring to a wider range of possible dates, is now typically held on February 3 (in 2021 and 2025 it was on 2nd February), with the day after – the first day of spring in the old calendar – known as . Both and are celebrated yearly as part of the Spring Festival () in Japan. was accompanied by a number of rituals and traditions held at various levels to drive away the previous year&#x27;s bad fortunes and evil spirits for the year to come.

==History==
 has its origins in , a Chinese custom introduced to Japan in the 8th century. It was quite different from the known today. According to the Japanese history book , was first held in Japan in 706, and it was an event to ward off evil spirits held at the court on the last day of the year according to the lunar-solar calendar. At that time, was an event to drive away evil spirits that brought misfortune and disease by decorating each gate of the palace with clay figures of cows and children and using peach branches and walking sticks.

The custom of as we know it today began in the Muromachi period (1336–1573). Every household of the aristocracy and samurai class threw beans from their houses into the open air. The , a dictionary compiled during the Muromachi period, states that the practice of bean-throwing during originated from a legend in the 10th century, during the reign of Emperor Uda, that a monk on Mt. Kurama escaped misfortune by blinding with roasted beans. The Japanese word for bean, , is pronounced , which can be written as , and some believe that the pronunciation is similar to that of , meaning &#x27;to destroy the devil&#x27;, which is why people began throwing beans during .

From the Edo period (1603–1867), the custom of throwing beans at Shinto shrines, Buddhist temples, and homes of ordinary people spread throughout Japan as an event or festival to drive away evil spirits during . It was also during this period that the custom of tying roasted sardine heads to holly sprig to decorate the gates of houses during began. This custom was intended to scare away with the thorns of the holly leaves and the smell of the roasted sardines. The original form of this custom is recorded in the , compiled in 934 during the Heian period (794–1185). The diary describes a Shinto (sacred rope) that was hung on the gate of a house during the New Year&#x27;s holiday to mark the boundary of purification, and that a mullet head pierced with a sprig of holly was attached to the .

The custom of eating on began in the geisha districts from the Edo period to the Meiji period. is a special (sushi roll) eaten on . On , people face the most auspicious direction of the year and eat the whole , an uncut sushi roll, to pray for prosperity and happiness for the year. It is believed that it was originally called simply or . The name may have spread throughout Japan in 1989, when a Japanese convenience store chain renamed it and began selling it.

==Traditions==
The main ritual associated with the observance of is ; this ritual sees roasted soybeans (known as ) either thrown out of the front door, or at a member of the family wearing an (demon or ogre) mask while shouting , before slamming the door. The beans are thought to symbolically purify the home by driving away the evil spirits that bring misfortune and bad health with them. Then, as part of bringing luck in, it is customary to eat roasted soybeans, one for each year of one&#x27;s life (), plus one more for bringing good luck for the year.

The custom of first appeared in the Muromachi period, and is usually performed by either a man of the household born in the corresponding zodiac year for the new year (), or else the male head of the household.

Because Watanabe no Tsuna, a retainer of Minamoto no Yorimitsu during the Heian period (794–1185), is associated with the legend that he vanquished historically considered to be the strongest, such as Shuten-doji and Ibaraki-doji, there is a tradition that stay away from people named Watanabe and their houses. For this reason, some families with the surname Watanabe have not practiced the custom of throwing beans on Setsubun for generations. Watanabe no Tsuna was the first person to take the surname Watanabe, and Watanabe is the fifth most common surname in Japan, with approximately 1.08 million people .

Though still a somewhat common practice in households, many people will also or instead attend a shrine or temple&#x27;s spring festival, where the practice of is performed; in some areas, such as Kyoto, this involves a dance performed by apprentice geisha, after which the apprentices themselves throw packets of roasted soybeans to the crowds. In other areas, priests and invited guests throw packets of roasted soybeans, some wrapped in gold or silver foil, small envelopes with money, sweets, candies and other prizes. In some bigger and more central shrines, celebrities and sumo wrestlers are invited to celebrations, usually to events that are televised. At Sensō-ji in the Asakusa neighborhood of Tokyo, crowds of nearly 100,000 people attend the annual festivities.

===Other practices===
A number of other, in some cases more esoteric practices exist surrounding the celebration and observance of ; some are regional, such as the Kansai area tradition of eating uncut rolls, known as , in silence whilst facing the year&#x27;s lucky compass direction as determined by the zodiac symbol of that year. Though the custom originated in Osaka, it has since spread, due largely to marketing efforts by grocery and convenience stores.

Other practices include the putting up of small decorations of sardine heads and at the entrance to a house to ward off evil spirits. A special variety of sake known as brewed with ginger is also customarily drunk on . Each region of Japan has its own lucky charms to eat on . Soybeans used for and soba are the most common, but peanuts in the Hokkaido and Tōhoku region, and in the Kanto region, tea with kelp and sardines in Kansai region, konjac in Shikoku region, sea cucumber in the Oki Islands, and whale in the San&#x27;in region are also eaten.

==Historical practices==
The new year was felt to be a time when the spirit world became close to the physical world, thus the need to perform to drive away any wandering spirits that might happen too close to one&#x27;s home. Other customs during this time included religious dances, festivals, and bringing tools inside the house that might normally be left outside, to prevent the spirits from harming them. Rice cakes were also balanced on lintels and windowsills.

Because is considered to be a day set apart from the rest of the year, a tradition of role reversal in appearance and dress was also practiced; such customs included girls wearing the hairstyles of older women and vice versa, wearing disguises, and cross-dressing. This custom is still practiced among geisha and their clients when entertaining on .

, who were normally shunned during the year because they were considered vagrants, were welcomed on to perform morality plays. Their vagrancy worked to their advantage in these cases, as they were considered to take evil spirits with them.

==Regional variations==
In the Tōhoku area of Japan, the head of the household (traditionally the father) would take roasted beans in his hand, pray at the family shrine, and then toss the sanctified beans out the door. Peanuts (either raw or coated in a sweet, crunchy batter) are sometimes used in place of soybeans.

There are many variations on the famous chant. For example, in the city of Aizuwakamatsu, people chant

<doc id="516431" wikidata="Q7298489" url="?curid=516431" title="Rayleigh quotient iteration">
<text>Rayleigh quotient iteration is an eigenvalue algorithm which extends the idea of the inverse iteration by using the Rayleigh quotient to obtain increasingly accurate eigenvalue estimates.

Rayleigh quotient iteration is an iterative method, that is, it delivers a sequence of approximate solutions that converges to a true solution in the limit. Very rapid convergence is guaranteed and no more than a few iterations are needed in practice to obtain a reasonable approximation. The Rayleigh quotient iteration algorithm converges cubically for Hermitian or symmetric matrices, given an initial vector that is sufficiently close to an eigenvector of the matrix that is being analyzed.

== Algorithm ==

The algorithm is very similar to inverse iteration, but replaces the estimated eigenvalue at the end of each iteration with the Rayleigh quotient. Begin by choosing some value formula_1 as an initial eigenvalue guess for the Hermitian matrix formula_2. An initial vector formula_3 must also be supplied as initial eigenvector guess.

Calculate the next approximation of the eigenvector formula_4 by
formula_5
where formula_6 is the identity matrix,
and set the next approximation of the eigenvalue to the Rayleigh quotient of the current iteration equal to&lt;br&gt;
formula_7

To compute more than one eigenvalue, the algorithm can be combined with a deflation technique.

Note that for very small problems it is beneficial to replace the matrix inverse with the adjugate, which will yield the same iteration because it is equal to the inverse up to an irrelevant scale (the inverse of the determinant, specifically). The adjugate is easier to compute explicitly than the inverse (though the inverse is easier to apply to a vector for problems that aren&#x27;t small), and is more numerically sound because it remains well defined as the eigenvalue converges.

== Example ==

Consider the matrix

:formula_8

for which the exact eigenvalues are formula_9, formula_10 and formula_11, with corresponding eigenvectors

:formula_12, formula_13 and formula_14.

(where formula_15 is the golden ratio).

The largest eigenvalue is formula_16 and corresponds to any eigenvector proportional to formula_17

We begin with an initial eigenvalue guess of

:formula_18.

Then, the first iteration yields

:formula_19

the second iteration,

:formula_20

and the third,

:formula_21

from which the cubic convergence is evident.

== Octave implementation ==

The following is a simple implementation of the algorithm in Octave.
function x = rayleigh(A, epsilon, mu, x)
 x = x / norm(x);
 % the backslash operator in Octave solves a linear system
 y = (A - mu * eye(rows(A))) \ x; 
 lambda = y&#x27; * x;
 mu = mu + 1 / lambda
 err = norm(y - lambda * x) / norm(y)

 while err &gt; epsilon
 x = y / norm(y);
 y = (A - mu * eye(rows(A))) \ x;
 lambda = y&#x27; * x;
 mu = mu + 1 / lambda
 err = norm(y - lambda * x) / norm(y)
 end

<doc id="516432" wikidata="Q1467607" url="?curid=516432" title="From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)">
<text>From the Earth to the Moon is a twelve-part 1998 HBO television miniseries co-produced by Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Tom Hanks and Michael Bostick. In docudrama format, it tells the story of the Apollo program during the 1960s and early 1970s. Largely based on Andrew Chaikin&#x27;s 1994 book, &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot;, the series is known for its accurate telling of the story of Apollo and the special effects under visual director Ernest D. Farino. The series takes its title from, but is not based upon, Jules Verne&#x27;s 1865 science fiction novel &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;.

Hanks appears in every episode, introducing each of the first eleven. The twelfth and final episode, represented in pseudo-documentary format, is narrated by Blythe Danner, interspersed with a reenactment of the production of Georges Méliès&#x27; 1902 film &quot;Le Voyage dans la Lune&quot;, also in part inspired by Verne&#x27;s novel. Hanks narrates and appears in these scenes as Méliès&#x27; assistant, with Tchéky Karyo as Méliès.

==Cast==
The miniseries has a fairly large cast. It portrays 30 of the 32 astronauts who flew, or were preparing to fly, the 12 missions of the Apollo program. (The only two Apollo astronauts not portrayed by credited actors are Apollo 13 Command Module pilot Jack Swigert, who is heard but not seen in Episode 8, and Apollo 17 Command Module pilot Ronald Evans, who has a brief appearance in the liftoff scene of Apollo 17 in the final episode.) Members of many of the astronauts&#x27; families, and other NASA and non-NASA personnel, are also portrayed.

Several fictional (or fictionalized) characters are also included, notably television newscaster Emmett Seaborn (Lane Smith) who appears in nine of the 12 episodes.

Astronaut David Scott, from Apollo 15, was the chief technological consultant.

==Episodes==
The 12 episodes, each directed by a different person, use a variety of viewpoints and themes, while sequentially covering the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs. Lane Smith portrays Emmett Seaborn, a seasoned reporter for a fictional television network who covers the U.S. space program from its earliest days, providing continuity for most of the episodes.

==Integration with existing films==
The miniseries, concentrating on the Apollo space program, was produced with an intent not to repeat other dramatic portrayals of events of the space race.

Project Mercury, which was portrayed in the 1983 film &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, was briefly summarized in the first episode. Miniseries producers Hanks, Howard and Grazer, who had previously produced the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, shot the episode &quot;We Interrupt This Program&quot; from the perspective of the media covering that flight, as the film had already covered the story from the point of view of the crew and the mission control team.

==Production==
Many of the actors had opportunity to interact and form friendships with the real life astronauts they were portraying. Brett Cullen, who played Apollo 9 Command Module pilot and Apollo 15 commander David Scott, was invited to the Scott family home each time an episode he appeared in was first televised. Two short clips from the final scenes of &quot;Apollo 13&quot; were used in &quot;That&#x27;s All There Is&quot;; a splashdown sequence, and a view of the recovery ship USS &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; (portrayed by USS &quot;New Orleans&quot;).

The original series was shot in Super 35, intended to be viewed on standard television sets of the time in 1.33:1 aspect ratio. With the proliferation of widescreen flat-panel TV sets the series was remastered in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio and re-released in 2005 as a 5-disc DVD box set. As is the case with most material shot in this format, the widescreen framing causes the loss (in some shots) of the top and bottom parts of the frames from the original broadcast, but reveals additional information on the left and right. This is not always noticeable because of careful transfer process, but in some scenes important details are lost. For example, in the first episode, when the Gemini 8 / Agena assembly is tumbling around in space with a stuck thruster, the thruster is not visible in the new widescreen version, as it is cut off by the top of the frame. Some captions have also been compromised.

Parts of the miniseries were filmed at the Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios) in Orlando, Florida. Scenes of the moonwalks were shot inside the blimp hangars on a former Marine base in Tustin, California. Approximately half the area inside was converted to the Moon&#x27;s surface, with the remainder used to hold production trailers. To simulate lunar surface gravity, weather balloons filled with helium were attached to the backs of the actors playing the astronauts in the lunar extravehicular activity scenes, effectively reducing their weights to one-sixth.

The score of &quot;Spider&quot; prominently features an imitation of the main title theme from the 1963 World War II movie &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, and Tom Kelly jokes about having a crew digging a tunnel out of the Grumman plant. The episode also featured a real Apollo Lunar Module (LM-13), which had been built for the Apollo 18 mission but was never used due to budget cuts.

<text>The 1897 Quebec general election was held on May 11, 1897, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Quebec Liberal Party, led by Félix-Gabriel Marchand, defeated the incumbent Quebec Conservative Party, led by Edmund James Flynn.

This marked the start of over 39 consecutive years in power for the Liberals. The Conservative Party never held power again in Quebec, and ceased to exist in 1936 when it merged with the Action libérale nationale to form the Union Nationale, which formed a government later that year.

Marchand died in office in 1900, and was succeeded by Simon-Napoléon Parent as Liberal leader and premier.

==Additional Assembly seat==
An Act passed in 1895 provided for the Îles-de-la-Madeleine to be separated from Gaspé for the subsequent election, and thus elect their own MLA.

<doc id="516452" wikidata="Q1192658" url="?curid=516452" title="Minigame">
<text>A minigame (also spelled mini game and mini-game, sometimes called a subgame or microgame) is a short game often contained within another video game. A minigame contains different gameplay elements and is often smaller or more simplistic than the game in which it is contained.

Some video games consist entirely of minigames which tie into an overall theme, such as &quot;Olympic Decathlon&quot; (1980). Minigames can also be used to represent a specific experience, such as hacking, lock picking, or scanning an area, that ties into a larger game.

== Minigame compilations ==
Some games are made up of many minigames strung together into one video game, such as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;WarioWare&quot; series (which are called microgames in the series), Universal&#x27;s &quot;Video Action&quot;, David Whittaker&#x27;s &quot;Lazy Jones&quot; and the mobile game &quot;Phone Story&quot;. Some similar games specifically developed for multiplayer are considered party games, such as the &quot;Itadaki Street&quot; series by Square Enix and Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario Party&quot; series. In party games, minigames usually involve performing an activity faster or collecting more of a specified item than other players to win; some may be entirely luck.
== Examples ==

The &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series includes minigames in every entry, since the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; (1987), in which a 15 puzzle in the form of an Easter egg can be uncovered by entering a specific sequence of inputs while piloting a ship. It was added into the game by programmer Nasir Gebelli despite it not being part of Squaresoft&#x27;s original game design.

The PocketStation for PlayStation and VMU for Dreamcast accessories allowed the user to download minigames from the main console onto the pocket device, and often then sync progress in the minigame back on to the console. Two examples of this include the &quot;Chocobo World&quot; minigame inside &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;.

<doc id="516456" wikidata="Q3244829" url="?curid=516456" title="List of bridges in Canada">
<text>This is a list of bridges and viaducts in Canada, including those for pedestrians and vehicular traffic.

== Historical and architectural interest bridges ==
There are only a few covered bridges left in Canada. In Quebec, despite over 1,200 existing in the last century, today there are only 88 remaining. In New Brunswick, 58 covered bridges have been identified.
== Major road and railway bridges ==
Canada&#x27;s longest bridge is the Confederation Bridge in the Gulf of St. Lawrence with a total of between abutments, it&#x27;s also the world&#x27;s longest bridge over ice-covered water. More than 5,000 local workers helped with the project, which cost about $1 billion.

The Quebec Bridge has been the longest cantilever bridge span in the world since 1917, measuring between its two piles. It held the record of all-categories longest span in the world until the opening of the Ambassador Bridge. It’s the last bridge that broke such a record before suspension bridges hold the award by far. It was designated a National Historic Sites of Canada in 1995.

In 1929, the Ambassador Bridge between Canada and United States surpassed the Quebec Bridge with a main span and became the longest crossing in the world until the inauguration of the George Washington Bridge in 1931 in New York City which almost doubled the range hitherto achieved.

Studies have been carried out for crossing the Saguenay River near Tadoussac just before the confluence with the St. Lawrence River, the latest project presented by the COWI A/S company includes the construction of a span suspension bridge with a clearance above the river.

This table presents the structures with spans greater than 100 meters (non-exhaustive list).
== The old bridges over the Niagara ==
This part lists all the former bridges which succeeded one another on the Niagara River between the towns of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Queenston in Canada and Niagara Falls, New York, and Lewiston, in United States. The Whirlpool Rapids Bridge (1897), the Rainbow Bridge (1941) and the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge (1962), still in service are listed in the &quot;Major road and railway bridges&quot; part above.

<doc id="516460" wikidata="Q2567153" url="?curid=516460" title="Janice Soprano">
<text>Janice Soprano Baccalieri is a fictional character in the HBO television drama series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and in the film &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;. She is the eldest sibling of the show&#x27;s protagonist, Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini). On the show, she is portrayed by Aida Turturro, and a young Janice appears in flashbacks portrayed by Madeline Blue and Juliet Fox. Alexandra Intrator portrays a young Janice Soprano in the 2021 prequel film, &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;.

==Background==
Presented as the oldest child of mobster Johnny Boy Soprano and Livia Soprano in a household financed by crime; Janice grew complacent about her family&#x27;s criminal ties. She is portrayed as having a very callous and rebellious nature.

In the show, after graduating from Sacred Heart High School, Janice joined an ashram in Venice, Los Angeles, the character adopting the name Parvati Wasatch. Janice, under her new name, traveled across Europe, staying in Paris, France, and Sri Lanka, and married a Québécois man named Eugene. In the series, the couple had a son named Harpo &quot;Hal&quot; named after the song &quot;Harpo&#x27;s Blues&quot; by Phoebe Snow. Eugene later took him back to Montreal and Janice unsuccessfully tried to petition the State Department to have him returned to her.

She worked as a furniture mover and at an espresso bar in Olympia, Washington before finally moving back to New Jersey permanently. Since returning to New Jersey Janice is shown to re-invent herself from an aging rebel to an upscale, materialistic, North Jersey Italian housewife.

Janice is portrayed as a chronic malingerer, with the people around her often holding the opinion she is lazy and has no work ethic, filing for disability benefits in Washington for alleged carpal tunnel syndrome, and using her claim of newly contracted Epstein–Barr to excuse herself from her household duties.

Her relationship with Tony is often shown to be strained in nature, as he still holds her responsible for abandoning the family and leaving him to deal with their abusive mother alone.

==Biography==

In season two, Janice returns to Newark, New Jersey, ostensibly to take care of her sick mother. Her high school boyfriend, Richie Aprile (David Proval), is a DiMeo crime family capo who is released from prison around the same time. When Tony and Richie begin feuding, Janice exacerbates the situation by telling Richie that he is being unfairly treated and even suggests making a move against Tony. Richie is initially reluctant to do so.

Richie causes problems for Tony that are only made more complicated by his engagement to Janice. Tony is unhappy with the engagement, and both Janice and Richie flaunt their status to Tony by planning an extravagant wedding and putting an offer on an expensive house in Short Hills, New Jersey despite Richie still having a no-show job working as a fishmonger.

Tony orders Richie killed after Uncle Junior (Dominic Chianese) informs him of Richie&#x27;s plan to &quot;move against him&quot;. After an incident of domestic violence in which Richie punches her in the face, Janice shoots and kills Richie and calls on her brother to dispose of the body. She then moves back to Seattle and becomes briefly engaged to a 19-year-old.

In season three, Janice returns to New Jersey following the death of her mother. After Livia&#x27;s death, Janice becomes obsessed with acquiring her mother&#x27;s valuable record collection, which Livia gave to her nurse, Svetlana (Alla Kliouka Schaffer). Janice, feeling that she should rightfully have the records, absconds with Svetlana&#x27;s prosthetic leg. She tells Svetlana that the leg will not be returned until she receives the records. Svetlana has friends connected with the Russian Mafia physically assault Janice until she reveals the location of the leg.

Tony visits her at the hospital and angrily tells her that since she has been assaulted, he is now forced to retaliate and risk facing a war with the Russians or else lose respect. After the assault against her, she briefly becomes a born-again Christian. Janice&#x27;s next phase is marked by a brief interest in a Christian music career, as well as an equally brief live-in relationship with her narcoleptic boyfriend, Aaron Arkaway (Turk Pipkin).

In season four, after the death of Jackie Aprile Jr. (Jason Cerbone), Janice embarks on a clandestine relationship with Ralph Cifaretto (Joe Pantoliano), who is in a relationship with Jackie&#x27;s mother Rosalie Aprile (Sharon Angela). With the help of her feminist therapist, Janice soon reaches the conclusion that her affair with Ralph is a mistake. After Ralph happily tells her that he is no longer seeing Rosalie Aprile and plans to move in with her, Janice responds by flying into a rage, pushing him down a flight of stairs and screaming at him to leave. Sometime later, Tony asks Janice about Ralph&#x27;s bizarre sexual fetishes, of which he had recently become aware. She refuses to tell him anything at first, ostensibly to protect Ralph&#x27;s privacy. When Tony offers her money, however, she immediately tells him everything he wants to know.

Following Ralph&#x27;s disappearance, Janice sets her sights on the newly widowed Bobby Baccalieri (Steve Schirripa), another of Tony&#x27;s &quot;caporegimes&quot;, whose fidelity to his wife while she was alive, and obvious adoration of her after her death makes him especially appealing. Initially, Janice serves Bobby&#x27;s dinners, sometimes claiming other women&#x27;s plates as her own, and informally dates him. Frustrated with Bobby&#x27;s refusal to commit, she sends Bobby&#x27;s children instant messages under a false screen name, claiming to be watching them, in an attempt to scare them.

This ploy succeeds, driving Bobby and his children into her arms for comfort from the supposed stalker. Although mainly acting out of her desires, she does help Bobby by pushing him to do a task for her uncle Junior that he has been putting off due to grief. She attends her uncle&#x27;s racketeering trial and assists Bobby with taking care of Junior.

By the beginning of season five, Janice and Bobby are married. She is shown to have a difficult relationship with her stepchildren. She attacks a soccer player&#x27;s mother at Sophia&#x27;s Peewee soccer match and injures her badly enough to require hospitalization, garnering her an assault charge, and to Tony&#x27;s displeasure, unwanted TV news coverage mentioning his name and line of work. Bobby insists that she attend anger management counseling. While it briefly has the desired effect, Tony, in doubt and jealous of Janice&#x27;s newfound peace of mind, purposefully obstructs her progress by taunting her about her missing son.

By season six, Janice and Bobby have a baby girl together, Domenica. Janice encourages Tony to officially let Bobby take over Junior&#x27;s old crew which causes the two to have an angry argument. One day when neither Janice nor Bobby can look after a mentally-declining Junior, Tony angrily volunteers. Confusing Tony for an associate he ordered murdered years ago, Junior shoots Tony in the abdomen. Janice is shown to be deeply affected by her brother&#x27;s hospitalized state.

In the episode &quot;Moe n&#x27; Joe&quot;, Janice is seen as a commanding force in the household, setting boundaries for both Bobby Jr and Bobby Sr. Janice confronts Tony about his disdain for Bobby, and Tony refuses to admit his true feelings on the subject: Tony blames Bobby—and Janice, to some extent—for his near-fatal shooting by Junior.

In the show, Tony angrily confides to Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) that Janice &quot;gets nothing&quot; because she didn&#x27;t hold the same trauma and scars from their mother since she left home almost immediately after high school. Later in the episode, Tony lets go of his hostility and compensates Janice and Bobby by persuading an imprisoned John Sacrimoni (Vincent Curatola) to sell them his house at half price. Tony grows closer to Bobby, with Tony entrusting him with more responsibility and Bobby becoming a profitable player for the family in the process.

Janice and Bobby inherit the late Bobby, Sr.&#x27;s cottage in northern New York state, to which they invite Tony and Carmela (Edie Falco) for Tony&#x27;s 47th birthday. At the party, Janice gives Tony a gift of Soprano family home videos. She tells Carmela an anecdote that embarrasses Tony over a heated, drunken game of Monopoly.

Bobby later loses his temper and punches Tony in the face after Tony makes offensive remarks about Janice, leading to a fight which Bobby wins, much to Tony&#x27;s chagrin. As revenge, Tony orders Bobby, who has never killed anyone, to go to Canada and carry out a contract killing. Bobby wins Tony&#x27;s favor defending Janice&#x27;s honor, and he is soon elevated into Tony&#x27;s inner circle, largely displacing Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli).

Janice suggests to Tony that he help pay to keep Uncle Junior—whose money has run out—in a private care facility, but Tony refuses and makes it clear Junior is dead to him. Angered by Janice and Bobby&#x27;s perceived disloyalty, Tony tells her that he is going to exile Bobby from his life, although this is just an empty threat.

Soon after that conversation, Bobby is murdered by the hitmen of Phil Leotardo (Frank Vincent) while buying a model train in a hobby store, making Janice a widow. Tony visits her afterward, and after a brief conversation assures her that he is there for her if she needs him. Janice desires to continue raising Bobby&#x27;s children, Bobby III and Sophia with her daughter Domenica, but their grandparents also seek custody. Their fate remains unknown, although the two have previously shown contempt for Janice.

Janice&#x27;s other focus seems to be on whatever assets she might receive including those from Uncle Junior. This prompts Tony to make a deal with &quot;Uncle Pat&quot; ensuring Junior&#x27;s estate will go into a trust that will benefit Bobby&#x27;s children and not Janice. Tony also extracts a promise from Phil Leotardo&#x27;s men to pay a settlement to Janice, after Phil&#x27;s vendetta against Tony led to Bobby&#x27;s murder.

<doc id="516463" wikidata="Q115285" url="?curid=516463" title="The Return of the King (1980 film)">
<text>The Return of the King (also known as The Return of the King: A Story of the Hobbits) is a 1980 American-Japanese animated musical fantasy television film created by Rankin/Bass and Topcraft. It is an adaptation of part of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s 1955 high fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It takes its name from &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, the third and final volume of the novel, and is a sequel to the 1977 film &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

The special aired on ABC on Sunday, May 11, 1980 after a legal challenge filed by the Tolkien Estate and Fantasy Films was settled. Both critics and fans gave &quot;The Return of the King&quot; a lukewarm welcome.

==Plot==
Gandalf briefly narrates the background. Then, at Bilbo Baggins&#x27;s 129th birthday party in Rivendell, his nephew Frodo explains why he is missing a finger from his hand while the Minstrel of Gondor sings a ballad that tells the story of the quest to destroy the One Ring and defeat the Dark Lord Sauron.

In Mordor, Frodo&#x27;s friend and companion Samwise Gamgee bears the Ring in Frodo&#x27;s absence as he ventures to rescue Frodo from the Orc fortress of Cirith Ungol. During his journey, Sam is tempted to claim the Ring for himself, but ultimately resists its power. He rescues Frodo, and the two Hobbits head out for Mount Doom to destroy the Ring.

Meanwhile, the wizard Gandalf the White and the Hobbit Pippin arrive at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor, the Steward of Gondor, about the upcoming war—only to discover that the Steward has gone insane and means to take his own life. Frodo and Samwise continue toward Mount Doom (eluding Ringwraiths and infiltrating a battalion of Orcs in the process) only to be attacked by Gollum, the creature from whom Bilbo took the Ring decades before. Frodo casts Gollum down, however, and goes to the Crack of Doom. Sam prepares to kill Gollum, but is overcome with pity and allows him to flee.

At the same time, Gondor&#x27;s neighbouring country, Rohan, battles Sauron&#x27;s forces in the Battle of Pelennor Fields, but its King, Theoden, is killed by the Witch-king of Angmar. Theoden&#x27;s niece Eowyn, who had disguised herself as a man to take part in the battle, kills the Witch-king with help from Merry, momentarily defeating Sauron&#x27;s armies. Those forces momentarily rally upon the arrival of the black fleet coming from the west, the despairing vision of which drove Denethor to his suicide, but their morale shatters upon realizing that fleet is under the command of Prince Aragorn of Gondor. Upon his own arrival, Aragorn, heir to the throne of Gondor, plans to confront Sauron at the Black Gate. Here, he quarrels with the Mouth of Sauron and the two armies prepare for battle.

On Mount Doom, Frodo succumbs to the Ring&#x27;s power and puts it on, becoming invisible. Sam discovers Gollum and Frodo fighting over the Ring, which results in Gollum&#x27;s biting off Frodo&#x27;s finger to claim it. While dancing with joy at the retrieval of his &quot;precious&quot;, Gollum falls into the lava of Mount Doom, taking the Ring with him. The Ring is destroyed, and Sauron perishes. Sam and Frodo are rescued by the Eagles from the erupting Mount Doom. A few months later, Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor.

The story concludes with Frodo accompanying Bilbo, Gandalf, and Elrond as they leave Middle-earth. He gives the &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot; (consisting of Bilbo&#x27;s memoirs with some spare pages) to Sam, assuring him that a good life is still in store for him. Gandalf assures them that Hobbits will someday have descendants among humans, to preserve their own existence; and the film ends with Frodo&#x27;s departure from the Grey Havens.

==Production==

After the 1977 broadcast of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; on NBC, development and production began on &quot;The Return of the King&quot; at Rankin/Bass Productions in New York City under supervision of Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass. The film&#x27;s original working title was Frodo, The Hobbit II. It was written by Romeo Muller with Rankin doing the script, designs for the characters and storyboards. The original cast from the previous film returned to reprise the voices of the characters with new actors joining them.

Orson Bean returned as the voice of the older Bilbo Baggins, as well as that of the story&#x27;s hero, Frodo Baggins. John Huston came back as well, as the wizard Gandalf, and co-starring with them were: William Conrad as Denethor, Roddy McDowall as Samwise Gamgee, Theodore Bikel as Aragorn, and reprising his role of Gollum, Brother Theodore. Rankin/Bass stalwart Paul Frees replaced the late Cyril Ritchard as the voice of Elrond; Casey Kasem was Merry, with Sonny Melendrez as Pippin; Nellie Bellflower as Éowyn; and Glenn Yarbrough returned as principal vocalist, billed here as simply &quot;the Minstrel of Gondor&quot;. Thurl Ravenscroft served in the chorus. Once the character voices were recorded, along with background music by Maury Laws, with Jules Bass writing songs and lyrics for the film, the animation production was done by Topcraft in Japan under supervision of Toru Hara, Tsuguyuki Kubo, Kazuyuki Kobayashi and others.

The release was threatened by a lawsuit filed by the Tolkien Estate and Fantasy Films on the basis that Rankin/Bass had not secured the U.S. and Canadian television rights to the book. The lawsuit was settled &quot;amicably&quot;, allowing it to proceed with a May 1980 release.

The film is often mistaken for a sequel to Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 animated film &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. After Rankin/Bass became defunct in 1987, Warner Bros. acquired the rights to the special for home video distribution and chose to market the film, along with &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, as instalments of an animated Tolkien trilogy, with Bakshi&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (by then also owned by Warner Bros., from United Artists) acting as the middle chapter. This false promotion led to rumours that Rankin/Bass had originally decided to produce &quot;The Return of the King&quot; upon hearing that Bakshi&#x27;s sequel to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; had been cancelled. However, Rankin/Bass had always planned on making &quot;The Return of the King&quot; as a follow-up to their production of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, even before the release of Bakshi&#x27;s film.

==Reception==

The film has garnered mixed reviews from modern sources. Charles Cassidy of Common Sense Media gave it a score of 3/5, and said, &quot;Cartoon tale is darker, more complex than others in series&quot;. Steven D. Greydanus of Decent Films Guide gave it a C, and said, &quot;Works even less well than &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, which really is a children&#x27;s story… overbearing folk-ballad soundtrack doesn&#x27;t even gesture lyrically to Tolkien&#x27;s poetry&quot;. 

Director Arthur Rankin Jr. later stated, &quot;We tried to do &quot;Return of the King&quot;... but it is an awful lot to put into it. I think [Peter] Jackson is having the same problem in his films. You can&#x27;t deviate from these books, or somebody&#x27;ll wait on the street for you! ...[In] &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, we had to summarize what had happened before, and then put it all together in 2 hours. It&#x27;s not a very good film.&quot; Asked why he chose only to make &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, instead of making the entire &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, Rankin admitted, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know that the audience would sit still for it. I was wrong.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;The Return of the King&quot; was first released on CED videodisc by RCA in 1979 and later on VHS by Warner Home Video in 1991, and for the second time as part of the &quot;Warner Bros. Classic Tales&quot; video collection in 1996. The film has been available on DVD since 2001, both individually and as a &quot;boxed trilogy&quot; with Rankin/Bass&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and Bakshi&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

<doc id="516472" wikidata="Q6689505" url="?curid=516472" title="Louisville Male High School">
<text>Louisville Male Traditional High School is a public co-ed secondary school serving students in grades 9 through 12 in the southside of Louisville, Kentucky, USA. It is part of the Jefferson County Public School District.

==History==
===Ninth and Chestnut (1856–1897)===

Male was founded in 1856, being the oldest high school west of the Allegheny Mountains. In 1861, Male was designated The University of Public Schools of Louisville and awarded bachelor&#x27;s degrees until 1921, after other high schools were established in the years following. the school was named Louisville Male High School due to a separate Louisville Girls High School. The &quot;H&quot; was kept as the school&#x27;s letter due to being the original high school.

===Corner of Brook Street and Breckinridge Street (1915–1991)===

In the years after World War I, Male&#x27;s academic offerings included a corps of cadets and a Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps. From 1921 to 1932, these programs were led by Brigadier General James R. Lindsay.

In the 1970s, Male was chosen as the Traditional High School, becoming the first magnet program in the school district.
In 1976, an early-morning bomb explosion on Labor Day caused damage to the school&#x27;s gymnasium; it occurred during several days of anti-busing protests in the Louisville area. The FBI was called in to investigate.

This location () is now owned by the Salvation Army and is a historic landmark in Louisville.

===Durrett Campus (1991–present)===
In August 1991, Male moved to its current campus at 4409 Preston Highway, an educational facility that doubled the instructional, laboratory, library and campus space. Since it has moved to this location, the school has won two U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon awards. The site was previously Sallie P. Durrett High School, which became the Durrett Education Center in the early 1980s and was used by Jefferson County Public Schools Library Media Services until 1991. The adjoining Gheens Academy, which opened in 1983, was previously Prestonia Elementary School.

=== Gheens Academy ===
Gheens Academy opened in 1983 after having previously been Prestonia Elementary School. Gheens is a separate building from male and functions as a place for other classrooms. Classes in Gheens are generally more oriented towards elective activities and other arts. Gheen academy was temporarily home to the W.E.B. DuBois Academy.

==Academics==

The school runs a unique curriculum that is different from the other public high schools in the city. All students participate in the College Preparatory Program so as to aid in a smooth the transition to higher education.

Students have an opportunity to graduate with a Commonwealth Diploma, which demands more than the required units for graduating high school in JCPS. One of the stipulations is the successful completion (i.e., receiving a grade of &quot;C&quot; or its equivalent) in 6 AP courses in the areas of English, science/mathematics, foreign language, and elective.

==Athletics==
On Saturday, November 18, 1893, the annual Male-Manual football rivalry, the longest running, continuously played, high school football series in Kentucky, began. Their football team is a perennial state power, and in addition to its long-running rivalry with duPont Manual High School, Male is also a close rival with St. Xavier High School, with the annual contest usually determining the fate of the district champion; however, due to the state&#x27;s realignment of high school football into a six-class system starting in 2007–08, Male also has a rivalry with Trinity High School in football.
The school offers football, basketball, baseball, softball, bowling, tennis, soccer, field hockey, wrestling, swimming, track and field, lacrosse, and Marching Band.

===Venues===

Maxwell Field, formerly called High School Park, is the football stadium located behind Male&#x27;s former location at the Brook and Breck campus.

Veterans Memorial Stadium is the current football stadium, located behind the Durrett campus. It is named in memory of the schools alumni who have died in World War II.

Edwards Field is the current baseball field for the school, named after Bill Edwards. The Field is also home to the W. Clyde Glass Press Box.

<doc id="516474" wikidata="Q74229" url="?curid=516474" title="The Hobbit (1977 film)">
<text>The Hobbit is a 1977 American animated musical television special created by Rankin/Bass and animated by Topcraft. The film is an adaptation of the 1937 book of the same name by J. R. R. Tolkien; it was first broadcast on NBC in the United States on Sunday, November 27, 1977. The teleplay won a Peabody Award; the film received a Christopher Award.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; found the film &quot;curiously eclectic&quot;, but felt that whatever its failings, it warranted attention. The Tolkien scholar Douglas A. Anderson called the adaptation &quot;execrable&quot;; the author Baird Searles called it an &quot;abomination&quot; and an attempt that had &quot;failed miserably&quot;, regretting the quality of the animation and of the soundtrack, and the omission of key plot points.

== Plot ==

A hobbit named Bilbo Baggins lives in his hobbit-hole. The wizard Gandalf informs him he is looking for someone to share an adventure, and introduces thirteen dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield. They invite themselves in, eat dinner, and play music. The magic in the music makes Bilbo suddenly long for adventure.

Thorin explains Bilbo is to be a lucky number fourteen for them, and tells how his dwarves were driven out of the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, who stole their treasure. Gandalf accepts the mission before the Hobbit can speak.

The company discovers a camp of three trolls, who capture all but Gandalf and Bilbo. Bilbo hides while Gandalf uses his magic to bring the sunrise, which turns the trolls to stone. In the troll&#x27;s cave, Bilbo discovers some stolen treasure, which the dwarves claim. They find two swords, and a dagger for Bilbo. Gandalf shows Thorin a map of the Lonely Mountain and a key, given to him by Thorin&#x27;s father. The map shows a secret passage.

Travelling through the Misty Mountains, all but Gandalf are captured by goblins. Gandalf kills the Great Goblin, and the dwarves escape. Bilbo loses the group; he finds an underground lake, where he discovers a ring, and meets the monster Gollum, who hunts him. Bilbo, discovering the ring grants invisibility, follows Gollum to the door, and escapes.

The goblins, riding Wargs, pursue the company into a pine forest, setting it ablaze. The Lord of the Eagles rescues the company, and carries them to Mirkwood; Gandalf leaves. Bilbo and the dwarves are captured by giant spiders, but Bilbo puts on his ring and drives off the spiders with his dagger. The dwarves are apprehended by the wood elves. Bilbo escapes using his ring. After weeks of searching, Bilbo pilfers a sleeping guard&#x27;s keys, and floats the dwarves in barrels down the river into Laketown.

The people of Laketown nurse the company back to health. The fourteen reach the Lonely Mountain, and follow the map&#x27;s instructions to enter. Bilbo goes in first, and meets Smaug, using the ring to hide. He and Smaug converse; the dragon assumes Bilbo must be a Laketowner. Bilbo discovers a patch of skin on Smaug not covered by protective scales. When Smaug attacks him for stealing, he escapes, mocking the dragon. In a rage, Smaug flies off to take revenge on Laketown. Bilbo sends a thrush to tell Bard about the bare patch, and Bard shoots Smaug with his family&#x27;s black arrow. Smaug destroys Laketown in his death throes.

The Dwarves reclaim their treasure, only to find that the Lakemen and the Elves have arrived, wanting recompense for Smaug&#x27;s many damages over the years. Thorin refuses to share, and declares war. Bilbo rebukes him, as they are outnumbered; Thorin is angered. Thorin&#x27;s cousin, Dain, brings more dwarves. Gandalf arrives, warning that the Goblins are coming. Men, elves, and dwarves unite, and Bilbo uses his ring to hide as battle rages. The Eagles join the fight.

Bilbo finds a wounded Bombur who informs him that the battle has been won. Only seven of the thirteen dwarves are left. Bilbo is led by Gandalf to the dying Thorin, who forgives him. Bilbo accepts two small chests of gold and his dagger as payment. Gandalf escorts him home. Gandalf warns him that the adventure is only just beginning, thanks to the ring he has found.

== Voice cast ==

The voice actors for the characters were:

* Orson Bean – Bilbo Baggins
* Richard Boone – Smaug
* Hans Conried – Thorin Oakenshield
* John Huston – Gandalf / Narrator
* Otto Preminger – The Elvenking
* Cyril Ritchard – Elrond
* Brother Theodore – Gollum

* Don Messick – Balin, Goblin, Lord of the Eagles, Troll #3

* Glenn Yarbrough – The Balladeer
* Thurl Ravenscroft – Goblin (singing voice), Background voice

== Production ==

The film was produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass of Rankin/Bass Productions in New York City. It was adapted for the screen by Romeo Muller; Rankin took on the additional duties of production designer. When interviewed for the film, Rankin declared that he would add nothing to the story that was not in the original. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; cost $3 million to produce.
In a 2003 interview, Rankin stated, &quot;I love the Tolkien work&quot;. He explained that he was able to make the film because &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was still in the public domain at the time, despite claims to the contrary from the copyright holders.

The story&#x27;s protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, is voiced by Orson Bean, backed up by Hollywood director and actor John Huston as the voice of Gandalf. In supporting roles, the comedian and performance artist Brother Theodore voiced Gollum, and Thurl Ravenscroft performed the baritone singing voices of the goblins. The gravelly voice of the dragon Smaug was provided by Richard Boone, with Hans Conried as Thorin Oakenshield. 

&quot;The Hobbit&quot; was animated by Topcraft in Tokyo, a now-defunct Japanese animation studio whose animation team re-formed as Studio Ghibli under Hayao Miyazaki; some of the animators went on to establish Pacific Animation Corporation. According to Rankin, the visual style of the film took its cue from the early illustrations of Arthur Rackham.

While Topcraft produced the animation overseas, the concept artwork was completed at the Rankin/Bass studio under Rankin&#x27;s direction. Rhode Island artist Lester Abrams did the initial designs for most of the characters; Rankin had seen Abrams&#x27; illustrations to an excerpt from &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in &quot;Children&#x27;s Digest&quot;. 

Harry N. Abrams published a large, illustrated coffee table edition of the book featuring concept art and stills. Jules Bass adapted Tolkien&#x27;s original lyrics for the film&#x27;s musical interludes, drawn primarily from the songs in the book. He assisted Maury Laws, Rankin/Bass&#x27;s composer and conductor-in-residence in the composition of an original theme song, &quot;The Greatest Adventure (The Ballad of the Hobbit)&quot;, sung by Glenn Yarbrough: it was the film&#x27;s sole original song. The folk ballad came to be associated with Yarbrough, who reprised it in the soundtrack to &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
In 1978, Romeo Muller won a Peabody Award for his teleplay for &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. The film won a Christopher Award. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, but lost to &quot;Star Wars&quot;. 
A few days before its first airing, John J. O&#x27;Connor wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;Rankin and Bass Productions have now carefully translated &quot;The Hobbit&quot; into film. The result is curiously eclectic, but filled with nicely effective moments... The drawings frequently suggest strong resemblances to non-Tolkien characters... The goblins could have stepped out of a Maurice Sendak book. But... the Dragon and Gollum the riddle aficionado bring some clever original touches... Whatever its flaws, this television version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; warrants attention.&quot;
Criticism primarily focused on adaptation issues, including the unfamiliar style of artwork used by the Japanese-American co-production team. Some Tolkien fans questioned the appropriateness of repackaging the material as a family film for a very young audience. The scholar Douglas A. Anderson called the adaptation &quot;execrable&quot; in the introduction to his book &quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot;, although he did not elaborate; and a few critics said it was confusing for those not already familiar with the plot. The science fiction author Baird Searles criticized the adaptation, calling it an &quot;abomination&quot; and an attempt that had &quot;failed miserably&quot;. He singled out the quality of animation, the omission of key plot points such as Beorn and the Arkenstone, and the soundtrack.
&quot;IGN&quot; gave the film 7 out of 10, recommending it to fans of the novel. 

== Release ==

Before &quot;The Hobbit&quot; aired on NBC, Rankin/Bass and its partner animation houses began preparing a sequel. Meanwhile, United Artists released &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s The Lord of the Rings&quot; in 1978, an animated adaptation directed by Ralph Bakshi, originally intended as the first part in a two-part film. United Artists&#x27;s sequel would soon be cancelled after a disagreement with Bakshi. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; first aired as an animated television special in 1977.

Disney released &quot;The Hobbit&quot; on LP with the soundtrack and dialogue from the film in 1977 through its Buena Vista Records label. An edited version, along with accompanying &quot;storyteller read-alongs&quot;, was later issued for the Mouse Factory&#x27;s Disneyland Records imprint.

&quot;The Hobbit&quot; was released by ABC Video Enterprises in the early 1980s on Betamax and VHS by Sony, and CED by RCA. Warner Home Video released the film on VHS in 1991, again in 1996 (as part of the &quot;Warner Bros. Classic Tales&quot; VHS line), and on DVD in 2001 (through Warner Bros. Family Entertainment), but missing some of the sound effects. Parade Video released the film on DVD and VHS in 2004.

The film was released on DVD by Warner Bros. as part of a DVD trilogy boxed set, which includes Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the Rankin/Bass production of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. A remastered deluxe edition DVD was released in 2014.

<doc id="516475" wikidata="Q1851579" url="?curid=516475" title="Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union">
<text>The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was responsible for managing and directing the day-to-day operations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, while the Politburo was charged with the policy-making aspects of the party. The Secretariat was a component agency of the party&#x27;s Central Committee.

==Overview==
The members of the Secretariat were elected by the Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee, although in all but the first years of its existence the elections were a formality since decisions were made by the senior leadership before the voting. The General Secretary of the CPSU, who was also a Politburo member, was the leader of the Secretariat and of the Party. Dual membership in the Secretariat and the Politburo was in practice reserved for two or three very senior members of the Soviet leadership, and in the post-Stalin era (after March 1953) was a stepping-stone to ultimate power. The last five Soviet leaders (Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko and Mikhail Gorbachev) were all senior Secretaries before becoming First or General Secretaries. Additionally, Georgy Malenkov was briefly the leader of the Party for around a week after Stalin&#x27;s death by virtue of being the top member of the Secretariat.

The Central Committee established the Secretariat on 6 August 1917; it initially comprised Felix Dzerzhinsky, Matvei Muranov and Yakov Sverdlov as full members and Adolph Joffe and Elena Stasova as candidate members (or alternates). Following the October Revolution of November 1917, Sverdlov and Stasova in effect handled the work of the Secretariat as the other members of the body assumed other duties. At the time, the Secretariat was responsible for technical issues such as coordination of the activities of regional Party organizations and handling routine administrative affairs of the Party. Its staff increased from just 30 in 1919 to 600 in 1921 and to 767 by 1925.

By 1922, the body had transformed from a technical committee to become one of the most important components of the Party, and from that point on it was responsible for day-to-day operations of the Communist Party. Also in 1922, the position of General Secretary was created, the General Secretary became the head of the Secretariat and, in the years following Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924, became the most important figure in the Party and in the Soviet Union.

<text>Robert Baccalieri Jr., portrayed by Steve Schirripa, is a fictional character on the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. He is nicknamed &quot;Bobby Bacala&quot;. A third-generation gangster, Bobby is first shown as a soldier and then later top aide to Corrado &quot;Junior&quot; Soprano. Throughout the series, he rises through the ranks of the organized crime organization, becoming a captain, as well as Tony Soprano&#x27;s brother-in-law.

== Family background ==
Bobby Sr. fathered Bobby Jr. at 31 or 32 years old. In the episode &quot;Soprano Home Movies&quot;, Bobby states his grandfather had fled Italy to the United States due to political conflict during the Fascist regime, illegally entering through Montreal. In &quot;For All Debts Public and Private&quot;, Bobby mentions that in 2002 his mother is 69 and that following the September 11 attacks her mental health has gone downhill. It is implied that his parents are separated or divorced.

Bobby was the son of Bobby Baccalieri Sr., a highly respected mobster (whom Tony referred to as &quot;a real terminator&quot;), who fronted as a barber. Bobby&#x27;s father appeared in &quot;Another Toothpick&quot; played by Burt Young, suffering from lung cancer, who returned from retirement when Tony gave him the order to murder Salvatore &quot;Mustang Sally&quot; Intile, Bobby Sr.&#x27;s godson, in Staten Island. The hit was ordered as retribution for the savage unprovoked beating of Bryan Spatafore, brother of Vito Spatafore.

Bobby Sr. died after losing control of his car and crashing into a signpost while leaving the scene of the Mustang Sally hit, which Bobby found very distressing. Before joining Junior Soprano&#x27;s crew Bobby was a head waiter until at least 1986 and was trained by his father, Bobby Sr.

==Biography==
In &quot;Soprano Home Movies,&quot; when discussing Bobby Baccalieri after the fight, Tony Soprano thought he was 42 or 43, making him born in 1964 or 1965. Bobby, unlike many of his fellow wiseguys, was big-hearted and quite shy. He ran Junior Soprano&#x27;s old loan shark business. Although not officially a captain until much later, Bobby was a high-ranking soldier who ran Junior Soprano&#x27;s old crew and reported directly to Junior, and later to Tony. Before his death, it was thought he was preparing for the job of boss if Tony were to be killed or arrested.

At some point, Bobby became a made man, although without making his bones (committing murder). Bobby was married to Karen Baccalieri and lived in Verona, New Jersey until her death in a car crash. They had two children, Bobby III and Sophia.

Bobby was quite different from the other men in the Soprano crime family. Within the family he was quiet, almost shy, kind-hearted, and even-tempered. These traits made him well-liked if not necessarily respected. He was obese, which brought him much ridicule, but he was very loyal and even Tony apologized to him after making cracks about his weight.

In turn, Bobby was always respectful, and sometimes affectionate, towards Tony, telling him, &quot;I always liked you&quot;, in the aftermath of a feud that saw Tony order the deaths of several members of Junior Soprano&#x27;s crew that Bobby was in. He bore no lasting grudges against Paulie Gualtieri or Christopher Moltisanti, who carried out these hits, and appeared briefly looking delighted on the day Christopher was inducted.

Bobby operated Junior Soprano&#x27;s loan shark business in his stead and acted as Junior&#x27;s assistant while Junior was under house arrest on federal racketeering charges. Junior eventually rewarded him by putting Bobby in charge of his loan shark operation during the later part of his prosecution. Bobby was made capo when Junior had Murf Lupo step down in &quot;For All Debts Public and Private&quot;.

Bobby was very loyal to his wife, Karen, and (as revealed in &quot;Christopher&quot;) was the only made man in the Soprano crew without a comare. The only time he was ever seen with another woman other than his wife was in the episode &quot;University.&quot; When Ralphie walks back into the Bada Bing after beating Tracee to death, Bobby could be seen talking to another stripper. Bobby lost his wife in a car accident and took it especially hard, refusing to eat a tray of ziti she put in the freezer prior to her passing. Following Karen&#x27;s death, Janice Soprano, along with many other women, pursued Bobby, trying to help him out as much as possible, by cooking and watching over Bobby&#x27;s two children, but also trying to initiate a relationship with him.

When his grief continued, Janice went so far as to use the internet to expose his children to a Ouija board within their house. This frightened them and cleared a path for Janice to demonstrate that Bobby&#x27;s grief was affecting his children. Despite Bobby&#x27;s initial reluctance, the two were soon married and together had a daughter, Domenica. Bobby remained unaware of his wife&#x27;s machinations at the start of their relationship. Bobby also enjoyed playing with model trains.

Since 2001, when he assisted Tony in rescuing Christopher Moltisanti and Paulie Gualtieri from the Pine Barrens, Bobby grew closer to Tony. As Ralph Cifaretto put it, &quot;Dating the boss&#x27;s sister will help a made man&#x27;s career&quot;. Tony had recently stepped up his expectations of Bobby, who he felt was taking their newfound family relationship as an excuse not to earn at a competitive level, compared to other members of the family. Bobby rose to the occasion by supplementing his income with the $7,000 he received for using his skills as a marksman to non-fatally shoot a rapper he met at the hospital in the buttocks, while Tony was in the ICU, in order to raise the rapper&#x27;s profile.

In the episode &quot;The Ride&quot; Bobby&#x27;s wife, son, and youngest daughter were involved in a ride accident at the feast of St. Elzear, while he took his other daughter to the bathroom. Bobby&#x27;s initial reaction was relief that his family was unhurt. However, at a Sunday dinner at the Soprano residence, Janice berated Bobby for not standing up for them. She later accompanied him when he paid a visit to the ride&#x27;s owner.

Bobby stormed into his motel room, beat him up, and tried to extort money from him but learned that Paulie Gualtieri had been responsible for withholding the funds needed to repair the ride. Bobby tracked Paulie down at the festival and angrily confronted him. The two were separated by other associates in the crime family. At Christopher&#x27;s belated bachelor party, Bobby left soon after Paulie arrived. Tony ordered Paulie to make things right with Bobby. The episode demonstrated Bobby&#x27;s devotion to his family, but also confirmed his credentials as a man not to be crossed lightly, further cementing his position in the higher echelons of the family.

In the episode, &quot;Moe N&#x27; Joe&quot;, Bobby was beaten and robbed by a street gang as he was making his collections. One of the gang members fired a shot at the sidewalk near Bobby&#x27;s face and a concrete fragment injured his right eye. The injury left his sight in the eye uncertain and Carlo suspected that he might need a corneal transplantation. Despite the injury, Bobby made certain his payments reached Tony, by way of a concerned Carlo Gervasi, who visited Bobby at the hospital.

Bobby&#x27;s injury prompted Tony to reassess his relationship with his sister and brother-in-law. Tony&#x27;s feelings of guilt prompted him to broker an agreement with Johnny Sack that allowed Bobby and his family to buy Sack&#x27;s house at half price.

In the episode &quot;Soprano Home Movies&quot;, during a &quot;Monopoly&quot; game with Bobby, Carmela, and Janice, Tony began to make rude remarks toward Janice in reference to her promiscuous behavior as a younger woman, which Bobby took as a disrespectful affront. Unexpectedly, a usually meek and passive Bobby launched his fist into Tony&#x27;s face, knocking him to the floor. Bobby won the fight, battering the inebriated Tony quite severely but also injuring his boss&#x27;s pride. Tony, although reasonably gracious in defeat, was embarrassed at having been defeated in a brawl, especially by Bobby of all people. Tony frequently asserted to Bobby, Janice, and Carmela that he would have won the fight had he not slipped on the rug nor undergone such physical impotence after being shot by Uncle Junior.

As a partial result of this awkward incident, Bobby was tasked with going to Montreal to murder the brother-in-law of one of Tony&#x27;s Québécois associates, an important hit that formed part of a deal to save money on a pharmaceuticals racket. It was Bobby&#x27;s first murder. Tony mentioned earlier that Bobby had never &quot;popped his cherry&quot; with wetwork though Bobby was quite remorseful after committing the hit.

Bobby&#x27;s attitude was affected by Tony&#x27;s plan to promote him to Acting Boss. Tony wanted to bring Bobby up into the administration of the organization, because his earlier plan of positioning Christopher Moltisanti as his emissary and eventual heir had failed, following their personal falling out and eventually Chris&#x27;s death/murder. While Paulie Walnuts nominally held the title of Underboss, Bobby attended high-level meetings and sit-downs alongside Tony and Silvio Dante, identifying him as a high-ranking capo.

Even though Bobby was just a capo at the time, he was still consulted in strategy sessions, such as when Tony consulted Bobby about what to do about Phil Leotardo&#x27;s attempts to displace him as boss of the family. A few years earlier, Tony would have never brought Bobby into such a high-level discussion. Unlike Chris Moltisanti, Bobby neither took Tony&#x27;s trust for granted nor his new position lightly. Conscious of his rise from soldier to captain and then underboss, Bobby worked hard to keep Tony&#x27;s trust and respect, rather than simply coasting on his goodwill as Moltisanti had. His loyalty and work ethic did not go unnoticed or unappreciated by Tony.

Bobby&#x27;s rise and industriousness did not go unnoticed by the other families. When his name was brought up at a meeting of top New York associates and one of them (played by Dominic Chianese Jr.) mocked his rise by noting that he&#x27;d originally been Junior Soprano&#x27;s driver, Albie Cianflone defended Bobby, noting that almost all &quot;Mafiosi&quot; started doing work considered low-level or menial.

When war erupted between the New Jersey and New York families in the episode &quot;The Blue Comet&quot;, New York boss Phil Leotardo ordered the deaths of the DiMeo family&#x27;s top three &quot;guys&quot;: Bobby, Silvio, and Tony. FBI agent Dwight Harris informed Tony at Satriale&#x27;s that a snitch in Brooklyn had implied that Phil had ordered a major hit on the New Jersey crew. Tony then gave orders to inform everyone of the upcoming assassination plot.

Bobby left his cell phone behind as he entered a hobby shop, preventing him from receiving the warning call. While Bobby was looking at a vintage Blue Comet train set, two men entered the store and opened fire. Several gunshots sent Bobby&#x27;s bullet riddled body crashing on top of a model train display.

Later in the episode, when a saddened Tony reflects on Bobby&#x27;s death while holding the assault rifle that Bobby gave him on his birthday, Tony flashes back to the moment when he and Bobby were fishing, contemplating their own fates. Bobby observes that when getting killed, you &quot;probably don&#x27;t even hear it when it happens, right?&quot;. With Janice now a widow, she asks Uncle Junior for money, now living in state care. The approach fails as Junior&#x27;s advancing dementia has made him forget where his secret funds are hidden. Tony, although estranged from Junior, later visits his uncle and firmly tells him that if he does recall where his money is, the money will go straight to Bobby&#x27;s children, with Tony overseeing it.

==Character origins==
By chance, Steve Schirripa was in New York City in June 1999 for a friend&#x27;s wedding. Around that time he was invited for an audition in New York City, initially for Agent Skip Lipari, and later for the role of Baccalieri. He played Baccalieri for five seasons. For the first two seasons, he wore a fatsuit to fit the role, but this was later removed.

<text>In the 1892 Quebec general election on March 8, 1892, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Conservative Party, led by Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville, defeated the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Félix-Gabriel Marchand.

Mercier had been accused of corruption and removed from office as Premier by Quebec Lieutenant-governor Auguste-Réal Angers on December 16, 1891. The scandal probably influenced the outcome of the election. Mercier gave up the post of Liberal leader (and leader of the Opposition) to Félix-Gabriel Marchand, and was later acquitted of all charges.

Boucher de Boucherville resigned a year later, and was replaced by Louis-Olivier Taillon as Conservative leader and premier. Taillon in turn resigned in 1896, and was replaced by Edmund James Flynn. Flynn lost the 1897 election, and the Conservatives never held power in Quebec again.

The turnout was 59.97%.

<text>Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (HDEC; ) is a major construction company in South Korea. The company was founded by Chung Ju-yung in 1947 as the Hyundai Civil Works Company and was a major component of the Hyundai Group. Hyundai Construction and Hyundai Engineering merged in 1999.

Hyundai Construction played a major role in the importation of Korean laborers to the Middle East to work on construction projects in the 1970s and 1980s. In the decade following 1975, Hyundai signed their first contract in the region for construction of a shipyard for the Iranian Navy near Bandar-e Abbas. 800,000 Koreans went to work in Saudi Arabia and another 25,000 went to Iran; Hyundai was their largest employer.

Under creditors&#x27; management with Korea Exchange Bank as the largest creditor, Hyundai Group was split into several entities from 2001 to 2006. As of March 2007, HDEC is the main shareholder of Hyundai Merchant Marine, which is the de facto holding company of Hyundai Group. Hyundai Group and Hyundai Motor Group (another spin-off from Hyundai Group) are both vying to purchase HDEC.

In 2011, Hyundai Motor Group became the new owner of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction. This was determined by Korean banks&#x27; decision after the company won a bidding war against the Korean Merchant Marine.

<doc id="516498" wikidata="Q1720552" url="?curid=516498" title="Willie P. Mangum">
<text>Willie Person Mangum (; May 10, 1792September 7, 1861) was an American politician and planter who served as U.S. Senator from the state of North Carolina between 1831 and 1836 and between 1840 and 1853. He was one of the founders and leading members of the Whig party, and was a candidate for president in 1836 as part of the unsuccessful Whig strategy to defeat Martin Van Buren by running four candidates with local appeal in different regions of the country.

Most notably, Mangum served as President pro tempore of the Senate for most of John Tyler&#x27;s presidency, between 1842 and 1845. He was, therefore, first in the presidential line of succession during this time, as Tyler did not have a vice president. (There was no constitutional mechanism for filling an intra-term vice presidential vacancy at the time.) Had Tyler died, resigned or been removed from office at any time during his presidency, Mangum would have become acting president of the United States.

==Early life and education==
Mangum was born in Durham County, North Carolina (then part of Orange County), to a family from the planter class. He was the son of Catherine (Davis) and William Person Mangum. In his youth, he attended the respected private school in Raleigh run by John Chavis, a free black. They remained friends for years and had a long correspondence. He graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1815.

==Career==
Mangum began a law practice and entered politics. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1823 to 1826. After an interlude as a superior court judge, he was elected by the legislature as a Democrat to the Senate from North Carolina in 1830.

Mangum&#x27;s stay in the Democratic Party was short. He opposed President Andrew Jackson on most of the major issues of the day, including the protective tariff, nullification, and the Bank of the United States. In 1834, Mangum openly declared himself to be a &quot;Whig&quot;, and two years later, he resigned his Senate seat.

Due to a lack of organizational cohesion in the new Whig Party during the 1836 election, the Whigs put forward four presidential candidates: Daniel Webster in Massachusetts, William Henry Harrison in the remaining Northern and Border States, Hugh White in the middle and lower South, and Mangum in South Carolina. Some optimistic Whigs foresaw the nomination of several candidates resulting in denying a majority of electoral votes to any one candidate and throwing the election into the House of Representatives, much like what occurred in 1824, where Whig representatives could then coalesce around a single candidate. This possibility, however, did not come to fruition and Democratic candidate Martin Van Buren won the election with an outright majority of electoral votes. The legislature of South Carolina (which chose their electors until 1865) gave Mangum its 11 electoral votes.

After a four-year absence, Mangum served two more terms in the Senate, where he was an important ally of Henry Clay. In 1842, he succeeded Samuel L. Southard as president pro tempore of the Senate, during a vice presidential vacancy. Upon assuming office on May 23, he also became next in succession to the presidency, and remained so until the swearing in of George M. Dallas on March 4, 1845, a period which included President John Tyler&#x27;s narrow escape from death in the USS &quot;Princeton&quot; disaster of 1844. In 1852, he refused an offer to be a candidate for vice president on the Whig national ticket; fellow North Carolinian William Alexander Graham was nominated instead.

Realizing that he had little chance of being re-elected as the Whig Party broke up following the 1852 elections, Mangum retired in 1853 at the end of his second term. In 1856 he, like many ex-Whigs, joined the nativist American Party, but a stroke soon afterward ended his political career.

Mangum died at his family estate in Red Mountain, an unincorporated area of Durham County, on September 7, 1861. He was buried in the family cemetery on his estate. Mangum Elementary School in the area is named in his honor.

==Marriage and family==
Mangum married Charity Alston Cain of Pleasant Grove Plantation in 1819. They had five children. Their only son died in July 1861 at the First Battle of Bull Run, a month before his father.

His slave plantation was known as Walnut Hall. A 1931 biography of John Chavis noted that Mangum had allowed his former teacher to be buried on his land. The gravesite was found in 1988 by the John Chavis Historical Society, and is now marked as the &quot;Old Cemetery&quot; on maps of Hill Forest.

He was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons (1821–1823 and 1826) and was a judge of the superior court of North Carolina (1827–1836).

Strange was elected as a Jacksonian (later Democrat) to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Willie Person Mangum and served from December 5, 1836, to November 16, 1840, when he resigned and resumed the practice of law in Fayetteville, where he died on February 19, 1854, and was buried in the family burial ground at Myrtle Hill, near Fayetteville.

Strange was an ardent and active Freemason, serving as the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina, Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons from 1812 through 1814. He also served as Master of Phoenix Lodge No. 8, A. F. &amp; A. M., in Fayetteville, NC, for the year 1826.

Strange commanded the Fayetteville Independent Light Infantry (FILI), an independent militia company in Fayetteville, NC. In this role Strange served as the escort for the Marquis de Lafayette when he visited Fayetteville on March 5, 1825.

<doc id="516502" wikidata="Q12808082" url="?curid=516502" title="Raijin">
<text>, also known as , , , , and Kamowakeikazuchi-no-kami is a god of lightning, thunder, and storms in Japanese mythology and the Shinto and buddhism religion. He is typically depicted with fierce and aggressive facial expressions, standing atop a cloud, beating on den-den daiko drums with &quot;tomoe&quot; symbols drawn on them. Iconography of Raijin are often found in Japanese temples and shrines. He is usually depicted alongside Fūjin, the god of wind.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Raijin&quot; is derived from the Japanese words and .

== Description ==

Raijin is often depicted with a fierce, frightening face and a muscular figure with gravity-defying hair. He is surrounded by Taiko drums that he plays to create the sound of thunder. Raijin holds large hammers in his hands that he uses to play the drums. In some cases, Raijin is portrayed with three fingers which are said to represent the past, present and future. Two of the most notable sculptures of Raijin are located in the Sanjusangendo temple and the Taiyuin Rinnoji temple. 

Raijin and Fujin reside side by side in the Kaminarimon gate that guards the entrance to the Sanjusangendo temple. These sculptures are made of wood with lacquer, gold leaf and paint along with crystal, inlaid eyes. The Raijin and Fujin sculptures in Sanjusangendo are considered national treasures. 

In the Taiyuin Rinnoji temple, Raijin and Fujin are located in the Niten-mon gate. They are made of wood with paint and are seen with their token talismans, Raijin&#x27;s drums and Fujin&#x27;s wind bag. 

Raijin is also often seen in the company of his brother, Fujin, and his son, Raitaro. He is often seen fighting with Fujin, mending his drums, or causing mischief. He is also shown in the company of Raiju, a thunder-beast or thunder demon which also acts as his totem animal and usually a dog or wolf.

==Mythology==
=== Birth ===
In the myths recorded in the Kojiki, after Izanami died from the wounds inflicted on her by the birthing of Hinokagutsutchi, her husband Izanagi followed her down into Yomi no Kuni, the land of darkness. When he asked her to come with him, Izanami responded that she cannot leave, because she had already eaten from the food there. As Izanagi followed her all the way to Yomi, to try to fulfill his wish that she go with him, Izanami returned to her palace to negotiate with the residing kami. Izanami was gone for several hours, which made Izanagi worried for her. Thus, after making fire on the tip of his comb, he entered the palace. 

There, Izanagi found Izanami&#x27;s corpse. On her body maggots gathered, and on her head arose , on her chest , in her stomach , on her vagina , in her left hand , in her right hand , on her left leg and on her right leg ; collectively called .

Upon seeing Izanami&#x27;s twisted body, Izanagi fled from Yomi, shaken and in terror. In shame of allowing him to see her unsightly form, Izanami sent Raijin and several female demons to chase after Izanagi, after he fled the image of her rotting form, to bring him back to Yomi.

=== Capture of Raijin ===
Another story describes Raijin as a mischief-maker, causing the destruction leading the Emperor to order Sugaru (the God Catcher) to imprison Raijin and deliver him to the in order to stop a storm. Sugaru first petitioned Raijin in the name of the emperor to give himself over willingly and cease the storm, to which Raijin laughs at Sugaru. Sugaru then prays to Kannon, Kannon ordered Raijin to let Sugaru, then she later delivered Raijin to him. Sugaru then tied him up in a sack and took him to the Emperor. Under the control of Sugaru and the emperor, Raijin was forced to stop his destruction and bring only rain and bounty to Japan.

=== Defending Japan ===
In one legend, Raijin is shown to defend Japan against the invading Mongols. In this legend, the Mongols are driven off by a vicious storm in which Raijin is in the clouds throwing lightning and arrows at the invaders.

== Genealogy ==

Raijin has many siblings, most notably, Fujin (the god of wind), Kagutsuchi (the god of fire), Susanoo (the god of the sea and storms), Tsukuyomi (god of the moon), and Amaterasu (the goddess of the sun). Raijin also has a son named Raitaro.







== Modern role ==
Some Japanese parents tell their children to hide their belly buttons during thunderstorms so that Raijin does not take them away and eat them. 

Raijin also appears in the kabuki play &quot;Narukami&quot;, in which he is imprisoned under a pool of water, thus causing a drought.

<text>William Henry Haywood Jr. (October 23, 1801 – October 7, 1852) was a Democratic U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between 1843 and 1846.

Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, to a prominent family, Haywood attended the Raleigh Male Academy and graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1819. Haywood became the first clerk of the vestry of Raleigh&#x27;s Christ Church (Episcopal) in 1821. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1822 and commenced practice in Raleigh. He was a member of the North Carolina State House of Commons (1831 and 1834–1836), serving as speaker the last year. President Martin Van Buren appointed him Chargé d&#x27;Affaires to Belgium, but he declined the position.

A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1843, until July 25, 1846, when he refused to be instructed by the state legislature on a tariff question and resigned. At the time of his resignation, he was chairman of the Committee on Commerce and the Committee on the District of Columbia.

The North Carolina legislature elected Whig George Edmund Badger to replace Haywood in the Senate.

He resumed the practice of law in Raleigh, where he died on October 7, 1852, and was buried in the Old City Cemetery.
