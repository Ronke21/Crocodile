<text>Lists of mathematics topics cover a variety of topics related to mathematics. Some of these lists link to hundreds of articles; some link only to a few. The template to the right includes links to alphabetical lists of all mathematical articles. This article brings together the same content organized in a manner better suited for browsing.
Lists cover aspects of basic and advanced mathematics, methodology, mathematical statements, integrals, general concepts, mathematical objects, and reference tables.
They also cover equations named after people, societies, mathematicians, journals, and meta-lists.

The purpose of this list is &quot;not&quot; similar to that of the Mathematics Subject Classification formulated by the American Mathematical Society. Many mathematics journals ask authors of research papers and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The subject codes so listed are used by the two major reviewing databases, &quot;Mathematical Reviews&quot; and &quot;Zentralblatt MATH&quot;. This list has some items that would not fit in such a classification, such as list of exponential topics and list of factorial and binomial topics, which may surprise the reader with the diversity of their coverage.

===Pure mathematics===
====Algebra====
Algebra includes the study of algebraic structures, which are sets and operations defined on these sets satisfying certain axioms. The field of algebra is further divided according to which structure is studied; for instance, group theory concerns an algebraic structure called &quot;group&quot;.

====Combinatorics====
Combinatorics concerns the study of discrete (and usually finite) objects. Aspects include &quot;counting&quot; the objects satisfying certain criteria (&quot;enumerative combinatorics&quot;), deciding when the criteria can be met, and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria (as in &quot;combinatorial designs and matroid theory&quot;), finding &quot;largest&quot;, &quot;smallest&quot;, or &quot;optimal&quot; objects (&quot;extremal combinatorics&quot; and &quot;combinatorial optimization&quot;), and finding algebraic structures these objects may have (&quot;algebraic combinatorics&quot;).
* Outline of combinatorics
* Glossary of graph theory

====Number theory====
The branch of mathematics deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, especially positive integers.
Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss said, &quot;Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics.&quot;
Number theory also studies the natural, or whole, numbers. One of the central concepts in number theory is that of the prime number, and there are many questions about primes that appear simple but whose resolution continues to elude mathematicians.

===Applied mathematics===

====Dynamical systems and differential equations====

A differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function and its derivatives.

In a dynamical system, a fixed rule describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space. The mathematical models used to describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, or the number of fish each spring in a lake are examples of dynamical systems.
* List of dynamical systems and differential equations topics

Signal processing is the analysis, interpretation, and manipulation of signals. Signals of interest include sound, images, biological signals such as ECG, radar signals, and many others. Processing of such signals includes filtering, storage and reconstruction, separation of information from noise, compression, and feature extraction.
* List of algebraic coding theory topics

====Probability and statistics====
Probability theory is the formalization and study of the mathematics of uncertain events or knowledge. The related field of mathematical statistics develops statistical theory with mathematics. Statistics, the science concerned with collecting and analyzing data, is an autonomous discipline (and not a subdiscipline of applied mathematics).

<doc id="527385" wikidata="Q3111510" url="?curid=527385" title="National Education Association">
<text>The National Education Association (NEA) is the largest labor union in the United States. It represents public school teachers and other support personnel, faculty and staffers at colleges and universities, retired educators, and college students preparing to become teachers. The NEA has just under 3 million members and is headquartered in Washington, D.C. The NEA had a budget of more than $341 million for the 2012–2013 fiscal year. Becky Pringle is the NEA&#x27;s current president.

During the early 20th century, the National Education Association was among the leading progressive advocates of establishing a United States Department of Education.

Driven by pressure from teacher organizing, by the 1970s the NEA transformed from an education advocacy organization to a rank-and-file union. In the decades since, the association has continued to represent organized teachers and other school workers in collective bargaining and to lobby for progressive education policy. The NEA&#x27;s political agenda frequently brings it into conflict with conservative interest groups. State affiliates of the NEA regularly lobby state legislators for funding, seek to influence education policy, and file legal actions.

At the national level, the NEA lobbies the United States Congress and federal agencies and is active in the nominating process for Democratic candidates. From 1989 through the 2014 election cycle, the NEA spent over $92 million on political campaign contributions, 97% of which went to Democrats.

==History==
===Founding===
The NEA was founded in Philadelphia in 1857 as the National Teachers Association (NTA). Zalmon Richards was elected the NTA&#x27;s first president and presided over the organization&#x27;s first annual meeting in 1858. At the beginning and for its first century of history, it had the character of a professional association rather than a labor union. The NTA became the National Education Association (NEA) in 1870 when it merged with the American Normal School Association, the National Association of School Superintendents, and the Central College Association. The union was chartered by Congress in 1906.

The NEA was never on good terms with the New Deal. Its main goal was for Congress to pass a multipurpose public finance bill that would supplement local property taxes in funding public schools. Some relief money was used to build schools, but the New Deal avoided channeling any of it through the Office of Education. Legislation never succeeded, because it would condone segregated schools in the South and because President Franklin D. Roosevelt rejected any across-the-board program. He believed that federal money should only go to the poorest schools, and none to rich states. The New Deal set up its own separate educational program through the Civilian Conservation Corps and other relief agencies.

===From association to labor union===
For most of the 20th century, the NEA was dominated by the public school administration in small towns and rural areas. The state organizations played a major role in policy formation for the NEA. Only a small portion of American public school teachers were unionized before the 1960s. That began to change in 1959, when Wisconsin became the first state to pass a collective bargaining law for public employees. Over the next 20 years, most other states adopted similar laws.

The NEA merged with the American Teachers Association, the historically Black teachers association founded as the National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools, in 1966. The NEA&#x27;s merger with the ATA, its transformation into a true labor union, and other factors were to greatly change the organization&#x27;s demographics. In 1967, the NEA elected its first Hispanic president, Braulio Alonso. In 1968, NEA elected its first black president, Elizabeth Duncan Koontz.

After 1957, the NEA began a process that would transform it into an organization representing the teachers in its districts, rather than just the administrators. It came to resemble the rival American Federation of Teachers (AFT), which was a labor union for teachers in larger cities. The success of the AFT in raising wages through strike activity encouraged the NEA to undertake similar activities. The years between 1957 and 1973 saw a gradual shift in power to the association&#x27;s classroom teachers, a tentative embrace of collective bargaining and teacher strikes, and the creation of a political action committee. These changes culminated in a new constitution adopted in 1973. The constitution expelled school administrators entirely and made structural changes to allow the NEA to operate as a labor union.

In the 1970s, more militant politics came to characterize the NEA. Its political action committee engaged in local election campaigns, and the union began endorsing political candidates who supported its policy goals. State NEA branches became less important as the national and local levels began direct and unmediated relationships. The NEA&#x27;s elected leadership often supported teachers in opposition to school administrators.

===Relations with the American Federation of Teachers===
In 1998, a tentative merger agreement was reached between NEA and American Federation of Teachers (AFT) negotiators, but ratification failed soundly in the NEA&#x27;s Representative Assembly meeting in New Orleans in early July 1998. However, five NEA state affiliates have since merged with their AFT counterparts. Mergers occurred in Florida (the Florida Education Association formed in 2000); Minnesota (Education Minnesota formed in 1998), Montana (MEA-MFT formed in 2000), New York (New York State United Teachers formed in 2006) and North Dakota (North Dakota United formed in 2013).

In 2006, the NEA and the AFL–CIO also announced that, for the first time, stand-alone NEA locals as well as those that had merged with the AFT would be allowed to join state and local labor federations affiliated with the AFL-CIO.

===2024 NEASO Lockout===

The National Education Association Staff Organization (NEASO) is the staff union representing employees who work for the NEA. In July 2024, NEASO staff members went on a three-day strike protesting what it charged were NEA&#x27;s unfair labor practices. This resulted in the halting of the National Education Association&#x27;s (NEA) annual representative assembly in Philadelphia. The event, which was scheduled to run for four days over the Fourth of July weekend, brings together thousands of educators to vote on the union&#x27;s priorities, budget, and strategic plan. President Joe Biden, who was expected to address the delegates, canceled his appearance, citing his refusal to cross the picket line.

Following the strike, the NEA locked out nearly 300 staff members working at its headquarters in Washington, D.C. These staff members will not be paid or allowed to work until a new contract is reached.

==Composition==
According to NEA&#x27;s Department of Labor records since 2005, when membership classifications were first reported, the majority of the union&#x27;s membership are &quot;active professional&quot; members, having fallen only slightly from 74% to the current 71%. The second largest category have been &quot;active education support professional&quot; members, with about 15%. The third largest category are &quot;retired&quot; members, which have grown from 8% to 10%. Two other categories, &quot;active life&quot; and &quot;student&quot; members, have both remained with around 2%, falling slightly. These categories are eligible to vote in the union, though the union lists some comparatively marginal categories which are not eligible to vote: &quot;staff&quot;, &quot;substitute&quot; and &quot;reserve&quot; members, each with less than 1% of the union&#x27;s membership. NEA contracts also cover some non-members, known as agency fee payers, which since 2006 have numbered comparatively about 3% of the size of the union&#x27;s membership.

As of 2014 these categories account for about: 2.1 million &quot;active professionals&quot;, 457,000 &quot;active education support professionals&quot;, 300,000 &quot;retirees&quot;, 52,000 &quot;students&quot;, 42,000 &quot;active life&quot; members, and just under nine thousand others, plus about 90,000 non-members paying agency fees.

===Membership trends===
The NEA reported a membership of 766,000 in 1961. In 2007, at the 150th anniversary of its founding, NEA membership had grown to 3.2 million. However, by July 2012, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that NEA had lost nearly 0.3% of their members each year since 2010.

Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s 2018 Janus v. AFSCME case, which ended the compulsion of non-union, public employees to pay agency fees, or what are colloquially known as &#x27;fair-share fees,&#x27; the NEA&#x27;s total membership and agency fee payers dropped from 3,074,841 on its November 28, 2017, report to 2,975,933 in its August 31, 2019, report, a total loss of 98,908 dues payers.

==Structure and governance==
The NEA has a membership of just under 3 million people, with membership levels dropping every year since 2010. The NEA is incorporated as a professional association in a few states and as a Trade union in most. The group holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code. It is not a member of the AFL–CIO, but is part of Education International, the global federation of teachers&#x27; unions.

NEA members set the union&#x27;s policies through the Representative Assembly (RA). The RA, which is a delegation comprising elected representatives from each local and state affiliate, coalitions of student members and retired members, and other segments of the united education profession—is the primary legislative and policy-making body of the NEA. RA delegates elect the union&#x27;s executive officers and members of the Executive Committee.

, the executive officers of the NEA are Rebecca Pringle (President), Princess Moss (Vice President), Noel Candelaria (Secretary-Treasurer) and Kim A. Anderson (Executive Director). These posts are elected by the Representative Assembly.

The board of directors and executive committee are responsible for the general policies and interests of the NEA. The board of directors consists of one director from each state affiliate (plus an additional director for every 20,000 active members in the state), six directors for the retired members, and three directors for the student members. The board also includes at-large representatives of ethnic minorities, administrators, classroom teachers in higher education, and active members employed in educational support positions. The Executive Committee consists of the President, Vice President, and Secretary-Treasurer plus six members elected at large by delegates to the Representative Assembly. It acts for the board of directors when it is not in session.

==Funding==
Most NEA funding comes from dues paid by its members ($295 million in dues from a $341 million total budget in 2005). Typically, local chapters negotiate a contract with automatic deduction of dues from members&#x27; paychecks. Part of the dues remain with the local affiliate (the district association), a portion goes to the state association, and a portion is given to the national association. The NEA returned 39 percent of dues money back to state affiliates in 2021 and 2022.

Federal law prohibits unions from using dues money or other assets to contribute to or otherwise assist federal candidates or political parties, in accordance with their tax-exempt status. The NEA Fund for Children and Public Education is a special fund for voluntary contributions from NEA members which can legally be used to assist candidates and political parties. Critics have repeatedly questioned the NEA&#x27;s actual compliance with such laws, and a number of legal actions focusing on the union&#x27;s use of money and union personnel in partisan contexts have ensued.

==Read Across America Day==

National Read Across America Day is an NEA initiative to encourage reading. It has expanded into a year-long program with special celebrations in March as National Reading Month. Read Across America Day began in 1998, on March 2 which was the birthday of the popular children&#x27;s author, Dr. Seuss. The NEA partnered with Dr. Seuss Enterprises on the venture from 1997 to 2018, when the contract ended. Since 2017, NEA&#x27;s Read Across America focuses on the importance, value, and fun of reading and sharing diverse books and &quot;celebrating a nation of diverse readers&quot;.
==Political activities==

NEA has played a role in politics since its founding, as it has sought to influence state and federal laws that would affect public education. The extent to which the NEA and its state and local affiliates engage in political activities, especially during election cycles, has been a source of controversy. The organization tracks legislation related to education and the teaching profession and encourages members to get involved in politics.

* 1910–1915: Women played increasing leadership roles in NEA.
* 1912: The NEA endorsed women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States
*1918: The report &quot;Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education&quot; emphasized the education of students in terms of health, a command of fundamental processes, worthy home membership, vocation, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical character. They emphasized life adjustment and reflected the social efficiency model of progressive education.
* 1918: The NEA Commission on the Emergency in Education, with George Strayer as chairman, warned that the evidence from the wartime draft showed millions of potential soldiers were illiterate or poorly educated, and often in bad health. The NEA study said the cause was very low quality rural schools in the South, badly trained teachers, and inequitable financing. It called for $100 million of federal aid to remedy the deficiencies, but none was forthcoming. Many states, however, started setting minimal standards for rural schools.
* 1920: The &quot;Preliminary Report on the Tenure of Teachers&quot; cautiously recommended that school boards adopt a policy of academic tenure.
* 1923: The NEA began to promote state pension plans for teachers; by 1950, every state had a pension plan in effect.
* 1923–1928: Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Committee of One Hundred on the Problem of Tenure&quot; stressed the advantages of tenure for society. In 1925, it argued that tenure &quot;protects the great body of good teachers from political attack and from dismissal for petty personal and political reasons&quot;, but also argued that administrators should maintain control over dismissal decisions.
* 1920s: The main NEA goals during this period were to raise teacher salaries, raise standards, and to gain a cabinet-level U.S. Secretary of Education. Success on the cabinet issue came only in 1979.
* 1930s: The NEA lobbied, mostly unsuccessfully, for Congress to pass a multipurpose public finance bill that would supplement local property taxes in funding public schools. Some relief money was used to build schools, but the New Deal avoided channeling any of it through the Office of Education. Legislation never succeeded, because it would condone segregated schools in the South and because Roosevelt rejected any across-the-board program. He believed that federal money should only go to the poorest schools, and none to rich states. The New Deal set up its own separate educational program through the Civilian Conservation Corps and other relief agencies.
* 1940s: The NEA successfully lobbied Congress for special funding for public schools near military bases.
* 1944: The NEA lobbied for the G.I. Bill, a law that provided a range of benefits for returning World War II veterans.
* 1958: The NEA helped gain passage of the National Defense Education Act.
* 1964: The NEA lobbied to pass the Civil Rights Act
* 1965: The NEA worked with Catholic school leaders to pass the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for federal aid to schools.
* 1968: After years of feuding, the AFT suggested a merger with the NEA. The NEA refuses.
* 1968: The NEA lobbied for passage of the Bilingual Education Act, with federal funding for Spanish-language education in public schools.
* 1968-68: There was a wave of school strikes outside South, 80% by the NEA.
* 1969: 450,000 teachers were covered by 1,019 collective bargaining agreements. The NEA accounted for 90 percent of the contracts and 61 percent of the teachers.
* 1972: The New York State Teachers Association quit the NEA and merged with the AFT.
* 1970s: State affiliates become powerful lobbyists.
* 1976: 265 NEA delegates attended the Democratic National Convention; the NEA endorsed Democrat Jimmy Carter for president. He won and secured the creation of the Department of Education in 1979.
* 1980: 464 NEA delegates attended the Democratic National Convention.
* 1984: The NEA lobbied for passage of a federal retirement equity law to provide the means to end sex discrimination against women in retirement funds.

* 2013: the NEA wrote an open letter to the United States House of Representatives opposing the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 (H.J.Res 59; 113th Congress). The NEA urged representatives to vote no because the bill &quot;continues the devastating cuts to education set in motion by the sequester and permanently defunds the Affordable Care Act.&quot; 
*2020: Together with the American Federation of Teachers, NEA issued a report expressing opposition to active shooter drills being held in schools, calling on the drills to be revised or eliminated.

===Other policy positions===
The NEA has taken positions on policy issues including:
* Reforming the No Child Left Behind Act to reduce the focus on standardized testing
* Increasing education funding
* A minimum $40,000 starting annual salary for all teachers
* Mandate high school graduation or equivalency as compulsory for everyone below the age of 21
* Lowering the achievement gap
* Reforming Social Security Offsets (GPO/WEP)
* Discouraging school vouchers and all forms of competition with public schools
* Reforming laws governing charter schools

The NEA is a member of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition.

===Electoral politics===
In recent decades the NEA has increased its visibility in party politics, contributing funds and other assistance to political campaigns. Like other American labor unions, the NEA has favored the Democratic Party, giving its endorsement and support to every Democratic nominee for President since Jimmy Carter. It has never endorsed any Republican or third party candidate for the presidency.

Based on required filings with the federal government, it is estimated that between 1990 and 2002, eighty percent of the NEA&#x27;s substantial political contributions went to Democratic Party candidates. Ninety-five percent of contributions went to Democrats in 2012. the NEA maintains that it bases support for candidates primarily on the organization&#x27;s interpretation of candidates&#x27; support for public education and educators. Every presidential candidate endorsed by the NEA must be recommended by the NEA&#x27;s PAC Council (composed of representatives from every state and caucus) and approved by the Board of Directors by a 58 percent majority. In October 2015, the NEA endorsed Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 presidential bid. Clinton accepted the endorsement in person.

==Criticism==
Some critics have alleged the NEA puts the interests of teachers ahead of students. The NEA has often opposed measures such as merit pay, school vouchers, weakening of teacher tenure, certain curricular changes, the No Child Left Behind Act, and other reforms that make it easier for school districts to use disciplinary action against teachers. In July 2019, the NEA voted down a resolution that would have &quot;re-dedicate[d] itself to the pursuit of increased student learning in every public school in America by putting a renewed emphasis on quality education&quot;.

With the modern scrutiny placed on teacher misconduct, particularly regarding sexual abuse, the NEA has been criticized for its alleged failure to crack down on abusive teachers. From an Associated Press investigation, former NEA President Reg Weaver commented, &quot;Students must be protected from sexual predators and abuse, and teachers must be protected from false accusations&quot;. He then refused to be interviewed. The Associated Press reported that much of the resistance to report the problem comes from &quot;where fellow teachers look away&quot;, and &quot;school administrators make behind-the-scenes deals&quot;.

Inclusion of the &quot;NEA Ex-Gay Caucus&quot; at a convention in 2006 sparked controversy. Some critics believe the NEA promotes a gay rights agenda, especially since the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 2005 case &quot;Fields v. Palmdale School District&quot;. The case originated when some California elementary school students were administered a school survey containing sexual questions. Parents, who had not been told the survey would contain questions of a sexual nature, brought the case forward. The court in that case initially ruled that parents&#x27; fundamental right to control the upbringing of their children &quot;does not extend beyond the threshold of the school door&quot;, which upon petition for rehearing was struck and clarified to &quot;does not entitle individual parents to enjoin school boards from providing information the boards determine to be appropriate in connection with the performance of their educational functions&quot;, and that a public school has the right to provide its students with &quot;whatever information it wishes to provide, sexual or otherwise&quot;. NEA states that it does not &quot;encourage schools to teach students to become gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered (LGBT)&quot;, but the NEA does believe that &quot;schools should be safe for all students and advocates that schools should raise awareness of homophobia and intervene when LGBT students are harassed&quot;.

A leading critic of NEA from the left is Dr. Rich Gibson, whose article on the NEA–AFT merger convention outlines a critique of unionism itself.

<doc id="527390" wikidata="Q11059886" url="?curid=527390" title="Hilbert's eighth problem">
<text>Hilbert&#x27;s eighth problem is one of David Hilbert&#x27;s list of open mathematical problems posed in 1900. It concerns number theory, and in particular the Riemann hypothesis, although it is also concerned with the Goldbach conjecture. It asks for more work on the distribution of primes and generalizations of Riemann hypothesis to other rings where prime ideals take the place of primes.

==Riemann hypothesis and generalizations==
Hilbert calls for a solution to the Riemann hypothesis, which has long been regarded as the deepest open problem in mathematics. Given the solution, he calls for more thorough investigation into Riemann&#x27;s zeta function and the prime number theorem.

==Goldbach conjecture==
Hilbert calls for a solution to the Goldbach conjecture, as well as more general problems, such as finding infinitely many pairs of primes solving a fixed linear diophantine equation.

==Generalized Riemann conjecture==
Finally, Hilbert calls for mathematicians to generalize the ideas of the Riemann hypothesis to counting prime ideals in a number field.

<text>A Trip to the Moon ( ) is a 1902 French science-fiction adventure trick film written, directed, and produced by Georges Méliès. Inspired by the Jules Verne novel &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; (1865) and its sequel &quot;Around the Moon&quot; (1870), the film follows a group of astronomers who travel to the Moon in a cannon-propelled capsule, explore the Moon&#x27;s surface, escape from an underground group of Selenites (lunar inhabitants), and return to Earth with a captive Selenite. Méliès leads an ensemble cast of French theatrical performers as the main character Professor Barbenfouillis.

Although the film disappeared into obscurity after Méliès&#x27;s retirement from the film industry, it was rediscovered around 1930, when Méliès&#x27;s importance to the history of cinema was beginning to be recognised by film devotees. An original hand-colored print was discovered in 1993 and restored in 2011.

&quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; was ranked 84th among the 100 greatest films of the 20th century by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. The film remains Méliès&#x27; best-known, and the moment when the capsule lands in the moon&#x27;s eye remains one of the most iconic and frequently referenced images in the history of cinema.

== Plot ==

At a meeting of the Astronomy Club, its president, Professor Barbenfouillis, proposes an expedition to the Moon. After addressing some dissent, five other brave astronomers—Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus—agree to the plan. A space capsule in the shape of a bullet is built, along with a huge cannon to shoot it into space. The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of &quot;marines&quot;, most of whom are played by young women in sailors&#x27; outfits. The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches, and, in an iconic shot, it hits him in the eye.

Landing safely on the Moon, the astronomers get out of the capsule (without the need of space suits or breathing apparatus) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.

At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien inhabitant of the Moon, named after one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear, and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.

The astronomers run back to their capsule while continuing to hit the pursuing Selenites, and five get inside. The sixth astronomer, Barbenfouillis himself, uses a rope to tip the capsule over a ledge on the Moon and into space. A Selenite tries to seize the capsule at the last minute. Astronomer, capsule, and Selenite fall through space and land in an ocean on Earth, where they are rescued by a ship and towed ashore. The final sequence (missing from some prints of the film) depicts a celebratory parade in honour of the travellers&#x27; return, including a display of the captive Selenite and the unveiling of a commemorative statue bearing the motto &quot;Labor omnia vincit&quot;.

== Cast ==

When &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; was made, film actors performed anonymously and no credits were given; the practice of supplying opening and closing credits in films was a later innovation. The following cast details can be reconstructed from available evidence:
* Georges Méliès as Professor Barbenfouillis and The Moon. Méliès, a pioneering French film-maker and magician now generally regarded as one of the first people to recognise the potential of narrative film, had already achieved considerable success with his film versions of &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1899) and &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1900). His extensive involvement in all of his films as director, producer, writer, designer, technician, publicist, editor, and often actor makes him one of the first cinematic &quot;auteurs&quot;. Speaking about his work late in life, Méliès commented: &quot;The greatest difficulty in realising my own ideas forced me to sometimes play the leading role in my films ... I was a star without knowing I was one, since the term did not yet exist.&quot; All told, Méliès took an acting role in at least 300 of his 520 films.
* Bleuette Bernon as Phoebe (the woman on the crescent moon). Méliès discovered Bernon in the 1890s, when she was performing as a singer at the cabaret L&#x27;Enfer. She also appeared in his 1899 adaption of &quot;Cinderella&quot;.
* François Lallement as the officer of the marines. Lallement was one of the salaried camera operators for the Star Film Company.
* Henri Delannoy as the captain of the rocket.
* Jules-Eugène Legris as the parade leader. Legris was a magician who performed at Méliès&#x27;s theatre of stage illusions, the Théâtre Robert-Houdin in Paris.
* Victor André, Delpierre, Farjaux, Kelm, and Brunnet as the astronomers. André worked at the Théâtre de Cluny; the others were singers in French music halls.
* Ballet of the Théâtre du Châtelet as stars and as cannon attendants.
* Acrobats of the Folies Bergère as Selenites.

== Production ==

=== Inspiration ===

When asked in 1930 what inspired him for &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;, Méliès credited Jules Verne&#x27;s novels &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; (1865) and &quot;Around the Moon&quot; (1870). Cinema historians, the mid-20th-century French writer Georges Sadoul first among them, have frequently suggested H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot; (1901), a French translation of which was published a few months before Méliès made the film, as another likely influence. Sadoul argued that the first half of the film (up to the shooting of the projectile) is derived from Verne and that the second half, the travellers&#x27; adventures on and in the Moon, is derived from Wells.

In addition to these literary sources, various film scholars have suggested that Méliès was heavily influenced by other works, especially Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s opera-féerie &quot;Le voyage dans la lune&quot; (an unauthorised parody of Verne&#x27;s novels) and the &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; attraction at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. The French film historian Thierry Lefebvre hypothesises that Méliès drew upon both of these works, but in different ways: he appears to have taken the structure of the film—&quot;a trip to the Moon, a Moon landing, an encounter with extraterrestrials with a deformity, an underground trek, an interview with the Man in the Moon, and a brutal return to reality back on Earth&quot;—directly from the 1901 attraction, but also incorporated many plot elements (including the presence of six astronomers with pseudo-scientific names, telescopes that transform into stools, a moonshot cannon mounted above ground, a scene in which the Moon appears to approach the viewer, a lunar snowstorm, an earthrise scene, and umbrella-wielding travellers), not to mention the parodic tone of the film, from the Offenbach opera-féerie.

=== Filming ===

As the science writer Ron Miller notes, &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; was one of the most complex films that Méliès had made, and employed &quot;every trick he had learned or invented&quot;. It was his longest film yet; both the budget and filming duration were unusually lavish, costing 10,000 to make and taking three months to complete. The camera operators were Théophile Michault and Lucien Tainguy, who worked on a daily basis with Méliès as salaried employees for the Star Film Company. In addition to their work as cameramen, Méliès&#x27;s operators also did odd jobs for the company such as developing film and helping to set up scenery, and another salaried operator, François Lallement, appeared onscreen as the marine officer. By contrast, Méliès hired his actors on a film-by-film basis, drawing from talented individuals in the Parisian theatrical world, with which he had many connections. They were paid one Louis d&#x27;or per day, a considerably higher salary than that offered by competitors, and had a full free meal at noon with Méliès.

Méliès&#x27;s film studio, which he had built in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in 1897, was a greenhouse-like building with glass walls and a glass ceiling to let in as much sunlight as possible, a concept used by most still photography studios from the 1860s onward; it was built with the same dimensions as Méliès&#x27;s own Théâtre Robert-Houdin (13.5 × 6.6 m). Throughout his film career, Méliès worked on a strict schedule of planning films in the morning, filming scenes during the brightest hours of the day, tending to the film laboratory and the Théâtre Robert-Houdin in the late afternoon, and attending performances at Parisian theatres in the evening.

According to Méliès&#x27;s recollections, much of the unusual cost of &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; was due to the mechanically operated scenery and the Selenite costumes in particular, which were made for the film using cardboard and canvas. Méliès himself sculpted prototypes for the heads, feet, and kneecap pieces in terracotta, and then created plaster moulds for them. A mask-making specialist, probably from the major Parisian mask- and box-making firm of the Maison Hallé, used these moulds to produce cardboard versions for the actors to wear. Though other details about the film&#x27;s making are scarce, the film historian Georges Sadoul argued that Méliès most likely collaborated with the painter Claudel on the scenery, and with Jehanne d&#x27;Alcy on the costumes. One of the backdrops for the film, showing the inside of the glass-roofed workshop in which the space capsule is built, was painted to look like the actual glass-roofed studio in which the film was made.

Many of the special effects in &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;, as in numerous other Méliès films, were created using the substitution splice technique, in which the camera operator stopped filming long enough for something onscreen to be altered, added, or taken away. Méliès carefully spliced the resulting shots together to create apparently magical effects, such as the transformation of the astronomers&#x27; telescopes into stools or the disappearance of the exploding Selenites in puffs of smoke. Other effects were created using theatrical means, such as stage machinery and pyrotechnics. The film also features transitional dissolves.

The pseudo-tracking shot in which the camera appears to approach the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film &quot;The Man with the Rubber Head&quot;. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control the placement of the face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear in the eye of the actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the capsule from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.

=== Coloring ===
Color prints were produced for a small percent of Méliès&#x27;s films and advertised alongside the black-and-white versions at a higher price. From approximately 1897 to 1912, these prints (for films such as &quot;The Kingdom of the Fairies&quot;, &quot;The Impossible Voyage&quot;, &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, and &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;) were hand-colored by Élisabeth and Berthe Thuillier&#x27;s coloring lab in Paris. The Thuilliers led a studio of two hundred women, painting directly on film stock with brushes in carefully chosen colors. Each worker was assigned a specific color to apply to a frame of film in assembly line style, with more than twenty colors sometimes used for a single film. On average, the Thuilliers&#x27; lab produced about sixty hand-colored copies of a film.

=== Music ===
Although Méliès&#x27;s films were silent, they were not intended to be seen silently; exhibitors often used a &quot;bonimenteur&quot;, or narrator, to explain the story as it unfolded on the screen, accompanied by sound effects and live music. Méliès himself took considerable interest in musical accompaniment for his films, and prepared special film scores for several of them, including &quot;The Kingdom of the Fairies&quot; and &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;. He did not require specific music for any film, allowing exhibitors freedom to choose whatever accompaniment they felt most suitable. When the film was screened at the Olympia music hall in Paris in 1902, an original film score was reportedly written for it.

In 1903, the English composer Ezra Read published a piano piece called &quot;A Trip to the Moon: Comic Descriptive Fantasia&quot;, which follows Méliès&#x27;s film scene by scene and may have been used as a score for the film; it may have been commissioned by Méliès himself, who had likely met Read on one of his trips to England. More recent composers who have recorded scores for &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; include Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoit Dunckel of Air (for the 2011 restoration; see the Hand-colored version section below), Frederick Hodges, Robert Israel, Eric Le Guen, Lawrence Lehérissey (a great-great-grandson of Méliès), Jeff Mills, Donald Sosin, and Victor Young (for an abridged print featured as a prologue to the 1956 film &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;).

== Style ==

The film&#x27;s style, like that of most of Méliès&#x27;s other films, is deliberately theatrical. The stage set is highly stylised, recalling the traditions of the 19th-century stage, and is filmed by a stationary camera, placed to evoke the perspective of an audience member sitting in a theatre. This stylistic choice was one of Méliès&#x27;s first and biggest innovations.

Although he had initially followed the popular trend of the time by making mainly actuality films (short &quot;slice of life&quot; documentary films capturing actual scenes and events for the camera), in his first few years of filming Méliès gradually moved into the far less common genre of fictional narrative films, which he called his &quot;scènes composées&quot; or &quot;artificially arranged scenes&quot;. The new genre was extensively influenced by Méliès&#x27;s experience in theatre and magic, especially his familiarity with the popular French &quot;féerie&quot; stage tradition, known for their fantasy plots and spectacular visuals, including lavish scenery and mechanically worked stage effects. In an advertisement he proudly described the difference between his innovative films and the actualities still being made by his contemporaries: &quot;these fantastic and artistic films reproduce stage scenes and create a new genre entirely different from the ordinary cinematographic views of real people and real streets.&quot;

Because &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; preceded the development of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith, it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such as varied camera angles, intercutting, juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas. Rather, each camera setup in Méliès&#x27;s film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed.

Similarly, film scholars have noted that the most famous moment in &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice: first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing in the eye of an anthropomorphic moon; then, in a much closer shot, the landing occurs very differently, and much more realistically, with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain. This kind of nonlinear storytelling—in which time and space are treated as repeatable and flexible rather than linear and causal—is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers, before the development of continuity editing. Other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time. (Porter, for instance, used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film &quot;Life of an American Fireman&quot;.) Later in the 20th century, with sports television&#x27;s development of the instant replay, temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences.

Because Méliès does not use a modern cinematic vocabulary, some film scholars have created other frameworks of thought with which to assess his films. For example, some recent academicians, while not necessarily denying Méliès&#x27;s influence on film, have argued that his works are better understood as spectacular theatrical creations rooted in the 19th-century stage tradition of the &quot;féerie&quot;.

Similarly, Tom Gunning has argued that to fault Méliès for not inventing a more intimate and cinematic storytelling style is to misunderstand the purpose of his films; in Gunning&#x27;s view, the first decade of film history may be considered a &quot;cinema of attractions,&quot; in which filmmakers experimented with a presentational style based on spectacle and direct address rather than on intricate editing. Though the attraction style of filmmaking declined in popularity in favour of a more integrated &quot;story film&quot; approach, it remains an important component of certain types of cinema, including science fiction films, musicals, and avant-garde films.

== Themes ==

With its pioneering use of themes of scientific ambition and discovery, &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; is sometimes described as the first science fiction film. &quot;A Short History of Film&quot; argues that it codified &quot;many of the basic generic situations that are still used in science fiction films today&quot;. Other genre designations are possible; Méliès advertised the film as a &quot;pièce à grand spectacle&quot;, a term referring to a type of spectacular Parisian stage extravaganza popularised by Jules Verne and Adolphe d&#x27;Ennery in the second half of the 19th century. Richard Abel describes the film as belonging to the &quot;féerie&quot; genre, as does Frank Kessler. It can also be described simply as a trick film, a catch-all term for the popular early film genre of innovative, special effects-filled shorts—a genre Méliès himself had codified and popularised in his earlier works.

&quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; is highly satirical in tone, poking fun at 19th-century science by exaggerating it in the format of an adventure story. The film makes no pretense whatsoever to be scientifically plausible; the real waves in the splashdown scene are the only concession to realism. The film scholar Alison McMahan calls &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; one of the earliest examples of pataphysical film, saying it &quot;aims to show the illogicality of logical thinking&quot; with its satirically portrayed inept scientists, anthropomorphic moon face, and impossible transgressions of laws of physics. The film historian Richard Abel believes Méliès aimed in the film to &quot;invert the hierarchal values of modern French society and hold them up to ridicule in a riot of the carnivalesque&quot;. Similarly, the literary and film scholar Edward Wagenknecht described the film as a work &quot;satirizing the pretensions of professors and scientific societies while simultaneously appealing to man&#x27;s sense of wonder in the face of an unexplored universe.&quot;

The film&#x27;s satire also has a strong anti-imperialist vein. The film scholar Matthew Solomon notes that the last part of the film (the parade and commemoration sequence missing in some prints) is especially forceful in this regard. He argues that Méliès, who had previously worked as an anti-Boulangist political cartoonist, mocks imperialistic domination in the film by presenting his colonial conquerors as bumbling pedants who mercilessly attack the alien lifeforms they meet and return with a mistreated captive amid fanfares of self-congratulation. The statue of Barbenfouillis shown in the film&#x27;s final shot even resembles the pompous, bullying colonialists in Méliès&#x27;s political cartoons. The film scholar Elizabeth Ezra agrees that &quot;Méliès mocks the pretensions of colonialist accounts of the conquest of one culture by another,&quot; and adds that &quot;his film also thematizes social differentiation on the home front, as the hierarchical patterns on the moon are shown to bear a curious resemblance to those on earth.&quot;

== Release ==

Méliès, who had begun &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; in May 1902, finished the film in August of that year and began selling prints to French distributors in the same month. From September through December 1902, a hand-colored print of &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; was screened at Méliès&#x27;s Théâtre Robert-Houdin in Paris. The film was shown after Saturday and Thursday matinee performances by Méliès&#x27;s colleague and fellow magician, Jules-Eugène Legris, who appeared as the leader of the parade in the two final scenes. Méliès sold black-and-white and color prints of the film through his Star Film Company, where the film was assigned the catalogue number 399–411 and given the descriptive subtitle &quot;Pièce à grand spectacle en 30 tableaux&quot;. In France, black-and-white prints sold for 560, and hand-colored prints for 1,000. Méliès also sold the film indirectly through Charles Urban&#x27;s Warwick Trading Company in London.

Many circumstances surrounding the film—including its unusual budget, length, and production time, as well as its similarities to the 1901 New York attraction—indicate that Méliès was especially keen to release the film in the United States. Because of rampant film piracy, Méliès never received most of the profits of the popular film. One account reports that Méliès sold a print of the film to the Paris photographer Charles Gerschel for use in an Algiers theatre, under strict stipulation that the print only be shown in Algeria. Gerschel sold the print, and various other Méliès films, to the Edison Manufacturing Company employee Alfred C. Abadie, who sent them directly to Edison&#x27;s laboratories to be duplicated and sold by Vitagraph. Copies of the print spread to other firms, and by 1904 Siegmund Lubin, the Selig Polyscope Company, and Edison were all redistributing it. Edison&#x27;s print of the film was even offered in a hand-colored version available at a higher price, just as Méliès had done. Méliès was often uncredited altogether; for the first six months of the film&#x27;s distribution, the only American exhibitor to credit Méliès in advertisements for the film was Thomas Lincoln Tally, who chose the film as the inaugural presentation of his Electric Theater.

In order to combat the problem of film piracy that became clear during the release of &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;, Méliès opened an American branch of the Star Film Company, directed by his brother Gaston Méliès, in New York in 1903. The office was designed to sell Méliès&#x27;s films directly and to protect them by registering them under United States copyright. The introduction to the English-language edition of the Star Film Company catalogue announced: &quot;In opening a factory and office in New York we are prepared and determined energetically to pursue all counterfeiters and pirates. We will not speak twice, we will act!&quot;

Various trade arrangements were made with other film companies, including American Mutoscope and Biograph, the Warwick Trading Company, the Charles Urban Trading Co., Robert W. Paul&#x27;s studio, and Gaumont. In these negotiations, a print sale price of 0.15 per foot was standardised across the American market, which proved useful to Méliès. Later price standardisations by the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 hastened his financial ruin, as his films were impractically expensive under the new standards. After 1908, his films waned from the fashions of time as fanciful magic fell out of vogue.

== Reception ==
According to Méliès&#x27;s memoirs, his initial attempts to sell &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; to French fairground exhibitors met with failure because of the film&#x27;s unusually high price. Finally, Méliès offered to let one such exhibitor borrow a print of the film to screen for free. The applause from the very first showing was so enthusiastic that fairgoers kept the theatre packed until midnight. The exhibitor bought the film immediately, and when he was reminded of his initial reluctance he even offered to add 200 to compensate &quot;for [Méliès&#x27;s] inconvenience.&quot; The film was a pronounced success in France, running uninterrupted at the Olympia music hall in Paris for several months.

&quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; was met with especially large enthusiasm in the United States, where (to Méliès&#x27;s chagrin) its piracy by Lubin, Selig, Edison and others gave it wide distribution. Exhibitors in New York City, Washington, D.C., Cleveland, Detroit, New Orleans, and Kansas City reported on the film&#x27;s great success in their theatres. The film also did well in other countries, including Germany, Canada, and Italy, where it was featured as a headline attraction through 1904.

&quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; was one of the most popular films of the first few years of the 20th century, rivalled only by a small handful of others (similarly spectacular Méliès films such as &quot;The Kingdom of the Fairies&quot; and &quot;The Impossible Voyage&quot; among them). Late in life, Méliès remarked that &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; was &quot;surely not one of my best,&quot; but acknowledged that it was widely considered his masterpiece and that &quot;it left an indelible trace because it was the first of its kind.&quot; The film which Méliès was proudest of was &quot;Humanity Through the Ages&quot; (1908), a serious historical drama now presumed lost.

== Rediscovery ==

=== Black-and-white print ===

After Méliès&#x27;s financial difficulties and decline, most copies of his prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès&#x27;s films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a sudden fit of rage and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.

Thanks to the efforts of film history devotées, especially René Clair, Jean George Auriol, and Paul Gilson, Méliès and his work were rediscovered in the late 1920s. A &quot;Gala Méliès&quot; was held at the Salle Pleyel in Paris on 16 December 1929 in celebration of the filmmaker, and he was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1931. During this renaissance of interest in Méliès, the cinema manager Jean Mauclaire and the early film experimenter Jean Acme LeRoy both set out independently to locate a surviving print of &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;. Mauclaire obtained a copy from Paris in October 1929, and LeRoy found one from London in 1930, though both prints were incomplete; Mauclaire&#x27;s lacked the first scene, and LeRoy&#x27;s was missing the entire final sequence featuring the parade and commemorative statue. These prints were occasionally screened at retrospectives (including the Gala Méliès), avant-garde cinema showings, and other special occasions, sometimes in presentations by Méliès himself.

Following LeRoy&#x27;s death in 1932, his film collection was bought by the Museum of Modern Art in 1936. The museum&#x27;s acquisition and subsequent screenings of &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;, under the direction of MoMA&#x27;s film curator Iris Barry, opened the film up once again to a wide audience of Americans and Canadians and established it definitively as a landmark in the history of cinema. LeRoy&#x27;s incomplete print became the most commonly seen version of the film and the source print for most other copies, including the Cinémathèque Française&#x27;s print. A complete version of the film, including the entire celebration sequence, was finally reconstructed in 1997 from various sources by the Cinémathèque Méliès, a foundation set up by the Méliès family.

=== Hand-colored print ===
No hand-colored prints of &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; were known to have survived, until 1993, when one was given to the Filmoteca de Catalunya by an anonymous donor as part of a collection of two hundred silent films. It is unknown whether this version, a hand-colored print struck from a second-generation negative, was colored by Elisabeth Thuillier&#x27;s lab, but the perforations used imply that the copy was made before 1906. The flag waved during the launching scene in this copy is colored to resemble the flag of Spain, indicating that the hand-colored copy was made for a Spanish exhibitor.

In 1999, Anton Gimenez of the Filmoteca de Catalunya mentioned the existence of this print, which he believed to be in a state of total decomposition, to Serge Bromberg and Eric Lange of the French film company Lobster Films. Bromberg and Lange offered to trade a recently rediscovered film by Segundo de Chomón for the hand-colored print, and Gimenez accepted. Bromberg and Lange consulted various specialist laboratories in an attempt to restore the film, but because the reel of film had apparently decomposed into a rigid mass, none believed restoration to be possible. Consequently, Bromberg and Lange themselves set to work separating the film frames, discovering that only the edges of the film stock had decomposed and congealed together, and thus that many of the frames themselves were still salvageable. Between 2002 and 2005, various digitisation efforts allowed 13,375 fragments of images from the print to be saved. In 2010, a complete restoration of the hand-colored print was launched by Lobster Films, the Groupama Gan Foundation for Cinema, and the Technicolor Foundation for Cinema Heritage. The digitised fragments of the hand-colored print were reassembled and restored, with missing frames recreated with the help of a black-and-white print in the possession of the Méliès family, and time-converted to run at an authentic silent-film speed, 16 frames per second. The restoration was completed in 2011 at Technicolor&#x27;s laboratories in Los Angeles. Restoration costs were $1 million.

The restored version premiered on 11 May 2011, eighteen years after its discovery and 109 years after its original release, at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, with a new soundtrack by the French band Air. The restoration was released by Flicker Alley in a 2-disc Blu-ray and DVD edition featuring both color and black &amp; white versions of the film also including &quot;The Extraordinary Voyage&quot;, a feature-length documentary by Bromberg and Lange about the film&#x27;s restoration, in 2012. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. O. Scott called the restoration &quot;surely a cinematic highlight of the year, maybe the century.&quot;

== Legacy ==
As &quot;A Short History of Film&quot; notes, &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; combined &quot;spectacle, sensation, and technical wizardry to create a cosmic fantasy that was an international sensation.&quot; It was profoundly influential on later filmmakers, bringing creativity to the cinematic medium and offering fantasy for pure entertainment, a rare goal in film at the time. In addition, Méliès&#x27;s innovative editing and special effects techniques were widely imitated and became important elements of the medium. The film also spurred on the development of cinematic science fiction and fantasy by demonstrating that scientific themes worked on the screen and that reality could be transformed by the camera. In a 1940 interview, Edwin S. Porter said that it was by seeing &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; and other Méliès films that he &quot;came to the conclusion that a picture telling a story might draw the customers back to the theatres, and set to work in this direction.&quot; Similarly, D. W. Griffith said simply of Méliès: &quot;I owe him everything.&quot; Since these American directors are widely credited with developing modern film narrative technique, the literary and film scholar Edward Wagenknecht once summed up Méliès&#x27;s importance to film history by commenting that Méliès &quot;profoundly influenced both Porter and Griffith and through them the whole course of American film-making.&quot;

It remains Méliès&#x27;s most famous film, as well as a classic example of early cinema, with the image of the capsule stuck in the Man in the Moon&#x27;s eye particularly well known. The film has been evoked in other creative works many times, ranging from Segundo de Chomón&#x27;s 1908 unauthorised remake &quot;Excursion to the Moon&quot; through the extensive tribute to Méliès and the film in the Brian Selznick 2007 novel &quot;The Invention of Hugo Cabret&quot; and its 2011 Martin Scorsese film adaptation &quot;Hugo&quot;. Film scholar Andrew J. Rausch includes &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; among the &quot;32 most pivotal moments in the history of [film],&quot; saying it &quot;changed the way movies were produced.&quot; Chiara Ferrari&#x27;s essay on the film in &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;, which places &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; as the first entry, argues that the film &quot;directly reflects the histrionic personality of its director&quot;, and that the film &quot;deserves a legitimate place among the milestones in world cinema history.&quot;

<text>RFA &quot;Eddyness&quot; (A295) was an &quot;Eddy&quot;-class coastal tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), the naval auxiliary fleet of the United Kingdom, built by the Blyth Shipbuilding Company, in Blyth, Northumberland, England and launched in 1953. She was taken out of service at the beginning of 1963 and was eventually broken up at Valencia, Spain, in 1970.

<text>0304 is the fifth studio album by American singer Jewel, released on June 3, 2003, by Atlantic Records. Inspired by Jewel&#x27;s sudden success topping the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart in early November 2002 with a remix of &quot;Serve the Ego&quot;, the final single from her previous album &quot;This Way&quot;, the album is a radical departure from her previous folk-oriented musical efforts and is instead more pop and dance-focused.

&quot;0304&quot; produced three singles. The lead single &quot;Intuition&quot;, a top 20 hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, topped the Dance Club Songs chart, as did the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Stand&quot;. Its third single, &quot;2 Become 1&quot;, was less successful, peaking at 33 on the Adult Top 40 chart.

==Background==
Within the liner notes to &quot;0304&quot;, Jewel includes a note to her fans, explaining, &quot;This album may seem different to you.&quot; According to Jewel, the album is a result of her desire to create a &quot;modern interpretation of big band music. A record that [is] lyric-driven, like Cole Porter stuff, that also has a lot of swing...that combined dance, urban, and folk music.&quot; For the album, Jewel teamed with producers Lester Mendez (Shakira, Enrique Iglesias) and Rick Nowels (Madonna).

==Critical reception==

&quot;0304&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 63, based on nine reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic stated that &quot;it&#x27;s the first album of hers that&#x27;s a sheer pleasure to hear&quot;, while noting that &quot;[she] includes a note to her fans, explaining, &#x27;This album may seem different to you,&#x27; which is putting it mildly&quot;, to convey the surprising, yet pleasing modern sound, and that &quot;she puts herself out on the line more than she ever has, and she&#x27;s come up with her best record, with her best set of songs and best music yet.&quot; Ron Slomowicz from About.com declared that &quot;the album is balanced by dance pop that you would expect to hear on a Britney album.&quot; Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; was also positive, writing that &quot;the album is more pop than electronica, but it also presents one of the most startling—yet oddly fitting—transformations in pop history&quot; and also comparing the album to Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998) and &quot;American Life&quot; (2003). Barry Walters from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; agreed with Cinquemani, describing the album as &quot;essentially a wanna-be version of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;American Life&quot;&quot; and noting that &quot;she&#x27;s found herself an artificial flavor that tastes good.&quot; A positive review also came from &quot;Uncut&quot;, who wrote that &quot;the tunes are stunning, her voice has never sounded better and she makes serious points few others would dare in a pop context.&quot; Brian Hiatt from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; opined that the &quot;unexpected dance-pop vibrancy makes it Jewel&#x27;s best album.&quot;

The album also received some mixed reviews, with some critics criticizing the change of style adopted on the album. Alexis Petridis from &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Like Robbie Williams&#x27;s &quot;Escapology&quot;, &quot;0304&quot; virtually knocks itself out in its attempts to win over the US public&quot;, while commenting that she looks &quot;desperate&quot; and &quot;uncomfortable&quot; on the album. Darryl Sterdan from Jam! said that the album &quot;isn&#x27;t going to save her soul—or anyone else&#x27;s.&quot; Caroline Bansal from &quot;musicOMH&quot; described the album as &quot;an enjoyable 54 minutes of pop, full of catchy, chirpy songs, proving Jewel&#x27;s ear candy as well as eye candy credentials. The album could be the soundtrack of a summer&#x27;s day at the beach, or for getting ready for a girly night out.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;0304&quot; became the highest-debuting album of Jewel&#x27;s career, entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number two (behind Metallica&#x27;s &quot;St. Anger&quot;) with 144,000 copies sold in its first week. It earned a gold certification from Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) one month after its release, on July 14, 2003, and had sold over 771,000 copies in the United States as of June 2010.

<doc id="527414" wikidata="Q779121" url="?curid=527414" title="Cannibal! The Musical">
<text>Cannibal! The Musical (originally known as Alferd Packer: The Musical) is a 1993 American black comedy Western musical film directed, written, produced, co-scored by and starring Trey Parker in his directorial debut while studying at the University of Colorado at Boulder, before reaching fame with &quot;South Park&quot; alongside his friend Matt Stone who also stars in and produced the film. It is loosely based on the true story of Alfred &quot;Alferd&quot; Packer and the sordid details of the trip from Utah to Colorado that left his five fellow travelers dead and partially eaten. Trey Parker (credited as Juan Schwartz) stars as Alferd Packer, with frequent collaborators Stone, Dian Bachar, and others playing the supporting roles.

A live staged version was performed at Sierra College, in Rocklin, California, in May 1998. It was followed by Dad&#x27;s Garage Theater, Atlanta Georgia, in the fall of 1998. The Dad&#x27;s Garage version is highlighted in the special features of Troma&#x27;s DVD release of the movie. The show has continued to find small theaters and audiences across America and beyond for many years. In 2001, a production was staged Off-Broadway at the Kraine Theater on East 4th Street in New York.

In 2011, producer Jason McHugh released a book titled &quot;Shpadoinkle: The Making of Cannibal! The Musical&quot; which chronicles all aspects of the creation and continuation of the &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot; cult phenomenon.

==Plot==
The film begins with a reenactment of the gruesome act of cannibalism described by the prosecuting attorney during Alferd Packer&#x27;s 1883 trial. During this sensationalized account, a haggard Packer repeatedly insists that was not how it happened. During a break in the trial, Packer is enticed by journalist Polly Pry to tell his side of the story, which he proceeds to do, via flashback beginning with his horse Lianne galloping in a field.

In 1873, Packer was part of a group of miners in Bingham Canyon, Utah who hear of new prospects in Breckenridge. Together, the small group decide to travel together into Colorado Territory. Packer is appointed as the replacement for the original guide, since he claimed knowledge of the area. He and Lianne set off on what Packer estimates will be a three-week journey with a party of five miners: Shannon Wilson Bell, James Humphrey, Frank Miller, George Noon and Israel Swan.

Four weeks later, while attempting to visit Provo for supplies they become convinced they are lost. They are given local warning them of impending doom awaiting them in the mountains. Finally arriving in Provo, they run into a group of three fur trappers bound for Saguache; O.D. Loutzenheiser, Preston Nutter, and their diminutive leader, Jean &quot;Frenchy&quot; Cabazon. The trappers despise the miners, whom they contemptuously call &quot;diggers&quot;, yet seem to like Packer&#x27;s Arabian horse, telling Packer that she&#x27;s a &quot;trapper horse&quot;. The next day, Packer wakes up to discover his horse Lianne is missing. The men attempt to cross the Green River near the Utah border. Eventually, after a disastrous crossing of the Colorado River the Packer party is spotted by two &quot;Nihonjin&quot; Indians. They are taken back to the tribe&#x27;s encampment near Delta where the chief warns them of a winter storm, allowing them to wait it out with the tribe. Packer&#x27;s party also find the trappers camping out with the tribe, a small altercation breaks out over Lianne, whose feedbag Packer finds in their possession.

In the present time, Packer is sentenced to death by hanging, with his execution to occur in Lake City. That night, Polly reveals her growing affection for him through song. The next day, Polly visits Packer once again in prison, where he continues his story.

The men set out in the wilderness and begin to suspect that Packer is really only interested in following the trappers to find his horse. They soon run out of food, resorting to eating their shoes as they become lost in the snow-covered Rocky Mountains. An optimistic Swan sings about building a snowman; Bell shoots him in the head out of frustration. The men discuss their dire situation that night over the fire, speaking of the cannibalism that the Donner Party had to resort to in California. They decide to consume the body of their dead companion as Miller cuts up Swan&#x27;s body, and only Bell refuses to partake in the cannibalism. After a few more days, the party loses hope, which leads to talk of sacrificing one of their own. Packer convinces them for one more chance for a scouting trip, but when he returns, Bell has killed the others, claiming they planned to kill and eat him after Packer left. Packer is forced to throw a cleaver at Bell, seemingly killing him. He is then forced to cannibalize the others to wait out the rest of the winter.

Arriving in Saguache sometime later, Packer finds Lianne, who has taken to Cabazon, upsetting Packer. The sheriff of Saguache, suspicious of Packer arriving without the rest of his party, eventually finds out the fate of the other members and attempts to arrest Packer for cannibalism at a saloon. A bar-fight between Packer and the trappers occurs, which Packer wins after brutally attacking Cabazon&#x27;s groin using fighting techniques he learned from the Nihonjin chief, leaving Cabazon incapacitated. Following this, Packer attempts to flee to Wyoming, only to later be arrested there and brought back to Colorado to await judgment. However, he is saved at the last minute by Polly, who arrives on the scene with Lianne. Meanwhile, Cabazon, wants revenge against Packer for their fight in Saguache. The Nihonjin chief saves Packer by cutting his rope with a katana before beheading Cabazon. Packer, seeing that Polly brought back Lianne, he realizes he does not need her anymore and chooses Polly, the two kiss, only to be frightened by a still-alive but badly maimed Bell.

# &quot;Hang the Bastard&quot; – Company
# &quot;Shpadoinkle (Finale)&quot; – Polly, Alferd, and Company

Contrasting with the musical&#x27;s generally dark and morbid humor are its cheerful songs, all composed by Parker, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Build a Snowman&quot;, &quot;When I Was on Top of You&quot;, &quot;Hang the Bastard&quot;, and &quot;Shpadoinkle&quot; (pronounced &quot;shpah-doink-ul&quot;). The last of these is a transparent parody of the song &quot;Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin&#x27;&quot; from the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;.

Two songs that were originally going to be in the film, but later taken out, were &quot;Shatterproof&quot;, a rap song to be sung by Packer during the bar fight scene, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Stupid&quot;, a song to be sung by some of the Bingham Canyon miners after the reprise of &quot;Shpadoinkle&quot;. An interview with Ian Hardin (now known as Ian Keldin) revealed that Trey thought &quot;Shatterproof&quot; made Packer seem too tough.

==Production==

The film began as a 3-minute trailer made for a film class, having been an idea Parker and his friends had for a while but also inspired in part by Parker&#x27;s resentment towards his ex-fiancée Lianne Adamo after discovering her cheating on him not long before their wedding, with Packer&#x27;s disloyal horse &quot;Lianne&quot; in the final film being based on her. After the trailer drew much attention, Parker and Stone raised around $125,000 and began shooting the full-length film. The film was shot during weekends and on spring break in 1993, and according to Ian Hardin, most of the crew failed their film history class as a result. Filming was done on location throughout Colorado in Denver, Colorado National Monument, Black Canyon, and Ouray, with the courtroom scenes being shot in the actual courthouse that Alferd Packer was tried in, in Lake City, and the town scenes taking place in Provo, Saguache, and the hanging scene being shot in different parts of the Buckskin Joe Old West theme park in Canyon City.

A few incidents happened during filming, such as Parker getting a hairline hip fracture after being thrown from one of the horses playing &quot;Lianne&quot;, fights occasionally breaking out among the crew, some of the main cast experiencing cold shock and almost being swept away by strong currents from crossing the icy Gunnison River that doubled for the Green River, as well as inclement weather and even an avalanche complicating shooting.

This film was originally titled &quot;Alferd Packer: The Musical&quot; in 1993. The film premiered on October 31, 1993, in Boulder, Colorado, at a cinema near the University of Colorado campus. A fake protest organized by friends of Parker and Stone, organized along the lines of an animal rights demonstration, took place in front of the theater. The film then played at Raindance Film Festival in October 2004. Parker and Stone attended.

It was not released generally until 1996, however, when Troma Entertainment picked it up and renamed it &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot; out of concern that not enough people outside of Colorado knew who Parker was. Few people outside of Colorado ever saw the film since Troma did not distribute it widely. Parker and Stone&#x27;s animated satire &quot;South Park&quot; debuted the following year.

Several live productions of the show have been mounted, with excerpts from one live version available on the DVD.

==Home media==
Following Matt and Trey&#x27;s success with &quot;South Park&quot;, Troma re-released the film on VHS and DVD and it enjoyed a decent cult following. The DVD contains a &quot;Drunken Director&#x27;s Commentary&quot; where Parker and Stone along with most of the cast get drunk as they watch the film, although there are a few times when the commentary cuts out.

The film has since been released on UMD for the Sony PSP. A special edition 13th anniversary DVD was released by Troma with added features, including all-new interviews with the cast and crew.

The film was re-released in November 2008 as the first of the &quot;Tromasterpiece Collection,&quot; as Troma considers &quot;Cannibal!&quot; to be one of its best films. Included in the new two-disc version, with over three hours of special features, never-before-seen deleted material and stage shows. Songs such as &quot;Shatter Proof&quot; and the early short films of Parker and Stone were considered to be a part of the new DVD, but these additions were ultimately rejected.

In September 2024, Boutique label Vinegar Syndrome announced the world premiere Blu-ray edition for release in November of that same year. The disc will include a remaster in 4K with the involvement of original stars Jason McHugh and Dian Bachar

In September 2024, British studio Refuse Films announced a Blu-ray special edition for release in December of that same year. The disc will include a remaster in HD, with the film presented in its original open matte aspect ratio.

==Stage productions==
There have been several amateur productions of &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot; since 1996. The first was at the Sierra College in Northern California and then at Dad&#x27;s Garage Theater where it won accolades by fans and the press.

In 2001, Saturday Players launched a six-month off-off-Broadway run of the show that earned critical acclaim and returning audience members.

In 2004, &quot;Cannibal&quot; made its European debut in Rome at the Teatro di Servi.

In 2005, the first High School group attempted the show at The Ironwood Ridge High School in Tucson, Arizona, but the show was censored by the school and performed off campus as a benefit. Later that year the show made its German debut at the University of Regensburg and played many small colleges and community houses in the US.

In 2006, the show debuted at its first Fringe Festivals in Minneapolis and Victoria, Canada and continued to find adoption by small colleges and community theaters.

In 2008, The Insurgo Theater Movement launched the show in Las Vegas for the first of several runs by their company. Unexpected Productions launched the first of four October runs of Cannibal in Seattle.

Also in 2008, The Rival Theatre Company produced the first large-scale professional production. The show ran from July 31 to August 25 at the George Square Theatre, Edinburgh for a total of 26 performances. It starred Aimie Atkinson as Polly Pry and James Topping as Alferd Packer. Original film cast member Jason McHugh made a guest appearance as Mr. Mills. Other guest stars included Jim Bowen and The Q Brothers.

In 2011, M.P.M.M. Productions, performed the musical in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada during the 2011 Winnipeg Fringe Festival. It won &quot;The Best of Fest&quot; for its venue (meaning it outsold other shows in the venue and was awarded an additional show). The show also debuted in St Louis and Denver with great reviews and enthusiastic casts and audience members.

In May 2012, Logan Donahoo Presents performed a version of the musical in Orlando, Florida during the 2012 Orlando International Fringe Theatre Festival, in the Yellow venue. The show was successful, receiving positive reviews, and winning Patron&#x27;s Pick for its venue, meaning that it had outsold all of the other shows and was awarded an additional performance.

&quot;Trey Parker&#x27;s Cannibal! The Musical&quot; played in Toronto at David Mirvish&#x27;s Panasonic Theatre for a four-week run (February 10 to March 8, 2015). Additional book, lyrics, and music by Christopher Bond, Aaron Eyre, and Trevor Martin.

It was announced in early 2014 that a production of the show is being produced at the Waterfront Theatre in Vancouver, B.C. by independent traveling theatre troupe Last Chance Productions. The show ran from June 12, 2014, until March 8, 2015, with two separate seating areas (a &quot;Gore Zone&quot; where audience members are subject to splash-zone-esque involvement, and a less messy &quot;Gore-Free Zone&quot;.)

Trey Parker&#x27;s CANNIBAL THE MUSICAL! had its first national tour in 2017 which rehearsed out of Toronto before heading to the Capitol Theatre in Windsor, ON the Canadian cast featured Greg Carruthers, David DiFrancesco, Shaeane Jimenez, Michelle Nash, Taylor Lavigne, Lucas Popowich, Brandon Knox, and Benjamin Zoëy. This production toured to the Overture Center in Madison, Wisconsin and Tennessee Performing Arts Center Andrew Johnson Theater in Nashville, Tennessee.

In 2019, Cannibal the Musical had its Bay Area premiere. It was performed by The Other Other Theatre Company in San Francisco. The show ran from July 21–29 at MoonSpace.

The Town Hall Arts Center in Matt Stone&#x27;s hometown of Littleton, CO produced a stage production of Cannibal! The Musical for a limited run (October 25, 2024 – November 3, 2024) as part of the 2024-2025 season. Town Hall Arts Center is less than a mile from Alferd Packer&#x27;s burial site in the Littleton Cemetery.

==Reception==

Marc Savlov of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; enjoyed the film, opining that it was &quot;a ridiculous, over-the-top carnival of gore, sophomorically sly humor, and cheese-whiz choreography that manages -- above all odds -- to be cheerily invigorating as well&quot; before giving it a score of 3/5. Todd Doogan of &quot;The Digital Bits&quot; praised the film, labelling it a &quot;wacky meshing of 1950s musicals with splatter movies and Farrelly Brothers/Zucker/Abrams-style comedies&quot; that was &quot;simply perfect.&quot; In a review written for &quot;Empire&quot;, Kim Newman gave the &quot;Western horror musical comedy&quot; a score of 3/5 and concluded, &quot;It has its longeurs but there&#x27;s an air of genial enthusiasm, tempered by sick humour, that is surprisingly engaging.&quot; Germain Lussier of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; commended the &quot;horror comedy musical&quot; and stated, &quot;It&#x27;s rough around the edges, gross, offensive, and at times a little hard to watch, but the good outweighs the bad so massively, you can&#x27;t help but fall in love.&quot;

Alex Castle of &quot;IGN&quot; gave the film a score of 6/10 and wrote, &quot;So is it a good movie? That depends on what you&#x27;re looking for. If you&#x27;re looking for brief flashes of the brilliance that would become far more stable once &quot;South Park&quot; got going, you&#x27;ll find them here. If you&#x27;re looking for a movie that can stand alone, out of the shadow of its creators&#x27; later accomplishments, you may be disappointed.&quot; Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt the film was &quot;amateurish&quot; and &quot;pretty stupid&quot; but &quot;not completely appalling&quot; with &quot;flashes of real humor&quot; and &quot;refreshingly ludicrous notes that even people old enough to see this movie without a guardian can appreciate.&quot; Allan Ulrich of the &quot;SFGate&quot; had a positive response to the film, calling it a &quot;tasty 90 minutes of yummy production numbers and intense spiritual crises&quot; and concluding, &quot;Admittedly, &quot;Cannibal: The Musical&quot; seems a bit overextended; the soppy ballad delivered by the newspaper reporter who believes in the hero&#x27;s innocence doesn&#x27;t make it even as bogus R &amp; H. But it will take a truly jaded soul to push away from the table before this often hilarious meal is over.&quot;

<text>Joan Anita Barbara Armatrading (, born 9 December 1950) is an English singer-songwriter and guitarist. Her first major commercial success came with her third and fourth albums, &quot;Joan Armatrading&quot; (1976) and &quot;Show Some Emotion&quot; (1977), and she continues to play live and record studio albums. A three-time Grammy Award nominee, Armatrading has also been nominated twice for BRIT Awards as Best Female Artist. She received an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contemporary Song Collection in 1996.

==Early life and education ==
Joan Anita Barbara Armatrading, the third of six children, was born in 1950 in the town of Basseterre in what was then the British colony of Saint Christopher and Nevis. Her father was a carpenter and her mother a housewife. When she was three years old, her parents moved with their two eldest boys to Birmingham in England, sending Armatrading to live with her grandmother on the West Indian island of Antigua. 

In early 1958, at the age of seven, she joined her parents in Brookfields, then a district of Birmingham. Her father had played in a band in his youth, later forbidding his children from touching his guitar. At about the age of 14 Armatrading began writing songs by setting her own limericks to music on a piano that her mother had purchased as &quot;a piece of furniture&quot;. Armatrading then began teaching herself guitar after her mother had bought her one that was worth £3 () from a pawn shop in exchange for two prams.

Armatrading left school at the age of 15 to help support her family. She lost her first job (as a typist and comptometer operator) after taking her guitar to work and playing it during tea-breaks.

==Career==
===Late 1960s and 1970s===
Armatrading first performed in a concert at Birmingham University for her brother at the age of about 16. She only knew her own songs, but her brother asked her to perform something that would be familiar to the audience; she chose &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;. She then performed her own songs around the local area with a friend from school, and played bass- and rhythm-guitar at local clubs. In 1968 Armatrading joined a touring production of the stage musical &quot;Hair&quot;. There she met the lyricist Pam Nestor in 1970, and they worked together on Armatrading&#x27;s debut album &quot;Whatever&#x27;s for Us&quot;, released by Cube Records in 1972. Nestor wrote the lyrics to eleven of the 14 songs on the album, while Armatrading wrote the lyrics to three of them, performed all the vocals, wrote all the music and played an array of instruments on the album. Although Nestor was credited as co-lyricist, Cube regarded Armatrading as the more likely star material. These events produced a tension that broke up the partnership.

On 31 October 1972, Armatrading appeared on the BBC Radio 1 &quot;John Peel Show&quot; performing &quot;Head of the Table&quot;, &quot;Spend A Little Time&quot;, &quot;Child Star&quot; and &quot;Whatever&#x27;s For Us&quot;. She sang and played acoustic guitar and piano. In 1973, Cube released on the Fly label (catalogue: Bug 31) Armatrading&#x27;s first single, &quot;Lonely Lady&quot; (with lyrics by Nestor), a song that had not been included on the album. It proved unsuccessful in the charts, and a period of inactivity for Armatrading followed while she extricated herself from her contract with Cube. The single was subsequently withdrawn by Cube and re-released as a promotional single in the US by Armatrading&#x27;s new label A&amp;M Records, the same year (as A&amp;M1452). In January 1974, she appeared again on the &quot;John Peel Show&quot;. Performing &quot;Some Sort of Love Song&quot;, &quot;Lonely Lady&quot; and &quot;Freedom&quot;, she again sang and played acoustic guitar and piano, but was accompanied by supporting musicians Snowy White (guitar), Mike Tomich (bass) and Brian Glassock (drums).

In 1975, Armatrading was free to sign with A&amp;M Records, and issued the album &quot;Back to the Night&quot;, which she promoted on tour with six-piece, English jazz-pop group The Movies. Armatrading credited English singer Elkie Brooks on the sleeve notes as she had cooked for Armatrading and the band in the studio while they had been making the album, which was produced by Brooks&#x27; then husband Pete Gage. A major publicity relaunch in 1976 and the involvement of producer Glyn Johns propelled her next album, &quot;Joan Armatrading&quot;, into the Top 20 and spawned the Top-10 hit single &quot;Love and Affection&quot;. The album mixed acoustic work with jazz-influenced material, and this style was retained for the 1977 follow-up &quot;Show Some Emotion&quot;, also produced by Glyn Johns, as was 1978&#x27;s &quot;To the Limit&quot;. These albums included songs which became staples of Armatrading&#x27;s live shows, including &quot;Willow&quot;, &quot;Down to Zero&quot;, &quot;Tall in the Saddle&quot;, and &quot;Kissin&#x27; and a Huggin. Also at this time Armatrading wrote and performed &quot;The Flight of the Wild Geese&quot;, which was used during the opening- and end-titles of the 1978 war film &quot;The Wild Geese&quot;.
The song was included on the soundtrack album for the film, originally released by A&amp;M Records, later released under licence as a Cinephile DVD. A live album entitled &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; was released in 1979.

Between 1972 and 1976, Armatrading made a total of eight appearances in session for the John Peel show, and the decade saw her become the first Black British female singer-songwriter to enjoy international success. On 14 May 1977, Armatrading appeared as the musical guest on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. She performed &quot;Love and Affection&quot; and &quot;Down to Zero&quot;.

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1980, Armatrading revised her playing style and released &quot;Me Myself I&quot;, a harder rock- and pop-oriented album produced by Richard Gottehrer, who had previously produced albums for Blondie. The album became Armatrading&#x27;s highest ever charting album both in the UK and the US, while the title track became her second UK Top 40 hit single. In that year, she performed on Rockpalast night. The same pop style as on her previous album, now coupled with synthesisers, was also evident on the 1981 album &quot;Walk Under Ladders&quot; and 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Key&quot;. All three of these albums were Top 10 successes in the UK, with &quot;The Key&quot; also producing the hit single &quot;Drop the Pilot&quot;, Armatrading&#x27;s third UK Top 40 hit single (UK #11). To capitalise on her success, A&amp;M released the best of compilation album, &quot;Track Record&quot;, in 1983.

Armatrading performed in 1985 at a sold-out concert at the Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado and another concert in Arizona with Cook da Books. That year she released her next album, &quot;Secret Secrets&quot;. The album was a top 20 hit but failed to yield any hit singles, cementing Armatrading&#x27;s status as an &quot;album artist&quot;. Taking over production responsibilities herself, she recorded the albums &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; (1986), &quot;The Shouting Stage&quot; (1988) and &quot;Hearts and Flowers&quot; (1990) for A&amp;M Records, which all made the UK Top 40 but failed to achieve the level of commercial success of her earlier works despite successful national tours (a show from her 1988 &quot;Shouting Stage&quot; tour was also filmed for television).

In 1989, she was the guest of Sue Lawley on the BBC Radio 4 radio programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; where her favourite choice was Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Madame George&quot;. Armatrading&#x27;s full list included Ella Fitzgerald and Gustav Mahler. Her luxury item was a guitar, while her castaway&#x27;s book was &quot;Why Didn&#x27;t They Ask Evans?&quot; by Agatha Christie.

In 1991, A&amp;M released the compilation &quot;The Very Best of Joan Armatrading&quot; which returned her to the Top 10. However, her following studio album for A&amp;M, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Square the Circle&quot;, did not replicate this success and would be her final recording for the label. Following her departure from A&amp;M, a label she had been with for almost 20 years, Armatrading signed with RCA for her 1995 album &quot;What&#x27;s Inside&quot;. Despite various television appearances and a full tour (which included a string quartet in addition to her stage band), the album was not a commercial success, becoming her lowest charting studio album in 20 years. In August 1996 Armatrading performed at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival. In December 1998, she released &quot;Lullabies with a Difference&quot;, an album of lullabies contributed by her and several of her favourite artists, in honour of PACES, a charity for children with cerebral palsy.

===2000s onwards===
In 2003, no longer attached to a major label, she released the album &quot;Lovers Speak&quot;. Though it was her first album in eight years, it met with little commercial success. In 2004, she released a live album, &quot;&quot;, which was a recording of a concert from her &quot;Lovers Speak&quot; tour.

Her 2007 album &quot;Into the Blues&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard Blues Chart&quot;, making Armatrading the first UK female artist to earn that distinction. &quot;Into the Blues&quot;, which Armatrading called &quot;the CD I&#x27;ve been promising myself to write for a long time&quot;, was nominated for a Grammy Award, also making her the first female UK artist to be nominated in the Grammy Blues category.
In 2007, Armatrading appeared in Episode 3 of the second series of &quot;Live from Abbey Road&quot; performing &quot;Tall in the Saddle&quot; from her 1976 self-titled album, and &quot;Woman in Love&quot; from the album &quot;Into The Blues&quot;. She also appeared on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland.&quot;

In 2008, she was part of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s True Colors Tour 2008.

On 29 March 2010, she released a new album, &quot;This Charming Life&quot;. The album peaked at No. 4 on the US Billboard Folk Albums chart. She embarked on an international tour to promote it, and a concert from this tour in April 2010 at the Royal Albert Hall in London was released on the CD/DVD album &quot;Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;, along with two tracks from a concert in Denver, Colorado, US, in February 2011. In 2012, she released the album &quot;Starlight&quot;.

Armatrading has always supported new music and local talent. For her 2012 &quot;Starlight&quot; tour she invited 56 singer–songwriters/artists to open for her in their respective home towns before her main tour support Chris Wood. Each of the artists opening for her across the UK also had a track selected for a three disc compilation released by her record label Hypertension Music. She presented &quot;Armatrading&#x27;s Singer-Songwriters&quot;, a two-part radio series showcasing these artists, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 in February 2013.

Between 2014 and 2015, Armatrading embarked on her last major tour, the Me Myself I Tour, the first to feature her solo on stage. An accompanying CD/DVD album, entitled &quot;Me Myself I World Tour&quot;, was released in 2016.

In 2016, Armatrading was commissioned by director Phyllida Lloyd and the Donmar Warehouse to write the music to an all-female production of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Armatrading released an accompanying digital album, &quot;The Tempest Songs&quot;.

In 2018, she signed to BMG. Her first album for the label, &quot;Not Too Far Away&quot;, was released in May 2018.

In May 2021, she announced that her new album &quot;Consequences&quot; would be released later that year and shared a sample track, &quot;Already There&quot;; the album was released in June of that year. In 2022, she released a live album, &quot;Live at Asylum Chapel&quot;, and a book of selected lyrics, &quot;The Weakness in Me&quot;, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of her performing career.

In 2022, she composed her first classical work, &quot;Symphony No. 1&quot;; it was premiered by the Chineke! Orchestra at Southbank Centre in London on 24 November 2023. It is to be recorded for Decca Records. In October 2024, she announced a new album, &quot;How Did This Happen and What Does It Now Mean&quot;; it was released on 22 November. The music video for its first single, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Moving&quot; was released 2 October 2024.

===Appearances and other media===
In addition to recording, Armatrading has toured extensively and appeared in high-profile concerts such as &quot;The Picnic at Blackbushe&quot; in 1978 (alongside Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton) and The Prince&#x27;s Trust Rock Gala in 1983. She also appeared in the film &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Third Ball&quot; in 1987. She has also made many appearances on television, including &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; in 1975, &quot;Joan Armatrading: Rock Over Europe&quot; in 1980, &quot;Joan Armatrading in Concert&quot; in 1982, &quot;Late Night in Concert&quot; in 1984, &quot;Joan Armatrading&quot; in 1985 and &quot;In Concert&quot; in 1988.

Armatrading presented a five-part series on BBC Radio 4 called &quot;Joan Armatrading&#x27;s Favourite Guitarists&quot; which was broadcast in July 2009, in which she talked to guitarists about their music and their technique. She followed this up with another five-part series called &quot;Joan Armatrading: More Guitar Favourites&quot;, which was broadcast in November and December 2011.

On 19 May 2015 Armatrading appeared on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, singing &quot;Me Myself I&quot;. On 11 May 2018 she was a guest on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; and performed her new single &quot;I Like It When We&#x27;re Together&quot;.

In September 2019 Armatrading was the subject of the one-hour documentary &quot;Me Myself I&quot;, aired on BBC Four, in which she tells her life story, both as a songwriter and as a performer, with key performances from many of the musicians she has influenced.

Armatrading is a self-confessed fan of comics and actually appeared as herself in a 1983 edition of &quot;The Beano&quot;, in the &quot;Tom, Dick and Sally&quot; comic strip.

==Style==
Armatrading possesses the vocal range of a contralto. Her music draws on a wide range of influences including rock, folk, jazz, blues, soul, and reggae.

Her songs have been described as &quot;some of the most deeply personal and emotionally naked ... of our times&quot;. In a 2003 interview, she said: &quot;My songs aren&#x27;t about me at all. They&#x27;re always about love, the pain and anguish of it. But the way I&#x27;ve always written is from observation. They&#x27;re about what I see other people going through. If the songs were about me I&#x27;d be so embarrassed I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to walk out the front door.&quot; She went on to say: &quot;the optimistic songs reveal a bit more of me because that&#x27;s how I feel. I&#x27;m definitely a &#x27;glass is half full&#x27; kind of a person.&quot; Many of her lyrics do not specify the gender of their subjects and she frequently uses the word &quot;you&quot; rather than a gender pronoun.

==Guitars==
Armatrading performs on both six- and twelve-string acoustic and electric guitars. She has played on Ovation acoustic instruments since 1973, and said this about them in an interview with the magazine &quot;Guitar Player&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m a bit of a hitter, you see – I bash – and I like to have everything going at once: bass, harmony, and melody. This is why I love Ovations. They are very powerful-sounding guitars, and when I hit those strings, they ring with a nice, clear, percussive – but not overly bright – sound that highlights the rhythms I like to play.&quot; She has played Fender Stratocaster and Gibson electric guitars. For her 2012–13 tour, she performed on six- and 12-string Ovations, Stratocasters, and customised Tom Anderson guitars, while for her 2014–2015 Me Myself I Tour, she performed on Ovation and Variax instruments.

==Personal life==
Armatrading is reluctant to discuss her personal life in interviews. In a 2003 interview with David Thomas of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, she said:
In addition to her music career, in 2001, after five years of studying, Armatrading earned a BA degree in history from the Open University, of which she is now a trustee. Between 2005 and 2010, Armatrading served as president of the Women of the Year Lunches. She has been a trustee of The Prince&#x27;s Trust since 2020 and an ambassador since 1983.

Armatrading entered into a civil partnership with artist Maggie Butler in the Shetland Islands in 2011, the day after the Shetland Folk Festival, but does not talk publicly about being gay.

Armatrading lives in Surrey, where she owns Bumpkin Studios, a purpose-built recording facility in the grounds of her home where she has recorded most of her albums since &quot;Sleight of Hand.&quot;

A younger brother, Tony Armatrading, was a stage, film, and television actor who lived in Los Angeles. He died of cancer on 10 May 2021, at the age of 59.

Armatrading was a guest at the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla in 2023.

==Collaborations==
Armatrading performed as a cameo vocalist for the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Your Head&quot; on the 1986 Queen album &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;.

In 1997, she made an appearance on the charity single &quot;Perfect Day&quot;.

Armatrading&#x27;s song &quot;In These Times&quot; from her 2003 album &quot;Lovers Speak&quot; appeared on the compilation album &quot;Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace&quot; which was released in 2008 by The Art of Peace Foundation.

==Honours==

Armatrading has been nominated three times for a Grammy Award and twice for a Brit Award as best female vocalist. She received an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contemporary Song Collection in 1996. She has received honorary degrees from the Liverpool John Moores University (2000), the University of Birmingham (2002), the University of Northampton (2003), Aston University (2006), the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (2008), and the Open University and the University of the West Indies (2013). In 2022, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of St Andrews. She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2001 Birthday Honours and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to music, charity and equal rights.

In October 2011, Armatrading was presented with a BASCA Gold Badge Award in recognition of her contribution to music. In May 2012, before her concert at Uttoxeter, as part of the 2012 Acoustic Festival of Britain, she was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award.

In April 2016, she was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2016 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in recognition of her &quot;influence on a generation of singer-songwriters [as] one of the outstanding voices in British music since the 1970s&quot;.

In October 2022, Armatrading was made an Honorary Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge. Delphine Mordey, Fellow and Director of Studies in Music, said: &quot;We believe that Ms Armatrading embodies and lives the spirit of Newnham. Intellectually curious and focused on achieving her full potential, she is pioneering, inspiring, supporting and sharing.&quot;

<doc id="527428" wikidata="Q1771826" url="?curid=527428" title="Metamorphosis (Hilary Duff album)">
<text>Metamorphosis is the second studio album by American actress and singer Hilary Duff. The album was released on August 26, 2003, by Hollywood Records as the follow-up to her Christmas album, &quot;Santa Claus Lane&quot; (2002). According to Duff, the album incorporates elements of pop and rock music, and it represents changes that are specific to her life and that everyone experiences. Duff worked with several producers on the album such as The Matrix. Others who collaborated on the album include Chico Bennett, Matthew Gerrard, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi.

The album coincided with other high-profile projects in which she was involved in other media. &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics; some complimented it for being a modern-day bubblegum album, while others considered the album to be a promotional gimmick for Duff, lacking real substance. The album debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 203,000 copies in its first week. In the following week, the album rose to number one on the chart. It became the eighth best-selling album of 2003 in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan, selling 2.6 million copies in a period of five months. By late 2005, the album had sold five million copies worldwide. Later the album was certified quadraple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over four million copies in the United States. For Hollywood Records, &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; was the label&#x27;s first high-seller in several years and led to the company&#x27;s further successful cultivation of new artists and brands using the Disney Channel. She was the sixth solo artist to peak at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 under the age of 18.

Three singles were released from the album. The lead single, &quot;So Yesterday&quot;, was released in July 2003 to mixed to positive reviews. The song only made a moderate impact in the United States, peaking in the top 50 at number 42 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Internationally, it peaked within the top-ten of the music charts in Australia, Canada, France and the UK Singles Chart. The second single, &quot;Come Clean&quot;, released in early 2004, was more successful in the United States, peaking at number 35 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and becoming her best-selling single in the country. The third and final single from the album, &quot;Little Voice&quot;, was only released internationally. Duff further promoted the album with the Metamorphosis Tour, which began in November 2003 and ended in May 2004.

== Background ==
Hilary Duff had always wanted to follow in the footsteps of her elder sister, Haylie Duff. Duff watched her sister rehearsing in 2001, after which she told her mother Susan Duff that she wanted to be involved in singing. During the same time period, she attended a Radio Disney concert where she met Andre Recke, whose client Myra was performing. According to Duff, watching the pop musicians preparing and warming up backstage at the concert made her think, &quot;I want to do this so bad&quot;. Recke said he thought Duff, who was popular with preteens at the time because of her role in the popular Disney Channel original series &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;, had &quot;something special ... Sometimes you just have that feeling, that, &#x27;Wow, she&#x27;s a star.&#x27;&quot; After becoming determined to start a music career, Duff resumed her vocal lessons—which she had started before her acting career began—and became one of Recke&#x27;s clients. &quot;I&#x27;ve always had a big drive&quot;, she said. &quot;When I felt like something looked fun or I wanted to accomplish something, I really just go for it ... I didn&#x27;t really know what it was gonna be like, but I knew I wanted to try it and I knew that I could do it.&quot; Duff recorded several songs for Disney soundtrack and compilation albums, and a Christmas album, &quot;Santa Claus Lane&quot;, in 2002. Her songs &quot;I Can&#x27;t Wait&quot;, &quot;Why Not&quot; and &quot;What Dreams Are Made Of&quot; were hits on Radio Disney, but Recke and executives at Buena Vista Music Group envisioned &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; as a vehicle by which Duff could reach a more mature audience.

== Recording ==
Duff, her mother Susan, and Recke enlisted the songwriting and production team The Matrix—whom Recke had previously hired to write songs for Myra&#x27;s 2001 eponymous debut album—and songwriter Charlie Midnight, who had contributed to &quot;Santa Claus Lane&quot; (2002). According to Duff, her mother, Recke and Duff herself worked very hard to get music that she related to and was age-appropriate for her. Duff said that she did not want to make &quot;a really poppy album&quot; because that was not the type of music she listened to. The presence of The Matrix was noted because of their work on Avril Lavigne&#x27;s highly successful debut album, &quot;Let Go&quot; (2002), but Duff said that she did not want to emulate other artists: &quot;There are definitely people I respect and I love their music, but there was never really an artist that I said, &#x27;I want to be just like them...&#x27; ... I wanted to be like myself&quot;.

According to Duff, although she did not write most of the songs, she collaborated on each of them. Aside from The Matrix and Charlie Midnight, contributions to the album came from singer-songwriter Meredith Brooks, Kara DioGuardi, Matthew Gerrard, John Shanks and Duff&#x27;s sister, Haylie, who Duff said knows her better than &quot;anyone else in the world&quot;. Duff discussed her feelings with some of the songwriters, and she praised them because they were open to her opinions and &quot;really got it&quot;. She said that she would have liked more time to work with the songwriters and co-write more of her own material, saying &quot;I feel like you need time to really get in touch with yourself to do that&quot;. In May 2004, Meredith Brooks, writer and producer of &quot;Party Up&quot;, complained about the million-dollar budgets major labels spend to produce albums, saying &quot;There&#x27;s something seriously wrong with all that! You can&#x27;t keep that going. Artists have to sell millions of records for anybody to make money off of those bloated budgets.&quot;

== Production ==

=== Influences and sound ===
As Duff was really into Destiny&#x27;s Child at the time, initial work on the album carried a more &quot;urban style&quot; than the finished project. The work, according to Chico Bennett, &quot;didn&#x27;t strike a chord&quot;, so they went for a different approach. Recke asked Duff what type of music she would like to do, to which she responded: &quot;Well, growing up, we listened to a lot of rock music, and I like a little bit more guitar in it.&quot; So they decided to go about the record with a &quot;real band vibe&quot;. According to Recke, the album is still pop, but with a &quot;little rockier edge to it&quot;. They wanted to do something that would fit Duff&#x27;s personality and &quot;something that she wanted to be&quot;. Recke made sure that the music was what Duff wanted, as there&#x27;s &quot;nothing worse than an artist not excited to perform it&quot;.

Recke, Landers and Duff wanted to make &quot;not just a record that might appeal to an audience because of her television popularity&quot;, but they wanted to create a &quot;really fun, great pop record that Hilary could get behind personally&quot;. According to Recke, the songs on the album were all &quot;molded around&quot; Duff. He cited this as the reason why the album &quot;feels so authentic&quot;. According to Midnight, the album does not contain &quot;just a bunch of different songs that don&#x27;t have anything to do with the others. When you look at the overall roster of songs, they all do fit into a certain context.&quot; Of the process, Midnight explained:
Considering how young she was, I thought that was interesting, that it wouldn’t be a complete fabrication, because I’m used to working with very strong artists, strong personalities. After I got to know Hilary and we hung out, I saw that she had real points of view and was going to be real involved, which makes it easier to actually create the music—coming from somewhere, from a personality, from a point of view, rather than created out of whole cloth. So that excited me. Hilary had so much personality that she was able to convey on a recording.
=== Contributors ===
As she was not familiar with the process of creating an album, Duff met with many different record producers. She sat down with each of them and told them what she enjoyed listening to. In some instances, Duff would go into detail about events in her personal life that could be used for inspiration in a song. While Recke and Landers were in charge of looking for the &quot;right songs&quot; for the album, Duff was also heavily involved in the song selection and in &quot;making sure the lyrics were where she was at that age&quot;.

Kara DioGuardi, who had long outgrown Disney, thus making her unaware of who Duff was, was told by an acquaintance of hers who worked at EMI that she should meet up with Recke. DioGuardi told her friend that she was &quot;on a tight schedule&quot;, but later decided that she&#x27;d &quot;try it&quot;. During their initial meeting, DioGuardi played Recke several songs that she had written. After hearing the selection, he immediately told her that he wanted &quot;Come Clean&quot; and &quot;Little Voice&quot; for Duff, saying that they were perfect for her.

Having liked the chemistry between Charlie Midnight, Recke and Duff on &quot;Santa Claus Lane&quot;, Landers asked Midnight to provide material for &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. He submitted &quot;quite a few songs&quot; for the album because he loved working with Duff. He concentrated on trying to &quot;bounce things&quot; off Recke, Landers and Duff about &quot;what topics they thought would be right&quot; for the album. Midnight was &quot;pretty much ground zero&quot; for a lot of people involved with &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, according to Charlton Pettus; he was the lyricist who &quot;seemed to get the tone of it all&quot;.

Pettus deemed his involved in the project as being &quot;completely accidental&quot;; he had just moved from New Jersey to Los Angeles and was introduced to Midnight through their mutual friend Marc Swersky. The three wrote several songs together with no particular artist in mind. One song in particular, &quot;Workin&#x27; It Out&quot;, was given to Duff for &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. Similarly, Midnight had written &quot;Love Just Is&quot; with Jim Marr and Wendy Page without &quot;necessarily thinking of Hilary at first&quot;. After insisting that Duff should record it, Recke played the song for her and she &quot;absolutely loved it&quot;.

The Matrix, a record production team consisting of Lauren Christy, Graham Edwards and Scott Spock had &quot;just come off the back of a very successful little run&quot; with three number one hits with Avril Lavigne when Disney approached them and asked if they would be interested in writing for Duff. They agreed and called Midnight, who had already been involved in the project. Christy cited him as one of her favorite writers and her mentor. Being familiar with their work, meeting with The Matrix was &quot;very exciting&quot; for Duff. Upon hearing the demos for &quot;So Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Where Did I Go Right?&quot; and &quot;The Math&quot; – performed by Christy – Hollywood Records &quot;immediately loved them&quot;.

=== Writing ===
DioGuardi wrote &quot;Come Clean&quot; with John Shanks as a &quot;personal statement&quot; to herself. At the time, she had just finished work on Marc Anthony&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Mended&quot; (2002), and was &quot;really, really uninspired writing to tracks&quot;. DioGuardi felt as if it was &quot;very binding&quot;, as &quot;the melodies had to be within the constraints of what was going on in the tracks&quot;. According to DioGuardi, the song was &quot;kind of this statement for [herself]&quot;, as she was &quot;getting away from all of that&quot; and &quot;going to go back to the way it should be done in music&quot;. &quot;Little Voice&quot; was written by DioGuardi and Patrik Berger for Swedish singer Sahlene.

After Recke chose the songs, DioGuardi had the task of rewriting some of the song&#x27;s lyrics to make them more appropriate for Duff&#x27;s demographic. According to Recke: &quot;Kara got [it]. It morphed into this really cool creative relationship that Hilary and Kara developed. What I always loved about Kara was she wrote like an artist, not as a typical songwriter. I think that&#x27;s what really connected with Hilary.&quot; Duff herself credits DioGuardi as helping her find her &quot;voice&quot;.

Duff loved the recording process of &quot;Come Clean&quot;, having a &quot;good time&quot; in the studio with Shanks, who produced the song. According to Duff, he was &quot;really, really, really great&quot; about making her feel comfortable in the studio. DioGuardi&#x27;s idea for the vocals on &quot;Little Voice&quot; were &quot;very, very character—it was one of those songs that&#x27;s more about the character of the vocal as opposed to being a more straight-to-the-middle kind of vocal performance&quot;. According to Bennett, the song&#x27;s producer, &quot;it was kind of an acting job as opposed to a more traditional approach&quot; for Duff.

&quot;Inner Strength&quot; was an &quot;awesome experience&quot; for Duff, as it was the first time that she and her sister Haylie wrote together. Writing with Haylie was a &quot;specific comfort place&quot; for her at the time, as her life had been changing &quot;so fast and so quickly&quot;. According to Duff, &quot;it was kind of scary and a lot of times I felt alone or criticized&quot;. Haylie used to write a lot of poetry and when she was 16 she wrote a poem about sweet sixteen. She read it for my family and Duff suggested that they make it into a song, which became &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot;.

Christy found writing the songs for Duff as &quot;really fun and easy&quot;. The Matrix had just completed their work with Avril Lavigne on her debut studio album, &quot;Let Go&quot; (2002) at the time, so they were &quot;in that zone&quot;. The Matrix knew that they had a hit on their hands as soon as they began working on &quot;So Yesterday&quot;. When Duff heard the song for the first time, she was very unsure about it. Despite her reluctance to do the song, she recorded it and once Hollywood Records heard it, &quot;everybody started sort of freaking out&quot;. She later recalled, in August 2013, that it was not one of her favorite songs, but that it &quot;definitely grew on [her]&quot;. Christy recalled the process of working with Duff as being &quot;too easy&quot;. She cited Duff as &quot;just a professional&quot; and that the one thing that she remembers the most from working on &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; was that Duff is a &quot;real worker&quot;. According to Christy, &quot;Where Did I Go Right?&quot; and &quot;So Yesterday&quot; are among her favorite songs that she has ever written.

As she had already worked with Midnight in the past, he already knew what &quot;she wanted to talk about and what she was going through at that time&quot;. For &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, Bennett, Midnight and Duff had discussions about &quot;all these changes that were going on&quot; in her life. Bennett wrote the track and then got together with Midnight to compose the lyrics and the melody. Duff had only a couple of days to record the vocals for &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, as she was also working on a film at the time. As Bennett was putting the song together he realized that he had a &quot;different spin on the melody&quot;, so Duff went back into the studio to &quot;lay down a different melody&quot; for the chorus at the last minute. Duff&#x27;s &quot;really strong work ethic&quot; greatly impressed Bennett.

== Composition ==

Duff described the album as &quot;pop music [that] has some more rock and edginess to it&quot;; she said the type of music was &quot;somewhere in between&quot; pop and &quot;hardcore rock&quot;, but that she did not know how to explain it. According to her, there is &quot;a lot of different music&quot; on &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; that she finds difficult to categorize. The music on the album is &quot;a little different&quot; from her previous music because, according to her, the album &quot;has all the kinds of music I like to listen to&quot;. She said that there are many &quot;different sounds&quot; on the album, such as rock and electronic, and &quot;a whole range&quot; of tempos, including &quot;deep, slow&quot; tracks and &quot;high-energy&quot; songs to provide her with a &quot;boost&quot;. According to Duff, everyone experiences varied feelings and moods, and they can &quot;feel a bit better&quot; by playing their favorite song.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine described the album as &quot;a slick collection of pop songs, master-crafted to appeal to huge numbers of young people&quot;. Duff told the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; in 2005 she was under the control of the record label during the making of &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; and her third album, &quot;Hilary Duff&quot; (2004), and could not incorporate the sound she wanted into her recordings. She said the production &quot;[had] been mastered and sounds really pretty ... If I could change it, I would, and it would sound [less pop]. My name is Hilary Duff, and I don&#x27;t know why I don&#x27;t get to make Hilary Duff music.&quot;

Duff said the album represented &quot;kind of a change&quot; because it was &quot;kind of different&quot; from anything she had previously done; as she put it, &quot;We called the album &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; because it&#x27;s about changes that everybody experiences&quot;. Duff called change &quot;a very important and natural thing&quot;, saying that the album was a good way to introduce everyone to &quot;the real me&quot; because, in her words, &quot;Everyone evolves and changes&quot;. She said she was &quot;excited&quot; about &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; because it represented her rather than characters she played: &quot;It&#x27;s more personal than acting&quot;, she said; however, she said that the album was &quot;not just about me&quot;. Duff said she believed her music provided a way for people to get to disassociate her from her Lizzie McGuire persona, a goal she said was &quot;so important to me&quot;. She described it as &quot;definitely stuff that everybody my age can relate to&quot;. She characterized the recording process as &quot;cool&quot; because the songs are strongly related to her personal life.

The album opens with its lead single &quot;So Yesterday,&quot; that according to Duff is an empowering song about breaking up with someone and getting over it. The song, that incorporates elements of pop and rock music, was cited as having influences of Avril Lavigne. The second song on the album, and second single, &quot;Come Clean&quot; documents a relationship between a boy and a girl who feel they are &quot;in the dark&quot; about each other; in Duff&#x27;s words: &quot;they&#x27;re coming clean, whether it means they&#x27;re gonna be together or not.&quot; &quot;Little Voice,&quot; a cover of the 2000 single &quot;The Little Voice&quot; by Swedish recording artist Sahlene, is the album&#x27;s third single. The song speaks of having a conversation with ones conscience. &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; is a song by Haylie Duff described as being &quot;a really fun song that totally relates to [her] life right now.&quot; The album&#x27;s title track &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; is a song about &quot;getting over a boy.&quot; Duff insisted the song was not about fellow singer and ex-boyfriend Aaron Carter, with whom she was rumored to have broken up after a fight. &quot;Inner Strength,&quot; another contribution of Haylie Duff, is described by as &quot;very empowering and uplifting&quot; and &quot;really beautiful&quot;. The final song on the album, &quot;Why Not,&quot; was previously released on the soundtrack for &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot;, a film in which Duff starred.

== Release and promotion ==
&quot;Metamorphosis&quot; was released in North America on August 26, 2003. Its CD+DVD deluxe editions were released in Japan and Australia in 2004. During the period in which &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; was released, Duff was participating in many projects in film, brand licensing, music and television; &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote in July 2003 that she was emerging as &quot;The Next Big Thing&quot; and &quot;a marketing powerhouse&quot; with nine to twelve year-olds, and &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine said that she &quot;is looking to become more than just the nation&#x27;s next teen pop princess. She wants to become a brand-name phenomenon ... [&quot;Metamorphosis&quot;] is just the beginning.&quot; These projects included the high-profile Hollywood films &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (2003) and &quot;A Cinderella Story&quot; (2004), a clothing and accessories line called Stuff by Hilary Duff, a &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; merchandise line, and a Visa prepaid credit card for children aged six to thirteen. She also participated in a marketing campaign for the Hasbro personal video player VideoNow, for which she filmed the video &quot;A Day in the Life of Hilary Duff&quot;, which included a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the &quot;Why Not&quot; music video. Entertainment lawyer Larry Golring called it &quot;a great cross-promotion&quot; for VideoNow and Duff&#x27;s music career, which he said were &quot;two new brands that are going to be huge this time next year, and they hopefully will have helped each other get there&quot;. The Associated Press quoted Bob Cavallo, the chairman of Buena Vista Music Group, as saying that &quot;At this point, she&#x27;s obviously already a franchise&quot;.

Marketing people such as Laura Groppe, president of Girls Intelligence Agency, said that the timing of the release of &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; and other Duff-related products was right because there had been a lack of teen idols since Britney Spears, and that Duff &quot;[is] not too pretty. Not too thin. Not too anything ... like a little Meg Ryan.&quot; According to Marketing Evaluations/TvQ, Duff was, in July 2003, the female star most popular with kids aged between six and eleven. Amy Doyle, at MTV&#x27;s vice president of music programming, said Duff was &quot;definitely one of the hot people to watch ... She&#x27;s become the fabric of pop culture with teens right now.&quot; There was concern from some, however, that Duff could become overexposed, although Duff&#x27;s manager emphasized his selectiveness against &quot;[i]f something looks cheesy&quot;, and that Duff &quot;doesn&#x27;t want to be all over TV commercials&quot;. Others, such as Robert Thorne, the CEO of the Olsen twins&#x27; Dualstar Entertainment, said that Duff should have stayed with The Walt Disney Company — from which she separated after contract negotiations broke down — to build the &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; franchise and use it to help develop her career into adulthood. In spite of this split, the profile of Duff and the album was supported by the DVD release of &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot; and reruns of &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; episodes on the Disney Channel for two seasons. Duff herself said that &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; was &quot;a great place to begin my career&quot;, but said that &quot;it&#x27;s exciting to go out on my own&quot; with &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;.

Before the release of the album, and beginning in July 2003, Duff and &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; were given substantial promotional support from MTV, which highlighted &quot;So Yesterday&quot; on &quot;Making the Video&quot; and &quot;Total Request Live&quot;; Duff co-hosted the special &quot;TRL&#x27;s All-Star Backyard BBQ&quot;. &quot;So Yesterday&quot; was released to U.S. Top 40 radio in mid-July, after which it became the &quot;most added&quot; song on the format. On the internet AOL Music had a marketing relationship with Duff and &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;: it hosted the premiere of &quot;So Yesterday&quot; and recording a Sessions@AOL broadcast with her, among other content exclusive to AOL members. In late September The WB Television Network aired an hour-long Hilary Duff birthday special, and MTV aired an episode of the documentary series &quot;Diary&quot; that followed Duff through a day. A DVD containing music videos, performance and behind-the-scenes footage and bonus features, &quot;Hilary Duff: All Access Pass&quot;, was released in November.

Duff embarked on a four-week concert tour in the U.S. from November to early December 2003. The song &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; was included on the soundtrack of the film &quot;A Cinderella Story&quot;; Duff promoted the film and &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; with a series of television appearances in July 2004, including one on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. She performed before roughly 7,000 people, breaking a &quot;Good Morning America&quot; audience record. In the same period she embarked on a U.S. summer tour, during which she performed a one-hour set that included &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; tracks, covers of The Go-Go&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; and The Who&#x27;s &quot;My Generation&quot;, and previously unheard material from &quot;Hilary Duff&quot;. Haylie Duff was the opening act on the tour, which ran for thirty-six dates and sold well in major arenas; &quot;Pollstar&quot; editor-in-chief said that there was &quot;a real positive buzz about ticket sales for Hilary&#x27;s show&quot;. The tour was involved with the charity Kids with a Cause, of which Duff was a charter member in 1999; it sponsored a &quot;Food for a Friend&quot; drive and encouraged attendees to bring canned food to each tour venue, where the cans were collected and distributed across shelters in each city through which Duff toured. By early August 2004, enough food had been amassed to feed more than 12,000 children. The success of the tour was credited with helping keep the teen pop market alive in the tour circuit, and for being one of the &quot;bright spots&quot; in a slow concert season.

=== Singles ===
&quot;So Yesterday&quot; was released as the lead single from the album on July 29, 2003. The song, written by Lauren Christy, Scott Spock, Graham Edwards and Charlie Midnight, was produced by production team The Matrix, who were notable at the time for their work with Avril Lavigne. Thus, some similarities arose between the song and the work of Lavigne. &quot;So Yesterday&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at number fifty-three in the thirty-third week of 2003, and peaked at number forty-two in its eleventh week. It spent twenty weeks on the Hot 100. The song topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Singles Sales chart, making Duff the first artist in four months not affiliated with &quot;American Idol&quot;, to top the chart. The song peaked at number two in Canadian Singles Chart. In Australia the song debuted at number thirty-nine, peaked at number eight in its eighth week, and remained on the chart for twenty weeks. It was the forty-ninth best selling single of 2003 in Australia, and was certified platinum in 2004. In Japan, the song reached number 199 on the Oricon weekly charts. In United Kingdom, the song debuted at number nine on the UK Singles Chart. The song peaked in the top ten on the charts in other European countries such as the Netherlands and France. The Chris Applebaum-directed music video for the song premiered on MTV on July 24, 2003. It was later featured on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Making the Video&quot; two days after the video&#x27;s premiere on July 26, 2003. The video shows Duff playing a break-up prank on her aloof boyfriend.

&quot;Come Clean&quot; was released as the second single from the album on January 13, 2004. Duff described the song as being &quot;obviously about a boy and a girl&#x27;s relationship and it&#x27;s just talking about how somebody thinks they&#x27;re in the dark.&quot; &quot;She&#x27;s tired of it and he&#x27;s tired of it and they&#x27;re coming clean, whether it means they&#x27;re gonna be together or not. They&#x27;re laying all the cards out on the table and coming out with everything that hasn&#x27;t been said basically.&quot;, she said. Duff cited the song as her favorite on &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, saying it is &quot;a little more mellow&quot; than her previous single, &quot;So Yesterday&quot;, &quot;but it&#x27;s not really pop. It sounds sort of like techno, but it&#x27;s slow. It&#x27;s really cool.&quot; The song peaked at number thirty five, becoming Duff&#x27;s first top forty single in the US and also her highest charting single at the time. However, the song failed to match the success of its predecessor &quot;So Yesterday&quot; in many other countries. It reached a peak of number seventeen in Australia and eighteen in the UK, while charting inside top twenty in Canada, Netherlands, Ireland and New Zealand. The accompanying music video, directed by Dave Meyers, premiered on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; on January 14, 2004. The video showed Duff inside a house on a rainy day, waiting for her love interest. The video was nominated for Best Pop Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards.

&quot;Little Voice&quot; was released as the third and final single from the album on June 15, 2004, only internationally. The song is a cover of the 2000 song &quot;The Little Voice&quot; by Swedish recording artist Sahlene, written by Kara DioGuardi and Patrik Berger. The new version by Duff featured slightly different lyrics and was produced by Chico Bennett and DioGuardi. The song peaked at number twenty-nine in Australia. The music video for the song is a live performance taken from &quot;The Girl Can Rock&quot; Tour DVD.

== Critical reception ==
Bob Cavallo said he expected the album to sell &quot;a couple of million [copies] ... [i]f the pixie dust flies the right way&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote the album, &quot;is what teen pop &quot;should&quot; sound like in 2003... a very good modern bubblegum album&quot;; he said that it was influenced by Avril Lavigne but that Duff &quot;has a sweeter, more appealing voice than Avril, and the rest of the record follows her cheerful charisma, resulting in a charmingly effervescent listen&quot;. However, &quot;Slant&quot; magazine said that Duff &quot;has decided to ride the Avril wave&quot; and noted that, like Lavigne, Duff enlisted The Matrix to produce and write some of the tracks. &quot;Blender&quot; magazine called it &quot;a masterfully executed tour through contempo mall-pop, &#x27;80s new-wave bubblegum and girl-power affirmations&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot; named it the tenth worst pop album of 2003, writing &quot;Note to all young, modestly talented singers: Stay in school and you won&#x27;t wind up on worst-of lists before you&#x27;re old enough to vote.&quot;

&quot;Metamorphosis&quot; was nominated at the Juno Awards of 2004 for International Album of the Year, but lost to 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot;. Duff won in the Best New Artist category at the 2004 World Music Awards and Favorite Female Artist at the 2004 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, on top of that &quot;Come Clean&quot; was nominated for a MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video. Duff also won a TMF award for the &quot;Fake ID Award&quot; category.

== Commercial performance ==
The album debuted at number two on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (behind Mary J. Blige&#x27;s &quot;Love &amp; Life&quot;) with 203,000 copies sold in its first week of release. Despite a 30% sales drop in its second week, during which it sold 131,000 copies, &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; peaked at number one on the chart for that week. It was certified platinum by the RIAA in three months, and two times platinum by the end of the year. In late November/early December, after Duff had appeared at the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade and sneak previews of the film &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; were held in select cities, &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; returned to the top five on the albums chart with a 132% sales increase over the previous week with 224,000 copies. In the Christmas shopping week, when the album was at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it sold 275,000 copies. It was the eighth best selling album of 2003 according to Nielsen SoundScan, selling 2.6 million copies, and it was certified four times platinum in October 2023. By September 2004, the album had sold 3.4 million copies in the United States. In August 2005, the release month of Duff&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Most Wanted&quot;, the album re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In Canada, the album reached the top spot in its first week of release. It was certified platinum four months after its release for sales of 100,000, and in December 2004 it was certified quadruple platinum for sales exceeding 500,000 copies. In Australia, the album was certified platinum for sales of 70,000; it was number seventy-four on the ARIA year-end chart. &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; debuted at number twenty-six in France, and peaked at number twenty-two a week later, remaining on the chart for thirty-nine weeks. As of July 27, 2014, the album has sold 3,961,000 million copies in the United States and more than 5 million copies worldwide. It is her best selling album to date.

==Legacy==
&quot;Metamorphosis&quot; was credited with helping to significantly raise the industry and corporate profile and marketplace presence of Hollywood Records, which Geoff Mayfield, charts director and senior analyst for &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, said &quot;[have] had some top albums before with the &quot;Tarzan&quot; movie soundtrack in 2000, but not like this Hilary Duff album&quot;. The &quot;San Fernando Valley Business Journal&quot; wrote that the album was &quot;giving Hollywood Records a needed shot in the arm&quot; after a decline in CD sales during the previous two years had forced the label to reduce costs and alter its operation. Hilliard Lyons analyst Jeffrey Thomison said &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; was a reflection of Disney&#x27;s ability to develop &quot;great synergy between their cable, film and music segments&quot;, particularly after &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot; indicated that Duff&#x27;s television fanbase could be migrated to film. Geoff Mayfield said on the subject, &quot;All things being equal, if this album were done by anybody else, it would not be a hit&quot;. &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; made Duff the first &quot;breakout artist&quot; for Hollywood Records in its ten-year history, and its success coincided with that of albums by other artists on the label, such as Rascal Flatts and Josh Kelley, and of soundtracks for films such as &quot;The Cheetah Girls&quot;, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; and &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot;. Later, partly as a result of &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, Hollywood Records used the Disney Channel to launch brands such as &quot;High School Musical&quot; and &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;, and artists such as Aly &amp; AJ, The Cheetah Girls, &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; star Miley Cyrus, Raven-Symoné, Vanessa Hudgens and Jesse McCartney.

&quot;Blender&quot; magazine wrote that the success of the album consolidated Duff&#x27;s status as a &quot;tween icon&quot;, and estimated that it had earned her US$5,000,000. Moreover, sales of &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; indicated that Duff&#x27;s popularity with teenagers was rising — 70% of buyers were aged between thirteen and twenty-two, compared to the soundtrack for &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot;, 70% of the buyers of which were below the age of thirteen. Bob Cavallo attributed the album&#x27;s success to Duff&#x27;s amassing of fans of the singers and former Disney &quot;Mouseketeers&quot; Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.

<text>A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task.

The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.

== Overview ==
Flowcharts are used to design and document simple processes or programs. Like other types of diagrams, they help visualize the process. Two of the many benefits are flaws and bottlenecks may become apparent. Flowcharts typically use the following main symbols:

* A process step, usually called an &quot;activity&quot;, is denoted by a rectangular box.
* A decision is usually denoted by a diamond.
A flowchart is described as &quot;cross-functional&quot; when the chart is divided into different vertical or horizontal parts, to describe the control of different organizational units. A symbol appearing in a particular part is within the control of that organizational unit. A cross-functional flowchart allows the author to correctly locate the responsibility for performing an action or making a decision, and to show the responsibility of each organizational unit for different parts of a single process.

Flowcharts represent certain aspects of processes and are usually complemented by other types of diagram. For instance, Kaoru Ishikawa defined the flowchart as one of the seven basic tools of quality control, next to the histogram, Pareto chart, check sheet, control chart, cause-and-effect diagram, and the scatter diagram. Similarly, in UML, a standard concept-modeling notation used in software development, the activity diagram, which is a type of flowchart, is just one of many different diagram types.

Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams and Drakon-charts are an alternative notation for process flow.

Common alternative names include: flow chart, process flowchart, functional flowchart, process map, process chart, functional process chart, business process model, process model, process flow diagram, work flow diagram, business flow diagram. The terms &quot;flowchart&quot; and &quot;flow chart&quot; are used interchangeably.

The underlying graph structure of a flowchart is a flow graph, which abstracts away node types, their contents and other ancillary information.

== History ==
The first structured method for documenting process flow, the &quot;flow process chart&quot;, was introduced by Frank and Lillian Gilbreth in the presentation &quot;Process Charts: First Steps in Finding the One Best Way to do Work&quot;, to members of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 1921. The Gilbreths&#x27; tools quickly found their way into industrial engineering curricula. In the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, Allan H. Mogensen began to train business people in the use of some of the tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in Lake Placid, New York.

Art Spinanger, a 1944 graduate of Mogensen&#x27;s class, took the tools back to Procter and Gamble where he developed their Deliberate Methods Change Program. Ben S. Graham, another 1944 graduate, Director of Formcraft Engineering at Standard Register Industrial, applied the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi-flow process chart, to present multiple documents and their relationships. In 1947, ASME adopted a symbol set derived from Gilbreth&#x27;s original work as the &quot;ASME Standard: Operation and Flow Process Charts.&quot;

Douglas Hartree in 1949 explained that Herman Goldstine and John von Neumann had developed a flowchart (originally, diagram) to plan computer programs. His contemporary account was endorsed by IBM engineers and by Goldstine&#x27;s personal recollections. The original programming flowcharts of Goldstine and von Neumann can be found in their unpublished report, &quot;Planning and coding of problems for an electronic computing instrument, Part II, Volume 1&quot; (1947), which is reproduced in von Neumann&#x27;s collected works.

The flowchart became a popular tool for describing computer algorithms, but its popularity decreased in the 1970s, when interactive computer terminals and third-generation programming languages became common tools for computer programming, since algorithms can be expressed more concisely as source code in such languages. Often pseudo-code is used, which uses the common idioms of such languages without strictly adhering to the details of a particular one. Also, flowcharts are not well-suited for new programming techniques such as recursive programming.

Nevertheless, flowcharts were still used in the early 21st century for describing computer algorithms. Some techniques such as UML activity diagrams and Drakon-charts can be considered to be extensions of the flowchart.

== Types ==

Sterneckert (2003) suggested that flowcharts can be modeled from the perspective of different user groups (such as managers, system analysts and clerks), and that there are four general types: 
* &quot;Document flowcharts&quot;, showing controls over a document-flow through a system
* &quot;Data flowcharts&quot;, showing controls over a data-flow in a system
* &quot;System flowcharts&quot;, showing controls at a physical or resource level
* &quot;Program flowchart&quot;, showing the controls in a program within a system
Notice that every type of flowchart focuses on some kind of control, rather than on the particular flow itself.

However, there are some different classifications. For example, Andrew Veronis (1978) named three basic types of flowcharts: the &quot;system flowchart&quot;, the &quot;general flowchart&quot;, and the &quot;detailed flowchart&quot;. That same year Marilyn Bohl (1978) stated &quot;in practice, two kinds of flowcharts are used in solution planning: &quot;system flowcharts&quot; and &quot;program flowcharts&quot;...&quot;. More recently, Mark A. Fryman (2001) identified more differences: &quot;Decision flowcharts, logic flowcharts, systems flowcharts, product flowcharts, and process flowcharts are just a few of the different types of flowcharts that are used in business and government&quot;.

In addition, many diagram techniques are similar to flowcharts but carry a different name, such as UML activity diagrams.

Reversible flowcharts represent a paradigm in computing that focuses on the reversibility of computational processes. Unlike traditional computing models, where operations are often irreversible, reversible flowcharts ensure that any atomic computational step can be reversed. Reversible flowcharts are shown to be as expressive as reversible Turing machines, and are a theoretical foundation for structured reversible programming and energy-efficient reversible computing systems.

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) set standards for flowcharts and their symbols in the 1960s. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted the ANSI symbols in 1970. The current standard, ISO 5807, was published in 1985 and last reviewed in 2019. Generally, flowcharts flow from top to bottom and left to right.


=== Other symbols ===
The ANSI/ISO standards include symbols beyond the basic shapes. Some are:
=== Parallel processing ===
*&quot;Parallel Mode&quot; is represented by two horizontal lines at the beginning or ending of simultaneous operations

For parallel and concurrent processing the &quot;Parallel Mode&quot; horizontal lines or a horizontal bar indicate the start or end of a section of processes that can be done independently:
* At a &quot;fork&quot;, the process creates one or more additional processes, indicated by a bar with one incoming path and two or more outgoing paths. 
* At a &quot;join&quot;, two or more processes continue as a single process, indicated by a bar with several incoming paths and one outgoing path. All processes must complete before the single process continues.

== Diagramming software ==

Any drawing program can be used to create flowchart diagrams, but these will have no underlying data model to share data with databases or other programs such as project management systems or spreadsheet. Many software packages exist that can create flowcharts automatically, either directly from a programming language source code, or from a flowchart description language.

There are several applications and visual programming languages that use flowcharts to represent and execute programs. Generally these are used as teaching tools for beginner students.

<text>The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) is the highest court in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Although the claim is disputed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the SJC claims the distinction of being the oldest continuously functioning appellate court in the Americas, with a recognized history dating to the establishment of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature in 1692 under the charter of the Province of Massachusetts Bay.

Although it was historically composed of four associate justices and one chief justice, the court is currently composed of six associate justices and one chief justice.

==History==
The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court traces its history back to the high court of the British Province of Massachusetts Bay, which was chartered in 1692. Under the terms of that charter, Governor Sir William Phips established the Superior Court of Judicature as the province&#x27;s local court of last resort (some of the court&#x27;s decisions could be appealed to courts in England). When the Massachusetts State Constitution was established in 1780, legislative and judicial records show that the state&#x27;s high court, although renamed, was a continuation of provincial high court. During and after the period of the American Revolution the court had members who were appointed by royal governors, the executive council of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress (which acted as the state&#x27;s executive from 1775 to 1780), and governors elected under the state constitution.

==Location and citation==
The SJC sits at the John Adams Courthouse, One Pemberton Square, Boston, Massachusetts 02108, which also houses the Massachusetts Appeals Court and the Social Law Library. The legal citation for the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is &quot;Mass.&quot;

==Landmark cases==
* &quot;Rex v. Preston&quot; (1770) – Captain Thomas Preston, the Officer of the Day during the Boston Massacre, was acquitted when the jury was unable to determine whether he had ordered the troops to fire. The defense counsel in the case was a young attorney named John Adams, later the second President of the United States.
* &quot;Rex v. Wemms, et al.&quot; (1770) – Six soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre were found not guilty, and two morethe only two proven to have firedwere found guilty of manslaughter.
* &quot;Commonwealth v. Nathaniel Jennison&quot; (1783) – The Court declared slavery unconstitutional in the state of Massachusetts by allowing slaves to sue their masters for freedom. Boston lawyer, and member of the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1779, John Lowell, upon the adoption of Article I for inclusion in the Massachusetts Constitution, exclaimed: &quot;I will render my services as a lawyer gratis to any slave suing for his freedom if it is withheld from him ...&quot; With this case, he fulfilled his promise. Slavery in Massachusetts was denied legal standing.
* &quot;Commonwealth v. Hunt&quot; (1842) – The Court established that trade unions were not necessarily criminal or conspiring organizations if they did not advocate violence or illegal activities in their attempts to gain recognition through striking. This legalized the existence of non-socialist or non-violent trade organizations, though trade unions would continue to be harassed legally through anti-trust suits and injunctions.
* &quot;Roberts v. Boston&quot; (1850) – The Court established the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine that would later be used in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; by maintaining that the law gave school boards complete authority in assigning students to schools and that they could do so along racial lines if they deemed it appropriate.
* &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot; (2003) – The Court ruled 4–3 that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples violated the Massachusetts Constitution. The decision was stayed for 180 days to allow the legislature time to amend the law to comply with the decision. In December 2003, the state Senate asked the SJC whether &quot;civil unions&quot; would comply with their ruling. The SJC replied that civil unions were insufficient, and civil marriage was required. The legislature made no further action, and the stay expired on May 17, 2004. The state began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples the same day. This decision was one of the first in the world to find that same-sex couples have a right to marry.

==Composition==
The Court consists of a Chief Justice and six Associate Justices appointed by the Governor of Massachusetts with the consent of the Governor&#x27;s Council.

The Justices hold office until the mandatory retirement age of seventy, like all other Massachusetts judges since 1972.

===Current composition===


===Notable members===
* William Cushing, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1790–1810)
*Charles Devens, United States Attorney General (1877–81)
*Charles Fried, United States Solicitor General (1985–89)
*Horace Gray, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1882–1902)
*Ebenezer R. Hoar, United States Attorney General (1869–70)
*Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1902–32)
*Lemuel Shaw, Chief Justice, father-in-law of Herman Melville
*Theophilus Parsons, Federalist leader, Constitutional scholar

<doc id="527471" wikidata="Q499802" url="?curid=527471" title="Mammillary body">
<text>The mammillary bodies also mamillary bodies, are a pair of small round brainstem nuclei. They are located on the undersurface of the brain that, as part of the diencephalon, form part of the limbic system. They are located at the ends of the anterior arches of the fornix. They consist of two groups of nuclei, the medial mammillary nuclei and the lateral mammillary nuclei.

Neuroanatomists have often categorized the mammillary bodies as part of the posterior part of hypothalamus.

== Structure ==

===Connections===
They are connected to other parts of the brain (as shown in the schematic, below left), and act as a relay for impulses coming from the amygdalae and hippocampi, via the mamillothalamic tract to the thalamus.

The lateral mammillary nucleus has bidirectional connections with the dorsal tegmental nucleus. The medial mammillary nucleus connects with the ventral tegmental nucleus.

== Function ==

Mammillary bodies, and their projections to the anterior thalamus via the mammillothalamic tract, are important for recollective memory. According to studies of rats with mammillary body lesions, damage to the medial mammillary nucleus lead to spatial memory deficits.

==Clinical significance==
Damage to the mammillary bodies due to thiamine deficiency is implied in pathogenesis of Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. Symptoms include impaired memory, also called anterograde amnesia, suggesting that the mammillary bodies may be important for memory. Lesions of the medial dorsal and anterior nuclei of the thalami and lesions of the mammillary bodies are commonly involved in amnesic syndromes in humans.

Mammillary body atrophy is present in several other conditions, such as colloid cysts in the third ventricle, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, schizophrenia, heart failure, and sleep apnea. In spite of this the exact function of the mammillary bodies is still not clear.

<doc id="527492" wikidata="Q7276691" url="?curid=527492" title="RG color models">
<text>An RG color model is a dichromatic color model represented by red and green primary colors. These can only reproduce a fraction of the colors possible with a trichromatic color space, such as for human color vision. 

The name of the model comes from the initials of the two primary colors: red and green. The model may be either additive or subtractive. 

It was used to display 3D images using anaglyphs since the 1850s. Despite its shortcomings in color reproduction, the RG model was used in early color processes for films from 1906 to 1929 (Kinemacolor, Prizma, Technicolor, Brewster Color, Kodachrome I and Raycol).

==Additive RG==
The additive RG color model uses red and green primaries. It was used in several processes during the early innovations of color photography, including Kinemacolor, Prizma, Technicolor I, and Raycol.

The primaries are added together in varying proportions to reproduce a linear gamut of colors, which can reproduce only a fraction of the colors possible with a trichromatic color space.

The appearance of the color gamut changes depending on the primary colors chosen. When the primaries are complementary colors (e.g. red and cyan), then an equal mixture of the primaries will yield a neutral color (gray or white). However, since red and green are &quot;not&quot; complementary colors, an equal mixture of these primaries will yield yellow, and a neutral color cannot be reproduced by the color space.

Until recently, its primary use was in low-cost LED displays in which red and green LEDs were more common and cheaper than the still nascent blue LED technology. However, this preference no longer applies to modern devices. In modern applications, the red and green primaries are equal to the primaries used in typical RGB color spaces. In this case, the RG color model can be achieved by disabling the blue light source.

==Subtractive RG==
The subtractive RG color model uses red and green filters for film exposure, but complementary cyan-green (for red) and orange-red (for green) for the developed prints. This allows the generation of white, although the color model cannot achieve black, regardless of the primaries chosen. It was used in several processes during the early innovations of color photography, including on Brewster Color I, Kodachrome I, Prizma II, and Technicolor II.

== Subtractive RGK ==

A similar color model, called RGK adds a black channel, which allows for the reproduction of black and other dark shades. However, it does not allow the reproduction of neutral colors (gray/white) because the primaries are not complementary.

Outside of a few low-cost high-volume applications, such as packaging and labelling, RG and RGK are no longer in use because devices providing larger gamuts such as CMYK are in widespread use.

==Anaglyph 3D==

In 1858, in France, delivered a report to l&#x27;Académie des sciences describing how to project three-dimensional magic lantern slide shows using red and green filters to an audience wearing red and green goggles. Subsequently he was chronicled as being responsible for the first realisation of 3D images using anaglyphs.

<doc id="527498" wikidata="Q5286034" url="?curid=527498" title="Do I Hear a Waltz?">
<text>Do I Hear a Waltz? is a musical with a book by Arthur Laurents, music by Richard Rodgers, and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. It was adapted from Laurents&#x27; 1952 play &quot;The Time of the Cuckoo&quot;, which was the basis for the 1955 film &quot;Summertime&quot; starring Katharine Hepburn.

==Background==
Laurents originally conceived the production as a small chamber musical with music by Richard Rodgers, lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein, and Mary Martin in the lead role of spinster Leona Samish. By the time the project began to jell, however, Hammerstein had died, and Stephen Sondheim was asked by Laurents and Mary Rodgers, Richard Rodgers&#x27; daughter, to write the lyrics. Even so, Rodgers felt that the original play did not lend itself to musicalization; Sondheim agreed. According to Peter Filichia, &quot;Sondheim didn&#x27;t want to do the musical in the first place, but given that Laurents sought him – and had recommended him for &#x27;West Side Story&#x27; when he was a novice — he accepted. Also a factor was that his now-deceased mentor Oscar Hammerstein had recommended that he succeed him as Rodgers&#x27; lyricist.&quot;

Rodgers, who was producing the Broadway production, rejected Martin as too old for Leona.

Franco Zeffirelli was the first choice for director, and he met with Laurents, Sondheim, and Rodgers, who fell asleep during their discussion. Laurents suspected Rodgers had been drinking, and when he discovered a bottle of vodka secreted in the toilet tank during a later visit to the Rodgers apartment, he realized he had been correct. The composer&#x27;s chronic drinking proved to be a major problem throughout the rehearsal period and pre-Broadway run at the Colonial Theatre in Boston and the Shubert Theatre in New Haven.

Laurents suggested that John Dexter direct the show, but later regretted the choice. Dexter insisted on giving the lead role of Leona to Elizabeth Allen, who Laurents felt could manage the acting and singing but had a cold personality too contrary to that of the character. Rodgers&#x27; mistreatment of Sondheim left the lyricist feeling apathetic if not outright sour about the project, but he maintained his professionalism. The first run-through was disastrous, and Dexter immediately lost interest, leaving most of the work to his assistant-choreographer Wakefield Poole. Herbert Ross was called in to work on the dance routines and brought with him his wife Nora Kaye, who served as a mediator among the warring factions. She was faced with an arduous task, given Rodgers&#x27; open dismissal of Sondheim&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;shit,&quot; as well as his eventual ban of Laurents from rehearsals completely.

==Synopsis==
New York City secretary Leona Samish arrives in Venice (&quot;Someone Woke Up&quot;), where she is staying at the Pensione Fioria, where she is greeted by owner Fioria (&quot;This Week Americans&quot;). There she meets Americans Eddie and Jennifer Yaeger, who are living in Rome and have come to Venice for a vacation, and the McIlhennys, an older couple on a package tour (&quot;What Do We Do? We Fly!&quot;).

While shopping, Leona sees a ruby glass goblet in a store window and goes inside to inspect it. The owner, Renato di Rossi, tells her it is an authentic 18th-century piece, not a reproduction. He offers not only to find her a matching glass to make up a pair, but to show her the sights of the city, as well. Leona refuses his offer and leaves, but returns the next day to buy the goblet. Later that day, a package with a second goblet is delivered to the hotel. Soon after, Renato arrives to invite Leona to join him for coffee in Piazza San Marco that evening. When the McIlhennys show her their purchase of a set of glasses exactly like hers, Leona believes Renato misrepresented their value, but Signora Fioria assures her they are antiques.

Later in the day, Renato&#x27;s son Vito comes to tell Leona that Renato will be late for their meeting because one of his children is ill and needs to see a doctor. Realizing Renato is married, she cancels their rendezvous. He comes to the pensione and explains he and his wife have not loved each other for years but divorce is not an option, not only because the country does not permit it, but because they have their children to consider as well. To Leona, his casual attitude about extramarital affairs is wrong, but she still finds herself attracted to him, and agrees to keep their date.

Meanwhile, the Yaegers are facing problems of their own. Eddie, finding himself enamoured with Signora Fioria, announces he wants to put distance between himself and the woman by returning to the United States.

Renato arrives with a garnet necklace for Leona, who is thrilled with his gift and agrees to extend her stay in Venice. She hosts a party in the garden of the pensione, and as the party is in progress, Renato&#x27;s son Vito comes to tell his father that the jeweler wants his money; overhearing this, Leona happily gives him the money. However, when she discovers Renato has received a commission on the sale of the necklace, she accuses him of being interested only in her money, and he leaves.

Fioria and Jennifer attempt to comfort Leona, who drunkenly reveals Eddie and Fioria spent the previous evening together, only to immediately regret her words (&quot;Everyone Loves Leona&quot;). The following day both the Yaegers and the McIlhennys check out of the pensione as Fioria is happy that everyone is leaving and making way for the next group of guests (&quot;Last Week Americans&quot;). On hearing Renato had been there before she awoke, Leona goes to his store to make amends, but he tells her a relationship with her would be impossible because of her complicated outlook on life. His affection for her is gone, and they part as friends (&quot;Thank You So Much&quot;).

==Productions==
The musical opened on Broadway on March 18, 1965, at the 46th Street Theatre and closed on September 25, 1965, after 220 performances. Choreography was by Herbert Ross, with scenery and costumes by Beni Montresor and lighting by Jules Fisher. 
Laurents rued the casting - he felt Allen was too young and colorless and Franchi couldn&#x27;t act - and ignored all the ongoing problems in favor of making his dream a reality, but most of all he regretted the break in his friendship with Sondheim after the show.

The musical received three nominations for the Tony Awards: Elizabeth Allen was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical; nominated for Best Original Score; and nominated for Best Scenic Design, but lost in all three categories.

In May 1966, &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; made its regional theatrical debut at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee (Wisconsin): Dorothy Collins as Leona led a cast which also included Ron Holgate (Collins&#x27; husband) as Renato, Joel Fabiani as Eddie Yaeger. The production encored at the Paper Mill Playhouse in May–June 1966. Also in the summer of 1966 &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz&quot; made its West Coast premiere, with Anne Jeffreys as Leona leading the Valley Music Theater production in which Richard Torigi played Renato and Fleury D&#x27;Antonakis again played Giovanna.

Dorothy Collins would reprise her role of Leona in the summer of 1967 when &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; was presented by the St. Louis Municipal Opera, with a cast also including Fleury D&#x27;Antonakis (reprising her Broadway role as Giovanna), Clifford David (Eddie Yaeger), Enzo Stuarti (Renato), Monique van Vooren (Fioria) and Karin Wolfe (Jennifer Yaeger). With Holgate encoring as Renato opposite Collins as Leona, the production was scheduled for two subsequent Boston-area engagements of &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; that summer: however Collins&#x27; maternity leave mandated Julia Meade instead headlining those two engagements opposite Holgate. Also in the summer of 1967 Monique van Vooren encored as Fioria in the Kenley Players of Dayton (Ohio) production of &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; which starred Anita Bryant as Leona and featured Don Amendolia as Vito (Carol Bruce had originally been announced as encoring her Broadway role of Fioria for Kenley Players).

In the summer of 1972 Ronald Holgate again encored as Renato in a tour of &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; with Patrice Munsel headlining as Leona: also in the cast were Richard Kline (Eddie Yaeger) and Denise Lor (Fioria).

In March 1975 Rosalind Harris starred as Leona in a revival of &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; by the Equity Library Theatre of the New York [City] Public Library whose cast also included Melanie Chartoff (Jennifer Yaeger) and Barbara Lea (Fioria).

In 1997, Sondheim was sent a recording of a concert version of &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; that had been presented in London. It was then he realized the original play did lend itself to musical adaptation, but the score Rodgers composed wasn&#x27;t very good. He enthusiastically contacted Laurents and the two discussed changes that could be made to improve the show.

A revised production was staged at the George Street Playhouse, New Brunswick, New Jersey from October 13, 1999, through November 14, 1999. For this production the dropped song &quot;Everybody Loves Leona&quot; was restored, lyrics were altered or added, and Laurents &quot;revamped quite a bit of the book.&quot;

A 2001 revival of the musical was staged at the Pasadena Playhouse, Pasadena, California, where it ran from July 15 through August 19. The production was well received by the critics, and a cast recording was subsequently released on the Fynsworth Alley label.

In 2003, the Landor Theatre in London staged the musical and in March 2014, Charles Court Opera further revived the show at Park Theatre in Finsbury Park.

The musical was presented by Encores! at New York City Center in May 2016. It was directed by Evan Cabnet.

The 42nd Street Moon company of San Francisco has mounted two revivals of &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot;, the first in 1998 with Darren Criss as Mauro, the second in 2014 with Emily Skinner as Leona.

==Critical response==
The original production received mixed reviews. Howard Taubman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed,
: &quot;The authors ... have accomplished their conversion from the play with tact and grace. They have not attempted a complete transformation. On the other hand, they have not cheapened or falsified the play ... They were wise not to overload the musical with production numbers; their taste was unexceptionable when they chose not to turn their work into a brash, noisy affair, which would have been out of keeping with their theme. At the same time one cannot suppress a regret that they failed to be bolder: For there are times, particularly in the early stages, when the songs are merely a decoration. They give the impression that they are there because a musical requires music. They do not translate the story into the fresh and marvelous language that the rich resources of the musical stage make possible.&quot;

William Ruhlmann wrote:
: &quot;Despite the pedigrees of the creators, the show opened to negative reviews, which is explained only partly by the score as heard on this cast recording. Elizabeth Allen, in the lead role, was criticized with backhanded compliments for being too young and attractive for the part, flaws not apparent on the album. Sergio Franchi, as her romantic partner, also came in for criticism, but comes off much better here. And the small supporting cast, featuring Carol Bruce as the proprietor of a pension, is also impressive. But the songs, for the most part, are not memorable.&quot;

The production did not recoup its investment, but several songs, including the title song, received radio play. RCA released a single of two of the songs recorded by Sergio Franchi (&quot;Someone Like You&quot; and &quot;Take the Moment&quot;); and he sang them on several televised shows. Franchi generally received excellent reviews of his singing performance on this show, his Broadway debut.

== Post mortem ==
With the passage of time, Sondheim, the longest surviving member of the original creative team, reflected on what went wrong with &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; To begin with, his reasons for collaborating with Rodgers were prompted out of obligations to others rather than a belief in the material. In his final meeting with Hammerstein, the dying lyricist recommended that Sondheim collaborate with Rodgers. Additionally, Mary Rodgers (the composer&#x27;s daughter) was a good friend of Sondheim and forcefully urged him to consider a collaboration.

In getting to know Rodgers, Sondheim found a &quot;funny, dour, difficult fellow&quot; who was plagued with self-doubt, thinking that his musical abilities were failing him. This manifested itself in the composer&#x27;s adamant unwillingness to consider rewriting anything. Sondheim considered &quot;What Do We Do? We Fly&quot; and &quot;Bargaining&quot; to be repetitive songs – victims of the lack of desire to rewrite, a type of song he named &quot;mechanicals&quot;. Sondheim felt that Rodgers need not have been so self-doubting &quot;as songs like &#x27;Take the Moment&#x27; and the show&#x27;s title tune attest.&quot; Eventually Rodgers&#x27; self-doubt grew into paranoia, with Rodgers thinking that Sondheim and Arthur Laurents were plotting against him.

Optimistic at a chance to do something unusual, Sondheim thought that Leona – the lonely and uptight American – should not sing until the end of the show. Rodgers refused to consider such an innovation, bringing Sondheim to recognize that in the Rodgers and Hammerstein collaboration, it was Hammerstein that was the path breaker, because Rodgers was an &quot;archconservative&quot;, whose innovations were restricted to superficial gimmicks (for example, no string instruments in &quot;No Strings&quot;). Sondheim felt that Rodgers was not able to write a story in song so he ended up writing many of the lyrics first. Unlike his other partnerships in which composers responded with a collaborative give-and-take between lyrics and music, Sondheim felt that working with Rodgers was like &quot;a set of assignments, either from me to Rodgers or Rodgers to me.&quot;

One particular incident involved an infamous lyric change referring to a married couple in the song &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Be All-Right&quot;. Sondheim&#x27;s lyrics for the song tended to lean toward a more cynical view of marriage and his suggestion that the husband and wife might find consolation by having separate affairs, even a homosexual one, was quite revolutionary for 1965. He recalls, &quot;I wrote lyrics which had some bite to them, and Dick Rodgers thought the song was wonderful. Next day he called a lunch and kept slamming the lyrics against my forearm and saying, &#x27;This will not do, this will not do&#x27;, and I kept asking, &#x27;Why?&#x27; The truth was, he&#x27;d shown the lyrics to his wife and she did not like it. He probably showed it to her out of enthusiasm. But you know, it&#x27;s got stuff about sexuality in it.&quot;

Ultimately Sondheim understood the failure of &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; in the context of Mary Rodgers&#x27;s formulation of what she called a &quot;why? musical&quot;. Such a musical is usually based on good source material but raises the question as to what the addition of music does to enhance the original. With rare exceptions (Sondheim cited &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; as such an exception, because its creators loved and respected the story) &quot;why? musicals&quot; gain nothing from having music added, usually resulting in a dilution of the original material. Sondheim accepted responsibility for being naive: Thinking that his participation in &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; was a quick way to make money off of good source material – an effort that failed.

==Recordings==
The original cast recording was released by Columbia Records in 1965, and was chosen by &quot;Billboard&quot; as an Original Cast Spotlight Album. A remastered version was released on compact disc and cassette tape by Sony Broadway in 1992. A KeelanMusic review gives a very favorable review to the Original Cast recordings, irrespective of the Broadway criticisms.

The 13 March 1975 performance of the 1975 Equity Library production was recorded on audiocassette and is held in the Equity Library Theatre collection.

A recording of the Pasadena Playhouse production was released by Fynsworth Alley in 2001. Musical excerpts (not included on the original cast recording) include the overture, Lezione in Inglese, We&#x27;re Going to the Lido, Everybody Loves Leona.

<text>Gweilo or  (, pronounced ) is a common Cantonese slang term for Westerners. In the absence of modifiers, it refers to white people as White Devils and has a history of racially deprecatory and pejorative use. Cantonese speakers frequently use to refer to Westerners in general use, in a non-derogatory context, although whether this type of usage is offensive (i.e., an ethnic slur) is disputed by both Cantonese and Westerners.
==Etymology and history==
&quot;Gwái&quot; (, &quot;gui&quot; in Mandarin) means &quot;ghost&quot; or &quot;devil&quot;, and &quot;lóu&quot; () means &quot;man&quot; or &quot;guy&quot;. The literal translation of &quot;gwáilóu&quot; would thus be &quot;ghost man&quot; or &quot;devil man&quot;. It is sometimes translated into English as &quot;foreign devil&quot;. In many Sinitic languages, &quot;鬼&quot; gwai and its local equivalents can be a derogatory term used as a curse or an insult. The term &quot;鬼&quot; gwai has also been used to describe other ethnic groups, for example, a 17th-century writer from Canton, , wrote that Africans &quot;look like ghosts&quot;, and &quot;gwáinòuh&quot; () was once used to describe African slaves.

==Usage==
The term &quot;gwái&quot; () is an adjective that can be used to express hate and deprecation, an example being the locals&#x27; expression of their hatred towards the Japanese during their occupation of Hong Kong in World War II with the same &quot;gwái&quot;. It conveys a general bad and negative feeling but is a somewhat obsolete and archaic/old-fashioned term nowadays and other more modern terms have largely replaced &quot;gwái&quot; for similarly negative meanings. Cantonese people sometimes call each other &quot;sēui gwái&quot; (), which means &quot;bad person&quot;, though more often than not it is applied affectionately, similar to &quot;Hey, bitch!&quot; in English when used affectionately. Nowadays, Cantonese speakers often refer to non-Chinese people by their ethnicity.

&quot;Gwáilóu&quot; is often considered to be an acceptable generic racial term for Westerners. Also, some members of the Hong Kong community with European ancestry (particularly those with limited or zero Cantonese fluency) are indifferent to the term, and those who believe that the best way to defang a word intended as a &quot;slur&quot; is to embrace it, and use gweilo to refer to non-Chinese in Hong Kong. &quot;Gwailóu&quot; has, in some instances, been recognised as simply referring to white foreigners in South East Asia and now appears on Oxford Dictionaries defined as such, although non-white foreigners are not &quot;gwáilóu&quot;. While &quot;gwáilóu&quot; is used by some Cantonese speakers in informal speech, another alternative term the sound of which has several meanings &quot;sāi yàhn&quot; () is now used as well, particularly if the conversation involves a non-Chinese person. Homonyms - ie words that sound the same or almost the same depending on the tone - to &quot;sai yan&quot; include references to female genitalia or boasting so &quot;sai yan&quot; is not necessarily a polite alternative to &quot;gwai lou&quot;. A neutral alternative would be ‘foreign person’, pronounced &quot;ngoi gwok yan&quot;.

CFMT-TV in Toronto, Canada had a cooking show named &quot;Gwai Lo Cooking&quot; (1999) hosted by a Cantonese-speaking European chef, who was also the show&#x27;s producer and the person who named the show. According to CFMT-TV, &quot;Gwei Lo&quot; was used as &quot;a self-deprecating term of endearment&quot;. In response to some complaints, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council ruled that:

== Related terms ==
&quot;Gwai&quot; is one of a number of terms to referring to non-Chinese people that can be considered controversial and potentially offensive; a list of such terms is given below:

* gwaijai (; ) for a white boy.
* gwaimui (; ) for a white girl.
* gwaipo (; ) for white woman.
* baakgwai (; ) for white people.
* haakgwai (; ) for black people.
* sai yan (; ) for Westerners.
* yeung yan (; ) for Westerners.
* ngoigwok yan (; ) for foreign nationals.
* acha (; ; from &quot;acchā&quot; meaning &quot;good&quot; in Hindi) for South Asians. This term is considered offensive to South Asians local to Hong Kong, e.g., Hong Kong locals of Indian and/or Pakistani descent, and is not widely used. 
* molocha (; ) for South Asians.

=== Mandarin Chinese ===
&quot;Guizi&quot; (; ) is a Mandarin Chinese slang term for foreigners, and has a long history of being used as a racially deprecating insult.
* Riben guizi (; ) or dongyang guizi (; ) – used to refer to Japanese. 
* Er guizi (; ) – used to refer to the Korean soldiers who were a part of the Japanese army during the Sino-Japanese War in World War II.
* Yang guizi (; ) or xiyang guizi (; ) – used to refer to Westerners.

However, &quot;xiaogui&quot; (; ) is a common term in Mandarin Chinese for a child. Therefore, some argue that &quot;gui&quot; () in Mandarin is just a neutral word that describes something unexpected or hard to predict.

&quot;Laowai&quot; (; ) is the word most commonly used for foreigners and is a less pejorative term than &quot;guizi&quot;. Although &quot;laowai&quot; literally means &quot;old foreigner&quot;, depending on context, &quot;old&quot; can be both a term of endearment and one of criticism.

<text>Slovak literature is the literature of Slovakia.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
The first monuments of literature from territory now included in present-day Slovakia are from the time of Great Moravia (from 863 to the early 10th century). Authors from this period are Saint Cyril, Saint Methodius and Clement of Ohrid. Works from this period, mostly written on Christian topics include: the poem &quot;Proglas&quot; as a foreword to the four Gospels, partial translations of the Bible into Old Church Slavonic, &quot;Zakon sudnyj ljudem&quot;, etc.

The medieval period covers the span from the 11th to the 15th century. Literature in this period was written in Latin, Czech and slovakized Czech. Lyric poetry (prayers, songs and formulas) was still under the influence of the Church, while epic poetry concentrated on legends. Authors from this period include Johannes de Thurocz, author of the &quot;Chronica Hungarorum&quot;, and Maurus. Secular literature also emerged and chronicles were written in this period.

===1500–1650===
Literature of a national character first emerged in the 16th century, much later than for other national literatures. Latin dominated as the written language in the 16th century. Besides Church topics, there was a development of antique topics, related to ancient Greece and Rome.

The first Slovak language book printed in territory of today Slovakia is Bardejov Catechism of 1581.

An early Slovak Renaissance love poem is the anonymous epic &quot;Siládi and Hadmázi&quot; (1560), set against a background of the Turkish incursions into Central Europe.

Juraj Tranovský was sometimes called the father of Slovak hymnody and issued several collections of hymns, the first being the Latin &quot;Odarum Sacrarum sive Hymnorum Libri III&quot; in 1629, but his most important and most famous word was &quot;Cithara Sanctorum&quot; (Lyre of the Saints), written in Czech, which appeared in 1636 in Levoča. This latter volume has formed the basis of Czech and Slovak Lutheran hymnody to the present day. Against the background of the scarcity of Slovak literature, Tranovský&#x27;s Slovak hymns formed a source for raising national consciousness.

===1650–1780===
With the distinction between religious and secular literature that had started to develop in the Renaissance period, the religious conflicts in Slovakia during the Baroque period led to a clear division between sacred and profane.

Daniel Sinapius-Horčička wrote Latin poems and school dramas, religious prose, proverbs and select Slovak spiritual poetry. His prose displays national consciousness, lauding Slovak and criticizing the lack of patriotism among his fellow Slovaks.

Hugolín Gavlovič authored religious, moral, and educational writings in the contemporary West Slovak vernacular, and was a prominent representative of baroque literature in Slovakia. His most famous piece of work is &quot;Valašská škola, mravúv stodola&quot;, a work of 17,862 verses, as well as numerous versified couplet-marginalia.

===1780–1840===

Slovak Classicism was part of the larger European neo-Classicist movement of the Enlightenment. The rise of nationalism in the aftermath of the French Revolution gave rise to a national revival in literature. Until the mid-nineteenth century, Slovak was generally written in the form of Czech, with various degrees of Slovakization. Anton Bernolák&#x27;s &quot;Gramatica Slavika&quot; used a West Slovak dialect as the standard written form, a transitional step to modern literary Slovak, but ultimately a failure. Even so, significant works were published using Bernolák&#x27;s standards, beginning with Juraj Fándly&#x27;s 1879 &quot;Dúverná zmlúva medzi mňíchom a ďáblom&quot; (An intimate conversation between the monk and the Devil). Lutheran Slovaks like Augustin Dolezal, Juraj Palkovič and Pavel Jozef Šafárik tended to prefer a common Czech-Slovak identity and language.

The first Hungarian newspaper &quot;Magyar Hirmondó&quot; was published in Pressburg (Bratislava) in 1780, followed in 1783 by the first Slovak newspaper, a short-lived periodical, &quot;Prešpurské Noviny&quot; in 1783.
Jozef Ignác Bajza is best known for his novel &quot;René mláďenca príhodi a skúsenosťi&quot; (original, modern spelling René mládenca príhody a skúsenosti – 1784), which was the first novel written in Slovak.

Pan-Slavic unity served as the template for many poems of this period. Ján Kollár&#x27;s collection of 150 poems, &quot;Slávy Dcera&quot;, glorifies pan-Slavic ideals in three cantos named after the Saale, Elbe and Danube. Jan Holly&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Svätopluk&quot;, published in 1833, serves as the most significant text of the period.

===1840–1871===
Ľudovít Štúr was the leader of the Slovak national revival in the 19th century, the creator of standard Slovak, eventually leading to the modern standard Slovak. The central Slovak dialect was chosen as the basis of the standard language. Štúr&#x27;s codification work was disapproved by Ján Kollár and the Czechs, who saw it as an act of Slovak withdrawal from the idea of a common Czecho-Slovak nation and a weakening of solidarity. But the majority of Slovak scholars, including the Catholics (using Bernolák&#x27;s codification until then), welcomed the notion of codification. In 1844, he wrote &quot;Nárečja slovenskuo alebo potreba písaňja v tomto nárečí&quot; (&quot;The Slovak dialect or the necessity to write in this dialect&quot;). In 1853 the only compilation of his poetry, &quot;Spevy a piesne&quot; (&quot;Singings and songs&quot;) was published in Pressburg.

Janko Kráľ was one of the first poets to start writing in modern Slovak standard freshly codified (in 1843) by Ľudovít Štúr and his companions.

Dramatist Ján Chalupka&#x27;s first works were in Czech, but after 1848 he started writing in Slovak and translated Czech originals into Slovak.

===1872–1917===

Pavol Országh Hviezdoslav wrote his youthful poems only in Hungarian until the 1860s. In 1871 he participated in the preparation of the Almanach &quot;Napred&quot; (&quot;Forward&quot;) which marks the beginning of a new literary generation in Slovak literature. He introduced the syllabic-tonic verse into Slovak poetry and became leading representative of Slovak literary realism. His style is characterized by extensive use of self-coined words and expressions making it difficult to translate his works into foreign languages.

Martin Kukučín was the most notable representative of Slovak literary realism, and is considered to be one of the founders of modern Slovak prose.

===1918–1945===
As a result of the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and subsequent establishment of Czechoslovakia, the sociolinguistic pressures of Magyarization disappeared. During the interwar period, the preeminence of poetry gave way to prose. Milo Urban&#x27;s 1927 work &quot;Živý bič&quot; (The Living Whip) and Jozef Cíger-Hronský&#x27;s 1933 novel &quot;Jozef Mak&quot; both focused on the village, and the nature of change. 

During the turbulent years of the Slovak Republic and reestablishment of Czechoslovakia, two separate literary movements dominated, the lyrical prose of Hronský, František Švantner, Dobroslav Chrobák, Ľudo Ondrejov and Margita Figuli (&quot; Three Chestnut Horses&quot;), and the Slovak surrealists (Štefan Žáry, Rudolf Fabry, Pavel Bunčák and others).

<text>RFA &quot;Sir Geraint&quot; (L3027) was a Landing Ship Logistic of the Round Table class. She saw service in the Falklands War and Sierra Leone.

==Background==
The ship was originally built for army service, and was taken over by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in 1970. Round Table class ships were exclusively crewed by Hong Kong Chinese sailors from their introduction in 1963 until 1989, when &quot;Sir Lancelot&quot; was the last RFA to be crewed in this way. Like all of her class, &quot;Sir Geraint&quot; was named after a Knight of the Round Table.

She was commissioned in 1967 and saw extensive service in many of Britain&#x27;s naval operations since. Her home port was Marchwood.

==Operational history==
===Falklands War===
&quot;Sir Geraint&quot; first saw combat in the Falklands War of 1982, when along with all of the Royal Navy&#x27;s other amphibious ships, she was sent to recapture the Falkland Islands from an Argentine occupation force. At the start of the war, the ship was at Devonport and after the embarkation of 450 Royal Marines and 3 Gazelle helicopters, she left for Ascension Island. The ship anchored in San Carlos Water, Fitzroy Sound and Teal Inlet, discharging fuel and cargo.

===1978-2003===
In Operation Palliser, the ship was sent to Sierra Leone in 2000 when the U.K. intervened there.
11 September 1978 the Sir Geraint sailed from Alexandra dock, Liverpool en route to Belfast, carrying 13 platoon, Somme company, 1st Battalion Kings Own Royal Border Regiment; a detachment from the RAF and another detachment (unit not disclosed).

==Decommissioning==
&quot;Sir Geraint&quot; was listed for disposal in May 2003 and was reported broken up in India in December 2005.

<text>Enigma is a German musical project founded in 1990 by Romanian-German musician and producer Michael Cretu. Cretu had released several solo records, collaborated with various artists, and produced albums for his then-wife, German pop singer Sandra, before he conceived the idea of a new-age, worldbeat project. He recorded the first Enigma studio album, &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot; (1990), with contributions from David Fairstein and Frank Peterson. The album remains Enigma&#x27;s most successful, helped by the international hit single &quot;Sadeness (Part I)&quot;, which sold twelve million units alone. According to Cretu, the inspiration for the creation of the project came from his desire to make a kind of music that did not obey &quot;the old rules and habits&quot; and presented a new form of artistic expression with mystic and experimental components.

Enigma followed &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot; with a series of albums that involved several musicians and producers working with Cretu. The first was &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot; (1993), which incorporated tribal and ethnic influences and sold over eight million copies worldwide, followed by &quot;Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!&quot; (1996), which blended the Gregorian chants reminiscent of the first album with the strong intercultural soundscapes present in the second. Enigma&#x27;s fourth album &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror&quot; (2000) started a slight departure from the previous world music themes towards a heavier electronic atmosphere. This evolution culminated with &quot;Voyageur&quot; (2003), its fifth and more pop-based album, and &quot;A Posteriori&quot; (2006), a work inspired by the future collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, with distinct operatic tones and an electronic spectrum closer to &quot;Voyageur&quot; than the earlier releases. &quot;Seven Lives Many Faces&quot; (2008) followed and contained a mixture of classical and modern elements ranging from ethnic chants to rap and dubstep influences. Its eighth album, &quot;The Fall of a Rebel Angel&quot;, was released in November 2016.

Enigma has sold over 8.5 million RIAA-certified albums in the US and an estimated 70 million worldwide with over 100 gold and platinum certifications. The project has also received two Grammy Award nominations.

==History==
===Formation===
By the late 1980s, Romanian-born German musician and producer Michael Cretu had collaborated with several musicians, produced albums recorded by his then-wife, German pop singer Sandra, and released solo albums under his name for Polydor and Virgin Records, to varying levels of commercial success across Europe. In 1988, Cretu and Sandra married and relocated to the Spanish island of Ibiza. A home recording studio, A.R.T. Studios, was built, and Cretu began work on a new, worldbeat and new-age musical project named Enigma with David Fairstein and Frank Peterson. Cretu secured a deal with Munich-based Mambo Musik to handle Enigma&#x27;s management and publishing.

===1990s===

The first Enigma album, &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot;, was recorded in eight months and incorporated Gregorian chants mixed with atmospheric music and dance beats. He had previously used a Gregorian-type chant on the opening seconds of Sandra&#x27;s 1987 single &quot;Everlasting Love&quot;. Cretu wished to exclude his name from the album&#x27;s liner notes so the listener could conjure their own interpretations. He recalled management &quot;fell off their chairs&quot; when he requested it, &quot;but it worked&quot;. Cretu credits himself as &quot;Curly M.C.&quot; and Peterson is listed as &quot;F. Gregorian&quot;. Upon its release in December 1990, &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot; became an unexpected commercial success, helped by the international hit single &quot;Sadeness (Part I)&quot;, released a month prior that reached number one in 24 countries. The album reached the top 10 in ten countries, including the United Kingdom, and number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States, where it sold over four million copies and charted for more than 150 weeks. The album earned over 50 platinum sales awards worldwide, and made Enigma the most successful act signed to Virgin at the time of release.
Following the success of &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot;, Cretu received many offers for soundtrack work and writing film scores. He turned the majority of them down as he disliked the scripts presented to him except for the erotic thriller film &quot;Sliver&quot; (1993), for which he produced two songs for its soundtrack: &quot;Carly&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;Carly&#x27;s Loneliness&quot;. The former was reworked into &quot;Age of Loneliness&quot; in 1993. Cretu was unable to contribute more to the soundtrack as he wished to spend his time working on the second Enigma album.

&quot;The Cross of Changes&quot; was recorded in 1993. The long period in between the first and second was partly down to Virgin and Cretu&#x27;s manager forgetting to extend his contract with Virgin. This led to Cretu signing a new, five-album deal. Cretu retained many of the elements from the first album, but &quot;wanted to have a completely different experience. I wanted to mix as much as possible rock elements and ethnic and classical&quot;. Numerous samples were used, including from songs by Genesis, Black Sabbath, Vangelis and U2. Cretu made a conscious effort to reduce the amount of Gregorian chants incorporated into the album. Cretu based much of its lyrics on the concepts behind numerology, and read books on the subject. &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot; was released in December 1993, and reached number one in the UK and number 9 in the US. Four singles were released in 1994: &quot;Return to Innocence&quot;, &quot;The Eyes of Truth&quot;, &quot;Age of Loneliness&quot; and &quot;Out from the Deep&quot;. The former became an international top-10 hit in twelve countries and is certified gold in the US for selling half a million copies. &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot; sold an estimated 8 million copies worldwide.

In 1996, &quot;Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!&quot; was released. Cretu&#x27;s idea was that this third album was the child of the previous two albums, and therefore included familiar elements of Gregorian chants and Sanskrit chants in it. It did not achieve the same level of success that they enjoyed previously, and as a result, only two of the three singles originally slated were released. &quot;Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!&quot; sold over one million units in the United States, achieved a Gold certificate in the United Kingdom and two Grammy nominations: one for its artwork design and the second as Best New Age Album. After the album&#x27;s release, Cretu found that several fake Enigma albums were released onto the market that Cretu deemed as &quot;awful messes&quot;.

===2000s===

The 2000 release of &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror&quot; included samples from Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; on four tracks on the album. This time the Gregorian chants were toned down tremendously, although Shakuhachi flutes and other traditional Enigma signatures remain. Only &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; and &quot;Push the Limits&quot; were released as singles from the album. Ruth-Ann Boyle (from the band Olive) and Andru Donalds mark their first appearances on the Enigma project.

In 2001, Cretu released a new single called &quot;Turn Around&quot; together with &quot;Love Sensuality Devotion: The Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Love Sensuality Devotion: The Remix Collection&quot; to end what he considers to be the first chapter of Enigma. A light show was held at the Munich Planetarium in conjunction with the release of the compilation albums.

2003&#x27;s &quot;Voyageur&quot; saw a change of direction for the project, with most of the prominent Enigma signature elements (the ethnic and Gregorian chants, the Shakuhachi flutes) no longer employed.

To commemorate the fifteen years of Enigma, a limited-edition album called &quot;15 Years After&quot; was launched, which was the size of an LP vinyl disk, with Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s art in the cover, a big booklet with extra art, and featured eight compact discs: all the previous albums, the DVD &quot;Remember the Future&quot;, and a special and exclusive bonus CD, &quot;The Dusted Variations&quot;, which included chill-out versions of several of the project&#x27;s greatest hits. All of the songs are different from the originals and use minimal percussion. This disc also contained the single version of &quot;Hello and Welcome&quot;, which was later released as a single. On 28 August 2005, Enigma&#x27;s management Crocodile Music announced the release of &quot;Hello and Welcome&quot; as a single. It was released in Germany on 10 March 2006.

On 26 September 2006, Enigma&#x27;s sixth album &quot;A Posteriori&quot; was released worldwide, containing a new version of &quot;Hello and Welcome&quot; and the new song &quot;Goodbye, Milky Way&quot;. A DVD version of &quot;A Posteriori&quot; was released on 16 December 2006, which featured kaleidoscope images in synchronization with the multi-channel remastered music. &quot;A Posteriori&quot; received a Grammy nomination as Best New Age Album, its second in that category following 1996&#x27;s &quot;Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!&quot; nomination. In late March 2007, a &quot;Private Lounge&quot; remix album version of &quot;A Posteriori&quot; was released on the iTunes Music Store. This compilation includes twelve new remixed tracks from the album by artists such as Boca Junior, Tocadisco and more. Some of these tracks were available previously on the original &quot;A Posteriori&quot; iTunes version of the album and the previously mentioned DVD release.

On 19 September 2008, Enigma&#x27;s seventh album &quot;Seven Lives Many Faces&quot; was released worldwide. The lead single, &quot;Seven Lives&quot;, is a fusion of modern and classical elements.

&quot;The Platinum Collection&quot;, a three-disc compilation, was released on 27 November 2009 in Germany, and on 9 February 2010 worldwide. The first CD contains Enigma hits. The second CD contains remixes. The third CD is a collection of &quot;lost tracks&quot;, musical experiments which never were finalized and released previously.

===2010s–present===
On 5 October 2010, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the first album &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot;, the &quot;Enigma&#x27;s Social Song&quot; project began. Enigma fans were asked to submit vocals for a new Enigma song. The public was then asked to vote, with the winning submission &quot;Fei mea&quot; being provided by Latvian singer Fox Lima (real name Alise Ketnere) for the chorus. The top three runners-up, Mark Joshua from Brazil, J. Spring from Spain, and Rasa Serra from Lithuania, provided other important parts of the vocals like the bridge, backing and verse of the final version of the single. Fans also influenced further stages of the song&#x27;s creation by voting on elements such as a lead instrument, general mood, and style of the track. The final mix of the single named &quot;MMX (The Social Song)&quot; was released on 15 December 2010. It became the first song ever created for and by the fans via the internet.

In August 2016, Enigma&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;The Fall of a Rebel Angel&quot;, was announced for a release on 11 November 2016. It features guest musicians Brazilian singer-songwriter Mark Josher, Indonesian singer Anggun, female voice Nanuk, and English electro-pop duo Aquilo. Two singles from the album have been released, &quot;Sadeness (Part II)&quot; featuring Anggun, and &quot;Amen&quot; featuring Aquilo.

In May 2018, limited-edition coloured vinyl editions of Enigma&#x27;s entire catalogue were released in a new collection, &quot;The Colours of Enigma – The Vinyl Series&quot;. The set features new artwork and remastered stereo mixes made from the original master tapes.

Throughout 2019 and into 2020, three former vocalists for Enigma—Andru Donalds, Angel X and Fox Lima—embarked on a world tour under the name Original Enigma Voices. This marks the first time Enigma&#x27;s music has been performed live.

==Recording technologies==
Cretu recorded the first five Enigma albums at A.R.T. Studios, a home recording studio located on the Spanish island of Ibiza. From 1988 until 2001, Cretu lived in Santa Eulària des Riu followed by, from 2001 to 2008, a villa near Sant Antoni where the studio was redesigned and built by Gunter Wagner and Bernd Steber. &quot;A Posteriori&quot; and &quot;Seven Lives Many Faces&quot; were recorded using an all-in-one mobile digital recording studio named Alchemist. In 2010, a reworked version of Alchemist was built and named Merlin. &quot;MMX The Social Song&quot; was the first Enigma release recorded with this model.

==Sampling and lawsuits==
In 1991, Cretu was sued by and later settled with Munich-based choir Capella Antiqua and its record label Polydor Germany for infringing its &quot;right of personality&quot; through distortion in the samples used in &quot;Sadeness (Part I)&quot; and &quot;Mea Culpa (Part II)&quot;. The samples were taken from Capella Antiqua&#x27;s 1976 LP &quot;Paschale Mysterium&quot;; while the musical compositions were in the public domain, Capella Antiqua&#x27;s recording of them was copyrighted. European law also recognizes moral rights (&quot;droit moral&quot;) in works.

In 1998, Cretu was sued by Taiwanese musicians Difang and Igay Duana (also known as Kuo Ying-nan and Kuo Hsiu-chu), whose voices are used in &quot;Return to Innocence&quot;, over the unauthorized usage of their song without credit. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money and all further releases of the song were credited (including royalties) to the Kuos. Cretu has stated that he had been led to believe that the recording was in the public domain and that he did not intentionally violate the Kuos&#x27; copyright.

==Musical style==

Enigma generally produces worldbeat and New-age songs. The musical project is very experimental, often combining elements from other genres like ambience, pop, or rock. Michael Cretu has said in an Q&amp;A that he is &quot;always looking for the unknown and I am trying to find new ways to express my ideas.&quot; He later said: 

Enigma&#x27;s first album, &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot;, combines Gregorian chants and religious overtones with atmospheric synths, a hypnotic music-set, and a dance-like beat, along with elements of pop and ambience all accompanied by French-like whispers and somewhat erotic gasps, provided by Sandra. &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot;, Enigma&#x27;s second album, replaces the Gregorian chants from the &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot; with ethnic and tribal chanting. The album is atmospheric and spiritual like &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot;, but is combined with more well-developed beats and lyrics about love and self-awareness.

==Legacy==
Enigma&#x27;s international success with &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot; was a precursor to the creation of several other musical projects that follow similar styles and marketing approaches, especially the use of the term &quot;project&quot; as opposed to the band to denominate themselves, and the label &quot;enigmatic music&quot;, employed mainly by radios and listeners, to categorize their music inside the new-age umbrella. Cretu has cited the progressive rock band Yes as an influence.

Soon after working with Michael Cretu on the first Enigma album, German producer Frank Peterson left the project to focus on Gregorian, a band that performs mostly covers of modern pop and rock songs with Gregorian-like vocals and symphonic instruments. Likewise, French musical project Era features Gregorian chants mixed with pop-rock arrangements and is also frequently compared in scope to Enigma.

More electronic projects that often draw comparisons with Enigma are French act Deep Forest, Canadian duo Delerium, Danish project Achillea (created by Enigma&#x27;s co-producer and guest guitarist Jens Gad) and German project Schiller.

<doc id="527555" wikidata="Q421930" url="?curid=527555" title="Mirtazapine">
<text>Mirtazapine, sold under the brand name Remeron among others, is an atypical tetracyclic antidepressant, and as such is used primarily to treat depression. Its effects may take up to four weeks but can also manifest as early as one to two weeks. It is often used in cases of depression complicated by anxiety or insomnia. The effectiveness of mirtazapine is comparable to other commonly prescribed antidepressants. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, increased appetite and weight gain. Serious side effects may include mania, low white blood cell count, and increased suicide among children. Withdrawal symptoms may occur with stopping. It is not recommended together with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, although evidence supporting the danger of this combination has been challenged. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe. How it works is not clear, but it may involve blocking certain adrenergic and serotonin receptors. Chemically, it is a tetracyclic antidepressant, and is closely related to mianserin. It also has strong antihistaminergic effects.
Mirtazapine came into medical use in the United States in 1996. The patent expired in 2004, and generic versions are available. In 2022, it was the 105th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==
Mirtazapine is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults.

===Depression===
Mirtazapine is primarily used for major depressive disorder and other mood disorders. Onset of action appears faster than some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and similar to tricyclic antidepressants.

In 2010, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended generic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as first-line choices, as they are &quot;equally effective as other antidepressants and have a favourable risk–benefit ratio.&quot; For mirtazapine, it found &quot;no difference between mirtazapine and other antidepressants on any efficacy measure, although in terms of achieving remission mirtazapine appears to have a statistical though not clinical advantage. In addition, mirtazapine has a statistical advantage over selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in terms of reducing symptoms of depression, but the difference is not clinically significant. However, there is strong evidence that patients taking mirtazapine are less likely to leave treatment early because of side effects, although this is not the case for patients reporting side effects or leaving treatment early for any reason.&quot;

A 2011 Cochrane review comparing mirtazapine to other antidepressants found that while it appeared to have a faster onset in people for whom it worked (measured at two weeks), its efficacy was about the same as other antidepressants after six weeks&#x27; use.

A 2012 review focused on antidepressants and sleep found that mirtazapine reduced the time it took to fall asleep and improved the quality of sleep in many people with sleep disorders caused by depression, but that it could also disturb sleep in many people, especially at higher doses, causing restless leg syndrome in 8 to 28% of people and in rare cases causes REM sleep behavior disorder. This seemingly paradoxical dose–response curve of mirtazapine with respect to somnolence is owed to the exceptionally high affinity of the drug for the histamine H1, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors; exhibiting near exclusive occupation of these receptors at doses ≤15 mg. However, at higher doses, inverse agonism and constitutive activation of the α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors begins to offset activity at H1 receptors leading to decreased somnolence and even a subjective sensation of &quot;activation&quot; in treated patients.

A 2018 analysis of 21 antidepressants found them to be fairly similar overall. It found tentative evidence for mirtazapine being in the more effective group and middle in tolerability.

After one week of usage, mirtazapine was found to have an earlier onset of action compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

===Other===
There is also some evidence supporting its use in treating the following conditions, for which it is sometimes prescribed off-label:
* Generalized anxiety disorder
* Social anxiety disorder
* Obsessive–compulsive disorder
* Panic disorder
* Post-traumatic stress disorder
* Low appetite/underweight
* Insomnia
* Nausea and vomiting
* Itching
* Headaches and migraine
==Side or adverse effects==
A 2011 Cochrane review found that, compared with other antidepressants, it is more likely to cause weight gain and sleepiness, but it is less likely to cause tremors than tricyclic antidepressants, and less likely to cause nausea and sexual dysfunction than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Very common (≥10% incidence) adverse effects include constipation, dry mouth, sleepiness, increased appetite (17%) and weight gain (&gt;7% increase in &lt;50% of children).

Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects include weakness, confusion, dizziness, fasciculations (muscle twitches), peripheral edema (swelling, usually of the lower limbs), and negative lab results like elevated transaminases, elevated serum triglycerides, and elevated total cholesterol.

Mirtazapine is not considered to have a risk of many of the side effects often associated with other antidepressants like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and may improve certain ones when taken in conjunction with them. (Those adverse effects include decreased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, urinary retention, increased body temperature, excessive sweating, pupil dilation and sexual dysfunction.)

In general, some antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can paradoxically exacerbate some peoples&#x27; depression or anxiety or cause suicidal ideation. Despite its sedating action, mirtazapine is also believed to be capable of this, so in the United States and certain other countries, it carries a black box label warning of these potential effects, especially for people under the age of 25.

Mirtazapine may induce arthralgia (non-inflammatory joint pain).

A case report published in 2000 noted an instance in which mirtazapine counteracted the action of clonidine, causing a dangerous rise in blood pressure.

In a study comparing 32 antidepressants of all pharmacological classes, mirtazapine was one of the antidepressants most likely to cause nightmare disorder, sleepwalking, restless legs syndrome, night terrors and sleep paralysis.

Mirtazapine has been associated with an increased risk of death compared to other antidepressants in several studies. However, it is more likely that the residual differences between people prescribed mirtazapine rather than a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor account for the difference in risk of mortality.

==Withdrawal==
Stopping Mirtazapine and other antidepressants may cause withdrawal symptoms. A gradual and slow reduction in dose is recommended to minimize such symptoms. Effects of sudden cessation of treatment with mirtazapine may include depression, anxiety, tinnitus, panic attacks, vertigo, restlessness, irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flu-like symptoms, allergy-like symptoms such as pruritus, headaches, and sometimes mania or hypomania.

==Overdose==
Mirtazapine is considered to be relatively safe in the event of an overdose, although it is considered slightly more toxic in overdose than most of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (except citalopram). Unlike the tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine showed no significant cardiovascular adverse effects at 7 to 22 times the maximum recommended dose.

Twelve reported fatalities have been attributed to mirtazapine overdose. The fatal toxicity index (deaths per million prescriptions) for mirtazapine is 3.1 (95% CI: 0.1 to 17.2). This is similar to that observed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

==Interactions==
Concurrent use with inhibitors or inducers of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 can result in altered concentrations of mirtazapine, as these are the main enzymes responsible for its metabolism. As examples, fluoxetine and paroxetine, inhibitors of these enzymes, are known to modestly increase mirtazapine levels, while carbamazepine, an inducer, considerably decreases them. Liver impairment and moderate chronic kidney disease have been reported to decrease the oral clearance of mirtazapine by about 30%; severe kidney disease decreases it by 50%.

Mirtazapine in combination with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or tricyclic antidepressant as an augmentation strategy is considered to be relatively safe and is often employed therapeutically but caution should be given when combined with fluvoxamine. There is a combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine, sometimes referred to as &quot;California rocket fuel&quot;. Several case reports document serotonin syndrome induced by the combination of mirtazapine with other agents (olanzapine, quetiapine, tramadol and venlafaxine). Adding fluvoxamine to treatment with mirtazapine may cause a significant increase in mirtazapine concentration. This interaction may necessitate an adjustment of the mirtazapine dosage.

According to information from the manufacturers, mirtazapine should not be started within two weeks of any monoamine oxidase inhibitor usage; likewise, monoamine oxidase inhibitors should not be administered within two weeks of discontinuing mirtazapine.

The addition of mirtazapine to a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, while potentially having typical or idiosyncratic (unique to the individual) reactions not herein described, does not appear to cause serotonin syndrome. This is per the fact that the 5-HT2A receptor is the predominant serotonin receptor thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of serotonin syndrome (with the 5-HT1A receptor seeming to be protective). Mirtazapine is a potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and cyproheptadine, a medication that shares this property, mediates recovery from serotonin syndrome and is an antidote against it.

There is a possible interaction that results in a hypertensive crisis when mirtazapine is given to a patient who has already been on steady doses of clonidine. This involves a subtle consideration, when patients have been on chronic therapy with clonidine and suddenly stop the dosing, a rapid hypertensive rebound sometimes (20%) occurs from increased sympathetic outflow. Clonidine&#x27;s blood pressure lowering effects are due to stimulation of presynaptic α2 autoreceptors in the CNS which suppress sympathetic outflow. Mirtazapine itself blocks these same α2 autoreceptors, so the effect of adding mirtazapine to a patient stabilized on clonidine may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

Mirtazapine has been used as a hallucinogen antidote to block the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

Mirtazapine is sometimes described as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), although the actual evidence in support of this label has been regarded as poor. It is a tetracyclic piperazine-azepine.

Mirtazapine has antihistamine, α2-blocker, and antiserotonergic activity. It is specifically a potent antagonist or inverse agonist of the α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors, the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and the histamine H1 receptor. Unlike many other antidepressants, it does not inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine, nor does it inhibit monoamine oxidase. Similarly, mirtazapine has weak or no activity as an anticholinergic or blocker of sodium or calcium channels, in contrast to most tricyclic antidepressants. In accordance, it has better tolerability and low toxicity in overdose. As an H1 receptor antagonist, mirtazapine is extremely potent, and is in fact one of the most potent H1 receptor inverse agonists among tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants and most antihistamines in general. Antagonism of the H1 receptor is by far the strongest activity of mirtazapine, with the drug acting as a selective H1 receptor antagonist at low concentrations.

The (&quot;S&quot;)-(+) enantiomer of mirtazapine is responsible for antagonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, while the (&quot;R&quot;)-(–) enantiomer is responsible for antagonism of the 5-HT3 receptor. Both enantiomers are involved in antagonism of the H1 and α2-adrenergic receptors, although the (&quot;S&quot;)-(+) enantiomer is the stronger antihistamine.

Although not clinically relevant, mirtazapine has been found to act as a partial agonist of the κ-opioid receptor at high concentrations (EC50 = 7.2 μM).

====α2-Adrenergic receptor====
Antagonism of the α2-adrenergic receptors, which function largely as inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, enhances adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, notably central 5-HT1A receptor mediated transmission in the dorsal raphe nucleus and hippocampus; hence, mirtazapine&#x27;s classification as a NaSSA. Indirect α1 adrenoceptor-mediated enhancement of serotonin cell firing and direct blockade of inhibitory α2 heteroreceptors located on serotonin terminals are held responsible for the increase in extracellular serotonin. Because of this, mirtazapine has been said to be a functional &quot;indirect agonist&quot; of the 5-HT1A receptor. Increased activation of the central 5-HT1A receptor is thought to be a major mediator of efficacy of most antidepressant drugs.

====5-HT2 receptor====
Antagonism of the 5-HT2 subfamily of receptors and inverse agonism of the 5-HT2C receptor appears to be in part responsible for mirtazapine&#x27;s efficacy in the treatment of depressive states. 
Mirtazapine increases dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex. Accordingly, it was shown that by blocking the α2-adrenergic receptors and 5-HT2C receptors mirtazapine disinhibited dopamine and norepinephrine activity in these areas in rats. In addition, mirtazapine&#x27;s antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors has beneficial effects on anxiety, sleep and appetite, as well as sexual function regarding the latter receptor. Mirtazapine has been shown to lower drug seeking behaviour (more specifically to methamphetamine) in various human and animal studies. It is also being investigated in substance abuse disorders to reduce withdrawal effects and improve remission rates.

Mirtazapine significantly improves pre-existing symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome in affected individuals. Mirtazapine may be used as an inexpensive antiemetic alternative to Ondansetron. In conjunction with substance abuse counseling, mirtazapine has been investigated for the purpose of reducing methamphetamine use in dependent individuals with success. In contrast to mirtazapine, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and some tricyclic antidepressants acutely increase the general activity of the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptors, leading to a number of negative changes and side effects, the most prominent of which include anorexia, insomnia, nausea, and diarrhea, among others. However, most of these adverse effects are temporary, since down regulation of 5-HT2A receptors eventually occurs following chronic SSRI treatment, and desensitization of 5-HT3 receptors often occurs within a week or less. This is precisely why SSRIs have a delayed antidepressant and anxiolytic effect, and occasionally, an acute anxiogenic effect before down regulation occurs. Mirtazapine, on the other hand, is an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, and antagonists at this receptor typically induce reverse tolerance. Thus, the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of mirtazapine occur more rapidly than with SSRIs. Furthermore, its reduced incidence of sexual dysfunction (such as loss of libido and anorgasmia) could be a product of negligible binding to the serotonin transporter and antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptors; however, Mirtazapine&#x27;s high affinity towards and inverse agonism of the 5-HT2C receptors may greatly attenuate those pro-sexual factors (as evidenced by the pro-sexual effects of drugs like m-CPP and lorcaserin which agonize 5-HT2C receptors in a reasonably selective manner). As a result, it is often combined with these drugs to reduce their side-effect profile and to produce a stronger antidepressant effect. 

Mirtazapine does not have pro-serotonergic activity and thus does not cause serotonin syndrome. This is in accordance with the fact that it is not a serotonin reuptake inhibitor or monoamine oxidase inhibitor, nor a serotonin receptor agonist. There are no reports of serotonin syndrome in association with mirtazapine alone, and mirtazapine has not been found to cause serotonin syndrome in overdose. However, there are a handful of case reports of serotonin syndrome occurring with mirtazapine in combination with serotonergic drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, although such reports are very rare, and do not necessarily implicate mirtazapine as causative.

====5-HT3 receptor====
(R)-(–)-mirtazapine is a potent 5-HT3 blocker. It may relieve chemotherapy-related and advanced cancer-related nausea.

====H1 receptor====
Mirtazapine is a very strong H1 receptor antagonist and, as a result, it can cause powerful sedative and hypnotic effects. A single 15 mg dose of mirtazapine to healthy volunteers has been found to result in over 80% occupancy of the H1 receptor and to induce intense sleepiness. After a short period of chronic treatment, however, the H1 receptor tends to sensitize and the antihistamine effects become more tolerable. Many patients may also dose at night to avoid the effects, and this appears to be an effective strategy for combating them. Blockade of the H1 receptor may improve pre-existing allergies, pruritus, nausea, and insomnia in affected individuals. It may also contribute to weight gain, however. In contrast to the H1 receptor, mirtazapine has only low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, although anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth, constipation, and mydriasis are still sometimes seen in clinical practice.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The oral bioavailability of mirtazapine is about 50%. It is found mostly bound to plasma proteins, about 85%. It is metabolized primarily in the liver by N-demethylation and hydroxylation via cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. The overall elimination half-life is 20–40 hours, and this is independent of dosage. It is conjugated in the kidney for excretion in the urine, where 75% of the drug is excreted, and about 15% is eliminated in feces. Desmethylmirtazapine is an active metabolite of mirtazapine which is believed to contribute about 3-10% to the drug&#x27;s overall effects and has a half-life of about 25 hours.

==Chemistry==
Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic piperazinoazepine; mianserin was developed by the same team of organic chemists and mirtazapine differs from it via the addition of a nitrogen atom in one of the rings. It is a racemic mixture of enantiomers. The (&quot;S&quot;)-(+)-enantiomer is known as esmirtazapine.

Analogues of mirtazapine include mianserin, setiptiline, and aptazapine.

===Synthesis===
A chemical synthesis of mirtazapine has been published. The first step of synthesis is a condensation reaction between the molecule 2-chloro 3-cyanopyridine and the molecule 1-methyl-3-phenylpiperazine.

==History==
Mirtazapine was first synthesized at Organon and published in 1989, was first approved for use in major depressive disorder in the Netherlands in 1994, and was introduced in the United States in 1996 under the brand name Remeron.

==Society and culture==

==Research==
The use of mirtazapine has been explored in several additional conditions:
* Found ineffective for Sleep apnea/hypopnea
* Secondary symptoms of autistic spectrum conditions and other pervasive developmental disorders
* Antipsychotic-induced akathisia. 
* Drug withdrawal, dependence and detoxification
* Negative, depressive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia (as an adjunct)
* A case report has been published in which mirtazapine reduced visual hallucinations in a patient with Parkinson&#x27;s disease psychosis (PDP). This is in alignment with recent findings that inverse agonists at the 5-HT2A receptors are efficacious in attenuating the symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease psychosis. As is supported by the common practice of prescribing low-dose quetiapine and clozapine for PDP at doses too low to antagonize the D2 receptor, but sufficiently high doses to inversely agonize the 5-HT2A receptors.
* Eight case reports have been reported in five papers on the use of mirtazapine in the treatment of hives as of 2017.
* Mirtazapine to alleviate severe breathlessness in patients with COPD or interstitial lung diseases (BETTER-B). Found ineffective and potentially harmful.

==Veterinary use==
Mirtazapine also has some veterinary use in cats and dogs. Mirtazapine is sometimes prescribed as an appetite stimulant for cats or dogs experiencing loss of appetite due to medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease. It is especially useful for treating combined poor appetite and nausea in cats and dogs.

Mirtazapine is indicated for bodyweight gain in cats experiencing poor appetite and weight loss resulting from chronic medical conditions.

There are two options for administration: tablets given orally, and an ointment applied topically to the inner surface of the ear.

The most common side effects include signs of local irritation or inflammation at the site where the ointment is applied and behavioural changes (increased meowing, hyperactivity, disoriented state or inability to coordinate muscle movements, lack of energy/weakness, attention-seeking, and aggression).

<text>Plan Nine Publishing was a small press book publisher known for publishing webcomics in printed form. The first series published, and perhaps its most famous, was &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot;.

==History==
Plan Nine Publishing was named after the Ed Wood film &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;. The publisher was owned by David Allen, who worked publishing alongside his day job as a systems engineer at Financial Computing in Winston-Salem. Plan nine was started in 1996, and in January 2000 Allen left his day job to concentrate full-time on the publishing business.

98% of Plan Nine&#x27;s products were sold direct to customers through their website. With low print runs (typically less than 2000), the company were able to run with a profit with runs as low as 300. The low running costs meant that the company was able to have a 70% gross profit margin, and was able to give its artists a 20% royalty, more than 4 times the industrial average.

In April 2008, the Plan Nine main page was replaced by a message stating: &quot;Plan Nine has gone on hiatus for re-tooling and transition to new owners. Please check back with us Sept 1st, 2008. Thanks for your support!&quot; That page remained until the site finally went offline in 2010.

==Publications==
In addition to &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot;, Plan Nine published a number of other notable webcomics, including:
* &quot;Bastard Operator From Hell&quot;
* &quot;Buckles&quot;
* &quot;Doctor Fun&quot;
* &quot;Monty&quot;
*&quot;On the Fastrack&quot;
* &quot;Ozy and Millie&quot;
*&quot;Safe Havens&quot;
* &quot;Sluggy Freelance&quot;
* &quot;The Suburban Jungle&quot;
* &quot;User Friendly&quot;

Plan Nine also published &quot;Black Box Voting&quot; by Bev Harris, a nonfiction book discussing the issues involved in computer-based balloting. In 2004, the company published &quot;I Lived with My Parents and Other Tales of Terror,&quot; a collection of nonfiction and humor essays by Mary Jo Pehl.

<text>The S6G reactor is a naval reactor used by the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on attack submarines. The S6G designation stands for:

* S = Submarine platform
* 6 = Sixth generation core designed by the contractor
* G = General Electric was the contracted designer

== Design ==
This nuclear reactor was designed by General Electric for use on the attack submarines. The S6G reactor plant consists of the reactor coolant, steam generation, and other support systems that supply steam to the engine room. The S6G is a 165 megawatt (MW) reactor driving two 26 MW steam turbines.

The &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class engine room also contains the steam turbines that generate electricity and drive the propeller shaft. While exact specifications are classified, the S6G reactor can propel a &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine at over when surfaced and over while submerged.

Design and operational support for the S6G is provided by Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL). The S6G reactor plant was originally designed to use the D1G-2 core, similar to the D2G reactor used on the guided missile cruiser. All &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines from on were built with a D2W core. The D1G-2 cores are being replaced with D2W cores when the boats are refueled.

<doc id="527600" wikidata="Q5263967" url="?curid=527600" title="Desert Land Act">
<text>The Desert Land Act is a United States federal law which was passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1877, to encourage and promote the economic development of the arid and semiarid public lands within certain states of the Western states. Through the Act, United States citizens, or those declaring an intent to become a citizen, over the age of 21 may apply for a desert-land entry to irrigate and reclaim the land. This act amended the Homestead Act of 1862. Originally the act offered , but that was subsequently limited to 320.

A precursor act in 1875, called the Lassen County Act, was pushed by Representative John K. Luttrell of the northeastern district of California, who wanted to speed up privatization of land east of the Sierra. This act enlarged the maximum allowable purchase for settlers from 160 acres to 640 acres. With the backing of Land Commissioner J. A. Williamson, Luttrell and Senator Aaron A. Sargent co-sponsored the Desert act which extended the Lassen County Act to cover several arid states and other regions of California.

== Intentions ==
The original intent of the Desert Land Act was to instigate growth in the West by incentivizing people to move out West in the late 19th century and develop irrigation systems that would transform the land into usable space. While it encouraged growth, it also played a large role in water rights of the era. While settlers decided to move West to spread irrigation, rather than use the land solely for farming or cattle, it created a new dilemma for settlers as to how to use and share the water, be it on a communal or an individual basis. While many irrigation systems were set up communally, that eventually led to private water companies that owned large irrigation systems, which were built independently without consulting proper engineers.

==Outcomes==
Although the Desert Land Act was partly based on the Homestead Act and the Preemption Act (1841), it did not contain a key provision of those acts, the residence requirement. While the claimant had to improve the land, the claimant did not need to live on the land while the improvements were made. In the end, that led to a significant amount of fraud, and land speculation companies acquired tens of thousands of acres of California land by hiring &quot;dummy entrymen&quot; to make false claims of settlement.

Well known areas that began as land patented under the Desert Land Act include the Salt River in Arizona, the Imperial Valley in California, the Snake River in Idaho, Gallatin, Montana, and Yakima, Washington. Many of these communities facilitated further growth through the help of the Reclamation Act of 1902.

The peak of growth of these areas can be tracked by three separate eras prior to the current era: 1877–1887, 1888–1893, and 1893–1910.

=== 1877–1887 ===
The first decade after the Desert Land Act was passed was well known for fraudulent activity, especially by cattle producers. The era saw its end after a decline in the cattle industry.

=== 1888–1893 ===
The second era of the Desert Land Act saw a significant drop in fraudulent activity after an amendment to the Act that included stricter regulations and checks for irrigation systems, however was not entirely absent of fraudulent land ownership. The settlers were then required to submit maps and plans of irrigation to prevent violation of the act. Other amendatory acts to the law included encouraging communal placement of irrigation systems, and defined the progress of reclamation in the amount spent on the systems. The time period ended with the Panic of 1893.

=== 1893–1910 ===
The last era of the Desert Land Act began as the interest in irrigation and migration increased following the prosperity after the Depression of 1893. The last year of the era marks the peak of Desert Land Act original entries, over 15,000 in one year.

=== After 1910 ===
By 1920, nearly all present irrigation systems had been in place in all lands grown in the West from the act.

<text>Stuart Damon (born Stuart Michael Zonis; February 5, 1937 June 29, 2021) was an American actor and singer. He was best known for his 30-year portrayal of Dr. Alan Quartermaine on the American soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, for which he won an Emmy Award in 1999. Outside the United States, he was known for the role of Craig Stirling in &quot;The Champions&quot;.

==Early life==
Damon was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Marvin Leonard Zonis, who was a manufacturer, and his wife, Eva (Sherer) Zonis. Damon&#x27;s parents were Russian Jewish immigrants who made their home in America after fleeing the Bolshevik Revolution.

==Career==

After a series of roles on Broadway, Damon&#x27;s appearance as the Prince in the 1965 version of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot; starring Lesley Ann Warren helped pave the way to a long career in television soap opera. That same year, he had a prominent featured role in the Broadway musical &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; written by Richard Rodgers (music) and Stephen Sondheim (lyrics). He had earlier appeared in an Off-Broadway revival of &quot;The Boys From Syracuse&quot; with music by Rodgers and lyrics by Lorenz Hart. Damon is prominently featured on the cast albums of these musicals, as well as the hit &quot;Irma La Douce&quot; (1960).

Moving to Great Britain, Damon starred in the hit West End musical &quot;Charlie Girl&quot; with Anna Neagle in 1965, and was selected to appear as American secret agent Craig Stirling, alongside British actors Alexandra Bastedo and William Gaunt, in the ITC series &quot;The Champions&quot;. He also appeared with Roger Moore in an episode of &quot;The Saint&quot; which has been credited as the inspiration for the later series &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;, with Damon&#x27;s role being played by Tony Curtis. In 1968, he appeared in the BBC TV adaptation of &quot;The £1,000,000 Bank Note&quot; and played Henry Adams in the starring role. Damon also played magician Harry Houdini in a lavishly staged London musical, &quot;Man of Magic&quot;. In 1970 Damon released an LP called &quot;Stuart &#x27;Champion&#x27; Damon&quot; recorded on Reflection records REF L7 which failed to chart.

In the 1970s, he was cast alongside Gene Barry and Catherine Schell for the series &quot;The Adventurer&quot;, appearing briefly in two episodes. Damon later spoke candidly about the fact that Barry did not want him in the series because of his height: at over six feet, he towered over the shorter Barry. After acting roles in several other British television series, including &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;The New Avengers&quot;, &quot;The Main Chance&quot; and children&#x27;s series &quot;The Adventures of Black Beauty&quot; where he played a hypnotist, he returned to the United States.

In September 1974, he appeared as a solo singer in an episode of the UK TV variety programme &quot;The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club&quot;. The Champions theme tune was used as his walk-on music.

In 1977, he began his best known American role, as Dr. Alan Quartermaine Sr. on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. He also repeated the role on the short-lived &quot;GH&quot; spin-off &quot;Port Charles&quot; (1997–2003). In 1999, Damon won the Best Supporting Actor Emmy, for his portrayal of Alan, a physician addicted to the painkiller hydrocodone. In 2005, Damon was reunited with Alexandra Bastedo and William Gaunt for the first time in almost 40 years, to provide audio commentary on a DVD release of &quot;The Champions&quot;. In December 2006, it was reported that Damon had been fired from &quot;General Hospital&quot; and his last air date was scheduled for February 26, 2007, when his character died. The reason behind his release was not made public. The taping of the final scene occurred on February 5, coincidentally Damon&#x27;s 70th birthday. Fellow actors on &quot;General Hospital&quot; spoke to the press about how upset they were over Damon&#x27;s firing, with Damon&#x27;s on-show wife, played by Leslie Charleson, saying, &quot;This is the 30th anniversary for the two of us, in August. The timing leaves me very discouraged about the way soaps are going, the total disregard for history and the blatant disregard for the veterans.&quot;

Despite the death of the character, Damon had remained on the show, playing the ghost of Alan Quartermaine, haunting his sister Tracy about forging Alan&#x27;s will. He remained with the show until December 23, 2008, when Alan appeared to Monica on Christmas to tell her that he loved her. On September 18, 2009, Damon began appearing on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; as Janet and Teri Ciccone&#x27;s &quot;Uncle&quot; Ralph Manzo, a businessman most likely involved with the mob. He left the series on October 30, 2009, but returned August 23–25, 2010. From March 19–25, 2010, Damon played the role of Governor Jim Ford on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

Damon returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; for two episodes (August 26, 2011, and August 29, 2011), in which Alan appears in a fantasy sequence of Monica&#x27;s. He returned again in November 2012 as a ghost when son AJ was announced to be alive, after son Jason&#x27;s disappearance. He appeared, along with Rick Webber (Chris Robinson) and Emily Quartermaine (Natalia Livingston), as a hallucination shared by Tracy and Monica, for the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary episode, which aired on April 2, 2013.

== Personal life ==
Damon married Deirdre Ann Ottewill, a former actress, singer, and dancer on March 12, 1961. They had two children, Christopher and Jennifer Zonis. 

Stuart Damon died of kidney failure on June 29, 2021, aged 84, at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund retirement community in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, where he had lived for seven years. Deirdre Ottewill Damon died on December 25, 2019, from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<text>Blackletter (sometimes black letter or black-letter), also known as Gothic script, Gothic minuscule or Gothic type, was a script used throughout Western Europe from approximately 1150 until the 17th century. It continued to be commonly used for Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish until the 1870s, Finnish until the turn of the 20th century, Latvian until the 1930s, and for the German language until the 1940s, when Adolf Hitler officially discontinued it in 1941. Fraktur is a notable script of this type, and sometimes the entire group of blackletter faces is referred to as Fraktur. Blackletter is sometimes referred to as Old English, but it is not to be confused with the Old English language, which predates blackletter by many centuries and was written in the insular script or in Futhorc. Along with Italic type and Roman type, blackletter served as one of the major typefaces in the history of Western typography.

== Origins ==

Carolingian minuscule was the direct ancestor of blackletter. Blackletter developed from Carolingian as an increasingly literate 12th-century Europe required new books in many different subjects. New universities were founded, each producing books for business, law, grammar, history and other pursuits, not solely religious works, for which earlier scripts typically had been used.

These books needed to be produced quickly to keep up with demand. Labor-intensive Carolingian, though legible, was unable to effectively keep up. Its large size consumed a lot of manuscript space in a time when writing materials were very costly. As early as the 11th century, different forms of Carolingian were already being used, and by the mid-12th century, a clearly distinguishable form, able to be written more quickly to meet the demand for new books, was being used in northeastern France and the Low Countries.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;Gothic&quot; was first used to describe this script in 15th-century Italy, in the midst of the Renaissance, because Renaissance humanists believed this style was barbaric, and &quot;Gothic&quot; was a synonym for &quot;barbaric&quot;. Flavio Biondo, in &quot;Italia Illustrata&quot; (1474), wrote that the Germanic Lombards invented this script after they invaded Italy in the 6th century.

Not only were blackletter forms called &quot;Gothic script&quot;, but any other seemingly barbarian script, such as Visigothic, Beneventan, and Merovingian, were also labeled &quot;Gothic&quot;. This in contrast to Carolingian minuscule, a highly legible script which the humanists called &quot;littera antiqua&quot; (&quot;the ancient letter&quot;), wrongly believing that it was the script used by the ancient Romans. It was in fact invented in the reign of Charlemagne, although only used significantly after that era, and actually formed the basis for the later development of blackletter.

Blackletter script should not be confused with either the ancient alphabet of the Gothic language nor with the sans-serif typefaces that are also sometimes called &quot;Gothic&quot;.

== Forms ==
=== Early Gothic ===
It is difficult to be specific about the time at which &quot;Early Gothic&quot; (or &quot;Proto Gothic&quot;) was born and later died, because it was an interim script spanning Carolingian Minuscule and the Gothic &quot;textura&quot; scripts. It can generally be said that it was used in the 11th and 12th centuries. As universities began to populate Europe, a need for a more rapid writing technology led to the development of this script. The rounded forms of Carolingian became angular flicks of the quill, and both letters and words became compressed.

Early Gothic is characterized by a number of factors. There are no capital letters for this script. Instead Roman Rustic, Roman Square or Uncial letters were used. Versals were most often Lombardic Capitals usually painted in bright colors. Other features are split ascenders, a storied &#x27;a&#x27;, both the standard &#x27;r&#x27; and a half &#x27;r&#x27; 〈ꝛ〉 used after letters with bowls. The long &#x27;s&#x27; 〈ſ〉 is used primarily, but there are examples of the short &#x27;s&#x27; in some manuscripts. Punctuation is limited, usually only full stops and commas, and they are usually rendered at the mid-line.

As the script continued to evolve and become ever more angular, vertical and compressed, it began its transition to the &quot;textura&quot; hands.

=== Textura ===
&quot;Textualis&quot;, also known as &quot;textura&quot; or &quot;Gothic bookhand&quot;, was the most calligraphic form of blackletter, and today is the form most associated with &quot;Gothic&quot;. Johannes Gutenberg carved a &quot;textualis&quot; typeface—including a large number of ligatures and common abbreviations—when he printed his 42-line Bible. However, &quot;textualis &quot; was rarely used for typefaces after this.

According to Dutch scholar Gerard Lieftinck, the pinnacle of blackletter use was reached in the 14th and 15th centuries. For Lieftinck, the highest form of &quot;textualis&quot; was &quot;littera textualis formata&quot;, used for &quot;de luxe&quot; manuscripts. The usual form, simply &quot;littera textualis&quot;, was used for literary works and university texts. Lieftinck&#x27;s third form, &quot;littera textualis currens&quot;, was the cursive form of blackletter, extremely difficult to read and used for textual glosses, and less important books.

&quot;Textualis&quot; was most widely used in France, the Low Countries, England, and Germany. Some characteristics of the script are:
* Tall, narrow letters, as compared to their Carolingian counterparts.
* Letters formed by sharp, straight, angular lines, unlike the typically round Carolingian; as a result, there is a high degree of &quot;breaking&quot;, i.e. lines that do not necessarily connect with each other, especially in curved letters.
* Ascenders (in letters such as , , ) are vertical and often end in sharp finials.
* When a letter with a bow (in , , , ) is followed by another letter with a bow (such as or ), the bows overlap and the letters are joined by a straight line (this is known as &quot;biting&quot;).
* A related characteristic is the half r (also called r rotunda), the shape of when attached to other letters with bows; only the bow and tail were written, connected to the bow of the previous letter. In other scripts, this only occurred in a ligature with the letter .
* Similarly related is the form of the letter when followed by a letter with a bow; its ascender is then curved to the left, like the uncial . Otherwise the ascender is vertical.
* The letters , , , , , and the hook of have descenders, but no other letters are written below the line.
* The letter has a straight back stroke, and the top loop eventually became closed, somewhat resembling the number . The letter often has a diagonal line connecting its two bows, also somewhat resembling an , but the long s is frequently used in the middle of words.
* Minims, especially in the later period of the script, do not connect with each other. This makes it very difficult to distinguish between , , , and . A 14th-century example of the difficulty that minims produced is: &quot;mimi numinum niuium minimi munium nimium uini muniminum imminui uiui minimum uolunt&quot; (&quot;the smallest mimes of the gods of snow do not wish at all in their life that the great duty of the defenses of wine be diminished&quot;). In blackletter, this would look like a series of single strokes. As a result, dotted and (and briefly ) were subsequently developed. Minims may also have finials of their own.
* The script has many more scribal abbreviations than Carolingian, adding to the speed in which it could be written.

=== Schwabacher ===

&quot;Schwabacher&quot; was a blackletter form that was much used in early German print typefaces. It continued to be used occasionally until the 20th century. Characteristics of Schwabacher are:
* The small letter is rounded on both sides, though at the top and at the bottom, the two strokes join in an angle. Other small letters have analogous forms.
* The small letter has a horizontal stroke at its top that forms crosses with the two downward strokes.
* The capital letter has a peculiar form somewhat reminiscent of the small letter .

=== Fraktur ===

&quot;Fraktur&quot; is a form of blackletter that became the most common German blackletter typeface by the mid-16th century. Its use was so common that often any blackletter form is called &quot;Fraktur&quot; in Germany. Characteristics of Fraktur are:

* The left side of the small letter is formed by an angular stroke, the right side by a rounded stroke. At the top and at the bottom, both strokes join in an angle. Other small letters have analogous forms.
* The capital letters are compound of rounded -shaped or -shaped strokes.

Here is the entire alphabet in Fraktur (minus the long s and the sharp s), using the AMS Euler Fraktur typeface:
: formula_1
: formula_2

=== Cursiva ===
&quot;Cursiva&quot; refers to a very large variety of forms of blackletter; as with modern cursive writing, there is no real standard form. It developed in the 14th century as a simplified form of &quot;textualis&quot;, with influence from the form of &quot;textualis&quot; as used for writing charters. &quot;Cursiva&quot; developed partly because of the introduction of paper, which was smoother than parchment. It was therefore, easier to write quickly on paper in a cursive script.

In &quot;cursiva&quot;, descenders are more frequent, especially in the letters and , and ascenders are curved and looped rather than vertical (seen especially in the letter ). The letters , and (at the end of a word) are very similar to their Carolingian forms. However, not all of these features are found in every example of &quot;cursiva&quot;, which makes it difficult to determine whether or not a script may be called &quot;cursiva&quot; at all.

Lieftinck also divided &quot;cursiva&quot; into three styles: &quot;littera cursiva formata&quot; was the most legible and calligraphic style. &quot;Littera cursiva textualis&quot; (or &quot;libraria&quot;) was the usual form, used for writing standard books, and it generally was written with a larger pen, leading to larger letters. &quot;Littera cursiva currens&quot; was used for textbooks and other unimportant books and it had very little standardization in forms.

=== Hybrida ===
&quot;Hybrida&quot; is also called &quot;bastarda&quot; (especially in France), and as its name suggests, is a hybrid form of the script. It is a mixture of &quot;textualis&quot; and &quot;cursiva&quot;, developed in the early 15th century. From &quot;textualis&quot;, it borrowed vertical ascenders, while from &quot;cursiva&quot;, it borrowed long and , single-looped , and with an open descender (similar to Carolingian forms).

=== Donatus-Kalender ===
The &quot;Donatus-Kalender&quot; (also known as Donatus-und-Kalender or D-K) is the name for the metal type design that Gutenberg used in his earliest surviving printed works, dating from the early 1450s. The name is taken from two works: the Ars grammatica of Aelius Donatus, a Latin grammar, and the Kalender (calendar). It is a form of textura.

== Blackletter typesetting ==
While an antiqua typeface is usually a compound of roman types and italic types since the 16th-century French typographers, the blackletter typefaces never developed a similar distinction. Instead, they use letterspacing (German &quot;Sperrung&quot;) for emphasis. When blackletter is letterspaced, ligatures like , , or remain together without additional letterspacing ( is dissolved, though).

The use of bold text for emphasis is also alien to blackletter typefaces.

Words from other languages, especially from Romance languages including Latin, are usually typeset in antiqua instead of blackletter. The practice of setting foreign words or phrases in antiqua within a blackletter text does not apply to loanwords that have been incorporated into the language.

== National forms ==

=== England ===

==== &quot;Textualis&quot; ====

English blackletter developed from the form of Carolingian minuscule used there after the Norman Conquest, sometimes called &quot;Romanesque minuscule&quot;. &quot;Textualis&quot; forms developed after 1190 and were used most often until approximately 1300, after which it became used mainly for &quot;de luxe&quot; manuscripts. English forms of blackletter have been studied extensively and may be divided into many categories. &quot;Textualis formata&quot; (&quot;Old English&quot; or &quot;blackletter&quot;), &quot;textualis prescissa&quot; (or &quot;textualis sine pedibus&quot;, as it generally lacks feet on its minims), &quot;textualis quadrata&quot; (or &quot;psalterialis&quot;) and &quot;semi-quadrata&quot;, and &quot;textualis rotunda&quot; are various forms of high-grade &quot;formata&quot; styles of blackletter.

The University of Oxford borrowed the &quot;littera parisiensis&quot; in the 13th century and early 14th century, and the &quot;littera oxoniensis&quot; form is almost indistinguishable from its Parisian counterpart; however, there are a few differences, such as the round final forms, resembling the number , rather than the long used in the final position in the Paris script.
Printers of the late 15th and early 16th centuries commonly used blackletter typefaces, but under the influence of Renaissance tastes, Roman typefaces grew in popularity, until by about 1590 most presses had converted to them. However, blackletter was considered to be more readily legible (especially by the less literate classes of society), and it therefore remained in use throughout the 17th century and into the 18th for documents intended for widespread dissemination, such as proclamations and Acts of Parliament, and for literature aimed at the common people, such as ballads, chivalric romances, and jokebooks.

Chaucer&#x27;s works had been printed in blackletter in the late 15th century, but were subsequently more usually printed in Roman type. Horace Walpole wrote in 1781 that &quot;I am too, though a Goth, so modern a Goth that I hate the black letter, and I love Chaucer better in Dryden and Baskerville than in his own language and dress.&quot;

==== &quot;Cursiva&quot; ====
English &quot;cursiva&quot; () began to be used in the 13th century, and soon replaced &quot;littera oxoniensis&quot; as the standard university script. The earliest cursive blackletter form is &quot;Anglicana&quot;, a very round and looped script, which also had a squarer and angular counterpart, . The &quot;formata&quot; form was used until the 15th century and also was used to write vernacular texts. An form developed from a mixture of &quot;Anglicana&quot; and &quot;textualis&quot;, but by the 16th century, the principal cursive blackletter used in England was the Secretary script, which originated in Italy and came to England by way of France. Secretary script has a somewhat haphazard appearance and its forms of the letters , , , and are unique, unlike any forms in any other English script. The legacy of these English cursive Gothic forms survived in common use as late as the 18th century in the court hand used for some legal records.

=== France ===

==== &quot;Textualis&quot; ====
French &quot;textualis&quot; was tall and narrow compared to other national forms, and was most fully developed in the late 13th century in Paris. In the 13th century there also was an extremely small version of textualis used to write miniature Bibles, known as &quot;pearl script&quot;. Another form of French textualis in this century was the script developed at the University of Paris, &quot;littera parisiensis&quot;, which also is small in size and designed to be written quickly, not calligraphically.

==== &quot;Cursiva&quot; ====
French &quot;cursiva&quot; was used from the 13th to the 16th century, when it became highly looped, messy, and slanted. &quot;Bastarda&quot;, the &quot;hybrid&quot; mixture of &quot;cursiva&quot; and &quot;textualis&quot;, developed in the 15th century and was used for vernacular texts as well as Latin. A more angular form of &quot;bastarda&quot; was used in Burgundy, the &quot;lettre de forme&quot; or &quot;lettre bourgouignonne&quot;, for books of hours such as the of John, Duke of Berry.

=== Germany ===

Despite the frequent association of blackletter with German, the script was actually very slow to develop in German-speaking areas. It developed first in those areas closest to France and then spread to the east and south in the 13th century. The German-speaking areas are, however, where blackletter remained in use the longest.

Schwabacher typefaces dominated in Germany from about 1480 to 1530, and the style continued in use occasionally until the 20th century. Most importantly, all of the works of Martin Luther, leading to the Protestant Reformation, as well as the Apocalypse of Albrecht Dürer (1498), used this typeface. Johann Bämler, a printer from Augsburg, probably first used it as early as 1472. The origins of the name remain unclear; some assume that a typeface-carver from the village of Schwabach—one who worked externally and who thus became known as the &quot;Schwabacher&quot;—designed the typeface.

==== &quot;Textualis&quot; ====
German-made &quot;Textualis&quot; type is usually very heavy and angular, and there are few characteristic features that are common to all occurrences of the script. One common feature is the use of the letter for Latin or . &quot;Textualis&quot; was first used in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently became more elaborate and decorated, and it was generally reserved for liturgical works.

Johann Gutenberg used a &quot;textualis&quot; typeface for his famous Gutenberg Bible in 1455. Schwabacher, a blackletter with more rounded letters, soon became the usual printed typeface, but it was replaced by Fraktur in the early 17th century.
Fraktur came into use when Emperor Maximilian I (1493–1519) established a series of books and had a typeface created specifically for it. In the 19th century, the use of antiqua alongside Fraktur increased, leading to an Antiqua-Fraktur dispute which lasted until the Nazis mandated an end to the use of Fraktur in 1941. By then, Fraktur had been the most common and well-known blackletter style in Germany for a long time, and as a result all kinds of blackletter (including Schwabacher, Textualis, and so on) tend to be called &quot;Fraktur&quot; in German.

==== &quot;Cursiva&quot; ====

 German &quot;cursiva&quot; is similar to the cursive scripts in other areas, but forms of , and other letters are more varied; here too, the letter is often used. A &quot;hybrida&quot; form, which was basically &quot;cursiva&quot; with fewer looped letters and with square proportions similar to &quot;textualis&quot;, was used in the 15th and 16th centuries.

In the 18th century, the pointed quill (in contrast to the quill with a wide flat tip) was adopted for blackletter handwriting. In the early 20th century, the Sütterlin script was introduced in the schools.

=== Italy ===

==== &quot;Rotunda&quot; ====

Italian blackletter also is known as rotunda, as it was less angular than those produced by northern printing centers. The most common form of Italian &quot;rotunda&quot; was &quot;littera bononiensis&quot;, used at the University of Bologna in the 13th century. Biting is a common feature in &quot;rotunda&quot;, but breaking is not.

Italian &quot;Rotunda&quot; also is characterized by unique abbreviations, such as with a line beneath the bow signifying &quot;qui&quot;, and unusual spellings, such as for (&quot;milex&quot; rather than &quot;miles&quot;).

==== &quot;Cursiva&quot; ====
Italian cursive developed in the 13th century from scripts used by notaries. The more calligraphic form is known as &quot;minuscola cancelleresca italiana&quot; (or simply &quot;cancelleresca&quot;, chancery hand), which developed into a book hand, a script used for writing books rather than charters, in the 14th century. &quot;Cancelleresca&quot; influenced the development of &quot;bastarda&quot; in France and secretary hand in England.

=== The Netherlands ===
==== &quot;Textualis&quot; ====
A &quot;textualis&quot; form, commonly known as &quot;Gotisch&quot; or &quot;Gothic script&quot;, was used for general publications from the fifteenth century on, but became restricted to official documents and religious publications during the seventeenth century. Its use persisted into the nineteenth century for editions of the State Translation of the Bible, but otherwise became obsolete.

== Unicode ==
Mathematical blackletter characters are separately encoded in Unicode in the Mathematical alphanumeric symbols range at U+1D504-1D537 and U+1D56C-1D59F (bold), except for individual letters already encoded in the Letterlike Symbols range (plus long s at U+017F). Fonts supporting the range include Code2001, Cambria Math, Noto Sans Math, and Quivira (textura style).

This block of characters is intended for use in setting mathematical texts, which contrast blackletter characters with other letter styles. Outside of mathematics, the character set has seen some limited decorative use, but it lacks punctuation and other characters necessary for running text, and the Unicode standard for setting non-mathematical material in blackletter is to use ordinary Latin code points with a dedicated blackletter font.

<text>Gregorio Jesús Gil y Gil (12 March 1933 – 14 May 2004) was a Spanish businessman and politician. He served as Mayor of Marbella between 1991 and 2002, and presided for a 16-year tenure as president of the football club Atlético de Madrid. The Marbella city council had to be dissolved soon after his death, a legal but unprecedented movement in Spanish politics, to put an end to extreme corruption and dealings with international mafias, among other crimes.

==Career==

=== Business ===
In the 1960s Gil ran a construction firm building gated communities. A complex he had built in San Rafael, near Segovia, collapsed in 1969, killing 58 people and injuring many others. A subsequent investigation showed that the cement in the new building had not yet set, and the whole project had been completed without use of architects, surveyors, or plans. Gil was sentenced to five years in prison, but was pardoned after 18 months by General Francisco Franco.

===Football===
In 1987, Gil was elected president at football side Atlético Madrid (his first signing was that of 21-year-old Portuguese winger Paulo Futre), where he initiated a volatile relationship with fans, reporters, players and head coaches. In 1992, he shut down Atlético&#x27;s youth academy, which saw talented 15-year-old Raúl switch to crosstown rivals Real Madrid.

Most of Marbella&#x27;s local police were recruited indirectly by Gil among legionnaires and members of other elite military forces throughout southern Spain and Northern Africa during the 1980s / 1990s, and some of these officers comprised Gil&#x27;s own private &quot;garde de corps&quot;.

In a March 1997 incident, as the two teams met in the 1996–97 Champions League quarterfinals, Gil referred to Ajax Amsterdam, due to its many players of Surinamese origin, as &quot;FC Congo&quot;.

The English band Prolapse released a song called &quot;Surreal Madrid&quot; on their album &quot;Pointless Walks to Dismal Places&quot;, which lyrics detailing Gil&#x27;s controversial tenure as Atlético Madrid&#x27;s president.

===Politics===
In 1991, he founded and led the &quot;Grupo Independiente Liberal&quot; (GIL) as his political vehicle, and was elected as mayor of Marbella the same year. He installed a bust of Francisco Franco in the town hall and was known for walking the streets of the town shouting abuse at prostitutes and homeless people. His mayorship was popular enough for him to be re-elected three times.

In April 2002, he was banned for 28 years from holding public office, forced to stand down as mayor and briefly imprisoned.

In early 2008, a full, two-episode documentary appeared in &quot;Tele 5&quot; explaining the highlights of his life and career.

==Death==
On 9 May 2004, he suffered a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in his finca in Valdeolivas. He died in Madrid on 14 May at the age of 71. The funeral was attended by 20,000 people. He was cremated and his ashes were interred in the family mausoleum at the Cementerio de la Almudena.

==Political reputation==
Gil was infamous and controversial for his extreme social and political views, summed up in a unique brand of foulmouthed, low-brow populism punctuated by self-aggrandizing, homophobic, racist, xenophobic and otherwise derogatory remarks and, occasionally, by pre-democratic nostalgia.

He publicly referred to former Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) town councilor Isabel García Marcos as a &quot;whore&quot; during town council meetings and, on one occasion, dubbed journalist Carmen Rigalt as &quot;la jinetera del periodismo&quot; (&#x27;prostitute of journalism&#x27;).

The Málaga coastline, effectively under the area of economic and political influence of the Gil family, became a popular residence for British, Italian, and Russian gangsters while he was mayor, as well as a haven for former national socialists either awaiting or shirking extradition, such as Otto Remer and Léon Degrelle. At the same time, however, Gil instigated several crackdowns on drug users and prostitutes. He was involved in several criminal cases, including the so-called &quot;Caso de las camisetas&quot; and &quot;Caso Atlético&quot;.

Crime rates and open manifestations of poverty decreased dramatically during the first years of his administration. The improvements included the beatings of delinquents and prostitutes, relocation of foreigners with low incomes, and handouts of money to homeless people in exchange for leaving town. The subsequent improvement in the lifestyle of a segment of the population was cited as a major reason for his re-election.

<text>In computer chess, a chess engine is a computer program that analyzes chess or chess variant positions, and generates a move or list of moves that it regards as strongest.

A chess engine is usually a back end with a command-line interface with no graphics or windowing. Engines are usually used with a front end, a windowed graphical user interface such as Chessbase or WinBoard that the user can interact with via a keyboard, mouse or touchscreen. This allows the user to play against multiple engines without learning a new user interface for each, and allows different engines to play against each other.

Many chess engines are now available for mobile phones and tablets, making them even more accessible.

==History==

The meaning of the term &quot;chess engine&quot; has evolved over time. In 1986, Linda and Tony Scherzer entered their program Bebe into the 4th World Computer Chess Championship, running it on &quot;Chess Engine,&quot; their brand name for the chess computer hardware made, and marketed by their company Sys-10, Inc. By 1990 the developers of Deep Blue, Feng-hsiung Hsu and Murray Campbell, were writing of giving their program a &#x27;searching engine,&#x27; apparently referring to the software rather than the hardware. In December 1991, &quot;Computer-schach &amp; Spiele&quot; referred to Chessbase&#x27;s recently released Fritz as a &#x27;Schach-motor,&#x27; the German translation for &#x27;chess engine.&#x27; By early 1993, Marty Hirsch was drawing a distinction between commercial chess programs such as &quot;Chessmaster 3000&quot; or &quot;Battle Chess&quot; on the one hand, and &#x27;chess engines&#x27; such as &quot;ChessGenius&quot; or his own &quot;MChess Pro&quot; on the other. In his characterization, commercial chess programs were low in price, had fancy graphics, but did not place high on the SSDF (Swedish Chess Computer Association) rating lists while engines were more expensive, and did have high ratings.

In 1994, Shay Bushinsky was working on an early version of his &quot;Junior&quot; program. He wanted to focus on the chess playing part rather than the graphics, and so asked Tim Mann how he could get &quot;Junior&quot; to communicate with &quot;Winboard.&quot; Tim&#x27;s answer formed the basis for what became known as the Chess Engine Communication Protocol or Winboard engines, originally a subset of the GNU Chess command line interface.

Also in 1994, Stephen J. Edwards released the Portable Game Notation (PGN) specification. It mentions PGN reading programs not needing to have a &quot;full chess engine.&quot; It also mentions three &quot;graphical user interfaces&quot; (GUI): XBoard, pgnRead and Slappy the database.

By the mid-2000s, engines had become so strong that they were able to beat even the best human players. Except for entertainment purposes, especially using engines with limited strength, matches between humans and engines are now rare; engines are increasingly regarded as tools for analysis rather than as opponents.

==Interface protocol==
Common Winboard engines would include &quot;Crafty,&quot; &quot;ProDeo&quot; (based on &quot;Rebel&quot;), &quot;Chenard,&quot; &quot;Zarkov&quot; and &quot;Phalanx.&quot;

In 1995, Chessbase released a version of their database program including Fritz 4 as a separate engine. This was the first appearance of the Chessbase protocol. Soon after, they added the engines Junior and Shredder to their product line up, including engines in CB protocol as separate programs which could be installed in the Chessbase program or one of the other Fritz style GUI&#x27;s. Fritz 1-14 were only issued as Chessbase engines, while &quot;Hiarcs,&quot; &quot;Nimzo,&quot; &quot;Chess Tiger&quot; and &quot;Crafty&quot; have been ported to Chessbase format even though they were UCI or Winboard engines. Recently, Chessbase has begun to include Universal Chess Interface (UCI) engines in their playing programs such as &quot;Komodo,&quot; &quot;Houdini,&quot; &quot;Fritz 15–16&quot; and &quot;Rybka&quot; rather than convert them to Chessbase engines.

In 2000, Stefan Meyer-Kahlen and Franz Huber released the Universal Chess Interface, a more detailed protocol that introduced a wider set of features. Chessbase soon after dropped support for Winboard engines, and added support for UCI to their engine GUI&#x27;s and Chessbase programs. Most of the top engines are UCI these days: &quot;Stockfish,&quot; &quot;Komodo,&quot; &quot;Leela Chess Zero,&quot; &quot;Houdini,&quot; &quot;Fritz 15-16,&quot; &quot;Rybka,&quot; &quot;Shredder,&quot; &quot;Fruit,&quot; &quot;Critter,&quot; &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; and &quot;Ruffian.&quot;

From 1998, the German company Millenium 2000 briefly moved from dedicated chess computers into the software market, developing the Millennium Chess System (MCS) protocol for a series of CD&#x27;s containing &quot;ChessGenius&quot; or &quot;Shredder,&quot; but after 2001 ceased releasing new software. A more longstanding engine protocol has been used by the Dutch company, Lokasoft, which eventually took over the marketing of Ed Schröder&#x27;s &quot;Rebel.&quot;

==Increasing strength==
Chess engines increase in playing strength continually. This is partly due to the increase in processing power that enables calculations to be made to ever greater depths in a given time. In addition, programming techniques have improved, enabling the engines to be more selective in the lines that they analyze and to acquire a better positional understanding. A chess engine often uses a vast previously-computed opening &quot;book&quot; to increase its playing strength for the first several moves, up to possibly 20 moves or more in deeply analyzed lines.

Some chess engines maintain a database of chess positions, along with previously-computed evaluations and best moves—in effect, a kind of &quot;dictionary&quot; of recurring chess positions. Since these positions are pre-computed, the engine merely plays one of the indicated moves in the database, thereby saving computing time, resulting in stronger, faster play.

Some chess engines use endgame tablebases to increase their playing strength during the endgame. An endgame tablebase includes all possible endgame positions with a small amount of material. Each position is conclusively determined as a win, loss, or draw for the player whose turn it is to move, and the number of moves to the end with best play by both sides. The tablebase identifies for every position the move which will win the fastest against an optimal defense, or the move that will lose the slowest against an optimal offense. Such tablebases are available for all chess endgames with seven pieces or fewer (trivial endgame positions are excluded, such as six white pieces versus a lone black king).

When the maneuvering in an ending to achieve an irreversible improvement takes more moves than the horizon of calculation of a chess engine, an engine is not guaranteed to find the best move without the use of an endgame tablebase, and in many cases can fall foul of the fifty-move rule as a result. Many engines use permanent brain (continuing to calculate during the opponent&#x27;s turn) as a method to increase their strength.

Distributed computing is also used to improve the software code of chess engines. In 2013, the developers of the Stockfish chess playing program started using distributed computing to make improvements in the software code. , a total of more than 745 years of CPU time has been used to play more than 485 million chess games, with the results being used to make small and incremental improvements to the chess-playing software. In 2019, Ethereal author Andrew Grant started the distributed computing testing framework OpenBench, based upon Stockfish&#x27;s testing framework, and it is now the most widely-used testing framework for chess engines.

==Limiting an engine&#x27;s strength==
By the late 1990s, the top engines had become so strong that few players stood a chance of winning a game against them. To give players more of a chance, engines began to include settings to adjust or limit their strength. In 2000, when Stefan Meyer-Kahlen and Franz Huber released the Universal Chess Interface protocol they included the parameters uci_limitstrength and uci_elo allowing engine authors to offer a variety of levels rated in accordance with Elo rating, as calibrated by one of the rating lists. Most GUIs for UCI engines allow users to set this Elo rating within the menus. Even engines that have not adopted this parameter will sometimes have an adjustable strength parameter (e.g. Stockfish 11). Engines which have a uci_elo parameter include Houdini, Fritz 15–16, Rybka, Shredder, Hiarcs, Junior, Zappa, and Sjeng. GUIs such as Shredder, Chess Assistant, Convekta Aquarium, Hiarcs Chess Explorer, and Martin Blume&#x27;s Arena have dropdown menus for setting the engine&#x27;s uci_elo parameter. The Fritz family GUIs, Chess Assistant, and Aquarium also have independent means of limiting an engine&#x27;s strength apparently based on an engine&#x27;s ability to generate ranked lists of moves (called multipv for &#x27;principle variation&#x27;).

==Comparisons==
===Tournaments===
The results of computer tournaments give one view of the relative strengths of chess engines. However, tournaments do not play a statistically significant number of games for accurate strength determination. In fact, the number of games that need to be played between fairly evenly matched engines, in order to achieve significance, runs into the thousands and is, therefore, impractical within the framework of a tournament. Most tournaments also allow any types of hardware, so only engine/hardware combinations are being compared.

Historically, commercial programs have been the strongest engines. If an amateur engine wins a tournament or otherwise performs well (for example, Zappa in 2005), then it is quickly commercialized. Titles gained in these tournaments garner much prestige for the winning programs, and are thus used for marketing purposes. However, after the rise of volunteer distributed computing projects such as Leela Chess Zero and Stockfish and testing frameworks such as FishTest and OpenBench in the late 2010s, free and open source programs have largely displaced commercial programs as the strongest engines in tournaments.

====List of tournaments====
Current tournaments include:
* Top Chess Engine Championship (TCEC)
* World Computer Chess Championship (WCCC and WCSC)
** World Computer Speed Chess Championship
* Chess.com Computer Chess Championship (CCC)

Historic tournaments include:
* Dutch Open Computer Chess Championship
* Internet Computer Chess Tournament (CCT)
* International Paderborn Computer Chess Championship
* North American Computer Chess Championship

===Ratings===
Chess engine rating lists aim to provide statistically significant measures of relative engine strength. These lists play multiple games between engines. Some also standardize the opening books, the time controls, and the computer hardware the engines use, in an attempt to measure the strength differences of the engines only. These lists provide not only a ranking, but also margins of error on the given ratings.

The ratings on the rating lists, although calculated by using the Elo system (or similar rating methods), have no direct relation to FIDE Elo ratings or to other chess federation ratings of human players. Except for some man versus machine games which the SSDF had organized many years ago (when engines were far from today&#x27;s strength), there is &quot;no calibration&quot; between any of these rating lists and player pools. Hence, the results which matter are the &quot;ranks&quot; and the &quot;differences&quot; between the ratings, and not the absolute values.

Missing from many rating lists are IPPOLIT and its derivatives. Although very strong and open source, there are allegations from commercial software interests that they were derived from a disassembled binary of Rybka. Due to the controversy, all these engines have been blacklisted from many tournaments and rating lists. Rybka in turn was accused of being based on Fruit, and in June 2011, the ICGA formally claimed Rybka was derived from Fruit and Crafty and banned Rybka from the International Computer Games Association World Computer Chess Championship, and revoked its previous victories (2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010). The ICGA received some criticism for this decision. Despite all this, Rybka is still included on many rating lists, such as CCRL and CEGT, in addition to Houdini, a derivative of the IPPOLIT derivative Robbolito, and Fire, a derivative of Houdini. In addition, Fat Fritz 2, a derivative of Stockfish, is also included on most of the rating lists.

====Differences between rating lists====
There are a number of factors that vary among the chess engine rating lists:
* Number of games. More games when testing each engine result in higher statistical significance. 
* Formulae used to calculate the elo of each engine.
* Time control:
** Longer time controls are better suited for determining tournament play strength, but also either make testing more time-consuming or the results less statistically significant. 
** Increment time controls are better suited for determining tournament play strength since tournaments usually use increment time controls, but many rating lists use cyclic/repeating time controls instead. 
** Consistent time controls throughout the rating list vs different time controls for each test. The latter results in a smaller statistical significance than the former because different time controls is a potential confounder. This is particularly problematic for CCRL because CCRL uses both cyclic/repeating time controls (40/15) and increment time controls (15&quot;+10&#x27;) in its CCRL 40/15 list yet maintains both time controls on the same list.
* Opponents used in testing engines. 
** Some rating lists only test an engine against the most recent version of each opponent engine, while other rating lists test an engine against the version(s) of each opponent engine closest in elo to the engine being tested. 
** Most rating lists do not test every engine on the rating list vs every other engine on the rating list in a round-robin tournament format. This causes distortions in the rating lists, especially for CCRL and CEGT.
* Hardware used: 
** Faster hardware with more memory leads to stronger play.
** 64-bit (vs. 32-bit) hardware and operating systems favor bitboard-based programs
** Hardware using modern instruction sets such as AVX2 or AVX512 favor engines using vectors and vector intrinsics in their code, common in neural networks. 
** Graphics processing units favor programs with deep neural networks.
** Multiprocessor vs. single processor hardware.
** Consistent hardware throughout the rating list vs different hardware for every test. The latter results in a smaller statistical significance than the former because different hardware is a potential confounder. This is particularly problematic for CEGT because multiple testers each with their own unique hardware are involved in testing each engine in CEGT. The same issue arises in CCRL.
* Ponder settings (speculative analysis while the opponent is thinking) aka Permanent Brain.
* Transposition table sizes.
* GUI settings. 
* Opening book settings. 

These differences affect the results, and make direct comparisons between rating lists difficult.

===Test suites===
Engines can be tested by measuring their performance on specific positions. Typical is the use of test suites where for each given position there is one best move to find. These positions can be geared towards positional, tactical or endgame play. The Nolot test suite, for instance, focuses on deep sacrifices. The BT2450 and BT2630 test suites measure the tactical capability of a chess engine and have been used by REBEL. There is also a general test suite called Brilliancy which was compiled mostly from &quot;How to Reassess Your Chess Workbook&quot;. The Strategic Test Suite (STS) tests an engine&#x27;s strategical strength. Another modern test suite is Nightmare II which contains 30 chess puzzles.

==Kasparov versus the World (chess game played with computer assistance)==

In 1999, Garry Kasparov played a chess game called &quot;Kasparov versus the World&quot; over the Internet, hosted by the MSN Gaming Zone. Both sides used computer (chess engine) assistance. The &quot;World Team&quot; included the participation of over 50,000 people from more than 75 countries, deciding their moves by plurality vote. The game lasted four months, ending after Kasparov&#x27;s 62nd move when he announced a forced checkmate in 28 moves found with the computer program Deep Junior. The World Team voters resigned on October 22. After the game, Kasparov said: &quot;It is the greatest game in the history of chess. The sheer number of ideas, the complexity, and the contribution it has made to chess make it the most important game ever played.&quot;

==Engines for chess variants==
Some chess engines have been developed to play chess variants, adding the necessary code to simulate non-standard chess pieces, or to analyze play on non-standard boards. ChessV and Fairy-Max, for example, are both capable of playing variants on a chessboard up to 12×8 in size, such as Capablanca Chess (10×8 board).

For larger boards, however, there are few chess engines that can play effectively, and indeed chess games played on an unbounded chessboard (infinite chess) are virtually untouched by chess-playing software, although theoretically a program using a MuZero-derived algorithm could handle an unbounded state space.

==Graphical user interfaces==
XBoard/Winboard was one of the earliest graphical user interfaces (GUI). Tim Mann created it to provide a GUI for the GNU Chess engine, but after that, other engines such as Crafty appeared which used the Winboard protocol. Eventually, the program Chessmaster included the option to import other Winboard engines in addition to the King engine which was included.

In 1995, Chessbase began offering the Fritz engine as a separate program within the Chessbase database program and within the Fritz GUI. Soon after, they added the Junior and Shredder engines to their product line up, packaging them within the same GUI as was used for Fritz. In the late 1990s, the Fritz GUI was able to run Winboard engines via an adapter, but after 2000, Chessbase simply added support for UCI engines, and no longer invested much effort in Winboard.

In 2000, Stefan Meyer-Kahlen started selling Shredder in a separate UCI GUI of his own design, allowing UCI or Winboard engines to be imported into it.

Convekta&#x27;s Chess Assistant and Lokasoft&#x27;s ChessPartner also added the ability to import Winboard and UCI engines into their products. Shane Hudson developed Shane&#x27;s Chess Information Database, a free GUI for Linux, Mac and Windows. Martin Blume developed Arena, another free GUI for Linux and Windows. Lucas Monge entered the field with the free Lucas Chess GUI. All three can handle both UCI and Winboard engines.

On Android, Aart Bik came out with Chess for Android, another free GUI, and Gerhard Kalab&#x27;s Chess PGN Master and Peter Osterlund&#x27;s Droidfish can also serve as GUIs for engines.

The Computer Chess Wiki lists many chess GUIs.

<text>ChipTest was a 1985 chess playing computer built by Feng-hsiung Hsu, Thomas Anantharaman and Murray Campbell at Carnegie Mellon University. It is the predecessor of Deep Thought which in turn evolved into Deep Blue.

==History==
ChipTest was based on a special VLSI-technology move generator chip developed by Hsu. ChipTest was controlled by a Sun-3/160 workstation and capable of searching approximately 50,000 moves per second. Hsu and Anantharaman entered ChipTest in the 1986 North American Computer Chess Championship, and it was only partially tested when the tournament began. It lost its first two rounds, but finished with an even score. 

In August 1987 ChipTest was overhauled and renamed ChipTest-M, &quot;M&quot; standing for microcode. The new version had eliminated ChipTest&#x27;s bugs and was ten times faster, searching 500,000 moves per second and running on a Sun-4 workstation. ChipTest-M won the North American Computer Chess Championship in 1987 with a 4–0 sweep. 

ChipTest was invited to play in the 1987 American Open, but the team did not enter due to an objection by the HiTech team, also from Carnegie Mellon University. HiTech and ChipTest shared some code, and Hitech was already playing in the tournament. The two teams became rivals.

Designing and implementing ChipTest revealed many possibilities for improvement, so the designers started on a new machine. Deep Thought 0.01 was created in May 1988 and the version 0.02 in November the same year. This new version had two customized VLSI chess processors and it was able to search 720,000 moves per second. With the &quot;0.02&quot; dropped from its name, Deep Thought won the World Computer Chess Championship with a perfect 5–0 score in 1989.

<doc id="527625" wikidata="Q7867742" url="?curid=527625" title="USS Blandy">
<text>USS &quot;Blandy&quot; (DD-943) was a &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyer, named for Admiral William H. P. Blandy USN (1890–1954),

&quot;Blandy&quot; was built by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, and was launched 19 December 1956, sponsored by Mrs. John M. (Hope &quot;Toni&quot; Blandy) Lee, daughter of Admiral Blandy; and commissioned 26 November 1957.

==History==

In 1958, &quot;Blandy&quot; bore the American Unknown Soldier of World War II&#x27;s European Theater from Naples to a rendezvous off the Virginia Capes with &quot;Boston&quot; (CAG-1), which bore the Unknowns of the Pacific Theater and the Korean War, and &quot;Canberra&quot; (CAG-2). After the selection of the Unknown of World War II was made on board &quot;Canberra&quot;, the selected casket and the Korean Unknown were transferred to &quot;Blandy&quot; for transportation to Washington, D.C. Arriving at the U.S. Naval Gun Factory on 28 May, both caskets lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda until 30 May, after which they were interred in the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery.

In 1961, &quot;Blandy&quot; won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet.

On October 30, 1962, &quot;Blandy&quot; tracked Soviet submarine B-130, dropping small charges and following the submarine in an attempt to bring it to the surface. After seventeen hours, the submarine&#x27;s commander, Captain Nikolai Shumkov, ordered the submarine - at this point running with reduced diesel power and minimal oxygen - to surface.

In 1968, Blandy was awarded the Arleigh Burke fleet trophy award for all Atlantic Fleet.

On 7 December 1970 BLANDY was transiting the passage between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, at 2118Z when the nuclear submarine USS JACK SSN 605 took her picture:

==Fate==
The ship was decommissioned on 5 November 1982 and struck from the Navy List on 27 July 1990.

She was sold for scrap to the Fore River Shipyard and Iron Works on 11 December 1992. When the shipyard went bankrupt in 1993, she was resold to N. R. Acquisition Incorporated of New York City by the Massachusetts Bankruptcy Court and scrapped by Wilmington Resources of Wilmington in North Carolina in 1996.

<text>Wonsan (), previously known as Wonsanjin (), is a port city and naval base located in Kangwon Province, North Korea, along the eastern side of the Korean Peninsula, on the Sea of Japan and the provincial capital. The port was opened by Japanese forces in 1880. Before the 19501953 Korean War, it fell within the jurisdiction of the then South Hamgyong province, and during the war, it was the location of the Blockade of Wonsan. The population of the city was estimated at 329,207 in 2013. Notable people from Wonsan include Kim Ki-nam, a diplomat and former Vice Chairman of the ruling Workers&#x27; Party of Korea.

In 2013, it was announced that Wonsan would be converted into a summer destination with resorts and entertainment. Having spent his childhood years there, Kim Jong Un has expressed significant interest in developing the region, with the construction of new infrastructure such as Kalma Airport, a dual-use civilian international airport and military proving ground. A state corporation, the Wonsan Zone Development Corporation, has been established with feasibility studies for a wide variety of hotels and commercial and industrial development.

== History ==
===Ancient history===
Evidence of humans living in the area during the Neolithic period and Bronze age was found in the Chungpyongdong (Now promoted to ri) area, where pottery was found. The area was called Eo eul mae (於乙買) and Chonjung county (泉井郡), when it was under the rule of Goguryeo, and became Jungchon county (井泉郡) after it incorporated into the kingdom of Silla in 681. After Taejo of Goryeo conquered the region, the region was renamed as yongju (湧州) where it was ruled by a special defense administrator. The area was renamed again as Uiju (宜州), and a fortress was constructed in 1108. From 1258 to 1356, it was part of the Ssangseong Prefectures.

===Modern history===

In 1854, the Russian Empire surveyed the area and found it highly desirable.

Wonsan opened as a trade port in 1880. Its original name was Wonsanjin (元山津), but it was also known by the Russian name of Port Lazarev (Lazaref). Under Japanese rule (1910–45) it was called Gensan (元山). In 1914 the P&#x27;yongwon and Kyongwon railway lines were opened, connecting the city to P&#x27;yongyang (then known as Heijo) and Seoul (then Keijo or Kyongsong). Thus, the city gradually developed into an eastern product distribution center. Under the Japanese occupation, the city was heavily industrialized and served as an important point in the distribution of trade between Korea and mainland Japan.

After the Korean War broke out it was captured by American and South Korean troops on 10 October 1950 during their drive north. When they left ahead of the Chinese counter-attack, the city fell under Chinese control on 9 December 1950. It was heavily bombed and shelled by the United Nations in the Blockade of Wonsan during the Korean War. According to the official US Navy history, Wonsan was under continuous siege and bombardment by the American navy from March 1951 until July 27, 1953, making it the longest siege in modern American naval history. By the war&#x27;s end, the city was a vast shell.

===City centre redevelopment===

Kim Jong Un announced in 2015 plans for a $582 million redevelopment of the city center, which is to be entirely demolished and rebuilt. A 5-star hotel, a 17-story Wonsan International Finance Centre, and a $9.6m exhibition hall are expected to be built.

Kim Jong Un maintains a private compound in Wonsan that includes a palace with several guest houses, a harbor with a boathouse, a beach, and a racehorse track.

===Provincial borders===
Wonsan used to be in South Hamgyong, but when provincial borders were redrawn in 1946, it joined the northern half of Kangwon (which had been split at the 38th parallel north into a zone under Soviet control in the north and one of American control in the south in 1945) and became its capital, as Kangwon&#x27;s traditional capitals Wonju (1395–1895) and Ch&#x27;unch&#x27;on (since 1896) both were south of the 38th parallel and south of the Military Demarcation Line that replaced the 38th parallel as a border in 1953.

== Food ==
Due to it being a coastal city, seafood is commonly consumed in Wonsan.

Wonsan is known for many local seafood delicacies including boiled rice with clam meat, a speciality of Kangwon Province.

== Economy ==
Wonsan has an aquatic product processing factory, shipyard, chemistry enterprise, a cement factory, as well as the 4 June Rolling Stock Works, which is one of the DPRK&#x27;s largest railway rolling stock factories.
The Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang International Tourist Zone, announced in 2014, was set to become an investment hub in North Korea. The investment proposal, titled &#x27;Integrated Development of Jung-dong,&#x27; aims to construct 4 blocks of 30-storied and 6 blocks of 21-storied apartments for lease in No.1 and No.2 districts. The proposal includes around 2,000 flats with 3-4 living rooms. The area is primarily developed for foreign investors and is adjacent to &quot;Office Work&quot; complexes, including an international financial building, leasing office building, and restaurants specializing in International cuisine. The plan also includes an international finance complex, which was previously referred to as a &quot;financial service center&quot; but has been renamed to &quot;financial complex.&quot;

On 15 July 2016, KCNA announced that the Kalma area, located on the central east coast of Korea, will be turned into a tourist resort. The area boasts of four-kilometer-long beach resort, not far away from such scenic spots as Mt. Kumgang, Lake Sijung, Chongsokjong and Lagoon Samil and the Masikryong Ski Resort.

It remained a priority project for the following years until 2020 when the further works on it were completely halted. Most of the work on it is done and it is expected that it would be completed and will be opened for tourists after the country reopens its borders for tourism again.
At night, the city is bright and well lit at par with Pyongyang.

== Transportation ==
===Road and rail===
The district of Wonsan-si is served by several stations on the Kangwon Line of the Korean State Railway, including a branch to the port; it is also connected to the national road network, and is the terminus of the P&#x27;yongyang-Wonsan Tourist Motorway and the Wonsan-Kŭmgangsan Highway.

====Urban transit====
A trolleybus system with two lines is currently in operation in Wonsan. The system opened on September 8, 1988, from Wonsan station to Changchon-dong. In 2020, there were three new trolleybus lines under construction in the city, which is aimed at reducing the number of fossil fuel-powered vehicles and to prevent air pollution, and a covered depot was opened. Prior to that, the vehicles were parked on the western loop. Services were often interrupted during this time. The new lines were planned to run from Changchon-dong to Kalma station, to Songdowon and to Myongsasimiri-dong. NK News however, incorrectly reported by implying that it was only being revived recently, while in fact, new Chollima-321 trolleybuses had been delivered since 2019. In 2020, the extension from Changchon-dong to Kalma station was completed, while in 2021, a fully new line was opened, and trolleybuses started to run to Songdowon, from Changchon-dong.

A tram line is also under construction, with the trams to be built by the Kim Chong-t&#x27;ae Electric Locomotive Works. The trams will be narrow gauge vehicles. This was after Kim Jong Un stressed the need for a tram line at the resort area. The line was completed on November 24, 2020, though passenger service has not started due to the incomplete state of the rest of the resort.

===Air===
The city has the dual purpose military and civilian Wonsan Airport (IATA: WON) equipped with 01/19 and 15/33 dual runways. Images from Google Earth from July and August 2014 indicated that major expansion was taking place, including the construction of two new runways. There is also an underground air force runway which runs through a mountain, near Wonsan. North Korea&#x27;s first public air show, the Wonsan International Friendship Air Festival, was held at Wonsan Airport in September 2016.

===Sea===
Wonsan was also the terminus of the &quot;Mangyongbong-92&quot; ferry that operated between Wonsan and Niigata, which was the only direct connection between Japan and North Korea. This service was canceled in 2006 when Japan banned North Korean ships.

The Sinphyong-Kumgang Scenic Site is located on the Ahobiryong mountain range that extends to the central region of Korea.

Its development began in December 2009 and was completed in four years.

It is located 124 km from Pyongyang, and the total site area is 1820 hectares.

Sinphyong-Kumgang Scenic Site has a total of 70 attractions, including Okryudaegol, Namgang Chongsokjong, Tanphunggol, Kumgang Waterfall Valley, Tohwa Cave, and Nounphogol. Visitors to this place appreciate the unique natural scenery of spring, summer, autumn and winter.

=== Ullim Falls ===
At 75 metres high, Ullim Falls is one of the most famous waterfalls in Korea. It is so called due to the sound of the waterfall that shakes the valley and travels far.

The water of the fall originates in the Masikryong Mountains and 20-25 cubic metres of water falls down per second in the middle of a steep cliff. Below the falls is a pond, which is 1.5 metres in depth and 30 metres in radius.

It is a favoured cultural recreation ground.

Other famous scenic sites near Wonsan include Chongsokchon and Mt. Kŭmgang. The German Church is the former church of the Tokwon abbey, now used by the Wonsan University of Agriculture.

<text>Gustavus Katterfelto (or Katerfelto) (c. 1743–15 November 1799) was a Prussian conjurer, scientific lecturer, and quack who travelled through Georgian England.

==Career==
Christian William Anthony Katterfelto (known as Gustavus) arrived at Hull in September 1776 along with his wife, daughter, and a black kitten. He advertised in the local newspapers:On the 26th of September - arrived at Hull where he has ever since performed in the Concert-Room with universal Applause, a Son of Col. Katterfelto of the famous Prussian Regiment of Death-Head Hussars, Professor of Natural Philosophy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Geography, Fortification, Navigation etc. For 15 years past he has travelled thro’most Parts of Europe, and spent a considerable Fortune, purposely to improve himself in Philosophy and Mathematics, and has finished a curious Apparatus for his own Amusement, and for the Instruction of the Public. - He will exhibit in Nicholson&#x27;s Great Room, Coney-Street York, Tomorrow Evening (Oct.9) and every Evening this Week. The Doors will be opened at Six, and the Performance to begin at Seven. Admittance to the three front Seats 2s each, back Seats 1s only. - His various astonishing Performances are fully expressed in Hand-Bills which will be delivered this Day. He goes from this City to Leeds, Wakefield, Halifax etc.He traveled around Britain until his death in 1799. He performed in London from 1780 to 1784. He was arrested on occasion (&quot;as a rogue and vagabond&quot; at Kendal) for breaking local laws. The widespread flu epidemic of 1782 made him famous as a quack, when he used a solar microscope to show images of microbes he believed were its cause. These &quot;insects&quot; provided him with the catchphrase &quot;Wonders! Wonders! Wonders!&quot; which often headed his advertisements. He lectured in Piccadilly on electricity, magnetism and the invented terms &quot;styangraphy, palenchics, and caprimantic arts&quot; to impress his audience. After allegedly suffering from a bout of flu, he began to promote Dr Batto&#x27;s medicine which he claimed had cured him in 12 hours. He sided with the contagion theory of disease that had been proposed by some Arab physicians although he called the causal organisms &quot;insects&quot;, claiming that many numbers could be found in a drop of water.

Katterfelto was an accomplished conjurer, who performed with a black cat which he advertised as &quot;evil&quot;. He claimed to have launched the first hot air balloon fifteen years before the Montgolfier brothers, and claimed to be the greatest natural philosopher since Isaac Newton.

He performed on several occasions for the royal family. The poet William Cowper refers to Katterfelto in &quot;The Task&quot;. For a while the word &quot;Katerfelto&quot; became synonymous with charlatan.

Katterfelto died in 1799 in Bedale, North Yorkshire where he is buried.

<text>Myrddin Wyllt (—&quot;Myrddin the Wild&quot;, , ) is a figure in medieval Welsh legend. In Middle Welsh poetry he is accounted a chief bard, the speaker of several poems in The Black Book of Carmarthen and The Red Book of Hergest. He is called &quot;Wyllt&quot;—&quot;the Wild&quot;—by Elis Gruffydd, and elsewhere Myrddin Emrys (&quot;Ambrosius&quot;), Merlinus Caledonensis (&quot;of Caledonia&quot;) or &quot;Merlin Sylvestris &quot;(&quot;of the woods&quot;).
Myrddin Wylt was born in 540 CE.

Although his legend centres on a known Celtic theme, Myrddin&#x27;s legend is rooted in history, for he is said to have gone mad after the Battle of Arfderydd (Arthuret) at which Rhydderch Hael of Strathclyde defeated the Brythonic king Gwenddoleu. According to the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; this took place in 573. Myrddin fled into the forest, lived with the beasts and received the gift of prophecy.

Myrddin Wyllt&#x27;s legend closely resembles that of a north-British figure called Lailoken, which appears in Jocelyn of Furness&#x27; 12th-century &quot;Life of Kentigern&quot;. Scholars differ as to the independence or identity of Lailoken and Myrddin, though there is more agreement as to Myrddin&#x27;s original independence from later Welsh legends.

Myrddin&#x27;s grave is reputed to lie near the River Tweed in the village of Drumelzier near Peebles, although nothing remains above ground level at the site.

== In Welsh literature ==
The earliest (pre-12th century) Welsh poems about the Myrddin legend present him as a madman living an existence in the Caledonian Forest. He was born in 540. In the forest he ruminates on his former existence and the events of the Battle of Arfderydd, where Riderch Hael, King of Alt Clut (Strathclyde) slaughtered the forces of Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio, and Myrddin went mad watching this defeat. The &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; date this battle to 573, naming Gwenddoleu&#x27;s adversaries as the sons of Eliffer, presumably Gwrgi and Peredur. This battle, the subsequent assassination of Urien Rheged and the defeat of the Gododdin at Catraeth are cited as reasons for the collapse of the alliance of early British kingdoms in the north before the Angles, Scots and Picts.

Welsh historian John Edward Lloyd suggests there were three traditions that were conflated. The first, “&quot;Merlinus Ambrosius&quot;” (the Arthurian Merlin), identified by Giraldus Cambrensis as &quot;Myrddin Emrys&quot; —the Welsh form of &quot;Ambrosius&quot;—, who was found at Carmarthen and prophesied before Vortigern. The second, “&quot;Merlinus Silvester&quot;” or “&quot;Merlinus Caledonius&quot;” who came from the North (&quot;Alba&quot;) and was a contemporary of Arthur, saw a horrible portent in the sky while fighting in a battle and spent the rest of his days a madman in the woods. The third one is “Myrddin Wyllt”, whom Lloyd identifies with the &quot;Lailoken&quot; mentioned in Jocelyn of Furness&#x27; &quot;Life of St. Kentigern&quot;.

Although Lailoken is identified with Merlin in the late 15th-century &quot;Lailoken and Kentigern&quot;, the alternative name may already have been present in the Middle Welsh poem &quot;Dialogue of Myrddin with his sister Gwendydd&quot; (also named Gwenddydd or Languoreth), for she addresses him several times as &quot;Llallwg&quot;, for which the diminutive would be &quot;Llallwgan&quot;.

A version of this legend is preserved in the late-15th-century &quot;Lailoken and Kentigern&quot;. In this narrative St. Kentigern meets a naked, hairy madman called Lailoken, said by some to be called &quot;Merlynum&quot; or &quot;Merlin&quot;, in a deserted place. He has been condemned for his sins to wander in the company of beasts, having been the cause of the deaths of all of the persons killed in the battle fought &quot;on the plain between Liddel and Carwannok.&quot; Having told his story, the madman leaps up and flees from the presence of the saint back into the wilderness. He appears several times more in the narrative until at last asking St. Kentigern for the Sacrament, prophesying that he was about to die a triple death. After some hesitation, the saint grants the madman&#x27;s wish, and later that day the shepherds of King Meldred capture him, beat him with clubs, then cast him into the river Tweed where his body is pierced by a stake, thus fulfilling his prophecy.

Legend has it that second part of Carmarthen&#x27;s name (in Welsh &quot;-fyrddin&quot;) was derived from Myrddin and identified his place of birth. However, when Britannia was a Roman province, Carmarthen was the civitas capital of the Demetae tribe, known as &quot;Moridunum&quot; (from Brittonic &quot;*mori-dunon&quot; meaning &quot;sea fort&quot;), and this is the true source of the town&#x27;s name. Celticist A. O. H. Jarman suggests that instead the name Myrddin was derived from Carmarthen&#x27;s name.

Welsh literature has examples of a prophetic literature, predicting the military victory of all of the Celtic peoples of Great Britain who will join and drive the English – and later the Normans – back into the sea. Some of these works were presented as prophecies of Myrddin. The &quot;Armes Prydein&quot; (one of the earliest mentions of him) contains the line “Myrddin foretells that they will meet”. The tradition was apparently shared with Cornish literature, however only a single Latin translation of a lost Cornish-language original &quot;Prophecy of Merlin&quot; exists in the Vatican library by John of Cornwall.
In the Black Book of Carmarthen the poems &quot;Yr Afallennau&quot; and &quot;Yr Oianau&quot; describe Myrddin talking to an apple tree and a pig, prophesying the success or failure of the Welsh army in battles with the Normans in South Wales.

Clas Myrddin, or &quot;Merlin&#x27;s Enclosure&quot;, is an early name for Great Britain stated in the Third Series of Welsh Triads.

== Geoffrey of Monmouth ==
The modern depiction of Merlin began with Geoffrey of Monmouth, who portrayed Merlin as a prophet and a madman, and introduced him into Arthurian legend. Geoffrey of Monmouth popularised Merlin the wizard, associated with the town of Carmarthen in South Wales. His book &quot;Prophetiae Merlini&quot; was intended to be a collection of the prophecies of the Welsh figure of Myrddin, whom he called Merlin. He included the &quot;Prophetiae&quot; in his more famous second work, the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. In this work, however, he constructed an account of Merlin&#x27;s life that placed him in the time of Ambrosius Aurelianus and King Arthur, decades before the lifetime of Myrddin Wyllt. He also attached to him an episode originally ascribed to Ambrosius, and others that appear to be of his own invention.

Geoffrey later wrote the &quot;Vita Merlini&quot;, an account based more closely on the earlier Welsh stories about Myrddin and his experiences at Arfderyd, and explained that the action was taking place long after Merlin&#x27;s involvement with Arthur. However, the &quot;Vita Merlini&quot; did not prove popular enough to counter the version of Merlin in the &quot;Historia&quot;, which went on to influence most later accounts of the character.

<doc id="527632" wikidata="Q3100619" url="?curid=527632" title="The Amps">
<text>The Amps were an American alternative rock band formed by Kim Deal in 1995, while her band the Breeders went on hiatus. The group consisted of Deal, on lead vocals and rhythm guitar; Luis Lerma on bass; Nate Farley on lead guitar; and Jim Macpherson of the Breeders on drums. Kelley Deal, Kim&#x27;s sister, was also briefly involved, but had to leave the band due to drug problems. The group was named when Kim Deal started calling herself Tammy Ampersand for fun, and the band Tammy and the Amps. They recorded the album &quot;Pacer&quot; in the United States and Ireland.

&quot;Pacer&quot; was released in October 1995. The group toured the United States, Europe, and Australia with bands including the Foo Fighters, Sonic Youth, and Guided by Voices. Critics commented on the loose and rough quality of these performances. The Amps continued as a group until 1996, when Deal changed their name back to the Breeders. By 2000, Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley had left the band; they were all at times involved in various projects with Guided by Voices&#x27; Robert Pollard. Deal&#x27;s next album, the Breeders&#x27; &quot;Title TK&quot;, was released seven years after &quot;Pacer&quot;.

== Background and formation ==
From 1986 to 1992, Deal was a member of the Pixies and from 1989 onwards, the Breeders. In August 1993, the Breeders released their second album, &quot;Last Splash&quot; which went platinum in the USA, gold in Canada, and silver in the UK. The other members of the group at that time were Kim&#x27;s twin sister Kelley Deal, Josephine Wiggs and Jim Macpherson. By late 1994, after two years of straight touring and recording, and culminating in the Lollapalooza tour, the band members were exhausted; they decided to take some time off from the Breeders, but this hiatus ended up being longer than expected. Kelley was arrested on drug charges in late 1994 and spent time in and out of rehabilitation, while Wiggs became involved in musical projects in New York, including collaborations with members of Luscious Jackson.

Meanwhile, Kim Deal was eager to continue recording and performing. At first she envisioned her next album as a solo record, on which she would play all of the instrument parts. When she was recording initial demos for the project, she asked Kelley to play on some of them, to distract her from her drug difficulties. Since Kelley was now also involved, Deal decided not to go solo, but formed a new group. She recruited Macpherson to play drums, musician Luis Lerma, bass, and Nate Farley, guitar. Later, Kelley dropped out of the project for rehabilitation and moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota. For fun, Deal began calling herself Tammy Ampersand, and the group, Tammy and the Amps. This became simply the Amps.

== Recording and touring ==
The Amps released one album, &quot;Pacer&quot; which was recorded at several different studios. The first session, at Easley Studios in Memphis was engineered by Davis McCain and Doug Easley. Deal recorded new songs there including what would become &quot;Pacer&quot;″s single, &quot;Tipp City&quot;. While she was producing an upcoming record by Guided by Voices she had a recording opportunity; when the group abandoned work on their album, Deal used the leftover studio time for her own songs. Following the Easley Studios session, recording for &quot;Pacer&quot; continued at six other locations in total, including studios in Chicago, Los Angeles, Dublin, and Deal&#x27;s hometown of Dayton. Engineers Steve Albini, John Agnello, Bryce Goggin, and others each helped record one or more of these sessions. &quot;Pacer&quot; came out in October 1995.

The Amps toured throughout 1995 and 1996. Early performances, before releasing &quot;Pacer&quot;, included June–July 1995 shows in Dayton: one with Guided by Voices at Gilly&#x27;s and another with Poster Children. They toured with Guided by Voices and Chavez in the United Kingdom in September, in cities such as Sheffield, Glasgow, Brighton, and London; Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders attended the London concert as a birthday present to herself, and afterwards came backstage to meet Deal. The Amps played another show with Guided by Voices in Ohio in October. The Amps performed a series of US concerts in October and November with Sonic Youth, among which were shows in Detroit and Chicago with Helium, in Seattle and Portland with Bikini Kill, and in Los Angeles with Mike Watt and Sonic Youth. Following the concerts with Sonic Youth, the Amps did a tour of Europe, including a performance in London on December 7. In January 1996, they played the Summersault festival in Australia. That year, the Amps toured with the Foo Fighters in the United States, in locations such as Chicago (with That Dog), Worcester, Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas (with Jawbreaker), as well as playing one more concert with Guided By Voices, in early March in Newport, Kentucky. At this show, Deal had a permanent falling-out with Robert Pollard when Guided By Voices unintentionally used up all the soundcheck time. In 1995 or 1996, they also played shows with the Tasties and Brainiac.

Reviewers described live concerts by the Amps as unpolished and relaxed. &quot;The Chronicle&quot;″s Drema Crist praised their show at an unidentified location as &quot;fun-spirited and silly&quot;. Greg Kot of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; described one of their Chicago performances as &quot;off-kilter&quot; and wrote that &quot;Deal&#x27;s pungent vocals were swallowed up by the guitars, and the foursome&#x27;s slight melodies were lost amid all the bashing.&quot; A review in &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; of the same concert noted that &quot;The Amps play with a low-key, hangout sound.&quot; &quot;The Phoenix&quot;″s Matt Ashare felt that at their December 1995 show in Boston &quot;the Amps didn&#x27;t click in a way that would suggest that this was Deal&#x27;s new, full-time band&quot;; he added that it was &quot;an unpretentiously gritty way for Deal to let off some steam while the Breeders [took] a little break&quot;. In &quot;Boston Rock&quot;, this concert was characterized as &quot;sloppy&quot; but &quot;charm[ing] ... hanging loosely off Kim&#x27;s gruff vocals and ebullient personality&quot;.

== Reforming the Breeders ==
Later in 1996, Deal changed the name of the group back to the Breeders and the band originally had almost the same line-up as the Amps. Until then Deal had been waiting for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together, and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them. In May 1996, Wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in any immediate Breeders activity; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul, to be close to her rehabilitation facility. Deal then decided that she did not want to wait any longer to reform the group, partly because the Breeders&#x27; repertoire was larger than the Amps&#x27;, thereby allowing longer concerts. Deal added violinist Carrie Bradley (who had played on the Breeders&#x27; &quot;Pod&quot; album), and with Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley, played some shows in 1996 with Primus.

By 1998, Kelley had rejoined and Macpherson had left the group, and by 2000 Lerma and Farley had also left. With a line-up including the Deal sisters and new members Mando Lopez and Jose Medeles, the Breeders released the albums &quot;Title TK&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Mountain Battles&quot; in 2008. Meanwhile Macpherson was a member of Guided by Voices from 1998 to 2001, and participated in other projects with Guided By Voices&#x27; Robert Pollard until 2005. Lerma and Farley have been members of the Tasties, and in 1999 participated in Pollard&#x27;s Lexo and the Leapers side project group; Farley was also a member of Guided by Voices from 1999 to 2004. In 2013, the &quot;Last Splash&quot;-era Breeders line-up of Kim and Kelley Deal, Macpherson, and Wiggs reunited to tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of that album.

<text>Crafty is a chess program written by UAB professor Robert Hyatt, with development and assistance from Michael Byrne, Tracy Riegle, and Peter Skinner. It is derived from Cray Blitz, winner of the 1983 and 1986 World Computer Chess Championships. Tord Romstad, co-author of Stockfish, described Crafty as &quot;arguably the most important and influential chess program ever&quot;.

Crafty finished in second place in the 2010 Fifth Annual ACCA Americas&#x27; Computer Chess Championships. Crafty lost only one game, to the first-place winner, Thinker.

Crafty also finished in second place in the 2010 World Computer Rapid Chess Championships. Crafty won seven out of nine games, finishing behind the first-place winner Rybka by ½ point.

In the World Computer Chess Championships 2004, running on slightly faster hardware than all other programs, Crafty took fourth place with the same number of points as the third-place finisher, Fritz 8. On the November 2007 SSDF ratings list, Crafty was 34th with an estimated Elo rating of 2608.

Crafty uses the Chess Engine Communication Protocol and can run under the chess interfaces XBoard and Winboard.

Crafty is written in ANSI C with assembly language routines available on some CPUs, and is very portable. The source code is available, but the software is for &quot;personal use&quot; only and redistribution is only allowed under certain conditions.

Crafty pioneered the use of rotated bitboard data structures to represent the chess board, and was one of the first chess programs to support multiple processors. It also includes negascout search, the killer move heuristic, static exchange evaluation, quiescence search, alpha-beta pruning, a transposition table, a refutation table, an evaluation cache, selective extensions, recursive null-move search, and many other features. Special editions of the program include enhanced features such as an opening book, positional learning, and an endgame tablebase.

Crafty was one of the programs included in the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark test. It is also included as an additional engine in Fritz.

<text>USS &quot;Mullinnix&quot; (DD-944) was a of the United States Navy. She was named for Admiral Henry M. Mullinnix USN (1892–1943), who was killed in action during World War II, when the aircraft carrier was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine and sank southwest of Butaritari Island on 24 November 1943.

&quot;Mullinnix&quot; was built by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, and launched by Mrs. Kathryn F. Mullinnix.

&quot;Mullinnix&quot; conducted patrol duty in the Caribbean during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, participated in the Gemini program recovery operations in March 1966, and served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in Sea Dragon operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties, and carried out naval gunfire support missions during the Vietnam War.

&quot;Mullinix&quot; and her sister ship appeared in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Thirty-Fathom Grave.&quot;

<doc id="527639" wikidata="Q744667" url="?curid=527639" title="Gemini Observatory">
<text>The Gemini Observatory comprises two 8.1-metre (26.6 ft) telescopes, Gemini North and Gemini South, situated in Hawaii and Chile, respectively. These twin telescopes offer extensive coverage of the northern and southern skies and rank among the most advanced optical/infrared telescopes available to astronomers. &quot;(See List of largest optical reflecting telescopes)&quot;.

The observatory is owned and operated by the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the United States, the National Research Council of Canada, CONICYT of Chile, MCTI of Brazil, MCTIP of Argentina, and Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) of Republic of Korea. The NSF is the primary funding contributor, providing about 70% of the required resources. The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) manages the operations and maintenance of the observatory through a cooperative agreement with the NSF, acting as the Executive Agency on behalf of the international partners. NSF&#x27;s NOIRLab is the US national center for ground-based, nighttime optical astronomy and operates Gemini as one of its programs.

The Gemini telescopes are equipped with modern instruments and excel in optical and near-infrared performance. They utilize adaptive optics technology to counteract atmospheric blurring. Notably, Gemini leads in wide-field adaptive optics assisted infrared imaging and has recently commissioned the Gemini Planet Imager, enabling researchers to directly observe and study exoplanets with extreme faintness compared to their host stars. Gemini supports research across various domains of modern astronomy, including the Solar System, exoplanets, star formation and evolution, galaxy structure and dynamics, supermassive black holes, distant quasars, and the structure of the Universe on large scales.

Previously, Australia and the United Kingdom were also involved in the Gemini Observatory partnership. However, the UK withdrew its funding at the end of 2012. In response, the observatory has significantly reduced operating costs, streamlined operations, and implemented energy-saving measures at both sites. Additionally, both telescopes are now operated remotely from Base Facility Operations centers located in Hilo, Hawaii, and La Serena, Chile. In 2018, KASI has signed an agreement to become a full participant of the Gemini Observatory.

== Overview ==

The Gemini Observatory&#x27;s international Headquarters and Northern Operations Center is located in Hilo, Hawaii at the University of Hawaii at Hilo University Park. The Southern Operations Center is located on the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) campus near La Serena, Chile.

* The &quot;Gemini North&quot; telescope, officially called the &quot;Frederick C. Gillett Gemini Telescope&quot; is located on Hawaii&#x27;s Mauna Kea, along with many other telescopes. That location provides excellent viewing conditions due to the superb atmospheric conditions (stable, dry, and rarely cloudy) above the dormant volcano. It saw first light in 1999 and began scientific operations in 2000.

* The &quot;Gemini South&quot; telescope is located at over elevation on a mountain in the Chilean Andes called Cerro Pachón. Very dry air and negligible cloud cover make this another prime telescope location (again shared by several other observatories, including the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory). Gemini South saw first light in 2000.

Together, the two telescopes cover almost all of the sky except for two areas near the celestial poles: Gemini North cannot point north of declination +89 degrees, and Gemini South cannot point south of declination −89 degrees.

Both Gemini telescopes employ a range of technologies to provide world-leading performance in optical and near-infrared astronomy, including laser guide stars, adaptive optics, multi conjugate adaptive optics, and multi-object spectroscopy. In addition, very high-quality infrared observations are possible due to the advanced protected silver coating applied to each telescope&#x27;s mirrors, the small secondary mirrors in use (resulting in an f16 focal ratio), and the advanced ventilation systems installed at each site.

== History ==
It is estimated that the two telescopes cost approximately US$187 million to construct, and a night on each Gemini telescope is worth tens of thousands of U.S. dollars.

The two 8-meter mirror blanks, each weighing over , were fabricated from Corning&#x27;s Ultra Low Expansion glass. Each blank was constructed by the fusing together of and subsequent sagging of a series of smaller hexagonal pieces. This work was performed at Corning&#x27;s Canton Plant facility located in upstate New York. The blanks were then transported via ship to REOSC, located south of Paris for final grinding and polishing.

One decision made during design to save money was eliminating the two Nasmyth platforms. This makes instruments like high resolution spectrographs and adaptive optics systems much more difficult to construct, due to the size and mass requirement inherent with Cassegrain instruments. A further challenge in designing large instruments is the requirement to have a specific mass and center-of-mass position to maintain the overall balance of the telescope.

=== UK funding crisis ===
In November 2007 it was announced that the UK&#x27;s Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) had proposed that, to save £4 million annually, it would aim to leave the telescope&#x27;s operating consortium. At a consortium meeting in January 2008, the conclusion was made that the UK would officially withdraw from the Gemini Partnership and the Gemini Observatory Agreement effective February 28, 2007. This decision significantly disrupted observatory budgets, and resulted in the cancellation of at least one instrument in development at that time, the Precision Radial Velocity Spectrograph.

Since the reason for the UK breaking its part of the agreement seemed to be entirely financial, there was public outcry, including the &quot;Save Astronomy&quot; movement which asked citizens to speak up against the astronomy budget cuts. The UK rethought their decision to withdraw from Gemini, and requested reinstatement into the agreement, and were officially welcomed back on February 27, 2008. However, in December 2009 it was announced that the UK would indeed leave the Gemini partnership in 2012, as well as terminating several other international science partnerships, due to continuing funding limitations.

== Directorship ==
The first director of Gemini was Matt Mountain, who after holding the post for eleven years left in September 2005 to become director of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). He was succeeded by Jean-René Roy, who served for nine months, after which time Doug Simons held the directorship from June 2006 to May 2011. He in turn was succeeded by an interim appointment of the then-retired Fred Chaffee, former director of W. M. Keck Observatory. Chaffee was succeeded in August 2012 by Markus Kissler-Patig, who held the post until June 2017. Laura Ferrarese succeeded Kissler-Patig in July 2017 with an interim appointment. Jennifer Lotz took over as the directory on September 6, 2018, but left in 2024 to begin a 5 year appointment as Director of STScI. She was replaced by Scott Dahm as an interim director in January 2024.

== Governance and oversight ==
The Observatory is governed by the Gemini Board, as defined by the Gemini International Agreement. The Board sets budgetary policy bounds for the Observatory and carries out broad oversight functions, with advice from a Science and Technology Advisory sub-Committee (the STAC) and a Finance sub-Committee. The U.S. holds six of the 13 voting seats on the Gemini Board. The U.S. members of the Board typically serve three year terms and are recruited and nominated by the National Science Foundation (NSF), which represents the US community in all aspects of Gemini operations and development. Gemini is currently managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., on behalf of the partnership through an award from NSF. AURA has operated Gemini since its construction in the 1990s.

NSF serves as the Executive Agency and acts on behalf of the international participants. NSF has one seat on the Gemini Board; an additional NSF staff member serves as the Executive Secretary to the board. Programmatic management is the responsibility of an NSF Program Officer. The Program Officer monitors operations and development activities at the Observatory, nominates U.S. scientists to Gemini advisory committees, conducts reviews on behalf of the partnership, and approves funding actions, reports, and contracts.

== Instrumentation ==
=== Adaptive optics ===
Both Gemini telescopes employ sophisticated state-of-the-art adaptive optics systems. Gemini-N routinely uses the ALTAIR system, built in Canada, which achieves a 30–45% Strehl ratio on a 22.5-arcsecond-square field and can feed NIRI, NIFS or GNIRS; it can use natural or laser guide stars. In conjunction with NIRI it was responsible for the discovery of HR8799b.

At Gemini-S the Gemini Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics System (GeMS) may be used with the FLAMINGOS-2 near-infrared imager and spectrometry, or the Gemini South Adaptive Optics Imager (GSAOI), which provides uniform, diffraction-limited image quality to arcminute-scale fields of view. GeMS achieved first light on December 16, 2011. Using a constellation of five laser guide stars, it achieved FWHM of 0.08 arc-seconds in H band over a field of 87 arc-seconds square.

An adaptive secondary mirror has been considered for Gemini, which would provide reasonable adaptive-optics corrections (equivalent to natural seeing at the 20th-percentile level for 80% of the time) to all instruments on the telescope to which it is attached. However, , there are no plans to implement such an upgrade to either telescope.

=== Instruments ===



In recent years the Gemini Board has directed the observatory to support only four instruments at each telescope. Because Gemini-N and Gemini-S are essentially identical, the observatory is able to move instruments between the two sites, and does so on a regular basis. Two of the most popular instruments are the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) on each of the telescopes. Built in Edinburgh, Scotland by the UK Astronomy Technology Centre, these instruments provide multi-object spectroscopy, long-slit spectroscopy, imaging, and integral field spectroscopy at optical wavelengths. The detectors in each instrument have recently been upgraded with Hamamatsu Photonics devices, which significantly improve performance in the far red part of the optical spectrum (700–1,000 nm).

Near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy are provided by the NIRI, NIFS, GNIRS, FLAMINGOS-2, and GSAOI instruments. The availability and detailed descriptions of these instruments is documented on the Gemini Observatory Web site.

One of the most exciting new instruments at Gemini is GPI, the Gemini Planet Imager. GPI was built by a consortium of US and Canadian institutions to fulfill the requirements of the ExAOC Extreme Adaptive Optics Coronagraph proposal. GPI is an extreme adaptive-optics imaging polarimeter/integral-field spectrometer, which provides diffraction-limited data between 0.9 and 2.4 microns. GPI is able to directly image planets around nearby stars that are one-millionth as bright as their host star.

Gemini also supports a vigorous visitor instrument program. Instruments may be brought to either telescope for short periods of time and used for specific observing programs by the instrument teams. In return for access to Gemini, the instruments are then made available to the entire Gemini community, so that they may be used for other science projects. Instruments that have made use of this program include the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI), the Phoenix near-infrared echelle spectrometer, and the TEXES mid-infrared spectrometer. The ESPaDOnS spectrograph situated in the basement of the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) is also being used as a &quot;visitor instrument&quot;, even though it never moves from CFHT. The instrument is connected to Gemini-North via a 270 meter long optic fibre. Known as GRACES, this arrangement provides very high resolution optical spectroscopy on an 8-meter class telescope.

Gemini&#x27;s silver coating and infrared optimization allow sensitive observations in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum (5–27 μm). Historically, mid-infrared observations have been obtained using T-ReCS at Gemini South and Michelle at Gemini North. Both instruments have imaging and spectroscopic capabilities, though neither is currently being used at Gemini.

=== Instrumentation development issues ===
The first phase of Gemini instrumentation development did not run smoothly; schedules slipped by several years, and budgets sometimes overran by as much as a factor of two. In 2003 the instrument-development process was re-analysed in the Aspen report; for example, an incentive program was introduced where instrument developers were guaranteed substantial allocations of telescope time if they delivered the instrument on time and lose it as the instrument is delayed.

A wide-field multi-object spectrograph achieved substantial scientific support, but would have required major changes to the design of the telescope – effectively it would have required one of the telescopes to be devoted to that instrument. The project was terminated in 2009.

=== Second-round instrumentation development ===
In January 2012, the Gemini Observatory started a new round of instrumentation development. This process has since resulted in the development of a high-resolution optical spectrograph known as GHOST, with commissioning beginning in April 2022 and on-sky science commissioning planned for June 2022.

== Observing and community support ==

The Gemini Observatory&#x27;s primary mission is to serve the general astronomical communities in all of the participant countries; indeed, the Observatory provides the bulk of general access to large optical/infrared telescopes for many of the participants, and represents the only public-access 8 meter class facility in the U.S. The observatory reaches out to its community through National Gemini Offices (NGOs), the U.S. office being located in Tucson at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory. The NGOs provide general support to the users, from proposal preparation through data acquisition, reduction, and analysis.

In any given year the two telescopes typically provided data for over 400 discrete science projects, over two-thirds of which are led by U.S. astronomers. About 50-70 percent of the top-ranked &quot;Band 1&quot; proposals reach 100 percent completion in any given year. Of order 90 percent of the available (clear weather) time is used for science, the rest being allocated to scheduled maintenance or lost to unforeseen technical faults.

Gemini has in recent years developed innovative new observing modes. These include the ‘Large and Long’ program to support requests for large amounts of telescope time and the ‘Fast Turnaround’ program to provide quick access to the telescope. These and other modes have been approved by the Gemini Board of Directors and are proving popular with the user community. In 2015 up to 20 percent of available telescope time was used for Large and Long programs, which in terms of hours of observing attracted five times more user demand than could be accommodated. In the same period approximately 10 percent of telescope time was assigned to the Fast Turnaround program, which in the second half of 2015 was over-subscribed by a factor of 1.6. In 2015 the remaining U.S. time allocation on Gemini was over-subscribed by a factor of approximately 2, consistent with recent years.

== Prospects (2017 onwards) ==

In 2010, the U.S. National Research Council (NRC) conducted its sixth decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics to recommend key science questions and new initiatives for the current decade. Since both the NRC recommendations and current programs could not be accommodated within subsequent budget projections, the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Division of Astronomical Sciences, through the Advisory Committee of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), conducted a community-based portfolio review to make implementation recommendations that would best respond to the decadal survey science questions. The resulting report, Advancing Astronomy in the Coming Decade: Opportunities and Challenges, was released in August 2012 and included recommendations related to all of the major telescope facilities funded by NSF. The Portfolio Review Committee report ranked Gemini Observatory as a critical component of the U.S.&#x27;s future astronomical research resources and recommended that the U.S. retain a majority share in the international partnership for at least the next several years. However, given the constraints that were considered, the Committee recommended that the U.S. contribution to Gemini operations be capped in 2017 and beyond.

NSF has since commissioned a National Research Council study, titled &quot;A Strategy to Optimize the U.S. Optical/Infrared System in the Era of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope&quot;. The report made a recommendation that NSF work with its partners in Gemini to ensure that Gemini-South is well positioned for faint-object spectroscopy early in the era of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Observatory support for the development of a next-generation medium-resolution spectrograph over the next 5–6 years addresses this recommendation directly.

With the signing of the new International Agreement in late 2015, support from the five signatories (the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile) is secured for the period 2016–2021. Australia withdrew from the Gemini Observatory partnership in 2015, and Korea has joined the partnership in 2018. The currently effective International Agreement signed in 2020 November has the six signatories (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Korea, and the US), and the Agreement is effective till the end of 2026.

==Observations and research==
The Gemini was one of the telescopes that observed the turn-on of a nuclear transient, along with the Swift space telescope (aka Neil Gehrels &quot;Swift&quot; Observatory since 2018) and the Hiltner telescope (MDM observatory). The transient event was called PS1-13cbe and was located in the Galaxy SDSS J222153.87+003054.2 

==Incidents==

On 22 October 2022, the 8.1m primary mirror of the Gemini North telescope was damaged when it touched an earthquake restraint while on a wash cart, being moved for stripping the silver coating before recoating. Two chips were created, on the bottom edge and at the margin of the main mirror. This has since been repaired after several months of downtime and was back observing the sky on 2 June 2023 with apparently no loss of performance or quality.

<doc id="527640" wikidata="Q1137001" url="?curid=527640" title="Coulter pine">
<text>Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri), or big-cone pine, is a conifer in the genus &quot;Pinus&quot; of the family Pinaceae. Coulter pine is an evergreen conifer that lives up to 100 years. It is a native of the coastal mountains of Southern California in the United States and northern Baja California in Mexico, occurring in mediterranean climates, where winter rains are infrequent and summers are dry with occasional thunderstorms. Isolated groves are found as far north as Clearlake, California, on the flanks of Mt. Konocti and in Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve. Although geographically isolated, these Coulter pine populations were very similar in all of three studies of morphological characteristics. Oleoresins (volatile portions) were also similar.

While the species has a limited range in the wild, the Coulter pine is a popular ornamental tree and is grown in many countries. 

Coulter pine (&quot;Pinus coulteri&quot;) is named after Thomas Coulter, an Irish botanist and physician. The Coulter pine produces some of the heaviest cones of any pine tree, up to ; among conifers, these are exceeded only by the cones of &quot;Araucaria bidwillii&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus coulteri&quot; is a substantial coniferous evergreen tree in the genus &quot;Pinus&quot;. The size ranges from tall, with a trunk diameter up to . The trunk is vertical and branches horizontal to upcurved. The bark is dark gray-brown to near black, deeply furrowed, with long, scaly, irregularly anastomosing, rounded ridges. The crown is pyramidal and may be dense or open, depending upon the site. The leaves are needle-like, in bundles of three, glaucous gray-green in color, long, and stout, thick.

The exemplary characteristic of this tree is the large, spiny cones, which are long (occasionally as much as length has been observed) and in width, and weigh when fresh. Each segment, or &quot;scale&quot;, of the cone is tipped with a talon-like hook. Although the slender cones of the sugar pine are longer, Coulter pines produce the largest cones of any pine species, and people are advised to wear hardhats when working in Coulter pine groves. The large size of the cones, combined with the claw-like scales, has earned them the nickname &quot;widowmakers&quot; among locals. Seed cones mature in two years, gradually shedding seeds thereafter, and are moderately persistent, massive, heavy, drooping, asymmetric at the base, narrowly ovoid before opening, ovoid-cylindric when open, long, pale yellow-brown in color, and resinous, with stalks to . The apophyses are transverse-rhombic, strongly and sharply cross-keeled, elongate, curved, and continuous with umbos to form long, upcurved claws . The seeds are obovoid in shape, dark brown in color, and the body long, with a wing to .

== Taxonomy ==
The name &quot;Pinus coulteri&quot; comes from Latin for pine, and &quot;coulteri&quot; comes from its discoverer Thomas Coulter (1793–1843), an Irish botanist and physician. &quot;Pinus coulteri&quot; was discovered by Coulter on the mountains of Santa Lucia, near the Mission of San Antonio, at latitude 36°, within sight of the ocean and at an elevation between 3000 and 4000 feet above sea level. It was growing intermingled with &quot;Pinus Lambertiana&quot;. 

This is a member of subsection Ponderosae, and is generally recognized as closely related (morphologically, geographically, and genetically) to &quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot;, &quot;P.&#x27;torreyana&quot;, and &quot;P. jeffreyi&quot;; the three taxa form group Sabinianae Loudon 1838 (&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot;, though morphologically a bit different, is known to hybridize with &quot;P.&#x27;coulteri&quot;, and molecular analysis clearly places it in the Sabinianae). &quot;P. coulteri&quot;, alone in the Sabinianae, also shares a chloroplast haplotype with &quot;P. arizonica&quot; of the northern Sierra Madre. It seems likely that the species arose through a hybridization event involving two members of subsection Ponderosae.

== Distribution and habitats ==
Coulter pine is most frequent on steep south-facing slopes and ridges. Soils may be poor to fertile, and are typically dry. Coulter pine is an indicator of serpentine soils, but also occurs on a variety of other substrates.  Soils range from loamy to gravelly or rocky in texture. Coulter pine occurs at elevation. 

Coulter pine is the dominant species in the following published classifications: Terrestrial natural communities of California, Vegetation types of the San Bernadino Mountains, Vegetation of the San Bernadino Mountains, A vegetation classification system applied to southern California, Mixed evergreen forest, Vascular plant communities of California, Montane and subalpine forests of the Transverse and Peninsular ranges.

==Ecology==
The Coulter pine is closely related to the foothill pine, &quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot;. It is more distantly related to Jeffrey pine, with which it shares habitats, and the ponderosa pine. Coulter pines tend to grow in drier environments than ponderosa and Jeffery pines.

This erect, medium-sized pine prefers south-facing slopes from elevation, and tolerates dry rocky soil. &quot;Pinus coulteri&quot; most often appears in mixed forests. The Coulter pine occurs in a number of forest plant associations; for example, at higher elevations forestation of the San Jacinto Mountains Coulter Pine is co-dominant with the California black oak. Woodpeckers often forage on the species, and peel the bark to access insects underneath.

==Uses==
Wildlife, especially squirrels, gather the large seeds. The seeds were also once eaten by Native Americans.

The wood is weak and soft, so that the species is little used other than for firewood.

&quot;Pinus coulteri&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental tree, planted in parks and large gardens, and used in drought-tolerant landscaping. The Coulter pine has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="527647" wikidata="Q2469684" url="?curid=527647" title="USS Hull (DD-945)">
<text>USS &quot;Hull&quot; (DD-945), named for Commodore Isaac Hull USN (1773 to 1843), was a &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyer built by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath in Maine. Laid down on 12 September 1956 and launched 10 August 1957, by Mrs. Albert G. Mumma.

==History==
She was commissioned 3 July 1958 and transited the Panama Canal a few months later to begin a long career with the Pacific Fleet. Between April and August 1959 &quot;Hull&quot; conducted the first of her fifteen deployments to serve with the Seventh Fleet in the Western Pacific. She made three more cruises in that area in 1960, 1961–1962 and 1963–1964. During October and November 1962 the destroyer escorted Pacific-based amphibious forces to the Panama Canal Zone as part of the US Navy&#x27;s Cuban Missile Crisis operations. &quot;Hull&#x27;s&quot; 1965 Seventh Fleet tour was the first of six Vietnam War deployments, during which she fired tens of thousands of five-inch shells in support of forces ashore and helped rescue several downed U.S. aviators. Additionally, &quot;Hull&quot; served as plane guard for carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in Operation Sea Dragon operations, and patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out Naval Gunfire Support missions during the Vietnam War.

&quot;Hull&quot; made her eleventh WestPac cruise in 1973, after the direct U.S. role in the Vietnam War had ended.

During her major overhaul in 1974–75, her forward 5 in/54 Mark 42 gun mount was replaced with an 8 in/55 Mark 71 gun mount. This Major Caliber Lightweight Gun (&quot;MCLWG&quot;) was the result of a project dating back to the 1960s, when it was realized that heavy gunfire support for amphibious operations would die with the existing force of heavy cruisers unless a big gun could be developed for destroyer-size ships. A prototype gun and mounting had been built and tested ashore during the early 1970s. &quot;Hull&quot; was its test ship for seagoing trials, after which it was expected that several of these guns would be installed on board destroyers of the new Spruance class.

&quot;Hull&#x27;s&quot; eight-inch gun began firing tests in April 1975. These lasted into the following year, and were reportedly successful. The ship carried the Mark 71 mounting during her 1976-77 and 1978 deployments to the Western Pacific, and conducted more firing tests during that time. However, the MCLWG project was cancelled in 1978. The prototype gun was removed from &quot;Hull&quot; during her 1979-80 overhaul and she spent the rest of her days with the three five-inch gun mounts that were typical of her class.

In February–September 1981 &quot;Hull&quot; served again in Asian waters. She began her final deployment in September 1982, steaming to the Western Pacific by way of Alaska, rescuing five Vietnamese refugees at sea in October and then moving further west to serve in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea as part of the battle group built around the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

==Fate==
Returning to the United States West Coast in April 1983, &quot;Hull&quot; immediately commenced inactivation preparations. She was decommissioned on 11 July 1983 and stricken on 15 October 1983. During a weapon and tactics test, she was sunk on 7 April 1998. The test was designed around a Harpoon missile fired from a Lockheed S-3B Viking, but many different weapons were used throughout the exercise. Her final resting place is at a depth of .

<text>USS &quot;Edson&quot; (DD-946) is a , formerly of the United States Navy, built by Bath Iron Works in Maine in 1958. Her home port was Long Beach, California and she initially served in the Western Pacific/Far East, operating particularly in the Taiwan Strait and off the coast of Vietnam. Her exceptionally meritorious service in 1964 in the Gulf of Tonkin was recognized with the first of three Navy Unit Commendations. During the following years she was shelled by North Vietnamese land forces, and apparently received friendly fire from the US Air Force.

Following an onboard fire in 1974, &quot;Edson&quot; returned to the West Pacific and was later commended for her roles in the evacuation of Phnom Penh and Saigon.

She was decommissioned in 1988, but the following year became a museum ship at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York. Returning to Navy lay-up in 2004, it was agreed in 2012 that she should again become a museum ship, at Bay City, Michigan. A National Historic Landmark, she is one of only two surviving &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyers, the other being the .

==Commissioning and initial service==
USS &quot;Edson&quot; was named for Major General Merritt &quot;Red Mike&quot; Edson USMC (1897–1955), who was awarded the Medal of Honor (while serving as Commanding Officer of the First Marine Raider Battalion on Guadalcanal) and the Navy Cross and Silver Star for other actions in World War II.

&quot;Edson&quot; was laid down on 3 December 1956 by Bath Iron Works Corporation and launched on 4 January 1958, sponsored by Mrs. M. A. Edson, widow of General Edson; and commissioned on 7 November 1958.

&quot;Edson&quot; called at Ciudad Trujillo and Caribbean ports while conducting shakedown training en route to Callao, Peru, where she lay from 18 to 21 February 1959 delivering supplies for the U.S. Embassy in Lima, Peru. She reached Naval Station Long Beach, California, her home port, on 2 March, and through the remainder of the year perfected her readiness with exercises along the west coast. On 5 January 1960, she sailed from Long Beach for her first deployment in the Far East, during which she patrolled in the Taiwan Straits and took part in amphibious operations off Okinawa, and exercises of various types off Japan. On 29 April, she rescued three aviators from , whose A-3D aircraft crash landed in the ocean. &quot;Edson&quot; returned to Long Beach on 31 May for an which continued through October. &quot;Edson&quot; spent the remainder of 1960 conducting training off San Diego.
==WESTPAC deployments==
In June 1961 &quot;Edson&quot;, together with the other ships of DESDIV 231, sailed to Portland, Oregon, to represent the U.S. Navy at the annual Rose Festival. On 11 August 1961, &quot;Edson&quot; sailed from Long Beach harbor to start her second WESTPAC deployment. She spent three months in operations with the attack carriers USS &quot;Ranger&quot; and USS &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and spent the month of December patrolling the straits between Taiwan and the mainland of Communist China.

On Friday, 13 March 1964, &quot;Edson&quot; departed for her third WESTPAC deployment. After the transit, &quot;Edson&quot; began duties with the Taiwan Patrol Force, CTF 72. The end of May and the months of June and July 1964 were filled with carrier operations, Gunfire Support Training in the Philippines, and operation LICTAS, a joint SEATO operation off the coast of the Philippines. August found &quot;Edson&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin on special operations. It was here she was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service in support of operations in the Gulf of Tonkin during the period 2–5 August 1964. On her fifth deployment in 1967, she received a hit from a North Vietnamese shore battery while providing a naval gunfire support mission.

&quot;Edson&quot; served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in Sea Dragon operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties, and carried out Naval Gunfire Support missions during the Vietnam War. On 17 June 1968 she apparently took friendly fire from the US Air Force, along with several other U.S. and Australian ships.

On 12 December 1974, &quot;Edson&quot; suffered a fire in the after fireroom while training with . The fire was caused by the ignition of oil which was spraying from a rupture in a lube oil gauge line. The area was secured and fire extinguished with no personnel casualties.

In January 1975, after repairs in Hawaii, &quot;Edson&quot; continued on to WESTPAC and in April she participated in Operation Eagle Pull (evacuation of Phnom Penh, Cambodia) and Operation Frequent Wind (evacuation of Saigon, Vietnam), earning two Meritorious Unit Commendations.

&quot;Edson&quot; was decommissioned on 15 December 1988, and towed to the Philadelphia Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility for storage. At the time of her decommissioning, she was the last all-gun destroyer in the United States Navy.

==Museum==

&quot;Edson&quot; served as a museum ship at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York City from 30 June 1989 to 14 June 2004 when she was replaced by a Concorde airliner. The ship was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1990.

In 2004 the ship was towed to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where hull repairs were completed, and then towed back to the Philadelphia Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility for storage. The Saginaw Valley Naval Ship Museum at Bay City, Michigan, and the Wisconsin Naval Ship Association at Sheboygan, Wisconsin, both submitted applications to the Naval Sea Systems Command to relocate &quot;Edson&quot; and reinstate her as a museum ship in their respective locations. The Bay City proposal was successful.

The Navy declared USS &quot;Edson&quot; seaworthy on 17 July 2012 and she was cleared to begin her journey to Michigan on 18 July with arrival at the museum site on 7 August 2012. After roughly a year at a temporary mooring at Wirt Stone docks, she was floated up the Saginaw river to her permanent mooring site, and on Tuesday, 7 May 2013 at 15:01 hours, USS &quot;Edson&quot; arrived at her permanent mooring site in Bangor Township, Michigan, at .

<text>Shoshoni, also written as Shoshoni-Gosiute and Shoshone ( ; Shoshoni: soni&quot;&#x27; ta̲i̲kwappe&quot;, &quot;newe ta̲i̲kwappe&quot; or &quot;neme ta̲i̲kwappeh&quot;), is a Numic language of the Uto-Aztecan family, spoken in the Western United States by the Shoshone people. Shoshoni is primarily spoken in the Great Basin, in areas of Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and Idaho.

The consonant inventory of Shoshoni is rather small, but a much wider range of surface forms of these phonemes appear in the spoken language. The language has six vowels, distinguished by length. Shoshoni is a strongly suffixing language, and it inflects for nominal number and case and for verbal aspect and tense using suffixes. Word order is relatively free but shows a preference toward SOV order.

The endonyms &quot;newe ta̲i̲kwappe&quot; and &quot;Sosoni&#x27; ta̲i̲kwappe&quot; mean &quot;the people&#x27;s language&quot; and &quot;the Shoshoni language,&quot; respectively. Shoshoni is classified as threatened, although attempts at revitalization are underway.

==Classification and dialects==
Shoshoni is the northernmost member of the large Uto-Aztecan language family, which includes nearly sixty living languages, spoken in the Western United States down through Mexico and into El Salvador. Shoshoni belongs to the Numic subbranch of Uto-Aztecan. The word &quot;Numic&quot; comes from the cognate word in all Numic languages for &quot;person&quot;. For example, in Shoshoni the word is &quot;neme&quot; or, depending on the dialect, &quot;newe&quot; , in Timbisha it is &quot;nümü&quot; , and in Southern Paiute, &quot;nuwuvi&quot; .

Shoshoni&#x27;s closest relatives are the Central Numic languages Timbisha and Comanche. Timbisha, or Panamint, is spoken in southeastern California by members of the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, but it is considered a distinct language from Shoshoni. The Comanche split from the Shoshone around 1700, and consonant changes over the past few centuries have limited mutual intelligibility of Comanche and Shoshoni.

Principal dialects of Shoshoni are Western Shoshoni in Nevada, Gosiute in western Utah, Northern Shoshoni in southern Idaho and northern Utah, and Eastern Shoshoni in Wyoming. The main differences between these dialects are phonological.

==Status==
The number of people who speak Shoshoni has been steadily dwindling since the late 20th century. In the early 21st century, fluent speakers number only several hundred to a few thousand people, while an additional population of about 1,000 know the language to some degree but are not fluent. The Duck Valley and Gosiute communities have established programs to teach the language to their children. Ethnologue lists Shoshoni as &quot;threatened&quot; as it notes that many of the speakers are 50 and older. UNESCO has classified the Shoshoni language as &quot;severely endangered&quot; in Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming. The language is still being taught to children in a small number of isolated locations. The tribes have a strong interest in language revitalization, but efforts to preserve the language are scattered, with little coordination. However, literacy in Shoshoni is increasing. Shoshoni dictionaries have been published and portions of the Bible were translated in 1986.

As of 2012, Idaho State University offers elementary, intermediate, and conversational Shoshoni language classes, in a 20-year project to preserve the language. Open-source Shosoni audio is available online to complement classroom instruction, as part of the university&#x27;s long-standing Shoshoni Language Project.

The Shoshone-Bannock Tribe teaches Shoshoni to its children and adults as part of its Language and Culture Preservation Program. On the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, elders have been active in digital language archiving. Shoshoni is taught using Dr. Steven Greymorning&#x27;s Accelerated Second Language Acquisition techniques.

A summer program known as the Shoshone/Goshute Youth Language Apprenticeship Program (SYLAP), held at the University of Utah&#x27;s Center for American Indian Languages since 2009, has been featured on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition.&quot; Shoshoni youth serve as interns, assisting with digitization of Shoshoni language recordings and documentation from the Wick R. Miller collection, in order to make the materials available for tribal members. The program released the first Shoshone language video game in August 2013.

In July 2012, Blackfoot High School in Southeastern Idaho announced it would offer Shoshoni language classes. The Chief Tahgee Elementary Academy, a Shoshone-Bannock charter school teaching English and Shoshoni, opened at Fort Hall in 2013.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Shoshoni has a typical Numic vowel inventory of five vowels. In addition, there is the common diphthong , which functions as a simple vowel and varies rather freely with ; however, certain morphemes always contain and others always contain . All vowels occur as short or long, but / is rare.

===Consonants===
Shoshoni has a typical Numic consonant inventory.
=== Syllable structure ===
Shoshoni syllables are of the form (C)V(V)(C). For instance: &quot;nɨkka&quot; &quot;dance&quot; (CVC CV), &quot;ɨkkoi&quot; &quot;sleep&quot; (VC CVV), and &quot;paa&quot; &quot;water&quot; (CVV). Shoshoni does not allow onset clusters.

Typical Shoshoni roots are of the form CV(V)CV(V). Examples include &quot;kasa&quot; &quot;wing&quot; and &quot;papi&quot; &quot;older brother.&quot;

=== Stress ===
Stress in Shoshoni is regular but not distinctive. Primary stress usually falls on the first syllable (more specifically, the first mora) of a word; however, primary stress tends to fall on the second syllable if that syllable is long. For instance, &quot;natsattamahkantɨn&quot; [ˈnazattamaxandɨ] &quot;tied up&quot; bears primary stress on the first syllable; however, &quot;kottoohkwa&quot; &quot;made a fire&quot; bears primary stress on the second syllable, with long vowel , instead of the first syllable with short vowel .

As in other Numic languages, stress in Shoshoni is distributed based on mora-counting. Short Shoshoni vowels have one mora, while long vowels and vowel clusters ending in have two morae. Following the primary stress, every other mora receives secondary stress. If stress falls on the second mora in a long vowel, the stress is transferred to the first mora in the long vowel and mora counting continues from there. For example, &quot;natsattamahkantɨn&quot; &quot;tied up&quot; bears the stress pattern , with stress falling on every other mora.

With some dialectical variation, mora counting resets at the border between stems in compound words. Final syllables need not be stressed and may undergo optional final vowel devoicing.

=== Phonological processes ===
Given here are a few examples of regular, well-documented phonological rules in Shoshoni:

* Short, unclustered, unstressed vowels, when part of final syllables and followed by , are devoiced. These same vowels, when preceded by , are usually devoiced. These processes represent Shoshoni &quot;organic devoicing.&quot; For instance, &quot;tɨkkahkwan&quot; → &quot;ate up&quot;.
* Final vowels may be devoiced optionally, representing Shoshoni &quot;inorganic devoicing.&quot; If the final vowel is devoiced, the long or short consonant preceding it is also devoiced. Thus, &quot;kammu&quot; → &quot;jackrabbit&quot;.
* Stops, affricates, and nasals are voiced and lenited between vowels. The stops and affricate become voiced fricatives; the nasals become nasalized glides. Thus &quot;papi&quot; → &quot;brother&quot;, &quot;tatsa&quot; → &quot;summer,&quot; and &quot;imaa&quot; → &quot;tomorrow&quot;.
* Stops, affricates, and nasals are lenited, but remain unvoiced, when they are preceded by underlying . This is deleted in the surface form. Thus, &quot;paikkahkwa&quot; → &quot;killed&quot;.
* Stops, affricates, and nasals are voiced when part of an intervocalic nasal cluster. Thus, &quot;pampi&quot; → &quot;head&quot; and &quot;wantsi&quot; → &quot;antelope&quot;.

==Morphology==
Shoshoni is a synthetic, agglutinative language, in which words, especially verbs, tend to be complex with several morphemes strung together. Shoshoni is a primarily suffixing language.

=== Nouns ===

==== Absolutive suffixes ====
Many nouns in Shoshoni have an absolutive suffix (unrelated to the absolutive case). The absolutive suffix is normally dropped when the noun is the first element in a compound, when the noun is followed by a suffix or postposition, or when the noun is incorporated into a verb. For instance, the independent noun &quot;sɨhɨpin&quot; &quot;willow&quot; has the absolutive suffix &quot;-pin&quot;; the root loses this suffix in the form &quot;sɨhɨykwi&quot; &quot;to gather willows&quot;. The correlation between any particular noun stem and which of the seven absolutive suffixes it has is irregular and unpredictable. The absolutive suffixes are as follows:

* &quot;-pin&quot;
* &quot;-ppɨh&quot;
* &quot;-ppɨ&quot;
* &quot;-pittsih, -pittsɨh&quot;
* &quot;-mpih&quot;
* &quot;-pai&quot;
* &quot;-ttsih&quot;

==== Number and case ====
Shoshoni is a nominative-accusative language. Shoshoni nouns inflect for three cases (subjective, objective, and possessive) and for three numbers (singular, dual, and plural).

Number is marked by suffixes on all human nouns and optionally on other animate nouns. The regular suffixes for number are listed in the table below. The Shoshoni singular is unmarked.

Case is also marked by suffixes, which vary depending on the noun. Subjective case is unmarked. Many nouns also have a zero objective case marker; other possible objective markers are &quot;-tta&quot;, &quot;-a&quot;, and &quot;-i&quot;. These suffixes correspond with the possessive case markers &quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-ttan&quot; or &quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-an&quot;, or &quot;-n&quot; (in Western Shoshoni; this last suffix also appears as &quot;-an&quot; in Gosiute and is replaced by &quot;-in&quot; in Northern Shoshoni). These case markers can be predicted only to a degree based on phonology of the noun stem.

==== Derivational morphology ====
Nominal derivational morphology is also often achieved through suffixing. For instance, the instrumental suffix &quot;-(n)nompɨh&quot; is used with verb stems to form nouns used for the purpose of the verb: &quot;katɨnnompɨh&quot; &quot;chair&quot; is derived from &quot;katɨ&quot; &quot;sit&quot;; &quot;puinompɨh&quot; &quot;binoculars&quot; is derived from &quot;pui&quot; &quot;see&quot;. The characterization suffix &quot;-kantɨn&quot; be used with a root noun to derive a noun characterized by the root: &quot;hupiakantɨn&quot; &quot;singer&quot; is derived from &quot;hupia&quot; &quot;song&quot;; &quot;puhakantɨn&quot; &quot;shaman&quot; is derived from &quot;puha&quot; &quot;power&quot;, as one characterized by power.

=== Verbs ===

==== Number ====
Shoshoni verbs may mark for number, mainly through reduplication or suppletion. The dual is commonly marked through reduplication of the first syllable of the verb stem, so that singular &quot;kimma&quot; &quot;come&quot; becomes &quot;kikimma&quot; in the dual (and remains &quot;kima&quot; in the plural). A suppletive form is often used for the dual or plural forms of the verb; for instance, singular &quot;yaa&quot; &quot;carry&quot; becomes &quot;hima&quot; in both the dual and plural. Suppletion and reduplication frequently work in tandem to express number: singular &quot;nukki&quot; &quot;run&quot; becomes the reduplicated &quot;nunukki&quot; in the dual and the suppleted &quot;nutaa&quot; in the plural; singular &quot;yɨtsɨ&quot; &quot;fly&quot; is reduplicated, suppleted dual &quot;yoyoti&quot; and suppleted plural &quot;yoti&quot;.

==== Instrumental prefixes ====
Shoshoni uses prefixes to add a specific instrumental element to a verb. For instance, the instrumental prefix &quot;to&quot;-&quot; &quot;with the hand or fist&quot; can be used with the verb &quot;tsima&quot; &quot;scrape&quot; to yield &quot;tottsima&quot; &quot;wipe,&quot; as in &quot;pɨn puihkatti tottsimma yakaitɨn&quot; &quot;he wiped at his eyes, crying&quot;.

Common instrumental prefixes include:

* &quot;kɨ&quot;-&quot; &quot;with the teeth or mouth&quot;
* &quot;ku&quot;-&quot; &quot;by heat&quot;
* &quot;ma-&quot; &quot;with a non-grasping hand&quot;
* &quot;mu&quot;-&quot; &quot;with the nose or front of body&quot;
* &quot;ni&quot;-&quot; &quot;with the voice&quot;
* &quot;pi&quot;-&quot; &quot;with the buttocks or back of body&quot;
* &quot;sɨ&quot;-&quot; &quot;by cold&quot;
* &quot;sun-&quot; &quot;with the mind&quot;
* &quot;ta&quot;-&quot; &quot;with the feet&quot;
* &quot;ta&quot;-&quot; &quot;with a hard instrument or rock&quot;
* &quot;to&quot;- &quot;&quot;with the hand or fist&quot;
* &quot;tsa&quot;-&quot; &quot;with a grasping hand&quot;
* &quot;tsi&quot;-&quot; &quot;with a sharp point&quot;
* &quot;tso&quot;-&quot; &quot;with the head&quot;
* &quot;wɨ&quot;-&quot; &quot;with a long instrument or body&quot;; generic instrumental

==Syntax==

=== Word order ===
Subject-object-verb (SOV) is the typical word order for Shoshoni.

In ditransitive sentences, the direct and indirect object are marked with the objective case. The indirect object can occur before the direct object, or vice versa. For example, in &quot;nɨ tsuhnippɨha satiia uttuhkwa&quot; &quot;I gave the bone to the dog&quot;, &quot;tsuhnippɨh&quot; &quot;bone&quot; and &quot;satii&quot; &quot;dog&quot; take the objective case suffix &quot;-a&quot;.

The subject is not a mandatory component of a grammatical Shoshoni sentence. Therefore, impersonal sentences without subjects are allowed; those sentences have an object-verb word order.

In particular, it is common for the subject to be deleted when a coreferential pronoun appears elsewhere in the sentence. For example, &quot;pɨnnan haintsɨha kai paikkawaihtɨn&quot; &quot;he won&#x27;t kill his (own) friend&quot; uses the coreferential possessive pronoun &quot;pɨnnan&quot; and lacks a word for &quot;he&quot; as an explicit subject. Likewise, the subject can be deleted from the sentence when the subject can be inferred from context. For example, in a narrative about one man who shoots another, &quot;u paikkahkwa&quot; &quot;he killed him&quot; (literally, &quot;him killed&quot;) is acceptable, because the killer is clear from the context of the narrative.

State-of-being sentences express “be” by excluding an overt verb, resulting in a basic subject-object order.

Sentence meaning is not dependent on word order in Shoshoni. For example, if the subject is an unstressed pronoun then it is grammatical for the subject to follow the object of the sentence.

==== Constituent order ====
The basic order of constituent morphemes in Shoshoni verbs is as follows: (Valence) - (Instrumental) - Stem - (Causative/Benefactive) - (Secondary Verb) - (Directional) - (Prefinal Aspect) - (Aspect) - (Imperative) - (Number) - (Subordination)Any verb form must include a verb stem, but other prefixes and suffixes may not be present, depending on the particular verb form.

=== Subordination ===

==== Relative clauses ====
Relative clauses tend to share the same head noun as the main clause, and the case of this noun must agree in both clauses. When the subject of the relative clause matches the subject of the main clause, the verb of the relative clause takes on the same-subject subordination suffix &quot;-tɨn&quot; or &quot;-h/kkantɨn&quot;, depending on whether the events of the clauses occur simultaneously or not. These suffixes agree with the head noun of the main clause in both case and number. For example, &quot;wa&#x27;ippɨ yakaitɨn pitɨnuh&quot; &quot;the woman who was crying arrived,&quot; where the subject &quot;wa&#x27;ippɨ&quot; &quot;woman&quot; is the same for both clauses and &quot;yakai-&quot; &quot;cry&quot; in the relative clause takes the suffix &quot;-tɨn&quot;.

However, when the subject of the relative clause is not the head noun of the main clause, the subject of the relative clause takes the possessive case and a different set of verbal suffixes are used; the head noun may be deleted from the relative clause altogether. These different-subject subordinate suffixes also mark verb tense and aspect: in the nominative case, they are -&quot;na&quot; if present&quot;, -h/kkan&quot; if stative, -&quot;h/kkwan&quot; if momentaneous, -&quot;ppɨh&quot; if perfect, &quot;-tu&#x27;ih&quot; if future, and -ih if unmarked.

The subject &quot;we&quot; of the relative clause appears as the possessive pronoun &quot;nɨhɨn&quot; &quot;our,&quot; and &quot;tɨkka-&quot; &quot;eat&quot; takes the suffix &quot;-nna&quot; to indicate the present action of eating.

==== Switch reference ====
Shoshoni exhibits switch reference, in which a non-relative, subordinate clause is marked when its subject is a pronoun that differs from the subject of the main clause. In such subordinate clauses, the subject takes the objective case and the verb takes on a switch reference suffix: -&quot;ku&quot; if the events of both clauses occur simultaneously, -&quot;h/kkan&quot; if the events of the subordinate clause occur first, or the combined -&quot;h/kkanku&quot; if the events of the subordinate clause occur over an extended amount of time. For example, &quot;sunni naaku wihyu nɨnɨttsi utɨɨkatti tattɨkwa&quot; &quot;when that happened, something scary came to them.&quot; In the relative clause &quot;sunni naaku&quot; &quot;when that happened&quot;, the verb &quot;naa-&quot; &quot;be&quot; or &quot;happen&quot; takes on the suffix &quot;-ku&quot; to indicate that the relative and main clauses co-occur in the narrative.

==Writing system==
Shoshoni lacks a single agreed-upon writing system. Multiple orthographies exist, with differing levels of acceptance among Shoshoni speakers. Among the Shoshone, there are conflicting views on whether Shoshoni should be written at all.

Traditionalists advocate to keep Shoshoni an oral language, better protected from outsiders who might exploit the language. Meanwhile, progressives argue that writing the language down will better preserve it and make it useful today.

The older Crum-Miller system and the Idaho State University system (or Gould system) are the two main Shoshoni writing systems in use.

The Crum-Miller orthography was developed in the 1960s by Beverly Crum, a Shoshone elder and linguist, and Wick Miller, a non-Native anthropologist and linguist. The system is largely phonemic, with specific symbols mapping to specific phonemes, which reflects the underlying sounds but not necessarily surface pronunciations.

The newer Idaho State system was developed by the Shoshone elder Drusilla Gould and the non-Native linguist Christopher Loether and is used more commonly in southern Idaho. Compared to the Crum-Miller system, the Idaho State system is more phonetic, with spellings more closely reflecting the surface pronunciations of words, but it lacks the deeper phonemic information that the Crum-Miller system provides.

Online Shoshoni dictionaries are available for everyday use.

<text>The Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) is a deep-field image of a small region of space in the constellation Fornax, containing an estimated 10,000 galaxies. The original data for the image was collected by the Hubble Space Telescope from September 2003 to January 2004 and the first version of the image was released on March 9, 2004. It includes light from galaxies that existed about 13 billion years ago, some 400 to 800 million years after the Big Bang.

The HUDF image was taken in a section of the sky with a low density of bright stars in the near-field, allowing much better viewing of dimmer, more distant objects. Located southwest of Orion in the southern-hemisphere constellation Fornax, the rectangular image is 2.4 arcminutes to an edge, or 3.4 arcminutes diagonally. This is about one-tenth of the angular diameter of a full moon viewed from Earth (less than 34 arcminutes), smaller than a 1 mm2 piece of paper held 1 m away, and equal to roughly one twenty-six-millionth of the total area of the sky. The image is oriented so that the upper left corner points toward north (−46.4°) on the celestial sphere.

In August and September 2009, the HUDF field was observed at longer wavelengths (1.0 to 1.6 μm) using the infrared channel of the recently fitted Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). This additional data enabled astronomers to identify a new list of potentially very distant galaxies.

On September 25, 2012, NASA released a new version of the Ultra-Deep Field dubbed the eXtreme Deep Field (XDF). The XDF reveals galaxies from 13.2 billion years ago, including one thought to have formed only 450 million years after the Big Bang.

On June 3, 2014, NASA released the Hubble Ultra Deep Field 2014 image, the first HUDF image to use the full range of ultraviolet to near-infrared light. A composite of separate exposures taken in 2002 to 2012 with Hubble&#x27;s Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Camera 3, it shows some 10,000 galaxies.

On January 23, 2019, the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias released an even deeper version of the infrared images of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field obtained with the WFC3 instrument, named the ABYSS Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The new images improve the previous reduction of the WFC3/IR images, including careful sky background subtraction around the largest galaxies on the field of view. After this update, some galaxies were found to be almost twice as big as previously measured.

==Planning==
In the years since the original Hubble Deep Field, the Hubble Deep Field South and the GOODS sample were analyzed, providing increased statistics at the high redshifts probed by the HDF. When the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) detector was installed on the HST, it was realized that an ultra-deep field could observe galaxy formation out to even higher redshifts than had currently been observed, as well as providing more information about galaxy formation at intermediate redshifts (z~2). A workshop on how to best carry out surveys with the ACS was held at STScI in late 2002. At the workshop Massimo Stiavelli advocated an Ultra Deep Field as a way to study the objects responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Following the workshop, the STScI Director Steven Beckwith decided to devote 400 orbits of Director&#x27;s Discretionary time to the UDF and appointed Stiavelli as the lead of the Home Team implementing the observations.

Unlike the Deep Fields, the HUDF does not lie in Hubble&#x27;s Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ). The earlier observations, using the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) camera, were able to take advantage of the increased observing time on these zones by using wavelengths with higher noise to observe at times when earthshine contaminated the observations; however, ACS does not observe at these wavelengths, so the advantage was reduced.

As with the earlier fields, this one was required to contain very little emission from our galaxy, with little Zodiacal dust. The field was also required to be in a range of declinations such that it could be observed both by southern hemisphere instruments, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, and northern hemisphere ones, such as those located on Hawaii. It was ultimately decided to observe a section of the Chandra Deep Field South, due to existing deep X-ray observations from Chandra X-ray Observatory and two interesting objects already observed in the GOODS sample at the same location: a redshift 5.8 galaxy and a supernova. The coordinates of the field are right ascension , declination (J2000). The field is 200 arcseconds to a side, with a total area of 11 square arcminutes, and lies in the constellation of Fornax.

==Observations==

Four filters were used on the ACS, centered on 435, 606, 775 and 850 nm, with exposure times set to give equal sensitivity in all filters. These wavelength ranges match those used by the GOODS sample, allowing direct comparison between the two. As with the Deep Fields, the HUDF used Directors Discretionary Time. In order to get the best resolution possible, the observations were dithered by pointing the telescope at slightly different positions for each exposure—a process trialled with the Hubble Deep Field—so that the final image has a higher resolution than the pixels on their own would normally allow.

The observations were done in two sessions, from September 23 to October 28, 2003, and December 4, 2003, to January 15, 2004. The total exposure time is just under 1 million seconds, from 400 orbits, with a typical exposure time of 1200 seconds. In total, 800 ACS exposures were taken over the course of 11.3 days, two per orbit; NICMOS observed for 4.5 days. All the individual ACS exposures were processed and combined by Anton Koekemoer into a set of scientifically useful images, each with a total exposure time ranging from 134,900 seconds to 347,100 seconds. To observe the whole sky to the same sensitivity, the HST would need to observe continuously for a million years.

The sensitivity of the ACS limits its capability of detecting galaxies at high redshift to about 6. The deep NICMOS fields obtained in parallel to the ACS images could in principle be used to detect galaxies at redshift 7 or higher but they were lacking visible band images of similar depth. These are necessary to identify high redshift objects as they should not be seen in the visible bands. In order to obtain deep visible exposures on top of the NICMOS parallel fields a follow-up program, HUDF05, was approved and granted 204 orbits to observe the two parallel fields (GO-10632). The orientation of the HST was chosen so that further NICMOS parallel images would fall on top of the main UDF field.

After the installation of WFC3 on Hubble in 2009, the HUDF09 programme (GO-11563) devoted 192 orbits to observations of three fields, including HUDF, using the newly available F105W, F125W and F160W infra-red filters (which correspond to the Y, J and H bands):

==Contents==
The HUDF is the deepest image of the universe ever taken and has been used to search for galaxies that existed between 400 and 800 million years after the Big Bang (redshifts between 7 and 12). Several galaxies in the HUDF are candidates, based on photometric redshifts, to be amongst the most distant astronomical objects. The red dwarf UDF 2457 at distance of 59,000 light-years is the furthest star resolved by the HUDF. The star near the center of the field is USNO-A2.0 0600–01400432 with apparent magnitude of 18.95.

The field imaged by the ACS contains over 10,000 objects, the majority of which are galaxies, many at redshifts greater than 3, and some that probably have redshifts between 6 and 7. The NICMOS measurements may have discovered galaxies at redshifts up to 12.

==Scientific results==
The HUDF has revealed high rates of star formation during the very early stages of galaxy formation, within a billion years after the Big Bang. It has also enabled improved characterization of the distribution of galaxies, their numbers, sizes and luminosities at different epochs, aiding investigation into the evolution of galaxies. Galaxies at high redshifts have been confirmed to be smaller and less symmetrical than ones at lower redshifts, illuminating the rapid evolution of galaxies in the first couple of billion years after the Big Bang.
== Hubble eXtreme Deep Field ==
The Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (HXDF), released on September 25, 2012, is an image of a portion of space in the center of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field image. Representing a total of two million seconds (about 23 days) of exposure time collected over 10 years, the image covers an area of 2.3 arcminutes by 2 arcminutes, or about 80% of the area of the HUDF. This represents about one thirty-two millionth of the sky.

The HXDF contains about 5,500 galaxies, the oldest of which are seen as they were 13.2 billion years ago. The faintest galaxies are one ten-billionth the brightness of what the human eye can see. The red galaxies in the image are the remnants of galaxies after major collisions during their elderly years. Many of the smaller galaxies in the image are very young galaxies that eventually developed into major galaxies, similar to the Milky Way and other galaxies in our galactic neighborhood.

<text>The sixth USS &quot;Somers&quot; (DDG-34, ex-DD-947) was a &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyer when her keel was laid down at the Bath Iron Works on 4 March 1958, she was launched on 30 May, and commissioned on 3 April 1959.

&quot;Somers&quot; was decommissioned 11 April 1966, and converted at San Francisco Naval Shipyard. On 15 March 1967 she was reclassified as a guided missile destroyer, and was re-commissioned 10 February 1968. She was decommissioned on 19 November 1982 and on 26 April 1988, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. On 22 July 1998, she was sunk as target near Hawaii.

==History==
The sixth &quot;Somers&quot; was laid down on 4 March 1957 by the Bath Iron Works Corp., at Bath, Maine; launched on 30 May 1958; sponsored by Mrs. Charles E. Wilson; and commissioned on 3 April 1959.

On 1 June 1959, the destroyer sailed from Boston, Massachusetts, to Newport, Rhode Island, before departing the United States five days later for her maiden voyage which took her - via Argentia, Newfoundland - to the ports of northern Europe. On her itinerary were Copenhagen, Denmark; Stockholm, Sweden; Portsmouth, England; and Kiel, Germany, where she represented the Navy during the &quot;Kiel Week&quot; festivities. &quot;Somers&quot; took leave of Europe at Portsmouth, England, and-after stopping briefly at Bermuda and training for five days out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba-transited the Panama Canal on 19 July. She arrived at her home port, San Diego, California, on 27 July and conducted shakedown training along the California coast for the next six weeks. She underwent final acceptance trials on 17 September; then, completed just over a month of overhaul from 1 October until 8 November.

===Vietnam service===

Over the next six and one-half years, &quot;Somers&quot; alternated between operations out of San Diego and deployments to the 7th Fleet in the Far East. In all, she deployed to the western Pacific four times during this period, remaining on the west coast in 1962 and 1964.

Her first three tours in the Far East were relatively uneventful, peacetime assignments, consisting of 7th Fleet operations and exercises with units of the navies of the SEATO allies of the United States. During her second and third deployments, in 1961 and 1963, &quot;Somers&quot; steamed to Australia to participate in the celebrations commemorating 19th and 21st anniversaries of the Battle of the Coral Sea. During her fourth tour of duty with the 7th Fleet, the destroyer saw her first wartime operations as American involvement in the Vietnam War escalated. She plied the waters of the Tonkin Gulf, plane guarding for , , and as their aircraft pounded enemy supply lines in North Vietnam.

===Conversion===
On 30 July 1965, &quot;Somers&quot; got underway from Yokosuka, Japan, to return to the United States. She arrived in San Diego on 12 August and, after a month of leave and upkeep, she resumed normal operations along the west coast. She continued to be so engaged until 11 April 1966 when she entered San Francisco Naval Shipyard to begin conversion to a guided missile destroyer. On that day, she was decommissioned at Hunters Point. From then until February 1968, &quot;Somers&quot; was in the shipyard having 90% of her superstructure replaced, installing the AN/SPS-48A 3D air search radar, receiving the Tartar surface-to-air missile system and the ASROC antisubmarine rocket system. In addition, her engineering equipment was completely overhauled, and she received a lot of additional electronic gear. On 10 February 1968, &quot;Somers&quot; was recommissioned at Hunters Point as the Navy&#x27;s newest guided-missile destroyer, DDG-34.

Her conversion was completed on 16 May 1968, and she departed Hunters Point the next day for her new home port, Long Beach, Calif. For the rest of 1968 and most of 1969, the guided-missile destroyer ranged the west coast from Mexico to the state of Washington, conducting trials and exercises.

===Return to Vietnam===
On 18 November 1969, she got underway to deploy again to the western Pacific. She stopped over in Hawaii from 24 to 28 November and loaded ammunition at the Oahu Naval Ammunition Depot. Continuing westward, she paused at Midway on 1 December to refuel and at Guam on the 8th. She made Subic Bay in the Philippines on the 11th. During this deployment, &quot;Somers&quot; returned to the Gulf of Tonkin alternately plane guarding &quot;Hancock&quot; and serving on the gunline. During late March and early April, she joined units of the Australian and New Zealand navies in the SEATO exercise, &quot;Sea Rover.&quot; After that, she returned to plane guard duties, this time for . Two days after joining the carrier, however, &quot;Somers&quot; was detached to return to Subic Bay. She arrived on 19 April and remained until the 24th, when she got underway for the United States.

&quot;Somers&quot; arrived at Long Beach on 8 May 1970. After an availability period and an extended leave and upkeep period, the guided-missile destroyer embarked 35 Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps midshipmen for five weeks training during PACMIDTRARON 70. The cruise commenced on 22 June and was concluded on 6 August at Long Beach. She resumed operations out of her homeport until 13 November when she got underway for another deployment to the western Pacific. &quot;Somers&quot; was assigned to the 7th Fleet from December 1970 until 4 May 1971. During that time, she plane guarded the carriers on six occasions, rendered naval gunfire support on three, and once stood watch on the northern search and rescue station. In between line periods, she visited Keelung, Taiwan; Hong Kong; Singapore; and Penang, Malaysia, in addition to putting in periodically at the naval station at Subic Bay.

She cleared the Gulf of Tonkin on 4 May, headed back to the United States, and made Long Beach on the 23d. &quot;Somers&quot; resumed operations out of Long Beach until 9 July when she began a month of pre-overhaul preparations. On 9 August, the guided-missile destroyer entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard to commence regular overhaul. The overhaul lasted until 3 December and, following that, she went into a period of restricted availability which carried her through 31 December. &quot;Somers&quot; completed her restricted availability on 3 January 1972 and began trials, tests, and exercises which lasted through 31 March. After nine days of preparations, she headed west on 10 April to rejoin the 7th Fleet.

Sailing via Pearl Harbor and Guam, &quot;Somers&quot; made Subic Bay on 29 April. After a voyage to Singapore and back, she joined the carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin on 9 May. Her tour of duty in the Far East lasted until late October. She cruised with the aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin five times during this deployment, rendered naval gunfire support three times, and stood duty on the south Talos station and PIRAZ station once each. Between line periods, she normally put into Subic Bay, but managed to visit Sasebo, Japan, and Hong Kong. &quot;Somers&quot; returned to Long Beach on 9 November 1972.

Two periods of operations from her home port separated by two months of restricted availability at Long Beach took up the first nine months of 1973 for &quot;Somers&quot;. On 9 October, she got underway to deploy to the western Pacific. On 15 October 1973, SOMERS arrived at her new homeport, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, en route to her eighth Western Pacific deployment. On this deployment, she made Subic Bay on 5 November. She remained on duty with the 7th Fleet until mid-May 1974, when she reentered Pearl Harbor.

===Post Vietnam Service===

SOMERS deployed in November 1978 for her tenth Western Pacific deployment. Upon her return from deployment, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard to undergo a scheduled overhaul (ROH). SOMERS remained in the shipyard for fifty-one weeks and returned to sea on 4 August 1980.

The months following her return to sea were devoted to Engineering, Operations and Weapons System shakedown, tests and ultimate certifications which demonstrated her worthiness to return to Fleet Service.

In early 1981, SOMERS joined Battle Group Charlie and participated in READIEX 5–81 in preparation for the Battle Group s deployment. SOMERS was also a participant in the July 1981 FLEETEX 1-81, the largest U.S. Navy exercise in history.

On 3 November 1981, she deployed with Battle Group Delta headed by USS CONSTELLATION (CV-64). During her eleventh and final deployment, SOMERS operated primarily in the Indian Ocean and made port calls in Guam, the Philippines, Diego Garcia, Bunbury Australia, Maldive Islands and Singapore. After successfully participating in READIEX 2–82 in May 1982, she returned home arriving in Pearl Harbor on 16 May 1982. After returning from this deployment, she was preparing for more operations, when preparations were cut short by the notice that she was to be decommissioned. Somers was decommissioned on November 19, 1982.

During her service, USS SOMERS earned two Marjorie Sterrett Battleship awards, a meritorious Unit Commendation, three Battle Efficiency E awards and presently wears departmental excellence awards.for Supply, Gunnery, Missiles, ASW, CIC, Communications, Electronic Warfare and Damage Control.

SOMERS was relocated to the Inactive Ship Facility at Pearl Harbor until approximately 1988. From there, she was sold to the U.S. Maritime Administration. She was in use at Port Hueneme, California for many years as an experimental ship.

==Sinking==
On 20 May 1998, &quot;Somers&quot; was towed from Port Hueneme for the last time. On 21 July 1998, two United States Air Force B-52 Stratofortresses from the 20th Bomb Squadron fired missiles at &quot;Somers&quot; – adrift in the Pacific Ocean about northwest of Kauai. Hawaii – as part of the Rim of the Pacific 1998 exercise. Each B-52 crew launched one AGM-142 Have Nap missile, and both missiles hit &quot;Somers&quot;. On 22 July 1998, an explosive ordnance disposal team rappelled from a helicopter to &quot;Somers&quot; and sank her with explosive charges; this was shown in a video issued by the RIMPAC 98 public relations officer. Her final resting place is off the coast of Kauai, at . She rests at a depth of .

<text>USS &quot;Morton&quot; (DD-948) was a &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyer of the United States Navy, named for Commander Dudley &quot;Mush&quot; Morton USN (1907–1943), commanding officer of during World War II.

&quot;Morton&quot; was laid down 4 March 1957, by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., Pascagoula, Miss.; launched 23 May 1958; sponsored by Miss Edwina R. Morton; and commissioned 26 May 1959 at North Charleston, SC.

==History==
After a training cruise in the Caribbean, she proceeded to the West Coast, arriving NS San Diego, Calif., 20 October 1959. She deployed to the western Pacific in January 1960, participated in Operation Blue Star, a joint Navy, Marine, Air Force amphibious operation in March, and made a special &quot;People-to-People&quot; visit to Bombay, India, before returning to the West Coast 31 May. Departing San Diego 3 April, she reported for one month&#x27;s duty in the Formosa Patrol, during which time she participated in Operation Handclasp, carrying food, medicine, and clothing to the less fortunate people of free China. She returned to San Diego 28 September 1961, and continued operations off the West Coast, until sailing 13 November 1962 for another WestPac deployment. Following duty with the Formosa Patrol, and operations off Japan, she steamed home, arriving San Diego 15 June 1963.

&quot;Morton&quot; continued operations off the West Coast until August 1964, when she steamed to the South China Sea and patrolled off South Vietnam. On 11 September 1964, approximately one month after the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, the Director of the Naval Security Group, Pacific (DIRNAVSECGRUPAC) informed the Director of the National Security Agency of plans for an intercept team, SIGAD USN-467P, to be aboard the &quot;Morton&quot;. The DESOTO patrol, part of Operation 34A, was conducted by the &quot;USS Morton&quot; and the approximately one month after the Gulf of Tonkin incident. She spent the next several months screening aircraft carriers before returning to the West Coast 6 February 1965.

Arriving off South Vietnam in April 1966 the destroyer shelled Vietcong supply points and encampments for the next four months. After a short break, &quot;Morton&quot; began Sea Dragon operations off North Vietnam in May 1967. During these raids, she targeted enemy coast defense sites and radar installations and interdicted barge traffic along the coast. &quot;Morton&quot; also provided gunfire support for the 12th Marine Regiment near the DMZ before returning to San Diego 3 November.

&quot;Morton&quot; departed San Diego 31 October 1968, again joined the gun-line and bombarded North Vietnamese and Vietcong supply points and bunkers up and down the coast. The destroyer returned home in the late spring and began preparations for an anti-submarine weapons
system modernization at Long Beach Naval Shipyard. The warship decommissioned at Long Beach on 26 September 1969.

Recommissioned 15 August 1970, &quot;Morton&quot; spent the next year testing her new SQS-23 sonar, ASROC launcher and new electronic systems. As part of this refresher training, &quot;Morton&quot; conducted numerous ASW exercises against friendly submarines off Hawaii and California. Following a tender availability in Pearl Harbor in early 1971, &quot;Morton&quot; sailed on her next WestPac deployment on 9 September. She conducted two gun-line tours before sailing for home on 1 March 1972 via Australia. Later in the year, she participated in several ASW exercises before deploying again to WestPac on 13 October. More gunline tours followed, including a Linebacker raid on North Vietnamese coastal targets in December 1972.

Following the ceasefire of 28 January 1973, &quot;Morton&quot; patrolled off South Vietnam until sailing for home on 19 February 1973. With the end of hostilities, &quot;Morton&quot;&#x27;s ensuing deployments to WestPac centered around providing screen and escort services for carrier task forces. During these years, &quot;Morton&quot; also continued to participate in ASW exercises, owing to the threat from the growing Soviet submarine fleet.
After enduring serious boiler problems in the Philippines in the spring of 1974 she underwent an overhaul in Pearl Harbor in 1975 and was active in mainly local operations in 1976. &quot;Morton&quot; deployed again to the Pacific on 17 February 1977. During this cruise, the warship participated in ASW exercises off Taiwan and sailed into the Indian Ocean to visit Kenya and Iran, before returning home on 28 September. She deployed again on 11 September 1978, operating off Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, before sailing for home on 7 March 1979. On 3 May 1980, &quot;Morton&quot; began another overhaul, completing the yard work and refresher training by the summer of 1981.

&quot;Morton&quot; sailed on her last deployment in February 1982, during which she participated in five major ASW exercises with U.S. and allied naval forces. On two occasions, the warship aided Vietnamese refugees—rescuing 18 men on 9 June and 52 men, women and children on 10 June—for which &quot;Morton&quot; received the Humanitarian Service Medal. The warship returned home to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 12 August.

==Fate==
&quot;Morton&quot; decommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 22 November 1982. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 7 February 1990 and the ship was sold to Southwest Recycling, Inc., Terminal Island, Calif., for scrapping on 17 March 1992. During the scrapping process, the commercial diving crew responsible for removing the struts, shafts and wheels of the Morton set the current (as of 2007) world record for the thickest piece of steel cut underwater by means of an ultra-thermic torch. While cutting the starboard shaft, it was discovered that the Morton&#x27;s shafts deviated from the blueprints provided to Southwest Marine &amp; Recycling. Specifically, the shafts were to have a wall thickness of two inches (2.0&quot;); however, upon being cut, the shafts were found to be almost completely solid, consisting of a wall of 19.2&quot; inches around a 2.0&quot; hollow cylinder. It is believed the shafts deviated from specifications because of material shortages, requiring use of an inferior alloy, but this has not been confirmed.

<text>USS &quot;Richard S. Edwards&quot; (DD-950), named for Admiral Richard Stanislaus Edwards USN (1885–1956), was a &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyer built by the Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company at Seattle, Washington and launched on 24 September 1957 by Mrs. W. B. Franke; and commissioned 5 February 1959.

&quot;Richard S. Edwards&quot; served as plane guard for carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in Sea Dragon operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out Naval Gunfire Support missions during the Vietnam War and underwent an ASW modernization at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard between 27 February 1970 and 15 January 1971.

==History==
&quot;Richard S. Edwards&quot; shakedown cruise in 1959, took her to Mazatlan Mexico, the Panama Canal and to Valparaiso, Chile. While returning from Valparaiso, the newly installed boilers started to spring leaks. Of the four boilers, three were leaking so bad, that the ship had to return to Seattle on one screw. The following year, on 11 August, the &quot;Richard S. Edwards&quot;, was refueling alongside the aircraft carrier , when the &quot;Bennington&quot; suddenly veered to the left, and the &quot;Edwards&quot; attempted to follow the &quot;Bennington&quot;. Then the &quot;Bennington&quot; returned again to its original course. This caused the &quot;Bennington&quot; to sideswipe the &quot;Edwards&quot; as it attempted to go full back. This caused extensive damage to the deck housing on the port side of the &quot;Edwards&quot; and partially destroyed the galley and wiped a long gash to the deck housing on the port side of the ship. This action also caused the triple torpedoes to end up on the carrier elevator. There were no injuries aboard the &quot;Edwards&quot; because of the quick action of Third Class Boatswains Mate, Lionel Sepulveda, a 12-year veteran, anticipating the imminent collision, announced over the PA system that all personnel clear the port side. There were no injuries other than a bruised shin when one of the sailors aboard the &quot;Edwards&quot; bumped his shin jumping over a mess table. The collision damage is the reason the ship had to enter the Naval Shipyard at Terminal Island, Long Beach California, the Edwards then went to its homeport, San Diego.

On one WestPac cruise, the &quot;Edwards&quot; left Pearl Harbor with 20 Air Force Cadets from the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. &quot;Edwards&quot; was about two days out of Pearl Harbor when she received a distress signal from a seagoing tug that had been towing an aircraft carrier to Japan to be scrapped. The tug was about two days out of port, they sailed into the middle of a typhoon. The aircraft carrier also on the scene, &quot;Edwards&quot; was tasked with rescuing the crew from the tug. &quot;Edwards&quot; was in the middle of that typhoon for 21 days. &quot;Edwards&quot; sailed as close to the tug as possible and stood by in case the tug started to sink. Also, the &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot;, was attempting to drop food to the sailors on the tug. The Air Force Cadets were having the worst time, and they were sorry they came aboard. The cadets were lying in the passageways and in their bunks in the forward crew compartment, there was a smell of vomit and supposedly a lot of green vomit was on the compartments decks. Risbon, a Signalman, on his post on the bridge, said that at one time the ship listed to 47degrees, shook a lot but eventually came back to a more even keel. She then deployed to the Western Pacific area where she operated with the fast carrier units of the 7th Fleet, and as a member of the U.S. Taiwan Patrol Force. She returned to the West Coast, 13 May 1960, and operated there until deploying to the Western Pacific again in February 1961 to operate with the fast carrier group in the South China Sea. She returned to San Diego, 14 September 1961.

&quot;Richard S. Edwards&quot; commenced her third WestPac cruise 13 November 1962 for fast carrier operations throughout the western Pacific, returning home in June 1963. She resumed local operations until commencing her fourth WestPac cruise from August 1964 to January 1965. During this deployment &quot;Edwards&quot; and engaged North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Tonkin Gulf on 18 September, probably sinking several.

Upon returning from the Far East, &quot;Edwards&quot; operated off the west coast until deploying to WestPac again 1 March 1966 to 26 August 1966. There she rendered naval gunfire support to forces ashore in Vietnam and plane-guarded for U.S. Navy carriers in the Tonkin Gulf. During 1967, she operated off the west coast of the United States until returning to WestPac in August. She arrived at Da Nang, South Vietnam, 3 November 1967. She returned to San Diego 12 March 1968 and spent the balance of that year operating off the west coast.

In late January 1969 &quot;Edwards&quot; deployed to WestPac again to operate off Vietnam. She returned to San Diego 13 August 1969, until being decommissioned at Long Beach, California on 27 February 1970. She immediately entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard and underwent ASW modernization. By December, she was participating in sea trials in anticipation of her recommissioning, which occurred 15 January 1971. She embarked 4 March for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, her new home port, and continued operations in that vicinity until April 1972.

Receiving only 72 hours notice, &quot;Edwards&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor 10 April 1972 for the western Pacific and deployment off the Vietnamese coast. On 9 May 1972, Edwards led the gunfire strike that preceded the Operation Pocket Money mining of Haiphong Harbor. She remained in the area, either on the gunline or cruising with the carriers as escort and plane-guard, until November. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 November 1972, operating out of that port until decommissioned on 15 December 1982.

&quot;Richard S. Edwards&quot; received six battle stars for service off Vietnam.

==Fate==
She was decommissioned 15 December 1982, stricken 7 February 1990, and sunk as a target ship off the coast of Kauai on 10 April 1997, or may be 12 May 1997.

<text>USS &quot;Turner Joy&quot; (DD-951) is one of 18 s of the United States Navy. She was named for Admiral Charles Turner Joy USN (1895–1956). Commissioned in 1959, she spent her entire career in the Pacific. She participated extensively in the Vietnam War, and was one of the principal ships involved in the Gulf of Tonkin incident.

Decommissioned in 1982, she is now a museum ship in Bremerton, Washington.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Turner Joy&quot; was built by the Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company of Seattle and commissioned at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. Her keel was laid on 30 September 1957. She was launched on 5 May 1958, sponsored by Mrs. C. Turner Joy, and was commissioned on 3 August 1959.

== Pre-Vietnam War operational duty ==
Following a pre-shakedown goodwill cruise to Central and South American ports and shakedown out of San Diego, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; began, early in 1960, duty as flagship both of Destroyer Squadron 13 (DesRon 13) and Destroyer Division 131 (DesDiv 131). Based at Long Beach, California, she formed part of an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) task group built around . She conducted exercises along the California coast until 17 May 1960, when she sailed with the task group for the western Pacific.

After stops at Pearl Harbor and Apra, Guam, she stood air-sea rescue duty near the Marianas for President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s flight to visit several Asian nations. After returning to Apra briefly, the destroyer moved via the Philippines to Bangkok, Thailand. &quot;Turner Joy&quot; crossed the president&#x27;s path once more in July 1960, when the Chinese used the latter&#x27;s visit to Taiwan as a pretext for shelling the islands of Quemoy and Matsu, once again. A tense month of duty with the Taiwan Strait patrol followed as the United States Navy demonstrated America&#x27;s support for one of her allies. In mid-August 1960, the warship moved north for exercises with 7th Fleet carriers along the coast of Japan. That duty rounded out her first western Pacific deployment, and the destroyer got underway for Yokosuka, Japan, and headed home.

&quot;Turner Joy&quot; returned to Long Beach on 16 November 1960. Over the next 18 months, she completed an extensive overhaul and participated in numerous 1st Fleet exercises along the California coast. In October 1961, the destroyer was transferred to DesDiv 191 of DesRon 19 and assumed duty as flagship for both. On 2 June 1962, she stood out of Long Beach with an ASW task group built around &quot;Hornet&quot;. On her way to the Far East, the warship participated in exercises with Amphibious Squadron 5 in the Hawaiian Islands. Later, she joined the screen of , operating off the southern coast of Honshū, Japan.

Her second deployment to the Orient was characterized by a series of exercises with ships of the 7th Fleet and of allied navies. Areas of operations included the Sea of Japan, the Pacific east of Japan, and the South China Sea. After a final series of drills conducted with , the destroyer completed that tour of duty at Yokosuka, Japan, early in December. On 7 June, she headed back to the United States where she arrived on 21 June. The ensuing 14 months brought another overhaul as well as further 1st Fleet exercises in the waters along the west coast. Those evolutions continued into 1964; and, in March, the destroyer began preparations for overseas movement.

==Gulf of Tonkin incident==

On 13 March 1964, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; departed Long Beach to embark upon her most celebrated tour of duty in the Far East. The third western Pacific deployment of her career began routinely enough. After calling at Pearl Harbor on her way west, the destroyer joined a task group built around for operations in the Philippine Sea, followed by a cruise through the South China Sea to Japan. Further training operations and port visits ensued, as the deployment continued peacefully. During late July 1964, &quot;Turner Joy&quot;, while attached to a carrier task group built around , began making &quot;watch dog&quot; patrols off the coast of Vietnam where a guerrilla war had been raging at varying levels of intensity since the end of World War II.

In the afternoon of 2 August 1964, , engaged in a DESOTO patrol, called for assistance when three Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy (VPN) P 4-class torpedo boats from the 135th Torpedo Squadron attacked her. As &quot;Maddox&quot; engaged the boats, firing over 280 five-inch shells, the contact was broken, and each combatant withdrew from the contact. While retreating to the North Vietnamese coastline, the three torpedo boats were attacked by four Navy F-8 Crusader jets from &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; which fired rockets and strafed with 20mm cannon fire, damaging two torpedo boats and leaving one boat in apparently sinking condition. Meanwhile, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; raced to &quot;Maddox&quot; to provide additional surface strength. By the time she reached &quot;Maddox&quot;, the torpedo boats were no longer in the area.

On 3 August 1964, the &quot;Turner Joy&quot; was ordered to accompany the &quot;Maddox&quot; for another DESOTO mission, on 4 August &quot;Turner Joy&quot;″s radar screens picked up a number of what appeared to be small, high-speed surface craft approaching, but at extreme range. As a precaution, the two destroyers called upon &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; to furnish air support. By nightfall, the unidentified radar echoes suggested that VPN torpedo boats were converging upon the two American warships from the west and south. &quot;Turner Joy&quot; reported that she sighted one or two torpedo wakes, then rang up full speed, maneuvered radically to evade expected torpedoes, and began firing in the direction of the unidentified blips. Over the next two and a half hours, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; fired approximately 220 five-inch shells, while planes from &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; fired at the supposed torpedo boats.

Reports claimed that at least two of those were sunk by direct hits and another pair severely damaged, and that the remaining boats retired rapidly to the north. A sailor in the Gun Director on the USS &quot;Maddox&quot;, Patrick Park, reviewed radar and sonar records for the next three days after the incident on orders from his superiors. His conclusion, there were no attacks on 4 August 1964 against the &quot;Maddox&quot; and the &quot;Turner Joy&quot;. This has been supported by evidence from the Vietnamese since the end of hostilities. In addition, Admiral Moore reported on 7 August 1964 to Admiral Sharpe that &quot;Freak weather effects on radar and overeager sonar men may have accounted for the many reports.&quot;

On 1 and 2 July 1966, the three torpedo boats from VPN Torpedo Squadron 135; &quot;T-333&quot;, &quot;T-336&quot;, and &quot;T-339&quot;, which had attacked the USS &quot;Maddox&quot; on 2 August 1964, came into the Tonkin Gulf again to attack two more US destroyers, only to be promptly sunk by US jets from the aircraft carriers and . Nineteen VPN sailors were taken as prisoner of war from those sunk torpedo boats, and they made it clear that no VPN torpedo boats had been sunk in 1964. It could well have been that bad weather and freakish radar conditions for which the Gulf of Tonkin is famous, caused radar echoes to appear on &quot;Turner Joy&quot;″s screen and prompted her captain and crew to take defensive action in consideration of the events two days earlier.

In any event, the &quot;Tonkin Gulf incident&quot; prompted American retaliation. &quot;Constellation&quot; joined &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; off North Vietnam the following day, and together they launched Operation Pierce Arrow, sixty-four sorties against the bases from which the attacks had been launched and against an oil storage depot known to have been used to support those bases. Planes from &quot;Constellation&quot; hit the VPN bases at Hongay and Loc Chao in the north while &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; aircraft went after three targets in the south: the motor torpedo boat bases at Quang Khe and Phuc Loi as well as the Vinh oil storage depot. At the last-named target, American planes set fire to 12 of the 14 oil storage tanks sending almost 10 percent of North Vietnam&#x27;s oil reserves up in smoke. Of more lasting significance both to the warship and the country, however, the incident prompted the United States Congress to pass the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, the legal foundation for the United States to deploy conventional US military forces and directly confront North Vietnam in open warfare; which would ultimately involve the United States in a bloody and costly war in Indochina for the ensuing eight and a half years. Throughout that period, the &quot;Turner Joy&quot; would serve repeatedly throughout the conflict.

==Vietnam War operations==
Following the excitement of the first week in August, the destroyer resumed more routine operations in the South China Sea. She concluded her deployment when she reached Long Beach on 2 October—two months to the day since she had rushed to the aid of &quot;Maddox&quot;. The destroyer conducted normal operations out of Long Beach until 18 December when she entered the naval shipyard for a three-month overhaul. Late in March, she began refresher training out of San Diego. West coast operations occupied her until 10 July, when she departed Long Beach with DesRon 19, bound once again for duty in the Orient. At the end of a 21-day transit, Turner Joy joined near the end of the month. During August and the first three weeks of September, the destroyer served both as an escort for the carrier and as a detached radar picket ship.

On 23 September, she moved into the Gulf of Thailand near the west coast of South Vietnam to participate in one of the earliest naval gunfire support missions conducted along that section of the coastline. After a brief respite in Subic Bay for upkeep, the warship returned to the &quot;gunline&quot; in October, this time along South Vietnam&#x27;s southeastern coast between Cape St. Jacques and Chu Lai. On 25 September, she provided call-fire for American and South Vietnamese forces operating ashore in the vicinity of Chu Lai itself. During the mission, her guns destroyed a number of enemy positions and figured prominently in the repulse of a Viet Cong attack. Near the conclusion of that 24-hour action, a 5-inch round misfired; and, during the ensuing efforts to clear the chamber, the shell detonated. The explosion damaged the gun mount, killed three sailors, and wounded three more. That event forced her departure from the combat zone. After landing the three casualties at Da Nang, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; set course for Subic Bay in the Philippines. After a week of repairs, the destroyer departed Subic Bay in company with &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; for screening duty in the South China Sea, followed by port calls at Hong Kong and at Yokosuka, Japan. At the end of the year, she returned to naval gunfire support duty off the coast of South Vietnam.

On 3 January 1966, the destroyer resumed plane guard duty with &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; in the South China Sea. The destroyer patrolled with the carrier on Yankee Station until 14 January when she headed, via Subic Bay, for Long Beach. &quot;Turner Joy&quot; arrived home on 1 February and, two weeks later, began a month-long restricted availability. From the completion of her overhaul in March through the end of May, the destroyer remained in Long Beach engaged in upkeep, repairs, and in training the numerous replacements who had reported on board. On 11 June, she put to sea once again to conduct a midshipman training cruise, during which she visited Pearl Harbor, Seattle, and San Francisco. &quot;Turner Joy&quot; concluded that operation on 29 July when she disembarked the midshipmen at Long Beach. Later that summer, she again visited Seattle in conjunction with that city&#x27;s annual Seafair celebration. Additional training and upkeep at Long Beach followed and occupied her until the second week in October. At that time, she returned to sea to participate in fleet exercise &quot;Baseline II,&quot; after which she proceeded to Long Beach for a series of repairs in preparation for another tour of duty in the western Pacific. Turner Joy stood out of Long Beach on 18 November and—after visits to Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Guam—entered port at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on 11 December.

&quot;Turner Joy&quot;&#x27;s fourth deployment to the western Pacific brought her three tours of duty off the coast of Vietnam and concluded with a visit to Australia. On 15 December, she departed Kaohsiung and headed for the coastline of the II Corps area of South Vietnam. The destroyer reached her zone of operations on the 18th and, for the next month, conducted shore bombardments in support of American and South Vietnamese troops operating ashore. She concluded that assignment on 17 January 1967 and headed for the Philippines. After two weeks of availability at Subic Bay and a five-day liberty visit to Hong Kong, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; returned to the Vietnamese coast on 10 February. For almost a month, she delivered gunfire support for troops ashore, this time in the I Corps zone of South Vietnam. That duty ended on 3 March, and a nine-day tender availability alongside in Sasebo, Japan, followed.

On 21 March, the destroyer resumed station off Vietnam. This time, however, off the coast of North Vietnam. Instead of supporting American and South Vietnamese troops directly through shore bombardments, she did so by interdicting enemy logistical efforts in Operation Sea Dragon. Though primarily directed at the enemy&#x27;s water-borne logistics, &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; also struck wherever possible at the enemy&#x27;s overland supply lines. During her 26 days on station engaged in &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; operations, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; fired on a number of shore targets in addition to an even larger number of enemy waterborne logistics craft. On 7 April, while firing on some enemy craft beached near Cap Mui Ron, the destroyer came under the fire of a North Vietnamese shore battery. During that exchange, she suffered a direct hit on the fantail and a near-miss air burst above the forward mast. The hit astern penetrated the deck to the supply office, damaging records therein as well as pipes and cables in the overhead. Several rounds of 5 inch VT fragmentation projectiles in mount 53 ammunition stowage area also suffered damage and had to be discarded. Shrapnel from near misses wounded a member of &quot;Turner Joy&quot;&#x27;s repair party and peppered her bow while the air burst above the forward mast put her air-search radar out of service except for its IFF aspect. The damage, however, was not severe enough to curtail her tour of duty; and she remained on station until relieved by on 16 April.

Two days later, the destroyer arrived in Subic Bay, and she entered drydock, soon thereafter, for repairs to her strut bearing, the bow, the peak tank, and her air search radar antenna. Concurrently with this yard work, she conducted a tender availability with to prepare her for visits to Australia and New Zealand during the forthcoming celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. Repairs and availability completed, she stood out of Subic Bay on 24 April in company with . En route to Melbourne, the two ships stopped at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands and at Brisbane, Australia. The ship reached Melbourne on 8 May; and, while she remained there until the 13th, her crew enjoyed Australian hospitality in the city and replied in kind on board. Between 13 and 17 May, she made a rough transit of the Tasman Sea and arrived in Auckland, New Zealand, on the latter date for the second phase of her Coral Sea celebration. She remained in Auckland until 22 May at which time she and &quot;McKean&quot; put to sea to return to the United States. After a stop at Pago Pago, American Samoa, the two ships rejoined and &quot;Maddox&quot; on 26 May to reconstitute DesRon 19 for the voyage home. After a brief fueling stop at Pearl Harbor on 2 June, the warships arrived in Long Beach on 8 June. Between June and September, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; went through a month of post-deployment standdown followed by training operations in the waters off southern California. On 18 September, she arrived at Bremerton, Washington, for a two-month shipyard availability at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. In mid-November, she returned to Long Beach and resumed operations along the California coast.

That duty continued until late February 1968 when she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability in preparation for her fifth deployment to the Far East. &quot;Turner Joy&quot; stood out of Long Beach on 12 March and—after stops at Oahu, Midway, and Guam—arrived in Subic Bay on 4 April. Over the following five months, the destroyer conducted operations along the coast of Vietnam similar to those performed during previous deployments. She delivered naval gunfire support for American and South Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam and conducted &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; patrols along the coast of North Vietnam to interdict enemy waterborne logistics traffic. Her tours of duty on the gunline took her to the I, II and IV Corps areas of South Vietnam. As during previous deployments, she punctuated assignments in the combat zone with visits to Subic Bay and to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, for fuel, supplies, and repairs, as well as to Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and Hong Kong for rest and relaxation. She completed her last tour of duty of the deployment off the Vietnamese coast on 4 September and, after a brief tender availability at Subic Bay, headed homeward on 8 September. Retracing her outward-bound voyage with stops at Guam, Midway, and Pearl Harbor, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; entered Long Beach on 26 September.

Upon her return to the United States, the warship began preparations for her regular overhaul. She entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 28 November and remained there until late February 1969. When post-overhaul trials ended on 15 March, the ship resumed normal operations out of Long Beach. During April and May, she participated in a 1st Fleet combined ASW/AAW exercise as a part of her refresher training. She completed those operations during the latter half of May; and, after a. brief availability alongside , she embarked NROTC midshipmen on 5 June for the two-month 1969 summer training cruise. At the end of the cruise, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; debarked the midshipmen on 1 August and resumed training in the southern California operating area.

On 18 November, she got underway from Long Beach to return to the Orient. Following a four-day layover at Pearl Harbor and brief fuel stops at Midway and Guam, she arrived in Subic Bay on 11 December. After a five-day availability alongside , the destroyer stood out of Subic Bay bound for Danang, South Vietnam, and gunfire support duty off the coast of the I Corps zone. By New Year&#x27;s Day 1970, she was on her way to Yankee Station to act as plane guard for Task Force (TF) 77 aircraft carriers. On 4 January, she headed back to Subic Bay where she remained until the 18th. She completed another three-week tour on the gunline on 10 February and then shaped a course for Sasebo, Japan, whence she operated until early in March. After a liberty call in Hong Kong, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; returned to the Vietnamese coast and resumed gunfire support missions until early April. On 3 April, she rendezvoused with and then made port calls at Subic Bay and Bangkok, Thailand, before embarking upon her final gunline assignment on 19 April. She returned to Subic Bay on 10 May for a final visit before heading back to the United States on the 17th.

The destroyer arrived back in Long Beach on 1 June and began a three-month restricted availability in the naval shipyard. She completed the availability early in October and began sea trials and training in the southern California operating area. Early in December, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; reentered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard to be readied for her redeployment to the western Pacific. On 26 January 1971, she stood out of Long Beach on her way to rejoin the 7th Fleet. She entered Subic Bay on 16 February and went into drydock for several days while both her propellers were replaced. On 5 March, she exited Subic Bay for a tour of naval gunfire support duty along the Vietnamese coast. That assignment—carried out along the I Corps-zone coastline near Danang—ended on 2 April; and she headed for Yankee Station and two weeks of plane guard duty with the TF 77 aircraft carriers. Following a five-day port call at Subic Bay, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; took up position at Yankee Station again on 27 April—this time as escort for the PIRAZ (positive identification and radar advisory zone) ship. She performed that duty until 30 April; then, after three days evading a typhoon, she moved in close to the I Corps shoreline to resume gunfire support duties.

On 14 May, the destroyer shaped a course for Subic Bay. Following a five-day gunfire exercise at the Tabones range, she departed the Philippines to make liberty visits to Bangkok, Thailand, and Hong Kong. In late June, she did another tour of duty on PIRAZ station and provided plane guard services to &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;. A brief liberty call at Subic Bay followed; and then, on 30 June, she embarked upon a voyage to Australia and New Zealand. During July, she made visits to the Australian towns of Brisbane and Sydney as well as Auckland, New Zealand. On 26 July &quot;Turner Joy&quot; got underway for home. She arrived back in Long Beach on 10 August and conducted normal post-deployment evolutions through the remainder of 1971.

In February 1972, the destroyer began an extensive overhaul. Over the ensuing six months, she received entirely new 5 inch 54-caliber gun mounts; and her propulsion plant underwent conversion to enable it to burn Navy distillate fuel. Extensive other modifications, installations, and renovations also took place between February and August. From August to December, she busied herself with various trials and tests at sea, conducted refresher training, and prepared for her next assignment to the Far East. Her voyage west began on 6 December and ended with her arrival at Subic Bay on the 29th. Two days later, she put to sea for her first tour on the gunline. It also proved to be her last. She delivered gunfire support for 28 days, &quot;delivering over 10,000 rounds of accurate fire in support of ground forces in South Vietnam and against enemy targets in North Vietnam&quot;. &quot;USS &quot;Turner Joy&quot; fired the final round of naval gunfire of the war, hitting the beach at 000 GMT, 28 January 1973, scant seconds before the ceasefire went into effect&quot;. Then, on 28 January 1973, American participation in the Vietnam War ended with a negotiated ceasefire.

For the remainder of that deployment, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; participated in a variety of operations—including Operation End Sweep, the removal of American mines from the waters around Haiphong harbor, as well as antisubmarine warfare exercises and carrier operations in the South China Sea. She punctuated those assignments with port visits to Subic Bay; Hong Kong; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and Sasebo, Japan. On 13 June, she headed home via Yokosuka and arrived in Long Beach on 22 June. She spent the period from then until mid-October engaged in upkeep and a restricted availability. On 17 October, she departed Long Beach and set course for her new home port, San Diego. Upon arrival there, she began normal operations—engineering and gunnery exercises at sea alternated with upkeep in port.

That routine continued until April 1974, at which time she began preparations for her first peacetime deployment to the western Pacific in a decade. She stood out of San Diego on 6 May, reached Pearl Harbor on the 12th, and completed a brief assignment with in the Hawaiian operating area on 24 May. On that day, she departed Oahu and continued her voyage west. &quot;Turner Joy&quot; arrived in Subic Bay on 4 June and, for the next two months, conducted local operations in company with &quot;Ranger&quot;. On 1 August, the destroyer departed the Philippines for a goodwill visit to Surabaya, Indonesia. She returned to the Philippines on 31 August and conducted local operations out of Subic Bay for two months before heading homeward on 3 October. The warship arrived in San Diego on 22 October and, after a month of post-deployment leave and upkeep, began a normal schedule of operations in the southern California operating area.

==Post-Vietnam War operations==

&quot;Turner Joy&quot; ended 1974 and began 1975 engaged in a rather extensive availability which was completed in mid-April. At the conclusion of that repair period, she resumed operations along the coast of southern California. Refresher training, FleetEx 2-75, and a midshipman training cruise occupied her from April through August. On 2 September, she departed San Diego for the 11th deployment of her career to the western Pacific. However, after a two-week stop at Subic Bay, her western Pacific assignment was transformed into a tour of duty in the Indian Ocean.

On 13 October, she departed Subic Bay in company with , , and bound ultimately for Bandar Abbas, Iran. Along the way, she visited Singapore and Sri Lanka and participated in exercises with the Singaporean Navy. The destroyer arrived in Bandar Abbas on 13 November whence she and her sailing companions participated in the CENTO exercise, &quot;Midlink&quot;. During that operation, she joined units of the British, Iranian, and Pakistani navies in practicing a broad spectrum of naval tactics—ASW, AAW, surface engagements, gunnery drills, and missile shoots.

&quot;Midlink&quot; ended on 25 November, and &quot;Turner Joy&quot; briefly stopped again at Bandar Abbas before heading for the Philippines on 29 November. She arrived back in Subic Bay on 12 December and remained there until 9 January 1976. Routine operations in the Philippines, exercises in the South China Sea and the Sea of Japan—as well as visits to ports in Taiwan and Japan—characterized the remainder of that deployment, which also included a harrowing cruise directly through the center of a typhoon. On 17 March, she stood out of Yokosuka to return to the United States. After stops at Midway and Pearl Harbor, she reentered San Diego harbor on 4 April. Following post-deployment standdown, the destroyer reverted once more to training operations out of San Diego.

On 4 July 1976, the &quot;Turner Joy&quot; steamed up the San Joaquin River more than from San Francisco Bay to participate in Stockton&#x27;s Bicentennial celebrations, making her the first ship-of-the-line to visit that city.

As a result of long years of service in Vietnam and two delays in a scheduled overhaul, however, &quot;Turner Joy&quot; was unable to successfully complete her Operational Propulsion Plant Examination. This deficiency made it necessary for the ship to spend the remainder of 1976 in port correcting propulsion deficiencies.

After an extended period in dry-dock at Long Beach. the ship went to San Diego mid-1979 for crewing to test the work done. After Engineering Quals were passed the ship was provisioned for a Westpac/South Pac goodwill cruise. The tour consists of going to Hawaii for more Quals in all departments. Then on to the Philippines for repairs on needed items. After 2 weeks there it went on to Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, &amp; New Zealand. During this time the ship did sea trials with the Australia and New Zealand navies. Upon departing the ship stopped at Pago Pago on the way back to Hawaii before returning to the US. The ship arrived in San Diego in November 1980.

==Fate==
In 1982, as the new &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyers joined the fleet, the Navy announced the retirement of &quot;Turner Joy&quot; and her sister ships saying, &quot;...the cost of modernizing them is far greater than the benefits that could be derived from continued service.&quot;

&quot;Turner Joy&quot; was decommissioned 22 November 1982 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register 13 February 1990. The Bremerton Historic Ships Association obtained &quot;Turner Joy&quot; from the inactive fleet and after refurbishing her and constructing appropriate access to the ship, opened her to the public in 1992 in Bremerton, Washington.

== In popular culture ==
The rock band Turnerjoy took their name from the USS &quot;Turner Joy&quot;. The band Turnerjoy was active from 1998 to 2003 and is the subject of the 2020 documentary &quot;Get Out of Home&quot;.

<text>Edmund Bailey O&#x27;Callaghan, (probably 27 February 1797 – 29 May 1880) was an Irish doctor, historian and journalist.

== Career ==
Born in Mallow, County Cork, Ireland, he studied medicine in Paris and immigrated to Lower Canada in 1823 where he became involved in the political reform movement of the Parti patriote. He was registered to practice medicine in Lower Canada on 16 October 1827.

On the death of Daniel Tracey, owner of the &quot;Montreal Vindicator&quot; newspaper, in 1832 O&#x27;Callaghan became the editor and brought in Thomas Storrow Brown to work on the paper. They proved to be an irreducible adversary of Lord Gosford and the status quo. In 1834, O&#x27;Callaghan was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Yamaska. In office, he was a close supporter of Louis Joseph Papineau.

In 1837, during the Lower Canada Rebellion, a mandate of arrest was issued against him, and he sought refuge at Saint-Denis, then crossed the United States border with his friend, Louis-Joseph Papineau. Later, O&#x27;Callaghan became secretary-archivist of the State of New York, and died there in 1880.

<doc id="527687" wikidata="Q7351192" url="?curid=527687" title="Robert Wirch">
<text>Robert W. Wirch (born November 16, 1943) is an American Democratic politician from Kenosha County, Wisconsin. He is a member of the Wisconsin Senate, representing Wisconsin&#x27;s 22nd Senate district since 1997. He previously served two terms in the Wisconsin State Assembly, from 1993 to 1997, and served on the Kenosha County Board of Supervisors before that.

==Early life and education==
Wirch was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and has lived his entire life in the Kenosha area. He graduated from Mary D. Bradford High School and went to work at the American Brass Company plant in Kenosha, following in the steps of his father and grandfather. While working at the plant, Wirch also enlisted in the United States Army Reserve, serving from 1965 to 1971. He attended night courses at the University of Wisconsin–Parkside and obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1970.

==Early political career==
While working at American Brass, Wirch was a union employee and became a member of the United Steelworkers Local 9322. He rose within the union, eventually become president of the local and a member of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO executive board. His work in the union led him into politics, as he worked with the growing number of dislocated workers from de-industrialization in southeast Wisconsin. Wirch&#x27;s own employer, American Brass, was shedding jobs through a series of ownership changes.

In 1985, Wirch announced his first run for public office, running for a seat on the Kenosha County board of supervisors. He won that election, in April 1986, and served eight years on the county board. He became chairman of the county board&#x27;s health and human services committee; one of his major initiatives in that capacity was the establishment of the Shalom Center shelter and food pantry.

In 1992, incumbent state representative John Antaramian was elected mayor of Kenosha and announced he would not run for re-election to the Assembly later that year. Wirch declared his candidacy to succeed Antaramian in the Wisconsin State Assembly. He faced Kenosha city councilmembers Wanda Lynn Bellow and Stephen Casey in the September 1992 Democratic Party primary election. Wirch prevailed with 45% of the vote and went on to win 74% of the general election vote in the heavily Democratic district. He won re-election in 1994 with 70% of the vote.

==Wisconsin Senate==
In 1996, state senator Joseph F. Andrea announced he would retire after 20 years in the legislature. Two days later, Andrea stood with Wirch as he announced his campaign to succeed Andrea in the Wisconsin Senate. Also attending and endorsing Wirch were state representative James Kreuser, mayor John Antaramian, and sheriff Allan Kehl. With such unified support from Kenosha County Democrats, Wirch faced no opponent in the primary. Wirch faced Kenosha lawyer Bruno Rizzo in the general election, prevailing with 56% of the vote.

Wirch&#x27;s district, the 22nd Senate district, was considered one of the more competitive seats in the Senate under the legislative district plans prior to 2010, comprising most of Kenosha County. Wirch faced an opponent in every election; his closest race was in 2004, when he won just 52% of the vote against Reince Priebus, who would later become chairman of the Republican National Committee and White House chief of staff.

===2011 Act 10 and recall===
After the 2010 election, Republicans gained full control of state government. One of the first legislative initiatives of the new governor, Scott Walker, was the so-called &quot;Budget Repair Bill&quot;, which stripped state employee unions of their collective bargaining rights. This immediately resulted in mass protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol, which continued for months. With Democrats unable to slow down consideration of the bill, Wirch fled the state along with 13 other Democratic senators, in order to deny a quorum.

Republicans were eventually able to circumvent the quorum requirement by stripping out budgetary items from the bill. After the bill became law, Democrats attempted to capitalize on the outrage caused by the passage of the anti-union legislation and shifted to a recall campaign over the next year. Republicans countered by attempting to recall several Democrats who had fled the state, and Wirch was one of the senators targeted.

On February 24, 2011, &quot;Taxpayers to Recall Robert Wirch&quot; officially registered with the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board. On April 21, they filed 18,300 signatures with Wisconsin&#x27;s Government Accountability Board, far surpassing the 13,537 signatures needed to trigger a recall election. Wirch&#x27;s recall election was set for August 16, 2011; Wirch faced Kenosha attorney Jonathan Steitz and prevailed with 57% of the vote.

===Senate minority===

Another effect of the new Republican government was a dramatic legislative gerrymander, passed in August of 2011, just before the recall elections. Under the new map, Wirch&#x27;s district was significantly altered. Rural Kenosha County was removed from the district and replaced with the city of Racine, in Racine County; the changes packed most of the Democratic votes of Racine and Kenosha counties into Wirch&#x27;s district and converted the neighboring 21st Senate district into a safely Republican seat. The new plan also drew Wirch out of the district, removing all of Pleasant Prairie, where his home is located. Wirch chose to purchase an apartment in Somers in order to maintain residency in the district and run for re-election. In his new district, Wirch won an easy re-election in 2012 with 70% of the vote and did not face an opponent in 2016 or 2020.

After the 2012 elections, Wirch obtained a coveted seat on the powerful budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. State political observers speculated that he received the seat in exchange for his vote for Chris Larson as minority leader.

In 2017, Wirch was the only Democrat in the state Senate who voted in favor of the three billion dollar tax incentive package for the Foxconn in Wisconsin project. In explaining his vote, Wirch referred back to his own history as a third generation factory worker, watching those jobs shipped overseas, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not a great deal, but it&#x27;s the only deal on the table.&quot; After the 2024 redistricting, the Foxconn in Wisconsin industrial park is now within the boundaries of Wirch&#x27;s district.

==Personal life==
Wirch resides in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. Mary, his wife of 47 years, died on February 23, 2020, from complications related to gall bladder cancer. They have two adult children, David and Julia.

Wirch is a member of the Danish Brotherhood in America, the Polish Legion of American Veterans, and was previously a member of the board of directors of the Kenosha Boys &amp; Girls Club.

<text>RollerCoaster Tycoon is a series of construction and management simulation games about building and managing an amusement park. Each game in the series challenges players with open-ended amusement park management and development, and allowing players to construct and customize their own unique roller coasters and other thrill rides.

The first game was created by Scottish programmer Chris Sawyer, with assistance from various leading figures from the real-world roller coaster and theme park industry. The rest of the series contains three other main games, expansion packs, a number of ports, and a mobile installment. A refresh of the series, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon World&quot;, was released in November 2016, and followed up by &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures&quot; for Nintendo Switch in 2018 and PC in 2019.

Licensing for the series is currently held by Atari Interactive, who renewed their deal with Chris Sawyer on 11 October 2022, for ten more years.

==Main series==
===&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot;===

&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; was released for Microsoft Windows on 22 March 1999. &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; was later ported to the Xbox Video game console in 2003. The game was developed by Chris Sawyer and published by Hasbro Interactive under the MicroProse brand.

&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; received two expansion packs: &quot;Added Attractions&quot; (released in North America as &quot;Corkscrew Follies&quot;) in 1999, and &quot;Loopy Landscapes&quot; in 2000. Two special editions were released: &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Gold&quot;/&quot;Totally RollerCoaster&quot; in 2002, which contained the original game, &quot;Corkscrew Follies&quot;, and &quot;Loopy Landscapes&quot;; and &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Deluxe&quot; in 2003, which contained the content in &quot;Gold&quot; plus more designs for the different customizable rides.

A port for the Xbox was released on 23 March 2003, handled by Frontier Developments and published by Infogrames Interactive. This version featured both expansion packs as well.

===&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot;===

&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot; was released on 15 October 2002. The game was developed by Chris Sawyer and published by Infogrames Interactive.

&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot; has two official expansion packs: &quot;Wacky Worlds&quot; and &quot;Time Twister&quot;, both released in 2003 and had no involvement from Chris Sawyer, instead being handled by Frontier Developments. The &quot;Combo Park Pack&quot; edition contains the original game and the &quot;Wacky Worlds&quot; expansion. The &quot;Triple Thrill Pack&quot; contains the original game and both expansions.

In April 2014, an open-source project, known as OpenRCT2, was launched to enhance the gameplay of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, including fixing bugs and allowing the game to run natively on macOS, Linux and modern Windows. The game is completely rewritten in the C++ programming language, but still relies on assets from the original game. OpenRCT2 reduces limitations in the original, and adds other completely new features such as multiplayer.

===&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;===

&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; was released on 2 November 2004, in North America. Although the core features of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; are based on the previous games, Chris Sawyer, the developer of the first two games, acted only as a consultant. The game was developed by Frontier Developments instead, and published and advertised by Atari Interactive featuring a completely different structure.

Two expansion packs for &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; were released - &quot;Soaked!&quot; and &quot;Wild!&quot;. A bundle, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Gold&quot;, was also released, including the original game and the &quot;Soaked!&quot; expansion pack; this was followed by &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum&quot; (Deluxe for the EU version of the game), including both expansion packs and the original game. &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum&quot; was released for Microsoft Windows and MacOS X.

A remastered version of the game titled &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition&quot;, developed and published by Frontier Foundry, was released for Windows, macOS, and Nintendo Switch, featuring widescreen support and revamped controls to accommodate for Switch features.

===&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon World&quot;===

&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon World&quot; was developed by Nvizzio Creations for Atari Interactive and RCTO Productions and released on 16 November 2016. The installment is different from previous games in that players build coasters with a spline-based system. It also introduced a new &quot;Architect mode&quot; and &quot;safety-rating&quot; options when building coasters. The game is also the first to incorporate the Steam Workshop.

The game received largely negative reviews, both from critics and fans of the franchise, particularly compared to &quot;Planet Coaster&quot;, which was released the day after and received largely positive reviews.

==Spinoffs==
===&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D&quot;===

&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D&quot; was released on 16 October 2012. It was developed by n-Space for the Nintendo 3DS. While using many assets and engine content from &quot;Rollercoaster Tycoon 3&quot;, this game reverted to an isometric view and, due to the limitations of the Nintendo 3DS, removed features such as additional scenery and pools.

===&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile&quot;===

&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile&quot; was released on 10 April 2014. The game was initially available for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices. The game was later released for Android devices (OS 4.0.3 and higher) on 18 October 2014. The game was developed by On5 Games without Chris Sawyer&#x27;s input (other than licensing). The game returns to the isometric view used in the first two games. The game is built on the freemium model with social media integration.

This installment was universally panned amongst fans and critics alike. It was criticized due to Chris Sawyer&#x27;s absence in the making of the game and the heavy use of microtransactions and wait times.

===&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Mobile Edition&quot;===
Released in August 2015, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Mobile Edition&quot; is an iOS version of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; developed and published by Frontier and is a faithful port of the original game (tutorial mode, original 18 scenarios for career, and a sandbox).

===&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic&quot;===

On 22 December 2016, a modified port of both &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; and &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot; was released for iOS and Android, featuring a single price point for the majority of content from both of the original games. It also features three in-app purchases for Expansion Pack content, based on the two expansion packs from &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot; and an editor pack that allows users to create custom scenarios.

===&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Touch&quot;===
First released for iOS devices in December 2016, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Touch&quot; is a free-to-play mobile port of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon World&quot;. Like &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 4&quot;, it contains in-app purchases and wait times, but expands upon the social media integration. An Android version was released in April 2017. In October 2017, items based on the Barbie brand were added to the game. On 28 January, items based on Shaun the Sheep were added to the game.

===&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Joyride&quot;===
An on-rails shooter based on the RollerCoaster Tycoon franchise, named RollerCoaster Tycoon Joyride, was released in 2018. The game was poorly received.

===&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures&quot;===
In January 2018, Atari Game Partners announced it was seeking equity crowdfunding via the StartEngine platform in order to develop a new game in the series. Titled &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures&quot;, it is an adaption of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Touch&quot; and was released for the Nintendo Switch in Europe on 29 November 2018, and in North America on 13 December. The game was also released on Microsoft Windows via the Epic Games Store on 19 March 2019.

In 2023, Atari released an updated version with new content and features, titled &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures Deluxe&quot;. &quot;Deluxe&quot; is available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, and Nintendo Switch.

===&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon Puzzle&quot;===
RollerCoaster Tycoon Puzzle (originally known as RollerCoaster Tycoon Story) is a free-to-play entry in the series developed by Graphite Lab. Atari released the game in January 2020 for iOS and Android mobile devices.

The free-to-play title is based on the tile-matching genre, in which the tiles to match move each turn on rollercoaster tracks within each level. Completing levels helps the player to restore a run-down theme park as part of the game&#x27;s narrative.

==Gameplay==
The player is given control over an amusement park and is tasked with reaching particular goals, such as improving the park&#x27;s value, attracting more guests, or maintaining the park rating. Some scenarios in the game provide an empty plot of land and allow the player to build a park from scratch, while others provide a ready-built park which usually suffers from deterioration, bad planning, or underdevelopment. The player must wisely invest the limited amount of money provided.

Most scenarios require that the goals be achieved by a specific in-game date, or else the scenario is not &#x27;complete&#x27;. Completion of scenarios is a prerequisite for unlocking further scenarios in the first &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; game. In &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot;, all the scenarios are available for play and the player can complete them in any order they choose.

The player is responsible for building out the park such as modifying terrain, constructing footpaths, adding decorative elements, installing food/drink stalls and other facilities, and building rides and attractions. Many of the rides that can be built are roller coasters or variations on that, such as log flumes, water slides and go-kart tracks. The player can build these out with hills, drops, curves, and other &#x27;special&#x27; track pieces (such as loops, corkscrews and helixes), limited only by cost and the geography of the park and other nearby attractions. There are also stationary rides, such as Ferris wheels, merry-go-rounds, and bumper cars, most of which only contain single ride &#x27;piece&#x27; and are very limited in terms of variation. Rides are ranked on scales of excitement, intensity, and nausea, all which influence which park guests will ride those attractions and how they will behave afterward. The player can set the prices for park admission rides and guest amenities, although care must be taken so that guests will not think prices are too high. The player is also responsible for hiring park staff to maintain the rides, keep the park clean, enforce security, and entertain guests. Players may also invest in &#x27;research&#x27;, which unlocks new rides and improvements as time goes on, though it costs money to continue research. Research in a particular category is disabled when all attractions in that category are researched.

The guests, who are integral to the gameplay, are treated as separate entities which can each have particular characteristics and be tracked by the player around the park. The game keeps track of how much money they have, what they are carrying, their thoughts, and what their current needs are (thirst, hunger, etc.). Each guest also has some unique features such as their preferred ride intensity, and their nausea tolerance. Some scenarios are even biased towards a specific guest demographic and require the player to take this into account in designing the park. In &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;, the player can create their own guest groups to visit their parks.

Sequels have continually upgraded the number of rides and amount of customization available to the player.

==Legacy==
&quot;Planet Coaster&quot;, which has been called a spiritual successor to &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;, was developed and published by Frontier Developments for Microsoft Windows and was released worldwide on 17 November 2016. Frontier Developments had previously worked in the amusement park construction and management genre with the Xbox port of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot;, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;, &quot;Thrillville&quot;, &quot;Thrillville: Off the Rails&quot;, and &quot;Zoo Tycoon&quot;.

&quot;Parkitect&quot;, released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux on 29 November 2018 after two years in early access, is similarly considered to be a spiritual successor to the first two RollerCoaster Tycoon games.

&quot;OpenRCT2&quot; (2014) is a free and open-source re-implementation of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot; which adds some additional features and fixes numerous bugs.

Several user-created rollercoasters received media attention after footage of them were posted on various imageboards and social media.

The &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; series spawned a popular Internet meme based on a series of posts made in 2012 on 4chan featuring a slow, ghost train track ride called &quot;Mr. Bones&#x27; Wild Ride&quot; that took four in-game years to complete, leading the passengers in the game to express &quot;I want to get off Mr. Bones Wild Ride&quot;. At the ride&#x27;s conclusion, the passengers were then greeted by a skeleton prop with a top hat, with a sign stating &quot;The ride never ends&quot;. Both phrases have become popular memes.

&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; has been cited as an inspiration of professionals working in the real-life rollercoaster industry.

==Other media==
The franchise has also spawned a board game and a pinball machine by Stern, both released in 2002, and a series of gamebooks released in 2002 and 2003. In 2010, it was reported that Sony Pictures Animation had acquired the rights to develop a film adaptation of the series.

<doc id="527703" wikidata="Q1760548" url="?curid=527703" title="USS Maddox (DD-731)">
<text>USS &quot;Maddox&quot; (DD-731), was an . It was named after Captain William A. T. Maddox of the United States Marine Corps.

&quot;Maddox&quot; screened the ships of the Fast Carrier Task Force during strikes against Japanese targets in the western Pacific. She was hit by a Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft off Formosa on 21 January 1945. Later, she covered the Marine landings at Okinawa and operated with the 7th Fleet in support of United Nations Forces during the Korean War. &quot;Maddox&quot; participated in the Blockade of Wonsan, an 861-day siege and bombardment of the city.

After 1953, she alternated operations along the west coast of the United States and in Hawaiian waters, with regular deployments to the western Pacific with the Seventh Fleet. &quot;Maddox&quot; departed Long Beach 13 March 1964. At first steaming with fast carrier groups in the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea, she headed south 18 May and established patrol off the coast of South Vietnam. During August she was involved in a skirmish with North Vietnamese torpedo boats, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which led to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and increased U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.

==Construction and career==
She was laid down by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath in Maine on 28 October 1943, launched on 19 March 1944 by Mrs. Harry H. Wilhoit, granddaughter of Captain Maddox, and commissioned on 2 June 1944.

=== Service in the United States Navy ===

==== World War II ====
Following shakedown and antisubmarine exercises, &quot;Maddox&quot; departed Boston on 27 August for Norfolk, Virginia on route to the Pacific. Arriving at Ulithi 21 October 1944, she was assigned to Fast Carrier TG 38.1 of the 3d Fleet. As a member of this task group, &quot;Maddox&quot; took part in the preparation and the covering operations for the Mindoro and Luzon invasions, 4 November 1944 to 21 January 1945. During this period she served in the screen and on picket station in the South and East China Seas, while carrier-based planes struck air and naval bases from Saigon to Formosa. Hit by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; off Formosa on 21 January 1945, &quot;Maddox&quot; headed for Ulithi for repairs. Departing on 14 March, the destroyer steamed off the Japanese home islands where she was on picket station during the air strikes on Kyushu and southern Honshu. She proceeded to Okinawa on 23 March to provide support for preinvasion strikes, remaining on duty there after the invasion date of 1 April. For almost three months, until 13 June 1945, &quot;Maddox&quot; continued to provide support for this campaign in the form of shore bombardment and carrier screening for raids on Kyushu and Shikoku.

On 8 July, &quot;Maddox&quot; sailed from Leyte to participate in the operations of the third Fleet off the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido. From 10 July until the cessation of offensive action 15 August, she provided screening, picket, and shore bombardment services.

Following the Japanese surrender, &quot;Maddox&quot; continued to patrol off Japan until departing Tokyo Bay 20 September with military passengers for the United States. Delivering her passengers to San Francisco on 5 October, she proceeded to San Diego, arriving on the 14th. She operated there until 1 February 1946, when she returned to the Far East to support the movement of naval occupation forces between Shanghai, Qingdao, and Taku in China, and the ports of Pusan and Jinsen in Korea.

====Korean War====
Returning to San Diego 24 March 1947, she operated for the next three years off the west coast conducting reserve training cruises, serving as a training ship in antisubmarine warfare and gunnery and participating in maneuvers with the 1st Task Fleet.

On 1 May 1950, &quot;Maddox&quot; departed San Diego for the Far East, arriving Hong Kong 26 June, the day after the commencement of hostilities in Korea. Departing for South Korea the next day, she acted as plane guard and antisubmarine screen for the aircraft carriers and . She operated there until August, when she departed for Formosa. On 4 May, she helped form the initial Formosa (later Taiwan) Patrol Force to prevent Communist Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

&quot;Maddox&quot; returned to Korea 7 September and assumed coastal blockade and bombardment duties. She continued this assignment, which included a diversionary bombardment of Samchok coordinated with the Inchon landings on 15 September, until departing for the United States early in January 1951. Arriving at San Diego on 31 January 1951, she served as a training ship and underwent overhaul before departing 1 December 1951 for her second Korean duty. Through February 1952, she screened carriers off the east coast of Korea and provided shore bombardment support for the U.N. land forces. During March she operated with the Taiwan Patrol Force, returning to Korea in April. From 16 April through 17 May she participated in the siege of Wonsan, following which she resumed screening duties for fast carriers.

In June &quot;Maddox&quot; returned to San Diego, arriving on 26 June, to stay only one month before departing for her new home port of Long Beach. After local operations and overhaul, &quot;Maddox&quot; again sailed for the Far East on 2 February 1953. As on her second Korean deployment, the destroyer again guarded the fast carriers along the eastern coast of Korea; participated in shore bombardments, this time as far north as Hungnam, and served, for a two-week period, in the Taiwan Patrol Force. After completing her 1953 Korean tour on 12 August she departed for Long Beach, arriving on 30 August.

====1954–1964====
&quot;Maddox&quot; operated off the west coast until the next spring. (&quot;Maddox&quot; is featured in the Hollywood film &quot;Return from the Sea&quot;, released by Allied Artists in 1954.) On 4 May 1954, she sailed for duty with the 7th Fleet. On this tour, which lasted until 5 December, she took part in antisubmarine warfare tactics and attack carrier exercises off Kyushu, Korea, and Luzon as well as operating with the Taiwan Patrol Force.

From 14 June 1955 through 2 March 1962, &quot;Maddox&quot; completed six additional cruises to the Far East. These cruises included combined defense exercises with the forces of other SEATO nations and training operations with South Korean, Nationalist Chinese, and Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Forces.

Having operated off the west coast for two years, from March 1962, &quot;Maddox&quot; departed Long Beach 13 March 1964 for another tour with the 7th Fleet. At first steaming with fast carrier groups in the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea, she headed south 18 May and established patrol off the coast of South Vietnam.

==== Gulf of Tonkin incident ====

On 31 July 1964 she commenced her first leg of a DESOTO patrol in the Tonkin Gulf. Initially a routine patrol, it later developed into a naval action with global repercussions. On 2 August 1964, &quot;Maddox&quot;, cruising in international waters 28 miles off the coast of North Vietnam, engaged three North Vietnamese Navy (NVN) P4 motor torpedo boats, from Torpedo Squadron 135. The P4s, long aluminum-hulled torpedo boats each armed with two torpedoes which mounted a TNT warhead and capable of exceeding , approached at high speeds from several miles away. The commander of the 7th Fleet&#x27;s Destroyer Division 192, Captain John J. Herrick, who was aboard &quot;Maddox&quot; in charge of the mission, ordered the ship&#x27;s captain (Commander Herbert Ogier) to have gun crews fire upon the torpedo boats if they came within . When they did, the American sailors fired three rounds to warn off the North Vietnamese boats. The NVN torpedo boats were commanded by three brothers: Van Bot commanded boat &quot;T-333&quot;, Van Tu commanded &quot;T-336&quot;, and &quot;T-339&quot; was commanded by Van Gian. The torpedo boats initially conducted their attack in numerical order, with &quot;T-333&quot; spearheading the assault. Maximum effective range for their torpedoes was , but &quot;Maddox&quot;″s 5-inch gun&#x27;s range was . As the boats pressed home their attack and came within , &quot;T-333&quot; attempted to run abeam of &quot;Maddox&quot; for a side shot, while the remaining two boats continued their stern chase. The two chasers, &quot;T-336&quot; and &quot;T-339&quot;, fired first, but due to &quot;Maddox&quot;″s heavy fire of 5-inch shells, the torpedo boats had discharged their torpedoes at excessive range, all four underwater missiles missing their mark. &quot;T-333&quot; fired its torpedoes, without effect, but dueled &quot;Maddox&quot;″s 5-inch guns with its twin machine gun, achieving one hit on the destroyer. The ship altered her course to avoid the torpedoes, which were observed passing on the starboard side. Soon, four F-8 Crusaders from an aircraft carrier in the region, , arrived on the scene and attacked the three torpedo boats. The combination of fire from &quot;Maddox&quot; and the F-8s severely damaged all three boats, and forced them to retreat to the bases from which they came. Several NVN sailors were wounded, and four were killed. No US sailors were killed or wounded, and &quot;Maddox&quot; did not sustain serious damage, save for a single bullet hole from a machine gun; one of the four Crusaders sustained some 14.5 mm machine gun fire hits, as a large portion of its left wing was &quot;missing&quot;, but managed to return to &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;.

On 4 August, another DESOTO patrol off the North Vietnamese coast was launched by &quot;Maddox&quot; and , in order to &quot;show the flag&quot; after the first incident. This time their orders indicated that the ships were to close to no more than from the coast of North Vietnam. During an evening and early morning of rough weather and heavy seas, the destroyers received radar, sonar, and radio signals that they believed signaled another attack by the North Vietnamese navy. For some two hours the ships fired on radar targets and maneuvered vigorously amid electronic and visual reports of enemies. At 0127 Washington time, Herrick sent a cable in which he admitted that the attack may never have happened and that there may actually have been no North Vietnamese craft in the area: &quot;Review of action makes many reported contacts and torpedoes fired appear doubtful. Freak weather effects on radar and overeager sonarmen may have accounted for many reports. No actual visual sightings by &quot;Maddox&quot;. Suggest complete evaluation before any further action taken.&quot; Since then, numerous accounts have supported the theory that there was no attack on 4 August at all, including North Vietnamese military commander Võ Nguyên Giáp, who in 1995 admitted 2 August attack but asserted that the 4 August attack had never occurred.
==== Vietnam War ====
After arrival at Long Beach, &quot;Maddox&quot; remained in a leave and upkeep status until mid‑January 1965, then conducted training exercises and repairs in preparation for her next WestPac deployment. She departed Long Beach on 10 July and commenced operating with the fast carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin in early August. For the next four months, &quot;Maddox&quot; alternated duty with the carriers with gunfire support missions off the coast of South Vietnam. At the end of November she sailed for home, arriving at Long Beach 16 December.

After conducting upkeep and local exercises off the California coast, summer 1966 saw her engaged in a training cruise for midshipmen which included a trip to Pearl Harbor. &quot;Maddox&quot; departed California 20 November for another deployment with the 7th Fleet, sailing by way of Pearl Harbor, Midway, Guam, and Taiwan.

After a successful tour consisting primarily of providing gunfire support, interrupted by a visit to Singapore and a crossing of the Equator on 8 February 1967, &quot;Maddox&quot; departed Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, for home by way of Australia, New Zealand, and Pearl Harbor. She arrived at Long Beach 7 June 1967 and conducted local exercises until entering Long Beach Naval Shipyard 13 October for overhaul. She remained in overhaul until February 1968; then, after refresher training off the west coast, departed for WestPac 5 July. After completion of overhaul and type training, &quot;Maddox&quot; once again deployed to the Far East in July 1968, returning in December 1968 to her home port, Long Beach, for overhaul and upkeep. &quot;Maddox&quot; was decommissioned in 1969 and assigned to the Naval Reserve Force. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 July 1972.

&quot;Maddox&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service, and six for Korean service.

===Service in the Republic of China Navy===

On 6 July 1972 she was transferred to Taiwan, commissioned into the Republic of China Navy, and renamed ROCS &quot;Po Yang&quot; (DD-10) and served with the Naval Weapons school.

Her number was later changed to DD-928.

Changed again to DD-910 in 1979.

In mid-1980s, her number was changed to DDG-910.

The ship was decommissioned on 30 June 1984 and scrapped in 1985.

Currently, the ship&#x27;s bell sits at the Museum of Military Memorabilia in Naples, Florida.

<text>Operation Market Time was the United States Navy, Republic of Vietnam Navy and Royal Australian Navy operation begun in 1965 to stop the flow of troops, war material, and supplies by sea, coast, and rivers, from North Vietnam into parts of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Also participating in Operation Market Time were United States Coast Guard&#x27;s Squadron One and Squadron Three. The U.S. Coast Guard operated, under U.S. Navy command, heavily armed patrol boats and large cutters armed with 5-inch naval guns, which were used in battle and gunfire support.

Radar picket escort ships, based in Guam or Pearl Harbor, provided long-term presence at sea offshore to guard against trawler infiltration. Originally built for World War II convoy duty, and then modified for distant early warning (&quot;DEW&quot;) duty in the North Atlantic, their sea keeping capability made them ideal for long-term presence offshore where they provided support for Patrol Craft Fast (PCF) boats, pilot rescue and sampan inspection. There were two or three on station at all times. Deployments were seven-months duration, with a four- or five-month turn-around in Pearl. When off station, they alternated duty as Taiwan Defense Patrol, with stops in Subic and Sasebo for refit mid-deployment.

Operation Market Time was one of six Navy duties begun after the Tonkin Gulf Incident, along with Operation Sea Dragon, Operation Sealords, Yankee Station, PIRAZ, and naval gunfire support.

==Background==
When a trawler was intercepted landing arms and ammunition at Vung Ro Bay in northern Khánh Hòa Province on 16 February 1965, it provided the first tangible evidence of the North Vietnamese supply operation. This became known as the Vung Ro Bay Incident. Operation Market Time was established by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff at the request of General William C. Westmoreland, commanding general of Military Assistance Command Vietnam. He requested that the U.S. Navy establish a naval blockade of the vast South Vietnam coastline against North Vietnamese gun-running trawlers. The trawlers, usually long Chinese-built steel-hulled coastal freighters, could carry several tons of arms and ammunition in their hulls. Not flying a national ensign that would identify them, the ships would maneuver &quot;innocently&quot; out in the South China Sea, waiting for the cover of darkness to make high-speed runs to the South Vietnam coastline. If successful, the ships would off load their cargoes to waiting Việt Cộng (VC) or People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces.

At the time of inception, the Coast Guard contributed seventeen Point-class cutters while the Navy added approximately fifty ships known as Patrol Craft Fast (PCFs or Swifts) that could reach a maximum speed of 28 knots. In detail, on 16 April 1965 United States Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze requested Coast Guard assistance with Market Time. On 6 May 1965, the seventeen Point-class cutters were loaded as deck cargo on merchant ships in New York City, Norfolk, New Orleans, Galveston, San Pedro, San Francisco and Seattle for transport to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay. At Subic Bay each of the cutters was armed with an 81 mm mortar and five .50 caliber machine guns. Coast Guard Squadron One was organized into Division Eleven with eight of the cutters and Division Twelve with nine of the cutters. Division Twelve sailed on 15 July 1965 and arrived at Đà Nẵng on 20 July. Division Eleven sailed on 20 July and arrived at An Thoi on 31 July. An additional nine cutters were provided to form Division Thirteen at Vũng Tàu in early 1966. Each cutter with an eleven-man crew would spend four days on patrol followed by two days alongside a support ship. All 26 cutters were turned over to South Vietnamese crews between 16 May 1969 and 15 August 1970.

==Operations==
===Coastal surveillance centers===
In an effort to coordinate all coastal interdiction activities, coastal surveillance centers (CSC) were established at Da Nang, Qui Nhon, Nha Trang, Vung Tau and An Thoi and were manned by Republic of Vietnam Navy (RVNN) and U.S. Navy watchstanders. Reports of possible sightings of suspect vessels from aircraft and watercraft were reported to the CSC&#x27;s and the appropriate response vessels and aircraft were dispatched to the scene by CSC personnel.

===Watercraft===

The objective of Operation Market Time focused on preventing communist ships from infiltrating the South Vietnamese coast to resupply PAVN/VC forces. Beginning officially on 11 March 1965, Market Time featured a picket line of ships along over of South Vietnamese coast including forces from the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy and the RVNN. The operation was originally placed under the control of the Vietnam Patrol Force (Task Force 71). Command shifted to the Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam on 31 July 1965 and designated as Task Force 115. Operation Market Time was originally planned to acquire 54 Swift boats, but that number increased to a total of 84 in September 1965 to thoroughly guard the coast of South Vietnam. These Swift boats were further separated into five groups and assigned to different areas of operation including Division 101 located at An Thoi (working alongside Coast Guard Division 11), Division 102 at Da Nang (with Coast Guard Division 12), Division 103 at Cat Lo (with Coast Guard Division 13), Division 104 based at Cam Ranh Bay and Division 105 at Qui Nhon.

Seaplane tenders , and served as flagships for Market Time.

U.S. Navy Martin P-5 Marlin seaplane patrol squadrons, destroyers, ocean minesweepers, PCFs and United States Coast Guard cutters performed the operation. Also playing a key role in the interdictions were the Navy&#x27;s patrol gunboats (PGs). The PG was uniquely suited for the job because of its ability to go from standard diesel propulsion to gas turbine (turboshaft) propulsion in a matter of a few minutes. The lightweight aluminum and fiberglass ships were fast and highly maneuverable because of their variable-pitch propellers. Most of the ships operated in the coastal waters from the Cambodian border around the south tip of Vietnam up north to Đà Nẵng. Supply ships from the Service Force, such as oilers, would bring mail, movies and fuel.

A significant action of Market Time occurred on 1 March 1968, when the North Vietnamese attempted a coordinated infiltration of four gun-running trawlers. Two of the four trawlers were destroyed by allied ships in gun battles, one trawler crew detonated charges on board their vessel to avoid capture, and the fourth trawler turned tail and retreated at high speed into the South China Sea. LT Norm Cook, the patrol plane commander of a VP-17 P-2H Neptune patrol aircraft operating from Cam Ranh Bay, was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for discovering and following two of the four trawlers in the action.

Of the many vessels involved in Operation Market Time, one of the more notable was the which, on 11 August 1966, was brought under fire by a number of United States Air Force aircraft. This incident of a &quot;blue-on-blue&quot; engagement killed two members of the cutter&#x27;s crew (one of whom was the commanding officer) and wounded nearly everyone on board.

===Aircraft===

To stop these infiltrations, Market Time was established as a coordinated effort of long range patrol aircraft for broad reconnaissance and tracking. These aircraft, initially SP-5B seaplanes, later P-2 Neptunes and Lockheed P-3 Orions, were armed with Bullpup air-to-surface missiles were capable of engaging these craft directly. Under normal conditions, U.S. and allied surface forces intercepted suspect ships that crossed inside South Vietnam&#x27;s 12-mile coastal boundary. On the aviation side, some of the patrol squadrons that were involved and flying from South Vietnam, Thailand, or Philippine bases were: VP-1, VP-2, VP-4, VP-6, VP-8, VP-9, VP-16, VP-17, VP-19 VP-22, VP-26, VP-28, VP-40, VP-42, VP-45, VP-46, VP-47, VP-48, VP-49 and VP-50.

Aircraft flew constant and monotonous patrols along of coast during Operation Market Time departing from bases ranging from Vietnam (Tan Son Nhut Airbase and Cam Ranh Bay) to the Philippines (Sangley Point) and Thailand (Utapao Airbase). Although the air support missions received little press coverage, their importance to the overall operation cannot be denied. Planes had the ability to cover large expanses of water in a relatively short time and could monitor suspicious vessels lingering in international waters waiting to make a dash for the coast. By October 1967 air surveillance expanded to monitor traffic bound to and from Cambodia as at this point it had become apparent that communist supplies were being shipped to Sihanoukville which were then transported over to the South Vietnamese border in large convoy trucks.

==Aftermath==
Market Time, which operated day and night, fair weather and foul, for eight and a half years, denied the North Vietnamese a means of delivering tons of war materials into South Vietnam by sea. Nonetheless, assessing the overall effectiveness of Operation Market Time is problematic for several reasons. The operation cannot be considered a failure in any sense, but debate over its success continues. The Navy&#x27;s Operations Evaluation Group stated that in the case of trawler infiltration after the implementation of Operation Market Time just one out of every twenty trawlers were able to reach the South Vietnamese coast undetected. 

This number is certainly encouraging, yet it does not fully reflect all possible cases in which craft reached shore unbeknownst to American intelligence. Similar to the high body count numbers in accordance with the doctrine of attrition, scholars fear that boarding and inspection numbers were also inflated by soldiers and commanders. Even considering all of these factors, Market Time had an undeniable effect on infiltration into South Vietnam. Throughout the course of 1966 alone allied forces detected 807,946 watercraft, visually inspected 223,482 of them, and boarded 181,482. Forces also engaged in a total of 482 firefights, killed 161 VC soldiers, and captured 177 while experiencing 21 friendly deaths and 97 other casualties. 

A study by the BDM Corporation concluded that at the very least the operation forced the VC to drastically alter its logistic operations. The company also stated that at the beginning of 1966 almost 75% of enemy resupply came from the sea along the South Vietnamese coast. By early 1967 this number had been reduced to just 10%.

<doc id="527716" wikidata="Q4273218" url="?curid=527716" title="USS Paulding">
<text>USS &quot;Paulding&quot; (DD-22) was the lead ship of s in the United States Navy. She was named for Rear Admiral Hiram A. Paulding (1797-1878). She was in commission from 1910 to 1919 and saw service in World War I.

After her Navy service, &quot;Paulding&quot; served in the United States Coast Guard as USCGC &quot;Paulding&quot; (CG-17) from 1924 to 1930.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Paulding&quot; was laid down by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath, Maine, on 24 July 1909. She was launched on 12 April 1910, sponsored by Miss Emma Paulding, and commissioned on 29 September 1910, Lieutenant Commander Yates Stirling Jr. in command. She was the first American destroyer solely fueled by fuel oil.

==United States Navy==
Assigned to the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet, &quot;Paulding&quot; operated primarily off the United States East Coast until after the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917. During April 1917, she patrolled off the New England coast and in May 1917 she prepared for distant service. On 21 May 1917, she got underway for the United Kingdom, arriving at Queenstown, Ireland, to escort convoys and protect them from Imperial German Navy U-boats. She served on that duty through the end of the war.

On 24 February 1918, &quot;Paulding&quot; was proceeding in a scouting line with the destroyers and in the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bound for Queenstown when she sighted the British Royal Navy submarine ′s periscope. Mistaking &quot;L2&quot; for a German U-boat, she headed for the periscope at flank speed and opened gunfire. &quot;L2&quot; had sighted the destroyers and, assuming that the destroyers had not seen her periscope, submerged to , but upon hearing &quot;Paulding&quot; open fire, she dove to . &quot;Paulding&quot; dropped two depth charges, the first of which shook &quot;L2&quot; severely and jammed her diving planes in a hard-upward position. This caused &quot;L2&quot; to take on a tremendous inclination, and her stern struck the seabed at a depth of . Four more depth charges exploded, again shaking the submarine. &quot;L2&quot;′s commanding officer gave the order to blow the number 5 and 6 ballast tanks, and &quot;L2&quot; surfaced bow-first. &quot;Davis&quot; dropped a depth charge near her, and then all three destroyers opened gunfire on her from a range of about . One round struck &quot;L2&quot;′s pressure hull just abaft her conning tower. Some of &quot;L2&quot;&#x27;s crew emerged from her conning tower, waved their hands and a White Ensign, and fired a smoke grenade. The destroyers ceased fire immediately. &quot;L-2&quot; did not sustain serious damage, and &quot;Davis&quot; escorted her to Berehaven, Ireland. The force commander of British submarines, Captain Martin Dunbar-Nasmith, commended &quot;L2&quot; and the destroyers for the action in his report on the friendly fire incident. Admiral Lewis Bayly, the Royal Navy′s Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Ireland, in his endorsement of Nasmith′s report, wrote, &quot;Had &quot;L-2&quot; not been very skillfully and coolly handled, she would have been lost. The U. S. destroyers deserve great credit for their smartness in attack, and for their quickness in recognizing the submarine as British.&quot;

&quot;Paulding&quot; returned to the United States after the Armistice with Germany brought World War I to an end on 11 November 1918. She was decommissioned in August 1919 and placed in the Reserve Fleet.

==United States Coast Guard==
The U.S. Navy loaned &quot;Paulding&quot; to the United States Coast Guard from 28 April 1924 to 18 October 1930. As USCGC &quot;Paulding&quot;, she served on the Rum Patrol during Prohibition with her home port at Boston, Massachusetts.

&quot;Paulding&quot; was sent to find the Coast Guard cutter during a gale in February 1927 off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The vessel had already foundered, and &quot;Paulding&quot; spent two days in the storm, losing much topside equipment, including one of her stacks.

On 17 December 1927, &quot;Paulding&quot; accidentally rammed and sank the U.S. Navy submarine while &quot;S-4&quot; was surfacing. &quot;S-4&quot; sank with the loss of all hands. An inquiry absolved the Coast Guard of blame.

==Final disposition==
Returned to the U.S. Navy on 18 October 1930, &quot;Paulding&quot; again joined the Reserve Fleet and was laid up at League Island in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 June 1934 and sold for scrap in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty.

<text>Imperial War Museum North (sometimes referred to as IWM North) is a museum in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester, England. One of five branches of the Imperial War Museum, it explores the impact of modern conflicts on people and society. It is the first branch of the Imperial War Museum to be located in the north of England. The museum occupies a site overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal on Trafford Wharf Road, Trafford Park, an area which during World War II was a key industrial centre and consequently heavily bombed during the Manchester Blitz in 1940. The area is now home to the Lowry cultural centre and the MediaCityUK development, which stand opposite the museum at Salford Quays.

The museum building was designed by architect Daniel Libeskind and opened in July 2002, receiving 470,000 visitors in its first year of opening. It was recognised with awards or prize nominations for its architecture and is a prime example of Deconstructivist architecture. The museum features a permanent exhibition of chronological and thematic displays, supported by hourly audiovisual presentations which are projected throughout the gallery space. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions in a separate gallery. Since opening, the museum has operated a successful volunteer programme, which since January 2007 has been run in partnership with Manchester Museum. As part of a national museum, Imperial War Museum North is financed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and by self-generated income. Admission is free.

During the 1990s, the Imperial War Museum sought to open a branch in the north of England. Seventy-one sites were offered for consideration by 36 local councils. One such council was that of Hartlepool, in County Durham, for whom a new museum building was designed by architect Sir Norman Foster for a site on Hartlepool&#x27;s dockside. In 1992 the Teesside Development Corporation offered the museum, on behalf of Hartlepool council, a total of £14.4 million towards construction and running costs. However, the National Audit Office later reported that the corporation&#x27;s offer breached government rules and negotiations were abandoned.

In January 1999 the then Culture Secretary Chris Smith launched a project to construct the new museum in Trafford, Greater Manchester. The Trafford Park area has strong associations with the Second World War on the British home front; factories in the area produced Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, and Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines used by a number of Royal Air Force combat aircraft. By 1945 the area employed 75,000 people. The area was consequently heavily bombed, particularly during the Manchester Blitz, when 684 people were killed in raids over two nights in December 1940. By the time of Chris Smith&#x27;s announcement, the museum had already received outline planning permission (in October 1997), with full approval in April 1999.

===Architecture===

An architectural competition for the new museum was held in 1997, with the winning design being that of Berlin-based architect Daniel Libeskind. Born in Łódź, Poland, in 1946, Libeskind&#x27;s family had suffered during World War II and dozens of his relatives were murdered in The Holocaust. It was his first building in the United Kingdom. At the museum&#x27;s opening, Libeskind said that he sought to &quot;create a building ... which emotionally moved the soul of the visitor toward a sometimes unexpected realization&quot;&#x27;. Libeskind envisaged a&quot; &#x27;constellation composed of three interlocking shards&#x27; &quot; with each shard being a remnant of an imagined globe shattered by conflict. These shards in turn represented air, earth and water, and each formed a functionally distinct part of the museum. The 55 m high air shard, provides the museum&#x27;s entranceway and a viewing balcony (now closed to the public) above the Manchester Ship Canal with views of the Manchester skyline. The construction of the tower leaves viewers exposed to the elements and one reviewer considered that it reflected &quot;the aerial perspective of modern warfare and the precariousness of the life below&quot;. The earth shard houses the museum&#x27;s exhibition spaces, while the water shard accommodates a cafe with views of the canal.

Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated National Lottery funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies. The European Union&#x27;s European Regional Development Fund contributed £8.9 million, English Partnerships and the Northwest Regional Development Agency £2.7 million, and £2.8 million was provided by Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council. The Peel Group, a local transport and property company, contributed £12.5 million; this was reportedly the largest single sum ever given to a UK cultural project by a private enterprise. The reduction in budget forced a number of changes; the substitution of metal for concrete in the construction of the shards, the removal of a planned auditorium, and a change of exhibition content. The site&#x27;s external landscaping also had to be reduced; in 2009, following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions, Berlin-based company Topotek 1 were appointed to complete this landscaping. Despite these economies, the fundamental &quot;shattered globe&quot; concept remained intact. A final £3 million was raised by a fundraising campaign led by BBC News war correspondent Kate Adie. Construction of the museum, by structural engineers Arup and main contractor Sir Robert McAlpine, began on 5 January 2000 and the building was topped out in late September that year. Exhibition fitting started in November 2001, and the museum opened to the public on 5 July 2002, shortly before the 2002 Commonwealth Games which were hosted in Manchester that year.

==Exhibitions==
Permanent exhibitions are housed in the museum&#x27;s first-floor main gallery space within the earth shard. These consist of a chronological display which runs around the gallery&#x27;s perimeter and six thematic displays in &quot;silos&quot; within the space. As part of the earth shard, the 3,500 m2 floor of the gallery is curved, gradually dropping away like the curvature of the Earth from a nominal &quot;North Pole&quot; near the gallery&#x27;s entrance. Within this hall, described as cavernous and dramatic, a number of large artefacts are displayed; they include a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8A Harrier jet and a 13-pounder field gun which fired the British Army&#x27;s first shot of World War I. Around the gallery, a number of vertical mechanical conveyors called &quot;timestacks&quot; display selections of smaller artefacts, some of which can be handled by visitors. Libeskind&#x27;s subsequent work on the masterplan for renewal the World Trade Centre site is echoed in the exhibit of a 7 m (23 ft) section of twisted steel from that building.

The museum also displays artworks by official war artists who were commissioned to create a visual record of Britain during the world wars, among them &quot;Building Flying-Boats&quot; by Flora Lion; &quot;The &#x27;L&#x27; Press. Forging the Jacket of an 18-inch Gun&quot; by Anna Airy; and &quot;Going to Work&quot; by L. S. Lowry (1943).

In addition to the physical exhibits, the walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of hourly audiovisual presentations called the Big Picture, which explore themes related to modern conflict. These presentations use up to 1,500 images from the Imperial War Museum&#x27;s photograph archive and were originally projected from 60 synchronised slide projectors mounted throughout the space. In 2011 digital projectors were installed, allowing a greater degree of flexibility. The images are complemented by personal accounts from the museum&#x27;s oral history sound archive. The Big Picture was devised after the reduction in the museum&#x27;s budget forced the scrapping of the previous exhibition plan by designers DEGW and Amalgam. With some seeing one of the museum&#x27;s shortcomings as a lack of artefacts, the projections and the building itself are now the main attractions.

Also within the earth shard, a separate gallery accommodates a programme of temporary exhibitions. These have included the &quot;Witness&quot; series of art exhibitions from the museum&#x27;s collection, examining First and Second World War art, and the work of female war artists.

The WaterWay, a passageway linking the earth and water shards, is used for smaller art or photographic exhibitions, such as Ghislaine Howard&#x27;s photojournalism-inspired painting series &quot;365&quot;.

Outside the museum building, an ex-Iraqi Ground Forces T-55 tank was put on display at the main entrance in August 2008. This vehicle was captured by the Royal Engineers during the opening stages of the Iraq War in 2003. The spot had previously been occupied by an Iraqi ZSU-23-4 Shilka anti-aircraft gun. Captured by the Royal Artillery after the 1991 Gulf War, it was moved from Imperial War Museum Duxford and displayed to mark the museum&#x27;s fifth anniversary in July 2007.

==Reception==
The museum enjoyed a successful first year, with an initial target of 300,000 visitors surpassed after six months, with over 100,000 visitors in the first six weeks; by the museum&#x27;s first anniversary on 5 July 2003 some 470,000 visitors had been received. The museum won the Building Award in the 2003 British Construction Industry Awards, and was shortlisted for the 2004 Stirling Prize. The museum received a largely positive critical reception, with reviewers remarking on the metaphorical power of the building, the complementary effects of the museum&#x27;s main exhibition with its internal architecture, and the economy with which the museum was built. In August 2005 Imperial War Museum North received its millionth visitor. The museum was, however, criticised in 2008 by &quot;The Guardian&quot; for poor energy efficiency, as part of a report into the carbon dioxide emissions of UK public buildings.

==Volunteer programme==
Supporting Imperial War Museum North&#x27;s educational goals, the museum has operated a volunteer programme since opening in 2002. The programme seeks to engage local people at risk of social exclusion. Originally based on a National Vocational Qualification, the programme was revised and relaunched in 2004, and consisted of a basic cultural heritage course, providing opportunities to develop academic skills and improve confidence, and to support individuals seeking to return to employment. In return volunteers work in the museum&#x27;s public spaces as part of the front of house teams. In January 2007 the museum launched the in Touch volunteer programme, in partnership with Manchester Museum and supported by £425,000 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund. The programme was recognised by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport as a case study of its kind, in the department&#x27;s &quot;Third Sector Strategy&quot;.

<text>The Rum Patrol was an operation of the United States Coast Guard to interdict liquor smuggling vessels, known as &quot;rum runners&quot; in order to enforce prohibition in American waters. On 18 December 1917, the 18th Amendment to the Constitution was submitted to the states by Congress. On 16 January 1919, the amendment was ratified and the Liquor Prohibition Amendment, which prohibited the manufacture, sale, transportation, importation, or exportation of intoxicating liquors, came into effect on 16 January 1920.

==History==
===Origin===
The establishment of prohibition gave rise to smuggling of illicit liquor into the United States overland from Canada and from ships moored just outside the three-mile limit along the Atlantic seaboard. By 1921, &quot;Rum Row&quot; existed off New York City and the New Jersey shore as well as near Boston, and the Chesapeake and Delaware bays. The Florida coast and New Orleans were also points of entry used by rum runners. Smaller boats were used to transfer the cargos from the mother ships on Rum Row under cover of darkness to the shore. In February 1922, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Rear Admiral William E. Reynolds, informed the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Roy Asa Haynes that although the Coast Guard was tasked with the enforcement of prohibition, Congress had not included any funding for the additional maintenance and operation of vessels. Since there was no funding, enforcement by Coast Guard vessels was in connection with other enforcement duties. The first important seizure was the British-registered schooner &quot;Henry L. Marshall&quot; by in 1921.

===Funding problems===
Since the Coast Guard was tasked with prohibiting the importation of liquor through U.S. waters and it didn&#x27;t have the resources to do so, Commandant Reynolds submitted a plan to Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon that called for 20 new cutters, 200 coastal patrol cutters and 90 fast picket boats. He also asked for 20 million dollars to fund new construction and an additional 3,500 personnel to man the new vessels.

===Congress acts===
To deal with this problem, twenty-five destroyers were transferred by the United States Navy to the Treasury Department for service with the Coast Guard. Some began to show signs of wear and tear after the often arduous pace of operations on the Rum Patrol and required replacement. Accordingly, six of the newer flush deck destroyers were transferred to the Treasury Department in 1930–1932.

It was thought that adapting these older vessels for Coast Guard service would be less costly than building new ships. In the end, however, the rehabilitation of the vessels was costly because of the exceedingly poor condition of many of these war-weary ships. In many instances, it took nearly a year to bring the vessels up to seaworthiness. Additionally, these were by far the largest and most sophisticated vessels ever operated by the service, and trained personnel were nearly nonexistent. As a result, Congress authorized hundreds of new enlistees. These inexperienced men generally made up the destroyer crews.

Some of the destroyers were pre-World War I 742-ton &quot;flivvers&quot;, capable of over – an advantage in the rum-chasing business. They were, however, easily outmaneuvered by smaller vessels. The destroyers’ mission, therefore, was to picket the larger mother ships and prevent them from off-loading their cargo onto the smaller, speedier contact boats that ran the liquor into shore.

On 20 February 1933, the 21st Amendment to the Constitution, the repeal of Amendment 18, was proposed by Congress and ratification was completed on 5 December 1933. This eliminated prohibition, and therefore the need for the Rum Patrol. The remaining destroyers were returned to the Navy and sold for scrap.

<doc id="527725" wikidata="Q541080" url="?curid=527725" title="Lithopedion">
<text>A lithopedion (also spelled lithopaedion or lithopædion; from &quot;stone&quot; and &quot;small child, infant&quot;), or stone baby, is a rare phenomenon which occurs most commonly when a fetus dies during an abdominal pregnancy, is too large to be reabsorbed by the body, and calcifies on the outside as part of a foreign body reaction, shielding the mother&#x27;s body from the dead tissue of the fetus and preventing infection.

Lithopedia may occur from 14 weeks gestation to full term. It is not unusual for a stone baby to remain undiagnosed for decades and to be found well after natural menopause; diagnosis often happens when the patient is examined for other conditions that require being subjected to an X-ray study. A review of 128 cases by T.S.P. Tien found that the mean age at diagnosis of women with lithopedia was 55 years, with the oldest being 100 years old. The lithopedion was carried for an average of 22 years, and in several cases, the women became pregnant a second time and gave birth to children without incident. Nine of the reviewed cases had carried lithopedia for over 50 years before diagnosis.

According to one report, there are only 300 known cases of lithopedia recorded over 400 years of medical literature. While the chance of abdominal pregnancy is one in 11,000 pregnancies, only between 1.5 and 1.8 percent of these abdominal pregnancies may develop into lithopedia.

==Research history==

Lithopedion was first described in a treatise by the Spanish Muslim physician Abū al-Qāsim (Abulcasis) in the 10th century. By the mid-18th century, a number of cases had been documented in humans, sheep and hares in France and Germany. In a speech before the French Académie Royale des Sciences in 1748, surgeon Sauveur François Morand used lithopedia both as evidence of the common nature of fetal development in viviparous and oviparous animals, and as an argument in favor of caesarean section.

In 1880, German physician Friedrich Küchenmeister reviewed 47 cases of lithopedia from the medical literature and distinguished three subgroups: &quot;Lithokelyphos&quot; (&quot;Stone Sheath&quot;), where calcification occurs on the placental membrane and not the fetus; &quot;Lithotecnon&quot; (&quot;Stone Child&quot;) or &quot;true&quot; lithopedion, where the fetus itself is calcified after entering the abdominal cavity, following the rupture of the placental and ovarian membranes; and &quot;Lithokelyphopedion&quot; (&quot;Stone Sheath [and] Child&quot;), where both fetus and sac are calcified. Lithopedia can originate both as tubal and ovarian pregnancies, although tubal pregnancy cases are more common.

<text>HiTech, also referred to as Hitech, is a chess machine built at Carnegie Mellon University under the direction of World Correspondence Chess Champion Hans J. Berliner. Members of the team working on HiTech included Berliner, Murray Campbell, Carl Ebeling, Gordon Goetsch, Andy Palay, and Larry Slomer. In 1988, it became the first computer system to beat a grandmaster.

==History==
===Development and specs===
It was designed by Carl Ebeling, a student, from 1986 to 1988, under professor Hans Berliner at Carnegie Mellon University. Members of the team working on HiTech included Berliner, Murray Campbell, Carl Ebeling, Gordon Goetsch, Andy Palay, and Larry Slomer.

Berliner had also created a computer program to play backgammon called BKG 9.8, which beat Luigi Villa in 1979, and in the process became &quot;the first computer program to beat a world champion in any game.&quot; According to the &quot;New York Times,&quot; &quot;this research led, in 1984, to a chess program called HiTech.&quot; The computer used an algorithm developed by Berliner to narrow the choices when selecting a move, called B*, or B-star. The algorithm would evaluate decision trees and assign nodes with an &quot;optimistic&quot; or &quot;pessimistic&quot; score, with the aim of finding a path that was sufficient to solve the problem, rather than perfect.

HiTech&#x27;s name refers to a chess-playing program called TECH that was developed at Carnegie Mellon. The team combined a Sun computer equipped with a custom processor called &quot;the searcher&quot; by Berlin. It runs three programs: a user interface, a task controller, and an &quot;oracle,&quot; with the latter consisting of a large catalogue of chess openings and variations. The searcher component contains a microprocessor and a number of hardware modules to perform tasks such as generating and evaluating moves. These activities are coordinated by the microprocessor. The move generator consisted of 64 VLSI chips, with one for each square on the chessboard. In 1988, Hitech could scan 165,000 positions a second.

The hardware, which was custom, could analyze over 200,000 moves per second. The computer has a nearly six-foot-tall mainframe. HiTech was one of two competing chess projects at Carnegie Mellon; the other was ChipTest. ChipTest became the predecessor of IBM&#x27;s Deep Thought and Deep Blue).

===Early matches===
HiTech won the 1985 and 1989 editions of the North American Computer Chess Championship. From September 1985 to July 1988, it used the same hardware, while its standing in the US chess community rose from being in the top 2% to the top .5%. Berliner described this change as a result of &quot;using better management of the resources that have been available.&quot; In November 1985, the Associated Press reported that over five months of play, it had earned the rank of master and achieved the highest rating ever given a chess machine. At that time, its developers argued it was 50% faster than any other chess-playing computer systems. The computer began competing on the chess circuit, only going against humans, in 1986. By 1987, the computer ranked 190th in the United States, and was the only computer among the top 1,000 chess players.

ChipTest was invited to play in the 1987 American Open, but the team did not enter due to an objection by the HiTech team, also from Carnegie Mellon University. HiTech and ChipTest shared some code, and Hitech was already playing in the tournament. The two teams became rivals.

HiTech was the first computer to be rated over 2400 in chess, which is the senior master USCF rating level.

===Championships===
In 1987, it won the Pennsylvania State Chess Championship, scoring 4.5 points out of 5 after a four-way tie. HiTech had an overall performance score of 2559, considered a high Senior Master rating. However, an interpretation of the rules denied HiTech the money prize, the State Title, and trophy, as only a resident could earn the title. Hitech won the Pennsylvania State Chess Championship twice, winning again in July 1988. It won with a score of 4.5 - 0.5, beating international master Edward Formanek in the process. Rules had changed since 1987, allowing a computer to win the title, but not the trophy or prize money. However, Professor Formanek gave Hitech the trophy he had been awarded as the highest human competitor.

In May 1988, Hitech was described by &quot;TIME&quot; as being able to compete in hotel competitions remotely. The main computer remained at Pittsburgh, while a contraption &quot;TIME&quot; called &quot;an ungainly-looking brute,&quot; would be operated by Berliner and Carl Ebeling at the tournament. The remote Hitech relied on its phone line connection to Pittsburg to communicate moves. This meant that whenever the hotel would use their phone line, the computer would need to be relinked via a phone call.

In 1988 HiTech defeated GM Arnold Denker 3½-½ in a match in New York City. Hitech won the four-game match, the first a draw and the last three wins, marking the first time a grandmaster was beaten by a chess program. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot; at the time, most experts agreed Denker, however, was &quot;badly off form,&quot; as a largely retired individual at 74 years old. Denker called Hitech&#x27;s play an impressive achievement.

===Retirement===

In 1988, Berliner stated that he and his associates at Carnegie-Mellon were working on an improved model of Hitech, with three years of work projected before it debuted. At the time, Hitech could scan 165,000 positions a second. Berliner stated that &quot;speed alone is not the most important thing. Hitech scans in a dumb sort of way. It has to go through every possible position. A smarter machine might operate only on 100,000 scans a second, but it will confine those scans to positions germane to the situation. That is what we call a smart scan.&quot;

HiTech has been included in exhibits by the Computer History Museum. The Carnegie Mellon University Libraries began holding the computer in 2022, as part of the university&#x27;s Robotics Project. It was donated from the collection of Chris Atkeson.
