<text>Mr. Squiggle (originally also known as Mr. Squiggle and Friends) is an Australian children&#x27;s television series, and the name of the title character from that ABC show. The show was presented on television in many formats, between its inception on 1 July 1959 and 1999, from five-minute slots to a one-and-a-half-hour variety show featuring other performers, and has had several name changes, originally airing as &quot;Mr. Squiggle and Friends&quot;. At its height, the program was one of the most popular children&#x27;s programs in Australia and toured theatre and conventions, entertaining several generations who grew with the program. It became one of the longest-running children&#x27;s programs on Australian television, despite originally only asked to fill a six week gap on the ABC&#x27;s schedule.

==History==
&quot;Mr. Squiggle&quot;, the central character was created by cartoonist and puppeteer Norman Hetherington OAM, and the character first appeared on the &quot;Children&#x27;s TV Club&quot; on ABC TV, but was spun off into his own programme which first aired on 1 July 1959. Hetherington voiced and operated all of the show&#x27;s puppets, while his wife Margaret wrote the scripts.

The basic premise of the show remained the same: children wrote in with their &quot;squiggles&quot; and Mr. Squiggle would turn them into recognisable drawings by connecting lines with his pencil nose. More often than not, the picture would be drawn upside down (Hetherington manipulated the puppet from above by viewing the drawing upside down), and then Mr. Squiggle would gleefully declare, &quot;Upside down! Upside down!&quot;—asking his assistant to turn the picture the right way up and reveal the completed drawing. Every child whose &quot;squiggle&quot; was used on the show was sent a letter from Mr Squiggle himself. According to one interview, one little girl even sent Hetherington three handkerchiefs for Christmas.
The last episode went to air just over 40 years after the first, on 9 July 1999. The last episode was produced in 1997; however, it was not until 2001 that the contract with the ABC concluded. After the show ceased production, the entire cast of puppets from &quot;Mister Squiggle and Friends&quot; were owned by the show&#x27;s creator, Norman Hetherington. They have been loaned for display at exhibitions, such as at the National Film and Sound Archive and as part of the &quot;50 Years of TV&quot; exhibition at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in 2007. Hetherington and his puppets appeared on the ABC TV series &quot;Collectors&quot; in 2010. In 2005 the Mosman Art Gallery hosted a major exhibition on the art and life of Norman Hetherington called &quot;Mr Squiggle, Who’s Pulling the Strings&quot;. It included an envelope that a child had addressed to &quot;Mr Squiggle, The Moon&quot;, which was delivered to the show.

==Characters==
* Mr. Squiggle - Mr. Squiggle, the central character is a marionette with a pencil for a nose, who visits his friends from his home at 93 Crater Crescent on the Moon, flying to Earth in his pet rocket (named Rocket). In every episode he would create several pictures from &quot;squiggles&quot; sent in by children from around the country. Mr. Squiggle is a cheery, gentle and good-natured yet scatter-brained character who is often distracted and occasionally goes for &quot;space-walks&quot;, leading his assistant to calm him down and get him to focus on the task of drawing.

===Other characters===
Other puppet characters that appeared in the show included:
* Blackboard, the grumpy blackboard that Mr. Squiggle uses for an easel, whose catchphrases are &quot;Hurry up&quot;, &quot;Hmmph&quot;, &quot;Double hmmph&quot; and “Boringgg&quot;
* Gus the Snail, who had a TV for a shell and later, a flower pot, often tells knock-knock jokes.
* Bill the Steam Shovel, who likes to tell corny jokes (often in the form of riddles) and belch steam (talcum powder) out of his &quot;nose&quot; when he laughs.

===Assistants===
Mr. Squiggle was helped by a human assistant in all of the show&#x27;s incarnations; they included Miss Gina (Gina Curtis), Miss Pat (Pat Lovell), Miss Jane (Jane Fennell), and later series featured Roxanne (Roxanne Kimmorley) and Rebecca (Rebecca Hetherington, Hetherington&#x27;s daughter). In his first incarnation as Mr. Jolly Squiggle on the &quot;Children&#x27;s TV Club&quot; his assistant was Miss Faith (Faith Linton).

===Guest cast===
Comedian Mikey Robins played one of the show&#x27;s characters, Reg Linchpin, for a year from 1989 to 1990. Other notable guest performers on the show included actor Paul Chubb and magician Timothy Hyde.

==Commemorated==
In February 2019 the Royal Australian Mint released a series of two dollar coins to mark the 60th anniversary of the first broadcast of the programme. The coins feature images of Squiggle himself, Gus the Snail, Bill the Steam Shovel, and Blackboard.

==Historical collection==
In April 2024, the National Museum of Australia announced that it had acquired a collection of Norman Hetherington&#x27;s puppets, scripts, artworks, props, graphics, merchandise, and fans&#x27; &quot;squiggles&quot;, with the intention of eventually putting them on display.

<text>A horse-drawn boat or tow-boat is a historic boat operating on a canal, pulled by a horse walking beside the canal on a towpath.

==United Kingdom==
The Romans are known to have used mules to haul boats on their waterways in the UK. Boat horses were the prime movers of the Industrial Revolution, and they remained at work until the middle of the 20th century. A horse, towing a boat with a rope from the towpath, could pull fifty times as much cargo as it could pull in a cart or wagon on roads. In the early days of the Canal Age, from about 1740, all boats and barges were towed by horse, mule, hinny, pony or sometimes a pair of donkeys. Many of the surviving buildings and structures had been designed with horse power in mind. Horse-drawn boats were used well into the 1960s on UK canals for commercial transport, and are still used today by passenger trip boats and other pleasure traffic.

The Horseboating Society has the primary aims of preserving and promoting Horseboating on the canals of the United Kingdom. There are horseboat operators at Foxton, Godalming, Tiverton, Ashton-under-Lyne, Newbury, Llangollen and Maesbury Marsh, Shropshire on the Montgomery Canal.

===NB &quot;Maria&quot;===

&quot;Maria&quot; is Britain&#x27;s oldest surviving wooden narrowboat, built in 1854 by Jinks Boatyard in Marple, and was never converted to have an engine. From 1854 to 1897, &quot;Maria&quot; was used to carry railway track ballast for the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. It was then used as a maintenance boat until 1962, lay abandoned for nine years until being salvaged in 1972 and converted to a passenger boat in 1978. In 2000 it was restored to near original operating condition.

&quot;Maria&quot; is currently owned by Ashton Packet Boat Company. It is sometimes loaned to the Horseboating Society and has taken part in several of their events, including British Waterways&#x27; &quot;Coal and Cotton&quot; event, celebrating the Leeds and Liverpool Canal&#x27;s history of transporting coal from Leeds and Wigan to Liverpool, and taking cotton from Liverpool docks to Leeds.

In 2006 it was the first boat to have been legged through Standedge Tunnel in 60 years. A UK Government minister and a local Member of Parliament took turns at legging &quot;Maria&quot; through the highest, longest, and deepest canal tunnel in the UK.

<text>Brian Timothy Finn (born 25 June 1952) is a New Zealand singer, songwriter, musician, and composer. He is best known as a founding member of Split Enz. Finn founded the band in 1972 with Phil Judd and served as lead singer and principal songwriter. Following Judd&#x27;s departure in 1977, he was joined by brother Neil. Finn wrote or co-wrote some of the band&#x27;s best-known songs, including &quot;I See Red&quot; and &quot;Six Months in a Leaky Boat&quot;. While still a member of Split Enz, he began a solo career, scoring the two hits &quot;Fraction Too Much Friction&quot; and &quot;Made My Day&quot; in 1983; he left the band in early 1984, briefly returning for their farewell tour later that year.

He reunited with Neil and subsequently joined Crowded House for their third album &quot;Woodface&quot;, co-writing the majority of the songs on the album, including the hits &quot;Four Seasons in One Day&quot;, &quot;Weather with You&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Only Natural&quot;. Leaving the band after the album&#x27;s release, he reunited with Neil again later in the 1990s under the name Finn Brothers. Finn has participated in various collaborations with other artists, including former Split Enz members, and has also composed scores for films and musicals.

Along with his brother, Finn was appointed Officer of the Order of British Empire in 1993 for his services to music.

== Early life and education ==
Brian Timothy Finn was born on 25 June 1952 in Te Awamutu, New Zealand, weighing 10 pounds at birth, to parents Richard and Mary. He has two sisters, and one younger brother, Neil Finn.

At the age of 13, he went to Sacred Heart College, Auckland, a Catholic boarding school, on a scholarship.

==Career==
===1972–1984: Split Enz===

In 1971 Finn commenced a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Auckland. There he played in music practice room 129 (later the name of a Split Enz song) with friends and future Split Enz bandmembers Mike Chunn, Robert Gillies, Philip Judd and Noel Crombie. Music soon became more important to him than his studies. In 1972 he quit university. A few months later, Phil and Tim formed the group Split Ends, renamed Split Enz in 1975, shortly before they left New Zealand for Melbourne. Between 1975 and 1984, the group released nine studio albums. Split Enz played its last show on 4 December 1984 in Auckland.

===1981–present: Solo work===
Finn had his first success away from Split Enz in 1981 when his discarded demo &quot;They Won&#x27;t Let My Girlfriend Talk to Me&quot; became a top 10 hit for Australian band Jimmy and the Boys. In 1983, Finn recorded his debut solo album, &quot;Escapade&quot;, while still a member of Split Enz. This met with major commercial success both in Australia and New Zealand, and yielded hit song &quot;Fraction Too Much Friction&quot;, which revealed a more rhythm-based sound than Split Enz had been known for. After contributing four songs to Split Enz album &quot;Conflicting Emotions&quot;, Finn left the band permanently in June 1984, to focus on a solo career.

In 1986 Finn released his second studio album, &quot;Big Canoe&quot;. The album utilised a wide variety of instrumentation, including guitars, orchestral backings and traditional Indian instruments - most notably on single &quot;No Thunder, No Fire, No Rain&quot;, which was inspired by the Bhopal chemical disaster. Though &quot;Big Canoe&quot; reached number three on the New Zealand charts, it failed to become the international breakthrough that Finn or record company Virgin had hoped.

In 1987, Finn composed music for the Australian comedy &quot;Les Patterson Saves the World&quot;, which yielded the Australian hit &quot;You Saved the World&quot;. Finn had a small part in Australian film &quot;The Coca-Cola Kid&quot; alongside then-girlfriend Greta Scacchi, and a larger one in her Italian-shot romance &quot;La Donna della Luna&quot; (The Moon Woman).

In late 1988, Finn recording his eponymous third album for Capitol Records. The album yielded strong reviews and the New Zealand hit &quot;Parihaka&quot;, based on a Māori village known for its campaign of passive resistance to European occupiers. Finn also created the song &quot;Cane Toad Blues&quot; which played during the credits for the documentary film &quot;Cane Toads: An Unnatural History.&quot;

In 2000, the album &quot;Together in Concert: Live&quot; was released, featuring Finn, and fellow New Zealand singer/songwriters Bic Runga, and Dave Dobbyn. Recorded in August and September 2000 in venues around New Zealand, the album saw the three performers each equitably showcased. Both the concerts and album feature all three performers providing vocal and instrumental backing on each other&#x27;s songs. The album peaked at number 2 on the New Zealand chart.

In 2015, Finn composed further for theatre, with an opera &quot;Star Navigator&quot; commissioned by New Zealand Opera, Victorian Opera and West Australian Opera, and the musical &quot;Ladies in Black&quot; to premiere in Brisbane by Queensland Theatre Company in November 2015.

As England and New Zealand went into COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, Finn and Phil Manzanera began working collaboratively on an album &quot;Caught by the Heart&quot;. The album was released on 26 August 2021. The album is produced by the two of them, with Manzanera doing the lead instrumental and Finn doing the vocals.

===1995–2005 : Finn Brothers===

In 1989, Finn began playing music with younger brother Neil, for an intended Finn brothers record. After working together on some songs, Neil later proposed incorporating the tracks onto the latest album of Crowded House, the group Neil had formed after Split Enz dissolved. Eight of their songs featured on the resulting Crowded House album &quot;Woodface&quot;, including the hits &quot;Weather with You&quot; and &quot;Four Seasons in One Day&quot;.

In the 1993 Birthday Honours, both Tim and Neil were appointed Officers of the Order of British Empire, for their services to music.

The Finn Brothers resumed their collaborative work and released &quot;Finn&quot; in 1995. A second and final album was released in 2004 titled, &quot;Everyone Is Here&quot;. A &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine review stated that it contained &quot;some of the most haunting music to bear the Finn imprint&quot;.

=== 2020–present: Forenzics ===
In 2020 Finn co-created Forenzics with former Split Enz keyboardist Eddie Rayner. Forenzics is an experimental project with the debut album &quot;Shades and Echoes&quot; (2022) as a transformation of the songs of &quot;Mental Notes&quot;. Alongside Finn and Rayner are Noel Crombie and Phil Judd, who were in Split Enz during the recording of the original album - and also Phil Manzanera who was involved in the redevelopment of &quot;Mental Notes&quot; into &quot;Second Thoughts&quot;. Initial singles &quot;Chances Are&quot; and &quot;Premiere Fois&quot; were officially released in November 2021, however &quot;Walking&quot;, &quot;Strange Stars&quot; and &quot;Abandoned&quot; were all released before on YouTube (from early 2020 until early 2021).

In 2022, Tim Finn involved himself in the Waiata / Anthems project producing a Māori language cover of the track &quot;Six Months in a Leaky Boat&quot; (as &quot;Ono Marama Takerehāia&quot;).

==Personal life==
Finn was briefly married to English dancer Liz Malam from 1981–1982. He was in a relationship with actress Greta Scacchi from 1984–1989. Since 1997 he has been married to television presenter Marie Azcona, formerly of MTV and TVNZ One&#x27;s &quot;Music Week&quot;. Finn and Azcona have two children, and have collaborated on several songs, some of which are featured on &quot;Steel City&quot;, the dance show that Finn wrote. Aside from co-writing two tracks with Azcona, Finn collaborated on another with former Split Enz member Mike Chunn. Finn&#x27;s son Harper and daughter Elliot are musicians in their own right.

<text>Paul Henreid (January 10, 1908 – March 29, 1992) was an Austrian-American actor, director, producer, and writer. He is best remembered for several film roles during the Second World War, including Capt. Karl Marsen in &quot;Night Train to Munich&quot; (1940), Victor Laszlo in &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942) and Jerry Durrance in &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942).

==Early life==
Paul Henreid was born on January 10, 1908, as Paul Georg Julius von Hernreid in Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was the son of Maria-Luise (Lendecke) and Karl Alphons Hernreid, a financial adviser to Emperor Franz Joseph I. Born as Carl Hirsch, Karl von Hernreid converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1904 due to anti-semitism in Austria-Hungary.

Paul von Henreid trained for the theatre in Vienna, over his family&#x27;s objections, attending the Theresianische Akademie. During this time, he worked at a publishing house while attending school. Karl died in 1916. The family fortune had dwindled by the time his son graduated from the Akademie.

==Stage and film careers==

=== Roles in Germany and Austria ===
While performing in a play at the Akademie, von Henreid was discovered by Otto Preminger, then working for the director Max Reinhardt. Von Henreid then joined Reinhardt&#x27;s theater company. In 1933, he played a minor role in a stage production of &quot;Faust&quot;. He had starring roles in the Vienna staging of the 1934 play &quot;Men in White&quot; and the play &quot;Mizzi&quot;.

With the onset of the National Socialist regime in Germany in 1933, the NS-Reichsfilmkammer (National Sozialistic Reich Film Chamber) controlled the making of German films. He applied for membership, but was rejected because his father had been born a Jew. In 1935, von Henreid was cast in the Austrian film &quot;Jersey Lilly&quot;. Von Henreid went to London in 1937 to portray Prince Albert in the first British stage production of &quot;Victoria Regina&quot;. That same year, he applied again for a membership by a special permit with the NS-Reichsfilmkammer. This request was personally rejected by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels.

By the time Germany took over Austria in 1938, von Henreid had become fervently anti-Nazi. During this period, he helped a Jewish comedian flee Germany. As a result of this and other actions, the German Government designated him an &quot;official enemy of the Third Reich&quot; and confiscated all his assets in Germany. Von Henreid soon moved permanently to the United Kingdom.

===Roles in the United Kingdom===
With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, von Henreid risked deportation from the United Kingdom or internment as an enemy alien. However, the German actor Conrad Veidt vouched for him, and the British Government allowed him to stay and work. Veidt later appeared alongside Henreid as Major Heinrich Strasser in the film &quot;Casablanca.&quot;

In 1939, von Henreid had a major supporting role as German teacher Max Staefel in &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips.&quot; The following year, he received third billing as a German Gestapo agent in the thriller &quot;Night Train to Munich&quot;. In 1940, Von Henreid also performed in a minor role in the British musical comedy &quot;Under Your Hat&quot;. That same year, he portrayed a German army officer in the film &quot;Madman of Europe&quot;.

===Roles for RKO, Warner Bros., and MGM===
In 1940, von Henreid relocated to New York City. He played a doctor in the 1941 Broadway play, &quot;Flight to the West.&quot; That same year, he signed a contract with the RKO Pictures in Hollywood. RKO dropped the &quot;von&quot; from his name to make it sound less Germanic. He also became a citizen of the United States. Henreid&#x27;s first film for RKO was &quot;Joan of Paris&quot;, a 1942 war drama in which he played a Royal Air Force pilot trying to escape Occupied France. The film was a big hit.

Moving to Warner Brothers in 1942, the studio cast Henreid as Jeremiah Durrance in the romance &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;, playing opposite Bette Davis. His role was that of a married man who meets the &quot;spinster&quot; Davis on an ocean voyage. His next role was as Victor Laszlo, an anti-Nazi resistance leader in the 1942 romantic drama &quot;Casablanca.&quot; The cast included Claude Rains, Humphrey Bogart, and Ingrid Bergman, who plays Laszlo&#x27;s wife. The film was a critical success and is considered today one of the best American films in history.

After &quot;Casablanca&quot;, Henreid turned down the male lead alongside Davis in the 1943 dramatic film, &quot;Watch on the Rhine.&quot; Warner Brothers then paired Henreid with Ida Lupino in the 1944 romantic drama, &quot;In Our Time.&quot; That same year, the studio cast him as a romantic lead with Eleanor Parker in &quot;Between Two Worlds.&quot; Also in 1944, Henreid played a lead role in &quot;The Conspirators&quot;, about a Dutch resistance leader trying to escape Nazi agents in Lisbon. The film&#x27;s supporting cast included Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. Henreid rejected another romantic lead with Davis in the 1944 film &quot;Mr Skeffington&quot;.

Henreid briefly rejoined RKO to play a pirate with Maureen O&#x27;Hara in the studio&#x27;s 1945 release, &quot;The Spanish Main&quot;. Returning to Warner Bros., he was cast in 1946 in &quot;Devotion&quot;, a biopic of the Brontë family in which Henreid portrays Charlotte Bronte&#x27;s husband, Arthur Bell Nicholls. He was cast again with Parker in the 1946 adaptation of the Somerset Maugham novel, &quot;Of Human Bondage.&quot; He played Philip Carey, a medical student with a clubfoot.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) then borrowed Henreid from Warners to play the composer Robert Schumann in the 1957 film &quot;Song of Love,&quot; opposite Katharine Hepburn. In his 1984 autobiography &quot;Ladies Man,&quot; Henreid stated that he then bought out his Warner Brothers contract for $75,000. MGM offered him a long-term contract for $150,000 a year, but he turned it down.

===Blacklisting and independent films===
Henreid recounted that in the late 1940s, he participated in a protest by some Hollywood actors in Washington, D.C. against the anti-Communist excesses of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. As a result, he said the major studios in Hollywood blacklisted him from any roles. He produced the film noir &quot;Hollow Triumph&quot; in 1948.

For the next several years, Henreid was only able to gain roles in independent films with lower budgets. He appeared in the 1949 adventure film &quot;Rope of Sand,&quot; playing a villain opposite Burt Lancaster&quot;.&quot; In 1950, Henreid made a low-budget film for Edward and Harry Danziger, &quot;So Young, So Bad&quot;, as a school psychiatrist. This film was followed by an offer from producer Sam Katzman to play the pirate Jean Lafitte in &quot;Last of the Buccaneers&quot; (1950). Henreid then went to France for the 1951 romance film &quot;Pardon My French&quot;. He then returned to Katzman for the 1952 film &quot;Thief of Damascus.&quot; He directed and played the lead role in &quot;For Men Only&quot; (1952), a college drama about hazing. Later, in the United Kingdom, he made the films &quot;Stolen Face&quot; (1952) and &quot;Mantrap&quot; (1953). He then went back to Katzman for the 1953 fantasy adventure &quot;Siren of Bagdad&quot;, playing a magician.

=== Return to Hollywood ===
In 1954, Henreid returned to MGM for his first film for a major studio since being blacklisted. He played a minor role in &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot;, a biopic about the composer Sigmund Romberg. He next moved to Columbia Pictures, where he appeared as a pirate captain in the 1955 film &quot;Pirates of Tripoli&quot; . He made a cameo appearance in the 1956 comedy &quot;Meet Me in Las Vegas&quot;. He also appeared at this time on Broadway in the play &quot;Festival&quot;.
In the early 1950s, Henreid began directing both films and television shows. His directorial credits include American television episodes of:

* &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; 
* &quot;Maverick&quot;
* &quot;Bonanza&quot;
* &quot;The Virginian&quot;
* &quot;The Big Valley&quot;

Henreid also directed the 1956 film &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Devotion&quot;, in which he played a supporting role, &quot;Girls on the Loose&quot; (1958), and &quot;Live Fast, Die Young&quot; (1958). In 1964, he directed &quot;Dead Ringer&quot;, which stars Bette Davis and features Henreid&#x27;s daughter, Monika Henreid, in a minor role. While working as a director, Henreid continued to accept some small acting parts:

* &quot;Ten Thousand Bedrooms&quot; (1957)
* &quot;Holiday for Lovers&quot; (1959)
* &quot;Never So Few&quot; (1959)
* &quot;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; (1962)
* &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; (1965)
* &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot; (1969)
* &quot;The Failing of Raymond&quot; (1971)

In 1973, Henreid returned to Broadway to perform in a revival of the George Bernard Shaw drama, &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot;. Henreid&#x27;s final film role was in the 1977 horror film &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic,&quot; where he played a cardinal.

==Personal life and legacy==
Henreid married Elizabeth Camilla Julia &quot;Lisl&quot; Glück (1908–1993) in 1936; the couple adopted two daughters. In 1992, at age 84, Henreid died of pneumonia in Santa Monica, California after suffering a stroke. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Santa Monica.

The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce in 1960 honored Henreid with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. The first, recognizing his film career, is located at 6366 Hollywood Boulevard. The second, for his work in television, is located at 1720 Vine Street.

<doc id="530331" wikidata="Q1250734" url="?curid=530331" title="History of Punjab">
<text>The History of Punjab refers to the past history of Punjab region which is a geopolitical, cultural, and historical region in the northwest of South Asia, comprising eastern Punjab province in Pakistan and western Punjab state in India. It is believed that the earliest evidence of human habitation in Punjab traces to the Soan valley of the Pothohar, between the Indus and the Jhelum rivers, where Soanian culture developed between 774,000 BC and 11,700 BC. This period goes back to the first interglacial period in the second Ice Age, from which remnants of stone and flint tools have been found.

The Punjab region was the site of one of the earliest cradle of civilizations, the Bronze Age Harrapan civilization that flourished from about 3000 B.C. and declined rapidly 1,000 years later, following the Indo-Aryan migrations that overran the region in waves between 1500 and 500 B.C. The migrating Indo-Aryan tribes gave rise to the Iron Age Vedic civilization, which lasted till 500 BC. During this era, the Rigveda was composed in Punjab, laying the foundation of Hinduism. In the 6th century BC, Pushkarasarin, the monarch of Gandhara, assumed a role in halting the expansionary ambitions of the Achaemenid Empire until during the reign of Darius wherein tribute rendered by Gandhara to him is first documented. A century later, the Janapadas of Punjab encountered the expansive undertakings of Alexander. The Janapadas exhibited resistance to his advances, notably the Aśvaka of Gandhara, the Mallians of South Punjab, and Porus of Central Punjab. Following the demise of Alexander, Chandragupta Maurya, who had received his education in the city of Taxila, garnered support from republics such as Trigarta and Gandhara. He subsequently conquered the Nanda Empire, with Taxila being designated as the provincial capital of the Northwestern territories. After its decline, the Indo-Greeks, Indo-Sakas and Indo-Parthians successively established reigns in Punjab however during this time a local kingdom known as the Apracharajas, maintained autonomy and other janapadas such as that of the Yaudheya and the Audumbaras in Eastern Punjab resisted their expansions. In the late 1st century AD the Kushan Empire annexed Punjab, Gandharas cultural zenith occurred during this period in which artwork from the region flourished.

The devastating Hunnic invasions of Punjab occurred in the 5th and 6th century, which were ultimately repelled by the Vardhana dynasty. Most of the western Punjab region became unified under the Taank and Odi Shahi Kingdoms in the early medieval period. Between the 8th and 12th century, the Tomara dynasty and Katoch dynasty controlled the eastern portions of Punjab. Islam became established in Punjab when the Umayyad Caliphate conquered southern portions of the region up to Multan, which became independent from the caliphate under the Emirate of Multan in 855. The Ghaznavids conquered region in 1025, after whom the Delhi Sultanate followed. The Langah Sultanate ruled much of the south Punjab in the 15th century.

The Mughal Empire, established in 1526 AD, has left an immense cultural and architectural legacy in Punjab. The city of Lahore became one of the largest in the world under Mughals. In the 16th century, Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak in central Punjab which attracted many followers. After a long period of anarchy due to decline of Mughals in the 18th century, the Sikh Empire in 1799 unified most of the Punjab region. The region was conquered by the British EIC in 1849 after Second Anglo-Sikh War and Punjab province was created in 1857. In 1947, Punjab was partitioned amidst wide-scale violence.

==Etymology==
Though the name Punjab is of Persian origin, its two parts ( and ) are cognates of the Sanskrit words, and , of the same meaning. The word &quot;Pañjāb&quot; thus means &#x27;The Land of Five Waters&#x27;, referring to the rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas. All are tributaries of the Indus River, the Sutlej being the largest. References to a land of five rivers may be found in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, which calls one of the regions in Aryavarta &quot;Panchanada&quot; (). The ancient Greeks referred to the region as &quot;Pentapotamía&quot; (), which has the same meaning as the Persian word.

==Geographical extent==

Today Punjab region is usually considered to consist of Punjab province in Pakistan and Punjab state in India. The boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts and thus the geographical definition of the term &quot;Punjab&quot; has changed over time. In the 16th century, Mughal Empire referred it to a relatively smaller area between the Indus and the Sutlej rivers. In British Raj, the Punjab Province was a large administrative region encompassing the present-day Indian states and union territories of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Delhi and the Pakistani regions of Punjab and Islamabad Capital Territory. It bordered Balochistan and North-West Frontier to the west, Jammu and Kashmir to the north, the Hindi Belt to the east, and Rajasthan and Sindh to the south.

==Prehistory==
===Paleolithic===

Homo erectus lived on the Pothohar Plateau, in upper Punjab, Pakistan along the Soan River (nearby modern-day Rawalpindi) during the Pleistocene Epoch. Soanian sites are found in the Sivalik region across what are now India, Pakistan and Nepal. The Soanian culture was a prehistoric technological culture from the Siwalik Hills. It is named after the Soan Valley in Punjab, Pakistan. The Soanian culture has been approximated to have taken place during the Middle Pleistocene period or the mid-Holocene epoch (Northgrippian). Soanian artifacts were manufactured on quartzite pebbles, cobbles, and occasionally on boulders, all derived from various fluvial sources on the Siwalik landscape. Soanian assemblages generally comprise varieties of choppers, discoids, scrapers, cores, and numerous flake type tools, all occurring in varying typo-technological frequencies at different sites.

===Neolithic===
Relics and human skulls have been found dating back to 5000 BCE in the Pothohar Plateau in north of Punjab that indicate the region was home to Neolithic peoples who settled on the banks of the Swaan River, and who later developed small communities in the region around 3000 BCE.

==Bronze Age (3300 BC – 1300 BC)==


The Indus Valley Civilisation is also known as the &quot;Harappan civilisation&quot;, after its type site Harappa, the first to be excavated early in the 20th century in Punjab. The discovery of Harappa and soon afterwards Mohenjo-daro was the culmination of work that had begun after the founding of the Archaeological Survey of India in the British Raj in 1861.

The civilisation flourished both in the alluvial plain of the Indus River, which flows through the length of Pakistan, and along a system of perennial monsoon-fed rivers that once coursed in the vicinity of the Ghaggar-Hakra, a seasonal river in northwest India and eastern Pakistan.The cities of the ancient Indus were noted for their urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage systems, water supply systems, clusters of large non-residential buildings, and techniques of handicraft and metallurgy. Mohenjo-daro and Harappa very likely grew to contain between 30,000 and 60,000 individuals, and the civilisation may have contained between one and five million individuals during its florescence. A gradual drying of the region during the 3rd millennium BCE may have been the initial stimulus for its urbanisation. Eventually it also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation&#x27;s demise and to disperse its population to the east.

==Iron Age (c. 1300 BC – 518 BC)==
=== Vedic Era ===
In ancient times the region was known as Vahika as is attested by authors such as Pāṇini and Patanjali in the 6th century CE, in which they describe the region as a territory of Sanghas which denotes a republic form of government. Pāṇini further describes the ruling class of the Vahika republics with some dominated by Brahmins and others of ‘Rajanyas’ otherwise known as Kshatriyas. The Udichya region was another region mentioned in ancient texts and is noted by Pāṇini as comprising both the regions of Vahika and Gandhara. According to Rigvedic tradition, Yayati was the progenitor of the prominent Udichya tribes and had numerous sons, including Anu, Puru, and Druhyu. The lineage of Anu gave rise to the Madra, Kekaya, Sivi and Uśīnara kingdoms of central Punjab, while the Druhyu tribe has been associated with the Gandhara kingdom based in modern day KPK and the Pothohar Plateau of Punjab.

Some of the early Janas of the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; can be strongly attributed to Punjab. &quot;Rig Vedic&quot; Janas such as the Druhyus, Anus, Purus, Yadus, Turvasas, Bharatas, and others were associated in Punjab and the Indo-Gangetic plain. Other &quot;Rig Vedic&quot; Janapadas such as the Pakhtas, Bhalanasas, Visanins, and Sivas were associated with areas in the north and west of Punjab.

==== Battle of the Ten Kings ====
An important event of the &quot;Rig Vedic&quot; era was the &quot;Battle of Ten Kings&quot; which was fought on the banks of the river Parusni (Ravi river) in central Punjab, in c. 14th century BCE, between the Bharata clan on the one hand and a confederation of ten tribes on the other. The ten tribes pitted against Sudas comprised five major tribes: the Purus, the Druhyus, the Anus, the Turvasas and the Yadus; in addition to five minor ones: the Pakthas, the Alinas, the Bhalanas, the Visanins and the Sivas. Sudas was supported by the Vedic Rishi Vasishtha, while his former Purohita, the Rishi Viswamitra, sided with the confederation of ten tribes. Sudas had earlier defeated Samvaran and ousted him from Hastinapur. It was only after the death of Sudas that Samvaran could return to his kingdom. A second battle, referred to as the Mahabharat in ancient texts, was fought in Punjab on a battlefield known as Kurukshetra. This was fought between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Duryodhana, a descendant of Kuru (who was the son of king Samvaran), had tried to insult the Panchali princess Draupadi in revenge for defeating his ancestor Samvaran.
Many Janapadas were mentioned from Vedic texts and there was a large level of contact between all the Janapadas with descriptions being given of trading caravans, movement of students from universities, and itineraries of princes. In its heyday, the University of ancient Taxila attracted students from all over Indian subcontinent as well as those from surrounding countries.

== Ancient Punjab (518 BC – c. 500 AD) ==

=== Pukkusāti and Achaemenid Gandāra (518 BC – 326 BC) ===

During the 6th century BCE, Gandhara was governed under the reign of King Pukkusāti. According to early Buddhist accounts, he had forged diplomatic ties with Magadha and achieved victories over neighbouring kingdoms such as that of the realm of Avanti. It is noted by R. C. Majumdar that Pukkusāti would have been contemporary to the Achamenid king Cyrus the Great and according to the scholar Buddha Prakash, Pukkusāti might have acted as a bulwark against the expansion of the Persian Achaemenid Empire into Gandhara. This hypothesis posits that the army which Nearchus claimed Cyrus had lost in Gedrosia had been defeated by Pukkusāti&#x27;s Gāndhārī kingdom. Therefore, following Prakash&#x27;s position, the Achaemenids would have been able to conquer Gandhāra only after a period of decline after the reign of Pukkusāti, combined with the growth of Achaemenid power under the kings Cambyses II and Darius I. However, the presence of Gandhāra, referred to as in Old Persian, among the list of Achaemenid provinces in Darius&#x27;s Behistun Inscription confirms that his empire had inherited this region from conquests carried out earlier by Cyrus. It is unknown whether Pukkusāti remained in power after the Achaemenid conquest as a Persian vassal or if he was replaced by a Persian satrap, although Buddhist sources claim that he renounced his throne and became a monk after becoming a disciple of the Buddha. The annexation under Cyrus was limited to the Western sphere of Gandhāra as only during the reign of Darius the Great did the region between the Indus River and the Jhelum River become annexed. However Megasthenes Indica, states that the Achaemenids never conquered India and had only approached its borders after battling with the Massagetae, it further states that the Persians summoned mercenaries specifically from the Oxydrakai tribe, who were previously known to have resisted the incursions of Alexander the Great, but they never entered their armies into the region.

=== Alexander&#x27;s invasion ===

Frequent intertribal wars stimulated the growth of larger groupings ruled by chieftains and kings, who ruled local kingdoms known as Mahajanapadas. The rise of kingdoms and dynasties in the Punjab is chronicled in the ancient Hindu epics, particularly the Mahabharata. In 326 B.C. The earliest known notable local king of this region was known as King Porus, who fought the famous Battle of the Hydaspes against Alexander the Great. His kingdom spanned between rivers &quot;Hydaspes&quot; (Jhelum) and &quot;Acesines&quot; (Chenab); Strabo had held the territory to contain almost 300 cities. He (alongside Abisares) had a hostile relationship with the Kingdom of Taxila which was ruled by his extended family. When the armies of Alexander crossed Indus in its eastward migration, probably in Udabhandapura, he was greeted by the-then ruler of Taxila, Omphis. Omphis had hoped to force both Porus and Abisares into submission leveraging the might of Alexander&#x27;s forces and diplomatic missions were mounted, but while Abisares accepted the submission, Porus refused. This led Alexander to seek for a face-off with Porus. Thus began the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC; the exact site remains unknown. The battle is thought to have resulted in a decisive Greek victory; however, A. B. Bosworth warns against an uncritical reading of Greek sources who were obviously exaggerative. Alexander later founded two cities—&quot;Nicaea&quot; at the site of victory and &quot;Bucephalous&quot; at the battle-ground, in memory of his horse, who died soon after the battle. Later, tetradrachms would be minted depicting Alexander on horseback, armed with a &quot;sarissa&quot; and attacking a pair of Indians on an elephant. Porus refused to surrender and wandered about atop an elephant, until he was wounded and his force routed.

When asked by Alexander how he wished to be treated, Porus replied &quot;Treat me as a king would treat another king&quot;. Despite the apparently one-sided results, Alexander was impressed by Porus and chose to not depose him. Not only was his territory reinstated but also expanded with Alexander&#x27;s forces annexing the territories of Glausaes, who ruled to the northeast of Porus&#x27; kingdom. The battle is historically significant because it resulted in the syncretism of ancient Greek political and cultural influences to the Indian subcontinent, yielding works such as Greco-Buddhist art, which continued to have an impact for the ensuing centuries.

After battle of Hydaspes, Alexander moved further southward during his in Punjab which brought him in confrontation to the Mallian tribe in the south Punjab. The Malli, together with nearby tribe of oxydrakai, gathered an army of 90,000 personnel to fight against an army of 50,000 Greeks. Alexander started his Mallian campaign and advanced quickly than the expectations of the Mallians. Many of them were killed and rest fled to the Mallian capital, Multan. Alexander besieged the city after arriving there some days later. During the siege of the city&#x27;s citadel, Alexander reputedly leaped into the inner area of the citadel, where he killed the Mallians&#x27; leader. Alexander was wounded by an arrow that had penetrated his lung, leaving him severely injured. The Greek army thereafter started killing civilians and animals and whatever came in their way to take revenge of their injured leader. The Mallian army eventually surrendered, preventing further bloodshed.

=== Mauryan Empire (316 BC – 180 BC) ===
During the Mauryan era, Punjab held a pivotal position as a core territory within the empire, with Taxila serving as the provincial capital of the North West in Gandhara. Chanakya, a prominent figure in the establishment of the Mauryan Empire, played a key role by adopting Chandragupta Maurya, the initial Mauryan emperor. Under Chanakya&#x27;s tutelage, Chandragupta received a comprehensive education at Taxila, encompassing various arts of the time, including military training, for a duration spanning 7–8 years. Plutarch&#x27;s accounts suggest that Alexander the Great encountered a young Chandragupta Maurya in the Punjab region, possibly during his time at the university. Subsequent to Alexander&#x27;s death, Chanakya and Chandragupta allied with Trigarta king Parvataka to conquer the Nanda Empire. This alliance resulted in the formation of a composite army, comprising Gandharans and Kambojas, as documented in the Mudrarakshasa.

According to the Taranatha, following the death of Ashoka, the northwestern region seceded from the Maurya Empire, and Virasena emerged as its king. Noteworthy for his diplomatic endeavors, Virasena&#x27;s successor, Subhagasena, maintained relations with the Seleucid Greeks. This engagement is corroborated by Polybius, who records an instance where Antiochus III the Great descended into India to renew his ties with King Subhagasena in 206 BCE, subsequently receiving a substantial gift of 150 elephants from the monarch.

The chief of the Mauryan military was also always a Yaudheyan warrior according to the Bijaygadh Pillar inscription, which states that the Yaudheyas elected their own chief who also served as the general for the Mauryans. The Mauryan military was also made up vastly of men from the Punjab Janapadas.

=== Indo-Greek Kingdom (c. 180 BC – c. 20 BC) ===
The Indo-Greek kingdom was founded when the Graeco-Bactrian king Demetrius (and later Eucratides) invaded Punjab from Bactria in 200 BC, taking advantage of decline of Mauryans. The Greeks in the Indian Subcontinent were eventually divided from the Graeco-Bactrians centered on Bactria (now the border between Afghanistan and Uzbekistan), and the Indo-Greeks in the present-day north-western Indian Subcontinent. Later, Menander I Soter conquered Punjab and made Sagala (present-day Sialkot) the capital of the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Menander is noted for having become a patron and convert to Greco-Buddhism and he is widely regarded as the greatest of the Indo-Greek kings.

The expression &quot;Indo-Greek Kingdom&quot; loosely describes a number of various dynastic polities, traditionally associated with a number of regional capitals like Taxila, Pushkalavati and Sagala. Other potential centers are only hinted at; for instance, Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; and the nomenclature of later kings suggest that a certain Theophila in the south of the Indo-Greek sphere of influence may also have been a satrapal or royal seat at one time.

During the two centuries of their rule, the Indo-Greek kings combined the Greek and Indian languages and symbols, as seen on their coins, and blended Greek and Indian ideas, as seen in the archaeological remains. The diffusion of Indo-Greek culture had consequences which are still felt today, particularly through the influence of Greco-Buddhist art. Following the death of Menander, most of his empire splintered and Indo-Greek influence was considerably reduced. Many new kingdoms and republics east of the Ravi River began to mint new coinage depicting military victories. The most prominent entities to form were the Yaudheya Republic, Arjunayanas, and the Audumbaras. The Yaudheyas and Arjunayanas both are said to have won &quot;victory by the sword&quot; and the Audumbaras are said to of checked the Indo-Greek advance all the way up the upper bari doab, depicting a short Indo-Greek rule in Eastern Punjab. The Datta dynasty and Mitra dynasty soon followed in Mathura. The Indo-Greeks ultimately disappeared as a political entity around 10 AD following the invasions of the Indo-Scythians, although pockets of Greek populations probably remained for several centuries longer under the subsequent rule of the Indo-Parthians and Kushans.

=== Apracharajas (c. 52 BC – 78 AD) ===

The Apracharajas was a historical dynasty situated in the region of Gandhara, extending from the governance of Menander I within the Indo-Greek Kingdom to the era of the early Kushans. Renowned for their significant support of Buddhism, this assertion is supported by swathes of discovered donations within their principal domain, between Taxila and Bajaur. Archaeological evidence also establishes dynastic affiliations between them and the rulers of Oddiyana in modern day Swat. The dynasty is argued to have been founded by Viyakamitra, identified as a vassal to Menander II, according to the Shinkot casket. This epigraphic source further articulates that Vijayamitra, a descendant of Viyakamitra, approximately half a century after the initial inscription, is credited with its restoration following inflicted damage.

==== Indo-Scythian Kingdom ====
The Indo-Scythians were descended from the Sakas (Scythians) who migrated from southern Siberia to Punjab, Pakistan and Arachosia from the middle of the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century BCE. They displaced the earlier Indo-Greeks. The power of the Saka rulers started to decline in the 2nd century CE and soon they were replaced with Indo-Parthians by the mid 1st century AD.

Some Aprachas are documented on the Silver Reliquary discovered at Sirkap, near Taxila, designating the title &quot;Stratega,&quot; denoting a position equivalent to Senapati, such as that of Indravarma who was a general during the reign of the Apracharaja Vijayamitra. Indravarma is additionally noteworthy for receiving the above-mentioned Silver Reliquary from the Indo-Scythian monarch Kharahostes, which he subsequently re-dedicated as a Buddhist reliquary, indicating was a gift in exchange for tribute or assistance. According to another reliquary inscription Indravarma is noted as the Lord of Gandhara and general during the reign of Vijayamitra. According to Apracha chronology, Indravarma was the son of Visnuvarma, an Aprachraja preceding Vijayamitra.

Indravarmas son Aspavarma is situated between 20 and 50 CE, during which numismatic evidence overlaps him with the Indo-Scythian ruler Azes II and Gondophares of the Indo-Parthians whilst also describing him as &#x27;Stratega&#x27; or general of the Aprachas. In accordance with a Buddhist Avadana, Aspavarma and a Saka noble, Jhadamitra, engaged in discussions concerning the establishment of accommodation for monks during the rainy seasons, displaying that he was a patron of Buddhism. A reliquary inscription dedicated to 50 CE, by a woman named Ariasrava, describes that her donation was made during the reign of Gondophares nephew, Abdagases I, and Aspavarma, describing the joint rule by the Aprachas and the Indo-parthians.

==== Indo-Parthian Kingdom (c. 30 AD – c. 50 AD) ====

The Indo-Parthian Kingdom was founded by Gondophares, and active from 19 CE to c. 226 CE. The city of Taxila is thought to have been a capital of the Indo-Parthians however this is where the Eastern boundary of the empire was limited to. The Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana is related by Philostratus in &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot; to have visited India, and specifically the city of Taxila around 46 AD. He describes constructions of the Greek type, probably referring to Sirkap, and explains that the Indo-Parthian king of Taxila, named Phraotes, received a Greek education at the court. The kingdom was conquered in the 1st century AD by the Kushan empire.

During the dominion of the Indo-Parthians, Apracharaja Sasan, as described on numismatic evidence identifying him as the nephew of Aspavarma, emerged as a figure of significance. Aspavarman, a preceding Apracharaja contemporaneous with Gondophares, was succeeded by Sasan, after having ascended from a subordinate governance role to a recognized position as one of Gondophares&#x27;s successors. He assumed the position following Abdagases I. The Kushan ruler Vima Takto is known through numismatic evidence to have overstruck the coins of Sasan, whilst a numismatic hoard had found coins of Sasan together with smaller coins of Kujula Kadphises It has also been discovered that Sasan overstruck the coins of Nahapana of the Western Satraps, this line of coinage dating between 40 and 78 CE.

It was noted by Philostratus and Apollonius of Tyana upon their visit with Phraotes in 46 AD, that during this time the Gandharans living between the Kabul River and Taxila had coinage of Orichalcum and Black brass, and their houses appearing as single-story structures from the outside, but upon entering, underground rooms were also present. They describe Taxila as being the same size as Nineveh, being walled like a Greek city whilst also being shaped with Narrow roads, and further describe Phraotes kingdom as containing the old territory of Porus. Following an exchange with the king, Phraotes is reported to have subsidized both barbarians and neighbouring states, to avert incursions into his kingdom. Phraotes also recounts that his father, being the son of a king, had become an orphan from a young age. In accordance with Indian customs, two of his relatives assumed responsibility for his upbringing until they were killed by rebellious nobles during a ritualistic ceremony along the Indus River. This event led to the usurpation of the throne, compelling Phraotes&#x27; father to seek refuge with the king situated beyond the Hydaspes River, in modern-day Punjab, a ruler esteemed greater than Phraotes&#x27; father. Moreover, Phraotes states that his father received an education facilitated by the Brahmins upon request to the king and married the daughter of the Hydaspian king, whilst having one son who was Phraotes himself. Phraotes proceeds to narrate the opportune moment he seized to reclaim his ancestral kingdom, sparked by a rebellion of the citizens of Taxila against the usurpers. With fervent support from the populace, Phraotes led a triumphant entry into the residence of the usurpers, whilst the citizens brandished torches, swords, and bows in a display of unified resistance.

=== Kushan Empire (c. 50 AD – c. 350 AD) ===

About the middle of the 1st century CE, the Kushan Empire expanded out of central Asia into the Punjab under the leadership of their first emperor, Kujula Kadphises. They were descended from an Indo-European, Central Asian people called the Yuezhi, a branch of which was known as the Kushans. By the time of his grandson, Kanishka, the empire spread to encompass much of south Asia at least as far as Saketa and Sarnath near Varanasi (Benares). By the 3rd century, their empire in Indian subcontinent was disintegrating and their last known great emperor was Vasudeva I. Following territory losses in the west (Bactria lost to the Kushano-Sasanians), and in the east (loss of Mathura to the Gupta Empire), several &quot;Little Kushans&quot; are known, who ruled locally in the area of Punjab with their capital at Taxila: Vasudeva II (270–300), Mahi (300–305), Shaka (305–335) and Kipunada (335–350). They probably were vassals of the Gupta Empire, until the invasion of the Kidarites destroyed the last remains of Kushan rule. In the early 3rd century BC, a union formed between the Punjab janapadas to expel the Kushans, resulting in a Kushan defeat and them being pushed all the way out of Eastern Punjab. Thus starting the fall of the empire and resulting in a century of peace in Punjab before the Gupta expansion.

===Hunnic migrations (c. 350 AD – c. 500 AD)===

After decline of Kushan empire, the central Asian Huns started migrating towards Punjab and other regions of Pakistan. First of them were the Kidarites, who around 390 AD invaded Punjab and replaced remaining remnants of the Kushans. They seem to have retained the western part of the Gupta Empire, particularly central and western Punjab, until they were displaced by the invasion of the Alchon Huns at the end of the 5th century.

The Alchon Huns were a nomadic people who invaded South Asia during the 5th and 6th centuries AD. They were first mentioned as being located in Paropamisus. Between 460 and 470 AD, the Alchons took over Gandhara and Western Punjab which also had remained under the control of the Kidarites, while the Gupta Empire remained further east. Their most famous ruler was Mihirakula who had capital in Sagala in northern Punjab.

==== Decline of Buddhism ====
The Alchons apparently undertook the mass destruction of Buddhist monasteries and stupas at Taxila, a high center of learning, which never recovered from the destruction. Virtually all of the Alchon coins found in the area of Taxila were found in the ruins of burned down monasteries, where apparently some of the invaders died alongside local defenders during the wave of destructions. One of the long lasting impact of this was the decline of Buddhism in Punjab, which was soon replaced by Hinduism as the major religion.

==Medieval Punjab (c. 500 AD – 1526 AD)==

===Taank Kingdom (6th century AD – 8th century AD)===

After the retreat of Huns in the early 6th century, Takkas, an ancient warrior group of Punjab, seized control of the Punjab. The Chinese monk Xuanzang visited in 630 AD and described it as a large and prosperous kingdom. It ruled the region in 6th and 7th centuries, as evident from the chronicles of Xuanzang and other sources. The capital of the kingdom was Sialkot.

===Hindu Shahis (9th century AD – 11th century AD)===
In the ninth century, the Hindu Shahi dynasty originating from the region of Oddiyana, replaced the Taank kingdom in the Punjab, ruling much of Western Punjab along with eastern Afghanistan. In the 10th century, the tribe of the Gakhars/Khokhars formed a large part of the Hindu Shahi army according to the Persian historian Firishta. Three of the most notable rulers were Lalliya, Bhimadeva and Jayapala.

Lalliya had reclaimed the territory at and around Kabul between 879 and 901 BC after it had been lost under his predecessor to the Saffarid dynasty. He was described as a fearsome Shahi. Two of his ministers reconstructed by Rahman as Toramana and Asata are said to of have taken advantage of Amr al-Layth&#x27;s preoccupation with rebellions in Khorasan, by successfully raiding Ghazna around 900 BC.

After a defeat in Eastern Afghanistan suffered on the Shahi ally Lawik, Bhimadeva mounted a combined attack around 963 BC. Abu Ishaq Ibrahim was expelled from Ghazna and Shahi-Lawik strongholds were restored in Kabul and adjacent areas. This victory appears to have been commemorated in the Hund Slab Inscription (HSI):

=== Arrival of Islam and the Emirate of Multan ===
At the beginning of the 8th century, Arab armies of the Umayyad Caliphate penetrated into South Asia. In 712 the Umayyads conquered Sindh and Southern Punjab up to Multan, and Islam emerged as a major power in the southern Punjab. The newly conquered region became known as Sind and was the easternmost state of the Umayyad Caliphate. Umayyad rule was later replaced with Abbasid rule in 750.

In the mid 800s, Abbasid authority in Sind weakened and five independent principalities emerged. The Banu Munnabih established themselves based at Multan. The Banu Munnabih later gave allegiance to the Abbasids, and remained unchallenged for over a century. Visitors at the time noted the power, prestige and prosperity brought to the region under Banu Munnabih rule.

Between 982–5, the power of the Banu Munnabih began to erode and Multan was conquered by Halam b. Shayban on behalf of the Fatimid caliph based in Egypt. By 985, the traveller Al-Maqdisi noted that the city of Multan was Shia, that the Friday sermon was in the name of the Fatimid and all decisions are taken in accordance with his commands.

===Ghaznavid Empire (10th century AD – 12th century AD)===
In 977, Sabuktigin, the Samanid governor of Ghazni, established an independent kingdom in western Afghanistan with Ghazni as its capital. When the Ghaznavids began expanding eastwards they came into conflict with the Hindu Shahis. This led to the Hindu Shahi ruler to form an alliance with Rajput rulers in the Punjab to check the Ghaznavid expansion.

Sabuktigin&#x27;s son Mahmud succeeded his father in 997, and began a series of raids into northern India. In 1001 he defeated Jayapala at the Battle of Peshawar and seized Hindu Shahi territory north of the river Sindh. In 1006 Mahmud attacked the Kingdom of Multan, returning a few years later to massacre the local Ismaili population.

Jayapala&#x27;s son and grandson, Anandapala and Trilochanapala respectively, resisted Mahmud for another quarter of a century and later by Bhimapala and local Ghakkhar chieftains until Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din Muhammad&#x27;s victory in Second battle of Tarain in 1192. Mahmud&#x27;s battles against the Hindu Shahi between 1001 and 1026 were significant in establishing Muslim political dominance in the Afghanistan region and surrounding Gandhar region west of Punjab. After Ghazni was conquered by Ghurid Empire, the capital of the Ghaznavids shifted to Lahore in Punjab which remained as their last capital.

===Delhi Sultanate===
Earliest mention of the region under the name &quot;Panjāb&quot; date to the early period of Delhi Sultanate, such as in the &quot;Tārīkḣ-i Waṣṣāf&quot; of the 13th century historian Wassaf, who described it as a region irrigated by Indus [&quot;Sind&quot;], Jhelum [&quot;Jelum&quot;], Lahore [&quot;Lohawar&quot;] (now known as Ravi), Satluj [&quot;Satlut&quot;] and Beas [&quot;Biyaha&quot;] rivers.

In 1173 the Ghurid dynasty replaced the Ghaznavids in Ghazni, and under Muhammad of Ghor they began expanding eastwards. Between 1175 and 1192, the Ghurid dynasty occupied the cities of Uch, Multan, Peshawar, Lahore, and Delhi. In 1206, the Ghurid general Qutb-al-din Aybeg and his successor Iltutmish founded the first of the series of Delhi Sultanates. Each dynasty would be an alternation of various inner-Asian military lords and their clients, constantly vying for power. These sultanates would make Delhi a safe haven for Muslim Turks and Persians who would flee the eventual Mongol invasions.

==== Khilji dynasty (1290 AD – 1320 AD) ====
The Khalji dynasty was the second dynasty of the Delhi sultanates, ruling from 1290 to 1320. This dynasty was a short-lived one, and extended Islamic rule to Gujarat, Rajasthan, the Deccan, and parts of Southern India. The first Mongol invasion of Punjab occurred when they were pursuing the Khwarezmian Shah, Jalal ad-Din, who was defeated in the battle of Indus in 1221. The early period of te dynasty saw numerous Mongol invasions of Punjab, and the cities of Multan and Lahore were even sacked. Ultimately, they were defeated during the rule by its able generals, Zafar Khan, Ayn al-Mulk Multani and Ghazi Malik who were Punjab Muslims. In the winter of 1297, the Chagatai noyan Kadar led an army that ravaged the Punjab region, and advanced as far as Kasur. Alauddin&#x27;s army, led by Ulugh Khan and probably Zafar Khan defeated the invaders on the Battle of Jaran-Manjur near Lahore in 1298 where quite a large number of them were taken prisoner.

==== Tughlaq dynasty (1320 AD – 1410 AD) ====
The Tughlaq dynasty&#x27;s reign formally started in 1320 in Delhi when Ghazi Malik assumed the throne under the title of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq after defeating Khusrau Khan at the Battle of Lahrawat.

During Ghazi Maliks reign, in 1321 he sent his eldest son Jauna Khan, later known as Muhammad bin Tughlaq, to Deogir to plunder the Hindu kingdoms of Arangal and Tilang (now part of Telangana). His first attempt was a failure. Four months later, Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq sent large army reinforcements for his son asking him to attempt plundering Arangal and Tilang again. This time Jauna Khan succeeded and Arangal fell, it was renamed to Sultanpur, and all plundered wealth, state treasury and captives were transferred from the captured kingdom to the Delhi Sultanate.The Muslim aristocracy in Lukhnauti (Bengal) invited Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq to extend his coup and expand eastwards into Bengal by attacking Shamsuddin Firoz Shah, which he did over 1324–1325 AD, after placing Delhi under control of his son Ulugh Khan, and then leading his army to Lukhnauti. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq succeeded in this campaign.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1325 CE, Muhammed Bin Tughlaq assumed power and his rule saw the empire expand to most of the Indian subcontinent, its peak in terms of geographical reach. He attacked and plundered Malwa, Gujarat, Lakhnauti, Chittagong, Mithila and many other regions in India His distant campaigns were expensive, although each raid and attack on non-Muslim kingdoms brought new looted wealth and ransom payments from captured people. The extended empire was difficult to retain, and rebellions all over Indian subcontinent became routine. Muhammad bin Tughlaq died in March 1351 while trying to chase and punish people for rebellion and their refusal to pay taxes in Sindh and Gujarat.

The Tughlaq empire after Muhammed Bin Tughluqs death was in a state of disarray with many regions assuming independence, it was at this point that Firuz Shah Tughlaq, Ghazi Maliks nephew, took reign. His father&#x27;s name was Rajab (the younger brother of Ghazi Malik) who had the title &quot;Sipahsalar&quot;. His mother Naila was a Punjabi Bhatti princess (daughter of Rana Mal) from Dipalpur and Abohar according to the historian William Crooke. The southern states had drifted away from the Sultanate and there were rebellions in Gujarat and Sindh&quot;, while &quot;Bengal asserted its independence.&quot; He led expeditions against Bengal in 1353 and 1358. He captured Cuttack, desecrated the Jagannath Temple, Puri, and forced Raja Gajpati of Jajnagar in Orissa to pay tribute. He also laid siege to the Kangra Fort and forced Nagarkot to pay tribute. During his time Tatar Khan of Greater Khorasan attacked Punjab however he was defeated and his face slashed by the sword given by Feroz Shah Tughlaq to Raja Kailas Pal who ruled the Nagarkot region in Punjab.

==== Sayyid Dynasty (1410–40 AD) ====
After the death of the last Tughluq ruler Nasir-ud-din Mahmud, Khizr Khan established the Sayyid dynasty, the fourth dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate after the fall of the Tughlaqs.

Following Timur&#x27;s 1398 Sack of Delhi, he appointed Khizr Khan as deputy of Multan (Punjab). He held Lahore, Dipalpur, Multan and Upper Sindh. Khizr Khan captured Delhi on 28 May 1414 thereby establishing the Sayyid dynasty. Khizr Khan did not take up the title of Sultan, but continued the fiction of his allegiance to Timur as &quot;Rayat-i-Ala&quot;(vassal) of the Timurids – initially that of Timur, and later his son Shah Rukh. After the accession of Khizr Khan, the Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Sindh were reunited under the Delhi Sultanate, where he spent his time subduing rebellions. Punjab was the powerbase of Khizr Khan and his successors as the bulk of the Delhi army during their reigns came from Multan and Dipalpur.

Khizr Khan was succeeded by his son Sayyid Mubarak Shah after his death on 20 May 1421. Mubarak Shah referred to himself as &quot;Muizz-ud-Din Mubarak Shah&quot; on his coins, removing the Timurid name with the name of the Caliph, and declared himself a Shah. He defeated the advancing Hoshang Shah Ghori, ruler of Malwa Sultanate and forced him to pay heavy tribute early in his reign. Mubarak Shah also put down the rebellion of Jasrath Khokhar and managed to fend off multiple invasions by the Timurids of Kabul.

The last ruler of the Sayyids, Ala-ud-Din, voluntarily abdicated the throne of the Delhi Sultanate in favour of Bahlul Khan Lodi on 19 April 1451, and left for Badaun, where he died in 1478.

==== Lodi Dynasty (1451 AD − 1526 AD) ====
Later, Bahlul Lodi captured Delhi and founded the Lodi dynasty, the last of the Delhi sultanate. The Lodi dynasty reached its peak under Bahlul&#x27;s grandson Sikander Lodi. Various road and irrigation projects were taken under his rule, and the rule had patronized Persian culture. Despite this, there was still persecution of the local Hindu people as many temples, such as that of Mathura, were destroyed and had a system of widespread discrimination against Hindus. The rule of Ibrahim Khan Lodi, the last Lodi emperor, emperor was a weak one and was eclipsed by the arrival of Babur&#x27;s army. 

===Langah Sultanate===

In 1445, Sultan Qutbudin, the chief of &quot;Langah jatt&quot; tribe, established the Langah Sultanate in Multan. The reign of Sultan Husayn I who ruled from 1469 to 1498 is considered to most illustrious of the Langah Sultans. Multan experienced prosperity during this time, and a large number of Baloch settlers arrived in the city at the invitation of Shah Husayn. Shah Husayn successfully repulsed attempted invasion by the Delhi Sultans led by Tatar Khan and Barbak Shah. He fought off attempts to reinstall Shiekh Yousaf who had taken refuge under Delhi Sultans. Eventually, he signed a peace treaty with Sikander Lodhi and abducted in the favour of his son. His successor, Budhan Khan, who assumed the title Sultan Mahmud Shah I, inherited the Sultanate stretched encompassing the neighbouring regions, including the cities of Chiniot and Shorkot.

Sultan Husayn I being unable to hold his trans-Indus possessions, assigned the region around Dera Ismail Khan to Sardar Malik Sohrab Dodai Baloch in 1469 or 1471 and appointed him as &quot;Jagir&quot;. The city was invaded during the reign of Sultan Husseyn II by ruler Shah Husayn of the Arghun dynasty, probably at Babur&#x27;s insistence, who was either ethnic Mongol, or of Turkic or Turco-Mongol extraction. Multan fell in 1528 after an extended siege and Shah Husayn appointed his son Mirza Askari as governor of the city, assisted by Langar Khan, one of the powerful amirs of Sultan Mahmud Langah I. Shortly after Shah Husayn departed Multan for Thatta, however, the governor was thrown out of the city. The rebels under Sultan Mahmud II administered Multan for a time independently but in 1541, Sher Shah Suri captured Multan, and the Sultanate ended.

===Founding of Sikhism===
A significant event in the late 15th century Punjab was the formation of Sikhism by Guru Nanak who was born in Nankana Sahib, Punjab, Pakistan in the Lahore province of the Delhi Sultanate. The history of the Sikh faith is closely associated with the history of Punjab and the socio-political situation in the north-west of the Indian subcontinent in the 17th century. The hymns composed by Guru Nanak were later collected in the Guru Granth Sahib, the central religious scripture of the Sikhs.

==Early Modern period (1526 AD – 1849 AD)==

===Mughal Empire===

In 1526, Babur, a descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan from the Fergana Valley was ousted from his ancestral domain in Central Asia. Bābur turned to India and crossed the Khyber Pass. He was able to secure control of Punjab, and in 1526 he decisively defeated the forces of the Delhi sultan Ibrāhīm Lodī at the First Battle of Panipat. The next year, he defeated the Rajput confederacy under Rana Sanga of Mewar, and in 1529 defeated the remnants of the Delhi sultanates. At his death in 1530 the Mughal Empire encompassed almost all of Northern India.

Bābur&#x27;s son Humāyūn (reigned 1530–40 and 1555–56) had lost territory to Sher Shah Suri, launched campaigns against the Gakkhars, about whom he suspected of being friendly with the Mughals. During this period, Sher Shah constructed the Rohtas Fort near Jhelum. Following the death of Sher Shah, in 1556, the Mughal forces under Humayun defeated Sikandar at the Battle of Panipat in 1556 and re-established the Mughal Empire across the Punjab and northern India. In 1580 the Punjab was divided into two provinces, Subah of Lahore and Subah of Multan. From 1586 to 1598, Lahore remained capital of the Mughal Empire.

Over the next twentyfour years, the Mughals gradually consolidated power in the Punjab. Campaigns followed to subdue local Zamindars and the Hill forts. The Gakkhars were co-opted and assimilated into the Mughal polity under Kamal Khan, son of Rai Sarang. Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) defeated Hemu at the Second Battle of Panipat (1556) and re-established Mughal rule. Akbar&#x27;s son Jahangir had furthered the size of the Mughal Empire through conquest, yet left much of the state bankrupt as a result. He was later buried in Lahore. Jahangir&#x27;s son Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–1658) was known for his monuments, including the Taj Mahal. He was born in Lahore. Saadullah Khan, born into the Thaheem tribe in Punjab from Chiniot remained Grand vizier (or Prime Minister) of the Mughal empire in the period 1645 to 1656. Shah Jahan&#x27;s son Aurangzeb was deeply religious and undertook extensive campaign in Deccan. He built famous Badshahi Mosque in Lahore. Aurangzeb had instilled heavy taxes on Hindus and Sikhs that had later led to an economic depression.

During the reign of Muḥammad Shah (1719–48), the empire began to decline, accelerated by warfare and rivalries, and. After the death of Muḥammad Shah in 1748, the Marathas attacked and ruled almost all of northern India. Mughal rule was reduced to only a small area around Delhi, which passed under Maratha (1785) and the British (1803) control. The last Mughal, Bahādur Shah II (reigned 1837–57), was exiled to Burma by the British. Muslims from Punjab who rose to nobility during the Mughal Era include Wazir Khan, Adina Beg Arain, and Shahbaz Khan Kamboh.
====Mughal conflicts with Sikhs====
The lifetime of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, coincided with the conquest of northern India by Babur and establishment of the Mughal Empire. Jahangir ordered the execution of Guru Arjan Dev, whilst in Mughal custody, for supporting his son Khusrau Mirza&#x27;s rival claim to the throne. Guru Arjan Dev&#x27;s death led to the sixth Guru Guru Hargobind to declare sovereignty in the creation of the Akal Takht and the establishment of a fort to defend Amritsar. Jahangir then jailed Guru Hargobind at Gwalior, but released him after a number of years when he no longer felt threatened. The succeeding son of Jahangir, Shah Jahan, took offence at Guru Hargobind&#x27;s declaration and after a series of assaults on Amritsar, forced the Sikhs to retreat to the Sivalik Hills. The ninth Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, moved the Sikh community to Anandpur and travelled extensively to visit and preach in defiance of Aurangzeb, who attempted to install Ram Rai as new guru.

====Durrani and Maratha invasions====
In 1747, the Durrani Empire was established by Ahmad Shah Abdali with his crowning as &quot;King of the Afghans&quot; by a Pashtun tribal &quot;jirga&quot;. The first time Ahmad Shah invaded Punjab, the Mughal imperial army checked his advance successfully. Yet subsequent events led to a double alliance, one by marriage and another politically, between the Afghan King and the Mughal Emperor. The battle of Panipat was the effect of this political alliance. After the victory of Panipat, Ahmad Shah Durrani became the primary ruler over Northern India. The influence of Durrani monarch continued in Northern India up to his death.

In 1757, the Sikhs were persistently ambushing guards to loot trains. In order to send a message, and prevent such occurrences from recurring, Ahmad Shah destroyed the Golden Temple in Amritsar and filled the Sarovar (Holy water pool) with cow carcasses.

In 1758 the Maratha Empire&#x27;s general Raghunathrao attacked and conquered northern and central Punjab up till Attock driving out Timur Shah Durrani, the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali, in the process. Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other provinces on the eastern side of Attock were under Maratha rule. In Punjab and Kashmir, the Marathas became major players. As Punjab served as the frontier province of the Marathas, Nana Saheb I gave the province to his key ally Adina Beg Khan who acquired the title of the &quot;Nawab of Punjab&quot; in 1758. In 1761, following the victory at the Third battle of Panipat between the Durrani and the Maratha Empire, Ahmad Shah Abdali captured remnants of the Maratha Empire in Punjab and Kashmir regions and had consolidated control over them.

In 1762, there were persistent conflicts with the Sikhs. Vadda Ghalughara took place under the Durrani rule to wipe out the Sikhs, with 30,000 Sikhs being killed, an offensive that had begun with the Mughals, with the Chhota Ghallughara, and lasted several decades under its successor states. The rebuilt Golden Temple was destroyed, and the pool was filled with cow entrails, again.

===Sikh Empire===
==== Punjabi Unification ====
In 1799, a process to unify Punjab was initiated by Ranjit Singh. Training his army under the style of the East India Company, he was able to conquer much of Punjab and surrounding areas. The invasions of Zaman Shah, the second successor of Ahmad Shah Durrani had served as a catalyst, for various Punjabi states to accede. After the first invasion, Singh had recovered his own fort at Rohtas. During the second invasion, he had emerged as a leading Sikh chief. After the third invasion, he had decisively defeated Zamah Shah. This had eventually led to the takeover of Lahore in 1799, officially forming the Sikh Empire. In 1809, Singh signed the Treaty of Amritsar with the British; in this treaty, Singh was recognised as the sole ruler of Punjab up to River Sutlej by the British.

Within ten years of Ranjit Singh&#x27;s death in 1839, the Empire was taken over by the British who had already more or less exerted indirect or direct influence throughout the Subcontinent. At Lahore, there were increasing levels of nobles vying for power. A growing instability, allowed the British to come in and take over control of the area. After the British victories at the battles of the Sutlej in 1845–46, the army and territory of the boy Raja Duleep Singh was cut down. Lahore was garrisoned by British troops, and given a resident in the Durbar. In 1849, the British had formally taken control.
===Kingdom of Bahawalpur===

The Bahawalpur state was founded in 1609 AD by Nawab Bahawal Khan Abbasi. The role of Bahawalpur state was important as the sole surviving Muslim state in Punjab. On 22 February 1833, Abbasi III entered into a subsidiary alliance with the British, to get protection against the expanding Sikh Empire. When British rule ended in 1947 and British India was partitioned into India and Pakistan, Bahawalpur joined the Dominion of Pakistan. Bahawalpur remained an autonomous entity until 14 October 1955, when it was merged with the province of West Pakistan.

==Colonial period (1849 AD – 1947 AD)==
The Punjab was annexed by the East India Company in 1849. Although nominally part of the Bengal Presidency it was administratively independent. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, apart from Revolt led by Ahmed Khan Kharal and Murree rebellion of 1857, the Punjab remained relatively peaceful. In 1858, under the terms of the Queen&#x27;s Proclamation issued by Queen Victoria, the Punjab came under the direct rule of Britain.

Colonial rule had a profound impact on all areas of Punjabi life. Economically it transformed the Punjab into the richest farming area of India, socially it sustained the power of large landowners and politically it encouraged cross-communal co-operation amongst land owning groups. The Punjab also became the major centre of recruitment into the Indian Army. By patronising influential local allies and focusing administrative, economic and constitutional policies on the rural population, the British ensured the loyalty of its large rural population.

Administratively, colonial rule instated a system of bureaucracy and measure of the law. The &#x27;paternal&#x27; system of the ruling elite was replaced by &#x27;machine rule&#x27; with a system of laws, codes, and procedures. For purposes of control, the British established new forms of communication and transportation, including post systems, railways, roads, and telegraphs. The creation of Canal Colonies in western Punjab between 1860 and 1947 brought 14 million acres of land under cultivation, and revolutionised agricultural practices in the region. To the agrarian and commercial class was added a professional middle class that had risen the social ladder through the use of the English education, which opened up new professions in law, government, and medicine.

Despite these developments, colonial rule was marked by exploitation of resources. For the purpose of exports, the majority of external trade was controlled by British export banks. The Imperial government exercised control over the finances of Punjab and took the majority of the income for itself.

===Religious revivalism===
A highlight of religious controversy during this time was that of the Ahmaddiya movement, initiated by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. In his Burahin-i-Ahmaddiya, which was meant to rejuvenate Islam on the basis of the Quran, he had attempted to refute both Christian missionaries, and Hindus and Sikhs. In another work, Ahmad argued that Guru Nanak was a Muslim. He interpreted Jihad as a peaceful method, and declared himself to be the Messiah. This was met with significant controversy.

In the first and second decades of the early 20th century, the idea of Hindu and Muslim separation had become an active political tone. Muslims were told to remain aloof of the Indian National Congress, the main body seeking Indian Independence, because there was a general fear that representation based on elections and employment-based upon competition was not in their interest. The All-India Muslim League&#x27;s demand for separate electorates for Muslims was granted at Amritsar in 1909. The Muslim League also demanded separate electorates in every province, even in those without Muslim majority populations, which was also granted by the Indian National Congress in 1916.

===Railways===
In 1862, the first section of railway in the Punjab was constructed between Lahore and Amritsar, and Lahore Junction railway station opened. Lines were opened between Lahore and Multan in 1864, and Amritsar and Delhi in 1870. The Scinde, Punjab and Delhi railways merged to form the Scinde, Punjab &amp; Delhi Railway in 1870, creating a link between Karachi and Lahore via Multan. The Punjab Northern State Railway linked Lahore and Peshawar in 1883. By 1886, the independent railways had amalgamated into North Western State Railway.

===Education===
In 1854, the Punjab education department was instituted with a policy to provide secular education in all government managed institutions. Privately run institutions would only receive grants-in-aid in return for providing secular instruction. By 1864 this had resulted in a situation whereby all grants-in-aid to higher education schools and colleges were received by institutions under European management, and no indigenous owned schools received government help. In 1882, University of Punjab was established in Lahore, the 4th university to be established in South Asia. In 1884, a reorganisation of the Punjab education system occurred, introducing measures tending towards decentralisation of control over education and the promotion of an indigenous education agency. As a consequence several new institutions were encouraged in the province. The Arya Samaj opened a college in Lahore in 1886, the Sikhs opened the Khalsa College whilst the Anjuman-i-Himayat-i-Islam stepped in to organise Muslim education.

===Unrest===
An important event of the British Raj in Punjab was the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. In 1919, Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer led fifty riflemen from the 1/9th Gurkhas, 54th Sikhs, and 59th Sikhs into the Bagh and ordered them to open fire into the crowd that had gathered there. The official number of deaths, as reported by the British government, was given as 379 killed, but some reports claimed that more than 1,000 were killed. There had been many Indian independence movements in Punjab at the time as well. Notably, the actions of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru on 17 December 1928 in which the trio was responsible for killing J.P. Saunders in revenge for the latter&#x27;s killing of Lala Lajpat Rai. They were also responsible for the bombing of the Legislative Assembly in Delhi on 8 April 1929. The three believed that the nonviolent movement was a failure. Nevertheless, the use of violence in the Indian independence movement became unpopular after the execution of the trio on 23 March 1931.

===Politics===
Punjab Legislative Council was established by colonial authorities under Government of India Act 1919. The Government of India Act 1935 introduced increased provincial autonomy to Punjab replacing the system of dyarchy. It provided for the constitution of Punjab Legislative Assembly of 175 members presided by a Speaker and an executive government responsible to the Assembly. The Unionist Party under Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan formed the government in 1937. Sir Sikandar was succeeded by Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana in 1942 who remained the Premier of the Punjab till partition in 1947. The Unionist Party dominated Punjabi politics from the 1920s until the Second World War. Its influence over the rural population severely limited the local appeal and reach of both the Indian National Congress and Muslim League. A strong supporter of colonial rule, the Unionists were weakened by the war as they were directed to sacrifice their political interests to support the war effort. Unable to placate their traditional support base with benefits from the colonial administration, they suffered a loss of authority which led to their disastrous performance at the 1946 Punjab Provincial Assembly election and a breakdown in inter-communal cooperation at a political level. Although the term of the Assembly was five years, the Assembly continued for about eight years and its last sitting was held on 19 March 1945.
==Partition of Punjab (1947)==

In 1947, the Punjab Province of British India was divided along religious lines into West Punjab and East Punjab, with East Punjab containing modern states of Indian Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. The Partition of India in 1947 split the former Raj province of Punjab; the mostly Muslim western part became the Pakistani province of West Punjab and the mostly Sikh and Hindu eastern part became the Indian province of Punjab. Many Sikhs and Hindus lived in the west, and many Muslims lived in the east, and so partition saw many people displaced and much intercommunal violence. All Punjabi princely states, except Bahawalpur, also became part of India.

The undivided Punjab, of which Punjab (Pakistan) forms a major region today, was home to a large minority population of Sikhs and Hindus unto 1947 apart from the Muslim majority. The Gurdaspur district which is partially now part of the Indian state of Punjab had a slight Muslim majority (50.2% according to the 1941 census) prior to the partition. Many Muslims fled the partition violence to settle in Pakistan.

As stated, a major consequence of partition was the sudden shift towards religious homogeneity occurred in all districts across Punjab owing to the new international border that cut through the province. This rapid demographic shift was primarily due to wide scale migration but also caused by large-scale religious cleansing riots which were witnessed across the region at the time. According to historical demographer Tim Dyson, in the eastern regions of Punjab that ultimately became Indian Punjab following independence, districts that were 66% Hindu in 1941 became 80% Hindu in 1951; those that were 20% Sikh became 50% Sikh in 1951. Conversely, in the western regions of Punjab that ultimately became Pakistani Punjab, all districts became almost exclusively Muslim by 1951.

==After Independence==
===Punjabi Subah===
After independence, the Akali Dal, a Sikh-dominated political party active mainly in Punjab, sought to create a Sikh State but idea was not very popular. However, there was push in many regions of India for reorganisation of states based on language. In Punjab, instead of religion, the Akalis launched the Punjabi Suba movement aimed at creation of a Punjabi-majority subah (&quot;province&quot;) in the erstwhile East Punjab state of India in the 1950s.In 1966, it resulted in the formation of the Punjabi speaking -majority Punjab state, the Haryanvi-Hindi-majority Haryana state and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Some Pahari majority parts of the East Punjab were also merged with Himachal Pradesh as a result of the movement.

===Khalistan movement===

Sikhs called for the creation of a separate Sikh homeland known as Khalistan in the 1970s, along the lines of Pakistan, which led to a state of emergency being declared by Indira Gandhi, who believed the creation of Khalistan would drastically weaken India, particularly since the Punjab region grew up to 70% of the country&#x27;s wheat (during the Green Revolution in India, incentives had been provided to the people of Punjab to switch to growing wheat exclusively). During Operation Blue Star, Gandhi further called in Indian troops to extinguish the few militants who had taken shelter in the Golden Temple, killing thousands of civilians in the crossfire. Attacks then targeted the Punjab State police and Indian Security forces that opposed the creation of Khalistan and wished Punjab stay under Indian rule.

<doc id="530334" wikidata="Q1384945" url="?curid=530334" title="XTEA">
<text>In cryptography, XTEA (eXtended TEA) is a block cipher designed to correct weaknesses in TEA. The cipher&#x27;s designers were David Wheeler and Roger Needham of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory, and the algorithm was presented in an unpublished technical report in 1997 (Needham and Wheeler, 1997). It is not subject to any patents.

Like TEA, XTEA is a 64-bit block Feistel cipher with a 128-bit key and a suggested 64 rounds. Several differences from TEA are apparent, including a somewhat more complex key-schedule and a rearrangement of the shifts, XORs, and additions.

==Implementations==
This standard C source code, adapted from the reference code released into the public domain by David Wheeler and Roger Needham, encrypts and decrypts using XTEA:

#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

/* take 64 bits of data in v[0] and v[1] and 128 bits of key[0] - key[3] */

void encipher(unsigned int num_rounds, uint32_t v[2], uint32_t const key[4]) {
 unsigned int i;
 uint32_t v0=v[0], v1=v[1], sum=0, delta=0x9E3779B9;
 for (i=0; i &lt; num_rounds; i++) {
 v0 += (((v1 « 4) ^ (v1 » 5)) + v1) ^ (sum + key[sum &amp; 3]);
 sum += delta;
 v1 += (((v0 « 4) ^ (v0 » 5)) + v0) ^ (sum + key[(sum»11) &amp; 3]);
 v[0]=v0; v[1]=v1;

void decipher(unsigned int num_rounds, uint32_t v[2], uint32_t const key[4]) {
 unsigned int i;
 uint32_t v0=v[0], v1=v[1], delta=0x9E3779B9, sum=delta*num_rounds;
 for (i=0; i &lt; num_rounds; i++) {
 v1 -= (((v0 « 4) ^ (v0 » 5)) + v0) ^ (sum + key[(sum»11) &amp; 3]);
 sum -= delta;
 v0 -= (((v1 « 4) ^ (v1 » 5)) + v1) ^ (sum + key[sum &amp; 3]);
 v[0]=v0; v[1]=v1;

The changes from the reference source code are minor:
* The reference source code used the codice_1 type rather than the 64-bit clean codice_2.
* The reference source code did not use codice_3 types.
* The reference source code omitted redundant parentheses, using C precedence to write the round function as e.g. codice_4;

The recommended value for the &quot;num_rounds&quot; parameter is 32, not 64, as each iteration of the loop does two Feistel-cipher rounds. To additionally improve speed, the loop can be unrolled by pre-computing the values of sum+key[].

==Cryptanalysis==

In 2004, Ko et al. presented a related-key differential attack on 27 out of 64 rounds of XTEA, requiring 220.5 chosen plaintexts and a time complexity of 2115.15.

In 2009, Lu presented a related-key rectangle attack on 36 rounds of XTEA, breaking more rounds than any previously published cryptanalytic results for XTEA. The paper presents two attacks, one without and with a weak key assumption, which corresponds to 264.98 bytes of data and 2126.44 operations, and 263.83 bytes of data and 2104.33 operations respectively.

==Block TEA==
Presented along with XTEA was a variable-width block cipher termed Block TEA, which uses the XTEA round function, but Block TEA applies it cyclically across an entire message for several iterations. Because it operates on the entire message, Block TEA has the property that it does not need a mode of operation. An attack on the full Block TEA was described by Saarinen, which also details a weakness in Block TEA&#x27;s successor, XXTEA.

<text>Abu Nasr Ali ibn Ahmad Asadi Tusi (; – 1073) was a Persian poet, linguist and author. He was born at the beginning of the 11th century in Tus, Iran, in the province of Khorasan, and died in the late 1080s in Tabriz. Asadi Tusi is considered an important Persian poet of the Iranian national epics. His best-known work is &quot;Garshaspnameh&quot;, written in the style of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;.

== Life ==
Little is known about Asadi&#x27;s life. Most of the Khorasan province was under violent attack by Turkish groups; many intellectuals fled, and those who remained generally lived in seclusion. Asadi spent his first twenty years in Ṭūs. From about 1018 to 1038 AD, he was a poet at the court of the Daylamite Abū Naṣr Jastān. Here, in 1055–56, Asadi copied Abū Manṣūr Mowaffaq Heravī&#x27;s &quot;Ketāb al-abnīa al-adwīa&quot;. He later went to Nakhjavan and completed his seminal work, the &quot;Garshāsp-nama&quot; (dedicated to Abu Dolaf, ruler of Nakhjavan), in 1065–1066. Asadi then served at the court of the Shaddadid king Manuchehr, who ruled Ani. The poet&#x27;s tomb is in the city of Tabriz.

== Works ==
Asadi&#x27;s most significant work is &quot;Garshāsp-nama&quot; (&quot;The Book [or Epic] of Garshāsp&quot;). His other important contribution is a lexicon of the modern Persian language (). Five of Asadi&#x27;s &quot;Monāẓarāt&quot; () (&quot;Debates in the form of poetry between two people or objects or concepts&quot;) also still exist.

=== &quot;Garshaspnama&quot; (&quot;The Epic of Garshāsp&quot;) ===

The &quot;Garshaspnama&quot; () epic, with 9,000 couplets, is Asadi Tusi&#x27;s major work. The hero of the poem is Garshasp (father of Kariman and great-grandfather of Šam), identified in the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; with the ancient Iranian hero Kərəsāspa- (Avestan language). In Avestan he was the son of Θrita- of the Yama clan. The poet adapted the story from a book, &quot;The Adventures of Garshāsp&quot;, saying that it complements the stories of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;; although the poem was part of folklore, it was based on written sources.

The poem begins with Yama (or Jamshid), the father of Garshāsp, who was overthrown by Zahhak and flees to Ghurang, king of Zabulistan (near modern Quetta). In Zabulistan, Jamshid falls in love with the king&#x27;s daughter and she gives birth to Garshāsp. Jamshid is forced to flee. When Garshāsp&#x27;s mother poisons herself, he spends much of his life with his grandfather and grows up to be a warrior like Jamshid. After Ghurang&#x27;s death Zahhak was to become king, although the secret remains until the birth of Kariman.

Zahhak, as king, visits Zābulistān and challenges the young Garshāsp to slay a dragon. Equipped with an antidote to dragon poison and armed with special weapons, Garshāsp kills the monster. Impressed with the child&#x27;s prowess, Zahhāk sends Garshāsp to India, where the king (a vassal of Zahhāk&#x27;s) has been replaced by the rebel prince Bahu (who does not acknowledge Zahhāk&#x27;s rule). Garshāsp defeats the rebel and remains in India to observe its marvels and engage in philosophical discourse. He then goes to Sarandib (Ceylon), where he sees the footprint of the Buddha (in Muslim sources, identified with the footprint of Adam). Asadi then recounts many legends about Adam, the father of mankind. Garshasp then meets a Brahman, whom he questions in detail about philosophy and religion. The words Asadi Tusi attributes to the Brahman relate to his Islamic neo-Platonism. Garshasp later visits Indian islands and sees supernatural wonders, which are described at great length.

The hero returns home and pays homage to Zahak. He woos a princess of Rum, restores her father (Eṯreṭ) to his throne in Zābol after his defeat by the King of Kābol and builds the city of Sistān. He has anachronistic adventures in the Mediterranean, fighting in Kairouan and Córdoba. In the West, he meets a &quot;Greek Brahman&quot; and engages in philosophical discourse with the wise man.

When he returns to Iran his father dies, and Garshāsp becomes king of Zābolestān. Although he has no son of his own, he adopts Narēmān (Rostam&#x27;s great-grandfather) as his heir. At this time Ferēdūn defeats Zahak and becomes king of Iran, and Garshāsp swears allegiance to him. Garshāsp and his nephew then go to Turan and defeat the Faghfūr of Chin (an Iranian title for the ruler of Central Asia and China, probably of Sogdian origin), bringing him as a captive to Ferēdūn. Garshāsp fights a final battle with the king of Tanger, slaying another dragon before he returns to Sistān in Zābolestān and dies.

=== &quot;Loḡat-e fors&quot; (Khorasani Persian dictionary) ===
The dictionary was written to familiarize the people of Arran and Iranian Azerbaijan with unfamiliar phrases in Eastern Persian (Darī) poetry. It is the oldest existing Persian dictionary based on examples from poetry, and contains fragments of lost literary works such as &quot;Kalila and Dimna&quot; by Rudaki and &quot;Vamiq and &#x27;Adhra&quot; by Unsuri. A variety of manuscripts exist in Iran and elsewhere; the oldest (1322) may be at the Malek Library in Tehran, although the one written in Safina-yi Tabriz is also from the same period.

=== &quot;Monāẓarāt&quot; (debates) ===
Five debates survive in the Persian poetic form of &quot;qasida&quot;. Although this form of &quot;qasida&quot; is otherwise unprecedented in Arabic or New Persian, it is part of the Middle Persian (Pahlavi) tradition. The Pahlavic poetic debate &quot;Draxt i Asurik&quot; indicates the history of this form of debate. The surviving debates are &quot;Arab o &#x27;Ajam&quot; (&quot;The Arab vs. the Persian&quot;), &quot;Mogh o Mosalman&quot; (&quot;The Zoroastrian vs. the Muslim&quot;), &quot;Shab o Ruz&quot; (&quot;Night vs. Day&quot;), &quot;Neyza o Kaman&quot; (&quot;Spear vs. Bow&quot;) and &quot;Asman o Zamin&quot; (&quot;Sky vs. Earth&quot;). The Persian wins the Persian-versus-Arab debate, while the Muslim defeats the Zoroastrian.

<doc id="530340" wikidata="Q1231614" url="?curid=530340" title="Control grid">
<text>The control grid is an electrode used in amplifying thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) such as the triode, tetrode and pentode, used to control the flow of electrons from the cathode to the anode (plate) electrode. The control grid usually consists of a cylindrical screen or helix of fine wire surrounding the cathode, and is surrounded in turn by the anode. The control grid was invented by Lee De Forest, who in 1906 added a grid to the Fleming valve (thermionic diode) to create the first amplifying vacuum tube, the Audion (triode).

== Operation ==
In a valve, the hot cathode emits negatively charged electrons, which are attracted to and captured by the anode, which is given a positive voltage by a power supply. The control grid between the cathode and anode functions as a &quot;gate&quot; to control the current of electrons reaching the anode. A more negative voltage on the grid will repel the electrons back toward the cathode so fewer get through to the anode. A less negative, or positive, voltage on the grid will allow more electrons through, increasing the anode current. A given change in grid voltage causes a proportional change in plate current, so if a time-varying voltage is applied to the grid, the plate current waveform will be a copy of the applied grid voltage. 

A relatively small variation in voltage on the control grid causes a significantly large variation in anode current. The presence of a resistor in the anode circuit causes a large variation in voltage to appear at the anode. The variation in anode voltage can be much larger than the variation in grid voltage which caused it, and thus the tube can amplify, functioning as an amplifier.

== Construction ==
The grid in the first triode valve consisted of a zig-zag piece of wire placed between the filament and the anode. This quickly evolved into a helix or cylindrical screen of fine wire placed between a single strand filament (or later, a cylindrical cathode) and a cylindrical anode. The grid is usually made of a very thin wire that can resist high temperatures and is not prone to emitting electrons itself. Molybdenum alloy with a gold plating is frequently used. It is wound on soft copper sideposts, which are swaged over the grid windings to hold them in place. A 1950s variation is the frame grid, which winds very fine wire onto a rigid stamped metal frame. This allows the holding of very close tolerances, so the grid can be placed closer to the filament (or cathode).

== Effects of grid position ==

By placing the control grid closer to the filament/cathode relative to the anode, a greater amplification results. This degree of amplification is referred to in valve data sheets as the amplification factor, or &quot;mu&quot;. It also results in higher transconductance, which is a measure of the anode current change versus grid voltage change. The noise figure of a valve is inversely proportional to its transconductance; higher transconductance generally means lower noise figure. Lower noise can be very important when designing a radio or television receiver.

== Multiple control grids ==

A valve can contain more than one control grid. The hexode contains two such grids, one for a received signal and one for the signal from a local oscillator. The valve&#x27;s inherent non-linearity causes not only both original signals to appear in the anode circuit, but also the sum and difference of those signals. This can be exploited as a frequency-changer in superheterodyne receivers.

== Grid variations ==

A variation of the control grid is to produce the helix with a variable pitch. This gives the resultant valve a distinct non-linear characteristic. This is often exploited in R.F. amplifiers where an alteration of the grid bias changes the mutual conductance and hence the gain of the device. This variation usually appears in the pentode form of the valve, where it is then called a variable-mu pentode or remote-cutoff pentode.

One of the principal limitations of the triode valve is that there is considerable capacitance between the grid and the anode (Cag). A phenomenon known as the Miller Effect causes the input capacitance of an amplifier to be the product of Cag and amplification factor of the valve. This, and the instability of an amplifier with tuned input and output when Cag is large can severely limit the upper operating frequency. These effects can be overcome by the addition of a screen grid, however in the later years of the tube era, constructional techniques were developed that rendered this &#x27;parasitic capacitance&#x27; so low that triodes operating in the upper very high frequency (VHF) bands became possible. The Mullard EC91 operated at up to 250 MHz. The anode-grid capacitance of the EC91 is quoted in manufacturer&#x27;s literature as 2.5 pF, which is higher than many other triodes of the era, while many triodes of the 1920s had figures which are strictly comparable, so there was no advance in this area. However, early screen-grid tetrodes of the 1920s, have Cag of only 1 or 2 fF, around a thousand times less. &#x27;Modern&#x27; pentodes have comparable values of Cag. Triodes were used in VHF amplifiers in &#x27;grounded-grid&#x27; configuration, a circuit arrangement which prevents Miller feedback.

<text>East Azerbaijan province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. Its capital is the city of Tabriz.

The province is located in Iranian Azerbaijan, bordering Armenia, the Republic of Azerbaijan, Ardabil province, West Azerbaijan province, and Zanjan province. East Azerbaijan is in Region 3 of Iran, with its secretariat located in its capital city, Tabriz.

==History==

East Azerbaijan is one of the most archaic territories in Iran. During the reign of Alexander III of Macedon in Iran (331 BCE), a warrior known as Attorpat led a revolt in this area, then a territory of the Medes, and thereafter it was called &quot;Attorpatkan&quot;. Since then this vicinity has been known as &quot;Azarabadegan&quot;, &quot;Azarbadgan&quot; and &quot;Azarbayjan&quot;.

Islamic researchers proclaim that the birth of the prophet Zoroaster was in this area, in the vicinity of Lake Orumieh (&quot;Chichesht&quot;), Konzak City. Needless to say, this province was subject to numerous political and economical upheavals, attracting the interest of foreigners. The Russians in particular have tried to exert a lasting influence in the region over the past 300 years, occupying the area on numerous occasions. The constitutionalist movement of Iran began here in the late 19th century.

Ethnic tensions in Azerbaijan can legally trace their origins back to the colonialist policies of Imperial Russia and later the Soviet Union. In a cable sent on 6 July 1945 by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the local Soviet commander in Russian (northern) held Azerbaijan was instructed as such:

In 1945, the Soviet Union helped set up the Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government in what is now East Azerbaijan.

==Demographics==
===Language and ethnicity===
Most of the inhabitants are ethnic Azerbaijanis who speak a Turkic language related to Turkish.

In Qarajadaḡ (today Arasbaran), that is, the region between the Aras river and the Sabalan mountain range, there are six Shiʿite, Turkic-speaking tribes of Kurdish origin: Chalabianlu, Mohammadkhanlu, Hosaynkhanlu, Hajialilu, Hasanbeiglu and Qarachorlu.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the province&#x27;s population was 3,527,267 in 911,241 households. The following census in 2011 counted 3,724,620 people in 1,085,455 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the province as 3,909,652 in 1,223,028 households.

===Administrative divisions===
At the 1986 census, there were twelve counties in East Azerbaijan province. By the 1996 census, two additional counties had been formed: Jolfa (from part of Marand), and Malekan (from part of Bonab). Between 1996 and 2002, five new counties were formed: Ajabshir, Azarshahr, Charuymaq, Osku, and Varzaqan. The table below illustrates further changes since the 2006 census.

The cities of Ahar and Mianeh of East Azerbaijan Province, along with Parsabad and Meshginshahr from Ardabil province, and Piranshahr and Salmas from West Azerbaijan, are six cities in Azerbaijan region that have joined the group of large cities with populations of over 100,000 people due to population changes after the 2016 census.

The population history and structural changes of East Azerbaijan Province&#x27;s administrative divisions over three consecutive censuses are shown in the following table.

=== Cities ===
According to the 2016 census, 2,809,424 people (over 71% of the population of East Azerbaijan province) live in the following cities: 

==Geography==

The province covers an area of approximately 47,830 km², it has a population of around four million people. The province has common borders with the Republic of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Autonomous Nakhchivan in the north, West Azerbaijan in the west, Zanjan in the south, and Ardabil in the east. A fine network of roads and railways connects East Azerbaijan to other parts of Iran and neighboring countries.

The highest point in East Azerbaijan is the volcanic peak of Sahand Mountain at of elevation, lying south of Tabriz, whereas the lower-lying areas are around Garmadooz (Ahar). The hills and mountains of the province are divided into three ranges: the Qara Daq Mountains, the Sahand and Bozqoosh Mountains, and the Qaflan Kooh Mountains.

===Climate===
The climate of East Azerbaijan is affected by Mediterranean Continental as well as the cold semi-arid climate. Gentle breezes off the Caspian Sea have some influence on the climate of the low-lying areas. Temperatures run up to 8.9 °C in Tabriz, and 20 °C in Maraqeh, in the winter dropping to −10 to −15 °C at least (depending on how cold the overall year is). The ideal seasons to visit this province are the spring and summer months.
==Culture==
From a cultural point of view, the most outstanding features are the language, Azerbaijani, and folklore of this region. The language of Azerbaijan is originally &quot;a branch of the Iranian languages known as Azari&quot; (&quot;see Ancient Azari language&quot;). However, the modern Azeri language is a Turkic language very closely related to the language of Republic of Azerbaijan and Turkey. Apart from this, the province also boasts numerous learned scholars, gnostics, several national poets such as &quot;Mowlana Baba Mazeed&quot;, &quot;Khajeh Abdol Raheem Aj Abadi&quot;, &quot;Sheikh Hassan Bolqari&quot;, and &quot;Abdolqader Nakhjavani&quot;, to name a few, and the contemporary poet &quot;Ostad Mohammad Hossein Shahriyar&quot;. The current leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, also originally comes from this region.

Iran&#x27;s Cultural Heritage Organization has registered 936 sites of historical significance in the province. Some are contemporary, and some are from the antiquity of ancient Persia. &quot;Zahak Citadel&quot;, for example, is the name of an ancient ruin in East Azerbaijan, which according to various experts, was inhabited from the second millennium BC until the Timurid era. First excavated in the 1800s by British archeologists, Iran&#x27;s Cultural Heritage Organization has been studying the structure in 6 phases.

East Azerbaijan enjoys a rich compendium of Azeri traditions. Many local dances and folk songs continue to survive among the various peoples of the province. As a longstanding province of Iran, Azerbaijan is mentioned favorably on many occasions in Persian literature by Iran&#x27;s greatest authors and poets.

==East Azerbaijan today==
East Azerbaijan province is an industrial centre of Iran. East Azerbaijan province has over 5000 manufacturing units (6% percent of national total). The value of product from these units in 1997 was US$374 million (373 billion rials = 4.07% of the national total). Total investments were valued at US$2.7 billion (2.4513 trillion rials) in 1997.

Some of the major industries in East Azerbaijan are glass industries, paper manufacturing, steel, copper and nepheline syenite, oil refinery, petrochemical processing facilities, chemical products, pharmaceutical processing, foundries, vehicle and auto-parts industries, industrial machines, agricultural machines, food industries, leather, and shoe industries.

East Azerbaijan has an excellent position in the handicraft industry of Iran, which has a large share in the exports of the province. Tabriz carpets are widely known around the world and in international markets for their vibrant designs and colors. At present there are about 66,000 carpet production units in the province, employing some 200,000 people. The annual production of these carpets is roughly 792,000 m², which comprises more than 70% of Iran&#x27;s carpet exports. 35% of all Iranian carpets are produced in East Azerbaijan. East Azerbaijan province is also one of the richest regions of Iran in natural minerals, with 180 mines in 1997, of which 121 units are currently in operation, and the rest are being planned.

UNESCO has two Biosphere reserves in East Azerbaijan province. One in Lake Urmia and the other at Arasbaran.

<text>William Edward Tidy, MBE (9 October 1933 – 11 March 2023) was a British cartoonist, writer and television personality, known chiefly for his comic strips. He was noted for his charitable work, particularly for the Lord&#x27;s Taverners, which he supported for over 30 years. Deeply proud of his working-class roots in Northern England, his most abiding cartoon strips, such as &quot;The Cloggies&quot; and &quot;The Fosdyke Saga&quot;, were set in an exaggerated version of that environment.

Tidy was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2001 New Year Honours for services to journalism.

==Early life==
Tidy was born in Tranmere, a suburb of Birkenhead, Cheshire, on 9 October 1933. He was brought up in Liverpool, where he was educated to the age of 15 at St Margaret&#x27;s Church of England Academy (then St Margaret&#x27;s Technical Commercial School), Anfield. His first published cartoon appeared in the school magazine.

After working in a shipping office Tidy joined the Royal Engineers in 1952. He sold his first cartoon to a Japanese newspaper in 1955 and in the same year left the army. He found work in a Liverpool advertising agency the following year, where he drew illustrations for advertisements in magazines. Despite having no formal artistic training, he began to sell cartoons on a freelance basis and soon left the agency to work full-time as a professional cartoonist.

==Career==
As Tidy&#x27;s work became better known and began to be published in the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot; and &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, he moved to London where, together with a number of his contemporaries in Fleet Street, he formed the British Cartoonists&#x27; Association. Tidy is known for his cartoon strips — The Cloggies ran from 1967 to 1981 in the fortnightly satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, and &quot;The Fosdyke Saga&quot; was published daily in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; from 1971 to 1984; the latter was a parody of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, set in the industrial north instead of a genteel upper-class environment. This was broadcast as a radio series in 42 parts by the BBC from 1983, with additional scripting by John Junkin. It also became a stage play with Tidy working in co-operation with playwright Alan Plater. Tidy restarted producing the Fosdyke Saga cartoon strip on his own website where he also offered a variety of his works for sale.

Other cartoon strip series and individual cartoons have been published in many other newspapers and magazines, including &quot;New Scientist&quot; (&quot;Grimbledon Down&quot; for 24 years), &quot;What&#x27;s Brewing&quot; (CAMRA&#x27;s monthly magazine), and &quot;Punch&quot;. When &quot;Punch&quot; ceased publication, Tidy attempted to buy the title. He also wrote 20 books and illustrated 70.

Tidy&#x27;s many TV appearances have included &quot;Countdown&quot;, &quot;Watercolour Challenge&quot;, &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot;, &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; and &quot;Countryfile&quot;. His radio appearances included an accomplished performance on a 1989 edition of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, when he stood in for Barry Cryer and a 1991 Series where he stood in for Tim Brooke-Taylor. He wrote and presented &quot;Draw Me&quot;, a children&#x27;s television series in 13 parts. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1975 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

Between 1985 and 1993, Tidy was a frequent celebrity guest in &#x27;Dictionary Corner&#x27; on the long-running Channel 4 gameshow &quot;Countdown&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Tidy died on 11 March 2023, at the age of 89.

Smith Gryphon, 1995. — The title alludes to one of Tidy&#x27;s best-known cartoons, in which a man leading a polar bear on a chain poses this concerned question to a representative of White Star Line, who is surrounded by vast crowds reading posted passenger lists after the sinking of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

<doc id="530361" wikidata="Q224156" url="?curid=530361" title="Hikikomori">
<text>, also known as severe social withdrawal, is total withdrawal from society and seeking extreme degrees of social isolation and confinement. &quot;Hikikomori&quot; refers to both the phenomenon in general and the recluses themselves, described as loners or &quot;modern-day hermits&quot;. The phenomenon is primarily recognized in Japan, although similar concepts exist in other languages and cultures, especially South Korea. Estimates suggest that in Japan, half a million youths have become social recluses, as well as more than half a million middle-aged individuals. In South Korea, the estimates vary from around 350,000–500,000.

==Definition==
The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare defines &quot;hikikomori&quot; as a condition in which the affected individuals refuse to leave their parents&#x27; house, do not work or go to school, and isolate themselves from society and family in a single room for a period exceeding six months. The psychiatrist Tamaki Saitō defines &quot;hikikomori&quot; as &quot;a state that has become a problem by the late twenties, that involves cooping oneself up in one&#x27;s own home and not participating in society for six months or longer, but that does not seem to have another psychological problem as its principal source&quot;.

More recently, researchers have developed more specific criteria to more accurately identify &quot;hikikomori&quot;. During a diagnostic interview, trained clinicians evaluate for:
# spending most of the day and nearly every day confined to home, 
# marked and persistent avoidance of social situations, and social relationships, 
# social withdrawal symptoms causing significant functional impairment, 
# duration exceeding six months,
# no apparent physical or mental etiology to account for the social withdrawal symptoms.

The psychiatrist Alan Teo first characterized &quot;hikikomori&quot; in Japan as modern-day hermits, while the literary and communication scholar Flavio Rizzo similarly described &quot;hikikomori&quot; as &quot;post-modern hermits&quot; whose solitude stems from ancestral desires for withdrawal.

While the degree of the phenomenon varies on an individual basis, in the most extreme cases, some people remain in isolation for years or even decades. Often &quot;hikikomori&quot; start out as school refusers, or in Japanese (an older term is ).

&quot;Hikikomori&quot; has been defined by a Japanese expert group as having the following characteristics:
#Spending most of the time at home
#No interest in going to school or working
#Persistence of withdrawal for more than 6 months
#Exclusion of schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and bipolar disorder
#Exclusion of those who maintain personal relationships (e.g., friendships)

==Common traits==
While many people feel the pressures of the outside world, &quot;hikikomori&quot; react by complete social withdrawal. In some more severe cases, they isolate themselves in their bedrooms for months or years at a time. They usually have few or no friends. In interviews with current or recovering &quot;hikikomori&quot;, media reports and documentaries have captured the strong levels of psychological distress and fear felt by these individuals.

While &quot;hikikomori&quot; favor indoor activities, some venture outdoors occasionally. The withdrawal from society usually starts gradually. Affected people may appear unhappy, lose their friends, become insecure and shy, and talk less.

==Prevalence==
According to Japanese government figures released in 2010, there were at that time 700,000 individuals living as &quot;hikikomori&quot; within Japan, with an average age of 31. (The population of Japan in 2014 was 127.3 million.) Still, the numbers vary widely among experts. These included the &quot;hikikomori&quot; who were at that time in their 40s and had spent 20 years in isolation. This group is generally referred to as the &quot;first-generation &quot;hikikomori&quot;&quot;. There is concern about their reintegration into society in what is known as &quot;the 2030 Problem&quot;, when they will be in their 60s and their parents begin to die. Additionally, the government estimates that 1.55 million people are on the verge of becoming &quot;hikikomori&quot;. Tamaki Saitō, who first coined the phrase, originally estimated that there may be over one million &quot;hikikomori&quot; in Japan, although this was not based on national survey data. Nonetheless, considering that &quot;hikikomori&quot; adolescents are hidden away and their parents are often reluctant to talk about the problem, it is extremely difficult to gauge the number accurately.

A 2015 Cabinet Office survey estimated that 541,000 recluses aged 15 to 39 existed. In 2019, another survey showed that there are roughly 613,000 people aged 40 to 64 that fall into the category of &quot;adult hikikomori&quot;, which Japan&#x27;s welfare minister Takumi Nemoto referred to as a &quot;new social issue&quot;.

While the terminology &quot;hikikomori&quot; is of Japanese origin, the phenomenon is not unique to Japan. There have been cases found in the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Oman, Spain, Germany, Italy, India, Sweden, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, France and Russia.

==Hypotheses on cause==
===Developmental and psychiatric conditions===
&quot;Hikikomori&quot; is similar to the social withdrawal exhibited by some people with autism spectrum disorder. This has led some psychiatrists to suggest that &quot;hikikomori&quot; may be affected by autism spectrum disorder and other disorders that affect social integration, but that their disorders are altered from their typical Western presentation because of Japanese sociocultural pressures. Suwa and Hara (2007) discovered that 5 of 27 cases of &quot;hikikomori&quot; had a high-functioning pervasive developmental disorder (HPDD), and 12 more had other disorders or mental diseases (6 cases of personality disorders, 3 cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder, 2 cases of depression, 1 case of slight intellectual impairment); 10 out of 27 had primary &quot;hikikomori&quot;. The researchers used a vignette to illustrate the difference between primary &quot;hikikomori&quot; (without any obvious mental disorder) and &quot;hikikomori&quot; with HPDD or other disorder. Alan Teo and colleagues conducted detailed diagnostic evaluations of 22 individuals with &quot;hikikomori&quot; and found that while the majority of cases fulfilled criteria for multiple psychiatric conditions, about 1 in 5 cases were primary &quot;hikikomori&quot;. To date, however, &quot;hikikomori&quot; is not included in the DSM-5 (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), due to insufficient data.

According to Michael Zielenziger&#x27;s book &quot;Shutting Out the Sun: How Japan Created Its Own Lost Generation&quot;, the syndrome is more closely related to posttraumatic stress disorder. The author claimed that the &quot;hikikomori&quot; interviewed for the book had discovered independent thinking and a sense of self that the current Japanese environment could not accommodate.

The syndrome also closely parallels the terms avoidant personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, agoraphobia or social anxiety disorder (also known as &quot;social phobia&quot;).

===Social and cultural influence===
Sometimes referred to as a social problem in Japanese discourse, &quot;hikikomori&quot; has a number of possible contributing factors. Alan Teo has summarized a number of potential cultural features that may contribute to its predominance in Japan. These include tendencies toward conformity and collectivism, overprotective parenting, and particularities of the educational, housing and economic systems.

Severe social withdrawal in Japan appears to affect men and women equally. However, because of differing social expectations for maturing boys and girls, the most widely reported cases of &quot;hikikomori&quot; are from middle- and upper-middle-class families; sons, typically their eldest, refuse to leave the home, often after experiencing one or more traumatic episodes of social or academic failure.

In &quot;The Anatomy of Dependence&quot;, Takeo Doi identifies the symptoms of &quot;hikikomori&quot;, and explains its prevalence as originating in the Japanese psychological construct of &quot;amae&quot; (in Freudian terms, &quot;passive object love&quot;, typically of the kind between mother and infant). Other Japanese commentators such as academic Shinji Miyadai and novelist Ryū Murakami, have also offered analysis of the &quot;hikikomori&quot; phenomenon, and find distinct causal relationships with the modern Japanese social conditions of anomie, &quot;amae&quot; and atrophying paternal influence in nuclear family child pedagogy. Young adults may feel overwhelmed by modern Japanese society, or be unable to fulfill their expected social roles as they have not yet formulated a sense of personal &quot;honne&quot; and &quot;tatemae&quot; – one&#x27;s &quot;true self&quot; and one&#x27;s &quot;public façade&quot; – necessary to cope with the paradoxes of adulthood.

The dominant nexus of &quot;hikikomori&quot; centres on the transformation from youth to the responsibilities and expectations of adult life. Indications are that advanced industrialized societies such as modern Japan fail to provide sufficient meaningful transformation rituals for promoting certain susceptible types of youth into mature roles. As do many societies, Japan exerts a great deal of pressure on adolescents to be successful and perpetuate the existing social status quo. A traditionally strong emphasis on complex social conduct, rigid hierarchies and the resulting, potentially intimidating multitude of social expectations, responsibilities and duties in Japanese society contribute to this pressure on young adults. Historically, Confucian teachings de-emphasizing the individual and favouring a conformist stance to ensure social harmony in a rigidly hierarchical society have shaped much of East Asia, possibly explaining the emergence of the &quot;hikikomori&quot; phenomenon in other East Asian countries.

In general, the prevalence of &quot;hikikomori&quot; tendencies in Japan may be encouraged and facilitated by three primary factors:

#Middle class affluence in a post-industrial society such as Japan allows parents to support and feed an adult child in the home indefinitely. Lower-income families do not have &quot;hikikomori&quot; children because a socially withdrawing youth is forced to work outside the home.
#The inability of Japanese parents to recognize and act upon the youth&#x27;s slide into isolation; soft parenting; or codependency between mother and son, known as &quot;amae&quot; in Japanese.
#A decade of flat economic indicators and a shaky job market in Japan makes the pre-existing system requiring years of competitive schooling for elite jobs appear like a pointless effort to many.

==== Role of modern technology ====
Although the connection between modern communication technologies (such as the Internet, social media and video games) and the phenomenon is not conclusively established, those technologies are considered at least an exacerbating factor that can deepen and nurture withdrawal. Previous studies of &quot;hikikomori&quot; in South Korea and Spain found that some of them showed signs of Internet addiction, though researchers do not consider this to be the main issue. However, according to associate professor of psychiatry at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Takahiro Kato, video games and social media have reduced the amount of time that people spent outside and in social environments that require direct face to face interaction. The emergence of mobile phones and then smartphones may also have deepened the issue, given that people can continue their addiction to gaming and online surfing anywhere, even in bed.

====Japanese education system====

The Japanese education system puts great demands upon youth. There is high competition to pass entrance exams into the next tier of education in what could be termed a rigid &quot;pass-or-fail&quot; ideology, which could induce a high level of stress. Echoing the traditional Confucian values of society, the educational system is viewed as playing an important part in society&#x27;s overall productivity and success.

In this social frame, students often face significant pressure from parents and society in general to conform to its dictates and doctrines. These doctrines, while part of modern Japanese society, are increasingly being rejected by Japanese youth in varying ways such as &quot;hikikomori&quot;, freeter, NEET (Not currently engaged in Employment, Education, or Training), and parasite singles. The term &quot;Hodo-Hodo zoku&quot; (the &quot;So-So tribe&quot;) applies to younger workers who refuse promotion to minimize stress and maximize free time.

Beginning in the 1960s, the pressure on Japanese youth to succeed began successively earlier in their lives, sometimes starting before pre-school, where even toddlers had to compete through an entrance exam for the privilege of attending one of the best pre-schools. This was said to prepare children for the entrance exam of the best kindergarten, which in turn prepared the child for the entrance exam of the best elementary school, junior high school, high school, and eventually for their university entrance exam. Many adolescents take one year off after high school to study exclusively for the university entrance exam, and are known as &quot;ronin&quot;. More prestigious universities have more difficult exams. The most prestigious university with the most difficult exam is the University of Tokyo.

Since 1996, the Japanese Ministry of Education has taken steps to address this &#x27;pressure-cooker&#x27; educational environment and instill greater creative thought in Japanese youth by significantly relaxing the school schedule from six-day weeks to five-day weeks and dropping two subjects from the daily schedule, with new academic curricula more comparable to Western educational models. However, Japanese parents are sending their children to private cram schools, known as &quot;juku&quot;, to &#x27;make up&#x27; for lost time.

After graduating from high school or university, Japanese youth also have to face a very difficult job market in Japan, often finding only part-time employment and ending up as freeters with little income, unable to start a family.

Another source of pressure is from their co-students, who may harass and bully (&quot;ijime&quot;) some students for a variety of reasons, including physical appearance, wealth, or educational or athletic performance. Refusal to participate in society makes &quot;hikikomori&quot; an extreme subset of a much larger group of younger Japanese that includes freeters.

==Impact==
===Japanese financial burden===
Some organizations, such as the non-profit Japanese organization &quot;NPO lila&quot;, have been trying to combat the financial burden the &quot;hikikomori&quot; phenomenon has had on Japan&#x27;s economy. The Japanese CD and DVD producer Avex Group produces DVDs of live-action women staring into a camera to help &quot;hikikomori&quot; learn to cope with eye contact and long spans of human interaction. The goal is to ultimately help &quot;hikikomori&quot; reintegrate into society by personal choice, thereby realizing an economic contribution and reducing the financial burden on parents or guardians.

=== &quot;80–50 problem&quot; ===
The &quot;80–50 problem&quot; refers to &quot;hikikomori&quot; children from earlier days now entering their 50s, as their parents on whom they rely, enter their 80s. It was first described in Japanese publications and media in the late 2010s.

In 2019, Japanese psychiatrist Tamaki Saitō held a press briefing at the Foreign Press Center Japan on the subject of &quot;hikikomori&quot;. In view of their rising age, he recommended practical advice to parents with older &quot;hikikomori&quot;, such as drawing up a lifetime financial plan for them, so they will be able to get by after the parents are gone. He also recommended that parents should not fear embarrassment or be concerned about appearances as they look at the options, including disability pensions or other forms of public assistance for their children. Tamaki emphasized the urgency and necessity for families in these situations to plan ahead; the Japanese government failed to see the urgency of the problem and demonstrated no motion toward developing substantive policies or systems like special safety nets related to the ageing group of &quot;hikikomori&quot;.

== Treatment programs ==
When it comes to psychosocial support, it is hard for therapists to attain direct access to &quot;hikikomori&quot;; research to find different and effective treatment plans to aid &quot;hikikomori&quot; has been ongoing. One such treatment plan is focused on the families of &quot;hikikomori&quot;. Such focus primarily includes educational intervention programs (e.g. lectures, role-play, etc.) that are geared towards reducing any averse stigma that family members have towards psychiatric disorders like &quot;hikikomori&quot;. These educational programs are derived from other established family support programs, specifically Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) and Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT). CRAFT specifically trains family members to express positive and functional communication, whereas MHFA provides skills to support &quot;hikikomori&quot; with depression/suicidal like behaviour. Studies so far that have modified the family unit&#x27;s behavioral response to a &quot;hikikomori&quot; has yielded positive results, indicating that family behavior is essential for recovery, however further research is still needed.

Although there has been a primary emphasis on educating family members, there are also therapy programs for the &quot;hikikomori&quot; themselves to participate in, like exercise therapy. The individual psychotherapy methods that are being stressed in current research are primarily directed towards cultivating self-confidence within the &quot;hikikomori&quot;. However, studies have delineated that efficacious treatment of &quot;hikikomori&quot; requires a multifaceted approach rather than the utilization of one individual approach, such as individual psychotherapy or family therapy.

In South Korea hikikomori in low income families can get up to ₩650,000 (equivalent to $490 or £390) as a monthly living allowance. They can also apply for subsidies for various services, including (but not limited to): health, education, counselling, legal services and cultural activities. This is in order to attempt to recover the daily lives of the hikikomori and attempt to reintegrate them into society.

A &quot;rental sister&quot; is a system whereby hikikomori are regularly visited, encouraged to try and leave their bedrooms and integrate back into society. This can come through various methods, such as talking through a door or eating out, among other methods.

==COVID-19 pandemic impact==
Based on prior outbreaks (e.g. SARS, MERS), studies have shown that due to increased loneliness, quarantined individuals have heightened stress-related mental disturbances. Considering that political, social, or economical challenges already bring people to express &quot;hikikomori&quot;-like behavior, researchers theorize that since all the aforementioned factors are by-products of a pandemic, a &quot;hikikomori&quot; phenomenon may become more common in a post-pandemic world. In fact, people who do experience mental disturbances in Japan generally view seeking the help of a psychiatrist as shameful or a reason for them to be socially shunned. Experts predict an increase in focus on issues such as the mental health problems now affecting youth, and specifically through effective telemedicine services to either the affected individual or their respective family unit.

Furthermore, with &quot;hikikomori&quot; becoming more prevalent amid a pandemic, experts theorize that it will bring out more empathy and constructive attention towards the issue.

<doc id="530362" wikidata="Q1594599" url="?curid=530362" title="Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder">
<text>Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is the name given to a B cell proliferation due to therapeutic immunosuppression after organ transplantation. These patients may develop infectious mononucleosis-like lesions or polyclonal polymorphic B-cell hyperplasia. Some of these B cells may undergo mutations which will render them malignant, giving rise to a lymphoma.

In some patients, the malignant cell clone can become the dominant proliferating cell type, leading to frank lymphoma, a group of B cell lymphomas occurring in immunosuppressed patients following organ transplant.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of PTLD are highly variable and nonspecific, and may include fever, weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue. Symptoms may be similar to those seen in infectious mononucleosis (caused by EBV). Pain or discomfort may result from lymphadenopathy or mass effect from growing tumors. Dysfunction may occur in organs affected by PTLD. Lung or heart involvement may result in shortness of breath.

Laboratory findings may show abnormally low white blood cell, red cell counts, and platelet counts. In addition, serum uric acid and lactate dehydrogenase levels may be elevated, while serum calcium levels may be decreased. All of these findings together can suggest tumor lysis syndrome.

==Causes==
The disease is an uncontrolled proliferation of B cell lymphocytes latently infected with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Production of an interleukin-10, an endogenous, pro-regulatory cytokine, has also been implicated.

In immunocompetent patients, Epstein-Barr virus can cause infectious mononucleosis in adolescents, which is otherwise asymptomatic in children during their childhood. However, in immunosuppressed transplant patients, the lack of T-cell immunosurveillance can lead to the proliferation of these EBV-infected B-lymphocytes.

However, calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and ciclosporin), used as immunosuppressants in organ transplantation inhibit T cell function, and can prevent the control of the B cell proliferation.

Depletion of T cells by use of anti-T cell antibodies in the prevention or treatment of transplant rejection further increases the risk of developing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Such antibodies include ATG, ALG and OKT3 (muromonab-CD3).

Polyclonal PTLD may form tumor masses and present with symptoms due to a mass effect, e.g. symptoms of bowel obstruction. Monoclonal forms of PTLD tend to form a disseminated malignant lymphoma.

==Diagnosis==

Definitive diagnosis is achieved by biopsying the involved tissue, which will reveal lymphoproliferative neoplasia. Most lesions will show malignant B cells, whereas a minority will show T cell neoplasia. CT imaging may show enlarged lymph nodes or a focal mass. PET scan may be helpful in the evaluation, which may show an increase in metabolic activity (PET avid) lesion, potentially guiding decisions on where to direct biopsies.

Neurologic symptoms, such as confusion or focal weakness, which may suggest involvement of the nervous system. This may be evaluated with an MRI of the brain with gadolinium based contrast and lumbar spinal tap with testing of the cerebral spinal fluid for EBV viral levels.

The presence of respiratory symptoms, such as cough or shortness of breath, in the setting of immunosuppression may suggest infection. Opportunistic infections may present in a similar fashion to PTLD. Evaluation with sputum culture for bacteria, &quot;Pneumocystis carinii&quot;, and acid fast bacilli, and fungal infections are often helpful.

==Treatment==
PTLD may spontaneously regress on reduction or cessation of immunosuppressant medication, and can also be treated with addition of anti-viral therapy. In some cases it will progress to non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma and may be fatal. A phase 2 study of adoptively transferred EBV-specific T cells demonstrated high efficacy with minimal toxicity.

==Epidemiology==
PTLD is the second most common malignancy that occurs as a complication following solid organ transplantation (skin cancer is the most common). Less commonly, PTLD occurs after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The incidence varies by the type of transplantation: the lowest rates are seen with bone marrow transplants and liver transplants. The highest rates of PTLD are seen with lung and heart transplants, which is primarily due to the need for higher levels of immunosuppression. The incidence of PTLD is highest in the first year after transplantation; roughly 80 percent of cases after transplant occur in the first year. Transplantation of unmatched or mismatched HLA bone marrow also increase the risk of PTLD. 

The main risk factors for PTLD are the degree of immune suppression and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus. Specifically, higher levels of T cell immunosuppression increase the risk PTLD. Individuals who have never been infected by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV negative) who receive an organ from a donor with prior EBV infection are 24 times more likely to develop PTLD. Similarly, CMV mismatching (with a CMV negative recipient from a CMV positive donor) increases the risk of PTLD.

<text>The Lahore Fort (; ; ) is a citadel in the walled interior of Lahore in Punjab, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of the Walled City and spreads over an area greater than . It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century, when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendor and opulence.

Though the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia, the first record of a fortified structure at the site was regarding an 11th-century mudbrick fort. The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs. Additions from the Shah Jahan period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs, while the fort&#x27;s grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the great Mughal emperors, Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned Badshahi Mosque.

After the fall of the Mughal Empire, Lahore Fort was used as the residence of Maharaja Singh, founder of the Sikh Empire. The Sikhs made several additions to the fort. It then passed to the control of the East India Company after they annexed Punjab following their victory over the Sikhs at the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849. In 1981, the fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its &quot;outstanding &quot; of Mughal monuments dating from the era when the empire was at its artistic and aesthetic .

==Location==
The fort is located in the northern part of Lahore&#x27;s old walled city. The fort&#x27;s Alamgiri gate is part of an ensemble of buildings, which along with the Badshahi Mosque, Roshnai Gate, and Samadhi of Ranjit Singh, form a quadrangle around the Hazuri Bagh. The Minar-e-Pakistan and Iqbal Park are adjacent to the northern boundary of the fort.

== History ==

===Early history===
Though the site is known to have been inhabited for millennia, the origins of Lahore Fort are obscure and traditionally based on various myths.

===Delhi Sultanate===
The first historical reference to a fort at the site is from the 11th century during the rule of Mahmud of Ghazni. The fort was made of mud and was destroyed in 1241 by the Mongols during their invasion of Lahore. A new fort was constructed in 1267 at the site by Sultan Balban of the Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. The re-built fort was destroyed in 1398 by the invading forces of Timur, only to be rebuilt by Mubarak Shah Sayyid in 1421. In the 1430s, the fort was occupied by Shaikh Ali of Kabul. It later remained under the control of the Lodi dynasty until Lahore was captured by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1526.

===Mughal era===

====Akbar period====

The present design and structure of the fort trace its origins to 1575 when the Mughal Emperor Akbar occupied the site as a post to guard the northwest frontier of the empire. The strategic location of Lahore, between the Mughal territories and the strongholds of Kabul, Multan, and Kashmir necessitated the dismantling of the old mud-fort and fortification with solid brick masonry. Lofty palaces were built over time, along with lush gardens. Notable Akbar period structures included the Doulat Khana-e-Khas-o-Am, Jharoka-e-Darshan, and Akbari Gate. Many Akbari structures were modified or replaced by subsequent rulers.

====Jahangir period====

Emperor Jahangir first mentions his alterations to the fort in 1612 when describing the Maktab Khana. Jahangir also added the Kala Burj pavilion, which features European-inspired angels on its vaulted ceiling. British visitors to the fort noted Christian iconography during the Jahangir period, with paintings of the Madonna and Jesus found in the fort complex. In 1606, Guru Arjan of the Sikh faith was imprisoned at the fort before his death.

Jahangir bestowed the massive Picture Wall, a by wall which is exquisitely decorated with a vibrant array of glazed tile, faience mosaics, and frescoes. On the spandrels of the large arched panels below Jahangir&#x27;s &quot;Khwabgah&quot; (the Imperial Bedchamber) are &quot;azdahas&quot; or winged dragons from ancient Persian mythology, cup-bearing angel figures herons, cranes and other flying birds. Many of the scenes displayed on this &#x27;Picture Wall&#x27; illustrate the court life of the Mughal sovereigns, their sports and their pastimes. One of the finest panels shows four horsemen playing the noble game of Vaughan, nowadays known as polo. Most prominent are those relating to elephant fights, which were one of the favourite recreations of the Mughal court.

The Mosque of Mariyam Zamani Begum was built adjacent to the forts of the eastern walls during the reign of Jahangir. While the mosque likely served as a Friday congregational mosque for members of the Royal Court, it was not financed by Jahangir, although it likely required his approval. The foundation of this mosque was laid by the Empress Mariam-uz-Zamani in the year 1611 and the construction was completed on the order of her son Jahangir in her honor.

====Shah Jahan period====
Shah Jahan&#x27;s first contribution to the fort commenced in the year of his coronation, 1628, and continued until 1645. Shah Jahan first ordered the construction of the Diwan-i-Aam in the style of a &quot;Chehel Sotoun&quot; - a Persian style 40-pillar public audience hall. Though construction of the Shah Burj commenced under Jahangir, Shah Jahan was displeased with its design and appointed Asif Khan to oversee reconstruction. Shah Jahan&#x27;s Shah Burj forms a quadrangle with the famous Sheesh Mahal, and Naulakha Pavilion. Both are attributed to Shah Jahan, although the Naulakha Pavilion may be a later addition possibly from the Sikh era. The white marble Moti Masjid, or Pearl Mosque, also dates from the Shah Jahan period.

====Aurangzeb period====

Emperor Aurangzeb, built the Alamgiri Gate, whose semi-circular towers and domed pavilions are a widely recognised symbol of Lahore that was once featured on Pakistani currency.

===Sikh era===

The Mughals lost the fort to the Afghan Durranis, who in turn briefly lost the fort to Maratha forces before being recaptured by the Durranis. The fort was then captured by the Bhangi Misl - one of the 12 Sikh Misls of Punjab that ruled Lahore from 1767 until 1799.

====Ranjit Singh period====

The fort fell to the army of Ranjit Singh, who took Lahore from the Bhangi Misl in 1799. During their occupation of the fort, the Sikhs made many additions to the fort and repurposed portions of it for their own use. The famed Hazuri Bagh garden and its central &quot;baradari&quot; were constructed during Sikh rule to celebrate the Maharaja&#x27;s capture of the Koh-i-Noor diamond. Ranjit Singh used the fort&#x27;s Summer Palace as his own residence, while the Moti masjid was repurposed as a Gurdwara called Moti mandir, and later used as royal treasury. The &quot;Sehdari&quot; pavilion, or &quot;Three-doored&quot; pavilion, was added to the fort during this period, as was the &quot;Ath dara&quot; or &quot;Eight-doored&quot; pavilion. The fort&#x27;s Naag Temple and Loh temple were also constructed during Sikh rule, while the Mai Jindan &quot;Haveli&quot; was extensively modified. Kharak Singh Haveli was also added. The fort&#x27;s northern outer wall, parallel to the picture wall, was constructed during this period.

The fort&#x27;s Diwan-i-Aam was destroyed in 1841 when the son of Ranjit Singh, Sher Singh bombarded the fort in his fight against Chand Kaur. Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#x27;s elder son and successor, Kharak Singh was born in the fort to his wife, Maharani Datar Kaur. The youngest son of Ranjit Singh, Maharaja Duleep Singh was born at the fort&#x27;s &quot;Mai Jindan Haveli&quot; in 1838. Duleep Singh had signed the Treaty of Bhyroval in 1847 that brought the Sikh empire to an effective end. The fort and the city had remained under the control of Ranjit Singh&#x27;s family until the fall of the Sikh Empire in 1849.

===Modern era===

The British occupied the fort after their conquest of Lahore, and made several modifications to it, primarily involving conversion of existing buildings for colonial use including hospitals and barracks for the British military. Excavations in 1959 in front of Diwan-i-Am led to the discovery of a gold coin dated 1025 CE belonging to Mahmud Ghaznavi. The coin was unearthed at the depth of from the lawn. The cultural layers were continuous to the depth of indicating that the fort was inhabited by people even before his conquest. Other pre-Mughal objects unearthed in the excavation included terracotta depicting mother goddess, horses, bulls and other figures of Hindu origin. The fort, along with the Mughal garden at Shalimar was designated as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1981.

While relaying the deteriorated floor of Akbari Gate in April 2007, three floors in the fort were unearthed belonging to the British, Sikh and Mughal periods. The floor of the British, Sikh and Mughal periods was constructed with bricks, burnt bricks and pebbles respectively. The latter either built during Jahangir&#x27;s or Shah Jahan&#x27;s era was the hallmark of Mughals.

== Layout ==

The fort is divided into two sections: first, the administrative section, which is well connected with main entrances, and includes gardens and &quot;Diwan-e-Khas&quot; for royal audiences. The second, a private and concealed residential section is divided into courts in the north and accessible through elephant gate. It also contains Sheesh Mahal, spacious bedrooms and small gardens. The exterior walls are decorated with blue Persian Kashi tiles. The original entrance faces the Maryam Zamani Mosque and the larger Alamgiri gate opens towards Hazuri Bagh through the majestic Badshahi mosque. Influence of Hindu architecture is seen in the zoomorphic corbels.

==Major structures==

===Shah Burj Quadrangle===
==== Naulakha Pavilion ====
The Naulakha Pavilion is an iconic sight of the Lahore Fort built in 1633 during the Shah Jahan period that is made of prominent white marble, and known for its distinctive curvilinear roof. It cost around 900,000 rupees, an exorbitant amount at the time. The structure derives its name from the Urdu word for 900,000, &quot;Naulakha&quot;.

The Naulakha Pavilion served as a personal chamber and was located to the west of the Sheesh Mahal, in the northern section of the fort. The pavilion served as inspiration for Rudyard Kipling, who named his Vermont home Naulakha in honour of the pavilion.

The structure was originally inlaid with precious and semi-precious stones. It reflects a mixture of contemporary traditions at the time of its construction, with a sloping-roof based on a Bengali style, and a baldachin from Europe, which makes evident the imperial as well as the religious function of the pavilion. The marble shades of the pavilion are capped with merlons to hide the view from the grounds.

====Picture Wall====

Emperor Jahangir ordered the construction of the massive &quot;Picture Wall&quot;, which is considered to be the greatest artistic triumph of the Lahore Fort. Unlike the Red Fort and Agra Fort, Lahore Fort&#x27;s ramparts were made of brick rather than red stone. The monumental Picture Wall is a large section of the outer wall which is exquisitely decorated with a vibrant array of glazed tile, faience mosaics, and frescoes.

The embellished wall stretches over much of the fort&#x27;s northern and western walls and measures approximately by . The wall contains 116 panels, which depict a myriad of subjects, including elephant fights, angels, and polo games that do not form a cohesive narrative; each can be viewed in isolation. Though begun under Jahangir, the Picture Wall was decorated throughout the 1620s, and may have been completed under the reign of his son, Shah Jahan.

The Picture Wall was badly neglected and suffered from disrepair and damage. Conservation works at the site began in 2015 by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and Walled City of Lahore Authority, which together have also restored other Lahore landmarks such as the Wazir Khan Mosque and Shahi Hammam. Detailed documentation of the wall using 3D scanner was completed in July 2016, after which conservation work would start.

==== Sheesh Mahal ====
The Sheesh Mahal (&quot;The Palace of Mirrors&quot;; ) is located within Jahangir&#x27;s &quot;Shah Burj&quot; block in the northern-western corner of the Lahore Fort. It was constructed under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1631-32 by Mirza Ghiyas Begh, the grandfather of Mumtaz Mahal, and father of Nur Jahan. The ornate white marble pavilion&#x27;s walls are decorated with frescoes and are inlaid with pietra dura and complex mirror-work known as Āina-kāri. It is among the best-known monuments of Lahore Fort and forms the jewel in the fort&#x27;s crown. The distinctive Shah Jahani style is reflected in the extensive use of white marble, and hierarchical accents of the construction.

Sheesh Mahal was reserved for personal use by the imperial family and close aides. During the Sikh Empire, &quot;Shah Burj&quot; became Ranjit Singh&#x27;s favourite place, who built a harem on top of the Sheesh Mahal. This was also the place where he would display his prized possession, the Koh-i-Noor.

====Summer Palace====

Located directly beneath the Sheesh Mahal and Shah Burj quadrangle is the Summer Palace, also known as the &quot;Pari Mahal&quot;, or &quot;Fairy Palace.&quot; The palace is a labyrinth of chambers that date from the Shah Jahan period. They were used as a residence during hot weather months, as they were cooled by effective ventilation systems that channelled cool breezes into the palace. The palace&#x27;s flooring system also helped cool the space - its floors were made of two layers that were separated by a layer of water pumped in from the Ravi River. Cool water perfumed by roses flowed through an elaborate system of 42 waterfalls and cascades throughout the palace.

The palace was historically only accessible from the overlying Sheesh Mahal, though a new entrance was built by the British near Hathi Pul, or &quot;Elephant Stairs.&quot; Its walls were decorated with intricate frescoes and marble inlay that have been severely deteriorate by layers of subsequent white-washing and centuries of dampness. Passage tunnels also exist that lead from the palace to the fort&#x27;s exterior where the River Ravi once flowed, suggesting that it may have been part of an escape tunnel designed to allow occupants to flee in case of attack.

The Summer Palace remained in use during the Sikh period under the reign of Ranjit Singh. After the defeat of the Sikh empire in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, it went into the hands of the East India Company and in 1858, into the hands of the British Raj, and its appointed agents and executors.

Beginning in World War 2, the Summer Palace was used as a storehouse for the British Civil Defence Department, and remained in use by Pakistan until 1973. The building&#x27;s structural integrity was affected by its use as a storehouse. As of 2014, the Walled City of Lahore Authority has assumed control of the space in order to undertake restoration works with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture Following its restoration, the space will house the Lahore Fort&#x27;s museum.

===Athdara===
&quot;Āth darā&quot;, an elevated pavilion with eight openings, was built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh for use as his court. It is located near the gate of the Shah Burj quadrangle and shares a wall with it. The structure is made of marble and red sandstone. The ceiling is decorated with colourful mirror-work, and Kangra style frescoes depicting Krishna are present on the interior walls.

=== Khilwat Khana ===
&quot;Khilwat Khana&quot; was built by Shah Jahan in 1633 to the east of the Shah Burj Pavilion, and west of the Shah Jahan Quadrangle. It was the residence of the royal ladies of the court. The plinth and door frames are made of marble with a curvilinear roof.

====Kala Burj====

In the northwest corner of the Khilawat Khana stands the Kala Burj (&quot;Black Pavilion&quot;). The pavilion is the most significant of the Jahangir-era additions to the Lahore Fort. The vaulted ceilings in the pavilion feature paintings in a European-influenced style of angels which symbolize the virtuosity of King Solomon, who is regarded as the ideal ruler in the Quran, and a ruler with whom Jahangir identified. Angels directing &quot;djinns&quot; are also painted on tiles in the ceiling, which also reference King Solomon. Kala Burj was used as a summer pavilion.

====Lal Burj====
In the northeast corner of the Khilawat Khana stands the Lal Burj (&quot;Red Pavilion&quot;). Like the nearby Kala Burj, the Lal Burj was built during the reign of Jahangir, though finished during the reign of Shah Jahan. Octagonal in shape, the Lal Burj was used as a summer pavilion. It features primary windows that opened to the north to catch cool breezes. The interior frescoes date mostly from the Sikh era, along with the entire upper level that was also added during the Sikh era.

===Shah Jahan&#x27;s Quadrangle===
The collection of buildings surrounding the quadrangle situated between Jahangir&#x27;s Quadrangle and Khilawat Khana is referred to as Shah Jahan&#x27;s Quadrangle.

====Diwan-i-Khas====
In contrast to the Diwan-i-Aam, the Diwan-i-Khas served as a hall where the Emperor would attend to matters of the state, and where courtiers and state guests were received. The hall was site of elaborate pageantry, with processions of up to one hour long occurring before each audience session.

====The Khwabgah of Shah Jahan====
Khwabgah was the bedroom of Shah Jahan. It was built by Shah Jahan under the supervision of Wazir Khan in 1634 during his first visit to the city. Five sleeping chambers are aligned in a single row. The chambers feature carved marble screens and are decorated with inlaid white marble and frescoes, It is the first building built by Shah Jahan in the fort. At present, its decorations have vanished except for a trace of the marble which once might have beautified the façade.

===Jahangir&#x27;s Quadrangle===
Jahangir&#x27;s Quadrangle occupies the northeastern corner of the fort. Though named for Jahangir, construction on the site began during the reign of Akbar but was completed in 1620 under Jahangir. Akbar&#x27;s syncretic style is noted in the quadrangle, as it employs column brackets carved in the form of animals. The quadrangle&#x27;s layout differs from other Mughal quadrangles which are based upon the layout of a Persian paradise garden and instead is formed by concentric rectangles with a fountain in its centre.

====Diwan-i-Aam====
The Diwan-i-Aam was built by Shah Jahan in 1628 in a prominent part of the fort immediately south of Jahangir&#x27;s Quadrangle. It was built style of a &quot;Chehel Sotoun&quot; - a Persian style 40-pillar public audience hall, in a style similar to the Diwan-i-Aam at the Agra Fort. The Diwan-i-Aam was used as a hall for the emperors to hold an audience with commoners.

Shah Jahan&#x27;s Diwan-i-Aam was destroyed in 1841 when the son of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Sher Singh bombarded the fort in his fight against Maharani Chand Kaur, the wife of Maharaja Kharak Singh. The current structure was built by the British in 1849 after their victory against the Sikhs.

====Kharak Singh Haveli====
Kharak Singh Haveli was the &quot;haveli&quot; of Kharak Singh, the heir to Ranjit Singh. It lies in the southeast of the Jahangir&#x27;s Quadrangle. It was later occupied by the British where the first and the ground floor were used as a Commandant&#x27;s Quarters and godown and servants house respectively. Currently, it houses the archaeological survey office.

====The Khwabgah of Jahangir====
The Jahangir Quadrangle is bordered on its northern edge by Jahangir&#x27;s sleeping chambers, the &quot;Bari Khwabgah&quot;, which was largely reconstructed during the British era.

====Sehdari pavilion====

The Sikh-era &quot;Sehdari&quot; pavilion, or &quot;Three-doored&quot; pavilion, is located to the east of the &quot;Bari Khwabgah&quot;. A second &quot;Sehdari&quot; pavilion was located to the west of the &quot;Bari Khwabgah&quot;, but was subsequently destroyed during the British period. The surviving pavilion was used as an office for Faqir Syed Noor-ud-din, a trusted Governor of Ranjit Singh. The architectural style of the &quot;Sehdari&quot; pavilion is typical of the Sikh period. Frescoes decorating the pavilion portray floral designs, birds, and Hindu religious themes.

===Maktab Khana===
The Maktab Khana (&quot;Clerk&#x27;s Quarters&quot;) originally known as &quot;Dawlat Khana-e-Jahangir&quot;, was constructed in 1617 under the supervision of Mamur Khan during the reign of Jahangir as a set of cloisters near the Moti Masjid. Designed by Khawaja Jahan Muhammad Dost, it was used as a passage to the Audience Hall from the palace buildings to the north. Clerks in the Maktab Khana would also record the entry of guests into the fort. It features iwans in the Persian-Timurid style on each of its four sides. Each iwan is flanked by arches.

=== Moti Masjid ===
The Moti Masjid (), one of the &quot;Pearl Mosques&quot;, is a mosque dating from the Shah Jahan Period that is located on the western side of Lahore Fort, closer to Alamgiri Gate. It is situated in the northwestern corner of &quot;Dewan-e-Aam&quot;. The white marble structure is among its prominent extensions (such as Sheesh Mahal and Naulakha pavilion) to the Lahore Fort Complex. &quot;Moti&quot; in Urdu language means &quot;pearl&quot;, which designates a perceived preciousness to the religious structure. It was an established practice among Mughal emperors to name the mosques after names for gemstones. The mosque, built between 1630–35, has three superimposed domes, two aisles of five bays, and a slightly raised central &quot;pishtaq&quot;, or portal with a rectangular frame. This five-arched facade distinguishes it from other mosques of a similar class with three-arched facades. The interior is simple and plain with the exception of ceilings that are decorated and designed in four different orders, two arcuate, and two trabeated.

After the demise of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was converted into a Sikh temple and renamed &quot;Moti Mandir&quot; during the period of the Sikh rule under Ranjit Singh&#x27;s Sikh Confederacy. He later used the building for the state treasury. When the East India Company took over Punjab in 1849, they discovered precious stones wrapped in bits of rags and placed in velvet purses scattered inside the mosque, along with other inventory.

=== Gates ===

====Akbari Gate====
Mughal Emperor Akbar built two gates. Akbari Gate was built in 1566 and is now called Maseeti Gate.

====Alamgiri Gate====
Located at the western end of the fort, the Alamgiri Gate is the entrance of the Lahore Fort. It was built by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1674. It has two semi-circular bastions where lotus petal design adorns its base. It opens to the Hazuri Bagh and faces the Badshahi Mosque. The gate is one of Lahore&#x27;s most iconic monuments, and once featured on Pakistani currency.

====Shah Burj Gate====
Restoration work was completed in March 2020 by Aga Khan Cultural Service Pakistan with funding from the Royal Norwegian Embassy, the Walled City of Lahore Authority, and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture.

=== Naag Temple ===
The Naag temple is a Sikh temple built by Chand Kaur, the wife of Kharak Singh, daughter in law of the then ruling Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The temple is square in plan and built on a raised platform. Its exterior walls are covered with fresco paintings. The temple also has a water-melon shaped dome. The site is currently closed to the public in order to prevent further deterioration.

===Mai Jindan Haveli===
&quot;Mai Jindan Haveli&quot; is of unknown origins and believed to be a Mughal structure but attributed to the Mai Jindan, Chand Kaur because of the extensive additions by the Sikhs. It is a two-storied building and is presently the site of the Sikh Gallery Museum.

== Conservation ==
In 1980, Government of Pakistan nominated the fort for inclusion in UNESCO World Heritage Site based on the criteria i, ii, and iii together with the Shalimar Gardens. In the fifth meeting session held in Sydney in October 1981, the World Heritage Site committee added both the monuments to the list.

In 2000, Pakistan sent a letter to the organization to include both the sites in List of World Heritage in Danger and sought help to restore the damaged part of the outer walls and hydraulic works of Shalamar Gardens. In April 2006, it was reported that officials had urged UNESCO to remove the name of the fort from the list of endangered World Heritage Sites because of extensive restoration work funded by Norway, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and France. Restoration projects included works at the Sheesh Mahal, Alamgiri Gate, and Hazuri Bagh. After years of extensive renovation and restoration work, the fort and Shalimar Gardens were removed from the endangered list in June 2012.

Though in 1990, UNESCO had ordered the Punjab Archaeological Department to bar the use of the Fort for state or private functions on account of historical significance, a wedding reception was held in violation on 23 December 2010. The Antiquities Act of 1975, which prohibits the use of historical places to protect them from damage, was violated in the following month by hosting a dinner in the Diwan-i-Khas.

Conservation works at the Picture Wall began in 2015 by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and Walled City of Lahore Authority. Documentation of the wall using 3D scanner was completed in July 2016, after which conservation work would start.

==Governance==
Under the 2017 Local Government Act of Punjab, Shahi Qila also serves as a union council located in the Ravi Zone.

<text>Joan Geraldine Bennett (February 27, 1910 – December 7, 1990) was an American stage, film, and television actress, one of three acting sisters from a show-business family. Beginning her career on the stage, Bennett appeared in more than 70 films from the era of silent films, well into the sound era. She is best remembered for her film noir femme fatale roles in director Fritz Lang&#x27;s films—including &quot;Man Hunt&quot; (1941), &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot; (1944), and &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; (1945)—and for her television role as matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (and ancestors Naomi Collins, Judith Collins Trask, and Flora Collins in various timelines) in the gothic 1960s soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, for which she received an Emmy nomination in 1968.

Bennett&#x27;s career had three distinct phases: first as a winsome blonde ingenue, then as a sensuous brunette femme fatale (with looks that movie magazines often compared to those of Hedy Lamarr), and finally as a warmhearted wife-and-mother figure.

In 1951, Bennett&#x27;s screen career was marred by scandal after her third husband, film producer Walter Wanger, shot and injured her agent Jennings Lang. Wanger suspected that she and Lang were having an affair, a charge which she adamantly denied. She married four times.

For her final film role, as Madame Blanc in Dario Argento&#x27;s cult horror film &quot;Suspiria&quot; (1977), she received a Saturn Award nomination.

==Early life==
Joan Geraldine Bennett was born in the Palisade section of Fort Lee, New Jersey, on February 27, 1910, the youngest of three daughters of actor Richard Bennett and actress/literary agent Adrienne Morrison. Her elder sisters were actress Constance Bennett and actress/dancer Barbara Bennett, who was the first wife of singer Morton Downey and the mother of Morton Downey Jr. Part of a famous theatrical family, Bennett&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Jamaica-born Shakespearean actor Lewis Morrison, who embarked on a stage career in the late 1860s. On the side of her maternal grandmother, actress Rose Wood, the profession dated back to traveling minstrels in 18th-century England.

Bennett first appeared in a silent movie as a child with her parents and sisters in her father&#x27;s drama &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot; (1916), which he adapted for the screen. She attended Miss Hopkins School for Girls in Manhattan, then St. Margaret&#x27;s, a boarding school in Waterbury, Connecticut, and L&#x27;Hermitage, a finishing school in Versailles, France.

On September 15, 1926, 16-year-old Bennett married John M. Fox in London. They divorced in Los Angeles on July 30, 1928, based on charges of his alcoholism. They had one child, Adrienne Ralston Fox (born February 20, 1928), for whom Bennett fought successfully in court to rename Diana Bennett Markey when the child was eight years old. Her name changed to Diana Bennett Wanger in 1944.

==Career==

Bennett&#x27;s stage debut was at age 18, acting with her father in &quot;Jarnegan&quot; (1928), which ran on Broadway for 136 performances and for which she received good reviews. By the time she turned 20 she had become a movie star through such roles as Phyllis Benton in &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; starring Ronald Colman, which was her first important role, and Lady Clarissa Pevensey opposite George Arliss in &quot;Disraeli&quot; (both 1929).

She moved quickly from movie to movie throughout the 1930s. Bennett appeared as a blonde (her natural hair color) for several years. She starred in the role of Dolores Fenton in the United Artists musical &quot;Puttin&#x27; On The Ritz&quot; (1930) opposite Harry Richman and as Faith Mapple, his beloved, opposite John Barrymore in an early sound version of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1930) at Warner Brothers.

Under contract to Fox Film Corporation, she appeared in several movies. She played the role of Jane Miller opposite Spencer Tracy in &quot;She Wanted a Millionaire&quot; (1932), receiving top billing. She was billed second, after Tracy, for her role as Helen Riley, a personable waitress who trades wisecracks, in &quot;Me and My Gal&quot; (1932).

On March 16, 1932, she married screenwriter/film producer Gene Markey in Los Angeles, but the couple divorced in Los Angeles on June 3, 1937. They had one child, Melinda Markey (born February 27, 1934, on Bennett&#x27;s 24th birthday).
Bennett left Fox to play Amy, a pert sister competing with Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s Jo in &quot;Little Women&quot; (1933), which was directed by George Cukor for RKO. This movie brought Bennett to the attention of independent film producer Walter Wanger, who signed her to a contract and began managing her career. She played the role of Sally MacGregor, a psychiatrist&#x27;s young wife slipping into insanity, in &quot;Private Worlds&quot; (1935) with Joel McCrea. Bennett starred in the film &quot;Vogues of 1938&quot; (1937), including the title sequence, in which she donned a diamond-and-platinum bracelet set with the Star of Burma ruby. Wanger and director Tay Garnett persuaded her to change her hair from blonde to brunette as part of the plot for her role as Kay Kerrigan in the scenic &quot;Trade Winds&quot; (1938) opposite Fredric March.

With her change in appearance, Bennett began an entirely new screen career as her persona evolved into that of a glamorous, seductive femme fatale. She played the role of Princess Maria Theresa in &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1939) opposite Louis Hayward, and the role of the Grand Duchess Zona of Lichtenburg in &quot;The Son of Monte Cristo&quot; (1940) opposite Hayward.


On January 12, 1940, Bennett and producer Walter Wanger were married in Phoenix, Arizona. They were divorced in September 1965 in Mexico. The couple had two children together, Stephanie Wanger (born June 26, 1943) and Shelley Wanger (born July 4, 1948). The following year, on March 13, 1949, Bennett became a grandmother at age 39.

Combined with her sultry eyes and husky voice, Bennett&#x27;s new brunette look gave her an earthier, more arresting persona. She won praise for her performances as Brenda Bentley in &quot;The House Across the Bay&quot; (1940), also featuring George Raft, and as Carol Hoffman in the anti-Nazi drama &quot;The Man I Married&quot;, a film in which Francis Lederer also starred.

She then appeared in a sequence of highly regarded film noir thrillers directed by Fritz Lang, with whom she and Wanger formed their own production company. Bennett appeared in four movies under Lang&#x27;s direction, including as Cockney Jerry Stokes in &quot;Man Hunt&quot; (1941) opposite Walter Pidgeon, as mysterious model Alice Reed in &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot; (1944) with Edward G. Robinson, and as vulgar blackmailer Katharine &quot;Kitty&quot; March in &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; (1945), another film with Robinson.
Bennett was the shrewish, cuckolding wife, Margaret Macomber, in Zoltan Korda&#x27;s &quot;The Macomber Affair&quot; (1947) opposite Gregory Peck, as deceitful wife Peggy, in Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;The Woman on the Beach&quot; (also 1947) opposite Robert Ryan and Charles Bickford, and as tormented Lucia Harper in Max Ophüls&#x27; &quot;The Reckless Moment&quot; (1949) as the victim of a blackmailer played by James Mason. Then, easily shifting images again, she changed her screen persona to that of an elegant, witty and nurturing wife and mother in two comedies directed by Vincente Minnelli.

Playing the role of Ellie Banks, the wife of Spencer Tracy and mother of Elizabeth Taylor, Bennett appeared in both &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1950) and &quot;Father&#x27;s Little Dividend&quot; (1951).

She made a number of radio appearances from the 1930s to the 1950s, performing on such programs as &quot;The Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy Show&quot;, &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, &quot;Ford Theater&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot; and the anthology series &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; and &quot;Screen Guild Theater&quot;.

With the increasing popularity of television, Bennett made five guest appearances in 1951, including an episode of Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca&#x27;s &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;. A restored kinescope of her April 26, 1951 appearance on Episode 4 of James Melton&#x27;s &quot;Ford Festival&quot; TV show (alongside Victor Borge and Dorothy Warenskjold) is viewable online. 
==Political views==
She was a very active member of both the Hollywood Democratic Committee and The Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and donated her time and money to many liberal causes (such as the Civil Rights Movement) and political candidates (including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Henry A. Wallace, Adlai Stevenson II, John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Jimmy Carter) during her lifetime.

==Scandal==
For 12 years Bennett was represented by agent Jennings Lang, the onetime vice-president of the Sam Jaffe Agency, who then headed MCA&#x27;s West Coast television operations. She and Lang met on the afternoon of December 13, 1951, to talk over an upcoming TV show.

Bennett parked her Cadillac convertible in the lot at the back of the MCA offices, at Santa Monica Boulevard and Rexford Drive, across the street from the Beverly Hills Police Department, and she and Lang drove off in his car. Meanwhile, her husband Walter Wanger drove past about 2:30 p.m. and noticed his wife&#x27;s car parked there. Half an hour later, he again saw her car there and stopped to wait. Bennett and Lang drove into the parking lot a few hours later and he walked her to her convertible. As she started the engine, turned on the headlights, and prepared to drive away, Lang leaned on the car, with both hands raised to his shoulders, and talked to her.

In a fit of jealousy, Wanger walked up and twice shot and wounded the unsuspecting agent. One bullet hit Jennings in the right thigh, near the hip, and the other penetrated his groin. Bennett said she did not see Wanger at first. She said she suddenly saw two vivid flashes, then Lang slumped to the ground. As soon as she recognized who had fired the shots, she told Wanger, &quot;Get away and leave us alone.&quot; He tossed the pistol into his wife&#x27;s car.

She and the parking lot&#x27;s service station manager took Lang to the agent&#x27;s doctor. He was then taken to a hospital, where he recovered. The police station was located across the lot, officers had heard the shots, and came to the scene and found the gun in Bennett&#x27;s car when they took Wanger into custody. Wanger was booked and fingerprinted, and underwent lengthy questioning.

&quot;I shot him because I thought he was breaking up my home,&quot; Wanger told the police chief of Beverly Hills. He was booked on suspicion of assault with intent to commit murder. Bennett denied a romance. &quot;But if Walter thinks the relationships between Mr. Lang and myself are romantic or anything but strictly business, he is wrong,&quot; she declared. She blamed the trouble on financial setbacks involving film productions Wanger was involved with, and said he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The following day Wanger, out on bond, returned to their Holmby Hills home, collected his belongings and moved out. Bennett, however, said there would not be a divorce.

On December 14, Bennett issued a statement in which she said she hoped her husband &quot;will not be blamed too much&quot; for wounding her agent. She read the prepared statement in the bedroom of her home to a group of newspapermen while TV cameras recorded the scene.

Wanger&#x27;s attorney Jerry Giesler mounted a &quot;temporary insanity&quot; defense. He then decided to waive his right to a jury, and threw himself on the mercy of the court. Wanger served a four-month sentence in the County Honor Farm at Castaic, California, 39 miles north of Downtown Los Angeles, quickly returning to his career to make a series of successful films.

Meanwhile, Bennett went to Chicago to appear on the stage in the role as the young witch Gillian Holroyd in &quot;Bell, Book, and Candle&quot;, then went on national tour with the production.

She made only five movies in the decade that followed the 1951 shooting incident, and only two films in the 1970s, for the incident was a stain on her career and she became virtually blacklisted. Blaming the scandal that occurred for destroying her career in the motion picture industry, Bennett once said, &quot;I might as well have pulled the trigger myself.&quot; Although Humphrey Bogart, a longtime friend, pleaded with Paramount Pictures on her behalf to keep her after her role as Amelie Ducotel in &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot; (1955), the studio refused.

As the movie offers dwindled after the scandal, Bennett continued touring in stage successes, such as &quot;Susan and God&quot;, &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;, &quot;The Pleasure of His Company&quot; and &quot;Never Too Late&quot;. Her next TV appearance was in the role of Bettina Blane in an episode of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; in 1954. Other roles included Honora in &quot;Climax!&quot; (1955) and Vickie Maxwell in &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (1957). In 1958, she appeared as the mother in the short-lived television comedy/drama &quot;Too Young to Go Steady&quot; to teenagers played by Brigid Bazlen and Martin Huston.

She starred on Broadway in the comedy &quot;Love Me Little&quot; (1958), which ran for only eight performances.

Of the scandal, in a 1981 interview, Bennett contrasted the judgmental 1950s with the sensation-crazed 1970s and 1980s. &quot;It would never happen that way today,&quot; she said, laughing. &quot;If it happened today, I&#x27;d be a sensation. I&#x27;d be wanted by all studios for all pictures.&quot;

==Later years==
Despite the shooting scandal and the damage it caused Bennett&#x27;s film career, she and Wanger remained married until 1965. She continued to work steadily on the stage and in television, including a guest role as Denise Mitchell in an episode of TV&#x27;s &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; (1965).

Bennett received star billing in the gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; for its entire five-year run, 1966 to 1971, receiving an Emmy Award nomination in 1968 for her performance as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, mistress of the haunted Collinwood Mansion. Her other roles in &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; were Naomi Collins, Judith Collins Trask, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard PT (parallel time, as the show described its alternate reality), Flora Collins, and Flora Collins PT. In 1970, she appeared as Elizabeth in &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot;, the feature film adaptation of the series. However, she declined to appear in the sequel &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot;, and her character Elizabeth was mentioned therein as being recently deceased.

Her autobiography &quot;The Bennett Playbill&quot;, written with Lois Kibbee, was published in 1970.

Her other TV guest appearances include Bennett&#x27;s roles as Joan Darlene Delaney in an episode of &quot;The Governor &amp; J.J.&quot; (1970) and as Edith in an episode of &quot;Love, American Style&quot; (1971). She starred in five made-for-TV movies between 1972 and 1982.

Bennett also appeared in one more feature film, as Madame Blanc in director Dario Argento&#x27;s horror film &quot;Suspiria&quot; (1977), for which she received a 1978 Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

Bennett and retired publisher/movie critic David Wilde were married on February 14, 1978, 13 days before her 68th birthday, in White Plains, New York. Their marriage lasted until her death in 1990.
Celebrated for not taking herself too seriously, Bennett said in a 1986 interview, &quot;I don&#x27;t think much of most of the films I made, but being a movie star was something I liked very much.&quot;

Bennett has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the film industry. Her star is located at 6300 Hollywood Boulevard, a short distance from the star of her sister Constance.

==Death==
Bennett died of heart failure on Friday evening, December 7, 1990, aged 80, at her home in Scarsdale, New York.

<doc id="530366" wikidata="Q272542" url="?curid=530366" title="Lady Charlotte Guest">
<text>Lady Charlotte Elizabeth Guest (née Bertie; 19 May 1812 – 15 January 1895), later Lady Charlotte Schreiber, was an English aristocrat who is best known as the first publisher in modern print format of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, the earliest prose literature of Britain. Guest established the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; as a source literary text of Europe, claiming this recognition among literati in the context of contemporary passions for the chivalric romance of King Arthur and the Gothic movement. The name Guest used for the book was derived from a mediaeval copyist&#x27;s error, already established in the 18th century by William Owen Pughe and the London Welsh societies.

As an accomplished linguist and the wife of a foremost Welsh ironmaster John Josiah Guest, she became a leading figure in the study of literature and the wider Welsh Renaissance of the 19th century. With her second husband, Charles Schreiber, she became a well known Victorian collector of porcelain; their collection is held in the Victoria and Albert Museum. She also created major collections of fans, games, and playing cards, which she gave to the British Museum. She was noted as an international industrialist, pioneering liberal educator, philanthropist and elite society hostess.

==Early life==
Lady Charlotte was born on 19 May 1812 at Uffington House in Uffington, Lincolnshire, the daughter of Albemarle Bertie, 9th Earl of Lindsey (1744–1818), and his second wife Charlotte Susanna Elizabeth Layard. She was christened Lady Charlotte Elizabeth Bertie. When she was six years old she suffered the loss of her father and during this year she was also caught in a house fire, from which she escaped. Her mother later remarried the Reverend Peter William Pegus (her first cousin), whom Charlotte reportedly disliked. She had two younger brothers and half-sisters. With time her mother slowly began to change from being an active woman to someone who retreated with illness. It is during this time that Charlotte began to take over for her mother in the running of the house.

It appears that she particularly enjoyed the refuge of the garden and with time she developed a dislike for being kept inside. Furthermore, at the age of nineteen she had continually to apologise for her family&#x27;s actions. Ever since she was young she had a keen interest in politics and keenly expressed her views on topics that she had formed an opinion on. Charlotte showed a great aptitude for languages and literature. She taught herself Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian as well as studying Latin, Greek, French and Italian with her brothers&#x27; tutor. From looking at Lady Charlotte&#x27;s life it is clear that her life was structured, as she was someone who rose early and apparently despised laziness.

Lady Charlotte&#x27;s upbringing met the standards that society had held for her class. She learnt various skills, such as singing and dancing. As she came from an aristocratic family, the Berties, attending public school was not a success; some members of the family were bullied, for example Lindsey, who was swiftly removed from school, his education thenceforth being supplied by a tutor. Lady Charlotte did not have any close friends and if any she was closest to the O’Brien sisters.

==Career==
===Dedication to education===
The first national working-class movement in the world, Chartism, helped Lady Charlotte understand that there was a need for &quot;closer involvement in practical work for the people of Dowlais&quot;. Many of the wealthier people during the 19th century helped develop educational and leisure facilities for the people who worked for them: this is something that the Guests also did. With the backing of her cousin, Henry Layard, Lady Charlotte eventually focused her efforts on providing education in Dowlais. Despite her sex, a great disadvantage in that day in public affairs, Lady Charlotte managed to propagate her ideas and implement many of her educational developments.

Lady Charlotte was very dedicated in her work and routinely visited schools. In addition, she used to give out prizes and otherwise encourage students. She also supplied schools with materials for needlework and arranged for the purchase of requisite teaching supplies. She supported schools in Swansea and Llandaff, as well as Dowlais. The Dowlais school is described as &quot;probably the most important and most progressive not only in the industrial history of South Wales, but of the whole of Britain during the nineteenth century.&quot;
Her dedication to trying to improve education can also be seen in the library that was constructed in the mid-1840s. Originally there was a subscription fee of 1s 6d, however this was later changed in 1853 and it became a public library.

===Dowlais Ironworks===
Dowlais Ironworks was a major 19th-century ironworks located near Merthyr Tydfil, one of the four main ironworks around Merthyr, the other three being Cyfarthfa, Plymouth and Penydarren Ironworks.

Charlotte Guest took assisted management of Dowlais Ironworks after the death of her husband in 1852. She along with G. T. Clark and Edward Divett would become executors and trustees of the Ironworks. As a result of this Guest would be sole trustee while a widow but she remarried in 1855 to Charles Schreiber and de facto control fell to Clark although there are reports that she gave up running the iron works, and instead travelled and assembled an impressive ceramics collection.

===Publications===

Guest arrived in Wales already expert in seven languages. She learnt Welsh, and associated with leading literary scholars of the Abergavenny Welsh Society Cymdeithas Cymreigyddion y Fenni, notably including Thomas Price, and John Jones (Tegid) who supported and encouraged her in her work. Villemarqué had an initially cordial relationship with her about Breton sources, but then plagiarised her work. She translated several mediaeval songs and poems, then in 1837 she began on the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. John Jones (Tegid) borrowed a copy of the Llyfr Coch Hergest manuscript for her from Judge Bosanquet, who had originally commissioned him to transcribe a copy when Tegid was a young scholar at Oxford. The first tale Charlotte translated from Tegid&#x27;s transcription was &quot;The Lady of the Fountain&quot; or &quot;Owain,&quot; which was well received when published in 1838.

Some characters from the tales had been profiled in William Owen Pughe&#x27;s &quot;Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales&quot;. Pughe published a translation of the first episode of Pwyll, from the First Branch, in 1795, and again in 1821. He made a complete translation of all the tales, but the work was unpublished at his death in 1835. Guest did not rely on Pughe&#x27;s translations, though she did use a Welsh dictionary Pughe had completed in 1803.

The Charlotte Guest &quot;Mabinogion&quot; became the first translation of the material to be published in modern print format. It was published in seven volumes between 1838 and 1845, with the first volumes dedicated to Guest&#x27;s favourite Arthurian material. In 1849 the work was republished in three volumes: Volume I contained the Welsh Romances &quot;Owain&quot;, &quot;Peredur&quot;, and &quot;Geraint and Enid&quot;; Volume II contained &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot; and &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot;. Volume III contained the &quot;Four Branches of the Mabinogi&quot; and &quot;Taliesin&quot;. &quot;Geraint and Enid&quot; in Volume I was the basis for Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s two poems about Geraint in the &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;.

The seven volume series 1838–45, and the three volume set 1849, were all bilingual, presenting Tegid&#x27;s transcribed Welsh text, and Guest&#x27;s English translation. They included copious scholarly footnotes, mainly in English, totalling 145 pages in all. They were lavishly produced, with full illustrations, and gold tooled, leather covers. All volumes were published simultaneously in Llandovery, Wales by the Tonn Press, and by Longmans of London.

The next edition in 1877 was the English translation only, and this became the standard edition which was to become so very well known.

===The name &#x27;Mabinogion&#x27;===
The name &quot;Mabinogion&quot; for these stories is often incorrectly thought to begin with Guest but it was already in use in the late 18th century cf. Pughe 1795 and his circle in the London Welsh Societies. The name was derived from a mediaeval copyist mistake where a single instance of the word &quot;mabynnogyon&quot; looks like a plural for the term &#x27;mabinogi;&#x27; but &#x27;mabinogi&#x27; is already a Welsh plural.

The meaning &quot;Mabinogi&quot; is obscure, but it clearly roots in the word &#x27;mab&#x27; for son, child, young person: this is to be seen in the naming convention &#x27;son of&#x27; in genealogies. Beyond that scholars have no consensus. As a title the &#x27;Mabinogi&#x27; properly applies to only the Four Branches of the Mabinogi. These are not just four stories, as each contains at least three tales, but they are formally referred to as four tales out of the eleven which comprise the standardised Mabinogion collection, post-Guest.
Guest&#x27;s own collection included twelve stories, adding in the Hanes Taliesin which is subsequently omitted by other scholars, as it is not found in the Llyfr Coch Hergest, or the Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch, like the rest.

In 2007 the leading modern scholar of the field, John Bollard, challenged the validity of the Mabinogion collection, saying that apart from the Four Branches of the Mabinogi which are coherent, the stories have little in common with each other except that they are prose fictions surviving in the same mediaeval manuscripts.

==Personal life==
During her life she had many suitors. At one point Herbert Marsh was considered as a possible suitor. She made friends with the learned men of the time and almost married the future Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli (1804–1881), who was attracted to her intelligence. Her first love is believed to have been Augustus O’Brien whom she had met at the age of fourteen, something which was later described as the best day of her life. However, this relationship was doomed as her mother was entirely against her daughter being bound to the son of a local squire, even going as far as to claim that she would sooner see her daughter in a grave than married to Augustus.

===First marriage===
After the brief flirtation with Disraeli, she escaped her unhappy home life through marriage in 1833, at the age of twenty-one. Her husband, John Josiah Guest, was a prominent industrialist and ironmaster (owner of the Dowlais Iron Company, the largest of its day) and the first member of parliament from the town of Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. He was much older than she was; 49 to her 21. The couple married on 29 July 1833 and moved to a newly built mansion in Dowlais in Merthyr Tydfil. Though Guest was member of parliament for Merthyr, extremely wealthy, and of good family, he was much lower in status than his aristocratic wife, which caused her significant social strain. Despite this they remained married until his death in 1852, and Charlotte was mainly very happy in her marriage. She bore ten children:
* Charlotte Maria Guest (1834–1902), who married Richard Du Cane (d. 1904), brother of Edmund Frederick Du Cane.
* Ivor Bertie Guest (1835–1914), who married Lady Cornelia Henrietta Maria Spencer-Churchill (1847–1927), daughter of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough
* Katharine Gwladys Guest (1837–1926), who married the Reverend Frederick Cecil Alderson (d. 1907), son of Sir Edward Hall Alderson
* Thomas Merthyr Guest (1838–1904), who married the writer and philanthropist Lady Theodora Grosvenor (1840–1924), daughter of Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster
* Montague John Guest (1839–1909), a Liberal politician, who never married.
* Augustus Frederick Guest (1840–1862), who died aged 21.
* Arthur Edward Guest (1841–1898), a Conservative politician, who married Adeline Mary Chapman (d. 1931)
* Mary Enid Evelyn Guest (1843–1912), who married Sir Austen Henry Layard (1817–1894).
* Constance Rhiannon Guest (1844–1916), who married Hon. Charles George Cornwallis Eliot (1839–1901), youngest son of Edward Eliot, 3rd Earl of St Germans
* Blanche Vere Guest (1847–1919), who married Edward Ponsonby, 8th Earl of Bessborough (1851–1920).

She took an enthusiastic interest in her husband&#x27;s philanthropic activities on behalf of the local community, and they built pioneering schools for their workers, as well as piping in clean water for their cottages when this was still a very new technology. She was increasingly trusted by her husband as his assistant at the ironworks, and she acted as his representative for the company. She translated technical documents from French. John Guest was created a baronet in 1838, due in no small part to his wife&#x27;s social engineering. The decline of Josiah&#x27;s health meant that Charlotte spent more time administering the business and took it over completely following his death in 1852. She negotiated strikes and a slump, and stood up to other foundry owners, stabilising the business until in 1855 she could hand on the business to her eldest son, Ivor, and the manager G. T. Clark.

Guest, with her contemporary and friend Lady Llanover, was a patron of the arts in Wales. Her &quot;Enid&quot; was a literary influence on Tennyson, and her theories and sources influenced European artists, poets and writers. She published, promoted and translated of the books of &quot;The Mabinogion&quot;, with her 1877 single volume edition of the English translation being adopted as part of the Everyman series in 1902. Further editions were published during the 20th century. In 2004 the work was published online by the Gutenberg project, and in 2008 Colin Jones published recordings with music. Modern translations of &quot;The Mabinogion&quot; include John Bollard&#x27;s series (2007–2010) and that of Sioned Davies (2008).

===Second marriage===
In 1855, Charlotte married Charles Schreiber (10 May 1826 – 31 March 1884) a classical scholar who had recently been her sons&#x27; tutor, and who was 14 years her junior. The difference in status and age created a major social scandal and set her apart from many of her former close friends such as Augusta Hall. However, with her experienced political support, her new husband became a member of parliament for Cheltenham and later Poole. They spent many years travelling in Europe collecting ceramics which she bequeathed to the Victoria and Albert Museum. She also collected fans, board games and playing cards, which were later donated to the British Museum.

Despite the death of her first husband, Charlotte maintained an active role in implementing his philanthropic aims for the estate at Canford Manor. In 1867 the first pair of estate cottages for workers were built. They were to be the first 2 of 111 cottages known as Lady Wimborne Cottages after Lady Cornelia Guest, daughter-in-law to Charlotte and wife of Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, who continued Charlotte&#x27;s project for the construction of the estate cottages.

In 1884, Guest was again widowed, but lived on to an advanced age. In her last few years, she became blind, but used the last of her eyesight to knit scarves for cabbies. She was finally unable to continue the journal she had written almost without a break since she was 10 years old. On 15 January 1895, she died at the age of 82 at Canford Manor in Dorset.

===Descendants===
Among her many grandchildren were: Edward Ponsonby, the 8th Earl of Bessborough, Granville Eliot (1867–1942) and Montague Eliot (1870–1960), who became the 7th and 8th Earls of St Germans, respectively. There was also Frances Guest (1869–1957), known as Lady Chelmsford, who married Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford, who served as Viceroy of India, Ivor Churchill Guest (1873–1939), who became 1st Viscount Wimborne, Christian Henry Charles Guest (1874–1957), a Liberal member of parliament &quot;MP&quot;, Frederick &quot;Freddie&quot; Edward Guest (1875–1937), another Liberal MP, and Oscar Montague Guest (1888–1958), who was both a Liberal, and later, a Conservative MP. Among her other descendants are the American Guests (the late socialite C. Z. Guest was the wife of one of these), the Earls of Bessborough, the Viscounts Chelmsford, and others.

<text>Ivor Bertie Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, 2nd Baronet, DL (29 August 1835 – 22 February 1914) was a British industrialist and a member of the prominent Guest family.

==Early life==
Ivor Bertie Guest was born at Dowlais, near Merthyr Tydfil, the son of Lady Charlotte Guest, translator of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, and Sir John Josiah Guest, 1st Baronet, owner of the world&#x27;s largest iron foundry, Dowlais Ironworks. His middle name (Bertie) was from his mother&#x27;s family, the Earls of Abingdon, descended from a Tudor courtier who married the Dowager Duchess of Suffolk (herself &quot;suo jure&quot; Baroness Willoughby de Eresby).

His siblings included Montague Guest, a Liberal politician, Arthur Edward Guest, a Conservative politician, Charlotte Maria Guest, Mary Enid Evelyn Guest, who married Austen Henry Layard, and Blanche Guest, who married Edward Ponsonby, 8th Earl of Bessborough.

Guest was educated at Harrow School in Middlesex, and he went on to gain a Master of Arts degree in 1856 from Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Titles==
Following his father&#x27;s death in 1852, Guest succeeded to his father&#x27;s baronetcy. In 1880, he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Wimborne, of Canford Magna in the County of Dorset, on Disraeli&#x27;s initiative.

==Career==
Guest was commissioned a cornet in the Dorsetshire Yeomanry on 20 April 1858 and was promoted to lieutenant on 11 March 1867.

He held the office of High Sheriff of Glamorgan in 1862 and was the mayor of Poole from 1896 to 1897. In 1879, he rebuilt the real tennis court at Canford. He was lampooned in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; as &quot;the paying Guest&quot;.

From 1874 on, he stood unsuccessfully for election to the House of Commons as a Conservative, contesting Glamorganshire at the 1874 general election, Poole at a by-election in May 1874, and Bristol at a by-election in 1878 and at the 1880 general election. However, following the tariff reform by Chamberlain, he seceded from the Conservative party and sat in the House of Lords as a Liberal.

He was President of the Dean Close Memorial School from 1902, and a Deputy Lieutenant of Dorset.

==Marriage and issue==
On 25 May 1868, Guest married Lady Cornelia Henrietta Maria Spencer-Churchill (1847–1927). She was the daughter of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, thus making Guest an uncle-by-marriage of Winston Churchill, later the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

Their children included the following:
*Frances Guest (1869–1957), later known as Lady Chelmsford, who married Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford, who served as Viceroy of India.
*Ivor Churchill Guest (1873–1939), who married the Hon. Alice Grosvenor (1880–1948).
*Christian Henry Charles Guest (1874–1957), who married the Hon. Frances Lyttelton (1885–1918).
*Frederick &quot;Freddie&quot; Edward Guest (1875–1937), who married Amy Phipps (1873–1959), daughter of American industrialist Henry Phipps.
*Lionel George William Guest (1880–1935), who married Flora Bigelow (former wife of Charles S. Dodge), daughter of U.S. Ambassador John Bigelow. 
*Oscar Montague Guest (1888–1958), who married Kathleen Paterson (b. 1903).

His wife Cornelia, helped oversee the philanthropic project of building estate cottages to improve the living conditions of workers in Dorset. Although begun by his mother, Charlotte Guest, Cornelia was responsible for the building of the majority, which as a result are known as &#x27;Lady Wimborne Cottages&#x27; after her role. 

He died on 22 February 1914 at Canford Manor in Dorset and was succeeded by his eldest son, Ivor Churchill Guest, 2nd Baron Wimborne, 1st Baron Ashby St Ledgers, who was later created Viscount Wimborne. His will was proved in April 1914, provisionally at £250,000.

==Residences==
In 1867, Guest bought at auction &quot;Hamilton House&quot;, located at 22 Arlington Street in the St. James&#x27;s district of the City of Westminster in central London, from the widow of William Hamilton, 11th Duke of Hamilton. As the house had traditionally been renamed with the title of each peer who owned it, upon receiving his title in 1880, Guest renamed the house as &quot;Wimborne House&quot;.

Wimborne acquired the Highland sporting estate of Glencarron (Ross-shire) in the 1860s, building a Lodge (Alexander Ross / William Joass, c. 1868). He extended it with Glenuaig Estate, possibly 1871, together comprising 15,000 acres. On the opening of the &quot;Dingwall and Kyle Railway&quot; in 1870, Glencarron Lodge was provided with a private platform.

<text>Grimbledon Down is a comic strip by British cartoonist Bill Tidy. It ran in &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine from 26 March 1970 until 26 March 1994.

==Description==
The strip was set in a fictitious UK government research laboratory, satirising the secret Porton Down chemical and biological warfare establishment. (&quot;New Scientist&quot; wanted &#x27;some straight talking about the scope and purpose of research on Porton Down&#x27;.) Grimbledon Down&#x27;s scientists engaged in all sorts of questionable research, such as the production of &quot;antipornography&quot; – grossly disgusting pornographic films which were intended to turn off the audience&#x27;s sexual drive and thus save the world from catastrophic overpopulation. Another frequent feature was attempts to create or distribute &quot;Nu-Food&quot;, an artificial foodstuff made with processed human waste.

Very little of Grimbledon Down&#x27;s internal organisation was ever revealed, although &quot;BioWar&quot; and &quot;ChemWar&quot; divisions were mentioned from time to time in the characters&#x27; dialogue. The man in charge was a recurring character – Director Treem (no first name given) – a moustachioed dark-haired man in a chalk pinstripe business suit. Treem was apparently not a scientist, as the scientists were drawn wearing white lab coats, but he once described himself as a former potential Nobel Prize candidate, was scientifically literate, and often got into detailed technical discussions with his staff.

<text>Moriz Rosenthal (17 December 18623 September 1946) was a Polish pianist and composer. He was an outstanding pupil of Franz Liszt and a friend and colleague of some of the greatest musicians of his age, including Johannes Brahms, Johann Strauss, Anton Rubinstein, Hans von Bülow, Camille Saint-Saëns, Jules Massenet and Isaac Albéniz.

==Biography==
Rosenthal was born in Lemberg, Austrian Empire into a Jewish family, where his father was professor at the chief academy. At eight years of age he commenced his piano studies under Galoth (1869–1872).

In 1872, Rosenthal became a pupil of Karol Mikuli, Chopin&#x27;s pupil and editor, who trained him along more academic lines at Lviv Conservatory. At the age of twelve he became a pupil of Rafael Joseffy in Vienna. His debut occurred in Vienna in 1876. He had immediate success and after a tour of Romania he was made Court Pianist of Romania when he was fourteen years of age. From 1878 to 1879 he studied with Liszt at Weimar and Rome. He was associated with the great Hungarian master until 1886, when Liszt died in Bayreuth. Having the conviction that a well-rounded classical education was necessary in his work as an interpreter, he studied at the Staats Gymnasium in Vienna and at the University, where he was a pupil in philosophy under Von Zimmerman and Franz Brentano and in esthetics under Eduard Hanslick. His virtuosity guided by a probing intellect was nonpareil. In 1912 he was made Kammervirtuoso for the Emperor of Austria.

As Liszt&#x27;s pupil, Rosenthal made appearances in St. Petersburg, Paris, and elsewhere. His general education, however, was not neglected, and in 1880 Rosenthal qualified to take the philosophical course at the University of Vienna. Six years later he resumed his career with the piano, achieving brilliant success in Leipzig, and in Boston, where he made his U.S. debut in 1888, and subsequently in England in 1895. He taught at the Curtis Institute of Music from 1926-1928. From 1939, he taught in his own piano school in New York City, where he died in 1946.

Rosenthal recorded around three hours&#x27; worth of music between 1928 and 1942, for Columbia, Edison, Ultraphon, EMI, and RCA Victor. Several of the discs are often regarded as among the finest piano recordings from his time. In addition to 78-rpm records, a number of American Piano Company (Ampico) piano rolls also exist. 

Rosenthal&#x27;s usually malicious wit was legendary. When he heard Vladimir Horowitz blaze through the octave passages of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s First Piano Concerto at his Vienna debut, he remarked: &quot;He is an Octavian, but not Caesar.&quot; In similar vein, after hearing Ignacy Jan Paderewski, whose reputation had preceded him, Rosenthal said: &quot;Yes, he plays well, I suppose, but he&#x27;s no Paderewski&quot;. A colleague once played Rosenthal&#x27;s arrangement of Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Minute Waltz&quot; in thirds at a recital, after which Rosenthal thanked the pianist &quot;for the most enjoyable quarter of an hour of my life&quot;. Towards the end of his life Rosenthal lived at the Great Northern Hotel in New York, which he referred to as &quot;more Northern than Great&quot;.

His pupils included Charles Rosen, Robert Goldsand, and Jorge Bolet. An anthology of Rosenthal&#x27;s autobiographical writings was published as &quot;Moriz Rosenthal: In Word and Music&quot; (ed. Mark Mitchell, Allan Evans. Indiana University Press, 2006), which also contains a CD of representative and unpublished recordings.

<text>Henry Schradieck (29 April 1846 – 25 May 1918) was a German violinist, music pedagogue and composer. He was one of the foremost violin teachers of his day. He wrote a series of etude books for the violin which are still in common use today.

==Biography==
Born in Hamburg, he received his first violin lessons from his father, and made his first public appearance at the age of six. He studied under Hubert Léonard, at Royal Conservatory of Brussels, where he gained first prize. Afterwards he went to Leipzig, where he became a pupil of Ferdinand David. In 1863 he became a soloist at the Reinthaler concerts at Bremen. The following year he went to Moscow as Professor of the violin. In 1868 Schradieck returned to Hamburg, to take up the position of conductor of the Philharmonic Society, vacated by Leopold Auer. After six years he became concertmaster at the Gewandhaus Orchestra in Leipzig, professor at the Leipzig Conservatory, and leader of the theater orchestra.

In need of a complete change, he left Leipzig for Cincinnati, Ohio, where he taught at the College of Music of Cincinnati, and also organized a symphony orchestra. In 1889 he took up his old position at Hamburg, besides teaching at the Hamburg Conservatory. Subsequently he returned to America, becoming a teacher in New York City, and in Philadelphia. He was a member of the Beta chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity at Combs College of Music, initiated in either 1900 or 1906, and was active in the Fraternity&#x27;s New York Alumni Club. In addition to writing pedagogic material for the violin in the way of studies and finger exercises, and earning the reputation of being one of the foremost violin teachers of that day, he also interested himself in matters connected with the making of violins.

Schradieck&#x27;s notable students include Maud Powell, Ottokar Nováček, Walter B. Rogers, Max Donner, Norman Black, and Theodore Spiering.

<text>Porton Down is a science and defence technology campus in Wiltshire, England, just north-east of the village of Porton, near Salisbury. It is home to two British government facilities: a site of the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory – known for over 100 years as one of the UK&#x27;s most secretive and controversial military research facilities, occupying – and a site of the UK Health Security Agency. Since 2018, part of the campus has housed Porton Science Park, which is owned and operated by Wiltshire Council and has private sector companies in the health, life science and defence and security sectors.
==Location==
Porton Down is just north-east of the village of Porton, near Salisbury, in Wiltshire, England. To the north-west lies the MoD Boscombe Down airfield operated by Qinetiq. On some maps, the land surrounding the complex is identified as a &quot;Danger Area&quot;.

==History of government use==
Porton Down opened in 1916 as the War Department Experimental Station, shortly thereafter renamed the Royal Engineers Experimental Station, for testing chemical weapons in response to German use of this means of war in 1915. The laboratory&#x27;s remit was to conduct research and development regarding chemical weapons agents used by the British armed forces in the First World War, such as chlorine, mustard gas, and phosgene.

Work at Porton started in March 1916. At the time, only a few cottages and farm buildings were scattered on the downs at Porton and Idmiston. By May 1917, the focus for anti-gas defence and respirator development had moved from London to Porton Down, and by 1918, the original two huts had become a large hutted camp with 50 officers and 1,100 other ranks. After the Armistice in 1918, Porton Down was reduced to a skeleton staff.

=== Post First World War ===

In 1919, the War Office set up the Holland Committee to consider the future of chemical warfare and defence. By 1920, the Cabinet agreed to the committee&#x27;s recommendation that work would continue at Porton Down. From that date a slow permanent building programme began, coupled with the gradual recruitment of civilian scientists. By 1922, there were 380 servicemen, 23 scientific and technical civil servants, and 25 &quot;civilian subordinates&quot;. In 1923 the newly formed Silver Star Motor Services started a bus service to link Salisbury and Porton Down. By 1925, the civilian staff had doubled.

By 1926, the chemical defence aspects of Air Raid Precautions (ARP) for the civilian population was added to the Station&#x27;s responsibilities. In 1929 the Royal Engineers Experimental Station became the Chemical Warfare Experimental Station (CWES) (1929–1930), and in 1930 the Chemical Defence Experimental Station (CDES) (1930–1948). In 1930, Britain ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol with reservations, which permitted the use of chemical warfare agents only in retaliation. By 1938, the international situation was such that the Cabinet authorised offensive chemical warfare research and development and the production of war reserve stocks of chemical warfare agents by the chemical industry. This included conducting chemical warfare trials, known as the Rawalpindi experiments, on servicemen in the British Indian Army to test the effects of mustard gas.

=== Second World War ===
During the Second World War, research at CDES concentrated on chemical weapons such as nitrogen mustard. As Allied armies penetrated Germany, they discovered operational stockpiles of munitions and weapons that contained new chemical warfare agents, including highly toxic organophosphorous nerve agents such as sarin, unknown to Britain and the Allies at the time.

To examine biological weapons, a highly secret separate department, called the Biology Department, Porton (BDP), was established within CDES in 1940, under veteran microbiologist Paul Fildes. Its focus included anthrax and botulinum toxin, and in 1942 it infamously carried out tests of an anthrax bio-weapon at Gruinard Island. In 1946, it was renamed the Microbiological Research Department (MRD) and, in 1957, the Microbiological Research Establishment (MRE).

The Common Cold Unit (CCU) was sometimes confused with the MRE, with which it occasionally collaborated but was not officially connected. The CCU was at Harvard Hospital, Harnham Down, on the west side of Salisbury.

=== Post-war period ===

When the Second World War ended, the advanced state of German technology regarding organophosphorus nerve agents such as tabun, sarin and soman, had surprised the Allies, who were eager to capitalise on it. Subsequent research took the newly discovered German nerve agents as a starting point, and eventually VX nerve agent was developed at Porton Down in 1952.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, research and development at Porton Down was aimed at providing Britain with the means to arm itself with a modern nerve agent-based capability and to develop specific means of defence against these agents. In the end these aims came to nothing on the offensive side because of the decision to abandon any sort of British chemical warfare capability in favour of nuclear weapons. On the defensive side there were years of difficult work to develop the means of prophylaxis, therapy, rapid detection and identification, decontamination, and more effective protection of the body against nerve agents, capable of exerting effects through the skin, the eyes and respiratory tract.

Tests were carried out on servicemen to determine the effects of nerve agents on human subjects, with one recorded death due to a nerve gas experiment. There have been persistent allegations of unethical human experimentation at Porton Down, such as those relating to the death of Leading Aircraftman Ronald Maddison, aged 20, in 1953. Maddison was taking part in sarin nerve agent toxicity tests; sarin was dripped onto his arm and he died shortly afterwards.

In the 1950s, the station, now renamed the Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment (CDEE), became involved with the development of CS, a riot-control agent, and took an increasing role in trauma and wound ballistics work. Both these facets of Porton Down&#x27;s work had become more important because of the unrest and increasing violence in Northern Ireland.

On 1 August 1962, Geoffrey Bacon, a scientist at the Microbiological Research Establishment, died from an accidental infection of the plague bacterium &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;. In the same month an autoclave exploded, shattering two windows. Both incidents generated considerable media coverage at the time.

In 1970, the senior establishment at Porton Down was renamed the Chemical Defence Establishment (CDE) for the next 21 years. Preoccupation with defence against nerve agents continued, but in the 1970s and 1980s, the Establishment was also concerned with studying reported chemical warfare by Iraq against Iran and against its own Kurdish population.

Porton Down was the laboratory where initial samples of the Ebola virus were sent in 1976 during the first confirmed outbreak of the disease in Africa. The laboratory now contains samples of some of the world&#x27;s most aggressive pathogens, including Ebola, anthrax and the plague, and is leading the UK&#x27;s current research into viral inoculations.

=== 21st century ===

Until 2001, the military installations based at Porton Down were part of the UK government&#x27;s Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). DERA was to be split into two parts: QinetiQ, initially a government-owned company; and, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), created to incorporate the activities of DERA deemed unsuitable for the privatisation planned for QinetiQ; particularly the Porton Down site. 

In 2013, Dstl scientists tested samples from Syria for sarin, which is still manufactured there, to assess soldiers&#x27; equipment.

In April 2018, Porton Down was responsible for analysis of the substance used in the nearby Salisbury poisonings, which was ultimately identified by Dstl as a Novichok nerve agent.

=== Site names ===

The location&#x27;s government use has been split into two separately controlled locations since 1979: the original military establishment under the Ministry of Defence, and the site to the south under the Department of Health, which had been opened in 1951 for the Microbiological Research Establishment, then in 1979 transferred to the Ministry of Health to focus on public health research, with the Defence aspects returning to the then-titled Chemical Defence Establishment.

=== Associated locations ===

==== Sutton Oak, Merseyside ====
A factory in Sutton Oak, St Helens was requisitioned in 1917 by the War Department, renamed HM Factory, Sutton Oak and started producing the chemical warfare agent diphenyl chloroarsine. The site switched to producing Adamsite in 1922. In 1923 the War Office halted the requisition and purchased the site, renaming it the War Office Research Establishment, a.k.a. Chemical Warfare Research Establishment, and later the Chemical Defence Research Establishment Sutton Oak. During the 1920s, the site switched to producing mustard gas products, starting with the HS variant and adding the HT variant in the 1930s, and also filling armaments. After WW2, the site also produced the nerve agent sarin for experimental purposes. The site closed in 1957, with much of the work transferring to Chemical Defence Establishment Nancekuke.

==== RRH Portreath, Cornwall ====
This Royal Air Force site, built in 1940, was renamed Chemical Defence Establishment Nancekuke in July 1949. Manufacture of sarin in a pilot production facility commenced there in the early 1950s, producing about 20 tons from 1954 until 1956. It was intended as a stockpile and production facility for the UK&#x27;s chemical defences during the Cold War, focussed on nerve agents, including small amounts of VX intended mainly for laboratory test purposes and to validate plant designs and optimise chemical processes for potential mass-production; full-scale production of VX agent never took place. In the late 1950s, the chemical weapons production plant was mothballed, but was maintained through the 1960s and 1970s in a state whereby production could easily re-commence if required.

== Non-government use ==
A few small scientific start-ups were allowed to use buildings on the Porton Down campus from the mid-1990s. Tetricus Science Park has housed companies including and GW Pharmaceuticals.

In 2014, an expansion plan was predicted to create 2,000 jobs. Creation of Porton Science Park started in 2016, with £9.5m in funding from Wiltshire Council, the Swindon and Wiltshire Local Enterprise Partnership and the European Regional Development Fund. The first building opened in 2018, with Ploughshare Innovations, Dstl&#x27;s technology transfer company, among the tenants. Further expansion began in 2022.

==Areas of concern==

=== Trials ===

==== Open air ====
In 1942, Gruinard Island was dangerously contaminated with anthrax after a cloud of anthrax spores was released over the island during a trial. In 1981, a team of activists landed on the island and collected soil samples, a bag of which was left at the door at Porton Down. Testing showed that it still contained anthrax spores and in 1986 the Government felt obliged to take necessary steps to successfully decontaminate the island.

Between 1963 and 1975 the MRE carried out trials in Lyme Bay in which live bacteria were sprayed from a ship to be carried ashore by the wind to simulate an anthrax attack. The bacteria sprayed were &quot;Bacillus globigii&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;; these were originally considered to be less dangerous than other bacterial strains, but it was later admitted that the bacteria could adversely affect some vulnerable people. The town of Weymouth lay downwind of the spraying. When the trials became public knowledge in the late 1990s, Dorset County Council, Weymouth and Portland Borough Council and Purbeck District Council demanded a public inquiry to investigate the experiments. The Government refused a Public Inquiry but instead commissioned Professor Brian Spratt, to conduct an Independent Review of the possible adverse health effects. He concluded that individuals with certain chronic conditions may have been affected.

In 1954 the British Government sent biological warfare scientists to the Bahamas to release Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses near an uninhabited island.

Other research showed that, in the Obanaghoro region of southern Nigeria, four British scientific missions dispersed, and assessed the effect of, experimental nerve gases over a fifteen-month period. Historians were unable to determine who did the extremely hazardous work of &quot;hand-charging&quot; weapons containing the nerve agents, while the effects on the local population and the extent of soil contamination are also unknown.

==== Human trials ====
Porton Down has been involved in human testing at various points throughout the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s use of the site. Up to 20,000 people took part in various trials from 1949 up to 1989:
From 1999 until 2006, it was investigated under Operation Antler. In 2002 a first inquest and in May 2004, a second inquest into the death of Ronald Maddison during testing of the nerve agent sarin commenced after his relatives and their supporters had lobbied for many years, which found his death to have been unlawful. The Ministry of Defence challenged the verdict which was upheld and the government settled the case in 2006. In 2006, 500 veterans claimed they suffered from the experiments.

In February 2006, three ex-servicemen were awarded compensation in an out-of-court settlement after they had claimed they were given LSD without their consent during the 1950s.
In 2008, the MoD paid 360 veterans of the tests £3m without admitting liability.

=== Secrecy ===
Most of the work carried out at Porton Down has to date remained secret. Bruce George, Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Defence Select Committee, told BBC News on 20 August 1999 that:
I would not say that the Defence Committee is micro-managing either DERA or Porton Down. We visit it, but, with eleven members of Parliament and five staff covering a labyrinthine department like the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces, it would be quite erroneous of me and misleading for me to say that we know everything that&#x27;s going on in Porton Down. It&#x27;s too big for us to know, and secondly, there are many things happening there that I&#x27;m not even certain Ministers are fully aware of, let alone Parliamentarians.

===Use of animals===
Dstl&#x27;s Porton Down site conducts animal testing. The &quot;three Rs&quot; of &quot;reduce&quot; (the number of animals used), &quot;refine&quot; (animal procedures) and &quot;replace&quot; (animal tests with non-animal tests) are used as the basic code of practice. There has been a decrease in animal experimentation in recent years. Dstl complies with all UK legislation relating to animals. Animals used include mice, guinea pigs, rats, pigs, ferrets, sheep, and non-human primates (believed to be marmosets and rhesus macaque). Publicly released figures are detailed below:

Different departments at Porton Down use animal experiments in different ways. Dstl&#x27;s Biomedical Sciences department is involved with drug evaluation and efficacy testing (toxicology, pharmacology, physiology, behavioural science, human science), trauma and surgery studies, and animal breeding. The Physical Sciences department also uses animals in its &quot;Armour Physics&quot; research.

Like other aspects of research at Porton Down, precise details of animal experiments are generally kept secret. Media reports have suggested they include exposing monkeys to anthrax, draining the blood of pigs and injecting them with &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria, and exposing animals to a variety of lethal, toxic nerve agents. Different animals are used for very different purposes. According to a 2002 report from the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Defence, mice are used mainly to research &quot;the development of vaccines and treatments for microbial and viral infections&quot;, while pigs are used to &quot;develop personal protective equipment to protect against blast injury to the thorax&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
=== Novels ===
An institute similar to Porton Down, the Mordon Microbiological Research Establishment, features in the 1962 novel &quot;The Satan Bug&quot; by Alistair MacLean. 

In Len Deighton&#x27;s Harry Palmer novels, Porton Down features in &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; as a point of material for biowarfare espionage.

Porton Down features in the 1977 novel &quot;The Enemy&quot; by Desmond Bagley, the 2010 mystery novel &quot;Before the Poison&quot; by Peter Robinson, and the 2022 novel &quot;Tick Tock&quot; by Simon Mayo.

=== Movies ===
Porton Down is featured in the 2022 psychological horror film &quot;The Sleep Experiment&quot; directed by John Farrelly. Two detectives begin an investigation into a disastrous secret military experiment where five prisoners were kept awake for thirty days in the facility.

===Television===
Porton Down and activities there during the 1940s and early 1950s were a significant plot point in Episodes One and Two of the second season of ITV&#x27;s mystery series &quot;The Bletchley Circle&quot;. Experiments conducted at Porton Down also appear in the BBC detective drama &quot;Spooks&quot;, including the development of the VX Nerve Agent and other potentially deadly biological weapons.

Porton Down is referenced frequently in the 2020 BBC TV drama &quot;The Salisbury Poisonings&quot;, portraying its role in testing substances linked to the 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal.

Porton Down is referenced frequently in the ITV &quot;Trigger Point&quot; series, as the origin of a military grade explosive compound HMX-319 which is nicknamed &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Explosive&quot;.

===Comics===
&quot;Grimbledon Down&quot; was a comic strip by British cartoonist Bill Tidy, published for many years by &quot;New Scientist&quot;. The strip was set in an ostensibly fictitious UK government research lab, referring to the controversial Porton Down biochemical research facility.

===Music===
&quot;Porton Down&quot; is the name of a song by Peter Hammill. The song &quot;Jeopardy&quot; by Skyclad is about the experiments developed in Porton Down.

<text>Everolimus, sold under the brand name Afinitor among others, is a medication used as an immunosuppressant to prevent rejection of organ transplants and as a targeted therapy in the treatment of renal cell cancer and other tumours.

This compound also has a use in cardiovascular drug-eluting stent technologies to inhibit restenosis.

It is the 40-&quot;O&quot;-(2-hydroxyethyl) derivative of sirolimus and works similarly to sirolimus as an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).

It is marketed by Novartis under the trade names Zortress (US) and Certican (European Union and other countries) in transplantation medicine, and as Afinitor (general tumours) and Votubia (tumours as a result of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)) in oncology.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
Everolimus is approved for various conditions:
* Advanced kidney cancer (US FDA approved in March 2009)
* Prevention of organ rejection after renal transplant(US FDA April 2010)
* Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS) in patients who are not suitable for surgical intervention (US FDA October 2010)
* Progressive or metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors not surgically removable (May 2011)
* Breast cancer in post-menopausal women with advanced hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative type cancer, in conjunction with exemestane (US FDA July 2012)
* Prevention of organ rejection after liver transplant(Feb 2013)
* Progressive, well-differentiated non-functional, neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of gastrointestinal (GI) or lung origin with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease (US FDA February 2016).
* Tuberous sclerosis complex-associated partial-onset seizures for adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. (US FDA April 2018).

==UK National Health Service==

NHS England has been criticised for delays in deciding on a policy for the prescription of everolimus in the treatment of Tuberous Sclerosis. 20 doctors addressed a letter to the board in support of the charity Tuberous Sclerosis Association saying &quot; around 32 patients with critical need, whose doctors believe everolimus treatment is their best or only option, have no hope of access to funding. Most have been waiting many months. Approximately half of these patients are at imminent risk of a catastrophic event (renal bleed or kidney failure) with a high risk of preventable death.&quot; In May 2015 it was reported that Luke Henry and Stephanie Rudwick, the parents of a child suffering from Tuberous Sclerosis were trying to sell their home in Brighton to raise £30,000 to pay for treatment for their daughter Bethany who has tumours on her brain, kidneys and liver and suffers from up to 50 epileptic fits a day.

==Clinical trials==
, Phase III trials are under way in gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lymphoma. The experimental use of everolimus in refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease was reported in 2012.

Interim phase III trial results in 2011, showed that adding Afinitor (everolimus) to exemestane therapy against advanced breast cancer can significantly improve progression-free survival compared with exemestane therapy alone.

A study published in 2012, shows that everolimus sensitivity varies between patients depending on their tumor genomes. A group of patients with advanced metastasic bladder carcinoma treated with everolimus revealed a single patient who had a complete response to everolimus treatment for 26 months. The researchers sequenced the genome of this patient and compared it to different reference genomes and to other patients&#x27; genomes. They found that mutations in TSC1 led to a lengthened duration of response to everolimus and to an increase in the time to cancer recurrence. The mutated TSC1 apparently had made these tumors vulnerable to treatment with everolimus.

A phase IIa randomized, placebo-controlled everolimus clinical trial published in 2014 showed that everolimus improved the response to an influenza vaccine by 20% in healthy elderly volunteers. A phase IIa randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial published in 2018 showed that everolimus in combination with dactolisib decreased the rate of reported infections in an elderly population.

==Mechanism==
Compared with the parent compound rapamycin, everolimus is more water-soluble. Compared to rapamycin, everolimus is more selective for the mTORC1 protein complex, with little impact on the mTORC2 complex. This can lead to a hyper-activation of the kinase AKT via inhibition on the mTORC1 negative feedback loop, while not inhibiting the mTORC2 positive feedback to AKT. This AKT elevation can lead to longer survival in some cell types. Thus, everolimus has important effects on cell growth, cell proliferation and cell survival.

mTORC1 inhibition by everolimus has been shown to normalize tumor blood vessels, to increase tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and to improve adoptive cell transfer therapy.

Additionally, mTORC2 is believed to play an important role in glucose metabolism and the immune system, suggesting that selective inhibition of mTORC1 by drugs such as everolimus could achieve many of the benefits of rapamycin without the associated glucose intolerance and immunosuppression.

TSC1 and TSC2, the genes involved in tuberous sclerosis, act as tumor suppressor genes by regulating mTORC1 activity. Thus, either the loss or inactivation of one of these genes lead to the activation of mTORC1.

Everolimus binds to its protein receptor FKBP12, which directly interacts with mTORC1, inhibiting its downstream signaling. As a consequence, mRNAs that code for proteins implicated in the cell cycle and in the glycolysis process are impaired or altered, and tumor growth is inhibited.

==Adverse reactions==
A trial using 10 mg/day in patients with NETs of GI or lung origin reported &quot;Everolimus was discontinued for adverse reactions in 29% of patients and dose reduction or delay was required in 70% of everolimus-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 42% of everolimus-treated patients and included 3 fatal events (cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and septic shock). The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 30%) were stomatitis, infections, diarrhea, peripheral edema, fatigue and rash. The most common blood abnormalities found (incidence greater than or equal to 50%) were anemia, hypercholesterolemia, lymphopenia, elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) and fasting hyperglycemia.&quot;.

==Role in heart transplantation==
Everolimus may have a role in heart transplantation, as it has been shown to reduce chronic allograft vasculopathy in such transplants. It also may have a similar role to sirolimus in kidney and other transplants.

==Role in liver transplantation==
Although sirolimus had generated fears over use of m-TOR inhibitors in liver transplantation recipients, due to possible early hepatic artery thrombosis and graft loss, use of everolimus in the setting of liver transplantation is promising. Jeng et al., in their study of 43 patients, concluded the safety of everolimus in the early phase after living donor liver transplantation. In their study, no hepatic artery thrombosis or wound infection was noted. Also, a possible role of everolimus in reducing the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation was correlated. A target trough level of 3 ng/mL at 3 months was shown to be beneficial in recipients with pre-transplant renal dysfunction. In their study, 6 of 9 renal failure patients showed significant recovery of renal function, whereas 3 showed further deterioration, one of whom required hemodialysis. A positive impact on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was observed when everolimus was used as primary immunosuppression starting as early as first week after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) surgery.

==Use in vascular stents==
Everolimus is used in drug-eluting coronary stents as an immunosuppressant to prevent restenosis. Abbott Vascular produce an everolimus-eluting stent (EES) called Xience Alpine. It utilizes the Multi-Link Vision cobalt chromium stent platform and Novartis&#x27; everolimus. The product is widely available globally including the US, the European Union, and Asia-Pacific (APAC) countries. Boston Scientific also market EESes, recent offerings being Promus Elite and Synergy.

== Use in aging ==
Inhibition of mTOR, the molecular target of everolimus, extends the lifespan of model organisms including mice, and mTOR inhibition has been suggested as an anti-aging therapy. Everolimus was used in a clinical trial by Novartis, and short-term treatment was shown to enhance the response to the influenza vaccine in the elderly, possible by reversing immunosenescence. Everolimus treatment of mice results in reduced metabolic side effects compared to sirolimus.

<doc id="530398" wikidata="Q7723452" url="?curid=530398" title="The Cloggies">
<text>The Cloggies, an Everyday Saga in the Life of Clog Dancing Folk, is a cartoon strip created by Bill Tidy. It ran in the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; from 1967 to 1981, and later in &quot;The Listener&quot; from 1985 to 1986. 

The strip served as a satire of northern English male culture and focused on a team of men who took part in what the group called Lancashire clog-dancing. This version of clog-dancing involved two teams dancing towards each other in formation, followed by each attempting to cripple their opponents with gracefully executed knee and foot moves. 

The strip has been credited with popularizing the word &quot;cloggies&quot;, a slang term for clog dancers. 

== History ==

=== Publication history ===
&quot;The Cloggies&quot; began as a single standalone cartoon published in the British satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; during 1967, which depicted a group in the midst of a morris dance as an army jeep tries to warn that they should remain still, as they were in a minefield. The cartoon was noticed by &quot;Private Eye&quot; co-founder Richard Ingrams, who believed that it could be expanded into a regular series. Tidy agreed and the strip ran in the magazine until 1981. It was later picked up by the weekly magazine &quot;The Listener&quot;, where it was published from 1985 to 1986. 

The strip was published in two formats, one a single panel cartoon and the other made of multiple panels.

Three retrospective collections of the cartoons were published between 1969 and 1977, with titles &quot;The Cloggies&quot; (1969), &quot;The Cloggies Dance Again&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Cloggies Are Back&quot; (1977). 

=== Influences ===
The strip was sub-titled &quot;an Everyday Saga in the Life of Clog Dancing Folk&quot;, which Tidy intended as a parody of the long-running BBC radio series, &quot;The Archers&quot;, which was subtitled &quot;an Everyday Story of Country Folk&quot;. The strip also lampooned contemporary British sports culture and introduced an entire sub-culture of fictitious dance leagues, a governing body for the sport of clog dancing, and a deeply arcane and complex scoring system.

=== Similarities with &quot;Brass&quot; ===
In 1983 Granada Television began televising &quot;Brass&quot;, a comedy drama that satirized working-class period dramas of the 1970s. Tidy was critical of the series, noting that it bore several similarities to his work, specifically &quot;The Cloggies&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; Tidy mentioned that he was not the first to see the similarities, as he had learned about them after reading a magazine article asking if he was going to pursue legal action.

The strip focused on a team of clogdancers made up of seven men, who were described as undisputed champions of their ‘sport’, usually inflicting severe clog dance-related injuries on their opponents before repairing to the nearest pub. The characters were portrayed as heavy and enthusiastic drinkers. 

The team consisted of:
* Stan Postlethwaite (captain), later ennobled as Lord Stan of Blagdon
* Albert Postlethwaite (second boot, with his false teeth)
* Neville (third boot; trilby and glasses) (or Wilfrid, trilby, glasses and moustache)
* Arnold (fourth boot)
* Ted (fifth boot, with the grey socks)
* Wally (sixth boot, later deceased, replaced by Norman).
* Norman (bearded).

Other local residents included Reginald (&#x27;Reg&#x27;) Thrumper, the &quot;Blagdon Amateur Rapist&quot; and the unnamed &#x27;Blagdon Groper and Nuisance&#x27;.

== Legacy ==
=== Student Drama Festival ===
The 1971/2 National Student Drama Festival in Southampton included a performance of John Milton’s ‘Comus’ by University Hall, Buckland. Their own Cloggies team, closely based on Tidy’s cartoon in both appearance and behaviour, added a rousing finale. 

=== Stage musical ===
A stage musical based on the series, entitled &quot;The Cloggies&quot;, ran at the Theatr Clwyd in Mold, Wales. The production was given a limited run from 24 October until 12 November 1983. &quot;The Cloggies&quot; experienced several issues with special effects and sound during its opening performance, prompting complaints from the audience. The play was later described as a failure by the &quot;Evening Post&quot; in 1995.

Critical reception at the time was negative, with journalists criticizing the musical for its humor. A journalist for &quot;The Chester Chronicle&quot; panned the portrayals of the titular Cloggies while citing Stephen Nallon&#x27;s impression of Margaret Thatcher as a highlight. &quot;The Liverpool Echo&quot;&#x27;s Walter Huntley also reviewed the musical, criticizing it for its poor sound quality and humor.

=== Exhibitions ===
Strips from &quot;The Cloggies&quot;, along with several of Tidy&#x27;s other works, were displayed at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool during 1986.

=== Other works ===
During the 1990s Tidy announced that there was interest in an animated series based on &quot;The Cloggies&quot; and that he had written a few scripts for an unnamed Yorkshire television station. No series was produced.

<text>The Dissociatives were an Australian alternative rock band consisting of Daniel Johns of Silverchair and dance producer and DJ Paul Mac (of Itch-E and Scratch-E), which formed in mid-2003. They were supported by touring members, Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes (both from the Presets), and James Haselwood. Their first single &quot;Somewhere Down the Barrel&quot; (March 2004) peaked at No. 25 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The duo&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Dissociatives&quot; (4 April 2004) reached No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 they won two trophies; Best Cover Art for James Hackett&#x27;s work on &quot;The Dissociatives&quot; and Best Video for Hackett&#x27;s direction of &quot;Somewhere Down the Barrel&quot;.

== 1997-2002: I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s not Rock ==

The Dissociatives&#x27; founders, Daniel Johns of Silverchair and Paul Mac of Itch-E and Scratch-E met in 1997 when Mac remixed Silverchair&#x27;s track, &quot;Freak&quot;. Later that year Mac appeared on-stage with Johns&#x27; group in Sydney as a guest DJ. In the following year Mac contributed keyboards to Silverchair&#x27;s album &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;. In 2000, during their respective bands&#x27; hiatus, Johns and Mac recorded a track at Mac&#x27;s home studio in Blue Mountains. Later Mac travelled to Merewether to help Johns install an eight-track home studio, where they recorded more tracks.

&quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s not Rock&quot; is the self-titled debut extended play of Johns and Mac&#x27;s experimental project of the same name. It was released on 1 December 2000 and contains five tracks written and recorded by Johns and Mac for their own amusement. After the tracks were completed, the duo decided to issue the work. Mac later explained, &quot;When we were making this music we never thought anybody else would ever hear it. It was just stuff we were doing for ourselves. Once it was done though we liked how it had turned out so we started talking about releasing it even though, as the name suggests, it probably isn&#x27;t what people expect from either of us.&quot;

Both Johns and Mac were signed to , which issued, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s not Rock&quot; online. It is the first release by the new label and was co-produced by Johns and Mac. The five tracks were streamed for free from their website, &quot;icantbelieveitsnotrock.com&quot; and were available for paid download. A limited number of CDs were available through Silverchair&#x27;s fan club, the LAS. The group appeared in ABC-TV&#x27;s drama series, &quot;Love Is a Four Letter Word&quot; (2001), as a pub band in &quot;Episode 13&quot; and performed material from the EP.

== 2003–2005: The making of &quot;The Dissociatives&quot; album and hiatus ==

In mid-2003, Johns and Mac formed the Dissociatives as an alternative rock duo, and they issued a self-titled album on 5 April 2004. They recorded basic tracks in London, finishing them off in Sydney and Newcastle. The pair produced all the instrumental tracks and vocals themselves with Johns writing lyrics and recording them in Newcastle. Johns described its music and lyrics in the Australian edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (April 2004): &quot;The music is, for me, a combination of excitement, happiness, rambunctiousness and viciousness, done to whimsy.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;d add with a hint of melancholy, but it&#x27;s more outweighed by joy,&quot; added Mac.

This duo&#x27;s first single &quot;Somewhere Down the Barrel&quot; appeared ahead of the album in March 2004 and peaked at No. 25 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The album reached No. 12 on the related ARIA Albums Chart. &quot;Young Man, Old Man (You Ain&#x27;t Better Than the Rest)&quot;, its second single followed in May, which reached the ARIA top 50. A video album, &quot;Sydney Circa 2004/08&quot;, appeared in October.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 they won two trophies; Best Cover Art for James Hackett&#x27;s work on &quot;The Dissociatives&quot; and Best Video for Hackett&#x27;s direction of &quot;Somewhere Down the Barrel&quot;. The group were also nominated for Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Pop Release and for Johns and Mac&#x27;s work as Producer of the Year. In 2005 their sole nomination was for Best Music DVD for &quot;Sydney Circa 2004/08&quot;.

The pair, in an interview on &quot;Rove Live&quot; in 2004, described the musical journey of the Dissociatives, as &quot;definitely not a side project&quot; and that they plan to release more music in the future. However, the band have been on hiatus since 2005 due to focussing on their main projects (Silverchair, the Presets, Johns&#x27; solo work), and they have not provided plans for future recordings or performances.

<text>&quot;Buchmendel&quot; is a 1929 short story by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig. It tells the tragic story of an eccentric but brilliant book peddler, Jakob Mendel, who spends his days trading in one of Vienna&#x27;s many coffeehouses. With his encyclopaedic mind and devotion to literature, the Poland-born Russian-Jewish immigrant is not only tolerated but liked and admired by both the owner of his local Café Gluck and the cultured Viennese clients with whom he interacts in the pre-war period. In 1915, however, he is falsely accused of collaborating with Austria&#x27;s enemies and is dispatched to a concentration camp. On his return, towards the end of the war, everything has changed. His mind no longer remembers, his eyes can no longer read, the café undergoes new, brittle ownership, and his clientele have disappeared. Jacob Mendel finally dies, destitute, incapacitated and forgotten.

What initially reads as another of the many modest human dramas that Zweig made his speciality, this small tale actually has a far more panoramic subplot, for it is a metaphor of World War I&#x27;s impact on Viennese life and culture. It is also particularly interesting to the historian for understanding the strategies by which postwar writers reimagined prewar Vienna, how they conceptualised the war itself, and how memory and myth deeply influenced their conception of history.

&quot;Buchmendel&quot; was also translated as &quot;&quot;The Old-Book Peddler; A Viennese Tale for Bibliophiles&quot;, published in &quot;The Old-Book Peddler and Other Tales for Bibliophiles&quot;, 1937, translated by Theodore W. Koch, published by Northwestern University, The Charles Deering Library, Evanston, Illinois.

<doc id="530412" wikidata="Q16932539" url="?curid=530412" title="People's Justice Party (UK)">
<text>The People&#x27;s Justice Party (PJP) was a political party in the United Kingdom from 1998 to 2006. It began in 1998 growing out of a protest movement &quot;Justice for Kashmir&quot;, which first gave rise to the &quot;Justice Party&quot; and then the People&#x27;s Justice Party.

The PJP was centered in Birmingham, where it took City Council seats from the long-dominant Labour Party, drawing its support from Birmingham&#x27;s Kashmiri population; there were some 90,000 residents of Azad Kashmiri descent in Birmingham in this period.

==History==
The Party originated in a &quot;Free Riaz and Quayyam Campaign&quot; to obtain the release of two Kashmiri militants (Mohammed Riaz and Quayyam Raja) belonging to the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front. The two were imprisoned in 1984 for their role in the kidnapping and killing of Indian diplomat Ravindra Mhatre in Birmingham. The group was renamed &quot;Justice for Kashmir&quot;, then renamed &quot;People&#x27;s Justice Party.&quot;

On 18 November 2001, the PJP worked with Stop the War Coalition and the loosely organized Islamic Network UK to turn out a large crowd for a rally opposing military response to the 11 September attacks. Success peaked in the 2001 United Kingdom general election, when PJP garnered 13% of the votes in the neighborhoods of Small Heath and Sparkbrook, and held 5 seats on the Birmingham city council.

In July 2002 the PJP suffered a heavy setback when a leading member, Khalid Mahmood (no relationship to MP for Perry Barr, Khalid Mahmood,) left to join the Labour Party. In 2003 the PJP ran as a &quot;single-issue&quot; party demanding that the British government pressure India in support of Muslims in Kashmir.

The party platform was based on an appeal for votes on two fronts: local and international. It promised single-sex schools, changes to housing grants, and improved street lighting beside commitments to campaign for self-determination for Kashmir, the formation of a Palestinian state.

In 2002 the PJP City Council member Mohammed Nazam was accused of taking part in a rowdy demonstration in which eggs were thrown at the visiting Pakistani High Commissioner.

In the wake of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, PJP treasurer Asrar Ahmad complained to the press that &quot;Muslim people&quot; were being blamed for the attacks without &quot;proof.&quot;

The PJP was also active in the anti-war activity at the time of the American-led campaign against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.

The PJP in the Birmingham City Council was led by Shaukat Ali Khan. Ali Khan had earlier been a member of the Labour Party, as had other PJP members. These ex-Labour members formed PJP in response to what they felt was a failure by the Labour government in the UK to deal adequately with ongoing Indian and Pakistani tensions concerning Kashmir, and what they perceived as a failure to improve the lives of the Kashmiri population in Birmingham.

Some people criticised the party for being focused on only one ethnic group to the exclusion of others, although the PJP itself admitted that at least half their votes come from the Birmingham Kashmiri population, it claimed to be a secular organisation.

The PJP lost all of its seats in the 2004 Birmingham City Council election, but following the finding of postal vote fraud in Aston and Bordesley Green, by-elections were held in both the wards in July 2005 with the PJP seeing two of its three candidates—Shaukat Ali Khan and Mohammed Saeed—elected in Bordesley Green.

The party was dissolved in March 2006, with many of its members, including both Councillors, joining the Liberal Democrats. The PJP group leader Shaukat Ali Khan said talks about disbanding the party began when members worked closely with the Liberal Democrats to expose New Labour&#x27;s postal vote fraud in Aston and Bordesley Green.

The founder members were Allah Ditta, Raja Skintaj and Rajasab Ali of Azad Kashmir.

The idea of a new party that appealed to the foreign policy concerns of Muslim voters was replicated by the Respect Party, founded in 2004.

<doc id="530413" wikidata="Q5154160" url="?curid=530413" title="Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act">
<text>The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), also known as the &quot;Digital Telephony Act,&quot; is a United States wiretapping law passed in 1994, during the presidency of Bill Clinton (Pub. L. No. 103-414, 108 Stat. 4279, codified at 47 USC 1001–1010).

CALEA&#x27;s purpose is to enhance the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct lawful interception of communication by requiring that telecommunications carriers and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment modify and design their equipment, facilities, and services to ensure that they have built-in capabilities for targeted surveillance, allowing federal agencies to selectively wiretap any telephone traffic; it has since been extended to cover broadband Internet and VoIP traffic. Some government agencies argue that it covers mass surveillance of communications rather than just tapping specific lines and that not all CALEA-based access requires a warrant.

Journalists and technologists have characterised the CALEA-mandated infrastructure as government backdoors. In 2024, the U.S. government realized that China had been tapping communications in the U.S. using that infrastructure for months, or perhaps longer.

The original reason for adopting CALEA was the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s worry that increasing use of digital telephone exchange switches would make tapping phones at the phone company&#x27;s central office harder and slower to execute, or in some cases impossible. Since the original requirement to add CALEA-compliant interfaces required phone companies to modify or replace hardware and software in their systems, U.S. Congress included funding for a limited time period to cover such network upgrades. CALEA was passed into law on October 25, 1994, and came into force on January 1, 1995.

In the years since CALEA was passed it has been greatly expanded to include all VoIP and broadband Internet traffic. From 2004 to 2007 there was a 62 percent growth in the number of wiretaps performed under CALEAand more than 3,000 percent growth in interception of Internet data such as email.

By 2007, the FBI had spent $39 million on its Digital Collection System Network (DCSNet) system, which collects, stores, indexes, and analyzes communications data.
== Provisions of CALEA ==
In its own words, the purpose of CALEA is:

:&quot;To amend title 18, United States Code, to make clear a telecommunications carrier&#x27;s duty to cooperate in the interception of communications for Law Enforcement purposes, and for other purposes.&quot;

The U.S. Congress passed the CALEA to aid law enforcement in its effort to conduct criminal investigations requiring wiretapping of digital telephone networks. The Act obliges telecommunications companies to make it possible for law enforcement agencies to tap any phone conversations carried out over its networks, as well as making call detail records available. The act stipulates that it must not be possible for a person to detect that his or her conversation is being monitored by the respective government agency.

Common carriers, facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, and providers of interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) serviceall three types of entities are defined to be “telecommunications carriers” and must meet the requirements of CALEA.

The CALEA Implementation Unit at the FBI has clarified that intercepted information is supposed to be sent to Law Enforcement concurrently with its capture.

On March 10, 2004, the United States Department of Justice, FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration filed a &quot;Joint Petition for Expedited Rulemaking&quot; in which they requested certain steps to accelerate CALEA compliance, and to extend the provisions of CALEA to include the ability to perform surveillance of all communications that travel over the Internetsuch as Internet traffic and VoIP.

As a result, the Federal Communications Commission adopted its First Report and Order on the matter concluding that CALEA applies to facilities-based broadband Internet access providers and providers of interconnected (with the public switched telephone network) Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) services.

In May 2006, the FCC adopted a &quot;Second Report and Order&quot;, which clarified and affirmed the First Order:

* The CALEA compliance deadline remains May 14, 2007.
* Carriers are permitted to meet their CALEA obligations through the services of &quot;Trusted Third Parties (TTP)&quot;that is, they can hire outside companies, which meet security requirements outlined in CALEA, to perform all of the required functions.
* Carriers are responsible for CALEA development and implementation costs.

== Technical implementation ==
For Voice and Text messaging, CALEA software in the central office enables wiretap. If a call comes in for a number on the target phone a &quot;conference bridge&quot; is created and the second leg is sent to law enforcement at the place of their choosing. By law this must be outside of the phone company. This prevents law enforcement from being inside the phone company and possibly illegally tapping other phones.

Text messages are also sent to law enforcement.

There are two levels of CALEA wiretapping:

* The first level only allows that the &quot;meta data&quot; about a call be sent. That is the parties to the call, the time of the call and for cell phones, the cell tower being used by the target phone. For text message, the same information is sent but the content is not sent. This level is called &quot;Trap and Trace&quot;.
* The second level of CALEA wiretap, when permitted, actually sends the voice and content of text messages. This is called &quot;Title III&quot; wiretap.
USA telecommunications providers must install new hardware or software, as well as modify old equipment, so that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the ability of a law enforcement agency (LEA) to perform real-time surveillance of any telephone or Internet traffic. Modern voice switches now have this capability built in, yet Internet equipment almost always requires some kind of intelligent deep packet inspection probe to get the job done. In both cases, the intercept function must single out a subscriber named in a warrant for intercept and then immediately send some (headers-only) or all (full content) of the intercepted data to an LEA. The LEA will then process this data with analysis software that is specialized towards criminal investigations.

All traditional voice switches on the U.S. market today have the CALEA intercept feature built in. The IP-based &quot;soft switches&quot; typically do not contain a built-in CALEA intercept feature; and other IP-transport elements (routers, switches, access multiplexers) almost always delegate the CALEA function to elements dedicated to inspecting and intercepting traffic. In such cases, hardware taps or switch/router mirror-ports are employed to deliver copies of all of a network&#x27;s data to dedicated IP probes.

Probes can either send directly to the LEA according to the industry standard delivery formats (c.f. ATIS T1.IAS, T1.678v2, et al.); or they can deliver to an intermediate element called a mediation device, where the mediation device does the formatting and communication of the data to the LEA. A probe that can send the correctly formatted data to the LEA is called a &quot;self-contained&quot; probe.

In order to be compliant, IP-based service providers (broadband, cable, VoIP) must choose either a self-contained probe, or a &quot;dumb&quot; probe component plus a mediation device, or they must implement the delivery of correctly formatted data for a named subscriber on their own.

== Controversy ==
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) warns that:

* CALEA makes US software and hardware less attractive for worldwide consumers.
* CALEA is a reason to move research and development out of the US.
* CALEA-free devices will probably be available in the grey market.

Journalist Marc Zwillinger from the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; explains his concerns with proposed revisions to the CALEA that would require Internet companies to provide law enforcement with a method of gaining access to communication on their networks. Zwillinger warns this new mandatory access could create a dangerous situation for multinational companies not being able to refuse demands from foreign governments. These governments could “threaten financial sanctions, asset seizures, imprisonment of employees and prohibition against a company’s services in their countries.&quot; In addition, the creation of this new mechanism could create an easier way for hackers to gain access to the U.S. government&#x27;s key. Moreover, the U.S. telephone network and the global internet differ in that U.S. telephone carriers “weren’t responsible for decrypting communications unless the carrier possessed the decryption key. In fact, CALEA’s legislative history is full of assurances that the Department of Justice and FBI had no intention to require providers to decrypt communications for which they did not have the key.” Therefore, a revision of the CALEA cannot necessarily secure companies from providing data on their devices during criminal investigations to foreign governments.

== Lawsuits ==
Originally CALEA only granted the ability to wiretap digital telephone networks, but in 2004, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) filed a joint petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to expand their powers to include the ability to monitor VoIP and broadband Internet communicationsso that they could monitor Web traffic as well as phone calls.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed several lawsuits to prevent the FCC from granting these expanded domestic surveillance capabilities.

The FCC&#x27;s First Report and Order, issued in September 2005, ruled that providers of broadband Internet access and interconnected VoIP services are regulable as “telecommunications carriers” under CALEA. That order was affirmed and further clarified by the Second Report and Order, dated May 2006. On May 5, 2006, a group of higher education and library organizations led by the American Council on Education (ACE) challenged that ruling, arguing that CALEA did not apply to them. On June 9, 2006, the D.C. Circuit Court summarily denied the petition without addressing the constitutionality.

<text>A suppressor grid is a wire screen used in a thermionic valve (i.e. vacuum tube) to suppress secondary emission. It is also called the &quot;antidynatron grid&quot;, as it reduces or prevents dynatron oscillations. It is located between the screen grid and the plate electrode (anode). The suppressor grid is used in the pentode vacuum tube, so called because it has five concentric electrodes: cathode, control grid, screen grid, suppressor grid, and plate, and also in other tubes with more grids, such as the hexode. The suppressor grid and pentode tube were invented in 1926 by Gilles Holst and Bernard D. H. Tellegen at Phillips Electronics.

In a vacuum tube, electrons emitted by the heated cathode are attracted to the positively-charged plate and pass through the grids to the plate. When they strike the plate they knock other electrons out of the metal surface. This is called &quot;secondary emission&quot;. In the four-electrode vacuum tube, the tetrode, the second grid, the screen grid, is operated at a positive voltage close to the plate voltage. During portions of the cycle when the plate voltage is below the screen grid voltage, secondary electrons from the plate are attracted to the screen grid and return to the cathode through the screen grid power supply. This flow of electrons away from the plate causes a reduction of plate current when the plate voltage increases, in other words the plate has a negative resistance with respect to the cathode. This can cause distortion in the plate waveform and parasitic oscillations called &quot;dynatron oscillations&quot; in an amplifier. 

In the pentode, to prevent the secondary electrons from reaching the screen grid, a suppressor grid, a coarse screen of wires, is interposed between the screen grid and plate. It is biased at the cathode voltage, often connected to the cathode inside the glass tube. The negative potential of the suppressor with respect to the plate repels the secondary electrons back to the plate. Since it is at the same potential as the cathode, the primary electrons from the cathode have no problem passing through the suppressor grid to the plate. 

In addition to preventing the distortion of plate current, the suppressor grid also increases the electrostatic shielding between the cathode and plate, causing the plate current to be almost independent of plate voltage. This increases the plate output resistance, and the amplification factor of the tube. Pentodes can have amplification factors of 1000 or more.

<text>Carnivàle () is an American television series set in the United States Dust Bowl during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The series, created by Daniel Knauf, ran for two seasons between 2003 and 2005. In tracing the lives of disparate groups of people in a traveling carnival, Knauf&#x27;s story combined a bleak atmosphere with elements of the surreal in portraying struggles between good and evil and between free will and destiny. The show&#x27;s mythology draws upon themes and motifs from traditional Christianity and gnosticism together with Masonic lore, particularly that of the Knights Templar order.

&quot;Carnivàle&quot; was produced by HBO and aired between September 14, 2003, and March 27, 2005. Its creator, Daniel Knauf, also served as executive producer along with Ronald D. Moore and Howard Klein. Jeff Beal composed the original incidental music. Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown starred as Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe, respectively. The show was filmed in Santa Clarita, California, and nearby Southern California locations.

Early reviews praised &quot;Carnivàle&quot; for style and originality but questioned the approach and execution of the story. The first episode set an audience record for an HBO original series and drew durable ratings through the first season. When the series proved unable to sustain these ratings in its second season, it was cancelled. An intended six-season run was thus cut short by four seasons.

In all, 24 episodes of &quot;Carnivàle&quot; were broadcast. In 2004, the series won five Emmys out of fifteen nominations. The show received numerous other nominations and awards between 2004 and 2006.

== Episodes ==
The two seasons of &quot;Carnivàle&quot; take place in the Depression-era Dust Bowl between 1934 and 1935, and consist of two main plotlines that slowly converge. The first involves a young man with strange healing powers named Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl), who joins a traveling carnival when it passes near his home in Milfay, Oklahoma. Soon thereafter, Ben begins having surrealistic dreams and visions, which set him on the trail of a man named Henry Scudder, a drifter who crossed paths with the carnival many years before, and who apparently possessed unusual abilities similar to Ben&#x27;s own.

The second plotline revolves around a Father Coughlin-esque Methodist preacher, Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown), who lives with his sister Iris (Amy Madigan) in California. He shares Ben&#x27;s prophetic dreams and slowly discovers the extent of his own unearthly powers, which include bending human beings to his will and making their sins and greatest evils manifest as terrifying visions. Certain that he is doing God&#x27;s work, Brother Justin fully devotes himself to his religious duties, not realizing that his ultimate nemesis Ben Hawkins and the carnival are inexorably drawing closer.

== Production ==
=== Conception ===

Daniel Knauf conceived the initial script for the show between 1990 and 1992 when he was unsatisfied with his job as a Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter. He had always been interested in carnivals and noted that this subject had rarely been dramatized on film. Knauf&#x27;s experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human strongly informed the story and its treatment of freaks.

Knauf named the intended feature film script &quot;Carnivàle&quot;, using an unusual spelling for a more outlandish look. Knauf had plotted the story&#x27;s broad strokes as well as several plot details from early on and knew the story destination until the final scene. However, the resulting 180-page long script was twice the length of a typical feature film script, and Knauf still felt that it was too short to do his story justice. He therefore shelved the screenplay as a learning experience. In the meantime, Hollywood studios rejected all but one of Knauf&#x27;s other scripts, often for being &quot;too weird.&quot;

In the mid-1990s, Knauf met a few Writers Guild TV writers who encouraged him to revise &quot;Carnivàle&quot; as a TV series. Knauf turned the script&#x27;s first act into a pilot episode, but, having no contacts in the television business, he was forced to shelve the project again and return to his regular job. A few years later, after realizing that his insurance career was not working out, he decided to give his screenwriting efforts a last chance by offering the &quot;Carnivàle&quot; pilot on his website. The script was subsequently forwarded to Howard Klein by Scott Winant, a mutual friend of the two men. After several meetings and conversations, Klein felt confident that &quot;Carnivàle&quot; would make a good episodic television series that could last for many years. Klein brought it to the attention of Chris Albrecht and Carolyn Strauss of HBO, who were immediately receptive. The network deemed Knauf too inexperienced in the television business to give him full control over the budget, and appointed Ronald D. Moore as showrunner. (Knauf replaced Moore after one season when Moore left for the reimagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.)

The pilot episode, which was filmed over a period of 21 days, served as the basis for additional tweaking of intended story lines. Long creative discussions took place among the writers and the network, leading to the postponement of the filming of the second episode for fourteen months. One major change was the addition of extra material for Brother Justin&#x27;s side of the story. Brother Justin was originally conceived as a well-established preacher, and as a recurring character rather than a regular one. However, after perusing the preliminary version of the pilot, Knauf and the producers realized that there was no room for Justin to grow in a television series. Hence, it was decided to make Brother Justin an ordinary Methodist minister in a small town, setting him back in his career by about one or two years. Expanding Brother Justin&#x27;s role opened new possibilities, and his sister Iris was created as a supporting character. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins&#x27; side except for the addition of the cootch (striptease) family; a &quot;Carnivàle&quot; consultant had elated the producers by calling attention to his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s.

=== Format ===
The &quot;Carnivàle&quot; story was originally intended to be a trilogy of &quot;books&quot;, consisting of two seasons each. This plan did not come to fruition, as HBO canceled the show after the first two seasons. Each season consists of twelve episodes.

Airing on HBO benefited &quot;Carnivàle&quot; in several ways. Because HBO does not rely on commercial breaks, &quot;Carnivàle&quot; had the artistic freedom to vary in episode length. Although the episodes averaged a runtime of 54 minutes, the episodes &quot;Insomnia&quot; and &quot;Old Cherry Blossom Road&quot; were 46 minutes and 59 minutes, respectively. HBO budgeted approximately US$4 million for each episode, considerably more than most television series receive.

=== Historical production design ===
&quot;Carnivàle&quot; 1930s&#x27; Dust Bowl setting required significant research and historical consultants to be convincing, which was made possible with HBO&#x27;s strong financial backing. As a result, reviews praised the look and production design of the show as &quot;impeccable&quot;, &quot;spectacular&quot; and as &quot;an absolute visual stunner.&quot; In 2004, &quot;Carnivàle&quot; won four Emmys for art direction, cinematography, costumes, and hairstyling.

To give a sense of the dry and dusty environment of the Dust Bowl, smoke and dirt were constantly blown through tubes onto the set. The actors&#x27; clothes were ragged and drenched in dirt, and &quot;Carnivàle&quot; had approximately 5,000 people costumed in the show&#x27;s first season alone. The creative team listened to 1930s&#x27; music and radio and read old Hollywood magazines to get the period&#x27;s sound, language, and slang right. The art department had an extensive research library of old catalogs, among them an original 1934 Sears Catalog, which were purchased at flea markets and antique stores. The East European background of some characters and Asian themes in Brother Justin&#x27;s story were incorporated into the show. Aside from the show&#x27;s supernatural elements, a historical consultant deemed &quot;Carnivàle&quot; historical accuracy to be excellent regarding the characters&#x27; lives and clothes, their food and accommodations, their cars and all the material culture.

=== Filming locations ===
&quot;Carnivàle&quot; interiors were filmed at Santa Clarita Studios in Santa Clarita, California, while the show&#x27;s many exterior scenes were filmed on Southern California locations. The scenes of fictional California town of Mintern, where the stories about Brother Justin and Iris in Season 1 were based, were shot at Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills. The carnival set itself was moved around the greater Southern California area, to movie ranches and to Lancaster, which were to replicate the states of Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. The permanent filming location of the carnival in Season2 was Big Sky Ranch, which was also used for Brother Justin&#x27;s new home in fictional New Canaan.

=== Opening title sequence ===

&quot;Carnivàle&quot; opening title sequence was created by A52, a visual effects and design company based in Los Angeles, and featured music composed by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman. The opening title sequence won an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Main Title Design&quot; in 2004.

 The production team of A52 had intended to &quot;create a title sequence that grounded viewers in the mid-1930s, but that also allowed people to feel a larger presence of good and evil over all of time.&quot; In early 2003, A52 pitched their idea to &quot;Carnivàle&quot; executives, who felt that the company&#x27;s proposal was the most creative for the series&#x27; concept. The actual production included scanned transparencies of famous pieces of artwork, each scanned transparency being up to 300 MB in size. The resulting images were photoshopped and digitally rendered. A last step involved stock footage clips being compiled and digitally incorporated into the sequence.

The opening title sequence itself begins with a deck of Tarot cards falling into the sand, while the camera moves in and enters one card into a separate world presenting layers of artwork and footage from iconic moments of the American Depression era; the camera then moves back out of a different card and repeats the procedure several times. The sequence ends with the camera shifting from the &quot;Judgement&quot; Tarot card to the &quot;Moon&quot; and the &quot;Sun&quot;, identifying the Devil and God respectively, until the wind blows away all cards and the underlying sand to reveal the &quot;Carnivàle&quot; title artwork.

=== Music ===
&quot;Carnivàle&quot; features instrumental music composed by Jeff Beal, as well as many popular or obscure songs from the 1920s and 1930s, the time when &quot;Carnivàle&quot; story takes place. However, &quot;After the Ball&quot;, which was a major hit in the 1890s, is used to prominent effect at the close of season 1, episode 2.

The main title was written by The Revolution members Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, and was released with selected themes by Jeff Beal on a &quot;Carnivàle&quot; television soundtrack by the record label Varèse Sarabande on December 7, 2004. Beal released tracks of Season2 on his personal website. A complete list of music credits is available on the official HBO website.

Jeff Beal&#x27;s score is primarily acoustic sounding electronics, but mixes themes of bluegrass as well as atmospheric rhythmic sounds. Bigger groups of strings support smaller ensembles of guitars, pianos, violins, cellos, and trumpets. The music sometimes uses ethnic instruments such as banjos, harmonicas, ukuleles, and duduks.

Because HBO does not break individual episodes with commercials, &quot;Carnivàle&quot; music is paced similar to a movie, with character-specific leitmotifs from as early as the first episode. Characters are musically identified by solo instruments chosen for the character&#x27;s ethnic background or nature. Some characters whose connections are only disclosed later in the series have intentionally similar themes.

Different music is consciously used to represent the two different worlds of the story. Brother Justin&#x27;s world features music of constructed orchestral sound with religious music and instruments. On the other hand, the score of the carnival side is more deconstructed and mystical, especially when the carnival travels through the Dust Bowl and remote towns. For carnival scenes taking place in the cootch (striptease) show or in cities, however, contemporary pop music, blues, folk, and ethnic music is played. One of the most defining songs of &quot;Carnivàle&quot; is the 1920s song &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; sung by Ruth Etting, which is used in several episodes to tie characters in the two worlds thematically.

== Cast ==
The plot of &quot;Carnivàle&quot; takes place in the 1930s Dust Bowl and revolves around the slowly converging storylines of a traveling carnival and a Californian preacher. Out of the 17 actors receiving star billing in the first season, 15 were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to 13 main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers are benefited with more flexibility in story decisions. The backgrounds of most characters were fully developed before the filming of &quot;Carnivàle&quot; began but were not part of the show&#x27;s visible structure. The audience therefore only learned more about the characters as a natural aspect in the story.

Season 1&#x27;s first storyline is led by Nick Stahl portraying the protagonist Ben Hawkins, a young Okie farmer who joins a traveling carnival. Michael J. Anderson played Samson, the diminutive manager of the carnival. Tim DeKay portrayed Clayton &quot;Jonesy&quot; Jones, the crippled chief roustabout. Patrick Bauchau acted as the carnival&#x27;s blind mentalist Lodz, while Debra Christofferson played his lover, Lila the Bearded Lady. Diane Salinger portrayed the catatonic fortune teller Apollonia, and Clea DuVall acted as her tarot-card-reading daughter, Sofie. Adrienne Barbeau portrayed the snake charmer Ruthie, with Brian Turk as her son Gabriel, a strongman. John Fleck played Gecko the Lizard Man, and Karyne and Sarah Steben appeared as the conjoined twins Alexandria and Caladonia. The cootch show Dreifuss family was played by Toby Huss and Cynthia Ettinger as Felix &quot;Stumpy&quot; and Rita Sue, and Carla Gallo as their daughter Libby. Amanda Aday portrayed their other daughter, Dora Mae Dreifuss, in a recurring role. John Savage played the mysterious Henry Scudder in several episodes, while Linda Hunt lent her voice to the mysterious Management. The second storyline is led by Clancy Brown portraying the primary antagonist, the Methodist minister Brother Justin Crowe. Amy Madigan played his sister Iris. Robert Knepper supported them as the successful radio host Tommy Dolan later in the first season, while Ralph Waite had a recurring role as Reverend Norman Balthus, Brother Justin&#x27;s mentor. K Callan performed in a recurring role as Eleanor McGill, a parishioner who became devoted to Brother Justin after seeing his power firsthand.

Several cast changes took place in Season 2, some of them planned from the beginning. John Fleck, Karyne Steben and her sister Sarah had made their last appearance in the first season&#x27;s finale, while Patrick Bauchau&#x27;s and Diane Salinger&#x27;s status was reduced to guest-starring. Ralph Waite joined the regular cast. Several new characters were introduced in recurring roles, most notably John Carroll Lynch as the escaped convict Varlyn Stroud and Bree Walker as Sabina the Scorpion Lady.

=== Casting ===
The casting approach for &quot;Carnivàle&quot; was to cast the best available actors and to show the characters&#x27; realness as opposed to depending on freak illusions too much. &quot;Carnivàle&quot; casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O&#x27;Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were willing to make exceptions such as for Adrienne Barbeau as Ruthie.

The script for the pilot episode was the basis for the casting procedure, with little indication where the show went afterwards. This resulted in some preliminary casting disagreements between the creators and producers, especially for leading characters such as Ben, Brother Justin and Sofie. The character of Ben was always intended to be the leading man and hero of the series, yet he was also desired to display a youthful, innocent and anti-hero quality; Nick Stahl had the strongest consensus among the producers. The character of Sofie was originally written as more of an exotic gypsy girl, but Clea DuVall, a movie actor like Stahl, got the part after four auditions. Tim DeKay was cast as Jonesy because the producers felt he best portrayed a &quot;very American-looking&quot; baseball player of that period. One of the few actors who never had any real competition was Michael J. Anderson as Samson, whom Daniel Knauf had wanted as early as the initial meeting.

== Mythology ==

Although almost every &quot;Carnivàle&quot; episode has a distinctive story with a new carnival setting, all episodes are part of an overarching good-versus-evil story that culminates and is resolved only very late in Season 2. The pilot episode begins with a prologue talking of &quot;a creature of light and a creature of darkness&quot; (also known as Avatars) being born &quot;to each generation&quot; preparing for a final battle. &quot;Carnivàle&quot; does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond insinuation, and makes the nature of suggested Avatars a central question. Reviewers believed Ben to be a Creature of Light and Brother Justin a Creature of Darkness.

Other than through the characters, the show&#x27;s good-and-evil theme manifests in the series&#x27; contemporary religion, the Christian military order Knights Templar, tarot divination, and in historical events like the Dust Bowl and humankind&#x27;s first nuclear test. The writers had established a groundwork for story arcs, character biographies and genealogical character links before filming of the seasons began, but many of the intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers. While Ronald D. Moore was confident that &quot;Carnivàle&quot; was one of the most complicated shows on television, Daniel Knauf reassured critics that &quot;Carnivàle&quot; was intended to be a demanding show with a lot of subtext and admitted that &quot;you may not understand everything that goes on but it does make a certain sense&quot;. Knauf provided hints about the show&#x27;s mythological structure to online fandom both during and after the two-season run of &quot;Carnivàle&quot;, and left fans a production summary of &quot;Carnivàle&quot; first season two years after cancellation.

Matt Roush of &quot;TV Guide&quot; called &quot;Carnivàle&quot; &quot;the perfect show for those who thought &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; was too accessible&quot;. &quot;The Australian&quot; said &quot;Carnivàle&quot; &quot;seems to have been conceived in essentially literary terms&quot; which &quot;can sometimes work on the page but is deadly on the large screen, let alone a small one. It&#x27;s almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television.&quot; A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of &quot;Carnivàle&quot; as &quot;too artsy and esoteric&quot; because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding &quot;what the heck was going on, [which] can be a problem for a dramatic television series.&quot; TV Zone however considered &quot;Carnivàle&quot; &quot;a series like no other and [...] the fact that it is so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths.&quot; &quot;Carnivàle&quot; was lauded for bringing &quot;the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life&quot; and for being among the first TV shows to show &quot;unmitigated pain and disappointment&quot;, but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the &quot;slowly unfolding sadness&quot; appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show.

== Cancellation ==
At the time, HBO made their commitments for only one year at a time, a third season would have meant opening up a new two-season book in Daniel Knauf&#x27;s six-year plan, including the introduction of new storylines for current and new characters, and further clarification and elaboration on the show&#x27;s mythology. HBO announced that the show had been cancelled on May 11, 2005. HBO&#x27;s president Chris Albrecht said the network would have considered otherwise if the producers had been willing to lower the price of an episode to US$2 million; but the running costs for the sizable cast, the all-on-location shooting and the number of episodes per season were too enormous for them.

The cancellation resulted in several story plot lines being unfinished, and outraged loyal viewers organized petitions and mailing drives to get the show renewed. This generated more than 50,000 emails to the network in a single weekend. Show creator Daniel Knauf was unconvinced of the success of such measures, but explained that proposed alternatives like selling &quot;Carnivàle&quot; to a competing network or spinning off the story were not possible because of HBO owning &quot;Carnivàle&quot; plot and characters. At the same time, Knauf was hopeful that, given a strong enough fan base, HBO might reconsider the show&#x27;s future and allow the continuation of the show in another medium; but because of the amount of unused story material he still had, Knauf did not favor finishing the &quot;Carnivàle&quot; story with a three-hour movie.

Knauf did not release a detailed run-down of intended future plots to fans, explaining that his stories are a collaboration of writers, directors and actors alike. He and the producers did, however, answer a few basic details about the immediate fate of major characters who were left in near-fatal situations in the final episode of Season 2. Knauf additionally provided in-depth information regarding the underlying fictional laws of nature that the writers had not been able to fully explore in the first two seasons. June 2007 however marked the first time that a comprehensive work of detailed character backgrounds was made public. Following a fundraising auction, Knauf offered fans a so-called &quot;Pitch Document,&quot; a summary of &quot;Carnivàle&quot; first season. This document was originally written in 2002 and 2003 to give the writers and the studio an idea about the series&#x27; intended plot, and answered many of the show&#x27;s mysteries.

== Marketing and merchandise ==

=== Pre-broadcast marketing ===
HBO reportedly invested in &quot;Carnivàle&quot; promotion as much as for any of its primetime series launches. The series&#x27; unconventional and complex narrative made the network deviate from its traditional marketing strategies. Teaser trailers were inserted on CD-ROMs into &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; issues to draw attention to the show&#x27;s visual quality. 30-second TV spots were aired in national syndication, cable and local avails for four weeks before the show&#x27;s premiere instead of the usual seven days. The historical context of &quot;Carnivàle&quot; was deliberately emphasized in the show&#x27;s print art, which depicted the 17-member cast surrounding a carnival truck. This image was accompanied by a tagline of the show&#x27;s good versus evil theme: &quot;Into each generation is born a creature of light and a creature of darkness.&quot; These measures were hoped to be backed up by positive critical reviews. To give ratings an initial boost, HBO placed the premiere of &quot;Carnivàle&quot; directly after the series finale of the successful &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. The series continued to receive extensive online advertisement for almost its entire run.

=== Games ===
Personalized and interactive online games inspired by tarot divination were created for &quot;Carnivàle&quot; internet presence. The official HBO website collaborated with RealNetworks to offer &quot;FATE: The Carnivàle Game&quot;, a downloadable game made available for trial and for purchase.

=== DVDs ===
&quot;Carnivàle: The Complete First Season&quot; was released as a widescreen six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on December 7, 2004, one month before the premiere of the second season. It was distributed by HBO Home Video and contained three audio commentaries and a behind-the-scenes featurette. The outer slipcover of the Region 1 set was made of a thick cardboard to mimic a bound book. The same set was released with less elaborate packaging in Region 2 on March 7, 2005, and in Region 4 on May 11, 2005.

&quot;Carnivàle: The Complete Second Season&quot; was released as a widescreen six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on July 18, 2006, in Region 2 on August 7, 2006, and in Region 4 on October 4, 2006. Each of these releases was distributed by HBO Home Video and contained three audio commentaries, on-stage interviews of the cast and producers, a featurette about the mythology of the series, and four short &quot;Creating the Scene&quot; segments about the concept, inspiration and execution process.

== Reception ==

=== Ratings ===
&quot;Carnivàle&quot; aired on HBO on a Sunday 9:00 pm timeslot during its two-season run between 2003 and 2005. &quot;Milfay&quot;, &quot;Carnivàle&quot; pilot episode, drew 5.3 million viewers for its premiere on September 14, 2003. This marked the best ever debut for an HBO original series at the time, caused in part by the established HBO series &quot;Sex and the City&quot; being &quot;Carnivàle&quot; lead-in. This record was broken on March 21, 2004, by HBO series &quot;Deadwood&quot;, which debuted with 5.8 million viewers as the lead-out of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

Viewership dropped to 3.49 million for &quot;Carnivàle&quot; second episode but remained stable for the remainder of the season. The final episode of season one finished with 3.5 million viewers on November 30, 2003. Season one averaged 3.54 million viewers and a household rating of 2.41.

Viewership for the second-season premiere on January 9, 2005, was down by two-thirds to 1.81 million. The ratings never recovered to their first-season highs, although the season two finale experienced an upswing with 2.40 million viewers on March 27, 2005. Season 2 averaged 1.7 million viewers, not enough to avert an imminent cancellation.

=== Critical reviews ===

Many early reviews gave &quot;Carnivàle&quot; good marks but also said its unique characters and story might prevent it from becoming a huge mainstream audience success. &quot;Daily Variety&quot; TV editor Joseph Adalian predicted that &quot;it will get mostly positive reviews but some people will be put off by the general weirdness of the show.&quot; Phil Gallo of &quot;Variety&quot; described &quot;Carnivàle&quot; as &quot;an absolute visual stunner with compelling freak show characters—but the series unfortunately takes a leisurely approach toward getting to a point,&quot; and Eric Deggans of the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; suggested that &quot;it&#x27;s as if executives at the premium cable network want to see how far they can slow a narrative before viewers start tossing their remotes through the screen&quot;. James Poniewozik of &quot;Time&quot; called the first three episodes &quot;frustrating&quot; as well as &quot;spellbinding.&quot; Amanda Murray of BBC said &quot;With so little revealed, it&#x27;s almost impossible to pass judgment on the show—it&#x27;s hard to tell if this is just good, or going to be great.&quot;

Later reviews were able to judge the series based on full seasons. While the acting, set design, costuming, art direction and cinematography continued to be praised, some reviewers disfavored the writing, especially of Season 1, saying &quot;the plot momentum is often virtually non-existent&quot; or as &quot;sometimes gripping but mostly boring.&quot; Other reviewers pointed out that &quot;Carnivàle&quot; may &quot;demand more from its audience than many are willing to invest. [...] Without paying close attention, it&#x27;s tempting to assume that the show is unnecessarily cryptic and misleading.&quot; &quot;Carnivàle&quot; story was surveyed as long and complex, &quot;and if you don&#x27;t start from the beginning, you&#x27;ll be completely lost.&quot; IGN DVD&#x27;s Matt Casamassina, however, praised the show in two reviews, writing that the &quot;gorgeously surreal&quot; first season &quot;dazzles with unpredictable plot twists and scares&quot;, and the &quot;extraordinary&quot; second season was &quot;better fantasy – better entertainment, period – than any show that dares to call itself a competitor.&quot;

A significant portion of reviews drew parallels between &quot;Carnivàle&quot; and David Lynch&#x27;s 1990s mystery TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, a show in which &quot;Carnivàle&quot; actor Michael J. Anderson had previously appeared. Knauf did not deny a stylistic link and made comparisons to John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. When &quot;Lost&quot; began to receive major critical attention, &quot;Carnivàle&quot; and its type of mythological storytelling were compared to &quot;Lost&quot; story approach in several instances.

Critical opinion remained divided about &quot;Carnivàle&quot; in the years after the show&#x27;s cancellation. Alessandra Stanley of the Australian newspaper &quot;The Age&quot; remembers &quot;Carnivàle&quot; as a &quot;smart, ambitious series that move[s] unusual characters around an unfamiliar setting imaginatively and even with grace, but that never quite quit the surly bonds of serial drama.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;″s Brian Lowry remembers the show as &quot;largely a macabre fantasy&quot; that eventually suffered from &quot;its own bleakness and eccentricities&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; dwelled on &quot;Carnivàle&quot;″s cliffhanger ending in a piece on unanswered TV questions and called the show &quot;a fantastically rich series with a frustratingly dense mythology&quot;.

=== Fandom ===

Like other cult television shows, &quot;Carnivàle&quot; gained a respectable following of dedicated viewers. &quot;Carnivàle&quot; fans referred to themselves as &quot;Carnies&quot; or &quot;Rousties&quot; (roustabouts), terms adopted from the show. &quot;Carnivàle&quot; complexity and subliminal mythology spawned dedicated fansites, although most discussion took place on independent internet forums. Show creator Daniel Knauf actively participated in online fandom and offered story- and mythology-related clues. He also gave insight into reasons for &quot;Carnivàle&quot; cancellation on a messageboard before speaking to the press.

One year after &quot;Carnivàle&quot; cancellation, a major &quot;Carnivàle&quot; convention called CarnyCon 2006 Live! was organized by fans. It took place in Woodland Hills, California on August 21–23, 2006. Many of the show&#x27;s cast and crew attended the event and participated in discussion panels, which were recorded and made available on DVD afterwards.

=== Awards ===

Despite its short two-season run, &quot;Carnivàle&quot; received numerous awards and nominations. The show&#x27;s inaugural season received nominations for seven Emmy Awards in 2004, winning five including &quot;Outstanding Art Direction For A Single-camera Series&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Costumes For A Series&quot; for the pilot episode &quot;Milfay&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Cinematography For A Single-Camera Series&quot; for the episode &quot;Pick A Number&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Hairstyling For A Series&quot; for the episode &quot;After the Ball Is Over&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Main Title Design&quot;. In 2005, the second season received eight further Emmy nominations without a win.

Other awards include but are not limited to:
* Win – Artios Award: &quot;Best Casting for TV, Dramatic Pilot&quot;, 2004
* Win – VES Award: &quot;Outstanding Special Effects in Service to Visual Effects in a Televised Program, Music Video or Commercial&quot;, 2004
* Win – Costume Designers Guild Award: &quot;Excellence in Costume Design for Television – Period/Fantasy&quot;, 2005
* Nominated – two Golden Reel Awards, 2003
* Nominated – two Saturn Awards, 2004
* Nominated – two VES Awards, 2004
* Nominated – Costume Designers Guild Award, 2005

=== International reception and broadcasters ===
HBO president Chris Albrecht said &quot;Carnivàle&quot; was &quot;not a big show for foreign [distribution],&quot; but did not go into more detail. Reviews however indicate that the show&#x27;s cryptic mythology and inaccessibility to the casual viewer were major factors. Nevertheless, &quot;Carnivàle&quot; was sold to several foreign networks and was distributed to HBO channels abroad. The DVD releases of &quot;Carnivàle&quot; extended the availability of the show further.

== Lawsuit ==
On June 9, 2005, a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by Los Angeles writer Jeff Bergquist. He claimed that the creators of &quot;Carnivàle&quot; did not originate the idea for the show, but rather stole it from his unpublished novel &quot;Beulah&quot;, a quirky drama set amid a traveling carnival during the Depression that Bergquist had been working on since the 1980s. Bergquist sought both monetary damages and an injunction preventing HBO from distributing or airing &quot;Carnivàle&quot; any further. HBO and Daniel Knauf denied the claims of copyright infringement as having &quot;absolutely no merit.&quot;

<text>Online poker is the game of poker played over the Internet. It has been partly responsible for a huge increase in the number of poker players worldwide. Christiansen Capital Advisors stated online poker revenues grew from $82.7 million in 2001 to $2.4 billion in 2005, while a survey carried out by DrKW and Global Betting and Gaming Consultants asserted online poker revenues in 2004 were at $1.4 billion. In a testimony before the United States Senate regarding Internet Gaming, Grant Eve, a Certified Public Accountant representing the US Accounting Firm Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants, estimated that one in every four dollars gambled is gambled online.

Traditional (or &quot;brick and mortar&quot;, B&amp;M, live, land-based) venues for playing poker, such as casinos and poker rooms, may be intimidating for novice players and are often located in geographically disparate locations. Also, brick and mortar casinos are reluctant to promote poker because it is difficult for them to profit from it. Though the rake, or time charge, of traditional casinos is often high, the opportunity costs of running a poker room are even higher. Brick and mortar casinos often make much more money by removing poker rooms and adding more slot machines. For example, figures from the Gaming Accounting Firm Joseph Eve estimate that poker accounts for 1% of brick and mortar casino revenues.

Online venues, by contrast, are dramatically cheaper because they have much smaller overhead costs. For example, adding another table does not take up valuable space like it would for a brick and mortar casino. Online poker rooms also allow the players to play for low stakes (as low as 1¢/2¢) and often offer poker freeroll tournaments (where there is no entry fee), attracting beginners and/or less wealthy clientele.

Online venues may be more vulnerable to certain types of fraud, especially collusion between players. However, they have collusion detection abilities that do not exist in brick and mortar casinos. For example, online poker room security employees can look at the hand history of the cards previously played by any player on the site, making patterns of behavior easier to detect than in a casino where colluding players can simply fold their hands without anyone ever knowing the strength of their holding. Online poker rooms also check players&#x27; IP addresses in order to prevent players at the same household or at known open proxy servers from playing on the same tables. Digital device fingerprinting also allows poker sites to recognize and block players who create new accounts in attempts to circumvent prior account bans, restrictions and closures.

== History ==

Free poker online was played as early as the late 1990s in the form of IRC poker. Planet Poker was the first online card room to offer real money games in 1998. The first real money poker game was dealt on January 1, 1998. Author Mike Caro became the &quot;face&quot; of Planet Poker in October 1999.

The major online poker sites offer varying features to entice new players. One common feature is to offer tournaments called satellites by which the winners gain entry to real-life poker tournaments. It was through one such tournament on PokerStars that Chris Moneymaker won his entry to the 2003 World Series of Poker. He went on to win the main event, causing shock in the poker world, and beginning the poker boom. The 2004 World Series featured three times as many players as in 2003. At least four players in the WSOP final table won their entry through an online cardroom. Like Moneymaker, 2004 winner Greg Raymer also won his entry at the PokerStars online cardroom.

In October 2004, Sportingbet, at the time the world&#x27;s largest publicly traded online gaming company (SBT.L), announced the acquisition of ParadisePoker.com, one of the online poker industry&#x27;s first and largest cardrooms. The $340 million acquisition marked the first time an online card room was owned by a public company. Since then, several other card room parent companies have gone public.

In June 2005, PartyGaming, the parent company of the then-largest online cardroom, PartyPoker, went public on the London Stock Exchange, achieving an initial public offering market value in excess of $8 billion. At the time of the IPO, ninety-two percent of Party Gaming&#x27;s income came from poker operations.

In early 2006, PartyGaming moved to acquire EmpirePoker.com from Empire Online. Later in the year, bwin, an Austrian-based online gambling company, acquired PokerRoom.com. Other poker rooms such as PokerStars that were rumored to be exploring initial public offerings have postponed them.

As of March 2008, there are fewer than forty stand-alone cardrooms and poker networks with detectable levels of traffic. There are however more than 600 independent doorways or &#x27;skins&#x27; into the group of network sites. As of January 2009, the majority of online poker traffic occurs on just a few major networks, among them PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and the iPoker Network.

As of February 2010, there are approximately 545 online poker websites. Within the 545 active sites, about two dozen are stand-alone sites (down from 40 in March 2008), while the remaining sites are called “skins” and operate on 21 different shared networks, the largest network being iPoker which has dozens of skins operating on its network. Of all the online poker rooms PokerStars.com is deemed the world&#x27;s largest poker site by number of players on site at any one time. By May 2012 PokerStars.com had increased their market share to more than 56%.

The year 2011 is known as the infamous year of Black Friday, when the U.S Department of Justice seized the domain names of PokerStars, Full Tilt &amp; Absolute Poker, effectively freezing the bankrolls of their player base. Full Tilt was accused by the DoJ of acting as a Ponzi scheme and scamming players out of $300 million. On the other hand, PokerStars paid $1 billion in fines immediately.

In 2014, PokerStars became the largest publicly traded company in the industry of poker when businessman David Baazov initiated a takeover bid costing $4.9 billion.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a massive increase in online poker traffic. The pandemic is believed to have directed both professional and recreational players who normally prefer live poker to online platforms due to the indefinite closure of most casinos and other live gaming venues worldwide, with even many unlicensed venues shutting down. In addition, the sudden dearth of live entertainment options due to the widespread disruption of the sports and entertainment schedules around the world is believed to have resulted in more than the usual number of casual players turning to online poker as an alternative. Many operators reported traffic of double or more the previous volume, depending on the time of day.

==Legality==
From a legal perspective, online poker may differ in some ways from online casino gambling. However, many of the same issues do apply. For a discussion of the legality of online gambling in general, see online gambling.

Online poker is legal and regulated in many countries including several nations in and around the Caribbean Sea, and most notably the United Kingdom.

===United States===
In the United States, the North Dakota House of Representatives passed a bill in February 2005 to legalize and regulate online poker and online poker card room operators in the state. The legislation required that online poker operations would have to physically locate their entire operations in the state. Testifying before the state Senate Judiciary committee, Nigel Payne, CEO of Sportingbet and owner of Paradise Poker, pledged to relocate to the state if the bill became law.

The measure, however, was defeated by the State Senate in March 2005 after the U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter to North Dakota attorney general Wayne Stenehjem stating that online gaming &quot;may&quot; be illegal, and that the pending legislation &quot;might&quot; violate the federal Wire Act. However, many legal experts dispute the DOJ&#x27;s claim.

In response to this and other claims by the DOJ regarding the legality of online poker, many of the major online poker sites stopped advertising their &quot;dot-com&quot; sites in American media. Instead, they created &quot;dot-net&quot; sites that are virtually identical but offer no real money wagering. The sites advertise as poker schools or ways to learn the game for free, and feature words to the effect of &quot;this is not a gambling website.&quot;

On October 13, 2006, President Bush officially signed into law the SAFE Port Act, a bill aimed at enhancing security at U.S. ports. Attached to the Safe Port Act was a provision known as the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA). According to the UIGEA, &quot;unlawful internet gambling&quot; means to place, receive, or otherwise knowingly transmit a bet or wager by means of the internet where such bet is unlawful under any law in the State in which the bet is initiated, received, or otherwise made. Thus, the UIGEA prohibits online gambling sites from performing transactions with American financial institutions. As a result of the bill, several large publicly traded poker gaming sites such as PartyPoker, PacificPoker and bwin closed down their US-facing operations. The UIGEA has had a devastating effect on the stock value of these companies. Some poker sites, such as PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, Absolute Poker, continued to operate and remained open to US players.

Following passage of UIGEA, former U.S. Senator Al D&#x27;Amato joined the Poker Players Alliance (PPA). Part of the PPA&#x27;s mission is to protect and to advocate for the right of poker players to play online. D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s responsibilities include Congressional lobbying. In April 2008, the PPA claimed over 1,000,000 members.

Other grassroots organizations, including the Safe and Secure Internet Gambling Initiative, have formed in opposition to UIGEA, to promote the freedom of individuals to gamble online with the proper safeguards to protect consumers and ensure the integrity of financial transactions.

On November 27, 2009, Department of the Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke announced a six-month delay, until June 1, 2010, for required compliance with the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA). The move blocks regulations to implement the legislation which requires the financial services sector to comply with ambiguous and burdensome rules in an attempt to prevent unlawful Internet gambling transactions.

On July 28, 2010, the House Financial Services Committee passed H.R. 2267 by a vote of 41–22–1. The bill would legalize and regulate online poker in the United States.

In September 2010, the Washington State Supreme Court upheld a law making playing poker online a felony.

On April 15, 2011, in U. S. v. Scheinberg et al. (10 Cr. 336), the Federal Bureau of Investigation temporarily shut down three major poker .com websites of Full Tilt Poker, Poker Stars, and Absolute Poker, and seized several of their bank accounts. A grand jury charged 11 defendants, including the founders of the poker sites, with bank fraud, money laundering, and violating gambling laws. The prosecutors claim the individuals tricked or influenced U.S. banks into receiving profits from online gambling, an act that violated UIGEA. The same day, former Senator D&#x27;Amato released a comment on behalf of the PPA. He asserts that, &quot;Online poker is not a crime and should not be treated as such.&quot; D&#x27;Amato made no comment on the specific charges raised but promised a response once the &quot;full facts become available.&quot; He responded in the Washington Post on April 22. The actions by the Department of Justice were also criticized by gaming law experts, including I. Nelson Rose.

On September 20, 2011, in response to guidance requested by the states of Illinois and New York regarding the sale of lottery tickets online, the Department of Justice issued a memorandum opinion stating that the Wire Act does not prohibit lottery sales over the internet because it deals solely with wagering on sporting contests. While this opinion does not address online poker specifically, the reasoning employed interprets the Wire Act in such a way that its provisions don&#x27;t apply to the game of poker.

On August 21, 2012, a federal judge in New York ruled that poker is not gambling under federal law because it is primarily a game of skill, not chance. The ruling resulted in the dismissal of a federal criminal indictment against a man convicted of conspiring to operate an illegal underground poker club. The judge relied in his decision largely on findings by a defense expert who analyzed Internet poker games.

On April 30, 2013, Nevada became the first U.S. state to allow persons physically located within the state and at least 21 years of age to play poker online for money legally.

In late October, Delaware launched its regulated online gambling market. Controlled by the Delaware Lottery, the state offers online casino games in addition to online poker.

On February 25, 2014, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval and Delaware Governor Jack Markell signed the first interstate poker compact, an agreement that will allow online poker players from Nevada to play for real money against players located in Delaware. The compact is limited to online poker only, as that is the only game currently permitted under Nevada law. Should more states enter into the agreement, something that is provided for under the terms of the compact, more games could be offered.

Following an agreement between Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey governments to allow player pooling between all three states, a three-state online poker compact went live on May 1, 2018. On April 7, 2022, Michigan joined the interstate poker compact as the fourth state.

===Australia===
In Australia the Interactive Gambling Act was signed into law in 2001. The act makes it illegal for online poker providers to operate or advertise their services in Australia. The intention of the act was to entirely prohibit online poker, but the act itself only forbids operators based in Australia from providing their service. It did not prohibit citizens from accessing the online poker services of providers that were based overseas.

The Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill was passed in 2017 in response to the failings of the 2001 Interactive Gambling Act. This provided a significant improvement towards ensuring consumer protection and responsible gaming in Australian citizens. This latest bill successfully forced the major poker companies to stop offering their services to Australian citizens.

Although there are certain provisions in the law which allow licensed establishments to provide online poker services, there is no agency set up to issue any of such required licenses.

==Profit model==
Typically, online poker rooms generate the bulk of their revenue via four methods. First, there is the rake. Similar to the vig paid to a bookie, the rake is a fee paid to the house for hosting the game. Rake is collected from most real money ring game pots. The rake is normally calculated as a percentage of the pot based on a sliding scale and capped at some maximum fee. Each online poker room determines its own rake structure. Since the expenses for running an online poker table are smaller than those for running a live poker table, rake in most online poker rooms is much smaller than its brick and mortar counterpart.

Second, hands played in pre-scheduled multi-table and impromptu sit-and-go tournaments are not raked, but rather an entry fee around five to ten percent of the tournament buy-in is added to the entry cost of the tournament. These two are usually specified in the tournament details as, e.g., $20+$2 ($20 represents the buy-in that goes into the prize pool and $2 represents the entry fee, de facto rake). Unlike real casino tournaments, online tournaments do not deduct dealer tips and other expenses from the prize pool.

Third, some online poker sites also offer side games like blackjack, roulettes, or side bets on poker hands where the player plays against &quot;the house&quot; for real money. The odds are in the house&#x27;s favor in these games, thus producing a profit for the house. Some sites go as far as getting affiliated with online casinos, or even integrating them into the poker room software.

Fourth, like almost all institutions that hold money, online poker sites invest the money that players deposit. Regulations in most jurisdictions exist in an effort to limit the sort of risks sites can take with their clients&#x27; money. However, since the sites do not have to pay interest on players&#x27; bankrolls even low-risk investments can be a significant source of revenue.

==Integrity and fairness==
===Randomness of the shuffle===
Many critics question whether the operators of such games – especially those located in jurisdictions separate from most of their players – might be engaging in fraud themselves.

Internet discussion forums are rife with allegations of non-random card dealing, possibly to favour house-employed players or &quot;bots&quot; (poker-playing software disguised as a human opponent), or to give multiple players good hands thus increasing the bets and the rake, or simply to prevent new players from losing so quickly that they become discouraged. However, despite anecdotal evidence to support such claims, others argue that the rake is sufficiently large that such abuses would be unnecessary and foolish. Attempts at manipulative dealing could face a risk of third party detection due to increasingly sophisticated tracking software that could be used to detect any number of unusual patterns, though such analyses are not generally available in the public domain.

Many players claim to see many &quot;bad beats&quot; with large hands pitted against others all too often at a rate that seems to be a lot more common than in live games. However, this could be caused by the higher hands per hour at on-line cardrooms. Since online players get to see more hands, their likelihood of seeing more improbable bad beats or randomly large pots is similarly increased.

Many online poker sites are certified by major auditing firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers to review the fairness of the random number generator, shuffle, and payouts for some sites.

===Insider cheating===
Insider cheating occurs when a person with trusted access to the system (e.g. an employee of the poker room) uses their position to play poker themselves with an unfair advantage. This can be done without the knowledge of the site managers.

Perhaps the first known major case came to light in October 2007, when Absolute Poker acknowledged that its integrity had been breached by an employee, who had been able to play at high stakes while viewing his opponents&#x27; hidden &quot;hole&quot; cards. The cheating was first brought to light by the efforts of players, whose saved histories of play showed the employee was playing as only someone who could see their opponents&#x27; cards could.

In 2008, UltimateBet became embroiled in a similar scandal, with former employees accused of using a software backdoor to see opponents&#x27; cards. UltimateBet confirmed the allegations on May 29. The Kahnawake Gaming Commission announced sanctions against UltimateBet as a result.

===Collusion===
More mundane cheating involves collusion between players, or the use of multiple accounts by a single player. Collusion is not limited to online play but can occur in any poker game with three or more players. Most poker rooms claim to actively scan for such activity. For example, in 2007, PokerStars disqualified TheV0id, the winner of the main event of the World Championship of Online Poker for breaching their terms of service.

==Differences from conventional poker==

Online poker and conventional poker have several differences.

One difference is that players do not sit near each other, removing the ability to observe others&#x27; reactions and body language. Instead, online poker players focus on opponents&#x27; betting patterns, reaction times, speed of play, use of check boxes/auto plays, opponents&#x27; fold/flop percentages, chat box, waiting for the big blind, beginners&#x27; tells, and other behavior tells that are not physical in nature. Since poker requires adaptability, successful online players learn to master the new frontiers of their surroundings.

Another less obvious difference is the rate of play. In brick and mortar cardroooms, the dealer has to collect, shuffle, and deal the cards after every hand. Due to this and other delays common in offline casinos, the average rate of play is around thirty hands per hour. Online casinos do not have these delays. Dealing and shuffling are instantaneous, there are no delays relating to counting chips (for a split pot), and on average the play is faster due to &quot;auto-action&quot; buttons (where the player selects their action before their turn). It is not uncommon for an online poker table to average ninety to one hundred hands per hour.

Online poker is cheaper to play than conventional poker. While the rake structures of online poker sites might not differ from those in brick and mortar operations, most of the other incidental expenses entailed by playing in a live room do not exist in online poker. An online poker player can play at home and incur no transportation costs to and from the poker room. Provided the player already has a computer and an Internet connection, there are no up-front equipment costs to get started. There are also considerable incidental expenses at a live poker table. Besides the rake, tipping the dealers, chip runners, servers, and other casino employees is expected, putting a further drain on a player&#x27;s profits. Also, while an online player can enter and leave tables almost as they please, once seated at a live table a player must remain there until they wish to stop playing or else go back to the bottom of the waiting list. Food and beverages at casinos are expensive even compared to other hospitality establishments in the same city, let alone at home, and casino managers have little incentive to provide complimentary food or drink for poker players.

In brick and mortar casinos, the only real way a player can increase their earnings is to increase their limit, likely encountering better opponents in the process. In the online world, players have another option: play more tables. Unlike a traditional casino where it is physically impossible to play at more than one table at a time, most online poker rooms permit this. Depending on the site and the player&#x27;s ability to make speedy decisions, a player might play several tables at the same time, viewing them each in a separate window on the computer display. For example, an average profit around $10 per 100 hands at a low-limit game is generally considered to be good play. In a casino, this would earn a player under $4 an hour. After dealer tips, the &quot;winning&quot; player would probably barely break even before any other incidental expenses. In an online poker room, a player with the same win rate playing a relatively easy pace of four tables at once at a relatively sluggish 60 hands per hour each earns about $24/hour on average. The main restriction limiting the number of tables a player can play is the need to make consistently good decisions within the allotted time at every table, but some online players can effectively play up to eight or more tables at once. This can not only increase winnings but can also help to keep a player&#x27;s income reasonably stable, since instead of staking their entire bankroll on one higher limit table they are splitting their bankroll, wins and losses amongst many lower limit tables, probably also encountering somewhat less skilled opponents in the process.

Another important difference results from the fact that some online poker rooms offer online poker schools that teach the basics and significantly speed up the learning curve for novices. Many online poker rooms also provide free money play so that players may practice these skills in various poker games and limits without the risk of losing real money, and generally offer the hand history of played hands for analysis and discussion using a poker hand converter. People who previously had no way to learn and improve because they had no one to play with now have the ability to learn the game much quicker and gain experience from free-money play.

The limits associated with online poker range down to far lower levels than the table limits at a traditional casino. The marginal cost of opening each online table is so minuscule that on some gambling sites players can find limits as low as $.01–$.02. By comparison, at most brick and mortar establishments the lowest limits are often $1–$2.

Few (if any) online poker sites allow action to be taken &quot;in the dark&quot;, while this is usually allowed and applied by players in real gaming houses. It is also not uncommon for online poker sites to not allow a player the option of showing their hand before folding if they are the giving up the pot to the last remaining bettor. This practice is also typically allowed in casinos.

===Currency issues===
One issue exclusive to online poker is the fact that players come from around the world and deal in a variety of currencies. This is not an issue in live poker where everyone present can be expected to carry the local currency. Most online poker sites operate games exclusively in U.S. dollars, even if they do not accept players based in the United States. There are two methods by which poker sites can cater to players who do not deal with U.S. dollars on a regular basis.

The first method is to hold players&#x27; funds in their native currencies and convert them only when players enter and leave games. The main benefit of this method for players is to ensure that bankrolls are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations against their local currencies while they are not playing. Also, most sites that use this method usually apply the same exchange rate when a player cashes out of a game as when he bought in, ensuring that players do not expend significant sums simply by entering and leaving games.

The other method is to require players to convert their funds when depositing them. However, some sites that use this policy do accept payments in a variety of currencies and convert funds at a lower premium compared to what banks and credit card companies would charge. Others only accept payment in U.S. dollars. One benefit of this method is that a player who constantly &quot;tops up&quot; his chip stack to a constant level (some poker rooms have an optional feature that can perform this function automatically) does not have to worry about rounding issues when topping up with a nominal sum – these could add up over time.

Players may also make use of ewallets, virtual wallets that will allow players to store their funds online in the currency of their choice. Using crypto poker only platforms, like SWC Poker, allows users to deposit and withdraw funds from poker platforms without worrying about further currency conversion and identity checks.

Many online poker sites, particularly those that serve the United States, began adopting cryptocurrencies in 2013 as a means of bypassing the UIGEA. The majority of these poker rooms accept deposits in Bitcoin and then convert them to U.S. dollars, performing this process in reverse when paying out winnings. There also exist cryptocurrency-only operators who denominate their games in Bitcoin or fractions of a bitcoin, avoiding fiat currencies entirely.

===Poker tools===
Various software applications are available for online play. Such tools include hand database programs that save, sort, and recall all hand histories played online. Scanning the active tables for known players and displaying previous statistics from hands with those players next to their name (known as a heads up display or HUD) is a common feature of these programs and is allowed by most sites. Other programs include hand re-players and odds, equity or variance calculators. Some software goes as far as to provide you with quizzes, or scan your previously played hands and flag likely mistakes.

==Bonuses==

Many online poker sites offer incentives to players, especially new depositors, in the form of bonuses. Usually, the bonuses are paid out incrementally as certain amounts are raked by the player. For example, a site may offer a player who deposits $100 a bonus of $50 that awards $5 every time the player rakes $25. To earn the full $50 bonus sum, the player would have to rake $250 in total.

Many online cardrooms also have VIP programs to reward regular players. Poker rooms often offer additional bonuses for players who wish to top-up their accounts. These are known as reload bonuses.

Many online rooms also offer rakeback, and some offer poker propping.

See the online casino article for more on general information on bonuses.

<text>John Stevens Henslow (6 February 1796 – 16 May 1861) was an English Anglican priest, botanist and geologist. He is best remembered as friend and mentor to Charles Darwin.

== Early life ==
Henslow was born at Rochester, Kent, the son of a solicitor John Prentis Henslow, who was the son of John Henslow.

Henslow was educated at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge where he graduated as 16th wrangler in 1818, the year in which Adam Sedgwick became Woodwardian Professor of Geology.

== Early career ==

Henslow graduated in 1818. He already had a passion for natural history from his childhood, which largely influenced his career, and he accompanied Sedgwick in 1819 on a tour in the Isle of Wight where he learned his first lessons in geology. He also studied chemistry under Professor James Cumming and mineralogy under Edward Daniel Clarke. In the autumn of 1819 he made valuable observations on the geology of the Isle of Man (Trans. Geol. Soc., 1821) and in 1820 and 1821 he investigated the geology of parts of Anglesey, the results being printed in the first volume of the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (1822). The Philosophical Society was founded in November 1819 by a group at Cambridge with Professors Farish, Lee, and Sedgwick and Henslow (at that time not yet a professor). The idea and initial impetus for the society originated from Sedgwick and Henslow.

Meanwhile, Henslow had studied mineralogy with considerable zeal, so that on the death of Clarke he was in 1822 appointed professor of mineralogy in the University of Cambridge. Two years later he took holy orders. Botany, however, had claimed much of his attention, and to this science he became more and more attached, so that he gladly resigned the chair of mineralogy in 1827, two years after becoming professor of botany. As a teacher both in the classroom and in the field he was eminently successful. He was a correspondent of John James Audubon who in 1829 named Henslow&#x27;s sparrow (&quot;Centronyx henslowii&quot;) after him.

From 1821 Henslow had begun organising a herbarium of British flora, supplementing his own collecting with a network which expanded over time to include his friends and family, and the botanists William Jackson Hooker and John Hutton Balfour, as well as about 30 of his students. As a mineralogist he had used Haüy&#x27;s laws of crystallography to analyse complex crystals as transformations of &quot;the primitive form of the species&quot; of crystal, and when he moved to botany in 1825 he sought similarly precise laws to group plant varieties into species, often including as varieties plants that respected taxonomists had ranked as separate species. He followed the understanding of the time that species were fixed as created but could vary within limits, and hoped to analyse these limits of variation. By a method he called &quot;collation&quot;, Henslow prepared sheets with several plant specimens, each labelled with the collector, date and place of collection, comparing the specimens to show the variation within the species. His &quot;A Catalogue of British Plants&quot; was first published in October 1829, and became a set book for his lecture course.

Henslow is remembered as friend and mentor to his pupil Charles Darwin, and for inspiring him with a passion for natural history. The two met in 1828. Earlier that year, Darwin joined the course and along with other students helped to collect plants of Cambridgeshire. Henslow became his tutor, and it was not long before he marked out Darwin as a promising student. In 1830 Henslow experimented on varying the conditions of garden grown wild plants to produce various forms of the plant. In 1835 Henslow published &quot;Principles of Descriptive and Physiological Botany&quot; as a textbook based on this lecture course.

In the summer of 1831 Henslow was offered a place as naturalist to sail aboard the survey ship HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; on a two-year voyage to survey South America, but his wife dissuaded him from accepting. Seeing a perfect opportunity for his protégé, Henslow wrote to the ship&#x27;s captain Robert Fitzroy telling him that Darwin was the ideal man to join the expedition team. During the voyage, Darwin corresponded with Henslow, and collected plants with him in mind. In particular, when first arriving at the Galápagos Islands Darwin noted &quot;I certainly recognize S America in Ornithology, would a botanist?&quot;, and went on to collect plant specimens carefully labelled by island and date. He also labelled the mockingbirds he caught, and initially thought these were varieties but while arranging these bird specimens on the last lap of the voyage he began wondering if they could be species, a possibility which would &quot;undermine the stability of Species&quot;. Henslow&#x27;s teaching continued to influence Darwin&#x27;s work on evolution.

Besides Darwin, other famous students of Henslow included Miles Joseph Berkeley, Cardale Babington, Leonard Jenyns, Richard Thomas Lowe and William Hallowes Miller.

== A country clergyman ==
In 1833, Henslow was appointed vicar of Cholsey-cum-Moulsford in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He continued to live in Cambridge, only visiting the parish during vacations; he appointed a curate to conduct services and parish business during term-time.

However, his appointment in 1837 to the remunerative Crown living at Hitcham, Suffolk marked a turning-point in his life. This time, in 1839, he moved to the parish, and as rector of Hitcham he lived at the rectory. He worked there, endearing himself to all who knew him, until the end of his life. His energies were devoted to the improvement of his parishioners, but his influence was felt far and wide. Botany at Cambridge suffered, attendance at lectures fell, and we have records of complaints made within the university. Henslow did not resign his chair, and continued to give lectures, set and mark exams, and take part in university affairs. Nevertheless, his influence there was naturally much reduced.

Henslow&#x27;s work in Hitcham, over and above the normal duties of a Rector, can be summarised as follows:
:1. &quot;The Parish School and other charities&quot;. Hitcham was a poor parish, and most people would have been illiterate. Education had to be paid for, and so Henslow both raised funds and donated his own money to support a school. The school was founded in 1841, and Henslow himself gave a series of volunteer classes on Monday afternoons for some of the older children. The botanical curriculum was printed.&lt;br&gt;The botany taught in this school had effects throughout Britain, because important people at the centre, such as Prince Albert and Lyon Playfair kept in touch and rightly regarded Henslow as an authority on the subject.
:2. &quot;Adult education in the Village&quot;. The Hitcham Labourers&#x27; and Mechanics&#x27; Horticultural Society was the vehicle used by Henslow to &#x27;improve&#x27; the labouring and agricultural workers in the village and its surrounds. Competitions, shows and excursions were the attractions, and the intent was practical, to improve agriculture by educating the parishioners. Henslow made use of gifts and facilities provided by his friends. Advances such as made by Justus von Liebig in Germany, who began to apply chemistry to the needs of agriculture, had not yet become widely utilised.
:3. &quot;Museums&quot;. The town of Ipswich is twelve miles from Hitcham. As a result of his Cambridge experiences, Henslow believed in the value of museums as vehicles for education. Ipswich Museum was established in 1847 as a natural history museum and owed much to Henslow, who was elected its President in 1850.

Alongside this work he remained an inquiring scientist at heart. In 1843 he discovered nodules of coprolitic origin in the Red Crag at Felixstowe in Suffolk, and two years later he called attention to those also in the Cambridge Greensand and remarked that they might be of use in agriculture. Although Henslow derived no benefit, these discoveries led to the establishment of the phosphate industry in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire; and the works proved lucrative until the introduction of foreign phosphates.

In 1851, Carl Ludwig Blume named a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Santalaceae, from Indo-China as &quot;Henslowia&quot;, in honour of Henslow.

Henslow died on 16 May 1861 at Hitcham.

== Family ==

Henslow married Harriet Jenyns (1797–1857), daughter of George Leonard Jenyns and sister of Leonard Jenyns on 16 December 1823. Their eldest daughter Frances Harriet married Joseph Dalton Hooker, and their youngest daughter, Anne, became a botanical artist. Their sons included George Henslow (1835–1925), who became the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Professor of Botany and the first President of the Churchmen&#x27;s Union for the Advancement of Liberal Religious Thought.

<doc id="530424" wikidata="Q4249510" url="?curid=530424" title="Wingham, Ontario">
<text>Wingham (2016 census population 2,934) is a community located in the municipality of North Huron, Ontario, Canada, which is located in Huron County. Wingham became part of North Huron in 2001 when the Ontario government imposed amalgamation on the former township of East Wawanosh, the village of Blyth, and the town of Wingham.

Wingham is located at the intersection of County Roads 4 and 86. Most of Wingham is located between County Road 86 to the south and the Maitland River to the north.

==History==
The original survey for Wingham was conducted in 1854, with 1,000 acres dedicated to the community north of what is now Highway 86 and Highway 4. The initial townsite was oriented around the Maitland River, with the assumption that its water power and transportation opportunities would make it the focal point for development. Indeed, when a basic settlement formed, it was around an early saw and shingle mill. The form of the settlement soon changed, however, when the proposed Canada North-West Railway line was surveyed to the south of the village in 1858. In anticipation of the arrival of the railway, Wingham developed into two distinct areas: an older, &quot;stagnant&quot; Lower Wingham which comprised the initial settlement, as well as a more dynamic Upper Wingham located near the proposed railway line. It would be over a decade until the railway finally did arrive, but in the meantime, the town had developed a number of typical pioneer industries, including a woollen mill, a tannery, and a foundry. An upper dam site was established, where a new flour mill and sawmill were constructed. During the 1860s, the main commercial thoroughfare was Victoria Street. However, the commercial centre of the settlement gradually shifted to Josephine Street by the 1870s, especially after the arrival of the Wellington, Grey and Bruce Railway in 1872.

Indeed, when Wingham was incorporated as a village in 1874, its boundaries only included Upper Wingham, whose population at the time was 726; Lower Wingham, whose population was around 500, remained a part of the Township of Turnberry. The community was incorporated as a town in 1879, and the town hall was constructed and opened in 1890. The community&#x27;s post office was built across the street and opened in 1907. Multiple-unit business buildings were constructed from 1878 to 1892, lining the town&#x27;s main street. The community&#x27;s hospital, serving Wingham and surrounding areas, dates back to 1906.

Well-known products created from Wingham businesses included:
* Hardwood chairs manufactured by Conestoga Chair Company, which opened in 1898
* Wooden doors, constructed by Lloyd-Truax. Doormaking began in Wingham in 1888 by Charles Lloyd
* Milk, processed by Sunrise Dairy, which opened in 1928

By 1910, the town&#x27;s population was 2,500. Furniture manufacturing had become the town&#x27;s primary export industry. This would last through much of the 20th century, with furniture, prefabricated housing, and other skilled woodworking remaining significant. There was a &quot;brief flurry of development&quot; in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1981 the population stood at 2,897. The end of rail freight service to the town spelled the end for much of its woodworking industry, with many of its furniture factories closing following the end of service.

===Railway history===
Wingham has a &quot;complex railway history&quot; as noted in a Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada report. The first railway to arrive was the Wellington, Grey and Bruce Railway (WG&amp;B), by then a subsidiary of the Great Western Railway. The WG&amp;B was initially known as the Canada North-West Railway (CNWR) With work finishing up in 1871 on the WG&amp;B mainline running between Guelph and Southampton, permission was granted for a &quot;Southern Extension&quot; to Kincardine, branching off from the mainline at Palmerston. This branch line would ultimately be routed through Listowel, Brussels, Wingham, Lucknow, and Ripley on its way to Kincardine. This led to the construction of Wingham&#x27;s first railway station in 1872.

The second railway to arrive in Wingham was the London, Huron and Bruce Railway (LH&amp;B) in December 1875. The LH&amp;B was the brainchild of the first reeve of Blyth, Patrick Kelly, who promoted it heavily. It was originally intended for Blyth to be the northern terminus; however, several communities to the north, including Wingham, offered considerable subsidies for an extension, so the line was eventually terminated at a wye junction east of Wingham. The two railways would share the original Wingham station, which functioned as a union station. Terminal facilities were built in the town after the arrival of the LH&amp;B, which included a two-stall enginehouse, a carpenter&#x27;s shop, a snowplow shed, coal facilities, and a bunkhouse.

The third and final railway to arrive was the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). It had taken over the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway, whose abortive Kincardine branch had been terminated in Teeswater in 1874 due to competition from the WG&amp;B. In 1885, the CPR announced that a stagecoach service would connect Wingham with a point on the Teeswater line known as Glenannon (or Glenannan), where a small station was built. In 1887, Canadian Pacific built a spur line to Wingham from a wye connection at Glenannon, giving Wingham a direct CPR connection, along with its second railway station. The arrival of the CPR ignited a competition between it and the Grand Trunk, which renovated its existing station and maintained competitive freight rates to the town. This was followed by the construction of a new, more substantial Grand Trunk station in 1905–06. The Grand Trunk was amalgamated into the Canadian National Railways system in 1923. The former WG&amp;B line became known as the CN Kincardine Subdivision, while the LH&amp;B line became known as the CN Exeter Subdivision.

In 1941, the London, Huron and Bruce line was abandoned north of Clinton Junction on the CN Goderich Subdivision, cutting off Wingham&#x27;s southern connection to London. CN passenger service to the town ended in 1973. This was soon followed by the end of activity on the Canadian Pacific line, which was built with lightweight rail and had suffered washouts in the 1950s; the last CP freight customer, Wingham&#x27;s Premium Forest Products, switched to CN in 1983 after CP built an industrial spur to connect it to CN&#x27;s Kincardine Subdivision. In the same year, CN abandoned the section of its only remaining line from Wingham to Kincardine, leaving Wingham as the terminus. The Canadian Pacific line was finally formally abandoned in 1988, and the CN line was abandoned in 1991, almost 120 years after it had first arrived and transformed the area.

==Business and industry==

Wingham has a number of manufacturing businesses, and a variety of retail and service businesses. Wingham supports two grocery stores, and a main street with retail stores and restaurants. The town has branches of the Bank of Montreal, CIBC, and TD Canada Trust banks, and a branch of Libro Financial Group credit union.

The industries with a presence in the town include:

* Wescast Industries, three manufacturing facilities for this auto-part producer.
* BI-AX International produces plastic film for use in food packaging and industry.
* Royal Homes is a manufacturer of pre-fabricated homes.
* Britespan Building Systems Inc. is a manufacturer of fabric covered steel structure buildings.

==Radio and television==
Wingham was one of the first towns in Ontario to have a community radio station, with W.T. Cruickshank founding CKNX Broadcasting Ltd in 1926.

Wingham has three radio stations: CKNX 920, CKNX-FM 101.7, and Classic Rock 94.5, all owned by Blackburn Radio. There is also a television station CKNX channel 8, owned by CTVglobemedia. It rebroadcasts the master signal of CFPL-TV from London, with the exception of local advertising. CKNX became a rebroadcaster of CFPL London on August 31, 2009.

On April 9, 2007, it was announced that Rogers Communications had filed with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to purchase all of the A-Channel stations, including CFPL, CKNX, CKX-TV, Access Alberta and several cable channels that were for sale by CHUM Limited in the wake of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s acquisition of the CHUM group. CTV said it would not renew the licence for CKNX-TV in Wingham upon expiration at the end of August 2009. On May 1, 2009, Shaw Communications offered to buy the station for $1 from CTV (along with other underperforming stations in Brandon and Windsor), but scuttled the deal two months later. CKNX closed down as a separate station on August 31, 2009. Its transmitter remains in operation as an analogue rebroadcaster of CFPL-DT in London.

Wingham was also served by a CBC English TV station (Channel 45), which re-transmitted CBLT-TV Toronto via CBLN-TV London. This transmitter, along with CBC/Radio-Canada&#x27;s other remaining analog transmitters, was shut down permanently on July 31, 2012, leaving over-the-air viewers in the area with no free CBC television service.

==Education==
Public education is managed by the Avon Maitland District School Board, which oversees the following schools:
* F. E. Madill Secondary School is located in Wingham. Approximately 800 students from grades 7-12 attend; most are bused in from the surrounding area. Madill is known for its Basketball teams and its Track and Field team. 
* Maitland River Elementary School is located in Wingham beside F.E. Madill Secondary School. Approximately 400-500 students attend from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 6.
The former Wingham Public School educated thousands of children on John Street, but was closed in 2013.

Catholic education is managed by the Huron-Perth Catholic District School Board. It has one elementary school, Sacred Heart School, located in the town&#x27;s east end.

==Transportation==
Wingham is located to the north of County Road 86 which connects to Kitchener-Waterloo to the east. The main thoroughfare is County Road 4, called Josephine Street within Wingham, which connects to London, Ontario to the south.

Wingham/Richard W. LeVan Aerodrome is a general aviation airport to the southeast of Wingham with fuel services and private hangars.

Wingham was served by scheduled bus service to London, Owen Sound, and Stratford until 2013, when provider Aboutown entered receivership.

<doc id="530426" wikidata="Q7096759" url="?curid=530426" title="Operation Antler (Porton Down investigation)">
<text>Operation Antler was a 1999 police investigation into experiments conducted on humans at the British government&#x27;s Porton Down research establishment between 1939 and 1989. Several cases were sent to the Crown Prosecution Service but none proceeded to criminal prosecutions. 

In July 1999, the Wiltshire Constabulary opened an investigation into allegations by a former serviceman of malfeasance at Porton Down Chemical and Biological Research Establishment. As a consequence of these preliminary investigations, the scope of the inquiry was broadened into a major inquiry named Operation Antler. 

The inquiries established that a number of the participants in the Service Volunteer Programme claimed to have been tricked into taking part in experiments. Some also claimed to have suffered long-term illness or injury as a result of the experiments. 

The investigation covered the period from 1939 to 1989 and lasted for five years. Its thirteen members interviewed over 700 ex-servicemen or their relatives. The British Government provided the constabulary with an additional £870,000 towards the costs.

At least 20,000 servicemen participated as volunteers in testing at Porton Down, and records survive from 1942 onwards. The Second World War was the peak period for testing, and much of this concerned mustard gas, with as many as 8,000 volunteers being exposed. After 1945, testing shifted to nerve agents, and used around 3,400 volunteers (although they may not all have been exposed). In the 1960s, smaller scale experiments took place with non-lethal agents such as LSD and glycollates, and later testing focused on countermeasures such as pyridostigmine bromide which is a pre-treatment for nerve agents.

The constabulary developed 25 cases for possible prosecution, of which eight were forwarded to the Crown Prosecution Service. Subsequently, the CPS decided that there would be no prosecutions of scientists involved in the tests. The CPS decision was reviewed following the verdict of unlawful killing at the inquest in November 2004 into the death on 6 May 1953 of volunteer Ronald Maddison. In June 2006, the CPS confirmed that there would be no prosecutions.

<text>A balti or bāltī gosht (, ) is a type of curry served in a thin, pressed-steel wok called a &quot;balti bowl&quot;. The name may have come from the metal dish in which the curry is cooked, rather than from any specific ingredient or cooking technique. &quot;Balti&quot; curries are cooked quickly using vegetable oil rather than ghee, over high heat in the manner of a stir-fry, and any meat is used off the bone. This combination differs sharply from a traditional one-pot Indian curry which is simmered slowly all day. &quot;Balti&quot; sauce is based on garlic and onions, with turmeric and &quot;garam masala&quot;, among other spices.

&quot;Balti gosht&quot; is eaten in North India and some parts of Pakistan, as well as other parts of the world, such as Great Britain. The British version of Balti was developed in Birmingham in 1977.

==Origin, history and etymology==

&quot;Balti&quot;, as a food, is named after the steel or iron pot in which it is cooked, similar to a karahi from the same region.
The word is found in Hindustani, Odia, and Bengali, and means &quot;bucket&quot;. The word developed from the Portuguese &quot;balde&quot;, meaning bucket or pail, and traveled to the Indian subcontinent via the Portuguese seafaring enterprises of the early 16th century. The word likely made its way into the English language during the time of British India.

According to Pat Chapman, a food writer, the origins of the word can be traced to the area of Baltistan, in the northern part of the region of Kashmir, where a cast-iron wok, similar to the Chinese wok, is used for cooking. Baltistan shares a border with China. In his &quot;Curry Club Balti Curry Cookbook,&quot; Chapman states: 

However, Colleen Taylor Sen states that the origins of &quot;balti gosht&quot; are unclear, as the food eaten in Baltistan &quot;bears no resemblance&quot; to &quot;balti gosht.&quot; As such, the name of the food may have originated from the fact that &quot; bāltī gosht&quot; is cooked in a pot resembling a &quot;baltī&quot;, the Hindustani word for bucket. 

Another claim regarding the origin of &quot;balti&quot; cooking in Birmingham was that it was first served in 1977 in a restaurant called Adil&#x27;s. At that time, the restaurant was located in Stoney Lane, Sparkbrook, and after some time relocated to another area, but since has returned to its original place in Stoney Lane.

==Balti houses==
&quot;Balti&quot; restaurants are often known in Birmingham as &#x27;balti houses&#x27;. Some balti houses have a plate of glass on the table top with menus secured beneath. Balti houses typically offer large &quot;karack&quot; naan bread pieces, to be shared by the whole table.

Balti houses were originally clustered along and behind the main road between Sparkhill and Moseley, to the south of Birmingham city centre. This area, comprising Ladypool Road, Stoney Lane, and Stratford Road, is still sometimes referred to as the Balti Triangle, and contains a high concentration of &quot;balti&quot; restaurants. On 28 July 2005, a tornado caused extensive damage to buildings in the triangle, forcing many restaurants to close. Most reopened by the beginning of 2006 but by 2023 only four remained.

&quot;Balti&quot; restaurants have now spread beyond the triangle, and can also be found in the south of Birmingham, along the Pershore Rd in Stirchley. Lye near Stourbridge to the west of Birmingham has become known as the &#x27;Balti Mile&#x27; with up to a dozen restaurants clustered along the High Street.

The food and its style of presentation proved very popular during the 1980s, and popularity grew in the 1990s. &quot;Balti&quot; restaurants gradually opened up throughout the West Midlands, and then a large part of Britain. The expanded curry market in Britain is now said to take in 4 billion pounds sterling per year.

Outside Britain, a small number of balti houses are in Ireland and many other English-speaking countries, particularly Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.

Since the late 1990s, British supermarkets have stocked a growing range of prepacked balti meals, and the &quot;balti&quot; restaurant sector has since faced increasing competition from the retail sector and from changes in customer tastes, along with other traditional South Asian and Indian restaurants.

<doc id="530436" wikidata="Q37801" url="?curid=530436" title="Bălți">
<text>Bălți () is a city in Moldova. It is the second-largest city in terms of population, area and economic importance, after Chișinău. The city holds the status of municipiu. Sometimes called &quot;the northern capital&quot;, it is a major industrial, cultural and commercial centre and transportation hub in the north of the country. It is situated north of the capital Chișinău, and is located on the river Răut, a tributary of the Dniester, on a hilly landscape in the Bălți steppe.

==Name==
The word &quot;&quot;bălți&quot; (pl. of Romanian sing. &quot;baltă&quot;&quot;) in direct translation means &quot;puddle&quot;. It is believed that the city had been named thus because it was founded on a hill dominating the wetland formed where the creek Răuțel (&quot;Little Răut&quot;) falls into the river Răut.

In addition to the official name &quot;Bălți&quot; and the Russian name (), between 1940 and 1989 in Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet, and after 1989 in Russian, the name was/is also rendered in Cyrillic as ().

==History and symbols==

===Coat of arms===

The current coat of arms and flag of Bălți, elaborated by Silviu Tabac from the Moldovan State Commission for Heraldry, were adopted by the Municipal Council in April 2006.

A shield, with alternating six silvery strips (symbolizing water), and six blue strips (symbolizing earth), form the background (symbolizing the name of the city). The central element of the shield is an archer in red clothes, in the military outfit (yellow) of Stephen III of Moldavia (Romanian: Ștefan cel Mare) times (15th century). The archer represents the medieval military recruitment, formed by local free peasants.

On top of the shield is a silver crown in the shape of a fortress wall with seven towers. (The crown represents the fact that the locality is a city. Apart from Bălți, only the capital Chișinău, and Tiraspol are allowed to have seven towers, while other cities must limit this number to three or five.) The shield is supported by two rearing silver horses (the white horse is the traditional symbol of the region, which was part of Iași County before 1812). Under the shield, there is a ribbon with the Latin inscription &quot;CEDANT ARMA TOGAE&quot;, meaning &quot;let arms yield to the toga&quot;.

In the Middle Ages, the archer was featured on the coats of arms of the region. In the 19th century, the city and district coats of arms also featured a horse head. In the early 20th century, a shield representing an archer, standing on a hill, the sun, and three bullrush sticks (elements quite sufficient to identify the place where Bălți is situated in the landscape of the north of Moldova) formed the coat of arms of the Bălți county, while these and horse elements - the coat of arms of the city proper.

===Flag===
The city&#x27;s flag is composed of two horizontal strips: a blue one on the bottom, and a silver one on top. The shield and archer elements from the coat of arms are also present in the centre of the flag.

==Geography==
Bălți is situated on the tops and slopes of three hills and in two small valleys. The land in the north of Moldova is very fertile, mostly consisting of black earth or chernozem. Several extraction sites for raw materials used in the construction industry are also found in the vicinity of Bălți. The creeks Răuțel, Copăceanca, and Flămândă cross the territory of the municipality, and flow into the river Răut. Also, several lakes are situated in Bălți: City Lake, Komsolskoe Lake, Hunters and Fishermen Lake, Strâmba Lake.

The municipality covers an area of , of which the city proper , the village Elizaveta (an eastern suburb) , and the village Sadovoe (a north-western suburb) . Of these, an important portion () is agriculturally cultivated.

===Neighbourhoods===
The city itself is located on portions of three hills. The river Răut separates one of the hills to the north-east, the slopes of this hill are occupied by the neighbourhood Slobozia. Răut&#x27;s affluent Răuțel separates another hill in the south, the slopes of which are the Podul Chișinăului. The largest of the three hills dominates the valleys of the creek and river, and contains the city centre and the old town, and the neighbourhoods Pământeni, Dacia, 6th district, 8th district, the city&#x27;s main industrial area, and Molodova neighborhood.

<text>Balti (Perso-Arabic script: , Tibetan script: སྦལ་ཏི།, ) is a Tibetic language natively spoken by the ethnic Balti people in the Baltistan region of Gilgit-Baltistan, Nubra Valley of the Leh district and in the Kargil district of Ladakh, India. The language differs from Standard Tibetan; many sounds of Old Tibetan that were lost in Standard Tibetan are retained in the Balti language. It also has a simple pitch accent system only in multi-syllabic words while Standard Tibetan has a complex and distinct pitch system that includes tone contour. Due to effects of dominant languages in Pakistani media like Urdu, Punjabi and English and religious impact of Arabic and Persian languages, Balti, like other regional languages of Pakistan, is continuously expanding its vocabulary base with loanwords.

==Demographics and distribution==
Balti is spoken in most parts of Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan and Kargil and Nubra Ladakh in India. According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts, the language is mostly found in the Skardu, Shigar, Ghanche, Roundu, and Kharmang parts of Gilgit-Baltistan. In the twin districts of Ladakh region (Kargil and Leh), it is spoken in Kargil city and its surrounding villages like Hardass, Lato, Karkitchhoo, and Balti Bazar, as well as in Turtuk, Bogdang, and Tyakshi, including Leh city and nearby villages. Balti is also spoken by immigrants in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Islamabad, Quetta, and other cities of Pakistan. In India, it is found in Dehradun, Nainital, Ambari, Shimla, Vikasnagar, and other northern cities among speakers who migrated from Baltistan, Kargil, and Nubra before the partition of India and Pakistan.

==Classification and dialects==
Historically, Buddhists in Leh have referred to all Muslims in Ladakh as Balti.

The Balti language has four variants or dialects. Despite differences in pronunciation of vocabulary, they are mutually intelligible. For example, &quot;to keep&quot; is &quot;yuq&quot; in other varieties, but &quot;juq&quot; in the southern dialect of Kharmang and Kargil. Similarly, &quot;milk&quot; is &quot;oma&quot; in the eastern Chorbat-Nubra, the central Khaplu, and the southern Kharmang-Kargil varieties, but &quot;ona&quot; in the western dialect of Skardu, Shigar, and Rondu valley. The four variants or dialects of Balti are:

# Eastern dialect of Chorbat and Nubra valley
# Central dialect of Khaplu valley
# Western dialect of Skardu, Shigar and Rondu.
# Southern dialect of Upper Kharmang and Kargil 

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
*Allophones of include , and .
* can be realized as a flap .
* can also be retroflex .

===Vowels===
* varies between an open back , an open-mid back , and an open central .
* The mid can be as low as open-mid .

==Orthographies==
The predominant writing system currently in use for Balti is the Perso-Arabic script, although there have been attempts to revive the Tibetan script, which was used between the 8th and the 16th centuries. Additionally, there are two, nowadays possibly extinct, indigenous writing systems and there have been proposals for the adoption of Latin script- as well as Devanagari-based orthographies that were adjusted for writing Balti by the Central Institute of Indian Languages in the 1970s.

In 1985, Yusuf Hussain Abadi added four new letters to the Tibetan script and seven new letters to the Perso-Arabic script to adapt both of them to the needs of the Balti language. Two of the four added letters now stand included in the Tibetan Unicode block.

Balti was written with a version of the Tibetan script from 727 AD, when Baltistan was conquered by Tibetans, until the last quarter of the 14th century, when the Baltis converted to Islam. Subsequently, the Perso-Arabic script replaced the Tibetan script, but the former had no letters for seven Balti sounds and was in vogue despite being defective. Adding the seven new letters has now made it a complete script for Balti.

Recently, a number of Balti scholars and social activists have attempted to promote the use of the Tibetan Balti or &quot;Yige&quot; alphabet with the aim of helping to preserve indigenous Balti and Ladakhi culture and ethnic identity. Following a request from this community, the September 2006 Tokyo meeting of ISO/IEC 10646 WG2 agreed to encode two characters invented by Abadi (U+0F6B TIBETAN LETTER KKA and TIBETAN U+0F6C LETTER RRA) in the ISO 10646 and Unicode standards in order to support rendering Urdu loanwords present in modern Balti using the Yige alphabet.

==Evolution==
Since Pakistan gained control of the region in 1948, Urdu words have been introduced into local dialects and languages, including Balti. In modern times, Balti has no native names or vocabulary for dozens of newly invented and introduced things; instead, Urdu and English words are being used in Balti.

Balti has retained many honorific words that are characteristic of Tibetan dialects and many other languages.

Below are a few examples:

==Literature==
Other than proverb collections, no prose literature has been found written in Balti. Some epics and sagas appear in oral literature such as the &quot;Epic of King Gesar&quot; and the stories of &quot;rgya lu cho lo bzang&quot; and &quot;rgya lu sras bu&quot;. All other literature is in verse. Balti literature has adopted numerous Persian styles of verse and vocables which amplify the beauty and melody of its poetry.

Nearly all the languages and dialects of the mountain region in the north of Pakistan such as Pashto, Khowar and Shina are Indo-Aryan or Iranic languages, but Balti is one of the Sino-Tibetan languages. As such, it has nothing in common with neighboring languages except some loanwords absorbed as a result of linguistic contact. Balti and Ladakhi are closely related.

The major issue facing Balti literature is its centuries-long isolation from Tibet and even from its immediate neighbor, Ladakh, due to political divisions and strong religious differences. Separated from its linguistic kin, Balti is under pressure from more dominant languages such as Urdu. This is compounded by the lack of a suitable means of transcription following the abandonment of its original Tibetan script. The Baltis do not have the awareness to revive their original script and there is no institution that could restore it and persuade the people to use it again. Even if the script were revived, it would need modification to express certain Urdu phonemes that occur in common loanwords within Balti.

<doc id="530450" wikidata="Q7730363" url="?curid=530450" title="The Dissociatives (album)">
<text>The Dissociatives is the sole album by the Australian duo of the same name, released in April 2004 by record label Eleven. It peaked at No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Three singles were issued from the album, &quot;Somewhere Down the Barrel&quot; (March 2004), &quot;Young Man, Old Man (You Ain&#x27;t Better Than the Rest)&quot; (May) and &quot;Horror with Eyeballs&quot;. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 they won Best Video for &quot;Somewhere Down the Barrel&quot;, directed by James Hackett and Best Cover Art for the album, also by Hackett.

== Background ==

Daniel Johns (of Silverchair) and Australian dance music producer, Paul Mac, met when Mac remixed Silverchair&#x27;s song &quot;Freak&quot; off the &quot;Freak Show&quot; album. The two worked on an experimental extended play, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Rock&quot;, released in 2000.

== Recording and production ==

In mid-2003 Johns and Mac collaborated to record an album, &quot;The Dissociatives&quot;, starting with basic tracks in London and finishing off in Sydney and Newcastle. The pair provided all the instrumental tracks and vocals themselves with Johns writing the lyrics and recording them in Newcastle.

The duo described the music and lyrics in the April 2004 Australian edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The music is, for me, a combination of excitement, happiness, rambunctiousness and vicaciousness, done to whimsy,&quot; Johns said. &quot;I&#x27;d add with a hint of melancholy, but it&#x27;s more outweighed by joy,&quot; added Mac. The magazine&#x27;s writer described the sound of the debut single, &quot;Somewhere Down the Barrel&quot;, as a &quot;happy sort of Radiohead.&quot;

== Release and reception ==

&quot;The Dissociatives&quot; was released on 4 April 2004, by record label, Eleven. It was fitted with the Copy Control protection system in some regions. &quot;Somewhere Down the Barrel&quot;, their first single, entered the ARIA Singles Chart on debut at No. 25 on 15 March 2004. It was one of the five most played tracks on Australian radio in early March of that year. Given that Silverchair sold more albums in Australia in the 1990s than any other Australian artist, the debut album by the Dissociatives was expected to be one of the best selling ones when it was released on 5 April in that country. It debuted and peaked at No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart.

== Reception ==

&quot;The Dissociatives&quot; has received a generally positive critical reception. A negative review came from Pitchfork, which wrote, &quot;Leftfield techno vet Paul Mac seems stale working away from a club-oriented context, but it&#x27;s Johns who seems out of his depth. Maybe he can write a three-chord rock song, but here he under-sings, over-emotes, and writes melodies that spiral off in insane directions before ending up nowhere&quot;.

<text>PJSC Sberbank (, initially a contraction of ) is a Russian majority state-owned banking and financial services company headquartered in Moscow. As the Russian successor entity of the State Labor Savings Banks System of the USSR, it was called Sberbank of Russia until 2015, and in 2020 further shortened its brand to Sber. Following the termination of its operations in the European Union in the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, its international footprint is primarily in the Commonwealth of Independent States.

By 2022, the bank accounted for about a third of all bank assets in Russia. The bank&#x27;s rise since 1990s is in part due to its close connections to the Russian government. Sberbank has 87 branches and 1 representative office in 79 regions of Russia and 2 foreign countries. it was the largest bank in Russia and Eastern Europe, and the third largest in Europe, ranked 60th in the world and first in central and Eastern Europe in &quot;The Banker&quot;″s Top 1000 World Banks ranking. In the world ranking of public companies &quot;Forbes&quot; &quot;Global 2000&quot; Sberbank takes 51st place.

==History==

===1991–2013===

In 1991, the operations of the State Labor Savings Banks System of the USSR in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic were reorganised into the Joint-Stock Commercial Savings Bank of the Russian Federation (Sberbank of Russia).

In post-Soviet Russia, Sberbank is the largest universal bank despite growing competition from private and other state-owned commercial banks. The bank has gradually expanded its international presence.

Since 2007, Sberbank is led by former economy minister Herman Gref who is a very close friend of Vladimir Putin.

; 2011 Volksbank International acquisition
In 2011, Sberbank acquired Volksbank International AG from its shareholders Österreichische Volksbanken AG, BPCE, DZ Bank and WGZ Bank. The deal included all Volksbank assets – banks in Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Ukraine, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, except for Volksbank Romania. The agreed price was €585 to €645 million, depending on Volksbank business performance in 2011. Volksbank&#x27;s total assets excluding Romania was €9.4 billion in June 2011. On 16 December 2013, Volksbank (Ukraine), which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sberbank, changed its name to ().

; 2012 Denizbank acquisition
In June 2012 Sberbank bought the Turkish DenizBank for Turkish lira 6,469 billion (about EUR 2,821 billion or US$3.504 billion) from the lender Dexia, which in 2011 was &quot;partly nationalized by the governments of France, Belgium and Luxembourg&quot;. The deal included DenizBank subsidiaries in Turkey, Austria and Russia.

===2014–2017 sanctions===
After the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia in 2014, the Obama administration imposed targeted sanctions on 12 September 2014, through the US Department of Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) by adding Sberbank and other entities to the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications (SSI) List. This was done in concert with 31 July 2014 addition of Sberbank to the European Union sanctions list. Sanctions consist of access restriction to the EU and US capital markets. After announcement of the sanctions, and by the end of July, Sberbank&#x27;s market value had dropped the most market value among the world&#x27;s major lenders plus investors moved $22 billion from Sberbank&#x27;s market capitalization. Still, during the following year Sberbank&#x27;s share price grew back 89%. Sberbank together with other Russian banks filed claims with the highest EU court to lift the punitive economic measures.

On 27 August 2014, Switzerland imposed sanctions on Sberbank and other Russian financial institutions.

On 22 December 2015, the United States imposed additional sanctions on Sberbank and its subsidiaries.

On 17 October 2016, Ukraine imposed sanctions against Sberbank Russia, Sberbank Leasing, and their payment systems Kolibri (Hummingbird), formerly Blitz ().

On 15 March 2017, the president of Ukraine imposed sanctions on Sberbank (and other Russian state-owned banks operating in Ukraine: VTB Bank, BM Bank, Prominvestbank, and VS Bank ()) as part of its continued sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and involvement in the war in Donbas.

===2016–2021===
; Credit cards – both issuer and payment
As of May 2016, Sberbank dominated the card payments business in Russia with over 61% of the market. Sberbank&#x27;s competitors in the card business are VTB Bank, Alfa-Bank, Tinkoff Bank, and Gazprombank which combined only had a 29% of the card business market.

; 2017 sale of VS Bank to Tihipko
In December 2017, due to sanctions, Sberbank sold its Ukrainian subsidiary, VS Bank () to Ukrainian businessman Serhiy Tihipko.

===2022–2023 sanctions===
On 24 February 2022, as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, US president Joe Biden announced sanctions against additional Russian individuals and companies, including new restrictions on Sberbank&#x27;s operations, after which Sberbank&#x27;s stock lost more than half of its value.

On 25 February 2022 the banking licence of Sberbank in Ukraine was revoked.

On 28 February 2022, Sberbank Europe was facing bankruptcy as a consequence of the sanctions. Deutsche Börse suspended trading of Sberbank stock. Two days later, Sberbank Europe declared that it was leaving the European market.

Visa and Mastercard suspended their activities in Russia at the beginning of March 2022. Cards of these systems issued by Russian banks no longer worked outside of Russia, and all Visa cards issued outside of Russia no longer work within Russia.

In April 2022, Apple and Google removed Sberbank mobile apps from their stores. The Android application can be downloaded from the bank&#x27;s website, but iPhone users did not have this option. In August, the SBOL application appeared in the App Store. It does not formally belong to Sber, but it fully reproduces the functionality of the removed application. A week later, this app was also removed from App Store. Deputy Chairman of the Board of Sberbank Stanislav Kuznetsov, speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum, spoke about new applications allegedly distributed on behalf of Sberbank. According to him, all new applications on the AppStore hosted by Sberbank have nothing in common with it. Kuznetsov noted that these are programs for fraudsters to remotely access a smartphone to steal passwords and bank card numbers.

In July 2022 the EU imposed sanctions on Sberbank in relation to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sberbank was also sanctioned by New Zealand in 2022.

During 2022 and 2023 many overseas subsidiaries lost their licences, closed, were sold, or went into receivership.

=== 2024 ===
In July 2024, Russian FIT LLC, the developer of the PayQR contactless payment service, filed a lawsuit against Sberbank in the Moscow Arbitration Court. The plaintiff accuses Sberbank of violating exclusive rights to the PayQR design elements. Sberbank uses its own SberPay QR service. The amount of the claim is 2.9 billion rubles (about $333 million). The hearing is scheduled for November 2024.

In July 2024, Sberbank began paying “record” dividends for 2023. One share is worth 33.3 rubles, and the total amount will be 752 billion rubles ($8.5 billion). Half of it will go to the state, and the other half will be distributed among 1.8 million private shareholders.

On August 16, Sberbank disclosed for the first time in three years the amount spent on remuneration of top management and key executives. In total, they were paid 28 billion rubles (over $300 million) for 2023. This amount is distributed among approximately 650 employees.

== Rebranding 2020 and &quot;ecosystem&quot; ==
In 2020, Sberbank undertook a rebranding. In addition to changing the logo and legalizing the reduction &quot;Sber&quot;, the company announced the transformation of the bank into an &quot;ecosystem&quot;. Sberbank decided to become &quot;more than a bank&quot; and began to develop various services, mainly digital: online cinema (Okko), music (SberSound), food delivery (SberMarket), cloud storage (SberDisk), taxi (Citymobil).

Initially, the &quot;ecosystem&quot; was built in partnership with the large Internet holding Mail.ru Group, for which a joint venture O2O (online-to-offline) Holding was created with a capital of about 100 billion rubles. However, in the spring of 2021, the parties decided to end cooperation due to disagreements over management methods and corporate culture.

Another component of the &quot;ecosystem&quot; is pharmacies. Having launched an online service, Sber Eapteka (e-drugstore), Sber soon decided to expand the business and open pharmacies in its own branches. It is assumed that purchases there will be more profitable due to targeted packaging of drugs, as well as the production of its own generics.

In the summer of 2021, Sberbank announced the implementation of the sabbatical practice. Employees are allowed to take unpaid leave of up to a year—with the retention of their jobs (although this required the consent of the immediate supervisor). They are also allowed to work remotely for three months a year.

== Deposits of USSR citizens in the bank ==
After price liberalization in the early 1990s, the state and Sberbank effectively abandoned guarantees to secure citizens&#x27; deposits, as a result of their depreciation, which, according to sociological surveys, caused a sharp dissatisfaction of the population. Since 1996 there has been a phased compensation of depositors&#x27; losses. Since February 16, 2008 Sberbank branches have started to pay compensation on Soviet deposits to certain categories of population.

The law on full compensation of deposits taking into account changes in the real value of the ruble was adopted in 1995, but since 2003 the start of payments has been regularly postponed. In 2019, a law was adopted to postpone the start of payments to 2023 once again. As of 2022, repayment of the entire debt of RUB 345.54 billion in 2023 would require RUB 62.7 trillion (including indexation). In the fall of 2022, the government sent a bill to the State Duma to move the deadline to early 2026.

== Ownership ==
The majority shareholder of Sberbank is the Russian National Wealth Fund managed by the Government of Russia (until 2020 the Central Bank of the Russian Federation), owning 50%+1 voting share of Sberbank&#x27;s voting shares. The rest of the shares are dispersed among portfolio, private and other investors.

Russia&#x27;s central bank cannot sell its stake without a change in Russia&#x27;s laws.

== Management ==
The president and chief executive officer is Herman Gref, confirmed by the board of directors on 16 October 2007.

Sergei Gorkov joined Sberbank in November 2008 eventually becoming the head of the international operations and the senior vice chairman of the board from 10 October 2010, until 26 February 2016, when he left Sberbank to become the Chairman of Vnesheconombank. He greatly expanded Sberbank from operations in only two foreign countries, Kazakhstan (2006) and Ukraine (December 2007), to over twenty countries including Belarus (2009), Germany (2009), China (2010), India (September 2010), Switzerland (31 December 2011), Austria (acquisition of Volksbank International AG on 15 February 2012; changed name to Sberbank Europe AG on 1 November 2012, with locations in Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, Ukraine, and Germany), Bosnia-Herzegovina (20 February 2013), Hungary (31 December 2011; 1 November 2013, as Sberbank Hungary Ltd), Croatia (February 2012), Czech Republic (20 February 2013), Slovenia (28 January 2013), Serbia (24 December 2012), Slovakia (15 February 2013), and Turkey (acquisition of DenizBank in September 2012). Following Gorkov&#x27;s departure, Svetlana Alekseyevna Sagaydak () became the new Senior Vice Chairman of the Board.

The chairman of the supervisory board of Sberbank (since April 2021) is Anton Siluanov, Minister of Finance of Russia.

Formerly from 2003 to 2013 the head of RIA Novosti and from 2006 to 2016 its editor in chief, Svetlana Mironyuk is a vice-president and the head of marketing and communications since 1 February 2016.

In February 2022, Sverbank announced foundation of its own e-commerce holding, headed by its former top-manager Lev Khasis but in a week on Feb 22,2022 he left Sberbank.

== Operations ==


As of 2015 the bank had about 16,500 offices with over 250,000 employees. According to own estimates, the bank had over 137 million retail clients and over 1.1 million corporate clients in its 22 countries of presence.

As of August 2015 it accounted for 28.6% of aggregate banking assets, calling itself &quot;the circulatory system of the Russian economy&quot;,&quot;key lender to the Russian economy and the biggest receiver of deposits&quot;.

Within Russia, Sberbank is structured into several regional divisions (territorial banks):

=== International presence ===

The 19 August 2021 Supreme Court of Ukraine ruling forbids the daughter of the Russian Sberbank in Ukraine to use the trademark &quot;Sberbank&quot; since it ruled that Oschadbank is the sole legal owner of the trademark &quot;Sberbank&quot; in Ukraine.

==== 2021-2023 closure of international operations ====

In November 2021, aiming to focus on priority markets, Sberbank Europe AG sold associated banks in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sberbank a.d. Banja LuKa and Sberbank BH d.d. Sarajevo), in Croatia (Sberbank d.d.), in Hungary (Sberbank Magyarorszag Zrt.), in Serbia (Sberbank Srbija a.d. Beograd) and in Slovenia (Sberbank banka d.d.) to Serbian MK Group for about 500 million Euros.

Sberbank will be closing its office in the UAE in 2023 as a result of sanctions pressure.

On 16 June 2023 Sberbank announced that it had sold the Austrian bank &quot;Sber Vermögensverwaltungs AG in Abwicklung&quot; (formerly Sberbank Europe AG) to an unnamed Austrian company. It was the last subsidiary of Sberbank in Europe.

=== Ongoing international operations ===
In the fall of 2023, Sberbank announced the opening of a branch in China. Also, to work with Chinese clients in the Russian border territories, the bank registered the trademark Сбер银行.

In October 2023, Sberbank launched a line of Islamic finance products: the Adafa interest-free card and the Amana account, which complies with the AAOIFI standard. Products are available in nine regions of Russia, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Chechnya.

== Sponsorship ==
Sberbank sponsors sports and charity events in various regions of Russia, as well as educational projects including projects developing financial literacy.

==Controversies==

===Savings freezing===

Sberbank is the successor of Soviet Saving Banks (as it name implies), whose assets belonged to the state. During Russia&#x27;s transition to a market economy in the 1990s, in which these assets were sold, Sberbank provided no guarantee for citizens&#x27; deposits. This resulted in a landslide depreciation, which in turn led to severe discontent among the Russian population. Since 1996, partial compensation for investors&#x27; losses has been offered. However, until 2003 this only applied to state-owned banks such as Sberbank, giving them an unfair advantage over fully private banks.

The law of 1995 assumed that in 2003 the repayment of debts to the population would begin, taking into account the real value of the ruble at the current moment. However, for 20 years, the start of payments was regularly postponed. As of 2022, the full repayment of the debt would cost the state almost 200 trillion rubles. In the fall of 2022, the government introduced a bill on a new delay - until 2026.

===Low level of service in the early 2000s===
In the early 2000s, Sberbank was repeatedly blamed for poor service. In subsequent years, Sberbank introduced new services and improved the quality of some of its existing ones. By the mid-2010s, the bank was reportedly among the market leaders with regards to quality of client services, such as services for retail depositors, premium services and several others.

===Laundering stolen money accusations, Prevezon Holdings===

Sergei Leonidovich Magnitsky accused numerous persons and entities of laundering stolen money in tax fraud in a in Russia. Owned by Denis Katsyv, Prevezon Holdings, represented by Natalia Vladimirovna Veselnitskaya and Louis Freeh, paid $6 million to resolve the claim without admitting any crime which subsequently led to all charges being dropped by the Justice Department in the summer of 2017.

=== Pavlovgranite case ===
In United States court, Sergey P. Poymanov (), a Voronezh-based businessman, sued Sberbank, several of its subsidiaries and executives, and a business rival for 750 million rubles, claiming that a valuable granite gravel quarry he owned was illegally bankrupted and seized by the bank in a corporate raid in 2012. Sberbank says it took the quarry as collateral after Mr. Poymanov failed to repay a loan. Sberbank is retaining Marc Kasowitz for this court case.

In January 2017 Herman Gref, a bank chief executive, has personally commented on Poymanov case, referring to the latter as a &quot;fraudster&quot; and accusing him of not paying loands and debts, and that Poymanov is charged with a felony. He said that Poymanov &quot;extracted&quot; a lot of money out of the company and that he was offered with a restructuring of his loans but allegedly refused.

Poymanov was subsequently charged with a bunch of misdemeanors and arrested on May 24, 2017, by Russian police who then subjected him to harsh pretrial detention at a notoriously rough Moscow jail, Matrosskaya Tishina, which is the same jail where Magnitsky died. He was charged with alleged embezzlement of company&#x27;s money amounting to almost 1 billion rubles (about USD$11 million) as a part of Bankruptcy fraud.

===Ukrainian sanctions and vandalism of Sberbank property===

In April 2014, several Ukrainian officials accused Sberbank of funding the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, including alleged terrorism. The bank denied any involvement in the financing of illegal activities on Ukrainian territory, which was later confirmed by an examination carried out by the National Bank of Ukraine.

&quot;It is another instance of aggressive nationalism of neo-Nazi dogma that is gathering momentum in Ukraine and obviously enjoys support of official authorities of the country,&quot; the Russian foreign ministry stated.

15 March 2017, the president of Ukraine imposed sanctions on Sberbank (and other Russian state-owned banks operating in Ukraine: VTB Bank, BM Bank, Prominvestbank, and ()) as part of its continued sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and involvement in the war in Donbas. Since then, Sberbank&#x27;s Ukrainian subsidiary, VS Bank (), has been put on sale. But it has been unsuccessfully trying to sell the asset after the National Bank of Ukraine blocked the sale of the bank due to a &quot;failure to provide the necessary and sufficient documents to carry out checks on the investors in compliance with Ukrainian law.&quot; In 2017 Sberbank was reported to be waiting for approval from the National Bank of Ukraine to sell its Ukrainian subsidiaries. &quot;Everything is prepared on our side. The question is whether we will be given a permission to sell or not by Ukrainian authorities,&quot; Herman Gref who is the chairman of Sberbank said on the World Economic Forum held in Davos in January 2018. On 13 December 2017, Sberbank sold another subsidiary, VS Bank (), to a Ukrainian banker, former PrivatBank chairman Serhiy Tihipko.

===Troika Laundromat accusation in Lithuania===
In March 2019, the Troika Laundromat was exposed as an international money laundering network involving the Troika Dialog which is an investment bank that has been merged with the Sberbank&#x27;s subsidiary Sberbank CIB.

=== 2019 data breach ===
In October 2019, it was revealed that analysts from cybersecurity firm DeviceLock had shared information about a large Sberbank data breach with the newspaper, the &quot;Kommersant&quot;. The personal information of up to 60 million Sberbank credit cards had been offered for sale on the black market. It was the largest data breach to have taken place in Russian banking.

<doc id="530465" wikidata="Q957700" url="?curid=530465" title="Saint Andrews, New Brunswick">
<text>Saint Andrews is a town in Charlotte County, New Brunswick, Canada. The historic town is a national historic site of Canada, bearing many characteristics of a typical 18th century British colonial settlement, including the original grid layout with its market square, and the classical architecture.

Although often shortened in non-official sources to &quot;St. Andrews,&quot; the town&#x27;s legal name is spelt &quot;Saint Andrews,&quot; and appears as such on the town&#x27;s website; &quot;St. Andrews by-the-Sea&quot; is a brand used for tourism purposes by the local Chamber of Commerce.

On 1 January 2023, Saint Andrews annexed the local service district of Bayside and Chamcook. Revised census information has not yet been released.

==History==
The site of the town was named Qunnnoskwamk&#x27;ook, meaning long gravel bar in the Malecite-Passamaquoddy language. The present name was given by a French missionary who landed at the site on Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day. At the eastern end the town is a midden, a pile of shells and other refuse that accumulated over 2,000 years due to year-round activity of the Passamaquoddy. Today it is a provincial heritage site.

The site was settled in 1783 by Penobscot Loyalists.
The town&#x27;s street grid was designed by Charles Morris and was laid out at that time and persists today. Except for the shoreline Water Street, the names of streets have royal or colonial associations: (Parr Street, Carleton Street and Montague Street are all named after governors. These streets cross thirteen named after the children of King George III.). Also typical of British colonial settlement of the time are the town&#x27;s defensive sites, public spaces, and delineation.

Between 1820 and 1860, the port of Saint Andrews welcomed Irish immigrants. They were first quarantined at Hospital Island, in Passamaquoddy Bay. At the 1851 census, more than 50% of the town&#x27;s population had been born in Ireland.

The Pendlebury Lighthouse, also known as the St. Andrews North Point Lighthouse, was built in 1833 at the tip of the peninsula. Deactivated in 1938, it has since been restored and registered as a Canadian historic place.

In 1840, the Charlotte County Court House was built, and was used continually until 2016.

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, St. Andrews became a seaside resort for people from Montreal and Boston who were seeking to escape the summer heat. The town&#x27;s first seaside hotel, the Argyll, opened in 1881. It was followed in 1889 by The Algonquin, a resort on a hill overlooking the town, which became Canada&#x27;s first seaside resort. The Argyll burned down in 1892 and was never rebuilt while the Algonquin burned in 1914 and was rebuilt one year later. The lifestyle of wealthy summer visitors is commemorated at the Ross Memorial Museum.

A federal marine research facility, the St. Andrews Biological Station, was established in 1908 and the Huntsman Marine Science Centre in 1969.

The town was designated a national historic site in 1998.

==Geography==

Saint Andrews is at the southern tip of a peninsula, extending into Passamaquoddy Bay. The waterfront faces Saint Andrews Harbour and the Western Channel, which is formed by Navy Island. The harbour is at the mouth of the St. Croix River. 

The town is directly opposite the community of Robbinston, Maine, two kilometres to the west across the river mouth, and 53 km by road.

Ministers Island is east of the town and is accessible by road at low tide only.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Saint Andrews had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Transportation==
Despite its proximity to the Canada–United States border, the nearest border crossings are 30 km away at St. Stephen or via a ferry service at Deer Island, both in New Brunswick.

The only way into or out of Saint Andrews by land is via Route 127, which runs directly through the town. It meets Route 1 on either end of the town.

==Media==
A local community channel, CHCO-TV, serves the Saint Andrews and Charlotte County area. The station launched in 1993 on cable television, and began broadcasting over the air in 2006.

<text>The Council of International Fellowship (CIF) is a worldwide organisation to provide possibilities for inservice training and the exchange of professional experiences in the field of Social Work.

Henry. B. Ollendorff born in Germany, was sent to Germany to participate in the re-education program of the U.S. government. In 1954 he conducted courses for youth leaders and social workers in Hesse. Working with these young people made him think to start an exchange program. His plan was approved by the German Ministry of Youth and also the German Fulbright Commission. The first German participants went to Cleveland, Ohio. In 1956 the &quot;Cleveland International Program - CIP&quot; (later &quot;Council of International Programs&quot;) was founded.

1958 followed the German exchange program - and started with the invitation of American social workers.

CIF was founded 1960 in Hamburg, Germany. It is registered in Bonn, Germany. Now the organisation has exchange programs in different parts of the world (United States, India, Western European countries, etc.).

Beside the exchange programs there are international conferences (2003 in Goa, India, 2005 in Bonn, Germany, 2007 in Cleveland, Ohio, 2009 in Finland, 2011 in Cyprus, and 2013 in Ankara, Turkey).

<doc id="530470" wikidata="Q420553" url="?curid=530470" title="Mycophenolic acid">
<text>Mycophenolic acid is an immunosuppressant medication used to prevent rejection following organ transplantation and to treat autoimmune conditions such as Crohn&#x27;s disease and lupus. Specifically it is used following kidney, heart, and liver transplantation. It can be given by mouth or by injection into a vein. It comes as mycophenolate sodium and mycophenolate mofetil.
Common side effects include nausea, infections, and diarrhea. Other serious side effects include an increased risk of cancer, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. It works by blocking inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is needed by lymphocytes to make guanosine.
Mycophenolic acid was initially discovered by Italian Bartolomeo Gosio in 1893. It was rediscovered in 1945 and 1968. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1995 following the discovery of its immunosuppressive properties in the 1990s. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 227th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
===Organ transplant===
Mycophenolate is used for the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil is indicated for the prevention of organ transplant rejection in adults and kidney transplantation rejection in children over 2 years; whereas mycophenolate sodium is indicated for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection in adults. Mycophenolate sodium has also been used for the prevention of rejection in liver, heart, or lung transplants in children older than two years.

===Autoimmune disease===
Mycophenolate is increasingly utilized as a steroid sparing treatment in autoimmune diseases and similar immune-mediated disorders including Behçet&#x27;s disease, pemphigus vulgaris, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, small vessel vasculitides, and psoriasis. It is also used for retroperitoneal fibrosis along with a number of other medications. Specifically it has also been used for psoriasis not treatable by other methods.

Its increasing application in treating lupus nephritis has demonstrated more frequent complete response and less frequent complications compared to cyclophosphamide bolus therapy, a regimen with risk of bone marrow suppression, infertility, and malignancy. Further work addressing maintenance therapy demonstrated mycophenolate superior to cyclophosphamide, again in terms of response and side-effects. Walsh proposed that mycophenolate should be considered as a first-line induction therapy for treatment of lupus nephritis in people without kidney dysfunction.

===Comparison to other agents===
Compared with azathioprine it has higher incidence of diarrhea, and no difference in risk of any of the other side effects in transplant patients. Mycophenolic acid is 15 times more expensive than azathioprine.

==Adverse effects==
Common adverse drug reactions (≥ 1% of people) include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, joint pain; infections, leukopenia, or anemia reflect the immunosuppressive and myelosuppressive nature of the drug. Mycophenolate sodium is also commonly associated with fatigue, headache, cough and/or breathing issues. Intravenous (IV) administration of mycophenolate mofetil is also commonly associated with thrombophlebitis and thrombosis. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of people) include esophagitis, gastritis, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, and/or invasive cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. More rarely, pulmonary fibrosis or various neoplasia occur: melanoma, lymphoma, other malignancies having an occurrences of 1 in 20 to 1 in 200, depending on the type, with neoplasia in the skin being the most common site.
Several cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have also been reported.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert that people are at increased risk of opportunistic infections, such as activation of latent viral infections, including shingles, other herpes infections, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus associated nephropathy. In addition the FDA is investigating 16 people that developed a rare neurological disease while taking the drug. This is a viral infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; it attacks the brain and is usually fatal.

===Pregnancy===
Mycophenolic acid is associated with miscarriage and congenital malformations when used during pregnancy, and should be avoided whenever possible by women trying to get pregnant.

===Blood tests===
Among the most common effects of this drug is increased blood cholesterol levels. Other changes in blood chemistry such as hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) can occur.

==Mechanism of action==
Purines (including the nucleosides guanosine and adenosine) can either be synthesized &quot;de novo&quot; using ribose 5-phosphate or they can be salvaged from free nucleotides. Mycophenolic acid is a potent, reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme essential to the &quot;de novo&quot; synthesis of guanosine-5&#x27;-monophosphate (GMP) from inosine-5&#x27;-monophosphate (IMP). IMPDH inhibition particularly affects lymphocytes since they rely almost exclusively on &quot;de novo&quot; purine synthesis. In contrast, many other cell types use both pathways, and some cells, such as terminally differentiated neurons, depend completely on purine nucleotide salvage. Thus, use of mycophenolic acid leads to a relatively selective inhibition of DNA replication in T cells and B cells.

==Pharmacology==
Mycophenolate can be derived from the fungi &quot;Penicillium stoloniferum&quot;, &quot;P. brevicompactum&quot; and &quot;P. echinulatum&quot;. Mycophenolate mofetil is metabolised in the liver to the active moiety mycophenolic acid. It reversibly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that controls the rate of synthesis of guanine monophosphate in the &quot;de novo&quot; pathway of purine synthesis used in the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Other cells recover purines via a separate salvage pathway and are thus able to escape the effect.

Mycophenolate is potent and can, in many contexts, be used in place of the older anti-proliferative azathioprine. It is usually used as part of a three-compound regimen of immunosuppressants, also including a calcineurin inhibitor (ciclosporin or tacrolimus) and a glucocorticoid (e.g. dexamethasone or prednisone).

==Chemistry==

Mycophenolate mofetil is the morpholino ethyl ester of mycophenolic acid; the ester masks the carboxyl group. Mycophenolate mofetil is reported to have a pKa values of 5.6 for the morpholino moiety and 8.5 for the phenolic group.

==History==
Mycophenolic acid was discovered by Italian medical scientist Bartolomeo Gosio. Gosio collected a fungus from spoiled corn and named it &quot;Penicillium glaucum&quot;. (The species is now called &quot;P. brevicompactum&quot;.) In 1893 he found that the fungus had antibacterial activity. In 1896 he isolated crystals of the compound, which he successfully demonstrated as the active antibacterial compound against the anthrax bacterium. This was the first antibiotic that was isolated in pure and crystalline form. But the discovery was forgotten. It was rediscovered by two American scientists C.L. Alsberg and O.M. Black in 1912, and given the name mycophenolic acid. The compound was eventually demonstrated to have antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, and antipsoriasis activities. Although it is not commercialised as antibiotic due to its adverse effects, its modified compound (ester derivative) is an approved immunosuppressant drug in kidney, heart, and liver transplantations, and is marketed under the brands Cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil by Roche) and Myfortic (mycophenolate sodium by Novartis).

Cellcept was developed by a South African geneticist Anthony Allison and his wife Elsie M. Eugui. In the 1970s while working at the Medical Research Council, Allison investigated the biochemical causes of immune deficiency in children. He discovered the metabolic pathway involving an enzyme, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is responsible for undesirable immune response in autoimmune diseases, as well as for immune rejection in organ transplantation. He conceived an idea that if a molecule that could block the enzyme is discovered, then, it would become an immunosuppressive drug that could be used for autoimmune diseases and in organ transplantation. In 1981 he decided to go for drug discovery and approached several pharmaceutical companies, which turned him down one by one as he had no primary knowledge of drug research. However, Syntex liked his plans and asked him to join the company with his wife. He became vice president for the research. In one of their experiments the Allisons used an antibacterial compound, mycophenolate mofetil, which was abandoned in clinical use due to its adverse effects. They discovered that the compound had immunosuppressive activity. They synthesised a chemical variant for increased activity and reduced adverse effects. They subsequently demonstrated that it was useful in organ transplantation in experimental rats. After successful clinical trials, the compound was approved for use in kidney transplant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 3 May 1995, and was sold under the brand name Cellcept. It was approved for use in the European Union in February 1996.

==Names==
It was initially introduced as the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, brand name Cellcept) to improve oral bioavailability. The salt mycophenolate sodium has also been introduced. Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) is an alternative MPA formulation.

MMF and EC-MPS appear to be equal in benefits and safety.

==Research==
Mycophenolate mofetil is beginning to be used in the management of auto-immune disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma (systemic sclerosis or SSc), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) with success for some patients.

It is also being used as a long-term therapy for maintaining remission of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, though thus far, studies have found it inferior to azathioprine. A combination of mycophenolate and ribavirin has been found to stop infection by and replication of dengue virus &quot;in vitro&quot;. It has also shown promising antiviral activity against MERS, especially in combination with interferon.

Preliminary data suggest that mycophenolate mofetil might have benefits in people with multiple sclerosis. However the evidence is insufficient to determine the effects as an add‐on therapy for interferon beta-1a in people with RRMS.

<text>Torpids is one of two series of bumping races, a type of rowing race, held yearly at Oxford University; the other is Eights Week. More than 130 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s crews race for their colleges in twelve divisions: six each of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s; almost 1,200 participants in total. The racing takes place on the Isis (part of the River Thames), usually in the 7th week of Hilary Term on four successive days from Wednesday to Saturday (around the start of March).

==Overview==

Bumping races evolved in Oxford as the river is too narrow for normal side by side racing. Competing crews start the race lined up in order, one behind another, with their coxes holding ropes (&#x27;bung lines&#x27;) attached to the bank, with gaps of about 1.5 boat lengths between the bow of one boat and the stern of the one in front. Racing is started by the firing of a cannon. Racing is by division, the number of crews in a division depending on river conditions. The bottom men&#x27;s division starts first with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s alternating, finishing with the top women&#x27;s division.

Crews attempt to progress up their division by hitting (&#x27;bumping&#x27;) the boat in front without being hit by the boat behind, with the ultimate aim of becoming &quot;Head of the River&quot; i.e. top of the first division. The Head of the River is awarded the Torpids Challenge Cup, presented to the OUBC by President T.C. Edwards-Moss of Brasenose College Boat Club. Once a bump has taken place, the crew whose boat was bumped has to continue racing (and is liable to be bumped again) whilst the bumping crew moves to the side. This can lead to a crew moving down several places during a day&#x27;s racing. This is the principal difference in the rules between Torpids and Summer Eights, where both crews stop racing. Commonly a cox will concede a bump, signalled by raising an arm, rather than waiting to be hit. The crew finishing top of a lower division rows again the same day at the bottom of the division above.

The name &#x27;Torpids&#x27; derives from the event&#x27;s origins as a race for the second boats of the colleges, which were of course slower than the first boats. The status of the event – still adjudged below that of Summer Eights on account of the absence of rowers in the Varsity boat races – only began to rise at the very end of the nineteenth century, when colleges began to form first boats to compete. Nowadays there is no limit on the number of boats a college may enter, although crews in the last two divisions and crews without a position have to qualify to race by competing in a timed race the preceding Friday, known as &#x27;rowing on&#x27;.

Athletes competing in that year&#x27;s Boat Race, Women&#x27;s Boat Race or any of the Lightweight University crews at Henley Boat Races may not compete in Torpids, but may compete in Summer Eights.

===Double Headship===
The &quot;Double Headship&quot; is an accolade of any college finishing with their men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s crews at the &quot;Head of the River&quot;. Oriel is the first to have achieved this in Torpids, in 2006. The college&#x27;s new first crews repeated this in 2018.

===Trophies===
The first day&#x27;s starting order is based on the previous year&#x27;s finishing positions, and each subsequent day&#x27;s starting order is based on the previous day&#x27;s finishing positions. A crew that bumps on every day or that finishes at the Head of the River is awarded &quot;blades&quot; – the right to get trophy oars painted up in their college colours with the names and weights of the successful crew emblazoned on them. &quot;Spoons&quot; are awarded in case the crew was bumped on every single day. A third, somewhat unusual possibility is the award of &quot;spades&quot;. The crew is both bumped and then proceeds to bump a crew in front of it before the end of the race. Thus being both the bumper and the bumped on the same day. Owing to the differences in rules between Torpids and Lent Bumps at the University of Cambridge this achievement is only possible at Oxford.

<text>Buchi Emecheta (born Florence Onyebuchi Emecheta ; 21 July 1944 – 25 January 2017) was a Nigerian writer who was the author of novels, plays, autobiography, and children&#x27;s books. She first received notable critical attention for her 1974 novel, &quot;Second Class Citizen&quot;. Her other books include &quot;The Bride Price&quot; (1976), &quot;The Slave Girl&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Joys of Motherhood&quot; (1979). Emecheta has been characterized as &quot;the first successful black woman novelist living in Britain after 1948&quot;.

Born in Lagos, Nigeria, Emecheta drew in her writing on themes of child slavery, motherhood, female independence and freedom through education, gaining recognition from critics and honours especially with her debut novel, &quot;Second Class Citizen&quot;. Her works often explore the themes of culture, and tensions between tradition and modernity. Most of her early novels were published by Allison and Busby, and her editor was Margaret Busby.

==Life==
===Background and marriage===
Emecheta was born on 21 July 1944, in Lagos, Colonial Nigeria, to Igbo parents of Anioma extraction, Alice Okwuekwuhe and Jeremy Nwabudinke Emecheta from Umuezeokolo Odeanta village in Ibusa, Delta State. Her father was a railway worker and moulder. Her mother, Alice Ogbanje Ojebeta Emecheta, was a former slave girl sold into slavery by her brother to a relative to buy silk head ties for his coming-of-age dance. When her mistress died, Ogbanje Emecheta returned home to freedom.

Emecheta completed her early childhood education at an all-girls&#x27; missionary school. At nine, she lost her father, who died of the complications from a wound which he contracted in the swamps of Burma, where he had been conscripted to fight for Lord Louis Mountbatten and the remnants of the British Empire. After a year, she received a fully funded scholarship to Methodist Girls&#x27; School in Yaba, Lagos, where she remained until the age of 16. During this time, her mother died, leaving Emecheta an orphan, with books and her imagination becoming her refuge. In 1960, she married Sylvester Onwordi, a schoolboy to whom she had been engaged since she was 11 years old. Later that year, she gave birth to a daughter, and in 1961 their younger son was born.

Onwordi moved to London for his studies, and Emecheta joined him there with their first two children in 1962. In the next six years, she would give birth to five children; three daughters and two sons. According to Emecheta, her marriage was an unhappy and sometimes violent one; details of which she would incorporate in her autobiographical book, &quot;Second Class Citizen&quot;. To keep her sanity, Emecheta wrote in her spare time. However, her husband was deeply suspicious of her writing, and he ultimately burned her first manuscript, &quot;The Bride Price&quot;, which was eventually published in 1976. She had had to rewrite it after the earlier version was destroyed; as she later said, &quot;There were five years between the two versions.&quot;

At the age of 22, pregnant with her fifth child, Emecheta left her husband. While working to support her children alone, she earned a B.Sc. (Hons) degree in Sociology in 1972 from the University of London. In her 1984 autobiography, &quot;Head above Water&quot;, she wrote: &quot;As for my survival for the past twenty years in England, from when I was a little over twenty, dragging four cold and dripping babies with me and pregnant with a fifth one—that is a miracle.&quot; She would go on to gain her PhD from the university in 1991.

===Writing===
Keeping a diary, Emecheta typed up episodes about her experiences of Black British life and sent them to the weekly &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine, at the time edited by Richard Crossman, who in 1971 began to publish Emecheta&#x27;s sketches in a regular column. A collection of these pieces became her first published book in 1972, &quot;In the Ditch&quot; (Barrie and Jenkins). This semi-autobiographical documentary novel chronicled the struggles of a main character named Adah, who is forced to live in a housing estate while working as a librarian to support her five children. Emecheta&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Second-Class Citizen&quot;, which also drew on her own experiences, was published two years later (Allison and Busby, 1974). In 1979, a revised edition of &quot;In the Ditch&quot; was published by Allison and Busby, where both &quot;In the Ditch&quot; and &quot;Second Class Citizen&quot; were eventually published in one volume under the title &quot;Adah&#x27;s Story&quot; (1983). These books introduced Emecheta&#x27;s three major themes, which were the quest for equal treatment, self-confidence and dignity as a woman.

Her later works &quot;Gwendolen&quot; (1989, also published as &quot;The Family&quot;), &quot;Kehinde&quot; (1994) and &quot;The New Tribe&quot; (2000) differ in some way, as they address the issues of immigrant life in Great Britain. Most of her fictional works are focused on sexual discrimination and racial prejudice, informed by her own experiences as both a single parent and a black woman living in the United Kingdom.

From 1965 to 1969, Emecheta worked as a library officer for the British Museum in London. From 1969 to 1976, she was a youth worker and sociologist for the Inner London Education Authority, and from 1976 to 1978 she worked as a community worker in Camden, North London, while continuing to produce further novels at Allison and Busby, with Margaret Busby as her editor – &quot;The Bride Price&quot; (1976), &quot;The Slave Girl&quot; (1977), &quot;The Joys of Motherhood&quot; (1979) and &quot;Destination Biafra&quot; (1982) – as well as the children&#x27;s books &quot;Titch the Cat&quot; (1979, based on a story by her 11-year-old daughter Alice) and &quot;Nowhere To Play&quot; (1980).

Following Emecheta&#x27;s success as an author, she travelled widely as a visiting professor and lecturer. She visited several American universities, including Pennsylvania State University, Rutgers University, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. From 1980 to 1981, she was senior resident fellow and visiting professor of English at the University of Calabar, Nigeria. From 1982 to 1983, Emecheta, together with her son Sylvester, ran the Ogwugwu Afor Publishing Company, producing her own work under the imprint, beginning with &quot;Double Yoke&quot; (1982). She received an Arts Council of Great Britain bursary, 1982–83, and was one of &quot;Granta&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best of Young British Novelists&quot; in 1983. In 1982, she lectured at Yale University, and the University of London. She became a Fellow at the University of London in 1986.

Over her career, Emecheta worked with many cultural and literary organizations, including the Africa Centre, London, and with the Caine Prize for African Writing as a member of the Advisory Council.

===Later years===
Emecheta suffered a stroke in 2010, and her last years were marked by increasing disability and illness. She died in London on 25 January 2017, aged 72.

==Awards and recognition==
Among the honours received during her literary career, Emecheta won the 1978 Jock Campbell Prize from the &quot;New Statesman&quot; (first won by Chinua Achebe&#x27;s &quot;Arrow of God&quot;) for her novel &quot;The Slave Girl&quot;, and she was on &quot;Granta&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1983 list of 20 &quot;Best of Young British Novelists&quot;. She was a member of the British Home Secretary&#x27;s Advisory Council on Race in 1979.

In September 2004, she appeared in the &quot;A Great Day in London&quot; photograph taken at the British Library, featuring 50 Black and Asian writers who have made major contributions to contemporary British literature. In 2005, she was made an OBE for services to literature.

She received an Honorary doctorate of literature from Farleigh Dickinson University in 1992.

==Legacy==
In 2017, Emecheta&#x27;s son Sylvester Onwordi announced the formation of the Buchi Emecheta Foundation – a charitable organisation promoting literary and educational projects in the UK and in Africa – which was launched in London on 3 February 2018 at the Brunei Gallery, SOAS, together with new editions of several of her books published by Onwordi through his Omenala Press. Among participants in the &quot;Celebrating Buchi Emecheta&quot; day-long event – &quot;a gathering of writers, critics, artists, publishers, literature enthusiasts and cultural activists from all over the world, including London and other parts of the U.K., France, Germany, U.S., Canada, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, and the Caribbean&quot; – were Diane Abbott, Leila Aboulela, Carole Boyce Davies, Margaret Busby, James Currey, Louisa Uchum Egbunike, Ernest Emenyonu, Akachi Ezeigbo, Kadija George, Mpalive Msiska, Grace Nichols, Alastair Niven, Irenosen Okojie, Veronique Tadjo, Marie Linton Umeh, Wangui wa Goro, and Bibi Bakare-Yusuf.

Emecheta features at number 98 on a list of 100 women recognised in August 2018 by &quot;BBC History Magazine&quot; as having changed the world.

In March 2019, Camden Town Brewery launched a football kit using artwork featuring &quot;some of the most inspiring female icons to have influenced the brewery&#x27;s home borough of Camden&quot;.

On 21 July 2019, which would have been Emecheta&#x27;s 75th birthday, Google commemorated her life with a Doodle.

In October 2019, a new exhibition space in the library for students at Goldsmiths, University of London, was dedicated to Buchi Emecheta, marked by a reception with short talks by Goldsmiths warden Frances Corner and the Head of Library Services, Leo Appleton, preceding an address by Margaret Busby.

In October 2021, Emecheta&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Second Class Citizen&quot;, was reissued as a Penguin Modern Classic, as was &quot;In the Ditch&quot; in 2023.

<text>The Age of Anxiety: A Baroque Eclogue (1947; first UK edition, 1948) is a long poem in six parts by W. H. Auden, written mostly in a modern version of Anglo-Saxon alliterative verse.

The poem deals, in eclogue form, with man&#x27;s quest to find substance and identity in a shifting and increasingly industrialized world. Set in a wartime bar in New York City, Auden uses four characters – Quant, Malin, Rosetta, and Emble – to explore and develop his themes.

The poem won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1948.

A critical edition of the poem, edited by Alan Jacobs, was published by Princeton University Press in 2011.

==Influence==
The poem inspired Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s 1949 Symphony No. 2, also known as &quot;The Age of Anxiety.&quot;

The phrase &quot;Age of Anxiety&quot; was used in the titles of E. R. Dodds&#x27; book &quot;Pagan and Christian in an Age of Anxiety&quot; (1965), as well as Pete Townshend&#x27;s novel &quot;The Age of Anxiety&quot; (2019).

<text>Henri Nestlé (; born Heinrich Nestle, ; 10 August 1814 – 7 July 1890) was a German-Swiss confectioner and the founder of Nestlé, the world&#x27;s largest food and beverage company.

== Early life ==
Heinrich Nestle was born on 10 August 1814 in Frankfurt am Main. He was the eleventh of fourteen children of Johann Ulrich Matthias Nestle and Anna Maria Catharina Ehemann. Nestle&#x27;s father, by tradition, inherited the business of his father, Johann Ulrich Nestle, and became a glazier in Töngesgasse. The later Lord Mayor of Frankfurt am Main, Gustav Edmund Nestle, was his brother.

The Nestle family has its roots in western Swabia, predominantly in boroughs of the Black Forest such as Dornstetten, Freudenstadt, Mindersbach, Nagold, and Sulz am Neckar. In the Swabian dialect, &quot;Nestle&quot; is a small bird&#x27;s nest. The name Nestle also has different variations, including Nästlin, Nästlen, Nestlin, Nestlen, and Niestle. &quot;Nestlé&quot; with &quot;é&quot; is a frenchification of the German name, although Switzerland is 67 % german-speaking.

The Nestle family tree began with three brothers (thus the three young birds in the nest being fed by their mother on the family coat of arms) from Mindersbach, called Hans, Heinrich, and Samuel Nestlin. The father of these three sons was born circa 1495. Hans, the eldest, was born in 1520 and had a son with the same name, who later became mayor of Nagold. His son Ulrich was a barber and his fifth son was the first glazier in the family. For over five generations, this profession was passed down from father to son. Additionally, the Nestles provided a number of mayors for the boroughs of Dornstetten, Freudenstadt, Nagold, and Sulz am Neckar.

== Career and new name ==
Before Nestle turned 20 in 1834, he completed a four-year apprenticeship with J. E. Stein, owner of a Frankfurt pharmacy. At some point between 1834 and 1839 he migrated, for reasons unknown, to Switzerland. At the end of 1839, he was officially authorized in Lausanne, Vaud, to perform chemical experiments, make up prescriptions, and sell medicines. During this time, he changed his name to Henri Nestlé in order to adapt better to the new social environment in French-speaking Vevey, where he eventually settled.

In 1843, Nestlé bought into one of the region&#x27;s production of rapeseeds. He also became involved in the production of nut oils (used to fuel oil lamps), liqueurs, rum, absinthe, and vinegar. He also began manufacturing and selling carbonated mineral water and lemonade, although during the European food crisis in the 1840s, Nestlé gave up mineral water production. In 1857 he began concentrating on gas lighting and fertilizers.

Though it is not known when Nestlé started working on his infant formula project, by 1867, Nestlé had produced a viable powdered milk product. His interest is known to have been spurred by several factors. Although Nestlé and his wife were childless, they were aware of the high death rate among infants. Nestlé would have been aware of Justus von Liebig&#x27;s work in developing an infant formula. In addition, fresh milk was not always available in large towns, and women in higher society were starting to view breastfeeding as an unfashionable option.

Nestlé combined cow&#x27;s milk with grain and sugar to produce a substitute for breast milk. Moreover, he and his friend Jean Balthasar Schnetzler, a scientist in human nutrition, removed the acid and the starch in wheat flour because they were difficult for babies to digest. Initially called &quot;kindermehl,&quot; or &quot;children flour&quot;, his product had an advantage over Liebig&#x27;s &quot;soup for infants&quot; in that it was much easier to prepare, needing only to be boiled prior to feeding, and it soon proved to be a viable option for infants who were unable to breastfeed. People quickly recognized the value of the new product, and soon &quot;Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé&quot;, &quot;Henri Nestlé&#x27;s Milk Flour&quot; in French, was being sold in much of Europe. By the 1870s, &quot;Nestlé&#x27;s Infant Food&quot;, made with malt, cow&#x27;s milk, sugar, and wheat flour, was selling in the US for $0.50 a bottle.

Nestlé&#x27;s milk-condensation process enabled the chocolatier Daniel Peter, of Vevey, to perfect his milk chocolate formulation in 1875, after seven years of effort, and the two men subsequently formed a partnership which resulted, four years later, in 1879, in the organisation of the Nestlé Company, which eventually became one of the largest Europe-based confection industries.

== Personal life ==
Nestlé and Anna Clémentine Thérèse Ehemant were married in Frankfurt, Germany on 23 May 1860. Nestlé sold his company in 1875 to his business associates and then lived with his family alternately in Montreux and Glion, where they helped people with small loans and publicly contributed towards improving the local infrastructure. In Glion, he moved into a house later known as Villa Nestlé.

Nestlé died in Glion on 7 July 1890.

<text>Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança (March 13, 1907 – May 6, 1995), also known by her literary pseudonym Hilda de Toledano, was a Portuguese writer and journalist who claimed to be the illegitimate daughter of King Carlos I of Portugal. From 1932 she also claimed the right to the title of Duchess of Braganza and to be the rightful heiress to the throne of Portugal.

Maria Pia of Braganza claimed that King Carlos I legitimized her through a royal decree and placed her in the line of succession, however no proof was presented to demonstrate this and the King similarly did not have the personal authority to do so. Maria Pia&#x27;s paternity was never proven and her claim to the throne or of royal ancestry never widely accepted.

==Birth and baptism==
Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo Gotha e Bragança was born Lisbon, Portugal, allegedly as the royal bastard daughter of an adulterous relationship between King Carlos I of Portugal, then married to Princess Amélie of Orléans, and Maria Amélia Laredó e Murça, the daughter of a wealthy Brazilian couple who had moved to Europe: Armando Maurício Laredó and Maria Amélia Murça e Berhen. Maria Amélia&#x27;s parents are sometimes given the title &quot;baron&quot;, but they did not actually hold any noble title; their wealth and patrician status, however, may have allowed them to use such a title unquestioned.
Maria Amélia Laredó e Murça was not married at the time she gave birth to her daughter on March 13, 1907. Maria Pia of Braganza claimed that, shortly thereafter, she was taken by her mother and grandparents to Madrid, Spain. There, she said, she was baptised in the Church of Saint Fermin de los Navarros on April 15, 1907, and that the baptism was registered at the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel and Saint Aloysius. She claimed that her baptismal registration recorded that her father was &quot;D. Carlos de Sassonia-Coburgo y Savoya de la Casa de Braganza de Portugal&quot;. This clearly refers to King Carlos I of Portugal, who at the time was married to another woman, Princess Amélie of Orléans.

The original baptismal registers of the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel and Saint Aloysius were destroyed during the Spanish Civil War, and no original birth record of Maria Pia of Braganza has ever been made public. In 1939 the Vicar-General of the Diocese of Madrid-Alcalas issued a baptismal certificate to Maria Pia of Braganza with information provided to him at that time by Don Antonio Goicoechea y Cusculluela, a member of the Spanish parliament and the Governor of the Bank of Spain, who had reportedly been present at the baptism. Subsequently, Maria Pia of Braganza used this baptismal certificate as evidence for her claim to be the recognised daughter of King Carlos.
Maria Pia of Braganza also claimed that in the archives of the Diocese of Madrid-Alcalá there was a copy of a document signed by King Carlos on March 14, 1907 in which he recognised Maria Pia of Braganza as his daughter and that &quot;she may be called by my name and enjoy from now on the use of this name with the honours, prerogatives, rank, obligations and advantages of the princes of the House of Braganza of Portugal&quot;. Like the baptismal certificate, the original of this document did not survive.

==Marriages and children==

In 1925, at the age of eighteen, Maria Pia of Braganza married Francesco Javier Bilbao y Batista, a Cuban playboy twenty years her senior. He came from a rich family of cattle breeders. Since Bilbao was divorced, the marriage was a civil one only and took place in the Cuban embassy in Paris. They had one daughter, Fátima Francisca Xaviera Iris Bilbao de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança, in 1932, who became Sister Francisca, a cloistered nun in a convent.

Maria Pia of Braganza lived briefly with Bilbao in Cuba, before returning to Spain. Bilbao died November 15, 1935. Francisca died unmarried in 1982.
To escape the Spanish Civil War, Maria Pia of Braganza moved with her mother to Rome. In 1939, she married Giuseppe Blais, a colonel in the Italian carabinieri. At the time, members of the carabinieri were forbidden from marrying foreigners. The marriage was, therefore, celebrated clandestinely, and was not registered civilly until August 5, 1946. The union proved much happier and together they had a daughter, &quot;Maria&quot; da Glória &quot;Cristina&quot; Amélia Valéria Antónia Blais de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança, born in 1946. Maria Cristina Blais de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança (in Spain also called &quot;María Cristina Blais de Sajonia-Coburgo Braganza&quot;) married the Spanish sculptor Miguel Ortíz y Berrocal (1933–2006) and together they lived in Verona and had two sons: Carlos Miguel Berrocal de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança (born 1976) and Beltrão José Berrocal de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança (born 1978).

General Blais died in 1983. In 1985, Maria Pia of Braganza married António João da Costa Amado-Noivo (January 28, 1952 – December 29, 1996). At the time of the wedding, Maria Pia was 78, Amado-Noivo 33.

==Literary career==

Like many society ladies, Maria Pia of Braganza supplemented her income by writing. In the early 1930s she had a number of articles published in two Spanish newspapers &quot;Blanco y Negro&quot; and &quot;ABC&quot;.

In 1937, Maria Pia wrote her first book &quot;La hora de Alfonso XIII&quot; (The Hour of Alfonso XIII) published in Havana, Cuba, by Ucar, Garcia y Companía. This work, written in Spanish and published under the name &quot;Hilda de Toledano&quot;, is a defence of King Alfonso XIII of Spain, who was living in exile at the time.

In 1954, Maria Pia wrote &quot;Un beso y ... nada más: confidencia consciente de una pecadora inconsciente&quot; (A Kiss and ... Nothing More: Conscious Confidences of an Unconscious Sinner) published in Madrid by Plenitud. This novel was also written in Spanish and published under the name &quot;Hilda de Toledano&quot;.

In 1957, Maria Pia wrote &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;une infante vivante&quot; (Memoirs of a Living Infanta) published in Paris by Del Duca. This work, written in French and published under the name &quot;Maria Pia de Saxe-Cobourg Bragance&quot;, is an autobiography. It marks the first attempt of Maria Pia to receive widespread public recognition for her claim that she was the bastard daughter of King Carlos I of Portugal. In the book, however, Maria Pia makes no claim to any dynastic rights. The book closes with the sentence, &quot;I claim no sceptre but my pen, no crown but that bequeathed by my father and mother: my dignity.&quot; Instead, Maria Pia of Braganza suggests that the rightful heir to the Portuguese throne should be Princess Isabelle d’Orléans, eldest child of Henri, Count of Paris.

==Controversies==
===Claim to the Portuguese throne===
For at least several decades Maria Pia had claimed to be the bastard daughter of King Carlos I, and even to be entitled to the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; and the title &quot;Infanta&quot;. It was not, however, until 1957 that she claimed to be the rightful queen of Portugal in succession to Manuel II, the son of Carlos I (and the purported half-brother of Maria Pia) who had died childless in 1932. 
On July 15, 1957, a group of ten Portuguese monarchists published a petition asking Maria Pia to claim the throne. In 1958 she went to Portugal where she was received by the President Francisco Craveiro Lopes; the Prime Minister, António de Oliveira Salazar, however, refused to meet her. In the presidential elections that year Maria Pia supported the failed candidacy of Humberto Delgado. She continued to support Delgado after he went into exile in Brazil.

From this point forward Maria Pia used the title &quot;Duchess of Braganza&quot;. She attracted the support of a small minority of monarchists who were actively opposed to Salazar. Maria Pia of Braganza played on the rivalry in monarchist circles between the Miguelists and the constitutionalists, presenting herself as the &quot;constitutional&quot; (i.e. liberal) candidate. The support given to Salazar by Miguel&#x27;s heir at the time, Duarte Nuno, in the 1950s enabled Maria Pia of Braganza even more to represent herself as the liberal and democratic claimant to the Portuguese throne.
Maria Pia was very active in her claim to the Portuguese throne. Articles about her appeared in Italian and Portuguese newspapers. In February 1965, she went to Portugal to visit the tomb of King Carlos. As she was leaving Portugal and returning to Spain, she was arrested and held in custody overnight. She was released without charge at the request of the Italian embassy. In 1976, she infamously checked out of a hotel in Lisbon, where she had stayed for several weeks, without paying the bill, claiming simply that as the &quot;Duchess of Braganza&quot; she was not obligated to pay for her lodging.

Maria Pia mixed frequently with the jet set idle rich. She claimed that for many years she maintained an ongoing friendship with the exiled King Alfonso XIII of Spain and his son Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia, and this was confirmed by the first wife of the latter, Emanuela de Dampierre. Much correspondence exists between Maria Pia of Braganza and members of European royal families recording her efforts to gain legitimacy within royal circles, but most of the replies were merely polite but unsupportive.

===Baptismal certificate===

In October 1966 Duarte Nuno petitioned an ecclesiastical court of the Diocese of Madrid-Alcala to remove the name of King Carlos from the baptismal certificate of Maria Pia. Duarte Nuno claimed that there was no evidence that King Carlos was the father of Maria Pia. It is unusual for a baptismal registration to record the father of a bastard child. The &quot;Roman Ritual&quot; instructs the officiating priest only to record the father&#x27;s name if the father himself requests it or if he is known to be the father from some public authentic document (Titulus XII, caput II). Clearly King Carlos was not present at Maria Pia&#x27;s baptism, but Maria Pia claimed that the copy of the document purportedly signed by Carlos granting her the rights of the princes of Portugal was sufficient justification in ecclesiastical law for Carlos to be named her father on her baptismal certificate.

In February 1972 the case between Duarte Nuno and Maria Pia moved up to the Sacred Roman Rota, the normal appeal court for the Roman Catholic Church. On December 6, 1972, the court dismissed the claim, on the grounds that Duarte Nuno did not have legal standing in the case, being only the second cousin twice removed of King Carlos. The court did not address the primary question of whether there was sufficient evidence for Carlos being Maria Pia&#x27;s father and thus named as such on the baptismal certificate. It did, however, question the necessity of changing a certificate which was over sixty years old.

Had the Roman Rota found in favour of Duarte Nuno, his supporters could have said that the court had determined that Carlos was not Maria Pia&#x27;s father. Since the court found against Duarte Nuno, the supporters of Maria Pia of Braganza were able to say that the court had affirmed the validity of her baptismal certificate and therefore the validity of her claimed parentage – neither of which in fact actually occurred. The court found only that Duarte Nuno did not have the legal standing to bring such a case: &quot;Patres Auditores de Turno ... decreverunt &quot;negative&quot;, seu non constare de legitimatione actoris ad causam&quot;.

===Legal battle over property===
In 1982 Maria Pia filed a claim for the restitution of the private real property of the Royal House of Portugal. It was rejected by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice at Lisbon on April 14, 1983. The Court found that Maria Pia had not established the identity of her father, despite the presentation of the same baptismal certificate presented to the court at the Vatican.

===Rosario Poidimani===
Rosario Poidimani (born Syracuse, August 25, 1941) is an Italian businessman. On December 2, 1985, Maria Pia signed a document purporting to amend the Portuguese Monarchic Constitution of 1838, and recognising Rosario Poidimani as her eventual heir. On February 19, 1986, she signed a second document affirming that there was a blood relationship between her and Rosario Poidimani – but not stating exactly what this relationship was. The Constitution of 1838, which excluded Miguel I of Portugal and his descendants, the present line of the Portuguese Royal family, was revoked in 1842, when the Constitutional Charter of 1826 was reinstated until the Republic, on October 5, 1910.

On April 3, 1987, Maria Pia signed a document abdicating her claim to the Portuguese throne and transferring her claimed rights to Rosario Poidimani. In the abdication document she stated that the reason for her action in favour of Rosario Poidimani was that she had been &quot;totally deprived of the support of my descent&quot;.

Since 1987, Rosario Poidimani has styled himself &quot;H.R.H. Dom Rosario of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Braganza, 22nd Duke of Braganza&quot;, and has been active in promoting his claims.

In December 2003, Rosario Poidimani brought a libel suit in Italy against Guy Stair Sainty in response to Sainty&#x27;s analysis of the claims of Maria Pia and Rosario Poidimani, &quot;A brief response to statements made by the supporters of the late Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança, her grandson Carlos Miguel Berrocal y Blais, and her alleged cognate Rosario Poidimani in respect of their claims to the throne of Portugal&quot;. In August 2010 Rosario Poidimani won a decision against Sainty in the court of Vicenza; for defamation allegedly caused by the article, Sainty was ordered to pay twenty thousand euros in the judgment. However, that judgment was reversed by the Italian Court of Appeal of Venice, no. 730/2016 published March 30, 2016, RG n. 2667/2010, Repert. n. 680/2016 of March 30, 2016.

In 2007 Poidimani was arrested on the charge of fraud in connection with the alleged sale of diplomatic passports; Poidimani claimed that he had the right to issue these passports as head of the Royal House of Portugal and president of the IIRD. The Court of Busto Arsizio initially sentenced him to 5 years in prison in January 2011. However, on April 15, 2013, the Court of Appeal of Milan overturned the conviction and sentence. Rosario Poidimani has also initiated a number of complaints and lawsuits against Duarte Pio and against numerous Portuguese government officials.

==Death==
Maria Pia of Braganza died in Verona, Italy, in 1995. She was buried with her second husband, General Blais, in the Cimitero Monumentale of Verona.

==Analysis==
Maria Pia&#x27;s claims, and those of Rosario Poidimani, have hinged upon the truth or falsehood of the following:
# that she was the illegitimate daughter of King Carlos I;
# that Carlos I had the constitutional power and the political clout (at a time shortly before his death and the overthrow of his son) to alter the line of succession to the Portuguese throne; 
# that Carlos I both recognized Maria Pia of Braganza as his daughter and declared her a legitimate heir, despite her birth from an &quot;adulterine&quot; union;
# that Carlos I was able to do the above without causing public scandal or friction within the royal house, particularly in relation to Amélie of Orléans, his wife and their two sons;
# that Maria Pia of Braganza, supposedly heir-presumptive, could then marry foreigners and/or commoners (which she did twice), in apparent violation of the Constitution and/or the laws of the Portuguese royal house;
# that her daughter Maria Cristina of Braganza , and Maria Cristina&#x27;s sons, all waived their rights of succession;
# that she adopted Rosario Poidimani according to Italian laws comparable to those of Portugal; and that this adoption did not violate the Portuguese royal house&#x27;s laws and/or the Constitution; and
# that she could alter the succession line in favour of Rosario Poidimani, a foreigner and adopted son without authenticated blood relationship to her, although he claimed to be a descendant of Luis I of Portugal.

There are no original documents to support Maria Pia&#x27;s claims to be both a daughter of Carlos I and an heir to the Dukedom of Braganza and pretender to the throne of Portugal. Maria Pia&#x27;s baptismal certificate from 1907 was destroyed and there is only a copy of the document in which Carlos I supposedly granted succession rights to her. Nonetheless, there are some records concerning a relationship between Maria Pia&#x27;s mother Maria Amélia Laredó e Murça and King Carlos I. A biography of Infanta Eulalia of Spain purports to reveal some letters of the Portuguese King and also reveals the existence of Maria Pia of Braganza as King Carlos I&#x27;s bastard daughter. King Alfonso XIII of Spain and his son Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia seem to have had an ongoing friendship with Maria Pia; her supporters have interpreted this relationship as an affirmation on the part of Alfonso and Jaime that they recognised Maria Pia of Braganza as Carlos&#x27;s bastard daughter. In fact, most of the letters cited by Maria Pia in support of her claim were simply courteous replies by royals to her numerous queries and salutations.

Traditionally, the only way in which an illegitimate child of a Portuguese monarch could have been made legitimate and take his or her place in the line of succession was if his or her parents subsequently were married. At the time of Maria Pia&#x27;s birth, Carlos was married to Queen Amélie and had two sons with her. Children born of adultery were specifically excluded from the line of succession.

Carlos I was a constitutional monarch. He did not claim autocratic power, but instead ruled according to the Constitutional Charter of 1826 which stated that the succession to the throne passed only to legitimate descendants. The Constitution, including all matters of succession, could only be amended by the Cortes. Even if Carlos had signed a document granting succession rights to Maria Pia, it would have had no legal value at all.

Just as Carlos could not unilaterally change the Constitutional Charter and grant Maria Pia succession rights, neither could Maria Pia (even if she were rightful queen of Portugal) unilaterally change the Constitution and grant succession rights to Rosario Poidimani above her daughter and grandsons.

The claims of Maria Pia of Braganza (or &quot;Hilda de Toledano&quot;) are similar to those of several Europeans born outside marriage who entertain the idea of descent from royalty; the late Enrico Vigo, who claimed the Byzantine Crown, is another example.

<text>The Lavochkin La-5 (Лавочкин Ла-5) was a Soviet fighter aircraft of World War II. It was a development and refinement of the LaGG-3, replacing the earlier model&#x27;s inline engine with the much more powerful Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engine. During its time in service, it was one of the Soviet Air Force&#x27;s most capable types of warplane, able to fight German designs on almost equal footing.

==Development==

The La-5 descended from the LaGG-1 and LaGG-3, aircraft designed by Vladimir Gorbunov before the Second World War. The LaGG-1 was underpowered, and the LaGG-3 - with a lighter airframe and a stronger engine did not solve the problem. By early 1942, the LaGG-3&#x27;s shortcomings led to Lavochkin falling out of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s favour, and LaGG-3 factories converting to Yakovlev Yak-1 and Yak-7 production.

During the winter of 1941–1942, Lavochkin worked unofficially to improve the LaGG-3. Design work was conducted in a small hut beside an airfield. In early 1942, Gorbunov replaced a LaGG-3&#x27;s inline engine with the stronger Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engine. The nose was replaced with the nose of the ASh-82-powered Sukhoi Su-2. The new engine required work to maintain the aircraft&#x27;s balance. The prototype first flew in March, and demonstrated surprisingly acceptable performance; air force test pilots considered it to be superior to the Yak-7, and intensive flight tests began in April. The aircraft was named LaG-5; the change from LaGG was because Mikhail Gudkov, one of the original LaGG designers, was no longer with the programme. By July, it was called La-5, although Gorbunov was still involved.

By July, the La-5 was ordered into full production, including the conversion of incomplete LaGG-3 airframes. Production based on the prototype began almost immediately in factories in Moscow and the Yaroslav region. Changes to the main production model included slats to improve all-round performance. The La-5 was inferior to the best German fighters at higher altitudes, but equal at lower altitudes; it was suitable for air combat over the Eastern Front which typically took place at altitudes under 5,000 m (16,404 ft).

The aircraft received further modifications. The La-5F improved the pilot&#x27;s exterior visibility with a cut down rear fuselage. The definitive La-5FN had a fuel-injected engine, a different engine air intake, and was further lightened. A full circle turn took 18–19 seconds. Very late-production La-5FN had two 20mm Berezin B-20 cannon installed in the cowling in place of the heavier two 20mm ShVAK; both were capable of a salvo weight of 3.4 kg/s.

9,920 La-5s of all variants were built, including dedicated trainer versions, designated La-5UTI.

The La-5 was the basis for the further improved Lavochkin La-7.

A number of La-5s continued in the service of Eastern Bloc nations after the end of the war, including Czechoslovakia.

==Performance==
In mid-1943, a new La-5 was captured by the Germans after making a forced landing at a German airfield. The aircraft was assessed by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; test pilot Hans-Werner Lerche. Lerche noted that the La-5FN excelled at altitudes below 3,000 m (9,843 ft) but suffered from short range and flight time of only 40 minutes at cruise engine power. All of the engine controls (throttle, mixture, propeller pitch, cowl flaps, and supercharger gearbox) had separate levers which forced the pilot to make constant adjustments during combat or risk suboptimal performance. For example, rapid acceleration required moving no less than six levers. In contrast, contemporary German aircraft with the BMW 801 used the &quot;Kommandogerät&quot; engine computer system that automatically controlled all of these settings from a single throttle lever. Due to airflow limitations, the engine boost system (&quot;Forsazh&quot;) could not be used above 2,000 m (6,562 ft). Stability in all axes was generally good. The authority of the ailerons was deemed exceptional but the rudder was insufficiently powerful at lower speeds. At speeds in excess of 600 km/h (370 mph), the forces on control surfaces became excessive. Horizontal turn time at 1,000 m (3,281 ft) and maximum engine power was 25 seconds.

The La-5&#x27;s top speed and acceleration were comparable to Luftwaffe fighters at low altitude. The La-5FN roll rate was slightly higher than the Messerschmitt Bf 109; the Bf 109 was slightly faster, and had higher climb and turn rates. The La-5FN climbed slightly faster and had a smaller turn radius than the Focke-Wulf Fw 190A-8. However, the Fw 190A-8 was faster at all altitudes and had significantly better dive performance and a superior roll-rate. Lerche advised Fw 190 pilots to draw the La-5FN to higher altitudes, escape attacks by diving followed by a high-speed shallow climb, and avoid prolonged turning engagements.

The most serious La-5 defects were the engine&#x27;s thermal isolation, lack of cockpit ventilation, and a canopy that was impossible to open at speeds over 350 km/h. Furthermore, poor engine compartment insulation allowed exhaust gas to enter the cockpit; in response, pilots frequently ignored orders by flying with open canopies.

Soviet pilots were generally satisfied with the La-5. &quot;That was an excellent fighter with two cannons and a powerful air-cooled engine&quot;, recalled pilot Viktor M. Sinaisky. &quot;The first La-5s from the Tbilisi factory were slightly inferior, while the last ones from the Gorki plant, which came to us from Ivanovo, were perfect. At first we received regular La-5s, but then we got new ones containing the ASh-82FN engine with direct injection of fuel into the cylinders. It was perfected and had better maneuverability, acceleration, speed and climb rate compared to the early variants. Everyone was in love with the La-5. It was easy to maintain, too.&quot;

Nevertheless, La-5 losses were high, the highest of all fighters in service in USSR, excepting those of the Yak-1. In 1941–45, VVS KA lost 2,591 La-5s: 73 in 1942, 1,460 in 1943, 825 the following year, and 233 in 1945.
== Operational history ==
The La-5F arrived at the frontline in February 1943. It was able to challenge the Bf 109G-2 and the Fw 190A-4 on more or less equal terms, while at tree-top height it was even faster. One of the most successful La-5 units was 5th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, that flew 3,802 combat sorties, claiming 128 enemy aircraft shot down while losing 52 Lavochkins.

<text>The Lavochkin La-7 (; NATO reporting name: Fin) was a piston-engined single-seat Soviet fighter aircraft developed during World War II by the Lavochkin Design Bureau. It was a development and refinement of the Lavochkin La-5, and the last in a family of aircraft that had begun with the LaGG-1 in 1938. Its first flight was in early 1944 and it entered service with the Soviet Air Forces later in the year. A small batch of La-7s was given to the Czechoslovak Air Force the following year, but it was otherwise not exported. Armed with two or three cannon, it had a top speed of . The La-7 was felt by its pilots to be at least the equal of any German piston-engined fighter. It was phased out in 1947 by the Soviet Air Force, but served until 1950 with the Czechoslovak Air Force.

==Design and development==
By 1943, the La-5 had become a mainstay of the Soviet Air Forces, yet both its head designer, Semyon Lavochkin, as well as the engineers at the Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute (), felt that it could be improved upon. &quot;TsAGI&quot; refined earlier studies of aerodynamic improvements to the La-5 airframe in mid-1943 and modified La-5FN c/n 39210206 to evaluate the changes. These included complete sealing of the engine cowling, rearrangement of the wing center section to accommodate the oil cooler and the relocation of the engine air intake from the top of the cowling to the bottom to improve the pilot&#x27;s view.

The aircraft was evaluated between December 1943 and February 1944 and proved to have exceptional performance. Using the same engine as the standard La-5FN c/n 39210206 had a top speed of at a height of , some faster than the production La-5FN. It took 5.2 minutes to climb to . It was faster at low to medium altitudes than the La-5 that used the more powerful prototype Shvetsov M-71 engine.

Lavochkin had been monitoring &quot;TsAGI&quot;″s improvements and began construction in January 1944 of an improved version of the La-5 that incorporated them as well as lighter, but stronger, metal wing spars to save weight. The La-5, as well as its predecessors, had been built mostly of wood to conserve strategic materials such as aircraft alloys. With Soviet strategists now confident that supplies of these alloys were unlikely to become a problem, Lavochkin was now able to replace some wooden parts with alloy components. In addition Lavochkin made a number of other changes that differed from c/n 39210206. The engine air intake was moved from the bottom of the engine cowling to the wing roots, the wing/fuselage fillets were streamlined, each engine cylinder was provided with its own exhaust pipe, the engine cowling covers were reduced in number, a rollbar was added to the cockpit, longer shock struts were fitted for the main landing gear while that for the tail wheel was shortened, an improved PB-1B(V) gunsight was installed, and a new VISh-105V-4 propeller was fitted. Three prototype Berezin B-20 autocannon were mounted in the engine cowling, firing through the propeller, arming the 1944 standard-setter (), as the modified aircraft was named.

The &quot;etalon&quot; only made nine test flights in February and March 1944 before testing had to be suspended after two engine failures, but quickly proved itself to be the near-equal of c/n 39210206. It was lighter than the earlier aircraft, which allowed the &quot;etalon&quot; to out-climb the other aircraft (4.45 minutes against 5.2 minutes climb to 5,000 meters). It was slower at sea level, but only slower at . The flight tests validated Lavochkin&#x27;s modifications and it was ordered into production under the designation of La-7, although the B-20 cannon were not yet ready for production and the production La-7 retained the two 20-mm ShVAK cannon armament of the La-5.
Five La-7s were built in March by Factory () Nr. 381 in Moscow and three of these were accepted by the Air Force that same month. The Moscow factory was the fastest to complete transition over to La-7 production and the last La-5FN was built there in May 1944. &quot;Zavod&quot; Nr. 21 in Gorky was considerably slower to make the change as it did not exhaust its stock of wooden La-5 wings until October. The quality of the early production aircraft was significantly less than the &quot;etalon&quot; due to issues with the engine, incomplete sealing of the cowling and fuselage, and defective propellers. One such aircraft was tested, after these problems had been fixed, by the Flight Research Institute () and proved to be only slower than the &quot;etalon&quot; at altitude. Aircraft from both factories were evaluated in September by the Air Force Scientific Test Institute () and the problems persisted as the aircraft could only reach at a height of and had a time to altitude of 5.1 minutes to .

Combat trials began in mid-September 1944 and were generally very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory service in the La-5FN. One cause was the lower position of the engine air intakes in the wing roots of the La-7 which caused the engine to ingest sand and dust. One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October which caused the fighter to be grounded until the cause was determined to be a defect in the wing spar.

Production of the first aircraft fitted with three B-20 cannon began in January 1945 when 74 were delivered. These aircraft were heavier than those aircraft with the two ShVAK guns, but the level speed was slightly improved over the original aircraft. However, the time to climb to increased by two-tenths of a second over the older model. More than 2,000 aircraft were delivered before the war&#x27;s end, most by Zavod Nr. 21. A total of 5,753 aircraft had been built by &quot;Zavod&quot; Nr. 21, Nr. 381, and Nr. 99 in Ulan-Ude, when production ended in early 1946.

==Operational history==

The 63rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (GIAP) began combat trials of the La-7 in mid-September 1944 in support of the 1st Baltic Front. Thirty aircraft were provided for the trials, which lasted one month. During this time the new fighters made 462 individual sorties and claimed 55 aerial victories while losing four aircraft in combat. Four other La-7s were lost to non-combat causes, mostly related to engine problems. A total of three pilots were killed during the trials to all causes.

63rd GIAP regimental commander Colonel Yevgeny Gorbatyuk, a Hero of the Soviet Union, commented: &quot;The La-7 exhibited unquestionable advantages over German aircraft in multiple air combats. In addition to fighter tasks, photo reconnaissance and bombing were undertaken with success. The aircraft surpasses the La-5FN in speed, manoeuvrability, and, especially, in the landing characteristics. It requires changes in its armament, and urgent fixing of its engine.&quot; The twin ShVAK armament inherited from the La-5 was no longer powerful enough to bring down later, more heavily armored German fighters, especially the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, in a single burst, even when Soviet pilots opened fire at ranges of only .

The 156th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 4th Air Army was the next unit to receive the La-7 in October 1944. At one point during the month, they had fourteen aircraft simultaneously unserviceable with engine failures. By 1 January 1945 there were 398 La-7s in front-line service of which 107 were unserviceable. By 9 May 1945 this had increased to 967 aircraft, of which only 169 were unserviceable. For the invasion of Japanese Manchuria, 313 La-7s were assigned and only 28 of these were unserviceable on 9 August 1945.

The La-7 was flown by the top Soviet ace of the war, Ivan Nikitovich Kozhedub and was successfully used by him to down an Me 262 jet fighter, one of the few such shoot downs of the war. Kozhedub, a three-time Hero of Soviet Union, scored his last 17 air victories in 1945 in the La-7 numbered 27, which is now preserved in the Central Air Force Museum at Monino on the outskirts of Moscow.

One fighter regiment of the 1st Czechoslovak Composite Aviation Division was later equipped with the La-7 after participating in the Slovak National Uprising of August–October 1944 with La-5FN. A total of 56 aircraft were delivered and equipped the 1st and 2nd Fighter Regiments. The bulk of the aircraft, however, were delivered in 1945 and saw no combat during the war. It remained in service with the Czechoslovaks until 1950 and was designated postwar by them as the S-97. One of these aircraft survives in the Prague Aviation Museum, Kbely. Despite reports to the contrary, no La-7s were ever sold or transferred to the People&#x27;s Republic of China or North Korea. Such reports arose from misidentification by Western pilots of the La-9s or La-11s that were given to those countries.

The British test pilot, Eric Brown, was given the chance to fly an La-7 at the former &quot;Erprobungsstelle Tarnewitz&quot; Luftwaffe aircraft test station on the Baltic coast, shortly after the German surrender in May 1945. He described the handling and performance as &quot;quite superb&quot;, but the armament and sights were &quot;below par&quot;, the &quot;wooden construction would have withstood little combat punishment&quot; and the instrumentation was &quot;appallingly basic&quot;.

Production of the La-7 amounted to 5,753 aircraft, plus 584 La-7UTI trainers. Those aircraft still in service after the end of the war were given the NATO reporting name Fin. The follow-up model, the La-9, despite its outward similarity, was a completely new design.

===Tactical significance===
The La-7 ended the superiority in vertical maneuverability that the Messerschmitt Bf 109G had previously enjoyed over other Soviet fighters. Furthermore, it was fast enough at low altitudes to catch, albeit with some difficulties, Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter-bombers that attacked Soviet units on the front lines and immediately returned to German-controlled airspace at full speed. The Yakovlev Yak-3 and the Yakovlev Yak-9U with the Klimov VK-107 engine lacked a large enough margin of speed to overtake the German raiders. 115 La-7s were lost in air combat, only half the number of Yak-3s. According to VVS-KA records, only 3 La-7s were actually shot down in air combat in all of 1944 and a mere 10 fell victim to anti-aircraft fire with a further 23 due to non-combat cause. Losses to air combat in 1945 stand at 79 in total, with 115 overall. However, aircraft that went missing (not returning) or lost to wear are not included, e.g. 24 additional La-7s went missing in 1944. However, the total VVS-KA record loss may not give a true picture of combat losses, as combat losses were often claimed as non-combat losses either to conceal losses or for propaganda purposes.

:One aircraft used to evaluate the TK-3 turbosupercharger in July 1944 in the hopes of improving high-altitude performance. It was destroyed when the TK-3 disintegrated in flight.

===La-7R===
:Testbed for a tail-mounted liquid-fuelled RD-1KhZ rocket engine. The rocket was rated at of thrust and its fuel ( of kerosene and of red fuming nitric acid) was expected to last between three and three and a half minutes. While the rocket was firing it increased the fighter&#x27;s speed by , but the aircraft&#x27;s other flying qualities deteriorated. Fifteen flights were made in the first quarter of 1945, although the rocket exploded on the ground on 12 May. The aircraft was repaired, but later had an explosion in flight although the pilot managed to land it safely. Details of any later flights are unknown, but the La-7R was displayed at the August 1946 Tushino Airshow with the rocket firing.

===La-7PVRD===
:Testbed for two underwing ramjet engines. The aircraft was expected to reach a speed of at a height of , but could not exceed due to the high drag of the ramjets.

===La-7/M-71===
:One aircraft was fitted with the Shvetsov M-71 for trials in 1944. However the engine was not yet ready for service and the program was cancelled.

===La-7UTI===
:Two-seat trainer version. Armament reduced to a single 20 mm gun and the oil cooler was relocated underneath the engine cowling. Fitted with a radio compass and gun camera. Considerably heavier than the fighter at , but it retained the flying characteristics of the single-seat aircraft. 584 built, the last two delivered in 1947.

<doc id="530505" wikidata="Q864868" url="?curid=530505" title="Bone marrow suppression">
<text>Bone marrow suppression also known as myelotoxicity or myelosuppression, is the decrease in production of cells responsible for providing immunity (leukocytes), carrying oxygen (erythrocytes), and/or those responsible for normal blood clotting (thrombocytes). Bone marrow suppression is a serious side effect of chemotherapy and certain drugs affecting the immune system such as azathioprine. The risk is especially high in cytotoxic chemotherapy for leukemia. In the case of non-small-cell lung cancer, myelosuppression predisposition was shown to be modulated by enhancer mutations.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in some rare instances, may also cause bone marrow suppression. The decrease in blood cell counts does not occur right at the start of chemotherapy because the drugs do not destroy the cells already in the bloodstream (these are not dividing rapidly). Instead, the drugs affect new blood cells that are being made by the bone marrow. When myelosuppression is severe, it is called myeloablation.

Many other drugs including common antibiotics may cause bone marrow suppression. Unlike chemotherapy the effects may not be due to direct destruction of stem cells but the results may be equally serious. The treatment may mirror that of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression or may be to change to an alternate drug or to temporarily suspend treatment.

Because the bone marrow is the manufacturing center of blood cells, the suppression of bone marrow activity causes a deficiency of blood cells. This condition can rapidly lead to life-threatening infection, as the body cannot produce leukocytes in response to invading bacteria and viruses, as well as leading to anaemia due to a lack of red blood cells and spontaneous severe bleeding due to deficiency of platelets.

Parvovirus B19 inhibits erythropoiesis by lytically infecting RBC precursors in the bone marrow and is associated with a number of different diseases ranging from benign to severe. In immunocompromised patients, B19 infection may persist for months, leading to chronic anemia with B19 viremia due to chronic marrow suppression.

==Treatment==
Bone marrow suppression due to azathioprine can be treated by changing to another medication such as mycophenolate mofetil (for organ transplants) or other disease-modifying drugs in rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn&#x27;s disease.

===Chemotherapy induced myelosuppression===
Bone marrow suppression due to anti-cancer chemotherapy is much harder to treat and often involves hospital admission, strict infection control, and aggressive use of intravenous antibiotics at the first sign of infection.

G-CSF is used clinically (see Neutropenia) but tests in mice suggest it may lead to bone loss.

GM-CSF has been compared to G-CSF as a treatment of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression/Neutropenia.

Trilaciclib (COSELA), a CDK4/6 inhibitor, is administered before chemotherapy in small cell lung cancer to control chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. 

==Research==
In developing new chemotherapeutics, the efficacy of the drug against the disease is often balanced against the likely level of myelotoxicity the drug will cause. In-vitro colony forming cell (CFC) assays using normal human bone marrow grown in appropriate semi-solid media such as ColonyGEL have been shown to be useful in predicting the level of clinical myelotoxicity a certain compound might cause if administered to humans. These predictive in-vitro assays reveal effects the administered compounds have on the bone marrow progenitor cells that produce the various mature cells in the blood and can be used to test the effects of single drugs or the effects of drugs administered in combination with others.

<text>Horst Feistel (January 30, 1915 – November 14, 1990) was a German-American cryptographer who worked on the design of ciphers at IBM, initiating research that culminated in the development of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in the 1970s. The structure used in DES, called a Feistel network, is commonly used in many block ciphers.

==Life and work==
Feistel was born in Berlin, Germany in 1915, and moved to the United States in 1934. During World War II, he was placed under house arrest, but gained US citizenship on 31 January 1944. The following day he was granted a security clearance and began work for the US Air Force Cambridge Research Center (AFCRC) on Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) devices until the 1950s. He was subsequently employed at MIT&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratory, then the MITRE corporation. In 1968, Feistel became a Research Staff Member at the IBM T.J Watson Center. During his time there he received an award for his cryptographic work. In 1971, he patented the block cipher cryptographic system at IBM. His research at IBM led to the development of the Lucifer and Data Encryption Standard (DES) ciphers. Feistel was one of the earliest non-government researchers to study the design and theory of block ciphers.

Feistel lent his name to the Feistel network construction, a common method for constructing block ciphers (for example DES).

Feistel obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree at MIT, and his master&#x27;s at Harvard, both in physics. He married Leona (Gage) in 1945, with whom he had a daughter, Peggy.

<text>Prednisone is a glucocorticoid medication mostly used to suppress the immune system and decrease inflammation in conditions such as asthma, COPD, and rheumatologic diseases. It is also used to treat high blood calcium due to cancer and adrenal insufficiency along with other steroids. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects may include cataracts, bone loss, easy bruising, muscle weakness, and thrush. Other side effects include weight gain, swelling, high blood sugar, increased risk of infection, and psychosis. It is generally considered safe in pregnancy and low doses appear to be safe while the user is breastfeeding. After prolonged use, prednisone must be stopped gradually.
Prednisone is a prodrug and must be converted to prednisolone by the liver before it becomes active. Prednisolone then binds to glucocorticoid receptors, activating them and triggering changes in gene expression.
Prednisone was patented in 1954 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 30th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 18million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Prednisone is used for many different autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions, including asthma, gout, COPD, CIDP, rheumatic disorders, allergic disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, adrenocortical insufficiency, hypercalcemia due to cancer, thyroiditis, laryngitis, severe tuberculosis, hives, eczema, lipid pneumonitis, pericarditis, multiple sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, sarcoidosis, to relieve the effects of shingles, lupus, myasthenia gravis, poison oak exposure, Ménière&#x27;s disease, autoimmune hepatitis, giant cell arteritis, the Herxheimer reaction that is common during the treatment of syphilis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, uveitis, and as part of a drug regimen to prevent rejection after organ transplant.

Prednisone has also been used in the treatment of migraine headaches and cluster headaches and for severe aphthous ulcer. Prednisone is used as an antitumor drug.

Prednisone is often also prescribed as a form of treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL).

Prednisone can be used in the treatment of decompensated heart failure to increase renal responsiveness to diuretics, especially in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance with large doses of loop diuretics. In terms of the mechanism of action for this purpose: prednisone, a glucocorticoid, can improve renal responsiveness to atrial natriuretic peptide by increasing the density of natriuretic peptide receptor type A in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, thereby inducing a potent diuresis.

At high doses, it may be used to prevent rejection following an organ transplant.

== Side effects ==
Short-term side effects, as with all glucocorticoids, include high blood glucose levels (especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or on other medications that increase blood glucose, such as tacrolimus) and mineralocorticoid effects such as fluid retention. The mineralocorticoid effects of prednisone are minor, which is why it is not used in the management of adrenal insufficiency unless a more potent mineralocorticoid is administered concomitantly.

It can also cause depression or depressive symptoms and anxiety in some individuals.

Long-term side effects include Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, steroid dementia syndrome, truncal weight gain, glaucoma and cataracts, diabetes mellitus type 2, and depression upon dose reduction or cessation. Long-term steroids can also increase the risk of osteoporosis, but research has found that few of these people were taking medications to protect bones. Prednisone also results in leukocytosis.

=== Dependency ===
Adrenal suppression will begin to occur if prednisone is taken for longer than seven days. Eventually, this may cause the body to temporarily lose the ability to manufacture natural corticosteroids (especially cortisol), which results in dependence on prednisone. For this reason, prednisone should not be abruptly stopped if taken for more than seven days; instead, the dosage should be gradually reduced. This weaning process may be over a few days if the course of prednisone is short but may take weeks or months if the patient had been on long-term treatment. Abrupt withdrawal may lead to an Addisonian crisis. For those on chronic therapy, alternate-day dosing may preserve adrenal function and thereby reduce side effects.

Glucocorticoids act to inhibit feedback of both the hypothalamus, decreasing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland, decreasing the amount of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). For this reason, glucocorticoid analogue drugs such as prednisone down-regulate the natural synthesis of glucocorticoids. This mechanism leads to dependence in a short time and can be dangerous if medications are withdrawn too quickly. The body must have time to begin synthesis of CRH and ACTH and for the adrenal glands to begin functioning normally again.

Prednisone may start to result in the suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis if used at doses 7–10 mg or higher for several weeks. This is approximately equal to the amount of endogenous cortisol produced by the body every day. As such, the HPA axis starts to become suppressed and atrophy. If this occurs the patient should be tapered off prednisone slowly to give the adrenal gland enough time to regain its function and endogenous production of steroids.

=== Withdrawal ===
The magnitude and speed of dose reduction in corticosteroid withdrawal should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the underlying condition being treated, and individual patient factors such as the likelihood of relapse and the duration of corticosteroid treatment. Gradual withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids should be considered in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and have:

* received more than 40 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily for more than one week
* been given repeat doses in the evening
* received more than three weeks of treatment
* recently received repeated courses (particularly if taken for longer than three weeks)
* taken a short course within one year of stopping long-term therapy
* other possible causes of adrenal suppression

Systemic corticosteroids may be stopped abruptly in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse who have received treatment for three weeks or less and who are not included in the patient groups described above.

During corticosteroid withdrawal, the dose may be reduced rapidly down to physiological doses (equivalent to prednisolone 7.5 mg daily) and then reduced more slowly. Assessment of the disease may be needed during withdrawal to ensure that relapse does not occur.

==Pharmacology==

Prednisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Prednisone is a prodrug; it is metabolised in the liver by 11-β-HSD to prednisolone, the active drug. Prednisone has no substantial biological effects until converted via hepatic metabolism to prednisolone.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Prednisone is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and has a half-life of 2–3 hours. it has a volume of distribution of 0.4–1 L/kg. The drug is cleared by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome P450 enzymes. Metabolites are excreted in the bile and urine.

===Lodotra===
&quot;Lodotra&quot; is the brand name of an oral formulation, which releases prednisone four hours after ingestion. It is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis with morning stiffness. Taken at 10 p.m., it releases the drug at around 2 a.m. The plasmic peak level is reached at 4 a.m., which is considered to be the optimal time for relieving morning stiffness. The drug was approved in the European Union, in January 2009.

==Industry==

The pharmaceutical industry uses prednisone tablets for the calibration of dissolution testing equipment according to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).

==Chemistry==
Prednisone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisone and is also known as δ1-cortisone or 1,2-dehydrocortisone or as 17α,21-dihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,11,20-trione.

==History==
The first isolation and structure identifications of prednisone and prednisolone were done in 1950 by Arthur Nobile. The first commercially feasible synthesis of prednisone was carried out in 1955 in the laboratories of Schering Corporation, which later became Schering-Plough Corporation, by Arthur Nobile and coworkers. They discovered that cortisone could be microbiologically oxidized to prednisone by the bacterium &quot;Corynebacterium simplex.&quot; The same process was used to prepare prednisolone from hydrocortisone.

The enhanced adrenocorticoid activity of these compounds over cortisone and hydrocortisone was demonstrated in mice.

Prednisone and prednisolone were introduced in 1955 by Schering and Upjohn, under the brand names Meticorten and Delta-Cortef, respectively.

<doc id="530525" wikidata="Q26981430" url="?curid=530525" title="Hydrocortisone">
<text>Hydrocortisone is the name for the hormone cortisol when supplied as a medication. It is a corticosteroid and works as an anti-inflammatory and by immune suppression. Uses include conditions such as adrenocortical insufficiency, adrenogenital syndrome, high blood calcium, thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, asthma, and COPD. It is the treatment of choice for adrenocortical insufficiency. It can be given by mouth, topically, or by injection. Stopping treatment after long-term use should be done slowly.
Side effects may include mood changes, increased risk of infection, and edema (swelling). With long-term use, common side effects include osteoporosis, upset stomach, physical weakness, easy bruising, and candidiasis (yeast infections). It is unclear if it is safe for use during pregnancy.
Hydrocortisone was patented in 1936 and approved for medical use in 1941. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 202nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Hydrocortisone is the pharmaceutical term for cortisol used in oral administration, intravenous injection, or topical application. It is used as an immunosuppressive drug, given by injection in the treatment of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema, in place of prednisolone in patients needing steroid treatment but unable to take oral medication, and perioperatively in patients on long-term steroid treatment to prevent an adrenal crisis. It may also be injected into inflamed joints resulting from diseases such as gout.

It may be used topically for allergic rashes, eczema, psoriasis, itching, and other inflammatory skin conditions. Topical hydrocortisone creams and ointments are available in most countries without prescription in strengths ranging from 0.05% to 2.5% (depending on local regulations) with stronger forms available by prescription only.

It may also be used rectally in suppositories to relieve the swelling, itch, and irritation in hemorrhoids.

It may be used as an acetate form (hydrocortisone acetate), which has slightly different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid, acting specifically as both a glucocorticoid and as a mineralocorticoid. That is, it is an agonist of the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors.

Hydrocortisone has low potency relative to synthetic corticosteroids. Compared to hydrocortisone, prednisolone is about 4times as potent and dexamethasone about 40times as potent in terms of anti-inflammatory effect. Prednisolone can also be used as cortisol replacement, and at replacement dose levels (rather than anti-inflammatory levels), prednisolone is about 8times more potent than cortisol. The equivalent doses and relative potencies of hydrocortisone compared to various other synthetic corticosteroids have also been reviewed and summarized.

The endogenous production rate of cortisol is approximately 5.7 to 9.9mg/m2 per day, which corresponds to an oral hydrocortisone dose of approximately 15 to 20mg/day (for a 70-kg person). One review described daily cortisol production of 10mg in healthy volunteers and reported that daily cortisol production could increase up to 400mg in conditions of severe stress (e.g., surgery).

The total and/or free concentrations of cortisol/hydrocortisone required for various glucocorticoid effects have been determined.

===Pharmacokinetics===

====Absorption====
The bioavailability of oral hydrocortisone is about 96% ± 20% (SD). The pharmacokinetics of hydrocortisone are non-linear. The peak level of oral hydrocortisone is 15.3 ± 2.9 (SD) μg/L per 1mg dose. The time to peak concentrations of oral hydrocortisone is 1.2 ± 0.4 (SD) hours.

The topical percutaneous absorption of hydrocortisone varies widely depending on experimental circumstances and has been reported to range from 0.5 to 14.9% in different studies. Some skin application sites, like the scrotum and vulva, absorb hydrocortisone much more efficiently than other application sites, like the forearm. In one study, the amount of hydrocortisone absorbed ranged from 0.2% to 36.2% depending on the application site, with the ball of the foot having the lowest absorption and the scrotum having the highest absorption. The absorption of hydrocortisone by the vulva has ranged from 4.4 to 8.1%, relative to 1.3 to 2.8% for the arm, in different studies and subjects.

====Distribution====
Most cortisol in the blood (all but about 4%) is bound to proteins, including corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) and serum albumin. A pharmacokinetic review stated that 92% ± 2% (SD) (92–93%) of hydrocortisone is plasma protein-bound. Free cortisol passes easily through cellular membranes. Inside cells it interacts with corticosteroid receptors.

====Metabolism====
Hydrocortisone is metabolized by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11β-HSDs) into cortisone, an inactive metabolite. It is additionally 5α-, 5β-, and 3α-reduced into dihydrocortisols, dihydrocortisones, tetrahydrocortisols, and tetrahydrocortisones.

====Elimination====
The elimination half-life of hydrocortisone ranges from about 1.2 to 2.0 (SD) hours, with an average of around 1.5hours, regardless of oral versus parenteral administration. The duration of action of systemic hydrocortisone has been listed as 8 to 12hours.

==Chemistry==
Hydrocortisone, also known as 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a naturally occurring pregnane steroid. A variety of hydrocortisone esters exist and have been marketed for medical use.

== Society and culture ==

=== Legal status ===
In March 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Efmody, intended for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in people aged twelve years and older. The applicant for this medicinal product is Diurnal Europe BV. Hydrocortisone (Efmody) was approved for medical use in the European Union, in May 2021, for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in people aged twelve years and older.

===Anti-competitive practices===
In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) concluded an investigation into the supply of hydrocortisone tablets, finding that from October 2008 onwards, drug suppliers Auden McKenzie and Actavis plc had charged &quot;excessive and unfair prices&quot; for 10mg and 20mg tablets and entered into agreements with potential competitors, paying companies who agreed not to enter the hydrocortisone market and enabling Auden McKenzie and Actavis to supply the drugs as &quot;generic&quot; rather than branded products and thereby escape price controls until eventually other companies entered the market. Auden and Actavis overcharged the UK&#x27;s National Health Service for over ten years. Fines totalling over £255m were levied against the companies involved in this breach of competition law.

== Research ==

===COVID-19===
Hydrocortisone was found to be effective in reducing mortality rate of critically ill COVID-19 patients when compared to other usual care or a placebo.

<text>Roderick Doyle (born 8 May 1958) is an Irish novelist, dramatist and screenwriter. He is the author of eleven novels for adults, eight books for children, seven plays and screenplays, and dozens of short stories. Several of his books have been made into films, beginning with &quot;The Commitments&quot; in 1991. Doyle&#x27;s work is set primarily in Ireland, especially working-class Dublin, and is notable for its heavy use of dialogue written in slang and Irish English dialect. Doyle was awarded the Booker Prize in 1993 for his novel &quot;Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha&quot;.

==Personal life==
Doyle was born in Dublin, Ireland, and grew up in Kilbarrack, in a middle-class family. His mother, Ita (née Bolger) was a first cousin of the short story writer Maeve Brennan. 

In addition to teaching, Doyle, along with Seán Love, established a creative writing centre, &quot;Fighting Words&quot;, which opened in Dublin in January 2009. It was inspired by a visit to his friend Dave Eggers&#x27; 826 Valencia project in San Francisco, California. Doyle has also engaged in local causes, including signing a petition supporting journalist Suzanne Breen, who faced gaol for refusing to divulge her sources in court, and joining a protest against an attempt by Dublin City Council to construct 9 ft-high barriers which would interfere with one of his favourite views.

In 1989, Doyle married Belinda Moller. She is the granddaughter of former Irish President Erskine Childers. The couple have three children; Rory, Jack and Kate.

Doyle is an atheist.

== Education ==
Doyle attended University College Dublin, where he studied English and geography, and graduated with a BA in 1979. He went on to complete a Higher Diploma in Education (HDipEd) in 1980. He spent several years as an English and geography teacher before becoming a full-time writer in 1993. 

==Work==
Doyle&#x27;s writing is marked by heavy use of dialogue between characters, with little description or exposition. His work is largely set in Ireland, with a focus on the lives of working-class Dubliners. Themes range from domestic and personal concerns to larger questions of Irish history. His personal notes and workbooks reside at the National Library of Ireland.

===Novels for adults===

Doyle&#x27;s first three novels, &quot;The Commitments&quot; (1987), &quot;The Snapper&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Van&quot; (1991) comprise The Barrytown Trilogy, a trilogy centred on the Rabbitte family. All three novels were made into successful films.

&quot;The Commitments&quot; is about a group of Dublin teenagers, led by Jimmy Rabbitte Jr., who form a soul band in the tradition of Wilson Pickett. The novel was made into a film in 1991. &quot;The Snapper&quot;, made into a film in 1993, focuses on Jimmy&#x27;s sister, Sharon, who becomes pregnant. She is determined to have the child but refuses to reveal the father&#x27;s identity to her family. In &quot;The Van&quot;, which was shortlisted for the 1991 Booker Prize and made into a film in 1996, Jimmy Sr. is laid off, as is his friend Bimbo; the two buy a used fish and chips van and they go into business for themselves.

In 1993, Doyle published &quot;Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha&quot;, which later won the 1993 Booker Prize, and which showed the world as described, understood and misunderstood by a ten-year-old Dubliner living in 1968.

Doyle&#x27;s next novel dealt with darker themes. &quot;The Woman Who Walked into Doors&quot;, published in 1996, is the story of a battered wife, Paula Spencer, who was introduced in his 1994 television series &quot;Family&quot;, and is narrated by her. Despite her husband&#x27;s increasingly violent behaviour, Paula defends him, using the classic excuse &quot;I walked into a door&quot; to explain her bruises. Ten years later, the protagonist returned in &quot;Paula Spencer&quot;, published in 2006.

Doyle&#x27;s most recent trilogy of adult novels is &quot;The Last Roundup&quot; series, which follows the adventures of protagonist Henry Smart through several decades. &quot;A Star Called Henry&quot; (published 1999) is the first book in the series, and tells the story of Henry Smart, an IRA volunteer and 1916 Easter Rebellion fighter, from his birth in Dublin to his adulthood when he becomes a father. &quot;Oh, Play That Thing!&quot; (2004) continues Henry&#x27;s story in 1924 America, beginning in the Lower East Side of New York City, where he catches the attention of local mobsters by hiring kids to carry his sandwich boards. He also goes to Chicago where he becomes a business partner with Louis Armstrong. The title is taken from a phrase that is shouted in one of Armstrong&#x27;s songs, &quot;Dippermouth Blues&quot;. In the final novel in the trilogy, &quot;The Dead Republic&quot; (published 2010), Henry collaborates on writing the script for a Hollywood film. He returns to Ireland and is offered work as the caretaker in a school when circumstances lead to him re-establishing his link with the IRA.

Doyle frequently posts short comic dialogues on his Facebook page which are implied to be between two older men in a pub, often relating to current events in Ireland (such as the 2015 marriage referendum) and further afield. These developed into the novella &quot;Two Pints&quot; (2012). Other recent works are &quot;The Guts&quot; (2013), which continues the story of the Rabbitte family from the Barrytown Trilogy, focusing on a 48-year-old Jimmy Rabbite and his diagnosis of bowel cancer and &quot;Two More Pints&quot; (2014).

===Novels for children===

Doyle has also written many novels for children, including the &quot;Rover Adventures&quot; series, which includes &quot;The Giggler Treatment&quot; (2000), &quot;Rover Saves Christmas&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Meanwhile Adventures&quot; (2004).

Other children&#x27;s books include &quot;Wilderness&quot; (2007), &quot;Her Mother&#x27;s Face&quot; (2008), and &quot;A Greyhound of a Girl&quot; (2011).

===Plays, screenplays, short stories and non-fiction===

Doyle is also a prolific dramatist, writing four plays and two screenplays. His plays with the Passion Machine Theatre Company include &quot;Brownbread&quot; (1987) and &quot;War&quot; (1989), directed by Paul Mercier with set and costume design by Anne Gately. Later plays include &quot;The Woman Who Walked into Doors&quot; (2003); and a rewrite of &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; (2007) with Bisi Adigun. This latter play was the subject of litigation about copyright which ended with the Abbey Theatre agreeing to pay Adigun €600,000.

Screenplays include the television screenplay for &quot;Family&quot; (1994), which was a BBC/RTÉ serial and the forerunner of the 1996 novel &quot;The Woman Who Walked into Doors&quot;. Doyle also authored &quot;When Brendan Met Trudy&quot; (2000), which is a romance about a timid schoolteacher (Brendan) and a free-spirited thief (Trudy).

Doyle has written many short stories, several of which have been published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;; they have also been compiled in two collections. &quot;The Deportees and Other Stories&quot; was published in 2007, while the collection &quot;Bullfighting&quot; was published in 2011. Doyle&#x27;s story &quot;New Boy&quot; was adapted into a 2008 Academy Award-nominated short film directed by Steph Green.

&quot;Rory and Ita&quot; (2002) is a work of non-fiction about Doyle&#x27;s parents, based on interviews with them.

&quot;The Commitments&quot; was adapted by Doyle for a musical which began in the West End in 2013.

&quot;Two Pints&quot; (2017) was produced by the Abbey Theatre initially in pubs and later in the theatre itself.

In 2018 the Gate Theatre commissioned Doyle to write a stage adaptation of &quot;The Snapper&quot;. The show was directed by Róisín McBrinn and was revived in 2019.
