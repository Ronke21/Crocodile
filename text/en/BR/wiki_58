<text>The tomatillo (&quot;Physalis philadelphica&quot; and &quot;Physalis ixocarpa&quot;), also known as the Mexican husk tomato, is a plant of the nightshade family bearing small, spherical, and green or green-purple fruit of the same name. Tomatillos originated in Mexico and were cultivated in the pre-Columbian era. A staple of Mexican cuisine, they are eaten raw and cooked in a variety of dishes, particularly salsa verde. The tomatillo is a perennial plant, but is generally grown for agriculture each year as if it were an annual.

== Names ==
The tomatillo (from Nahuatl, &quot;&quot;) is also known as husk tomato, Mexican groundcherry, large-flowered tomatillo, or Mexican husk tomato. Some of these names, however, can also refer to other species in the genus &quot;Physalis&quot;. Other names are Mexican green tomato and miltomate.

In Spanish, it is called &quot;tomate de cáscara&quot; (husk tomato), &quot;tomate de fresadilla&quot; (little strawberry tomato), &quot;tomate milpero&quot; (field tomato), &quot;tomate verde&quot; (green tomato), &quot;tomatillo&quot; (Mexico; this term means &quot;little tomato&quot; elsewhere), &quot;miltomate&quot; (Mexico, Guatemala), &quot;farolito&quot; (little lantern), or simply &quot;tomate&quot; (in which case the tomato is called &quot;jitomate&quot; from Nahuatl ).

The tomatillo genus name &quot;Physalis&quot; is from New Latin &quot;physalis&quot;, coined by Linnaeus from Ancient Greek φυσαλλίς (&quot;physallís&quot;, &quot;bladder, wind instrument&quot;), itself from φυσιόω (&quot;physióō&quot;, &quot;to puff up, blow up&quot;), (physṓ).

Ixocarpa means &quot;slimy fruit&quot;, referencing a sticky or slimy coat often on a tomatillo before it ruptures from the calyx.

== Distribution ==
Tomatillos are native to Central America and Mexico, having a wild growth range from Mexico to Costa Rica. The plant is grown mostly in the Mexican states of Hidalgo and Morelos, and in the highlands of Guatemala where it is known as &quot;miltomate&quot;. In the United States, tomatillos have been cultivated since 1863, with one dubbed &quot;jamberry&quot; in 1945 and others with the names &quot;Mayan husk tomato&quot; and &quot;jumbo husk tomato&quot;. Further distribution occurred in the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and Florida. By the middle of the 20th century, the plant was further exported to India, Australia, South Africa, and Kenya.

The wild tomatillo and related plants are found everywhere in the Americas except in the far north, with the highest diversity in Mexico. In 2017, scientists reported on their discovery and analysis of &quot;Physalis infinemundi&quot;, a fossil &quot;Physalis&quot; found in the Patagonian region of Argentina, dated to 52 million years BP. The finding has pushed back the earliest appearance of the Solanaceae plant family and the &quot;Physalis&quot; genus of which the tomatillo is a part.

== Cultivation ==

=== History ===

Tomatillos were domesticated in Mexico before the coming of Europeans and played an important part in the culture of the Maya and the Aztecs, more important than the tomato. The specific name &quot;philadelphica&quot; dates to the 18th century.

=== Production ===

There is limited information about tomatillo production, even though tomatillos are distributed and grown worldwide as a home-grown garden plant. Tomatillos are mainly cultivated in outdoor fields in Mexico and Guatemala on a large scale. Smaller crops are planted in many parts of the United States. In Mexico, tomatillos are planted within a wide range of altitudes.

===Soil and climate requirements===

In general, tomatillo plants are tolerant to many different soil conditions. However, they do best in well-drained, sandy, fertile soil conditions with a pH between 5.5 and 7.3. Tomatillo plants are cold sensitive. They grow best at . Below , growth is very poor. Tomatillo plants prefer full sun exposure and warm locations.

===Seedbed requirement and sowing===

Transplanting is the most common practice for planting tomatillo plants. Transplants are produced in greenhouses or transplant beds. Germination occurs at . Transplanting occurs 6 to 8 weeks after seeding and when the risk of frost is past. Transplants produced indoors need to harden off in a warm, sunny place for a few days before being planted outside. Direct outdoor seeding can only be done if no frost risk exists and soil temperature is higher than . Direct outdoor seeding leads to the shortening of the vegetation period. Due to its branching growing pattern, a single plant requires sufficient growing space. Tomatillos are typically grown in rows apart. Although tomatillo is a perennial plant, overwintering is difficult, so it is normally cultivated as an annual plant.

===Fertilization and field management===

Tomatillo plants can reach heights of . Due to their rapid and branching growth, it is recommended to stake them. Staking also facilitates later harvesting and prevents the fruit from touching the ground, which reduces damage to fruit and husk. Staking can also reduce disease and slug damage. Fertilization is recommended at a moderate level. An application of of phosphorus is common. Other nutrients and fertilizers (N/ K) may be required depending on soil type and irrigation. For non-commercial production, regular fertilization is recommended. Although tomatillo plants become more drought-tolerant as they age, regular watering is required. Tomatillo plants require of water per week. Water can come from rainfall or irrigation. Irrigation can be managed by drip, sprinkler, furrow, or watering can. Irrigation frequency depends on weather and the crop&#x27;s growth stage, ranging from once or twice a week to daily during hot weather. Weeds are a serious challenge in tomatillo production and are especially important during the first few weeks. Plastic and organic mulches help to control weeds effectively. Applications of plastic mulches also help to restrict soil water evaporation and modify microclimate, thereby affecting tomatillo growth and yield.

===Harvest and postharvest treatment===

Tomatillos are harvested when the fruits fill the calyx. This state is normally achieved 65 to 100 days after transplanting. Fruit production continues for 1 to 2 months or until the first frost. Harvesting occurs regularly, typically every day, and is done by hand. A plant produces 60 to 200 fruits within a single growing season, with an average yield of about . Tomatillos can be stored for up to three weeks in a cold and humid environment.

==Culinary uses ==
Tomatillos can be harvested at different stages of ripeness. For &quot;salsa verde&quot;, harvesting may be done early when the fruit is sour with a light flavor. Tomatillos can be picked later when the fruits are seedier for a sweeter taste. Tomatillos have diverse uses in stews, soups, salads, curries, stirfries, baking, cooking with meats, marmalade, and desserts.

Tomatillos are a key ingredient in fresh and cooked Mexican and Central-American green sauces. The green color and tart flavor are the main culinary contributions of the fruit. Purple and red-ripening cultivars often have a slight sweetness, unlike the green- and yellow-ripening cultivars, so they generally are used in jams and preserves. Like their close relative, the Cape gooseberry, tomatillos have a high pectin content. Another characteristic is that they tend to have a varying degree of a sappy, sticky coating, mostly when used on the green side out of the husk.

Ripe tomatillos keep refrigerated for about two weeks. They keep longer with the husks removed and the fruit refrigerated in sealed plastic bags. They may also be frozen whole or sliced.

Tomatillos can also be dried to enhance the sweetness of the fruit in a way similar to dried cranberries, with a hint of tomato flavor. The tomatillo flavor is used in fusion cuisines for blending flavors from Latin American dishes with those of Europe and North America.

== Botany ==

=== Description ===
&quot;P. ixocarpa&quot; is often confused with &quot;P. philadelphica&quot; due to morphological similarities and the fact that neither species have had a clear type designation. &quot;Physalis ixocarpa&quot; and &quot;Physalis philadelphica&quot; have blue anthers that twist after opening, a yellow corolla with five blue-tinged spots or smudges, and a 10-ribbed calyx filled or burst by the berry. The two species differ in flower size and stigma type.

&quot;P. philadelphica&quot; grow up to and have few hairs on the stem. The leaves have acute and irregularly separated dents on the side. They are typically about in height, and can be either compact and upright or prostrate with a wider, less dense canopy. The leaves are typically serrated and can be either smooth or pubescent.

=== Classification ===
The tomatillo is a member of the genus &quot;Physalis&quot;, erected by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck described the tomatillo under the name &quot;Physlis philadelphica&quot; in 1786. Other species, such as &quot;P. aeuata&quot; and &quot;P. violacea&quot; were described later. The tomatillo is also often classified as &quot;P. ixocarpa&quot; Brot. However, &quot;P. philadelphica&quot; is the most important species economically. The nomenclature for &quot;Physalis&quot; has changed since the 1950s. &quot;P. philadelphica&quot; was at one time classified as a variety of &quot;P. ixocarpa&quot;. Later, the classification of &quot;P. ixocarpa&quot; was revised under the species of &quot;P. philadelphica&quot;. Today, the name &quot;P. ixocarpa&quot; is commonly used for the domestic plant and &quot;P. philadelphica&quot; for the wild one.

=== Flower ===

Flowers come in several colors: white, light green, bright yellow, and sometimes purple. Flowers may or may not have purple spots toward the center of the corolla. The anthers are typically dark purple to pale blue. Tomatillo plants are highly self-incompatible, and two or more plants are needed for proper pollination. Thus, isolated tomatillo plants rarely set fruit.

=== Fruit ===

The tomatillo fruit is surrounded by an inedible, paper-like husk formed from the calyx. As the fruit matures, it fills the husk and can split it open by harvest time. The husk turns brown, and the fruit can be ripe in several colors, including yellow, green, or even purple. The freshness and greenness of the husk are quality criteria.Flower types:

=== Varieties ===

There are several varieties of tomatillos, with differences in tastes, traits, and ripening colors. Some cultivars include Amarylla, Chupon, Gigante, Green Husk, Mexican, Pineapple, Purple de Milpa, Rio Grande Verde, and Yellow.

=== Genetic ===

==== Self-incompatibility trait ====
Although self-compatibility is common among wild populations, tomatillos carry self-incompatible traits. The plant, i.e., the fertile hermaphrodite, is not able to produce zygotes after self-pollination occurs. This limits the ability to improve tomatillo production regarding the seed quality and the production of varieties.

The self-compatibility gene is situated in the chromosomes of the tomatillo and is not inherited through cytoplasm. Only heterozygous plants can be self-compatible as the trait is controlled by a dominant gene. Tomatillo can thus produce seeds through self-pollination due to the involvement of self-compatibility traits, but the germination viability is different throughout the produced seeds. This suggests that not only incompatible pollen is involved but also inviability at the seedling stage. A study in 2022 using a commercial cultivar found that it was self-compatible and demonstrated incompatibility only in some of the inter-specific hybrid pollinations that were attempted.

== Diseases ==
Tomatillo is generally a resistant crop as long as its climatic requirements are met. However, as with all crops, mass production brings exposure to pests and diseases. As of 2017, two diseases affecting tomatillos have been documented, namely tomato yellow leaf curl virus and turnip mosaic virus. Symptoms of tomato yellow leaf curl virus, including chlorotic margins and interveinal yellowing, were found in several tomato and tomatillo crops in Mexico and Guatemala in 2006. After laboratory tests, the virus was confirmed. Symptomatic plants were associated with the presence of whiteflies, which were likely the cause of this outbreak.

Turnip mosaic virus was discovered in several tomatillo crops in California in 2011, rendering 2% of commercially grown tomatillo plants unmarketable, with severe stunting and leaf distortion. The green peach aphid is a common pest in California, and since it readily transmits the turnip mosaic virus, this could be a threat to tomatillo production in California.

<text>David Lee Marks (born August 22, 1948) is an American guitarist who was an early member of the Beach Boys. While growing up in Hawthorne, California, Marks was a neighborhood friend of the original band members and was a frequent participant at their family get-togethers. Following his departure from the group, Marks fronted the Marksmen and performed and recorded as a session musician.

Marks played music with the brothers from before the band started performing publicly, including the first demo recording for &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot; (recorded as The Pendletones), but he was in schooland his 12-year-old voice was deemed unnecessaryon the October 1961 afternoon the group held the final recording session for the single, released in November 1961 with the new name Beach Boys on the single&#x27;s label. Marks continued with the group, moving to rhythm guitar when Al Jardine left the group in February 1962, recording as a Beach Boy from the band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;, which earned the band a long term contract. He was a Beach Boy for their first four albums, &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; (1962), &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot; (1963), &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; (1963), and &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot; (1963). Despite participating with the group from before they became &quot;the Beach Boys&quot;, and being in the band through their initial success (except for the recording session of their pre-success first single), historians have discounted him as a true founding member of the group. In August 1963, he left the band due to personal problems with manager Murry Wilson. Afterward, Marks worked with acts including Casey Kasem&#x27;s Band Without a Name, the Moon, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Colours, and Warren Zevon, and studied jazz and classical guitar at the Berklee College of Music and the New England Conservatory.

From 1997 to 1999, Marks returned to the Beach Boys for their live performances. In 2007, he released an autobiography, entitled &quot;The Lost Beach Boy&quot;. He reunited with the group for their fiftieth-anniversary tour and the 2012 album &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years===
At age seven, David Lee Marks moved into a house across the street from the family home of the three Wilson brothers, Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, later the founding members of The Beach Boys. Describing the neighborhood, Marks noted, &quot;It was run down. There were no sidewalks. The houses were older and the Wilsons lived in a pretty small, modest two-bedroom home. The boys all shared a bedroom. When they got older, Brian started sleeping in the den more and more, which was a converted garage they had turned into a music room. They had a Hammond B-3 organ, an upright piano, and a little hi-fi in there.&quot;

As the 1950s progressed, Marks sang and played music with the Wilson family at their Sunday night singalongs. Inspired by a 1958 performance by guitarist John Maus (later of the 1960s Walker Brothers), Marks asked his parents to buy him a guitar, which they did on Christmas Eve, 1958. He began taking lessons from Maus, who had been a student of Ritchie Valens.

In 1959, Marks and Brian Wilson&#x27;s youngest brother Carl began to develop their own style of playing electric guitars. Brian realized that the combination of Carl and Marks playing brought a rock guitar sound to his original compositions, and the two teenagers participated in Brian&#x27;s first songwriting efforts that led to the band&#x27;s 1963 hit single &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;.

Marks was not on the Beach Boys first recording, &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot; for Candix Records on October 16, 1961; that roster included Al Jardine, a high school classmate of Brian Wilson&#x27;s, who had been singing and playing stand-up bass with the Wilson brothers and their cousin Mike Love. Over the next couple of months, Brian experimented with different combinations of musicians, including his mother Audree Wilson, but was not able to interest a major label.

Marks joined the Beach Boys in February 1962, replacing Al Jardine who had left (not for dental school as is often stated). Playing rhythm guitar, Marks ended up performing on the band&#x27;s first four albums.

===The Beach Boys===
On April 16, 1962, the Beach Boys recorded a demo session at Western Recorders that produced the masters for the songs &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; and &quot;409&quot;, that became the band&#x27;s first double-sided hit, landing them a long-term contract with Capitol Records.

According to biographer Jon Stebbins, Marks&#x27;s guitar chemistry with Carl Wilson changed the sound of the band. Writing about the difference between the Beach Boys&#x27; Candix Records single and their first Capitol Records release, Stebbins stated: Compared to &#x27;Surfin&#x27;, this was metal. No sign of stand-up bass or folk sensibility on this recording. And the tiny amateurish guitar sound and lazy feel of the [earlier demo] World Pacific version of &#x27;Surfin&#x27; Safari&#x27; had now transformed into something crisp and modern. &quot;It was Carl and Dave who brought that electric guitar drive into the band&quot;, says Al Jardine. &quot;And because of that, Brian was able to expand a little bit.&quot;

Marks continued to sing and play rhythm guitar with the Beach Boys on their first four (plus) albums, including the early hit singles &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;, &quot;409&quot;, &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Shut Down&quot;, &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;, &quot;In My Room&quot;, and &quot;Be True to Your School&quot;. Marks played over 100 concerts with the Beach Boys, toured across the United States with them, and appeared on their first string of national TV appearances. Marks contributed to their tightly knit sound, as well as their youthful look on the early Beach Boys&#x27; album covers.

Although it has been assumed that Marks left the Beach Boys when Jardine returned to the band, this was not exactly the case. Marks and Jardine were both part of the 1963 Beach Boys touring line-up. Jardine returned on a part-time basis to fill-in on bass for Brian Wilson, who had already begun to detach himself from the touring band as early as the spring of 1963.

At the height of their first wave of international success, Marks quit the Beach Boys in late August 1963 toward the end of the group&#x27;s summer tour during an argument with Murry Wilson, the Wilson boys&#x27; father and the band&#x27;s manager, but did not immediately leave the band until later that year when his parents and Murry came to blows over financial and managerial issues. The first show without Marks on guitar was October 19, 1963, though he would stay friends and be in close contact with various band members for many years, and he would remain, unbeknownst to him, a legal member of the Beach Boys until September 27, 1967.

===Post-Beach Boys career===
In February 1963, Dennis Wilson was injured in a car accident. His replacement was Mark Groseclose, who went to high school with Carl Wilson. Marks and Groseclose became friends and Marks eventually took over Groseclose&#x27;s garage band, the Jaguars, which he renamed the Marksmen. The band was initially a side project for the aspiring songwriter, who was growing tired of his songs being passed over for Beach Boys records by Murry Wilson.

After Marks left the Beach Boys, the Marksmen became his full-time focus, and one of the first acts to be signed to Herb Alpert&#x27;s A&amp;M Records in 1964. Murry Wilson reportedly threatened radio deejays in order to keep them from playing the Marksmen&#x27;s records. Later, the group signed with (and released a single on) Warner Bros. Records, but in spite of packed concert venues up and down the state of California, lack of airplay precluded any further releases. The 2009 release of &quot;Marks &amp; the Marksmen Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition 1963–1965&quot; marks the first-time the entire Marksmen catalog was made available to the public.

In 1966, Marks played with Casey Kasem&#x27;s Band Without a Name. He then worked with the late 1960s psychedelic pop band, The Moon, along with Matt Moore, Larry Brown, and David Jackson. The band signed a production deal with producer Mike Curb and released two under-promoted albums on the Imperial label. He also performed with Delaney and Bonnie, Colours (recording lead guitar on their second album), and Warren Zevon. By the time Marks was 21 years old, he had been signed to five label deals and had grown disillusioned with the Los Angeles music scene. In 1969, he relocated to Boston, where he studied jazz and classical guitar as a private student at the Berklee College of Music and the New England Conservatory of Music in 1970–71.

===Since 1971===
In early 1971, after reuniting onstage in Boston with the Beach Boys, despite a chilly reception from both the public and Bruce Johnston, Marks received an offer from Mike Love to rejoin the band but he declined. Instead, he spent the next 25 years playing with artists like Buzz Clifford, Daniel Moore (writer of &quot;My Maria&quot; and &quot;Shambala&quot;), Gary Montgomery, Jim Keltner, Carl Radle, Leon Russell, drummer-turned-actor Gary Busey, Delbert McClinton, Warren Zevon, and many others, earning a reputation as a solid session guitarist without cashing in on his notoriety as having been a Beach Boy. Marks briefly played lead guitar for Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends, but was let go and replaced by Eric Clapton. Marks was also offered the lead guitarist spot in Paul Revere and the Raiders, but turned down the offer because he did not want to dress up in a revolutionary war-era costume every time he played a show. Marks was a close friend of Warren Zevon for years until they had a falling-out. In 1988, when the Beach Boys were inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Marks was neither invited nor acknowledged at the ceremony, an oversight which was reportedly finally rectified in 2007.

Marks rejoined the Beach Boys as a full-time member playing lead guitar in 1997, when Carl Wilson, fighting cancer, was unable to continue touring with the group. After playing another 300 shows as an official Beach Boy, Marks left the band a second time in 1999 due to his own health issues when he was diagnosed with hepatitis C.

Marks became a leader in the hepatitis C community, appearing in the media to raise awareness of the disease. In 2007, Marks co-wrote &quot;The Lost Beach Boy&quot; with Stebbins, which detailed his early career and related his &quot;lost years&quot;, his health problems, his musical development, and his recovery and acceptance within the Beach Boys community.

On May 20, 2005, the Beach Boys six-man line-up including both Marks and Jardine, was memorialized on the Beach Boys Historic Landmark in Hawthorne, California. The following year, on June 13, 2006, Marks gathered with surviving Beach Boys Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, Mike Love, and Bruce Johnston on the roof of the landmark Capitol Records building in Hollywood, where all five were presented with an RIAA Platinum record Award in recognition of two million in sales of the Beach Boys CD song collection &quot;Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys&quot;. In 2008, following the release of a career retrospective, &quot;The Lost Years&quot; (released to coincide with his book), he toured the UK as a &quot;special guest&quot; with the Beach Boys. He has also semi-regularly performed with Jardine and Dean Torrence of Jan &amp; Dean, in the &quot;Legends of Surf Music&quot; tour, with the Surf City All-Stars.

On December 16, 2011, it was announced that Marks would be reuniting with Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, and Bruce Johnston for a new Beach Boys album and 50th anniversary tour in 2012. The group appeared at the 2012 Grammy Awards on February 12, followed by a 50-date tour that began in Tucson, Arizona in April. Mike Love commented on working with Marks once again, stating, &quot;David rocks. A phenomenal guitarist. When he does those leads on &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;, and &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot; it&#x27;s so authentic. He and Carl committed on playing guitar since they were ten years old and were neighbors with each other from across the street in Hawthorne. He&#x27;s a fantastic musician and a really fantastic guy to be with. He went through his issues with alcohol, but he&#x27;s completely cooled out for maybe ten years now. It&#x27;s going to be really great to be with him.&quot; Marks took over lead vocal duties on the songs &quot;Hawaii&quot; and &quot;Getcha Back&quot; during the anniversary tour.

Also in 2012, Marks released the album &quot;The Circle Continues&quot;, which featured a guest appearance from Jardine on vocals on the song &quot;I Sail Away&#x27;.

In June 2013, Brian Wilson&#x27;s website announced that he was recording and self-producing new material with Jardine, Marks, former Beach Boys member Blondie Chaplin, Don Was, and Jeff Beck. It stated that the material might be split into three albums: one of new pop songs, another of mostly instrumental tracks with Beck, and another of interwoven tracks dubbed &quot;the suite&quot; which initially began form as the closing four tracks of &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot;. Released in April 2015, &quot;No Pier Pressure&quot; marked another collaboration between Wilson and Joe Thomas, featuring guest appearances from Jardine, Marks, Chaplin, and others. 

Following the 50th anniversary reunion tour, it was announced that Marks along with Wilson and Jardine would no longer tour with Johnston and Love; instead, Marks appeared with Jardine and Wilson along with Wilson&#x27;s band for a short summer tour in 2013 featuring the three. On the tour Marks sang &quot;Little Bird&quot;, &quot;Forever&quot;, &quot;This Car of Mine&quot;, and &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;. During the fall, Wilson, Jardine, and Marks joined guitar legend Jeff Beck for a 23 city tour, the foursome appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to promote their tour. 

Marks and his wife, Carrieann, relocated to southern California in 2013 after living for a decade in North Salem, New York.

Jardine, Marks, Johnston, and Love appeared together at the 2014 Ella Awards Ceremony, where Love was honored for his work as a singer. Marks also made other appearances with Love and Johnston&#x27;s touring Beach Boys group in 2014 and 2015.

Marks has been relatively inactive since 2015. In 2017, Marks made an appearance as himself on an episode of &quot;Decker&quot;.

In July 2018, Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, Marks, and Johnston, Marks reunited for a one-off Q&amp;A session moderated by director Rob Reiner at the Capitol Records Tower in Los Angeles. It was the first time the band had appeared together in public since their 2012 tour.

In 2019, he performed with Jardine at the &quot;California Saga 2&quot; event to raise money for the homeless.

In April 2021, Omnivore Recordings released &quot;California Music Presents Add Some Music&quot;, an album featuring Love, Jardine, Marks, Johnston, and several children of the original Beach Boys (most notably on a re-recording of The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Add Some Music to Your Day&quot; from 1970&#x27;s &quot;Sunflower&quot;). The re-recording of “Add Some Music To Your Day” was the first studio recording to feature Mike Love, Al Jardine, Johnston, and Marks together since the end of the 2011-2012 50th anniversary reunion Also in 2021, he sued Universal Music for shortchanging him on royalties from foreign streaming revenue.

In January 2023, the tribute concert mentioned by Azoff in 2021 was announced as being part of the &quot;Grammys Salute&quot; series of televised tribute concerts. On February 8—three days after the 2023 Grammy award ceremonies, &quot;A Grammy Salute to the Beach Boys&quot; was recorded at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California and subsequently aired as a two-hour special on CBS on April 9. Present for the taping were Wilson, Jardine, Marks, Johnston, and Love—this time not as performers but as featured guests, seated in a luxury box at the theatre, overlooking tribute performances covering the gamut of their catalog by mostly contemporary artists. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the program had 5.18 million viewers.

In March 2024, the band announced the release of a self-titled documentary which would be released by streaming service Disney+, which includes new and archived interviews from various members of the band and their inner circle, including Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, Marks, Johnston, Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson, Chaplin, Ricky Fataar, Brian Wilson&#x27;s ex-wife Marilyn, and Don Was, among others. The documentary was directed by Frank Marshall and Thom Zimny and was released on May 24, 2024. The documentary included some footage from a private reunion of Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, Marks, and Johnston at Paradise Cove, where the &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; album cover photo was taken in 1962. Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, Marks, Johnston, and Blondie Chaplin also participated in a non-performing reunion at the documentary&#x27;s premiere on May 24, 2024.

<text>The Armenian Catholic Church is an Eastern Catholic particular church &quot;sui iuris&quot; of the Catholic Church. It accepts the leadership of the bishop of Rome, and is therefore in full communion with the universal Catholic Church, including the Latin Church and the 22 other Eastern Catholic Churches. The Armenian Catholic Church is regulated by Eastern canon law, summed up in the &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot;.

The head of the &quot;sui iuris&quot; Armenian Catholic Church is the Armenian Catholic patriarch of Cilicia, whose main cathedral and &quot;de facto&quot; archiepiscopal see is the Cathedral of Saint Elias and Saint Gregory the Illuminator, in Beirut, Lebanon.

Armenian Caritas is the official aid organisation of the Catholic Church in Armenia.

== History ==
The Armenian Church took issue with the 451 Council of Chalcedon and formally broke off communion with the Chalcedonian Churches at the 3rd Synod of Dvin in 610. Some Armenian bishops and congregations made attempts to restore communion with the Chalcedonian Churches after the 6th Ecumenical Council of 681. During the Crusades in 1198, the Church of the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia entered into union with the Catholic Church, an attempt that did not last. The union was later re-established during the Council of Florence in 1439, but did not have any real effects for centuries.

Some Armenians converted to Catholicism, and in the absence of any specific Armenian Catholic Church in effect became Latins. In medieval China, local Armenians were converted to Catholicism by John of Montecorvino in Beijing and there was also an Armenian Franciscan Catholic community in Quanzhou.

In 1740, Abraham-Pierre I Ardzivian, who had earlier become a Catholic, was elected as the patriarch of Sis. Two years later, Pope Benedict XIV formally established the Armenian Catholic Church. In 1749, the Armenian Catholic Church built a convent in Bzoummar, Lebanon. During the Armenian genocide in 1915–1918, the Church was scattered in neighboring countries, mainly in Lebanon and Syria.

An Armenian Catholic community was also previously formed by Armenians living in Poland in the 1630s. The Armenian bishop of Leopolis (see Armenian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv), Nicholas (Polish: Mikołaj) Torosowicz had entered into union with the Catholic Church. The community which had been historically centered in Galicia as well as in the pre-1939 Polish borderlands in the east, was expelled after World War II to present-day Poland and now has three parishes: in Gdańsk, in Gliwice and in Warsaw.

There is also a history of conversion of Armenians in Transylvania, which went hand in hand with their acculturation under Hungarian influence and policies (see Gherla and Dumbrăveni). Their descendants are part of the Armenian community of modern-day Romania and are tended to by the Ordinariate for Armenian Catholics of Romania.

== Liturgy and practices ==

The Armenian Rite liturgy, as celebrated in the Armenian language, developed prior to the post-Chalcedonian interruption of communion and hence is historically common to all Armenian Christians. It is patterned after the directives of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, founder and patron saint of the Armenian Church. It is used by both the Armenian Apostolic Church, by the Armenian Catholic Church, and by a significant number of Eastern Catholic Christians in the Republic of Georgia. Unlike the Byzantine Church, church buildings of the Armenian rite usually have only a few icons, but like some other Eastern churches have a barrier concealing the priest and the altar from the people during parts of the liturgy. The use of bishop&#x27;s mitre is reminiscent of the influence Western missionaries once had upon both the miaphysite Orthodox Armenians as well as upon the Armenian Rite Catholics.

== Armenian Catholic communities ==
Apart from Armenia, Georgia and Russia, the Armenian Catholic Church is found widely in the Armenian diaspora, notably in Lebanon (where the Armenian Catholic Church is headquartered), Syria, Egypt, Turkey, Iran, France, U.S.A., Canada, Argentina, Uruguay and Australia.

=== Armenia, Georgia and Eastern Europe ===
Armenian Catholics originated in what is today Armenia, Georgia and Eastern Europe. Beginning in the late 1920s, persecution caused many Armenian Catholics to emigrate. In 1991, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Bishop of Rome, Pope John Paul II merged the communities in Georgia and Russia with those in Armenia, creating the new Ordinariate for Catholics of Armenian Rite in Eastern Europe, with its residence in Gyumri. The city was not chosen by chance: most Catholic Armenians live in the northern parts of Armenia. This has become a kind of basis for fence-mending with the coreligionists on the other side of the border.

Today Catholic Armenians of Samtskhe-Javakheti live together in Akhaltsikhe and in the nearby villages, as well as in the regions of Akhalkalaki and Ninotsminda. The communities in the last two regions, which are mainly rural, are found in rather distant areas, but the most important link is the historical memory of Catholicism.

A small seminary was established in Gyumri, Armenia, in 1994; there candidates for the priesthood engage in basic studies before moving to the Pontifical College of the Armenians (established 1885) in Rome, where they pursue philosophy and theology.

There are also tens of thousands of Armenian Catholics in Russia, due to the extensive migration from Armenia to Russia that has occurred since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

=== United States and Canada ===
Currently around 1.5 million Armenians live in North America, of which 35,000 belong to the Armenian Catholic Church.

In the 19th century Catholic Armenians from Western Armenia, mainly from the towns and cities of Karin (Erzurum), and from Constantinople and Mardin, traveled to the United States seeking employment. By the end of that century, many survivors of the Hamidian Massacres had concentrated in several U.S. cities, chiefly in New York.
Catholic Armenian communities were also founded in New Jersey, in Boston and Detroit, as in Los Angeles and other cities of California.

Catholic Armenian educational organizations were also founded in many cities. In Philadelphia and Boston, colleges were founded by Armenian sisters, educating hundreds of children. Later, a similar college was founded in Los Angeles. The Mechitarists in particular were preoccupied with the problem of preserving Armenian identity. With the support of the Mekhitarists of Venice and Vienna, the Mekhitarian College was founded in Los Angeles.

Many Armenians came to the United States and Canada from the Middle Eastern countries of Lebanon and Syria in the 1970s and in later years. Moreover, many Armenians migrated from Argentina, because of the economic crisis there. At the same time, many Catholic Armenians moved within the United States to San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Miami and Indianapolis.

In 2005, by Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s decision, the &quot;Catholic Exarchate of the USA and Canada&quot; was raised to the status of a diocese. It serviced 35,000 Catholic Armenians in the United States and some 10,000 in Canada. Manuel Batakian became the bishop, or eparch, of the diocese, which has jurisdiction over Canadian and American Catholics who are members of the Armenian Catholic Church, . According to a news release by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published on Monday, May 23, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI, named Archpriest Mikaël Antoine Mouradian, superior of the Convent of Notre Dame in Bzommar, Lebanon, as the new bishop of the Eparchy of Our Lady of Nareg in New York for Armenian Catholics. The appointment of Lebanon-born Bishop Mouradian was publicized in Washington on May 21 by Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Apostolic Nuncio to the United States.

=== France ===
Next to North America, France holds the largest number of Armenian Catholics outside the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The Eparchy of Sainte-Croix-de-Paris was established in 1960 with Bishop Garabed Armadouni as exarch. Since 1977, the eparchy has been led by Bishop Krikor Gabroyan.

There are some 30,000 Armenian Catholics in the eparchy, the headquarters of which are in Paris. Apart from the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Paris, the eparchy has six churches: in Arnouville-lès-Gonesse, Lyon, Marseille, Saint-Chamond, Sèvres and Valence. A community of Mekhitarist Fathers resides in Sèvres and a convent of Armenian Sisters of the Immaculate Conception runs a school in Marseille.

=== Brazil ===
The Catholic Armenian Community of São Paulo was founded in 1935, as the &quot;Chaplaincy of the Catholic Armenian Mission&quot;, responding to requests from Armenian immigrants who had settled in Brazil since 1923, mostly from Marach, actually a city of Turkey. The church is between the metro stations Armênia and Tiradentes, at Tiradentes Avenue #718.

== Demographics ==

Estimates from the 19th century varied between 40.000 to 150.000 Armenian Catholics worldwide, and 136,400 in 1911

Independent sources estimate the number of Catholic Armenians in the early 21st century at 150,000, with sizable communities in Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Jerusalem, France and the United States.

== Structure ==

The Armenian Catholic Church is divided into Archdioceses, Eparchies, Apostolic Exarchates, Ordinariates for the Faithful of the Eastern Rite and Patriarchal Exarchates, each of which has functions similar to a diocese.

=== Current hierarchy ===
The Armenian Catholic Patriarchate of the See of Cilicia is the supreme authority of the Armenian Catholic Church. On 23 September 2021, Raphaël Bedros XXI Minassian was elected as the Church&#x27;s new patriarch.

Below is a list of the jurisdictions with their number of adherents.

==== Titular Metropolitan Archeparchies ====
Achrida (Ohrid), Pessinus, Traianopolis in Rhodope

==== Titular Eparchies ====
Adana, Amida, Anazarbus, Ancyra, Artvin, Cesarea in Cappadocia, Garin, Kharput, Marasc, Melitene, Mush, Prusa, Tokat, Trapezus

== Publications ==

*&quot;Avedik&quot;, the official organ of the church
*&quot;Avedaper Verelk&quot;, a religious, spiritual and cultural publication of St. Gregory Armenian Catholic Church
*&quot;Avedaper&quot;, a weekly bulletin of the Armenian Catholic dioceses

<text>Izieu () is a commune in the Ain department in eastern France. It lies on the river Rhône, between the cities of Lyon and Chambéry.

The Commune is famous for the 1944 abduction by the Nazis of the children and staff from the Izieu orphanage.

==Site of World War II Jewish orphanage==

Izieu was the site of a Jewish orphanage during the Second World War. However, most of the children were only separated from their parents or sent purposely in the Savoy mountains which was then under Italian rule. Italy was less oppressive in that time. On 6 April 1944, three vehicles pulled up in front of the orphanage. The Gestapo, under the direction of the &#x27;Butcher of Lyon&#x27; Klaus Barbie, entered the orphanage and forcibly removed the forty-four children and their seven supervisors, throwing the crying and terrified children on to the trucks.

As a witness later recalled: &#x27;I was on my way down the stairs when my sister shouted to me: It&#x27;s the Germans, run away! I jumped out the window. I hid myself in a bush in the garden. I heard the cries of the children that were being kidnapped and I heard the shouts of the Nazis who were carrying them away.&#x27;

Following the raid on their home in Izieu, the children were shipped directly to the &quot;collection center&quot; in Drancy, then put on the first available train towards the concentration camps in the East.

Forty-two children and five adults were gassed in the concentration camp of Auschwitz. Two of the oldest children and Miron Zlatin, the superintendent, ended up in Tallinn, Estonia, and were killed by a firing squad.

The orphanage director Sabine Zlatin survived the Gestapo raid, being away collecting funds for the institution. Some 40 years later she testified against Barbie at his trial. Towards the end of her life, she convinced the president François Mitterrand to turn the orphanage premises into a memorial.

<text>Gérard Latortue (; 19 June 1934 – 27 February 2023) was a Haitian politician and diplomat who served as the prime minister of Haiti from 12 March 2004 to 9 June 2006. He was an official in the United Nations for many years, and briefly served as foreign minister of Haiti during the short-lived 1988 administration of Leslie Manigat.

== Career ==
In February 2004, the country experienced a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; which saw the removal and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Breaking with the Haitian constitution a &quot;council of the wise&quot; was set up by the international powers to choose a new Prime Minister. Latortue was selected by the council and appointed head of the interim government on 9 March while still living in the United States, and was sworn in on 12 March.

His administration was recognized by the United Nations, the United States, France, and Canada. He was denied recognition by the governments of Jamaica, Venezuela, and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). His government was beset with opposition from the Fanmi Lavalas political party (and with them, a large amount of the Haitian populace) and violence by and between gangs, rebels, and militants (especially in Port-au-Prince and its metropolitan area), many of whom are either former members of the Haitian Armed Forces (disbanded by Aristide in 1995) or street gang supporters of the Aristide government &quot;Chimere&quot;.

The 2006 elections in Haiti, to replace the interim government of Latortue established after the 2004 Haitian coup d&#x27;état, were delayed four times after having been originally scheduled for October and November 2005. The elections finally took place on 7 February 2006. The 129 member Haitian Parliament was also elected at this election. Run-off elections for the Chamber of Deputies of Haiti were held on 21 April 2006. In June 2006, Latortue was succeeded by Jacques-Édouard Alexis.

Latortue was the head of the observer mission of La Francophonie in Togo for that country&#x27;s October 2007 parliamentary election.

==Personal life and death==
Latortue had three children. His daughter, Alexia, currently serves in the United States Department of the Treasury.

Latortue died after a fall on 27 February 2023, at the age of 88.

<doc id="523404" wikidata="Q1048171" url="?curid=523404" title="Uakari">
<text>Uakari (, ) is the common name for the New World monkeys from the genus Cacajao. Both the English and scientific names are believed to have originated from indigenous languages.

The uakaris are unusual among New World monkeys in that their tail length (15–18 cm) is substantially shorter than their head and body length (40–45 cm). Their bodies are covered with long, loose hair but their heads are bald. They have almost no subcutaneous fat, so their bald faces appear almost skull-like. Like their closest relatives the saki monkeys, they have projecting lower incisors. These monkeys have the most striking red facial skin of any primate. Females choose their mates based on how red the male&#x27;s face is. Evidence suggests that the red facial coloration reflects the health of the primate.

The four species of uakari currently recognized are all found in the north-western Amazon basin. The bald uakari, remarkable for its brilliant scarlet complexion, is found north of the Amazon River, and south of the Japurá River in the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve. The black-headed uakari is found north of the Amazon and south of the Rio Negro. The Neblina uakari is found north of the Rio Negro, west of the Rio Marauiá and east of the Casiquiare canal. The Aracá uakari is currently known only from the Rio Curuduri basin.

They have been observed both in small groups and in larger troops of up to 100. When traveling through the forest they move in the lower branches of the trees, though when foraging they also go up to the canopy. They mostly eat fruit, and unlike other Neotropical frugivores will consume a large amount of unripe fruit for which they have specialised dentition. They also eat flowers, seeds, invertebrates, buds and leaves.

Uakari are found in neotropical Amazon flooded or riparian forests, including Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela.

A phylogeographic reconstruction found that the concestor of living uakari dates to 1.7 million years ago, in the Solimões River, whence they spread and diversified following intermittent river rearrangements.

==Species==
There are four species from the Genus &quot;Cacajao&quot;:
* Genus &quot;Cacajao&quot;
** Bald uakari or red uakari, &quot;C. calvus&quot;
*** &quot;Cacajao calvus calvus&quot;
*** &quot;Cacajao calvus ucayalii&quot;
*** &quot;Cacajao calvus rubicundus&quot;
*** &quot;Cacajao calvus novaesi&quot;
*Black-headed uakari species group
** Golden-backed or black-headed uakari, &quot;Cacajao melanocephalus&quot;
** Aracá uakari, &quot;Cacajao ayresi&quot;*
** Neblina uakari, &quot;Cacajao hosomi&quot;*

In 2014 Ferrari &quot;et al.&quot; proposed an alternative taxonomy for the &quot;C. melanocephalus&quot; group which recognizes the Aracá uakari as a subspecies of the golden-backed uakari, and also recognized &quot;Cacajao ouakary&quot; as a separate species, whereas current consensus is that &quot;C. ouakary&quot; is a junior synonym of &quot;C. melanocephalus&quot;. This revision is not universally accepted.

<text>Lake Maninjau (, meaning &quot;overlook&quot; or &quot;observation&quot; in the Minangkabau language) is a caldera lake in West Sumatra, Indonesia. It is located to the west of Bukittinggi, at .

==Formation==
The Maninjau caldera was formed by a volcanic eruption estimated to have occurred around 52,000 years ago. Deposits from the eruption have been found in a radial distribution around Maninjau extending up to to the east, to the southeast, and west to the present coastline. The deposits are estimated to be distributed over and have a volume of . The caldera has a length of and a width of .

==The lake==
Lake Maninjau has an area of , being approximately long and wide. The average depth is , with a maximum depth of . The natural outlet for excess water is the Antokan river, located on the west side of the lake. It is the only lake in Sumatra which has a natural outlet to the west coast. Since 1983, this water has been used to generate hydroelectric power for West Sumatra, generated around 68 MW at maximum load.

Most of the people who live around Lake Maninjau are ethnically Minangkabau. Villages on the shores of the lake include Maninjau and Bayur.

Maninjau is a notable tourist destination in the region due to its scenery and mild climate. It is also a site for paragliding.

==Local fishing and agriculture==
Two endemic species collected from the lake for local consumption and for export to markets outside the crater are &quot;pensi&quot;, a species of small mussel, and &quot;palai rinuak&quot;, a type of small fish. One method of preparing &quot;palai rinuak&quot; is to grill a mixture of the fish along with coconut and spices, wrapped in a banana leaf.

The lake is used for aquaculture, using &quot;karamba&quot; floating net cages. The technique was introduced in 1992 and, by 1997, there were over 2,000 cage units with over 600 households engaged. Each cage may have 3-4 production cycles each year. There is evidence of pollution around some &quot;karamba&quot; areas.

On the edge of the lake, land use includes rice fields in the swamps and the lower slopes. The villages are bordered uphill by a large belt of forest-like tree gardens, which dissolve into the upper montane forest on the steepest parts of the slopes up to the ridge of the caldera.

The tree gardens include three typical components:
* Fruit trees including durian, jack fruit, cempedak, rambutan, langsat, golden berries and water apples.
* Timber species including Toona sinensis and Pterospermum javanicum.
* Spice trees including cinnamon, coffee, nutmeg and cardamum.

==Sukarno&#x27;s pantun==
The first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, visited the area in early June 1948. A &quot;pantun&quot; he wrote about the lake reads:

<text>Piccadilly is a 1929 British silent and sound drama film directed by E.A. Dupont, written by Arnold Bennett and starring Gilda Gray, Anna May Wong, and Jameson Thomas. The film was shot on location in London, produced by British International Pictures.

This film initially was released as a silent in February 1929 but was largely ignored due to the general public&#x27;s apathy to silent films. Due to the popularity of sound films, Wardour Films re-released the film in June of the same year for cinemas wired for sound. This version included a music score and sound effects by Harry Gordon, along with a five-minute sound prologue titled &quot;Prologue to Piccadilly&quot; that was added to the beginning of the film, featuring just two actors: Jameson Thomas who plays Valentine Wilmot in the film and John Longden as the man from China. The part-talkie was the version that was exhibited in the United States, released by Sono Art-World Wide Pictures in July 1929. The majority of people in 1929 saw the sound version and this is the version that survives.

==Plot==

Valentine Wilmot&#x27;s Piccadilly Circus, a nightclub and restaurant in London, is a great success due to his star attraction: dancing partners Mabel and Vic. One night, a dissatisfied diner disrupts Mabel&#x27;s solo with his loud complaints about a dirty plate. When Wilmot investigates, he finds Shosho distracting the other dishwashers with her dancing. He fires her on the spot.

After the performance, Vic tries to persuade Mabel to become his partner personally as well as professionally and to go to Hollywood with him. She coldly rebuffs him because she is romantically involved with Wilmot. That night, Wilmot summons Vic to his office, and before Wilmot can fire him, Vic quits.

This decision turns out to be disastrous for the nightclub. The customers had come to see Vic, not Mabel. Business drops off dramatically. In desperation, Wilmot hires Shosho to perform a Chinese dance. She insists that her boyfriend Jim play the accompanying music. Shosho is an instant sensation, earning a standing ovation after her first performance.

Both Mabel and Jim become jealous of the evident attraction between Shosho and Wilmot. Mabel breaks off her relationship with Wilmot.

One night, Shosho invites Wilmot to be the first to see her new rooms. Mabel has followed the couple and waits outside. After Wilmot leaves, she persuades Jim to let her in. She pleads with her romantic rival to give Wilmot up, saying he is too old for her, but Shosho replies that it is Mabel who is too old and that she will keep him. When Mabel reaches into her purse for a handkerchief, Shosho sees a pistol inside and grabs a dagger used as a wall decoration. Frightened, Mabel picks up the gun, then faints.

The next day, the newspapers report that Shosho has been murdered. Wilmot is charged with the crime. During the ensuing trial, he admits that the pistol is his, but refuses to divulge what happened that night. Jim testifies that Wilmot was Shosho&#x27;s only visitor. Mabel insists on telling her story. However, she can recall nothing after fainting until she found herself running in the streets. Realizing that either Mabel or Jim must be lying, the judge summons Jim. By then, however, Jim has shot himself next to Shosho&#x27;s coffin. As he lies dying, he confesses that he killed Shosho.

==Cast==
* Gilda Gray as Mabel Greenfield
* Anna May Wong as Shosho
* Jameson Thomas as Valentine Wilmot
* Charles Laughton as a nightclub diner
* Ray Milland as extra in nightclub scene
* Cyril Ritchard as Victor Smiles (as Cyrill Ritchard)
* King Hou Chang as Jim (as King Ho Chang)
* Hannah Jones as Bessie, Shosho&#x27;s friend and dishwashing supervisor
* John Longden as the man from China (uncredited, appears in the sound prologue)

==Reception==
In his 15 July 1929 review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Mordaunt Hall observed: &quot;Perhaps the greatest asset of &quot;Piccadilly&quot; comes from the camera. Mr. Dupont is noted for his unusual touches, and he has not spared them in this production. Even the opening, which ordinarily is but a staid, prosaic list of characters, has become almost a part of the picture. The director has managed to get the most from his situations without overdoing them. Mr. Bennett…has retained in his story the verisimilitude which would be necessary in a novel. The actions are all motivated and swing freely forward without dismal hurdles or detours. … Miss Gray seems to have been rediscovered as an actress. …(She) found it necessary to flee to English studios to have a chance. Of the players besides Miss Gray and Miss Wong, King Ho-Chang gives a good performance as the friend of the Chinese dancer. He is said to be a restaurant owner who went into the picture just for amusement, but he appears to be a finished actor.&quot; Hall found that the additional sound and sound effects that &quot;encumbered&quot; the film in its U.S. showing were &quot;distracting&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes rates the film 79% fresh, based on 24 contemporary and modern reviews.

Writing for the British Film Institute, BFI Senior Curator Mark Duguid says: &quot;A &quot;film noir&quot; before the term was in use, &quot;Piccadilly&quot; is one of the true greats of British silent films, on a par with the best work of Anthony Asquith or Alfred Hitchcock in the period … notable for qualities not typically associated with British silent films: opulence, passion and a surprisingly direct approach to issues of race … For all its style and grace, the film&#x27;s strongest suit is Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong … arguably never better used than here. To Wong&#x27;s frustration, Shosho and Valentine&#x27;s kiss was cut to appease the US censor ... Naturally, &quot;Piccadilly&quot;&#x27;s publicity made much of Wong&#x27;s exotic beauty: one contemporary poster—for the film&#x27;s Austrian release—carries an illustration of the star dancing topless. It would have been unthinkable to portray a white actress in this way and, needless to say, no such image appears in the film.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2004, the film was re-released by Milestone Films after a partial restoration of the picture portion only. The original soundtrack was muted and replaced with a modern music score that in no way resembled the original music-and-sound effects soundtrack. The film has appeared in this modified form in 2004 at film festivals nationwide, and in 2005, it was released on DVD. The film has yet to be restored with its original sound. Only the sound to the talking prologue is available on the DVD. The DVD distributor decided to remove the original soundtrack as the sound version of &quot;Piccadilly&quot; is not in the public domain as it was copyrighted by Sono Art-World Wide Pictures but never renewed. The new soundtrack is copyrighted.

<doc id="523422" wikidata="Q1348890" url="?curid=523422" title="2000 Russian presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Russia on 26 March 2000. Incumbent prime minister and acting president Vladimir Putin, who had succeeded Boris Yeltsin after his resignation on 31 December 1999, sought a four-year term in his own right and won in the first round.

As of 2024, this is the last Russian presidential election in which losers (Gennady Zyuganov and Aman Tuleyev) carried federal subjects. In all subsequent presidential elections, the winner carried all federal subjects.

==Background==
In spring 1998, Boris Yeltsin dismissed his long-time head of government, Viktor Chernomyrdin, replacing him with Sergey Kirienko. Months later, in the wake of the August 1998 economic crisis in which the government defaulted on its debt and devalued the rouble simultaneously, Kirienko was replaced in favor of Yevgeny Primakov. In May 1999, Primakov was replaced with Sergei Stepashin. Then in August 1999, Vladimir Putin was named prime minister, making him the fifth in less than two years. Putin was not expected to last long in the role and was initially unknown and unpopular due to his ties to the Yeltsin government and state security. In the late summer and early fall of 1999, a wave of apartment bombings across Russia killed hundreds and injured thousands. The bombings, blamed on the Chechens, provided the opportunity for Putin to position himself as a strong and aggressive leader, capable of dealing with the Chechen threat.

Yeltsin had become exceedingly unpopular. Yeltsin was increasingly concerned about the Skuratov, Mercata and Mabetex scandals that had prompted articles of impeachment. He narrowly survived impeachment in May 1999. In mid-1999, Yevgeny Primakov and Yuri Luzhkov were considered the frontrunners for the presidency. Both were critical of Yeltsin, and he feared that they might prosecute him and his family for corruption should they ascend to power. Primakov had suggested that he would be “freeing up jail cells for the economic criminals he planned to arrest.”

On December 19, 1999, the Kremlin&#x27;s Unity Party finished second in the parliamentary elections with 23 percent; the Communist Party was first with 24 percent. By forming a coalition with Yabloko and the Union of Right Forces, Yeltsin had secured a favorable majority in the Duma. By the December election, Putin&#x27;s popularity had risen to 79% with 42% saying they would vote for him for president.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999, Yeltsin announced that he would be resigning early in the belief that “Russia should enter the new millennium with new politicians, new faces, new people, who are intelligent, strong and energetic, while we, those who have been in power for many years, must leave.” In accordance with the constitution, Putin became acting president.

The elections would be held on 26 March 2000, as Russian law required an election to be scheduled three months after the office of president is vacated. Before Yeltsin&#x27;s resignation, the 2000 presidential election had been expected to be held in June or July. The Duma had originally passed legislation scheduling the first round of the election for June 4, with a runoff scheduled for June 25 if necessitated.

In early 2000 Unity and the Communist Party had developed an alliance in the Duma that effectively cut off Putin&#x27;s rivals, Yevgeny Primakov, Grigory Yavlinsky, and Sergei Kiriyenko. Yuri Luzhkov, the reelected Mayor of Moscow, announced that he would not compete for the presidency; Primakov pulled out two weeks after the parliamentary elections. The early election also reduced the chances that public sentiment would turn against the conflict in Chechnya.

===New campaign law===
A new federal law, &quot;On the election of the president of the Russian Federation&quot; was passed in December 1999. It required that candidates gather a million signatures to be nominated (although the shortened election meant this was reduced to 500,000). A majority in the first round was enough to win. Failing that, a second round of voting between the top two candidates would be decided by majority vote. The new law also created stricter campaign finance provisions. The new law, in conjunction with the early election would have further helped Putin, who could rely on favorable state television coverage.

==Candidates==
Of 33 candidates nominated, 15 submitted application forms to the Central Electoral Committee of Russia, which registered 12. They are listed in the Russian alphabetical order they appeared on the ballot.
===Withdrawn===
==Campaign==
Gennady Zyuganov and Grigory Yavlinsky were the two strongest opposition candidates. Zyuganov ran on a platform of resistance to wholesale public ownership, though he supported a return of illegally privatized property to the state. He opposed public land ownership and advocated for strong public services to be provided by the state. He would also strengthen the country&#x27;s defense capabilities and would resist expansion by the United States and NATO. Grigorii Yavlinsky (Yabloko) ran as a free marketer but with measured state control. He wanted stronger oversight of public money, an end to the black market and reform of the tax system coinciding with an increase in public services. He also advocated for a strengthened role for the State Duma and a reduction in the size of the civil bureaucracy. He was the most pro-Western candidate, but only to an extent as he had been critical of the war in Chechnya yet remained skeptical of NATO. One of Putin&#x27;s major campaign platforms was “dictatorship of the law” and “the stronger the state, the freer the people.”

Putin mounted almost no campaign in advance of the 2000 elections. “He held no rallies, gave no speeches, and refused to participate in debates with his challengers.” The extent of Putin&#x27;s campaign was a biographical interview broadcast on State Television, and a series of interviews with journalists, paid for by Boris Berezovsky, an oligarch who had helped to build the Unity Party in the Yeltsin years. Putin&#x27;s platform was best reflected by an “Open letter to Russian voters” that ran in national newspapers on February 25, 2000. Because he refused to participate in the debates, Putin&#x27;s challengers had no venue in which to challenge his program, vague as it may have been. A number of other candidates explained this as a refusal to clarify his position on various controversial issues.

Uncritical state television coverage of Putin&#x27;s leadership of the conflict in Chechnya helped him to consolidate his popularity as Prime Minister, even as Yeltsin&#x27;s popularity as president fell. Analysis of television coverage of the 1999 Duma and 2000 presidential elections found that “it was ORT, and state television more generally, that had helped to create a party on short notice” and that “its coverage… was strongly supportive of the party it had created.” Further, TV channel ORT aggressively attacked credible opponents to Unity and Putin. Putin “received over a third of the coverage devoted to the candidates on all television channels, as much as Zyuganov (12%), Yavlinsky (11%) and Zhirinovsky (11%) put together.” He received more than a third of print media coverage, and was given outsize coverage even in opposition newspapers.
Putin announced a new press policy after he won the election. He stated that he believed in “free press” but this should not let the media become “means of mass disinformation and tools of struggle against the state.” He encouraged the state-owned media to control the market and provide the people with “objective information.”

==Conduct==

The decision to conduct the presidential elections also in Chechnya was perceived as controversial by many observers due to the military campaign and security concerns. The legislative elections held on 19 December 1999 had been suspended in Chechnya for these reasons.

There were many alleged serious forgeries reported that could have affected Putin&#x27;s victory in the first round.

===Media bias===
The PACE observers delegation concluded that &quot;the unequal access to television was one of the main reasons for a degree of unfairness of the campaign&quot; and that &quot;independent media have come under increasing pressure and that media in general, be they State-owned or private, failed to a large extent to provide impartial information about the election campaign and candidates.&quot;

The PACE delegation also reported that the media got more and more dominated by politically influential owners. The TV channel ORT launched a slanderous campaign against Yavlinsky&#x27;s image as his ratings started to rise sharply, and broadcasters generally nearly ignored candidates who did not fulfill interests of their owners. One of the main independent broadcasters, NTV, was subject to increasing financial and administrative pressure during the electoral campaign.

Harassment by the Kremlin was utilized to quiet criticism from domestic independent and opposition media, particularly television broadcasters. State agencies pressured media outlets (especially television outlets) to avoid issuing negative reports on the Chechen War. The two primary state-controlled media outlets gave overwhelmingly positive coverage to Putin&#x27;s handling of the war. Multiple Western journalists (such as the Boston Globe&#x27;s David Fillipov) had been either detained or expelled from the country because they strayed from Russian military guidance in Chechnya. Andrei Babitsky (a correspondent for Radio Liberty) was arrested under charges of aiding the Chechens. Under both Yeltsin and Putin, the Kremlin apparatus was applying financial pressure to Media-Most, a media holding group which had been unfriendly in their coverage.

On the other hand, Zyuganov received much fairer media coverage than he had been subject to in the previous presidential election.

==Opinion polls==
==Results==
Polling stations were open from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Putin won on the first ballot with 53.4% of the vote. Putin&#x27;s highest official result was 85.42% in Ingushetia, while his lowest achievement was 29.65% in neighboring Chechnya. Zyuganov&#x27;s results ranged from 47.41% in the Lipetsk region to 4.63% in Ingushetia. Yavlinsky&#x27;s results ranged from 18.56% in Moscow to 0.42% in Dagestan. Zhirinovsky&#x27;s results ranged from 6.13% in the Kamchatka region to 0.29% in Ingushetia.

<text>In mathematics, a constructible polygon is a regular polygon that can be constructed with compass and straightedge. For example, a regular pentagon is constructible with compass and straightedge while a regular heptagon is not. There are infinitely many constructible polygons, but only 31 with an odd number of sides are known.

==Conditions for constructibility==
Some regular polygons are easy to construct with compass and straightedge; others are not. The ancient Greek mathematicians knew how to construct a regular polygon with 3, 4, or 5 sides, and they knew how to construct a regular polygon with double the number of sides of a given regular polygon. This led to the question being posed: is it possible to construct &quot;all&quot; regular polygons with compass and straightedge? If not, which &quot;n&quot;-gons (that is, polygons with &quot;n&quot; edges) are constructible and which are not?

Carl Friedrich Gauss proved the constructibility of the regular 17-gon in 1796. Five years later, he developed the theory of Gaussian periods in his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot;. This theory allowed him to formulate a sufficient condition for the constructibility of regular polygons. Gauss stated without proof that this condition was also necessary, but never published his proof.

A full proof of necessity was given by Pierre Wantzel in 1837. The result is known as the Gauss–Wantzel theorem: A regular &quot;n&quot;-gon can be constructed with compass and straightedge if and only if &quot;n&quot; is the product of a power of 2 and any number of distinct (unequal) Fermat primes. Here, a power of 2 is a number of the form formula_1, where &quot;m&quot; ≥ 0 is an integer. A Fermat prime is a prime number of the form formula_2, where &quot;m&quot; ≥ 0 is an integer. The number of Fermat primes involved can be 0, in which case &quot;n&quot; is a power of 2.

In order to reduce a geometric problem to a problem of pure number theory, the proof uses the fact that a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon is constructible if and only if the cosine formula_3 is a constructible number—that is, can be written in terms of the four basic arithmetic operations and the extraction of square roots. Equivalently, a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon is constructible if any root of the &quot;n&quot;th cyclotomic polynomial is constructible.

===Detailed results by Gauss&#x27;s theory===

Restating the Gauss–Wantzel theorem:
:A regular &quot;n&quot;-gon is constructible with straightedge and compass if and only if &quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;k&quot;&quot;p&quot;1&quot;p&quot;2...&quot;p&quot;&quot;t&quot; where &quot;k&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are non-negative integers, and the &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s (when &quot;t&quot; &gt; 0) are distinct Fermat primes.

The five known Fermat primes are:
:&quot;F&quot;0 = 3, &quot;F&quot;1 = 5, &quot;F&quot;2 = 17, &quot;F&quot;3 = 257, and &quot;F&quot;4 = 65537 .

Since there are 31 nonempty subsets of the five known Fermat primes, there are 31 known constructible polygons with an odd number of sides.

The next twenty-eight Fermat numbers, &quot;F&quot;5 through &quot;F&quot;32, are known to be composite.

Thus a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon is constructible if
:&quot;n&quot; = 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 30, 32, 34, 40, 48, 51, 60, 64, 68, 80, 85, 96, 102, 120, 128, 136, 160, 170, 192, 204, 240, 255, 256, 257, 272, 320, 340, 384, 408, 480, 510, 512, 514, 544, 640, 680, 768, 771, 816, 960, 1020, 1024, 1028, 1088, 1280, 1285, 1360, 1536, 1542, 1632, 1920, 2040, 2048, ... ,

while a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon is not constructible with compass and straightedge if
:&quot;n&quot; = 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82, 83, 84, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, ... .

===Connection to Pascal&#x27;s triangle===

Since there are five known Fermat primes, we know of 31 numbers that are products of distinct Fermat primes, and hence 31 constructible odd-sided regular polygons. These are 3, 5, 15, 17, 51, 85, 255, 257, 771, 1285, 3855, 4369, 13107, 21845, 65535, 65537, 196611, 327685, 983055, 1114129, 3342387, 5570645, 16711935, 16843009, 50529027, 84215045, 252645135, 286331153, 858993459, 1431655765, 4294967295 . As John Conway commented in &quot;The Book of Numbers&quot;, these numbers, when written in binary, are equal to the first 32 rows of the modulo-2 Pascal&#x27;s triangle, minus the top row, which corresponds to a monogon. (Because of this, the &quot;1&quot;s in such a list form an approximation to the Sierpiński triangle.) This pattern breaks down after this, as the next Fermat number is composite (4294967297 = 641 × 6700417), so the following rows do not correspond to constructible polygons. It is unknown whether any more Fermat primes exist, and it is therefore unknown how many odd-sided constructible regular polygons exist. In general, if there are &quot;q&quot; Fermat primes, then there are 2&quot;q&quot;−1 regular constructible polygons.

==General theory==

In the light of later work on Galois theory, the principles of these proofs have been clarified. It is straightforward to show from analytic geometry that constructible lengths must come from base lengths by the solution of some sequence of quadratic equations. In terms of field theory, such lengths must be contained in a field extension generated by a tower of quadratic extensions. It follows that a field generated by constructions will always have degree over the base field that is a power of two.

In the specific case of a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon, the question reduces to the question of constructing a length

:cos  ,

which is a trigonometric number and hence an algebraic number. This number lies in the &quot;n&quot;-th cyclotomic field — and in fact in its real subfield, which is a totally real field and a rational vector space of dimension

:½ φ(&quot;n&quot;),

where φ(&quot;n&quot;) is Euler&#x27;s totient function. Wantzel&#x27;s result comes down to a calculation showing that φ(&quot;n&quot;) is a power of 2 precisely in the cases specified.

As for the construction of Gauss, when the Galois group is a 2-group it follows that it has a sequence of subgroups of orders

:1, 2, 4, 8, ...

that are nested, each in the next (a composition series, in group theory terminology), something simple to prove by induction in this case of an abelian group. Therefore, there are subfields nested inside the cyclotomic field, each of degree 2 over the one before. Generators for each such field can be written down by Gaussian period theory. For example, for &quot;n&quot; = 17 there is a period that is a sum of eight roots of unity, one that is a sum of four roots of unity, and one that is the sum of two, which is

:cos  .

Each of those is a root of a quadratic equation in terms of the one before. Moreover, these equations have real rather than complex roots, so in principle can be solved by geometric construction: this is because the work all goes on inside a totally real field.

In this way the result of Gauss can be understood in current terms; for actual calculation of the equations to be solved, the periods can be squared and compared with the &#x27;lower&#x27; periods, in a quite feasible algorithm.

== Compass and straightedge constructions ==

Compass and straightedge constructions are known for all known constructible polygons. If &quot;n&quot; = &quot;pq&quot; with &quot;p&quot; = 2 or &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; coprime, an &quot;n&quot;-gon can be constructed from a &quot;p&quot;-gon and a &quot;q&quot;-gon.
*If &quot;p&quot; = 2, draw a &quot;q&quot;-gon and bisect one of its central angles. From this, a 2&quot;q&quot;-gon can be constructed.
*If &quot;p&quot; &gt; 2, inscribe a &quot;p&quot;-gon and a &quot;q&quot;-gon in the same circle in such a way that they share a vertex. Because &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are coprime, there exists integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; such that &quot;ap&quot; + &quot;bq&quot; = 1. Then 2&quot;a&quot;π/&quot;q&quot; + 2&quot;b&quot;π/&quot;p&quot; = 2π/&quot;pq&quot;. From this, a &quot;pq&quot;-gon can be constructed.
Thus one only has to find a compass and straightedge construction for &quot;n&quot;-gons where &quot;n&quot; is a Fermat prime.
*The construction for an equilateral triangle is simple and has been known since antiquity; see Equilateral triangle.
*Constructions for the regular pentagon were described both by Euclid (&quot;Elements&quot;, ca. 300 BC), and by Ptolemy (&quot;Almagest&quot;, ca. 150 AD).
*Although Gauss &quot;proved&quot; that the regular 17-gon is constructible, he did not actually &quot;show&quot; how to do it. The first construction is due to Erchinger, a few years after Gauss&#x27;s work.
*The first explicit constructions of a regular 257-gon were given by Magnus Georg Paucker (1822) and Friedrich Julius Richelot (1832).
*A construction for a regular 65537-gon was first given by Johann Gustav Hermes (1894). The construction is very complex; Hermes spent 10 years completing the 200-page manuscript.

From left to right, constructions of a 15-gon, 17-gon, 257-gon and 65537-gon. Only the first stage of the 65537-gon construction is shown; the constructions of the 15-gon, 17-gon, and 257-gon are given completely.

==Other constructions==

The concept of constructibility as discussed in this article applies specifically to compass and straightedge constructions. More constructions become possible if other tools are allowed. The so-called neusis constructions, for example, make use of a &quot;marked&quot; ruler. The constructions are a mathematical idealization and are assumed to be done exactly.

A regular polygon with &quot;n&quot; sides can be constructed with ruler, compass, and angle trisector if and only if formula_4 where &quot;r, s, k&quot; ≥ 0 and where the &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; are distinct Pierpont primes greater than 3 (primes of the form formula_5 These polygons are exactly the regular polygons that can be constructed with Conic section, and the regular polygons that can be constructed with paper folding. The first numbers of sides of these polygons are:
:3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 45, 48, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 60, 63, 64, 65, 68, 70, 72, 73, 74, 76, 78, 80, 81, 84, 85, 90, 91, 95, 96, 97, 102, 104, 105, 108, 109, 111, 112, 114, 117, 119, 120, 126, 128, 130, 133, 135, 136, 140, 144, 146, 148, 152, 153, 156, 160, 162, 163, 168, 170, 171, 180, 182, 185, 189, 190, 192, 193, 194, 195, 204, 208, 210, 216, 218, 219, 221, 222, 224, 228, 234, 238, 240, 243, 247, 252, 255, 256, 257, 259, 260, 266, 270, 272, 273, 280, 285, 288, 291, 292, 296, ...

<text>The Cabot family is one of the Boston Brahmin families, also known as the &quot;first families of Boston&quot;.

==History==

===Family===

The Boston Brahmin Cabot family descended from John Cabot (born 1680 in Jersey, a British Crown Dependency and one of the Channel Islands), who emigrated from his birthplace to Salem, Massachusetts in 1700.

The Cabot family emigrated from Jersey, where the family name can be traced back to at least 1274. In Latin, &quot;caput&quot; means &quot;head&quot;, and the Rev. George Balleine writes that in Jersey the &quot;cabot&quot; is a small fish that seems all head. In French, once a commonly spoken language in Jersey, &quot;cabot&quot; means a dog, or a military corporal, &quot;caboter&quot; is to navigate along the coast, and &quot;cabotin&quot; means &quot;theatrical&quot;.

===Rise to prominence===
John Cabot (born 1680 Isle of Jersey) and his son, Joseph Cabot (born 1720 in Salem), became highly successful merchants, operating a fleet of privateers carrying opium, rum, and slaves. Shipping during the eighteenth century was the lifeblood of most of Boston&#x27;s first families. Joseph&#x27;s sons, Joseph Cabot Jr. (born 1746 in Salem), George Cabot (born 1752 in Salem), and Samuel Cabot (born 1758 in Salem), left Harvard to work their way through shipping, furthering the family fortune and becoming extraordinarily wealthy. Two of the earliest U.S. Supreme Court cases, &quot;Bingham v. Cabot&quot; (1795) and &quot;Bingham v. Cabot&quot; (1798), involved family shipping disputes. In 1784, Samuel Cabot relocated to Boston.

====George Cabot====

George Cabot and his descendants went into politics. George Cabot became a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, and was appointed but declined to be first Secretary of the Navy. His great-grandson, Henry Cabot Lodge (born 1850 in Boston) was also a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts from 1893 until his death in 1924. In the 1916 election, Henry Cabot Lodge defeated John F. Fitzgerald, former mayor of Boston and the maternal grandfather of John, Robert and Edward Kennedy. George&#x27;s great-great-great grandson, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. (born 1902 in Nahant) was also U.S. Senator from Massachusetts from 1937 to 1943 and from 1946 to 1953, when he lost to John F. Kennedy in the 1952 Senate election. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. went on to be the U.S. Ambassador to United Nations under President Eisenhower and ambassador to South Vietnam under President Kennedy. He was 1960 vice presidential candidate for Richard Nixon against Kennedy–Lyndon B. Johnson. George&#x27;s other great-great-great grandson, John Davis Lodge (born 1903 in Washington, D.C.) was the 64th Governor of Connecticut. George&#x27;s great-great-great-great grandson, George Cabot Lodge II (born 1927, son of Henry Cabot Lodge) ran against the successful Edward M. Kennedy in the United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962.

====Samuel Cabot====
From John Cabot&#x27;s grandson, Samuel Cabot&#x27;s side, Samuel Cabot Jr. (born 1784 in Boston) furthered the family fortune by combining the first family staples of working in shipping and marrying money. In 1812, he married Eliza Perkins, daughter of merchant king Colonel Thomas Perkins. Samuel Cabot III (born 1815 in Boston) was an eminent surgeon, whose daughter, Lilla Cabot Perry, was a noted Impressionist artist. His son, Godfrey Lowell Cabot (born 1861 in Boston) founded Cabot Corporation, the largest carbon black producer in the country, used for inks and paints. Godfrey&#x27;s son, John Moors Cabot (born 1901 in Cambridge), a great-great-grandson of Samuel, was a U.S. Ambassador to Sweden, Colombia, Brazil, and Poland during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administration. Another great-great grandson, Paul Codman Cabot (born 1898 in Brookline), was cofounder of America&#x27;s first mutual fund and &quot;Harvard&#x27;s [Endowment] Midas&quot;.

===Boston Toast===

The widely known &quot;Boston Toast&quot; by Holy Cross alumnus John Collins Bossidy features the Cabot family:

== &quot;Kabotchnik v. Cabot&quot; ==
In 1923, Harry H. Kabotchnik and his wife Myrtle petitioned to have his family name changed to Cabot.

Some prominent Cabots of Boston (Judge Cabot of the Boston Juvenile Court; Stephen Cabot, headmaster of St. George&#x27;s School, Middletown, R.I.; Dr. Hugh Cabot, dean of Michigan University Medical School) along with the Pennsylvania branch of the Order of the Founders and Patriots, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and the Genealogical Society of Pennsylvania counter-sued to prevent the change.

Judge Charles Young Audenried eventually ruled for the Kabotchniks, as there was &quot;nothing in the law to prevent it.&quot;

<text>Point Pinole Regional Shoreline is a regional park on the shores of the San Pablo Bay, California (the northern arm of the San Francisco Bay), in the United States. It is approximately in area, and is operated by the East Bay Regional Park District. It includes the Dotson Family Marsh (formerly Breuner Marsh) and the Point Pinole Lagoon and hosts the North Richmond Shoreline Festival.

==History==
Point Pinole is located in the city of Richmond, California. It is on the site of a number of former explosives factories; the largest of these was operated by the Giant Powder Company, which was relocated to this relatively remote spot following accidental explosions at its former sites in San Francisco and at Albany Hill. Giant had built the first dynamite manufacturing plant in the United States at a site known as Glen Canyon Park, which started up on March 19, 1868. On November 26, 1869, there was an explosion that destroyed every building on the site (including the fence around the plant). The plant was forced to move farther away from heavily populated areas. Another explosion occurred at the Albany Hill plant in 1892, before Giant built its last plant in the lightly populated area of Pinole Point. Giant created a small unincorporated community, which it named Giant, California. Later, the Giant community became the established Croatian community of Sobrante.

Although the Point Pinole factory operated until 1960, when Bethlehem Steel Company acquired the property from Atlas Powder Company, little trace of it now remains. After several years, the East Bay Regional Park District acquired the property and opened Point Pinole to the public as a park in 1973. A plaque denotes the site as a California Historical Landmark. The facility&#x27;s former tramway grades provide a network of nearly of gently sloping paths for hiking, cycling and horse-riding. The other relic of the park&#x27;s industrial past is the large number of eucalyptus glades groves which were planted around the factory site to buffer against potential explosions.

The park features the promontory of Point Pinole, located where the East Bay shoreline turns from running south towards Berkeley and Oakland to running eastwards, inland. Geologically, it is a result of movement on the Hayward Fault which runs along its western edge, creating a low scarp. It offers superb views across the bay in all directions, towards San Francisco to the southwest, Mount Tamalpais and the Marin Headlands to the northwest, inland across San Pablo Bay to the north and east, and Mt. Diablo inland to the southeast. Fresh and ocean waters mix at this point, so the marine life is rich; a leisure pier has been built at the end of promontory, replacing a former jetty used by the factories, and is a popular location for angling.

The parks trails are almost level allowing for easy walks. There is a $3 parking fee and a $2 per dog fee.
In 2008 the park acquired the adjoining Breuner Marsh site and added it to the Point Pinole Regional Shoreline park. EBRPD renamed it the Dotson Family Marsh.

==Environment and wildlife==
The park is a mixture of grassland and woodland, with beaches and low cliffs, and it has a particularly rich bird life, including many ducks and shorebirds, and the endangered black rail. It is located on the Pacific Flyway, so many migrant species are also seen. The marsh provides habitat for several creatures, including the Ridgway&#x27;s rail and the salt marsh harvest mouse.

Whittell Marsh is the site of one of the few remaining Native American shellmounds in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The park is located on the Hayward Fault, whose exact position is marked by monuments erected by the United States Geological Survey. The USGS has a seismometer posted along the Union Pacific Railroad, which divides the park from the mainland; the park is reached via a bridge across the railroad.

The San Francisco Bay Trail runs through the park. The park can be reached by the AC Transit bus service, by car, or by bicycle. Pedestrian and cyclist admission is free, but there is a parking fee.

==Recent construction projects==

===Playground area===
The playground at Point Pinole park was temporarily closed for construction from mid-August through October, 2017. During this time, the playground was resurfaced with wood fiber, equipment replaced with a net climber and a stand-up spinner, and a wheelchair-accessible path and picnic tables were added. All park paths remained open to the public during this work.

===Atlas Road Bridge===
On April 22, 2017, EBRPD dedicated the Atlas Road Bridge, a combination vehicle and wheelchair-compliant pedestrian bridge that connects to the San Francisco Bay Trail. This activity included building a new main entrance and parking area. The new entrance provides a bridge over active railroad tracks, which had been a hazard for pedestrians approaching the park from the parking lot. The project cost $11.7 million, which was largely funded by local bond Measure CC, the City of Richmond and grants from the following grantors:

* California State Parks
* California Natural Resources Agency
* Contra Costa Transportation Authority

The new bridge is part of a multi-phase project that will eventually lead to additional picnic areas, a new playground and the route to a new interpretive center for the park.

===Dotson Family Marsh===

At the same ceremony in April 2017, EBRPD also renamed and dedicated Breuner Marsh as the Dotson Family Marsh, honoring a family led by Reverend Richard Dotson, who had worked for many years to keep Breuner Marsh wild and open to the public, opposing several attempts to develop the tract for commercial ventures. Rev. Dotson was able to organize residents of his own neighborhood in Richmond, Parchester, reminding them that the builder of their houses had promised they would always have access to the bay. He also recruited the Sierra Club as an influential ally in the three-decade legal fight against the developers. Dotson&#x27;s group prevailed, and EBRPD acquires the marsh through eminent domain in March 2008. The district then attached the marsh to Point Pinole Regional Shoreline. 

===Habitat restoration===
The Dotson Marsh restoration project is intended to adapt the PPS to a self-sustaining wetland complex that will include filtering polluted run-off water. It also provides adaptations for anticipated sea level rise caused by climate change. The cost of restoration is estimated at $14 million, with at least 10 different entities providing funds.

<text>IV Corps was a corps-sized formation of the British Army, formed in both the First World War and the Second World War. During the First World War the corps served on the Western Front throughout its existence. During the Second World War it served in Norway and Britain until it was transferred to India, which was threatened with attack after Japan entered the war.

==Prior to the First World War==
In 1876 a Mobilisation Scheme for eight army corps was published, with &#x27;4th Corps&#x27; headquartered at Dublin and comprising the regular units of Irish Command, supported with militia. In 1880, it was organised as follows:

This scheme had been dropped by 1881.

The 1901 Army Estimates (introduced by St John Brodrick when Secretary of State for War) allowed for six army corps based on the six regional commands: IV Corps was to be formed by Eastern Command with headquarters in London. It was to comprise 27 artillery batteries (18 Regular, 6 Militia and 3 Volunteer) and 25 infantry battalions (8 Regular, 8 Militia and 9 Volunteers). Lieutenant General Lord Grenfell was appointed acting General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOCinC) of IV Corps in April 1903. Under Army Order No 38 of 1907 the corps titles disappeared, but Eastern Command continued to be a major administrative organisation, controlling two cavalry brigades and one infantry division (4th Division).

==First World War==
The Corps had its origin in a force operating independently against the German invasion of Belgium under the command of Lieut-Gen Sir Henry Rawlinson. It was transferred from War Office control to the British Expeditionary Force on 9 October 1914, and the BEF&quot;s commander, Sir John French, constituted it as IV Corps. It bore part of the brunt of the defence in the early stages of the First Battle of Ypres. Initially it comprised the 7th Infantry Division and 3rd Cavalry Division, but these were transferred in late October. IV Corps was reconstituted on 6 November. It then fought at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle and subsidiary actions, the Battle of Aubers Ridge, and The Battle of Festubert, the Battle of Loos and associated actions. Rawlinson&#x27;s failure to bring reserves to the IV Corps front lines allowed the Imperial German Army to regroup and caused the BEF counteroffensive to fail to break through.

In 1916 the corps was commanded by Sir Henry Wilson.
The corps was initially holding a stretch of five miles from Loos to just south of Givenchy, between Hubert Gough&#x27;s I Corps in the north and French 9th Army Corps (part of Victor d&#x27;Urbal&#x27;s Tenth Army) in the south. Wilson, noting the difference in quality between his divisions, took a keen interest in training and did much lecturing.

In March the British took over line from French Tenth Army. IV Corps was moved south of Givenchy, opposite Vimy Ridge, which gave the Germans the advantage of height. 47th Division conducted effective mining operations on 3 May and 15 May. A surprise German attack on the evening of Sunday 21 May moved forward 800 yards, capturing 1,000 yards of the British front line. The subsequent counterattack failed and Wilson was almost &quot;degummed&quot; (relieved of command).

Wilson resisted pressure from Haig to conduct a limited attack until after 1 September. With another &quot;Big Push&quot; due on the Somme in September, Wilson&#x27;s attack was postponed until October, and GHQ now wanted the whole of Vimy Ridge taken, which would mean a joint attack with XVII Corps. Edmonds later wrote that Wilson&#x27;s preparations had laid the foundations for the successful capture of Vimy Ridge in April 1917. The attack at Vimy never took place as IV Corps was incorporated into Gough&#x27;s Reserve Army, where it remained in reserve during the Battle of the Ancre.

The corps also took part in the German Retreat to the Hindenburg Line, the Battle of Cambrai and associated actions, the First Battles of the Somme and associated actions, the Second Battle of the Somme, the Battle of St. Quentin Canal and associated actions, and the final advance in Picardy.

===Composition in the First World War===
The composition of army corps changed frequently. Some representative orders of battle for IV Corps are given here.

Order of Battle at Ypres 10 November 1914:

General Officer Commanding (GOC): Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Rawlinson
* Brigadier-General, General Staff: R.A.K. Montgomery
* Brigadier-General, Royal Artillery: A.H. Hussey
* Colonel, Royal Engineers: R.U.H. Buckland
* 7th Division
* 8th Division

By the time of the battles of Aubers Ridge and Festubert (May 1915), IV Corps still had 7th and 8th Divisions under command, but had been reinforced by 49th (West Riding) Division of the Territorial Force.

Order of Battle in 1916

Once the era of trench warfare had set in on the Western Front (1915–17), the BEF left its army corps in position for long periods, so that they became familiar with their sector, while rotating divisions as they required rest, training, or transfer to other sectors. Thirteen different divisions passed through IV Corps during the eleven-month tenure of the new corps commander, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Wilson, and only one, the 47th, stayed for longer than six months.

In December 1915 IV Corps consisted of 1st (formerly a regular division), 47th (London Territorials) and 15th (Scottish) Division and 16th (Irish) Division (both New Army). Wilson was impressed by the standard of training in the 15th but not the 16th. In the spring it lost 1st, 15th and 16th Divisions and gained 2nd (formerly a regular division) from I Corps. IV Corps also gained 23rd (New Army). At this time, with the army having recently grown tenfold in size, there was little in the way of formal ongoing assessment of officers&#x27; performance, so Gough, the Reserve Army commander, passed on his informal (and low) opinion of the 2nd Division GOC William G. Walker, who was later relieved. (Wilson Diary 24 February 1916).

In early April the 23rd Division was taken away, and a number of guns with it. By August, IV Corps contained two divisions, the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division and the 9th (Scottish) Division (New Army). Some of IV Corps artillery was moved down to the Somme. Then the 63rd and 9th Divisions were taken away, then in October the whole Corps was transferred to Gough&#x27;s Reserve Army on the Somme, although it was used as a holding formation rather than being deployed into the front line. At one point, by 18 October, IV Corps had no divisions at all.

During 1916, able staff officers were still in short supply and such men were poached from IV Corps and its component divisions by Rawlinson for Fourth Army HQ.

Order of Battle at the start of the final advance in Picardy (27 September 1918)

GOC: Lieutenant-General Sir George Harper
* 5th Division
* 37th Division
* 42nd (Eastern Lancashire) Division
* New Zealand Division

==Second World War==

===Norway===
The Corps was reformed in Alresford in Hampshire in February 1940 in anticipation of operations in Norway, or perhaps Finland (part of a projected intervention in the Russo-Finnish Winter War). From March to May 1940 parts of the corps fought at Narvik and Trondheim in the Norwegian campaign. Its commander was Lieutenant General Claude Auchinleck.

===Home Forces===
After the Norwegian campaign ended, the Corps first commanded most of the armoured reserves preparing to face the proposed German invasion of Britain (Operation Sea Lion), while the other corps headquarters which had been evacuated from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo were reorganised. IV Corps was envisaged as a counter-attack force under Lieutenant-General Sir Francis Nosworthy. Once the danger of invasion was over, the corps was heavily involved in training and developing tactical doctrine. The corps was based at Guilsborough House near Northampton until August 1940 when it moved to Latimer House near Chesham.

Order of Battle Autumn 1940
* 2nd Armoured Division &quot;(16 June–4 August 1940)&quot;
* 42nd (East Lancashire) Division &quot;(9 September–6 November 1940)&quot;
* 43rd (Wessex) Division &quot;(19 June–5 November 1940)&quot;
* 31st Independent Brigade Group &quot;(1 August 1940–15 February 1941)&quot;
* HQ Royal Artillery
** 154th (Leicestershire Yeomanry) Army Field Regiment
** 67th Medium Regiment

===Iraq===
In January 1942 the Corps headquarters was dispatched to Iraq, as part of Middle East Command. Its commander was Lieutenant General Thomas Corbett. In 1942, Corbett was appointed Chief of Staff of Middle East Command and Lieutenant General Noel Irwin took over IV Corps.

===India / Burma===
Following the Japanese conquest of Burma, several British divisions from Britain and the Middle East, and IV Corps headquarters, were deployed to India, then filled out with Indian Army Corps of Signals and line-of-communications units. It took over from the &quot;ad hoc&quot; Burma Corps headquarters, which was disbanded, at Imphal in Manipur in Northeast India. It reported to the Eastern Army. The Corps adopted a badge of a charging elephant, in black on a red background.

In July 1942, Irwin was promoted to command Eastern Army. His successor in command of IV Corps was Lieutenant-General Geoffry Scoones. It was engaged in patrol activity as far as the Chindwin River and construction of airfields and roads. From late 1943, the Corps formed part of the newly created Fourteenth Army.

In 1944 the Japanese sought to disrupt Allied attacks into Burma by launching an attack, codenamed U-Go, against Imphal, which led to the epic Battle of Imphal. At the start of the battle the Corps consisted of the Indian 17th, 20th and 23rd Divisions, with the Indian 50th Parachute Brigade and 254th Indian Tank Brigade. During the early stages of the battle, the 5th Indian Division was flown into Imphal to join the corps.

The Corps was surrounded by the Imperial Japanese Army but eventually defeated their attackers. Supplies and reinforcements were flown in to support the besieged troops, and casualties and non-combatants were flown out. The siege ended on 22 June, when troops from IV Corps met the relieving forces from XXXIII Corps north of Imphal. From then until the monsoon ended later in the year, formations from IV Corps (the 5th Indian Division and the newly arrived 11th East African Division) cleared the Japanese from east of the Chindwin, and established several bridgeheads across the river.

In November 1944, as the rains ended, Fourteenth Army prepared to make a decisive attack into Central Burma. Lieutenant General Scoones was appointed to &quot;Central Command&quot;, an army-level headquarters in India, and replaced in charge of IV Corps by Lieutenant-General Frank Messervy. In preparation for the offensive, several divisions were organised as motorised and air-portable formations.

The offensive began with IV Corps on the left of Fourteenth Army, led by the newly arrived 19th Indian Division. It became apparent that the Japanese had fallen back behind the Irrawaddy River. The 19th Division was transferred to XXXIII Corps and IV Corps was switched to the right flank of the Army, advancing down the Gangaw valley west of the Chindwin, led by the East African 28th Infantry Brigade and an ad-hoc infantry formation, the Lushai Brigade. In late February, the 7th Indian Infantry Division won bridgeheads over the Irrawaddy. The motorised 17th Indian Division, with the M4 Sherman tanks of the 255th Indian Tank Brigade, followed up through these bridgeheads and struck deep into Japanese occupied territory to capture the vital transport and supply centre of Meiktila. Reinforced by troops landed at the airfields near the town, it defended against Japanese counter-attacks during March.

Following the Japanese defeat in Central Burma, Fourteenth Army was reorganised. IV Corps now commanded the motorised 5th and 17th Indian Divisions, the 19th Indian Division (which remained on a mixed animal and motor transport establishment) and the 255th Tank Brigade. During April, the 5th and 17th Divisions alternated in the lead of the final drive on Rangoon down the Sittang River valley, while the 19th Division secured the corps&#x27; line of communications. By the start of May when the monsoon began, the Corps had been held up from Rangoon. Rangoon was captured by an amphibious landing, Operation Dracula, having been abandoned by its garrison.

Shortly after the fall of Rangoon, IV Corps was withdrawn from the control of Fourteenth Army and placed under the newly activated Twelfth Army. Temporarily commanded by Lieutenant-General Francis Tuker, it was responsible for mopping up the remaining Japanese forces in Burma until the end of the war including the defeat of a large break-out in the Pegu Yoma. The Corps was deactivated shortly after the end of hostilities.

He is also a member of The Elders, a group of world leaders working for global peace. Brahimi is a member of the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor, the first global initiative to focus specifically on the link between exclusion, poverty and law. He has also been a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation since 2008, an organization which works to promote good governance around the world. He is currently a distinguished senior fellow at the Centre for the Study of Global Governance at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a governing board member of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. He relinquished his post as UN Special Envoy to Syria on 31 May 2014.

==Early life and education==
Brahimi was born in 1934 in El Azizia near Tablat, Algeria, about 60 km south of Algiers. He was educated in Algeria and in France where he studied law and political science. He joined the campaign for independence in 1956. Based in Jakarta for five years, he was the representative of the National Liberation Front (Algeria) in South East Asia, touring the region in search of diplomatic support.

==Career==
Brahimi was the United Nations special representative for Afghanistan and Iraq. Before his appointment in 2001 by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, he had served the U.N. as special representative to Haiti where he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Brahimi facilitated the first American UN Force Commander since their involvement in the Korean War. Before coming to the U.N., Brahimi, who represented the National Liberation Front in Tunis during Algeria&#x27;s independence movement in 1956–1961, was an Arab League official (1984–1991) and the Algerian Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1991 until 1993. Brahimi was also chair of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, which produced the influential Brahimi Report.

On a visit to Baghdad in April 2004 to help determine how and when Iraqi elections can be held, he said that the recent violence threatened to delay Iraqi national assembly elections—the national assembly is to pick the president and write a constitution.

: &quot;The elections scheduled to take place in January 2005 are the most important milestone,&quot; Brahimi said. &quot;There is no substitute for the legitimacy that comes from free and fair elections.&quot; (Witter, 2004)

Brahimi suggested that the Iraq Interim Governing Council should be dissolved and that most of its members should not have any role in the new government. Though the council was in fact dissolved early, some of its members did have major roles in the ensuing government. The president, one of the two vice-presidents, and the prime minister in the following government all served on the council. Most prominently, Brahimi&#x27;s criticism of Ahmed Chalabi has led to Chalabi&#x27;s claim that Brahimi is an Arab nationalist who should have no role in determining the future of Iraq. At the same time, close allies of Chalabi have been pushing claims that various world leaders and the UN took bribes from Saddam Hussein under the Oil for Food program.

In May 2004, Brahimi was supposed to play a largely advisory role in the appointment of candidates, which ended up selecting as Iraq&#x27;s new interim President and Prime Minister: Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer and Iyad Allawi, respectively. However, Brahimi expressed serious disappointment and frustration about his role. &quot;Bremer is the dictator of Iraq, He has the money. He has the signature. ... I will not say who was my first choice, and who was not my first choice ... I will remind you that the Americans are governing this country.&quot; According to a person who spoke with him, &quot;He was very disappointed, very frustrated,&quot; al Dulame said. &quot;I asked him why he didn&#x27;t say that publicly (and) he said, &#x27;I am the U.N. envoy to Iraq, how can I admit to failure?&#x27;&quot; Brahimi announced his resignation, resulting from &quot;great difficulties and frustration experienced during his assignment in Iraq&quot;, at the UN in New York on 12 June. While serving as the United Nations envoy to Iraq, he described Israel&#x27;s policy towards the Palestinians as &quot;the big poison in the region&quot;.

On 5 February 2008, the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, appointed Brahimi to lead a panel investigation on United Nations staff security in the wake of the Algiers bombings of 11 December 2007. He was one of the founders of the French language Journal of Palestine Studies called &quot;La revue d&#x27;étude palestinienne&quot;.
On 17 August 2012, Brahimi was appointed by the United Nations as the new peace envoy to Syria, replacing Kofi Annan.
On 13 May 2014, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced that Brahimi would resign as the special envoy to Syria on 31 May 2014.

Brahimi addressed a police academy in December 2016, expressing his wish that Algeria and Morocco should “leave the Sahara issue aside in an effort to build a communal economy based on exchange.” His statement caused shockwaves in Algeria.

In March 2019, he is mandated by Abdelaziz Bouteflika to preside over the national conference that is to propose a new constitution and set the date of the presidential election.

<text>The Advanced Communications Riser, or ACR, is a form factor and technical specification for PC motherboard expansion slots. It is meant as a supplement to PCI slots, a replacement for the original Audio/modem riser (AMR) slots, and a competitor and alternative to Intel&#x27;s communications and networking riser (CNR) slots.

==Technology==
The ACR specification provides a lower cost method to connect certain expansion cards to a computer, with an emphasis on audio and communications devices. Sound cards and modems are the most common devices to use the specification. ACR and other riser cards lower hardware costs by offloading much of the computing tasks of the peripheral to the CPU.

ACR uses a 120 pin PCI connector which is reversed and offset, retaining backward compatibility with 46 pin AMR cards while including support for newer technologies. It is also more cost-effective and simple for the manufacturer, since the connectors are identical to the PCI connectors already purchased in quantity. New features supported by ACR include standards for an EEPROM for storing model and vendor information, USB support, and the &quot;Integrated Packet Bus&quot; for digital subscriber line (DSL), cable modem, and wireless networking support.

==History==
The ACR specification was created by the &quot;Advanced Communications Riser Special Interest Group&quot; (ACR SIG) in 2000 with the intent to replace the AMR specification. Because it was backwards compatible with AMR cards, and technically superior, it quickly replaced it.

ACR is rendered obsolete by discrete components mounted on the motherboard.

<text>Morotai Island Regency () is a regency of North Maluku province, Indonesia, located on Morotai island (). It covers an area of 2,336.6 km2 including the smaller Rao Island to the west of Morotai. The population was 52,860 at the 2010 census and 74,436 at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 80,566 (comprising 41,461 males and 39,105 females). The population of the southern third of the island, as well as Rao Island, are Galela speakers, while that of the northern two-thirds are Tobalo speakers.

The island in the Halmahera group of eastern Indonesia&#x27;s Maluku Islands (Moluccas); it is one of Indonesia&#x27;s northernmost islands. Morotai is a rugged, forested island lying to the north of Halmahera. It has an area of some , including Rao Island which lies to the west of Morotai and forms an administrative district within the regency. It stretches north-south and no more than wide. The island&#x27;s largest town is Daruba, on the island&#x27;s south coast. Leo Wattimena Airport is located on the island. Almost all of Morotai&#x27;s numerous villages are coastal settlements; a paved road linking those on the east coast starts from Daruba and will eventually reach Berebere, the principal town on Morotai&#x27;s east coast, from Daruba. Between Halmahera and the islets and reefs of the west coast of Morotai is the Morotai Strait, which is about wide. The island is the location of the last known Japanese holdout, Teruo Nakamura, who surrendered in 1974, almost 30 years after the end of hostilities in 1945.

==History==
During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Morotai was generally within the sphere of influence of the powerful sultanate on the island of Ternate. It was the core of a larger region, called &quot;Moro&quot;, that included the island and the coastline of Halmahera closest to Morotai to the south.

In the mid-sixteenth century, the island was also the site of a Portuguese Jesuit mission. The Muslim states on Ternate and Halmahera resented the outpost for its evangelising activities, and managed to drive the mission from the island in 1571, as a part of a larger Portuguese retreat in the region. In the seventeenth century, Ternate further exerted its power over Morotai by repeatedly forcing major parts of the population to move off the island. Early in the century most of the population was moved to Dodinga, a small town in a strategic spot on Halmahera&#x27;s west coast. Later, in 1627 and 1628, Sultan Hamzah of Ternate had much of the Christian population of the island moved to Malayu, on Ternate, where they could be more easily controlled. The Ternate Sultanate was a vassal of the Dutch East India Company by the end of the 17th century.

===World War II===

The island was captured by the Japanese in early 1942 as part of its Dutch East Indies Campaign. Morotai&#x27;s southern plain was taken by American forces in September 1944 during the Battle of Morotai, and used as a staging point for the Allied invasion of the Philippines in early 1945, and of Borneo in May and June of that year. In the latter part of 1944, 61,000 personnel landed on Morotai. Two thirds of them were engineers, who rapidly established facilities including harbours and two airstrips plus extensive fuel stores.
Imperial Japanese forces on Morotai held out until 1945 but failed to expel the Allied troops. The formal surrender of the Second Japanese Army took place at Morotai on 9 September 1945.

The last confirmed Japanese holdout from the war, Private Teruo Nakamura (Amis: Attun Palalin), was discovered by the Indonesian Air Force on Morotai, and surrendered to a search patrol on December 18, 1974.

===Permesta rebellion===
The Dutch Empire withdrew in the Indonesian National Revolution in the late 1940s, after which the new Indonesian Air Force (AURI) kept one of the Allied-built airstrips in use. During the Permesta rebellion in 1958, AURI North American B-25 Mitchell bomber aircraft used the airstrip in transit on their way to attack the rebel center at Manado in North Sulawesi. Permesta had its own &quot;Revolutionary Air Force&quot;, AUREV, whose aircraft, munitions and pilots were supplied by the CIA. AUREV aircraft attacked Morotai on April 21 and again early on April 26. The second air raid was immediately followed by an amphibious Permesta landing force that quickly captured the island. Within hours, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft landed on the now captured airstrip, carrying senior Permesta representative and two Americans. One was a USAF officer who inspected the runway and pronounced that Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bomber aircraft could use it.

In May 1958 Indonesian National Armed Forces started to gather amphibious forces to retake both Morotai and the rebel-held town of Jailolo on the neighboring island of Halmahera. By May 16 the assault fleet started to gather in Ambon harbour and on May 20 its troops landed on Morotai while élite &quot;Pasukan Gerak Tjepat&quot; (PGT or &quot;Quick Reaction Force&quot;) troops parachuted onto the island. The Permesta force&#x27;s surrender was as quick as its capture of the island less than a month before. It alarmed the Permesta rebels who had captured Jailolo, many of whom promptly fled back to North Sulawesi. Thereafter the rebellion was largely confined to the Minahasa Peninsula of Sulawesi, where Permesta remnants waged a guerilla campaign until the last unit surrendered in January 1962.

===Post-independence===
Morotai became its own regency on 29 October 2008, separating from the North Halmahera Regency.

===Spaceport plan===
After assessing three potential spaceport sites in 2012, the national space agency LAPAN announced Morotai Island as a future spaceport site. Planning started in December 2012. The launch site&#x27;s completion is expected in 2025. In 2013, LAPAN planned to launch an RX-550 experimental satellite launcher from a location in Morotai to be decided. This island was selected according to the following criteria:
*Morotai Island&#x27;s location near the equator, which makes the launch more economical.
*The island has seven runways, one of them 2,400 meters, easily extended to 3,000 meters.
*The ease of building on Morotai, which is not densely populated, and little potential for social conflict with native inhabitants.
*Morotai Island&#x27;s east side faces the Pacific Ocean directly, reducing downrange risks to other island populations.

==Geography==
Morotai is a rugged, forested island lying to the north of Halmahera. It has an area of some , including Rao Island off the west coast of Morotai. It stretches north-south and no more than wide. The regency&#x27;s largest town is Daruba, on the island&#x27;s south coast. Almost all of Morotai&#x27;s numerous villages are coastal settlements; a paved road linking those on the east coast starts from Daruba and will eventually reach Bere-Bere, the principal town on Morotai&#x27;s east coast, from Daruba.

==Climate==
Daruba, the main settlement and the seat of the regency has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with moderate rainfall from August to October and heavy rainfall in the remaining months.
== Administration ==
At the 2010 census, the regency was divided into five districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), but a sixth district has subsequently been added by cutting off Rao Island from Morotai Selatan Barat District. The districts are tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census and 2020 census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of administrative villages (all rural &quot;desa&quot;) in each district, and the post codes.

Note: (a) the population in 2010 of Rao Island is included in the figure for Morotai Selatan Barat District, from which it was cut out.

==Economy==
The island is heavily wooded and produces timber and resin and has a subsistence fishing industry.

==Energy==
Currently 3MW Diesel generators across 3 locations one with 2MW, and 2 at 0.5MW. The electrification ratio is reported as 80%. Eight potential locations for micro-hydro were identified by ESDM/KKP.

==Morotai Aerodrome==
The provincial government make an effort to turn Pitu Airport into an international aerodrome to boost tourists. &#x27;Pitu&#x27; means seven due to they have seven lanes of take off and landing built in World War II. It has now been renamed Leo Wattimena Airport as a commercial airport.

<doc id="523462" wikidata="Q1010517" url="?curid=523462" title="Bureau des Longitudes">
<text>The Bureau des Longitudes () is a French scientific institution, founded by decree of 25 June 1795 and charged with the improvement of nautical navigation, standardisation of time-keeping, geodesy and astronomical observation. During the 19th century, it was responsible for synchronizing clocks across the world. It was headed during this time by François Arago and Henri Poincaré. The Bureau now functions as an academy and still meets monthly to discuss topics related to astronomy.

The Bureau was founded by the National Convention after it heard a report drawn up jointly by the Committee of Navy, the Committee of Finances and the Committee of State education. Henri Grégoire had brought to the attention of the National Convention France&#x27;s failing maritime power and the naval mastery of England, proposing that improvements in navigation would lay the foundations for a renaissance in naval strength. As a result, the Bureau was established with authority over the Paris Observatory and all other astronomical establishments throughout France. The Bureau was charged with taking control of the seas away from the English and improving accuracy when tracking the longitudes of ships through astronomical observations and reliable clocks.

The ten original members of its founding board were:

*Joseph-Louis Lagrange, geometer;
*Pierre-Simon Laplace, geometer;
*Joseph Jérôme Lefrançais de Lalande, astronomer;
*Pierre Méchain, astronomer;
*Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre, astronomer;
*Dominique, comte de Cassini, astronomer;
*Jean-Charles de Borda, Navy officer;
*Jean-Nicolas Buache, geographer;
*Louis Antoine de Bougainville, Navy officer;
*Noël Simon Caroché, manufacturer of telescopes.

By a decree of 30 January 1854, the Bureau&#x27;s mission was extended to embrace geodesy, time standardisation and astronomical measurements. This decree granted independence to the Paris Observatory, separating it from the Bureau, and focused the efforts of the Bureau on time and astronomy. The Bureau was successful at setting a universal time in Paris via air pulses sent through pneumatic tubes. It later worked to synchronize time across the French colonial empire by determining the length of time for a signal to make a round trip to and from a French colony.

The French Bureau of Longitude established a commission in the year 1897 to extend the metric system to the measurement of time. They planned to abolish the antiquated division of the day into hours, minutes, and seconds, and replace it by a division into tenths, thousandths, and hundred-thousandths of a day. This was a revival of a dream that was in the minds of the creators of the metric system at the time of the French Revolution a hundred years earlier. Some members of the Bureau of Longitude commission introduced a compromise proposal, retaining the old-fashioned hour as the basic unit of time and dividing it into hundredths and ten-thousandths. Poincaré served as secretary of the commission and took its work very seriously, writing several of its reports. He was a fervent believer in a universal metric system. But he lost the battle. The rest of the world outside France gave no support to the commission&#x27;s proposals, and the French government was not prepared to go it alone. After three years of hard work, the commission was dissolved in 1900.

Since 1970, the board has been constituted with 13 members, 3 nominated by the Académie des Sciences. Since 1998, practical work has been carried out by the &quot;Institut de mécanique céleste et de calcul des éphémérides&quot;.

<text>I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (1964) is a semi-autobiographical novel by Joanne Greenberg, written under the pen name of Hannah Green. It served as the basis for a film in 1977 and a play in 2004.

==Inspiration==
The character of Dr. Fried is based closely on Greenberg&#x27;s real doctor Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, and the hospital on Chestnut Lodge in Rockville, Maryland. While at Chestnut Lodge, Greenberg described a fantasy world called Iria to her doctors, quoting poetry in the Irian language. However, some of Greenberg&#x27;s doctors felt that this was not a true delusion but rather something Greenberg had made up on the spot to impress her psychiatrist. One doctor went so far as to state that Irian was not an actual language, but was a form of bastardized Armenian. However, according to Gerald Schoenewolf, Irian was a conlang invented by Greenberg at an early age to prevent her father from reading her poetry, and had its own writing system resembling Chinese characters. Fromm-Reichmann wrote glowing reports focusing on Greenberg&#x27;s genius and creativity, which she saw as signs of Greenberg&#x27;s innate health, indicating that she had every chance of recovering from her mental illness.

Similar to what occurred in the novel, Greenberg was diagnosed with schizophrenia. At that time though, undifferentiated schizophrenia was often a vague diagnosis given to a patient or to medical records department for essentially non-medical reasons, which could have covered any number of mental illnesses from anxiety to depression.

Two psychiatrists who examined the book&#x27;s description of protagonist Deborah Blau say that she was not schizophrenic, but rather suffered from extreme depression and somatization disorder.

<text>The tarte Tatin (), named after the Tatin sisters who invented it and served it in their hotel as its signature dish, is a pastry in which the fruit (usually apples) is caramelized in butter and sugar before the tart is baked. It originated in France but has spread to other countries over the years.

== History ==

A popular myth tells the tarte Tatin was created accidentally at the Hôtel Tatin in Lamotte-Beuvron, Loir-et-Cher, south of Paris, in the 1880s. The hotel was run by two sisters, Stéphanie and Caroline Tatin. There are several myths concerning the tart&#x27;s origin, but the most common is that Stéphanie Tatin, who did most of the cooking, was overworked one day. She started to make a traditional apple pie but left the apples cooking in butter and sugar for too long. Smelling the burning, she tried to rescue the dish by putting the pastry base on top of the pan of apples and quickly finishing the cooking by putting the whole pan in the oven. After turning out the upside-down tart, she was surprised to find how much the hotel guests appreciated the dessert. In an alternative version of the tart&#x27;s origin, Stéphanie baked a caramelized apple tart upside-down by mistake: regardless, she served her guests the unusual dish A manuscript written by teacher Marie Souchon explains that the recipe was shared to them by the cook of Count Alfred Leblanc de Chatauvillard. Whatever the veracity of either story, the concept of the upside-down tart was not a new one. For instance, patissier Antonin Carême already mentions glazed &quot;gâteaux renversés&quot; adorned with apples from Rouen or other fruit in his &quot;Pâtissier Royal Parisien&quot; (1841).

The tarte became a signature dish of the Hôtel Tatin. Historians and gourmets have argued whether it is a genuine creation of the Demoiselles (Misses) Tatin or the branding of an improved version of the &quot;tarte solognote,&quot; a traditional dish named after the Sologne region which surrounds Lamotte-Beuvron. Research suggests that while the tarte became a specialty of the Hôtel Tatin, the sisters did not set out to create a &quot;signature dish&quot;; they never wrote a cookbook or published their recipe; they never even called it &quot;tarte Tatin&quot;. That recognition was bestowed upon them by Curnonsky, the famous French author and epicure, as well as the Parisian restaurant Maxim&#x27;s after the sisters&#x27; deaths.

One of the legends has it that Louis Vaudable, the owner of Maxim&#x27;s, once tasted it and was smitten. As he described it:

In reality, Vaudable was born in 1902; the sisters retired in 1906 and died in 1911 and 1917, whereas Maxim&#x27;s was purchased by the Vaudable family in 1932.
Originally, the tarte Tatin was made with two regional apple varieties: Reine des Reinettes (Pippins) and Calville. Over the years, other varieties have tended to displace them, including Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Fuji and Gala.

Tarte Tatin can also be made with pears, bananas, quinces, peaches, pineapple, tomatoes, other fruit or vegetables, such as onion.

The Tarte Tatin should be made with puff or shortcrust pastry.

== Variations ==

Variations of this recipe can also be made as turnovers, where the pastry is not only cooked upside-down but also inverted.

<text>Tupeni Lebaivalu Baba (14 June 1942 – 14 July 2024) was a Fijian academic, politician, and Cabinet Minister. A founding member of the Fiji Labour Party, he served as a Cabinet Minister in the government of Timoci Bavadra until removed from office by the 1987 Fijian coups d&#x27;état, and then one of the two Deputy Prime Ministers in the government of Mahendra Chaudhry until removed from office by the 2000 Fijian coup d&#x27;état. After splitting with Choudhry in the wake of the coup, he founded the New Labour Unity Party to contest the 2001 election, but failed to win a seat in Parliament. He unsuccessfully attempting to re-enter politics at the 2006 election under the banner of the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua, and again at the 2014 election as part of the Social Democratic Liberal Party. 

When not in politics, Baba pursued an academic career, first at the University of the South Pacific, then at the University of Auckland&#x27;s Centre for Pacific Studies, and later at the University of Fiji.

== Early life ==
Baba was born on 14 June 1942. He was educated at the University of Sydney, graduating with a master&#x27;s degree in education, before working as an education lecturer at the University of the South Pacific. He later obtained a PhD from Macquarie University in Australia, and while there was highly critical of South Pacific Commission, attacking it as a colonial organisation. He was later appointed registrar at USP, but resigned from the position in December 1984 to return to a teaching role.

== Political career ==

Baba was a founding member of the Fiji Labour Party and in 1986 was its vice-president. He ran as a candidate for the Labour-National Federation Party Coalition at the 1987 Fijian general election and was elected to the House of Representatives of Fiji in the Suva Fijian constituency, defeating Deputy Prime Minister David Toganivalu. Timoci Bavadra was appointed prime minister, and Baba was appointed Minister of Education, Youth, and Sports in his Cabinet. A month later, the new government was deposed in the first of the 1987 Fijian coups d&#x27;état led by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka. In the aftermath of the coup, he campaigned in Australia and flew to London in an effort to gain support for the ousted government. He was later part of the ousted government&#x27;s efforts to negotiate a peaceful return to democracy through the Rabuka regime&#x27;s constitutional review committee.

Baba returned to his academic career at the University of the South Pacific, where he remained until 1999, when he was again elected to Parliament and became Foreign Minister and one of two Deputy Prime Ministers in the government of Mahendra Chaudhry. During the 2000 Fijian coup d&#x27;état in which most members of the government were kidnapped by George Speight, Baba&#x27;s courage as one of the hostages earned him considerable public respect.

Following the coup tensions within the Labour Party caused a split. When the Court of Appeal of Fiji legally overturned the coup in its decision on &quot;Republic of Fiji Islands v Prasad&quot;, Baba was promoted as the potential leader of a government of national unity from the reconvened parliament. Choudhry instead advised President Josefa Iloilo to dissolve parliament and call an election to re-establish constitutional rule. Baba then announced he was forming a new political party to contest the 2001 election. He subsequently launched the New Labour Unity Party in June 2001. Large numbers of anti-Chaudhry dissidents followed him out of the party into the New Labour Unity Party. The party won only 4.5% of the vote and two seats. Baba stood in Samabula Tamavua Open, but failed to secure election.

== Life outside politics ==
Baba waited until 2005 to reiterate and clarify his reasons for leaving the Labour Party. It was no longer the party he had joined under the leadership of Timoci Bavadra in the 1980s, he said on 18 September 2005. Bavadra&#x27;s vision had been of a multiracial Fiji, but the present leadership of the party could not see past ethnic boundaries. All that was left of Bavadra&#x27;s party was the name, he said. He expressed disappointment at Chaudhry&#x27;s failure as Leader of the Opposition to work with Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase on matters of national importance, saying that when the party negotiated with the government at all, it appeared more like a trade union than a political party. In a multiethnic country like Fiji, Baba said, it was imperative that leaders look beyond ethnic boundaries.

On 22 December 2005, Baba said that he would pursue academic and consultancy work after completing his four-year contract at the University of Auckland, which expired at the end of 2005. He was happy to be away from politics, he said, and was not inclined to return to it. He found recent political trends in Fiji depressing, especially the polarization of political parties on ethnic lines. Questioned again by the Fiji Village news service on 16 February, after his return to Fiji, he refused to be drawn on whether he would contest the 2006 election or not, but made it clear that he was no longer affiliated with the FLP.

In May 2005 he published the book &quot;Speight of Violence&quot;, coauthored by Baba, his partner Unaisi Nabobo-Baba, and New Zealand journalist Michael Field. The book gave a history of the 2000 coup, informed by excerpts from Baba’s secret diary kept while he was a hostage, and generated controversy with its claims that the Labour coalition had been planning to oust Chaudhry before the coup.

== 2006 return to politics ==
In March 2006 the SDL party approached Baba and asked him to be a candidate. He was subsequently approved as the party&#x27;s candidate for the Tamavua Samabula Open Constituency. His appointment was controversial as it bypassed the SDL&#x27;s normal selection procedures. Following his selection baba denounced the Fiji Labour party and the leadership of Mahendra Chaudhry, saying that the party was negative and had no future and that Fiji needed to end racial politics. However, he failed to secure a seat in Parliament.

Following the election, Baba was he was appointed to the Senate of Fiji as one of nine nominees of the Fijian government. In October 2006 he was nominated as Fiji&#x27;s Ambassador to the United Nations. This plan was aborted, however, by the 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état on 5 December. The Military later announced that Baba might face investigation for his alleged links to international fraudster Peter Foster.

== 2014 return to politics ==
Following the imprisonment of former prime minister and SDL leader Laisenia Qarase in 2012, Baba emerged as a &quot;de facto&quot; spokesperson for the party. When the SDL was dissolved by the military regime, he helped to found the Social Democratic Liberal Party (SDLP) as its successor. He briefly led the party in 2014, but made way for Ro Teimumu Kepa, a high chief and former Cabinet Minister. He was a candidate in the 2014 Fijian general election, but was not elected.

In September 2013 he was one of a number of prominent politicians arrested for protesting against the new constitution imposed by the military regime. He was arrested again and detained for a weekend in September 2016 after participating in a meeting to discuss the country&#x27;s constitution. No charges were laid.

In February 2017 following Sitiveni Rabuka becoming SODELPA leader he resigned from the party and joined the HOPE Party as a advisor.

== Death ==
Baba died on 14 July 2024, at the age of 82.

Formerly an independent municipality, with its own town council, it has been part of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality since 2000. Its heart is at the intersection of the N1 and N14 freeways. The R21 freeway also passes through the eastern part of Centurion.

The Waterkloof Air Force Base, as well as the Swartkop Air Force Base (which includes the South African Air Force Museum), are in Centurion.

==History==

=== Prehistoric ===
Fossils discovered at the Sterkfontein Caves show that hominids lived in the vicinity of Centurion between 2 and 3 million years ago. The Sterkfontein Caves, a World Heritage Site, is less than 50 km from Centurion, near Mogale City and Krugersdorp.

However, the earliest evidence of modern human habitation in the Centurion area does not go this far back. It dates back to 1200 AD when black African communities settled in this area. They cultivated lands, grazed their cattle, made earthenware containers and melted iron.

=== 19th century===

In 1841 the Erasmus family arrived and settled in the area. Daniel Jacobus Erasmus settled on the farm Zwartkop, Daniel Elardus Erasmus on the farm Doornkloof and Rasmus Elardus Erasmus developed the farm Brakfontein. Several of the suburbs like Erasmia, Elardus Park, Zwartkop and Doornkloof were named after these 19th-century owners of the land and their properties.

In 1849 Rev Andrew Murray visited the farm Doornkloof and christened 129 babies, heard the profession of faith of 29 new members of the Reformed Church and the next day, 29 December 1849, celebrated communion.

In 1889 Alois Hugo Nelmapius bought the northern and north-eastern portions of the farm Doornkloof and named it after his daughter Irene (who died in 1961).

==== First Anglo-Boer War ====
As part of the First Boer War, the battle for Rooihuiskraal (Afrikaans for &quot;Red House Kraal&quot;) took place in 1881 here. A Boer commando under the leadership of D.J. Erasmus Jr defeated Colonel Gildea, or &quot;The Blasted Colonel&quot; as they called him, the British Officer Commanding of the Pretoria Garrison. After the cornered British garrison tried to escape to Natal to join General George Pomeroy Colley, the Boers entrenched themselves behind a stone wall surrounding the animal stockade, and wounded the colonel in the backside, who was standing upright in his stirrups.

==== Second Anglo-Boer War ====

During the Second Boer War the Irene Concentration Camp was established in 1901 on the farm Doornkloof, as part of the British scorched earth policy, where Boer women and children were housed under extremely poor conditions. At its peak the camp had 5,500 inhabitants, mostly women and children. Between February 1901 and the end of the war in 1902, 1,249 lost their lives here, about 1,000 of them children. The Irene Camp Cemetery is well preserved and contains 576 of the original slate tombstones that were carved by hand in the camp.

=== 20th century ===
The town of Irene was established in 1902 when 337 plots were laid out on the farm Doornkloof. Jan Smuts later owned this farm, and died there in 1950. The original Smuts House is a museum today.

Centurion developed from the initial Lyttelton Township that was marked out on the farm Droogegrond in 1904. Lyttelton Manor Extension 1 was established in 1942. These two townships initially resorted under the Peri Urban Board in Pretoria.

Centurion was granted City Council status in 1962 as Lyttelton. It was formed by combining the areas of Doornkloof, Irene and Lyttelton.

=== Name changes and post-apartheid reorganisation ===
Lyttelton was renamed Verwoerdburg in 1967, after Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd, the former prime minister of South Africa who was assassinated the previous year. The surrounding areas, as they grew, came under the same name and Lyttelton became known as one of the suburbs of Verwoerdburg. Others included Clubview, Eldoraigne, Kloofsig, Wierdapark, Zwartkop and their extensions.

The name &quot;Centurion&quot; was chosen by residents in 1995 (without the option to retain the existing name), soon after the end of apartheid, to match the name of the Centurion Park (now called SuperSport Park) cricket stadium which is in the area. Following the end of apartheid, the Indian township of Laudium and surrounding suburbs including Erasmia and Claudius, which were formerly a part of Pretoria, were made part of Centurion. A black township, called Olievenhoutbosch, was established in Centurion at around the same time.

In 2000, the Centurion local government became part of the newly created City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality, which also includes Pretoria, and the town ceased to have its own Town Council.

=== Climate ===
Centurion is on the Highveld like Johannesburg and Pretoria and has a similar climate, with dry, sunny winters (max. daytime temperature around 20 °C dropping to an average minimum of 5 °C), and warm to hot summers (October – April) tempered by late-afternoon showers often accompanied by spectacular thunder and lightning. Hailstorms are not uncommon, but a serious hailstorm has not happened for many years. Summer temperatures range from the mid-20s to the mid-30s (°Celsius). Centurion&#x27;s weather tends to follow the slightly warmer Pretoria, when compared to that of Johannesburg.

The Hennops River flows through the heart of Centurion, and causes occasional flooding when heavy rainfall has occurred.

== Economy ==

=== Rapid growth ===
Centurion has come a long way from being a large town south of Pretoria, with smallholdings and large open spaces. Having experienced growth since 1994, like the rest of urban South Africa, many businesses have relocated there, and property development is boosting the ever-expanding city limits. This development has meant there is now little break between the outskirts of Pretoria to the north, and Midrand and Johannesburg to the south. The Gauteng Provincial Government predicted that, according to growth trends, much of the Gauteng province would be a megalopolis by 2015.

=== Centurion Aerospace Village ===
The Centurion Aerospace Village (CAV) was formally established in 2006 to create an aerospace supplier park where anchor firms are at the centre of the aerospace cluster and are supported by small and medium-sized producers. The supplier park is modelled on the local automotive industry and mirrors similar international parks, such as Silicon Valley, California, and Toulouse, France.

The CAV is in Pierre van Ryneveld Park, Tshwane, on state-owned land, adjacent to Aerosud Holdings, and along the eastern boundary of the Waterkloof Air Force Base. Aerosud was selected by the South African Department of Trade and Industry to be the industry driver and catalyst for this development.

The CAV development was made possible with the financial support of the European Union and the South African government, through the Sector-Wide Support Enterprise, Employment and Equity Programme (SWEEEP).

=== Infrastructure ===
Today Centurion features modern shopping malls (Centurion Mall, Mall@Reds, Forest Hill City Mall), several entertainment spots, a theatre, golf courses and a driving range. Several hotels including Irene Country Lodge as well as a plethora of smaller guest houses. The Unitas hospital is the largest private hospital on the African continent (including a helipad) and is part of the Netcare group. Technology companies like Aerosud, Accenture, Denel Dynamics, Siemens, SAAB Grintek Technologies, Telkom and others such as GMC Aircon are in Centurion. The Gautrain has a station in Centurion.

== Centurion Mall ==
Established in 1983 as &quot;Verwoerdburgstad&quot; (&quot;Verwoerdburg City&quot;), the Centurion Mall was constructed around the Centurion Lake (on the Hennops River) and was the only shopping centre with the standard big-name retailers of that time in Centurion until the 21st century. In 2003, the mall underwent its first major revamp which was estimated at around 250 million ZAR. 29,760 m2 of retail space was added to the mall bringing the mall&#x27;s total size to 105,000 m2, making it the second largest shopping centre in the Tshwane metropolitan area.

The mall was also known for its man-made colour water fountain amenity, which was in the centre of the lake, on the north side of the mall (known as the &#x27;bay&#x27; area). This water feature has been used as a &#x27;logo&#x27; for the former Centurion town council, seen at many of the entrances of the previous municipality.

<text>Korea Train eXpress (), often known as KTX (), is South Korea&#x27;s high-speed rail system, operated by Korail. Construction began on the high-speed line from Seoul to Busan in 1992. KTX services were launched on April 1, 2004.

From Seoul Station the KTX lines radiate with stops at Seoul Station, Yongsan station towards Busan and Gwangju. A new line from Wonju to Gangneung was completed in December 2017 to serve the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.

The current maximum operating speed for trains in regular service is , though the infrastructure is designed for .

The initial rolling stock was based on Alstom&#x27;s TGV Réseau, and was partly built in Korea. The domestically developed HSR-350x, which achieved in tests, resulted in a second type of high-speed trains now operated by Korail, the KTX-Sancheon, which entered into commercial service in 2010.

The next generation experimental electric multiple unit prototype, HEMU-430X, achieved in 2013, making South Korea the world&#x27;s fourth country after Japan, France and China to develop a high-speed train running on conventional rail above . It was further developed into commercialised variants, namely KTX-Eum and KTX-Cheongryong, with respective maximum service speeds of and , which entered into KTX services in 2021 and 2024, respectively.

In June 2024, South Korea and Uzbekistan concluded a KRW 270 billion (approximately US$196 million) deal to apply KTX technology in Uzbekistan by supplying high-speed trains and Korail expertise.

==History==
===Origins of the project===
The Seoul-Busan axis is Korea&#x27;s main traffic corridor. In 1982, it represented 65.8% of South Korea&#x27;s population, a number that grew to 73.3% by 1995, along with 70% of freight traffic and 66% of passenger traffic. With both the Gyeongbu Expressway and Korail&#x27;s Gyeongbu Line congested as of the late 1970s, the government saw the pressing need for another form of transportation.

The first proposals for a second Seoul-Busan railway line originated from a study prepared between 1972 and 1974 by experts from France&#x27;s SNCF and the Japan Railway Technical Service on a request from the IBRD. A more detailed 1978-1981 study by KAIST, focusing on the needs of freight transport, also came to the conclusion that separating long-distance passenger traffic on a high-speed passenger railway would be advisable, and it was adopted in the following Korean Five Year Plan.

During the following years, several feasibility studies were prepared for a high-speed line with a Seoul–Busan travel time of 1 hour 30 minutes, which gave positive results. In 1989, following the go-ahead for the project, the institutions to manage its preparation were established: the Gyeongbu High Speed Electric Railway &amp; New International Airport Committee, and the High Speed Electric Railway Planning Department (later renamed HSR Project Planning Board). In 1990, the planned Seoul–Busan travel time was 1 hour 51 minutes, the project was to be completed by August 1998, and costs were estimated at 5.85 trillion South Korean won (₩) in 1988 prices, 4.6 trillion of which were to be spent on infrastructure, the remainder on rolling stock.

As planning progressed, the Korea High Speed Rail Construction Authority (KHSRCA) was established in March 1992 as a separate body with its own budget responsible for the project. In the 1993 reappraisal of the project, the completion date was pushed back to May 2002, and cost estimates grew to ₩10.74 trillion. 82% of the cost increase was due to a 90% increase in unit costs in the construction sector, mostly labour costs but also material costs, and the remainder due to alignment changes. To finance the project, the option of a build-operate-transfer (BOT) franchise was rejected as too risky. Funding included direct government grants (35%), government (10%) and foreign (18%) loans, domestic bond sales (31%) and private capital (6%).

===Creation of the system===
====Start of high-speed line construction====

KHSRCA started construction of the Seoul–Busan Gyeongbu high-speed railway (Gyeongbu HSR) on June 30, 1992, on the long section from Cheonan to Daejeon, which was intended for use as test track.

Construction started before the choice of the main technology supplier, thus alignment design was set out to be compatible with all choices. Of the planned line, would be laid on bridges, and another in tunnels. However, plans were changed repeatedly, in particular those for city sections, following disputes with local governments, while construction work suffered from early quality problems. Planned operating speed was also reduced from to the maximum of high-speed trains on the market. Three competitors bid for the supply of the core system, which included the rolling stock, catenary and signalling: consortia led by GEC-Alsthom, today Alstom, one of the builders of France&#x27;s TGV trains; Siemens, one of the builders of Germany&#x27;s ICE trains; and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, one of the builders of Japan&#x27;s Shinkansen trains. In 1994, the alliance of GEC-Alsthom and its Korean subsidiary Eukorail were chosen as winner.

The technology was almost identical to that found on the high-speed lines of France&#x27;s TGV system. Track-related design specifications included a design speed of and standard gauge.

====Phase 1: Seoul–Daegu and conventional line upgrades====

Following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the government decided to realise the Gyeongbu HSR in two phases. In a first phase, two-thirds of the high-speed line between the southwestern suburbs of Seoul and Daegu would be finished by 2004, with trains travelling along the parallel conventional line along the rest of the Seoul–Busan route. The upgrade and electrification of these sections of the Gyeongbu Line was added to the project, and also the upgrade and electrification of the Honam Line from Daejeon to Mokpo, providing a second route for KTX services. The budget for the first phase was set at ₩12,737.7 billion, that for the entire project at ₩18,435.8 billion in 1998 prices. While the share of government contributions remained unchanged, the share of foreign loans, domestic bond sales and private capital changed to 24%, 29% and 2%.

The infrastructure and rolling stock were created in the framework of a technology transfer agreement, which paired up Korean companies with core system supplier Alstom and its European subcontractors for different subsystems. Alstom&#x27;s part of the project amounted to US$2.1 billion or €1.5 billion.

Well ahead of the opening of the Gyeongbu HSR for regular service, in December 1999, of the test section, later extended to , was finished to enable trials with trains. After further design changes, the high-speed tracks were finished over a length of , with of interconnections to the conventional Gyeongbu Line, including at a short interruption at Daejeon. The high-speed section itself included of viaducts and of tunnels. Conventional line electrification was finished over the across Daegu and on to Busan, the across Daejeon, and the from Daejeon to Mokpo and Gwangju. After 12 years of construction and with a final cost of ₩12,737.7 billion, the initial KTX system with the first phase of the Gyeongbu HSR went into service on April 1, 2004.

====Phase 2: Daegu–Busan, extra stations, urban sections====
The Daegu–Busan section of the Gyeongbu HSR became a separate project with the July 1998 project revision, with a budget of ₩5,698.1 billion, with funding from the government and private sources by the same ratios as for phase 1. In August 2006, the project was modified to again include the Daejeon and Daegu urban area passages, as well as additional stations along the phase 1 section. For these additions, the budget as well as the government&#x27;s share of the funding was increased.

Construction started in June 2002. The line, which follows a long curve to the northeast of the existing Gyeongbu Line, includes 54 viaducts with a total length of and 38 tunnels with a total length of . The two largest structures are the Geomjeung Tunnel, under Mount Geumjeong at the Busan end of the line; and the Wonhyo Tunnel, under Mount Cheonseong south-west of Ulsan, which will be the longest and second longest tunnels in Korea once the line is opened.

A long dispute concerning the environmental impact assessment of the Wonhyo Tunnel, which passes under a wetland area, caused delays for the entire project. The dispute gained nationwide and international attention due to the repeated hunger strikes of a Buddhist nun, led to a suspension of works in 2005, and only ended with a supreme court ruling in June 2006. With the exception of the sections across Daejeon and Daegu, the second phase went into service on November 1, 2010. By that time, ₩4,905.7 billion was spent out of a second phase budget, or ₩17,643.4 billion out of the total.

The two sections across the urban areas of Daejeon and Daegu, altogether , will be finished by 2014. As of October 2010, the total cost of the second phase was estimated at ₩7,945.4 billion, that for the entire project at ₩20,728.2 billion. The last element of the original project that was shelved in 1998, separate underground tracks across the Seoul metropolitan area, was re-launched in June 2008, when an initial plan with a long alignment and two new stations was announced.

===Further upgrades of connecting conventional lines===
The electrification and the completion of the re-alignment and double-tracking of the Jeolla Line, which branches from the Honam Line at Iksan and continues to Suncheon and Yeosu, began in December 2003, with the aim to introduce KTX services in time for the Expo 2012 in Yeosu. The upgrade will allow to raise top speed from . The section of the perpendicular Gyeongjeon Line from Samnangjin, the junction with the Gyeongbu Line near Busan, to Suncheon is upgraded in a similar way, with track doubling, alignment modifications and electrification for . The until Masan was opened on December 15, 2010. The upgrade is to be complete until Jinju by 2012 and Suncheon by 2014. The top speed of the AREX line, Seoul&#x27;s airport link, is to be raised from for the KTX.

The Ulsan–Gyeongju–Pohang section of the Donghae Line is foreseen for an upgrade in a completely new alignment that circumvents downtown Gyeongju and connects to the Gyeongbu High Speed Railway at Singyeongju Station, allowing for direct KTX access to the two cities. On April 23, 2009, the project was approved by the government and a ground-breaking ceremony was held. The altogether line is slated to be opened in December 2014.

On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. The main new element of the plan is to aim for top speeds of in upgrades of much of the mainline network with view to the introduction of KTX services. The conventional lines under the scope of the plan include the above, already on-going projects, and their extensions along the rest of the southern and eastern coasts of South Korea, lines along the western coast, lines north of Seoul, and the second, more easterly line between Seoul and Busan with some connecting lines.

===Further high-speed lines===
====Honam HSR====
Until 2006, the first plans for a second, separate high-speed line from Seoul to Mokpo were developed into the project of a line branching from the Gyeongbu HSR and constructed in two stages, the Honam High Speed Railway (Honam HSR). The budget for the first stage, from the new Osong Station on the Gyongbu HSR to Gwangju·Songjeong Station, was set at ₩8,569.5 billion. The second stage, the remaining to Mokpo, was to be finished by 2017 with a budget of ₩2,002.2 billion. The Osong-Iksan section of the first phase is also intended for use as high-speed test track for rolling stock development, to be fitted with special catenary and instrumented track. The ground-breaking ceremony was held on December 4, 2009. As of September 2010, progress was 9.6% of the project budget then estimated at ₩10,490.1 billion for the first phase, which was due for completion in 2014, while the estimate for the entire line stood at ₩12,101.7 billion.

====Suseo HSR====
First plans for the Honam HSR foresaw a terminus in Suseo station, southeast Seoul. The branch to Suseo was re-launched as a separate project, the Suseo High Speed Railway (Suseo HSR), in June 2008. Detailed design of the line is underway since September 2010, with opening planned by the end of 2014. For the longer term, new high-speed lines from Seoul to Sokcho on the eastern coast, and a direct branch from the Gyeongbu HSR south to Jinju and further to the coast are under consideration. In conjunction with the award of the 2018 Winter Olympics to PyeongChang in July 2011, KTX service via the eastern coast line was anticipated; the expected travel time there from Seoul is 50 minutes.

====Jeju Island====
In January 2009, the Korea Transport Institute also proposed a line from Mokpo to Jeju Island, putting Jeju 2 hours 26 minutes from Seoul. The line would include a bridge from Haenam to Bogil Island and a undersea tunnel from Bogil Island to Jeju Island (with a drilling station on Chuja Island), for an estimated cost of US$10 billion. As the proposal was popular with lawmakers from South Jeolla Province, the government is conducting a feasibility study, but the Jeju governor expressed skepticism. The Seoul-Jeju route is the world&#x27;s busiest air route with 13.7 million passengers (2023).
 However, Jeju Gov. Won Hee-ryong opposed this plan since it would ruin the island&#x27;s identity and make the Jeju economy more dependent on the mainland.

==Technology==
The shock absorption design absorbs 80 percent of the shock energy when the train crashes. Automatic ventilation is installed to prevent noise from occurring when trains enter and exit the tunnel. Articulated bogies help increase ride comfort and driving safety.

On June 14, 2024, Uzbekistan and South Korea finalized a US$196 million deal for KTX technology to be applied in Uzbekistan. This was the first time KTX technology was exported. As part of the deal, 42 train units capable of going up to were to be supplied for of rail in Uzbekistan. Operations were scheduled to begin in April 2027.

==Rolling stock==
===KTX-I===
The initial KTX-I trainsets, also known as simply KTX or as TGV-K, are based on the TGV Réseau, but with several differences. 46 trains were built - the initial twelve in France by Alstom, the remainder in South Korea by Rotem. The 20-car electric multiple units consist of two traction heads, which are powered end cars without passenger compartments, and eighteen articulated passenger cars, of which the two extreme ones have one motorised bogie each. A KTX-I was built to carry up to 935 passengers at a regular top speed of , later increased to .

===KTX-Sancheon===
For less frequented relations and for operational flexibility, a 2001 study proposed a train created by scaling down the planned commercial version of the HSR-350x, by shortening the train, removing powered bogies from intermediate cars, and lowering top speed.
Hyundai Rotem received orders for altogether 24 such trains, called KTX-II, in three batches from July 2006 to December 2008.

Design speed is , and revenue service speed is . The power electronics uses newer technology than the HSR-350x, and the front is a new design, too. The trainsets, of which two can be coupled together, consist of two traction heads and eight articulated passenger cars, and seat 363 passengers in two classes, with enhanced comfort relative to the KTX-I. The domestic added value of the trains was increased to 87%, compared to 58% for the KTX-I. Imported parts include the pantographs, semiconductors in the power electronics, front design, couplers and final drives.

The train was developed on the basis of the transferred TGV technology, but more advanced technology was used for the new motors, power electronics and additional brake systems, while the passenger cars were made of aluminum to save weight, and the nose was a new design with reduced aerodynamic drag. Test runs were conducted between 2002 and 2008, in the course of which HSR-350x achieved the South Korean rail speed record of on December 16, 2004.

The KTX-II was officially renamed as KTX-Sancheon () after the Korean name of the indigenous fish cherry salmon before the first units started commercial service on March 2, 2010.

However within weeks of its initial launch, mechanical and design flaws began to appear, in some cases causing trains to stop running and forcing passengers to leave the train and walk back to the station, and in one particular case derailing from the tracks on February 11, 2011. Although the trains were designed to be a domestically built replacement for the French built Alstrom trains, due to over 30 malfunctions since March 2, 2010, Korail asked manufacturer Hyundai-Rotem to recall all 19 of the trains in operation after finding cracks in two anchor bands in May 2011.
 Following the recall, the KTX-Sancheon trains were put back in service.

In addition to the 24 initial KTX-Sancheon trains, which form the KTX-Sancheon Class 11, new batches have been ordered and delivered since, to provide service on the new Honam, Suseo and Gyeonggang lines. For the opening of the Honam HSR line, 22 trainsets, named Class 12, were delivered ahead of the 2015 opening. In addition, 10 trainsets have been delivered to provide service on the Suseo line, scheduled to open in December 2016 (Class 13), and 15 trainsets (Class 14) have been ordered for the Gyeonggang Line, which opened in late 2017 ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics.

=== KTX-Eum ===
KTX-Eum is South Korea&#x27;s first high-speed electric multiple unit train, being a commercialised version of the experimental HEMU-430X previously tested by Korail. It has the maximum service speed of and is aimed for serving semi-high-speed railway lines.

The KTX-Eum entered service on Jungang Line on January 4, 2021, operating between electrified section of Cheongnyangni and Andong. It was also introduced on Gangneung Line since August 1, 2021, replacing KTX-Sancheon which would be redeployed to other KTX lines.

A further order of 14 six-car units was placed in December 2016, both orders are to be delivered in 2020–2021.

=== KTX-Cheongryong ===
KTX-Cheongryong is a sister train of KTX-Eum, but a trainset consists of eight cars as opposed to six cars. It has the maximum service speed of and is aimed for supplementing trainsets for current high-speed rail services.

In 2016, a contract was concluded between Korail and Hyundai Rotem to build 2 pre-series sets of KTX-Cheongryong. These trainsets entered service on the Gyeongbu high-speed railway and Honam high-speed railway on May 1, 2024.

Another 17 trainsets ordered by Korail are scheduled to be delivered between April 2027 and March 2028.

== List of KTX lines ==
===Current lines===
===Future lines===
===Defunct lines===
==Operation==

Following a phase of test operation, regular KTX service started on April 1, 2004, with a maximum speed of achieved along the finished sections of the Gyeongbu HSR. In response to frequent passenger complaints regarding speeds on the video display staying just below the advertised 300 mark, operating top speed was raised to on November 26, 2007.

===Services===

KTX services are grouped according to their route, and within the groups, the stopping pattern changes from train to train. KTX trains not deviating from the Seoul–Busan corridor are operated as the Gyeongbu KTX service. In 2004, the new service cut the route length from , and the fastest trains, serving four stations only, cut the minimum Seoul–Busan travel time from the Saemaul&#x27;s 4 hours 10 minutes to 2 hours 40 minutes. With the extension of the Gyeongbu HSR, from November 1, 2010, the minimum Seoul–Busan travel time reduced to 2 hours 18 minutes, over a travel distance of . From December 1, 2010, Korail added a pair of non-stop trains with a travel time of 2 hours 8 minutes. Once the sections across Daejeon and Daegu are completed, cutting the Seoul–Busan travel distance to , plans foresee a further improvement of the four-stop travel time to 2 hours and 10 minutes.

Because both KTX and conventional trains in South Korea share a rail gauge (unlike in Japan), KTX trains can run on both networks dramatically increasing the number of destinations served.

Some Gyeongbu KTX services use parts of the conventional line paralleling the high-speed line. From June 2007 until October 2010, some trains left the Gyeongbu HSR between Daejeon and Dongdaegu to serve Gimcheon and Gumi before the opening of an extra station for the two cities on the high-speed line. From November 1, 2010, when most Gyeongbu KTX services began to use the new Daegu–Busan high-speed section, some trains remained on the Gyeongbu Line on that section, and additional trains began to use the Gyeongbu Line on the Seoul–Daejeon section to serve Suwon.

KTX trains using the Gyeongbu HSR only from Seoul to Daejeon and continuing all along the Honam Line are operated as the Honam KTX service. In 2004, the new service with a route length of between Yongsan in Seoul and Mokpo cut minimum travel time from 4 hours 42 minutes to 2 hours 58 minutes. By 2017, this time is to be cut further to 1 hours 46 minutes.

On December 15, 2010, the new Gyeongjeon KTX service started with a minimum travel time of 2 hours 54 minutes over the long route between Seoul and Masan. The service is to be extended to Jinju by 2012. A fourth line, the Jeolla KTX service will connect Seoul to Yeosu in 3 hours 7 minutes from September 2011. From 2014, with the completion of the first phase of the Honam HSR, the travel time is reduced further to 2 hours 25 minutes. From 2015, KTX trains are to reach Pohang from Seoul in 1 hour 50 minutes.

=== Tickets and seats ===
==== Type of seats ====
KTX offers two classes: First Class and Standard Class. Tickets also specify whether a seat is forward-facing or backward-facing according to the direction of travel. First Class seats are arranged 2+1 across the train and Standard Class seats are configured 2+2. There are special reserved Family seats, which are grouped in four, including 2 forward-facing and 2 backward-facing seats. There are reserved seats and unassigned seats. KTX trains have no restaurant cars or bars, only seat service. From 2006, one car of selected KTX services functions as a moving cinema.

==== Ticket prices ====

KTX fares were designed to be about halfway between those for conventional trains and airline tickets. The fare system implemented at the start of service in April 2004 deviated from prices proportional with distance, to favour long-distance trips. On April 25, 2005, fares were selectively reduced for relations under-performing most.

From November 1, 2006, due to rising energy prices, Korail applied an 8-10% fare hike for various train services, including 9.5% for KTX. The price of a Seoul-Busan Standard Class ticket increased to 48,100 won. From July 1, 2007, KTX fares were hiked another 6.5%, while those for the slower Saemaeul and Mugunghwa services on the parallel conventional route were raised by 3.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. However, new reduced weekday and unassigned seat fares were also introduced.

After the November 1, 2010, start of service on the Daegu–Busan section of the Gyeongbu HSR, the fare for KTX trains using the new section was set about 8% higher than for the old route via Miryang, while that for the new services via Suwon was set lower.

==== Discounts ====
Korail&#x27;s standard discounts for children, disabled, seniors and groups apply on KTX trains, too. For frequent travellers, Korail&#x27;s standard discount cards, which are categorised according to age group, apply with the double of the standard discount rates; while discount cards for business and government agency workers apply with the normal rate; both types of discounts are up to 30%. Season period tickets with discounts of up to 60% can also apply to KTX trains.

Discounts for family seats (37.5%) and backward facing seats (5%) are specific to the KTX. In addition to Korail&#x27;s small general discounts for tickets purchased in a vending machine, via cell phone or the internet, discounts of 5–20% apply to a limited number of seats on KTX trains when purchased in advance. For travellers who transfer to other long-distance trains towards destinations beyond KTX stops, transfer tickets with 30% discount apply. Korail pays a refund for late KTX trains, which reaches 100% for trains with a delay above one hour.

Korea Rail Pass, a period ticket Korail offers to foreigners, also applies to KTX. For passengers using the Korea-Japan Joint Rail Pass, a joint offer of Korail, Japanese railways and ferry services, the discount on KTX trains is 30%.

===Passenger numbers and usage===
====Forecasts====

When the project was launched, KTX was expected to become one of the world&#x27;s busiest high-speed lines. The first study in 1991 forecast around 200,000 passengers a day in the first year of operation, growing to 330,000 passengers a day twelve years later. In forecasts prepared after the decision to split the project into two phases, the expected first year ridership of Gyeongbu KTX services was reduced by about 40%. With the estimate for the Honam KTX services added to the plan, opening year forecasts ranged between 150,000 and 175,000 passengers a day. Actual initial ridership after the opening of the first phase in 2004 was well short of initial expectations at around half of the final forecast.

In October 2010, before the opening of the second phase, Korail expected ridership to rise from the then current 106,000 to 135,000 passengers a day.

====Ridership evolution====

KTX was introduced on 1 April 2004. In the first 100 days, daily passenger numbers averaged 70,250, generating an operational revenue of about 2.11 billion won per day, 54% of what was expected. On January 14, 2005, Prime Minister Lee Hae Chan stated that &quot;the launch of KTX was a classic policy failure&quot; due to construction costs significantly above and passenger numbers well below forecasts. However, ridership increased by over a third on the Gyeongbu KTX and over a half on the Honam KTX in two years. Financial break-even was forecast at a ridership level of around 100,000 passengers a day, which was expected by the end of 2006.

The 100 millionth rider was carried after 1116 days of operation on April 22, 2007, when cumulative income stood at 2.78 trillion won. KTX finances moved into the black in 2007. The next year, with revenues equal to US$898 million and costs equal to US$654 million, KTX was Korail&#x27;s most profitable branch.

By the sixth anniversary in April 2010, KTX trains travelled a total 122.15 million kilometres, carrying 211.01 million passengers. Punctuality gradually improved from 86.7% of trains arriving within 5 minutes of schedule in 2004 to 98.3% in 2009. In 2009, the average daily ridership was 102,700. As of April 2010, the single-day ridership record stood at 178,584 passengers, achieved on January 26, 2009, the Korean New Year.

By the tenth anniversary KTX had travelled a total 240 million kilometres, carrying 414 million passengers.

====Market share and effect====

The introduction of high-speed services had the strongest effect on long-distance relations with a significant portion of the journey on the high-speed line, like Seoul–Busan: KTX took both the majority of the market and the bulk of rail passengers in the first year already, increasing the total share of rail from around two-fifths to a market dominating two-thirds by 2008. On long-distance relations with significant distances along conventional lines and resulting more modest travel time gains, that is along the Honam Line, the KTX and overall rail market share gain decreases with distance. On medium-distance relations like Seoul–Daejeon, KTX gained market share mostly at the expense of normal rail express services and air traffic, and helped to increase the total share of rail. On short-distance intercity relations line Seoul–Cheonan, due to the modest gains in time and the location of KTX stops outside city cores, KTX gains were at the expense of conventional rail, while intercity rail&#x27;s modal share was little changed.

By 2007, provincial airports suffered from deficits after a drop in the number of passengers attributed to the KTX. With lower ticket prices, by 2008, KTX has swallowed up around half of the airlines&#x27; previous demand between Seoul and Busan (falling from 5.3 million passengers in 2003 to 2.4 million). Though some low-cost carriers failed and withdrew from the route, others still planned to enter competition even at the end of 2008. Budget airlines achieved a 5.6% growth in August 2009 over the same month a year earlier while KTX ridership decreased by 1.3%, a trend change credited to the opening of Seoul Subway Line 9, which improved Gimpo International Airport&#x27;s connection to southern Seoul.

In the first two months after the launch of the second phase of the Gyeongbu HSR, passenger numbers on flights between Gimpo and Ulsan Airports dropped 35.4% compared to the same period a year earlier, those between Gimpo and Pohang Airports 13.2%. Between Gimpo Airport and Busan&#x27;s Gimhae International Airport, airline passenger numbers remained stable (+0.2%), as a consequence of a budget airline competing with large discounts and aggressive marketing. In the first month of Gyeongjeon KTX service, express bus services between Seoul and Masan or Changwon experienced 30–40% drops in ridership.

===Technical and operational issues===
====State of infrastructure====
Lawmakers criticised the safety of Korail&#x27;s tunnels after the Ministry of Construction and Transportation submitted data to the National Assembly on June 13, 2005. The ministry added fire prevention standards to high-speed line design standards only in November 2003, thus they weren&#x27;t applied to the by then finished tunnels of the first phase of KTX. Consequently, few tunnels had emergency exits, and in high-speed railway tunnels, the average walking distance in case of an emergency was , with a maximum of , against a norm of emergency exits every in other countries. A contingency plan for fires in KTX tunnels was incorporated into a national disaster manual in November 2005.

On October 5, 2008, it was revealed by lawmakers that inside Hwanghak Tunnel, from December 2004, inspectors have monitored the progression of several cracks and minor track displacements, which continued after maintenance work in March–April 2007 and again in March 2008. The operator claimed that a February 2007 on-site inspection found the problems not safety-relevant, but pledged further maintenance, and an investigation into the causes was launched. Tunnel reinforcement was under way in 2010.

====Incidents and accidents====

Operation irregularities mostly concerned the rolling stock, but also signalling, power glitches and track problems. The number of incidents decreased from 28 in the first month to 8 in the fifth. The failure rate decreased sharply by the fifth year of operation. Later, in the first eight months of regular service until October 2010, KTX-II trains broke down 12 times. Causes for breakdowns in the first years of operation involved inexperienced staff and insufficient inspection during maintenance.

Lawmakers from the Grand National Party published an investigation in October 2006 and expressed concern about the practice to use parts from other trains for spare parts, but Korail stated that that is standard practice in case of urgency with no safety effect, and the supply of spare parts is secured. Korail is also conducting a localisation program to develop replacements for two dozen imported parts.

On June 13, 2007, near Cheongdo on the upgraded Daegu–Busan section, a damper acting between two cars of a KTX train got free at one end due to a loose screw and hit the trackbed, throwing up ballast that hit cars and caused bruises to two people on the parallel road, until the train was stopped when passengers noticed smoke.

On November 3, 2007, an arriving KTX-I train collided with a parked KTX-I train inside Busan Station, resulting in material damage of 10 billion won and light injuries to two persons. The accident happened because the driver had fallen asleep and disabled the train protection system, and led to the trial and conviction of the driver. The railway union criticised single driver operation in conjunction with the two and a half hours rest time the driver had between shifts.

On February 11, 2011, a KTX-Sancheon train bound for Seoul from Busan derailed on a switch in a tunnel before Gwangmyeong Station, when travelling at around . No casualties were reported, only one passenger suffered slight injury, but KTX traffic was blocked for 29 hours while repairs were completed. Preliminary investigation indicated that the accident resulted from a series of human errors. Because workers improperly repaired a point along the tracks. Investigators found that the derailment was caused by a switch malfunction triggered by a loose nut from track, and suspected that a repairman failed to tighten it during maintenance the previous night. The switch&#x27;s detectors signalled a problem earlier, however, a second maintenance crew failed to find the loose nut and didn&#x27;t properly communicate the fact to the control center, which then allowed the train on the track. The rail union criticised Korail&#x27;s use of hired repairmen. there were no problems with the train according to investigation.

On July 15, 2011, 150 passengers were evacuated from a train when smoke started coming out of the train when it arrived at Miryang station at 11:30 AM. On July 17, 2011, at around 11 AM, a train stopped abruptly and stranded some 400 passengers in the Hwanghak Tunnel for over an hour. The train resumed service after emergency repairs to a malfunctioning motor. A Korail spokesperson stated that the reason for the stop was due to &quot;faults in the motor block that supplies power to the wheels&quot;. The same day, the air conditioning broke down on another train leaving Busan at 1:45 PM. Over 800 passengers were transferred to another train at Daejeon when the problem could not be fixed.

On December 7, 2018, a KTX train carrying 198 passengers derailed about five minutes after leaving Gangneung for Seoul injuring 15 passengers. The train was traveling at about 103 km/h when almost all of its cars left the rails.

On January 5, 2022, a KTX-Sancheon train bound for Busan from Seoul carrying 303 passengers and crew derailed at 12:58 PM while passing a tunnel in Yeongdong of North Chungcheong Province, about 215 kilometers south of Seoul, injuring 7 passengers. The train was traveling at about 200 km/h when it partially derailed, resulting in a bogie wheel from car number 4 running off the track before being violently ejected from the train, throwing up ballast and causing structural damage to train cars. Subsequent KTX traffic was rerouted via the standard line, resulting in severe delays. Initially, it was believed that the derailment was caused by the train colliding with debris while passing Yeongdong Tunnel. However, evidence gathered from further investigation show that the missing bogie wheel was found inside Otan Tunnel, which is about 4 km before Yeongdong Tunnel, leading the investigating team to believe the train derailed due to faults within the wheel bogie assembly rather than from impact with debris.

====Passenger comfort and convenience====

Passenger surveys in the first months found that the limited capacity of bus connections and the lack of subway connections for intermediate stations, especially the newly built stations Gwangmyeong and Cheonan-Asan, was the problem mentioned most often. A better connection to Cheonan-Asan Station was provided by an extension of Seoul Subway Line 1 along the Janghang Line, opened on December 14, 2008. Gwangmyeong Station was linked to the same subway line by a shuttle service on December 15, 2006, but it made little impact due to the longtime differences between KTX and subway train schedules.

The noise level in the trains during tunnel passages was also subject to passenger complaints. This was referred to as a tunnel effect; it referred to both noise and vibration of the train when traveling through two specific tunnels. The tunnel effect was specifically noted as a reason for passenger dissatisfaction. Sound waves that are generally dispersed in an open environment are reflected against the tunnel walls, which causes the sound waves to come in contact with the passenger cabin and produces noise.

A reduction by 3–4 dB was achieved by retrofitting all trains with longer mud flaps at car ends until May 2006 to smooth the airflow at the articulated car joints. However, measurements in 2009 found significantly higher interior noise levels at some locations in two tunnels. Window thickness and sound insulation was improved in the KTX-II. The rails for high-speed trains like the KTX are welded together via a special techniques that make the rail a solid continuous rail; this method reduces the noise volume, which is produced by the wheels&#x27; contact with the rail, but it is not eliminated.

The isolation of KTX-I trains against pressure variations during tunnel passages was insufficient for some passengers, leading to efforts to reinforce pressurization in newer generations of trains. Pressure variations have been known to cause passengers to experience ringing in their ears; the ventilation systems on the passenger cabins are sealed when the train enters a tunnel in order to reduce the pressure changes. Pressure variations were not the only train cabin-associated complaint; KTX passengers were also known to have been negatively affected by inconsistent speeds of the trains.

Some KTX passengers found high-speed travel in backwards facing seats dizzying. Along with dizziness, feelings of nausea, headache, and sleepiness could also be experienced. Motion sickness was also noted as having had a minimal effect on KTX passengers; however, it still made an impact on passenger ride comfort. When the original seats were selected for the KTX trains, the anthropometry of the main consumers, who were largely expected to be Korean, were not considered. The seat design was found to have a significant effect on how passengers on the KTX trains rated the experience of their trip. Among the various factors that were considered to be vectors of discomfort were the angle of joints and specific areas of pressure, which were discovered to be present after an analysis of questionnaires that were completed by recent passengers. The factors of the seats of concern to KTX passengers were the shape, pitch, width, and the amount of legroom between the rows of seats. Swivel seats, which can be turned into the direction of travel, installed only on First Class in KTX-I trains, were made standard on both classes on newer generations of trains.

Studies have shown that term &quot;ride comfort&quot; has been used as an all-encompassing term for the KTX passengers&#x27; over all experience on the trains. While the KTX train is based on the French TGV model, it is considered to be more comfortable. The passengers&#x27; overall experience with regards to over-all ride comfort has been looked at as a combination of their physical health and emotional state. Fares were not included in the aforementioned questionnaires on ride comfort as there were variations in pricing due to seat arrangement, as well as weekday/weekend rates.

<text>Woleai (), also known as Oleai, is a coral atoll of 22 islands in the western Caroline Islands in the Pacific Ocean, forming a legislative district in the Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia, and located approximately west-northwest of Ifalik and northeast of Eauripik. Woleai is also the name of the largest of the islets constituting the atoll, lying to the northeast.

The population of the atoll was 1,081 in 2000, on an area of 4.5 km2.

==Geography==
The islands constitute a double atoll forming the number eight, with a total length of and up to wide; however, most of reef on the southern rim is submerged or poorly developed. The northern and eastern rims have several relatively large islets. The western lagoon is deeper and larger than its eastern counterpart. Both components are part of the same seamount. The total land area for both components combined is only .
==History==
The Austronesian ancestors of the Micronesians who make up the indigenous population of the Caroline Islands arrived in the islands . Woleai subsequently became culturally unique among the Caroline Islands because of a script in use among some speakers of the Woleaian language prior to 1913. Woleai was among islands to the southeast of Yap that became tributaries of the Yapese Empire from about 1500 CE.

Woleai came under the control of the Spanish Empire in 1686, governed along with the rest of the Caroline Islands as part of the Spanish East Indies. Spain sold the islands to the German Empire in 1899. In 1914, in the early weeks of World War I, the Empire of Japan seized German possessions in the Pacific, including Woleai. Assigned a League of Nations mandate to administer the islands after the war in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, Japan subsequently administered Woleai under the South Seas Mandate.

In 1944, as Allied forces closed in on the Mariana Islands during World War II, a contingent of 6,426 troops from the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s 50th Independent Mixed Brigade and the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s 44th Base Guard Unit and 216th Base Construction Unit heavily fortified Woleai. They completely leveled Wolfe Islet and made it into an airfield with a single runway and taxiway. They also constructed a seaplane anchorage off the southwest corner of Woleai Islet and established a weather station on Mariaon island to the west. Allied aircraft bombed the atoll and its military facilities on numerous occasions until the middle of 1945, driving its defenders underground and isolating them from supplies or reinforcements. By the surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945, only 1,650 survivors remained of the initial 6,426-strong Japanese garrison, the rest having perished largely because of starvation and disease rather than directly in Allied air raids. The United States Navy destroyer escort picked up the surviving Japanese on September 17, 1945.

Following World War II, the atoll came under the control of the United States. The United States administered Woleai as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, a United Nations trust territory, from 1947 until 1979, when Woleai became part of the independent Federated States of Micronesia.

==Education==
Public schools:
* Woleai High School

==Transportation==

Woleai Civil Airfield, administered by the Federated States of Micronesia Division of Civil Aviation is located at an altitude of on Falalap at , southeast of Yap International Airport and northeast of the main settlements on the island. The runway has not been maintained since 1992, and the airfield has closed due to severe deterioration of the runway and the government&#x27;s decision not to perform repairs. The runway is now covered with vegetation. Before the airfield closed, Caroline Islands Air provided chartered flights to it. The runway was built by the Empire of Japan during World War II. After the war it was shortly US Naval Base Woleai, Fleet Post Office #3246.

<text>Soft single skin kites are the least complex of all the power kites. 

The best known design is the NASA Parawing or NPW. For more, see rogallo wing. This is a very simple kite with mixed performance. It has excellent pull, but is slow to maneuver and suffers from a limited wind window.
Its simple construction and forgiving design make it very popular among hobbyists and some traction enthusiasts, especially ski- and sledge-borne expeditions across both Arctic and Antarctic lands, but its drawbacks make it unsuitable for high efficiency and many water-borne sports.

There are also soft single skin kites designed to be used on sailing ships as a free flying spinnaker substitute. There are significant advantages to having the spinnaker catching wind further above the surface of the water than is normal. This design was tested in the 2002 Louis Vuitton Regatta by the Oracle Americas Cup team.</text><links>

<text>A signature dish is a recipe that identifies an individual chef or restaurant. Ideally it should be unique and allow an informed gastronome to name the chef in a blind tasting. It can be thought of as the culinary equivalent of an artist finding their own style, or an author finding their own voice. In practice a chef&#x27;s signature dish often changes with time or they may claim several signature dishes.

In a weaker sense, a signature dish may become associated with an individual restaurant, particularly if the chef who created it is no longer with the establishment. It can also be used to refer to a culinary region, in which case its meaning may be the equivalent of &quot;national dish&quot;. In many cases, restaurants will base their menu development on tastes and styles which are unique to the restaurant&#x27;s geographical location. Local produce, restaurant décor, and even the type of building you choose can all contribute to a larger yield by taking on local sensibilities.

At its weakest, the term can simply mean &quot;chef&#x27;s specials&quot;. Under this definition, they are in no way unique, or even particularly unusual.

<doc id="523497" wikidata="Q915955" url="?curid=523497" title="Brigid Berlin">
<text>Brigid Emmett Berlin (September 6, 1939 – July 17, 2020), also known as Brigid Polk, was an American artist and Warhol superstar.

== Life and career ==

=== Early years ===
Berlin was born on September 6, 1939, in Manhattan in New York City. She was the eldest of three daughters born to socialite parents, Muriel (Johnson) &quot;Honey&quot; Berlin and Richard E. Berlin. Her father was chairman of the Hearst media empire for 32 years.

As a child, Berlin regularly mixed with celebrities and the powerful:
I would pick up the phone and it would be Richard Nixon. My parents entertained Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, and there were lots of Hollywood people because of San Simeon – Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, Dorothy Kilgallen... I have a box of letters, written to my parents in the late 1940s and 1950s from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.

Her socialite mother frequently worried about Brigid&#x27;s weight and constantly attempted to get her to lose it through any means, from giving her cash for every pound she lost at age 11 to having the family doctor prescribe amphetamines and dexedrine. Berlin recalled, &quot;My mother wanted me to be a slim, respectable socialite. Instead, I became an overweight troublemaker.&quot;

She was briefly married to John Parker, a window dresser. They married in 1960 and later divorced. As Andy Warhol observed in his book &quot;Popism&quot;: &quot;When Brigid brought her window dresser fiancé home to meet the family, her mother told the doorman to tell him to wait on a bench across the street in Central Park. Then she handed Brigid her wedding present – a hundred dollar bill – and told her to go to Bergdorf&#x27;s and buy herself some new underwear with it. Then she added, &#x27;Good luck with that fairy.&#x27;&quot;

She had three siblings, all younger: sister Richie, who was, for a time, the roommate of Warhol Films&#x27; &quot;It Girl&quot; and superstar Edie Sedgwick; youngest sister Christina &quot;Chrissy&quot; Berlin, who was instrumental in engineering the defection of Russian ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov; and the youngest sibling, brother Richard Berlin Jr.

=== Association with Andy Warhol ===
After several years as a reluctant debutante and a failed marriage, Brigid Berlin met Andy Warhol in 1964 and quickly became a central member of his entourage. After moving to Hotel Chelsea, she took on the nickname Brigid Polk because of her habit of giving out &#x27;pokes&#x27;, injections of Vitamin B and amphetamines. These injections were readily available through the many &#x27;Doctor Feelgoods&#x27; in New York and perfectly legal.

Berlin appeared in several of Warhol&#x27;s films, including &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; (1966), in which she is seen injecting herself while performing a monologue, and &quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot; (1972), which starred Edie Sedgwick. 

She was known for her obsessive taping and photographing of everyday life. Selections from these tapes were later compiled by Anthony Ingrassia to form the play &quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s Pork&quot;. Other tapes made by her were the basis for &quot;Live at Max&#x27;s Kansas City&quot; (recorded 1970, released 1972), The Velvet Underground&#x27;s first live album.

Berlin was complicit in one of Warhol&#x27;s more infamous pranks when, in 1969, Warhol announced that all of his paintings were the work of Berlin. Brigid enthusiastically followed this line when interviewed by &quot;Time&quot;. The prank led to a drop in the value of Warhol&#x27;s work, and both parties eventually retracted their statements. The question of authorship looms large in valuing Warhol&#x27;s paintings to this day.

In 1975, Berlin began work as a permanent employee for Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Interview&quot; magazine, a position that she held until well after Warhol&#x27;s death. Berlin transcribed interviews as well as knitted under the desk. Patricia Hearst (a close friend of Berlin who began work at &quot;Interview&quot; in 1988) observed &quot;On my first day at work, I noticed two small pugs who seemed to have the run of the castle. They belonged to a woman who sat behind the front desk every day from 9:00 to 5:00, but who never seemed to answer the phone. Instead, she compulsively knitted, ate bags of candy and tended lovingly to the dogs.&quot;

=== Later years ===
Berlin appeared in minor parts in two John Waters&#x27; films: &quot;Serial Mom&quot; (1994) and &quot;Pecker&quot; (1998). 

&quot;Pie in the Sky: The Brigid Berlin Story&quot; (2000) is a documentary in which she tells her life story in intimate detail and breaks her diet by consuming an entire meal of key lime pies. In its review, &quot;Variety&quot; suggests &quot;Berlin comes across as a rather sad character despite her colorful and provocative life.&quot;

== Death ==
After experiencing health issues for several years that mainly kept her confined to her bed, Berlin died at the age of 80 on July 17, 2020, in a Manhattan hospital.

==Works==

=== Paintings ===
Although Berlin did not consider herself an artist, it has been argued by some that her artwork was both influential to Andy Warhol&#x27;s and simultaneously overshadowed by Warhol&#x27;s celebrity and output. Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Tit Prints&quot; were artworks created using her bare breasts. Berlin would dip her breasts into multiple colored paints and then create a print by pressing them down onto canvas/paper. The Tit Prints are arguably Berlin&#x27;s most infamous work and were exhibited by Jane Stubbs at a gallery on Madison Avenue in 1996. On occasion, Berlin would publicly create Tit Prints, integrating visual art and performance art that &quot;is totally not about nudity, this is about, you know, art.&quot; She performed this act live at the Gramercy International Art Fair. After experiencing the performance, filmmaker John Waters later said &quot;I think that she&#x27;s the most unselfconscious nude person...[She has] great confidence for a fat girl.&quot;

Berlin also compiled and maintained scrapbooks that she referred to as &quot;trip books.&quot; Volumes of these scrapbooks collecting cartoons and sketches of male genitalia were known as &quot;The Cock Book&quot; and included the genitalia of artists such as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Warhol. Three volumes of &quot;The Cock Book&quot; sold for $175,000 at auction to artist Richard Prince.

=== Photography ===
Both Berlin and Warhol used the medium of Polaroid photography obsessively, and are said to have been very competitive in the Polaroid film department, whether over the best equipment or the best film. In 1969–1970 German art dealer Heiner Friedrich did a small showing of Berlin&#x27;s work called &quot;Polaroids and Tapes&quot; and created a catalogue for the work of the same name. The experimental nature of Berlin&#x27;s double-exposed Polaroids transcend the static, emotionless &quot;icon&quot; Polaroids of Warhol&#x27;s, clearly showing the power of her personal vision and photographic style. Common subject matter of Berlin&#x27;s Polaroids are self-portraits, Warhol Superstars, other artists and celebrities, and Off-Broadway one-woman shows. A one-woman show of her Polaroid self-portraits titled &quot;It&#x27;s All About Me&quot; showed in 2015 at the Invisible-Exports Gallery in New York City. The &quot;New York Times&quot; review stated &quot;Ms. Berlin&#x27;s prints seem less of a lark and more like a strident, celebratory statement by an artist who was never shy about exposing...well, anything.&quot;

Berlin&#x27;s digitized archives were published in 2015 as &quot;Brigid Berlin Polaroids&quot; with a foreword by John Waters. A review of the book in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; notes that Berlin was also the first person Andy Warhol allowed to photograph his body after the 1968 assassination attempt.

<text>Iconography, as a branch of art history, studies the identification, description and interpretation of the content of images: the subjects depicted, the particular compositions and details used to do so, and other elements that are distinct from artistic style. The word &quot;iconography&quot; comes from the Greek (&quot;image&quot;) and (&quot;to write&quot; or &quot;to draw&quot;).

A secondary meaning (based on a non-standard translation of the Greek and Russian equivalent terms) is the production or study of the religious images, called &quot;icons&quot;, in the Byzantine and Orthodox Christian tradition. This usage is mostly found in works translated from languages such as Greek or Russian, with the correct term being &quot;icon painting&quot;.

In art history, &quot;an iconography&quot; may also mean a particular depiction of a subject in terms of the content of the image, such as the number of figures used, their placing and gestures. The term is also used in many academic fields other than art history, for example semiotics, media studies, and archaeology, and in general usage, for the content of images, the typical depiction in images of a subject, and related senses.

Sometimes distinctions have been made between &quot;iconology&quot; and &quot;iconography&quot;, although the definitions, and so the distinction made, varies. 
When referring to movies, genres are immediately recognizable through their iconography, motifs that become associated with a specific genre through repetition.

==Scholarship==

=== Foundations ===
Early Western writers who took special note of the content of images include Giorgio Vasari, whose &quot;Ragionamenti&quot; interpreted the paintings in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. &quot;Ragionamenti&quot; reassuringly demonstrates that such works were difficult to understand even for well-informed contemporaries. Lesser known, though it had informed poets, painters and sculptors for over two centuries after its 1593 publication, was Cesare Ripa&#x27;s emblem book &quot;Iconologia&quot;. Gian Pietro Bellori, a 17th-century biographer of artists of his own time, describes and analyses, not always correctly, many works. Lessing&#x27;s study (1796) of the classical figure Amor with an inverted torch was an early attempt to use a study of a type of image to explain the culture it originated in, rather than the other way round. 

Iconography as an academic art historical discipline developed in the nineteenth century in the works of scholars such as Adolphe Napoleon Didron (1806–1867), Anton Heinrich Springer (1825–1891), and Émile Mâle (1862–1954) all specialists in Christian religious art, which was the main focus of study in this period, in which French scholars were especially prominent. They looked back to earlier attempts to classify and organise subjects encyclopedically like Cesare Ripa and Anne Claude Philippe de Caylus&#x27;s &quot;Recueil d&#x27;antiquités égyptiennes, étrusques, grècques, romaines et gauloises&quot; as guides to understanding works of art, both religious and profane, in a more scientific manner than the popular aesthetic approach of the time. These early contributions paved the way for encyclopedias, manuals, and other publications useful in identifying the content of art. Mâle&#x27;s &quot;l&#x27;Art religieux du XIIIe siècle en France&quot; (originally 1899, with revised editions) translated into English as &quot;The Gothic Image, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century&quot; has remained continuously in print.

=== Twentieth century ===
In early twentieth-century Germany, Aby Warburg (1866–1929) and his followers Fritz Saxl (1890–1948) and Erwin Panofsky (1892–1968) elaborated the practice of identification and classification of motifs in images to using iconography as a means to understanding meaning. Panofsky codified an influential approach to iconography in his 1939 &quot;Studies in Iconology&quot;, where he defined it as &quot;the branch of the history of art which concerns itself with the subject matter or meaning of works of art, as opposed to form,&quot; although the distinction he and other scholars drew between particular definitions of &quot;iconography&quot; (put simply, the identification of visual content) and &quot;iconology&quot; (the analysis of the meaning of that content), has not been generally accepted, though it is still used by some writers.

In the United States, to which Panofsky immigrated in 1931, students such as Frederick Hartt, and Meyer Schapiro continued under his influence in the discipline. In an influential article of 1942, &quot;Introduction to an &quot;Iconography of Mediaeval Architecture&quot;&quot;, Richard Krautheimer, a specialist on early medieval churches and another German émigré, extended iconographical analysis to architectural forms.

The period from 1940 can be seen as one where iconography was especially prominent in art history. Whereas most iconographical scholarship remains highly dense and specialized, some analyses began to attract a much wider audience, for example Panofsky&#x27;s theory (now generally out of favour with specialists of that picture) that the writing on the rear wall in the &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot; by Jan van Eyck turned the painting into the record of a marriage contract. Holbein&#x27;s &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; has been the subject of books for a general market with new theories as to its iconography, and the best-sellers of Dan Brown include theories, disowned by most art historians, on the iconography of works by Leonardo da Vinci.

The method of iconology, which had developed following the publications of Erwin Panofsky, has been critically discussed since the mid-1950s, in part also strongly (Otto Pächt, Svetlana Alpers). However, among the critics, no one has found a model of interpretation that could completely replace that of Panofsky. 

As regards the interpretation of Christian art, that Panofsky researched throughout his life, the iconographic interest in texts as possible sources remains important, because the meaning of Christian images and architecture is closely linked to the content of biblical, liturgical and theological texts, which were usually considered authoritative by most patrons, artists and viewers.

Technological advances allowed the building-up of huge collections of photographs, with an iconographic arrangement or index, which include those of the Warburg Institute and the Index of Medieval Art (formerly Index of Christian Art) at Princeton (which has made a specialism of iconography since its early days in America). These are now being digitised and made available online, usually on a restricted basis.
With the arrival of computing, the Iconclass system, a highly complex system for the classification of the content of images, with 40,000+ classification types, and 84,000 (14,000 unique) keywords, was developed in the Netherlands as a standard classification for recording collections, with the idea of assembling huge databases that will allow the retrieval of images featuring particular details, subjects or other common factors. For example, the Iconclass code &quot;71H7131&quot; is for the subject of &quot;Bathsheba (alone) with David&#x27;s letter&quot;, whereas &quot;71&quot; is the whole &quot;Old Testament&quot; and &quot;71H&quot; the &quot;story of David&quot;. A number of collections of different types have been classified using Iconclass, notably many types of old master print, the collections of the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin and the German Marburger Index. These are available, usually on-line or on DVD. The system can also be used outside pure art history, for example on sites like Flickr.

==Brief survey==


Religious images are used to some extent by all major religions, including both Indian and Abrahamic faiths, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition. Secular Western iconography later drew upon these themes.

=== Indian religion ===
Central to the iconography and hagiography of Indian religions are mudra or gestures with specific meanings. Other features include the aureola and halo, also found in Christian and Islamic art, and divine qualities and attributes represented by asana and ritual tools such as the dharmachakra, vajra, chhatra, sauwastika, phurba and danda. The symbolic use of colour to denote the Classical Elements or Mahabhuta and letters and bija syllables from sacred alphabetic scripts are other features. Under the influence of tantra art developed esoteric meanings, accessible only to initiates; this is an especially strong feature of Tibetan art. The art of Indian Religions esp. Hindus in its numerous sectoral divisions is governed by sacred texts called the Aagama which describes the ratio and proportion of the icon, called &quot;taalmaana&quot; as well as mood of the central figure in a context. For example, Narasimha an incarnation of Vishnu though considered a wrathful deity but in few contexts is depicted in pacified mood.

Although iconic depictions of, or concentrating on, a single figure are the dominant type of Buddhist image, large stone relief or fresco narrative cycles of the &quot;Life of the Buddha&quot;, or tales of his previous lives, are found at major sites like Sarnath, Ajanta, and Borobudor, especially in earlier periods. Conversely, in Hindu art, narrative scenes have become rather more common in recent centuries, especially in miniature paintings of the lives of Krishna and Rama.

=== Christian ===
Christian art features Christian iconography, prominently developed in the medieval era and renaissance, and is a prominent aspect of Christian media. Aniconism was rejected within Christian theology from the outset, and the development of early Christian art and architecture occurred within the first seven centuries after Jesus. Small images in the Catacombs of Rome show orans figures, portraits of Christ and some saints, and a limited number of &quot;abbreviated representations&quot; of biblical episodes emphasizing deliverance. From the Constantinian period monumental art borrowed motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art – the motif of Christ in Majesty owes something to both Imperial portraits and depictions of Zeus. In the Late Antique period iconography began to be standardized, and to relate more closely to Biblical texts, although many gaps in the canonical Gospel narratives were plugged with matter from the apocryphal gospels. Eventually, the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the Nativity of Christ.

After the period of Byzantine iconoclasm iconographical innovation was regarded as unhealthy, if not heretical, in the Eastern Church, though it still continued at a glacial pace. More than in the West, traditional depictions were often considered to have authentic or miraculous origins, and the job of the artist was to copy them with as little deviation as possible. The Eastern church also never accepted the use of monumental high relief or free-standing sculpture, which it found too reminiscent of paganism. Most modern Eastern Orthodox icons are very close to their predecessors of a thousand years ago, though development, and some shifts in meaning, have occurred – for example, the old man wearing a fleece in conversation with Saint Joseph usually seen in Orthodox Nativities seems to have begun as one of the shepherds, or the prophet Isaiah, but is now usually understood as the &quot;Tempter&quot; (Satan).

In both East and West, numerous iconic types of Christ, Mary and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas Christ Pantocrator was much the commonest image of Christ. Especially important depictions of Mary include the Hodegetria and Panagia types. Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the Life of the Virgin, parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular saints. Especially in the West, a system of attributes developed for identifying individual figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East, they were more likely to identified by text labels.

From the Romanesque period sculpture on churches became increasingly important in Western art, and probably partly because of the lack of Byzantine models, became the location of much iconographic innovation, along with the illuminated manuscript, which had already taken a decisively different direction from Byzantine equivalents, under the influence of Insular art and other factors. Developments in theology and devotional practice produced innovations like the subject of the Coronation of the Virgin and the Assumption, Both associated with the Franciscans, as were many other developments. Most painters remained content to copy and slightly modify the works of others, and it is clear that the clergy, by whom or for whose churches most art was commissioned, often specified what they wanted shown in great detail.

The theory of typology, by which the meaning of most events of the Old Testament was understood as a &quot;type&quot; or pre-figuring of an event in the life of, or aspect of, Christ or Mary was often reflected in art, and in the later Middle Ages came to dominate the choice of Old Testament scenes in Western Christian art.
Whereas in the Romanesque and Gothic periods the great majority of religious art was intended to convey often complex religious messages as clearly as possible, with the arrival of Early Netherlandish painting iconography became highly sophisticated, and in many cases appears to be deliberately enigmatic, even for a well-educated contemporary. The subtle layers of meaning uncovered by modern iconographical research in works of Robert Campin such as the Mérode Altarpiece, and of Jan van Eyck such as the Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and the Washington Annunciation lie in small details of what are on first viewing very conventional representations. When Italian painting developed a taste for enigma, considerably later, it most often showed in secular compositions influenced by Renaissance Neo-Platonism.

From the 15th century religious painting gradually freed itself from the habit of following earlier compositional models, and by the 16th century ambitious artists were expected to find novel compositions for each subject, and direct borrowings from earlier artists are more often of the poses of individual figures than of whole compositions. The Reformation soon restricted most Protestant religious painting to Biblical scenes conceived along the lines of history painting, and after some decades the Catholic Council of Trent reined in somewhat the freedom of Catholic artists.

=== Secular Western ===
Secular painting became far more common in the West from the Renaissance, and developed its own traditions and conventions of iconography, in history painting, which includes mythologies, portraits, genre scenes, and even landscapes, not to mention modern media and genres like photography, cinema, political cartoons, comic books.

Renaissance mythological painting was in theory reviving the iconography of its Classical Antiquity, but in practice themes like Leda and the Swan developed on largely original lines, and for different purposes. Personal iconographies, where works appear to have significant meanings individual to, and perhaps only accessible by, the artist, go back at least as far as Hieronymous Bosch, but have become increasingly significant with artists like Goya, William Blake, Gauguin, Picasso, Frida Kahlo, and Joseph Beuys.

== In disciplines other than art history ==
Iconography, often of aspects of popular culture, is a concern of other academic disciplines including Semiotics, Anthropology, Sociology, Media Studies, Communication Studies, and Cultural Studies. These analyses in turn have affected conventional art history, especially concepts such as signs in semiotics. Discussing imagery as iconography in this way implies a critical &quot;reading&quot; of imagery that often attempts to explore social and cultural values. Iconography is also used within film studies to describe the visual language of cinema, particularly within the field of genre criticism. In the age of Internet, the new global history of the visual production of Humanity (Histiconologia) includes History of Art and history of all kind of images or medias.

Contemporary iconography research often draws on theories of visual framing to address such diverse issues as the iconography of climate change created by different stakeholders, the iconography that international organizations create about natural disasters, the iconography of epidemics disseminated in the press, and the iconography of suffering found in social media.

An iconography study in communication science analyzed stock photos used in press reporting to depict the social issue of child sexual abuse. Based on a sample of N=1,437 child sexual abuse (CSA) online press articles that included 419 stock photos, a CSA iconography (i.e. a set of typical image motifs for a topic) was revealed that relate to criminal reporting: The CSA iconography visualizes 1. crime contexts, 2. course of the crime and people involved, and 3. consequences of the crime for the people involved (e.g., image motif: perpetrator in handcuffs).

<text>The Boulton Paul Defiant is a British interceptor aircraft that served with the Royal Air Force (RAF) during World War II. The Defiant was designed and built by Boulton Paul Aircraft as a &quot;turret fighter&quot; to meet the RAF requirement for day and night fighters that could concentrate their firepower on enemy bombers which were not expected to have fighter escorts due to the distance from Germany to the United Kingdom. The Defiant had all its armament in a dorsal turret offering the ability to fire in most directions. The same principle was used in the Royal Navy&#x27;s Blackburn Roc which was also built by Boulton Paul.

In combat, the Defiant was found to be effective at destroying unescorted bombers, the role it was designed for, but was vulnerable to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s more manoeuvrable, single-seat Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters operating from bases in Northern France, allowing them to escort bombers to London, although with fuel for only ten minutes of flying time there. The Defiant had been designed only to destroy unescorted bombers by means of beam or ventral attacks, and had no forward-firing armament; it proved to be very vulnerable to frontal attacks by fighters in daylight combat. It was withdrawn from daytime operations for use as a night fighter, and found success in combination with the use of aircraft interception radar (A.I.) to locate the enemy. It eventually equipped thirteen squadrons in this role, compared to just two squadrons as a day-fighter, though this was mainly due to slow initial production. In mid-1942 it was replaced by better-performing night fighters, the Bristol Beaufighter and de Havilland Mosquito. The Defiant continued to find use in gunnery training, target towing, electronic countermeasures and air-sea rescue. Among RAF pilots it had the nickname &quot;Daffy&quot;.

==Development==

===Origins===
During the 1930s, the increasing speed of military aircraft posed a particular challenge to anti-aircraft defences. Advances in aircraft design achieved during the 1920s and 1930s had resulted in a generation of multi-engined monoplane bombers that were substantially faster than their contemporary single-engined biplane fighters then in service. The RAF came to believe that its new generation of turret-armed bombers, such as the Vickers Wellington, would be capable of readily penetrating enemy airspace and of defending themselves without any accompanying fighter escort, but also recognised that the bombers of other European air forces, such as the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, would similarly be able to penetrate British airspace with impunity.
During 1935, the concept of a turret-armed defensive fighter to counter the bomber threat emerged during a time in which the RAF anticipated having to defend Great Britain against massed formations of unescorted enemy bombers. The RAF did not expect bombers to be escorted by fighters because fighters would not have the range to reach the UK from Germany. In theory, turret-armed fighters would approach an enemy bomber from below or from the side and coordinate their fire. The separation of the tasks of flying the aircraft and firing the guns would allow the pilot to concentrate on putting the fighter into the best position for the gunner to engage the enemy. However, manually-traversed turrets were viewed as increasingly inadequate to effectively respond to ever-faster hostile aircraft, thus there was considerable interest in using a power-augmented turret.

The earlier Hawker Demon biplane had tested the concept with 59 of the fighters, which had been manufactured by Boulton Paul under a sub-contract, having been equipped with a hydraulically-powered rear turret, while a number of aircraft already built were also converted as such. Boulton Paul and its managing director John Dudley North had gained considerable experience with defensive turrets from producing several earlier aircraft, including the Boulton Paul Overstrand bomber, and had devised a four-gun power-operated turret, the concept and development work of which would later be a core part of the Defiant design. Boulton Paul had acquired a four-gun powered turret from the French SAMM company in 1935.

In April 1935, the Air Ministry released Specification F.9/35, which required a two-seater day and night &quot;turret fighter&quot; capable of at . The aircraft was to feature a clean design, concentrating its armament within a power-operated turret, and the accepted performance was to be only slightly beneath that of other emergent fighter designs of the period, along with a sufficient fuel capacity to allow it to perform standing patrols. In particular, the powered turret was to offer considerable flexibility, possessing both a 360-degree upper hemisphere field of fire and the ability to engage enemy bombers from a range of quarters, including below the aircraft itself. Specification F.9/35 had followed the earlier Specification F.5/33, which had sought a pusher design combined with a forward-set turret; F.5/33 had been abandoned as the proposals had offered little in terms of performance gains over existing fighters, and the corresponding Armstrong Whitworth AW.34 design which had been ordered was not completed.

F.5/35 was issued to British manufacturers in June 1935. Seven responded to the tender: Armstrong Whitworth (twin-engines, based on the AW.34), Boulton and Paul (P.82), Bristol (Type 147), Fairey, Gloster, Hawker, and Supermarine (Type 305). Vickers did start on a design but did not provide it to the Air Ministry In September 1935 the Air Ministry picked Hawker, Boulton Paul and Armstrong Whitworth designs as the top three (in decreasing order); Gloster and Bristol were rejected due to their turret designs. The Air Ministry wanted several designs investigated and the production of two prototypes of each. To get this large number of aircraft, HM Treasury had to approve the expenditure above that already allocated. Seven prototypes were ordered - one from Armstrong Whitworth, two each from Fairey, Hawker and Boulton Paul - but only the two Defiant prototypes and one Hawker were completed.

===P.82===
Boulton Paul, having been focused on turret-equipped aircraft for some time, made the submission to Specification F.9/35; with the company designation of &quot;P.82&quot;. The proposed fighter was similar in size and appearance to the more conventional Hawker Hurricane, differing in weight primarily due to the use of turret-based armaments. The central feature of the P.82 was its four-gun turret, based on a design by French aviation company (SAMM), which had been licensed by Boulton Paul for use in the earlier Boulton Paul Sidestrand bomber, eventually installed in the &quot;follow-up&quot; design, the Boulton Paul Overstrand and in the Blackburn Roc naval fighter. The &#x27;Type A&#x27; turret was an electro-hydraulically powered &quot;drop-in&quot; unit, with crank-operated mechanical backup. Small bombs could be housed in recesses in the outer wing. Some of the development work from the company&#x27;s earlier B.1/35 tender was carried over into the P.82.

In 1936, Boulton Paul commenced assembly on the first P.82 prototype, &quot;K8310&quot;, at their new Wolverhampton facility; an order for a second prototype, &quot;K8620&quot;, was received by the following year.
In 1937, the first P.82 prototype, &quot;K8310&quot;, was rolled out. Furnished with a 1,030 hp (768 kW) Rolls-Royce Merlin I and initially without turret, the aircraft bore a great resemblance to the contemporary Hawker Hurricane, although it was at least heavier. On 11 August 1937, &quot;K8310&quot;, which had recently received the name &quot;Defiant&quot;, conducted its maiden flight. This initial flight, still without the turret, piloted by Boulton Paul&#x27;s chief test pilot Cecil Feather, took place nearly a year ahead of the rival Hotspur. Official acceptance trials did not commence until nine months later. On 30 July 1939, the second prototype, &quot;K8620&quot;, equipped with a Merlin II engine and a full turret, conducted its first flight. &quot;K8620&quot; had received various modifications over the first prototype, such as telescopic radio masts and revisions to the canopy and to the undercarriage fairing plates; implementing these improvements had incurred delays to the completion of the second prototype.

Production orders had been prepared for the Hotspur, the initial front-running submission but Boulton Paul&#x27;s turret design had gained the attention of the Air Ministry. Hawker&#x27;s progress on the project had been delayed by their commitments on other aircraft programs including the more conventional Hurricane; thus the prototype Hotspur, &quot;K8309&quot;, did not conduct its maiden flight until 14 June 1938. On 28 April 1937, an initial production order for 87 aircraft was received by Boulton Paul for the P.82; as this was prior to the first flight of the prototype, the aircraft had effectively been ordered &#x27;off the drawing board&#x27;. The order for the rival Hotspur was cancelled in 1938.

Completing its acceptance tests with the turret installed, the Defiant attained a top speed of and subsequently was declared the victor of the turret fighter competition. Flight trials had revealed the aircraft to possess positive flight characteristics and considerable stability, which was of particular value when using the turret. According to aviation author Michael Bowyer, the usefulness of the Defiant had suffered due to the overly long development time for the type, observing that the Defiant&#x27;s service entry was delayed to such an extent that only three production aircraft had reached the RAF, and these were only for trial purposes, by the outbreak of the Second World War. Due to delays with the type entering production, there were not enough available Defiants to begin standing patrols in 1940, by which point the introduction of not only more advanced fighters but bombers as well had allegedly undermined the usefulness of the type.

===Production===
On 30 July 1939, the first production Defiant, &quot;L6950&quot;, conducted its maiden flight; it commenced official trials with the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) in September that year. Apart from some detail changes, the production &quot;Defiant Mk I&quot; looked similar to the two Defiant prototypes. It was powered by the Rolls-Royce Merlin III engine, which was capable of generating 1,030 hp/768 kW or 1,160 hp/865 kW.

By January 1940, over half of the original production batch had been completed. Beyond the initial production order in April 1937, follow-on orders had been issued for the type; in February 1938, an additional 202 Defiant Mk I aircraft were ordered; three months later, another 161 aircraft were ordered. At the same time Boulton Paul were engaged in production of the Blackburn Roc. In December 1939, yet another 150 aircraft were ordered, raising the overall total to 513. In 1940, this rose to 563 Defiant Mk Is on order, while a further 280 were ordered under a rearranged manufacturing plan issued in mid-1940. However, the performance of the Defiant had been determined to be inadequate by this point, which led to manufacturing being sustained principally for economic reasons. A total of 713 Defiant Mk I aircraft were completed.

In response to a service request which sought greater performance, the &quot;Defiant Mk II&quot;, powered by the 1,260 hp Merlin XX engine, was promptly developed. On 20 July 1940, &quot;N1550&quot;, the first production Defiant Mk II performed its initial flight. The Mk II featured a pressurised fuel system, additional fuel, an enlarged rudder, a deeper radiator, a modified engine mounting and elongated cowling. Once sufficient numbers of the Merlin XX engine were available, production of the improved variant commenced; in August 1941, the first production deliveries of the Defiant Mk II took place.

The Defiant Mk II was soon paired with the newly developed AI to become more effective night fighter. While initial AI equipment was too heavy and bulky to be practical for equipping smaller aircraft, the improved AI Mk. IV radar was suitably sized for the Defiant; the first such equipped Defiants were introduced in late 1941. Later versions of the AI radar were adopted over time, such as the AI Mk VI. The need for both the Defiant (and the Hurricane) in the night fighter role petered out by 1942 as the larger Bristol Beaufighter became the RAF&#x27;s primary night fighter type, freeing both aircraft for other duties.

In the search for alternative uses for the Defiant, which included limited service with the RAF Search and Rescue Force and suitability trials for cooperative operations with the British Army, it was determined that Defiant production would continue in order to satisfy a pressing requirement for high speed gunnery targets. A dedicated version of the aircraft, the &quot;Defiant TT Mk I&quot;, was developed for this purpose; modifications included the removal of the turret, the installation of target-towing equipment, including a target stowage box and a wind-driven winch, and the addition of a winch operator under an enclosed canopy. In January 1942, the prototype Defiant TT Mk I, &quot;DR863&quot;, conducted its maiden flight; fighter production was phased out shortly thereafter.

The last Defiant Mk IIs under construction were completed as TT Mk I aircraft. Dozens of existing Defiant Mk Is would be remanufactured to the similar &quot;Defiant TT Mk III&quot; standard; roughly 150 of such conversions took place during 1943–1944. So that the type could be used to meet the growing overseas demand for target-towing aircraft, the Defiant was tropicalized, a large portion of which was the installation of large filters underneath the aircraft&#x27;s nose.

===P.85===
The P.85 was Boulton Paul&#x27;s tender to Specification O.30/35 for the naval turret fighter. A version of the Defiant for Fleet Air Arm (FAA), it had leading edge slats and a deeper fuselage, for the lower landing speeds required of carrier aircraft. The engine would be either a Bristol Hercules radial or the Merlin. Despite the P.85&#x27;s higher estimated top speed, the Blackburn Roc was selected. With Blackburn already busy producing other projects, the detail design and production of the Roc was given to Boulton Paul. Ultimately, the only use of the Defiant within the FAA was its adoption of the target tug version.

===P.94===
The first Defiant prototype had not been fitted with a turret at first and had an impressive top speed. In 1940, Boulton Paul removed the turret from the prototype as a demonstrator for a fixed-gun fighter based on Defiant components. The armament offered was either 12 Browning machine guns (six per wing) or four Hispano cannon in place of eight of the Brownings. The guns could be depressed for ground attack. By that time, the RAF had sufficient quantities of Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires and did not require a new single-seat fighter. With a calculated top speed of about at the P.94 was almost as fast as a contemporary Spitfire although less manoeuvrable.

==Design==
The Defiant was a single-engine interceptor aircraft. It used a monoplane structure which was coupled with main landing gear which retracted into a broad mainplane section. The pilot&#x27;s cockpit and rear turret were faired into a streamlined upper fuselage section. Tankage for up to of fuel was housed within the wing centre section along with a large ventral radiator that completed the resemblance to the Hawker fighter. The centre section employed a two-spar arrangement, and the wing itself had removable wingtips. The rear fuselage comprised two metal cones connected by a two-foot transitional section and a flat upper deck. The Defiant employed an all-metal stressed skin monocoque structure. The fuselage was built in sections that were subsequently bolted together, a manufacturing method previously used on other Boulton Paul-designed aircraft which they thought made the riveting process easier. It was a relatively clean design and made use of a simple, weight-saving structure.

===Armament===

The primary mission of the Defiant was the destruction of incoming enemy bombers. The armament of the aircraft is a powered dorsal turret equipped with four 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns (firing bullets, rather then the more destructive cannon firing explosive shells). Some versions (P.82) could carry a few small bombs. The fuselage was fitted with aerodynamic fairings that helped mitigate the drag of the turret; they were pneumatically powered and automatically raised and lowered into the fuselage so that the turret could rotate freely. The Brownings were electrically fired, and insulated cut-off points in the turret ring prevented the guns firing when they were pointing at the propeller disc or tailplane. The gunner could rotate the turret directly forward and transfer firing control of the guns to the pilot, with the guns firing along each side of the cockpit canopy; this was rarely done as the turret&#x27;s minimum forward elevation was 19° and the pilot did not have a gunsight, possibly because the Defiant was outfitted to perform zero deflection shooting, as were several contemporaneous designs arising from Air Ministry specifications.
Limitations of the armament were inability of the guns to fire directly forwards in normal operation (the guns could not fire within 16 degrees of the line of flight), and the guns&#x27; inability to fire downwards, so the aircraft had to remain below the enemy. This was suitable for attacking bombers from below, but not for dogfighting with fighters. As flying and the guns were operated by different people, there was a need to communicate; the gunner was distracted from his firing by having to direct the pilot over the intercom.

The zero deflection gunnery technique was practised, among others, by British ace Albert Ball using Lewis guns on Foster mounts – which largely eliminated the need for either complex gun sights or aiming-off by eye. An elevation of +19° combined with ballistic properties of .303 (7.7mm) Brownings and the Defiant&#x27;s operational speed made &#x27;line of sight&#x27; aiming – as practised by Luftwaffe pilots – a practical proposition. This technique, applied later in the war by Germany as &quot;Schräge Musik&quot;, seems to have been neither taught nor practised by the RAF. Despite being common knowledge among veteran First World War aircrew, featuring in Air Ministry requirements reflected in fighter designs such as the contemporaneous Gloster F.9/37 (Gloster G9) twin-engine bomber-interceptor – armed with five 20mm cannon at +12° – virtually all losses of Bomber Command aircraft shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters using upward-firing were ascribed to flak until 1944.

The gunner operated the turret through a control column with the firing button on the top. The motor could be put in high speed mode for swift changes of direction and the there was a handle for manual rotation of the turret.

The gunner&#x27;s hatch was in the rear of the turret, which had to be rotated to the side for entry and exit. There was not enough room in the turret for the gunner to wear a seat-type or back pack parachute; the parachute was stowed alongside the gunner instead. This made escape from the aircraft so difficult that gunners were later provided with a special all-in-one garment, a &#x27;parasuit&#x27;, nicknamed the &quot;rhino suit&quot;. Frederick &quot;Gus&quot; Platts, an air gunner who served in 230, 282 and 208 squadrons, stated: &quot;The Rhino suit we had to wear on Defiants was a bear but I couldn&#x27;t come up with an alternative, even though it killed dozens of us. I forget the details of it but we could not have sat on our chute or even keep it nearby as in other turrets, so you wore – all in one – an inner layer that fitted a little like a wetsuit of today. The chute fitted around this, and then the dinghy and the outer clothing. There was inner webbing and pockets that literally fell apart (I presume) when one bailed out&quot;.

==Operational history==

===Air combat===
In October 1939, No. 264 (Madras Presidency) Squadron was reformed at RAF Sutton Bridge to operate the Defiant. Initial training, formal squadron acceptance, and development of tactics began with other aircraft as it received its first Defiants only in early December at Martlesham Heath. In February 1940, the Defiant commenced night fighter training operations; the squadron tested its tactics against British medium bombers – Hampdens and Blenheims – and 264&#x27;s CO flew against Robert Stanford Tuck in a Spitfire, showing that the Defiant could defend itself by circling and keeping its speed up. It became clear during these trials that the Defiant was suited only to performing the unescorted bomber-destroyer duties it was designed for, and was vulnerable to fighters.

By March 1940, 264 Squadron had two flights operational with Defiants and No. 141 Squadron received its first Defiant. When the Defiant was first introduced to the public, the RAF put out a disinformation campaign, stating that the Defiant had 21 guns: four in the turret, 14 in the wings and three cannon in the nose. On 12 May 1940, the first operational sortie occurred as a flight of six Defiants flew with six Spitfires of 66 Squadron over the English Channel to the coastline in the vicinity of The Hague, Netherlands; during this flight, a single Ju 88 which had been attacking a destroyer was shot down. The following day, in a patrol that was a repetition of the first, Defiants claimed four Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers, but were subsequently attacked by a flight of Bf 109Es. The escorting Spitfires were unable to prevent five of the six Defiants from being shot down by a frontal attack.

During the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk, the squadron was based at RAF Manston, as one of the 16 squadrons that No. 11 Group had for the evacuation. On 27 May 264 Squadron claimed three He 111 and two damaged. On 28 May, shortly after take-off, 10 Defiants were attacked by about 30 Bf 109s – forming a circle, they claimed six German fighters for the loss of three Defiants. The Defiant was initially successful against enemy aircraft and its best day was 29 May, when No. 264 Squadron claimed 37 kills in two sorties: 19 Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot;s, mostly picked off as they came out of their dives, nine Messerschmitt Bf 110 twin-engined heavy fighters, eight Bf 109s, and a Ju 88. One Defiant gunner was lost after he bailed out, but the pilot managed to fly the aircraft back to its base and it was subsequently repaired. On 31 May, seven Defiants were lost in one day as Hurricanes and Spitfires failed to come to their aid in a battle with Bf 109s. It was concluded that underslung radio aerials on the Defiants had affected radio communication between the fighter squadrons.
&quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighters suffered losses when &quot;bouncing&quot; flights of Defiants from the rear, apparently mistaking them for Hurricanes. The German pilots were unaware of the Defiant&#x27;s rear-firing armament and encountered concentrated defensive fire. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; changed tactics, to outmanoeuvre the Defiant and attack from below or dead ahead, where the turret guns could not bear and offered no defence. Defiant losses quickly mounted, particularly among the gunners, who were often unable to leave stricken aircraft. The additional weight and aerodynamic drag of the turret, and the weight of the gunner, gave the Defiant a lower performance than single-seat fighter aircraft.

264 Squadron developed a counter against single-seat aircraft such as the Bf 109. By flying in an ever-descending Lufbery circle, Defiant crews sacrificed the advantage of height but eliminated the possibility of attack from underneath, while giving 360° of defensive fire. This tactic was used by 264 Squadron, but when the Defiants of 141 Sqn were committed to combat a few months later during the Battle of Britain, it chose to ignore their advice. On 19 July, seven out of nine 141 Squadron Defiants sent to cover a convoy off Folkestone were shot down by Bf 109s of JG 51, and the remaining two survived, one badly damaged, thanks only to the intervention of Hurricanes of 111 Sqn. The Hurricane pilots reported that the Defiants had shot down four Bf 109s. Although 264 Squadron claimed 48 kills in eight days over Dunkirk, the cost was high, with 14 Defiants lost. Actual German losses were no more than 12–15 enemy aircraft; the turret&#x27;s wide angle of fire meant that several Defiants could engage the same target, leading to multiple claims.

On 22 August, in response to an urgent demand for aircraft to defend Britain&#x27;s airspace, 264 Squadron relocated to RAF Hornchurch, Essex, while also using RAF Manston as a forward base. On 24 August, nine Defiants of 264 scrambled from Manston to engage an incoming German force; in the ensuing engagement, three Ju 88s and one Bf 109E were shot down for the loss of two Defiants. Later that day, another cluster of bombers appeared and were engaged by seven Defiants that had been refuelling; three Ju 88s and two Bf 109Es were shot down, one Defiant was shot down, and one damaged.

On 26 August 264 Squadron engaged a formation of twelve Dornier Do 17 bombers over north-eastern Kent, but was attacked by a large formation of Bf 109s. Three aircraft were lost, two to ace Hpt. Gunther Lutzow of JG 3, but six Do 17s and a Bf 109 were shot down. Three of those victories were awarded to one Defiant, crewed by Flight Sergeants E. R. Thorn (pilot) and F. J. Barker (air gunner). They shot down two Do 17s but were then engaged by a Bf 109, which set their Defiant on fire; they managed to shoot down the German fighter before making a forced landing; they were awarded a bar to the Distinguished Flying Medal.

The squadron lost a further five aircraft (to JG 26) on 28 August, with nine crew killed, and effectively ended operations, withdrawing to RAF Duxford the following day. With these losses, the Defiant—which had been intended from the start as a day- and night-fighter—was transferred to night operations only. The type had proven unsuited for fighter-to-fighter day combat, and was less capable than other RAF fighter aircraft such as the Hurricane and the Spitfire. By 31 August, over half the delivered Defiants had been shot down by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft, a rate that was deemed unacceptable.

The Defiant&#x27;s kill ratio was better than is commonly thought. In 20 days of frontline service in the Battle of Britain in July and August, 141 and 264 Squadron shot down 25 German aircraft for the loss of 17 Defiants. It was concluded that when operating against escorted bombers the Defiant should always be sent into battle with a top cover of Hurricanes or Spitfires so it could concentrate on its designed role of shooting down the bombers, but this proved impractical, particularly as the Defiant&#x27;s radio reception was relatively poor due to its underslung antenna. The decision was made to switch the type to night operations, and there the Defiant saw some success. 
On 1 July, 141 Squadron despatched &quot;L6997&quot; on the first Defiant night patrol. In August, the squadron was operating both by day and night; on 15 August, the first possible nighttime success by a Defiant was recorded, and from September onwards, the squadron principally operated at night. In September, as a response to the commencement of heavy attacks upon London by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;—The &quot;Blitz&quot;—B Flight of No. 141 moved to RAF Biggin Hill, Bromley, while A Flight relocated to RAF Gatwick, West Sussex in October, then to RAF Gravesend, Kent. Successful claimed interceptions took place, such as two He 111s being claimed on 15/16 September; the first confirmed kill, of a single He 111, by a Defiant of the squadron was made on 22 December.

The Defiant night fighters had initially lacked aircraft interception radar; enemy aircraft were spotted by crew observation aided by ground-based searchlights illuminating attacking bombers. In the opening months of 1941, as the German night bombing campaign reached its peak, increasing numbers of Defiant night fighter-equipped squadrons became operational and commenced night patrols although, according to Bowyer, there were relatively few claims from many Defiant sorties. However, aviation author John Taylor noted that during the &quot;Blitz&quot; on London of 1940–41, the four Defiant-equipped squadrons were responsible for shooting down more enemy aircraft than any other type in the theatre.

The improved Defiant Mk II model was fitted with the AI Mk. IV radar and a Merlin XX engine, increasing the aircraft&#x27;s performance, particularly at nighttime. In September 1941, 264 Squadron became the first to receive the Defiant Mk II, bringing them into operational use by mid-September. The principal users of the Mk II night fighter were 96, 151, and 262 Squadrons. As the radar-equipped Defiants began filtering through to operational squadrons, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;&#x27;s bombing campaign petered out as German forces had become heavily engaged in the Operation Barbarossa invasion of the Soviet Union.

Defiant night fighters typically attacked enemy bombers from below, in a similar manoeuvre to the later German &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; method. Defiants attacked more often from slightly ahead or to one side, rather than from directly under the tail. The turret-fighter concept was not immediately discarded. Four-gun turrets were fitted to Beaufighter (Mk II, in 1941) and Mosquito (Bristol design turret, September 1941) night fighters to test the advantages of flexible firing in night fighting, but the effect on top speed, reduced from 303 mph to 272 mph at altitude for the Beaufighter, was not acceptable, and those conversions were abandoned. Further developments using more powerful engines were considered, but the idea of a Defiant replacement was finally dropped in 1942.

===Other roles===

After trials in 1940 with the School of Army Co-operation to assess its capabilities in that role, the Defiant was tested as a high-speed gunnery trainer with the Air Ministry agreeing to continue production. The Defiant was removed from combat duties in 1942 and used for training, target towing, electronic countermeasures and air-sea rescue.

Two types of electronic countermeasures equipment were carried by the Defiant, both countering the German &quot;Freya&quot; early warning radar. The first system to be deployed was &quot;Moonshine&quot;, which re-transmitted the radar&#x27;s signals to simulate large formations of aircraft. As each &quot;Moonshine&quot; transmitter only covered part of the Freya&#x27;s frequency, a formation of eight Defiants was needed, giving the appearance of over 100 aircraft. As the system required formation flying, it could only be used in daylight, where it could draw German fighters onto British fighters leaving another area relatively free for a British bombing raid.

A &quot;Special Duties Flight&quot; was set up in May 1942 to use the new countermeasures equipment, with &quot;Moonshine&quot; being used for its first live test on 6 August 1942. Subsequently, it was used operationally as part of &quot;Circuses&quot; against coastal targets and on 19 August in support of the Dieppe Raid. The Flight became No. 515 Squadron RAF on 1 October 1942, operations with &quot;Moonshine&quot; continuing until November 1942.

515 Squadron continued operations with the second countermeasures system, &quot;Mandrel&quot;, a noise jammer which overwhelmed the signals from &quot;Freya&quot;. Individual Defiants were sent to orbit positions 50 miles (80 km) off the enemy coast. By using nine aircraft a 200-mile (320-km) gap could be made in the Germans&#x27; radar coverage. 515 Squadron flew its first mission using Mandrel on the night of 5/6 December 1942, continuing to use its Defiants for jamming operations until early 1943, when it began to receive twin-engined Bristol Beaufighters which had longer range and could carry more electronic equipment. The Defiant flew its last jamming mission on 17 July 1943, with one aircraft being lost out of four sent out that night.
In the air-sea rescue role, the Defiant was the intended replacement for the Westland Lysander in shallow air-sea rescue units. In order for this task to be performed, Defiants in this capacity were equipped with a pair of underwing pods that each contained two &quot;M&quot;-type dinghies. In March 1942, No. 281 Squadron formed at RAF Ouston, Northumberland, partially operating Defiant Mk Is; four more squadrons received the type within the next two months. However, six months following their introduction to the role, the Defiant had proved to be a poor choice for the role, in part due to the aircraft already been worn out by their previous service, which limited the sortie rate; other issues included its high stalling speed and wide turning radius. By the end of 1942, the Defiant had been phased out of air-sea rescue.

A high-speed target tug variant, the considerably modified turretless Defiant Mk III, was developed in response to a growing demand. Many of the surviving Mk I and Mk II Defiants had their turrets removed when they were converted for the same role. In this final target-towing variant, the Defiant ended up with a number of overseas assignments with both the RAF and Fleet Air Arm in the Middle East, Africa and India. There were further deployments to Canada, where the Defiant was used as a target tug and trainer with the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.

Defiants were also used for &quot;special&quot; work including tactical evaluations with the RAF Gunnery Research Unit and the Air Fighting Development Unit (AFDU) at Farnborough. Two Defiants were issued for ejection seat development work: one to R Malcolm Ltd (later ML Aviation), and the other to Martin-Baker. On 11 December 1944, Defiant &quot;DR944&quot; was delivered to Martin-Baker&#x27;s facility at Denham and fitted with an early ejector seat under trial in the observer&#x27;s position. On 11 May 1945, Martin-Baker used &quot;DR944&quot; to test their first ejection seat with dummy launches. Various trials using &quot;DR944&quot; were made until May 1948. The other Defiant, &quot;AA292&quot;, was delivered to R Malcolm Ltd at White Waltham Airfield on 15 April 1945, and the first airborne trial with dummies was held that October.

The last operational use of Defiants was in India, where they were used as target tugs.

==Surviving aircraft==
The only surviving complete example of the type is a Defiant I, &quot;N1671&quot;, on display as a night fighter at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford in Shropshire. It was one of four Defiants delivered to No. 307 Polish Night Fighter Squadron at RAF Kirton in Lindsey, Lincolnshire on 17 September 1940 and was passed to No. 153 Squadron at the end of October 1941 and 285 Sqn in 1942. In 1954, it was identified for storage as a historical aircraft and passed to the RAF Museum at Hendon, London in 1971.

The aircraft was moved on 20 May 2009 to Rochester Airport, where it was restored by the Medway Aircraft Preservation Society (MAPS). It was returned to Hendon on 6 December 2012, and was then moved from Hendon to Royal Air Force Museum Cosford in November 2016 for display in the War in the Air hangar.

Major parts of at least two other Defiants survive; &quot;N1766&quot; and &quot;N3378&quot;, both Mk Is. A full-scale replica Defiant was created on site at Boulton Paul in Wolverhampton by ex-Boulton Paul engineer Jack Holmes and team at the Boulton Paul Heritage Society. More than 50,000 man hours went into its production and it was unveiled in 2003 marking 60 years since the last Defiant flew out of Pendeford (the World War II training airfield next to the Boulton Paul Factory in Wolverhampton). Due to change of ownership at the Boulton Paul site, the Defiant faced losing its home in Wolverhampton, and in 2015 was relocated to its now permanent home on display at the Kent Battle of Britain Museum in the colours of 264 Squadron (&quot;L7005&quot;).

<text>codice_1 is a program that displays a pseudorandom message from a database of quotations.
Early versions of the program appeared in Version 7 Unix in 1979.
The most common version on modern systems is the BSD codice_1, originally written by Ken Arnold. Distributions of fortune are usually bundled with a collection of themed files, containing sayings like those found on fortune cookies (hence the name), quotations from famous people, jokes, or poetry.

codice_1 is predominantly found on Unix-like systems, but clients for other platforms also exist. Often, users on text-mode Unix terminals will place this command into either their codice_4 or codice_5 files to display them at logon and logout, respectively. It is also used to generate text input for certain XScreenSaver modes.

==Content==
Most Unix systems use fortunes which are slanted heavily toward the user base of Unix, and thus contain many obscure jokes about computer science and computer programming. Other favoured sources include quotations from science fiction (&quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Cyberiad&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, etc.), Zippy the Pinhead, and the writings of Ambrose Bierce and Dave Barry. Most fortune collections also include a wide variety of more conventionally sourced quotations, jokes, and other short passages. A few distributions include &quot;offensive&quot; dicta, which require the codice_6 or codice_7 options to be passed for viewing. These fortunes often include rude humor and profanity, personal attacks, and controversial comments about religion. Sometimes they are provided by another package, however as of FreeBSD 10.0 the offensive dicta have been removed completely.
As of November 2017, the quotations (with the exception of tips relevant to system operation) have been removed from FreeBSD entirely after user complaints regarding quotations from Adolf Hitler being contained in some of the files.
The exact fortunes vary between each type of Unix, however there seems to be a strong overlap between the FreeBSD and OpenBSD fortune files. The Plan 9 fortune files seem to be much shorter, with many just on 1 line, and the &#x27;offensive&#x27; dicta is much stronger. Most Linux distributions, such as Debian (and its derivatives), choose the FreeBSD fortunes to put in their fortune packages, that can be installed through the package manager.

==Purpose==
One of the included fortunes, from the &quot;goedel&quot; collection of fortunes about codice_1 itself, sums up the purpose of the program:

The original codice_1 program could be used for the more general task of picking up a random line from a plain-text file. However, in most modern Unix systems codice_1 cannot be used this way, since they use an ad hoc file format for fortune files to allow multiline aphorisms.

==Fortune files==
Conventional versions of codice_1 use two files for each quotation list: a text file with quotations, each separated by the character &quot;%&quot; on its own line, and a random-access data file generated by the codice_12(1) program. Alternative implementations, including those made for display on Web pages, typically use only the text file.

==Common options==
Several common options exist that change the way command-line versions of fortune behave:

<doc id="523511" wikidata="Q333600" url="?curid=523511" title="Dafydd Wigley">
<text>Dafydd Wynne Wigley, Baron Wigley, (born David Wigley; 1 April 1943) is a Welsh politician who served as the leader of Plaid Cymru from 1981 to 1984 and again from 1991 to 2000. He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Caernarfon from 1974 to 2001 and as the Member of the Welsh Assembly for Caernarfon from 1999 to 2003. In 2010, Wigley was granted life peerage, taking his seat in the House of Lords in 2011.

==Early life==

Wigley was born in Derby, England, the only child of Welsh parents Elfyn Edward Wigley and Myfanwy Batterbee. He attended Caernarfon grammar school and Rydal School before going on to the Victoria University of Manchester. 

Before becoming a Plaid Cymru MP for Caernarfon, Wigley worked for Ford Motor Company, Mars and Hoover.

==Political career==
In May 1972 Wigley became a councillor on the pre-1974 Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council, winning in the Park, Merthyr Tydfil ward, with the sitting Labour councillor in third place.

===UK Parliament===
Wigley was elected as a Plaid Cymru councillor for Merthyr Tydfil in 1972 and was then the MP for Caernarfon from 1974 until 2001, first elected at the February 1974 general election.

The election for president was seen as instrumental in deciding the future direction of Plaid Cymru. Wigley represented a moderate, pragmatic social democracy, in sharp contrast with rival candidate Dafydd Elis-Thomas&#x27;s socialism. In 1981 Wigley won the presidency, but Elis Thomas had greater influence over the party&#x27;s ideology throughout the 1980s. In 1984 Wigley resigned from the presidency because of his children&#x27;s health, but he returned in 1991 for a second term after the resignation of Elis Thomas. Wigley led Plaid until 2000. He stood down as a Member of Parliament at the 2001 General Election to concentrate on his role in the Assembly. Having served 27 years as an MP, Wigley is the longest-ever serving post-war MP from a nationalist party.

===National Assembly for Wales===
Wigley was the Assembly member for Caernarfon from 1999 to 2003.

===House of Lords===

He secured a Plaid Cymru nomination for a peerage alongside Eurfyl ap Gwilym and Janet Davies. He initially withdrew his candidature after complaining about how long the process was taking.

On 19 November 2010 it was announced that he had been granted a life peerage by the Queen, and he took his seat in the House of Lords as Baron Wigley, &quot;of Caernarfon in the County of Gwynedd&quot; on 24 January 2011, supported by fellow Plaid peer Lord Elis-Thomas and by Lord Faulkner of Worcester. He made his maiden speech on 27 January during a debate on tourism. Having been one of the first MPs to take the House of Commons oath of allegiance in the Welsh language in 1974, he took the oath of allegiance in Welsh on entering the Lords.

In 2024, Wigley criticised the Senedd Reform Bill due to the introduction of a closed list PR system for elections to the Senedd.
==Personal life==

He married the Welsh harpist Elinor Bennett. The couple had four children, son Hywel Wigley and daughter Eluned Wigley as well as two sons, Alun and Geraint, who died of a genetic illness. His sons&#x27; condition influenced the direction of his career, and he took a strong interest in the affairs of disabled people, being vice-chairman of the Parliamentary all-party disablement group, vice-president of Disability Wales, vice-president of Mencap (Wales), former president of the Spastics&#x27; Society of Wales and sponsor of the Disabled Persons Act in 1981. In 2003 Wigley became Pro-Chancellor of the University of Wales.

==Awards==
In 2008, Wigley was awarded an Honorary Chair in Business at Bangor University.

<doc id="523512" wikidata="Q333820" url="?curid=523512" title="Henry McLeish">
<text>Henry Baird McLeish (born 15 June 1948) is a Scottish politician, author, academic and former professional footballer who served as First Minister of Scotland from 2000 to 2001. With a term of 1 year, 12 days, he is the shortest serving holder of that office. He served as the Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland from 2000 to 2001.

Born and raised into a Labour supporting coal mining family in Fife, McLeish dropped out of Buckhaven High School at the age of fifteen to pursue a professional career in football. Playing wing half, he was first signed for Leeds United F.C., but after experiencing homesickness, McLeish returned to his native of Fife to play for East Fife F.C. Making more than 108 appearances, he was one of the youngest ever players to play in Scottish professional football. McLeish&#x27;s career was cut short after an injury and he returned to education, studying at Heriot-Watt University.

McLeish joined the Labour Party in 1970 and was later elected to the Fife Regional Council, where he served as the council&#x27;s leader from 1982 to 1987. After several unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the British House of Commons, McLeish was successful in the 1987 general election, when he was elected as member of parliament for Central Fife. He served successively in Labour&#x27;s opposition benches for ten years, before being appointed minister of state for Scotland under Prime Minister Tony Blair following the party&#x27;s landslide victory in the 1997 election. McLeish served as Donald Dewar&#x27;s &#x27;right-hand man&#x27; in the Scottish Office and was instrumental in assisting Dewar with the creation of the Scotland Act which established the Scottish Parliament. In the first election to the parliament in 1999, he was elected as a member of the Scottish Parliament for the Central Fife constituency. Following the appointment as Dewar as the inaugural first minister of Scotland, he served in the first Scottish Executive as the minister for enterprise and lifelong learning from 1999 to 2000.

Dewar died in office of a brain haemorrhage on 11 October 2000, which triggered a leadership contest within the Labour Party to find a successor, with McLeish declaring his candidacy. He led a successful and short campaign after defeating finance minister Jack McConnell. McLeish was sworn into office as first minister of Scotland on 26 October 2000. He oversaw the implementation of the McCrone Agreement for teachers in Scotland and strongly advocated free personal care for the elderly scheme. His tenure as first minister was short, as he resigned the following year following a financial scandal referred to as &quot;Officegate&quot;; the first major scandal the Scottish Parliament had faced since its reincarnation two years earlier. He was succeeded by McConnell, who he had beaten in the previous leadership election. McLeish sat as a backbencher, before stepping down as an MSP at the 2003 election.

Since leaving office, McLeish has remained politically active and has written several books. In 2007, he was appointed to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission and the following year he chaired the Scottish Prisons Commission. In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, he campaigned in favour of remaining in the UK. However, following the Brexit referendum, McLeish stated he would back another Scottish independence referendum if Scotland was taken out of the EU against its wishes.

== Early life and education ==

Henry Baird McLeish was born at 50 Morar Street in Methil, Fife, on 15 June 1948, to Harry McLeish (1923-2009) and Mary Slaven Baird (1925-1985). Born into a &quot;strong Christian socialist influence&quot; household in central Fife, where his father and grandfather worked as coal miners for a private company, McLeish&#x27;s grandmother was a member of the Labour and Co-operative Party for seventy years. He was named after his maternal grandfather. McLeish grew up on Morar Street, before moving to Institution Row, a miner community, when he was two or three. The family moved to a new housing estate for mineworkers in the old village of Kennoway, where his younger brother Ronald was born.

McLeish was educated at the Buckhaven High School, where he became involved with the school&#x27;s football team. He met his childhood sweetheart while attending the school, Margaret Drysdale, and they married in 1968. While a pupil at the school, he was &quot;too concerned with football&quot;, having been told by his headmaster he had no future in education.

McLeish returned to education following his injury, studying at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh from 1968 to 1973. He graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Town Planning. After graduating, McLeish worked as a research officer at Edinburgh Corporation&#x27;s department of social work from 1973 to 1974, then as a planning officer for Fife County Council from 1974 to 1975 and Dunfermline District Council from 1975 to 1987. He also worked as a part-time lecturer and tutor at Heriot-Watt University from 1973 to 1986.

== Professional football career ==
In 1963, McLeish left school at the age of 15 to become a professional football player. His rector wrote on his school report card: &quot;I am glad the boy is a good footballer as he has no future in education.&quot; He was first signed with Leeds United, however, after experiencing homesickness, he returned to Scotland to play for East Fife, where he made 108 appearances. He played wing-half and was one of the youngest ever players to play in Scottish professional football. His first game for East Fife was at Hampden Park against the Glasgow team, Queen&#x27;s Park.

At the age of 18, McLeish trialled for a Scotland youth national team, playing against a group of footballers from Motherwell, but they lost 5–2. &quot;The Daily Record&quot; reported on the match and stated McLeish was the only young Scot to impress. He was later selected for the Scotland team to play in the World Youth Cup, hosted by Yugoslavia. McLeish also played for junior football clubs; St Andrews United and Glenrothes Juniors. His footballing career was cut short by a leg injury, and he returned to education.

== Local government and MP (1970–1987) ==
McLeish joined the Scottish Labour Party in 1970 and he became chairman of the Young Socialists. He first contested in an election for the Glenwood ward in Glenrothes but he was beaten by the sitting Scottish Conservative councillor. He began his political career on the Kirkcaldy District Council from 1974 to 1977, serving as the council&#x27;s planning committee chairman. He later served on the Fife Regional Council 1978 to 1987 and served as the as leader of Fife Regional Council from 1982. As the council leader, he implemented a &quot;municipal socialist&quot; manifesto, proposing free bus passes and TV licences for pensioners.

At the 1979 UK general election, he ran for the East Fife constituency for the British House of Commons. McLeish was unsuccessful, having been placed third, behind the Conservatives&#x27; Barry Henderson and the Liberals&#x27; Menzies Campbell. In 1981, he began to challenge Willie Hamilton in the Central Fife constituency. Hamilton was a right-wing Labour MP known nationally for his anti-monarchy views. He gave up his attempts to retain his candidacy, allowing McLeish to run in the 1987 election.

== Labour in opposition (1987–1997) ==
The Labour Party failed to defeat Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative Party in the 1987 election and McLeish served in several shadow spokesman portfolios, including education and employment from 1988 to 1989 and employment and training from 1989 to 1992. Despite the end of Thatcher&#x27;s eleven-year tenure, Labour failed again to defeat the incumbent Conservatives, returning to opposition. McLeish served as shadow minister for the Scottish Office from 1992 to 1994.

In 1994, following Tony Blair&#x27;s election as Leader of the Labour Party, McLeish served successively as the shadow minister for transport from 1994 to 1995, shadow minister for health from 1995 to 1996, and shadow minister for social security from 1996 to 1997.

== 1997 Scottish devolution referendum ==
At the 1997 UK general election, McLeish served as Labour&#x27;s election campaign director for Scotland. In the election, Labour defeated the Conservatives in a landslide victory. He was appointed by Blair as the Minister of State for Scotland, with responsibility for home affairs and devolution. McLeish worked alongside Donald Dewar on the Scotland Act 1998, which established the Scottish Parliament.

As Dewar&#x27;s right-hand man in Westminster, McLeish helped secure devolution for Scotland and manoeuvre the Scotland Act through the Westminster Parliament.

== Dewar administration (1999–2000) ==


After the creation of the Scottish Parliament in May 1999, McLeish was elected as MSP for the Fife Central constituency. In the first Scottish administration for over 300 years, first minister Donald Dewar appointed McLeish as the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning. His responsibilities included a commitment to review tuition fees in Scotland which was a key component of the agreement between the Scottish Labour Party and Scottish Liberal Democrats to form the first Scottish Executive. Dewar had been widely expected to be appointed deputy first minister by Dewar, however, Jim Wallace was ultimately appointed as deputy first minister.

During his tenure as Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, McLeish and the Dewar government became embroiled in the 2000 SQA examinations controversy. The introduction in Scotland of the reformed examinations system in 2000 was criticised in the press and by the Government after a series of administrative and computer errors led to several thousand incorrect Higher and Intermediate certificates being sent out by post. 

There had been suggestions that both McLeish and his corresponding Minister for Education Sam Galbraith were not informed about the issues, with McLeish later confirming that a process of &quot;vigorous investigation&quot; was underway. It was later confirmed that several senior officials within the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) would be facing disciplinary action as a result of the error. &quot;BBC News&quot; said that both the Chief Executive of the SQA, Ron Tuck, and the Minister for Education, Sam Galbraith, were &quot;kept in the dark&quot; about the problems. It had been announced that concerns were raised months prior to the error being made that exam results would not be ready when expected but assurances continued to be provided that results would be issued on time and when expected.

The crisis took several months to resolve, and several management figures including the Chief Executive, Ron Tuck, resigned or lost their jobs as a result. Bill Morton became the new Chief Executive of the SQA, the organisations third in only five days, and upon his appointment said that the reassessing of exam results was his priority and that of the SQA.

== 2000 Labour leadership bid ==

On 11 October 2000, Dewar died of a brain haemorrhage following a fall outside Bute House the previous day. Deputy First Minister Jim Wallace served as the acting First Minister, until the election of a new leader of Scottish Labour was held after Dewar&#x27;s funeral. On 19 October, McLeish launched his bid to be the next leader of the Scottish Labour Party, with Jack McConnell later announcing his bid.

The ballot was held amongst a restricted electorate of Labour MSPs and members of Scottish Labour&#x27;s national executive, because there was insufficient time for a full election to be held. McLeish defeated his rival Jack McConnell by 44 votes to 36 in the race to become the second first minister.

== First Minister of Scotland (2000–2001) ==
McLeish was officially sworn into office as first minister of Scotland on 27 October 2000 at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after receiving the Royal Warrant of Appointment by Queen Elizabeth II. The following day, he formed his administration, which was a continuation of the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition.

=== Governmental record ===

Professor John Curtice, a prominent political analyst, commented that McLeish would not have the &quot;kind of authority&quot; that Donald Dewar enjoyed. He travelled widely, particularly in the United States. He managed several task forces designed to improve the competitiveness of Scottish industry, especially the PILOT project for Scottish oil and gas supply chains.

He was embarrassed when an open microphone recorded him with Helen Liddell in a television studio, describing Scottish Secretary John Reid as &quot;a patronising bastard&quot; and said of his colleague, Brian Wilson, &quot;Brian is supposed to be in charge of Africa but he spends most of his time in bloody Dublin. He is a liability&quot;.

===Acts of Parliament===
Whilst in government serving as first minister, McLeish oversaw and implemented the free personal care for the elderly scheme as well as the implementation of the McCrone Agreement for education teachers in Scotland.

===International relations===

McLeish travelled to the United States in April 2001 where he met with President of the United States, George W. Bush, in the Oval Office at the White House. The following day, McLeish was criticised over his decision to appointment a Scottish ambassador to Washington D.C. which was described as &quot;a threat to the future of the United Kingdom&quot;. McLeish announced that the role of the ambassador in the United States would be largely promoting Scotland and its image in the United States. 

The Scottish Executive later confirmed that the official in Washington D.C. would not take on the titles ambassador or consul, and that they would be instructed by the Scottish Executive to work in conjunction with the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Washington D.C.. Christopher Mayer, the British Ambassador to the United States, was consulted on the creation of the position within the Scottish Executive and was said to have &quot;given the role his full support&quot;. McLeish pledged that the official would be in place by the end of 2001, and said that the appointment was &quot;about the future and Scotland&#x27;s continued modernisation as a dynamic, globally-connected nation where opportunity is extended to all and no-one is left out&quot;.

During his tenure as first minister, McLeish conducted international visits in six countries – Italy and Belgium in December 2000, the United States in April 2001, a further two visits to Belgium in May and October 2001, Finland in September 2001, and Taiwan and Japan in October 2001.

===Officegate and resignation===

McLeish resigned as first minister in November 2001, amid a scandal involving allegations he sub-let part of his tax-subsidised Westminster constituency office without it having been registered in the register of interests kept in the Parliamentary office. The press quickly dubbed the scandal &quot;Officegate&quot;, and confirmed that McLeish had been sub–letting the office for most of his career whilst at Westminster. 

Though McLeish could not have personally benefited financially from the oversight, he undertook to repay the £36,000 rental income, and resigned to allow Scottish Labour a clean break to prepare for the 2003 Scottish Parliament election. During his resignation speech to the Scottish Parliament on 8 November 2001, McLeish admitted wrongdoing in relation to the scandal but was critical of the role the media played in his decision to resign as first minister, stating that he was &quot;suprised and dismayed that my family, friends, staff and colleagues have been brought into matters that are my responsibility alone&quot;. 

During his resignation address to the parliament, he received a standing ovation from members of his own party before stating that he believed &quot;now was the time for someone else to lead us&quot;. McLeish wrote a letter to the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, David Steel, confirming his resignation and also notified the queen. 

Following his resignation as first minister, McLeish continued to serve as the MSP for Central Fife but did not seek re-election at the 2003 election despite seeking support and 12 out of 13 required votes from the constituency Labour Party in 2002 for re–nomination as the candidate for the 2003 election.

== Post-premiership ==

Since leaving mainstream politics, McLeish has lectured widely in the United States, particularly at the United States Air Force Academy and the University of Arkansas, where he holds a visiting professorship shared between the Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences and the University of Arkansas School of Law. He is considered an expert on European-American relations and on the European Union.

In August 2007, he was appointed to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission, established by the Scottish Government. He also chaired the Scottish Prisons Commission, which produced a report into sentencing and the criminal justice system in 2008 entitled &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Choice&quot;. McLeish concluded a &quot;major report&quot; on the state of football in Scotland, which had been commissioned by the Scottish Football Association, in April 2010.

McLeish claimed that Scottish football was &quot;underachieving, under performing and under funded&quot; at a press conference to unveil the report.

== Public image and legacy ==
McLeish&#x27;s close working relationship with inaugural first minister Donald Dewar meant that, at the time of Dewar&#x27;s death, McLeish was regarded by many in the Press as Dewar&#x27;s continuity candidate. A 2000 feature in The Economist described him variably as both &quot;Labour&#x27;s next most experienced politician&quot; and &quot;too keen to be his [Dewar&#x27;s] deputy for Mr Dewar&#x27;s liking&quot;.

The same article portrayed McLeish as having a distant relationship with Labour&#x27;s leader in London, Tony Blair, but with a reputation for being a &quot;moderniser&quot; given his work alongside Donald Dewar in securing devolution. His work on the foundational Devolution Bill secured him the nickname of &quot;Mr. Devolution&quot; in parliament.

In contrast to &quot;Dewar&#x27;s gregariousness&quot;, however, The Economist described McLeish as &quot;a bit of a loner&quot; within the Scottish Parliament, &quot;keeping his head down when there is trouble&quot;. The Scotsman described him as a &quot;hard grafter&quot;, commenting in length on his former career as a footballer.

Despite denying intentional wrongdoing, McLeish&#x27;s short tenure and rapid departure from office amid scandal likely dampened his public legacy. His successor, Jack McConnell, appeared keen &quot;to remove the influence of … Henry McLeish&quot; from the Scottish Government by sacking most of his ministerial appointees within days of entering office. 

Since resigning as an MSP in 2003, McLeish has kept an active profile within Scotland&#x27;s print media, writing on politics for The Scotsman, The Herald, and The National.

== Political views ==

=== Scottish devolution ===
As a strong devolutionist, he was one of the original signatories of the claim of right at the inaugural meeting of the 1989 Scottish constitutional convention which paved the way for devolution.

=== Scottish nationalism ===
In the run up to the referendum on Scottish independence on 18 September 2014, there was much media and public speculation towards whether McLeish backed a &quot;No&quot; vote to remain within the United Kingdom, or whether he supported a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in order to create an independent separate sovereign Scotland.

Speculation from the public came from media articles in which McLeish was reported to be talking negatively about the prospect of a &quot;No&quot; vote to remain within the union, but was later reported as stating it would be &quot;near impossible&quot; to vote Yes in the referendum.

Following the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership, in which the majority of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, but the majority of the Scottish electorate voted to remain in the EU, McLeish has since claimed that he would support and campaign for an independent Scottish sovereign state and campaign for it to be a fully functioning member and participate fully within the European Union despite Brexit. In September 2021, he reiterated that he would support independence if the union was not reformed.

<text>Rancho Cucamonga was a Mexican land grant in present-day San Bernardino County, California, given in 1839 to the dedicated soldier, smuggler and politician Tiburcio Tapia by Mexican governor Juan Bautista Alvarado. The grant formed parts of present-day California cities Rancho Cucamonga and Upland. It extended easterly from San Antonio Creek to what is now Hermosa Avenue, and from today&#x27;s Eighth Street to the mountains.

==History==
The Mission San Gabriel established the Rancho Cucamonga as a site for grazing their cattle. In 1839, the rancho was granted by the Mexican governor of California to Tiburcio Tapia, a wealthy Los Angeles merchant. Tapia transferred his cattle to Cucamonga and built a fort-like adobe house on Red Hill. The Rancho was inherited by Tapia&#x27;s daughter, Maria Merced Tapia de Prudhomme, and her husband Leon Victor Prudhomme.

With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Cucamonga was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852, and the grant was patented to Leon V. Prudhomme in 1872.

Rancho Cucamonga was sold in 1858 to John Rains. Rains in 1856 married Maria Merced Williams, the daughter of Rancho Santa Ana del Chino owner Isaac Williams and granddaughter of Antonio Maria Lugo, owner of Rancho San Bernardino. Maria was thus a wealthy heiress, and Rains invested in three ranchos and the Bella Union Hotel in Los Angeles. John Rains was murdered on November 17, 1862. Three men including Tomas Procopio Bustamante were accused but only Manuel Ceredel was caught. Ceredel claimed he, Precopio and four others were paid $500 by Ramon Carrillo, another ranchero and political opponent, to kill Rains. Ceradel was convicted of attempting to murder the sheriff&#x27;s deputy who arrested him and was sentenced to 10 years in San Quentin. As the sheriff took Ceredel on a boat to San Francisco, a group of vigilantes lynched Ceredel. Carrillo was examined in court twice and was released, no evidence having been found against him. Ramon Carrillo always maintained his innocence of the crime, but he was shot in the back from ambush and killed on the Los Angeles road west of Cucamonga on May 21, 1864, in another unsolved murder.

Maria Merced married José Carrillo in 1864. She had nine children in all: five with Rains, and four with Carrillo. Isaias W. Hellman, a Los Angeles banker, and a San Francisco business syndicate acquired the Rancho Cucamonga at a sheriff&#x27;s sale in 1871. Hellman and his partners, which included former Governor John Downey, subdivided the land. Hellman continued to make port and sweet Angelica wine from Cucamonga&#x27;s fabled vineyard. Tapia had first planted grapes in 1839 and Rains had increased the vineyard to in 1859.

In 1882, George Chaffey, a Canadian from the province of Ontario, purchased of the Rancho Cucamonga land for $90,000. Chaffey established an irrigation colony which he named Ontario, after his homeland of Ontario, Canada. The Ontario colony later became the city of Ontario, incorporated in 1891. The northern part of Chaffey&#x27;s Ontario colony became the city of Upland, incorporated in 1906.

In 1977 three unincorporated communities which had emerged on the old ranch lands—Alta Loma, Cucamonga and Etiwanda—became the city of Rancho Cucamonga.

<doc id="523517" wikidata="Q16385462" url="?curid=523517" title="The Deserted Village">
<text>The Deserted Village is a poem by Oliver Goldsmith published in 1770. It is a work of social commentary, and condemns rural depopulation and the pursuit of excessive wealth.

The poem is written in heroic couplets, and describes the decline of a village and the emigration of many of its residents to America. In the poem, Goldsmith criticises rural depopulation, the moral corruption found in towns, consumerism, enclosure, landscape gardening, avarice, and the pursuit of wealth from international trade. The poem employs, in the words of one critic, &quot;deliberately precise obscurity&quot;, and does not reveal the reason why the village has been deserted. The poem was very popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but also provoked critical responses, including from other poets such as George Crabbe. References to the poem, and particularly its ominous &quot;Ill fares the land&quot; warning, have appeared in a number of other contexts.

== Background ==

Goldsmith grew up in the hamlet of Lissoy in Ireland. In the 1760s, he travelled extensively around England, visiting many small settlements at a time when the enclosure movement was at its height.

The poem is dedicated to the artist Sir Joshua Reynolds, with whom Goldsmith was a close friend and founding member, along with Samuel Johnson, of a dining society called The Club. Reynolds had helped to promote Goldsmith&#x27;s play &quot;The Good-Natur&#x27;d Man&quot; to the actor and theatre manager David Garrick, and had facilitated Goldsmith&#x27;s appointment as the historian of the Royal Academy.

&quot;The Deserted Village&quot; condemns rural depopulation and the indulgence of the rich. This was a subject that Goldsmith had addressed in his earlier poem &quot;The Traveller; or a Prospect of Society&quot; (1764), which also condemned the corrupting influence of extreme wealth. Goldsmith also set out his ideas about rural depopulation in an essay entitled &quot;The Revolution in Low Life&quot;, published in &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Evening Post&quot; in 1762.

There is no single place which has been identified as the village of the poem&#x27;s title, called Auburn in the poem. Although some contend that the location of the poem&#x27;s deserted village is unknown, others note that Auburn village close to Athlone is the likely subject of Goldsmith&#x27;s poem. Travel-guide authors Samuel Carter Hall and Anna Hall write in their 1853 &quot;Hand-books for Ireland: The West and Connamara&quot; that the British tourist should disembark from their train at Athlone&#x27;s Moate Station and &quot;make a pilgrimage to the renowned village of Auburn&quot; located six miles from Moate Station (Hall &amp; Hall, 1853, pp. 4–5). The Halls explain that although Goldsmith was born in the village of Pallas (also known as Pallice or Pallasmore), his father was soon appointed to the Kilkenny-West Rectory, and he therefore moved his family (circa 1730) to the village of Auburn, also known as Lissoy and, to the locals, as &quot;The Pigeons&quot; (ibid.). Lissoy has &quot;now and for nearly a century [been] known as Auburn&quot; and is &quot;so marked on the maps&quot; (ibid.). For a similar claim regarding Auburn in County Westmeath as the Auburn of Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;, see J. Stirling Coyne and N.P. Willis&#x27;s &quot;The Scenery and Antiquities of Ireland&quot; published c. 1841 (Vol. 1, Chap. 4). Others speculate merely that &quot;the description may have been influenced by Goldsmith&#x27;s memory of his childhood in rural Ireland, and his travels around England.&quot;

While personal references in the poem give the impression of referring to the village in which Goldsmith grew up, the poem has also been associated with Nuneham Courtenay in Oxfordshire. In &quot;The Revolution in Low Life&quot;, Goldsmith had condemned the destruction of a village within of London in order to construct a fashionable landscape garden. Goldsmith reported that he had personally witnessed this scene in 1761. In the same year, Nuneham Courtenay was removed to make way for Nuneham Park. Its owner—Simon Harcourt, 1st Earl Harcourt—moved the village away. There are a number of other concordances between Nuneham Courtenay&#x27;s destruction and the contents of &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;. At Nuneham Courtenay, only an old woman was allowed to remain living in her house—Goldsmith&#x27;s poem features an old woman who returns to the village, and she is depicted on the title page of the first edition. The position of both villages, on a hill near a river, was similar, and both had parsons who enjoyed gardening.

However, Robert Seitz has argued that while &quot;The Revolution in Low Life&quot; greatly strengthens the case for identifying the deserted village as English, Goldsmith saw in this unnamed village &quot;only what he wished to see&quot;, using it to fit a set of political and social ideas which were &quot;made up largely of elements absorbed in Ireland&quot;.

==Analysis==

=== Synopsis ===

The poem opens with a description of a village named Auburn, written in the past tense.

:Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain;
:Where health and plenty cheered the labouring swain,
:Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid,
:And parting summer&#x27;s lingering blooms delayed (lines 1–4).

The poem then moves on to describe the village in its current state, reporting that it has been abandoned by its residents with its buildings ruined.

:Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all,
:And the long grass o&#x27;ertops the mouldering wall;
:And trembling, shrinking from the spoiler&#x27;s hand,
:Far, far away thy children leave the land
: Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,
:Where wealth accumulates, and men decay (lines 47–52)

After nostalgic descriptions of Auburn&#x27;s parson, schoolmaster and alehouse, Goldsmith makes a direct attack on the usurpation of agricultural land by the wealthy:

:... The man of wealth and pride
:Takes up a space that many poor supplied;
:Space for his lake, his park&#x27;s extended bounds,
:Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds:
:The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth
:Has robbed the neighbouring fields of half their growth (lines 275–300)

The poem later condemns the luxury and corruption of the city, and describes the fate of a country girl who moved there:

:Where the poor houseless shivering female lies.
:She once, perhaps, in village plenty blessed,
:Has wept at tales of innocence distressed;
:Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,
:Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn:
:Now lost to all; her friends, her virtue fled,
:Near her betrayer&#x27;s door she lays her head,
:And, pinched with cold, and shrinking from the shower,
:With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour,
:When idly first, ambitious of the town,
:She left her wheel and robes of country brown. (Lines 326–36)

Goldsmith then states that the residents of Auburn have not moved to the city, but have emigrated overseas. He describes these foreign lands as follows:

:Far different there from all that charmed before
:The various terrors of that horrid shore;
:Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray,
:And fiercely shed intolerable day (lines 345–8)

The poem mentions &quot;wild Altama&quot;, perhaps a reference to the &quot;Altamaha River&quot; in Georgia, an American colony founded by James Oglethorpe to receive paupers and criminals from Britain. As the poem nears its end, Goldsmith gives a warning, before reporting that even Poetry herself has fled abroad:

:Even now the devastation is begun,
:And half the business of destruction done;
:Even now, methinks, as pondering here I stand,
:I see the rural virtues leave the land.
:Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail (lines 395–9)

The poem ends with the hope that Poetry can help those who have been exiled:

:Still let thy voice, prevailing over time,
:Redress the rigours of the inclement clime;
:Aid slighted truth with thy persuasive strain,
:Teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain;
:Teach him, that states of native strength possest,
:Tho&#x27; very poor, may still be very blest;
:That trade&#x27;s proud empire hastes to swift decay,
:As ocean sweeps the labour&#x27;d mole away;
:While self-dependent power can time defy,
:As rocks resist the billows and the sky. (Lines 421–30)

===Genre, prosody and influences===
The poem has 430 lines, divided into heroic couplets. This form features an &quot;AABBCC...&quot; rhyme scheme, with ten-syllable lines written in iambic pentameter. It is an example of georgic and pastoral poetry. The poem is also an example of Augustan verse. In its use of a balanced account of Auburn in its inhabited and deserted states, and in its employment of an authorly persona within the poem, it conforms to contemporary neoclassical conventions.

Goldsmith was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and had read Latin poetry since childhood. He would, therefore, have been aware of the criticisms made by classical writers such as Juvenal and Pliny of the displacement of the rural poor by the rich. Furthermore, in the eighteenth century the decline of the Roman Empire was attributed to the growth of luxury and pride in Rome. Goldsmith, in emphasising the danger that England faced from its increase in wealth, was drawing an obvious parallel. Ricardo Quintana has argued that the poem takes Virgil&#x27;s first &quot;Eclogue&quot; as its model.

Quintana has also highlighted the way that the poem presents a series of contrasts. In the early parts of the poem, old &quot;Sweet Auburn&quot; and the deserted village are contrasted. Later in the poem, Quintana argues, Goldsmith places nature and art, frugality and luxury, &quot;national vigor and national corruption&quot;, and the country and the city, in opposition.

=== Social commentary ===

&quot;The Deserted Village&quot; condemns rural depopulation, the enclosure of common land, the creation of landscape gardens and the pursuit of excessive wealth. In Goldsmith&#x27;s vision, wealth does not necessarily bring either prosperity or happiness. Indeed, it can be dangerous to the maintenance of British liberties and displaces traditional community. In making this argument, some have regarded Goldsmith not as a political radical, but as a socially-concerned &quot;conservative&quot;. Indeed, his emphasis on the corrupting effects of luxury fit closely with discourses associated with Tory writers of the time.

Sebastian Mitchell has argued that Goldsmith employs &quot;deliberately precise obscurity&quot; in the poem, concealing the reason for the village&#x27;s demise. While this may detract from the authority of Goldsmith&#x27;s social critique, it also allows readers to project their own concerns onto the poem. Bell comments that while Goldsmith criticises enclosure in an indirect manner, he does not attribute Auburn&#x27;s decline to it. However, Bell also argues that commerce is clearly the &quot;arch-villain of the piece&quot;, and it is the riches that a small minority have accumulated from international trade that allow rural people to be displaced from their lands so that country estates can be created. Furthermore, Alfred Lutz has commented that Goldsmith&#x27;s attacks on landscape gardening have a wider political significance, because enclosure&#x27;s defenders sometimes compared enclosed fields to gardens.

Mitchell also argues that criticism which focuses solely on the poem&#x27;s historical accuracy misses its wider commentary on late-eighteenth-century social issues, particularly the question of &quot;urban estrangement&quot;.

== Publication history ==
The poem was completed in 1769, and was first published in May 1770. Appearing in quarto format, five further editions were released in the same year.

It was published in eleven editions in the United States by the end of the century.

=== Illustrations and other artwork ===

The title page of the first edition featured an engraving by Isaac Taylor. The illustration depicts the old woman mentioned in the poem, standing in front of the deserted village. In the background a ship departs, presumably for America.

Thomas Bewick and his school also produced several depictions of scenes from &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;, some of which occurred as illustrations of published versions of the poem or Goldsmith&#x27;s works. In 1794, Bewick produced woodcuts to illustrate a volume entitled &quot;The Poetical Works of Oliver Goldsmith&quot;. In the following year, Bewick and his brother John Bewick (1760-1795) again engraved illustrations for a volume entitled &quot;Poems by Goldsmith and Parnell&quot;. The magnitude of this project meant that Bewick enlisted several collaborators to produce the illustrations.

Bewick also depicted scenes from &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; which appeared in other places. An engraving of his edition of &quot;Fables of Aesop&quot;, published in 1818, features a scene depicting a quotation from the poem carved into a rock.

The painter Francis Wheatley submitted two paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts in 1800, both of which depicted scenes from &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;. The paintings were copied by an engraver, and appeared in an edition of Goldsmith&#x27;s poetry published in the same year by F. J. du Roveray.

== Critical reception ==

=== Eighteenth-century reception ===
Alfred Lutz has argued that the poem generated two different types of reception. Firstly, some readers admired Goldsmith&#x27;s economic and social arguments, or at least reflected upon them in their own writings. Political radicals, such as Thomas Spence and John Thelwall quoted &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; in their own works, as did a number of other writers. Secondly, readers and critics ignored the political content of the poem, focussing instead on Goldsmith&#x27;s idyllic descriptions of Auburn. This second type of reading was the most common. Sebastian Mitchell states that some modern critics have seen the poem as appearing at a turning point in British culture, when public social and political opinions, and private emotional dispositions, diverged. With the publication of texts such as Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776) shortly after &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;, political and economic discussion increasingly became the preserve not of poetry, but of a &quot;scientific&quot; version of political economy.

In the United States, a different reading occurred—while the English Auburn may have been deserted, the new world offered opportunities for the recreation of Goldsmith&#x27;s idyll.

Early critics also questioned the validity of Goldsmith&#x27;s argument about rural depopulation and decline. In 1770, for instance, Thomas Comber argued that the population of rural England was not decreasing, and that enclosure could increase farmers&#x27; demand for labourers. An early review in &quot;The Critical Review&quot; also defended the value of England&#x27;s increase in wealth, and questioned whether rural depopulation had become an important problem. Modern economic historians have supported Comber&#x27;s comments about depopulation. George Crabbe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Village&quot; (1783) was written as a riposte to what its author saw as the excessive sentimentality of Goldsmith&#x27;s verse. In his poem, Crabbe describes the hardships of the rural poor, in a way that Goldsmith did not. Furthermore, Crabbe&#x27;s poem encourages the interpretation of Goldsmith&#x27;s bucolic depiction of old &quot;sweet Auburn&quot; in &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; as being a representation of the &quot;status quo&quot; in 1770, rather than a depiction of an idealised past through which current moral decline can be highlighted. &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; is, in this interpretation, &quot;depoliticised&quot;—an act that was reinforced by nineteenth-century interpretations produced by Thomas Babington Macaulay and two of Goldsmith&#x27;s biographers.

The poem also generated other responses in verse. While Crabbe emphasised the misery and poverty of rural life, Robert Bloomfield&#x27;s &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Boy&quot; (1800) returned to the theme of the rural idyll, but without Goldsmith or Crabbe&#x27;s political criticism. &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; was a major influence on Bloomfield, as was Alexander Pope&#x27;s pastoral poetry.

=== Later reception ===

The poem&#x27;s reception in the Victorian era was largely positive. The Irish playwright Edmund Falconer (c. 1814–1879) adapted the work to suit as opera libretto for the three-act opera of the same name (1880) by John William Glover (1815–1899).

=== Cultural references ===

The poem has influenced the production of several notable cultural works. In 1825, Goldsmith&#x27;s great-nephew—also called Oliver Goldsmith—wrote a response to his relative&#x27;s poem, entitled &quot;The Rising Village&quot;.

The first half of line 51 from the poem (&quot;Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey&quot;) has provided a title to several books and films, including Carey McWilliams&#x27;s &quot;Ill Fares the Land: Migrants and Migratory Labor in the United States&quot; (1942) and &quot;Ill Fares the Land&quot; (2010) by Tony Judt.

A single line from &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; is inscribed on the plinth of a statue of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in Saxon Dress. The marble original with plinth is in the Royal Collection, and a copy of the sculpture is in the National Portrait Gallery in London. The words on the plinth are &quot;ALLURED TO BRIGHTER WORLDS, AND LED THE WAY&quot;.

In Ireland the village described in the poem is thought to be Glasson village, near Athlone. Signage around the village points out the association with Oliver Goldsmith. In American popular culture, and specifically that of Alabama, the poem&#x27;s first line &quot;Sweet Auburn, Loveliest village of the plain&quot; is the basis for the term &quot;Auburn Plainsman/Plainsmen&quot; which is used to refer to an Auburn University student and is also the source for the name of the University student Newspaper, The Auburn Plainsman. Mount Auburn Cemetery in Watertown and Cambridge, Massachusetts, is also named after the village in the poem. The suburb of Auburn in Sydney is also named after the village.

On The Alan Parsons Project&#x27;s 1984 album Ammonia Avenue, the title track contains the lyrics &quot;And those who came at first to scoff, remained behind to pray, And those who came at first to scoff, remained behind to pray&quot;, derived (apparently) from Goldsmith&#x27;s line &quot;And fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray.&quot;

<text>Catherine Margaret Ashton, Baroness Ashton of Upholland (born 20 March 1956) is a British Labour politician who served as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and First Vice President of the European Commission in the Barroso Commission from 2009 to 2014.

Her political career began in 1999 when she was created a life peer as &quot;Baroness Ashton of Upholland, of St Albans in the County of Hertfordshire&quot;, by Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour government. She became the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Education and Skills in 2001 and subsequently in the Ministry of Justice in 2004. She was appointed a Privy Counsellor in May 2006 and Lady Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter in April 2023.

Ashton became Leader of the House of Lords and Lord President of the Council in Gordon Brown&#x27;s first Cabinet in June 2007. She was instrumental in steering the EU&#x27;s Treaty of Lisbon through the UK Parliament&#x27;s upper chamber. In 2008, she was appointed as the British European Commissioner and became the Commissioner for Trade in the European Commission.

In December 2009, she became the inaugural High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy that was created by the Treaty of Lisbon. As High Representative, Ashton served as the EU&#x27;s foreign policy chief. Despite being criticised by some, particularly at the time of her appointment and in the early stages of her term of office, for her limited previous experience of international diplomacy, Ashton subsequently won praise for her work as a negotiator in difficult international situations, in particular for her role in bringing Serbia and Kosovo to an agreement in April 2013 that normalised their ties, and in the P5+1 talks with Iran which led to the November 2013 Geneva interim agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme.

In January 2017, Ashton became Chancellor of the University of Warwick, succeeding Sir Richard Lambert and becoming Warwick&#x27;s first female chancellor.

==Early life==
Catherine Ashton was born at Upholland, Lancashire, on 20 March 1956. She comes from a working-class family, with a background in coal mining.

Ashton attended Upholland Grammar School in Billinge Higher End, Lancashire, then Wigan Mining and Technical College, Wigan. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology in 1977 from Bedford College, London (now part of Royal Holloway, University of London). Ashton was the first person in her family to attend university.

==Career==

===United Kingdom===
Between 1977 and 1983, Ashton worked for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) as an administrator and in 1982 was elected as its national treasurer and subsequently as one of its vice-chairs. From 1979 to 1981 she was business manager of the Coverdale Organisation, a management consultancy.

As of 1983 she worked for the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work. From 1983 to 1989 she was director of Business in the Community, working with business to tackle inequality, and she established the Employers&#x27; Forum on Disability, Opportunity Now, and the Windsor Fellowship. For most of the 1990s, she was a freelance policy adviser. She chaired the Health Authority in Hertfordshire from 1998 to 2001 and she became a vice-president of the National Council for One-Parent Families.

She was created a Labour Life Peer as &quot;Baroness Ashton of Upholland&quot; in 1999, under Prime Minister Tony Blair. In June 2001 she was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Education and Skills. In 2002 she became Minister responsible for Sure Start in the same department, and in September 2004 she was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, with responsibilities including the National Archives and the Public Guardianship Office. Ashton was sworn of the Privy Council in 2006, and she became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the new Ministry of Justice in May 2007.

In 2005 she was voted &quot;Minister of the Year&quot; by &quot;The House&quot; magazine and &quot;Peer of the Year&quot; by Channel 4. In 2006 she won the &quot;Politician of the Year&quot; award at the annual Stonewall Awards, made to those who had a positive impact on the lives of British LGBT people.

On 28 June 2007, Prime Minister Gordon Brown appointed Ashton to HM Cabinet as Leader of the House of Lords and Lord President of the Council. As Government Leader in the House of Lords, she was responsible for steering the Lisbon Treaty through the Upper House.

===European Union===
On 3 October 2008, Ashton was nominated by the UK to replace Peter Mandelson as the European Commissioner for Trade. Because European Commissioners may not engage in any other occupation during their term of office, whether gainful or not, she used the procedural device previously adopted in 1984 by Lord Cockfield and took a leave of absence from the House of Lords on 14 October 2008, retaining her peerage but not her seat.

During her term, Ashton represented the EU in negotiations related to a long-running dispute over beef with the United States (May 2009), led the EU delegation in an agreement with South Korea that removed virtually all tariffs between the two economies (October 2009) and represented the EU in ending a long-running dispute over banana imports, principally involving Latin America and the EU.

====Foreign Affairs and Security Policy====
On 19 November 2009, Ashton was appointed the EU&#x27;s first High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security policy. Her appointment was agreed at a summit by 27 European Union leaders in Brussels. Having initially pushed for former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to become President of the European Council, Gordon Brown eventually relented on the condition that the post of High Representative be awarded to a Briton.

Ashton&#x27;s relative obscurity prior to her appointment prompted comment in the media. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper reported that her appointment as High Representative had received a &quot;cautious welcome... from international relations experts&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; described her as being a virtual unknown with paltry political experience, having no foreign-policy background and never having been elected to anything. The magazine credited her, however, with piloting the Lisbon Treaty through the House of Lords, handling the European Commission&#x27;s Trade Portfolio without disagreement with her colleagues, and being suited to consensus-building.

Critics predicted she would be out of her depth. Nile Gardiner of The Heritage Foundation, who opposed a European Union role in foreign and security policy on principle, wrote in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; &quot;This may well be the most ridiculous appointment in EU history&quot;. Daniel Hannan, a British Conservative MEP, complained that she had &quot;no background in trade issues at a time when the EU is engaged in critical negotiations with Canada, Korea and the WTO&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; quoted an anonymous Whitehall source as commenting &quot;Cathy just got lucky...The appointment of her and Herman Van Rompuy European Council president was a complete disgrace. They are no more than garden gnomes.&quot;

By contrast, former Home Secretary Charles Clarke said: &quot;I have seen Cathy in action. I have great respect for her. She is excellent at building good relations with people and a good negotiator&quot;. Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, a human-rights pressure group, said: &quot;people underestimate Cathy at their peril. She is not a great big bruiser. She is a persuader and a charmer. That is the secret of her success.&quot;

After a confirmation hearing by the Trade Committee of the European Parliament, Ashton was approved by the Parliament on 22 October 2008 by 538 to 40 votes, with 63 abstentions. She took office on 1 December 2009 for a five-year-term.

She was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the 2015 New Year Honours List for services to the European Common Foreign and Security Policy.

====Notable events of her term as High Representative====

Notable events of her term included:
* Establishing the European External Action Service (1 December 2010), which merged the external relations departments of the European Commission and the Council of the European Union, and was to have diplomats seconded from national foreign services. Throughout the first half of 2010 Ashton sought agreement between the Council, the Parliament and the Commission over the shape of the EEAS. Parliament agreed to the plan on 8 July, when MEPs approved the service by 549 votes for and 78 against with 17 abstentions. The Council approved the transfer of departments to the EAS on 20 July. Until the EEAS became operational, Ashton had been supported by a staff of about 30 people.
*Working with EU Special Representative Alexander Rondos to head Operation Atalanta: an EU military action off the coast of Somalia, which curtailed piracy (May 2012).
* Helping to reach a deal&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Report on Serbia/Kosovo deal&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; between Serbia and Kosovo that normalised their ties (April 2013).
* Successfully negotiating with the Egyptian Army a visit to the deposed president, Mohamed Morsi, in their custody. She reported that he was in good health and was well treated and aware of current affairs. (July 2013.)
* Chairmanship of the P5+1 in their negotiations with Iran on nuclear matters in 2013, which led to the Geneva interim agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme (November 2013).
*Her visit to Kyiv during Ukraine&#x27;s Euromaidan protests.

====Serbia-Kosovo====
In April 2013, after two years of negotiations, the governments of Serbia and Kosovo reached agreement to normalise their relations. Although Serbia did not formally recognise Kosovo as an independent state, it did &quot;in effect – concede that the government in Pristina has legal authority over the whole territory, including Serb-majority areas of northern Kosovo&quot;. In return, Kosovo agreed to grant a degree of autonomy to four Serb-majority areas. The agreement, which among other things removed obstacles to Serbia and Kosovo joining the European Union, followed Ashton&#x27;s mediation of ten rounds of talks between Serbia&#x27;s Prime Minister, Ivica Dacic, and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci.
A cross-party committee of the U.S. House of Representatives nominated Ashton and her fellow negotiators Dacic and Thaci for the Nobel Peace Prize. A similar nomination came from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament

====Iran====
After the November 2013 negotiation of an interim agreement with Iran over its nuclear programme, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; wrote that Ashton was &quot;no longer the diplomatic dilettante&quot;. A senior French diplomat was quoted as saying, &quot;I tip my hat to her... She truly played a decisive role&quot;. The report continued that, after initially insisting on negotiating only with other foreign ministers, by the latter stages of the negotiations the Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif &quot;now... wanted to deal only with Lady Ashton&quot;. Said a western diplomat, &quot;That the others agreed to this was significant. For China and Russia to be outside while she was in the room negotiating details was quite remarkable&quot;.

====Ukraine====

In December 2013 Ashton visited Kyiv. She said she was impressed by the &quot;determination of Ukrainians demonstrating for the European perspective of their country&quot; and observed &quot;with sadness that police used force to remove peaceful people from the center of Kyiv... Dialogue with political forces and society and the use of arguments is always better than the argument of force&quot;. Subsequently, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin criticised Ashton&#x27;s categorisation of the anti-government protests in Kyiv as peaceful in nature, pointing to the death of a number of police officers.

At the beginning of March a recording of a conversation between Ashton and the Estonian foreign minister Urmas Paet was released. In the call, Paet said he had been told by a woman doctor named Olga that snipers responsible for killing police and civilians in Kyiv last month were protest movement provocateurs rather than supporters of then-president Viktor Yanukovych. Ashton responds: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know … Gosh.&quot; &quot;So there is a stronger and stronger understanding that behind snipers it was not Yanukovych, it was somebody from the new coalition&quot;, Paet says. Ashton replies: &quot;I think we do want to investigate. I didn&#x27;t pick that up, that&#x27;s interesting. Gosh&quot;, she says. The Estonian foreign ministry confirmed the accuracy of the leak but clarified that &quot;Foreign Minister Paet was giving an overview of what he had heard in Kyiv and expressed concern over the situation on the ground. We reject the claim that Paet was giving an assessment of the opposition&#x27;s involvement in the violence.&quot; The woman doctor, Olga Bogomolets, said in an interview reported by Paul Waldie of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that, in her conversation with the Estonian minister, &quot;she did not indicate that protesters used snipers. She simply relayed to the Estonian minister what she saw that day – protesters shot in the head and heart. &#x27;What I saw were people who were killed by snipers and only on [protesters&#x27;] side.&#x27;&quot;

On 28 March 2014 Ashton issued a news release condemning violence by members of the Ukrainian nationalist political party Right Sector, stating, &quot;I strongly condemn the pressure by activists of the Right Sector who have surrounded the building of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Such an intimidation of the parliament is against ... democratic principles and [the] rule of law. I call on the Right Sector and other parties in Ukraine to refrain from the use or threat of violence. They need to hand over any unauthorised arms to the authorities immediately.&quot;

====Russia====

President Putin signed the new treason law on 12 November 2012. Ashton expressed concern at the new law &quot;potentially penalizing contacts with foreign nationals with up to 20 years in prison&quot; and reducing &quot;the burden of proof for charges of treason and espionage&quot;. The United Nations Committee Against Torture stated that the new law could prohibit sharing information on the human rights situation in Russia with the United Nations human rights organs. According to Ashton, the March 2013 inspection wave in Russia seemed aimed at &quot;undermining civil society activities&quot;.

====Egypt====

Ashton condemned the &quot;disproportionate&quot; use of force by Egyptian security forces on August 14, 2013, when the security forces killed over 1000 people during the violent dispersal of mass anti-government sit-ins at Cairo&#x27;s Rabaa al-Adawiya and al-Nahda squares.

===Assessments===
====Early phase as EU High Representative====
Ashton was questioned by Members of the European Parliament in 2009 about her role as national treasurer in the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the 1980s, amid claims by its opponents that it may have had financial links to the Soviet Union. Ashton responded that she had not taken any &quot;direct money from communist countries&quot;. Much of the organisation&#x27;s funds had been &quot;collected in buckets&quot; at marches and demonstrations, she said, adding that she was the first to order an audit of CND&#x27;s finances. Her spokesman said: &quot;She never visited the Soviet Union, she had no contacts with the Soviet Union and she never accepted money from Soviet sources ... She has never been a member of the Communist Party&quot;.

In February 2010, Ashton was criticised within the EU community for not visiting Haiti in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. A number of defence ministers reportedly also complained that she had not attended a European Defence Summit in Majorca. More broadly, senior officials within her team were said to complain that she spoke only in &quot;generalities&quot;. A rumour that she switched off her phone after 8 pm every day was greeted by Ashton with ridicule.

In February 2011, Ashton received the lowest grade in a survey rating the performance of European Commissioners. The survey, carried out by lobbying and PR company Burson-Marsteller, asked 324 Brussels policy-makers to rate the European Commissioners with a grade of A to E (A being the highest). Ashton scored an E for her performance, the only Commissioner to receive a grade below D.

In March 2012, Ashton was criticised by Israeli politicians for comparing the shooting of Jewish children in Toulouse with the situation in Gaza. Ashton told Palestinian youths at a UNRWA event, &quot;When we think of what happened in Toulouse today, when we remember what happened in Norway a year ago, when we know what is happening in Syria, when we see what is happening in Gaza and Sderot and in different parts of the world – we remember young people and children who lose their lives.&quot; After she was quoted in the press as not having mentioned the Israeli city of Sderot, Israeli politicians denounced her for equating the murder of three children and a rabbi in the shooting attack with the situation in Gaza. Her spokesman stated that her remark had been &quot;grossly distorted&quot; and that she had also referenced Israeli victims in Sderot, but this fact had been omitted from the original transcript.
In counterpoint to earlier criticism of Ashton for not travelling enough, in September 2012 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; criticised her for not being present in Brussels for enough European Commission meetings, reporting that Ashton had missed 21 out of 32 regular weekly meetings held so far that year. To the paper&#x27;s complaint that Ashton&#x27;s absences were &quot;leaving Britain without a voice&quot; at such meetings, European diplomatic officials said that, under EU treaties, commissioners serve as representatives not of individual member countries but of the European interest. Ashton&#x27;s staff also pointed to her personal involvement in nuclear negotiations with Iran as among the international responsibilities that had kept her away from Commission meetings.

The Polish Minister for European and Economic Affairs, Mikolaj Dowgielewicz, stated in 2011 that criticism of Ashton was &quot;a lot of hot air&quot; and that &quot;she has an impossible job to do and she is doing it well. At the end of her time in office, people will be more positive about what she has done. She will leave a real legacy.&quot;

Ashton was said in February 2010 to be angry over what she perceived as the &quot;latent sexism&quot; among some of her European peers that underpinned some of the criticisms aimed at her. She told the press that her work was sometimes hampered by the limited resources provided to her. She is not, for example, provided with her own aeroplane: something taken for granted by U.S. Secretaries of State.

====Later phase as EU High Representative====
The tone of public comment on Ashton&#x27;s performance in office was subsequently to be influenced especially by her contributions to negotiations over Kosovo and Iran. In October 2013, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; wrote of her:But now the 57-year-old baroness is suddenly at the center of world diplomacy. And whenever she is mentioned, she earns praise for her hard-nosed negotiating skills, her stamina and her diplomatic talents. It is said that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has much faith in her. &quot;She is discreet and perceptive, but also tenacious. That makes her an ideal negotiator&quot;, says Alexander Graf Lamsdorff, the head of Germany&#x27;s business-friendly Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament and a member of its Committee on Foreign Affairs.

One of the critics of Ashton&#x27;s appointment came to concede her effectiveness in office. In September 2013, Peter Oborne, the chief political commentator of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, wrote:Well, let&#x27;s admit we were all completely wrong. It is now obvious that Catherine Ashton has been a success. In her unobtrusive but determined way, she can boast real achievement. Last year a peace deal was struck between Serbia and Kosovo. Nobody had thought it possible. It was a massive step towards healing ancient hatreds and building economic prosperity. It was brokered by Baroness Ashton... I have never met Baroness Ashton but I guess that one of her secrets is that she keeps her head down, does not flaunt her ego, and allows others to take the credit. It takes little imagination to envisage how a male politician from any of the main parties would have exploited the Kosovo peace-deal, or the Morsi visit. She just kept her head down and quietly got on with her job.

In July 2014, as discussions took place on the selection of Ashton&#x27;s successor, Paul Taylor of Reuters wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as part of a larger critique of the political nature of appointments to the European Commission:While Ms. Ashton had some successes, brokering a first accord between Serbia and Kosovo and leading negotiations for an interim nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, critics say she has too often been missing in action closer to home.

Reflecting on her record, in July 2014, Adam Boulton in the UK&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times&quot; concluded:
 As the European Union&#x27;s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, Catherine Ashton still bestrides the international stage four years after Gordon Brown, the man who gave her the job, was expelled from the corridors of power. She was a surprise nominee to everyone including herself, and few would have expected then that her successor as Britain&#x27;s commissioner would struggle to match Baroness Ashton in calibre and clout.

==Personal life==
Ashton lives in London with her husband, Peter Kellner, the former president of the online polling organisation, YouGov. Ashton and Kellner have been married since 1988. Ashton has two children and three stepchildren.

==Publications==
*&quot;And Then What? Inside Stories of 21st-Century Diplomacy&quot; (Elliott &amp; Thompson, London, 2023) 

== Other activities ==
Catherine Ashton is a member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organisation that works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today&#x27;s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organisation composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organisation officials who work closely with heads of government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

She has been the Chancellor of the University of Warwick since 2016.

==Honours and awards==

===Awards===
In February 2013, Ashton was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

She was awarded an honorary degree from the University of East London in 2005.

In 2019 she was appointed King of Arms of the Order of St Michael and St George. She was appointed chancellor of the order in 2022, and represented the order at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla in 2023.

<text>Hypocrisy is a Swedish death metal band formed in October 1991 in Ludvika by Peter Tägtgren. The band has released thirteen studio albums since their inception, with Tägtgren remaining the band&#x27;s only continuous member. 

==History==
After spending three years in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1990, founder Peter Tägtgren returned to his homeland of Sweden, to form his own band. Hypocrisy&#x27;s early releases were noted as being well-executed death metal, but panned for not being particularly innovative. That criticism waned as the band matured, cultivating a more distinctive sound as well as employing an introspective lyrical approach. Later releases have a more atmospheric sound, with lyrical exploration of aliens and abduction experiences.

Tägtgren&#x27;s experience as a producer may also have led to the band&#x27;s change in musical direction, as he is more closely involved with many other bands while producing their albums.

After twice cancelling a U.S. tour in 2009, Hypocrisy confirmed a North American tour for 2010. Joining them on the &quot;Long Time, No Death&quot; tour were Scar Symmetry, Hate, Blackguard and Swashbuckle. From January to March 2010, they toured Germany, Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, finishing in Moscow. Their North American tour took place in May 2010.

On 14 October 2011, Hypocrisy released a DVD called &quot;Hell Over Sofia - 20 Years of Chaos and Confusion&quot;. It contains a full concert from the &quot;Long Time, No Death&quot; tour. The DVD also contains a one and a half-hour documentary about the band. On 10 November 2011, Mikael Hedlund announced writing material for a new studio album during an interview with &quot;Metal Shock Finland&quot;″s chief editor, Mohsen Fayyazi. Mikael tells &quot;Metal Shock Finland&quot;: 

In early 2012 the band began to write new material for a follow-up to &quot;A Taste of Extreme Divinity&quot;. On 21 December 2012 Hypocrisy announced that the title of the upcoming album is &quot;End of Disclosure&quot;. It was released on 22 March 2013.

Hypocrisy&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, and first in eight years, &quot;Worship&quot; was released on 26 November 2021. The album was preceded by a music video for the first single &quot;Chemical Whore&quot;. It was later elected by &quot;Loudwire&quot; as the 32nd best metal song of 2021.

On 5 April 2022, via the band&#x27;s official Facebook page, the band announced the departure of Horgh from the band. He was replaced a week later by Henrik Axelsson of The Crown.

== Musical style and lyrical themes ==
Musically, the band started off with a traditional death metal sound on their early albums, but soon turned into a melodic death metal band. Their early lyrics – written by original vocalist Masse Broberg – dealt with anti-Christian themes and Satanism. The band later focused on themes such as the paranormal and extraterrestrials. Their tenth album, &quot;Virus&quot;, contains themes more typical of death metal such as violence, the horrors of reality, insanity, torture, war, drug addiction, and emotional strife. Their twelfth album, &quot;End of Disclosure&quot;, uses conspiracy and anti-Illuminati themes.

<doc id="523530" wikidata="Q5132944" url="?curid=523530" title="Clifford Forsythe">
<text>Clifford Forsythe (24 August 1929 – 27 April 2000) was an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Antrim from 1983 until his death in 2000.

==Early life==
Forsythe was born in Glengormley. He was a footballer with Derry City and Linfield Football Clubs. He won several footballing medals, and was described as a &#x27;fine, speedy winger&#x27;.

==Career==
He had previously been Mayor of Newtownabbey Borough Council, and was also a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly from 1982 to 1986. He also once served as the President of the Northern Ireland Institute of Plumbing.

Forsythe was the constituency election agent for Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux, and later won the same seat, albeit with a reduced majority, in 1983.

In his paper &quot;Quangopus Government&quot; published by the Ulster Unionist Party in June 1992, Forsythe – as the then UUP Spokesman on Local Government – argued for devolution of responsibility to locally elected representatives.

In 1996, Forsythe survived an attempt to deselect him as an MP.

==Political views==

Like Molyneaux, Forsythe opposed the Good Friday Agreement and supported proposals for a Northern Ireland-wide administrative assembly/regional council (with powers broadly analogous to the National Assembly for Wales) to administer legislation and public services that were, at that time, administered by Northern Ireland Office Ministers, civil servants and quangos.

On more than one occasion, Forsythe claimed that his experience – both in the 1982–86 Northern Ireland Assembly and as a Past Vice-Chairman of the Ulster Monday Club – led him to conclude that the unimplemented 1979 Conservative General Election Manifesto commitment to administrative devolution in Northern Ireland offered the way forward for Northern Ireland.

He was an active member of the House of Commons&#x27; Social Security Select Committee from 1991–1997, and the Environment, Transport and the Regions Select Committee from 1997 until his death in 2000.

Shortly before his death, Forsythe criticised the Government for its failure to tackle social security fraud by paramilitary groups.

He argued that air travel between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should be exempt from air passenger duty, on the basis that the tax unfairly disadvantaged Northern Ireland compared with the rest of the United Kingdom given the limited alternative means of travelling between Belfast and London.

==Personal life and death==
Forsythe, the father of five, was married twice; however, he was noted to be &quot;intensely private&quot; and did not discuss his personal life.

Forsythe died from complications of a heart attack and stroke at Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, on 27 April 2000, at the age of 70.

<text>David Maxim Triesman, Baron Triesman (born 30 October 1943) is a British politician, merchant banker and former trade union leader.

Triesman is a Labour member of the House of Lords. Triesman previously sat as a Labour peer until resigning the whip in July 2019, then having previously been a minister in the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He sat non-affiliated in the House of Lords until 2020 when he rejoined Labour. He was chairman of the Football Association from 2008 to 2010.

== Background==
Triesman (named Maxim after Maxim Gorky, the Russian author, whom his mother admired) was born into a North London Jewish community. He was the son of Michael Triesman, an advertising manager and wartime aircraft inspector of Belarusian and Latvian descent, and Rita Triesman (&quot;née&quot; Lubran) of French descent. His parents were active Communists.

Triesman was educated at the Stationers&#x27; Company&#x27;s School in London, before going to the University of Essex and subsequently King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

At Essex University, Triesman and a group of fellow students seized control declaring it a &#x27;free university&#x27;. He was subsequently suspended from Essex in 1968 after interrupting a meeting addressed by a defence industry scientist but readmitted after two weeks.

He is a Senior Network Member at the European Leadership Network (ELN).

==Business career==
Triesman has been involved in business in real estate, banking, publishing and fine art. He has served on the boards and advisory boards of several companies including chairing Victoria Management, the advisory board of UBS and Templewood Merchant Bank and some of its subsidiaries. He is an executive board member of the Salamanca Group and its subsidiaries, One Ocean Enterprises, Funding Affordable Homes (and its Housing Association).

==Politics and union career==
In 1959, aged 16, Triesman became a member of the Labour Party but eleven years later resigned and joined the Communist Party where he remained for six years, following which he rejoined the Labour Party. He is an ex-Maoist.

For a number of years, he was a lecturer and research director at South Bank Polytechnic (now London South Bank University) and held roles in the lecturers&#x27; union, NATFHE. Triesman became a full-time union official of NATFHE in 1984, with the post of National Negotiating Secretary. He was also General Secretary of the Association of University Teachers from 1993 until 2001.

He then was appointed as the General Secretary of the Labour Party from 2001 to December 2003, where a significant part of his job was to maintain the support of the trade unions who had become disillusioned with Tony Blair&#x27;s government.

He was created a Life Peer on 9 January 2004 taking the title &quot;Baron Triesman, of Tottenham in the London Borough of Haringey&quot;, prior to which he was elected a Visiting Fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge in 2000, for the study of economics and Higher Education. He has published a number of academic papers in economics and epidemiology. He is a senior visiting fellow at the University of Warwick and a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics. Triesman is a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society and the Royal Society of Arts. In 2015, he was awarded the Icebreaker Award by the Chinese Ambassador to the UK for services to Chinese-UK relations, including football.

He served as HM Opposition (Labour) Lords Shadow Spokesperson for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs from 2010 to 2014.

Triesman is a member of the Henry Jackson Society&#x27;s Political Council, and a member of the European Leadership Network Board and Top Level Group.

Triesman resigned from the Labour group in the House of Lords in July 2019 in protest at the party leadership&#x27;s behaviour and policies with regard to antisemitism in the party, Brexit and defence.

He rejoined the Labour Party in February 2020.

===Government office===
Under Tony Blair&#x27;s third Labour administration, Triesman served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with responsibility for relations with Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, Overseas Territories, the Commonwealth, UK visas, migration policy working directly to the prime minister, consular policy, the British Council, the BBC World Service and the Chevening Scholarships Scheme. During this period, he conducted negotiations with Iran to secure the release of a group of British naval and marine personnel who had been taken prisoner in the Upper Persian Gulf. In the reshuffle of 29 June 2007, he was moved to the newly created post of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. In this role, he had responsibility for quality in higher education, innovation and intellectual property and future planning. In 2004, he was appointed as a Lord in Waiting. He is a member of the European Affairs External Affairs Select Committee. He is chairman of the Design Commission. He is co-chairman of the All Party St Lucia Group and a member of the All Party China and Chinese in Britain Group.

==Football administration==
A longtime fan of Tottenham Hotspur and patron of the club&#x27;s charitable Foundation, Triesman became the first independent Chairman of the Football Association in January 2008. He resigned in May 2010. Triesman was a board member at Wembley National Stadium, the Premier League shareholders&#x27; meeting, the Football Foundation, and is a qualified senior football referee.

In February 2011 he testified before a parliamentary committee on the state of the administration of English football. He was heavily critical of the FA, saying it was shying away from governing the game. He was especially damning of the FA&#x27;s administrative procedures and its working relationship with other football bodies, in particular the Premier League.

==Comments about FIFA bribery allegations==
On 16 May 2010, the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; revealed Lord Triesman made comments about alleged bribery attempts by Spain and Russia of referees in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Triesman asserted, &quot;there’s some evidence that the Spanish football authorities are trying to identify the referees ... and pay them.&quot; It was announced that he was to &#x27;quit&#x27; both the FA and England&#x27;s 2018 bid.
On 10 May 2011, Triesman, speaking before a British parliamentary select committee, affirmed his suspicions of bribery concerning four FIFA members, claiming that they sought bribes in return for backing England&#x27;s failed 2018 World Cup bid. Whilst the FIFA Executive Committee dismissed the allegations, all the FIFA officials named have subsequently been either convicted of offences, or face extradition to the US for trial. They with other FIFA executives have been banned for different periods from all contact with football.

==Personal life==
Triesman spent many years in a relationship with the writer and critic Michelene Wandor until they split up in the late 1990s. He married Lucy Hooberman in 2004 and has an adopted daughter.

<doc id="523533" wikidata="Q375351" url="?curid=523533" title="Charles-Eugène Delaunay">
<text>Charles-Eugène Delaunay (; 9 April 1816 – 5 August 1872) was a French astronomer and mathematician. His lunar motion studies were important in advancing both the theory of planetary motion and mathematics.

==Life==
Born in Lusigny-sur-Barse, France, to Jacques-Hubert Delaunay and Catherine Choiselat, Delaunay studied under Jean-Baptiste Biot at the Sorbonne. He worked on the mechanics of the Moon as a special case of the three-body problem. He published two volumes on the topic, each of 900 pages in length, in 1860 and 1867. The work hints at chaos in the system, and clearly demonstrates the problem of so-called &quot;small denominators&quot; in perturbation theory. His infinite series expression for finding the position of the Moon converged too slowly to be of practical use but was a catalyst in the development of functional analysis and computer algebra.

Delaunay became director of the Paris Observatory in 1870 but drowned in a boating accident near Cherbourg, France, two years later. He was followed by Jean Claude Bouquet at the Academy. Peter Guthrie Tait in his book &quot;An Elementary Treatise on Quaternions&quot; edition 1867 on page 244 named Didonia in honour of Delaunay.

==Honours==
*Member of the &quot;Académie des Sciences&quot;, (1855)
*Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, (1870)
*His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

<doc id="523537" wikidata="Q981195" url="?curid=523537" title="Royal Central School of Speech and Drama">
<text>The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, commonly shortened to Central, is a drama school founded by Elsie Fogerty in 1906, as the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, to offer a new form of training in speech and drama for young actors and other students. It became a constituent college of the University of London in 2005 and is a member of Conservatoires UK and the Federation of Drama Schools.

==Courses==
The school offers undergraduate, postgraduate, research degrees and short courses in acting, actor training, applied theatre, theatre crafts and making, design, drama therapy, movement, musical theatre, performance, producing, research, scenography, stage management, teacher training, technical arts, voice and writing.

==History==

In 2006, the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art was absorbed into Central.

On 29 November 2012, the &#x27;Royal&#x27; title was bestowed on the school by Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of its reputation as a &quot;world-class institution for exceptional professional training in theatre and performance studies&quot;. It is entitled to use it in official documentation, although it continues to be colloquially referred to as &quot;Central&quot;. The school&#x27;s Patron, Princess Alexandra of Kent, played a role in recommending the institution for the title.

==Buildings==
The school is located at Swiss Cottage in north London, an area which is being redeveloped as a &quot;civic and cultural quarter&quot; which includes a new extension building for the school, replacing 1960s accommodation. The school&#x27;s theatre is located inside the new building, which was awarded a BREEAM rating of &quot;very good&quot;.

==Administration==

Past presidents of the school include Laurence Olivier, Peggy Ashcroft and Judi Dench. In October 2008 Harold Pinter, who attended the school in 1950–51, became its president, succeeding Peter Mandelson. He was to receive an honorary fellowship in December 2008, but had to receive it &quot;in absentia&quot; because of ill health; he died two weeks later. Michael Grandage was president from 2009 to 2022. Theatre producer and Central graduate Sonia Friedman was appointed after Grandage stepped down from the role.

===Former presidents===
* Laurence Olivier (1983 to 1989)
* Peggy Ashcroft (1989 to 1992)
* Judi Dench (1992 to 1997)
* Peter Mandelson (2001 to 2008)
* Harold Pinter (2008)
* Michael Grandage (2009 to 2022)

== Research ==
In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise the majority of Central&#x27;s submission was judged &quot;world leading&quot; or &quot;internationally excellent&quot;. The school has been ranked sixth in its league of specialist institutions by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and ninth for drama and dance.

The school has over 20 doctoral candidates. The first PhD was awarded in 2010.

<doc id="523539" wikidata="Q16104546" url="?curid=523539" title="William Ross (Unionist politician)">
<text>William Ross (born 4 February 1936) is a Northern Irish unionist politician, serving as President of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) since 2008. He served as the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Member of Parliament (MP) for Londonderry (later East Londonderry) from February 1974 until 2001. He was one of the UUP members opposed to the Good Friday Agreement.

==Career==
For some years he was a member of the Conservative Monday Club (which followed the Tory tradition of being Conservative &quot;and&quot; Unionist). In September 1982 he was chairman of the club&#x27;s Northern Ireland Committee when it published a Policy Paper entitled &quot;Proposals for a Constitutional Settlement&quot; [for Ulster].

As Chief Whip of the Ulster Unionist Parliamentary Party from 1987 to 1995, in an attempt to derail multi-party talks initiated by then-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Brooke, in February 1990 Ross unsuccessfully introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill, the Northern Ireland Act 1974 (Amendment) Bill, to provide that laws for Northern Ireland may not be made by (non-amendable) Orders-in-Council but by (amendable) Bills introduced into the United Kingdom Parliament, and repeatedly called on the then Conservative Government to implement its 1979 Conservative General Election Manifesto commitment to &quot;establish one or more elected regional councils with a wide range of powers over local services&quot; (in Northern Ireland), which had been drafted by the then UUP Leader Jim Molyneaux and adopted by Airey Neave then-Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in 1978.

Following Molyneaux&#x27;s retirement as UUP Leader, Ross unsuccessfully stood for the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party in September 1995 and, although a close confidant and supporter of Molyneaux throughout the latter&#x27;s leadership of the UUP, quickly became a very vocal opponent of the policies and style of newly elected UUP Leader David Trimble.

In June 2008, it was announced that he had been made the party president of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV).

William Ross stood for the TUV in the 2010 UK General Election in the East Londonderry constituency.

<doc id="523544" wikidata="Q1700483" url="?curid=523544" title="John Home Robertson">
<text>John David Home Robertson (born 5 December 1948) is a retired Labour politician in Scotland. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Berwick and East Lothian and East Lothian from 1978 to 2001 and a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for East Lothian from 1999 until 2007.

==Background==
John David Home Robertson was born at 18 Eglinton Crescent, Edinburgh, the son of John Wallace Robertson, Lieutenant-Colonel of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers regiment, who assumed the additional surname in 1933, by Scottish Licence, of Home following his marriage that year to Helen Margaret (1905–1987), elder daughter and heiress of David William Milne-Home (1873–1918), of Wedderburn &amp; Paxton, Berwickshire.

He was educated at Farleigh School, Ampleforth College and at the West of Scotland Agricultural College. In 1988, Home Robertson placed his maternal family&#x27;s historic home and grounds, Paxton House, in a Historic Buildings Preservation Trust, and opened it to the public. It is a Partner Gallery of the National Galleries of Scotland.

==Political career==

Home Robertson was an Independent member of Berwickshire District Council from 1974 to 1978, representing Burnmouth, Foulden and Hutton ward. Following the 1977 local government elections, he was the only non-Conservative member still remaining on the Council. He also sat on the Borders NHS Health Board from 1976 to 1978, and was Chairman of the Eastern Borders Citizens Advice Bureau in 1977.

Although elected as a non-partisan councillor, Home Robertson was at the time a Labour Party activist, and as a delegate to the Party&#x27;s Annual Conference in 1976 he moved the resolution which committed it to supporting devolution for Scotland. Throughout his career at Westminster he continued to campaign for the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, conscious of the fact that one of his forebears was a Member of the (original) Parliament of Scotland, for Berwickshire, who in 1707 had opposed the Act of Union.

Home Robertson was the successful Labour candidate at the Berwick and East Lothian by-election in 1978, following the death of Labour MP John Mackintosh. He represented Berwick and East Lothian until the 1983 general election, when the constituency was abolished and he was elected for the new constituency of East Lothian. He was re-elected at subsequent general elections before standing down in 2001, when he was replaced by Anne Picking.

At Westminster, Home Robertson served on the Scottish Affairs (1979–83) and Defence (1990–97) select committees, and was Chairman of the Scottish Group of Labour MPs from 1982 to 1983. He spent time as Opposition Scottish Whip (1983–84), and as Labour&#x27;s Opposition Front Bench Spokesman on Agriculture (1984–87), Scottish Affairs (1987–88), and Agricultural and Rural Affairs (1988–90). A Europhile, he was one of only five Labour MPs to vote for the Third Reading of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, defying his party Whip, which was to abstain.

Following Labour&#x27;s victory at the 1997 general election, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Jack Cunningham at the Ministry of Agriculture and then at the Cabinet Office, where he remained until he was elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for East Lothian at the first Scottish parliamentary election in 1999. Having left Westminster in 2001, he announced that he would stand down from the Scottish Parliament in 2007, and was succeeded as MSP for East Lothian by Iain Gray.

Boyce commanded three submarines and then a frigate before achieving higher command in the Navy and serving as First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff from 1998 to 2001 and then as Chief of the Defence Staff from 2001 to 2003. As Chief of Defence Staff he is believed to have had concerns about US plans for a national missile defence system. In early 2003 he advised the British Government on the deployment of troops for the invasion of Iraq, seeking assurances as to the legitimacy of the deployment before it was allowed to proceed.

He joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1961 and, having trained as a submariner, was confirmed in the rank of sub-lieutenant on 10 December 1965, promoted to lieutenant on 30 August 1966, and saw service in the submarines , and . He completed the Submarine Command Course in 1973, became commanding officer of the submarine in the same year and, having been promoted to lieutenant commander on 8 January 1974, was given command of the submarine later that year.

Promoted to the rank of commander on 30 June 1976, Boyce became commanding officer of the submarine in 1979. He was posted to the Directorate of Naval Plans at the Ministry of Defence in 1981 and appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1982 Birthday Honours, before being promoted to captain on 30 June 1982. He was given command of the frigate in January 1983, and returned to the Ministry of Defence as captain, Submarine Sea Training in 1984. He attended the Royal College of Defence Studies in 1988 and then became Senior Naval Officer in the Middle East in 1989. He went on to be Director of Naval Staff Duties at the Ministry of Defence in August 1989. Following promotion to rear admiral, he became Flag Officer Sea Training in July 1991. He became Flag Officer, Surface Flotilla and NATO Commander of the Anti-Submarine Warfare Striking Force in November 1992.

Promoted to vice admiral in February 1994, Boyce was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1995 New Year Honours. He was promoted to full admiral on 25 May 1995, on appointment as Second Sea Lord and Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command, and went on to be Commander-in-Chief Fleet as well as NATO Commander-in-Chief Eastern Atlantic and NATO Commander Allied Naval Forces North West Europe in September 1997.

Boyce became First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff in October 1998 and was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1999 Birthday Honours. He was appointed Chief of the Defence Staff in February 2001, and in that role is believed to have had concerns about US plans for a national missile defence system. In early 2003 he advised the British Government on the deployment of troops for the invasion of Iraq, seeking assurances as to the legitimacy of the deployment before it was allowed to proceed. He was appointed a Knight of Justice of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem on 27 November 2002, and retired as Chief of Defence Staff on 7 November 2003.

==Later career==
Boyce was created a life peer as Baron Boyce, of Pimlico in the City of Westminster, on 16 June 2003 and was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Greater London on 19 December 2003. He was also appointed a non-executive director of WS Atkins plc in May 2004 and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports on 10 December 2004, succeeding Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in that role. He became chairman of the Royal Navy Club of 1765 &amp; 1785 (United 1889) in 2004.

In May 2005, Boyce was among the several retired Chiefs of Defence Staff who spoke in the House of Lords about the risk to servicemen facing liability for their actions – for which he claims politicians are ultimately responsible – before the International Criminal Court. He gave evidence to The Iraq Inquiry on 3 December 2009. He was created a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter in April 2011 and was a member of the Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation.

Boyce was Patron of the Submariners Association, Dover College, the Dover War Memorial Project and of Kent Search and Rescue as well as being an Elder Brother of Trinity House and Chairman of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. He took a keen interest in sports. In 2013, he was elected Master of the Drapers&#x27; Company. He has been the president of the Pilgrims Society, the Royal Navy Submarine Museum and Hastings charity, the Winkle Club, as well as a trustee of the Naval and Military Club.

Boyce was appointed an honorary admiral of the fleet in the Queen&#x27;s 2014 Birthday Honours.

On 6 December 2021, Boyce was appointed Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom.

==Personal life and death==
In 1971, Boyce married Harriette Gail Fletcher, with whom he had one son and one daughter. Following the dissolution of his first marriage, he married Fleur Margaret Anne Rutherford (née Smith). Lady Boyce died in 2016 at the age of 67. 

Boyce died from cancer on 6 November 2022, at the age of 79.

A service of thanksgiving was held at Westminster Abbey on 13 July 2023. Sir Graham Boyce, brother, Admiral Sir George Zambellas and Colonel Oliver Lee paid tribute.

<doc id="523549" wikidata="Q5971298" url="?curid=523549" title="John Madejski">
<text>Sir John Robert Madejski, (; born Robert John Hurst; 28 April 1941) is an English businessman, with commercial interests spanning property, broadcast media, hotels, restaurants, publishing and football.

Madejski is the founder of the magazine which became &quot;Auto Trader&quot; and was chairman of Reading F.C., Chancellor of the University of Reading and a Deputy Lieutenant of Berkshire. He is a benefactor to many institutions, especially in academia, education and the arts. In the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2009&quot; ranking of the wealthiest people in the UK he was placed 222nd with an estimated fortune of £250 million.

==Personal life==
Madejski was born Robert John Hurst on 28 April 1941, in Stoke-on-Trent, as a result of a wartime fling, being initially placed with a foster family. While still a baby, Hurst was moved back to his mother&#x27;s home town of Reading and placed in a children&#x27;s home. His mother later married a Second World War airman, Zygmunt Madejski, with Hurst eventually coming to live with them and adopting his stepfather&#x27;s surname of Madejski. Hurst&#x27;s biological father had started another family.

Madejski has two daughters, but has never married. He made front-page headlines in UK tabloid newspapers in October 2004 due to his alleged romantic attachment with singer and TV star Cilla Black. The pair became friends due to their mutual affiliation with the Conservative Party. 

He owns a large number of luxury cars, including two Rolls-Royces, two Bentleys, four Jaguars, an AC Cobra and two Ferraris, including a red 328 which is kept in a glass case at his home.

==Career==
While on holiday in the US in the mid-1970s, Madejski saw a car sales magazine that included pictures of the vehicles on sale. He immediately realised the potential of the idea and with the help of his business partners Paul Gibbons and Peter Taylor founded &quot;Thames Valley Trader&quot; in 1976. Initially the magazine advertised a range of items, from houses to cars and aircraft, but it soon concentrated on vehicles and was renamed &quot;Auto Trader&quot;. Madejski partnered with the Guardian Media Group in 1982 to give the title national exposure.

By 1998, 52 titles were being published with a combined circulation of more than 700,000. In 1998, he sold his company Hurst Publishing for £174 million.

===Reading F.C.===
Madejski became chairman of the Football League club Reading F.C. in 1990, and has given his name to the club&#x27;s Madejski Stadium, built in 1998 with £25 million largely contributed by him. He rescued Reading from receivership. He said &quot;When Robert Maxwell was alive I offered him five pounds a share. When he fell off his boat I got them for 10p. Funny old life isn&#x27;t it?&quot;. In 2006, he led the club to the top tier of English football for the first time in its 135-year history and proposed to expand the stadium to 38,000 seats. After Premier League promotion, Madejski said he was ready to sell up:The brand is getting stronger all the time and if there is a billionaire who wants a nice accessory down the M4 then come and talk to me. Apart from Manchester United, unless you&#x27;ve got a sugar daddy with really deep pockets, you&#x27;re wasting your time. The club achieved pre-tax profits of £6.6 million during the tax year ending in June 2007.

On 21 January 2012 it was announced that Madejski planned to relinquish control of the club by selling a 51% stake for £40 million to Thames Sports Investments, a Russian consortium headed by Anton Zingarevich. Madejski announced that as part of the deal he would continue as chairman for at least another two years, followed by becoming honorary life president. Madejski&#x27;s ownership of the club ended on 29 May 2012 when the takeover deal was completed.

==Charitable activities==

In 1990, Madejski donated £500,000 to the trustees of the Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel Trust. The donation was crucial to the fund-raising effort and enabled the trustees to build the War Memorial Chapel, dedicated to the 255 fallen of the Falkland Islands War: it is situated in the grounds of Pangbourne College and was opened by the Queen in 2000.

He is also a benefactor to the Royal Academy of Arts in Piccadilly, London and in 2004 had the &quot;John Madejski Fine Rooms&quot; at Burlington House named after him in recognition of a contribution of £3 million to the institution. A sculpture by Edgar Degas, &quot;La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans&quot;, that he purchased at Sotheby&#x27;s in 2004 was on display in the John Madejski Fine Rooms; it was sold in February 2009 for £13.3 million.

The &quot;John Madejski Centre for Reputation&quot; at Henley Management College, the new garden at the Victoria and Albert Museum, a lecture theatre at the University of Reading and a gallery at the Museum of Reading also bear his name. The John Madejski Academy (formerly Thamesbridge College) has been found to be &quot;inadequate&quot; twice by the regulator Ofsted, and &quot;requires improvement&quot; three times.

Madejski has said he is not particularly concerned about how this might appear, adding &quot;People can think what they like about me. I don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s never been a popularity contest. I do it all for the community. In my view, you start life with nothing and you end it with nothing. I&#x27;d like to enjoy it all before I kick the bucket.&quot; His most recent project was a £500m redevelopment of Reading town centre, but this has been halted by the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

==Political activities==
In the early 2000s, Madejski was active in politics: he contributed extensively to the Conservative Party. Madejski and Dave Whelan called for football clubs to observe a minute&#x27;s silence to mark the death of Margaret Thatcher.

==Honours==
*In 2000, Madejski was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2000 Birthday Honours &quot;for services to Reading Football Club and the community in Reading, Berkshire.&quot; He is also Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire.
*In 2006, he was admitted as a Freeman of the Borough &quot;in recognition of the distinguished service rendered to the Borough of Reading, by his contribution to the growth and success of football in Reading, and by his support for education and arts&quot;.
*On 14 December 2007, Madejski was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters University of Reading and formally installed as the seventh chancellor of the university, succeeding to the post on the retirement of Lord Carrington.
*Madejski was knighted in the 2009 New Year Honours for charitable services.

<doc id="523554" wikidata="Q2073057" url="?curid=523554" title="Calligra Stage">
<text>Calligra Stage (formerly &quot;KPresenter&quot;) is a free presentation program that is part of the Calligra Suite, an integrated office suite developed by KDE.

Calligra Stage&#x27;s native export format is OpenDocument. Stage is able to load presentation documents from Microsoft PowerPoint, LibreOffice Impress and OpenOffice Impress.

In 2014, development of Calligra Gemini with official support for Windows was announced.

== History ==
=== As KPresenter ===
Reginald Stadlbauer began development of KPresenter in 1997. The first official release of the KOffice suite was on October 23, 2000 when it was released as part of K Desktop Environment 2.0. Versions 1.1 followed in 2001, 1.2 in 2002, 1.3 in 2004, 1.4 in 2005, and 1.5 and 1.6 both in 2006.

KOffice underwent a major transition as part of the release of KDE Software Compilation 4 (&quot;SC4&quot;). Coinciding with the work on SC4, the KOffice team prepared a major new release – KOffice 2.0 – which used the new KDE Platform 4 libraries. Although version 2.0 was released in 2009, the release was labeled as a “platform release” which was recommended only for testers and developers, rather than production use, since the release was missing key features and applications from the previous stable release series.

This continued with version 2.1 in November, 2009. Regular end-users requiring a stable environment were still recommended by developers to use the stable 1.6 release series. This version was also ported to Haiku but the port was later not updated for newer KOffice versions.

In May 2010, version 2.2.0 was released and brought many new features and bugfixes. Kexi was integrated again. Kivio has not yet been migrated. A new framework for effects on shapes and a new import filters for the Microsoft Office Open XML formats that are used in MS Office 2007 and later got added.
In mid-2010, following disagreements between KWord’s maintainer Thomas Zander and the other core developers, KPresenter was renamed Calligra Stage. The KWord maintainer forked the KPresenter presentation tool to create KOffice Showcase.

KOffice 2.3, released 31 December 2010, along with subsequent bugfix releases (2.3.1–2.3.3) was still a collaborative effort of both the KOffice and Calligra development teams.

KOffice Showcase 2.4 never materialized in release form. KOffice was declared unmaintained by KDE.

=== As Calligra Stage ===

On 18 May 2011 the Calligra team began releasing monthly snapshots while preparing for the release of Calligra 2.4.

The first version of the Calligra Suite for Windows was released on 21 December 2011. The package is labeled as “highly experimental” and “not yet suitable for daily use”.

The Calligra team originally scheduled to release the final 2.4 version in January 2012 but problems in the undo/redo feature of Words and Stage required a partial rewrite and caused a delay. Calligra 2.4 was released on 11 April 2012.

Calligra 2.4 launched with two mobile-oriented user interfaces: Calligra Mobile and Calligra Active. Calligra Mobile&#x27;s development was initiated in summer 2009 and first shown during Akademy / Desktop Summit 2009 by KO GmbH as a simple port of KOffice to Maemo. Later Nokia hired KO to assist them with a full-fledged mobile version, including a touchscreen-friendly user interface which was presented by Nokia during Maemo Conference in October 2009. The first alpha version was made available in January 2010. Along with the launch of the Nokia N9 smartphone, Nokia released its own Poppler and Calligra-based office document viewer under GPL.

&quot;Calligra Active&quot; was launched in 2011 after the Plasma Active initiative to provide a document viewer similar to &quot;Calligra Mobile&quot; but for tablet computers.

Jolla continued Nokia&#x27;s efforts on a smartphone version. In 2013 Jolla launched Sailfish Office. Sailfish Office reuses the Qt Quick components from Calligra Active.

In September 2013 a merger of Krita and Krita Sketch, named Krita Gemini, was launched on Windows 8.1. Development was funded by Intel to promote &quot;2in1&quot; convertible notebooks.

In April 2014 Intel and KO GmbH extended the promotion deal to Gemini versions of Stage and Words. On 28 August 2014 the first snapshot of Calligra Gemini was released by KO GmbH for Windows. On 21 November 2014 KDE announced that Calligra Gemini would officially be released as part of Calligra 2.9. As with Krita, this Gemini release adds a touchscreen interface to Words and Stage and users can switch between desktop and touch mode at runtime. Calligra Gemini is a continuation of Calligra Active and Sailfish Office developments but with added editing capabilities. On 19 October 2014 a Linux version was presented.

<text>Claude-Henri de Fusée, abbé de Voisenon (8 July 1708 – 22 November 1775) was a French playwright and writer.

==Life==
Born at the château de Voisenon near Melun, he was only ten when he addressed an epistle in verse to Voltaire, who asked the boy to visit him. They remained friends for fifty years. Voisenon made his début as a dramatist with &quot;L&#x27;Heureuse resemblance&quot; in 1728, followed in 1739 by a three-act comedy &quot;L&#x27;École du monde&quot; at the Théâtre Français. This was preceded by a verse prologue, &quot;L&#x27;Ombre de Molière&quot;, and a month later Voisenon produced a criticism of his own piece in &quot;Le Retour de l&#x27;ombre de Molière&quot;.

A duel provoked by Voisenon inspired him with remorse, and he entered a seminary; he was soon promoted to the post of secretary to his relative, the Bishop of Boulogne. He became closely attached to Madame du Châtelet, the mistress of Voltaire, and was intimate with the comte de Caylus and Mademoiselle Jeanne Quinault. He made witty but by no means edifying contributions to the &quot;Étrennes de Saint-Jean&quot;, the &quot;Bals de Bois&quot;, etc.

In 1744, he produced the &quot;Ménages assortis&quot; and in 1746 his masterpiece, the &quot;Coquette fixée&quot;. He was a close friend of Charles Simon Favart and his wife. His pen was always at the service of any of his friends, and it was generally supposed that he had a considerable share in Favart&#x27;s most successful operas. Voisenon had scruples all his life about the incongruity between his way of living and his profession, but he continued to write indecent stories for private circulation, and wrote verses in honor of Madame du Barry, as he had done for Madame de Pompadour.

He was elected to the Académie française in 1762. On the disgrace of his patron, the duc de Choiseul, he lost his pensions and honours, but soon recovered his position. He was intimate with the chancellor Maupeou, and was suspected of writing on his behalf in defence of the abolition of the &quot;parlement&quot;. This and some other incidents brought him into general disgrace. Early in 1775 he retired to the château de Voisenon, where he died.

== Works ==
His &quot;Œuvres complètes&quot; were published by his executrix, :fr:Constance de Lowendal, 5 vol. in-8°. in 1781.

<text>Thomas Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough, (8 February 1815 – 17 May 1886) was a British constitutional theorist and Clerk of the House of Commons during the Victorian era.

His seminal work, &quot;A Treatise upon the Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament&quot; (first published in 1844) has become known as &quot;Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice&quot; or simply &quot;Erskine May&quot;: this parliamentary authority (book of procedural rules) is currently in its 25th revised edition (2019) and is informally considered part of the constitution of the United Kingdom.

Following his retirement as Clerk of the House of Commons in May 1886, May was created &quot;Baron Farnborough, of Farnborough, in the county of Southampton&quot; just a week before his death. Since he left no heirs, the barony became extinct, making it the second-shortest-lived peerage in British history.

==Biography==
Thomas Erskine May was born in Highgate, Middlesex, on 8 February 1815. He was christened on 21 September 1815 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster with his parents being registered as Thomas and Sarah May. He was educated at Bedford School.

May began his parliamentary service in 1831, at the age of 16, as Assistant Librarian in the House of Commons Library. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 20 June 1834 and called to the bar on 4 May 1838. May married Johanna Laughton, of Fareham, on 27 August 1839. May became examiner of petitions for private bills in 1846 and from 1847 to 1856 was Taxing Master for both Houses of Parliament. In 1856 he became Clerk Assistant of the House of Commons.

May was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 16 May 1860 and promoted to Knight Commander (KCB) on 6 July 1866. On 16 February 1871, he was appointed Clerk of the House of Commons by letters patent.

In 1873, he was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple and awarded an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law by the University of Oxford in 1874. In 1880, he was made a Reader of the Middle Temple and sworn of the Privy Council in 1884.

On 10 May 1886, shortly after his retirement as Clerk of the House of Commons, May was created &quot;Baron Farnborough, of Farnborough, in the county of Southampton&quot;. He died just a week later on 17 May 1886. Since he left no heirs, the barony became extinct, making it the second-shortest-lived peerage in British history, after the Barony of Leighton.

Sir William McKay, who edited Erskine May&#x27;s private journal, has suggested that May was possibly an unacknowledged son or grandson of The 1st Baron Erskine.

==Notable works==
May&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;A Treatise upon the Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament&quot; (now popularly known as &quot;Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice&quot; or simply &quot;Erskine May&quot;), was first published in 1844. The book is currently in its 25th edition (2019). It is informally considered part of the constitution of the United Kingdom. The guide is authoritative in many Commonwealth nations, often with strong influence on constitutional convention.

Another notable work is &quot;The Constitutional History of England since the Accession of George III, 1760–1860&quot;. May&#x27;s work was disputed by some later historians, such as Herbert Butterfield who wrote, &quot;Erskine May must be a good example of the way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance. His capacity for synthesis, and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence ... carried him into a more profound and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors ... he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which, granted his original aberrations, was calculated to project the lines of his error, carrying his work still further from centrality or truth.&quot;

<doc id="523572" wikidata="Q6261066" url="?curid=523572" title="John Townend">
<text>John Ernest Townend (12 June 1934 – 18 August 2018) was a British politician who was a Member of Parliament for the Conservative Party.

==Early years==
The son of Charles Hope and Dorothy Townend, he was born on 12 June 1934 in Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, and educated at Hymers College in Hull. He studied accountancy from 1951 to 1957 as an articled clerk, and received the Plender Prize for the top prize when he became a Chartered Accountant. He then served in the Royal Air Force as a commissioned Pilot Officer from 1957 to 1959. In the latter year, he joined his family business as commercial secretary and finance director, becoming managing director (1961–1979) and then chairman of House of Townend wine merchants in Hull. He was Chairman of the Yorkshire and Humberside Wine and Spirit Merchants&#x27; Association (1975–76). In 1977, he became an Underwriter at Lloyds.

==Politics==
Townend was active in local politics and unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary seat of Hull North at the 1970 general election. He was then elected to Humberside County Council in 1973, becoming the Leader of the Conservative Group and shadow chairman of the policy committee. He also became a member of the Conservative National Advisory Committee on local Government. He subsequently became leader of the county council, chairman of its policy committee, and member of the policy committee of the Association of County Councils, 1977.&quot; He was a member of Hull City Council from 1966 to 1974.

At the 1979 general election, Townend was elected as the Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire, a seat which he held until his retirement in 2001. He served as secretary of the Conservative Back-bench finance committee and was a member of the Select Committee on Treasury and Civil Service affairs and vice-chairman of the Back-bench finance committee. He was also principal private secretary to Hugh Rossi, the Minister of Pensions and the Disabled. He became chairman of the Small Businesses Committee, a Fellow of the Industry and Parliament Trust, and a member of the executive committee of IPU. His main interests while in Parliament were Treasury and taxation, small businesses, employment, and Southern Africa.

==Views on immigration==
Townend was renowned for his outspoken views on race and immigration. In 1984, he suggested that foreigners employed in industries should be replaced by unemployed Britons, and in 1989 he stated that &quot;England must be reconquered for the English. They (Muslims opposed to Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;Satanic Verses&quot;) should go back from whence they came.&quot; In 2001, shortly before his retirement as an MP, he became engulfed in a row within the Conservative Party when, referring to a statement by Foreign Secretary Robin Cook that there was no such thing as a British race, he said that his constituents in Bridlington would not agree, and asked whether Cook therefore thought instead that the British were a &quot;mongrel race&quot;. He was chairman of the right-wing 92 Group.

== Personal life ==
Townend married Jennifer Ann Lawson in 1963. The couple had two sons and two daughters. Outside politics, he listed his recreations as swimming and tennis. He lived in Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire, and was a member of the Conservative-affiliated Carlton Club.

He died on 18 August 2018, aged 84.

<doc id="523574" wikidata="Q334137" url="?curid=523574" title="Donald Gorrie">
<text>Donald Cameron Easterbrook Gorrie OBE (2 April 1933 – 25 August 2012) was a Scottish Liberal Democrat politician. He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Central Scotland region from 1999 to 2007, and sat in the British House of Commons as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Edinburgh West from 1997 to 2001.

==Early and personal life==
Gorrie was educated at the independent Oundle School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he read classics and modern history. A former athlete, he held the Scottish record for the 880 yards in his youth. He won the 880 yards and mile run at the 1957 Canadian Track and Field Championships. He was married to Astrid and had two sons and a number of grandchildren.

His son Robert Gorrie was a Liberal Democrat councillor in Haringey, London, 2006–2014 and was Leader of the Opposition 2008–2011. He also stood for the Scottish Parliament seat of Airdrie and Shotts in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election.

==Early career==
After starting his professional career as a schoolteacher, he was Secretary of the Scottish Liberal Party, before becoming an Edinburgh City councillor in 1971. He remained a member of Edinburgh Council until its dissolution in 1976, when he became a member of Lothian Regional Council 1976–96, Edinburgh District Council 1978–96 and the new Edinburgh City Council 1995–97. During this time he stood for election to Westminster in the Edinburgh West constituency four times before finally winning it and becoming the area&#x27;s MP in 1997.

==Scottish Parliament==
Gorrie&#x27;s &quot;lifelong passion&quot; in politics was to see the establishment of a Scottish Parliament, and to sit as a Member of it. So when the Scottish Parliament was established by the referendum of 1997, he announced he would retire from the House of Commons after just one term as an MP to stand for the new Scottish Parliament. He was duly elected in 1999 as Liberal Democrat MSP for the Central Scotland region, and thus retired from Westminster at the following general election in 2001.

==Opponents==
A feisty and independent-minded politician, he was always fiercely loyal to his liberal instincts, and had a particular mistrust of the Labour Party, which he saw as centralist and corrupt. He was firmly on the radical left of the Liberal Democrats, believing in full-scale political reform and significant increases in spending on public services. This put him at odds with the more centrist party leadership at the time, and he was often seen as a renegade member of the &#x27;awkward squad,&#x27; for example in his implacable opposition to the coalition with the Labour Party formed after the 1999 elections (he was one of only three of his party&#x27;s MSPs to vote against it).

Gorrie disliked his characterisation as a rebel, pointing to the fact that (unlike the pro-coalition MSPs) he was merely sticking to the Liberal Democrats&#x27; manifesto commitments.

==Second term==
As time passed, and particularly after he was re-elected for a second term as MSP in 2003, he mellowed, however, and–confined to the backbenches with no hope of ministerial appointment–he concentrated on campaigning on a number of particular themes which interested him. His boldness and eye for publicity endeared him to a media corps that was often starved of stories by the cautious and tightly-controlled party machines that operated at Holyrood, and he became associated with a number of individual causes, like the spiralling cost and mismanagement of the Holyrood building project, and later his campaign against the sectarianism that plagued Scottish society. Though controversial at first, this latter campaign raised the profile of the issue until eventually it was taken up by First Minister Jack McConnell, who instigated a series of legislative attempts to deal with the issue.

Disliked by some (mainly those in what he would term &#x27;the establishment&#x27;) for the uncompromising stances he has taken, Gorrie was nevertheless said to be widely respected for his consistency of principle and his long record of service to liberal politics and public life in general. He retired from the Scottish Parliament at the 2007 elections. He upset the Liberal Democrat leadership during that campaign by saying that the party should &#x27;never say never&#x27; to an independence referendum, as that would consign them to another coalition with the Labour Party.

<text>MS &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot; was a roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ferry which capsized moments after leaving the Belgian port of Zeebrugge on the night of 6 March 1987, killing 193 passengers and crew.

The eight-deck car and passenger ferry was owned by Townsend Thoresen, designed for rapid loading and unloading on the competitive cross-channel route between Dover and Calais. As was common at the time, it was built with no watertight compartments. The ship left harbour with her bow door open, and the sea immediately flooded the decks; within minutes, she was lying on her side in shallow water. The immediate cause of the capsizing was found to be negligence by the assistant boatswain, who was asleep in his cabin when he should have been closing the bow door. The official inquiry however, placed more blame on his supervisors and a general culture of poor communication in Townsend Thoresen. The vessel was salvaged, put up for sale, and sold to Naviera SA Kingstown on 30 September 1987, renamed &quot;Flushing Range&quot;. It was taken to Taiwan on 22 March 1988 to be scrapped.

Since the disaster, improvements have been made to the design of RORO vessels, with watertight ramps, indicators showing the position of the bow doors, and the banning of undivided decks.

== Design and construction ==
In the late 1970s, Townsend Thoresen commissioned the design and construction of three new identical ships for its Dover–Calais route for delivery from 1980. The ships were branded the &quot;Spirit&quot;-class, and were named: &quot;Spirit of Free Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot;, and &quot;Pride of Free Enterprise&quot;. The name &quot;Free Enterprise&quot; dates from Townsend Car Ferries&#x27; pioneering private sector roll-on/roll-off ferries, introduced in 1962. &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot; began active service on 29 May 1980.

To remain competitive with other ferry operators on the route, Townsend Thoresen required ships designed to permit fast loading and unloading and quick acceleration. The ships comprised eight decks numbered A to H from top to bottom, which contained the following:
* A-deck: crew accommodation and radio room
* Half deck (between A and B decks) wheelhouse (bridge)
* B-deck: passenger areas, crew accommodation and galley
* C-deck: passenger areas and galley
* D-deck: suspended vehicle deck within E deck
* E-deck: upper vehicle deck
* F-deck: crew accommodation (port and starboard)
* G-deck: main vehicle deck
* H-deck: engine rooms, stores and passenger accommodation at the forward end.

Loading of vehicles onto G deck was through watertight doors at the bow and stern. The wheelhouse was positioned at the forward end, and the ship had clam shell doors rather than raising a visor door, making it difficult to see the bow doors. Loading of vehicles onto E deck and D deck was through a weathertight door at the bow and an open portal at the stern. Vehicles could be loaded and unloaded onto E and G decks simultaneously, using double-deck linkspans at Dover and Calais.

The ships were constructed by Schichau-Unterweser AG in Bremerhaven, Germany. Propulsive power was by means of three 12-cylinder Sulzer medium-speed diesel engines driving variable-pitch propellers. The vehicle deck bow doors were constructed by Cargospeed, Glasgow, Scotland.

== Accident of 6 March 1987 ==

=== Background ===
On the day the ferry capsized, &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot; was working the route between Dover and the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. This was not her normal route and the linkspan at Zeebrugge had not been designed specifically for the &quot;Spirit&quot;-class vessels: it used a single deck, preventing the simultaneous loading of both E and G decks, and the ramp could not be raised high enough to reach E deck. To compensate for this, the vessel&#x27;s bow ballast tanks were filled. The ship&#x27;s natural trim was not restored after loading. Had &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot; survived, she would have been modified to remove the need for this procedure.

It was normal practice for the assistant boatswain to close the doors before moorings were dropped. The assistant boatswain, Mark Stanley however, had returned to his cabin for a short break after cleaning the car deck upon arrival, and was still asleep when the harbour-stations call sounded and the ship dropped her moorings. The first officer, Leslie Sabel, was required to stay on deck to make sure the doors were closed. Sabel said he thought he saw Stanley approaching. He was seriously injured in the disaster and the court concluded that his evidence was inaccurate. It is believed that, under pressure to get to his harbour station on the bridge, he had left G deck with the bow doors open in the expectation that Stanley would arrive shortly.

The court also described the attitude of boatswain Terence Ayling, believed to have been the last person on G deck. Asked why he did not close the doors given there was no one else there to do it, he said it was not his duty. The court nevertheless praised his work in the rescue.

Captain David Lewry assumed that the doors had been closed. He could not see them from the wheelhouse owing to the ship&#x27;s design, and had no indicator lights in the wheelhouse to tell him otherwise.

=== Capsizing ===

The ship left her berth in Zeebrugge inner harbour at 18:05 (GMT) with a crew of 80 and carrying 459 passengers, 81 cars, three buses and 47 trucks. She passed the outer mole at 18:24 (GMT) and capsized about four minutes later. When the ferry reached 90 seconds after leaving the harbour, water began to enter the car deck in large quantities. The resulting free surface effect destroyed her stability. In a matter of seconds, the ship began to list 30 degrees to port. The ship briefly righted herself before listing to port once more, this time capsizing. The entire event took place within 90 seconds. The water quickly reached the ship&#x27;s electrical systems, destroying both main and emergency power and leaving the ship in darkness. The ship ended up on her side half-submerged in shallow water from the shore. Only a fortuitous turn to starboard in her last moments, and then capsizing on a sandbar, prevented the ship from sinking entirely in much deeper water.

Crew aboard a nearby dredger noticed &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot;″s lights disappear, and notified the port authorities. They also reported that the bow doors appeared to be wide open. The alarm was raised at 18:37 (GMT). Rescue helicopters were quickly dispatched, shortly followed by assistance from the Belgian Navy, which was undertaking an exercise in the area. , the German captain of a nearby ferry (M/V &quot;Gabriele Wehr&quot;), was commended by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and received a medal from King Baudouin of Belgium for his heroic efforts in rescuing passengers.

The disaster resulted in the deaths of 193 people. Many of those on board had taken advantage of a promotion in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper offering cheap trips to the continent. Most of the victims were trapped inside the ship and succumbed to hypothermia because of the frigid water. The rescue efforts of the Belgian Navy and Royal Navy divers limited the death toll. Recoverable bodies were removed in the days following the accident. During the rescue the tide started to rise and the rescue team was forced to stop all efforts until morning. The last of the people left on board died of hypothermia.

=== Investigation and inquiry ===
A public Court of Inquiry into the incident was held under British Mr Justice Sheen in 1987.
It found the capsizing was caused by three main factors—Stanley&#x27;s failure to close the bow doors, Sabel&#x27;s failure to make sure the bow doors were closed, and Lewry leaving port without knowing whether the bow doors were closed. While the court determined the immediate cause of the capsizing was Stanley&#x27;s failure to close the bow doors, it was very critical of Sabel for not being in a position to prevent the disaster, calling his actions &quot;the most immediate&quot; cause of the capsizing.

The fact that Stanley was asleep at the time of departure led Sheen to examine the working practices of Townsend Thoresen, from which he concluded that the poor workplace communication and stand-off relationship between ship operators and shore-based managers was the root cause of the capsizing, and identified a &quot;disease of sloppiness&quot; and negligence at every level of the corporation&#x27;s hierarchy. Issues relating to the breaking of waves high on the bow doors while under way and requests to have an indicator installed on the bridge showing the position of the doors were dismissed; the former because of the attitude that ships&#x27; masters would come and &quot;bang on the desk&quot; if an issue was truly important, and the latter because it was thought frivolous to spend money on equipment to indicate if employees had failed to do their job correctly.

The design of &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot; was also found to be a contributory cause of the capsizing. Unlike other ships, which are subdivided into watertight compartments, the vehicle decks of RORO vessels are normally contiguous: any flooding on these decks would allow the water to flow the entire length of the ship. This issue had been identified as early as 1980, following the losses of and in June and November 1977 respectively. The need to adjust the ship&#x27;s bow trim to use the port facilities at Zeebrugge and failure to readjust before departure was another factor in the capsizing.

In October 1983, &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot;″s sister ship &quot;Pride of Free Enterprise&quot; had sailed from Dover to Zeebrugge with the bow doors open, after her assistant boatswain fell asleep. 
It was therefore believed that leaving the bow doors open alone should not have caused the ship to capsize. Tests by the Danish Maritime Institute after the accident, however, found that once water began to enter the vehicle deck of a RORO, it was likely that the vessel would capsize within 30 minutes, while other tests showed that the lack of watertight subdivision (which was common on other vessels) allowed the weight of water to flow freely and increase the likelihood of capsizing.

Another factor that contributed to the capsizing was the &quot;squat effect&quot;. When a vessel is under way, the movement under it creates low pressure, which has the effect of increasing the vessel&#x27;s draught. In deep water the effect is small but in shallow water it is greater, because as the water that passes underneath the vessel moves faster it causes the draught to increase. This reduced the clearance between the bow doors and water line to between . After extensive tests, the investigators found that when the ship travelled at a speed of , the wave was enough to engulf the bow doors. This caused a &quot;step change&quot;: if the ship had been sailing at less than 18 knots and not in shallow water, people on the car deck would probably have had time to notice the bow doors were open and close them.

== Inquest ==
In October 1987, a coroner&#x27;s inquest jury into the capsizing returned 187 verdicts of unlawful killing. Seven people involved at the company were charged with gross negligence manslaughter, and the operating company, P&amp;O European Ferries (Dover) Ltd, was charged with corporate manslaughter, but the case collapsed after Mr Justice Turner directed the jury to acquit the company and the five most senior individual defendants. This was because the various acts of negligence could not be attributed to any individual who was a so-called &quot;controlling mind&quot;. It did, however, set a precedent that corporate manslaughter is an offence known to the law of England and Wales. The disaster was one of a number that influenced thinking leading to the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.

== Aftermath ==

=== Immediate ===

A salvage operation, conducted by Dutch company Smit-Tak Towage and Salvage (part of Smit International), was embarked upon almost immediately to refloat the ship. The operation included parbuckling and was successfully concluded in late April 1987, allowing the remaining bodies trapped underwater to be removed. The ship was towed to Zeebrugge, and then across the Western Scheldt to the yard of De Schelde in Vlissingen (Flushing, Netherlands), where her fate was decided. It had originally been assumed that she could be repaired and continue sailing. No buyer was found however; she was sold to Compania Naviera SA of Kingstown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, for scrapping. She was renamed &quot;Flushing Range&quot; and the Townsend Thoresen branding painted over before her final sailing to a scrapyard at Kaohsiung, Taiwan. She began her final voyage on 5 October 1987, together with MV &quot;Gaelic&quot;, towed by the Dutch tug &quot;Markusturm&quot;. The voyage was interrupted for four days when the ships encountered the Great Storm of 1987 off Cape Finisterre, where &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot; was cast adrift after its tow rope parted, resuming on 19 October 1987. The hull began to disintegrate while off the coast of South Africa on 27 December 1987, and had to be towed into Port Elizabeth on 2 January 1988 to undergo temporary repairs to allow her to continue her voyage. She finally arrived in Taiwan on 22 March 1988.

Inevitably, the Townsend Thoresen brand name had been seen on television and in newspapers all around the world. P&amp;O, who had only just taken over TT before the disaster, quickly decided to re-brand the company as P&amp;O European Ferries, repaint the fleet&#x27;s red hulls in navy blue and remove the TT logo from the funnels.

=== Long-term ===
The capsizing of &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot; caused the highest death count of any peacetime maritime disaster involving a British ship since the sinking of HMY &quot;Iolaire&quot; on 1 January 1919 near Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, when at least 205 perished of the 280 aboard.

Since the accident, several improvements to the design of this type of vessel have been made. These include indicators on the bridge that display the state of the bow doors, watertight ramps being fitted to the bow sections of the front of the ship, and &quot;freeing flaps&quot; to allow water to escape from a vehicle deck in the event of flooding. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea regulations were changed in 1990 to require of freeboard (in the case of RORO vessels, defined as the height between the vehicle deck and the water line) for all new ROROs, instead of the previous . Some vessels omit the bow door configuration altogether and vehicles enter and exit from rear doors only. New International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations are in place that prohibit an open (undivided) deck of this length on a passenger RORO vessel. The capsizing of the ship is used as a standard example of the free surface effect in manuals of seamanship dealing with stability.

Both of &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot;″s two sister ships have since been withdrawn from service. The former &quot;Spirit of Free Enterprise&quot; was extended to increase her cargo capacity during her time under the P&amp;O flag in a stretch and total rebuild operation and scrapped in 2012. &quot;Pride of Free Enterprise&quot; remained more or less as built, being scrapped in 2015.

In the UK, an ensemble group named Ferry Aid released a charity record of the song &quot;Let It Be&quot; by the Beatles.

Nicholas Ridley, a government minister at the time, was criticised for alluding to the accident (while speaking on another subject) on 10 March 1987. He was quoted as saying that &quot;although he is the pilot of the [parliamentary] Bill, he has not got his bow doors open&quot;. He apologised for the remark.

The disaster was the subject of an episode from Series 2 of &quot;Seconds From Disaster&quot;.

The disaster was also featured in an episode of &quot;Deadly Engineering&quot; (Season 1, Episode 5) on the Science Channel.

On 1 July 2014, The History Press released a book called &quot;Ninety Seconds at Zeebrugge: The Herald of Free Enterprise Story&quot; (), telling the story of the disaster and its aftermath. A second edition, updated to reflect the thirtieth anniversary, was released on 1 March 2018 ().

St Mary&#x27;s Church, Dover houses a permanent memorial to the disaster. In the village church of St Margaret, St Margaret&#x27;s at Cliffe, there is a stained-glass window dedicated to Bob Crone, Bryan Eades and Graham Evans, three of the crewmen who died during the disaster.

=== Disaster Action ===
Australian businessman Maurice de Rohan, who lost his daughter and son-in-law in the tragedy, founded Disaster Action, a charity which assists people affected by similar events.

<doc id="523579" wikidata="Q15047180" url="?curid=523579" title="Maria Fyfe">
<text>Catherine Mary &quot;Maria&quot; Fyfe (&quot;née&quot; O&#x27;Neill; 25 November 1938 – 3 December 2020), known as Maria Fyfe, was a Scottish politician and educator who served as Member of Parliament for Glasgow Maryhill from 1987 to 2001. 

She was Deputy Shadow Minister for Women from 1988 to 1991, Convener of the Scottish Group of Labour MPs from 1991 to 1992 and front bench spokesperson for Scotland from 1992 to 1995. Fyfe campaigned for 50-50 representation of women in the Scottish Parliament.

==Background==
Catherine Maria O&#x27;Neill was born on 25 November 1938 in Glasgow, where she grew up in Gorbals, the daughter of James O&#x27;Neill, a clerk, tram driver and shopworker, and Margaret Lacey, a former shop assistant. She briefly spent time in Ireland during the Second World War before returning to Glasgow, and was educated at Notre Dame High School in the city. In 1964, she married James Fyfe; they had two sons. She returned to education as a mature student, studying Economic History at the University of Strathclyde and graduating in 1975 with a BA (Hons). She worked as a senior lecturer in the Trade Union Studies Unit at Glasgow Central College of Commerce from 1978 to 1987.

===Early political career===
Fyfe became a member of the Labour Party in 1960. She and her husband James, a journalist with the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot;, left Labour to join Jim Sillars&#x27; breakaway pro-devolution Scottish Labour Party (SLP) in 1976, but the internal strife that plagued the new venture led to her expulsion and return to her former party within a year. In 1980 she was a Labour candidate in that year&#x27;s Glasgow District Council election, where she took the Blairdardie ward from the Scottish National Party with a majority of 763 votes. On the council, she served firstly as Vice-Convener of the Finance Committee (1980–84) and then as Convener of the Personnel Committee until 1987, when she was elected to Parliament. She was a member of Labour&#x27;s Scottish Executive Committee from 1981 to 1988.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1987 general election, Fyfe was returned to Parliament as Member for Glasgow Maryhill, a position she occupied until the 2001 general election. She served as Deputy Shadow Minister for Women from 1988 to 1991, Convener of the Scottish Group of Labour MPs from 1991 to 1992, and front bench spokesperson for Scotland from 1992 to 1995. She did not stand for reelection at the 2001 General Election and was succeeded by Ann McKechin. Fyfe was awarded an honorary D.Univ. by the University of Glasgow in 2002.

She was quoted as saying: &quot;I am proudest of having been involved in the 50-50 campaign to ensure that the Scottish Parliament started life with an almost equal representation of women, up there with the Scandinavian countries&quot;. She was also involved in opposing the poll tax in both England and Scotland, and launched a campaign against employee blacklisting in 1988. After standing down Fyfe continued to campaign politically including on the issue of homelessness. She also chaired the campaign to erect a statue of Glasgow councillor and rent strike campaigner Mary Barbour.

==Later life==
Fyfe was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project. She wrote two autobiographies, the first entitled &quot;A Problem Like Maria&quot; describing her work as an MP, and a second book &quot;Singing in the Streets&quot;, about her life growing up in the Gorbals in the aftermath of the Second World War, as well as her earlier political career. She also wrote another political book, &quot;Women Saying No: Making a Positive Case Against Independence&quot;, in advance of the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. 

Fyfe had two sons and four grandchildren. On 3 December 2020, she died at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital from COVID-19 during the pandemic, aged 82.

<text>Abdullah Mohamed Omar OLS (26 May 1934 – 13 March 2004), better known as Dullah Omar, was a South African anti-Apartheid activist, lawyer, and a minister in the South African cabinet from 1994 until his death.

==Early life and education==

Born in Observatory, Cape Town, to immigrant parents from Gujarat in western India, Omar attended Trafalgar High School in Cape Town. He was a respected member of the Muslim community. He attended the University of Cape Town and graduated with a law degree in 1957.

==Anti-apartheid activities==

He defended members of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and African National Congress (ANC) and was a member of the &quot;Unity Movement&quot; throughout the Early 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s before he joined and became a leading member of the United Democratic Front. He was a human rights activist throughout his life.

His movement was generally restricted by &quot;banning orders&quot; and he was detained without trial repeatedly. He also survived plots by the apartheid government to assassinate him. In 1989, he became a spokesman of Nelson Mandela, during the last months of the latter&#x27;s imprisonment.

==Government minister==

In 1994, Omar became Minister of Justice in South Africa in Nelson Mandela&#x27;s ANC government, and was the first cabinet minister appointed Acting President in the absence of both the President and Deputy President from South Africa. He played a major role in transforming the South African justice system. One of his principal actions was the promulgation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in July 1995 to look into the crimes committed during apartheid and offer platforms for victims and their families to confront the perpetrators, who would in turn be offered amnesty for coming forward. The model served as an inspiration for other post-conflict societies in places such as Sierra Leone and Rwanda.

In 1999, following the election of Thabo Mbeki as President, Omar became the Minister of Transport, a post that he held until his death from cancer.

Of Indian descent and a lifelong resident of the Western Cape, he was married with three children, and was buried with official honours, and in accordance with Muslim rites on the day of his death.

<text>Acco was a chief of the Senones in Gaul, who induced his countrymen to revolt against Julius Caesar in 53 BC. On the conclusion of the war, and after a conference at Durocortorum, Caesar had Acco tried and convicted on charges of treason. As punishment, he was flogged to death in the full sight of the other leaders of that people.

<doc id="523604" wikidata="Q1175613" url="?curid=523604" title="David McLetchie">
<text>David William McLetchie CBE (6 August 1952 – 12 August 2013) was a Scottish politician who served as Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party from 1999 to 2005. He was Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Edinburgh Pentlands constituency from 2003 to 2011 and the Lothian region from 1999 to 2003 and 2011 to 2013.

==Early life and career==

Born in Edinburgh, McLetchie attended Leith Academy and George Heriot&#x27;s School and graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a degree in law in 1974. He trained as a solicitor with Shepherd and Wedderburn, before joining Tods Murray where he was assumed a partner. He specialised in tax, trusts, and estate planning. In 1979, he contested the Edinburgh Central seat for the Conservatives, but lost to Robin Cook of the Labour Party.

==Member of the Scottish Parliament==
===Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party===
McLetchie became Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party upon the creation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, having been elected in the 1998 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election. He was forced to resign as Scottish Conservative leader following a scandal over his expense claims in 2005.

===Resignation===
McLetchie announced his resignation as Scottish Conservative Party leader on 31 October 2005, after it was revealed he had spent £11,500 of taxpayers&#x27; money on taxi fares, more than any other MSP. The problem was not so much the large bill, but that he had used taxis for Conservative &quot;party&quot; business (as opposed to &quot;constituency&quot; business). His successor as leader was Annabel Goldie.

===Backbencher===
McLetchie was elected as an additional member for the Lothians region in 1999 and the Edinburgh Pentlands constituency in 2003. Following his resignation as leader, he had a short spell as a backbencher in the Parliament though he remained a prominent figure, his major successes from this period include his campaigns on free personal care and road pricing.

McLetchie was re-elected in Edinburgh Pentlands in 2007 with an increased share of the vote and his majority doubled. On his return, he was made Conservative Chief Whip and business manager, a role which was set to be more important than ever before; given the minority SNP administration. However, he lost his seat to Gordon MacDonald of the SNP in 2011. Although not re-elected in Pentlands, he was returned to Parliament as a &quot;list&quot; MSP for the Lothian region.

== Personal life ==
McLetchie was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours. He died of cancer on 12 August 2013, aged 61.

<text>Édouard Benjamin Baillaud (; 14 February 1848 – 8 July 1934) was a French astronomer.

==Biography==
Born in Chalon-sur-Saône, Baillaud studied at the École Normale Supérieure (1866-1869) and the University of Paris. He worked as an assistant at the Paris Observatory beginning in 1872. Later he was director of the Toulouse Observatory from 1878 to 1907, during much of this time serving as Dean of the University of Toulouse Faculty of Science.

He greatly expanded the observatory and enthusiastically supported the &quot;Carte du Ciel&quot; project. He specialized in celestial mechanics, in particular the motions of the satellites of Saturn.

In 1903, the observatory took over a facility on the Pic du Midi in the Pyrenees that had been founded by amateurs in the 1850s with the goal of putting a telescope there. However, the height of 2865 metres (9400 feet) posed formidable logistical challenges and the ambition had remained unrealised though a meteorological observatory had operated from 1873 to 1880. Baillaud organised a team of soldiers to erect a 0.5 metre (20 inch) reflecting telescope, and 0.25 metre refracting telescope on the summit.

In 1907, he became director of the Paris Observatory where he immediately set to work to relaunch the stalled &quot;Carte du Ciel&quot; project with a conference held at the observatory, entertained by singers from the Paris Opera and refreshed by wine provided by the director of the Bordeaux Observatory. Though the French government agreed to fund the project, it was becoming increasingly clear that its objectives were hopelessly unrealistic.

Baillaud was the President of the Société astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1909 to 1911.

Baillaud was active in time standardisation, becoming the founding president of the International Time Bureau and initiating the transmission of a time signal from the Eiffel Tower. Baillaud maintained the observatory and the time signal throughout World War I, even though the German howitzer &quot;Big Bertha&quot; was targeted on the nominal co-ordinates of Paris, the location of the observatory! Baillaud&#x27;s concern for the astronomical time standard led him to be an outspoken opponent of daylight saving time.

Baillaud became founding president of the International Astronomical Union in 1919 and served in this position until 1922. He retired as director of the Paris Observatory in 1926.

He was a regular academician in the astronomy section of the &quot;Académie des Sciences&quot;. He won the Bruce Medal in 1923.

The crater Baillaud on the Moon is named after him, and so are asteroids 11764 Benbaillaud and 1280 Baillauda.

<text>Charles Simon Favart (; 13 November 1710 – 12 May 1792) was a French playwright and theatre director. The Salle Favart in Paris is named after him.

==Biography==
Born in Paris, the son of a pastry-cook, he was educated at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, and after his father&#x27;s death he carried on the business for a time. His first success in literature was &quot;La France delivrée par la Pucelle d&#x27;Orléans&quot;, a poem about Joan of Arc which obtained a prize of the Académie des Jeux Floraux. After the production of his first &quot;vaudeville&quot;, &quot;Les Deux Jumelles&quot; (1734), circumstances enabled him to relinquish business and devote himself entirely to the drama. He provided many pieces anonymously for the lesser theatres, and first put his name to &quot;La Chercheuse d&#x27;esprit&quot;, which was produced in 1741.

Among his most successful works were &quot;Annette et Lubin; Le Coq du milage&quot; (1743); &quot;Les Vendanges de Tempé&quot; (1745), later reworked as &quot;La Vallée de Montmorency&quot; (1752); &quot;Ninette à la cour&quot; (1753); &quot;Les Trois Sultanes&quot; (1761) and &quot;L&#x27;Anglais de Bordeaux&quot; (1763). Favart became director of the Opéra-Comique, and in 1745 married Marie Justine Benoîte Duronceray, a beautiful young dancer, singer and actress, who as &quot;Mlle Chantilly&quot; had made a successful début the year before. By their united talents and labours, the Opéra-Comique rose to such a height of success that it aroused the jealousy of the rival Comédie-Française and was suppressed.

Favart, left thus without resources, accepted the proposal of comte Maurice de Saxe, and became director of a troupe of comedians which was to accompany Maurice&#x27;s army into Flanders. It was part of his duty to compose from time to time impromptu verses on the events of the campaign, amusing and stimulating the spirits of the men. So popular were Favart and his troupe that the enemy became desirous of hearing his company and sharing his services, and permission was given to gratify them, battles and comedies thus curiously alternating with each other.

The marshal, an admirer of Mme Favart, began to pay her unwanted attentions. To escape him she went to Paris, and the wrath of Saxe fell upon the husband. A &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; was issued against him, but he fled to Strasbourg and found concealment in a cellar.

Favart survived his wife by twenty years. After the marshal&#x27;s death in 1750 he returned to Paris and resumed his pursuits as a dramatist. It was at this time that he became friendly with the abbé de Voisenon, who helped him with his work, to what extent is uncertain. He had grown nearly blind in his last days, and died in Paris. The Favart&#x27;s second son, Charles Nicolas Favart was also an actor and dramatist.

His plays have been republished in various editions and selections (1763-1772, 12 vols.; 1810, 3 vols.; 1813; 1853). His correspondence (1759-1763) with Count Durazzo, director of theatres at Vienna, was published in 1808 as &quot;&quot;. It furnishes valuable information on the state of the literary and theatrical worlds in the 18th century.

Favart&#x27;s plays are also known to have inspired his close friend, the artist François Boucher, to create numerous paintings featuring Favart&#x27;s characters of &quot;the little Shepherd&quot; and the shepherdess &quot;Lisette.&quot; These include Boucher&#x27;s &quot;The Agreeable Lesson&quot; (also known as &quot;The Flute Players&quot;) of 1748 and &quot;An Autumn Pastoral&quot; (also known as &quot;The Grape Eaters&quot;) of 1749. In turn, these paintings inspired artists of the Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory to create a pair of figurines showing the two characters in poses imitating the characters of the play.

== Works ==
Some 60 of the c. 150 plays that he composed (essentially comedies and opéras-comiques) were published in his lifetime, in 10 volumes, under the title &quot;Théâtre de M. Favart&quot;, Paris, Duchesne (later Veuve Duchesne), 1763–1772. Reprint in fac-simile, Geneva, Slatkine, 1971, 10 t. Availabable on Gallica.

<doc id="523615" wikidata="Q853685" url="?curid=523615" title="Treaty of Nöteborg">
<text>The Treaty of Nöteborg, also known as the Treaty of Orehovsk (; ; ), is a conventional name for the peace treaty signed at Oreshek (; ) on 12 August 1323. It was the first agreement between Sweden and the Novgorod Republic regulating their border, mostly in the area which is now known as Finland. Three years later, Novgorod signed the Treaty of Novgorod with the Norwegians.

== Name ==
At the time, the treaty had no distinguishing name. It was regarded as a &quot;permanent peace&quot; solution between Sweden and Novgorod. &quot;The Treaty of Nöteborg&quot; is a direct translation of the Swedish &quot;Nöteborgsfreden&quot;. The Russian term for the treaty, directly translated into English, is &quot;The Peace of Orehovsk&quot;, latinized as &quot;Orehovskii Mir&quot;, or &quot;Ореховский мир&quot; in Cyrillic script. The Swedish &quot;Nöteborg&quot; and the Russian &quot;Orehovsk&quot; are names for an old fortress in Shlisselburg. The Finnish term for the treaty, &quot;Pähkinäsaaren Rauha&quot;, translates literally to &quot;The Peace of Nut Island&quot;. It is a cognate of the Swedish word (&#x27;nöt&#x27; meaning nut). Pähkinäsaari is the Finnish name for the island on which the fortress was built.

== Contents ==
The full text of the original treaty no longer exists. It has survived in parts in Russian, Swedish, and Latin. The surviving partial texts somewhat differ from each other.

The treaty was negotiated with the help of the Hanseatic League in order to conclude the Swedish-Novgorodian Wars. As a token of goodwill, Novgorod ceded three Karelian parishes to Sweden. Sweden would in turn stay out of any conflict between Novgorod and the Danish Duchy of Estonia. Both sides would promise to refrain from building castles on the new border.

The treaty defined the border as beginning from east and north of Viborg Castle, running along the Sestra and Volchya Rivers, splitting the Karelian Isthmus in half, running across Savonia and, according to traditional interpretations, ending in the Gulf of Bothnia near the river Pyhäjoki. However the wording &quot;the sea in the north&quot; could be interpreted as the Arctic Ocean.

The southern part of the border close to Viborg was considered the most important part of the treaty and the new border. As such, it was clearly defined. The border further north, away from important settlements, was defined more vaguely. The treaty might have originally given both Sweden and Novgorod joint rights to northern Ostrobothnia and Lappland.

== Aftermath ==
Finnic tribes living on both sides of the border had no say in the treaty. Sweden and Novgorod had already established their respective &quot;de facto&quot; control over their areas of influence in eastern Fennoscandia, with Karelians under Russian rule and the western tribes under Swedish rule. The attempted &quot;permanent peace&quot; established by the treaty did not last for long. The northern part of the border crossed wide stretches of wilderness which later on became the center of contention between Sweden and Novgorod. Within five years from the treaty being signed, Swedish colonists started making inroads into northern Ostrobothnia. Sweden established castles at Uleåborg circa 1375 and Olofsborg in 1475. These fortresses were clearly on the Novgorodian side of the established border.

In 1595, the Treaty of Teusina acknowledged the Swedish version of the treaty as the authentic and correct one. Long before that, Sweden had permanently taken over large areas on the Novgorodian side. These new territories included Ostrobothnia and Savonia. Eventually, the territory which was under Swedish rule would become the nation we now know as Finland.

<text>&quot; Seiza &quot; ( or ; ; ) is the formal, traditional way of sitting in Japan. It involves a specific positioning and posture in a kneeled position so as to convey respect, particularly toward elders. It developed among samurai during the Edo period and was later widely adopted by the public. 

&quot;Seiza&quot; is associated with straw &quot;tatami&quot; flooring or &quot;zabuton&quot; pillows that allow for comfortable sitting, and it is commonly used in several Japanese practices, including Japanese martial arts and the Japanese tea ceremony. Sitting &quot;seiza&quot;-style is often difficult for people who are not accustomed to it or for the physically infirm, such as injured people and the elderly. Sitting &quot;seiza&quot;-style for long periods of time is associated with health problems, particularly those of the knees. &quot;Seiza&quot; may be compared to similar seated positions in other cultures, such as Indian Vajrasana.

== Form ==
To sit &quot;seiza&quot;-style, one must first be kneeling on the floor, folding one&#x27;s legs underneath one&#x27;s thighs, while resting the buttocks on the heels. The ankles are turned outward as the tops of the feet are lowered so that, in a slight &quot;V&quot; shape, the tops of the feet are flat on the floor and big toes overlapped, the right always on top of the left, and the buttocks are finally lowered all the way down. Depending on the circumstances, the hands are folded modestly in the lap, or are placed palm down on the upper thighs with the fingers close together, or are placed on the floor next to the hips, with the knuckles rounded and touching the floor. The back is kept straight, though not unnaturally stiff. Traditionally, women sit with the knees together while men separate them slightly. Some martial arts, notably kendō, aikidō, and iaidō, may prescribe up to two fist widths of distance between the knees for men.

Stepping into and out of &quot;seiza&quot; is performed mindfully. There are codified traditional methods of entering and exiting the sitting position depending on occasion and type of clothing worn.

== History ==
Prior to the Edo period, there were no standard postures for sitting on the floor. During this time, &quot;seiza&quot; referred to &quot;correct sitting&quot;, which took various forms such as sitting cross-legged (胡坐, &quot;agura&quot;), sitting with one knee raised (立て膝, &quot;tatehiza&quot;), or sitting to the side (割座, &quot;wariza&quot;), while the posture commonly known as &quot;seiza&quot; today was called &quot;kiza&quot; (危座).

People&#x27;s social circumstances, clothing styles, and the places where they sat naturally brought about their manners of sitting. The development, in the Muromachi period, of Japanese architecture in which the floors were completely covered with &quot;tatami&quot; (thick straw mats), combined with the strict formalities of the ruling warrior class for which this style of architecture was principally designed, heralded the adoption of the sitting posture known today as &quot;seiza&quot; as the respectful way to sit. By the middle of the Edo period, it had become a convention for samurai to sit in this manner when meeting authority figures such as the Shogun as a symbol of obedience and loyalty. However, it probably was not until around the years surrounding the turn of the 18th century (the Genroku to Kyōhō eras in Japanese history) that the Japanese generally adopted this manner of sitting in their everyday lives and during the Meiji era, it had become firmly established as the proper sitting posture, as part of the &quot;Japanese culture and tradition&quot; purposefully created during this time.

The posture serves as the standard floor sitting posture for most traditional formal occasions, and it is generally considered the respectful way to sit in the presence of superiors or elders unless otherwise permitted. There is a similar sitting posture in India called vajrasana. It would be done during a form of yoga and practiced during visiting temples and doing prayer in temples. Indians believe that this posture has health benefits.

== Floor ==
&quot;Seiza&quot; involves sitting down on the floor and not on a chair. In traditional Japanese architecture, floors in various rooms designed for comfort have &quot;tatami&quot; floors. &quot;Seiza&quot; thus is closely connected with &quot;tatami&quot; flooring. There are circumstances, however, when people sit &quot;seiza&quot;-style on carpeted and hardwood floors. In many martial arts, for instance, this sitting position generally takes place on hardwood floors. Depending on the formality of the occasion, the setting, and the relative status of the person, it is sometimes acceptable to sit on a special cushion called a &quot;zabuton&quot; (literally a &quot;sitting futon&quot;).

== Difficulties ==
Sometimes stools are provided for elderly or injured people even when others are expected to sit &quot;seiza&quot;-style. It is recommended, particularly in formal situations, to at least try to sit &quot;seiza&quot;-style. Non-Japanese who have not grown up sitting in this posture may, however, have difficulty assuming it at all. Those unfamiliar with &quot;seiza&quot; will likely find that maintaining it for more than a minute or two tends to lead to paresthesia, whereby the compression of the nerves causes a loss of their blood flow, with the accompanying &quot;pins and needles&quot; feeling, followed by painful burning sensations, and then eventually complete numbness in the legs. However, the physical discomfort lessens with experience as the circulation of the blood improves. Experienced &quot;seiza&quot; practitioners can maintain the posture for forty minutes or more with minimal discomfort. Certain knee problems are made worse when assuming this position, specifically Osgood-Schlatter disease.

Special &quot;seiza&quot; stools are available in Japan. They are folding stools, small enough to be carried in a handbag, which are placed between the feet and on which one rests the buttocks when sitting seiza-style. They allow one to maintain the appearance of sitting seiza while discreetly taking pressure off the heels and feet.

A law that came into effect in April 2020 recognizes &quot;seiza&quot; for extended periods of time as a morally unacceptable form of punishment according to Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.

== Use in traditional arts==
Doing &quot;seiza&quot; is an integral and required part of several traditional Japanese arts, such as certain Japanese martial arts and tea ceremony (a table-style version of tea ceremony known as &quot;ryūrei&quot; was invented in the 19th century). &quot;Seiza&quot; is also the traditional way of sitting while doing other arts such as &quot;shodō&quot; (calligraphy) and ikebana (flower arranging), though with the increasing use of western-style furniture it is not always necessary nowadays.

Many theatres for traditional performing arts such as kabuki and sumo still have audience seating sections where the spectators sit in &quot;seiza&quot; style.

=== &quot;Shikkō&quot; ===
Walking on the feet and knees while in the &quot;seiza&quot; posture, known as , is considered more polite than standing up and walking regularly. &quot;Shikkō&quot; is today quite rare, but is found in some traditional formal restaurants and &quot;ryokan&quot;, and is practiced in the martial art of aikido, where practitioners learn to defend themselves while moving in &quot;shikkō&quot;.

To perform this knee-walking movement correctly the heels must be kept close together, and the body must move as a whole unit. Movement in &quot;shikkō&quot; forces one to engage the hips in a way that is considered valuable for aikido training.

==Alternative sitting positions==
===&quot;Agura&quot;===

Sitting cross-legged, &quot;agura&quot;, is considered informal: it is appropriate for certain situations but not others. It is common in informal situations, such as eating at a low table in a casual restaurant, and allowed in formal situations especially for those for whom &quot;seiza&quot; is difficult, such as elderly or non-Japanese people.

===&quot;Yokozuwari&quot;===

Some sitting postures (e.g. &quot;agura&quot;, &quot;tatehiza&quot;, etc.) are impossible to do in skirts or certain types of women&#x27;s traditional clothing (such as the premodern kimono) without risk of exposure, so an alternative informal sitting posture has both legs off to one side, with one side of the hips on the floor, termed .

===&quot;Wariza&quot;===
Another informal sitting posture for women is called which resembles &quot;seiza&quot; posture, whereby the buttocks are on the floor and the lower legs are bent off to their respective sides.

===&quot;Kiza&quot;===
To sit in &quot;seiza&quot; requires coming to a kneeling position momentarily, with the heels propped up; if one remains seated on the heels with the balls of the feet touching the floor and toes flexed forward, it is called . If one then lowers the tops of the feet to the floor, one then will be in the &quot;seiza&quot; position. In some schools of &quot;iaido&quot;, practitioners stand up to draw the sword and cut after momentarily assuming &quot;kiza&quot;, so as not to sprain the instep jumping up directly from &quot;seiza&quot;.

<text>A seam ripper is a small sewing tool used for cutting and removing stitches.

The most common form consists of a handle, shaft and head. The head is usually forked with a cutting surface situated at the base of the fork. In some designs, one side of the fork tapers to a sharp point to allow easier insertion in tight stitching.

In using a seam ripper, the sharp point of the tool is inserted into the seam underneath the thread to be cut. The thread is allowed to slip down into the fork and the tool is then lifted upwards, allowing the blade to rip through the thread. Once the seam has been undone in this way the loose ends can be removed and the seam resewn.

<doc id="523629" wikidata="Q336397" url="?curid=523629" title="Robert May, Baron May of Oxford">
<text>Robert McCredie May, Baron May of Oxford (8 January 1936 – 28 April 2020) was an Australian scientist who was Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government, President of the Royal Society, and a professor at the University of Sydney and Princeton University. He held joint professorships at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London. He was also a crossbench member of the House of Lords from 2001 until his retirement in 2017.

May was a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, and an appointed member of the council of the British Science Association. He was also a member of the advisory council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering.

==Early life and education==
May was born in Sydney on 8 January 1936, to lawyer Henry Wilkinson May and Kathleen Mitchell (née McCredie), who divorced when he was seven years old. His father was of prosperous middle-class Northern Irish origin, and his mother was the daughter of a Scottish engineer. May was educated at Sydney Boys High School. He then attended the University of Sydney, where he studied chemical engineering and theoretical physics (BSc 1956) and received a PhD in theoretical physics in 1959. He was a patron of the Sydney High School Old Boys Union.

==Career and research==
===Career===

Early in his career, May developed an interest in animal population dynamics and the relationship between complexity and stability in natural communities. He was able to make major advances in the field of population biology through the application of mathematical techniques. His work played a key role in the development of theoretical ecology through the 1970s and 1980s. He also applied these tools to the study of disease and to the study of biodiversity.

May was Gordon MacKay Lecturer in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University (1959–61) and returned to the University of Sydney (1962) as senior lecturer, reader, and professor (1969–72) in theoretical physics. From 1973 until 1988, he was Class of 1977 Professor of Zoology at Princeton University, serving as chairman of the University Research Board 197788. From 1988 until 1995, he held a Royal Society Research Professorship jointly at Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, where he became a fellow of Merton College and a Master of Arts. He was Chief Scientific Adviser to HM Government and head of the Office of Science and Technology (1995–2000), and president of the Royal Society (2000–2005).

===Public life===
May held subsidiary appointments as executive trustee of the Nuffield Foundation, member of the board of the United Kingdom Sports Institute, foundation trustee of the Gates Trust (University of Cambridge), chairman of the board of trustees of the Natural History Museum, trustee of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, independent member of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, trustee of World Wildlife Fund-UK, president of the British Ecological Society, and member of the Committee on Climate Change.

In 1996, May asked Ig Nobel to stop awarding prizes to British scientists because this might lead the public to treat worthwhile research less seriously (see Criticism of Ig Nobel).

===Climate change co-operation===
Although an atheist since age 11, May stated that religion may help society deal with climate change. While referring to what he believed to be a rigid structure of fundamentalist religion, he stated that the co-operational aspects of non-fundamentalist religion may in fact help with climate change. When asked if religious leaders should be doing more to persuade people to combat climate change, he stated that it was absolutely necessary. May also estimated that there may be approximately 7 million species present in the Earth, both animal and plant combined.

===Awards and honours===
May was appointed Knight Bachelor in 1996, and a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1998. In 2001, on the recommendation of the House of Lords Appointments Commission, he was created a life peer. He was one of the first fifteen peers to be elevated in this manner. After his initial preference for &quot;Baron May of Woollahra&quot; failed an objection from the Protocol Office of the Australian Prime Minister&#x27;s Department, he chose the style and title Baron May of Oxford, of Oxford in the County of Oxfordshire. He was made a member of the Order of Merit in 2002.

He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977 and to the Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1979. He became a Corresponding Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1991, a Foreign Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1992, a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2001, a member of the Academia Europaea in 1994, and Fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 2010. 

In 2005 he was appointed an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. In 2009 Lord May became only the 7th ever Honorary Fellow of the Australian Institute of Building (HonFAIB). He received honorary degrees from universities including Uppsala(1990), Yale (1993), Sydney (1995), Princeton (1996), and the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (2003). He was awarded the Weldon Memorial Prize by the University of Oxford (1980), an Award by the MacArthur Foundation (1984), the Medal of the Linnean Society of London (1991), the Marsh Christian Prize (1992), the Frink Medal by the Zoological Society of London (1995), the Crafoord Prize (1996), the Balzan Prize (1998) for Biodiversity and the Copley Medal by the Royal Society (2007) and the Lord Lewis Prize by the Royal Society of Chemistry (2008).

==Personal life==
During his postdoctoral research at the Division of Engineering and Applied Physics at Harvard University as Gordon MacKay Lecturer in Applied Mathematics, between 1959 and 1961, May met his wife, Judith Feiner, a native of Manhattan. The Mays had a daughter, Naomi.

May died at a nursing home in Oxford of pneumonia complicated by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on 28 April 2020, aged 84.

<text>The Texas Senate is the upper house of the Texas Legislature, with the Texas House of Representatives being the lower house. Together, they compose the state legislature of the state of Texas.

There are 31 members of the Senate, representing single-member districts across the U.S. state of Texas, with populations of approximately 940,000 per constituency, based on the 2020 U.S. Census. Elections are held in even-numbered years on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

There are no term limits. Terms are four years in length, with one two-year term each decade. Senators are divided into two groups based in part on the intervening Census:
*In elections in years ending in &quot;2&quot; (the election after the Census), all 31 seats are up for election.
*Once the Senate meets in session after said election, the Senators will participate in a drawing to determine their election cycle:
**One-half will have a 2-4-4 cycle, whereupon the seat would stand for election after two years (the year ending in &quot;4&quot;), then again in four years (the year ending in &quot;8&quot;), then finally in another four years (coinciding with all seats standing for election in the year ending in &quot;2&quot;).
**The other half will have a 4-4-2 cycle, whereupon the seat would stand for election after four years (the year ending in &quot;6&quot;), then again in four years (the year ending in &quot;0&quot;), then finally in only two years (coinciding with all seats standing for election in the year ending in &quot;2&quot;).
As such, every two years, about half of the Texas Senate is on the ballot.

The Senate meets at the Texas State Capitol in Austin. The Republicans currently control the chamber, which is made up of 20 Republicans and 11 Democrats.

==Leadership==
The Lieutenant Governor of Texas serves as the President of the Senate. Unlike most lieutenant governors who are constitutionally designated as presiding officers of the upper house, the Lieutenant Governor regularly presides over the chamber rather than delegate this role to the President Pro Tempore. The Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s duties include appointing chairs of committees, committee members, assigning and referring bills to specific committees, recognizing members during debate, and making procedural rulings. The Lieutenant Governor may also cast a vote should a Senate floor vote end in a tie. If the Senate votes to dissolve itself into the Committee of the Whole, in which all members are part of the Committee, the President Pro-Tempore presides over the proceedings, with the Lieutenant Governor acting as a regular voting member. Due to the various powers of committee selection and bill assignment, the Lieutenant Governor of Texas is considered one of the most powerful lieutenant governorships in the United States.

Unlike other state legislatures, the Texas Senate does not include majority or minority leaders. Instead, the President Pro Tempore is considered the second most powerful position, and can be reserved to any political party in the chamber regardless if the party is a majority or not. Presidents Pro Tempore are usually the most senior members of the Senate. The President Pro Tempore presides when the Lieutenant Governor is not present or when the legislature is not in regular session.

==History==

===Quorum-busting===

There have been at least three cases of quorum-busting in Texas Senate history. The first case was in 1870, with the Rump Senate, followed by the 1979 Killer Bees and finally the &quot;Texas Eleven&quot; in August 2003 during the controversial mid-decade redistricting plan at the time.

==Committee structure==
The following represents the Senate committee structure for the 88th Legislature (numbers in parentheses are the number of committee members, as appointed by the President of the Texas Senate).

*Business and Commerce (11)
*Criminal Justice (7)
*Education (13)
**Under this Committee, a Subcommittee on Higher Education (5)

<doc id="523632" wikidata="Q1428813" url="?curid=523632" title="Hanoi Rocks">
<text>Hanoi Rocks were a Finnish rock band formed in 1979. They were the first Finnish band to chart in the UK and they were also popular in Japan. By 1984, the band was considered to be on the verge of an international breakthrough when they released their first major label album for CBS and headed for their first US tour. The tour was however cut short when their drummer Nicholas &quot;Razzle&quot; Dingley died in a drunk driving incident with Vince Neil behind the wheel in December 1984. The band never recovered from the loss and announced their split in June 1985. After their initial break-up, lead singer Michael Monroe became the first Finnish artist to chart on the American Billboard 200 in 1989. Monroe and original lead guitarist Andy McCoy reunited in 2001 with a new lineup that lasted until 2009. Although musically closer to traditional rock n&#x27; roll and punk, Hanoi Rocks has been cited as a major influence in the glam metal genre for bands such as Guns N&#x27; Roses, Skid Row and Poison.

According to Finnish radio and TV personality Jone Nikula, who was the band&#x27;s tour manager in the 2000s, Hanoi Rocks&#x27;s albums have sold between 780,000 and 1,000,000 copies around the world, mostly in Scandinavia and Japan.

The original line-up (Michael Monroe, Andy McCoy, Nasty Suicide, Sami Yaffa and Gyp Casino) reunited at Monroe&#x27;s 60 year birthday concert on 23 September 2022 at the Helsinki Ice Hall.

==History==
===Formation and early days (1979–1980)===
Hanoi Rocks were formed in Helsinki in 1979 by Michael Monroe (Matti Fagerholm) and his friend, guitarist Andy McCoy (Antti Hulkko). McCoy did not join the band immediately, because he was the guitarist for the Finnish punk band Pelle Miljoona Oy. McCoy allowed Monroe to form the band with the agreement that McCoy would join the band later.

The original line-up of Hanoi Rocks was Monroe on vocals, former Pelle Miljoona Oy guitarist Stefan Piesnack, Monroe&#x27;s guitarist Nasty Suicide, bassist Nedo Soininen, and Peki Sirola on drums.

The band toured Finnish clubs, playing McCoy and Monroe&#x27;s own songs and covers like Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;He&#x27;s a Whore&quot;, The Police&#x27;s &quot;Born in the 50s&quot; and MC5&#x27;s &quot;Looking at You&quot;. At one of the band&#x27;s first shows was Seppo Vesterinen, who had brought big-name artists like Iggy Pop and Frank Zappa to Finland. Vesterinen soon became the band&#x27;s manager after speaking with McCoy and Monroe. In late 1980 Andy McCoy left Pelle Miljoona Oy to join Hanoi Rocks, and was later joined by another former Pelle Miljoona Oy member, bassist Sami Yaffa. McCoy replaced Stefan Piesnack, who had been arrested for drug possession, and Yaffa replaced Nedo. By then Peki had left the band, and when they relocated to Stockholm, they hired an old friend of Monroe and McCoy&#x27;s, drummer Gyp Casino formerly of Warheads.

===Stockholm, early recordings and London (1980–1981)===
When they moved to Stockholm, the bandmembers lived mostly on the street, begging for money, except Andy McCoy, who lived with his wealthy girlfriend. In November 1980, the band struck a deal with Johanna Kustannus and released its debut single, &quot;I Want You / Kill City Kills&quot;. &quot;I Want You&quot; was a new version of the Swedish song &quot;Vill ha dej&quot; by Heartbreak. McCoy had translated the song, whose title means &quot;I Want You&quot; in Swedish, into English and claimed it as his own. &quot;Kill City Kills&quot; was one of McCoy&#x27;s oldest songs, which he had written when he was hanging around at a Finnish apartment block called Kill City. Gyp Casino was the band&#x27;s drummer but did not play on the single as he was recording with another band in Stockholm.

The band launched a 102-day tour in January 1981, which is believed to be the longest rock tour in Finnish history. The tour developed the band&#x27;s energetic and wild playing style, which audiences were slow to find pleasing but later praised the band for.

The second single &quot;Tragedy / Café Avenue&quot;, written by McCoy when he was fifteen or sixteen years old, was released in February 1981. That same month, the band released its debut album, &quot;Bangkok Shocks, Saigon Shakes, Hanoi Rocks&quot;, produced by Michael Monroe and Andy McCoy, calling themselves &quot;The Muddy Twins.&quot; The album was well-received, reaching number five on the Finnish album charts.

In September 1981, after extensive tours in Sweden and Finland, the band moved to London, where they recorded their second album. On 19 September 1981, the band made their debut at the Marquee Club in London. In late November they returned to Finland and released the single &quot;Desperados / Devil Woman&quot;. Another single, &quot;Dead by X-Mas / Nothing New&quot;, was released in December.

===&quot;Oriental Beat&quot; and Razzle joins (1982)===
In January 1982, Hanoi Rocks recorded their first music videos at the Lepakko, a concert venue and centre of independent youth culture, for the songs &quot;Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Oriental Beat&quot;, and &quot;Motorvatin&#x27;&quot;. That same month, the band released their second album &quot;Oriental Beat&quot;. The album was mostly well received by critics and magazines, including &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, whose Dave Dickson continued to extensively cover Hanoi Rocks&#x27;s career in the 1980s. The band spent the spring of 1982 touring in Sweden, and had their first Japanese breakthrough with &quot;Tragedy.&quot; In May, the single &quot;Love&#x27;s an Injection / Taxi Driver&quot; was released.

By June 1982, the band had permanently moved to London. Monroe met a Hanoi Rocks fan called Razzle at a Johnny Thunders show. When Razzle, who was the drummer for London punk band The Dark, found out that Monroe was the singer for Hanoi Rocks, he attended some shows, showed up backstage, and asked to be the band&#x27;s drummer. McCoy and Monroe fired Gyp Casino for his drug use, depression, and suicidal thoughts, and Razzle was hired as the new drummer.

In August 1982, Hanoi Rocks released their third studio album, &quot;Self Destruction Blues&quot;. The album featured old singles like &quot;Love&#x27;s an Injection&quot;. Razzle had yet to join the band when the songs were recorded, but he is credited on the album. The album was released in October in Finland, with &quot;Love&#x27;s an Injection&quot; spending a week at number one on the Finnish singles charts. The band also signed a contract with the Japanese record company Nippon Phonogram.

===Tour in Asia, &quot;Back to Mystery City&quot; and a deal with CBS (1983)===
By January 1983, the band was touring outside of the UK, Finland, and Sweden. The Asian tour was largely covered by British magazines, and the band was featured on the cover of &quot;Sounds&quot;. The tour started in Bombay, continuing in Hong Kong and Japan. In Japan the band was very popular, with fans breaking into hotels to see the musicians. The ticket prices for the show were as high as for stadium-fillers, and some phone booths in Tokyo played Hanoi Rocks songs. The tour continued from Tokyo to Vietnam.

In April, the band returned to London for the recording of their fourth album, and then went to Israel, where they were not well received. Monroe could not leave the band&#x27;s hotel room because of his somewhat unconventional appearance: local people thought he was an improperly-dressed woman and would gather around and spit on him. Also, Nasty Suicide broke his ankle; and people did not like the band&#x27;s loud playing style. In late spring, Hanoi Rocks toured London and Norway, and released a single before the new album, &quot;Malibu Beach / Rebel On The Run&quot;.

The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Back to Mystery City&quot;, was released shortly afterward. It reached number 87 on the UK Albums Chart. Hanoi Rocks toured the UK and in Finland until June 1983, when the band made a deal with CBS worth £150,000.

===Bob Ezrin and &quot;All Those Wasted Years&quot; (1983–1984)===
In August 1983, Hanoi Rocks released the 7&quot; single &quot;Until I Get You / Tragedy&quot;, and the 12&quot; maxi-single &quot;Until I Get You / Tragedy / Oriental Beat.&quot; On 13 August, Lick Records released Hanoi Rocks&#x27;s first three albums in Britain for the first time. The next day, the band played a show at the Ruisrock festival in Turku, Finland. Before the show, Michael Monroe stated in an interview with the Finnish television station YLE that McCoy and Suicide&#x27;s alcohol use had gotten out of hand, and that he did not drink or use drugs. In October 1983, producer Bob Ezrin flew from the US to see Hanoi Rocks live in London, and in December he was confirmed as the producer for the next album.

Their December shows at Marquee were recorded and released as a live album and an accompanying live video, both titled &quot;All Those Wasted Years&quot;.

===&quot;Two Steps from the Move&quot; (1984)===
In early 1984, Hanoi Rocks and Bob Ezrin recorded &quot;Two Steps from the Move&quot;, in New York and Toronto. Ezrin had invited Ian Hunter of Mott the Hoople to help with the songwriting, and Hunter brought Jack Bruce (formerly of Cream), who in turn brought Pete Brown, to the recording sessions. Brown wrote a lot of lyrics, but the only one the band used was &quot;Smoked a lot of sky, drank a lot of rain&quot;, in &quot;Million Miles Away&quot;.

By the end of April the new album was almost ready for release, but Ezrin and the label thought that the album was missing a hit, so they recorded Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Up Around the Bend&quot;, which was already a favorite of Michael Monroe and Nasty Suicide.

In May 1984, Hanoi Rocks went on tour in Bombay and Japan. In Japan, excitement over the band led to sold-out concert halls and fans following the band everywhere. Even in Finland people were baffled by the extent of the band&#x27;s popularity in Japan.

The Japanese tour was followed by a tour across England and Scotland. British magazines raved about the band, and were certain that the next record would be their breakthrough. In June, the single &quot;Up Around The Bend / Until I Get You&quot; was released, but it also appeared as a double single and as an EP. A music video for &quot;Up Around the Bend&quot; was also produced. At the time it was the most expensive music video for any Finnish band. The song climbed to number 61 on the UK singles chart, and got radio airplay in America.

After a July tour in England, &quot;Two Steps from the Move&quot;, whose title was changed from &quot;Silver Missiles and Nightingales&quot; at the last minute, was released. It was their most successful album in the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked at number 28. &quot;Underwater World / Shakes&quot; and &quot;Two Steps From the Move&quot; were released as singles in the UK, and right away the band went on tour with Johnny Thunders.

In November the single &quot;Don&#x27;t You Ever Leave Me / Oil And Gasoline&quot; was released, by which time the new album had sold 200,000 copies—most of them in the U.S. (60,000), Britain (50,000), and Finland (20,000). In the US the album sold 44,000 copies in its first two weeks.

After a Swedish tour, the band toured America until Michael Monroe fractured his ankle onstage at USA Sam&#x27;s in Syracuse, New York, on 29 November, resulting in some of the dates being canceled. Los Angeles shows were all sold out in less than half an hour.

===Razzle&#x27;s death, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Divorce&quot;, and break-up (1984–1985)===
On 8 December, Hanoi Rocks band members (except for Michael Monroe, who was recuperating from his fractured ankle) were partying with their friends Mötley Crüe, at lead singer Vince Neil&#x27;s house. The party stopped when everybody noticed they were out of beer. Neil and Razzle, both drunk, went to a nearby liquor store in Neil&#x27;s Pantera, with Neil driving. On the way back, they crashed into another car. Razzle was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead at 7:12 p.m.; he had died instantly in the collision.

Both occupants of the other car were seriously injured, sustaining brain damage as a result of the crash. Andy McCoy and Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee went looking for Neil and Razzle. They drove by the crash site and saw Neil handcuffed and put into a police car. They were informed that Razzle had been taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. McCoy informed the band&#x27;s manager Seppo Vesterinen, who then told the rest of the band. The band returned to London. The only tour dates not canceled were two shows at Helsinki Kulttuuritalo on 3 and 4 January 1985, which were broadcast live under the title of &quot;Europe A Go-Go&quot; to a worldwide audience of 200 million viewers. Both shows became memorials to Razzle, with &quot;Million Miles Away&quot; dedicated to him. Former Clash drummer Terry Chimes played the drums.

In 1985, after the shows, Sam Yaffa left the group due to personal differences with Andy McCoy. The band returned to London to take a short break. Yaffa was replaced by bassist René Berg. Terry Chimes remained as the new drummer. Monroe planned to quit, but the record label convinced him to do a short tour in Poland, where &quot;Don&#x27;t You Ever Leave Me&quot; was rising on the charts. Monroe agreed on the condition that no live record would be released, but a semi-official live album was released. Entitled &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Divorce&quot;, the album was panned by the managers, band members and critics. René Berg often stated that Hanoi Rocks was &quot;his band&quot;, which led to his replacement by bassist Timo Kaltio. This line-up never performed live, and on 17 June 1985, Monroe officially left Hanoi Rocks, ending the band. At the same time, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Ever Leave Me&quot; rose to number 6 on the Polish singles chart and Hanoi Rocks&#x27;s popularity continued into the 1990s.

===Rebirth and new success (2001–2007)===

In February 2001, Monroe and McCoy performed together for the first time since 1985 in Turku, Finland. They toured again in the summer of 2001, under the moniker &quot;Hanoi Revisited&quot;.

After the short tour, Monroe and McCoy agreed to reform the band. This would be (as the two put it), a &quot;rebirth&quot;, not a reformation of Hanoi Rocks, mainly because none of the other members were able to join: Razzle was dead; Nasty Suicide had become a pharmacist; Sami Yaffa was a member of a New York-based group called Mad Juana and the bassist for the New York Dolls; and Gyp Casino was no longer active in music. &quot;The Muddy Twins&quot; chose Kari &quot;Lacu&quot; Lahtinen from Monroe&#x27;s solo band to play the drums, Timpa Laine (also from Monroe&#x27;s solo band) to play the bass, and Costello Hautamäki from the Finnish rock band Popeda to play guitar.

The new Hanoi Rocks toured. McCoy and Monroe made a deal that they would be equal writers on songs, and not just McCoy. By 2002, the two had written enough songs for an album, and &quot;Twelve Shots on the Rocks&quot; was released. Although the album was a hit in Finland and Japan, Monroe and McCoy were not present when the album was mixed, and when they heard the finished product they were not happy. The album was remixed in 2003, featuring two new songs, &quot;Moonlite Dance&quot; and &quot;Bad News&quot;.

Most of 2003 and 2004 consisted of touring, but Costello departed to continue his work with Popeda. Costello was replaced by guitarist Stevie Klasson, whose only recording with Hanoi Rocks was the &quot;Keep Our Fire Burning&quot; single. Klasson was fired from Hanoi Rocks in the fall of 2004 for not getting along with other members. Bassist Timpa left because of family issues.

In 2004 the band (now consisting of Monroe, McCoy and Lacu) headed to the studio to record the album &quot;Another Hostile Takeover&quot;. With no bassist and no guitarist, Monroe had to play some of the bass and guitar parts, but in early 2005 the band was able to find a new guitarist, Conny Bloom. Bloom had played with Gyp Casino and the Electric Boys and fit well with Hanoi Rocks. He suggested that bassist Andy &quot;A.C.&quot; Christell, who had also played with the Electric Boys, should join the band.

The reaction to &quot;Another Hostile Takeover&quot; was mixed. Critics liked the album&#x27;s diversity and braveness to try new things, but some of the old fans and hard rock fans thought that the album was weird and that Hanoi Rocks had changed too much since the 1980s.

In 2005 and 2006, the band toured in Europe and Asia.

On 18 August 2007 the band perform their new single &#x27;Fashion&#x27; on Swedish Saturday live TV show Sommarkrysset (TV4). For 2007&#x27;s &quot;Street Poetry&quot; the band worked on some of the unfinished songs from the 1980s, such as &quot;Teenage Revolution&quot;, which was first thought of during the &quot;Two Steps from the Move&quot; sessions in 1984. This album also marked the first time that other band members besides Monroe and McCoy were permitted to write songs. &quot;Street Poetry&quot; was released on 5 September 2007, and a music video was shot for the first single, &quot;Fashion&quot;.

===The final break-up (2008–2009)===
On 25 January 2008 Lacu suddenly announced that he was going to leave Hanoi Rocks to join Popeda. On 20 March, the band started their first acoustic tour, titled “Hanoi Rocks Steppin’ Out Acoustically”, during which the band&#x27;s drum technician played drums. On 25 May, it was announced that the band&#x27;s new drummer would be Swedish drummer George Atlagic. By this time Monroe and McCoy had come to the decision that Hanoi Rocks&#x27;s time had come to an end, as they no longer had collaborated since 2007 and things were getting stale. Eventually Monroe and McCoy released a statement that they had taken the band as far as they could and that the band would break up.

In late 2008 an autobiography titled &quot;All Those Wasted Years&quot; was released. It mainly covered Hanoi Rocks&#x27;s career in the 1980s and included rare photos of the band and its members and new interviews with Monroe, McCoy, Nasty Suicide, Gyp Casino, Seppo Vesterinen, Richard Bishop and countless others.

Hanoi Rocks did a farewell tour in Japan in spring of 2009 where they played six shows. Tokyo&#x27;s Studio Coast on 8.3.2009, Fukuoka&#x27;s Drum Logos on 10.3.2009, Osaka&#x27;s Namba Hatch on 11.3.2009, Nagoya&#x27;s Diamond Hall on 12.3.2009, Kawasaki&#x27;s Club Citta on 13.3.2009 and finally Sendai&#x27;s Zepp Sendai on 15.3.2009. A rare farewell tour of Japan 2009 book was released of the Japan tour which included many old band photos and history information about the band and the albums they recorded.

Hanoi Rocks announced that they would play eight farewell shows over six days at the Tavastia Club in Helsinki. All the shows were sold out, and the band&#x27;s original guitarist Nasty Suicide appeared as a special guest in three of the last gigs, and Lacu also appeared at the final show.

The last show was released as a DVD in late 2009, titled &quot;Buried Alive&quot;.

=== Second reunion (2022) ===
On 23 September 2022, an early line-up of Michael Monroe, Andy McCoy, Nasty Suicide, Sami Yaffa and Gyp Casino reunited in celebration of Monroe&#x27;s 60th birthday, at the Helsinki Ice Hall.

==Legacy==

Although Hanoi Rocks never achieved huge commercial success, they have a very big cult following and they have received critical acclaim for their musical style and energetic live performances. On 5 January 1985, Hanoi Rocks was featured in almost every category in a poll cast by &quot;Sounds&quot;, including Best Album (5th), Best Band (2nd) and Best Live Act (3rd).

Hanoi Rocks&#x27;s influence can be seen in various bands, including Guns N&#x27; Roses, and their glam look has been used by many bands, including Poison, L.A. Guns and Ratt. Other bands like Manic Street Preachers, Murderdolls, Skid Row and the Foo Fighters have acknowledged being Hanoi Rocks fans. Alice in Chains also often played Hanoi Rocks&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; live in their early days. Other Finnish rock groups that were influenced by Hanoi Rocks include The 69 Eyes (with whom McCoy has also worked) and Negative. In Finland, Hanoi Rocks is known as the Finnish rock band who, at their time, had come closest to real international fame, only much later giving way to such groups as HIM, Nightwish, Sonata Arctica, Stratovarius, Children of Bodom and Turisas.

Hanoi Rocks also brought the glam rock look of the 1970s back into style. In 2003, when Nasty Suicide was asked about the band&#x27;s look, he said that he and Michael Monroe decided to keep the punk leather jackets but bring a kind of &quot;transvestite vibe to it&quot;.

Even though Hanoi Rocks influenced many 1980s glam bands, some feel that these bands ripped off Hanoi Rocks. In 2008 Joe Elliott, frontman of English hard rock band Def Leppard, described his dislike of 1980s glam metal bands like Mötley Crüe and Poison, and said this about Hanoi Rocks:

Michael Monroe and Hanoi Rocks have influenced many rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll artists and bands: Slash and Duff McKagan had bought tickets to the sold-out gigs in Los Angeles, which were canceled because of the death of Razzle. In the Hanoi Rocks autobiography &quot;All Those Wasted Years&quot; Foo Fighters guitarist Chris Shiflett says &quot;The Hollywood scene changed in just one night after people saw the pictures of Hanoi Rocks. After that everyone was wearing the same kind of hair, clothes and make up as Monroe&quot;. Michael Monroe and Hanoi Rocks have often been mentioned as the starters of the Hollywood&#x27;s glam-rock scene, which was then adopted and developed by many 1980s glam, punk, and hard rock bands like Mötley Crüe, Jetboy, LA Guns and Poison.

Hanoi Rocks is cited as one of the most influential glam metal bands of all time in the documentary movie.

American TV Channel VH1 named the top &quot;hair bands&quot; of all time, and Hanoi Rocks was at number 40. When Sam Yaffa was asked about it, he replied: &quot;We were a hat band, not a hair band!&quot;.

In 2013, American newspaper LA Weekly listed Hanoi Rocks at number 1 on their list of the &quot;15 Best Hair Metal Bands of All Time&quot;.

Andy McCoy has said that the Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Paradise City&quot; is a compilation of a few riffs of Hanoi Rocks. He said the chorus is the same as the riff in &quot;Lost in the City&quot;, just slowed down. Nasty Suicide can also be seen in the music video for &quot;Paradise City&quot;.

The Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Right Next Door to Hell&quot; was co-written by former Hanoi Rocks bassist Timo Kaltio.

Hanoi Rocks is mentioned in the Bret Michaels song &quot;Human Zoo&quot; on his 1998 soundtrack album, &quot;A Letter from Death Row&quot;.

Hanoi Rocks is mentioned in the NOFX song &quot;We Got Two Jealous Agains&quot; on their 2003 album The War on Errorism.

Hanoi Rocks is mentioned in the Red House Painters song &quot;Cruiser&quot; on their 2001 album Old Ramon.

The fictional character Peacemaker mentions Hanoi Rocks as &quot;only the greatest band of all time&quot; in the eponymous 2022 TV series. The same episode also features Hanoi Rocks songs &quot;11th Street Kids&quot; and &quot;Fallen Star&quot;.

<text>Nyenschantz (; ; ) was a Swedish fortress at the confluence of the Neva River and Okhta River, the site of present-day Saint Petersburg, Russia. Nyenschantz was built in 1611 to establish Swedish rule in Ingria, which had been annexed from the Tsardom of Russia during the Time of Troubles. The town of Nyen, which formed around Nyenschantz, became a wealthy trading center and a capital of Swedish Ingria during the 17th century. In 1702, Nyenschantz and Nyen were conquered by Russia during the Great Northern War, and the new Russian capital of Saint Petersburg was established here by Peter the Great the following year.

==History==
===The fortress Landskrona===
During excavations in 1992–2000, the remnants of three different medieval fortresses were found at the site of the Nyenschantz fortress. The only one known historically is the Swedish fortress Landskrona, built in 1300 by Tyrgils Knutsson, the Lord High Constable of Sweden. Landskrona was an enormous and unusually well-fortified wooden fortress with eight towers. In the spring of 1301, the Russians amassed a large army and laid siege to the fortress. The Swedes retreated to the basement when a fire broke out inside the fortress. The last of the Swedish defenders were captured, and the Russians burned down the fortress.

===Background===
In 1609, the Treaty of Viborg was signed by Sweden and Tsardom of Russia as a package of military agreements that were supposed to be mutually beneficial. It was signed by King Charles IX of Sweden and Vasili IV (also known as Vasily Shuisky) of Russia in the Swedish city of Viborg, located on the Karelian Isthmus close to Russian territory. The treaty came at an unstable period in Russian history known as the Time of Troubles, where the death of Tsar Feodor I in 1598 led to decades of civil war. In 1605, following the death of &quot;de facto&quot; ruler Boris Godunov, Vasily Shuisky came to power, triggering a conflict with a pretender to the Russian throne, False Dmitry II. Additionally, Russia began fighting the Polish–Russian War following the invasion of the country by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth the same year. Sweden itself was fighting against the Poles in the Polish–Swedish War and viewed their eastward expansion into Russian lands as a security threat. The terms of the Treaty of Viborg stipulated that Sweden would supply a corps of mercenaries to Shuisky to fight False Dmitry II and the Poles in exchange for Swedish control of the nearby strategic Korela Fortress, as well as its town Kexholm and the respective county. Shuisky agreed to the terms but was an unpopular ruler with little power. Shortly after signing the Treaty of Viborg, Russia&#x27;s fortunes began to rise, and Shuisky was forced out of power in 1610. A coalition between Swedish general Jacob de la Gardie and Russian princes launched the De la Gardie Campaign, effectively defeating False Dmitry II.

===Nyenskans===

The Ingrian War was triggered in 1610 as the new stability of Russia led to increased resistance to Polish occupation and Swedish influence in the country. As the Polish occupation of Moscow had ended, Russia began to actively resist the Swedish influence as they sought to regain control over occupied territories, including the province of Ingria, which Sweden insisted on keeping based on Russia violating conditions in the Treaty of Viborg. Sweden constructed a fortress in Ingria at a strategic position at the confluence of the prominent Neva River and one of its tributaries, the Okhta River. The new fort was officially named Nyenskans, derived from the Swedish terms &quot;Nyen&quot;-, the name for the Neva, and -&quot;skans&quot; meaning &quot;bastion&quot;, and was capable of housing 500 people. The Ingrian War ended in Swedish victory in 1617 after the signing of the Treaty of Stolbovo, resulting in Russia ceding the territories to Sweden. In 1632, the settlement of Nyen was developed across the Okhta from Nyenskans, which was granted town privileges and became the administrative centre of Swedish Ingria in 1642. By the mid-17th century, Nyen had prospered as a trading hub with around 2,000 people, making it much more prominent and wealthier than Swedish Ingria&#x27;s new capital, Nöteborg. According to church records, the town&#x27;s population was primarily made up of Finns, secondarily Swedes, and some Germans. Around this time, Nyen&#x27;s governor, John Geselia the Younger, banned Orthodox Christian Swedish subjects from settling in or near the town following tensions with Lutherans. The ban on Orthodox residents effectively cleansed Nyen of ethnic Russian, Izhorian, and Karelian inhabitants.

In 1656, Nyenskans was attacked by Russia during an invasion led by Pyotr Potemkin. The attack was repelled, but it badly damaged Nyen, and Sweden moved the administrative centre of Swedish Ingria from Nöteborg to Narva.

In 1677, the defences of Nyenskans and Nyen were enforced by a ring of new fortifications consisting of lunettes with batteries and moats. By the end of the 17th century, Nyenskans entered its final form after it had been modernized by an extensive project led by engineer Heinrich von Soylenberg. The fort was expanded to house 600 people, converted into a star fort featuring five wooden and earthen bastions, two additional ravelins, crownworks along the bastions not pointing towards the rivers, and a smaller accompanying half-fort built on the opposite bank of the Neva. Upon the completion of the project, Nyenskans was thought by Sweden to be the most modern fortress in the world at the time. By the turn of the 18th century, numerous Swedish and Finnish suburban manors were built outside the Nyen fortification ring. Most were along the Neva, some of which were located at a considerable distance from the city. 

In 1700, the danger of Russian invasion increased following the beginning of the Great Northern War, which resumed formal hostilities between Sweden and Russia. Reportedly, in October 1702, Sweden feared an imminent Russian invasion of Nyen, evacuating the city&#x27;s population and burning it down to prevent the Russians from taking it. 

===Saint Petersburg===
On May 1, 1703, Sweden lost Nyenskans to the Russians when the fortress was taken by Peter the Great during the Ingrian campaign of the Great Northern War. The site of Nyenskans and Nyen was reformed by Peter into the new city of Schlötburg, meaning &quot;&quot;Neck-town&quot; in German, a reference to the long, narrow section of the Neva where it was located, with &quot;Schlöt&quot;&quot; corresponding to &quot;(funnel) neck, narrows, chimney&quot;. Schlötburg stood in contrast to Shlisselburg (&quot;Key-town&quot;), the new name for Nöteborg at the other end of the Neva River, which Peter believed was the &quot;Key to Ingria&quot;. The last Swedish commandant of Nyenskans was Colonel Johan Apolloff, who was preceded by Colonel Alexander Pereswetoff-Morath, a descendant of Russian noblemen, boyars, who had entered Swedish service in the first decades of the 17th century. Nyenskans, under the name Schlötburg, functioned in Russian service only for some weeks before it was retired as an active military garrison. 

In 1703, Peter decided to found Saint Petersburg, a brand new capital city for the Tsardom of Russia, from scratch in the Neva River delta on the land around Nyenskans. Peter had disliked Moscow, Russia&#x27;s largest city and historical capital, which he considered inconveniently located and too isolated from the rest of Europe. He also had an interest in seafaring and maritime affairs, believing Russia needed a new port city to replace Arkhangelsk, which he similarly considered to be inconveniently located. Technically, the land still officially belonged to Sweden and was occupied during fighting in the Great Northern War, but despite this, construction of the city began anyway.

The exact fate of Nyenskans is unknown, with sources ranging from its almost complete demolition as early as 1704 to its repurposing and remaining intact as late as the 1760s. Other documents and maps suggest Nyenskans was gradually demolished over the following decades as Saint Petersburg expanded onto the land in the direct vicinity of the fort. By 1849, the central strengthening of Nyenskans was still known to exist, although the exact date of its demolition is also unknown.

Today, nothing above the ground remains of Nyenskans, and the site is now in Saint Petersburg&#x27;s Krasnogvardeysky District. On June 15, 2000, a monument designed by V. A. Reppo was opened on the site of the fortress. In May 2003, on the 300th anniversary of Saint Petersburg, the museum &quot;700 years: Landskrona, the Neva Mouth, Nyenschantz&quot; was opened at the site of the fortress. In early 2007, the remains of Nyenskans&#x27; bastions were identified during archaeological excavations, which were necessitated by the threat of irrecoverable exploitation of the entire site to development from the territory of demolished shipyard Petrozavod to the grounds for planned skyscraper headquarters of the Moscow-based national natural gas monopoly Gazprom, Okhta Center, that would dwarf the beautiful cityscape. This caused protests from the city conservation activists, but they defended the location only after archeologists found remains of the star fort and preceding structures. Gazprom eventually moved the construction site to the northwest outskirt of the city Lakhta (from Finnish &quot;lahti&quot; &quot;bay, inlet&quot;), and the skyscraper crosscut as a star fort is now known as Lakhta Center. It may also hold public activity and leisure spaces as well as offices.
