==Mission highlights==
STS-72, the 74th flight of the Space Shuttle program and the 10th of the orbiter &quot;Endeavour&quot; was launched at 4:41AM EST 11 January 1996 after a brief hold at the T−5-minute mark due to communication issues. The nighttime launch window was in support of the mission&#x27;s primary objective, the capture and return to Earth of a Japanese microgravity research spacecraft known as Space Flyer Unit (SFU). The SFU was launched by Japan&#x27;s National Space Development Agency (NASDA) from Tanegashima Space Center in Japan on 18 March 1995 aboard a Japanese H-II rocket (HII-3), and spent ten months in orbit conducting automated research in materials science, biology, engineering, and astronomy. Mission Specialist Koichi Wakata operated the orbiter&#x27;s remote manipulator system arm on flight day three to pluck SFU from orbit. Both of the satellite&#x27;s solar arrays had to be jettisoned prior to retrieval when sensors indicated improper latching following their retraction. This jettison procedure had been incorporated in preflight training as a contingency in the event of such an occurrence. The canisters housing the arrays were jettisoned 12 minutes apart as &quot;Endeavour&quot; and the SFU traveled across Africa on the thirtieth orbit of the mission. The contingency procedure delayed the capture of the satellite by about an hour and half. Once in &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s payload bay, the satellite&#x27;s internal batteries were bypassed following connection of a remotely operated electrical cable to the side of the satellite. On this mission, Daniel T. Barry and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata were the first people to play Go in space; for this achievement, both Barry and Wakata received the honorary awards of Ni Dan rank by the Nihon Ki-in making Barry one of only four Western Go players to receive such an award. Barry and Wakata used a special Go set, which was named Go Space, designed by Wai-Cheung Willson Chow.

==OAST-Flyer==

The STS-72 mission also flew with the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology Flyer (OAST-Flyer) spacecraft. OAST-Flyer was the seventh in a series of missions aboard the reusable free-flying Spartan carrier spacecraft series. It consisted of four experiments: Return Flux Experiment (REFLEX) to test accuracy of computer models predicting spacecraft exposure to contamination; Global Positioning System Attitude Determination and Control Experiment (GADACS) to demonstrate GPS technology in space; Solar Exposure to Laser Ordnance Device (SELODE) to test laser ordnance devices; Spartan Packet Radio Experiment (SPRE) and the Amateur Radio Association at the University of Maryland (W3EAX) amateur radio communications experiment. On flight day four, Wakata again operated Endeavour&#x27;s robot arm to deploy the Spartan, sending the experiment-laden platform on its way to a 50-hour free-flight at a distance of approximately 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the orbiter. OAST-Flyer was retrieved on flight day six, with Wakata again operating the remote manipulator system arm to retrieve the platform.

==Spacewalks==

Two 6.5-hour spacewalks were conducted by three astronauts to test hardware and tools to be used in the assembly of the International Space Station starting in late 1998. EVA-1 on flight day five consisted of Crewmembers Leroy Chiao (EV1) and Dan Barry (EV2). After taking a few minutes to acclimate themselves in the payload bay, first-time spacewalkers Chiao and Barry attached a portable work platform to the end of the robot arm, operated by Pilot Brent Jett and Mission Specialist Koichi Wakata. Jett used the arm to grapple various pieces of hardware designed to hold large modular components, mimicking the way equipment boxes and avionics gear will be moved back and forth in assembling the Space Station.

Chiao and Barry then unfolded a cable tray diagonally across the forward portion of the cargo bay housing simulated electrical and fluid lines similar to those which would later connect modules and nodes of the Space Station. The rigid umbilical, as it is known, was tested for its ease of handling and the ability of the astronauts to hook up the lines to connectors on the side of Endeavour&#x27;s bay. While Chiao unraveled various lengths of cable from a caddy device, Barry spent time practicing the hookup of the various cables in the rigid umbilical to connectors in the bay, testing his ability to manipulate tiny bolts and screws in weightlessness. He reported that most tasks could be accomplished with little difficulty. Barry and Chiao then traded places, as Barry mounted the portable work platform to evaluate its worth. The first EVA lasted 6 hours, 9 minutes. EVA-2 on Flight Day 7 consisted of Leroy Chiao (EV1) and Winston Scott (EV2), lasting 6 hours, 53 minutes. Chiao and Scott worked with utility boxes, slidewires and a portable work stanchion affixed to &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s robot arm to gather additional data on methods and procedures which would be incorporated in the techniques used to assemble the International Space Station. Late in the spacewalk, Scott climbed into foot restraints on the OAST-Flyer satellite platform for a thermal evaluation exercise. &quot;Endeavour&quot; was maneuvered to the coldest position possible, with its payload bay facing out toward deep space and allowing temperatures to dip to about 104 degrees below zero at the point where Scott was positioned to test the ability of his spacesuit to repel the bitter cold temperature of space.

==Additional payloads==
Other experiments onboard STS-72 included the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Experiment (SSBUV-8) (previously flown on STS-34, STS-41, STS-43, STS-45, STS-56, STS-62 and STS-66), EDFT-03, Shuttle Laser Altimeter Payload (SLA-01/GAS(5)), VDA-2, National Institutes of Health NIH-R3 Experiment, Space Tissue Loss Experiment (STL/NIH-C), Pool Boiling Experiment (PBE) (hardware previously flown on STS-47, STS-57 and STS-60) and the Thermal Energy Storage (TES-2) experiment (previously flown on STS-69).
Get Away Special payloads included the United States Air Force Academy G-342 Flexible Beam Experiment (FLEXBEAM-2), Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies&#x27; G-459 – Protein Crystal Growth Experiment and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory GAS Ballast Can with Sample Return Experiment.

==Documentary==
The crew of STS-72 and their families were followed by a camera crew from PBS from the day they were assigned to the flight and then through their training and, finally, the mission itself. The result was a 90-minute documentary narrated by Bill Nye titled &quot;Astronauts&quot; which first aired on PBS on 17 July 1997 and was later released on VHS home video.

In December 2020, photographer John Angerson released unseen photos of mission preparation.

<text>STS-76 was NASA&#x27;s 76th Space Shuttle mission, and the 16th mission for &quot;Atlantis&quot;. STS-76 launched on 22 March 1996 at 08:13:04 UTC from Kennedy Space Center, launch pad 39B. STS-76 lasted over 9 days, traveled about while orbiting Earth an estimated 145 times, and landing at 13:28:57 UTC on 31 March 1996 at Edwards Air Force Base, runway 22.

The flight was the third Shuttle mission to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir, as part of the Shuttle–Mir program, carrying astronaut Shannon Lucid to the orbital laboratory to replace NASA astronaut Norman Thagard. STS-76 also carried a SPACEHAB single module along with Lucid, and on flight day 6, Linda M. Godwin and Michael R. Clifford performed the first U.S. spacewalk around two docked spacecraft since the last Skylab mission in 1974.

== Mission highlights ==
The mission was the third linkup between a U.S. Space Shuttle and Russian space station Mir, and brought veteran astronaut Shannon Lucid to Mir to become the first American woman to live on the station. Her approximately four-and-a-half-month stay also eclipsed the long-duration U.S. spaceflight record set by the first American to live on Mir, Norman Thagard. Lucid was succeeded by astronaut John E. Blaha during STS-79 in August 1996, giving her the distinction of membership in four different flight crews — two U.S. and two Russian—and her stay on Mir kicked off the continuous U.S. presence in space for the next two years.

Payload bay configuration included the Orbiter Docking System in the forward area and a SPACEHAB single module toward the aft. STS-76 marked the first flight of a SPACEHAB pressurized module to support Shuttle-Mir dockings. The single module primarily served as a stowage area for a large supply of equipment for transfer to space station, but also carried the European Space Agency&#x27;s Biorack experiment rack for on-orbit research.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; hooked up with Mir on flight day three, following same R-bar approach employed on STS-74. Actual connection between Orbiter Docking System and the Kristall module&#x27;s docking port occurred at 02:50 UTC on 24 March 1996. Hatches opened a little less than two hours later. Awaiting &quot;Atlantis&quot; arrival were Mir 21 Commander Yury Onufriyenko and Flight Engineer Yuri Usachov, who were launched to Mir on 21 February 1996. In July, they were joined by Mir 22 Commander Valery Korzun, Flight Engineer Aleksandr Kaleri and CNES astronaut Claudie André-Deshays. After a two-week stay, André-Deshays would return to Earth with Onufriyenko and Usachov while Korzun and Kaleri remained on board with Lucid.

During five days of docked operations, about of water and two tons of scientific equipment, logistical material and resupply items were transferred to Mir. Experiment samples and miscellaneous equipment brought over to orbiter. In Biorack, 11 separate scientific investigations were conducted. Study topics included the effect of microgravity and cosmic radiation on plants, tissues, cells, bacteria and insects, and the effects of microgravity on bone loss. Also transferred to the station were the Mir Glovebox Stowage (MGBX) equipment to replenish the glovebox already on station, the Queen&#x27;s University Experiment in Liquid Diffusion (QUELD) flown in the orbiter&#x27;s middeck locker, and the High Temperature Liquid Phase Sintering (LPS) experiment.

On flight day six, Godwin and Clifford conducted what some claim to be the first U.S. extravehicular activity (EVA) around two mated spacecraft. However, this appears to ignore the Apollo 9 EVA, and EVAs during Skylab. During six-hour, two-minute, 28-second EVA, they attached four Mir Environmental Effects Payload (MEEP) experiments to the station&#x27;s docking module - designed to characterize the environment around Mir over an 18-month period. Godwin and Clifford wore Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) propulsive devices - first flight-tested during STS-64.

Other payloads included Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX), KidSat, a project that gives middle school students opportunity to participate in space exploration, and Trapped Ions in Space (TRIS), a Naval Research Laboratory experiment flown in a Getaway Special canister in the payload bay.

<text>STS-77 was the 77th Space Shuttle mission and the 11th mission of the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The mission began from launch pad 39B from Kennedy Space Center, Florida on 19 May 1996 lasting 10 days and 40 minutes and completing 161 revolutions before landing on runway 33. The defense and aerospace technology company L&#x27;Garde was responsible for the design and manufacture of the Antenna in the Inflatable Antenna Experiment, a key component of the STS-77 mission.

==Mission highlights==

NASA&#x27;s flight of shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; was devoted to opening the commercial space frontier. During the flight the crew performed microgravity research aboard the commercially owned and operated SPACEHAB module. The mission also deployed and retrieved the Spartan-207/IAE (Inflatable Antenna Experiment) satellite and rendezvoused with a test satellite. A suite of four technology experiments known as the Technology Experiments for Advancing Missions in Space (TEAMS) also flew in the Shuttle&#x27;s payload bay.

The SPACEHAB single module carried nearly of experiments and support equipment for 12 commercial space product development payloads in the areas of biotechnology, electronic materials, polymers and agriculture as well as several experiments for other NASA payload organizations. One of these, the Commercial Float Zone Facility (CFZF) was developed through international collaboration between the U.S., Canada, and Germany. It heated various samples of electronic and semiconductor material through the float-zone technique. Another facility on SPACEHAB was the Space Experiment Facility (SEF) which grew crystals by vapor diffusion.

The Goddard Space Flight Center&#x27;s (GSFC) Spartan-207 satellite was used to deploy and test the Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) which laid the groundwork for future technology development in inflatable space structures. It tested the performance of a large inflatable antenna during a ninety-minute mission. The antenna structure was then jettisoned and the SPARTAN-207 spacecraft recovered at mission end.

Inside &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s cargo bay the four TEAMS experiments operated throughout the mission. They included the Global Positioning System (GPS) Attitude and Navigation Experiment (GANE) to determine to what accuracy the GPS system can supply attitude information to a space vehicle; the Vented Tank Resupply Experiment (VTRE) to test improved methods for in-space refueling; the Liquid Metal Thermal Experiment (LMTE) to evaluate the performance of liquid metal heat pipes in microgravity conditions, and the Passive Aerodynamically Stabilized Magnetically Damped Satellite (PAMS) payload to demonstrate the technology of the principle of aerodynamic stabilization in the upper atmosphere. Cameras on the shuttle recorded the PAMS satellite as it was deployed and tracked its movements.

Secondary experiments on the flight included the Brilliant Eyes Ten Kelvin Sorption Cryocooler Experiment (BETSCE), the Aquatic Research Facility (ARF) and the Biological Research In a Canister (BRIC) experiment.

Also onboard was the Plant-Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (P-GBA) designed by BioServe Space Technologies. Several plant species were flown in this double middeck locker configurated plant growth chamber. Investigations on plant growth in micro-gravity as well as research on the feasibility of agriculture in space were successfully carried out.

A Coca-Cola fountain dispenser (officially a Fluids Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus-2 or FGBA-2) was developed for use on STS-77 as a test bed to determine if carbonated beverages can be produced from separately stored carbon dioxide, water and flavored syrups and determine if the resulting fluids can be made available for consumption without bubble nucleation and resulting foam formation. The unit held each of Coca-Cola and Diet Coke. The original FGBA flew on STS-63.

<text>The Piazza dei Miracoli (; &#x27;Square of Miracles&#x27;), formally known as Piazza del Duomo (&#x27;Cathedral Square&#x27;), is a walled compound in central Pisa, Tuscany, Italy, recognized as an important center of European medieval art and one of the finest architectural complexes in the world. It was all owned by the Catholic Church and is dominated by four great religious edifices: Pisa Cathedral, the Pisa Baptistery, the Leaning Tower of Pisa (the cathedral&#x27;s campanile or bell tower), and the Camposanto Monumentale (&#x27;Monumental Cemetery&#x27;). Partly paved and partly grassed, the Piazza dei Miracoli is also the site of the Ospedale Nuovo di Santo Spirito (&#x27;New Hospital of the Holy Spirit&#x27;), which now houses the Sinopias Museum () and the Cathedral Museum ().

The square&#x27;s popular name was coined by the Italian writer and poet Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio who, in his novel &quot;Forse che sì forse che no&quot; (1910), described the square as the &quot;&quot;, or &#x27;meadow of miracles&#x27;. It is also sometimes called the Campo dei Miracoli (&#x27;Field of Miracles&#x27;). In 1987, the whole square was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Cathedral ==
The Piazza del Duomo is dominated by Pisa Cathedral (the Duomo), the medieval cathedral of the Archdiocese of Pisa, dedicated to Santa Maria Assunta (Saint Mary of the Assumption). The cathedral has two aisles on either side of the nave. The transept consists of three aisles. The church is known also as the &quot;Primatial&quot;, the archbishop of Pisa having been a Primate since 1092.

Its construction began in 1064 to the designs of the architect Buscheto. It set the model for the distinctive Pisan Romanesque style of architecture. The mosaics of the interior, as well as the pointed arches, show a strong Byzantine influence.

The façade, of grey marble and white stone set with discs of coloured marble, was built by a master named Rainaldo, as indicated by an inscription above the middle door: &quot;Rainaldus prudens operator&quot;.

The massive bronze main doors were made in the workshops of Giambologna, replacing the original doors destroyed in a fire in 1595. The original central door was of bronze, executed around 1180 by Bonanno Pisano, while the other two were probably of wood. However, worshippers have never used the façade doors to enter, instead entering by way of the &quot;Porta di San Ranieri&quot; (Saint Ranieri&#x27;s Door), in front of the Leaning Tower, built around 1180 by Bonanno Pisano.
Above the doors are four rows of open galleries with, on top, statues of the Madonna with Child and, on the corners, the Four Evangelists.

Also in the façade is found the tomb of Buscheto (on the left side) and an inscription about the foundation of the cathedral and the victorious battle against the Saracens.

At the east end of the exterior, high on a column rising from the gable, is a modern replica of the Pisa Griffin, the largest known Islamic metal sculpture, the original of which was placed there probably in the 11th or 12th century, and is now in the Cathedral Museum.

The interior is faced with black and white marble and has a gilded ceiling and a frescoed dome. It was largely redecorated after a fire in 1595, which destroyed most of the Renaissance artworks.

The impressive mosaic of &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot;, in the apse, flanked by the &quot;Virgin and Saint John the Evangelist&quot;, survived the fire. It evokes the mosaics in the church of Monreale, Sicily. Although it is said that the mosaic was the work of Cimabue, only the head of Saint John was executed by that artist in 1302, his last work, since he died in Pisa the same year. The cupola, at the intersection of the nave and transept, was decorated by Riminaldi showing the assumption of the Virgin.
Galileo is believed to have formulated his theory about the movement of a pendulum by watching the swinging of the incense lamp (not the present one) hanging from the ceiling of the nave. That lamp, smaller and simpler than the present one, is now kept in the Camposanto, in the Aulla chapel.

The granite Corinthian columns between the nave and the aisle came originally from the mosque of Palermo, captured by the Pisans in 1063.

The coffered ceiling of the nave was replaced after the fire of 1595. The present gold-decorated ceiling carries the coat of arms of the Medici.
The elaborately carved pulpit (1302–1310), which also survived the fire, was executed by Giovanni Pisano, and is a masterpiece of medieval sculpture. Having been packed away during the redecoration, it was not rediscovered and restored until 1926. The pulpit is supported by plain columns (two of which are mounted on lion&#x27;s sculptures) on one side and by caryatids and a telamon on the other: the latter represent Saint Michael, the Evangelists, the four cardinal virtues flanking the church, and a bold, naturalistic depiction of a naked Hercules. A central plinth with the liberal arts supports the four theological virtues.

The present-day pulpit is a reconstruction of the original. It does not lie in its original position, which was nearer the main altar, and the columns and panels are not original. The original stairs (perhaps of marble) were lost.

The upper part has nine narrative panels showing scenes from the New Testament, carved in white marble with a chiaroscuro effect and separated by figures of prophets: the Annunciation, the Massacre of the Innocents, the Nativity, Adoration of the Magi, the Flight into Egypt, the Crucifixion, and two panels of the Last Judgement.

The church also contains the bones of Saint Ranieri, Pisa&#x27;s patron saint, and the tomb of Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII, carved by Tino da Camaino in 1315. That tomb, originally in the apse just behind the main altar, was disassembled and moved many times over the centuries for political reasons. While the sarcophagus is still in the cathedral, some of the statues were put in the Camposanto or at the top of the cathedral&#x27;s façade. The original statues are now in the Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo.

Pope Gregory VIII was also buried in the cathedral. The fire of 1595 destroyed his tomb.

The cathedral has a prominent role in determining the beginning of the Pisan New Year. Between the tenth century and 1749, when the Tuscan calendar was reformed, Pisa used its own calendar, in which the first day of the year was March 25, the feast day of the Annunciation of Mary. Years were counted such that the Pisan New Year begins nine months before the ordinary one. The exact moment is determined by a ray of sun that, through a window on the left side, falls on an egg-shaped marble, just above the pulpit by Giovanni Pisano; this occurs at noon.

Some relics brought back during the Crusades can also be found in the cathedral: alleged remains of three saints (Abibo, Gamaliel, and Nicodemus), and a vase that is said to be one of the jars of Cana.

The building, as have several in Pisa, has tilted slightly since its construction, though not nearly to the extent of the nearby Tower.

== Baptistery ==
The Baptistery, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, stands opposite the west end of the Duomo. The round Romanesque building was begun in the mid 12th century: &quot;1153 Mense August fundata fuit haec&quot; (&quot;In the month of August 1153 was set up here...&quot;). It was built in Romanesque style by an architect known as Diotisalvi (&quot;God Save You&quot;), who worked also in the church of the Holy Sepulchre in the city. His name is mentioned on a pillar inside, as &quot;Diotosalvi magister&quot;. the construction was not, however, finished until the 14th century, when the loggia, the top storey and the dome were added in Gothic style by Nicola Pisano and Giovanni Pisano.

It is the largest baptistery in Italy, with a circumference measuring 107.25 m. Taking into account the statue of St. John the Baptist (attributed to Turino di Sano) atop the dome, it is even a few centimetres taller than the Leaning Tower.

The portal, facing the façade of the cathedral, is flanked by two classical columns, while the inner jambs are executed in the Byzantine style. The lintel is divided into two tiers, the lower one depicting several episodes in the life of St. John the Baptist, and the upper one showing Christ between the Madonna and St. John the Baptist, flanked by angels and the evangelists.

The immensity of the interior is overwhelming, but it is surprisingly plain and lacking in decoration. It has notable acoustics also.

The octagonal baptismal font at the centre dates from 1246 and was made by Guido Bigarelli da Como. The bronze sculpture of St. John the Baptist at the centre of the font is a remarkable work by Italo Griselli.

The famous pulpit was sculpted between 1255 and 1260 by Nicola Pisano, father of Giovanni Pisano, the artist who produced the pulpit in the Duomo. The scenes on the pulpit, and especially the classical form of the naked Hercules, show at best Nicola Pisano&#x27;s abilities as the most important precursor of Italian renaissance sculpture by reinstating antique representations. Therefore, surveys of the Italian Renaissance usually begin with the year 1260, the year that Nicola Pisano dated this pulpit.

==Campanile==
The campanile (bell tower), commonly known as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, is located behind the cathedral. The last of the three major buildings on the piazza to be built, construction of the bell tower began in 1173 and took place in three stages over the course of 177 years, with the bell-chamber only added in 1372. Five years after construction began, when the building had reached the third floor level, the weak subsoil and poor foundation led to the building sinking on its south side. The building was left for a century, which allowed the subsoil to stabilise itself and prevented the building from collapsing. In 1272, to adjust the lean of the building, when construction resumed, the upper floors were built with one side taller than the other. The seventh and final floor was added in 1319. By the time the building was completed, the lean was approximately 1 degree, or 80 cm (2.5 feet) from vertical. At its greatest, measured prior to 1990, the lean measured approximately 5.5 degrees. As at 2010, the lean was reduced to approximately 4 degrees.

The tower stands approximately 60 m high, and was built to accommodate a total of seven main bells, cast to the musical scale:
# &quot;L&#x27;Assunta&quot;, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb)
# &quot;Il Crocifisso&quot;, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb)
# &quot;San Ranieri&quot;, cast in 1719–21 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb)
# &quot;La Terza&quot;, the first small bell, cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb)
# &quot;La Pasquereccia&quot; or &quot;La Giustizia&quot;, cast in 1262 by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb)
# &quot;Il Vespruccio&quot;, the second small bell, cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb)
# &quot;Dal Pozzo&quot;, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)

There are 296 steps leading to the top of the tower.

== Camposanto Monumentale ==

The Camposanto Monumentale (&quot;Monumental Cemetery&quot;), also known as &quot;Campo Santo&quot; or &quot;Camposanto Vecchio&quot; (&quot;Old Cemetery&quot;), is located at the northern edge of the square. This walled cemetery is said to have been built around a shipload of sacred soil from Calvary, brought back to Pisa from the Third Crusade by Ubaldo de&#x27; Lanfranchi, the archbishop of Pisa in the 12th century. This is where the name &quot;Campo Santo&quot; (&quot;Holy Field&quot;) originates.

The building itself dates from a century later and was erected over the earlier burial ground. The building of this huge, oblong Gothic cloister began in 1278 by the architect Giovanni di Simone. He died in 1284 when Pisa suffered a defeat in a naval battle of Meloria against the Genoans. The cemetery was only completed in 1464. The outer wall is composed of 43 blind arches. There are two doorways. The one on the right is crowned by a gracious Gothic tabernacle and contains the &quot;Virgin Mary with Child&quot; surrounded by four saints. It is the work from the second half of the 14th century by a follower of Giovanni Pisano. Most of the tombs are under the arcades, although a few are on the central lawn. The inner court is surrounded by elaborate round arches with slender mullions and plurilobed tracery.

The Camposanto Monumentale once contained a large collection of Roman sculptures and sarcophagi, but now there are only 84 remaining. The walls were once covered in frescoes, the first were applied in 1360, the last about three centuries later. The &quot;Stories of the Old Testament&quot; by Benozzo Gozzoli (c. 15th century) were situated in the north gallery, while the south arcade was famous for the &quot;Stories of the Genesis&quot; by Piero di Puccio (c. late 15th century). The most remarkable fresco is &quot;The Triumph of Death&quot;, a realistic work by Buonamico Buffalmacco. On 27 July 1944, incendiary bombs dropped by Allied aircraft set the roof of the building on fire and covered them in molten lead, all but destroying them. Since 1945, restoration works have been going on and now the Campo Santo has been brought back to its original state.

== Ospedale Nuovo di Santo Spirito ==

The Ospedale Nuovo di Santo Spirito (&quot;New Hospital of Holy Spirit&quot;) is located on the south area of the square. Built in 1257 by Giovanni di Simone over a preexisting smaller hospital, the function of this hospital was to help pilgrims, poor, sick people, and abandoned children by providing a shelter. The name of the hospital was later changed to Ospedale della Misericordia (&quot;Hospital of Mercy&quot;) or di Santa Chiara (&quot;Sant Claire&quot;), which was the name of the small church included in the complex.

The hospital exterior was constructed with brick walls with two-light windows in gothic style; the hospital interior was painted in two colours, black and white, to imitate the marble colours of the other buildings. In 1562, during the time when the Medici dominated the city, the hospital was restructured according to Florentine renaissance canons; all the doors and windows were modified with new rectangular ones encased in grey sandstone.

Today, the building is no longer entirely a hospital. Since 1976, the middle part of the building contains the Sinopias Museum, where original drawings of the Campo Santo frescoes are kept.

== Palazzo dell&#x27;Opera ==
The Palazzo dell&#x27;Opera (Opera in the sense of &quot;works&quot; - these were the workshops of the complex) is at the south east corner of the square. Parts have been built in different periods, with the main building dating back to at least the 14th century and the latest to the 19th century.

Originally these houses belonged to the workmen of the cathedral complex: the tailor, the gardener, the bell ringers, etc., until the 19th century when the administration offices of the Opera della Primaziale were moved in. In the same years the chapter house was also moved inside the complex. In the course of time the complex was rearranged several times, but the façade of the main building still conserves its original aspect.

In the first years of the 21st century the administration offices and the chapter moved again to a nearby palace close to the archbishopric. Only a few rooms on the ground floor are still used as offices for the surveillance and technical staff. After the move, the upper rooms were transformed in a platform for temporary exhibitions (2014). This is the first time people can actually visit those rooms.

The most interesting rooms open to the public are the President room, the Deputation room, the chapel and the Chapter room. Among the closed ones are the &quot;Loggetta&quot; room (with frescoes by Agostino Ghirlanda), the &quot;Scrittoio&quot; room (with a fresco by Il Sodoma), the &quot;Viola&quot; room and the technical room.

<text>STS-78 was the fifth dedicated Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission for the Space Shuttle program, flown partly in preparation for the International Space Station project. The mission used the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, which lifted off successfully from Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Launch Pad 39B on June 20, 1996. This marked the 78th flight of the Space Shuttle and 20th mission for &quot;Columbia&quot;.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===
==Mission objectives==

* Research into the effects of long-duration spaceflight on human physiology in preparation for flights on the International Space Station.
* 22 life science and microgravity experiments using the Orbiter&#x27;s pressurised Life &amp; Microgravity Spacelab module (LM2).
* Tests into the use of the Orbiter&#x27;s Reaction Control System jets to raise the altitude of orbiting satellites.

=== Crew seat assignments ===

==Mission highlights==

During the 16-day, 21-hour mission, the crew of &quot;Columbia&quot; assisted in the preparations for the International Space Station by studying the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human body in readiness for ISS Expeditions, and also carried out experiments similar to those now being carried out on the orbital station.

Following launch, &quot;Columbia&quot; climbed to an altitude of with an orbital inclination of 39° to the Earth&#x27;s equator to allow the seven-member flight crew to maintain the same sleep rhythms they were accustomed to on Earth and to reduce vibrations and directional forces that could have affected on-board microgravity experiments.

Once in orbit, the crew entered the long pressurized Spacelab module to commence over 40 science experiments to take place during the mission. Not only did these experiments make use of the module&#x27;s laboratory, but also employed lockers in the middeck section of the orbiter. Thirteen of the experiments were dedicated to studying the effects of microgravity on the human body, whilst another six studied the behaviour of fluids and metals in the almost weightless environment and the production of metallic alloys and protein crystals. The crew also carried out the first ever comprehensive study of sleep patterns in microgravity, research into bone and muscle loss in space, and in-flight fixes to problem hardware on the Bubble, Drop and Particle Unit (BDPU), designed to study fluid physics.

The mission also featured a test of a procedure that was later used during the second Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission to raise the telescope&#x27;s altitude without damaging the satellite&#x27;s solar arrays. During the test, &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; vernier Reaction Control System jets were gently pulsed to boost the Shuttle&#x27;s altitude without jarring any of the mission payloads. The test was successful, and was later employed by &quot;Discovery&quot; during STS-82, and was used multiple times to boost the orbit of the ISS when docked with an orbiter.

== Mission anomaly ==
Although the launch went without any issue, an issue was discovered with the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) following their disassembly in June post-recovery. Analysis showed worrying damage to the field joints which was likely caused by hot gases. Failure of booster seals on the lower sections of Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;&#x27;s right SRB ultimately caused the orbiter to break up mid-flight in 1986. This time the issue did not compromise astronaut safety because the hot gas path traveled through the engines&#x27; field joints but not their capture joint (containing the infamous &quot;O-ring&quot; seals). Despite there being no issue with safety, it did raise questions about a new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)–mandated adhesive and cleaning fluid.

Due to the issue, STS-79 which was meant to dock with the Space Station &quot;Mir&quot; and return astronaut Shannon Lucid, was delayed. Options of returning Shannon on a Soyuz were considered, but never followed through as the Shuttle was considered safe and able to return Shannon.

<doc id="526886" wikidata="Q375480" url="?curid=526886" title="Tijuana bible">
<text>Tijuana bibles (also known as eight-pagers, Tillie-and-Mac books, Jiggs-and-Maggie books, Jo-Jo books, bluesies, blue-bibles, gray-backs, and two-by-fours) were palm-sized erotic comics produced in the United States from the 1920s to the early 1960s. Their popularity peaked during the Great Depression era.

Most Tijuana bibles were obscene parodies of popular newspaper comic strips at the time, such as &quot;Blondie&quot;, &quot;Barney Google&quot;, &quot;Moon Mullins&quot;, &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;Tillie the Toiler&quot;, &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;, and &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;. Others made use of characters based on popular movie and sports stars of the day such as Mae West, W.C. Fields, Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, The Marx Brothers, Cary Grant, Jean Harlow, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe Louis, sometimes with names only subtly changed. Before World War II, almost all the stories were humorous, cartoon versions of well-known dirty jokes that had been making the rounds for decades.

The artists, writers, and publishers of these booklets generally remained anonymous as their publication was illegal and clandestine. The quality of the artwork varied widely. The subjects consisted of explicit sexual escapades, usually featuring well-known newspaper comic strip characters, movie stars, and (rarely) political figures, invariably used without respect for either copyright or libel law and without permission. Tijuana bibles featured ethnic stereotypes found in popular culture at the time, although one Tijuana bible (&quot;You Nazi Man&quot;) concluded on a serious note with a brief message from the publisher pleading for greater tolerance in Germany for the Jews.

The typical bible was an eight-panel comic strip in a wallet-sized format with black print on cheap white paper and running eight pages in length.

==Characters==

Tillie and Mac are thought to have been the first Tijuana bible stars, along with Maggie and Jiggs from the popular newspaper strip &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;. Tillie was soon followed by Winnie Winkle, Dumb Dora, Dixie Dugan, Fritzi Ritz, Ella Cinders, and other familiar comic strip characters stamped in the same mold. Making the most appearances in the bibles, Popeye and Blondie were the most popular characters in the 1930s. The first celebrity bibles were based on real-life newspaper tabloid sex scandals such as the Peaches and Daddy Browning case which made headlines in 1926. Ten years later, an entire series of bibles by one unknown artist obscenely lampooned Wallis Simpson and the King of England. By far the most popular celebrity character was Mae West, but virtually every major Hollywood star of the era was featured in the Tijuana bibles.

A popular comic strip character such as Tillie or Blondie might appear in as many as 40 eight-pagers drawn by ten artists. An entire series of ten bibles drawn by &quot;Mr. Prolific&quot; was based on famous gangsters; Legs Diamond, Al Capone, and Machine Gun Kelly were featured, while the artist working under the alias &quot;Elmer Zilch&quot; drew a set of eight comics about famous boxers such as Jack Dempsey. Another set of ten bibles drawn by Mr. Prolific featured radio stars, including Joe Penner and Kate Smith. Blackjack drew a set of ten comics using characters from &quot;Snow White&quot;, with each of the seven dwarfs starring in his own X-rated title.

The ten-book series format was dictated by the limitations of the printing equipment used to print the bibles, which made it convenient to print a set of ten titles at a time, side by side on a large sheet which was then cut into strips, collated, folded, and stapled. Typically, a new set of ten would be issued every couple of months, all drawn by the same artist, featuring ten cartoon characters or celebrities. For several months in 1935, Elmer Zilch and his publishers experimented with a ten-page format, issued with two-tone covers in four sets of eight, plus one set of ten (the &quot;Salesmen&quot; series) in the eight-page format. Each panel in this series was surrounded by an intricate engraved arabesque border, possibly intended as an anti-counterfeiting device as it was hard to reproduce, and the series became known to collectors as the &quot;Ornate Borders&quot; series. Only 42 bibles are known by collectors to have been issued in this style, and most of them were soon being reprinted in truncated eight-page versions. Often the added two pages were simply filler gag panels drawn by Zilch.

In addition to comic strip characters and celebrities, many bibles featured nameless stock characters like cab drivers, firemen, traveling salesmen (and farmer&#x27;s daughters), icemen, maids, and the like. Very few original recurring characters were created expressly for the bibles; Mr. Prolific&#x27;s &quot;Fuller Brush Man&quot; was one, in which a door-to-door salesman named Ted starred in a series of ten episodic eight-page adventures. To many collectors, this series was the epitome of the Tijuana bible genre.

During the Senate racket investigations of the 1950s, a New York businessman named Abe Rubin was asked if there was any truth to the rumor picked up by a Chicago police lieutenant that he had once been the original printer and distributor of &quot;the Fuller Brush Man series of comics&quot;. The Fuller Brush man stories made a very weak stab at continuity (e.g., &quot;The following week I was sent to Tallahassee&quot; or some such words at the commencement of each installment), but each eight-panel story was self-contained. The only real serial stories told in the eight-pager format were three tales by Blackjack, featuring original characters named Fifi, Maizie, and Tessie, in &quot;To be continued&quot; narratives which stretched through three or four installments each before concluding.

== History ==
The term &quot;Tijuana bibles&quot; was first noted in Southern California in the late 1940s, and refers to the incorrect belief that they were manufactured and smuggled across the border from Tijuana, Mexico. According to one possibly apocryphal tale, visitors spending the night at the cheapest hotels in Tijuana would find a Tijuana bible in the nightstand instead of a Gideon Bible, hence the name.

In the 1930s, many early bibles bore phony imprints of non-existent companies such as &quot;London Press&quot;, &quot;La France Publishing&quot;, and &quot;Tobasco Publishing Co.&quot; in London, Paris, and Havana. The popular line using the &quot;Tobasco&quot; imprint was around the underground market for a couple of years and also printed a number of pamphlet-sized erotic fiction readers, in addition to about 60 Tijuana bible titles, most of them original.

Tijuana bibles were sold under the counter for 25 cents in places where men congregated: barrooms, bowling alleys, garages, tobacco shops, barber shops, and burlesque houses. One commentator reminisces:

In some senses, Tijuana bibles were the first underground comix. They featured original material at a time when legitimate American comic books were still reprinting newspaper strips. After World War II, the quality and the popularity of the Tijuana bible declined.

Comics artist and historian Art Spiegelman notes that records do not seem to exist of prosecutions against publishers and artists for making Tijuana bibles; the cartoonist added, however, that authorities occasionally seized shipments and people selling Tijuana bibles. According to Spiegelman, it is not clear whether mom and pop outfits or organized crime created the small salacious booklets. Old newspaper crime stories seem to indicate that most bibles were the product of a fairly small group of independent small businessmen with their own printing presses, invariably springing up again in a new location after a police raid shut them down. These businessmen manufactured a variety of pornographic products, including pornographic playing cards, gag greeting cards, and film reels, and created their own underground distribution routes around the United States.

In the early days, Tijuana bibles could be shipped in bulk around the country through commercial express offices, usually the Railway Express Agency firm. It was a serious criminal offense to send them via the US mail, and one mail order dealer was sentenced to 5 years in Leavenworth in 1932 for simply soliciting orders from his customers through the US mail (at a dollar per bible: &quot;These are not the cheap kind&quot;), even though he guaranteed to ship them by commercial express. When the mails were used, complex schemes were used to foil postal inspectors, involving mail-forwarding, one-time use postal boxes, and non-existent addresses. The high success rate of the postal authorities in defeating these schemes is the main reason that bibles were generally sold locally rather than through the mails. When a seller was arrested and prosecuted for violating a local ordinance, the penalties were far lower than if a federal offense was committed; usually a seller got off with a 30-day sentence, a $100 fine, or probation after a local arrest, at least on a first offense.

Easy access to commercial shipping was suddenly cut off in the mid-1930s, so manufacturers began driving the products themselves to various underground depots around the country in cars and vans, taking advantage of a loophole making it not a federal crime (at that time) to take pornography across state lines in a private vehicle. The small size of the bibles made them easy to transport; 50,000 bibles could fit in the trunk of a car. Clandestine distribution centers were located in basements, lofts, and back alley garages in a chain of large cities on an east–west axis from New York City to Kansas City, loosely following the route of the old National Road and generally avoiding the South and New England which were regarded as dangerous places to be arrested for pornography. (Boston&#x27;s Scollay Square, however, was a notorious place where Tijuana bibles could readily be purchased at seedy, hole-in-the-wall novelty shops patronized by sailors on leave.) Business was always done on a strictly cash basis, with generous discounts for bulk purchases to the local distributors who then resold them to retail vendors. The local distributors were not members of organized crime syndicates, but seedy small businessmen in an illegal black market business. The same vendors also handled cheap, off-brand black market condoms. A distributor&#x27;s &quot;territory&quot; might be a large city, several counties, or an entire state, with the territorial boundaries being assigned by the national distributors, who regulated things by limiting the amount of goods delivered to each local distributor to the quantity that could readily be sold inside his (or in at least one instance, her) assigned territory.

Millions of Tijuana bibles were printed and sold in the 1930s, the heyday of the bibles. But the number of new Tijuana bible titles being produced took a nosedive at the beginning of World War II, and the industry never recovered. Factors in the decline of the Tijuana bibles at this time may have included police raids and the retirement of Doc Rankin, who was called up by the military at the beginning of the war, along with wartime shortages of paper and printing supplies. Printing plates of older bibles were worn down through continued reprintings until they were nearly blank, and original plates lost in police raids had to be replaced with new plates crudely recut by hamfisted, untrained amateur engravers. The quality of Tijuana bibles available on the market suffered, and prices dropped as sales plummeted.

When the business was revived after the war, the quality of new bibles was dismal: they were poorly drawn, badly printed, and the stories were amateurish and puerile compared to the work of a decade before. Mr. Dyslexic, the leading artist of the postwar era, was possessed of an almost staggering lack of drawing talent matched only by his bad taste and ignorance of the English language.
His best-known work &quot;Traveling Preacher&quot; is a lengthy, labored-over retelling of a novel by Erskine Caldwell (&quot;Journeyman&quot;), whom Mr. Dyslexic then proceeded to acknowledge by making Caldwell himself the star of another scabrous Tijuana bible (&quot;Erskine Caldwell in &quot;Grandpa&#x27;s Revenge&quot;&quot;).

==Artists==

Little is known about the anonymous artists who produced the Tijuana bibles. Wesley Morse (who later went on to draw &quot;Bazooka Joe&quot;) drew many of those appearing shortly before WWII, most notably about a dozen titles inspired by the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. Morse was the only major Tijuana bible artist who did not parody the newspaper comic strips, preferring to create his own characters. A number of books have alleged that freelance cartoonist Doc Rankin was the creator of hundreds of Tijuana bibles in the 1930s, although this remains unproven. Gershon Legman was around the New York City erotic book trade in the 1930s, and he claimed that Rankin was paid $35 weekly to produce two eight pagers, delivering the work to Louis Shomer, a gadfly book trade personality and publisher of a line of cheap pamphlet-sized jokebooks, chiefly remembered today for testifying against Ben Rebhuhn at the Falstaff Press pornography trial and as the author of a manual of tap-dancing. During World War II, with the production of new Tijuana bible titles shut down, Shomer employed Wesley Morse to produce hundreds of unsigned and uncredited cartoons, illustrations, cover art and advertisements for his line of digest-sized newsstand joke books, Larch Publications.

In addition to his identification of Rankin, Legman also claimed to know that one of the major Tijuana bible artists was a woman. A declassified FBI memorandum from the early 1940s confirms that they knew one of the main artists to be a woman, but the artist&#x27;s name has been redacted from the document. It is likely that the artist referred to was Blackjack, who has never been positively identified but may possibly have been Legman&#x27;s acquaintance, the erotic illustrator Clara Tice. Blackjack drew upon movie star fan magazines, both for story ideas and for visual reference, for titles like &quot;William Powell and Myrna Loy in &quot;Nuts to Will Hays!&quot;&quot;, and followed the storylines of the daily newspaper comics closely and satirized them: the plot and characters of &quot;Annie and Rose in &quot;Doughnut Girls Fill Up the Holes!&quot;&quot; fits right in to the 1938 story arc in which Little Orphan Annie and her grownup friend Rose Chance tried to beat the Depression by starting a doughnut-making business. Blackjack&#x27;s two baseball-themed bibles, featuring New York Yankees Joe Dimaggio, Lou Gehrig and Lefty Gomez, show a good awareness of the latest tabloid gossip about the Yankees&#x27; love lives as of spring training 1937, although the pairing of Lou Gehrig with Mae West seems to be purely a figment of Blackjack&#x27;s imagination.

Collectors have assigned names to several anonymous artists with recognizable styles: &quot;Mr. Prolific&quot; was the creator of the &quot;Adventures of a Fuller Brush Man&quot; series, and the master of a sure-handed, elegant steel-pen inking style. &quot;Mr. Dyslexic&quot; was a seemingly clumsy, semi-literate artist who produced numerous titles in the postwar period, some with political content (e.g., Senator Robert A. Taft breaking a strike by sleeping with union members&#x27; wives). &quot;Blackjack&quot; was an artist active around 1938 whose work frequently depicted imaginary pairings of famous Hollywood movie stars, the artwork featuring large solid black areas and sometimes resembling linoleum block prints. The name &quot;Elmer Zilch&quot; appears on a number of bibles that appeared circa 1934. Zilch was an early and witty creator of the mid-1930s, rivaling Mr. Prolific in talent, popularity, and productivity, who may have been Doc Rankin. Rankin had a studio in midtown Manhattan, directly across the street from Macy&#x27;s department store, where he produced commercial artwork on commission, so there is the possibility that assistants were involved.

Commentators have claimed to discern the styles of from a dozen to twenty artists who produced 10 or more bibles during their heyday, with the most productive artists (Mr. Prolific and Elmer Zilch) each drawing from 150 to 200 titles; followed by the output of Wesley Morse, Blackjack, and Mr. Dyslexic, who each produced about half that many. These five artists may have drawn half of all the Tijuana bibles ever done. There were also two anonymous artists in the 1950s who each drew about 60 to 80 cheaply produced titles, sold for a dime each to a clientele which allegedly consisted largely of high school boys. These late-period bible series included such titles as &quot;Bellhop Kicks Dog&quot; and a number of &quot;Archie&quot;-themed comics.

A few observers believe that Mr. Prolific and Elmer Zilch may even have been the same artist working in two styles to vary his output and extend his shelf life. The byline &quot;Elmer Zilch&quot; appears on a number of Tijuana bibles which evidently came on the market in 1934 and 1935, and the same artist&#x27;s unmistakable &quot;big-foot&quot; cartoony style can be seen in many more. The name &quot;Elmer Zilch&quot; referred to a fictional character who was the mascot of the humor magazine &quot;Ballyhoo&quot;.

The total number of distinct stories produced is unknown but has been estimated by Art Spiegelman to be between 700 and 1,000. These were endlessly reprinted, redrawn, retitled, and pirated, with nearly illegible &quot;nth-generation&quot; copies circulating decades after the originals were first issued. The majority of old Tijuana bibles seen today are reprints dating from the 1950s.

In addition to the eight-pagers, there were also the more expensive &quot;16-pagers&quot;, printed in a larger page size with more pages, and usually more carefully drawn and better printed. These were high-priced and less common than the eight-pagers but showcased the artists&#x27; best work.

In 1930 the sale of two Tijuana bibles for 25 cents each, at the barber shop in the sleepy mountain hamlet of Dover Plains, was front-page news. The affair was uncovered when a maiden aunt, going through her 17-year-old nephew&#x27;s clothes to prepare them for the wash, discovered the bibles in the back pocket of his jeans, and notified the police. The guilty barber blamed a mysterious stranger from Poughkeepsie who had supplied him with the merchandise (never identified, but possibly Abe Rubin, a pioneering Tijuana bible distributor, who was arrested in the nearby village of Wingdale in 1932). One of the two bibles sold in Dover Plains was identified as &quot;The Old Man Steps Out&quot;, a Maggie and Jiggs title later reprinted by Tobasco.

The earliest known Tijuana bible arrest occurred in Terre Haute, Indiana, in 1926, when a cache of bibles was discovered in a student&#x27;s school locker at Wiley High School. Police traced the source back to a highly respected local newspaper editor named Charles Jewett (managing editor of the &quot;Terre Haute Star&quot;) and his son, a job printer. A federal charge was also placed against them because some of the bibles had been shipped across state lines to Rochester, Minnesota, home of the Mayo Clinic, where &quot;Cap&#x27;n Billy&#x27;s Whiz Bang&quot;, America&#x27;s leading outlet for guardedly smutty humor, is said to have gotten its start a few years earlier as a risque joke sheet passed around among the convalescing soldiers.

&quot;Jewett was arrested following an investigation by authorities of the origin of a book of indecent pictures in which popular comic strip characters figure,&quot; a local newspaper reported. &quot;The arrests grew out of an investigation, which had been quietly going on for three or four weeks, following the finding that several Wiley high school boys were in possession of an obscene publication based on a current strip in the Sunday papers. Further inquiry led to a search of the printing offices conducted by Jackson Jewett, under the name of the Jewett Printing Company, where a number of zinc etchings, from which the strips were printed, together with a quantity of booklets, bound and ready for distribution, were seized. It was said at the time that the elder Jewett had taken the contract for printing the strips and had attended to their distribution.&quot; Charles Jewett was sentenced to six months in a state workhouse, and father and son left Terre Haute afterward. It is not known today which particular bibles were involved, but the earliest bibles are sometimes dated to 1925, particularly early &quot;Tillie and Mac&quot; and &quot;Maggie and Jiggs&quot; stories which were issued without covers or titles at the time, and were not always eight pages long. The Kinsey Institute has in its possession an early Tillie and Mac story involving Mac finding a used condom in Tillie&#x27;s wastebasket (&quot;I wondered where that had gone&quot;, she says brightly), which has an archivist&#x27;s notation &quot;First seen Oklahoma 1926&quot;.

On the rare occasions that the Tijuana bibles were mentioned in the press, they were usually described vaguely and without identifying detail as &quot;cartoon books&quot;, an ambiguous term that could just as easily refer to licensed collections of newspaper strips such as the Cupples &amp; Leon reprint books. People would order &quot;cartoon books&quot; from the mysterious and ambiguously worded advertisements that appeared in the back pages of the &quot;Police Gazette&quot; starting in the late 1920s, but they had no way of knowing which they would receive. Buyers were sometimes advised to &quot;state explicitly what you want&quot;. If a news story concerned a police raid, a clarifying adjective might be employed, such as &quot;indecent&quot;, &quot;lewd&quot;, or &quot;obscene&quot;, as in the following 1930 news item about an arrest in midtown Manhattan:

The scale on which Tijuana bibles were produced can be gauged from the large hauls announced in police seizures. Eight million bibles were reported seized in one November 1942 raid by FBI agent P.E. Foxworth and his men on a Manhattan warehouse and a printing plant in the loft over a garage in the South Bronx. Small-time businessmen Jacob and David Brotman were arrested in that raid, along with several associates. The majority of the Tijuana bibles circulating in the country were being printed in this loft on a Babcock press. The lease on the 2250 square foot loft had been taken out a year earlier by the Brotmans&#x27; brother-in-law, who was their partner in a bowling alley located in Manhattan under the George Washington Bridge.

According to the FBI, four tons of material were ready to ship across the country, and seven tons had already gone out and were being rounded up at regional distribution centers in Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Cleveland/Akron, Indianapolis, and Kansas City. Jacob Brotman was identified as one of the main players in the Tijuana bible trade in Jay Gertzman&#x27;s &quot;Bookleggers and Smuthounds&quot;, and he had previously been arrested in a similar raid on a Lower East Side loft reported in the New York City papers in 1936 which produced a large haul of bibles, erotic fiction &quot;readers&quot;, pornographic playing cards, and nude photos, along with cutting and binding equipment and an expensive modern printing press which police could not confiscate because it turned out to be leased. The firm had been operating under the guise of a playing card manufacturer.

During the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, men selling pornographic booklets on the midway at the fair were trailed to a warehouse near the Brooklyn Navy Yard where David Brotman and Ben Reisberg (who was later arrested again with Louis Shomer in Virginia) were arrested and a cache was seized of 350,000 printed items and photos and 50,000 condoms, along with printing plates.

Collectors have estimated that as many as 50,000 copies would be produced of a single title in this period, and distributed around the country through an underground network of independent local and regional distributors, many of them former bootleggers. A local distributor such as Andrew Hepler in northern Virginia or Frank Lang in Pittsburgh would typically buy them in bulk batches of 20,000 or more as new product became available (typically 10 or 20 new titles), break the shipment into packets of 100 or so bibles, and drive around the distribution territory dropping them off at pool halls, gas stations, barber shops, and taverns. If the distributor did not cross a state line while making his rounds, it was very difficult to charge him (or her, in a few cases) with a federal offense, although in the Hepler case authorities were able to sentence him to five years in the Atlanta Penitentiary—not for distributing pornography, but on the charge that he had cheated his business partner on the proceeds.

In New York City, police raids on the business were carried out at intervals for decades, usually at the instigation of John S. Sumner and the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, which closely watched the trade in pornography in the city during the years of its existence. In Boston, this function was carried out by the Watch and Ward Society, which exchanged information with Sumner&#x27;s organization in New York to coordinate their efforts. There was a similar group in Chicago, the Illinois Vigilance Association led by Rev. Philip Yarrow; while in Philadelphia the energetic Rev. Mary Hubbert Ellis, a Primitive Methodist minister, assembled an ad hoc coalition and terrorized the local smut industry with a series of raids for two years until her enemies and their lawyers were finally able to turn the tables and force her to leave town after she accepted a $100 donation from one of the dealers in exchange for not raiding his premises. Mr. Prolific mocks these foes in one of his bibles, in the form of a guardian of public morals named &quot;Smuthound&quot; who apprehends Betty Boop while she is engaged in having sex with a lifeguard on the beach (&quot;Betty Boop in &quot;Improvising&quot;&quot;).

The FBI monitored the Tijuana bible trade but rarely made arrests. A large file of specimen bibles was maintained at FBI headquarters, eventually comprising over 5,000 items, for the purpose of tracing printers and distributors. As a result of the 1942 raids the FBI came into possession of thousands of engraved printing plates used to print the original bibles; these gathered dust in a storage cabinet at FBI headquarters for years awaiting a final decision on their destruction.

==Cultural references==
Early in the graphic novel &quot;Watchmen&quot;, the current Silk Spectre (Laurie Juspeczyk) visits her mother (past Silk Spectre Sally Jupiter) and briefly reads a Tijuana bible featuring her. Sally finds it flattering and keeps it as a reminder of her past sex appeal, but Laurie finds the comic obscene. The same Tijuana bible is later given away as a gift, owing to its present nature as a collector&#x27;s novelty item.

Will Eisner features Tijuana bibles in the first pages of his book &quot;The Dreamer&quot;, though nothing explicit is shown. His protagonist Billy is a young artist out looking for work who is offered a job illustrating them by a printer and a mobster. He is shocked and incensed and asks if they are legal. The vignette serves to focus conflict between the character&#x27;s dream and reality, but also between legitimate and illicit comic production. Dejected, Billy says that he will think it over. The theme is reminiscent of a real-life episode described by Eisner about being asked by a shady Brooklyn businessman to draw for the publications at a rate of $3 a page, which was good money at the time.

Joe Shuster drew Tijuana bible-like illustrations for an underground bondage-themed erotic series called &quot;Nights of Horror&quot; in the early 1950s. His male characters are strongly reminiscent of Superman, and some of his female characters resemble Lois Lane. Thousands of copies of &quot;Nights of Horror&quot; were seized in a police raid on a Times Square book store, but Shuster&#x27;s name did not come to light in the ensuing prosecution.

The young Hugh Hefner experimentally drew several Tijuana bibles as samples for a projected series which was never published, when he was a struggling cartoonist in Chicago in the early 1950s, around the same time that he issued his self-published cartoon book &quot;That Toddlin&#x27; Town.&quot;

The title character in the 1959 semi-autobiographical Canadian novel &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; by Mordecai Richler sells Tijuana bibles to his high school classmates, some featuring &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, after buying them in bulk from a newsstand vendor who assigns him a small part of the city as his sales territory. He hears that the news vendor has been arrested, then panics and destroys all the bibles.

The English garage punk band The Flaming Stars released the album &quot;Tijuana Bible&quot; 
in 2000.

In the 2006 novel &quot;Water for Elephants&quot;, the term &quot;eight-pager&quot; is mentioned in several locations, one of these when Kinko the dwarf is caught masturbating by Jacob Jankowski while reading a &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; Tijuana bible.

The 1996 novel &quot;The Green Mile&quot; by Stephen King, features a scene in which guard Percy Wetmore is caught reading a Tijuana bible with fictional character &quot;Lotta Leadpipe&quot;, and is asked what his mother would think of such material; this is included in the film version.

A 1954 episode of &quot;Dragnet&quot; (&quot;The Big Producer&quot;) had Sgt. Joe Friday breaking up a high school smut ring which includes a teenage boy (played by Martin Milner) selling eight-pagers out of his school locker. They are called &quot;joke books&quot; by the seller. The term &quot;Tijuana Bible&quot; was used in the 1968 &quot;Dragnet&quot; episode &quot;The Starlet&quot;.

During Year Six (2007) of the webcomic &quot;Something Positive&quot;, lead character Davan MacIntire discovers that the man whom he is named after, a cousin of his grandfather, had worked as a writer/artist of Tijuana bibles in the late 1930s. Randy Milholland, the creator of &quot;Something Positive&quot;, then created a spin-off series called &quot;Something Positive 1937&quot; to tell the story of the first Davan.

In the graphic 2007 novel &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot; by Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill, the titular Dossier contains a mock Tijuana bible (actually printed in cheap newsprint and included with the book) which, in the context of the story, was published by Pornsec, a department of the government of Big Brother (from George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;).

In 2008, comic artists Ethan Persoff and Scott Marshall created an eight-page mock Tijuana bible lampooning President George W. Bush and Presidential hopeful John McCain entitled &quot;Obliging Lady&quot;. The comic was distributed at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.

In a 2018 issue of Howard Chaykin&#x27;s scathing satire of the comics industry, &quot;Hey Kids! Comics!&quot;, two freelance comic book artists are shown furtively delivering artwork for upcoming Tijuana bibles to the (fictional) offices of the Tobasco Publishing Co.

<text>Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor. Described by the Harvard Film Archive as &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s last romantic&quot; and &quot;one of postwar American cinema’s supremely gifted and ultimately tragic filmmakers,&quot; Ray was considered an iconoclastic auteur director who often clashed with the Hollywood studio system of the time, but would prove highly influential to future generations of filmmakers. 

His best-known work is the 1955 film &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, starring James Dean. He is appreciated for many narrative features produced between 1947 and 1963, including &quot;They Live By Night&quot; (1948), &quot;In A Lonely Place&quot; (1950), &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; (1954), &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot; (1956), and &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961), as well as an experimental work produced throughout the 1970s titled &quot;We Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;, which was unfinished at the time of Ray&#x27;s death.

During his lifetime, Ray was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Story for &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, twice for the Golden Lion, for &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot; (1956) and &quot;Bitter Victory&quot; (1957), and a Palme d&#x27;Or for &quot;The Savage Innocents&quot; (1960). Three of his films were ranked by &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; in their Annual Top 10 Lists. 

Ray&#x27;s compositions within the CinemaScope frame and use of color are particularly well regarded and he was an important influence on the French New Wave, with Jean-Luc Godard famously writing in a review of &quot;Bitter Victory&quot;, &quot;... there is cinema. And the cinema is Nicholas Ray.&quot;

==Early life and career==
Ray was born in Galesville, Wisconsin, the youngest of four children and only son of Olene &quot;Lena&quot; (Toppen) and Raymond Nicholas Kienzle, a contractor and builder. His paternal grandparents were German and his maternal grandparents were Norwegian. He grew up in La Crosse, Wisconsin, also the home town of future fellow director Joseph Losey. A popular but erratic student prone to delinquency and alcohol abuse, with his alcoholic father as an example, at age sixteen Ray was sent to live with his older, married sister in Chicago, Illinois, where he attended Waller High School and immersed himself in the Al Capone-era nightlife. Upon his return to La Crosse in his senior year, he emerged as a talented orator, winning a contest at local radio station WKBH (now WIZM) while also hanging around a local stock theater.

With strong grades in English and public speaking and failures in Latin, physics, and geometry, he graduated at the bottom (ranked 152nd in a class of 153) of his class at La Crosse Central High School in 1929. He studied drama at La Crosse State Teachers College (now the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse) for two years before earning the requisite grades to apply for admission to the University of Chicago in the fall of 1931. Although he spent only one semester at the institution because of excessive drinking and poor grades, Ray managed to cultivate a relationship with dramatist Thornton Wilder, then a professor.

Having been active in the Student Dramatic Association during his time in Chicago, Ray returned to his hometown and started the La Crosse Little Theatre Group, which presented several productions in 1932. He also briefly re-enrolled at the State Teachers College in the fall of that year. Before his stint at Chicago, he had contributed a regular column of musings, called &quot;The Bullshevist,&quot; to the &quot;Racquet&quot;, the college&#x27;s weekly publication, and resumed writing for it when he returned, but, according to biographer Patrick McGilligan, Ray, with friend Clarence Hiskey, also arranged meetings to organize a La Crosse chapter of the Communist Party USA. By early 1933, he had left the State Teachers College and began to employ the moniker of &quot;Nicholas Ray&quot; in his correspondence.

Through his connections with Thornton Wilder and others in Chicago, Ray met Frank Lloyd Wright at Wright&#x27;s home, Taliesin, in Spring Green, Wisconsin. He cultivated a relationship with Wright in order to win an invitation to join &quot;the Fellowship,&quot; as the community of Wright &quot;apprentices&quot; was known. In late 1933 Wright asked Ray to organize the newly built Hillside Playhouse, a room at Taliesin dedicated to musical and dramatic performances. There, at regular film screenings often encompassing foreign productions, Ray likely had his first exposure to non-Hollywood cinema. However he and his mentor had a falling-out in spring 1934 with Wright directing him to leave the compound immediately.

While negotiating with Wright, Ray visited New York City, where he had his first encounters with the political theatre growing in response to the Great Depression. Returning after his ejection from Taliesin, Ray joined the Workers&#x27; Laboratory Theatre, a communal troupe formed in 1929, which had recently changed its name to the Theatre of Action. Briefly billing himself as Nik Ray, he acted in several productions, collaborating with a number of performers, some of whom he later cast in his films, including Will Lee and Curt Conway, and some who became friends for life, including Elia Kazan. He was subsequently employed by the Federal Theatre Project, part of the Works Progress Administration. He befriended folklorist Alan Lomax and traveled with him through rural America, collecting traditional vernacular music. In 1940–41, Lomax produced and Ray directed &quot;Back Where I Come From&quot;, a pioneering folk music radio program featuring such artists as Woody Guthrie, Burl Ives, Lead Belly, the Golden Gate Quartet, and Pete Seeger, for CBS. American folk songs would later figure prominently in several of his films.

During the early years of World War II, Ray directed and supervised radio propaganda programs for the United States Office of War Information and the Voice of America broadcasting service under the aegis of John Houseman. In the summer of 1942 Ray was investigated by the FBI, and was given its B-2 classification of &quot;tentative dangerousness.&quot; Additionally, Director J. Edgar Hoover personally recommended &quot;Custodial Detention.&quot; Though Hoover&#x27;s scheme was later quashed by the Justice Department, in autumn 1943 Ray was among more than twenty OWI employees identified publicly as having Communist affiliations or sympathies, noting that he was &quot;discharged from the WPA community service of Washington DC for Communist activities.&quot; The FBI soon determined the case of &quot;Nicholas K. Ray,&quot; however, &quot;as not warranting investigation.&quot; At the OWI, Ray renewed his acquaintance with Molly Day Thatcher, Houseman&#x27;s assistant, and her husband, Elia Kazan, from the New York theatre days. In 1944, heading to Hollywood to direct &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;, Kazan suggested Ray go west, too, and hired him as an assistant on the production.

Returning east, Ray directed his first and only Broadway production, the Duke Ellington-John Latouche musical &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, in 1946. Earlier that year he was assistant director, under director Houseman, of another Broadway musical, &quot;Lute Song&quot;, with music by Raymond Scott. Also through Houseman, Ray had the opportunity to work in television, one of his few forays into the new medium. Houseman had agreed to direct an adaption of Lucille Fletcher&#x27;s radio thriller, &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot;, for CBS, and took Ray on as his collaborator. They cast Mildred Natwick as the invalid woman who thinks that she&#x27;s the object of a murder scheme she overhears on her phone. When &quot;Lute Song&quot; called on Houseman&#x27;s time and attention, Ray took over the task of staging the broadcast, which aired on January 30, 1946. The next year, Ray directed his first film, &quot;They Live by Night&quot; (1949), for RKO Pictures.

== Hollywood ==
&quot;They Live By Night&quot; was reviewed (under one of its working titles, &quot;The Twisted Road&quot;) as early as June 1948, but not released until November 1949, due to the chaotic conditions surrounding Howard Hughes&#x27;s takeover of RKO Pictures. As a result of the delay, the second and third pictures Ray directed, RKO&#x27;s &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1949) and &quot;Knock On Any Door&quot; (1949), a loan-out to Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s Santana Productions and Columbia, were released before his first.

Almost an impressionistic take on film noir, starring Farley Granger and Cathy O&#x27;Donnell as a thief and his newlywed wife, &quot;They Live By Night&quot; was notable for its empathy for society&#x27;s young outsiders, a recurring motif in Ray&#x27;s oeuvre. Its subject matter, two young lovers running from the law, had an influence on the sporadically popular movie sub-genre involving a fugitive criminal couple, including Joseph H. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; (1950), Arthur Penn&#x27;s &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973), and Robert Altman&#x27;s 1974 adaptation of the Edward Anderson novel that had also served as the basis for Ray&#x27;s film, &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; gave &quot;They Live By Night&quot; a positive review (despite calling his trademark sympathetic eye to rebels and criminals &quot;misguided&quot;) and acclaimed Ray for &quot;good, realistic production and sharp direction...Mr. Ray has an eye for action details. His staging of the robbery of a bank, all seen by the lad in the pick-up car, makes a fine clip of agitating film. And his sensitive juxtaposing of his actors against highways, tourist camps and bleak motels makes for a vivid comprehension of an intimate personal drama in hopeless flight.&quot;

Ray made several more contributions to the noir genre, most notably the 1950 Humphrey Bogart movie, also for Santana and released by Columbia, &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot;, about a troubled screenwriter suspected of a violent murder, and &quot;On Dangerous Ground&quot; (1951), in which Robert Ryan plays an alienated, brutally violent detective on a city police force who finds redemption, and love, after he is sent to investigate a murder in a rural community.

While at RKO, Ray also directed &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Secret&quot;, co-starring his wife-to-be Gloria Grahame as a singer who becomes the subject of a crime and an investigation of her past, and &quot;Born to Be Bad&quot; (1950), with Joan Fontaine as a San Francisco social climber.

In January 1949, Ray was announced as set to direct &quot;I Married a Communist&quot;, a litmus test that RKO head Howard Hughes had concocted to weed out Communists at the studio. John Cromwell and Joseph Losey had previously turned it down, and both were punished by the studio and subsequently blacklisted. Soon after the public announcement, and prior to the start of production, Ray stepped away from the project. While the studio considered dismissing him or suspending him, instead it extended his contract, evidently with Hughes&#x27;s consent. As late as 1979, Ray insisted that Hughes &quot;saved me from blacklisting,&quot; although Ray also likely wrote to the House Committee on Un-American Activities about his political past or testified in private, in order to protect himself.

His final film at the studio, &quot;The Lusty Men&quot; (1952), starred Robert Mitchum as a champion bronco rider who tutors a younger man in the ways of rodeoing while becoming emotionally involved with the younger cowpoke&#x27;s wife. At a March 1979 college appearance, documented in the first sequence of &quot;Lightning Over Water&quot; (1980) to be shot, Ray talks about &quot;The Lusty Men&quot; as a film about &quot;a man who wants to bring himself all together before he dies.&quot;

After leaving RKO, Ray signed with a new agent, MCA&#x27;s Lew Wasserman, a major Hollywood force, who steered the director&#x27;s career through the 1950s. During that time, Ray directed one or two films for most of the major studios, and one generally considered to be a minor, Republic Pictures. He made films in conventionalized genres, including Westerns and melodramas, as well as others that resisted easy categorization.

In the mid-fifties, he made the two films for which he is best remembered: &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; (1954) and &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955). The former, made at Republic, was a Western starring Joan Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge in action roles of the kind customarily played by men. Stylized, and highly eccentric in its time, it was much loved by French critics. (François Truffaut called it &quot;the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; of Westerns, a Western dream.&quot;)

Between feature-length projects, and after shooting another Western, &quot;Run For Cover&quot; (1955), starring James Cagney, Ray was asked to take on a television film for &quot;G. E. Theater&quot;. The anthology series was produced by MCA-Revue, a subsidiary of the agency to which the director was signed, and aired on CBS. &quot;High Green Wall&quot; was an adaptation, by Charles Jackson, of an Evelyn Waugh story, &quot;The Man Who Liked Dickens,&quot; about an illiterate man, played by Thomas Gomez, who holds captive a stranded traveller, played by Joseph Cotten, in the jungle, forcing him to read aloud from Dickens novels. Shot on film over a few days, after a week&#x27;s rehearsal, the half-hour drama was broadcast on October 3, 1954. Ray did not work in broadcast television after, and rarely spoke of the program, later expressing his disappointment: &quot;I was hoping for something new, accidental or planned, to happen. But it didn&#x27;t.&quot;

In 1955, at Warner Bros., Ray directed &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, twenty-four hours in the life of a troubled teenager, starring James Dean in what proved to be his most famous role. When &quot;Rebel&quot; was released, only a few weeks after Dean&#x27;s early death in an automobile crash, it had a revolutionary impact on movie-making and youth culture, virtually giving birth to the contemporary concept of the American teenager. Looking past its social and pop-culture significance, &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; is the purest example of Ray&#x27;s cinematic style and vision, with an expressionistic use of colour, dramatic use of architecture and an empathy for social misfits.

&quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; was Ray&#x27;s biggest commercial success, and marked a breakthrough in the careers of child actors Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo. Ray engaged in a tempestuous &quot;spiritual marriage&quot; with Dean, and awakened the latent homosexuality of Mineo, through his role as Plato, who would become the first gay teenager to appear on film. During filming, Ray began a short-lived affair with Wood, who, at age 16, was 27 years his junior. This created a tense atmosphere between Ray and Dennis Hopper, who was also involved with Wood at the time, but they were reconciled later.

In 1956, Ray was chosen to direct the melodrama &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot; at Twentieth Century-Fox by the film&#x27;s star and producer, James Mason, who played an elementary-school teacher, stricken with a rare circulatory ailment, and driven delusional by his abuse of a new wonder drug, Cortisone. In 1957, completing a two-picture deal, Ray reluctantly directed &quot;The True Story of Jesse James&quot;, a remake of the 1939 Fox release, &quot;Jesse James&quot;. Ray wanted to cast Elvis Presley as the legendary bandit, and Presley had made his first film, &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; (1956), at the studio. Fox demurred, however, and Presley moved to Paramount, leaving contract players Robert Wagner and Jeffrey Hunter to play the James brothers.

Warner&#x27;s commitment to &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; led the studio to send Ray on his first overseas trip, in September 1955, to publicize the film, while it was still in previews in the US. He visited Paris, where he met some of the French critics, eager to talk with the director of &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;, one of whom, he later remarked, &quot;almost persuaded me it was a great movie.&quot; He was in London when he received the call telling him of James Dean&#x27;s death, on the last day of the month, and then travelled to Germany, to drink and mourn. Nonetheless, this moment marked a professional change for Ray, most of whose remaining mainstream films were produced outside Hollywood. He returned to Warner Bros. for &quot;Wind Across the Everglades&quot; (1958), an ecologically themed period drama about plume poachers, written by Budd Schulberg and produced by his brother, Stuart Schulberg; and, at MGM, he directed &quot;Party Girl&quot; (1958), which harked back to Ray&#x27;s youth in Chicago, a Roaring Twenties gangster drama that included musical numbers performed by star Cyd Charisse.

Prior to those projects, however, Ray returned to France to direct &quot;Bitter Victory&quot; (1957), a World War II drama starring Richard Burton and Curd Jürgens as Leith and Brand, British army officers on a mission to raid a Nazi station in Benghazi, and Ruth Roman as Brand&#x27;s wife and, before the war, Leith&#x27;s lover. Shot on location in the Libyan desert, with some sequences in a studio in Nice, it was by all accounts an arduous production, exacerbated for Ray by his drinking and drug use. As much an art film as a conventional war picture, &quot;Bitter Victory&quot; confused many, while enthusing Ray&#x27;s continental supporters, such as Godard and Éric Rohmer.

While for the first decade of his career Ray&#x27;s films had been studio pictures, and relatively small in scale, by the late 1950s, they were increasing in logistical complexity and difficulty, and cost. As well, the studio system that had both challenged and supported him was changing, making Hollywood less viable for him as a professional base.

Though he contributed to the writing of most of his films — perhaps most extensively &quot;The Lusty Men&quot;, which started production with only a handful of pages — &quot;The Savage Innocents&quot; (1960) was the only screenplay of a film he directed for which he received credit. Adapting a novel about Inuit life by Hans Ruesch, &quot;Top of the World&quot;, Ray also drew on the writing of explorer Peter Freuchen, and the 1933 film based on one of Freuchen&#x27;s books, &quot;Eskimo&quot;. An epic-scale production, with Italian backing and distribution by Paramount, Ray began shooting the film, with lead Anthony Quinn, in the brutal cold of northern Manitoba and on Baffin Island, but much of the footage was lost in a plane crash. He had to use process photography to replace the lost location scenes, when the production moved to Rome, as planned, for studio work.

Now largely based in Europe, Ray signed on to direct producer Samuel Bronston&#x27;s life of Christ as a replacement for the original director, John Farrow. Shooting in Spain, Ray cast Jeffrey Hunter, who had played Jesse James&#x27;s brother Frank for the director a few years before, as Jesus. A vast undertaking by any account, the production endured intervention by backing studio MGM, logistical challenges (the Sermon on the Mount sequence required five cameras and employed 5,400 extras), and the project grew in ways that Ray was not strong enough to control. Perhaps predictably, &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961) was received with hostility by the US press, the Catholic periodical &quot;America&quot;, in a review titled &quot;Christ or Credit Card?&quot;, calling it &quot;disedifying and antireligious.&quot;

Screenwriter Philip Yordan, Ray&#x27;s collaborator on several projects, back to &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; and including &quot;King of Kings&quot;, looking at an extremely lucrative prospect, persuaded the director to sign again with Bronston for another epic, this one about the Boxer Rebellion. As biographer Bernard Eisenschitz observes: &quot;Accounts of Ray during the making of &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot; portray, not a man who was drinking (the rationale often advanced), but a film-maker who couldn&#x27;t make up his mind, seeking refuge in frenzied activity and loading himself with unnecessary burdens.&quot; With an international cast, including Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, David Niven and most of the staff of Madrid&#x27;s Chinese restaurants (as extras, not the Chinese principals), again for Ray, the project was being rewritten on the fly, and he was directing with little preparation. By habit, and because of the pressures of the job, he was heavily medicated and slept little, and finally, he collapsed on the set, according to his wife, suffering a tachycardia. He was replaced by Andrew Marton, a highly regarded second-unit director fresh off another runaway spectacle, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), with some of Heston&#x27;s final scenes with Gardner directed by Guy Green, at Heston&#x27;s request. Released from hospital, Ray tried to participate in the editing process, but, according to Marton, &quot;was so abusive and so critical of the first part of the picture, which was my part,&quot; that Bronston forbade Ray from viewing any more of the assembled scenes. Though Marton estimated that sixty-five per cent of the picture was his, and though he wanted the directing credit, he accepted a financial settlement from Bronston. Ray was credited as director, and represented the film, his last mainstream motion picture, at its May 1963 premiere in London.

==Later career==

Ray found himself increasingly shut out of the Hollywood film industry in the early 1960s, and after &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot;, he did not direct again until the 1970s, though he continued to try to develop projects while in Europe.

He attempted an adaptation of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Lady From the Sea&quot;, first with Ingrid Bergman in mind, and later Romy Schneider. He optioned a novel, &quot;Next Stop—Paradise&quot;, by the Polish writer Marek Hlasko. In late 1963, in Paris, he worked with novelist James Jones on a Western titled &quot;Under Western Skies&quot;, drawing on &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Moving to London, urged to treat his alcohol and drug abuse, he consulted the physician and psychiatrist, Barrington Cooper, who prescribed script work as &quot;occupational therapy.&quot; They formed a production company, Emerald Films, under which they developed two projects that were among the few in Ray&#x27;s European sojourn to come anywhere near fruition. &quot;The Doctor and the Devils&quot; was a screenplay written by Dylan Thomas (whom Cooper had also treated), inspired by the 1828 case of Dr. Robert Knox and murderers Burke and Hare, who supplied him with corpses for dissection, to be used during medical lessons. Ray struck up a deal with Avala Film, the largest production company in Yugoslavia, to back that film and three others, leading him from London to Zagreb. Production was announced as starting on September 1, 1965, amended to October 21, with Maximilian Schell, Susannah York and Geraldine Chaplin in the cast, but Ray insisted on rewrites, asking, among others, John Fowles, who declined, and Gore Vidal, who in retrospect wondered why he agreed. Ray tried in vain to enlist US investment, by Seven Arts and Warner Bros., on a budget that was mounting, to upwards of $2.5 million. Accounts of the productions failure vary, including the assertion that on the first day of shooting, Ray was out of the country, and the conclusion that he was paralysed by doubt and indecision. Whatever the case, prospects for a new, major Nicholas Ray film dissolved.

Dave Wallis&#x27;s novel, &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot;, was the second property that Ray tried to develop as an Emerald Films venture. As a dystopian parable, in which adults have abandoned society and adolescents have formed gangs to take charge, it might have seemed perfect for the director of &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot;, and, announced in spring 1966, it was to star the Rolling Stones. According to Cooper, the Stones&#x27; US manager Allen Klein treated him and Ray to lavish visits to New York, and then Los Angeles, for meetings, then &quot;conned&quot; Ray into giving up his rights to the property, with a &quot;lucrative director&#x27;s contract,&quot; and evidently nothing to direct. (Jim Jarmusch, who befriended Ray a few years before Ray died, later made a film titled &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot; (2013). The story of a young vampire couple — who of course are not young at all — its only connection with the Wallis novel or Ray&#x27;s project is its title.)

While working with Dr. Cooper, and after, Ray maintained some degree of cash flow by developing and editing scripts, but for films that never came to be. He made the German island Sylt his base of operations and imagined projects that might be shot there, including one to star Jane Fonda and Paul Newman, titled &quot;Go Where You Want, Die As You Must&quot;, a production that would also demand 2,000 extras. While in Europe, he attracted some of the current generation of filmmakers. He had been introduced to Volker Schlöndorff by Hanne Axmann, who had starred in Schlöndorff&#x27;s first film, and Ray brokered a deal to sell his second, &quot;Mord und Totschlag&quot; (1969), to Universal Pictures, pocketing about one-third of the money as his fee and for expenses. When in Paris, he sometimes stayed with Barbet Schroeder, whose production company tried to find backing for one or another of Ray&#x27;s projects. There, in the wake of the May 1968 demonstrations, he collaborated with Jean-Pierre Bastid and producer Henry Lange to shoot a three-part, one-hour film, which he later titled &quot;Wha-a-at?&quot;, one of several projects, concerning contemporary young people during a time of questioning, rebellion and revolt that never came to be. Similarly, Ray enticed Schroeder&#x27;s friend Stéphane Tchalgadjieff to raise funding for &quot;L&#x27;Evadé&quot; (&quot;The Substitute&quot;), a story about mixed and assumed identities, and Tchalgadjieff raised a half-million dollars, only for Ray to manoeuvre him out, and for nothing to emerge from the enterprise.

Ray&#x27;s reputation for youth-oriented films led Ellen Ray (unrelated to him) and her partners in Dome Films to solicit him to direct her screenplay about a young man on trial for possession of marijuana, which became the reason for Ray&#x27;s return to the United States in November 1969. Instead of &quot;The Defendant&quot;, however, Ray embarked on projects concerning young Americans in turbulent times, notably the Chicago Seven, forming a production company called Leo Seven, and drawing some financial interest from Michael Butler, producer of the hit stage musical &quot;Hair&quot;. Shooting material for &quot;Conspiracy&quot; on almost every current gauge of film stock, from 35mm to Super 8, he accumulated documentary sequences, dramatized reconstructions of the trial, and collage-like multiple-image footage. In order to continue, he financed production by selling paintings that he owned, and sought backing from anyone he could.

Migrating from Chicago to New York City, and then, at Dennis Hopper&#x27;s invitation, New Mexico, in 1971 Ray landed in upstate New York, and started a new career as a teacher, accepting an appointment at Harpur College, in Binghamton. There he found a cast and crew, students who were eager and imaginative, but also inexperienced. Devoted to the idea of learning by doing, Ray and his class embarked on a major, feature-length project. Rather than the strict division of labour characteristic of his Hollywood career, Ray devised a rotation in which a student would take on different roles behind or in front of the camera. Similar to the Chicago Seven project — some footage from which he incorporated into the new film — the Harpur film, which came to be titled &quot;We Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;, used material shot on numerous gauges of film, as well as video that was later processed and manipulated with a synthesizer provided by Nam June Paik. The pictures were combined into multiple-image constructions using as many as five projectors, and refilming the images in 35mm from a screen. Two documentaries provide records of Ray&#x27;s methods and the work of his class: the near-contemporary biography, &quot;I&#x27;m A Stranger Here Myself: A Portrait of Nicholas Ray&quot; (1975), directed by David Helpern Jr., and Susan Ray&#x27;s retrospective account, &quot;Don&#x27;t Expect Too Much&quot; (2011).

In the spring of 1972, Ray was asked to show some footage from the film at a conference. The audience was shocked to see footage of Ray and his students smoking marijuana together. An early version of &quot;We Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot; was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973, to an abiding lack of interest. Ray shot additional scenes in Amsterdam, shortly after the Cannes screening, in New York in January 1974, and two months later in San Francisco, and edited a second version, with the hopes of attracting a distributor in 1976. It remained uncompleted and without distribution at Ray&#x27;s death, in 1979, but some prints of the 1973 version were made and screened at festivals and retrospectives through the 1980s. A restored version, based on the 1973 cut, was released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2011, by Oscilloscope Films.

In the spring of 1973, Ray&#x27;s contract at Binghamton was not renewed. Over the next couple of years, he relocated several times, trying to raise money and continue work on the film, before he returned to New York City. There, he continued to prepare script materials and try to develop film projects, the most viable of which was &quot;City Blues&quot;, before the production collapsed. He was also able to continue teaching acting and directing, at the Lee Strasberg Institute and New York University, where his teaching assistant was graduate student Jim Jarmusch.

Ray directed two short films in the 1970s. One, &quot;The Janitor&quot;, was a segment of the feature-length &quot;Wet Dreams&quot;, also known as &quot;Dreams of Thirteen&quot; (1974). Within a collection of shorts, most of which satirized pornography, Ray&#x27;s was also a very personal film in which he cast himself in the double role of a caretaker and a preacher, and used visual techniques comparable to those in his previous film. The second, &quot;Marco&quot; (1978), derived from one of his Strasberg Institute classes and was based on the first few pages of a recent novel of the same name, by Curtis Bill Pepper. Ray&#x27;s film was included in the 2011 DVD/Blu-ray release of &quot;We Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;.

Having contracted cancer and facing mortality, Ray and his son Tim conceived a documentary about a father-son relationship. That idea, and Ray&#x27;s hunger to continue working, led to the involvement of German filmmaker Wim Wenders, who had previously employed Ray as an actor, in a small but notable role in &quot;The American Friend&quot; (1977). Their collaboration, &quot;Lightning Over Water&quot; (1980), also known as &quot;Nick&#x27;s Film&quot;, uses documentary footage and dramatic constructions, juxtaposing film and video. It charts their passage in making a film, as well as recording events of Ray&#x27;s last months, including directing a stage scene with actor Gerry Bamman, and directing and acting a scene with Ronee Blakley (then married to Wenders), inspired by &quot;King Lear&quot;. The film was completed after Ray&#x27;s death, in June 1979.

==Death==
Ray was diagnosed with lung cancer in November 1977, though he may have contracted the disease several years earlier. He was treated with cobalt therapy, and in April 1978 radioactive particles were implanted as treatment. The next month, he had surgery to remove a brain tumour. He survived another year, dying of heart failure on June 16, 1979, in New York City. His ashes were buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in La Crosse, Wisconsin.

== Directing techniques ==
Ray&#x27;s directorial style and preoccupations evident in his films have led critics to consider him an auteur. Further, Ray is considered a central figure in the development of auteur theory itself. He was often singled out by Cahiers du cinéma critics who coined the term to designate exemplars (alongside such major figures as Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks) of film directors who worked in Hollywood, and whose work had a recognizable and distinctive stamp seen to transcend the standardized industrial system in which they were produced. Still, critic Andrew Sarris, among the first to popularize auteurism in the United States, placed Ray below his &quot;Pantheon,&quot; and in his second-rung category &quot;The Far Side of Paradise,&quot; in his 1968 assessment of sound-era American directors: &quot;Nicholas Ray is not the greatest director who ever lived; nor is he a Hollywood hack. The Truth lies somewhere in between.&quot;

=== Acting ===
Like many US theatre practitioners of the 1930s, Ray was strongly influenced by the theories and practices of early-twentieth century Russian dramatists, and the system of actor training that evolved into &quot;Method acting.&quot; Late in life, he told students, &quot;My first orientation to the theatre was more toward Meyerholdt, then Vakhtangov, than Stanislavsky,&quot; citing Vakhtangov&#x27;s notion of &quot;agitation from the essence&quot; as being &quot;a principal guideline for me in my directing career.&quot; On a few occasions, he was able to work with actors who were so trained, notably James Dean, but as a director working in the Hollywood studio system, most of his performers were trained classically, on stage, or in the studios themselves. Some found Ray agreeable as a director, while others resisted his methods. On &quot;Born To Be Bad&quot;, for example, Ray started rehearsals with a table read, then customary in a stage production but less so for a film, and star Joan Fontaine found the exercise discomfiting, tainting her relationship with the director, whom she thought &quot;not right for this kind of picture.&quot; On the same film, Joan Leslie appreciated Ray&#x27;s hands-on direction, even though they differed in their interpretation of a scene. Their co-star, the Reinhardt-trained Robert Ryan, remembered favourably his second Ray project, &quot;On Dangerous Ground&quot;: &quot;He directs very little... Right from the start of our collaboration, he offered me a very few suggestions. ... He never told me what to do. He was never specific about anything at all.&quot;

=== Themes and stories ===
Most of Ray&#x27;s films take place in the United States, and biographer Bernard Eisenschitz stresses the distinctively American themes that run through his motion pictures, and Ray&#x27;s life. His early work alongside Alan Lomax, as a WPA folklorist and then in radio, and his acquaintance with musicians including Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Pete Seeger and Josh White, informed his approach to American society in his films, and the interest in ethnography evident in his films. Ray frequently made films characterized by their examination of outsider figures, and most of his movies implicitly or explicitly critique conformity. With examples including &quot;They Live By Night&quot; and &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, he has been cited for his sympathetic treatment of contemporary youth, but other films of his adeptly deal with the crises of more experienced and older characters, among them &quot;In A Lonely Place&quot;, &quot;The Lusty Men&quot;, &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; and &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot;. The stories and themes explored in his films stood out in their time for being non-conformist and sympathetic to or even encouraging of instability and the adoption of then-questionable morals. His work has been singled out for the unique way in which it &quot;define[s] the peculiar anxieties and contradictions of America in the ’50s.&quot;

=== Visual style ===
While he started working in Hollywood on film noir and other black-and-white pictures, in the standard Academy ratio, Ray later became better known for his vivid use of color and widescreen. His films have also been noted for their stylized &quot;mise en scène&quot; with carefully choreographed blocking and composition that often emphasizes architecture. Ray himself credited his affection for widescreen formats to Frank Lloyd Wright: &quot;I like the horizontal line, and the horizontal was essential for Wright.&quot; As V. F. Perkins observes, however, many of Ray&#x27;s compositions &quot;are deliberately, sometimes startlingly, unbalanced to give an effect of displacement,&quot; further noting his use of &quot;static masses with bold lines ... which intrude into the frame and at the same time disrupt and unify his compositions.&quot; Bernard Eisenschitz also links Wright to Ray&#x27;s desire to &quot;destroy the rectangular frame&quot; (as the filmmaker said, adding, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t stand the formality of it&quot;), through the multiple-image techniques he used in &quot;We Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;. He had envisioned using split-screen techniques as early as &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, and proposed, unsuccessfully, that &quot;The True Story of Jesse James&quot; be &quot;stylized in every respect, all of it shot on the stage, including the horses, the chases, everything, and do it in areas of light.&quot;

Ray uses color boldly — Jonathan Rosenbaum, for example, has referred to the &quot;vibrant color-coding&quot; of &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;, and the &quot;delirious color&quot; of &quot;Party Girl&quot;—but meaningfully, determined by the circumstances of the film&#x27;s story and its characters. As V. F. Perkins points out, he uses colors &quot;for their emotional effect,&quot; but more characteristically &quot;for the extent to which they blend or clash with background.&quot; The reds that Cyd Charisse wears in &quot;Party Girl&quot;, for instance, &quot;have an autonomous emotional value,&quot; but also have impact measured against the &quot;somber browns of a courtroom&quot; or against &quot;the darker red of a sofa on which she sleeps.&quot; Ray himself used the latter example to discuss the varying meaning of color, referring to the red-on-red of James Dean&#x27;s jacket on a red couch, in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, as &quot;smoldering danger,&quot; while the same arrangement of Charisse&#x27;s gown and sofa &quot;was an entirely different value&quot; (which he did not specify). In &quot;Party Girl&quot;, he says, green was &quot;sinister and jealous,&quot; while in &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot; it was &quot;life, grass, and hospital walls,&quot; and, referring to the use of color in &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;, he cites the costuming of the posse in stark black and white. Implicitly their dress befits the situation—they have come directly from a funeral—but also situates them in stark contrast to Joan Crawford&#x27;s Vienna, the character they are persecuting, who changes her wardrobe, in a wide range of vivid colors, from one scene to the next.

About Ray&#x27;s editing style, V. F. Perkins describes it as &quot;dislocated ... [reflecting] the dislocated lives which many of his characters live,&quot; citing as a characteristic feature the use of camera movements that are in process at the start of the shot and not yet at rest at the end. Frequently, as well, Ray cuts abruptly, and disruptively, from the main action of a scene to the response, in close-up, of &quot;a character who is, to all appearances, only peripherally involved.&quot; Another distinctive trait is the frequent use of dissolves for scene transitions, &quot;more than most Hollywood directors of his time,&quot; as Terrence Rafferty points out, inferring from this, &quot;perhaps an indication of his general preference for fluidity over hard, nailed-down meanings.&quot; Ray himself cited comic strips as instructive, when he started in pictures, as providing examples that deviated from the most conventional Hollywood editing. He also remembered that when shooting his first film, the editor (Sherman Todd) encouraged him to &quot;shoot double reverses&quot; (that is, to violate the 180-degree rule), which he did, strategically, in several sequences of &quot;They Live By Night&quot;, &quot;In A Lonely Place&quot;, and other of his Hollywood films.

=== Genre ===
Ray distinguished himself by working in nearly every conventionalised Hollywood genre, infusing them with distinctive stylistic and thematic approaches: Crime films, within the film noir cycle: &quot;They Live By Night&quot;, &quot;In A Lonely Place&quot;, and &quot;On Dangerous Ground&quot;; the social problem film &quot;Knock On Any Door&quot;; Westerns: &quot;Run For Cover&quot;, &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;, and &quot;The True Story of Jesse James&quot;; Women&#x27;s pictures: &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Secret&quot; and &quot;Born To Be Bad&quot;; World War II dramas: &quot;Flying Leathernecks&quot; and &quot;Bitter Victory&quot;; the family melodrama: &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot; and &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot;: Epic spectacles: &quot;King of Kings&quot; and &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot;. Yet he also applied himself to films that fell between genres, such as the gangster film, punctuated by dance numbers but not quite a musical, &quot;Party Girl&quot;, and others of more marginalised categories—the rodeo film &quot;The Lusty Men&quot;, the ethnographic dramas &quot;Hot Blood&quot; and &quot;The Savage Innocents&quot;—or which even predicted more significant, later concerns, such as the ecologically themed drama &quot;Wind Across the Everglades&quot;.

==Personal life==

Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr. was the youngest child in his family, and the only boy, called &quot;Ray&quot; or &quot;Junior.&quot; His three sisters were significantly older than he: Alice, born 1900; Ruth, born 1903; and Helen, born 1905. (He had two half-sisters, from his father&#x27;s first marriage. They had both married but continued to live near their father.) Raymond Sr. was a building contractor, age forty-eight when his son was born. After World War I, he retired and moved his family from the small town of Galesville to his own hometown, the larger community of La Crosse, where they would be nearer his mother. Raymond Sr. loved to read and he loved music, and so did Ray, who remembered hearing Louis Armstrong and Lil Hardin, playing on the banks of the Mississippi River, around 1920. Mother Lena was a Lutheran and teetotaler, but the father drank and frequented speakeasies, and it was in one, when his father went missing in 1927, that Ray tracked down his father&#x27;s mistress, who led him to a hotel room where Raymond Sr. was insensate; he died the next day. Ray was sixteen.

As the youngest, Ray had been indulged by his mother and sisters, and now he was the only male in the family. One by one, though, his sisters left home. By 1924, Alice had completed training as a nurse, married and moved to Madison, and, by the time her father died, Oshkosh. Middle sister Ruth had taken Ray to his first movie, &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), and she was the first in the family with theatrical ambitions — &quot;stagestruck,&quot; as he later characterized her — but they were foiled by the family. She moved to Chicago and married a scientist, but indulged her love of the arts as an avid audience member. Helen too had performance in her veins, working awhile reading stories on a children&#x27;s radio broadcast, then becoming a teacher.

Increasingly unmanageable after his father&#x27;s death, Ray was sent to Chicago to live with his sister Ruth and enrol in Robert A. Waller High, returning to La Crosse Central midway through his final year. According to school newspapers and yearbooks, he was popular, with a good sense of humour about himself. He played football and basketball, and was a cheerleader, perhaps more social activities than athletic commitments. Debate was a greater interest, and he took elocution lessons, and then joined &quot;Falstaff Club,&quot; the school&#x27;s drama group, though not as an onstage presence. According to biographer Patrick McGilligan, as an adolescent he was &quot;fundamentally restless and lonely,&quot; and &quot;prone to long, ambiguous silences.&quot; This was characteristic of conversations with Ray for the rest of his life. Gifted with a mellifluous, deep voice, however, Ray won a scholarship to be an announcer at the local radio station, WKBH, for a year, while he was enrolled in La Crosse Teachers College. (Later, he would describe this award as &quot;a scholarship to any university in the world&quot;—a narrative embellishment typical of him. He reported that the summer following, he joined a troupe of stunt fliers, but also of working with an airborne bootlegger.)

As in high school, he joined the drama society, the Buskin Club, where he also found a girlfriend, Kathryn Snodgrass, daughter of the school president. They also collaborated as editors on the &quot;Racquet&quot;, the school newspaper, she on features, and he on sports, and as co-writers of a stage revue revolving around a college student who goes to Hollywood. The couple was known around campus as &quot;Ray and Kay.&quot; For the revue, titled &quot;February Follies&quot;, Ray took the stage, as compere. In April 1930, he advanced to play the lead in the school&#x27;s major production, of &quot;The New Poor&quot;, a 1924 comedy by Cosmo Hamilton&quot;.&quot; In due course, Ray led the Buskins, and started dressing the role of an early twentieth-century aesthete. As well, he started to offer more left-leaning political commentary in the college paper. He fostered other proclivities that would persist through most of his life. After he and Kay Snodgrass broke up, and she transferred to the university in Madison, he courted numerous young women, and balanced insomnia with alcohol-fed socializing all night long.

A hometown friend studying at the University of Chicago had pitched the benefits of his school, especially his classes with Thornton Wilder, who had already impressed Ray when he had seen the writer in La Crosse. Ray had improved his record and was eligible to transfer in Fall 1931. He was pledged to a fraternity and played some football, but by his own account he was more committed to the elements of college life that included drinking and pursuing college girls. As well, he later recounted a homosexual experience, when he was approached by the university&#x27;s Director of Drama, Frank Hurburt O&#x27;Hara (whom Ray does not name), reflecting that his own attitude, more tolerant than usual at that time, &quot;became very helpful to me in understanding and directing some of the actors with whom I&#x27;ve worked.&quot; Ray spent only one quarter at the University of Chicago, and returned to La Crosse in December, resuming enrolment at Teachers College in autumn 1932, where he announced to readers of the school paper that he was &quot;apparently free of amorous entanglements,&quot; but also, &quot;I have been known to like a party.&quot; That same year, he and his friend Clarence Hiskey also agitated to start a chapter of the US Communist Party.

As 1932 ended, Ray left college, and, now calling himself Nicholas Ray, sought new opportunities, including, with the help of Thornton Wilder, meeting Frank Lloyd Wright, with the hope of joining Wright&#x27;s Fellowship at Taliesin. Lacking the tuition fee, in 1933 Ray ventured to New York City, where, staying in Greenwich Village, he had his first encounters with the city&#x27;s bohemia. There, shortly before his stint at Taliesin, Ray met young writer Jean Evans (born Jean Abrahams, later Abrams), and they started a relationship. After he returned east, they lived together, and married in 1936. When Ray took a position at the WPA in Washington, by January 1937 they had moved to Arlington, Virginia. They had one son, Anthony Nicholas (born November 24, 1937), known as Tony, and named for Ray&#x27;s friend and fellow Federal Theatre director Anthony Mann. Washington government life wore on both Ray and Evans, and Ray&#x27;s drinking and unfaithfulness strained their marriage. Evans moved back to New York in 1940, having found a job at PM, the new leftist newspaper. Ray returned to New York as well, in May of that year, but soon the couple separated. A few months later he again attempted to reconcile, while also living at Almanac House, a Greenwich Village loft occupied by Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, and Millard Lampell, core members of the Almanac Singers. He committed himself for a time to psychoanalysis, but in time fell back into old habits. Evans filed for divorce in December 1941, and the process was finalized the next summer.

Ray had been rejected for military service on medical grounds but worked for the Office of War Information (OWI), under John Houseman. There, Ray met Connie Ernst, the daughter of lawyer Morris L. Ernst, and a producer of &quot;The Voice of America&quot;. After his divorce, she and Ray lived together, in New York, from 1942 to 1944, when the OWI sent her to London prior to D-Day, and after she had begun seeing another staff member, Michael Bessie, whom she later married. Ray later wrote, &quot;We had once wanted to marry,&quot; though she had remembered his drinking and gambling, commenting, &quot;It was very tricky, being with Nick.&quot;

Relocating to Los Angeles to work with Elia Kazan, Ray first lived in a flat at the Villa Primavera, on the corner of Harper and Fountain, that became the model for the apartment building in &quot;In A Lonely Place&quot;, before moving into a house in Santa Monica. While at Fox, he socialized with fellow transplanted east coasters and theatre folk at Gene Kelly and Betsy Blair&#x27;s house, among them Judith Tuvim, soon to be known as Judy Holliday, whom he had briefly, unsuccessfully pursued in New York, after his marriage ended. On one occasion, fueled by alcohol, they waded into Santa Monica Bay, an excursion that turned into a halfhearted double suicide attempt, before they changed their minds and struggled back to dry land.

While directing &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Secret&quot;, he became involved with the film&#x27;s co-star, Gloria Grahame, later remembering, &quot;I was infatuated with her but I didn&#x27;t like her very much.&quot; Nonetheless, they married in Las Vegas on June 1, 1948, just five hours after her divorce from her first husband was granted, and five months before the birth of their son, Timothy, on November 12. (RKO announced that he was born &quot;almost four months before the date he was expected.&quot;) Tensions in their marriage were known early on, and by autumn 1949, while shooting &quot;In A Lonely Place&quot;, they had separated for the first time, keeping the split a secret from studio executives. At the end of the year, they announced that they planned to travel to Wisconsin, to spend the holidays with Ray&#x27;s family there, but he went alone, reuniting with his mother and three sisters, and then on to New York and Boston, to prepare his next project, &quot;On Dangerous Ground&quot;, and to see his ex-wife and firstborn. In 1950, as that project was ending and as &quot;In A Lonely Place&quot; was opening, Ray and Grahame were reported to have reconciled, living in Malibu, though their marriage remained dysfunctional. Ray stated that he had discovered Grahame in bed with his son, Tony, who was 13 years old at the time. Although they were irreparably estranged, Ray and Grahame were nominally connected again, when he was called on to help rescue &quot;Macao&quot; (1952), a project Josef von Sternberg was directing for RKO. Ray directed additional scenes, but evidently none in which she was featured. Grahame filed for divorce, and she testified in court that Ray had struck her twice, once at a party and once in private, at home, before the divorce was granted, on August 15, 1952. Gloria Grahame and Tony Ray married in 1960 and divorced in 1974. Tony Ray died June 29, 2018, age 80.

The HUAC investigations of Hollywood and the entertainment industry, which largely coincided with Ray&#x27;s marriage to and divorce from Gloria Grahame, further weighed on him. Fellow RKO employees, such as Edward Dmytryk and Adrian Scott, were among the Hollywood 10, who had been cited for contempt of Congress in the aftermath of the 1947 hearings; &quot;Knock On Any Door&quot; and &quot;In A Lonely Place&quot; star Bogart was a charter member of the Committee for the First Amendment, which protested against the hearings; and Ray&#x27;s old friend Elia Kazan testified confidentially in 1952, first refusing to name names, and later doing so, in order to protect his career. The date and content of Ray&#x27;s own communication with the committee are unknown (McGilligan reports a gap in Ray&#x27;s Freedom of Information files, between 1948 and 1963), but his ex-wife Jean Evans remembered that he admitted to her that he testified she &quot;was the one who brought him to the Communist Youth League, which wasn&#x27;t true at all.&quot;

Although he had been wary of therapy, by court order in the divorce, he started seeing psychoanalyst Carel Van der Heide. Even so, he continued womanizing (columnist Dorothy Kilgallen called him &quot;a well-known movie colony heartbreaker&quot;) and drinking, both prodigiously. He had romances with both Shelley Winters and Marilyn Monroe, who were roommates at the time, as well as Joan Crawford — with whom he was planning a suspense film, &quot;Lisbon&quot;, in 1952, and who later starred in &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; — and Zsa Zsa Gabor. More lasting was his relationship with German Hanne Axmann (also known as Hanna Axmann, and later Hanna Axmann-Rezzori), who aimed to start an acting career. She left her troubled marriage to actor Edward Tierney to live with Ray at, by her account, a desultory time for him, of drinking, gin rummy and analysis that did him little good. While he was preparing &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; (which featured her brother-in-law, Scott Brady), Ray asked her to return to Germany, and said he would join her there. He did not make good on that promise, though they remained in touch and friends for years thereafter.

&quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; was placed reasonably well on &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;1954 Boxoffice Champs,&quot; increasing his professional capital. By now, he had moved into Bungalow 2 at the Chateau Marmont, his headquarters while shooting &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot;, a project of particular importance to him, about troubled young people. That was where he pitched his need to make such a film to Lew Wasserman, prompting his agent to send him to Warner Bros. The hotel residence also became Ray&#x27;s headquarters and rehearsal space, and it was where James Dean arrived, aiming to meet the director. Dean started to attend Ray&#x27;s &quot;Sunday afternoons,&quot; his regular gatherings of friends at the bungalow, where scenes of the film to come were starting to take shape. Natalie Wood remembered Ray&#x27;s relationship with Dean as &quot;fatherly,&quot; and attributed the same quality to Sal Mineo&#x27;s and her own connection to their director, even though the sixteen year-old also was sexually attracted to him, and his bungalow became the site of their assignations, while she was also involved with supporting player Dennis Hopper. Ray himself was also busy with roommates Monroe and Winters, Geneviève Aumont (then the professional name of Michèle Montau), and even Lew Wasserman&#x27;s wife, Edie, while also interested in Jayne Mansfield, whom he tested for the role Wood won in &quot;Rebel&quot;.

Ray and Wood continued their affair for several months after production wrapped, and while he was shooting his next project, &quot;Hot Blood&quot; (1956), a pregnancy scare, which turned out to be false, prompted her to break off the romance. Dean had had apprehensions about Ray, but their trust, partnership and friendship grew, and they talked about forming a production company, collaborating again, and, after &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot; opened, sharing a Nicaragua holiday. None of those plans materialized, with Dean&#x27;s death in a car crash, on September 30, 1955, that left Ray devastated and bereft. On a European tour at the time, he sought comfort with Hanne Axmann, and again in alcohol, in Germany. According to one friend, Ray had been more moderate for some time, and especially during the summer when he was working on &quot;Rebel&quot;, but, realizing that the filmmaker was drinking as he was, concluded; &quot;I think it was all over on that September night of 1955.&quot;

Some biographers state that Ray was bisexual, alleging his experience at the University of Chicago was the start of his sexual experimentation. Ray denied this in 1977, responding to a question about Ray&#x27;s use of James Dean&#x27;s &quot;probable bisexuality&quot; in a sequence of &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; involving Dean and Sal Mineo. First, Ray responds that he doesn&#x27;t understand whether the interviewer is referring to Dean&#x27;s bisexuality, Mineo&#x27;s, &quot;or the bisexuality of myself&quot;, then states, &quot;I am not bisexual, but anyone who denies having had a fantasy or a daydream denies having eaten a bowl of potatoes, mashed potatoes, you know, it has the same reality.&quot; Returning to Europe, in London, Ray met Gavin Lambert, with whom he had corresponded since Lambert&#x27;s pioneering positive review of &quot;They Live By Night.&quot; Talking about &quot;In A Lonely Place&quot;, Lambert remembered Ray&#x27;s comments about Dix Steele, Bogart&#x27;s character, at the film&#x27;s end: &quot;Will he become a hopeless drunk, or kill himself, or seek psychiatric help? Those have always been my personal options, by the way.&quot; After a night of vodka and conversation, at 3:30 am, Ray and Lambert, who was gay, had sex, and Ray cautioned &quot;that he wasn&#x27;t really homosexual, not really even bisexual,&quot; advising that he had slept with many women, &quot;but only two or three men.&quot; The next day, Ray urged Lambert to accompany him to Hollywood to work on what became &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot;, and Lambert remained a sometimes-sexual partner, while Ray continued to pursue women. According to Lambert, Ray &quot;behaved like a possessive lover, expecting me to be always here on call...&quot; while Ray continued to dwell on the loss of James Dean.

&quot;Bigger Than Life&quot; tells the story of a man who grows reliant on his abuse of medication, and consequently more and more broken. The connections to Ray, who had grown increasingly dependent on both alcohol and drugs, were not lost, even on Ray. In 1976, Ray confessed to himself, in a private journal entry, that he had lived in a &quot;continuous blackout between 1957 or earlier until now,&quot; and his wife Susan, on seeing the film, commented to her husband, &quot;This is your story before you lived it.&quot; Ray&#x27;s drug use was abetted, while he was shooting &quot;Bitter Victory&quot;, by his new girlfriend, a heroin addict named Manon, and his gambling losses led him to a pitiable state that broke his friendship with Gavin Lambert.

Seventeen-year-old Betty Utey first crossed paths with Ray in 1951, at RKO, when he was assigned to direct some additional scenes for &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; (1952), including one with a troupe of bikini-clad dancers. He described it as the &quot;steam room of the vestal virgins.&quot; Some weeks after shooting the scene, in which he featured her, he asked her out to the ballet and dinner, and then took her to the house he was renting, having split with Gloria Grahame. At the end of their evening, like &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot;, he called a cab and sent her home. She subsequently did not hear from him for almost three years, when he called her to come to his Chateau Marmont bungalow for an assignation. He then disappeared again, until 1956, when he called again. In 1958, she won a place as one of the chorines in &quot;Party Girl&quot;, and after shooting ended they eloped to Maine, where Ray hoped to start his third marriage by drying out. En route, he collapsed at Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport, suffering from the DTs. He recovered sufficiently to travel on to Kennebunkport, where the couple spent several weeks, before marrying on October 13, 1958. They had two daughters, both born in Rome: Julie Christina, on January 10, 1960, and Nicca, October 1, 1961. Ray&#x27;s mother Lena had died in March 1959.

In early 1963, the family moved from Rome to Madrid, where Ray used money from his Samuel Bronston contract to try to develop projects, which never came to fruition. With a partner, he opened a restaurant and cocktail lounge called Nicca&#x27;s, after his younger daughter, and it became the hangout for film people working in Madrid, but also a place for Ray to sink a fortune, reportedly a quarter-million of his dollars in its first year. To manage it, he hired his nephew, Sumner Williams (whom he had cast in several pictures through the 1950s). Ray continued his chronic habits: too many drinks and pills, too little sleep. He and his wife separated in 1964, and she returned to the US with their children, while he remained in Europe. They remained married until January 1, 1970, when their divorce was finalised and Betty Ray remarried.

Through the middle of the 1960s, Ray lived peripatetically, setting up in Paris, London, Zagreb, Munich and, for a while, Sylt, a German island in the North Sea. He had reacquainted himself with younger son Tim, then at Cambridge, and enlisted him to help with an autobiography — the elder Ray would record his recollections, and the younger would transcribe — for which a publisher had provided an advance, though no such memoir appeared in Nick Ray&#x27;s lifetime. Wherever he went, his friends and acquaintances were accustomed to Ray cadging a handout. &quot;Periodically he stopped drinking,&quot; writes Bernard Eisenschitz, &quot;switching to a diet of black coffee, going through stretches without sleep, then crashing for forty-eight hours at a time.&quot; Retrospectives of his films were marking the growth in his reputation, especially outside the US, including a double bill of &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; and &quot;They Live By Night&quot; in Paris, in May 1968, placing Ray and his son amid the political uprising.

He returned to the United States on November 14, 1969, landing in Washington, DC just in time for the second Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam. Soon after, he announced plans for a documentary about &quot;the young rebels of the 1960s,&quot; and relocated to Chicago, to shoot as the trial of the Chicago Eight, soon to become the Chicago Seven, proceeded. He filmed a party for the defendants and their team the evening of December 3, the day the prosecution ended its case. Overnight, the Chicago police killed Fred Hampton, Illinois chair of the Black Panther Party, in his sleep, and Ray and his crew were on the scene early in the morning to film the aftermath.

The project had mutated from a documentary to a strange dramatic reconstruction, for which Ray considered casting Dustin Hoffman or Groucho Marx or the long-retired James Cagney, as the trial judge, Julius Hoffman. According to Ray&#x27;s own account, in late January 1970, not untypically, Ray was working through the night, and he fell asleep at the editing table, waking to feel a &quot;heavy&quot; sensation in his right eye. &quot;It took me six hours to find a doctor, and if I had made it twenty minutes sooner, they would have been able to inject nicotinic acid and save the eye.&quot; He was hospitalized from January 28 to February 6, and according to writer Myron Meisel, that was Ray&#x27;s first treatment for cancer. Despite this explanation, Ray remained somewhat elusive about the exact cause, and McGilligan notes several possible sources and witnesses to Ray&#x27;s diminished vision, including a special-effects blast fifteen years previous, while shooting &quot;Run For Cover&quot; (1955). After 1970, however, Ray started regularly wearing a key prop in the construction of his mystique. He was tall, craggy, with a leonine mane of white hair, and now a black patch over his right eye, looking, in the remembrances of his student Charles Bornstein, &quot;like a cross between Noah, a pirate, and God!&quot;

During the trial, Chicago Seven lawyer William Kunstler introduced Ray to Susan Schwartz, an eighteen-year-old newly arrived to study at the University of Chicago, who skipped classes to watch the courtroom theatrics. In February 1970, as the jury deliberated, she found herself in a taxi, on the way to join the hive of activity that surrounded Ray at his house. &quot;After only one day on Orchard Street,&quot; she later wrote, &quot;the decision was easy: at the end of the term I would quit school and join the adventure, whatever it was.&quot; They became companions, and the adventure lasted until the end of Ray&#x27;s life, and beyond.

They relocated to New York City, where Schwartz worked, in real estate and then publishing, to make a living for both of them while Ray sought money to continue work on the film and start other projects. They stayed with Ray&#x27;s old cronies, including Alan Lomax and Connie Bessie, before finding a place of their own, while Ray continued to indulge his addictions and at night haunt the seamier corners of Times Square. When they crossed paths at a Grateful Dead show at the Fillmore East, Dennis Hopper invited Ray to his house in Taos, New Mexico, where Hopper was editing &quot;The Last Movie&quot; (1971). There Ray again found chaos of creativity and debauchery, of a type he had come to thrive upon, at least until the costs of hosting Nicholas Ray — Nicca Ray heard her father ran up a phone bill of $2,500, while Hopper himself likely exaggerated it as $30,000 a month — caused Hopper to ask him to leave. In Taos, Ray asked Susan to marry him, giving her his ring, and in return she gave him a pearl.

While in New Mexico, in spring 1971, Ray was invited to speak at Harpur College, an academic unit of the State University of New York at Binghamton. The event he presented convinced Larry Gottheim and Ken Jacobs that Ray should join them on faculty in the Cinema Department, then one of the epicenters of experimental film in the US. Appointed on a two-year contract in the fall of 1972, Ray initially lived in an apartment in the university&#x27;s infirmary. He then rented a farmhouse, and the hours that students spent there, time that he demanded of them, turned it into a communal living and working situation, redolent of his Chateau Marmont bungalow while making &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot;, or, before that, the 1930s New York scene of political theatre and music, though with cannabis and harder drugs (including amphetamines and cocaine) added to alcohol and creativity as fuel.

&quot;There was increasing tension that became animosity,&quot; recalled one of the students, principally between Jacobs and Ray. In part their differences might have stemmed from the different aesthetics of the two artists. Jacobs and Gottheim worked within the largely non-narrative and to varying degrees poetic and formalist realm of experimental film, while Ray&#x27;s background was in drama and mainstream narrative cinema. Nonetheless, the project upon which he embarked with his students, envisioned as a feature-length film, first called &quot;Gun Under My Pillow&quot; (alluding to the character Plato, in &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot;) and finally titled &quot;We Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;, might have been seen as consistent with the avant-garde approaches to filmmaking that the department represented. As well, however, he and Jacobs were both, in the recollection of one student, &quot;extremely strong-willed individuals, with tempers,&quot; and they came into conflict, in Gottheim&#x27;s view, involving &quot;a need for control and loyalty,&quot; especially from their students. There were other points of contention, however, including the monopolization and abuse of the department&#x27;s filmmaking equipment by Ray&#x27;s project and student crew, as well as Ray&#x27;s drug and alcohol habits and his students&#x27; emulation of him. As department chair, Gottheim had mediated the friction between his colleagues, but in spring 1973 Jacobs became acting chair, escalating the conflict; shortly thereafter, Ray&#x27;s contract was not renewed. Jacobs would later characterize hiring Ray as a &quot;calamitous error.&quot;

Ray&#x27;s goal was to work on &quot;We Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;, in order to screen it at the Cannes Film Festival, in May 1973. Leaving Binghamton, followed by a few students who drove the film&#x27;s elements across country in a driveaway car, he travelled wherever he might find cheap or free editing facilities, money to continue the project, and friends who would tolerate him as a guest. He started in Los Angeles, where he wound up back in Bungalow 2 at the Chateau Marmont, running up bills and seeking investment from his old Hollywood connections. But it was Susan who managed to find the money to get them both, and the film, to France. Ray&#x27;s reputation in Europe might have helped secure a screening slot at Cannes, but it failed to convince the press and any other festivalgoers that the film warranted notice.

At loose ends, Ray and Susan spent some time in Paris, borrowing money from his longtime champion François Truffaut and racking up hotel costs paid by writer Françoise Sagan. Susan returned to New York, and Ray stayed awhile on a boat owned by Sterling Hayden, his &quot;Johnny Guitar,&quot; from almost twenty years before. Ray travelled to Amsterdam, shooting a segment, &quot;The Janitor&quot;, for the feature-length &quot;Wet Dreams&quot; (1974), a softcore anthology produced by Max Fischer. He returned to New York by the end of the year, but in March 1974 he went back west, to the San Francisco Bay Area. The purpose was a retrospective of his films at the Pacific Film Archive, but he came with boxes of footage and personal goods, intending to stay awhile. He lived in a spare room at archive curator Tom Luddy&#x27;s residence and worked overnight shifts in the editing rooms of Francis Coppola&#x27;s Zoetrope facility, and, after he wore out that welcome, at the film collective CIne Manifest. While in the area, Ray was taken to hospital twice, once for alcoholic haemorrhaging. The first time, Luddy called Tony Ray to tell him of the fear that Ray would die, and Ray&#x27;s son declined to do anything, and the second time, Luddy similarly called John Houseman, who happened to be in the area, meeting a similar dismissal.

Later in 1974, Ray returned to Southern California, to stay with his ex-wife Betty and their daughters, Julie, now fourteen, and Nicca, almost thirteen, whom he had not seen since they left Spain, ten years previous. &quot;It was like seeing a man who had been emptied out,&quot; Betty recalled. She arranged for a house where he could stop drinking, but soon determined that he needed medical supervision and had him admitted to the detoxification unit at Los Angeles County Hospital. Ray resumed using, however, even persuading his older daughter to buy cocaine for him. On his departure, he left a letter advising that &quot;it is best I live apart from you and our children,&quot; for many reasons, ending, &quot;above all others I can bring you no joy.&quot;

He was deeply saddened by Sal mineo&#x27;s passing and attended his funeral in February 1976. They reconnected when Sal and his long-term partner Courtney Burr was invited to Ray&#x27;s house in 1971. And, shortly after, he returned to New York City, where he was offered the opportunity to direct a film starring Marilyn Chambers and Rip Torn, which Ray titled &quot;City Blues&quot;, but financing fell through by July 1976, and the project never materialised. He continued to drink and abuse drugs heavily, and found himself in and out of hospital, with a variety of maladies and injuries due to impairment. Finally, Susan left him, and, on professional advice, gave him the ultimatum that she would not return unless he checked in to the Smithers Alcoholism and Rehabilitation Center, and was sober for one month. Shortly after, he had himself admitted. He remained for ninety days, and was discharged early in November 1976. He started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and he and Susan moved into a Soho loft, at 167 Spring Street.

In early 1977, Ray started to realize some new opportunities. In March, Wim Wenders cast him in a small but notable role, alongside Dennis Hopper, in &quot;The American Friend&quot; (1977). At the same time, with the support of old friends Elia Kazan and John Houseman, he started to present workshops on acting and directing at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, and then at New York University. He was also approached about directing a couple of films, including &quot;The Story of Bill W.&quot;, about the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. In November 1977, however, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Surgery showed that the tumour was too close to his aorta to be safely removed, so he received cobalt therapy.

He had travelled to California in summer 1977, taking Betty and Nicca to dinner, and leaving his daughter a letter that caused her to &quot;start believing that Nick understood me better than Betty ever would.&quot; He returned west in February 1978 to play a bit part in Miloš Forman&#x27;s &quot;Hair&quot; (1979). Where he had looked robust in &quot;The American Friend&quot;, he now looked gaunt and drawn. After his scenes were shot, he visited Houseman in Malibu, and he summoned Nicca, so that he could tell his daughter that he was dying of cancer. They remained in contact, and though she hoped to travel to New York, it was the last time they saw each other.

On April 11, 1978, Ray underwent additional surgery, at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, involving therapeutic implantation of radioactive particles. Then, on May 26, he had surgery again, to remove a tumour on his brain. He was frail and coughed painfully and he had lost his hair; yet he was still active, and was hired to teach another summer workshop at NYU. He was then invited by László Benedek — once Ray&#x27;s contemporary, as a Hollywood director, now chair of the NYU graduate film program — to teach in the autumn. He assigned Ray a teaching assistant, soon to become a friend, Jim Jarmusch.

With the imminent prospect of his death, Ray had spoken with his son Tim about making a documentary about a father-son relationship. Though that project remained unpursued, Tim Ray, experienced in cinematography, joined the crew that assembled to make &quot;Lightning Over Water&quot;, a collaboration of Ray and Wenders, though credited collectively to all the participants. With no appetite, and increasingly unable to swallow, Ray was wasting away, and had to be admitted to hospital for intravenous feeding, restoring some weight and buying some time. Ray was visited by friends including Kazan, Connie Bessie, Alan Lomax and his first wife, Jean, as well as students from Harpur College, and his more recent students.

Ray died in hospital of heart failure on June 16, 1979. A memorial was held at Lincoln Center shortly after. Among the attendees were all four of his wives and all four of his children. He was survived by two sisters, Helen and Alice (Ruth had died in a fire, in 1965), and his ashes were returned to La Crosse, Wisconsin, his hometown, and interred in the same section of Oak Grove Cemetery as his parents. His grave bears no inscription.

==Influence==
In the decades after his professional peak, and since his death, filmmakers continue to cite Ray as an influence and object of admiration.

* As a critic, Victor Erice has commented on Ray&#x27;s films with great affection, also collaborating with Jos Oliver on a catalogue for a 1986 retrospective, &quot;Nicholas Ray y su tiempo&quot;. Erice was also interviewed about &quot;We Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot; for the documentary, &quot;Don&#x27;t Expect Too Much&quot;. Asked to comment on any continuities between Ray&#x27;s work and his own filmmaking in 2004, however, he demurred, though he has also remarked on a connection between his film &quot;El Sur&quot; (1983), and &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;.
* Jean-Luc Godard wrote in his review of &quot;Bitter Victory&quot;: &quot;There was theatre (Griffith), poetry (Murnau), painting (Rossellini), dance (Eisenstein), music (Renoir). Henceforth there is cinema. And the cinema is Nicholas Ray.&quot; In addition, Godard&#x27;s films abound in references and allusions to Ray&#x27;s films. In Godard&#x27;s film, &quot;Contempt&quot; (1963), the character played by Michel Piccoli claims to have written Ray&#x27;s &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot;, and in &quot;La Chinoise&quot; (1967) a young Maoist defends the politics of &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; to his anti-American colleagues. &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; is also one of the film titles used as code names by the &quot;Front de libération de Seine et Oise&quot; guerillas in the concluding sequence of &quot;Weekend&quot; (1967). Referring to Ray and Samuel Fuller, Godard dedicated &quot;Made in U.S.A.&quot; (1966), &quot;À Nick et Samuel qui m&#x27;ont élevé dans le respect de l&#x27;image et du son.&quot; [&quot;To Nick and Samuel who taught me with respect to image and sound.&quot;] Godard had seen some of Ray&#x27;s multiple-image work, Ray affirmed, before Godard&#x27;s ventures into the format, with &quot;Numéro deux&quot; (1975) and &quot;Ici et ailleurs&quot; (1976).
* Director Curtis Hanson discusses &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; in a documentary supplement included on the 2003 Columbia DVD release, and later also included on the 2016 Criterion Collection Blu-ray release. Ray&#x27;s film was one of many influences on his direction of &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997).
* Jim Jarmusch, having been Ray&#x27;s teaching assistant at NYU, has spoken on several occasions of the lessons he&#x27;s learned, citing two in particular. Comparing making a film to assembling a &quot;string of beads,&quot; Ray urged the aspiring filmmaker when shooting one scene not to think of any of the other &quot;beads.&quot; With this principle, Jarmusch learned the value of shooting out of sequence and of shooting a film&#x27;s final scene last, a recommendation he remembers receiving from both Ray and Fuller. Ray also told Jarmusch that he gave actors notes separately, reasoning that each actor brings individual thoughts and ideas to a scene. Jarmusch, however, also allowed that, in working with actors, Ray would use &quot;psychological games&quot; and other manipulative tactics, &quot;...things that I personally would never do.&quot; From Ray&#x27;s work, Jarmusch claims that he learned to be attentive to everything that&#x27;s seen in a film, while also cautioning, &quot;I never would ever compare myself in any way to Nick...&quot; More broadly, Jarmusch cited Ray&#x27;s personal impact, affirming, “He gave me a sense of myself, in a way.” Jarmusch&#x27;s first feature, &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; (1980), includes a scene set in the St. Mark&#x27;s Cinema, where a &quot;The Savage Innocents&quot; poster is hanging, and the protagonist asks the popcorn seller about the picture. His 2013 film, &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot;, revives the title of an unmade Ray project. The stories are unrelated, but a photo of Ray is evident in one scene.
* Martin Scorsese admires Ray&#x27;s work, particularly his expressionistic use of color in &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;, &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, and &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot; (1956). He used clips from two of them in his documentary &quot;A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies&quot;.
* François Truffaut wrote reviews of several Ray films for the Paris weekly &quot;Arts/Spectacles&quot; in the 1950s, some later adapted for his book, &quot;Les Films de ma vie&quot; (&quot;The Films of My Life&quot;). He asserts that &quot;They Live by Night&quot; (1949) is Ray&#x27;s best movie, but gives special attention to his films &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot; and &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;. Truffaut also appears as an interview subject in the 1975 documentary about Ray, &quot;I&#x27;m a Stranger Here Myself&quot;.
* Wim Wenders is another European admirer of Ray&#x27;s and has paid homage to him in many movies. Some of his films are indebted to Ray, from the title of his science fiction film &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; (which were the last spoken words in Ray&#x27;s biblical epic &quot;King of Kings&quot;) to the casting of Dennis Hopper (who appeared in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;) and the expressionistic use of colour in his own film &quot;The American Friend&quot;. He gave Ray a small but key role in the film: an artist, presumed dead, who forges his own work. He also co-directed Ray&#x27;s final film, the experimental documentary &quot;Lightning Over Water&quot;, and edited it after Ray&#x27;s death. The film is a touching portrait of the final days of Nicholas Ray&#x27;s life.

<text>STS-79 was the 17th flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and the 79th mission of the Space Shuttle program. The flight saw &quot;Atlantis&quot; dock with the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot; to deliver equipment, supplies and to exchange personnel participating in long-duration stays aboard the station as part of the Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; program. A variety of scientific experiments were also conducted aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; by her crew. It was the first shuttle mission to rendezvous with a fully assembled Mir, and the fourth rendezvous of a shuttle to the space station.

==Mission highlights==
STS-79 was the first shuttle mission to a fully completed Mir space station, following the arrival of its Priroda module. &quot;Atlantis&quot; carried the Orbiter Docking System. This spaceflight was highlighted by the collection of American astronaut Shannon Lucid after 188 days in space, the first American crewmember exchange aboard the Russian Space Station Mir, and the fourth Shuttle-Mir docking. Lucid&#x27;s long-duration spaceflight set a new American record, as well as worldwide spaceflight record for a woman astronaut. She embarked to Mir March 22 on the STS-76 mission. Succeeding her on Mir for an approximately four-month stay was John Blaha, who returned in January 1997 with the STS-81 crew. American astronaut Jerry Linenger replaced him.

STS-79 also marked the second flight of the SPACEHAB module in support of a Shuttle-Mir docking and the first flight of the SPACEHAB Double Module configuration. The forward portion of the double module housed experiments conducted by the crew before, during and after &quot;Atlantis&quot; was docked to the Russian space station. The aft portion of the double module housed the logistics equipment to be transferred to Mir, which included food, clothing, experiments, supplies, and spare equipment. The mass of the module was .

The Shuttle-Mir link-up occurred at 15:13 UTC on September 18, following R-bar approach. Hatches opened at 05:40 on September 19, and Blaha and Lucid exchanged places at 11:00. Awaiting Blaha on Mir were Valery Korzun, Mir 22 commander, and Alexander Kaleri, flight engineer.

During five days of mated operations, the two crews transferred more than of supplies to Mir, including logistics, food, and water generated by &quot;Atlantis&#x27;s&quot; fuel cells. Three experiments were also transferred: the Biotechnology System (BTS) for study of cartilage development; the Material in Devices as Superconductors (MIDAS) experiment to measure electrical properties of high-temperature superconductor materials; and the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA), containing several smaller experiments, including self-contained aquatic systems.

About of experiment samples and equipment were transferred from Mir to &quot;Atlantis&quot; and the total logistical transfer to and from station of more than was the most extensive to date. During her approximately six-month stay on Mir, Lucid conducted research in the following fields: advanced technology, Earth sciences, fundamental biology, human life sciences, microgravity research and space sciences. Specific experiments included: Environmental Radiation Measurements to ascertain ionizing radiation levels aboard Mir; Greenhouse-Integrated Plant Experiments, to study effect of microgravity on plants, specifically dwarf wheat; and Assessment of Humoral Immune Function During Long-Duration Space Flight, to gather data on effect of long-term spaceflight on the human immune system and involving collection of blood serum and saliva samples. Some of this research was conducted in the newest and final Mir module, Priroda, which arrived at station during Lucid&#x27;s stay.

Three experiments remained on &quot;Atlantis&quot;: Extreme Temperature Translation Furnace (ETTF), a new furnace design allowing space-based processing up to 871 degrees Celsius (1,600 degrees Fahrenheit) and above; Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG) complement of 128 individual samples involving 12 different proteins; and Mechanics of Granular Materials, designed to further understanding of behavior of cohesionless granular materials, which could in turn lead to better understanding of how Earth&#x27;s surface responds during earthquakes and landslides.

As with all Shuttle-Mir flights, risk-mitigation experiments were conducted to help reduce development risk for the International Space Station. Flying for first time was the Active Rack Isolation System (ARIS), an experiment rack designed to cushion payloads from vibration and other disturbances.

Conducted near the end of STS-79 was a test using &quot;Atlantis&#x27;s&quot; small vernier jets to lower her orbit. A similar maneuver was made at end of second Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission, STS-82, to re-boost Hubble to a higher orbit while still in orbiter payload bay.

<text>Nova Friburgo (; ; ), commonly referred to as just Friburgo, is a municipality in the state of Rio de Janeiro in southeastern Brazil. It is located in the mountainous region, in the Center Mesoregion of the state, from the capital Rio de Janeiro. The town is above sea level, with a population of 191,158 (2020) and its area is 933 km2.

The main economic activities are the undergarment industry, olericulture, goat raising, various industries (textile, clothing, metallurgy) and tourism. It is also the coldest city of the state.

== History ==

Up to the 19th century, the region of the present Nova Friburgo was inhabited by Coroado Purí Indians. In 1818, King John VI was interested in improving the relationship with Germany, in order to obtain support against the French empire. He then proposed a planned settlement that would promote the civilization in Brazil. A royal decree of May 1818, authorized the Canton of Fribourg of Switzerland, to establish a colony of 100 Swiss families in the Morro Queimado Farm, in Cantagalo District, a place with climate and natural characteristics similar to those in their country. 

Between 1819 and 1820, the region was settled by 265 Swiss families, in total 1,458 immigrants. It was named Nova Friburgo (New Fribourg) by the Swiss after the homeland of most of the families.

Following the Independence of Brazil in 1822, the Imperial Government continued the policy of populating the nation by attracting European colonization. Eighty German families previously assigned to settlements in the Province of Bahia, for unknown reasons ended up in Nova Friburgo, where they arrived on the 3 and 4 May 1824. Similar arrivals of Italians, Portuguese and a minority of Syrians led to such population increases that the once village was elevated to city status on 8 January 1890.

In 1872, the Baron of Nova Friburgo brought to the region the Leopoldina Railroad, to allow for the flow of the coffee from Cantagalo. Agriculture was the basis of economic activity until 1910, when the arrival of industrialists pioneered the development of an industrial sector still thriving to the present day. Of similar importance was the relative proximity to Niterói and Rio de Janeiro and the improvement of transport and communication links such as paved roads and telegraph. This encouraged a small tourist industry to grow, which, together with local commerce, became the main source of income for the city.

Nova Friburgo was affected by the 2011 Brazilian floods on 11 January with mudslides causing at least 820 deaths and more than 200 people to go missing in the biggest natural disaster in the history of Brazil. The population was left with no water, electricity, food or gas.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===

Nova Friburgo has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification Cwb), with fresh and dry winters and humid and mild summers. Annual average temperature is . The hottest temperature ever recorded was on 15 October 1948, and the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 8 August 2014.


== Economy ==

The city has a strong drive towards tourism due to the landscape, rivers, trails and bucolic spots. It has the second largest network of hotels of the state, after the capital Rio de Janeiro. The urban district is visited for its cold climate, the tranquility and romanticism. However, there are also attractions more distant to the center, which are appreciated by those who are interested in ecotourism and adventure sports like rafting and canoeing. The district of Lumiar is one of the most important sites for these sports in the state.

Nova Friburgo is known as the national capital of the undergarment industry, due to the vast production and variety of models, and the local brands begin to compete in the international market. Other major industries include textile mills and metallurgic industries.

Agriculture is important in the area of olericulture and goat raising, as well as in the production of flowers, of which the municipality is the second largest producer in the country, surmounted only by Holambra, in the state of São Paulo.

The municipality contains part of the Central Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest Mosaic of conservation units, created in 2006.
It contains of the Macaé de Cima Environmental Protection Area, created in 2001.

<text>STS-80 was a Space Shuttle mission flown by Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. The launch was originally scheduled for October 31, 1996, but was delayed to November 19 for several reasons. Likewise, the landing, which was originally scheduled for December 5, was pushed back to December 7 after bad weather prevented landing for two days.

It was the longest Shuttle mission ever flown at 17 days, 15 hours, and 53 minutes.

Although two spacewalks were planned for the mission, they were both canceled after problems with the airlock hatch prevented astronauts Tom Jones and Tammy Jernigan from exiting the orbiter.

==Crew==
=== Crew seat assignments ===

Musgrave was supposed to sit in Seat 5 during landing, however, he actually stood on the flight deck behind Cockrell in Seat 1 throughout re-entry and landing to film the spacecraft&#x27;s reentry through the overhead windows.

==Mission highlights==

* The mission deployed two satellites and successfully recovered them after they had performed their tasks.
* Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer-Shuttle Pallet Satellite II (ORFEUS-SPAS II) was deployed on flight day one. It was captured on flight day sixteen.
* The Wake Shield Facility-3 was deployed on flight day 4, and was recaptured three days later.
* The mission was the longest mission in Space Shuttle history.
* On this mission, Story Musgrave became the only person to fly on all five Space Shuttles – &quot;Challenger&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Endeavour&quot;, and &quot;Columbia&quot;.
* Musgrave also tied a record for spaceflights, and set a record for being the oldest man in space. Both records have since been surpassed.
* Two spacewalks were planned for the mission but were canceled after astronauts Tom Jones and Tammy Jernigan discovered the outer hatch of the airlock was jammed. The jam was attributed to a loose screw that may have fell during its installation.

==Mission payload==

&quot;Columbia&quot; brought with it two free floating satellites, both of which were on repeat visits to space. Also, a variety of equipment to be tested on two planned spacewalks was part of the payload. These would have been used to prepare for construction of the International Space Station. Included in the Shuttle&#x27;s payload were:
* Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer-Shuttle Pallet Satellite II (ORFEUS-SPAS II)
** Far Ultraviolet (FUV) Spectrograph
** Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Spectrograph
** Interstellar Medium Absorption Profile Spectrograph (IMAPS)
** Surface Effects Sample Monitor (SESAM)
** ATV Rendezvous Pre-Development Project (ARP)
** Student Experiment on ASTRO-SPAS (SEAS)
* Wake Shield Facility (WSF-3)
* NIH-R4
* Space Experiment Module (SEM)
* EVA Development Flight Tests (EDTF-5)
** Crane
** Battery Orbital Replacement Unit
** Cable Caddy
** Portable Work Platform
*** Portable Foot Restraint Work Station (PFRWS)
*** Temporary Equipment Restraint Aid (TERA)
*** Articulating Portable Foot Restraint
** Body Restraint Tether (BRT)
** Multi-Use Tether (MUT)
* Visualization in an Experimental Water Capillary pumped Loop (VIEW-CPL)
* Biological Research In Canister (BRIC)
* Commercial Materials Dispersion Apparatus Instrumentation Technology Associates Experiment (CCM-A) (formerly STL/NIH-C-6)
** Commercial MDA ITA Experiment (CMIX-5)

==Scientific projects==

&quot;Columbia&quot; carried into orbit two satellites that were released and recaptured after some time alone. The first was the Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer-Shuttle Pallet Satellite II (ORFEUS-SPAS II). The main component of the satellite, the ORFEUS telescope, had two spectrographs, for far and extreme ultraviolet.

Another spectrograph, the Interstellar Medium Absorption Profile Spectrograph, was also on board the satellite. Several payloads not relevant to astronomy rounded out the satellite. It performed without problems for its flight, taking 422 observations of almost 150 astronomical bodies, ranging from the Moon to extra-galactic stars and a quasar. Being the second flight of ORFEUS-SPAS II allowed for more sensitive equipment, causing it to provide more than twice the data of its initial run.

Also deployed from &quot;Columbia&quot; was the Wake-Shield Facility (WSF), a satellite that created an ultra-vacuum behind it, allowing for the creation of semiconductor thin films for use in advanced electronics. WSF created seven films before being recaptured by &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; robotic arm after three days of flight. The craft was on its third mission, including STS-60, when hardware problems prevented it from deploying off the robotic arm. Wake Shield was designed and built by the Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center at the University of Houston in conjunction with its industrial partner, Space Industries, Inc.

Another inclusion was a Space Experiment Module (SEM). The SEM included student research projects selected to fly into space. This was the first flight of the program. Among the experiments conducted were analysis of bacteria growth on food in orbit, crystal growth in space, and microgravity&#x27;s effect on a pendulum.

NIH.R4 was an experiment conducted for the National Institute of Health and Oregon Health Sciences University. It was designed to test the effects of spaceflight on circulation and vascular constriction. Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) explored gravity&#x27;s effects on tobacco and tomato seedlings. Visualization in an Experimental Water Capillary Pumped Loop (VIEW-CPL) was conducted to test a new idea in thermal spacecraft management. The Commercial MDA ITA Experiment were a variety of experiments submitted by high school and middle school students sponsored by Information Technology Associates.

==Mission background==
Astronauts were selected for the mission on January 17, 1996. Stacking of the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) began September 9, 1996. On September 18, the launch date was bumped back from no earlier than (NET) October 31 to November 8. Payload doors were closed on September 25. The following day, the External fuel tank was mated to the SRBs inside the Vehicle Assembly Building.

Further progress was delayed while two windows on the orbiter were replaced; NASA feared that they might be susceptible to breakage after seven and eight flights. &quot;Columbia&quot; was rolled over to the VAB on October 9 to begin final assembly preparations.
On October 11, &quot;Columbia&quot; was mated with the external fuel tank, and the payload was delivered and transferred. Rollout to Pad 39B occurred on October 16, which was followed by flight readiness checks of the main propulsion system.

After a Flight Readiness Review on October 28, an additional FRR was requested to further analyze the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) due to nozzle erosion that occurred on STS-79; on the 29th, a fuel pump failed, delaying the fueling process of &quot;Columbia&quot;. The erosion problem led to a week long delay instituted on November 4. A launch date of November 15 was set, contingent on a successful Atlas launch two days prior. The forecast of bad weather pushed the launch back even further, to a date of November 19.

During landing, Jones planned to use a video camera to capture footage of the plasma tube trailing behind the orbiter from the overhead windows. He asked Musgrave to assist with the recording, with the expectation that he would take his seat on the mid-deck once the orbiter reached entry interface. Instead, Musgrave elected to remain standing on the flight deck behind Commander Cockrell (in Seat 1) throughout re-entry and landing. Jones estimated that the 61-year-old Musgrave would have experienced 1.7 times the normal force of Earth&#x27;s gravity for five to ten continuous minutes after 18 days of near weightlessness.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15.
Each track is specially chosen, often by their families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>The Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA), is in charge of environmental protection and of the study, planning, and management of the Nicaragua&#x27;s natural resources. It was formerly known as the Nicaraguan Institute of Natural Resources and the Environment (IRENA). The ministry was created in 1979 by the Government of Nicaragua .

==Origins==
In 1976, a group of Nicaraguan environmentalists proposed that the government create a Ministry of Natural Resources. The president at the time, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, rejected the idea and threatened the group with harsh reprisals if they met again. Some took to the forests and mountains to join the Sandinista guerrillas who were fomenting revolution against the Somoza government. Less than a week after the Somoza regime was overthrown and Sandinista government became known as MARENA. By the mid-1980s, MARENA received aid and advice from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, Cuba, Mexico, the Organization of American States, the United Nations Environment Programme, and individual United States citizens.

==Overview==
MARENA initiates and manages programs in reforestation, watershed management, pollution control, wildlife conservation, national parks, and the conservation of genetic diversity.

In 1981, MARENA found that half of water sources they sampled were seriously polluted by sewage and that 70,000 pounds of raw sewage was released into Lake Managua each day. Scores of industrial plants located on the lake&#x27;s shore had freely dumped there for over a decade. The worst polluter was Pennwalt Corporation. MARENA could not afford, however, to build a sewage treatment plant because of the financial costs involved. Recently a treatment plant has been completed and the sewer network is being constructed.

In 1982, MARENA established seasonal hunting bans for 26 endangered species of mammals and 4 species of reptiles. This was in response to Nicaragua being a world leader in the export of rare and endangered species such as White-lipped peccaries, White-tailed deer, hawksbill turtles, freshwater otters, jaguars, ocelots, and margays. Educational campaigns were initiated by MARENA, along with marketplace and roadside inspections. By 1985, however, many of these bans were lifted because of the growing economic crisis in the country.

In 1983, MARENA targeted nearly one-fifth of Nicaragua&#x27;s territory for national parks. This project was never realized, however, because the Contras had militarized much of the wilderness.

To address deforestation, MARENA directed major tree planting projects. Two million trees were grown annually in nurseries until 1986, when civil war and economic difficulties slowed the program. The reforestation projects became targets for the Contras, who sabotaged projects, and kidnapped and murdered over 50 MARENA employees.

<text>Bristol Aerospace is a Canadian aerospace firm located in Winnipeg, Manitoba and is an operating division of Magellan Aerospace. Once part of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, today it is known as Magellan Aerospace, Winnipeg.

==History==
Bristol Aerospace began in 1930 as the MacDonald Brothers Aircraft Company. Brothers Jim and Grant MacDonald moved to Winnipeg from Nova Scotia in 1904 to start a sheet metal business. Brother Edwin joined them later and by the late 1920s air travel had become an important means of transportation with Winnipeg becoming a hub for travel to the booming west. The MacDonalds formed MacDonald Brothers Aircraft Company in 1930, producing seaplane floats under licence from EDO Corporation of New York City. The company produced floats into the early 1980s.

===WWII===
During World War II the factory built training aircraft and by war&#x27;s end had grown to 4,500 employees. At the end of the war, MacDonald Bros. became an important repair and overhaul centre for the Royal Canadian Air Force. Their location at the centre of the country lowered the average travel cost for aircraft to the factories, as well as providing aviation jobs in the Canadian west. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s the company performed depot level inspection and repair for many of Canada&#x27;s fighter aircraft.

===Purchase by the Bristol Aeroplane Company===
In 1954, MacDonald Brothers Aircraft was purchased by the British Bristol Aeroplane Company, becoming their Canadian division. The company was an important supplier of accessories for jet engines, building the exhaust pipes for the Avro CF-100 Canuck and later becoming the primary maintenance depot for the aircraft. During the 1950s and 60s Bristol built on their experience in precision sheet metal work to become a major supplier of hot section components for various engine manufacturers.

===CRV7===
In the second half of the 1950s Bristol was selected to build several test rocket airframes for CARDE&#x27;s ongoing research into high-power solid fuel propellants. After initial research completed in the early 1960s, Bristol started selling a &quot;lightened&quot; version of the test vehicle as the Black Brant for sounding rocket use and opened the Rockwood Propellant Plant in 1962. The plant is located 25 minutes north of Winnipeg, in the community of Stony Mountain, Manitoba. As a result of this work, Bristol entered into a partnership with Aerojet General and became Bristol Aerojet the same year. This experience was later applied in the early 1970s to a new 2.75&quot; (70 mm) motor for use in US-standard rocket launchers, leading to the CRV7, which has since become the standard NATO 2.75&quot; rocket.

Since the incorporation of &#x27;smart&#x27; weapons for the CF-18, Bristol no longer makes CRV-7 motors for the Canadian military. Production has dropped over the years although several smaller contracts to allied air forces have kept the plant active. A purchase by the Royal Air Force for rocket motors was completed recently along with the sale of 200 redundant launchers that were in long-term storage. As of January 2010, the company has lost contracts with several countries and militaries around the world, thus causing layoffs at the Rockwood plant.

===CF-101 contract===
In the early 1960s Bristol won the maintenance contract for the CF-100&#x27;s replacement, the CF-101 Voodoo. This plane had been plagued with afterburner problems and Bristol started a research project to correct the issues. Their resulting proposal was accepted and both the Canadian and USAF F-101s were modified by Bristol, doubling the lifetime of the engines. Bristol retained the maintenance contract for the Canadian CF-101s until the last one was retired in 1987.

===Bristol Aerospace===

In 1967 the parent Bristol Aeroplane, whose UK aircraft construction division had been incorporated into the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) in 1960, was purchased for its Bristol-Siddeley engine business by Rolls-Royce, and renamed Bristol Aerospace. It remained part of Rolls-Royce though nationalization and subsequent privatization again.

In the late 1960s, and the early 1970s under the joint U.S.-Canadian project known as the Meteorological Data Sounding System (MDSS) the company developed meteorological sounding rockets for the U.S. Army and other user agencies, such as U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The MDSS rockets were lighter, more reliable, and less expensive than those being in use by the Army.

During the 1970s the company continued to be involved in overhaul and maintenance work, and the CRV7 became a major product line.

The concept for the Wire Strike Protection System (WSPS) evolved from a tragic helicopter crash in Italy in April 1976 where 444 Squadron CH-136 Kiowa helicopters were conducting rescue missions following the earthquake in northern Italy. Maj Andre Seguin, then a flight commander with 444 Tactical Helicopter Squadron out of Lahr, West Germany conceived the wire protection system following a fatal wirestrike. The Unit CO tried to get formal recognition for Seguin for the concept during late 1976, but there was no meaningful support from the Canadian headquarters. Bristol shortly thereafter took the idea and developed it. They subsequently patented the WSPS for helicopters, which cuts cables on impact. These devices can be found on many helicopters today, in the form of angular &quot;blades&quot; projecting from the top and bottom of the cabin area.
In January 1987, Bristol was awarded the maintenance contract for the Canadian Forces Canadair CF-5 fleet, as a consolation contract for losing the more lucrative and longer-term CF-18 maintenance and overhaul contract to Canadair. The CF-5 effort lasted until 1995 when the federal government decided to remove them from service. Afterward Bristol was contracted to sell off the redundant aircraft to other interested air forces and offered to include a major upgrade to the avionics system. Bristol brokered a deal in 1996 for the purchase of ten single-seat and three dual-seat CF-5s by the Botswana Defence Force, but this was the only sale to be made. The company returned the two CF-5D demonstration aircraft to CFB Trenton (for storage) in March 2004, ending over 70 years of aircraft repair and overhaul. The company then refocused its energies on fabricating sub-assemblies and other components for the commercial aircraft business.

===Purchase by Magellan Aerospace===
In June 1997 Rolls-Royce plc sold Bristol for $62,500,000 to Magellan Aerospace, a corporation formed by the merger of a number of Canadian and US aerospace firms. Since then Magellan has accelerated its consolidation of the various divisions located in Canada, the United States and Britain under the Magellan &#x27;brand&#x27; logo reducing the visibility and independence of Bristol Aerospace. Staffing at the Winnipeg plant is now under 600 people while the Rockwood facility in Stony Mountain is approximately 50 personnel.

In 1999 Bristol won the contract for SCISAT-1, the first purely Canadian science satellite since 1971. With its successful launch on 12 August 2003, the basic systems were selected by the Canadian Space Agency as a generic small-satellite &quot;bus&quot;, with plans to launch more over the next decade.

Bristol has also worked in Canadian nuclear reactor construction. It has supplied core components, CANDU reactor tubes and thermal sleeves to AECL and GE.

==Products==
The company designed and manufactures the Black Brant series of sounding and research rockets.

Magellan (Bristol) now produces aircraft sub-assemblies and engine components for all the major aerospace companies. Some examples include but are not limited to:
#Boeing 767 heat pan, Boeing 737 composite panels and Boeing 747 wing to Body Fairings

<text>Power Rangers Wild Force is a television series and the tenth season of Power Rangers. It is also the anniversary season of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise, based on the 25th Super Sentai series &quot;Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger&quot;, which itself was the 25th anniversary of Super Sentai.

&quot;Power Rangers Wild Force&quot; is the last season to be produced by Saban and first by Disney, following the sale of Fox Family Worldwide (renamed ABC Family Worldwide) including Saban Entertainment (renamed BVS Entertainment) to Disney by Haim Saban and News Corporation, Fox&#x27;s parent company. The first part of the series was originally broadcast from February to August 2002 on the Fox Kids television block. The show was moved in the fall 2002 to ABC&#x27;s new Saturday morning block, ABC Kids (formerly Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning).

==Plot==
Millennia prior, a group of warriors from the lost world of Animaria fought to defeat a race of monsters called the Orgs. In the 21st century, the Orgs resurface with increased power through humanity&#x27;s pollution. To stop them, Princess Shayla of Animaria&#x27;s remnants, the floating island Animarium, recruits five humans to become Power Rangers and join forces with the Wild Zords to stop the Orgs once more.

<text>Rudolf Karl Bultmann (; ; 20 August 1884 – 30 July 1976) was a German Lutheran theologian and professor of the New Testament at the University of Marburg. He was one of the major figures of early 20th-century biblical studies. A prominent critic of liberal theology, Bultmann instead argued for an existentialist interpretation of the New Testament. His hermeneutical approach to the New Testament led him to be a proponent of dialectical theology.

Bultmann is known for his belief that the historical analysis of the New Testament is both futile and unnecessary, given that the earliest Christian literature showed little interest in specific locations. Bultmann argued that all that matters is the &quot;thatness,&quot; not the &quot;whatness&quot; of Jesus, i.e. only &quot;that&quot; Jesus existed, preached, and died by crucifixion matters, not what happened throughout his life.

Bultmann relied on demythologization, an approach interpreting the mythological elements in the New Testament existentially. Bultmann contended that only faith in the kerygma, or proclamation, of the New Testament was necessary for Christian faith, not any particular facts regarding the historical Jesus.

==Background==
Bultmann was born on 20 August 1884 in Wiefelstede, Oldenburg, the son of Arthur Kennedy Bultmann, a Lutheran minister. He did his &quot;Abitur&quot; at the Altes Gymnasium in the city of Oldenburg, and studied theology at Tübingen. After three terms Bultmann went to the University of Berlin for two terms, and finally to Marburg for two more terms. He received his degree in 1910 from Marburg with a dissertation on the Epistles of St Paul written under the supervision of Johannes Weiss. He also studied under Hermann Gunkel and Wilhelm Heitmüller. After submitting a habilitation two years later, he became a lecturer on the New Testament at Marburg.

Bultmann married Helene Feldmann on 6 August 1917. The couple had three daughters. Bultmann&#x27;s wife died in 1973.

After brief lectureships at Breslau and Giessen, Bultmann returned to Marburg in 1921 as a full professor, and stayed there until his retirement in 1951. His doctoral students included Hans Jonas, Ernst Käsemann, Günther Bornkamm, Helmut Koester, and Ernst Fuchs. He also taught Hannah Arendt. From autumn 1944 until the end of the Second World War in 1945 he took into his family Uta Ranke-Heinemann, who had fled the bombs and destruction in Essen.

Bultmann became friends with Martin Heidegger who taught at Marburg for five years. Heidegger&#x27;s views on existentialism had an influence on Bultmann&#x27;s thinking. What arose from this friendship was a &quot;sort of comradery&quot; grounded on an active and open dialogue between Bultmann and Heidegger from 1923 to 1928. However, Bultmann himself stated that his views could not simply be reduced to thinking in Heideggerian categories, in that &quot;the New Testament is not a doctrine about our nature, about our authentic existence as human beings, but a proclamation of this liberating act of God.&quot;

He was critical of Nazism from the beginning and his career between 1933 and 1941 was marked by a series of struggles with Nazis regarding their influence upon the universities and the Protestant Church. As a Lutheran who held that the Church could not expect the Nazi State to be Christian, he did not directly denounce its anti-Semitism. But he objected to its claim to have authority over all aspects of German life including the universities and the Protestant church and believed it was his responsibility to preach that it was unChristian, especially after Heidegger gave his pro-Nazi rectorial address in 1933. He particularly rejected the Aryan paragraph that disenfranchised all people racially Jewish from civic organizations and many professions including clergy, entailing defrocking any Christian clergy with Jewish ancestry. He stated that the Aryan paragraph was &quot;incompatible with the essence of the Christian church&quot;, since the church made no distinction between Jew and Gentile. He joined the Confessing Church, a Protestant movement in Nazi Germany that arose in opposition to government-sponsored efforts to unify all Protestant churches into a single pro-Nazi Reich Church.

Bultmann received many honors during and after his career, including honorary doctorates from many universities and elections to honorary societies. In 1974, the Federal Republic granted him the highest level of the Order of Merit.

He died on 30 July 1976 in Marburg.

== Theological approaches ==
Bultmann&#x27;s &quot;History of the Synoptic Tradition&quot; (1921) remains highly influential as a tool for biblical research, even among scholars who reject his analyses of the conventional rhetorical pericopes (narrative units) which comprise the gospels, and the historically-oriented principles of &quot;form criticism&quot; of which Bultmann was the most influential exponent.
According to Bultmann&#x27;s definition, &quot;[t]he aim of form-criticism [&quot;sic&quot;] is to determine the original form of a piece of narrative, a dominical saying or a parable. In the process we learn to distinguish secondary additions and forms, and these in turn lead to important results for the history of the tradition.&quot;
In 1941 Bultmann applied form criticism to the Gospel of John, in which he distinguished the presence of a lost Signs Gospel on which John—alone of the evangelists—depended. His monograph, &quot;Das Evangelium des Johannes&quot;, highly controversial at the time, became a milestone in research into the historical Jesus. The same year his lecture &quot;New Testament and Mythology: The Problem of Demythologizing the New Testament Message&quot; called on interpreters to demythologize the New Testament; in particular he argued for replacing supernatural biblical interpretations with temporal and existential categorizations. His argument, in many ways, reflected a hermeneutical adaption of the existentialist thought of his colleague at the time, the philosopher Martin Heidegger - but also the hermeneutic procedures developed by Hans Jonas, a student of Heidegger and an exile from Nazi Germany. This approach led Bultmann to reject doctrines such as the pre-existence of Christ. Bultmann believed his endeavors in this regard would make accessible to modern audiences — already immersed in science and technology — the significance (or existential quality) of Jesus&#x27; teachings. Bultmann thus thought of his endeavor of &quot;demythologizing the New Testament proclamation&quot; as fundamentally an evangelism task, clarifying the &quot;kerygma&quot;, or gospel proclamation, by stripping it of elements of the first-century &quot;mythical world picture&quot; that had potential to alienate modern people from Christian faith:

It is impossible to repristinate a past world picture by sheer resolve, especially a &quot;mythical&quot; world picture, now that all of our thinking is irrevocably formed by science. A blind acceptance of New Testament mythology would be simply arbitrariness; to make such acceptance a demand of faith would be to reduce faith to a work.
Bultmann saw theology in existential terms, and maintained that the New Testament was a radical text, worthy of understanding yet questioned in his time because of the prevailing Protestant conviction in a supernatural interpretation. In both the boasting of legalists &quot;who are faithful to the law&quot; and the boasting of the philosophers &quot;who are proud of their wisdom&quot;, Bultmann finds a &quot;basic human attitude&quot; of &quot;highhandedness that tries to bring within our own power even the submission that we know to be our authentic being&quot;. Standing against all human high-handedness is the New Testament, &quot;which claims that we can in no way free ourselves from our factual fallenness in the world but are freed from it only by an act of God ... the salvation occurrence that is realized in Christ.&quot; Bultmann remained convinced that the narratives of the life of Jesus offered theology in story form, teaching lessons in the familiar language of myth. They were not to be excluded, but given explanation so they could be understood for today. Bultmann thought faith should become a present-day reality. To Bultmann, the people of the world appeared to be always in disappointment and turmoil. Faith must be a determined vital act of will, not a culling and extolling of &quot;ancient proofs&quot;. Bultmann said about salvation and eternity: &quot;As from now on there are only believers and unbelievers, so there are also now only saved and lost, those who have life and those who are in death.&quot;

Bultmann carried form criticism so far as to call the historical value of the gospels into serious question. Despite that, Bultmann was an outspoken opponent of the Christ myth theory. In his book &quot;Jesus and the Word&quot;, he wrote:&quot;Of course the doubt as to whether Jesus really existed is unfounded and not worth refutation. No sane person can doubt that Jesus stands as founder behind the historical movement whose first distinct stage is represented by the oldest Palestinian community&quot;

Concerning the relationship between body, soul, and Spirit, he affirmed a monistic point of view.

== Legacy and criticism ==
Bultmann was an outstanding teacher, and he encouraged independence of mind among his students. The result was two major developments within the “Bultmann school.” In 1954 Ernst Käsemann raised “the question of the historical Jesus” (i.e., the question of the significance of knowledge of the historical Jesus for Christian faith), and a number of Bultmann’s pupils developed a position independent of their teacher’s on the matter. Then Ernst Fuchs and Gerhard Ebeling, building on Bultmann’s existentialist analysis, developed a method of interpreting the New Testament that emphasized the linguistic mode of human existence, giving birth to the so-called new hermeneutic. Bultmann himself took part in these discussions along with his pupils for as long as his health permitted, later living quietly in Marburg, where he died in 1976.

Posthumously, Bultmann’s approach to the New Testament has been subject to increasing criticism, which has led modern scholars to overcome his theorems. According to the theologian and historian of Christianity Larry Hurtado, Bultmann &quot;approached the ancient Christian texts with a theological criterion, a particular formulation of &quot;justification by faith&quot;, which he used to judge whether the writings were valid or not.&quot; John P. Meier believes that Bultmann had a &quot;disconcerting way of solving problems with a few evasive sentences, his arguments do not hold up, despite having been handed down for generations.&quot; Bart D. Ehrman, while agreeing with some of Bultmann&#x27;s positions, underlines that &quot;among our ranks there are no more form critics that agree with the theories of Bultmann, the pioneer of this interpretation&quot;. According to Werner H. Kelber, &quot;Today it is no exaggeration to claim that a whole spectrum of main assumptions underlying Bultmann&#x27;s &quot;Synoptic Tradition&quot; must be considered suspect.&quot;

Bultmann&#x27;s skeptical approach to the New Testament has received criticism from conservative biblical scholars like Klaus Berger and Craig Blomberg. Form criticism, in particular, has been challenged in recent years by Martin Hengel, Richard Bauckham and Brant J. Pitre, who have reasserted the traditional theory that the Gospels were written by eyewitnesses.

<doc id="526932" wikidata="Q1436315" url="?curid=526932" title="Football League Fourth Division">
<text>The Football League Fourth Division was the fourth-highest division in the English football league system from the 1958–59 season until the creation of the Premier League prior to the 1992–93 season. Following the creation of the Premier League, the fourth tier of English football was renamed the Football League Third Division, before being rebranded as Football League Two in 2004.

== History ==
The Fourth Division was created in 1958 alongside a new national Third Division by merging the regionalised Third Division North and Third Division South. The original economic reasons for having the two regional leagues had become less apparent and thus it was decided to create two national leagues at levels three and four. The twelve best teams of each regional league in 1957–58 went into the Third Division, and the rest became founder members of the Fourth Division.

Founder members of Fourth Division were:
* From Third Division North: Barrow, Bradford (Park Avenue), Carlisle United, Chester City, Crewe Alexandra, Darlington, Gateshead, Hartlepools United, Oldham Athletic, Southport, Workington, York City
* From Third Division South: Aldershot, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Exeter City, Gillingham, Millwall, Northampton Town, Port Vale, Shrewsbury Town, Torquay United, Walsall, Watford

Before 1987, the top four teams were promoted to the Third Division and the bottom four teams were subject to a re-election vote by other league clubs to determine whether they would remain in the league. Automatic relegation to the Conference was introduced in 1987, the same year the fourth promotion place began to be decided through a play-off.

The highest average league attendance in the Fourth Division was 19,092, achieved by Crystal Palace in the 1960/61 season. The highest attendance at an individual match was recorded the same season: 37,774 for the Good Friday game at Selhurst Park between Crystal Palace and Millwall.

==Promotions and relegation==
Automatic relegation between the Fourth Division and the Conference was introduced for the 1986–87 season.

<text>Sylvain Mizrahi (February 14, 1951 – January 13, 2021), known professionally as Sylvain Sylvain, was an American rock guitarist, most notable for being a member of the New York Dolls.

==Early years==
Sylvain was born in Cairo, Egypt, to a Syrian Jewish family, who fled in the 1950s, first to France and finally to New York, United States. They lived first on Lafayette Avenue in Buffalo, New York, but later moved to the New York City neighborhood of Rego Park, Queens, while he was still a child. Sylvain had dyslexia. He attended Newtown High School in Queens and Quintano&#x27;s School for Young Professionals in Manhattan.

Prior to joining the New York Dolls, Sylvain and future New York Doll bandmate Billy Murcia ran a clothing company called &quot;Truth and Soul&quot;, which helped define his fashion sense and would play a role in the band&#x27;s groundbreaking look. He had one brother, Leon (deceased), and one sister, Brigitte.

==Career==

Before joining the New York Dolls in 1971, Sylvain was a member of the band Actress, which also featured Arthur Kane, Johnny Thunders and former fashion partner, Billy Murcia. He played rhythm guitar for the Dolls from 1971 until the group&#x27;s dissolution in 1977. Sylvain and singer David Johansen were the last remaining members at the time the group broke up for the final time. After the first dissolution of the Dolls, he frequently played with Johansen on some of his solo records. He started his own band, The Criminal$, with another ex-Doll, Tony Machine, and continued to play the New York club scene. He landed a solo recording contract with RCA, and released one album with Lee Crystal (drums; later of Joan Jett&#x27;s Blackhearts) and Johnny Ráo (guitar).

He moved to Los Angeles in the early 1990s and recorded one record, &quot;Sleep Baby Doll&quot; for Fishhead Records. His bandmates on this record were: Brian Keats, drums, John Carlucci, bass, and Olivier LeBaron&#x27; on lead guitar, with guest appearances by Frank Infante of Blondie and Derwood Andrews of Generation X. In the late 90s he teamed up with the LA punk band The Streetwalkin&#x27; Cheetahs for some touring and they recorded a live radio broadcast on KXLU that remains unreleased. The tour ended with an Atlanta show at the Navarre annual conference co-headlining with John Entwistle. In 2004 he reunited with the surviving members of the New York Dolls, along with Steve Conte, Brian Koonin and Brian Delaney. Arthur Kane, who died in 2004, was replaced by Sami Yaffa of Hanoi Rocks. They released three records: &quot;One Day It Will Please Us To Remember Even This (2005)&quot;, &quot;Cause I Sez So (2009)&quot;, and &quot;Dancing Backward in High Heels (2011)&quot;. The reunion was filmed as part of a documentary on former band member Kane that was released in 2005 as &quot;New York Doll&quot;.

On March 18, 2010, at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas, Sylvain and Cheetah Chrome of The Dead Boys and Rocket from the Tombs debuted their new band, The Batusis. Their EP is on Smog Veil Records.

In November 2012, Sylvain posted a video for his new single, &quot;Leaving New York&quot;, on the Internet, and available on iTunes on December 2, 2012.

In 2013 and 2014 Sylvain joined with Glen Matlock as the Sex Doll Tour.

In 2015, Sylvain emerged with a new band called Sylvain Sylvain and the Sylvains from Austin, Texas, consisting of Chris Alaniz (drums), Jason &quot;Ginchy&quot; Kottwitz (guitar), and Gabriel Von Asher (bass). In March 2016, they performed at South by Southwest.

In 2018, Sylvain joined forces with Steve Conte, Sami Yaffa, and Robert Eriksson for two one-off dates in Tokyo as &quot;The Dolls&quot;. They played at Shinjuku Marz on February 11, and Shimokitazawa Garden on February 12.

==Personal life==
After living in Atlanta for several years, Sylvain moved to Nashville in 2015.
On April 27, 2019, Sylvain announced that he had cancer. He set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to help pay for treatment. He died from cancer at his home on January 13, 2021, at age 69.

<doc id="526936" wikidata="Q464915" url="?curid=526936" title="American Historical Association">
<text>The American Historical Association (AHA) is the oldest professional association of historians in the United States and the largest such organization in the world. Founded in 1884, AHA works to protect academic freedom, develop professional standards, and support scholarship and innovative teaching. It publishes &quot;The American Historical Review&quot; four times annually, which features scholarly history-related articles and book reviews. 

AHA is the major learned society for historians working in the United States, while the Organization of American Historians is a field society for historians who study and teach about the United States. The AHA&#x27;s congressional charter of 1889, established it &quot;for the promotion of historical studies, the collection and preservation of historical manuscripts, and for kindred purposes in the interest of American history, and of history in America.&quot;

==Activities ==
AHA operates as an umbrella organization for the discipline of history, and works with other major historical organizations and acts as a public advocate for the field. Within the profession, the association defines ethical behavior and best practices, particularly through its &quot;Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct&quot;. AHA also develops standards for good practice in teaching and history textbooks.

The association publishes &quot;The American Historical Review&quot;, a major journal of history scholarship covering all historical topics since ancient history and &quot;Perspectives on History&quot;, the monthly news magazine of the profession. In 2006 the AHA started a blog focused on the latest happenings in the broad discipline of history and the professional practice of the craft that draws on the staff, research, and activities of the AHA.

The association&#x27;s annual meeting each January brings together more than 5,000 historians from around the United States to discuss the latest research and discuss how to be better historians and teachers. Many affiliated historical societies hold their annual meetings simultaneously. The association&#x27;s web site offers extensive information on the current state of the profession, tips on history careers, and an extensive archive of historical materials (including the G.I. Roundtable series), a series of pamphlets prepared for the War Department in World War II.

The association also administers two major fellowships, 24 book prizes, and a number of small research grants.

== History ==
The early leaders of the association were mostly gentlemen with the leisure and means to write many of the great 19th-century works of history, such as George Bancroft, Justin Winsor, and James Ford Rhodes. However, as former AHA president James J. Sheehan points out, the association always tried to serve multiple constituencies, &quot;including archivists, members of state and local historical societies, teachers, and amateur historians, who looked to it – and not always with success or satisfaction – for representation and support.&quot; Much of the early work of the association focused on establishing a common sense of purpose and gathering the materials of research through its Historical Manuscripts and Public Archives Commissions.

===Women and African Americans===
According to the Association,
Thavolia Glymph was elected president of the AHA for the term beginning in 2024. The 140th president, she is the first Black woman to hold that post.

=== Publication standards ===
From its founding, the association was largely managed by historians employed at colleges and universities, and served a critical role in defining their interests as a profession. The association&#x27;s first president, Andrew Dickson White, was president of Cornell University, and its first secretary, Herbert Baxter Adams, established one of the first history Ph.D. programs to follow the new German seminary method at Johns Hopkins University. The clearest expression of this academic impulse in history came in the development of the &quot;American Historical Review&quot; in 1895. Formed by historians at a number of the most important universities in the United States, it followed the model of European history journals. Under the early editorship of J. Franklin Jameson, the &quot;Review&quot; published several long scholarly articles every issue, only after they had been vetted by scholars and approved by the editor. Each issue also reviewed a number of history books for their conformity to the new professional norms and scholarly standards that were taught at leading graduate schools to Ph.D. candidates. From the AHR, Sheehan concludes, &quot;a junior scholar learned what it meant to be a historian of a certain sort&quot;.

=== AHA and public history ===
Meringolo (2004) compares academic and public history. Unlike academic history, public history is typically a collaborative effort, does not necessarily rely on primary research, is more democratic in participation, and does not aspire to absolute &quot;scientific&quot; objectivity. Historical museums, documentary editing, heritage movements and historical preservation are considered public history. Though activities now associated with public history originated in the AHA, these activities separated out in the 1930s due to differences in methodology, focus, and purpose. The foundations of public history were laid on the middle ground between academic history and the public audience by National Park Service administrators during the 1920s–30s.

The academicians insisted on a perspective that looked beyond particular localities to a larger national and international perspective, and that in practice it should be done along modern and scientific lines. To that end, the association actively promoted excellence in the area of research, the association published a series of annual reports through the Smithsonian Institution and adopted &quot;The American Historical Review&quot; in 1898 to provide early outlets for this new brand of professional scholarship.

===Establishing a national history curriculum===
In 1896, the association appointed a &quot;Committee of Seven&quot; to develop a national standard for college admission requirements in the field of history. Before this time, individual colleges defined their own entrance requirements. After substantial surveys of prevailing teaching methods, emphases and curricula in secondary schools, the Committee published &quot;The Study of History in Schools&quot; in 1898. Their report largely defined the way history would be taught at the high school level as a preparation for college, and wrestled with issues about how the field should relate to the other social studies. The Committee recommended four blocks of Western history, to be taught in chronological order—ancient, medieval and modern European, English, and American history and civil government—and advised that teachers &quot;tell a story&quot; and &quot;bring out dramatic aspects&quot; to make history come alive.[T]he student who is taught to consider political subjects in school, who is led to look at matters historically, has some mental equipment for a comprehension of the political and social problems that will confront him in everyday life, and has received practical preparation for social adaptation and for forceful participation in civic activities... The pupil should see the growth of the institutions which surround him; he should see the work of men; he should study the living concrete facts of the past; he should know of nations that have risen and fallen; he should see tyranny, vulgarity, greed, benevolence, patriotism, self-sacrifice, brought out in the lives and works of men. So strongly has this very thought taken hold of writers of civil government, that they no longer content themselves with a description of the government as it is, but describe at considerable length the origin and development of the institutions of which they speak. 

The association also played a decisive role in lobbying the federal government to preserve and protect its own documents and records. After extensive lobbying by AHA Secretary Waldo Leland and Jameson, Congress established the National Archives and Records Administration in 1934.

As the interests of historians in colleges and universities gained prominence in the association, other areas and activities tended to fall by the wayside. The Manuscripts and Public Archives Commissions were abandoned in the 1930s, while projects related to original research and the publication of scholarship gained ever-greater prominence.

=== Professional misconduct ===
The association started to investigate cases of professional misconduct in 1987, but ceased the effort in 2005 &quot;because it has proven to be ineffective for responding to misconduct in the historical profession.&quot;

=== Resolutions ===
The association historically avoided addressing contemporary politics and made no statements on the Vietnam War or South African apartheid. In 2007, the group Historians for Peace and Democracy presented a resolution against the Iraq War, which passed under president Barbara Weinstein. Since then, the association has passed resolutions against the Rohingya genocide, persecution of Uyghurs in China, Russian invasion of Ukraine, and political backlash to Diversity, equity, and inclusion, race and gender studies.

At the 2025 annual meeting, AHA members passed a resolution condemning scholasticide in the Israel-Gaza War by a 428-to-88 vote. Association elected council vetoed the resolution.

In challenging the reluctance of historians to join the national debate over teaching history in the schools, the authors argue that historians should remember the leading role that the profession once played in the making of school history. The AHA invented school history in the early 20th century and remained at the forefront of K–12 policymaking until just prior to World War II. However, it abandoned its long-standing activist stance and allowed school history to be submerged within the ill-defined, antidisciplinary domain of &quot;social studies.&quot;

<text>Chargaff&#x27;s rules (given by Erwin Chargaff) state that in the DNA of any species and any organism, the amount of guanine should be equal to the amount of cytosine and the amount of adenine should be equal to the amount of thymine. Further, a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of purine and pyrimidine bases (i.e., codice_1) should exist. This pattern is found in both strands of the DNA. They were discovered by Austrian-born chemist Erwin Chargaff in the late 1940s.

== Definitions ==

=== First parity rule ===
The first rule holds that a double-stranded DNA molecule, &quot;globally&quot; has percentage base pair equality: A% = T% and G% = C%. The rigorous validation of the rule constitutes the basis of Watson–Crick base pairs in the DNA double helix model.

=== Second parity rule ===
The second rule holds that both Α% ≈ Τ% and G% ≈ C% are valid for each of the two DNA strands. This describes only a global feature of the base composition in a single DNA strand.

== Research ==
The second parity rule was discovered in 1968. It states that, in single-stranded DNA, the number of adenine units is &quot;approximately&quot; equal to that of thymine (%A ≈ %T), and the number of cytosine units is &quot;approximately&quot; equal to that of guanine (%C ≈ %G).

In 2006, it was shown that this rule applies to four of the five types of double stranded genomes; specifically it applies to the eukaryotic chromosomes, the bacterial chromosomes, the double stranded DNA viral genomes, and the archaeal chromosomes. It does not apply to organellar genomes (mitochondria and plastids) smaller than ~20–30 kbp, nor does it apply to single stranded DNA (viral) genomes or any type of RNA genome. The basis for this rule is still under investigation, although genome size may play a role.

The rule itself has consequences. In most bacterial genomes (which are generally 80–90% coding) genes are arranged in such a fashion that approximately 50% of the coding sequence lies on either strand. Wacław Szybalski, in the 1960s, showed that in bacteriophage coding sequences purines (A and G) exceed pyrimidines (C and T). This rule has since been confirmed in other organisms and should probably be now termed &quot;Szybalski&#x27;s rule&quot;. While Szybalski&#x27;s rule generally holds, exceptions are known to exist. The biological basis for Szybalski&#x27;s rule is not yet known.

The combined effect of Chargaff&#x27;s second rule and Szybalski&#x27;s rule can be seen in bacterial genomes where the coding sequences are not equally distributed. The genetic code has 64 codons of which 3 function as termination codons: there are only 20 amino acids normally present in proteins. (There are two uncommon amino acids—selenocysteine and pyrrolysine—found in a limited number of proteins and encoded by the stop codons—TGA and TAG respectively.) The mismatch between the number of codons and amino acids allows several codons to code for a single amino acid—such codons normally differ only at the third codon base position.

Multivariate statistical analysis of codon use within genomes with unequal quantities of coding sequences on the two strands has shown that codon use in the third position depends on the strand on which the gene is located. This seems likely to be the result of Szybalski&#x27;s and Chargaff&#x27;s rules. Because of the asymmetry in pyrimidine and purine use in coding sequences, the strand with the greater coding content will tend to have the greater number of purine bases (Szybalski&#x27;s rule). Because the number of purine bases will, to a very good approximation, equal the number of their complementary pyrimidines within the same strand and, because the coding sequences occupy 80–90% of the strand, there appears to be (1) a selective pressure on the third base to minimize the number of purine bases in the strand with the greater coding content; and (2) that this pressure is proportional to the mismatch in the length of the coding sequences between the two strands.

The origin of the deviation from Chargaff&#x27;s rule in the organelles has been suggested to be a consequence of the mechanism of replication. During replication the DNA strands separate. In single stranded DNA, cytosine spontaneously slowly deaminates to adenosine (a C to A transversion). The longer the strands are separated the greater the quantity of deamination. For reasons that are not yet clear the strands tend to exist longer in single form in mitochondria than in chromosomal DNA. This process tends to yield one strand that is enriched in guanine (G) and thymine (T) with its complement enriched in cytosine (C) and adenosine (A), and this process may have given rise to the deviations found in the mitochondria. 

Chargaff&#x27;s second rule appears to be the consequence of a more complex parity rule: within a single strand of DNA any oligonucleotide (k-mer or n-gram; length ≤ 10) is present in equal numbers to its reverse complementary nucleotide. Because of the computational requirements this has not been verified in all genomes for all oligonucleotides. It has been verified for triplet oligonucleotides for a large data set. Albrecht-Buehler has suggested that this rule is the consequence of genomes evolving by a process of inversion and transposition. This process does not appear to have acted on the mitochondrial genomes. Chargaff&#x27;s second parity rule appears to be extended from the nucleotide-level to populations of codon triplets, in the case of whole single-stranded Human genome DNA.
A kind of &quot;codon-level second Chargaff&#x27;s parity rule&quot; is proposed as follows:
|+ Intra-strand relation among percentages of codon populations
! scope=col | First codon !! scope=col | Second codon !! scope=col | Relation proposed !! scope=col | Details
| codice_2 (1st base position is T) || codice_3 (3rd base position is A) || % codice_2 formula_1 % codice_3 || codice_2 and codice_3 are mirror codons, e.g. codice_8 and codice_9
| codice_10 (1st base position is C) || codice_11 (3rd base position is G) || % codice_10 formula_1 % codice_11 || codice_10 and codice_11 are mirror codons, e.g. codice_16 and codice_17
| codice_18 (2nd base position is T) || codice_19 (2nd base position is A) || % codice_18 formula_1 % codice_19 || codice_18 and codice_19 are mirror codons, e.g. codice_24 and codice_25
| codice_26 (2nd base position is C) || codice_27 (2nd base position is G) || % codice_26 formula_1 % codice_27 || codice_26 and codice_27 are mirror codons, e.g. codice_32 and codice_33
| codice_34 (3rd base position is T) || codice_35 (1st base position is A) || % codice_34 formula_1 % codice_35 || codice_34 and codice_35 are mirror codons, e.g. codice_40 and codice_41
| codice_42 (3rd base position is C) || codice_43 (1st base position is G) || % codice_42 formula_1 % codice_43 || codice_42 and codice_43 are mirror codons, e.g. codice_48 and codice_49
|}

Examples — computing whole human genome using the first codons reading frame provides:
 36530115 TTT and 36381293 AAA (ratio % = 1.00409). 2087242 TCG and 2085226 CGA (ratio % = 1.00096), etc...

In 2020, it is suggested that the physical properties of the dsDNA (double stranded DNA) and the tendency to maximum entropy of all the physical systems are the cause of Chargaff&#x27;s second parity rule. The symmetries and patterns present in the dsDNA sequences can emerge from the physical peculiarities of the dsDNA molecule and the maximum entropy principle alone, rather than from biological or environmental evolutionary pressure.

<text>Olympic Airlines (, &quot;Olympiakés Aerogrammés&quot; – OA), formerly named Olympic Airways, was the flag carrier airline of Greece. The airline&#x27;s head office was located in Athens. The airline operated services to 37 domestic destinations and to 32 destinations worldwide. The airline&#x27;s main base was at Athens International Airport, &quot;Eleftherios Venizelos&quot;, with hubs at Thessaloniki International Airport, &quot;Macedonia&quot;, Heraklion International Airport, &quot;Nikos Kazantzakis&quot; and Rhodes International Airport, &quot;Diagoras&quot;. Olympic Airlines also owned a base at London Heathrow Airport. By December 2007, the airline employed about 8,500 staff.

Olympic Airlines was also accredited by IATA with the IOSA (IATA Operational Safety Audit) for their safety practices.

On 6 March 2009, the Greek State announced it had reached an agreement to sell the flight operations, ground handling operations and technical base of the group to Marfin Investment Group, the largest Greek investment fund, thus ending 35 years of state ownership.

On 29 September 2009, Olympic Airlines ceased all operations and most flights. Olympic Air, the new airline formed from privatization, commenced flights. Olympic Airlines continued to operate some public service flights to Greek islands as well as some flights to destinations outside the European Union (Cairo, Alexandria, Tel Aviv, Beirut, Belgrade) until the Greek State conducted a public tender and redistributed the routes.

On 31 December 2009, Olympic Airlines ceased all operations, as flights to Greek islands had already been allocated and were being flown by other carriers, and flights to destinations outside the European Union had been allocated to other carriers who started operating them from 1 January 2010. Until the final closure, Olympic Airlines used the temporary code OP for their flights (instead of OA, which is used by their successor, Olympic Air). All Olympic Airlines flights (using the OP code) since 29 September 2009 and until the final deadline of 31 December 2009, were operated by Olympic Air on a wet lease basis. 

The 31 December 2009 deadline as the final possible date that Olympic Airlines should cease operations, was agreed between the Greek Government and the European Commission as part of the deal to close Olympic Airlines and sell the name and assets to Olympic Air. It was initially expected that operations would end much earlier, but due to the change of government in October 2009, the public tenders for the reallocation of subsidized flights to the Greek islands and international flight rights outside the European Union were postponed. The company stayed alive until the final deadline of 31 December 2009.

==History==
Icarus, the first predecessor airline to Olympic, was established in 1930. After just a few months Icarus went bankrupt due to financial problems and limited Greek interest in air transport. Ε.Ε.Ε.Σ. (Ελληνική Εταιρεία Εναέριων Συγκοινωνιών, Greek Company for Air Transport) took its place. At the same time, in 1935, a second airline was created, the privately owned T.A.E. (Τεχνικαί Αεροπορικαί Εκμεταλλεύσεις, Technical and Aeronautical Exploitations). Soon after World War II, in 1947, three airlines were based in Greece: T.A.E., ΕΛΛ.Α.Σ. (Ελληνικαί Αεροπορικαί Συγκοινωνίαι, Greek Air Transport) and Α.Μ.Ε. (Αεροπορικαί Μεταφοραί Ελλάδος, Hellenic Air Transport).

===Onassis era===

In 1951 the poor financial state of the three airlines led to a decision by the Greek state to merge them into a single operator, TAE Greek National Airlines (TAE). The new airline operated a fleet of twin-engine Douglas DC-3 airliners on domestic Greek routes until the last example was disposed of in May 1970. A four-engine Douglas DC-4 was acquired in 1950 and this was operated on a route to London. The new airline faced financial problems so the government closed it down in 1955.

There were no buyers for the airline so the Greek State bought the company back. In July 1956 the Greek State reached an agreement with the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis for Onassis to purchase the airline. The company flew under the T.A.E. name until the end of the year and for the first few months of 1957. On 6 April 1957, the company was renamed Olympic Airways (Ολυμπιακή Αεροπορία/Olympiaki Aeroporia).


The new company developed rapidly. To allay the distrust of air transport by Greeks, Onassis developed the &quot;aviation days of ’57&quot; scheme, providing short, free flights in a DC-3 to demonstrate the reliability of air travel. Onassis always wanted to be in the cutting edge of the technology, so in 1959 he signed a deal to buy four de Havilland Comet 4B that in 1960 was Olympic&#x27;s first jet aircraft, that entered service. Olympic and British European Airways created the first codeshare flights; later the companies expanded their cooperation. When Greek crews had to spend a night in London, British crews would fly the Olympic Comets to BEA destinations, and the same with Greek crews and BEA Comets. On all BEA and OA Comets, there would be a &quot;BEA-OLYMPIC&quot; sign. In 1962 Olympic set a record for flying a DH Comet 4B from London to Athens in just two hours and 51 minutes.

In 1965 Olympic ordered Boeing 707-320 jets; they received the first, bearing the name &quot;City of Athens&quot;, in 1966. Olympic&#x27;s first Boeing 707 service was also the inauguration of a non-stop route connecting Athens and New York City (JFK). In 1968 Olympic began serving Africa, with a twice-weekly round-trip linking Athens with Nairobi and Johannesburg. The same year OA received the first of a fleet of Boeing 727-200 jet aircraft. A new Athens-Montreal-Chicago service commenced in 1969. Also in 1969, the airline phased out their Comet 4Bs.

Under Onassis&#x27; leadership, the airline gained a reputation for lavish style. The cabin crews were attired in Pierre Cardin-designed uniforms and passengers ate with golden cutlery and listened to the stylings of a pianist in the first-class cabin.

In 1971 OA purchased new NAMC YS-11 twin-turboprop aircraft to replace the ageing non-pressurized Douglas DC-3 and the Douglas DC-6 pressurized piston-engined airliners still in use on the company&#x27;s Greek domestic network. In that year they created a subsidiary airline, Olympic Aviation/Ολυμπιακή Αεροπλοΐα, to serve the Greek islands more economically and efficiently. To further this strategy, several examples of the small twin-engined turbo-propeller Short Skyvan utility airliner were obtained for operation on routes serving smaller Greek airports. In 1972 Olympic turned to the important Greece-Australia market, beginning Boeing 707-320 operations between Athens and Melbourne twice a week via Bangkok and Singapore.

Olympic then acquired seven Boeing 720-051B aircraft, a medium-range derivative of the Boeing 707, from Northwest Airlines. The airline also entered the wide-body era by purchasing two new Boeing 747-200s. OA even showed interest in the BAC-Aérospatiale Concorde supersonic airliner and, on 5 January 1973, a Concorde landed at Athens&#x27; Hellenikon Airport to give a demonstration.

===Post-Onassis era===


On 23 January 1973, Aristotle Onassis&#x27; son, Alexander, died in a plane crash; the event came as a shock to the Greek people and a new phase began for Olympic Airways. A few months later, Onassis sold all of the OA shares to the Greek state and he died shortly afterwards (in 1975). In 1976, under state management, OA purchased eleven Boeing 737-200 jet aircraft and created Olympic Catering, which served both OA and foreign airlines. In 1977, in a cost-cutting effort, OA shut down their Australia route, followed by the Canadian one in 1978, when OA also placed orders for four Airbus A300s, plus four options.

In 1984, three more B747-200 aircraft were purchased from Singapore Airlines, and the Canadian and Australian routes were reopened. A new Olympic Airways Cargo division was created by converting the Boeing 707-320 &quot;City of Lindos&quot;, but the plans were soon abandoned. In 1986, there were strikes at OA, and financial losses mounted.

The company faced serious financial trouble from the 1980s on, mostly because of management problems. Greek politicians and their families travelled for free or token amounts on the airline. Successive Greek governments also made Olympic carry the press at a 97 percent discount. Olympic AirTours (Ολυμπιακή Τουριστική) was created as a subsidiary of OA, which issued tickets not only for OA, but for other airlines as well. Very soon, Olympic AirTours was renamed Macedonian Airlines and reestablished as a charter flight company.

In 1990 a route to Tokyo via Bangkok was launched but Olympic was soon forced to shut it down, despite very high load factors (95%). Olympic purchased seven Boeing 737-400 aircraft in 1991, as well as the advanced version of the A300, the A300-600R. Due to the rising losses and debts, the government decided to formulate a restructuring program in which all debts were erased. This programme, as well as all the plans that followed, failed. A few years later, in an attempt to make OA profitable, management was given to British Airways (Speedwing International Ltd). The result was even larger debts and rising losses. In 1999, Olympic purchased four Airbus A340-313X aircraft, to replace the ageing B747-200.

===Olympic Airways to Olympic Airlines===
By December 2003, the Olympic Airways Group of Companies owned Olympic Airways (Ολυμπιακή Αεροπορία), Olympic Aviation (Ολυμπιακή Αεροπλοϊα), Macedonian Airlines (Mακεδονικές Αερογραμμές), Galileo Hellas (Γαλιλλαίος Ελλάς), Olympic Fuel Company (Ολυμπιακή Εταιρεία Καυσίμων), and Olympic Into-Plane Company. Olympic Catering had been sold a few months earlier. A company formed in the ’80s called Olympic AirTours (Ολυμπιακή Τουριστική) had already been transformed into Macedonian Airlines.

Very soon the losses became excessive, so in 2003, the government restructured the Olympic Airways Group of Companies. The subsidiary, Macedonian Airlines S.A., was renamed Olympic Airlines S.A. and took over the flight operations of Olympic Airways, erasing at the same time all of the airline&#x27;s debts. The remaining group companies, except for Olympic Aviation (Olympic Airways, Olympic Into-Plane Company, Olympic Fuel Company, Olympic Airways Handling and the Olympic Airways Technical Base), merged and formed a new company, called Olympic Airways – Services S.A.. In December 2004, the Greek government decided to privatize Olympic Airlines, but the sale process failed as none of the buyers was eager to repay the Greek state almost 700 million euros in state aid, which was later declared illegal by the European Commission in December 2005.

In 2005, the Greek Government looked for potential buyers to privatize OA. In April of that year, a short list of potential buyers was submitted that included Aegean Airlines, German LCC DBA and a Greek-American consortium called Olympic Investors. Shortly afterwards Aegean Airlines pulled out, followed by DBA. In September 2005, the Greek government signed a non-binding agreement with Olympic Investors to buy the airline. In an interview, Olympic Investors stated that they were backed by York Capital with 6.5 billion dollars and assured that OA&#x27;s workers would not lose their jobs. They stated that OA should continue to operate as an integrated company and that they were not interested in buying just parts of OA. By the end of the year, the offer fell through because the huge fine imposed on the airline by the European Commission had not been dealt with.

According to Greek media, the government planned to relaunch the company in late 2006. The code name for the project was Pantheon Airways. In June 2006, Greek media reported that Sabre Aviation Consulting Services was contracted by the Greek government to find investors and develop a business plan for an airline to replace Olympic Airlines, aiming to begin operations in autumn 2006. Under this plan, the government would be a minority shareholder of the new carrier, which would be run as a private airline. The planned re-launch date passed without anything happening, and the plan was temporarily frozen.

In 2006 O.A. was thrown a lifeline when the courts ordered Greece to repay them almost 564 million euros owed to the airline. The money was owed to O.A. from legally subsidized routes to Greek islands and the costs of the relocation to the new airport. The money would be used to pay back part of the state aid declared illegal by the European Commission in December 2005. Olympic Airlines redesigned their website to introduce their e-ticket service, launched on 31 July 2007, in response to the surge of online booking and online check-ins. The e-ticket service introduction by Electronic Data Systems meant Olympic abolished their old &quot;Hermes&quot; booking system, which had served the company for more than two decades. As of November 2007, the e-ticket service was available on all European and International routes, and on 19 of the airline&#x27;s 37 domestic routes.

On 12 September 2007, the Luxembourg-based EU court ruled that Olympic should repay an amount of money less than what the EU Commission had ordered. This amount included unpaid taxes on fuel and spare parts, as well as unpaid fees to Athens International Airport. The new amount owed by Olympic was €130 million, as compared with the original €160 million. On that same day, Olympic Investors, the Greek-American consortium that was interested in buying Olympic in 2005, stated renewed interest in buying the airline.

In November 2007, Irish airline Ryanair filed a suit with the European Commission, saying that they had not looked into their claims that Olympic had not paid back their debt. On 1 December 2007 transport minister Kostas Hatzidakis announced that the entire Olympic Airways Group debts amounted to two billion euros and that the airline in its then form and size would cease existing in 2008. This was deemed to be the only way for the European Commission to write off the company&#x27;s debts to the Greek public sector. He stated that Athens was under more pressure to recover the money Olympic owed because of the Ryanair lawsuit.

Despite all predictions, traffic for Olympic in 2007 increased to a total of 5,977,104 passengers (3,115,521 on domestic and 2,681,583 on international flights) compared to approximately 5,500,000 passengers in 2006. It is estimated that OA earned approximately 780 million euros in 2007, 500 of which came from international flights. However, in 2008 due to lack of aircraft Olympic Airlines cancelled or merged a significant number of flights, about 6,000 according to their union (as of 26 August 2008). Olympic Airlines officials have declared that this is not the major problem since &quot;after all the income reduction is only 4–5 million euros compared to the initial budget plan&quot;.

===Olympic Airlines to Olympic Air===
On 6 March 2009, Development Minister Kostis Hatzidakis announced the sale of the flight operations and the technical base companies to Marfin Investment Group (MIG). As a result, after 35 years of state control and 10 years of failed sales attempts, Olympic once again became a private corporation. The new owners were to secure approximately 5000 of the 8500 jobs of the Group.

On 28 September 2009, Olympic Airlines ceased to fly to most of their 69 destinations, maintaining flights to Tel Aviv, Beirut, Cairo and all public service obligation routes within Greece, until the Ministry for Transport and Communications redistributed the routes in late November, when Olympic Airlines entered liquidation. Existing passengers were accommodated on other airlines. Employees of the old company who were in destinations no longer served may have been affected.

The last Olympic Airlines flight was flight 424 from Toronto via Montreal, landing at 11:10 on 29 September 2009 at the Athens International Airport. Olympic Air took over the rest of the operations on 29 September 2009 and their first flight was on 1 October 2009 at 06:20 leaving the Athens International Airport and heading to Thessaloniki Makedonia Airport.

==Destinations==
Before their demise in 2009, Olympic Airlines flew to 37 domestic and 32 international destinations throughout 23 countries.

==Fleet==
===Final fleet===
Olympic Airlines operated the following fleet at the time of closure:

===Former fleet===
Olympic Airlines has previously operated the following aircraft:
(note Boeing aircraft with customer code &#x27;84&#x27; were purchased as new)



==Codeshare agreements==
Olympic Airlines had the following codeshare agreements:

* Cyprus Airways connected Athens and Thessaloniki with Larnaca and Athens with Paphos (operated by Cyprus and Olympic)
* Air Malta connected Athens with Malta (operated by Air Malta)
* Czech Airlines connected Athens and Thessaloniki with Prague (operated by Czech CSA)
* Egypt Air connected Athens with Alexandria (operated by Olympic)
* Kuwait Airways connected Athens with Kuwait (operated by Olympic)

==Corporate design==

===Logo===
The first logo of the airline was a white eagle, bearing a resemblance to a propeller, featuring five rings and the name &quot;Olympic&quot;. Just two years after the first flight, Onassis asked his associates to design a new logo and the coloured rings were created. Onassis wanted to copy the five coloured rings of the Olympic emblem, but the International Olympic Committee claimed the rights to the emblem, so a new, six-ring logo was introduced. The first five rings stand for the five continents, while the sixth stands for Greece. Colours used were yellow, red, blue and white.

The new logo for Olympic air was selected from among three proposals by an online vote which was open until 5 July 2009 on oalogo.gr. All proposals were expected to keep the six circles and to modernize the existing logo. The logo that was finally selected is a bevel version of the existing logo and font, with the exception that green has replaced the light blue on some circles. Green along with blue is one of MIG&#x27;s corporate colours (as seen on Marfin Egnatia bank&#x27;s logo for example) and was thus also used per the request of MIG on the new uniforms too.

===Other===
* The Olympic name came about as a result of Onassis&#x27; passion for ancient Greece. Many of his companies carried the Olympic name such as Olympic Maritime. He followed the same naming pattern for his ships (with names such as &quot;Olympic Legacy&quot;, &quot;Olympic Palm&quot;, &quot;Olympic Explorer&quot;, etc.)
* According to OA regulations, all male flight attendants must wear a black tie, thus paying tribute to the late Alexander Onassis.
* Uniforms for OA flight attendants were created by famous fashion designers. The first uniform was designed by Jean Dessès in 1957, followed by uniforms designed by Coco Chanel (1966), Pierre Cardin (1969), Yiannis Tseklenis (1971), Roula Stathi (1976), Billy Bo (1981), Aspasia Gerel (1987), Makis Tselios (1992) and Artisti Italiani (1998).

==Olympic in popular culture==
* In the film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, James Bond calls Miss Moneypenny to book a ticket with Olympic to Madrid.
* In the film &quot;Octopussy&quot;, James Bond stands in front of the &#x27;Olympic Airways Building&#x27; while watching Kamal Khan leave Sotheby&#x27;s auction house.
* A sunglass collection by Paul Frank Sunich is called &quot;Olympic Airways&quot;.
* &quot;Olympic Airways&quot; is the fourth and last single from the album &quot;Antidotes&quot; by Foals.

==Incidents and accidents==

* 29 October 1959: a Douglas DC-3 crashed in the locality of Klitys, on Mount Parnitha, near Athens, Greece. All 15 passengers and all three crew members perished. It was reported that one of the wings was detached from the plane.
* 16 August 1969: a Douglas DC-3 was hijacked on a domestic flight from Ellinikon International Airport, Athens to Agrinion Airport. The four hijackers demanded to be taken to Albania. The aircraft, possibly registered SX-BBF, landed at Valona.
* 8 December 1969: Olympic Airways Flight 954 crashed near Keratea, 21 miles southeast of Athens, Greece. All 85 passengers and all five crew members were killed.

<text>The Companies Registration Office (CRO; ) registers and incorporates companies in Ireland and files their annual returns.

The CRO has a number of core functions:

*The incorporation of companies.
*The receipt and registration of post incorporation documents.
*The enforcement of the Companies Acts in relation to the filing obligations of companies.
*Making information on companies available to the public.

It also registers the names of businesses which are non-limited trading entities such as sole traders and partnerships.

It also has the &quot;Office of the Registry of Friendly Societies&quot; which registers Industrial &amp; Provident Societies, Friendly Societies and trade unions.

In 2019, the Register of Beneficial Ownership was introduced into Ireland. That was implemented on the back of the EU’s Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which essentially requires all member states to hold adequate, accurate and current information of all beneficial owners. A beneficial owner is someone who owns more than 25% of a company.

<text>The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) is a public academic health science center in Galveston, Texas, United States. It is part of the University of Texas System. UTMB includes the oldest medical school in Texas, and has about 11,000 employees. As of April 2024, it had an endowment of $763 million.

Established in 1891 as the University of Texas Medical Department, UTMB has grown from one building, 23 students and 13 faculty members to more than 70 buildings, more than 2,500 students and more than 1,000 faculty. It has five schools (Medicine, Nursing, Health Professions, Public and Population Health, and Graduate Biomedical Sciences), three institutes for advanced study, a comprehensive medical library, four on-site hospitals (including an affiliated Shriners Hospital for Children), a network of clinics that provide primary and specialized medical care and numerous research facilities.

UTMB&#x27;s primary missions are health sciences education, medical research (it is home to the Galveston National Laboratory) and health care services. Its emergency department at John Sealy Hospital is certified as a Level I Trauma Center and serves as the lead trauma facility for a nine-county region in Southeast Texas; it is one of only three Level I Trauma centers serving all ages in Southeast Texas.

==History==

The location of the Medical Department of the University of Texas was decided between Galveston and Houston in a popular vote in 1881, but its opening was delayed due to the construction of the main university campus in Austin, Texas. The need for medical training in Texas was great: in 1891, 80 percent of doctors in the state had under a year of formal training in medicine, and so the &quot;Texas Medical College&quot; was formed in Galveston with the idea that it would become the medical department once state funding began.

The original building, the Ashbel Smith Building also called Old Red, was begun in 1890 under the supervision of the Galveston architect Nicholas J. Clayton. Clayton toured several medical colleges in the North and East before drawing up his plans for the building. The medical school campus also included the John Sealy Hospital, which provided charity care for any who claimed Galveston residence.

Upon opening, the Red Building had been starkly underfurnished, a problem which was not fully remedied until after the Hurricane of 1900, when the state rallied around the ravaged city. Dr. Thompson, professor of surgery, said that &quot;the regents were so generous in repairing the damage to the building and restoring the equipment, that we were actually in better shape at the end of the year 1901 than we had been before.&quot; In addition, the damage to the roof of Old Red allowed for the addition of skylights, which had always been wanted for the dissection room. Also in 1901, the school admitted their first woman faculty member, Marie Charlotte Schaefer.

In 1915, the medical branch built the first hospital dedicated to children in Texas. By 1924, UTMB had established the first department of pediatrics in the state of Texas – which was also one of the first departments of pediatrics in the United States.

UTMB&#x27;s annual budget of approximately $1.4 billion includes grants, awards, and contracts from federal and private sources totaling more than $150 million, in addition to institutional allocations for research.

Construction on an emergency department began in 1989, and the Sealy &amp; Smith Foundation spent $28 million to have it built.

In 1996, UTMB purchased the adjacent 128-year-old St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital, the first catholic hospital in Texas. The building was converted into the Rebecca Sealy Psychiatric Hospital.

===Hurricane Ike===
In 2008, Hurricane Ike caused significant flood damage to nearly every building on campus, including the John Sealy Hospital. UTMB restored its educational programs within weeks after the Hurricane Ike and the research endeavor came back later. Most immediately, UTMB has about $1.4 billion to restore, harden and expand its campus. Much of the money was approved by the 81st Texas Legislative session, $450 million comes from FEMA, $130 million from insurance, $200 million from the Sealy and Smith Foundation, and $50 million from the Social Service Block Grant Funds. In 2010, the university was placed on a censure list issued by the American Association of University Professors for laying off 124 professors in the aftermath of the hurricane.

In 2011 the foundation committed $170 million towards the construction of a new Jennie Sealy Hospital on the UTMB campus, an amount that represents the largest single gift ever to a Texas health institution.

=== Modern history ===
In 2003, UTMB received funding to construct a $150 million Galveston National Biocontainment Laboratory on its campus, one of the few non-military facilities of this level. It houses several Biosafety Level 4 research laboratories, where studies on highly infectious materials can be carried out safely. It has schools of medicine, nursing, allied health professions, and a graduate school of biomedical sciences, as well as an institute for medical humanities. UTMB also has a major contract with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to provide medical care to inmates at all TDC sites in the eastern and southern portions of Texas. UTMB also has similar contracts with local governments needing inmate medical care.

In fiscal year 2012, UTMB received 20 percent of its $1.5 billion budget from the State of Texas to help support its teaching mission, hospital operation and Level 1 Trauma Center; UTMB generates the rest of its budget through its research endeavors, clinical services and philanthropy. It provides a significant amount of charity care (almost $96 million in 2012), and treats complex cases such as transplants and burns.

UTMB became a member of the Houston-based Texas Medical Center in 2010.

On March 10, 2022, UTMB announced that the School of Medicine would be renamed to the John Sealy School of Medicine in honor of the over $1 billion donated to the university and medical school by the Sealy family and the Sealy &amp; Smith Foundation over the last century.

<text>David Roger Johansen (sometimes spelled David Jo Hansen, January 9, 1950 – February 28, 2025) was an American singer, songwriter and actor best known as lead singer of the seminal proto-punk band the New York Dolls. He is also known for his work under the pseudonym Buster Poindexter and for playing the Ghost of Christmas Past in &quot; Scrooged&quot; (1988).

==Early life==
Johansen was born in the New York City borough of Staten Island to a librarian mother, Helen, and an insurance sales representative father, who had previously sung opera. His mother was Irish American and his father was Norwegian American.

==Career==

Johansen began his career in the late 1960s as the lead singer of the Vagabond Missionaries, a local Staten Island band and later in the early 1970s as the singer/songwriter in the proto-punk band the New York Dolls. The New York Dolls were in the Mercer&#x27;s scene, appearing on the bill at a New Year&#x27;s Eve 1972 gig with Ruby and the Rednecks. They released two albums, the eponymous &quot;New York Dolls&quot; (1973) and &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot; (1974). The bulk of the material was written by Johansen and guitarist Johnny Thunders. The Dolls were sometimes well received critically but did not succeed commercially.

In 1975, Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan left the band. Johansen and Sylvain Sylvain along with Peter Jordan, Chris Robison and Tony Machine continued playing as the New York Dolls until 1976 after which Johansen embarked on a solo career. His first two solo albums, the eponymous &quot;David Johansen&quot; and &quot;In Style&quot;, featured several enduring originals. His self-titled album peaked at number 91 in Australia in August 1978. Sylvain Sylvain frequently performed with him and his band covered many Dolls songs in concert. His live albums &quot;Live It Up&quot; and &quot;The David Johansen Group Live&quot; document Johansen&#x27;s reputation as an exceptional concert performer. The studio releases &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; (which includes a signature number, &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;) and &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot; again showcased his strengths as a writer of new material and featured a guest appearance by jazz saxophone player Big Jay McNeely. A number of the songs on &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; were co-written with South African musician Blondie Chaplin. In 1982 Johansen was the opening act for The Who at several U.S. East Coast concerts, including Shea Stadium in New York City and Capital Centre near Washington, D.C. 

===Buster Poindexter===
In the late 1980s, Johansen achieved moderate commercial success under the pseudonym Buster Poindexter, accompanied by The Uptown Horns, performing jump blues, traditional pop, swing and novelty songs. He also appeared as part of the house band on the television program &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. As Poindexter, he scored his first hit song, &quot;Hot Hot Hot&quot;, which, in an interview on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, he called &quot;the bane of my life&quot; due to its pervasive popularity. &quot;Hot Hot Hot&quot; was initially written and recorded by Montserratian Soca artist Arrow. As Poindexter, Johansen often appeared with his band, The Banshees of Blue. Early Poindexter releases combined an eclectic selection of covers with Johansen&#x27;s own compositions. Johansen went on to issue &quot;Buster&#x27;s Happy Hour&quot;, an album of songs thematically linked by their subject matter: alcohol. It was followed by &quot;Buster Poindexter&#x27;s Spanish Rocket Ship&quot;, which focused on salsa and merengue music.

===Acting===
Johansen acted in several films during the 1980s and 1990s, and in 2000, had a brief role on the HBO drama series &quot;Oz&quot;. He appeared in the television series &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; in the episode &quot;On Golden Pete&quot;, in which he played a park ranger. He appeared in the Muppet Television segment of an episode of &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;. Among his more prominent roles are that of the wisecracking Ghost of Christmas Past in &quot;Scrooged&quot; (1988), which starred Bill Murray as well as the part of &quot;Looney&quot; in the movie &quot;Let It Ride&quot; (1989), playing opposite Richard Dreyfuss. He starred opposite Hulk Hogan and Sherman Hemsley in &quot;Mr. Nanny&quot; (1993) and co-starred with John C. McGinley in the movie &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; (1994), based on the television series. He can be seen in the Jim White documentary film &quot;Searching for the Wrong Eyed Jesus&quot; in which he sings a version of Geeshie Wiley&#x27;s &quot;Last Kind Words&quot; while in a motel room. He also had a supporting role with Mick Jagger and Emilio Estevez in the movie &quot;Freejack&quot; (1992). He also played Halston (a hired hitman) in the anthology film &quot;Tales from the Darkside: The Movie&quot; (1990), in the segment &quot;The Cat from Hell&quot;. He was also the guest music artist on the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode &quot;The Dutch Oven&quot; (1985) where he sang &quot;King of Babylon&quot;. Johansen most recently portrayed the bartender in the Bill Murray Netflix special &quot;A Very Murray Christmas&quot;. Johansen voiced the villain Ding Dong Daddy in the original &quot;Teen Titans&quot; animated series in the season 5 episode 9 episode &quot;Revved Up&quot;.
Johansen&#x27;s legs appeared in John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;Up Your Legs Forever&quot;. He also voiced the Beartaur character in the 2021 &quot;Centaurworld&quot; animated Netflix television series.

===Later solo career===

Johansen then turned to blues with his group, The Harry Smiths. The group was named as a tribute to Harry Everett Smith, who compiled the &quot;Anthology of American Folk Music&quot;, several songs of which were covered by the band. Johansen&#x27;s second album with the Harry Smiths is titled &quot;Shaker&quot;.

In 2004, Johansen reunited with Sylvain Sylvain and Arthur Kane of the New York Dolls. Owing to the success of the tour, in 2006 the New York Dolls released &quot;One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This&quot;, their first album in nearly 30 years. It was critic Robert Christgau&#x27;s choice for album of the year. In 2009 the band released &quot;Cause I Sez So&quot; and in 2011 &quot;Dancing Backward in High Heels&quot;.

Johansen hosts a weekly show, &quot;David Johansen&#x27;s Mansion of Fun&quot;, on Sirius Satellite Radio while continuing to write and perform. Featuring music &quot;from the jungles of Africa to the Bayou of Louisiana and from Duke Ellington to Phil Spector to Billy Joe Shaver, the show is all over the musical map&quot;, the show is free-form and eclectic. , the show airs on channel 710 (stream-only), The Loft.

In October 2007, Johansen participated in &quot;The Staten Island Composers Project&quot;, featuring work by three musicians who call the island home: Johansen; Vernon Reid, founder of the &#x27;80s rock-metal pioneers Living Colour and Galt MacDermot, best known as the composer of the musical &quot;Hair.&quot; The Council on the Arts and Humanities for Staten Island commissioned the program and asked each artist to write 20 minutes of music conveying something of his connection to the island often referred to as New York City&#x27;s forgotten borough. Johansen&#x27;s opus, a cinematic and unabashedly romantic Adagio scored mostly for strings, is called &quot;Mara Dreams the Moon Gate of Uncommon Beauty&quot;. Inspired by &quot;The Moon Gate of Uncommon Beauty&quot;, a round portal between two rockscapes in the Chinese Scholar&#x27;s Garden at the Staten Island Botanical Garden. In September 2009, he appeared on &quot;Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations&quot;, the Travel Channel television program, in which he toured Staten Island with the program&#x27;s host.

In addition to his own albums, Johansen contributed songs to the soundtracks of the films &quot;Times Square&quot; and &quot;The Aviator&quot; (&quot;Flowers in the City&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Cha Glad&quot; respectively) and guests on &quot;About Them Shoes&quot;, a CD by veteran blues man Hubert Sumlin. Another non-album track of his, &quot;Johnsonius&quot;, appears on the 1984 compilation &quot;A Diamond Hidden in the Mouth of a Corpse&quot; and &quot;The Rope (The Let Go Song)&quot;, a track originally recorded during the sessions for his eponymous first album and published on the B-side of the single, &quot;Funky But Chic&quot;, a song that was performed by the original New York Dolls before their break up.

An artist noted for his musical unpredictability and versatility, Johansen was a consistent blues enthusiast since the earliest days of the Dolls, with covers of songs by Bo Diddley and Sonny Boy Williamson among their earliest numbers. The 2006 Dolls CD &quot;Private World : The Complete Early Studio Demos 1972/3&quot; featured the Dolls performing songs by Otis Redding, Gary U.S. Bonds, Chuck Berry, The Shangri-Las and Muddy Waters, in addition to versions of songs from their two Mercury albums. Also featured on the CD was a previously unreleased Dolls number, &quot;Endless Party&quot;.

Johansen worked consistently with Sylvain Sylvain, drummer Tony Machine – formerly an agent who worked for Leber &amp; Krebs, a member of the New York Dolls in 1975–1976 and a fixture in many David Johansen groups and throughout the Buster Poindexter period – and Brian Koonin, guitarist and banjo player with Buster Poindexter and The Harry Smiths as well as keyboard player with the New York Dolls for the first reunion engagement and the &quot;One Day It Will Please Us To Remember Even This&quot; CD and tour.

In September 2020, Johansen released a cover of &quot;Sinking Ship&quot; by Gypsy.

On July 7, 2020, Showtime Documentary Films announced that filmmaker Martin Scorsese would direct a new feature film on Johansen. The Showtime documentary, &quot;Personality Crisis: One Night Only,&quot; was released on April 14, 2023. Scorsese was joined in the making of the film by his frequent co-director David Tedeschi, and, with Johansen, Scorsese was interviewed about the film by MSNBC host Joe Scarborough.

==Personal life and death==
Johansen wed actress Cyrinda Foxe in 1977 but divorced within a year in 1978. From 1983 to 2011, Johansen was married to photographer Kate Simon. In 2013, Johansen wed artist Mara Hennessey.

In 2020, Johansen was diagnosed with stage four cancer and a brain tumor, which brought an end to his musical career. He fell and broke his back in two places in November 2024 and required surgery. His step-daughter launched a fundraiser to help with his treatment on January 10, 2025. He died from cancer at his Staten Island home on February 28, 2025, at the age of 75.

<doc id="526975" wikidata="Q1948103" url="?curid=526975" title="Animositisomina">
<text>Animositisomina is the eighth studio album by American industrial metal band Ministry, released on February 18, 2003, by Sanctuary Records.

==Background==
The album&#x27;s title is a palindrome made of the word &quot;&quot; spelled without the final letter and both forward and backward. According to an interview on Fuse&#x27;s &quot;Uranium&quot;, Jourgensen was bored at the time he was coming up with an album title. It is Ministry&#x27;s first album to feature lyrics in the album sleeve, which prior albums did not provide.

&quot;The Light Pours Out of Me&quot; was written and originally recorded by Magazine for their &quot;Real Life&quot; album in 1978 and it is the only song in the album to have more than one word in the title. Ministry performed the song several times in concerts in the late 1980s, but it was never released or recorded officially.

&quot;Animositisomina&quot; is the last Ministry album with Paul Barker, thus ending the band&#x27;s &quot;Hypo Luxa/Hermes Pan&quot; production duo. In addition, it is also the last album to feature Ministry performing in their traditional industrial metal style before switching to a more thrash-oriented sound on their next album, &quot;Houses of the Molé&quot;.

In April 2016, Jourgensen called &quot;Animositisomina&quot; his least-favourite Ministry album, declaring it was &quot;not fun to make&quot; as he was finally quitting heroin cold turkey during the recording sessions. Additionally, his relationship with Barker had become antagonistic, which prompted the latter to quit the band after the &quot;Animositisomina&quot; tour. &quot;Leper,&quot; the last song on the album, was left as an instrumental as Jourgensen had left the studio earlier than scheduled and was uninterested in writing lyrics. Jourgensen considers &quot;Animositisomina&quot; a &quot;non-album&quot; and left most of the recording responsibilities to Barker.

<doc id="526979" wikidata="Q486736" url="?curid=526979" title="Marker, Norway">
<text>Marker is a municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Ørje. Marker was created as a new municipality on 1 January 1964 following the merger of the two former municipalities of Rødenes and Øymark.

The municipality borders Sweden, Aurskog-Høland municipality in Akershus county, and Aremark, Eidsberg, Rakkestad, and Rømskog municipalities in Østfold county. European route E18 passes through the municipality.

The municipality&#x27;s biggest attractions are the fortresses at Basmo and Ørje. Basmo Fortress lies on an isolated mountain outcrop between lakes Rødenessjøen and Hemnessjøen in the northwestern part of the municipality.

== General information ==
=== Name ===
The Norse form of the name was &quot;Markir&quot;, which is the plural form of &quot;mǫrk&quot; f &#x27;woodland, borderland&#x27; (see &gt; March).

=== Coat-of-arms ===
Marker&#x27;s coat-of-arms dates from modern times, having been granted on 16 April 1982. The arms show two white-colored trunk-hooks on a blue background. They are a type of hook, normally on a long pole, used to drive tree trunks through the rivers. The main economic activity in the municipality is forestry, hence the use of the hooks. The two hooks also represent the two villages (and former municipalities) of Rødenes and Øymark. 

===Rødenes church===
Rødenes church (&quot;Rødenes kirke&quot;) is a medieval-era church in the Rødenes parish of Marker. It belongs to Østre Borgesyssel deanery in the Church of Norway&#x27;s Borg Diocese. The building, which is of Romanesque architectural style and dates from 1230, has a rectangular nave and a lower and narrower choir. The oaken pulpit dates from the 1600s and the altarpiece from the 1720s. The edifice is of stone and brick. The floorplan is long and has room for 240 seats. The church underwent extensive reconstruction in the years 1703–1709 and again in 1949–1952.

==Minorities==
== Notable people ==
* Thorvald Aadahl (1882 in Rødenes – 1962) a newspaper editor, novelist and playwright 
* Ola Isene (1898 in Rødenes – 1973) a Norwegian baritone opera singer and actor

<text>This is a list of notable events in the history of LGBT rights that took place in the year 1980.

==Events==
*New York (in &quot;People v. Onofre&quot;) and Pennsylvania (in &quot;Commonwealth v. Bonadio&quot;) become the first U.S. states to hold same-sex sodomy laws unconstitutional. No other state&#x27;s highest court will do so again until the Kentucky Supreme Court issues its holding in &quot;Kentucky v. Wasson&quot; in 1992.

===June===
* 3 — Voters in San Jose and Santa Clara County, California, vote to repeal the city and county gay rights ordinances.

===July===
* 5 — The Liberal Party of Canada adopts an official resolution to include sexual orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act.
* 31 — The Toronto Board of Education (since merged into the Toronto District School Board) votes to consider whether to establish a permanent liaison committee with the gay community.

===August===
* Mel Boozer is nominated by petition for the vice presidency of the United States at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. After addressing the convention, Boozer withdraws himself from consideration. Boozer was separately nominated for the office by the Socialist Party USA.

===September===
* 9 — The former municipality of Metropolitan Toronto passes a declaration about being an equal opportunity employer, but refuses to pass a stronger Metro Bill of Rights which explicitly includes sexual orientation.
* 15 — At its first meeting, the subcommittee established by the Toronto Board of Education to explore the possibility of establishing a liaison with the gay community votes to disband.
* 18 — The Toronto Board of Education adopts a policy banning discrimination based on sexual orientation while adding a clause forbidding &quot;proselytizing of homosexuality in the schools&quot;.

<doc id="526985" wikidata="Q1400280" url="?curid=526985" title="Saugeen River">
<text>The Saugeen River is located in southern Ontario, Canada. The river begins in the Osprey Wetland Conservation Lands and flows generally north-west about before exiting into Lake Huron. The river is navigable for some distance, and was once an important barge route. Today the river is best known for its fishing and as a canoe route.

The river&#x27;s name comes from an Ojibwa language word &quot;Zaagiing&quot;, meaning &quot;outlet&quot;. Another source is more specific, indicating that &quot;Saugeen&quot; is the corrupted form of the Ojibwa word meaning the entrance or mouth of the river.

==Course==
From its source in the Osprey Wetland Conservation Lands, the Saugeen River flows westerly before briefly turning to the north and flowing through the village of Wareham. After leaving Wareham, the river turns west again before then flowing southwest and crossing Ontario Highway 10. After crossing the highway the Saugeen meanders to the south-southwest before turning west again and then turning to the north and flowing through the village of Priceville. After reaching Priceville, the Saugeen flows generally westward and parallels the old route of Ontario Highway 4. The Saugeen flows westward into the town of Durham where it falls over McGowan Falls, a cascade waterfall in the Durham Conservation Area. Upon exiting the Durham Conservation Area the river crosses Ontario Highway 6 in downtown Durham. After leaving the town of Durham the Saugeen River turns northwest where it takes in the Rocky Saugeen River. Shortly afterwards the Saugeen makes a sharp turn to the south. Flowing south, the Saugeen takes in the Styx River before taking in Camp Creek north of the village of Allan Park. The Saugeen then turns west again, once again paralleling what was once Highway 4. The Saugeen River then skirts the northern edge of the town of Hanover before entering the Darroch Nature Reserve where it takes in the South Saugeen River. The Saugeen River then continues flowing west until it makes a sharp north turn near the town of Walkerton. The Saugeen then flows north through Walkerton and continues north-northwest. The Saugeen River then enters the town of Paisley where it takes in the Teeswater River in the center of the town and then takes in the North Saugeen River just north of Paisley. The river then continues northwards through the Saugeen Bluffs Conservation Area and then flows north into Denny&#x27;s Dam Conservation Area. The Saugeen then turns west and enters the town of Southampton; it crosses Ontario Highway 21 at the Zgaa-biig-ni-gan Bridge before emptying into Lake Huron.

==Tributaries==
The river has two main tributaries; the South Saugeen and the North Saugeen. The South Saugeen begins near Dundalk while the North Saugeen&#x27;s source is located near Holland Centre. The North Saugeen meets the Saugeen just north of Paisley, about south-southeast of its exit into Lake Huron; the South Saugeen joins the Saugeen about further southeast, near the town of Hanover.

==Canoe route==
The main section suitable for leisure canoeing is the section from Hanover to Southampton. This can be done over a three-day trip, including three short portages around dams, and takes in conditions from placid sections to modest rapids and eddies. Only in early spring does the water become unsafe for an experienced canoeist, and in most summers the water levels remain navigable even in dry periods.

==Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetle==
The North Saugeen River is home to one of the most critically endangered of all insects: the Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetle. In fact, the only known population of Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetles outside of the United States were discovered near Scone in Bruce County, Ontario. In 1986, 42 beetles were identified at a site downstream from a dam there. An unspecified number of beetles were last recorded in 2001, but surveys in 2002 uncovered no specimens. As a result, the status of this population of Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetles is uncertain at present.

Although the Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetle was categorized as endangered on March 7, 1994, under the provisions of the U.S. Endangered Species Act, it is currently not protected in Canada.

<doc id="526992" wikidata="Q7276530" url="?curid=526992" title="RFA Sea Crusader (A96)">
<text>RFA &quot;Sea Crusader was a fast [[sealift]] ship chartered to Britain&#x27;s [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] between 1996 and 2003 and subsequently in commercial service with Cobelfret on North Sea routes asMV &quot;Celestine. She was described by the RFA as a &quot;Strategic Lift Ro-Ro&quot;.

==Background==
In the mid-1990s the British Ministry of Defence identified a need for sealift ships to support the new Joint Rapid Deployment Force (JRDF, subsequently the Joint Rapid Reaction Force). This requirement would ultimately be met by the construction of six Point-class sealift ships in 2002–3, but the charter of two commercial ships was approved as an interim measure.

==Description==
&quot;Sea Crusader&quot;/&quot;Celestine&quot; is the lead ship of a class of six vehicle carriers of 23,986 GT. She is long and powered by two MAN B&amp;W 7L40/54 diesels of 6,690 shp each. She can carry 654 cars and 157 trailers

==History==
Kawasaki Heavy Industries built MV &quot;Celestine&quot; at Sakaide shipyard, Japan in 1996. In October of that year the RFA took the newly built ship on a two-year charter from Oceanarrow (UK) Ltd as RFA &quot;Sea Crusader&quot;. She would be joined by RFA &quot;Sea Centurion&quot; in October 1998. The original intention was that &quot;Sea Crusader&quot; would be replaced by the charter of a new-build sister ship to &quot;Sea Centurion&quot;, but construction problems with the &quot;Sea Chieftain&quot; led to the charter of the &quot;Sea Crusader&quot; being extended until 1 March 2003.

 she is serving the Purfleet and Immingham routes to Zeebrugge for Cobelfret Ferries under a Belgian flag, homeported in Antwerp.

<doc id="526993" wikidata="Q1093613" url="?curid=526993" title="Citroën CX">
<text>The Citroën CX is a large, front-engined, front-wheel-drive executive car/luxury car manufactured and marketed by Citroën from 1974 to 1991. Production models were either a standard wheelbase or a stretched, more luxurious, four-door fastback saloon, as well as a station wagon (estate), on the longer wheelbase. The CX is known for its hydropneumatic self-leveling suspension system (continued and improved from its DS predecessor), and its (at the time) low 0.36 drag coefficient, normally noted as a vehicle&#x27;s formula_1 in French. Restyled as&quot; &#x27;CX&#x27;,&quot; the model name underscored this.

Voted the 1975 European Car of the Year, the CX has been described by some enthusiasts as the last &quot;real Citroën&quot; before Peugeot took control of the company in 1976. The CX was also the final successful model of the &quot;big Citroën&quot; era, dating back to 1934.

==History==
The CX was launched at the 1974 Paris Motor Show. Citroën was unable to schedule right-hand drive production of the car until well into 1975. The CX was initially a huge success in Europe, with more than 132,000 being produced in 1978. It found customers beyond the loyal DS customer base and used the technology of Citroën&#x27;s advanced grand touring personal luxury car, the SM. Unlike its principal competitors, the CX did not have worldwide distribution—the cost of development and improvements had to be met from a geographically small sales base. According to &quot;Driving &amp; Motoring Month&quot; the CX &quot;provides a startlingly intelligent set of solutions to modern motoring problems&quot;.

===Design===
The CX&#x27;s flowing lines and sharp Kammback rear were designed by auto stylist Robert Opron, resembling its precursor the GS. Citroën had been using a wind tunnel for many years, and the CX was designed to perform well in aerodynamic drag, with a coefficient of drag of 0.36. Indeed, the car&#x27;s name of CX refers to the French term for drag coefficient, or coefficient (&#x27;C&#x27;) along the X-axis (&#x27;x&#x27;, being the longitudinal). A notable feature was the concave rear window, designed to clear rain from the rear window without the need for a rear window wiper.

Mechanically, the car was one of the most advanced of its time, combining Citroën&#x27;s hydro-pneumatic integral self-leveling suspension, speed-sensitive DIRAVI fully-powered steering (first introduced on the Citroën SM), and a uniquely effective interior design that did away with steering column stalks, allowing the driver to reach all controls while both hands remained on the steering wheel. A Citroën design principle was that turning signals should not cancel themselves—this should be a conscious decision of the driver. The CX perpetuated this feature, which is not shared by virtually any other contemporary automobile, limiting the CX&#x27;s potential use as a rental car.

The ability of the CX suspension to soak up large undulations and yet damp out rough surfaces resulted in a consistent ride quality when empty or fully laden. The suspension was attached to sub-frames that were fitted to the body through flexible mountings, to improve the ride quality and reduce road noise. The British &quot;Car&quot; magazine described driving a CX as hovering over road irregularities, much like a ship traversing above the ocean floor. The constant ground clearance component of this suspension was used under license by Rolls-Royce on the Silver Shadow, and the Bentley T series. The Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 was not built under license, but copied the Hydropneumatic suspension principles after the less effective Mercedes-Benz 600 Air suspension installation.

The CX has a transverse engine arrangement, in contrast to the longitudinal mid-engine layout of the Traction Avant and DS. This brings multiple benefits: significant mechanical packaging space savings (the CX is shorter than the DS); dramatically less engine noise in the cabin (Traction Avant and DS engines are partially in the cabins of those cars); and, improved access for maintenance of many under-bonnet items.
The CX saloon was always of a fastback design, with a trunk lid hinged beneath the rear window, like many prior fastbacks from the late 1940s until the CX&#x27;s era – but unlike almost every other 1970s sedan, which either &quot;offered&quot; a hatchback body, like the successful Volkswagen Passat and Saab 900, or exclusively hatchbacked contemporaries as the Rover SD1 and Renault 20/30.

Aftermarket hatchback conversions to the CX were offered by Caruna and Beutler. Citroën&#x27;s own 1970 compact GS, and the small Alfa Romeo Alfasud were also initially released as fastback sedans, but both received hatchbacks in the late 1970s.

===Launch===
At launch in 1974, the CX was rushed to market, with some teething troubles. Some very early models did not have power steering and proved difficult to drive as the CX carries 70% of its weight over the front wheels.

Originally, the CX was developed as a rotary-engined car—with several negative consequences. The CX engine bay is small because rotary engines are compact, but the Comotor three-rotor rotary engine was not economical and the entire rotary project was scrapped the year the CX was introduced. Citroën went bankrupt in 1974, partly due to a series of investments like Comotor that didn&#x27;t result in profitable products. Production versions of the CX were powered by a range of inline four cylinder engines - only the very rare GTi Turbo (1985–89) ever had the engine power to match the capabilities of the chassis.
At launch, the carburetor CX was positioned below the DS 23 Pallas Injection Electronique and the SM Injection Electronique.

There was a choice between three differently powered versions. The &quot;Normale&quot; CX car came with a 1985 cc version of the four cylinder engine from the predecessor model with a claimed maximum output of , which was slightly more than had been available from the engine when fitted in the DS. The &quot;Economique&quot; version of the car (reflecting the continuing impact of the 1973 oil price shock) came with the same engine as the &quot;Normale&quot;, but the 4th gear ratio was changed, along with the final drive ratio, giving rise to a 7 km/h (4 mph) reduction in top speed in return for usefully improved fuel economy. More performance came from the &quot;CX 2200&quot;, fitted with a 2175 cc version of the engine and a twin carburetor, resulting in a claimed maximum output of .

Contemporary reports also indicated that the cost of setting up a new production facility for the CX, on the northern edge of Paris, at Aulnay-sous-Bois, also played a role in undermining the company&#x27;s finances to the point where it was obliged to surrender its independence to the more financially cautious Peugeot company. On 12 July 2012, PSA announced the permanent closure of the Aulnay-sous-Bois plant.

===Development===
The CX was slowly developed and improved, the key elements it needed to compete successfully in its market segment taking years to emerge.

The parent company, PSA Peugeot Citroën, was fielding three cars in the executive car segment, the slow-selling Peugeot 604, the abortive Talbot Tagora and the CX, all competing for PSA&#x27;s scarce financial resources. Developing and exploiting the CX design was not the top priority. The seeds of PSA&#x27;s competitive retreat from this traditionally important segment were sown during this period of diffused efforts.

In 1974, the DS featured a fuel-injected 2.3-litre engine, while the 1974 CX 2000 generated , giving it acceleration from of 12 seconds. The 2200 improved on this, and eventually the 2400 engine (the 2347 cc unit as used in the DS) arrived; originally only in the Prestige. A regular CX 2400 arrived at the 1976 Paris Salon, subsequent to the discontinuation of the CX 2200.

In 1977, the CX GTi received a modern Bosch L-Jetronic injection system, with .

In 1981, factory rustproofing and a fully automatic transmission were added.

In 1984, turbo-powered 2.5 L diesel engine did make the CX Turbo-D 2.5 the fastest diesel sedan in the world, able to reach speeds up to . Diesels account for more than half the market for executive cars in France.

In 1985, the GTi Turbo petrol model, with a top speed of over , gave the CX the powerful engine that finally used the full capabilities of the chassis.

The CX eventually acquired a reputation for high running costs, which over time cut sales. The components standard to any automobile (steel, door hinges, starter motors, electrical connections, etc) proved troublesome in service, not the advanced components. The quality of construction improved too slowly to eliminate this perception.

Although the minor 1985 &quot;Series 2&quot; changes did create initial interest from press and public alike, they did little to revive sales, with 35,000 units being produced in 1986 and 1987.

While the DS achieved its greatest sales success at age 15 (1970) the CX design was subject to more intense competitive pressures, peaking at age 4 (1978). Other automakers succeeded in using the CX design as a template for improvement. In particular, the Audi 100 introduced an aerodynamically restyled variant in 1983.

1,170,645 CXs were sold from 1974 to 1991.

==Racing==
Despite the challenging finances of Citroën at the time of launch, the CX was entered in numerous rally driving events, like &quot;Tour du Senegal&quot; and &quot;Paris-Dakar,&quot; winning five events outright.

One notable achievement was in the 1977 London–Sydney Marathon road race, where driver Paddy Hopkirk, driving a CX 2400 sponsored by Citroën&#x27;s Australian concessionaire, staged a come-from-behind sprint to obtain third place.

The CX competed and finished the 2022 Dakar Rally and 2023 Dakar Rally.

==Replacements==
Successful competitors in this market segment have adopted a cycle of redesign and substantial improvement every seven years. Despite the success of the CX design (and the company&#x27;s unbroken legacy of dominance in this segment stretching back to 1934) there was no new and improved &quot;big Citroën&quot; model on the horizon by 1981. CX sales began to slide and, apart from a slight revival after the 1985 facelift, never recovered.

Citroën tried to operate independently and design a CX replacement that updated the flowing CX design (in 1980 and again in 1986). Each time, the parent company PSA Peugeot Citroën killed the project and fired the Citroën designers responsible.

Citroën did incur the expense of designing an entirely new petrol four-cylinder engine in 1984 for the top-of-the-range cars, but the market demanded either inline-six or V6 engines.

The CX saloon was finally replaced by the XM in May 1989. This vehicle was based on the same chassis as the Peugeot 605. It was styled in a distinctive, angular fashion, and fitted with self-levelling hydropneumatic suspension, and featured new electronic controls and branded Hydractive suspension. It also featured a hatchback and a conventional interior rather than the &quot;spaceship&quot; instrument panel of the CX. The XM was clearly related to the BX in layout and construction, but incorporated little design and technology from the CX. The estate remained in production until July 1991, when an estate version of the XM was finally launched.

The XM at first achieved annual sales similar to the modest totals of the CX in the last decade of its life, before a total collapse in demand set in during the mid 1990s. It was retired without an immediate replacement in 2000. Total sales were 333,000 units, less than a third of CX sales, but twice those of the earlier Peugeot 604.

The 2006 Citroën C6, first announced as the C6 Lignage concept car in 1999, appeared to be the direct descendant of the CX. The design of the Citroën flagship was directly inspired by the personality of the CX. It remained in production until the end of 2012 but barely 20,000 examples were sold; the lack of an estate version also hampered sales.

In 2016, Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën introduced a new large sedan - the &quot;Citroën C6&quot; (no relation to earlier models) - a car based on the &quot;Dongfeng A9.&quot; The CX, which had briefly been sold in China, was referenced in the promotional materials.

==Design variations==
CX was available from the factory in three body styles, with 13 different inline-four engines.
===Saloon===
The original CX design was a four-door fastback saloon, with a shorter wheelbase. It was sold in a variety of trim and engine options, the highest designated &quot;Pallas.&quot; The factory never offered a conventional, three-box notchback, nor a hatchback.

===Estate/Wagon/Break===
The Estate (&quot;Safari&quot; in the United Kingdom; &quot;Break&quot; in France), produced from 1975 until 1991, was a longer car. The same body style was also offered as the &quot;Familiale&quot; with three rows of seats, seating seven people. These models had increased load capacity (baggage; equipment; passengers), taking full advantage of the CX&#x27;s self-levelling suspension.

The Estate was the last CX to be replaced. It was one of the largest, and because of its suspension, most practical, family cars available in Europe. The Safari was a success with speedway riders and other motorcycle racers, as the capacious design meant a bike could easily fit in the back.

===Prestige===
The CX saloon had insufficient rear legroom to function as a chauffeur driven limousine (a common use for the spacious DS model), so in 1976, Citroën introduced another longer version, the Prestige variant. The Prestige offered more rear legroom than any other standard-sized sedan in the world. In 1977, it also gained a raised roofline to improve headroom. Prestiges often came equipped with a vinyl roof. Contemporary reviews of the Prestige were favourable. In 1976 the UK&#x27;s &quot;Driver and Motorist&quot; praised its comfort and interior fitments. In 1980, a diesel engine variant was introduced, the &quot;Limousine.&quot;

===Series 1 and Series 2===
The &quot;Series 1&quot; vehicles (1974–85) were characterised by stainless steel front and rear bumpers, hydropneumatic suspension as compliant and soft as the DS, a &quot;spaceship&quot; style dashboard featuring a revolving drum speedometer and similar tachometer.

The &quot;Series 2&quot; vehicles (1985–91) can be distinguished by the use of plastic bumpers. The cars lost some of their earlier distinctiveness, but maintained the &quot;stalk-free&quot; layout, where turn signals, wiper controls, horn and headlights could be operated by the driver&#x27;s fingertips while his/her hands remained on the steering wheel. The suspension became stiffer in most models, with arguably a more aggressive look, as opposed to the more elegant Series 1 design. Although the dashboard retained the &quot;pod&quot; housing for the instrumentation, it lost the revolving-drum instruments and received a sloping centre dash area, and the radio moved to a position sideways and between the front seats, with the height corrector and heating controls moving to the centre console.

===Custom models===

The CX was frequently used as an ambulance and camera car, applications where the cosseting suspension was especially valuable.

A number of CX estates were elongated and retrofitted with a second rear axle, mostly used for high speed bulk transport such as carrying newspapers across Europe. They are known as the &quot;loadrunner&quot; variant. Most of them were prepared by the French company &quot;Tissier.&quot;

In 1984, &quot;Guy Deslandes Design&quot; constructed four &quot;CX Orphée&quot; two-door convertibles.

The Swedish coachbuilder &quot;Nilsson&quot; produced 15 stretched limousines based on the &quot;Prestige&quot; from 1978 to 1989 for use as the official state car of the leader of the German Democratic Republic, Erich Honecker. Three 1985 models were converted during 1989 ahead of a planned state visit by President of France François Mitterrand, however only two of these arrived in East Berlin prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification, with the third example remaining undelivered at a Berlin Citroën dealership and the two that were delivered sold by the East German government through the Treuhandanstalt.

===Transmissions===
Manual, semi-automatic (&quot;C-Matic&quot;) and, ultimately, fully automatic transmissions were fitted, the fully automatic ZF 3HP22 transmission replacing the C-Matic in 1980. Luxury trim-level models were badged as Pallas, and sports variants as GTi. The long-wheelbase models were badged as Prestige (petrol engine) or Limousine (diesel). The factory never produced the CX with both the powerful turbocharged petrol engine and automatic transmission in one car.

===Engine types===
Both petrol and diesel-powered models were available in various engine sizes including turbocharged versions. The top-end sports model, alongside the CX Prestige luxury model, was the CX 25 GTi Turbo, launched in autumn 1984, rated at and a top speed of .

==International sales and production==
The CX was popular in most European nations, and also sold in some Asian and Latin American countries.

In 1984, Citroën sold 2,500 CXs to China and nearly succeeded in getting the &quot;large car&quot; contract that would have made the CX the most common vehicle in the People&#x27;s Republic, which only had 20,000 private vehicles at the time. The Chinese government decided to award this contract to the Shanghai Volkswagen joint venture, and instead gave Citroën the rights to the &quot;compact car&quot; segment. This joint venture, located in Wuhan, is today known as the Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroën Automobile factory, producing over 700,000 cars a year. Ironically, Dongfeng Motor rescued the ailing PSA Peugeot Citroën in 2014, with a cash injection in exchange for an interest in the control of PSA.

The CX was assembled in South America from 1978–1984 starting with the CX 2000 Super in Citroën&#x27;s facility of Arica, Chile. The car achieved good sales numbers despite being one of the most complex cars built in the Americas.

In Australia and South Africa, the CX was imported, unlike the DS, which was assembled locally.

==CX in North America==
PSA Peugeot Citroën had initially engineered the CX models to meet then current US regulations. One specific circumstance led to Citroën’s permanent withdrawal from the US market at the end of 1973, the January 1, 1974 US regulation wording related to bumpers being drafted in such a way that height adjustable suspension was de facto illegal for passenger vehicles. The 1974 Citroëns actually built for the U.S. market could not be supplied to Americans due to the effective date of the bumper regulation.

More specifically, the newly updated US regulations (FMVSS No. 215) mandated bumpers at both ends of passenger vehicles, with the bumper height to be standardized and maintained at a constant height for the 1974 model years - with no distinction for operating ride height, as there was in later EU legislation, since Citroëns are common automobiles in Europe. The height-adjustable suspension was integral to the CX design. Even the Mercedes-Benz Congressional lobby had no impact on this mandate, and they had to disable the height adjustment feature for the US-bound W116 S-Class saloons and S123 estates. In 1981, the standardised bumper height and bumper requirements failed Cost–benefit analysis and were rescinded.

In addition, the situation for Citroën in the North American market was worsened by Citroën’s corporate financial situation and the cost of U.S. and Canadian design legislation.
People with Diplomatic immunity are not subject to lawsuit or prosecution under the host country&#x27;s laws, so diplomats in the U.S. still had access to the CX. So did foreign tourists under the personal use exemption, bringing in the CX for temporary use.

From 1979 on, Americans obtained the CX through grey import specialists, including the firm &quot;Trend Imports,&quot; who modified them to comply with US regulations.

Beginning in 1983, &quot;CxAuto&quot; (CXA), based in Lebanon, New Jersey, remanufactured the CX in the Netherlands before exporting them to the United States with full US compliance. The cars were crash tested as required by NHTSA. The bumpers were fitted with shock absorbing elements, the passenger doors were fitted with side impact bars, the form-fitting headlamps were replaced with four round capsule headlamps and fog lamps, the exhaust system was fitted with oxygen sensor and catalyst, and so forth. They offered a 5-year/ warranty and sold the CX cars in 49 states except California (due to stricter emission regulations). CxAuto removed the Citroën and CX badges and double chevron logos and marketed them as the CXA.

The CXA retail price was $39,900 for CX 25 GTi and was $49,800 for CX 25 Prestige, at a time when the similar 1988 Peugeot 505 GLS sedan had an MSRP of $17,775. The higher price was due to the unwillingness of PSA Peugeot Citroën to sell CX at wholesale price due to the high cost of engineering and modification work to meet US regulations.

Another specialist, &quot;Citroen Importers of North America&quot; (CINA), based in Atlanta, Georgia, also imported CX and modified them for US regulations. They received cease-and-desist letters from PSA Peugeot Citroën to stop selling CX cars to Americans. CINA was allowed to sell the remaining CX in stock before terminating the sales permanently.

Despite lack of advertisement, minimal service network, and higher retail price, Trend Imports, individuals on the grey market, CxAuto, and CINA managed to supply Americans with about 1,000 CX units during the 1980s.

==Prominent owners==
In France, the CX Prestige model was used by the French government, including former president Jacques Chirac, who kept using the CX officially many years after it had left production.

In addition to the 15 converted CX limousines used as state cars between 1978 and 1989 by Erich Honecker, the Citroën CX found use by many other senior SED party officials and government departments of the German Democratic Republic, with 13 CX Prestige Turbos found to be in the Stasi vehicle fleet.

Elena Ceaușescu, Deputy Prime Minister of Romania (and wife of Romania&#x27;s Communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu), was given a CX Prestige by King Juan Carlos I of Spain, which she used until her execution in 1989.

Rainier III, Prince of Monaco and his wife Grace Kelly owned two CXs, a 1981 CX Reflex D &quot;Break&quot; and a 1980 CX 2400 Pallas, which were both auctioned in July 2012.

Mário Soares the Prime Minister of Portugal used a CX with the license plate &quot;POR&quot;, while the CX of Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark sported the license plate &quot;Crown 101&quot;.

Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, had a special Landaulet created by Henri Chapron for his 1981 wedding.

Other royal and government figures who drove CXs include Harald V, King of Norway, Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands, and Prince Alphonse, Duke of Anjou and Cádiz.

Italian investigative journalist Carmine Pecorelli was investigating former prime minister Aldo Moro&#x27;s 1978 kidnapping and murder, when he himself was shot and killed by an unknown assailant, while driving his CX in Rome, in March 1979.

Prominent owners also include Carlos Santana and Johan Cruyff.

==Parts used in other vehicles==
Common parts from the CX were used in other more exclusive cars. For instance, the rear view mirrors of the &quot;Series 2&quot; CX were found on many—mostly British—sports cars, like the Lotus Esprit, the Jaguar XJ220, the TVR Chimaera and the (French) MVS Venturi.
The gearbox of the Citroën CX was used in the Matra Murena.

In 1982, Robert Cumberford built the Cumberford Martinique, an open two seater with engine and transmission from a BMW 733i, and steering and suspension from the CX. Pricing was 60% higher than its closest competitor, from Clénet Coachworks, and only two cars were built. Both still exist, one in France and one in San Diego.

==Legacy==
Citroën CX values strongly reflect condition, as befits a high volume car with complex components. Value was bolstered in 2015, when one of the Erich Honecker CX&#x27;s, a 1984 CX 2500 Injection Prestige, was sold for EUR €95,360 (US$108,621) at Artcurial. In 2018, another CX, Landaulet by Chapron, sold for EUR 95,360 as well.

The most collectible CX models are the very rare Series 1 GTi Turbo, and the Series 2 Prestige Turbo.

<text>Dagskrá was the first newspaper published in Iceland, first published in 1896 in Reykjavík. It continued to be published until 1899 as a weekly paper. Einar Benediktsson was the owner of the paper, which supported the policy of Heimastjórnarflokkurinn.

<text>VentureStar was a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch system proposed by Lockheed Martin and funded by the U.S. government. The goal was to replace the Space Shuttle by developing a re-usable spaceplane that could launch satellites into orbit at 1/10 of the cost. While the requirement was for an uncrewed launcher, it was expected to carry passengers as cargo. The VentureStar would have had a wingspan of , a length of , and would have weighed roughly 1000 t (2.2 million lb).

VentureStar was intended to be a commercial single-stage-to-orbit vehicle that would be launched vertically, but return to Earth as an airplane. Flights would have been leased to NASA as needed. After failures with the X-33 subscale technology demonstrator test vehicle, funding was cancelled in 2001.

VentureStar was essentially a bigger version of the X-33 but was not produced. The X-33 had ongoing problems meeting performance requirements for the carbon fiber hydrogen fuel tank. There were a number of other technologies that were part of the program, including the linear aerospike rocket engine. One point of praise was the metallic thermal protection system (TPS) developed by BF Goodrich.

== Advantages ==

VentureStar&#x27;s engineering and design would have offered numerous advantages over the Space Shuttle, notably considerable savings in time and materials, as well as increased safety. VentureStar was expected to launch satellites into orbit at $2,000 USD per kilogram, 1/10 of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s cost of $20,000 USD per kilogram.

Readying VentureStar for flight would have dramatically differed from that of the Space Shuttle. Unlike the Space Shuttle orbiter, which had to be lifted and assembled together with several other heavy components (a large external tank, plus two solid rocket boosters), VentureStar was to be simply inspected in a hangar similarly to an airplane.

Also unlike the Space Shuttle, VentureStar would not have relied upon solid rocket boosters, which had to be hauled out of the ocean and then refurbished after each launch. Furthermore, design specifications called for the use of linear aerospike engines that maintain thrust efficiency at all altitudes, whereas the Shuttle relied upon conventional nozzle engines which achieve maximum efficiency at only a certain altitude.

VentureStar would have used a new metallic thermal protection system, safer and cheaper to maintain than the ceramic protection system used on the Space Shuttle. VentureStar&#x27;s metallic heat shield would have eliminated 17,000 between-flight maintenance hours typically required to satisfactorily check (and replace if needed) the thousands of heat-resistant ceramic tiles that composed the Shuttle heat shield.

VentureStar was expected to be safer than most modern rockets. Whereas most modern rockets fail catastrophically when an engine fails, VentureStar would have a thrust reserve in each engine in the event of an emergency. For example, if an engine on VentureStar failed during ascent, another engine would shut off to counterbalance the failed thrust, and each of the remaining working engines could throttle up to safely continue the mission.

Unlike the Space Shuttle, whose solid rocket boosters produced chemical wastes, primarily hydrogen chloride, during launch, VentureStar&#x27;s exhaust would have been composed of only water vapor, since VentureStar&#x27;s main fuels would have been only liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. This would have given VentureStar the benefit of being environmentally clean. VentureStar&#x27;s simpler design would have excluded hypergolic propellants and even hydraulics, relying instead upon electrical power for flight controls, doors and landing gear.

Because of its lighter design, VentureStar would have been able to land at almost any major airport in an emergency, whereas the Space Shuttle required much longer runways than available at most public airports.

== Cancellation ==

The VentureStar program was cancelled due to development cost concerns accompanied by technical problems and failures in the X-33 program, a program which was intended as proof-of-concept for some of the critical technologies that were to be implemented in the VentureStar. The failure during a test of the X-33&#x27;s complex, multi-lobe composite-structure cryogenic hydrogen tank was one of the main reasons for the cancellation of both the X-33 and the VentureStar. Ultimately, the VentureStar program required too many technical advances at too high a cost to be viable.

==Program hardware==

Examples: 
*Metallic TPS
*XRS-2200 Linear aerospike main engines
*LOX tanks

One of the technological barriers at the time was the hydrogen fuel tank. One positive was that several years later the performance requirements for such a hydrogen tank were achieved, as NASA gained more experience with cryogenic carbon fiber fuel tanks.

On September 7, 2004, Northrop Grumman and NASA engineers unveiled a liquid hydrogen tank made of carbon fiber composite material that had demonstrated the ability for repeated fuelings and simulated launch cycles. The tank was a simple cylinder, not the complex shape used for the X-33. Northrop Grumman concluded that these successful tests enabled the development and refinement of new manufacturing processes that allowed the company to build large composite tanks without an autoclave; and design and engineering development of conformal fuel tanks appropriate for use on a single-stage-to-orbit vehicle.

== In fiction ==
In the 2001 novella and 2015 novel &quot;Lash-Up&quot; by Larry Bond and Chris Carlson, the VentureStar prototype is converted into an armed spacecraft named &quot;Defender&quot; in order to protect US space assets from China, which is using a space gun to destroy GPS satellites.

In John Varley&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Thunder&quot; and sequels, one of the major protagonists is a former VentureStar pilot.

In the television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, an operational VentureStar spaceplane is included in the opening credits as part of the history of human spaceflight.

In the television series &quot;Space Island One&quot;, a fleet of VentureStars resupply the titular commercial space station.

<doc id="526997" wikidata="Q7276528" url="?curid=526997" title="RFA Sea Centurion (A98)">
<text>RFA &quot;Sea Centurion was a fast [[sealift]] ship chartered to Britain&#x27;s [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] between 1998 and 2002 and subsequently in commercial service with Stena on Mediterranean routes asM/S &quot;Ark Forwarder.

==Background==
In the mid-1990s the British Ministry of Defence identified a need for sealift ships to support the new Joint Rapid Deployment Force (JRDF, subsequently the Joint Rapid Reaction Force). This requirement would ultimately be met by the construction of six Point-class sealift ships in 2002-3, but the charter of two commercial ships was approved as an interim measure.

==Description==
&quot;Sea Centurion&quot;/&quot;Ark Forwarder&quot; is the lead ship of what was planned as a class of five vehicle carriers of 21,104 gross tons, although only three were built due to financial problems at the shipyard. She is long and powered by four 8-cylinder Sulzer diesels. She has 2700 lane metres of roll-on/roll-off capacity.

==History==
Stena Ro-Ro ordered five ships from Società Esercizio Cantieri (SEC) at Viareggio in Tuscany, with ships 2 and 3 earmarked for charter to the British Ministry of Defence. Problems soon arose as the shipyard was too small and had to build the ships in three sections in different locations. Prolonged delays led to the Turkish operator UND walking away from the first ship, the &quot;Stena Ausonia&quot;, which was delivered to the British in October 1998 as the &quot;Sea Centurion&quot;. Then SEC entered bankruptcy with the second ship, &quot;Sea Chieftain&quot;, 50% complete and the third, Transmed&#x27;s &quot;Aronte&quot; had been launched. The British walked away from the &quot;Sea Chieftain&quot; and extended an existing charter on RFA &quot;Sea Crusader&quot; instead. Ships 2 and 3 were eventually completed after going through several shipyards and are now serving Stena as &quot;Stena Freighter&quot; and &quot;Stena Carrier&quot; on the Sweden-Germany route. Ships 4 and 5 were started but never completed.

After leaving RFA service the &quot;Sea Centurion&quot; became the &quot;Mont Ventoux&quot; in December 2002, the &quot;Stena Forwarder&quot; in August 2005 and the &quot;Ark Forwarder&quot; in February 2007. she is serving the Genoa-Palermo route for Stena under a Cypriot flag, homeported in Limassol.

<doc id="526998" wikidata="Q1537445" url="?curid=526998" title="Dockworker">
<text>A dockworker (also called a longshoreman, stevedore, docker, wharfman, lumper or wharfie) is a waterfront manual laborer who loads and unloads ships.

As a result of the intermodal shipping container revolution, the required number of dockworkers has declined by over 90% since the 1960s.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;stevedore&quot; () originated in Portugal or Spain, and entered the English language through its use by sailors. It started as a phonetic spelling of &quot;estivador&quot; (Portuguese) or &quot;estibador&quot; (Spanish), meaning &quot;a man who loads ships and stows cargo&quot;, which was the original meaning of &quot;stevedore&quot; (though there is a secondary meaning of &quot;a man who stuffs&quot; in Spanish); compare Latin &quot;stīpāre&quot; meaning &quot;to stuff&quot;, as in &quot;to fill with stuffing&quot;. In Ancient and Modern Greek, the verb στοιβάζω (stivazo) means pile up. In Great Britain and Ireland, people who load and unload ships are usually called &quot;dockers&quot;; in Australia, they are called &quot;stevedores&quot;, &quot;dockworkers&quot; or &quot;wharfies&quot;; and, in the United States and Canada, the term &quot;longshoreman&quot;, derived from &quot;man-along-the-shore&quot; (or + &quot;man&quot;), is used. Before the extensive use of container ships and shore-based handling machinery in the United States, &quot;longshoremen&quot; referred exclusively to the dockworkers, while &quot;stevedores&quot;, part of a separate trade union, worked on the ships operating their cranes and moving cargo.

==History==
Dockworkers, also known as longshoremen and stevedores, have existed since ancient times. The role of dockworkers has evolved significantly over the centuries as maritime trade has grown and modernized:

* Ancient times: The Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans all relied on dockworkers to load and unload cargo from ships at port cities such as Carthage, Athens, and Ostia.
* Medieval period: In the Middle Ages, dockworkers played a crucial role in the trade networks of Europe. The Hanseatic League, a powerful trading confederation in Northern Europe, employed dockworkers to handle goods at major ports like Lübeck and Bruges.
* Industrial Revolution: The Industrial Revolution brought steam-powered ships and railways, leading to increased trade volumes and the need for more efficient handling of cargo. Dockworkers organized into unions to protect worker rights and improve working conditions, leading to the formation of organizations such as the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association in the United States.
* Containerization: The latter 20th century saw the introduction of containerization, which revolutionized the shipping industry by standardizing how goods were transported, leading to faster turnaround times and increased efficiency. Dockworker use declined by 90%, with those remaining principally operating heavy machinery such as cranes. A dramatic increase in global trade was seen, a result of improved technology and liberalized trade treaties. 

==Loading and unloading ships==

Loading and unloading ships requires knowledge of the operation of loading equipment, the proper techniques for lifting and stowing cargo, and the correct handling of hazardous materials. In addition, workers must be physically strong and able to follow orders attentively. Many longshoremen are needed to unload a ship. A ship can only be at a port for a limited amount of time, so their work must be completed quickly.

In earlier days before the introduction of containerization, men who loaded and unloaded ships had to tie down cargoes with rope. A type of stopper knot is called the stevedore knot. Securely tying up parcels of goods is called &quot;stevedore lashing&quot; or &quot;stevedore knotting&quot;. While loading a general cargo vessel, they use dunnage, which are pieces of wood (or nowadays sometimes strong inflatable dunnage bags) set down to keep the cargo out of any water that might be lying in the hold or are placed as shims between cargo crates for load securing.

Today, the vast majority of non-bulk cargo is transported in intermodal containers. The containers arrive at a port by truck, rail, or another ship and are stacked in the port&#x27;s storage area. When the vessel that will be transporting them arrives, the containers it is offloading are unloaded by a crane. The containers either leave the port by truck or rail or are stored until they are placed on another ship. Once the ship is offloaded, the containers it leaves with are brought to the dock by truck. A crane lifts the containers from the trucks onto the ship. As the containers pile up on the ship, the workers connect them to the vessel and the other already-placed containers. The jobs involved include the crane operators, the workers who connect the containers to the ship and each other, the truck drivers who transport the containers from the dock and storage area, the workers who track the containers in the storage area as they are loaded and unloaded, as well as various supervisors. Those workers at the port who handle and move the containers are likely to be considered stevedores or dockworkers.

Before containerization, freight was often handled with a longshoreman’s hook, a tool which became emblematic of the profession (mainly on the west coast of the United States and Canada).

Traditionally, stevedores had no fixed job but would arrive at the docks in the morning seeking employment for the day. London dockers called this practice &quot;standing on the stones&quot;, while in the United States, it was referred to as &quot;shaping up&quot; or assembling for the &quot;shape-up&quot;.

Dock workers have been a prominent part of the modern labor movement.

==Notable dockworkers==

Former stevedores and dockworkers include:
* Crispus Attucks – American patriot
* Harry Bridges – founder of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU)
* Joey Coyle – basis for the movie &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;
* Jack Dash – British dock workers&#x27; trade union leader
* Peter Fraser – Prime Minister of New Zealand (1940-1949)
* Danny Greene – American mobster
* Eric Hoffer – philosopher and social critic
* Patrick Joseph &quot;P.J.&quot; Kennedy – American businessman and grandfather of 35th U.S. President John F. Kennedy
* Artie Lange – actor and comedian 
* Tom Mann – British trade unionist and organizer of the London Dock Strike of 1889
* Peter MacKay – Canadian former government minister and conservative party leader (a stevedore for two summers while a teenager)
* Bruce Nelson – labor historian, author of &quot;Workers on the Waterfront&quot;
* Benito Quinquela Martín – painter from Buenos Aires, Argentina. His works reflect the work at the docks in La Boca, a portuary district of Buenos Aires. 
* Stan Weir – blue-collar intellectual and sociologist, founder of Singlejack Press

==In popular culture==
*In 1949, reporter Malcolm Johnson was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for a 24-part investigative series titled &quot;Crime on the Waterfront&quot;, published in the &quot;New York Sun&quot;. 
*The material from Malcolm Johnson&#x27;s investigative series was fictionalized and used as a basis for the influential film &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), starring Marlon Brando as a longshoreman, and the working conditions on the docks figure significantly in the film&#x27;s plot. &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; was a critical and commercial success that received twelve Academy Award nominations and won eight, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Brando, Best Supporting Actress for Eva Marie Saint, and Best Director for Elia Kazan. The American Film Institute ranked it the 8th-greatest American movie of all time in 1997 and 19th in 2007.
*Playwright Arthur Miller was involved in the early stages of the development of &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;; his play &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; (1955) also deals with the troubled life of a longshoreman.
*In season 2 of the HBO series &quot;The Wire&quot;, which first aired in 2003, the Stevedore Union and its members working in Baltimore, particularly Frank Sobotka, figure prominently in the second season&#x27;s story.
*The 2013 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; features a character, Floyd Hebert, who works as a longshoreman at the city port. One of the main characters, Trevor Philips, uses Floyd&#x27;s job to prepare a cargo ship robbery during the game&#x27;s storyline.

<text>In computing, SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker). SQL injection must exploit a security vulnerability in an application&#x27;s software, for example, when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed. SQL injection is mostly known as an attack vector for websites but can be used to attack any type of SQL database.

SQL injection attacks allow attackers to spoof identity, tamper with existing data, cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances, allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system, destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable, and become administrators of the database server. Document-oriented NoSQL databases can also be affected by this security vulnerability.

In a 2012 study, it was observed that the average web application received four attack campaigns per month, and retailers received twice as many attacks as other industries.

==History==
Discussions of SQL injection, such as a 1998 article in Phrack Magazine, began in the late 1990s. SQL injection was considered one of the top 10 web application vulnerabilities of 2007 and 2010 by the Open Web Application Security Project. In 2013, SQL injection was rated the number one attack on the OWASP top ten.

==Root cause==
SQL Injection is a common security vulnerability that arises from letting attacker supplied data become SQL code. This happens when programmers assemble SQL queries either by string interpolation or by concatenating SQL commands with user supplied data. Therefore, injection relies on the fact that SQL statements consist of both data used by the SQL statement and commands that control how the SQL statement is executed. For example, in the SQL statement select * from person where name = &#x27;susan&#x27; and age = 2 the string &#x27;susan&#x27; is data and the fragment and age = 2 is an example of a command (the value 2 is also data in this example).

SQL injection occurs when specially crafted user input is processed by the receiving program in a way that allows the input to exit a data context and enter a command context. This allows the attacker to alter the structure of the SQL statement which is executed.

As a simple example, imagine that the data &#x27;susan&#x27; in the above statement was provided by user input. The user entered the string &#x27;susan&#x27; (without the apostrophes) in a web form text entry field, and the program used string concatenation statements to form the above SQL statement from the three fragments select * from person where name=&#x27;, the user input of &#x27;susan&#x27;, and &#x27; and age = 2.

Now imagine that instead of entering &#x27;susan&#x27; the attacker entered &#x27; or 1=1; --.

The program will use the same string concatenation approach with the 3 fragments of select * from person where name=&#x27;, the user input of &#x27; or 1=1; --, and &#x27; and age = 2 and construct the statement select * from person where name=&quot; or 1=1; --&#x27; and age = 2. Many databases will ignore the text after the &#x27;--&#x27; string as this denotes a comment. The structure of the SQL command is now select * from person where name=&quot; or 1=1; and this will select all person rows rather than just those named &#x27;susan&#x27; whose age is 2. The attacker has managed to craft a data string which exits the data context and entered a command context.

==Ways to exploit==

Although the root cause of all SQL injections is the same, there are different techniques to exploit it. Some of them are discussed below:

===Getting direct output or action===

Imagine a program creates a SQL statement using the following string assignment command :

var statement = &quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = &#x27;&quot; + userName + &quot;&#x27;&quot;;

This SQL code is designed to pull up the records of the specified username from its table of users. However, if the &quot;userName&quot; variable is crafted in a specific way by a malicious user, the SQL statement may do more than the code author intended. For example, setting the &quot;userName&quot; variable as:
or using comments to even block the rest of the query (there are three types of SQL comments). All three lines have a space at the end:
renders one of the following SQL statements by the parent language:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = &quot; OR &#x27;1&#x27;=&#x27;1&#x27;;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = &quot; OR &#x27;1&#x27;=&#x27;1&#x27; -- &#x27;;

If this code were to be used in authentication procedure then this example could be used to force the selection of every data field (*) from &quot;all&quot; users rather than from one specific user name as the coder intended, because the evaluation of &#x27;1&#x27;=&#x27;1&#x27; is always true.

The following value of &quot;userName&quot; in the statement below would cause the deletion of the &quot;users&quot; table as well as the selection of all data from the &quot;userinfo&quot; table (in essence revealing the information of every user), using an API that allows multiple statements:

a&#x27;;DROP TABLE users; SELECT * FROM userinfo WHERE &#x27;t&#x27; = &#x27;t

This input renders the final SQL statement as follows and specified:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = &#x27;a&#x27;;DROP TABLE users; SELECT * FROM userinfo WHERE &#x27;t&#x27; = &#x27;t&#x27;;

While most SQL server implementations allow multiple statements to be executed with one call in this way, some SQL APIs such as PHP&#x27;s codice_1 function do not allow this for security reasons. This prevents attackers from injecting entirely separate queries, but doesn&#x27;t stop them from modifying queries.

===Blind SQL injection===
Blind SQL injection is used when a web application is vulnerable to a SQL injection, but the results of the injection are not visible to the attacker. The page with the vulnerability may not be one that displays data but will display differently depending on the results of a logical statement injected into the legitimate SQL statement called for that page.
This type of attack has traditionally been considered time-intensive because a new statement needed to be crafted for each bit recovered, and depending on its structure, the attack may consist of many unsuccessful requests. Recent advancements have allowed each request to recover multiple bits, with no unsuccessful requests, allowing for more consistent and efficient extraction. There are several tools that can automate these attacks once the location of the vulnerability and the target information has been established.

====Conditional responses====
One type of blind SQL injection forces the database to evaluate a logical statement on an ordinary application screen. As an example, a book review website uses a query string to determine which book review to display. So the URL codice_2 would cause the server to run the query
SELECT * FROM bookreviews WHERE ID = &#x27;5&#x27;;
from which it would populate the review page with data from the review with ID 5, stored in the table bookreviews. The query happens completely on the server; the user does not know the names of the database, table, or fields, nor does the user know the query string. The user only sees that the above URL returns a book review. A hacker can load the URLs codice_3 and codice_4, which may result in queries
SELECT * FROM bookreviews WHERE ID = &#x27;5&#x27; OR &#x27;1&#x27;=&#x27;1&#x27;;
SELECT * FROM bookreviews WHERE ID = &#x27;5&#x27; AND &#x27;1&#x27;=&#x27;2&#x27;;
respectively. If the original review loads with the &quot;1=1&quot; URL and a blank or error page is returned from the &quot;1=2&quot; URL, and the returned page has not been created to alert the user the input is invalid, or in other words, has been caught by an input test script, the site is likely vulnerable to an SQL injection attack as the query will likely have passed through successfully in both cases. The hacker may proceed with this query string designed to reveal the version number of MySQL running on the server: codice_5, which would show the book review on a server running MySQL 4 and a blank or error page otherwise. The hacker can continue to use code within query strings to achieve their goal directly, or to glean more information from the server in hopes of discovering another avenue of attack.

===Second-order SQL injection===
Second-order SQL injection occurs when an application only guards its SQL against immediate user input, but has a less strict policy when dealing with data already stored in the system. Therefore, although such application would manage to safely process the user input and store it without issue, it would store the malicious SQL statement as well. Then, when another part of that application would use that data in a query that isn&#x27;t protected from SQL injection, this malicious statement might get executed.
This attack requires more knowledge of how submitted values are later used. Automated web application security scanners would not easily detect this type of SQL injection and may need to be manually instructed where to check for evidence that it is being attempted.

In order to protect from this kind of attack, all SQL processing must be uniformly secure, despite the data source.

==Prevention/Mitigation==
An SQL injection is a well known attack and easily prevented by simple measures. After an apparent SQL injection attack on TalkTalk in 2015, the BBC reported that security experts were stunned that such a large company would be vulnerable to it. Techniques like pattern matching, software testing, and grammar analysis are some common ways to mitigate these attacks.

Prevention measures listed further below can be summarized into a simple two-part checklist:

# Every variable data literal should be represented in the query by a special marker, and later bound to the query through a prepared statement
# Every other query part (such as keyword or database schema name) must be filtered through a whitelist

A simple example in PHP demonstrating usage of both rules:

$mysqli = new mysqli(&#x27;hostname&#x27;, &#x27;db_username&#x27;, &#x27;db_password&#x27;, &#x27;db_name&#x27;);
$sort_column = $_GET[&#x27;sort_column&#x27;] ?? &#x27;name&#x27;;
// checking the column name against a whitelist:
if (!in_array($sort_column, [&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;birthday&#x27;], true)) {
 throw new InvalidArgumentException(&quot;Invalid sort column&quot;);
// using a parameter to represent the data value:
$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `birthday` &gt; ? ORDER BY `$sort_column`&quot;,
// preparing SQL, binding the birthday value and executing the query:
$result = $mysqli-&gt;execute_query($query, [$_GET[&#x27;birthday&#x27;]]);
This way, no malicious data will be able to make it into SQL.

=== String escaping===
One of the traditional ways to prevent injections is to add &quot;every piece of data as a quoted string&quot; and escape all characters, that have special meaning in SQL strings, in that data. The manual for an SQL DBMS explains which characters have a special meaning, which allows creating a comprehensive blacklist of characters that need translation. For instance, every occurrence of a single quote (codice_6) in a string parameter must be prepended with a backslash (codice_7) so that the database understands the single quote is part of a given string, rather than its terminator. PHP&#x27;s MySQLi module provides the codice_8 function to escape strings according to MySQL semantics; in the following example the username is a string parameter, and therefore it can be protected by means of string escaping:

$mysqli = new mysqli(&#x27;hostname&#x27;, &#x27;db_username&#x27;, &#x27;db_password&#x27;, &#x27;db_name&#x27;);
$query = sprintf(&quot;SELECT * FROM `Users` WHERE UserName=&#x27;%s&#x27;&quot;,
 $mysqli-&gt;real_escape_string($username),
$mysqli-&gt;query($query);
Depending solely on the programmer to diligently escape all string parameters presents inherent risks, given the potential for oversights in the process. To mitigate this vulnerability, programmers may opt to develop their own abstraction layers to automate the escaping of parameters.

Besides, not every piece of data can be added to SQL as a string literal (MySQL&#x27;s LIMIT clause arguments or table/column names for example) and in this case escaping string-related special characters will do no good whatsoever, leaving resulting SQL open to injections.

===Object relational mappers===
Object–relational mapping (ORM) frameworks such as Hibernate and ActiveRecord provide an object-oriented interface for queries over a relational database. Most, if not all, ORMs, automatically handle the escaping needed to prevent SQL injection attacks, as a part of the framework&#x27;s query API. However, many ORMs provide the ability to bypass their mapping facilities and emit raw SQL statements; improper use of this functionality can introduce the possibility for an injection attack.

===Parameterized statements===

With most development platforms, parameterized statements that work with parameters can be used (sometimes called placeholders or bind variables) instead of embedding user input in the statement. A placeholder can only store a value of the given type and not an arbitrary SQL fragment. Hence the SQL injection would simply be treated as a strange (and probably invalid) parameter value. In many cases, the SQL statement is fixed, and each parameter is a scalar, not a table. The user input is then assigned (bound) to a parameter.

===Pattern check===
Integer, float, or Boolean string parameters can be checked to determine if their value is a valid representation of the given type. Strings that must adhere to a specific pattern or condition (e.g. dates, UUIDs, phone numbers) can also be checked to determine if said pattern is matched.

===Database permissions===
Limiting the permissions on the database login used by the web application to only what is needed may help reduce the effectiveness of any SQL injection attacks that exploit any bugs in the web application.

For example, on Microsoft SQL Server, a database logon could be restricted from selecting on some of the system tables which would limit exploits that try to insert JavaScript into all the text columns in the database.

deny select on sys.sysobjects to webdatabaselogon;
deny select on sys.objects to webdatabaselogon;
deny select on sys.tables to webdatabaselogon;
deny select on sys.views to webdatabaselogon;
deny select on sys.packages to webdatabaselogon;

<doc id="527000" wikidata="Q7610582" url="?curid=527000" title="Stephen Sprouse">
<text>Stephen Sprouse (September 12, 1953 – March 4, 2004) was an American fashion designer and artist. He is credited with pioneering the 1980s mix of &quot;uptown sophistication in clothing with a downtown punk and pop sensibility&quot;. 

Sprouse received the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award for Best New Designer in 1984. The following year he for bankruptcy. Sprouse struggled to maintain his label after making another investment and seeing some success. He continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, working with such luminaries as Andy Warhol and Keith Haring. In 2000, he collaborated with Marc Jacobs to produce designs for Louis Vuitton.

==Life and career==

=== Early life and education ===
Stephen Sprouse was born in Dayton, Ohio on September 12, 1953, the oldest son of Norbert and Joanne Sprouse, where his father was stationed at an Air Force base. When sprouse was two, his family relocated to Columbus, Indiana, where his father successfully pursued a manufacturing career. They lived lavishly in a white columned mansion reminiscent of the film &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, according to a friend. 

Sprouse&#x27;s artistic skill first surfaced when he was a child. He was a bashful youngster who always kept a pen in his hand to sketch. Sprouse was only assertive when he was holding a pen or pencil, and then only to the point where teachers called him the Art Supervisor.

When Sprouse was 12 years old, he first met fashion designer Norman Norell, thanks to his father showing his portfolio to someone at the Art Institute of Chicago. His father sent him to New York to meet Norell and fashion designer Bill Blass. Blass then employed Sprouse as a summer apprentice when he was 14. Sprouse later recalled to fashion editor Amy Spindler, &quot;He was cool, my dad ... I mean, this was in Indiana. He could have beat me up if I didn&#x27;t play football, and he didn&#x27;t.&quot;

When Sprouse started attending the Rhode Island School of Design in 1971, an instructor referred to him as &quot;the designer of the future.&quot; When Sprouse started college, his interests shifted from fashion to art, and three months later, he left for New York. According to Sprouse&#x27;s close friend Charles G. Beyer, he was fascinated by pop artist Andy Warhol and the Factory scene. &quot;He loved Edie Sedgwick. For him, she was like the sixties Kate Moss,&quot; said Beyer.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
He received permission to work in New York while still a student, working with fashion designer Leo Narducci, whom he had previously worked with during a summer in New York when he was 16. Narducci phoned fashion designer George Halley and he remarked that Sprouse&#x27;s work resembled fashion designer Halston&#x27;s. When questioned if he had ever met Halston, Sprouse said he hadn&#x27;t met him before, but he had respected him and believed his work was excellent. A meeting was arranged and after learning that he didn&#x27;t enjoy college, Halston offered him a position as an assistant. He thus left school and relocated to New York.

Sprouse along with Dennis Christopher and Bill Dugan made up a trio of assistants known as the Halstonettes. He gained knowledge about luxury and form from Halston. He also got to know several of the prominent people in society at the time. A sort of salon, Halston&#x27;s boutique on East 68th Street served as a rendezvous place for New York society. Sprouse convinced Halston to trim the bottoms of the dresses a few days before a fashion show, resulting in the &#x27;Skimp&#x27; of 1974, a reinvention of the minidress that contrasted with the normally elongated silhouette of that era. 

After leaving Halston in 1975, Sprouse lived in a loft in the Bowery with singer Debbie Harry, who would frequently fed his cats. Blondie was a new band that Harry and her boyfriend, guitarist Chris Stein, were starting to get recognition for at New York nightclubs CBGB and Max&#x27;s Kansas City. Sprouse had enjoyed dressing up Halston&#x27;s favourite model Karen Bjornson, who epitomized the stylish blonde from the Upper East Side. Sprouse made clothing out of torn tights, T-shirts, and items he found on the streets, turning Harry into a sort of &quot;Bowery Bjornson.&quot;

=== Stephen Sprouse collections ===
Sprouse launched himself as a commercial fashion designer when he competed in a fashion show contest of young designers in the spring of 1983 (at the suggestion of photographer and friend Steven Meisel), sponsored by the Polaroid Corporation. Based upon the favorable editorial reaction he received, he soon after formed his first company, Stephen Sprouse, Inc., and set up a showroom and production space at 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, launching his initial commercial collections for retail (prior to this, production of his early 1983 apparel, done on a small scale, was produced by Dianne Phelp&#x27;s company &quot;Triad&quot;).

With financial backing provided by his parents, Sprouse soon formed an in-house production staff for the small runway collection he showed in his silver-painted showroom (in homage Andy Warhol&#x27;s Silver Factory loft of the sixties) in December 1983. The show garnered much attention and favorable reviews (notably from &quot;The New York Times&quot; Fashion Editor, John Duka). 

Stephen Sprouse&#x27;s initial Day-Glo bright, sixties-inspired, graffiti-printed fashion collections for men and women caught the attention of fashion editors, store buyers, and fashionistas, garnering much media coverage. His initial collections (1983–1985) were huge critical hits, sold at only the &quot;best&quot; stores. His 1983 collections were sold exclusively at Bergdorf Goodman and Henri Bendel in New York City on a small scale. Subsequently, Sprouse received the CFDA award for Best New Designer in 1984.

To much surprise in the fashion and retail communities, Sprouse declared bankruptcy in June 1985. Sprouse cited production, late deliveries, and financial problems in an interview with Women&#x27;s Wear Daily shortly after he closed his initial business.

Sprouse informally showed a Fall 1985 collection to buyers and the press at his new showroom in Union Square on Broadway - the last location of Andy Warhol&#x27;s infamous &quot;Factory&quot; lofts. A runway presentation at Club USA in NYC was initially planned (and largely promoted) for its grand opening. Subsequently, the show was cancelled; a Stephen Sprouse Incorporated representative stated at the time that the show was cancelled due to the company relocating to their new Union Square location. The apparel shown were &quot;finished samples.&quot;

Sprouse referred to his Fall 1985 collection as being &quot;more hippie weird&quot; and early seventies-inspired, with bell-bottom trousers, psychedelic prints, and maxi skirts, but the company lacked the funds and staff to produce the apparel.

Sprouse was initially noted by fashion magazines and retailers for using high-quality, expensive, custom-dyed fabrics (his woolens were largely sourced by the high-end Italian textile house Agnona). Sprouse personally did the graffiti that adorned many of his very early, expensive garments (1983, early 1984), which added to their desirability.

In September 1987, with financial backing from high-end furniture manufacturer Knoll International (then known as GFI/General Felt Industries), Sprouse opened a three-level store on Wooster Street in New York City; a second (smaller) store was opened in Los Angeles in the spring of 1988 at the Beverly Center shopping complex. He partly abandoned his signature sixties silhouettes, instead drawing inspiration from the mid-seventies London-based punk rock scene. For his Fall 1987 and Spring 1988 collections, he was given permission to use one of Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Camouflage&quot; screen-prints to utilize as textile designs (Sprouse created a secondary print, based on Warhol&#x27;s original). For his Fall 1988 &quot;Signature&quot; collection, he collaborated with artist Keith Haring to create several abstract prints of Jesus with graffiti, and Haring&#x27;s &quot;squibbles.&quot; His company, CSI ({Andrew} Cogan Sprouse Incorporated) also wholesaled the various collections (&quot;Stephen Sprouse,&quot; &quot;Sprouse,&quot; and &quot;S&quot;) to retailers (commencing with his Spring 1988 collection), but he lost his financial backing due to poor sales and production/quality issues, closing again in December 1988, shortly after the company shipped their &quot;Holiday&quot; line.

Sprouse worked extensively with the band Duran Duran in the late 1980s, designing the clothes for their 1989 tour for the album &quot;Big Thing&quot;, as well as the cover for their greatest hits album &quot;Decade&quot; of the same year. Additionally, he styled and dressed Billy Idol in the early 1990s for Idol&#x27;s &quot;comeback&quot; (which garnered little interest).

=== Brand collaborations ===
In 1992, Sprouse designed an exclusive men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s &quot;capsule collection&quot; (i.e.: 32 pieces in whole) for Bergdorf Goodman, dubbed &quot;CyberPunk,&quot; which featured Velcro in lieu of traditional buttons. Sprouse (again) largely sourced custom made textiles from Agnona for his fall 1992 collection. The production of the collection was done entirely on a couture level, leading to extremely high-priced garments (e.g.: $500 for a pair of men&#x27;s nylon underwear - that being one of the lowest priced items available). Bergdorf Goodman sold the line for two seasons (Fall 1992 &amp; Spring 1993), with very limited success, despite wide media coverage, and featuring Sprouse&#x27;s garments in their window displays.

Sprouse showed a collection (&quot;CyberGlitter&quot;) at Club USA in NYC for Fall 1993, but it never went into full production, despite orders being placed from retail buyers.

In 1995, Barneys New York handled the production of an exclusive women&#x27;s spring/summer line. &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine featured the moderately priced garments in its pages, but it sold poorly. That same year, Sprouse also served as the costume curator for the new Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, and designed the staff&#x27;s uniforms.

In 1996, Sprouse designed the logo and cover for New York Glam outfit Psychotica&#x27;s self-titled album, released under American records.
In 1998, with full production and backing from Italian manufacturer Staff International, he was briefly back in business, but the clothes sold poorly and were largely ignored by the fashion press and retailers that adored him in the 1980s.

The graffiti logo bags he designed in collaboration with Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton in 2001 made the fashion world take notice once again.

In 2002, he created a vast collection of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s apparel, home accessories, sports gear, etc. for the Target discount chain (dubbed &quot;AmericaLand&quot;) - mostly rendered in a graffiti patriotic motif.

In 2003, Sprouse collaborated with fashion brand Diesel on a take over of its Union Square Store for September&#x27;s New York Fashion Week. As part of the collaboration, Sprouse designed a series of limited edition jeans, T-shirts and hats, and made a complete makeover of the Diesel store, which meant adding his renowned Day-Glo design to windows, interiors, and outer building exteriors. At the launch of the event Diesel’s founder and President, Renzo Rosso, explained the project as &quot;first and foremost a tribute that we wish to pay to one of the most groundbreaking and far-reaching artists of our time, someone who went beyond categorizations, means of expressions, and gender- a common approach at Diesel.&quot;

== Death ==
Sprouse died of heart failure at the age of 50 on March 4, 2004 at St. Luke&#x27;s-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City, after a closely guarded diagnosis of lung cancer a year before.

== Legacy ==
For both Fall 2006 and 2008, Marc Jacobs utilized Sprouse&#x27;s 1987 graffiti leopard images for handbags, shoes, and scarves for Louis Vuitton, which sold-out instantly.

A book on the career of Sprouse, &quot;The Stephen Sprouse Book&quot;, by Roger Padilha and Mauricio Padilha, with a foreword by Tama Janowitz, was released by Rizzoli in January 2009.

In July 2022, an exhibition titled &quot;Stephen Sprouse: Rock, Art, Fashion&quot; opened at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.

<text>Mir Syed Jafar Ali Khan Mirza Muhammad Siraj-ud-Daulah (1733 – 2 July 1757), commonly known as Siraj-ud-Daulah or Siraj ud-Daula, was the last independent Nawab of the Bengal Subah. The end of his reign marked the start of the rule of the East India Company over Bengal and later almost all of the Indian subcontinent.

Siraj succeeded his maternal grandfather, Alivardi Khan as the Nawab of Bengal in April 1756 at the age of 23. Betrayed by Mir Jafar, the commander of Nawab&#x27;s army, Siraj lost the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757. The forces of the East India Company under Robert Clive invaded and the administration of Bengal fell into the hands of the company.

==Early life and background==

Siraj was born to the family of Mirza Muhammad Hashim and Amina Begum in 1733. Soon after his birth, Alivardi Khan, Siraj&#x27;s maternal grandfather, was appointed the Deputy Governor of Bihar. Amina Begum was the youngest daughter of Alivardi Khan and Princess Sharfunnisa, the paternal aunt of Mir Jafar. His father, Mirza Muhammad Hashim was the youngest son of Haji Ahmad, the elder brother of Alivardi Khan. Siraj&#x27;s great-grandfather was Mirza Muhammad Madani, who was of either of Arab or Turkic ancestry, the son of a foster-brother of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb; Madani himself began his career as a cup-bearer under the latter&#x27;s son Azam Shah. His great-grandmother belonged to the Turkic Afshar tribe of Khorasan. Through her, he was a grandnephew of Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan, the two having shared a common ancestor in Nawab Aqil Khan.

Siraj was regarded as the &quot;fortune child&quot; of the family. He received the special affection of his grandfather and was raised at the Nawab&#x27;s palace with all necessary education and training suitable for a future Nawab. Young Siraj also accompanied Alivardi on his military ventures against the Marathas in 1746. In 1750, Siraj revolted against his grandfather and seized Patna, but quickly surrendered and was forgiven. In May 1752, Alivardi declared Siraj as his successor. The former later died on 9 April 1756 at the age of eighty.

==Reign as Nawab==
Siraj ud-Daulah&#x27;s nomination to the &quot;Nawab&quot; ship aroused the jealousy and enmity of his maternal aunt, Ghaseti Begum (Mehar un-Nisa Begum), Mir Jafar, Jagat Seth (Mehtab Chand) and Shaukat Jang (Siraj&#x27;s cousin). Ghaseti Begum possessed huge wealth, which was the source of her influence and strength. Apprehending serious opposition from her, Siraj ud-Daulah seized her wealth from Motijheel Palace and placed her under confinement. The Nawab also made changes in high government positions by giving them to his own favourites. Mir Madan was appointed &quot;Bakshi&quot; (paymaster of the army) in place of Mir Jafar. Mohanlal was elevated to the rank of &quot;peshkar&quot; (courtclerk) of his Dewan-khane and he exercised great influence in the administration. Eventually, Siraj suppressed Shaukat Jang, governor of Purnia, who was killed in a clash.

=== Black Hole of Calcutta ===

During this period, the British East India Company was increasing their influence in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in Bengal; Siraj soon grew to resent the politico-military presence of the East India Company in Bengal. In particular, he was angered at the Company&#x27;s alleged involvement with and instigation of some members of his own court to a conspiracy to oust him. His charges against the company were broadly threefold. Firstly, that they strengthened the fortification around the Fort William without any intimation or approval; secondly, that they grossly abused trade privileges granted them by the Mughal rulers – which caused heavy loss of customs duties for the government; and thirdly, that they gave shelter to some of his officers, for example, Krishnadas, son of Rajballav, who fled Dhaka after misappropriating government funds. Hence, when the East India Company began further enhancement of military strength at Fort William in Calcutta, Siraj ud-Daulah ordered them to stop. The Company did not heed his directives; consequently, Siraj retaliated and captured Calcutta (for a short while renamed Alinagar) from the British in June 1756. The Nawab gathered his forces together and took Fort William. The British captives were placed in the prison cell as a temporary holding by a local commander, but there was confusion in the Indian chain of command, and the captives were left there overnight, and many of them died.

Sir William Meredith, during the Parliamentary inquiry into Robert Clive&#x27;s actions in India, vindicated Siraj ud-Daulah of any charge surrounding the Black Hole incident:
&quot;A peace was however agreed upon with Surajah Dowlah; and the persons who went as ambassadors to confirm that peace formed the conspiracy, by which he was deprived of his kingdom and his life.&quot;

===Nizamat Imambara===

Shi&#x27;ism was introduced to Bengal during the governorship of Shah Shuja (1641–1661 AD), son of Shah Jahan. From 1707 AD to 1880 AD, the Nawabs of Bengal were Shias. They built huge &quot;imambaras&quot; (Shia houses of worship), including the biggest of the Subcontinent built by Nawab Siraj-ud Daula, the Nizammat Imambara in the political capital Murshidabad. It and other imambaras built in towns such as the trading hub Hoogly attracted Shia scholars from within and outside India.

===Conspiracy of British===
The Nawab was infuriated on learning of the attack on Chandernagar. His former hatred of the British returned, but he now felt the need to strengthen himself by alliances against the British. The Nawab was plagued by fear of attack from the north by the Afghans under Ahmad Shah Durrani and from the west by the Marathas. Therefore, he could not deploy his entire force against the British for fear of being attacked from the flanks. A deep distrust set in between the British and the Nawab. As a result, Siraj started secret negotiations with Jean Law, chief of the French factory at Cossimbazar, and de Bussy. The Nawab also moved a large division of his army under Rai Durlabh to Plassey, on the island of Cossimbazar south of Murshidabad.

Popular discontent against the Nawab flourished in his own court. The Seths, the traders of Bengal, were in perpetual fear for their wealth under the reign of Siraj, contrary to the situation under Alivardi&#x27;s reign. They had engaged Yar Lutuf Khan to defend them in case they were threatened in any way. William Watts, the Company representative at the court of Siraj, informed Clive about a conspiracy at the court to overthrow the ruler. The conspirators included Mir Jafar, the paymaster of the army, Rai Durlabh, Yar Lutuf Khan and Omichund (Amir Chand), a Sikh merchant, and several officers in the army. When communicated in this regard by Mir Jafar, Clive referred it to the select committee in Calcutta on 1 May. The committee passed a resolution in support of the alliance. A treaty was drawn up between the British and Mir Jafar to raise him to the throne of the Nawab in return for support to the British in the field of battle and the bestowal of large sums of money upon them as compensation for the attack on Calcutta. On 2 May, Clive broke up his camp and sent half the troops to Calcutta and the other half to Chandernagar.

Mir Jafar and the Seths desired that the confederacy between the British and himself be kept secret from Omichund, but when he found out about it, he threatened to betray the conspiracy if his share was not increased to three million rupees (£300,000). Hearing of this, Clive suggested an expedient to the committee. He suggested that two treaties be drawn – the real one on white paper, containing no reference to Omichund and the other on red paper, containing Omichund&#x27;s desired stipulation, to deceive him. The Members of the Committee signed on both treaties, but Admiral Watson signed only the real one and his signature had to be counterfeited on the fictitious one. Both treaties and separate articles for donations to the army, navy squadron and committee were signed by Mir Jafar on 4 June.

Lord Clive testified and defended himself thus before the House of Commons of Parliament on 10 May 1773, during the Parliamentary inquiry into his conduct in India:

&quot;Omichund, his confidential servant, as &quot;he&quot; thought, told his master of an agreement made between the English and Monsieur Duprée [may be a mistranscription of Dupleix] to attack him, and received for that advice a sum of not less than four lacks of rupees. Finding this to be the man in whom the nawab entirely trusted, it soon became our object to consider him as a most material engine in the intended revolution. We, therefore, made such an agreement as was necessary for the purpose, and entered into a treaty with him to satisfy his demands. When all things were prepared, and the evening of the event was appointed, Omichund informed Mr Watts, who was at the court of the nawab, that he insisted upon thirty lacks of rupees, and five per cent. upon all the treasure that should be found; that, unless that was immediately complied with, he would disclose the whole to the nawab; and that Mr. Watts, and the two other English gentlemen then at the court, should be cut off before the morning. Mr Watts, immediately on this information, dispatched an express to me at the council. I did not hesitate to find out a stratagem to save the lives of these people, and secure success to the intended event. For this purpose, we signed another treaty. The one was called the &quot;Red&quot;, the other the &quot;White&quot; treaty. This treaty was signed by everyone, except admiral Watson; and I should have considered myself sufficiently authorised to put his name to it, by the conversation I had with him. As to the person who signed Admiral Watson&#x27;s name to the treaty, whether he did it in his presence or not, I cannot say; but this I know, that he thought he had sufficient authority for so doing. This treaty was immediately sent to Omichund, who did not suspect the stratagem. The event took place, and success attended it; and the House, I am fully persuaded, will agree with me, that, when the very existence of the company was at stake, and the lives of these people so precariously situated, and so certain of being destroyed, it was a matter of true policy and of justice to deceive so great a villain.&quot;

===Battle of Plassey===


The Battle of Plassey (or Palashi) is widely considered the turning point in the history of the subcontinent, marking the start of British rule in India. After Siraj-ud-Daulah&#x27;s conquest of Calcutta, Clive took fresh troops from Madras to recapture the fort and avenge the attack. A retreating Siraj-ud-Daulah met the British at Plassey. He had to make camp 27 miles away from Murshidabad. On 23 June 1757 Siraj-ud-Daulah called on Mir Jafar because he was saddened by the sudden fall of Mir Mardan who was a very dear companion of Siraj in battles. The Nawab asked for help from Mir Jafar. Mir Jafar advised Siraj to retreat for that day. The Nawab made the blunder in giving the order to stop the fight. Following his command, the soldiers of the Nawab were returning to their camps. At that time, Robert Clive attacked the soldiers with his army. At such a sudden attack, the army of Siraj became undisciplined and could think of no way to fight. Much of the army retreated. Betrayed by a conspiracy plotted by Jagat Seth, Mir Jafar, Krishna Chandra, Omichund, etc., Siraj lost the battle and had to escape. He rode away and went first to Murshidabad, specifically to Heerajheel or Motijheel, his palace at Mansurganj. He ordered his principal commanders to engage their troops for his safety, but as he was bereft of power due to the loss at Plassey, they were reluctant to offer unquestioning support. Some advised him to deliver himself up to the English, but Siraj equated this with treachery. Others proposed he should encourage the army with greater rewards, and this he seemed to approve of. Yet the numbers in his retinue were considerably diminished. Soon he dispatched most of the women of his harem to Purneah, under the protection of Mohanlal, with gold and elephants. Then, with his principal consort Lutf-un-Nisa and very few attendants, Siraj began his escape towards Patna by boat, but was eventually arrested by Mir Jafar&#x27;s soldiers.

==Death==
Siraj-ud-Daulah was executed on 2 July 1757 by Mohammad Ali Beg under orders from Mir Miran, son of Mir Jafar in Namak Haram Deorhi as part of the agreement between Mir Jafar and the British East India Company.

Siraj-ud-Daulah&#x27;s tomb is located at Khushbagh, Murshidabad. It is marked with a simple but elegant one-storied mausoleum, surrounded by gardens.

==Critics==
Siraj ud-Daulah has gained a positive reputation in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan for his opposition to the beginning of British rule over India.

In 1985, Sarkar wrote:
After the death of Alivardii Khan, his immature grandson became the nawab of Bengal, taking the name Miirza Mohammed Siraj-Ud-Daola. In addition to his young age, he had many kinds of defects in his character and conduct.

Historian Sushil Chaudhary argued that Siraj ud-Daula’s villainous character is a misrepresentation.

===Legacy===
The end of Siraj ud-Daulah&#x27;s reign also ended Bengali autonomy and marked the beginning of British power in India. In the Bengali version of the end of his rule, Mir Jafar and Robert Clive are the villains and Siraj is the victim. Even though he is rarely if ever depicted as an attractive person, he is regarded as having been sinned against, rather than as a sinner. As the movement for Indian independence gathered strength, Siraj along with Tipu Sultan and the heroes of the First War of Indian Independence including the last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah II, gained iconic status as people who resisted the imperial aggression.

Chayamanab (2022) by Soumen Jana is a Bengali novel based on Siraj ud-Daulah&#x27;s life.

<text>William Robertson Warren (October 9, 1879 – December 31, 1927) was a Newfoundland lawyer, politician and judge who served as the dominion&#x27;s Prime Minister from July 1923 to April 1924.

==Early life==
His parents were William Matthew Henry Warren, a surveyor, and Jessie Sophia Warren. He had at least one sibling, a sister, Alice Mary Warren (died 1930), who was married to Robert Brown Job, President of Job Brothers &amp; Co., Limited.

He received his education at Bishop Feild College, St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Framlingham College, in England. After studying law, Warren was admitted as a solicitor in 1901

==Career==
Warren was first elected to the Newfoundland House of Assembly in 1903 as a Liberal and served as Speaker of the House from 1909-1914. In 1919 he became minister of justice in the Cabinet of Sir Richard Squires. The Squires government became embroiled in a scandal over allegations of corruption and misspending of government funds and Warren resigned in protest along with three other ministers in 1923. The next year Squires was forced to resign and Warren was chosen the party&#x27;s new leader and prime minister. His government launched a formal inquiry into the corruption charges which resulted in the arrest and conviction of Squires and several others. Warren&#x27;s supporters turned against him and moved a Motion of No Confidence that defeated his government. Warren moved to the opposition benches and formed a coalition with Tory William J. Higgins to form the new &quot;Liberal-Conservative Progressive Party&quot; that won the election a few weeks later making the conservative Walter Stanley Monroe the new prime minister.

In 1926, Warren resigned from the House of Assembly and was appointed to the colony&#x27;s Supreme Court.

==Personal life==
He was married first to Ethel Alice Gordon, by whom he had one son, John Henry Warren, and two daughters. He was married secondly to Emilie Jackson (died 1934) by whom he had one daughter.

Warren died in 1927.

<text>Mark-Paul Harry Gosselaar (; born March 1, 1974) is an American actor. He is best known for playing Zack Morris in the NBC series &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;. In 1991, he won a Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor Starring in an Off-Primetime Series.

He also played Paul Johnson in the ABC sitcom series &quot;Mixed-ish&quot;, Detective John Clark Jr. in &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, and Peter Bash in the TNT legal series &quot;Franklin &amp; Bash&quot;. He was also the lead in the 1998 film &quot;Dead Man on Campus&quot;. He later starred in the Fox TV series &quot;Pitch&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Passage&quot; (2019). He reprised the role of Zack Morris in a recurring capacity for the Peacock sequel series &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; (2020) and stars in the NBC procedural drama &quot;Found&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Gosselaar was born in Panorama City, Los Angeles, the son of Paula ( van den Brink), a homemaker and hostess for KLM, and Hans Gosselaar, a plant supervisor for Anheuser-Busch. He is the youngest of his parents&#x27; four children, and was the only one not born in the Netherlands.

His Dutch-born father is of German and Dutch Jewish descent. Gosselaar&#x27;s Jewish paternal great-grandparents, Hartog and Hester Gosselaar, were murdered at the Sobibor extermination camp during the Holocaust. His Dutch-Indonesian mother, who was born in Bali, Indonesia, was a flight attendant for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.

Gosselaar has described himself as &quot;half-Asian,” and mentioned collecting things from Indonesia.

Gosselaar speaks Dutch, and was fluent for a time, at home. His parents later separated.

Gosselaar&#x27;s mother was his manager. He began modeling at the age of five, and as a child, he also appeared in commercials for Cookie Crisp cereal and Smurf merchandise, later winning guest spots on television series. He spent his teenage years in the Santa Clarita Valley in Southern California, where he attended Hart High School.

Gosselaar has said that his natural hair color is brown, but he was &quot;blondish&quot; as a kid. His hair was dyed blond throughout his run on &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;.

==Career==
Gosselaar first came to public notice as the star of the hit television comedy series &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, which aired on NBC from 1989 to 1993. His character, Zack Morris, was adapted from the short-lived Disney Channel sitcom &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot;; although that show was cancelled after one season, NBC executives believed that a similar show, with Zack Morris as the lead, had potential for success. He reprised the role in two TV movies and a less-successful spin-off, &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot;. In 1994, he appeared as Zack Morris in a second spin-off series &quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot; in the episode &quot;Goodbye, Bayside – Part 2&quot;, along with Mario López as A.C. Slater and Lark Voorhies as Lisa Turtle.

In 1996, he appeared in the TV-film &quot;She Cried No&quot;, as a college student who date-rapes his best friend&#x27;s sister at a fraternity party. In 1998, he starred in the feature film &quot;Dead Man on Campus&quot;. Later that same year, Gosselaar played the central character in the TV drama &quot;Hyperion Bay&quot;, which lasted 17 episodes. In 2001, he starred in the movie &quot;The Princess and the Marine&quot;, with Marisol Nichols. He also starred in the short-lived WB series &quot;D.C.&quot; From 2001 to 2005, he played Detective John Clark on ABC&#x27;s &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. During his time on the show, he appeared in &quot;Atomic Twister&quot; in which he played Jake Hannah, a deputy who is traumatized over his mother&#x27;s death and must help after a series of tornadoes hits a nuclear power plant in a small Tennessee town; the movie also stars fellow &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; alum Sharon Lawrence, who plays Corrine Maguire. After the series ended, he joined the cast of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Commander in Chief&quot;, which lasted only one season. He appeared on the HBO series &quot;John from Cincinnati&quot;. He then gained the starring role of defense attorney Jerry Kellerman in the Steven Bochco-produced &quot;Raising the Bar&quot;, which debuted on September 1, 2008, on TNT, then it was canceled in November 2009 after two seasons.
On June 8, 2009, Gosselaar appeared on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; in character as Zack Morris to promote his show &quot;Raising the Bar&quot;, indicating that the name Mark-Paul Gosselaar is his stage name and declaring, as Zack, that he would participate in a &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; &quot;Class&quot; reunion that is being spearheaded by Fallon. On February 4, 2015, Gosselaar reunited with Mario Lopez, Elizabeth Berkley, Dennis Haskins and Tiffani Thiessen on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, where they appeared in a &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; sketch with Fallon.

In October 2009, he made his off-Broadway stage debut in Theresa Rebeck&#x27;s play &quot;The Understudy&quot; with The Roundabout Theatre Company. The show extended its limited New York run until January 17, 2010.

Gosselaar began filming the TNT series &quot;Franklin &amp; Bash&quot; on March 28, 2010. The series premiered on June 1, 2011. On November 11, 2014, it was announced that the series was canceled, after four seasons. The FOX series &quot;Pitch&quot; cast Gosselaar in the main role of Mike Lawson, star catcher and team captain, in February 2016, and premiered on September 22, 2016. On May 1, 2017, it was announced that the series was canceled, after one season. He appeared in two episodes of Tiffani Thiessen&#x27;s cooking show, &quot;Dinner at Tiffani&#x27;s&quot;.

In 2019, Gosselaar began playing the lead role of Paul Jackson (Rainbow&#x27;s father) in ABC comedy series &quot;Mixed-ish&quot; (spin-off and prequel series of &quot;Black-ish&quot;). He took over the role from Anders Holm, who played the character in the pilot episode. Gosselaar also reprised his role as Zack Morris in the 2020 sequel series &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;.

==Personal life==
In a July 2009 interview with &quot;People&quot;, Gosselaar revealed that while &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; was in production, he dated, at different times, his three female co-stars: Lark Voorhies, Tiffani Thiessen, and Elizabeth Berkley. He remains friends with his &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; cast mates.

In 1996, Gosselaar married former model Lisa Ann Russell. Together, they have two children: a son (b. 2004), and daughter (b. 2006). After 14 years of marriage, Gosselaar and Russell announced their separation in early June 2010. Gosselaar filed for divorce June 18, 2010, and it became final in May 2011.

Gosselaar was engaged to advertising executive Catriona McGinn in August 2011. They married July 28, 2012, at the Sunstone winery in Santa Ynez, California. They have a son (b. 2013), and a daughter (b. 2015).

Gosselaar is a sports car enthusiast, race car driver, track cyclist, dirt biker, and pilot. In 2005, he competed in the Far West Championships for track cycling. He won the Category 4/5 Sprint Championship event at the Encino Velodrome. He is a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu brown belt under Rafael Ramos and Nelson Montiero.

Gosselaar resides in Los Angeles. He sold his Sherman Oaks home in February 2022.

<text>It is generally recognized that the first radio transmission was made from a temporary station set up by Guglielmo Marconi in 1895 on the Isle of Wight. This followed on from pioneering work in the field by a number of people including Alessandro Volta, André-Marie Ampère, Georg Ohm, James Clerk Maxwell and Heinrich Rudolf Hertz.

The radio broadcasting of music and talk intended to reach a dispersed audience started experimentally around 1905–1906, and commercially around 1920 to 1923. VHF (very high frequency) stations started 30 to 35 years later.
In the early days, radio stations broadcast on the longwave, mediumwave and shortwave bands, and later on VHF (very high frequency) and UHF (ultra high frequency). However, in the United Kingdom, Hungary, France and some other places, from as early as 1890 there was already a system whereby news, music, live theatre, music hall, fiction readings, religious broadcasts, etc., were available in private homes [and other places] via the conventional telephone line, with subscribers being supplied with a number of special, personalised headsets. In Britain this system was known as Electrophone, and was available as early as 1895 or 1899 [sources vary] and up until 1926. In Hungary, it was called Telefon Hírmondó [1893-1920s], and in France, Théâtrophone [1890-1932]).

By the 1950s, virtually every country had a broadcasting system, typically one owned and operated by the government. Alternative modes included commercial radio, as in the United States; or a dual system with both state sponsored and commercial stations, introduced in Australia as early as 1924, with Canada following in 1932. Today, most countries have evolved into a dual system, including the UK. By 1955, practically every family in North America and Western Europe, as well as Japan, had a radio. A dramatic change came in the 1960s with the introduction of small inexpensive portable transistor radios which greatly expanded ownership and usage. Access became practically universal around the world.

== Early broadcasting ==
=== Australia ===
==== Formative years ====
Australian radio hams can be traced to the early 1900s. The 1905 &quot;Wireless Telegraphy Act&quot; whilst acknowledging the existence of wireless telegraphy, brought all broadcasting matters in Australia under the control of the Federal Government. In 1906, the first official Morse code transmission in Australia was by the Marconi Company between Queenscliff, Victoria and Devonport, Tasmania.

==== Experiments with broadcasting music ====
The first broadcast of music was made during a demonstration on 13 August 1919 by Ernest Fisk (later Sir Ernest) of AWA – Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia). A number of amateurs commenced broadcasting music in 1920 and 1921. Many other amateurs soon followed. 2CM was run by Charles MacLuran who started the station in 1921 with regular Sunday evening broadcasts from the Wentworth Hotel, Sydney. 2CM is often regarded as Australia&#x27;s first, regular, non-official station.

==== Sealed set system ====
It was not until November 1923 when the government finally gave its approval for a number of officially recognised medium wave stations.
All stations operated under a unique Sealed Set system under which each set was sealed to the frequency of one station. Part of the price of the set went to the government via the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department (PMG), with money also going to the broadcaster. Apart from extremely limited advertising, this was the broadcasters&#x27; only source of income. From the outset problems with the system came to the fore. Many young people built their own sets, which could receive all the stations.

==== Categories in Australia from 1924 ====
As quickly as July 1924, the Sealed Set system was declared to be unsuccessful and it was replaced by a system of A Class and B Class stations. There were one or two A Class stations in each major market and these were paid for by a listener&#x27;s licence fee imposed on all listeners-in. The five former sealed set stations became A Class stations, and they were soon joined by stations in other State capitals.

Amateur broadcasters continued to operate in the long wave and short wave bands.

A national service, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, was formed in July 1932, when the Australian Broadcasting Company&#x27;s contract expired.

==== Early experiments with television ====
As early as 1929, two Melbourne commercial radio stations, 3UZ and 3DB were conducting experimental mechanical television broadcasts – these were conducted in the early hours of the morning, after the stations had officially closed down. In 1934 Valentine McDowall conducted experiments in electronic television. at amateur station 4CM Brisbane

==== Mobile stations ====
Two of Australia&#x27;s most unusual medium wave stations were mobile stations 2XT and 3YB. They both operated in eras prior to the universal establishment of rural radio stations. 2XT was designed and operated by AWA within the State of New South Wales, from a NSW Railways train, between November 1925 and December 1927. 2XT, which stood for &quot;experimental train&quot;, visited over 100 rural centres. Engineers would set up a transmitting aerial and the station would then begin broadcasting. This led to the further sales of AWA products. 3YB provided a similar service in rural Victoria between October 1931 and November 1935. Initially, the station operated from a Ford car and a Ford truck, but from 17 October 1932 they operated from a converted 1899 former Royal Train carriage. Whilst the engineers were setting up the station&#x27;s 50-watt transmitter in the town being visited, salesmen would sign up advertisers for the fortnight that 3YB would broadcast from that region. The station was on the air from 6.00 and 10.00 pm daily, and its 1,000-record library was divided into set four-hour programs, one for each of 14 days. In other words, the music broadcast from each town was identical. The station was operated by Vic Dinenny, but named after announcer Jack Young from Ballarat. On 18 January 1936, Dinenny set up 3YB Warrnambool, followed on 18 May 1937 by 3UL Warragul.

The merchant vessel MV &quot;Kanimbla&quot; is believed to be the world&#x27;s only ship built with an inbuilt broadcasting station. The Kanimbla was constructed in Northern Ireland in 1936 and was primarily designed for McIlwraith, McEacharn &amp; Co to ply passengers between Cairns and Fremantle. The broadcasting station was constructed and operated by AWA and was initially given the ham radio callsign VK9MI but was later 9MI. (At this time, the &quot;9&quot; in the callsign was aberrationary [see &quot;Call Signs, above].) The station made an experimental broadcast before leaving Northern Ireland, and a number of such broadcasts at sea, on the way to Australia. 9MI&#x27;s first official broadcast in April 1939 was made from the Great Australian Bight. The station broadcast on short wave, usually a couple of times per week, but many of its programs were relayed to commercial medium wave stations that were also owned by AWA. The 9MI manager and announcer (and probably the only member of staff) was Eileen Foley. 9MI ceased broadcasting at the commencement of World War II in September 1939. The Kanimbla was commissioned as a Royal Navy (later Royal Australian Navy) vessel with the name HMS/HMAS Kanimbla. It had an extremely prominent and successful war-time career.

=== Canada ===

The history of broadcasting in Canada begins as early as 1919 with the first experimental broadcast programs in Montreal. The Canadians were swept up in the radio craze and built crystal sets to listen to American stations while The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada offered its first commercially produced radio-broadcast receiver (Model &quot;C&quot;) in 1921, followed by its &quot;Marconiphone&quot; Model I in 1923. Main themes in the history include the development of the engineering technology; the construction of stations across the country and the building of networks; the widespread purchase and use of radio and television sets by the general public; debates regarding state versus private ownership of stations; financing of the broadcasts media through the government, license fees, and advertising; the changing content of the programming; the impact of the programming on Canadian identity; the media&#x27;s influence on shaping audience responses to music, sports and politics; the role of the Québec government; Francophone versus Anglophone cultural tastes; the role of other ethnic groups and First Nations; fears of American cultural imperialism via the airwaves; and the impact of the Internet and smartphones on traditional broadcasting media.

Radio signals carried long distances, and a number of American stations could easily be received in parts of Canada. The first Canadian station was CFCF, originally an experimental station from the Marconi Company in Montreal. Civilian use of Wireless Telegraphy had been forbidden in Canada for the duration of World War I. The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada was the only one to retain the right to continue radio experiments for military use. This proved instrumental in giving the company a lead in developing an experimental radio broadcasting station immediately after the war. The first radio broadcast in Canada was accomplished by The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada in Montreal on December 1, 1919 under the call sign XWA (for &quot;Experimental Wireless Apparatus&quot;) from its Williams Street factory. The station began regular programming on May 20, 1920 and its call letters were changed to CFCF on November 4, 1920. In Toronto, the first radio station was operated by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper. Station CKCE began in April 1922 and was so well received that the Star pushed forward with its own studios and transmitting facilities, returning to the air as CFCA in late June 1922. In Montreal, another newspaper, &quot;La Presse&quot;, put its own station, CKAC on the air in late September 1922. Because there were governmental limitations on radio frequencies back then, CKAC and CFCF alternated—one would broadcast one night, and the other would broadcast the night after that.

As radio grew in popularity during the mid-1920s, a problem arose: the U.S. stations dominated the airwaves and with a limited number of frequencies available for broadcasters to use, it was the American stations that seemed to get most of them. This was despite an agreement with the US Department of Commerce (which supervised broadcasting in the years prior to the Federal Radio Commission) that a certain number of frequencies were reserved exclusively for Canadian signals. But if a US station wanted one of those frequencies, the Department of Commerce seemed unwilling to stop it, much to the frustration of Canadian owners who wanted to put stations on the air. The Canadian government and the US government began negotiations in late 1926, in hopes of finding a satisfactory solution. Meanwhile, in 1928, Canada got its first network, operated by the Canadian National Railways. CNR had already made itself known in radio since 1923, thanks in large part to the leadership of CNR&#x27;s president, Sir Henry Thornton. The company began equipping its trains with radio receivers, and allowed passengers to hear radio stations from Canada and the US. In 1924, CN began building its own stations, and by 1928, it was able to create a network.

=== Cuba ===
There was interest in radio almost from broadcasting&#x27;s earliest days. Due to the proximity of Cuba to the U.S. state of Florida, some Cubans would try to listen to the American stations whose signals reached the island. But there was no radio station in Cuba until 1922. The arrival of the first radio station, PWX, was greeted with enthusiasm. PWX, owned by the Cuban Telephone Company, was located in Havana. It was a joint venture with the International Telephone and Telegraph Company of New York. PWX debuted on the air on October 10, 1922. PWX broadcast programs in both English and Spanish, and its signal was easily received at night in a number of American cities. Another early station in Cuba was owned by Frank Jones, an American amateur radio operator and Chief Engineer of the Tuinucu Sugar Company. The station used amateur call letters, and went on the air as 6KW. In late 1928, PWX began using the call letters CMC. Its slogan was &quot;If you hear &#x27;La Paloma,&#x27; you are in tune with CMC.&quot; As with many other countries, interest in radio expanded, and by 1932, Cuba had more than thirty stations, spread out in cities all over the island.

=== France ===

Radio Paris began operations in 1922, followed by Radio Toulouse and Radio Lyon. Before 1940, 14 commercial and 12 public sector radio stations were in operation. The government exerted tight control over radio broadcasting. Political debate was discouraged; for example, in the 1932 election campaign, the opposition was allowed one broadcast while the incumbent made numerous campaign broadcasts. France lagged behind other European countries in consumer ownership of radio sets, with 5 million radio receivers in 1937, compared to over 8 million in both Britain and Germany and 26 million in the United States. The government imposed very strict controls on the dissemination of news. After 1938, stations were allowed only three brief bulletins of seven minutes each per day to cover the day&#x27;s news. The Prime Minister&#x27;s office closely supervised the news items that were to be broadcast. Due to these policies, French citizens learned little or nothing of the events surrounding the lead-up to World War II from the radio. As a result, the French population was often puzzled about the specifics of current events, and their morale and support for government policies was much weaker than in Britain, where news broadcasts were used to communicate regularly with citizens.

=== Germany ===

Ferdinand Braun&#x27;s major contributions were the introduction of a closed tuned circuit in the generating part of the transmitter, and its separation from the radiating part (the antenna) by means of inductive coupling, and later on the usage of crystals for receiving purposes. Braun experimented at first at the University of Strasbourg. Braun had written extensively on wireless subjects and was well known through his many contributions to the Electrician and other scientific journals. In 1899, he would apply for the patents, &quot;Electro telegraphy by means of condensers and induction coils&quot; and &quot;Wireless electro transmission of signals over surfaces&quot;. Braun invented the phased array antenna, which led to the development of radar, smart antennas, and MIMO, in 1905 and shared the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Marconi &quot;for their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy&quot;.
The first civilian radio broadcast in Germany was a Christmas concert on December 22, 1920. While its reception was confirmed from all over Europe, reception in Germany was still a punishable offense, as a result of the Treaty of Versailles.

The first radio station in Germany went on the air in Berlin in late 1923, using the call letters &quot;LP.&quot; Before 1933, German radio broadcasting was conducted by 10 regional broadcasting monopolies, each of which had a government representative on its board. The Post Office provided overall supervision. A listening fee of per receiver paid most costs, and radio station frequencies were limited, which restricted the number of amateur radio operators. Immediately following Hitler&#x27;s assumption of power in 1933, Joseph Goebbels became head of the Ministry for Propaganda and Public Enlightenment and took full control of regulating and overseeing broadcasting. Non-Nazis were removed from broadcasting and editorial positions, and Jews were fired from all positions.

Germany was easily served by a number of European mediumwave stations, including the BBC, but the Nazis made it illegal for Germans to listen to foreign broadcasts. During the war, German stations broadcast war propaganda and entertainment for German forces dispersed through Europe, as well as air raid alerts. There was heavy use of short wave for &quot;Germany Calling&quot; programmes directed at Britain and Allied forces around the world. Goebbels also set up numerous Nazi stations that pretended to be from the Allied world.

=== Japan ===
The first radio station in Japan was JOAK, which opened in Tokyo in March 1925. It was founded by Masajiro Kotamura, an inventor and engineer. It was unique in that at least one of its announcers was a woman, Akiko Midorikawa. JOAK was followed soon after by JOBK in Osaka and JOCK in Nagoya. The National Broadcasting Service, today known as NHK (Nippon Hoso Kyokai), began in August 1926. All stations were supported by licensing fees: in 1926, for example, people wishing to receive a permit to own a radio set paid a fee of one yen a month to the government. Programming on Japanese stations of the 1920s included music, news, language instruction (lessons were offered in English, French and German) and education talks. These early stations broadcast on average about eight hours of programs a day.

=== Mexico ===
Amateur radio was very popular in Mexico; while most of the hams were male, notably Constantino de Tarnava, acknowledged in some sources as Mexico&#x27;s first amateur radio operator, one of the early ham radio operators was female—Maria Dolores Estrada. But commercial radio broadcasting was difficult to achieve, due to a federal regulation forbidding any broadcasts that were not for the benefit of the Mexican government. Still, in November 1923, CYL in Mexico City went on the air, featuring music (both folk songs and popular dance concerts), religious services, and news. CYL used as its slogans &quot;El Universal&quot; and &quot;La Casa del Radio&quot;, and it won over the government by giving political candidates the opportunity to use the station to campaign. Its signal was so powerful that it could sometimes be received in Canada. Pressure from listeners and potential station owners also contributed to the government relenting and allowing more stations to go on the air. In 1931, the &quot;C&quot; call letters were all changed to &quot;X&quot; call letters (XE being reserved for broadcasting), and by 1932, Mexico had nearly forty radio stations, ten of which were in Mexico City.

=== Philippines ===
Interest in amateur radio was noted in the Philippines in the early 1920s. There were radio stations operating in the Philippines, including one owned by American businessman named Henry Hermann, as early as 1922, according to some sources; not much documentation about that period of time exists. In the autumn of 1927, KZRM in Manila, owned by the Radio Corporation of the Philippines, went on the air. The Radio Corporation of the Philippines was a subsidiary of American company RCA (Radio Corporation of America). By 1932, the island had three radio stations: KRZC in Cebu, as well as KZIB (owned by a department store) and KZFM, the government-owned station in Manila. Of the stations listed by Pierre Key, KZFM was the strongest, with 50,000 watts. Two radio networks were ultimately created: one, the Manila Broadcasting Company, began as a single station, KZRH in Manila, in July 1939, and after World War II, in 1946, the station&#x27;s owners began to develop their network by buying other radio properties. As for the Philippine Broadcasting Company, it too began with one station (KZFM), and received its new name in mid-1946, after the Philippines became an independent country. At the end of 1946, the new network had six stations. Both KZRH and KZFM also affiliated with American networks; the stations wanted to have access to certain popular American programs, and the American networks wanted to sell products in the Philippines.

=== Sri Lanka ===
Sri Lanka has the oldest radio station in Asia and the second oldest in the world, known as Radio Ceylon. It is now known as the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. Sri Lanka created broadcasting history in Asia when broadcasting was started in Ceylon by the Telegraph Department in 1923 on an experimental footing, just three years after the inauguration of broadcasting in Europe. Gramophone music was broadcast from a tiny room in the Central Telegraph Office with the aid of a small transmitter built by Telegraph Department engineers using the radio equipment of a captured German submarine.

=== United Kingdom===

The first experimental music broadcasts, from Marconi&#x27;s factory in Chelmsford, began in 1920. Two years later, in October 1922, a consortium of radio manufacturers formed the British Broadcasting Company (BBC); they allowed some sponsored programs, although they were not what we would today consider a fully commercial station. Meanwhile, the first radio stations in England were experimental station 2MT, located near Chelmsford, and station 2LO in London: both were operated by the Marconi Company. By late 1923, there were six stations broadcasting regularly in the United Kingdom: London&#x27;s 2LO, Manchester&#x27;s 2ZY, and stations in Birmingham (5IT), Cardiff, Newcastle, and Glasgow. As for the consortium of radio manufacturers, it dissolved in 1926, when its license expired; it then became the British Broadcasting Corporation, a non-commercial organization. Its governors are appointed by the British government, but they do not answer to it. Lord Reith took a formative role in developing the BBC, especially in radio.

=== United States ===
Reginald Fessenden did ground-breaking experiments with voice and music by 1906. Charles &quot;Doc&quot; Herrold of San Jose, California sent out broadcasts as early as April 1909 from his Herrold School electronics institute in downtown San Jose, using the identification &quot;San Jose Calling&quot;, and then a variety of different call signs as the Department of Commerce began to regulate radio. He was on the air daily for nearly a decade when the World War interrupted operations.

Pioneer radio station 2XG, also known as the &quot;Highbridge station&quot;, was an experimental station located in New York City and licensed to the DeForest Radio Telephone and Telegraph Company. It was the first station to use a vacuum tube transmitter to make radio broadcasts on a regular schedule. From 1912 to 1917 Charles Herrold made regular broadcasts, but used an arc transmitter. He switched to a vacuum tube transmitter when he restarted broadcasting activities in 1921. Herrold coined the terms broadcasting and narrowcasting. Herrold claimed the invention of broadcasting to a wide audience, through the use of antennas designed to radiate signals in all directions. David Sarnoff has been considered by many as &quot;the prescient prophet of broadcasting who predicted the medium&#x27;s rise in 1915&quot;, referring to his radio music box concept.
A few organizations were allowed to keep working on radio during the war. Westinghouse was the most well-known of these. Frank Conrad, a Westinghouse engineer, had been making transmissions from 8XK since 1916 that included music programming. A team at the University of Wisconsin–Madison headed by Professor Earle M. Terry was also on the air.

====1920s====
By 1919, after the war, radio pioneers across the country resumed transmissions. The early stations gained new call signs. A few early stations, notably 8MK (later known as WWJ in Detroit) were started by newspapers, but in those early years, radio and newspapers regarded each other as competitors. One early station, 8XK in Pittsburgh, became KDKA in 1920; its ownership has asserted that it was the first radio station in the US, but that claim is controversial 

Madison Avenue early on recognized the importance of radio as a new advertising medium. Advertising provided the major funding for most stations. The United States never had a licensing fee for set users.

Radio in education began as early as April 1922, when Medford Hillside&#x27;s WGI Radio broadcast the first of an ongoing series of educational lectures from Tufts College professors. These lectures were described by the press as a sort of &quot;wireless college.&quot; Soon, other colleges across the U.S. began adding radio broadcasting courses to their curricula; some, like the University of Iowa, even provided what today would be known as distance-learning credits. Curry College, first in Boston and then in Milton, Massachusetts, introduced one of the nation&#x27;s first broadcasting majors in 1932 when the college teamed up with WLOE in Boston to have students broadcast programs. This success led to numerous radio courses in the curriculum which has taught thousands of radio broadcasters from the 1930s to today.

By 1931, a majority of U.S. households owned at least one radio receiver. In 1934, several independent stations formed the Mutual Broadcasting System to exchange syndicated programming, including &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; and &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;. Prior to 1927, U.S. radio was supervised by the Department of Commerce. Then, the Radio Act of 1927 created the Federal Radio Commission (FRC); in 1934, this agency became known as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). A Federal Communications Commission decision in 1939 required NBC to divest itself of its Blue Network. That decision was sustained by the Supreme Court in a 1943 decision, National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, which established the framework that the &quot;scarcity&quot; of radio-frequency meant that broadcasting was subject to greater regulation than other media. This Blue Network network became the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Around 1946, ABC, NBC, and CBS began regular television broadcasts. Another TV network, the DuMont Television Network, was founded earlier, but was disbanded in 1956; later in 1986 the surviving DuMont independent stations formed the nucleus of the new Fox Broadcasting Company.

== 1950s and 1960s ==
=== Australia ===
Norman Banks was one of Melbourne&#x27;s (and Australia&#x27;s) most prominent broadcasters at 3KZ (1930-1952) and 3AW (1952-1978). He is remembered for founding Carols by Candlelight, as a pioneer football commentator, and for hosting both musical and interview programs. In later years he was one of Melbourne&#x27;s first and most prominent talk back hosts. At the commencement of his career, Banks was known for his double entendres and risque remarks; as a talk back host he was outspoken in his conservative views, especially regarding the White Australia policy and Apartheid. In 1978 his 47-year career in radio was hailed as the longest in world history.
The transistor radio first appeared on the market in 1954. In particular, it made portable radios even more transportable. All sets quickly became smaller, cheaper and more convenient. The aim of radio manufacturers became a radio in every room, in the car, and in the pocket. The upshot of these two changes was that stations started to specialise and concentrate on specific markets. The first areas to see specialised stations were the news and current affairs market, and stations specialising in pop music and geared toward the younger listener who was now able to afford his/her own radio. Talk back (&quot;talk radio&quot;) became a major radio genre by the end of the 1960s, but it was not legalised in Australia until October 1967.

=== Germany ===
When the Federal Republic of Germany was organized in 1949, its Enabling Act established strong state government powers. Broadcasting was organized on a state, rather than a national, basis. Nine regional radio networks were established. A technical coordinating organization, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft der öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (ARD), came into being in 1950 to lessen technical conflicts. The Allied forces in Europe developed their own radio networks, including the U.S. American Forces Network (AFN). Inside Berlin, Radio in the American Sector (RIAS) became a key source of news in the German Democratic Republic.

=== Sri Lanka ===
Radio Ceylon was popular in the 1950s and 1960s in the Indian sub-continent. The station developed into the most popular radio network in South Asia. Millions of listeners in India for example tuned into Radio Ceylon. Announcers such as Livy Wijemanne, Vernon Corea, Pearl Ondaatje, Tim Horshington, Greg Roskowski, Jimmy Bharucha, Mil Sansoni, Eardley Peiris, Shirley Perera, Bob Harvie, Christopher Greet, Prosper Fernando, Ameen Sayani (of Binaca Geetmala fame),Karunaratne Abeysekera, S.P.Mylvaganam (the first Tamil announcer on the Commercial Service) were hugely popular across South Asia. The Hindi service helped build Radio Ceylon&#x27;s fanbase among Hindi speakers in the Indian sub-continent. Gopal Sharma, Sunil Dutt, Ameen Sayani, and Hamid Sayani were some of the Indian announcers of the station. The Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon was hugely successful under the leadership of Clifford Dodd, the Australian administrator and broadcasting expert who was sent to Ceylon under the Colombo Plan.

=== United States ===
By 1955, a majority of U.S. households owned at least one television set.

== 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s ==
=== Australia ===

=== Europe ===
Commercial radio (re-)legalisation in most European countries occurred in this era, starting with United Kingdom in 1973 (see Independent Local Radio) and ending with Austria in 1995.
In 1987, stations in the European Broadcasting Union began offering Radio Data System (RDS), which provides written text information about programs that were being broadcast, as well as traffic alerts, accurate time, and other teletext services.

== The 2000s ==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, from August 2009, digital radio was phased in by geographical region. Today, the ABC, SBS, commercial and community radio stations operate on the AM and FM bands. Most stations are available on the internet and most also have digital outlets. By 2007, there were 261 commercial stations in Australia.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In Sri Lanka in 2005, in a celebration of 80 years of history of broadcasting, the former Director-General of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, Eric Fernando, called for the station to take full advantage of the digital age – this included looking at the archives of Radio Ceylon. Ivan Corea asked the President of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapakse, to invest in the future of the SLBC.

<doc id="527028" wikidata="Q11761776" url="?curid=527028" title="List of frigate classes of the Royal Navy">
<text>This is a list of frigate classes of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom (and the individual ships composed within those classes) in chronological order from the formal creation of the Royal Navy following the Restoration in 1660. Where the word &#x27;class&#x27; or &#x27;group&#x27; is not shown, the vessel was a &#x27;one-off&#x27; design with just that vessel completed to the design. The list excludes vessels captured from other navies and added to the Royal Navy.

All frigates built for the Royal Navy up to 1877 (when the Admiralty re-categorised all frigates and corvettes as &quot;cruisers&quot;) are listed below. The term &quot;frigate&quot; was resuscitated in World War II and subsequent classes are listed at the end of this article, but the individual ships within those classes are not listed in this article.
==The frigate before 1660==

The initial meaning of frigate in English/British naval service was a fast sailing warship, usually with a relatively low superstructure and a high length:breadth ratio—as distinct from the heavily armed but slow &quot;great ships&quot; with high fore- and after-castles. The name originated at the end of the 16th century, the first &quot;frigats&quot; being generally small, fast-sailing craft, in particular those employed by Flemish privateers based on Dunkirk and Flushing. Subsequently, the term was applied to any vessel with these characteristics, even to a third-rate or fourth-rate ship of the line.

In this list, the term is restricted to fifth rates and sixth rates which did not form part of the battlefleet (i.e. were not ships of the line); many of the earliest ships described as English frigates, such as of 1645, were third-rate or fourth-rate ships of the line and thus are not listed below. As the Royal Navy was not officially created until 1660, vessels from the preceding (Commonwealth) era are only included where they survived past 1660. Prizes taken from enemy naval forces and added to the Royal Navy are also excluded.

===Fifth-rates before 1660===

Prior to 1626 when the rating system was established, these vessels were known as pinnaces. The vessels were considered too lightly armed and built to stand in the line of battle. Fifth rates were essentially two-decked vessels, with a demi-battery on the lower deck and a lesser number of guns of lesser power on the upper deck (as well as even smaller guns on the quarterdeck).
* 1651 Programme Group
** &quot;Pearl&quot;
** &quot;Mermaid&quot;
** &quot;Primrose&quot;
** &quot;Nightingale&quot;

===Sixth-rate frigates before 1660===

Sixth rates were single-decked vessels, with a battery on the (single) gun deck, and usually some lesser guns on the quarterdeck.
* Vessels of 1651 Programme:
** – launched 1652
** – launched 1652
** – launched 1652

==Frigates from 1660 to 1688==

===Fifth-rate frigates from 1660 to 1688===
&quot;Charles Galley&quot; was an early galley-frigate with a bank of sweeps above the waterline, the last of these types (&quot;Royal Anne Galley&quot;) being launched in 1709.

* Vessels of 1665 Programme:
** – launched 1665
** – launched 21 March 1666
** – launched 1666
*Vessels of 1668–1669 Programmes:
** – launched 22 December 1668
** – launched 31 March 1671
* Vessels of 1670s construction:
** – launched September 1674
** – launched 29 June 1675
** – 32 guns, launched 1676, rebuilt 1693, renamed HMS &quot;Torrington&quot; in 1729 after two further rebuilds

===Sixth-rate frigates from 1660 to 1688===
* Designed and built by Anthony Deane at Harwich
** – launched July 1666
** – launched 24 July 1666
** – launched 1666
* Designed and built by Anthony Deane at Portsmouth
** – launched 28 October 1669
** – launched July 1672
* Designed and built by Sir Anthony Deane at Blackwall
** – launched 11 June 1675

==Frigates from 1688 to 1719==

For ships before the 1745 Establishment, the term &#x27;class&#x27; is inappropriate as individual design was left up to the master shipwright in each Royal dockyard. For other vessels, the Surveyor of the Navy produced a common design for ships which were to be built under a commercial contract rather than in a Royal Dockyard. Consequently, the term &#x27;group&#x27; is used as more applicable for ships built to similar specifications (and to the same principal dimensions) but to varying designs.

===Fifth rates from 1688 to 1719===
*1689 Programme Group – 32-gun fifth rates 1689–1691
**
**
* ex-fourth rate rebuilt 1691 as a fifth rate – 40 guns
* purchased 1693 – 40 guns.

**HMS &quot;Garland&quot; 1703
**HMS &quot;Folkestone&quot; 1703
**HMS &quot;Roebuck&quot; 1704 (40 guns only)
**HMS &quot;Sorlings&quot; 1706
*1706 Establishment group – 42-gun fifth rates 1707–1715
*The Navy Board ordered sixteen of these vessels between 1705 and 1711 as 42-gun vessels. The remaining pair—&quot;Looe&quot; and &quot;Diamond&quot;—were not ordered but rather the Navy Board purchased them on the stocks from the shipbuilder who had commenced building them &quot;on spec&quot;. All the vessels were armed under the 1703 Guns Establishment with a main battery of nine-pounder guns. Under the 1716 Guns Establishment, a 40-gun ship with a main battery of 12-pounder guns superseded the 42-gun ship. Hence, the last six of the ships listed below were completed as 40-gun ships.

===Sixth-rate frigates from 1688 to 1719===

Before the &quot;true&quot; sail frigate came into being in the 1740s, the equivalent was the single-deck cruising vessel of the sixth rate, armed with either 20, 22 or 24 guns, which established itself in the 1690s and lasted until the arrival of the new &quot;true&quot; frigates. Before 1714, many small sixth rates carried fewer than 20 guns, and these have been excluded from this list. For over half a century from the 1690s, the main armament of this type was the 6-pounder gun, until it was replaced by nine-pounder guns just prior to being superseded by the 28-gun sixth-rate frigate.

==Frigates from 1719 to 1750==
For ships before the 1745 Establishment, the term &#x27;class&#x27; is inappropriate as individual design was left up to the master shipwright in each Royal dockyard. For other vessels, the Surveyor of the Navy produced a common design for ships which were to be built under a commercial contract rather than in a Royal Dockyard. Consequently, the term &#x27;group&#x27; is used as more applicable for ships built to similar specifications laid down in the Establishments but to varying designs. However, from 1739 almost all fifth and sixth rates were built under contract and were thus to a common class.

*Two nominally 24-gun ships – the &quot;Lyme&quot; and &quot;Unicorn&quot; – were built in 1747–1749 with 24 nine-pounders on the upper deck but also carried four smaller guns on the quarterdeck. There were no more guns on the lower deck that was lowered to the waterline; the pair were designated as 24-gun ships (disregarding the smaller guns) until 1756, when they were re-classed as 28-gun frigates. However other 24-gun and 20-gun ships continued to be built, with either 22- or 29-pounder guns on the upper deck.

==44-gun fifth rates from 1750 – by class==
Those fifth-rate ships were not frigates in a stricter sense, being two-deckers, but they were mostly used in the same way, e.g. convoy protection. In addition they were too small to sail in the line of battle. Thus they are listed here. In the middle of the 18th century, those ships had a more powerful armament than the frigates at that time (these were nine and 12-pounders equipped), that consisted of 18-pounders on the gun deck. Later in the century, with the advent of the 18-pounder frigate (the first British 18-pounder armed frigate, HMS &quot;Flora&quot; (36), was launched in 1780), those ships became obsolete and ceased to being built in 1787, when the last one, HMS &quot;Sheerness&quot;, was launched. Many continued to serve until after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, most of them as troop- or storeships.

==Sail frigates from 1750 – by class==

Following the success of the &quot;Lyme&quot; and &quot;Unicorn&quot; in 1748, the mid-century period saw the simultaneous introduction in 1756 both of sixth-rate frigates of 28 guns (with a main battery of 24 nine-pounder guns, plus four lesser guns mounted on the quarterdeck and/or forecastle) and of fifth-rate frigates of 32 or 36 guns (with a main battery of 26 12-pounder guns, plus six or ten lesser guns mounted on the quarterdeck and/or forecastle).

The American Revolution saw the emergence of new fifth rates of 36 or 38 guns which carried a main battery of 18-pounder guns, and were thus known as &quot;heavy&quot; frigates, while the French Revolutionary War brought about the introduction of a few 24-pounder gun armed frigates. In the 1830s, new types emerged with a main battery of 32-pounder guns.

===9-pounder armed post ships===
After 1750, the official Admiralty criteria for defining a frigate required a minimum battery of 28 carriage-mounted guns, including such guns which were mounted on the quarterdeck and forecastle. The Admiralty categorized the smaller sixth rates, of frigate-type construction, but carrying between 20 and 26 guns, as &quot;post ships&quot;, but seagoing officers often referred to then as &quot;frigates&quot; even though this was not officially recognised. The post ships, generally of 20 or 24 guns, were in practice the continuation of the earlier sixth rates. The Napoleonic War era post ships were later re-armed with (many being completed with) 32-pounder carronades instead of nine-pounder guns; after 1817 most of the survivors (except the &quot;Conway&quot; class), were re-classified as sloops.

===9-pounder armed frigates===

Although previously rated as 24-gun ships (when their four quarterdeck-mounted three-pounders were not included in the count), &quot;Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Lyme&quot; were redefined as 28-gun frigates from 1756. The &quot;Lowestoffe&quot; and &quot;Coventry&quot;-class frigates which followed were virtual copies of them, with slight improvements in design. Further 28-gun sixth rates, similarly armed with a main battery of 24 nine-pounder guns (and with four smaller carriage guns on the quarterdeck) continued to be built to evolving designs until the 1780s.

==19th century steam frigates==
During the 1840s, the introduction of steam propulsion was to radically change the nature of the frigate. Initial trials were with paddle-driven vessels, but these had numerous disadvantages, not least that the paddle wheels restricted the numbers of guns that could be mounted on the broadside. So the application of the screw propeller meant that a full broadside could still be carried, and a number of sail frigates were adapted, while during the 1850s the first frigates designed from the start to have screw propulsion were ordered. All these early steam vessels still carried a full rig of masts and sails, and steam power remained a means of assistance to these vessels.

In 1887 all frigates and corvettes in the British Navy were re-categorised as &#x27;cruisers&#x27;, and the term &#x27;frigate&#x27; was abolished, not to re-emerge until the Second World War, at which time it was resurrected to describe a totally different type of escort vessel.

===Paddle-driven frigates===

Although iron hulls were used for some warships in the 1840s, almost all the paddle frigates were wooden-hulled. The exception was the ill-fated &quot;Birkenhead&quot;.
* 1839–44 – second class, originally classed just as &#x27;steam vessels&#x27;, lengthened versions of sloop &quot;Gorgon&quot;

===Screw-driven frigates===
In the mid-1840s, the Admiralty ordered four iron-hulled, screw-driven frigates from specialist shipbuilders; however, the Admiralty then rapidly lost faith in the ability of iron hulls to stand up to combat conditions, and all four (&quot;Greenock&quot;, &quot;Vulcan&quot;, &quot;Megaera&quot; and &quot;Simoom&quot;) were converted while under construction into troop transports, although the &quot;Greenock&quot; was promptly sold for commercial use.

Following this unsuccessful experiment, though iron hulls were used for some warships in the 1840s, almost all the screw frigates below were wooden-hulled. The exceptions were the final three below – &quot;Inconstant&quot;, &quot;Shah&quot; and &quot;Raleigh&quot; – which had iron hulls.

<text>Amy Woodforde-Finden (1860 – 13 March 1919) was a composer who is best known for writing the music to &quot;Kashmiri Song&quot; from &quot;Four Indian Love Lyrics&quot; by Laurence Hope.

==Biography==
Amy Woodforde-Finden was born Amelia Rowe Ward in 1860 at Valparaíso, Chile, the youngest daughter of American parents, Alfred and Virginia Worthington Heath Ward. Alfred served as a US Consul after being recommended by Balie Peyton, US Ambassador to Chile under President Zachary Taylor. Her father died in 1867 and her mother moved the family to London, where Virginia became a naturalized British citizen in 1873. Around that time Amy displayed a skill for composition and became a student of Carl Schloesser and Amy Horrocks. Her early work, published as Amy Ward, though promising, was received only tepidly.

At the age of 34, she married Brigade-Surgeon Woodforde-Finden, who served during the Second Afghan War and Third Burmese War with the Bengal establishment of the Indian Medical Service; they lived in India for several years, and during her time there she wrote and published what would become her most famous pieces: &quot;The Lover in Damascus&quot; and &quot;Kashmiri Song&quot;. The latter was originally self-published in 1902 but because of its popularity and the influence of Hamilton Earle, it was eventually published by Boosey &amp; Co. The popularity of &quot;Kashmiri Song&quot; and &quot;The Lover in Damascus&quot; kept her in the good graces of her publishing house and in the hearts of her audience. Her songs are noted for their sentimentality, their romantic fluidity and how they blend a particularly British, middle-class sensibility with an Asian pastiche. In the years that followed the success of &quot;Kashmiri Song&quot;, she composed &quot;On Jhelum River&quot;, &quot;The Pagoda of Flowers&quot; and &quot;Stars of the Desert&quot;.
The year 1916 was a bitter-sweet one for Woodforde-Finden: she lost her husband in April, and her work was featured in the film &quot;Less Than the Dust&quot;. This was just the first of her work to be showcased in film. In 1943, &quot;Kashmiri Song&quot; would be used in the film &quot;Hers To Hold&quot;. She moved back to London after she lost her husband, and survived him by only three years, dying on 13 March 1919. It is said that she died composing at the piano. Amy is buried in Hampsthwaite churchyard in North Yorkshire, and her memorial is a recumbent figure in white marble.

The legacy Amy Woodforde-Finden leaves is one of bridging cultures with music and words. She interpreted the sounds and motives of Asian-South Asian music to an American-European audience and transported the listener to a world of romance and the exotic.

In 2022, the German composer and pianist Thomas Flessenkaemper founded the Amy Woodforde-Finden Music Festival at St Thomas à Becket Church in Hampsthwaite.

==Recordings==
&quot;Kashmiri Song&quot; and, to a lesser extent, &quot;Till I wake&quot; have been frequently recorded, including by tenor Richard Tauber with Percy Kahn at the piano. &quot;A Request&quot; was recorded in 1926 by Walter Widdop and Percy Kahn. There is a modern recording of &quot;Kashmiri Song&quot; by Trevor Alexander and Peter Crockford. Two complete sets of the &quot;Four Indian Love Lyrics&quot; were made by the English tenor Frank Titterton; and three by the Australian bass-baritone Peter Dawson, in 1923, 1925 and 1932.
