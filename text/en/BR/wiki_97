<text>was a Japanese navy officer in the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Meiji era. He was a planner of Battle of Tsushima in the Russo-Japanese War. General Akiyama Yoshifuru was his elder brother and politician Hisako Ōishi was his granddaughter.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Akiyama was born in Matsuyama Domain, Iyo Province, as a son of a poor &quot;samurai&quot;. As a youth, he studied literature, especially traditional &quot;waka&quot; poetry. The famous poet Masaoka Shiki was his friend from childhood. Later the two young men went to Tokyo to study literature and Akiyama began to prepare for entry into the Literature Department of Tokyo Imperial University. However, Akiyama was forced to abandon his study of letters as his elder brother Yoshifuru ordered him to go to Naval Academy in Tsukiji, Tokyo instead, largely due to the economically severe condition of the Akiyama family.

While Akiyama was a student, the Naval Academy moved to Etajima, in Hiroshima prefecture, and was renamed the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. Akiyama was an outstanding student, graduating on 17 July 1890 as a midshipman at the top of the 17th class, out of 88 cadets. He graduated just weeks after the publication of the first and last chapters of Alfred Thayer Mahan&#x27;s classic study, &quot;The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660–1783&quot; in its Japanese translation in July 1890.

Akiyama served his midshipman tour on the &quot;Hiei&quot; and cruiser . On commissioning as an ensign on 23 May 1892, he rose through the ranks in a variety of routine shipboard assignments and duties that included deployments throughout the Pacific Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and European waters. He was assigned to the &quot;Ryūjō&quot;. He subsequently served on the , , (during the Battle of Weihaiwei in the First Sino-Japanese War), and . Following the hostilities he served a tour at the Imperial Navy&#x27;s Torpedo school and then was assigned to naval intelligence, where he spent several months posing as a laborer and conducting missions in Manchuria and Korea.

===Studies in the United States===
After his promotion to lieutenant on 24 October 1896, Akiyama was sent to the United States as a naval attaché from 26 June 1897 to 27 December 1899. It was a time of heightened tension between Japan and the United States, due to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii by American marines and settlers, which nearly led to a rupture of diplomatic relations.

On Akiyama&#x27;s arrival in New York, he attempted to contact Alfred Thayer Mahan for advice and recommendations on how to study at either the US Naval Academy or Naval War College. Mahan was unwilling to help, aside from giving Akiyama a list of books to read. Akiyama then contacted the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt, but his pleas to be allowed to attend the Naval War College were refused.

Akiyama&#x27;s tour of duty coincided with the start of the Spanish–American War, and he joined the American fleet as a foreign military observer. He was able to watch American forces capture Santiago de Cuba in June 1898, and the blockade of Havana harbor in July. Akiyama submitted a lengthy report back to Japan on his observations, and noting problems in the blockade and landing operations. On conclusion of his tour, he served a short tour as a naval attaché with the Japanese Embassy in Washington D.C.

In February 1899, due to the efforts of the Japanese ambassador, Akiyama received permission to serve a six-month tour on board a US Navy warship, the , where he was able to observe American tactics and fleet operations in the North Atlantic and Caribbean firsthand. As a result of his service on board, Akiyama participated in several lectures at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. On completion of his studies in the United States, Akiyama traveled to England from 27 December 1899 to 20 May 1900.

===Instructor at the Navy War College===
On his return to Japan, Akiyama was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 October 1901 and assigned to various staff posts, and was the senior strategy instructor at Japan&#x27;s Naval War College from July 1902-November 1903. Akiyama initiated a curriculum reform using hypothetical situations to simulate the formulation of orders and development of realistic contingency plans. He also introduced the concepts of wargaming and tabletop map exercises, and developed theories for a new strategic and tactical doctrines for the Japanese Navy based upon his observations during the Spanish–American War. Akiyama focused on Russia as the primary threat to Japan in his lectures.

Akiyama was 34 years old, and was lecturing to officers who were of the same age, or in some cases his senior. Nonetheless, he achieved the respect of his peers due to his professional knowledge, expertise and personality.

===Russo-Japanese War===
With the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War Akiyama was promoted to commander on 1 September 1904. However, he remained on the planning staff and was a close confidant of Japanese Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet, Togo Heihachiro. Togo insisted that Akiyama accompany him on his battleship as a staff officer. Akiyama played a central role in the planning for the Battle of Port Arthur, the Battle of the Yellow Sea, the planning for the arrival of the Russian Baltic Fleet and its subsequent destruction in the Battle of Tsushima. The objective of the Japanese navy in the Battle of Tsushima was to destroy the Russian fleet completely, thereby denying Russia any influence in the Sea of Japan. Akiyama devised the tactic of changing the direction of the fleet while in front of the enemy. He had borrowed this tactic from an old book of the late twelfth century, &quot;Old Piratical Tactics of the Nojima School&quot;, which described the tactics used by Japanese pirates. 

Following Japan&#x27;s victory Akiyama was designated the senior naval representative for the preliminary negotiations for the Treaty of Portsmouth. However, the untimely death of his mother necessitated his replacement.

===Postwar activities===

Promoted to captain on 25 September 1908, Akiyama received an assignment as executive officer on &quot;Mikasa&quot;, and subsequently his first command, as captain of &quot;Akitsushima&quot;. He was subsequently captain of the , , , and battlecruiser .

Akiyama was promoted to rear admiral on 1 December 1913. Soon afterwards, the Siemens-Vickers Naval Armaments Scandal of 1914 shook up the government, forcing the resignations of Yamamoto Gonnohyōe and Ōkuma Shigenobu. Akiyama remained one of the few senior officers completely untouched by suspicion or corruption, and was nominated by Yashiro Rokuro as Director-General of the Navy in an effort to restore public confidence. Akiyama served on the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff until his retirement on 1 December 1917. His major accomplishment during this period was to have the &quot;Otowa&quot; stationed permanently at Shanghai, from which it helped support a large network of intelligence agents posing as exchange students in all corners of China. At the same time, Akiyama maintained a regular and secret correspondence with Sun Yat-sen, assisting him also materially in his efforts to prevent Yuan Shikai from establishing a new empire.

With the outbreak of World War I, Akiyama traveled to Europe via the Trans-Siberian Railroad to Finland, and from there to England, where he met with his old acquaintance, former British naval observer Commander William Christopher Pakenham. In June 1916, King George V conferred upon him a Knight Commandership of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. As Sir Saneyuki, K.C.M.G., he was reportedly the first Japanese outside the Imperial family to receive a knighthood from a British sovereign.

He returned to Japan via the United States to assume command of the IJN 2nd Fleet in October 1917, but by this time he was already very ill, and was forced to retire in late 1917 with the rank of vice admiral. In his final years, he became obsessed with religion, especially with the Oomoto movement and Nichiren sect Buddhism and the Heart Sutra. Akiyama died of peritonitis in 1918 at the young age of 49 (In the East Asian age reckoning, it is sometimes described as being 51 years old), His grave is at Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

==Cultural impact==
Akiyama and his brother, Akiyama Yoshifuru, along with their friend Masaoka Shiki, are the main characters in Shiba Ryotaro&#x27;s popular multi-volume novel, &quot;Saka no ue no kumo&quot;. The novel is also the basis for a three-year NHK television series, also called &quot;Saka no ue no kumo&quot;.

The Akiyama birthplace in Matsuyama is now a tourist attraction.

<text>Henry Bernard Ollendorff (March 14, 1907 – February 10, 1979) was a German-Jewish social worker.

He was born as Heinz Bernard Ollendorff to an oculist in the town of Esslingen am Neckar, Germany. He grew up in the city of Darmstadt. He received his doctor&#x27;s degree in law from the University of Heidelberg. The discrimination laws of Nazi Germany severely hindered him in his work and he even had to spend 13 months in prison before he emigrated together with his wife to the United States, in 1938.

In Cleveland, Ohio he studied social work. In 1954, the US Department of State asked him to participate in the re-education programme for Germans and he conducted courses for youth leaders and social workers in Hesse. He also had the idea to start an exchange program.

Now the Council of International Fellowship is a world wide organisation for professionals working in the field of social work.

Ollendorff died in Cleveland, Ohio.

<doc id="532719" wikidata="Q294405" url="?curid=532719" title="Alpha Group">
<text>Spetsgruppa &quot;A&quot;, also known as Alpha Group (a popular English name), or Alfa, whose official name is Directorate &quot;A&quot; of the FSB Special Purpose Center (TsSN FSB) (Russian: Спецназ ФСБ &quot;Альфа&quot;), is a stand-alone sub-unit of Russia&#x27;s special forces within the Russian Special Forces Center of the Federal Security Service (FSB). It was created by the Soviet KGB in 1974. Although little is known about the exact nature of its primary directives, it is speculated that the unit is authorised to act under the direct control and sanction of Russia&#x27;s top political leadership, similar to its sister unit, the Directorate &quot;V&quot; (Vympel), which is officially tasked with protecting Russia&#x27;s strategic installations, as well as conducting black operations inside and outside Russia. It is also available for extended police duties, for paramilitary operations, and for covert operations, both domestically and internationally.

==In the Soviet Union==
===Creation and organization===
On 28 July 1974, Alpha Group was created on the orders of the KGB Chairman, Yuri Andropov, in the aftermath of the 1972 Munich massacre. It might have been established as a response to West Germany&#x27;s creation of the &quot;Grenzschutzgruppe 9&quot; (or the GSG 9). By attaching a special-purpose unit to the office of the First Chief Directorate in Moscow (later the Seventh Directorate), it was hoped that the Soviet Union&#x27;s defensive capacity against terrorist attacks would increase significantly. At the time, other, more offensive special forces of the KGB included the groups Zenit and Kaskad/Omega. Another important mission for Alpha was to provide security for the Soviet leadership against enemy special forces in times of crisis or war.

Later, territorial Alpha units were established across the Soviet Union: 
* 7th Group formed in the Russian SSR, Khabarovsk Krai 
* 10th Group formed the Ukrainian SSR, Kiev Oblast – Later forming the basis of Ukraine&#x27;s Alpha Group
* 11th Group formed in the Belarusian SSR, Minsk Oblast – Later forming the basis of Belarus&#x27; Alpha Group
* 12th Group formed in the Kazakh SSR, Almaty Oblast – Later forming the basis of Kazakh NSC &quot;Arystan&quot; unit
* 13th Group formed in the Russian SSR, Krasnodar Krai
* 14th Group formed in the Russian SSR, Sverdlovsk Oblast

===Operations===
Initially, this special-purpose counter-terrorism unit was involved in delicate operations which necessitated its members have a unique skill set. In 1979, the Alpha Group shot a young Soviet Ukrainian, named Yuri Vlasenko, who was occupying a room in the Consular Section of the Embassy of the United States in Moscow, demanding he be granted asylum in the United States. He was either killed by gunfire, or by the detonation of his home-made bomb, which also slightly damaged the building. Throughout the 1980s, Alpha became increasingly deployed domestically to respond to a rising number of hostage taking situations, including at least two cases which involved buildings being taken over and hostages taken by violent groups of deserters from the Soviet Army, as well as other armed organizations. 

Airline hijackings were another growing security concern within the Soviet Union which Alpha were deployed to solve. Between the 1970 Dymshits–Kuznetsov hijacking affair and 1986, sixteen incidents of air piracy had occurred on Aeroflot flights, six in 1978 alone. Notably, the 1983 hijacking of Aeroflot Flight 6833 in Tbilisi, Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, was thwarted when Alpha stormed the airplane, killing three and capturing three other hijackers who were attempting to escape to the west, which also resulted in the loss of five hostages. Alpha members also participated in the storming of a Tu-134 during an attempted hijacking by deserters at Ufa on September 20th 1986. The two hijackers, having previously killed two policemen in a shootout, then killed two passengers while seizing the aircraft. Alpha operatives stormed the plane, killing one hijacker and wounding the other.

The unit also became involved in the ethnic conflicts throughout the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Alpha was also used as the &quot;spearhead&quot; of KGB counterintelligence operations, interdicting hostile intelligence operations on Soviet territory and seizing enemy spies such as CIA agent Adolf Tolkachev in 1985. Two commanding officers of Group &quot;A&quot; were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union: Gen. Viktor Karpukhin and Gen. Gennady Zaitsev.

====Foreign operations====
Soon, Alpha was assigned missions far exceeding its formal scope. On 27 December 1979, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev launched a surprise armed intervention and regime change operation in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Soviet forces, including KGB commandos who had infiltrated the country on a pretense to guard the Soviet Embassy, were able to quickly secure important government institutions throughout Kabul. Those institutions included: the Ministry of the Interior; the headquarters of the KHAD security service; the Ministry of Defense (Darul Aman Palace); and the Tajbeg Palace, in which, during a 34-minute storming, they successfully assassinated President Hafizullah Amin, along with his mistress and his young son (the orders were to kill every Afghan in the building). The assault on Tajbeg Palace was given the name Operation Storm-333 and involved a combined force of Soviet Airborne paratroopers (VDV), and special forces groups from the GRU and the KGB, including 24 men from the &quot;Thunder&quot; detachment of Alpha Group. The Alpha detachment were dressed in Afghan uniforms and headed by Grigoriy Boyarinov, commandant of the special operations school of the KGB&#x27;s Department 8. It was Boyarinov who ordered that all Afghan witnesses of the operation be killed, and he was accidentally shot dead by Alpha troops when he was mistaken for a palace guard. According to Russian sources, the members of this highly trained group performed remarkably well, losing only two men; the lightest casualties of any of the forces involved in the raid. However, the success of Storm-333, and the initial invasion, marked the beginning of the ten-year Soviet–Afghan War, and subsequently, Alpha Group&#x27;s extensive involvement throughout the conflict.

Six years later, in October 1985, Alpha Group was dispatched to war-torn Beirut, Lebanon. The Kremlin was informed of the kidnapping of four Soviet diplomats by the militant group, the Islamic Liberation Organization (a radical offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood). It was believed that this was retaliation for the Soviet support of Syrian involvement in the Lebanese Civil War. However, by the time Alpha arrived, one of the hostages had already been killed. Through a network of supporting KGB operatives, members of the task-force identified each of the perpetrators involved in the crisis, and once identified, began to take the relatives of these militants as hostages. Following the standard Soviet policy of &quot;no negotiations with terrorists&quot;, one of the hostages taken by Alpha Group had his testicles removed and sent to the militants before being killed. The warning was clear: more would follow unless the remaining hostages were released immediately. The show of force worked; and, for a period of 20 years, no Soviet or Russian officials were taken captive, until the 2006 abduction and murder of four Russian embassy staff in Iraq. However, the veracity of this story has been brought into question. Another version says that the release of the Soviet hostages was the result of extensive diplomatic negotiations with the spiritual leader of Hezbollah, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, who appealed to King Hussein of Jordan, and the leaders of Libya and Iran, to use their influence on the kidnappers.

===Fall of the Soviet Union===
====Intervention in the Baltics====
On 11 March 1990, the Supreme Council of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic made public their intent to secede from the Soviet Union and re-establish the independent Republic of Lithuania. As a result of this pronouncement, on 9 January 1991, the Soviet leadership dispatched Alpha Group to quell the independence movement and maintain Lithuania&#x27;s status as a Soviet republic. This attempt to re-establish Soviet dominance culminated in the violent seizure of the Vilnius TV Tower on 13 January 1991, during which the Soviet forces killed 13 unarmed Lithuanian protesters, as well as one Alpha operative (Lt. Viktor Shatskikh, who was apparently struck in the back by friendly fire). In 2011, the former commander of Alpha Group, retired KGB Col. Mikhail Golovatov, was detained at Vienna International Airport on a European Arrest Warrant due to this incident, issued by Lithuania, but Austrian authorities released him within 24 hours, claiming that the information provided by Lithuania was &quot;too vague&quot;. In response, the Lithuanian parliament discussed breaking diplomatic ties with Austria in protest. A joint statement by the Foreign Ministers of all three Baltic States condemned Golovatov&#x27;s release, and said that it should have been one of &quot;... the occasions when suspects are detained and extradited, particularly when they are accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity ...&quot; as &quot;... the crimes performed in 1991 in Vilnius and Riga have no limitation ...&quot; (&quot;Riga&quot; referring to a similar crackdown in January 1991, when six Latvian policemen and civilians were killed by Soviet OMON and KGB forces, possibly including Alpha Group members).

====1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt====
During the events of the Soviet coup attempt in August 1991, Alpha Group&#x27;s commanding officer, Gen. Karpukhin, was commanded by KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov to forcibly enter the White House, Russia&#x27;s acting parliament, after paratroopers secured the entrance, to eliminate the President of the Russian SFSR, Boris Yeltsin, and various other anti-coup leaders assembled there. In addition to Alpha Group, Gen. Karpukhin was also given authority of Vega Group (Vympel), elements of the Soviet Airborne, Internal Troops, special units of the Dzerzhinsky Division (OMSDON), mobilised units of the Moscow OMON, three tank companies, and a squadron of helicopters. On-site analysis of the area was conducted by Airborne deputy commander Alexander Lebed, and other senior officers who mingled with the crowds of anti-coup protesters nearest to the White House. There was a general consensus among the military officials who gathered that day, as evidenced by their statements months after the botched coup attempt, that had they followed through on their endeavour it would have succeeded. The stated mission objectives could have been reached in no more than half-an-hour, but it would have come at a terrible human cost. Shortly after their assessment was made, Gen. Karpukhin and Vympel&#x27;s Boris Beskov convinced the KGB Deputy chairman, Gennady Ageyev, that such a massive undertaking should be cancelled.

==In the Russian Federation==
===Decorated servicemen===

As of 2018, nine officers of Alpha have been awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation:
* Lt. Gennady Sergeyev (posthumously)
* Col. Anatoly Saveliev (posthumously)
* Maj. Vladimir Ulyanov (posthumously)
* Maj. Yuri Danilin (posthumously)
* Col. Sergei Dyachenko
* Col. Valery Kanakin
* Lt. Artyom Sevshencko
* Maj. Alexander Perov (posthumously)
* Col. Andrei Kum.

===Shuffling and reforms===
Alpha Group was severely downgraded during the dissolution and collapse of the Soviet Union. After the fall of the USSR, both Alpha and Vympel were transferred to the newly formed Main Guard Directorate (GUO), which was established on the basis of the KGB&#x27;s Ninth Chief Directorate. In 1993, they were taken from GUO control, and for a time being put under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). As part of the government shakeup following the June 1995 Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis in which the Alpha Group had a leading role, Yeltsin fired the first Director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Sergei Stepashin. Two months later, Alpha and Vityaz were both transferred from the MVD to the FSB. Simultaneously, Mikhail Barsukov became the new head of the organization, and created the FSB Anti-Terrorist Center (ATC), headed by Gen. Viktor Zorkin. Directorate &quot;A&quot; (Alpha) was tasked with protecting transportation and buildings while Directorate &quot;V&quot; (Vega/Vympel) was tasked with protecting strategic sites (another Directorate, &quot;K&quot;, was tasked with ideological counterintelligence); &quot;A&quot; and &quot;V&quot; were soon joined in a &quot;Tsentr Spetsnaz&quot; (Special Purpose Center) under Gen. Vladimir Pronichev.

Meanwhile, Alpha veterans became active in legitimate businesses (such as the private security company Alpha-B co-founded by Col. Golovatov in August 1993) in organised crime, as well as in politics. The Alpha veterans&#x27; association, led by Sergey Goncharov, strongly opposed Russian President Yeltsin faction&#x27;s party, Our Home – Russia, in the legislative election of 1995 (Goncharov later became a State Duma deputy). Gen. Karpukhin, who resigned from the service following the 1991 coup attempt, became chief of security to Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, after which he worked with private security companies in Moscow, and ran unsuccessfully for the Duma as a member of the Union of Patriots in 1995.

===Operations===
In October 1995, Alpha killed the armed man who hijacked a bus carrying South Korean tourists in Moscow. He had demanded $1 million and to be flown out of the country. In December 1997, Alpha freed the Swedish trade counsellor Jan-Olof Nyström who was kidnapped in Moscow by a gunman similarly demanding a ransom and a flight out of Russia. The hostage was swapped for Alpha&#x27;s Colonel Anatoly Saveliev (Savelyev), and the hostage-taker was killed during the storming of the embassy. Colonel Savelyev was injured during the action, and died in hospital of a heart attack shortly thereafter.

====1993 Russian constitutional crisis====
In 1993, during the Russian constitutional crisis, Yeltsin, who by then was President of the Russian Federation, used Alpha and Vympel during a deadly showdown in central Moscow against the pro-parliament forces that sided with Vice-President Alexander Rutskoy (declaring him an acting president). The pro-parliament faction had seized the Russian White House, along with several Supreme Soviet deputies who had been taken hostage. Yeltsin ordered Russian troops to storm the building, including elements of the paratroopers, the Alpha and Vympel Groups, Russian ground forces, and the Internal Troops&#x27;s special forces unit, Vityaz. However, the Alpha troops initially refused to attack the White House, reportedly bringing their commander, Gen. Zaitsev, to the brink of suicide over the open insubordination of his troops in the face of a presidential order. When one of the Alpha troops, Lt. Sergeyev, who was near the White House, was mortally wounded by sniper fire from the nearby Hotel Ukraina, the unit finally agreed to move. Opposition gunmen were blamed for the shooting, but it is possible that the shots were actually fired by members of a special unit loyal to Yeltsin; it was rumoured that the snipers in the hotel were commanded by Alexander Korzhakov, chief of the Presidential Security Service (SBP). The crisis ended when Yeltsin&#x27;s forces, paratroopers supported by tanks and armoured personnel carriers, many of which were manned not by conscripts but members of the Union of Afghanistan Veterans, stormed and seized the White House on 4 October 1993, killing dozens, and possibly hundreds, of people, and ensuring the total victory of Yeltsin&#x27;s faction. In the end, Rutskoy and the other leaders of anti-Yeltsin faction, including Ruslan Khasbulatov, Vladislav Achalov and Viktor Barannikov, all negotiated their surrender to the Alpha troops, who had entered the shelled and burning building after the shooting stopped, and brought them, along with the detained Supreme Soviet deputies, to Lefortovo Prison.

====Conflicts in Chechnya and the North Caucasus====
The Alpha Group was involved in the First Chechen War of 1994–1996, following the Chechens&#x27; declaration of independence from the Russian SFSR and then the Soviet Union in 1990–1991. In the fall of 1994, Alpha provided personal security details for the main commanders of the invasion of Chechnya, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and federal Interior Minister Viktor Yerin, as they travelled to the Mozdok airbase in North Ossetia, which was the main headquarters, staging area and logistics base for Russian forces entering Chechnya. Later, many Alpha troops served in &quot;mobile anti-terror groups&quot; (), as well as providing security for the pro-Moscow Chechen government complex and the regional FSB headquarters in the Chechen capital Grozny. In August 1996, when the city was retaken by Chechen separatist forces, 35 of them (including 14 members of the territorial Alpha unit from Krasnodar Krai) took part in a defence of the FSB headquarters. The separatist forces began to systematically retake individual buildings which were being defended by cut-off groups of Russian military and security forces. By the war&#x27;s final ceasefire, the main FSB office was one of the few key structures still being held by federal forces in central Grozny, but at the cost of 70 of its defenders&#x27; lives in some of the fiercest fighting during the last battle.

Allegations arose, following the Khasavyurt Accord of August 1996, that the ATC carried out clandestine operations intended to discredit the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, so that it would not receive international recognition of its independence. According to Jonathan Littell, the service &quot;... was most likely deeply involved ...&quot; in many of the high-profile kidnappings which damaged Chechnya&#x27;s reputation. Littell wrote: &quot;It is impossible to say whether these provocations were part of a more general FSB policy or whether the [ATC] and its departments were running their own show; certainly it did not reflect the official policy of the government, nor of those officials like Ivan Rybkin, the Secretary of the Security Council, tasked with the Chechen dossier between 1996 and 1999.&quot;

Alpha was active during the Second Chechen War that began in 1999, as well as the subsequent Insurgency in the North Caucasus. During the 2000 Battle of Komsomolskoye, Alpha snipers attached to Vladimir Shamanov&#x27;s Western Group of federal forces, were deployed in an attempt to suppress Ruslan Gelayev&#x27;s snipers in the village. According to the unit&#x27;s veterans, operations in which Alpha took part led to the arrest of Chechen commander Salman Raduyev in 2000, the killing of Chechen commander Arbi Barayev in 2001, the killing of Chechen separatist President Aslan Maskhadov in 2005, and the killing of foreign militant leader Abu Hafs in Dagestan in 2006. Following the transfer of responsibility for operations in Chechnya from the Ministry of Defence to the FSB in January 2001, and prior to the &quot;Chechenization&quot; policy that began in 2003, Alpha members (along with the other Russian personnel and pro-Moscow Chechen militia) participated in at least 10 mixed &quot;combined special groups&quot; (, SSGs), considered death squads by human rights groups and outside observers. It is believed that the SSGs were behind many of the numerous &quot;name/address cleansings&quot; (&quot;imeny/adressny zachistki&quot;): usually night-time raids by masked men in unmarked vehicles, targeting specific active or former rebel combatants, their supporters, their relatives, or other civilians for either forced disappearance or outright extrajudicial killing. In 2005, Human Rights Watch declared that the disappearances had reached the scale of a crime against humanity, and that &quot;Russia has the inglorious distinction of being a world leader in enforced disappearances.&quot; Chechnya&#x27;s UFSB also formed a local Alpha unit, believed to be similar in its role to the SSGs.

====Mass hostage crises====
The group was instrumental in the Russian government&#x27;s attempts to forcibly bring an end to a series of mass hostage crisis incidents, in which groups of Chechen and other separatist militants took hostages. These events took place in Russia&#x27;s southern territories near Chechnya as well as in the Russian heartland, and were made up of the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis in June 1995, the Kizlyar-Pervomayskoye hostage crisis in January 1996, the Moscow theatre hostage crisis in October 2002, and the Beslan school hostage crisis in September 2004. Each of these high-profile incidents resulted in hundreds of fatalities and injuries among the hostages and, with the exception of the Moscow siege, significant losses among the unit&#x27;s personnel.

At Budyonnovsk (Budennovsk) in Stavropol Krai, two abortive storming attempts by Alpha and Vympel killed scores of hostages in a major public relations disaster for the Russian government, as the carnage was televised live across the country. In the first, a pre-dawn raid, only 86 out of more than 1,500 hostages were freed, but more than 30 hostages were killed before the rescuers were forced to retreat after four hours of fighting, which also resulted in the deaths of several men on both sides. After that, the leader of the hostage-takers, Chechen commander Shamil Basayev, agreed to release pregnant and nursing women, and to allow emergency services to put out a fire in the main building and to collect and remove dead bodies. The assault was then resumed at noon and included the use of tear gas; it stopped after over an hour later when Basayev agreed to release the remaining women and children. The overall death toll of more than 120 people included three Alpha members. In the end, the crisis was resolved through negotiations that led to an agreement involving a ceasefire in Chechnya and high-level peace talks, both of which later broke down, with full-scale hostilities resuming in October 1995. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin claimed that both attacks had not been authorised by the government, but were launched by troops acting without orders.

At Pervomayskoye, a small settlement on the outskirt of Kizlyar in Dagestan, in an operation that was conducted under the direct control of Barsukov, Alpha Group was mostly held in reserve during multiple failed storming attempts spearheaded by Vityaz and the SOBR (a special forces unit of the Moscow police), supported by tanks and armoured vehicles. Further attacks were conducted with heavy artillery, including Grad launchers firing salvos of rockets into the village, and helicopter gunship support. According to statements made to justify the use of unlimited force, the FSB had been informed, falsely, that the hostages had been executed by their captors, prior to the commencement of military operations. This full-scale offensive continued for three days, until the Chechen militants fought their way through the siege lines in a night-time break-out, escaping with many of the surviving hostages in another major humiliation for the Kremlin. 26 out of the 150 hostages lost their lives (most of the original 2,000 hostages had been released in Kizlyar), and in all the incident resulted more than 300 fatalities, mostly among the Russian forces. Although they avoided the kind of devastating losses that decimated the Moscow SOBR (including the death of their commanding officer) and the 22nd Independent Brigade of Spetsnaz GRU, Alpha Group still suffered casualties at Pervomayskoye. These included a friendly fire incident which occurred after fighting had ended, when a regular soldier accidentally fired his vehicle&#x27;s Grom gun, killing two Alpha members. When the Alpha Group was deployed, they were sent in without winter clothing and quartered in unheated buses. One of the unit&#x27;s commanders claimed they were &quot;set up&quot;, saying: &quot;The first day it was 15 below and we were standing in the fields with no warm clothes. There were no sleeping bags, no water, no food. The hostages were being destroyed, the rebels were being destroyed and we were being destroyed there. That&#x27;s what happened.&quot;

Several highly controversial actions made the force susceptible to criticism revolving around the loss of life among the hostages. One of these actions was the use of an unknown chemical agent to assist Alpha Group and the SOBR break the October 2002 Moscow hostage crisis, by knocking out the people inside the building. The FSB chemical attack resulted in the deaths of at least 129 hostages and serious damage to the health of many others, yet was hailed by the group&#x27;s officers as their &quot;... first successful operation for years&quot;. In 2011, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ordered Russia to pay compensation to 64 survivors of the siege for their physical and emotional suffering, and to prosecute the officials who committed the human rights violations, ruling that the authorities had failed to minimise the risks to the hostages. Russia failed to uphold the ECHR ruling, paying the compensation to victims but not launching an investigation into the violations.

Another controversy was the use of tank cannons, portable flamethrowers, and other weapons such as grenade launchers in Beslan, North Ossetia. On 3 September 2004, the local school was taken over by Chechen-led militants from Ingushetia, and was subsequently raided by the heavily armed FSB special forces of Alpha and Vympel. The operation was overseen by the head of the Special Purpose Center, Gen. Alexander Tikhonov, who forbade extinguishing the fire in the school, while the actual attack was personally led by Gen. Pronichev, and supported by tanks, armoured personnel carriers and attack helicopters. John McAleese, a member of the Special Air Service (SAS) team which had liberated the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980, immediately called it one of the worst hostage rescue attempts he had seen or heard about. The Beslan siege turned out to be particularly bloody, costing the lives of more than 333 people, including 186 children (age 1 to 17), 111 relatives, guests and friends, 17 school staff members and 10 Alpha members. No ballistic tests were carried out, and prosecutors were not allowed to examine the special forces&#x27; weapons to determine who exactly killed the hostages. In 2007, 447 survivors and relatives of victims of the Beslan massacre brought a complaint against the Russian government in seven applications to the ECHR.

==In other post-Soviet states==
===Ex-Soviet regional Alpha units===

====In Belarus====
The Minsk territorial unit of Alpha continues to exist within the State Security Committee (KGB) of Belarus, known simply as &quot;Alfa&quot; («Альфа»).

====In Kazakhstan====
The Almaty territorial unit of Alpha was turned into the special unit Arystan (meaning &quot;Lions&quot; in Kazakh) of the National Security Committee (KNB) of Kazakhstan. In 2006, five members of Arystan were arrested and charged with the kidnapping of the opposition politician Altynbek Sarsenbayuly, his driver, and his bodyguard; the three victims were then allegedly delivered to the people who murdered them.

====In Ukraine====

Special Group &quot;Alpha&quot; is a branch of the Security Service of Ukraine; and a successor of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Alpha Group. It has continued to be informally called &quot;Alpha&quot;.

===Self-styled new units===
====In Georgia====
Georgia established its own Alpha unit in 1992. It was created as one of the three special forces units belonging to the Ministry of State Security, the other two being named Delta and Omega. In 1995, members of Alpha and the Minister of State Security, Igor Giorgadze, were blamed for the failed bombing attempt on the life of President Eduard Shevardnadze. After that, Giorgadze fled to Moscow, and Georgia&#x27;s Alpha was purged and reorganised.

====In Kyrgyzstan====
A special unit named &quot;Alfa&quot; Special Operations Executive (ASOE) was established within the State Committee on National Security (GKNB) of Kyrgyzstan. In 2010, eight members of ASOE, including five snipers and the unit&#x27;s commander, were charged with shooting and killing unarmed people during the Second Kyrgyz Revolution. Criminal cases were brought to the court under the articles: 97 (murder), and 305 part 2 (exceeding the limits of authority).

<doc id="532734" wikidata="Q344488" url="?curid=532734" title="Stan Fox">
<text>Stanley Cole Fuchs (July 7, 1952 – December 18, 2000), known professionally as Stan Fox (&quot;Fuchs&quot; being the German word for &quot;fox&quot;), was an American open wheel race car driver. Fox was one of the last links between the midget car racing world and the Indianapolis 500.

==Midget car career==
Fox began his career as a midget car racer. He won the 1979 Badger Midget championship, and the 1979 and 1980 Belleville Midget Nationals. He placed in the top twelve in points in nine seasons, even after he raced sporadically after moving to United States Auto Club (USAC) open wheel events. He had 19 USAC career wins. He won the Turkey Night Grand Prix in 1990 at the last event at Ascot Park. He won the 1991 Turkey Night Grand Prix, two Copper Classics, three Rex Easton Memorials at Springfield, Illinois, two Rodger Mauro Classics, and the midget car portion of the 4-Crown National at Eldora Speedway.

==IndyCar career==
Fox competed in the Indianapolis 500 eight times between 1987 and 1995 driving for A. J. Foyt and Ron Hemelgarn. He was also a motorcycle racing enthusiast.

===Near-fatal crash at Indianapolis===
While driving for Ron Hemelgarn, Fox was seriously injured during the 1995 Indianapolis 500 in an accident. After starting ninth, Fox went low into the first turn on the first lap of the race and spun. His car connected with the car of Eddie Cheever, Jr. and slammed into the outside wall. Several other cars also became involved. The front nose-cone was ripped from his car, exposing his legs. Fox suffered serious head injuries which put him in a coma for five days, and had surgery to have a blood clot removed from his brain. After a month, Fox had been moved from the Methodist Hospital critical care unit to a private room, and was showing signs of improvement.

The accident ended Fox&#x27;s racing career but he stayed involved with the sport. He started the non-profit organization &quot;Friends of the Fox&quot; which supports people with head injuries and brings a person to the track each May to meet drivers and get VIP treatment.

==Death==
Fox was killed in a head-on collision on December 18, 2000, on the Desert Road some south of Auckland, New Zealand. Fox was driving through the night to attend a speedway meeting and collided head on with a northbound truck and trailer Unit.

==Career award==
*He was inducted in the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame.

<doc id="532751" wikidata="Q698638" url="?curid=532751" title="MG 151 cannon">
<text>The &quot;Maschinengewehr&quot; (MG) 151 is a belt-fed autocannon for aircraft use, developed in Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1940 and produced by Waffenfabrik Mauser during World War II. It was originally produced in 15.1 mm caliber from 1940, with a 15×96mm cartridge, but due to demand for higher effect against aircraft, especially with the introduction of mine shells for the 20 mm MG-FF/M aircraft cannon, the design was rechambered to 20 mm caliber in 1941, using a newly developed 20×82mm cartridge which traded projectile velocity for explosive power. The initial 15 mm variant then became known as the MG 151/15, with the new 20 mm variant becoming the MG 151/20.

The MG 151/20 cannon was widely used on German Luftwaffe combat aircraft throughout World War II, mainly as offensive armament, but also seeing some use as defensive guns. Existing MG 151/15 guns saw use as aircraft armament throughout the war, albeit more limited compared to the MG 151/20, but also as anti-aircraft guns in various configurations, such as the SdKfz 251/21 &quot;Drilling&quot; half-track which carried three MG 151/15.

Post-war, salvaged MG 151/20 saw usage by many nations. France had salvaged many guns and became the main user and exporter of the MG 151/20 during the Cold War, fitting it to not only aircraft, but also armoured fighting vehicles as anti aircraft weaponry. France continued exporting the gun all the way into the 1960s, then primarily as flexible dorsal gunship armament for the Aérospatiale SA-3160 and SA-3164 Alouette III utility helicopter. SA-3160s armed with MG 151/20s were bought by Portugal, Rhodesia and South Africa in 1966 and saw service until the early 1990s. South Africa reused the 20×82mm cartridge from the MG 151/20 to chamber their Denel NTW-20 anti-materiel rifle.

== Development and wartime history ==
The pre-war German doctrine for arming single-engine fighter aircraft mirrored that of the French. This doctrine favoured a powerful autocannon mounted between the cylinder banks of a V engine and firing through the propeller hub, known as a &quot;moteur-canon&quot; in French (from its first use with the Hispano-Suiza HS.8C engine in World War I, on the SPAD S.XII) and by the cognate &quot;Motorkanone&quot; in German by the 1930s. The weapon preferred by the French in this role was the 20 mm Oerlikon FF S model, but this proved too big for German engines. Mauser was given the task of developing a gun that would fit, with a minimum sacrifice in performance. As a stop-gap measure, the MG FF cannon was developed from the Oerlikon FF and put in widespread use, but its performance was lackluster.

Production of the MG 151 in its original 15 mm calibre format began in 1940. After combat evaluation of the 15 mm cartridge as the main armament of early Messerschmitt Bf 109F-2 fighters, the cannon was redesigned with a larger cartridge as the 20 mm MG 151/20 in 1941. Combat experience showed that a more powerful explosive shell was preferable to a higher projectile velocity. The MG 151/20 cartridge was created by expanding the neck of the cartridge to hold the larger explosive shell used in the MG FF cannon, and shortening the length of the cartridge case to match the overall length of the original 15 mm cartridge. These measures simplified conversion of the 15 mm to the 20 mm MG 151/20, requiring only a change of barrel and other small modifications. A disadvantage of the simplified conversion was reduction of projectile muzzle velocity from for the 15 mm shell to for the larger and heavier 20 mm shell. A 20 mm AP projectile could penetrate only 10–12 mm of armor at 300 m (at 60 degrees), compared to 18 mm penetration for the 15 mm under the same conditions but this was not seen as a significant limitation. The 20 mm version became the standard inboard cannon from the Bf 109F-4 series. The 20 mm MG 151/20 offered more predictable trajectory, longer range and higher impact velocity than the cartridge of the earlier MG FF cannon. The MG FF was retained for flexible, wing and upward firing &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; mounts to the end of the war.

The German preference for explosive power rather than armor penetration was taken further with the development of the mine shell which had been first introduced for the MG FF (in the Bf 109 E-4) and later for the MG 151/20. Even this improvement in explosive power turned out to be unsatisfactory against the four-engine bombers that German fighters were up against in the second part of the war. By German calculations, it took about 15–20 hits with the MG 151/20 to down a heavy bomber but this was reduced to just 3–4 hits for a 30 mm shell with the shattering effects of its hexogen explosive filling used by the long-barreled MK 103 and shorter barreled MK 108 cannon. Only four or five hits with 20 mm calibre cannon were needed for frontal attacks on heavy bombers (Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator) but such attacks were difficult to execute. The 30 mm MK 108 cannon thus replaced the MG 151/20 as the standard, engine-mount &quot;Motorkanone&quot; centre-line armament starting with the Bf 109 K-4 and was also retrofitted to some of the G-series.

Eight hundred MG 151/20 were exported to Japan aboard the Italian submarine in August 1943 and used to equip 388 Japanese Kawasaki Ki-61-I Hei fighters. The 20 mm MG 151/20 was also fitted on the Macchi C.205, the Fiat G.55 and Reggiane Re.2005 of the Italian &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; and IAR 81B and 81C of the Romanian Royal Air Force.

An unknown number of cannons were converted for usage in the ground use role in early 1945, predominantly within &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units serving in the Posen area. Its effectiveness in this role are unknown but it was photographed on parade in Posen November 1944 with the &quot;Wartheland Volkssturm&quot; units.

=== Postwar use ===
After World War II, numbers of ex-Luftwaffe MG 151/20 cannon were removed from inventory and from scrapped aircraft and used by various nations in their own aircraft. The French &quot;Armée de l&#x27;air&quot; (AdA) and French Army aviation arm (&quot;Aviation légère de l&#x27;armée de Terre, &quot;ALAT) used MG 151/20 cannon as fixed and flexible armament in various aircraft, including helicopters. The AdA and ALAT jointly developed a rubber-insulated flexible mount for the MG 151/20 for use as a door gun, which was later used in combat in Algeria aboard several FAF/ALAT Piasecki H-21C assault transport helicopters and on Sikorsky H-34 gunship helicopters. French Matra MG 151 20 mm cannons were used by Portugal and Rhodesia fitted to their Alouette III helicopters, while Denel designed its own variant for the South African Air Force.

=== 20×82mm cartridge specifications ===
== US derivatives (T17, T39, T51) ==
During World War II, the US Army produced the 0.60-caliber T17, a reverse-engineered copy of the German MG 151 chambered for an experimental anti-tank rifle round. A speculative order of 5,000 T17 guns was placed, but only around 300 of them were built. However, none saw service despite the availability of 6 million rounds of .60 caliber ammunition. Almost one million rounds were fired during the T17 testing program. The main US version produced, the T17E3, was made by Frigidaire; it weighed and had a rate of fire of only 600 rounds per minute. Further refinements led to the T39 and T51 versions, but these also did not enter service.

=== US ammunition ===
A cartridge originally based on an armor-piercing round designed in 1939 for use with the experimental T1 and T1E1 anti-tank rifles. It was cancelled in 1944 when it became clear that modern tanks had armor too thick to penetrate with a heavy rifle cartridge. Developments showed that shaped-charged rifle grenades and rocket launchers were the future of infantry anti-tank weapons, and the anti-tank rifle concept was abandoned.

Much like the British attempts to turn their stocks of obsolete .55 Boys anti-tank cartridges into a native-designed heavy machine gun cartridge, the .60-caliber cartridge was repurposed as an autocannon cartridge to succeed the older .50 Browning. The ammunition and the T17 cannon were produced from 1942 to 1946 but never proved a substantial improvement over the .50 Browning and the M2HB and M3 heavy machine guns. The cartridge was later shortened and necked up to produce the 20×102mm Vulcan autocannon round.
* .60 Armor-Piercing [15.2×114mm T1 Rifle] - A 1180-grain (76.5-gram) kinetic penetrator projectile with a velocity of 3,600 feet per second (1,100 m/s) for a muzzle energy of over 34,000 ft./lbs. (46 kilojoules).

<doc id="532767" wikidata="Q2026486" url="?curid=532767" title="Operation Uphold Democracy">
<text>Operation Uphold Democracy was a multinational military intervention designed to remove the military regime led and installed by Raoul Cédras after the 1991 Haitian coup d&#x27;état overthrew the elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The operation was effectively authorized by the 31 July 1994 United Nations Security Council Resolution 940.

== Background ==
=== Coup and refugee crisis ===

Following the September 1991 Haitian coup d&#x27;état, which led to the &quot;de facto&quot; leadership of military officer Raoul Cédras, the Organization of American States (OAS) began economic sanctions against Haiti. Following this, the Haitian refugee crisis began, with 14,000 Haitian boat people being gathered from the Caribbean Sea by the United States by January 1992 and President George H. W. Bush forcing Haitian refugees not eligible for asylum to return the following month. The National Assembly of Haiti, Aristide and OAS nations draft the &quot;Washington Protocol&quot; in February 1992, establishing a timeline for restoring democracy in Haiti, though the Haitian Supreme Court declares the protocol null and void in April 1992, leading to increased sanctions from OAS nations. The following month, President Bush signed an executive order banning Haitian asylum and requiring forced repatriation, a policy that was continued by President Bill Clinton. By the end of 1992, 38,000 Haitians were intercepted according to the OAS.

=== Diplomatic efforts ===

==== Governors Island Accord ====
After Raoul Cédras rejected a plan for Aristide&#x27;s return proposed by Dante Caputo, a representative of the OAS and United Nations, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) voted for an oil and weapons embargo on Haiti in June 1993. A month later, Cedras and Aristide signed the Governors Island Accord, outlining a process for Aristide&#x27;s return to power by 30 October 1993. In August 1993, Robert Malval was named interim prime minister by Aristide. On 8 October 1993 as the USS &quot;Harlan County&quot; approached the Port international de Port-au-Prince to participate in training exercises with Haitian authorities, the Haitian Army prevented the ship from landing and Cedras announced that he will not comply with the previously signed accord. On 14 October, Prime Minister Maval&#x27;s cabinet went into hiding after the Minister of Justice, Guy Malary, was shot and killed. The following day, Cedras ignored the 15 October deadline to cede his leadership and the United States began a naval blockade of Haiti. On 16 October, the UNSC authorized military force, including blockades, to implement international sanctions, with more nations joining the effort.

==== UNSC authorizes military intervention ====
The UNSC established an ultimatum for the military government on 5 May 1994, demanding Cedras to leave Haiti within fifteen days or that he may be removed by force. By July 1994, the United States becomes overwhelmed with Haitian boat people once again and begins to detain more Haitian refugees at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. The same month, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for increased participation from Caribbean nations; Lieutenant Colonel Chris Olson was tasked to &quot;get as many flags as possible&quot; and contacted embassies of Caribbean Community (CARICOM) nations to request participation. At a meeting in Port Royal, Jamaica on 22 July 1994, the CARICOM nations of Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago each agreed to send a platoon of troops. Armed intervention was authorized by the 31 July 1994 United Nations Security Council Resolution 940, which granted the &quot;application of all necessary means to restore democracy in Haiti.&quot;

== Operational organization ==
The operation began with the alert of United States and its allies for a forced entry into the island nation of Haiti. U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, and Air Force elements staged to Puerto Rico and southern Florida to prepare to support the airborne invasion, spearheaded by elements of the Joint Special Operations Command (HQ, 75th Ranger Regiment), followed by 3rd Special Forces Group, the U.S. Army 7th Transportation Group (Army watercraft and terminal elements) and the 10th Mountain Division. Some of these elements were staged out of Hunter Army Airfield and Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The 1st Brigade of the 10th Mountain Division deployed to Haiti aboard and . The operation was directed by Lieutenant General Hugh Shelton, Joint Task Force 120 (JTF-120), provided by Commander, Carrier Group Two.
==Timeline of events==

===Invasion, ultimatum and capitulation===

On 16 September 1994, as these forces prepared to invade, with the lead elements of Bravo Co., 2nd Ranger Battalion already in the air after being staged in Guantanamo Bay, a diplomatic element led by former President Jimmy Carter, U.S. Senator Sam Nunn and retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell persuaded the leaders of Haiti to step down and allow the elected officials to return to power. The main leader holding power, General Cédras, was the key focus of the delegation. General Powell&#x27;s personal relationship with Cédras, from when Cédras was a student in the School of the Americas as a young officer, played a significant role in the American delegation gaining an audience with Cédras and enabling the conduct of negotiations for approximately two weeks.

Despite the insistent diplomatic efforts of the American delegation and the insinuation that force would be used if required, negotiations were at a virtual stalemate for the entire time, with General Cédras refusing to concede the legitimacy of the democratic elections. As a final effort to force him to step down without violence, the delegation presented General Cédras with a video feed of the 82nd Airborne Division&#x27;s aircraft being loaded with troops, with the Division&#x27;s DRF-1 (Division Ready Force 1, the Battalion designated first to deploy, with its equipment and vehicles pre-loaded for parachute drop world-wide) 1st Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment &quot;Red Falcons&quot; already deployed to Ft. Sherman, Panama. Therefore, the 2nd Battalion, 325th AIR &quot;White Falcons&quot; were attached to the 1st Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division Ready Brigade-1 (DRB-1). While allowing Cédras to process the panic-inducing sight, he was informed that while he assumed he was watching a live feed, he was in fact viewing a video captured more than 2 hours before. As such, the lead elements of the 3,900-strong paratrooper force had already launched from Fort Bragg, North Carolina and were currently over the Atlantic Ocean. They further informed him of the United States&#x27; commitment to supporting democracy and that a forced-entry airborne assault on the island nation would, in all likelihood, result in Haiti coming under U.S. control before the next sunrise.

The Carter delegation proceeded to issue a final ultimatum to the Cédras; his choices were to either recognize the wish of the Haitian people as expressed through the democratic election of Jean-Bertrand Aristide and quietly retire, or continue to deny the election&#x27;s outcome. In the latter case, the U.S. would forcibly wrest control of his country and see justice done. To remove all uncertainty from the general&#x27;s mind, he was reminded by the delegation that the 82nd Airborne Division had also spearheaded overwhelmingly decisive victories during Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada and Operation Just Cause in Panama in the recent past. Within minutes, General Cédras capitulated under the most favorable terms available to him at that time.

Cédras&#x27;s capitulation took time to be decided, and even after it was done, did not immediately take effect among the Armed Forces of Haiti (), nor was it immediately followed by other members of the junta. As a result, U.S. forces landing in Haiti saw their objective as severing the junta leadership from the FAd&#x27;H without provoking a panic among the rank and file. To facilitate this, General Shelton negotiated a turnover of command from Cédras to Major General Jean-Claude Duperval, who in turn promoted figures acceptable to Aristide into high positions in the FAd’H. Believing that he needed the FAd&#x27;H in the short run to avert anarchy, Shelton determined to reform the organization incrementally. Its abrupt collapse, he feared, would start a rapid and uncontrollable social decompression that might result in a large-scale insurgency. American rules of engagement were very restrictive; even paramilitary FRAPH junta supporters were to be treated as a legitimate political entity and thus not subject to neutralization unless they attacked first. Inclined initially to view the Americans as liberators, most ordinary Haitians experienced a profound sense of unfulfilled expectations upon discovery that American soldiers were negotiating and then collaborating with the despised FAd’H in maintaining order in the capital. Many Haitians had expected the U.S. to exact retribution from members of the junta. President Aristide urged the populace to remain calm until his return.

In one case on 20 September, recently landed U.S. Marines 2/2 in Port-au-Prince stood by while a protesting crowd was violently dispersed by the Haitian police, resulting in a civilian death. The state of affairs was such that many Haitians did not know who was supposed to be in charge of the city. Following outcry among the U.S. military and citizenry, as well as among Haitians, the U.S. Army quickly changed its rules of engagement. Behind the scenes, Shelton sent an emissary, Colonel Michael Sullivan, commander of the 16th Military Police (MP) Brigade, to Port-au-Prince Police Chief Colonel Michel Francois with an unequivocal message that assaults on the populace would stop or Francois would be held accountable.

The U.S. Marines who occupied Haiti&#x27;s second largest city, Cap Haitien, had less restrictive rules; they began immediate foot patrols upon arriving, establishing a strong presence. One such patrol came across a FAd&#x27;H unit deemed to be making &quot;threatening gestures&quot; on 24 September, resulting in a brief firefight: ten FAd&#x27;H troops were killed for no U.S. losses. The incident helped establish U.S. authority in the public&#x27;s mind (and was received enthusiastically by the populace when news spread the next day), though it was far from the last violent incident of the occupation. On 29 September, a FRAPH terrorist hurled a grenade into a crowd at a ceremony marking the reinstallation of the popular mayor of Port-au-Prince, Evans Paul; the terrorist was apprehended by the Marines the next day and interrogated.

===Operation Uphold Democracy===
With his capitulation, the 100-plus aircraft carrying the 82nd Airborne Division were either turned around in mid-air or unloaded before they had a chance to take off. The paratroopers returned to their unit areas on Fort Bragg and they resumed their ready status; only to have the DRF-1 unit, Task Force Panther, deployed to Panama for Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage on 12 December 1994. The military mission changed from a combat operation to a peacekeeping and nation-building operation with the deployment of the US-led multinational force in Haiti. This force was made up primarily of members of the 3rd Special Forces Group, but also included members of the 16th Military Police Brigade, 118th Military Police Company (Fort Bragg, NC), the 101st Military Police Company, the 988th Military Police Company (Fort Benning, Georgia)and 101st Aviation Brigade (Ft. Campbell, Kentucky), 3/2 ACR from Ft. Polk, Louisiana and Marine Forces Caribbean. Teams were deployed throughout the country to establish order and humanitarian services. Regular Army forces consisting of units from the 10th Mountain Division occupied, 593rd Signal Company Fort Huachuca Ariz. Port-au-Prince with 3rd Bn (Airborne) 73rd Armor Regiment (82nd Airborne Division). 

Elements from the U.S. Army Materiel Command and Defense Logistics Agency relieved the Army&#x27;s 1st Corps Support Command to provide logistical support in the form of the Joint Logistics Support Command (JLSC). The command, later renamed to Combined Joint Logistics Support Command in recognition of its multi-national nature, provided oversight and direct control over all Multinational Force and U.S. deployed logistics units. This included the Joint Material Management Center, JMMC and the follow-on civilian contractor LOGCAP including a senior Defense Support Agency CELL. 

Later, 3 Corps deployed the Corps support CMMC, 46th Support Group. Additionally in the early deployments, elements of the 44th Medical Brigade (Airborne), 55th Medical Group, from Fort Bragg {the majority from the 28th CSH (Combat Support Hospital)} provided medical care for service members and Haitians alike. A Joint Psychological Operations Task Force (JPOTF) composed primarily of elements from the United States Army&#x27;s 4th Psyop Group (Airborne) and reserve augmentees provided continuous, effective information operations support throughout Uphold Democracy and successive operations.

The United States Coast Guard played a significant role in the operation, providing command, control and communications services from the , a 378&#x27; high endurance cutter anchored in Port-au-Prince Harbor. Numerous 210&#x27; and 270&#x27; medium endurance cutters, 180&#x27; buoy tender , and 110&#x27; patrol boats worked with Navy SEAL gunboats to provide security for forces entering and exiting the twelve-mile exclusion zone and Port-au-Prince Harbor.

In August 1994, the battalion departed for the Caribbean and Haitian waters for Operation Support Democracy. 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines once again landed in Cap Haitian, Haiti on 20 September 1994. Participation in Operation Uphold Democracy lasted until October 1994. A squad from Echo Company engaged in a firefight with coup-supporting elements of the Haitian police and military. One Navy interpreter was wounded and several Haitians lost their lives. The 10th Mountain Division was relieved in place by units of the 25th Infantry Division (Light) under command of Major General George A. Fisher Jr. The 25th Infantry Division deployed on 4 January 1995 from their home station of Schofield Barracks, Hawaii and officially assumed command authority from the 10th Division on 9 January 1995. General Fisher and the 25th Infantry Division were the headquarters element of what is officially known as the Multinational Forces, Combined Task Force 190, Republic of Haiti. After the transition from Operation Uphold Democracy, a select few troops were chosen from various 25th Infantry Division units, to redeploy in various Security and Advisory roles in support of the United Nations Mission In Haiti (UNMIH).

The U.S. Army Reserve unit, 458th Transportation Detachment (ATMCT), Belleville, Illinois, was activated and reported to Fort Bragg, North Carolina within 48 hours of notification. This was the fastest a Reserve unit has ever been deployed. The 458th manned the 18th Corps Joint Movement Control Center (JMCC) in support of the mission.

Members of the 450th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) Riverdale, Maryland, USACAPOC(A), (a US Army Reserve unit), were on the initial airborne assault mission of Operation Uphold Democracy. The 450th CA Bn. (A) was the civil affairs unit supporting the 82nd Airborne Division. The unit not only participated with the 82nd, during training operations for this mission, before September 1994, but members of 450th &quot;ready team&quot; were on the C-130 aircraft about to parachute into the country. The parachute jump was aborted within 20 minutes of exiting out the door of the aircraft. The unit returned to Ft. Bragg, and then deployed (air landed) to Haiti the next day, supporting the 10th Mountain Division and Marines. The unit conducted civil affairs operations and remained in the country until December of that year.

===End of operations===

Jean Bertrand Aristide returned to Haiti in October 1994 after 3 years of forced exile. Operation Uphold Democracy officially ended on 31 March 1995, when it was replaced by the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). U.S. President Bill Clinton and Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide presided over the change of authority ceremony. From March 1995 until March 1996, 2,400 U.S. personnel from the original Operation Uphold Democracy remained as a UNMIH-commanded support group under the aegis of Operation New Horizons. A large contingent of U.S. troops (USFORHAITI) participated as peacekeepers in the UNMIH until 1996 (and the U.S. forces commander was also the commander of the U.N. forces). U.N. forces under various mission names were in Haiti from 1995 through 2000. Over the course of the operation one U.S. soldier, a special forces staff sergeant, was killed. The soldier died after being struck by gunfire at a roadside checkpoint.

Three Argentine Navy corvettes of the joined the mission to force the commercial embargo of Haiti.

<text>The Canadian Press (CP; , ) is a Canadian national news agency headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. Established in 1917 as a vehicle for Canadian newspapers to exchange news and information, The Canadian Press has been a private, not-for-profit cooperative owned and operated by its member newspapers for most of its history. In mid-2010, however, it announced plans to become a for-profit business owned by three media companies once certain conditions were met.

Over the years, The Canadian Press and its affiliates have adapted to reflect changes in the media industry, including technological changes and the growing demand for rapid news updates. It currently offers a wide variety of text, audio, photographic, video, and graphic content to websites, radio, television, and commercial clients in addition to newspapers and its longstanding ally, the Associated Press (AP), a global news service based in the United States.

==History==
Initially, Canada had only regional news associations, lacking a national wire service. The Canadian Press was created by an act of Parliament as a news co-operative, with an annual government grant from 1917 to 1924, for the purpose of helping newspapers cover and distribute news across the country. Initially operating as a distribution network, its first editorial staff came on board during World War I to report on the efforts of Canadian soldiers overseas.

In 1940, the Canadian government suspended the broadcast licenses of British United Press and Transradio Press Service both of whom, unlike Canadian Press, sold commercial sponsorships for its news bulletins in violation of government policy. Transport minister C.D. Howe, who was responsible for broadcasting policy, announced that the two wire services must “show their news source is accurate” in order to retain their licenses. After complaints by Transradio that the move was an attempt by “selfish publishing and monopolistic interests … to destroy independent news services throughout the Dominion”, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which at the time was also responsible for regulating private radio broadcasters, agreed to reinstate Transradio&#x27;s and BUP&#x27;s licenses while also announcing a plan to enforce the ban on commercial news broadcasts by editing dispatches by the wire services before they were distributed to radio stations. 

In 1941, CP created a subsidiary, Press News Limited with Sam. G. Ross as manager, to provide wire copy to radio stations to compete with American-owned Transradio Press Service and British United Press, the Canadian subsidiary of United Press. CP and then Press News sold news copy to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation while TPS and BUP sold their copy exclusively to privately-owned commercial broadcasters. In 1944, Press News served 35 of 90 radio stations in Canada, had a five-person staff in Toronto, and an annual budget of . In 1945, CP established a French-language radio news service, the first such wire service for French broadcasters in North America. CP Picture Service was established in 1948, to wire photographs to television stations and newspapers in Canada, instead of the images being mailed via the postal service. The Canadian Press operates in both English and French, the latter service being established in 1951 as .

With the arrival of radio and television, The Canadian Press created Broadcast News (BN) in 1954, a subsidiary to deliver text specifically written for broadcasters. On January 1, 1954, BN replaced Press News. The venture operated in co-operation with private broadcasters, and supplied news reports to privately owned radio and television stations in Canada. Charles Edwards was named the first manager and secretary of BN. In 1956, BN established the first national voice news wire service for broadcasters in Canada, which became BN Voice in 1961, which then served 34 radio stations with national and international news. When Edwards retired in 1971, BN had grown to serve 298 radio and television stations in Canada, and increased to 45 staff and a $2-million budget by 1971. In 1979, CP added network newscasts for subscribing stations.

In 1985, Canadian Press purchased long-time rival British United Press, by then known as United Press Canada, from Sun Media.

The news agency has a staff of more than 180 journalists in its bureaus across Canada, as well as a correspondent in Washington, DC. It had also operated a bureau in London, England, until 2004, has had reporters covering the Canadian mission in Afghanistan since 2002, and delivers news coverage to the West Indies. With its alliance through the Associated Press, there is now a worldwide exchange of news.

Canadian Press Enterprises Inc. is the entity that was to &quot;take over the operations of the &quot;Canadian Press&quot;&quot;, according to a November 2010 article in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. The new board met for the first time on November 29, 2010 to review the operations of The Canadian Press. As of January 2020, Torstar, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and Montreal&#x27;s &quot;La Presse&quot; continued to be the owners of The Canadian Press.

==Operation==
Playing an essential role in the development of Canadian identity, The Canadian Press is wholly dependent on leased telegraphic lines in order to send stories back and forth across the country to their vast number of readers&quot;.&quot; 

In addition to providing news to newspapers, radio, and television, The Canadian Press provides online news and photos. Now, almost every daily newspaper in Canada relies on the service brought forth by The Canadian Press. It introduced this online breaking news service in 1996 and now its multimedia content is published by most major Canadian news websites. The Canadian Press launched breaking news video in 2007, with clips produced specifically for websites and wireless services.

On June 30, 2007, CanWest left The Canadian Press cooperative.

In September 2007, The Canadian Press launched a rebranding campaign in an effort to stay competitive, notably in the wake of the pullout by The CanWest Global&#x27;s newspaper, television and online news outlets (see below). All of its services, including radio networks Broadcast News and Nouvelles télé-radio, were rolled into a single brand: The Canadian Press. The change marked the end of the familiar (CP) service logo.

The Canadian Press also operates the largest online editorial archive of news pictures shot by photojournalists. It was the first in Canada to develop this online archive in 1996 and now it is home to over two million digital images with hundreds of images added each day. These photos appear in newspapers, books and magazines, and online. In addition to news and information, The Canadian Press publishes the &quot;Stylebook&quot; and &quot;Caps and Spelling&quot; book, which are considered the chief style guides for Canadian journalists, public relations professionals, editors, and writers of all disciplines.

Through a longstanding partnership, The Canadian Press is the exclusive distributor of the Associated Press (AP) and Associated Press Television News (APTN) material in Canada. The AP is likewise the exclusive distributor of The Canadian Press in the United States and worldwide.

On March 11, 2009, Sun Media announced that it would also be pulling out of the cooperative.

In July 2010, a tentative deal was struck between The Canadian Press&#x27; three largest stakeholders, CTVglobemedia, Torstar, and Gesca, to transform the newswire from a co-operative into a for-profit entity. On November 26, 2010, Torstar, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, and Square Victoria Communications Group announced they have invested in a new for-profit entity, Canadian Press Enterprises Inc., to take over the operations of The Canadian Press. The change in the ownership structure from a non-profit co-operative to a for-profit private business allowed the company to cover its pension needs and take advantage of future business opportunities, Phillip Crawley, publisher of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, said in an interview, November 26, 2010. The Canadian Press had a serious pension shortfall, which was, in 2010, valued at $34.4 million.

<doc id="532774" wikidata="Q3546388" url="?curid=532774" title="Tysons Corner Center">
<text>Tysons Corner Center is a shopping mall in the unincorporated area of Tysons in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States (between McLean and Vienna, Virginia). It opened to the public in 1968, becoming one of the first fully enclosed, climate-controlled shopping malls in the Washington metropolitan area. The mall&#x27;s anchor department stores are Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom, and Bloomingdale&#x27;s. The mall also features prominent specialty retailers including Everlane, Fabletics, Untuckit, Oak + Fort, Intimissimi, Aesop, and Warby Parker.

Tysons Corner Center is the largest mall in the Baltimore-Washington area, and the 8th largest in the United States. The mall is located from the central business district of Washington D.C., and neighbors a second mall, Tysons Galleria, across Chain Bridge Road. To distinguish the two, some people refer to Tysons Corner Center as &quot;Tysons I,&quot; and Tysons Galleria as &quot;Tysons II.&quot;

==History==

Tysons Corner Center was one of the first super-regional malls in the country, drawing customers from a multi-state area. The mall was built as a follow-on partnership by Isadore Gudelsky and Theodore Lerner&#x27;s Wheaton Plaza which opened in 1960. On May 31, 1962, the $20 million project was awarded to Lerner-Gudelsky by a 4–2 vote against James Rouse&#x27;s Rouse Company with a controversial vote by William H Moss, a County supervisor who also worked for Gudelsky&#x27;s District Title Insurance Company.

The 1.2 million square feet (110,000 m2) one-story mall opened on July 25, 1968, with just 35 of its 100 stores open and just two of its three department store anchors, Hecht&#x27;s and Woodward &amp; Lothrop. The third anchor department store, Lansburgh&#x27;s, did not open until a year later, on October 19, 1969, due to a lawsuit involving an exchange of its lease for favorable zoning. The finished mall contained 100 specialty stores, including Jelleff&#x27;s and discount chain Woolworth&#x27;s, which operated a store in the mall until the entire chain went under in 1997.

Lansburgh&#x27;s closed in 1973, when City Stores shuttered the entire chain. They rebranded the building as another of their stores, Lit Brothers, from 1973 to 1975. The building was then renovated as the first full-line branch of Bloomingdale&#x27;s outside of New York City, reopening on September 9, 1976.

The mall was originally designed around five themed &quot;courts&quot;: the Umbrella Court in front of Lansburgh&#x27;s, the Fashion Court, the Fountain Court in front of Hechts, the Aviary Court and the Clock Court located near Woodward &amp; Lothrop. Some of the few remaining pieces of the original infrastructure of the 1968 mall are the escalators that serve the second and third floor of Bloomingdale&#x27;s (the original Lansburgh&#x27;s escalators), and the original passenger and freight elevators from Woodward &amp; Lothrop/JCPenney. Both are still in operation, however they are located in the back hallways and used as service elevators.

In 1988, the mall was expanded to add a second floor, at which time Lord &amp; Taylor and Nordstrom opened; this was the first Nordstrom east of the Mississippi River. In 1995, Woodward &amp; Lothrop closed and was converted to JCPenney, which closed 10 years later in 2005. The anchor store building was gutted and expanded and converted into two additional levels of mall space, anchored by a 16-screen AMC multiplex movie theater, Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers, and Old Navy.

Today, the mall has 2.1 million square feet (195,000 m2) of retail space on three levels, 16 movie screens, and nearly 300 stores. From its opening until the 1990s, the mall contained a wide and diverse retail mix. Hot Shoppes cafeteria also occupied space in the mall until 1998. These types of stores shared space with higher-end tenants such as Liz Claiborne and A/X Armani Exchange. In the 2000s, under the ownership of Wilmorite Properties, the mall re-tenanted and has served as the primary launchpad location for a number of successful retail chains. LL Bean opened its first full line department store outside of its Freeport, Maine headquarters in 2000. Apple opened the first of its retail stores at Tysons in 2001. Martin + Osa and Cusp by Neiman Marcus opened in 2006. MNG By Mango made their U.S. debut at Tysons in 2006 as well, but that store has since closed. In 2007, Canadian-based clothing retailer Garage opened its first U.S. store at Tysons. Many retailers have flagship stores at the mall, including Pottery Barn and Victoria&#x27;s Secret.

Soon after Tysons Corner Center was constructed, the land surrounding the area — previously consisting of farms and rural residences — became prime real estate, prompting the construction of hotels, office buildings, and apartment complexes. Major retailers near Tysons Corner Center include Crate &amp; Barrel, Tiffany &amp; Co., Hermes Paris, Louis Vuitton, and Gucci, some of which are located in Fairfax Square.

As part of the upcoming &quot;Tysons Future&quot; renovation and expansion plans, a glass elevator has been added to the Fashion Court (where the Nordstrom wing meets the main mall hallway), which opened on November 28, 2008.

In 2004 The Macerich Company acquired Wilmorite Properties, adding Tysons Corner Center to its portfolio. Tyson&#x27;s Corner Center was a particularly significant expansion as the plans were well under way for a massive mixed-use development creating a more urban environment.

In 2013, Tysons Corner Center was assessed for $1 billion, making it by far the most valuable property in the metropolitan area.

On January 19, 2020, the Lord &amp; Taylor anchor store closed. On December 28, 2021, Macerich, the mall development firm, announced plans to redevelop the empty store into either a 330-foot, 540,000 square feet office tower, or a 400-foot tower with a mix of office and residential space. Both options would include 50,000 square feet of retail centered around the plaza.

The mall&#x27;s L.L. Bean store closed on January 17, 2022. Macerich reconstructed the space into multiple smaller in-line stores.

On May 19, 2023, Apple relocated to a new location in the mall, on the 22nd anniversary of the first store&#x27;s opening.

By 2023, since the government lockdown, Tyson&#x27;s Corner Center had announced several new additions. Among them are UpWest, Kendra Scott, Everlane, Primark, Purple, Oak + Fort, CAMP, ThirdLove, The Lexus Experience, Lovisa, Cotton On, Dr. Martens, in addition to entirely new store formats for the Apple Store and Lululemon Athletica.

===Notable openings===

==Plans==

The Washington Metro Silver Line had been extended west to Tysons, and has since been extended to Dulles International Airport and beyond. The Tysons station on the Silver Line is on the north side of the shopping center where Tysons Boulevard crosses State Route 123 (Chain Bridge Road). There are four stations in the Tysons area. Utility relocation for the project began in 2008. The Silver Line opened July 26, 2014.

The Macerich Company, who acquired owner Wilmorite Properties in 2005, is developing Tysons Corner Center into a community location. There will be expansions for residential and commercial buildings, along with a hotel. There will also be slight expansions to the mall. The project will be completed in four stages and it is expected to be finished in 10 to 15 years, adding of office, residential, and retail space.

<doc id="532782" wikidata="Q508880" url="?curid=532782" title="Aloha">
<text>Aloha ( , ) is the Hawaiian word for love, affection, peace, compassion and mercy, that is commonly used as a greeting. It has a deeper cultural and spiritual significance to native Hawaiians, for whom the term is used to define a force that holds together existence.

The word is found in all Polynesian languages and always with the same basic meaning of &quot;love, compassion, sympathy, kindness.&quot; Its use in Hawaii has a seriousness lacking in the Tahitian and Samoan meanings. Mary Kawena Pukui wrote that the &quot;first expression&quot; of &quot;aloha&quot; was between a parent and child.

Lorrin Andrews wrote the first Hawaiian dictionary, called &quot;A Dictionary of the Hawaiian Language&quot;. In it, he describes &quot;aloha&quot; as &quot;A word expressing different feelings: love, affection, gratitude, kindness, pity, compassion, grief, the modern common salutation at meeting; parting&quot;. Mary Kawena Pukui and Samuel Hoyt Elbert&#x27;s &quot;Hawaiian Dictionary: Hawaiian-English, English-Hawaiian&quot; also contains a similar definition. Anthropologist Francis Newton states that &quot;Aloha is a complex and profound sentiment. Such emotions defy definition&quot;. Anna Wierzbicka concludes that the term has &quot;no equivalent in English&quot;.

The word aloha is hard to translate into any other language because it comprises complex ways of being and of interacting with and loving all of creation. An ethic of care and respect for all people and all elements of the land is wrapped up in aloha; it is a way of showing connection and reverence. Queen Liliʻuokalani is known to have said, &quot;Aloha is to learn what is not said, to see what cannot be seen, and to know the unknowable&quot;. 

Another way to interpret &quot;aloha&quot; is as an energy exchange — the giving and receiving of positive energy is the spirit of aloha. As we create positive thoughts and interactions, they ripple out into the world and are merged and multiplied with the actions and energy of others. Aloha has been described as the coordination of the heart and mind to foster connectivity and peace. 

The state of Hawaii introduced the Aloha Spirit law in 1986, which mandates that state officials and judges treat the public with Aloha. 

The University of Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s Center for Labor Education and Research resorts the statute of the Spirit of Aloha which breaks down the concept into an acronym using each of the letters of the word:

&quot;&#x27;Akahai,&#x27; meaning kindness, to be expressed with tenderness;

&#x27;Lōkahi,&#x27; meaning unity, to be expressed with harmony;

&#x27;ʻOluʻolu,&#x27; meaning agreeable, to be expressed with pleasantness;

&#x27;Haʻahaʻa,&#x27; meaning humility, to be expressed with modesty;

&#x27;Ahonui,&#x27; meaning patience, to be expressed with perseverance.&quot; 

== Etymology ==
&quot;Aloha&quot; was borrowed from the Hawaiian &quot;aloha&quot; to the English language. The Hawaiian word has evolved from the Proto-Polynesian greeting &quot;,&quot; which also meant &quot;love, pity, or compassion&quot;. It is further thought to be evolved from Proto-Oceanic root &quot;*qarop(-i)&quot; meaning &quot;feel pity, empathy, be sorry for&quot;, which in turn descends from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian &quot;*harep.&quot;

&quot;Aloha&quot; has numerous cognates in other Polynesian languages, such as &quot;talofa&quot; in Samoan, &quot;ta&#x27;alofa&quot; in Tuvaluan, and &quot;aro&#x27;a&quot; in Cook Islands Māori. The Māori word aroha, with Aroha being a given name is also descended from the Proto-Polynesian root.

&quot;Aloha&quot; is derived from Proto-Polynesian roots &quot;alo,&quot; meaning &#x27;presence&#x27; or &#x27;face&#x27; and &quot;ha,&quot; meaning &#x27;breath,&#x27; making the literal meaning something close to &#x27;the presence of breath.&#x27; or &#x27;the face of breath&#x27;

<doc id="532787" wikidata="Q3196863" url="?curid=532787" title="Calibration curve">
<text>In analytical chemistry, a calibration curve, also known as a standard curve, is a general method for determining the concentration of a substance in an unknown sample by comparing the unknown to a set of standard samples of known concentration. A calibration curve is one approach to the problem of instrument calibration; other standard approaches may mix the standard into the unknown, giving an internal standard. The calibration curve is a plot of how the instrumental response, the so-called analytical signal, changes with the concentration of the analyte (the substance to be measured).

==General use==
In more general use, a calibration curve is a curve or table for a measuring instrument which measures some parameter indirectly, giving values for the desired quantity as a function of values of sensor output. For example, a calibration curve can be made for a particular pressure transducer to determine applied pressure from transducer output (a voltage). Such a curve is typically used when an instrument uses a sensor whose calibration varies from one sample to another, or changes with time or use; if sensor output is consistent the instrument would be marked directly in terms of the measured unit.

== Method ==
The operator prepares a series of standards across a range of concentrations near the expected concentration of analyte in the unknown. The concentrations of the standards must lie within the working range of the technique (instrumentation) they are using. Analyzing each of these standards using the chosen technique will produce a series of measurements. For most analyses a plot of instrument response vs. concentration will show a linear relationship. The operator can measure the response of the unknown and, using the calibration curve, can &quot;interpolate&quot; to find the concentration of analyte.

The data – the concentrations of the analyte and the instrument response for each standard – can be fit to a straight line, using linear regression analysis. This yields a model described by the equation &quot;y = mx + y0&quot;, where y is the instrument response, m represents the sensitivity, and y0 is a constant that describes the background. The analyte concentration (x) of unknown samples may be calculated from this equation.

Many different variables can be used as the analytical signal. For instance, chromium (III) might be measured using a chemiluminescence method, in an instrument that contains a photomultiplier tube (PMT) as the detector. The detector converts the light produced by the sample into a voltage, which increases with intensity of light. The amount of light measured is the analytical signal.

=== Example ===

The Bradford assay is a colorimetric assay that measures protein concentration. The reagent Coomassie brilliant blue turns blue when it binds to arginine and aromatic amino acids present in proteins, thus increasing the absorbance of the sample. The absorbance is measured using a spectrophotometer, at the maximum absorbance frequency (Amax) of the blue dye (which is 595 nm). In this case, the greater the absorbance, the higher the protein concentration.

Data for known concentrations of protein are used to make the standard curve, plotting concentration on the X axis, and the assay measurement on the Y axis. The same assay is then performed with samples of unknown concentration. To analyze the data, one locates the measurement on the Y-axis that corresponds to the assay measurement of the unknown substance and follows a line to intersect the standard curve. The corresponding value on the X-axis is the concentration of substance in the unknown sample.

=== Error calculation ===
As expected, the concentration of the unknown will have some error which can be calculated from the formula below. This formula assumes that a linear relationship is observed for all the standards. It is important to note that the error in the concentration will be minimal if the signal from the unknown lies in the middle of the signals of all the standards (the term formula_1 goes to zero if formula_2)

formula_3

*formula_4, is the standard deviation in the residuals
*formula_5 is the slope of the line
*formula_6 is the y-intercept of the line
*formula_7 is the number of standards
*formula_8 is the number of replicate unknowns
*formula_9 is the measurement of the unknown
*formula_10 is the average measurement of the standards
*formula_11 are the concentrations of the standards
*formula_12 is the average concentration of the standards

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Most analytical techniques use a calibration curve. There are a number of advantages to this approach. First, the calibration curve provides a reliable way to calculate the uncertainty of the concentration calculated from the calibration curve (using the statistics of the least squares line fit to the data).

Second, the calibration curve provides data on an empirical relationship. The mechanism for the instrument&#x27;s response to the analyte may be predicted or understood according to some theoretical model, but most such models have limited value for real samples. (Instrumental response is usually highly dependent on the condition of the analyte, solvents used and impurities it may contain; it could also be affected by external factors such as pressure and temperature.)

Many theoretical relationships, such as fluorescence, require the determination of an instrumental constant anyway, by analysis of one or more reference standards; a calibration curve is a convenient extension of this approach. The calibration curve for a particular analyte in a particular (type of) sample provides the empirical relationship needed for those particular measurements.

The chief disadvantages are (1) that the standards require a supply of the analyte material, preferably of high purity and in known concentration, and (2) that the standards and the unknown are in the same matrix. Some analytes – e.g., particular proteins – are extremely difficult to obtain pure in sufficient quantity. Other analytes are often in complex matrices, e.g., heavy metals in pond water. In this case, the matrix may interfere with or attenuate the signal of the analyte. Therefore, a comparison between the standards (which contain no interfering compounds) and the unknown is not possible. The method of standard addition is a way to handle such a situation.

== Applications ==
*Analysis of concentration
*Verifying the proper functioning of an analytical instrument or a sensor device such as an ion selective electrode
*Determining the basic effects of a control treatment (such as a dose-survival curve in clonogenic assay)

<doc id="532788" wikidata="Q770621" url="?curid=532788" title="Augustus Seymour Porter">
<text>Augustus Seymour Porter (January 18, 1798September 18, 1872) was a U.S. statesman from the state of Michigan.

==Early life==
He was born in Canandaigua, New York, the son of Augustus Porter (1769–1849) and his first wife, Lavinia Steele. His brothers were Albert Howell Porter (1801-1888) and Peter Buell Porter, Jr. (1806–1871), and his uncle was Peter Buell Porter (1773–1844), the United States Secretary of War under John Quincy Adams.

He attended Canandaigua Academy, and graduated from Union College, in Schenectady, New York, in 1818, studied law and was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Detroit, Michigan.

==Career==
Porter became the recorder of Detroit in 1830 and was the treasurer of the Michigan Pioneer Society in 1837. He was elected mayor of Detroit in 1838, resigning in 1839 to run for the United States Senate, and was succeeded as mayor by Asher B. Bates on March 14, 1839.

He was elected as a Whig to the United States Senate, and served from January 20, 1840, until March 3, 1845. He did not run for reelection in 1844. He was chairman of the Committee on Roads and Canals, 1841–1845, and was on the Committee on Enrolled Bills, 1841–1843.

==Personal life==
On July 25, 1822, he married Sarah A. Mansfield (d. 1824). Mansfield died a few months after the birth of Porter&#x27;s only son:

* Samuel M. Porter (b. 1824), who died in youth.

On September 24, 1832, he married his second wife, Sarah G. Barnard (1807–1885), his cousin and the daughter of Robert Foster Barnard (1784–1850) and Augusta Porter (1786–1833). Sarah was the sister of Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard (1809–1889), a Columbia University President, and Gen. John G. Barnard (1815–1882). She was also a niece of Senator Henry Clay (1777–1852). Together, they had:

* Jane A. Porter (b. 1833)
* Sarah Frederica Porter (b. 1836), who married Stephen E. Burrall (1826–1868), in 1863, and who lived in London in 1885.

In 1848, he moved to his father&#x27;s residence, in Niagara Falls, New York, and died there on September 18, 1872. He is interred in Oakwood Cemetery in Niagara Falls, New York. Sarah died at Newport, Isle of Wight on April 30, 1885.

===Descendants===
Through his youngest daughter, he was the grandfather of Guy Augustus Porter–Burrall (1865–1890), a Cambridge University lawyer and Lieutenant in the British Army, and Stephen E. Porter–Burrall (1868–1896), an 1883 Eton College graduate. The family assumed the name of Porter–Burrall, by letters patent from Queen Victoria, on August 16, 1886.

<text>Wheelchair rugby (originally murderball, and known as quad rugby in the United States) is a team sport for athletes with a disability. It is practiced in over twenty-five countries around the world and is a summer Paralympic sport.

The US name is based on the requirement that all wheelchair rugby players need to have disabilities that include at least some loss of function in at least three limbs. Although most have spinal cord injuries, players may also qualify through multiple amputations, neurological disorders or other medical conditions. Players are assigned a functional level in points, and each team is limited to fielding a team with a total of eight points.

Wheelchair rugby is played indoors on a hardwood court, and physical contact between wheelchairs is an integral part of the game. The rules include elements from wheelchair basketball, ice hockey, handball and rugby union.

The sport is governed by the International Wheelchair Rugby Federation (IWRF) which was established in 1993.

==History==

Wheelchair rugby was created to be a sport for persons with quadriplegia in 1976 by five Canadian wheelchair athletes, Gerry Terwin, Duncan Campbell, Randy Dueck, Paul LeJeune and Chris Sargent, in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

At that time, wheelchair basketball was the most common team sport for wheelchair users. That sport&#x27;s physical requirement for players to dribble and shoot baskets relegated quadriplegic athletes, with functional impairments to both their upper limbs and lower limbs, to supporting roles. The new sport—originally called &quot;murderball&quot; due to its aggressive, full-contact nature—was designed to allow quadriplegic athletes with a wide range of functional ability levels to play integral offensive and defensive roles.

Murderball was first introduced into Australia in 1982. The Australian team competing in the Stoke Mandeville games in England were invited by the Canadians to select a team to play them in a demonstration game. After receiving limited instructions on the rules and skills of the game the &quot;contest&quot; began. Following a fast and very competitive exchange, Australia won. The game was then born and brought back to Australia where it has flourished.

Murderball was introduced to the United States in 1979 by Brad Mikkelsen. With the aid of the University of North Dakota&#x27;s Disabled Student Services, he formed the first American team, the Wallbangers. The first North American competition was held in 1982.

In the late 1980s, the name of the sport outside the United States was officially changed from &quot;Murderball&quot; to &quot;Wheelchair Rugby&quot;. In the United States, the sport&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Quad Rugby&quot;.

The first international tournament was held in 1989 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with teams from Canada, the United States and Great Britain. In 1990, Wheelchair Rugby first appeared at the International Stoke Mandeville Games as an exhibition event, and in 1993 the sport was recognized as an official international sport for athletes with a disability by the International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation (ISMWSF). In the same year, the International Wheelchair Rugby Federation (IWRF) was established as a sports section of ISMWSF to govern the sport. The first IWRF World Wheelchair Rugby Championships were held in Nottwil, Switzerland, in 1995 and wheelchair rugby appeared as a demonstration sport at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta.

The sport has had full medal status since the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, Australia, and there are now twenty-five active countries in international competition, with several others developing the sport.

==Rules==

Wheelchair rugby is mostly played by two teams of up to twelve players. Only four players from each team may be on the court at any time. It is a mixed-gender sport, and both male and female athletes play on the same teams.

Wheelchair rugby is played indoors on a hardwood court of the same measurements as a regulation basketball court—28 metres long by 15 metres wide. The required court markings are a centre line and circle, and a key area measuring 8 metres wide by 1.75 metres deep at each end of the court.

The goal line is the section of the end line within the key. Each end of the goal line is marked with a cone-shaped pylon. Players score by carrying the ball across the goal line. For a goal to count, two wheels of the player&#x27;s wheelchair must cross the line while the player has possession of the ball.

A team is not allowed to have more than three players in their own key while they are defending their goal line. Offensive players are not permitted to remain in the opposing team&#x27;s key for more than ten seconds.

A player with possession of the ball must bounce or pass the ball within ten seconds.

A team&#x27;s back court is the half of the court containing the goal they are defending; their front court is the half containing the goal they are attacking. Teams have twelve seconds to advance the ball from their back court into the front court and a total of forty seconds to score a point or concede possession.

Physical contact between wheelchairs is permitted, and forms a major part of the game. However, physical contact between wheelchairs that is deemed dangerous—such as striking another player from behind—is not allowed. Direct physical contact between players is not permitted.

Fouls are penalized by either a one-minute penalty, for defensive fouls and technical fouls, or a loss of possession, for offensive fouls. In some cases, a penalty goal may be awarded in lieu of a penalty. Common fouls include &quot;spinning&quot; (striking an opponent&#x27;s wheelchair behind the main axle, causing it to spin horizontally or vertically), &quot;illegal use of hands&quot; or &quot;reaching in&quot; (striking an opponent with the arms or hands), and &quot;holding&quot; (holding or obstructing an opponent by grasping with the hands or arms, or falling onto them).

Wheelchair rugby games consist of four eight-minute quarters. If the game is tied at the end of regulation play, three-minute overtime periods are played.

Much like able-bodied rugby matches, highly competitive wheelchair rugby games are fluid and fast-moving, with possession switching back and forth between the teams while play continues. The game clock is stopped when a goal is scored or in the event of a violation—such as the ball being played out of bounds—or a foul. Players may only be substituted during a stoppage in play.

===Tries===
Goals (see above under Rules) are sometimes called &quot;tries&quot;.

==Equipment==
Wheelchair rugby is played in a manual wheelchair. The rules include detailed specifications for the wheelchair. Players use custom-made sports wheelchairs that are specifically designed for wheelchair rugby. Key design features include a front bumper, designed to help strike and hold opposing wheelchairs, and wings, which are positioned in front of the main wheels to make the wheelchair more difficult to stop and hold. All wheelchairs must be equipped with spoke protectors, to prevent damage to the wheels, and an anti-tip device at the back.

New players and players in developing countries sometimes play in wheelchairs that have been adapted for wheelchair rugby by the addition of temporary bumpers and wings.

Wheelchair rugby uses a regulation volleyball typically of a &#x27;soft-touch&#x27; design, with a slightly textured surface to provide a better grip. The balls are normally over-inflated compared to volleyball, to provide a better bounce. The official ball of the sport from 2013 to 2016 is the Molten soft-touch volleyball, model number WR58X.
Players use a variety of other personal equipment, such as gloves and applied adhesives to assist with ball handling due to their usually impaired gripping ability, and various forms of strapping to maintain a good seating position.

==Classification==

To be eligible to play wheelchair rugby, athletes must have some form of disability with a loss of function in both the upper limbs and lower limbs. The majority of wheelchair rugby athletes have spinal cord injuries at the level of their cervical vertebrae. Other eligible players have multiple amputations, polio, or neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy, some forms of muscular dystrophy, or Guillain–Barré syndrome, among other medical conditions.

Players are classified according to their functional level and assigned a point value ranging from 0.5 (the lowest functional level) to 3.5 (the highest). The total classification value of all players on the court for a team at one time cannot exceed eight points.

The classification process begins with an assessment of the athlete&#x27;s level of disability to determine if the minimum eligibility requirements for wheelchair rugby are met. These require that an athlete have a neurological disability that involves at least three limbs, or a non-neurological disability that involves all four limbs. The athlete then completes a series of muscle tests designed to evaluate the strength and range of motion of the upper limbs and trunks. A classification can then be assigned to the athlete. Classification frequently includes subsequent observation of the athlete in competition to confirm that physical function in game situations reflects what was observed during muscle testing.

Athletes are permitted to appeal their classification if they feel they have not been properly evaluated. Athletes can be granted a permanent classification if they demonstrate a stable level of function over a series of classification tests.

Wheelchair rugby classification is conducted by personnel with medical training, usually physicians, physiotherapists, or occupational therapists. Classifiers must also be trained in muscle testing and in the details of wheelchair rugby classification.

==Active countries==

 there are thirty-one active countries playing wheelchair rugby and twenty-six more developing national teams, divided into three zones:

==International competitions==
The major wheelchair rugby international competitions are Zone Championships, held in each odd-numbered year, and the World Championships held quadrennially in even-numbered years. Wheelchair rugby is also an included sport in regional events such as the Parapan American Games.

Since 2000, it has been one of the sports of the Summer Paralympic Games.

In July 2022, the World Games in Birmingham, Alabama hosted six teams to compete: Japan, USA, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and Great Britain. These games had been postponed from 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

==Variations==
The paralympic version of wheelchair rugby has been adapted with new variations on the rules developed. These variations have broadened the classification system to allow players with higher functionality to compete.

===Invictus Games===
Team size reduces from 12 in the preliminary rounds to 10 in the semi-finals and final.
Classifications in three categories: 
* &quot;Maximum&quot; players (1 point) - roughly in line with classification for the paralympic version of the game
* &quot;Moderate&quot; players (2 points) - players with functional or physical impairments (eg all leg amputees (single and double) or significant balance issues (e.g. player must walk with assistive devices) )
* &quot;Open&quot; players (3 points) - players with minor or non-permanent physical disabilities and other illnesses (e.g. PTSD, TBI, minor orthopedic injuries)
A maximum of 10 points from 4 players can be played on court at any time.

===Wheelchair Rugby 5s===
The 5s version of wheelchair rugby was developed in the UK by Great Britain Wheelchair Rugby in 2017. The game was officially adopted by World Wheelchair Rugby in June 2021.
Like the Invictus variation, the 5s game widens eligibility.
Team size remains at 12.
Classifications in broad groups:
* 0.5 - Paralympic wheelchair rugby classifications from 0.5-1.5
* 1.0 - Paralympic wheelchair rugby classifications from 2.0-3.5
* 1.5 - GBWR Paralympic classification of 4.0 and players with an impairment in one upper limb
* 2.0 - Players with an impairment in both lower limbs
* 3.0 - Players with an impairment in one lower limb
* 4.0 - Players with a diagnosed pain related impairment (GBWR only)
A maximum of 10 points from 5 players can be played on the court at any time.

==In popular culture==
Wheelchair rugby was featured in the Oscar-nominated 2005 documentary &quot;Murderball&quot;. It was voted the #1 Top Sport Movie of all time by the movie review website Rotten Tomatoes.

The character Jason Street in the NBC television show &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;, having been paralyzed in a game of American football in the pilot, tries out for the United States quad rugby team in a later episode.

<doc id="532793" wikidata="Q575898" url="?curid=532793" title="Religion in the United States">
<text>Religion in the United States is both widespread and diverse, with higher reported levels of belief than other wealthy Western nations. Polls indicate that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a higher power (2021), engage in spiritual practices (2022), and consider themselves religious or spiritual (2017). 

Christianity is the most widely professed religion, with the majority of Americans being Evangelicals, Mainline Protestants, or Catholics, although its dominance 
has declined in recent decades, and as of 2012 Protestants no longer formed a majority in the US. The United States has the largest Christian and Protestant population in the world. Judaism is the second-largest religion in the US, practiced by 2% of the population, followed by Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam, each with 1% of the population. States vary in religiosity from Mississippi, where 63% of adults self-describe as very religious, to New Hampshire where 20% do. The elected legislators of Congress overwhelmingly identify as religious and Christian; with few exceptions, both the Republican and Democratic parties nominate those who are. Religious figures (Carrie Nation, William Jennings Bryan, Martin Luther King Jr., Wallace Fard Muhammad, Jimmy Carter, Jerry Falwell), have played a significant role in American politics.

Among the historical and social characteristics of the United States that some scholars of religion credit for the country&#x27;s high level of religiousness include its Constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion and legal tradition of separation of church and state; the early immigration of religious dissenters from Northwestern Europe (Anglicans, Quakers, Mennonites, and other mainline Protestants); the religious revivalism of the first (1730s and 1740s), and second (1790s and 1840s) Great Awakenings, which led to an enormous growth in Christian congregations—from 10% of Americans being members before the Awakenings, to 80% belonging after. 

The aftermath led to what historian Martin Marty calls the &quot;Evangelical Empire&quot;, a period in which evangelicals dominated US cultural institutions. They supported (and opposed) measures to abolish slavery, further women&#x27;s rights, enact prohibition, and reform education and criminal justice. New Protestant denominations were formed (Adventism, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, the Latter Day Saint movement (Mormonism), Churches of Christ and Church of Christ, Scientist, Unitarian and Universalist, Pentecostalism). Outside of Protestantism, an unprecedented number of Catholic and Jewish immigrants arrived in the United States during the immigrant waves of the mid to late 19th and 20th century. 

Social scientists have noted that beginning in the early 1990s, the percentage of Americans professing no religious affiliation began to rise from 6% in 1991 to 29% in 2021 — with younger people having higher rates of unaffiliation. Similarly, polling indicated a decline in church attendance, and the number of people agreeing with the statement that religion is &quot;very important&quot; in their lives. Explanations for this trend include lack of trust in numerous institutions, backlash against the religious right in the 1980s, sexual abuse scandals in established religions, the end of the Cold War (and its connection of religiosity with patriotism), and the September 11 attacks (by religious Jihadists). Many of the &quot;Nones&quot;, those without a religious affiliation, have belief in a god or higher power and spiritual forces beyond the natural world.

Ever since its early colonial days, when some Protestant dissenter English and German settlers moved in search of religious freedom, America has been profoundly influenced by religion. Throughout its history, religious involvement among American citizens has grown since 1776 from 17% of the US population to 62% in 2000. Approximately 35-40 percent of Americans regularly attended religious services from eighteenth-century colonial America up to 1940. That influence continues in American culture, social life, and politics. Several of the original Thirteen Colonies were established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion within a community of like-minded people: the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established by English Puritans (Congregationalists), Pennsylvania by British Quakers, Maryland by English Catholics, and Virginia by English Anglicans. Despite these, and as a result of intervening religious strife and preference in England the Plantation Act 1740 would set official policy for new immigrants coming to British America until the American Revolution. While most settlers and colonists during this time were Protestant, a few early Catholic and Jewish settlers also arrived from Northwestern Europe into the colonies; however, their numbers were very slight compared to the Protestant majority. Even in the &quot;Catholic Proprietary&quot; or colony of Maryland, the vast majority of Maryland colonists were Protestant by 1670.

The text of the First Amendment in the US Constitution states that &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot; It guarantees the free exercise of religion while also preventing the government from establishing a state religion. However, the states were not bound by the provision, and as late as the 1830s Massachusetts provided tax money to local Congregational churches. Since the 1940s, the Supreme Court has interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment as applying the First Amendment to state and local governments.

President John Adams and a unanimous Senate endorsed the Treaty of Tripoli in 1797 that stated: &quot;the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.&quot;

Expert researchers and authors have referred to the United States as a &quot;Protestant nation&quot; or &quot;founded on Protestant principles&quot;, specifically emphasizing its Calvinist heritage.

The modern official motto of the United States of America, as established in a 1956 law signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, is &quot;In God We Trust&quot;. The phrase first appeared on US coins in 1864.

According to a 2002 survey by the Pew Research Center, nearly 6 in 10 Americans said that religion plays an important role in their lives, compared to 33% in Great Britain, 27% in Italy, 21% in Germany, 12% in Japan, and 11% in France. The survey report stated that the results showed America having a greater similarity to developing nations (where higher percentages say that religion plays an important role) than to other wealthy nations, where religion plays a minor role.

In 1963, 90% of US adults claimed to be Christians while only 2% professed no religious identity. In 2016, 73.7% identified as Christians while 18.2% claimed no religious affiliation. In 2019, Pew Research Center survey report concluded that &quot;the religiously unaffiliated share of the population, consisting of people who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or &#x27;nothing in particular,&#x27; now stands at 26%, up from 17% in 2009&quot; and that &quot;both Protestantism and Catholicism are experiencing losses of population share.&quot; Many of the unaffiliated retain religious beliefs or practices without affiliating. There have been variant proposed explanations for secularization including lack of trust in the labor market, with government, in marriage and in other aspects of life, backlash against the religious right in the 1980s, sexual abuse scandals, particularly those within the Southern Baptist Convention and Catholic Church. 

Other signs of a decline in religiosity include a decline in the percentage of respondents who say religion is &quot;very important&quot; in their lives compared to those who say it is not (the answer &quot;very important&quot; falling from 70% in 1965 to 45% in 2023, and &quot;not very important&quot; rising from 7 to 28% over the same period in Gallup polls), and a decline in church attendance (those who report attending church monthly or more often having declined from 52% to 45% from 2007 to 2018, according to a Pew Research Center survey). Still other sources insist Americans are becoming more religious, and surveys showing otherwise suffer from methodological deficiencies.

==Freedom of religion==
According to the American legal scholar and academic Noah Feldman, the United States federal government was the first government to be designed with no established religion at all. However, some states had established religions within their borders until the 1830s.

Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, the framers of the Constitution rejected any religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise, thus protecting any religious organization, institution, or denomination from government interference. The decision was mainly influenced by European Rationalist and Protestant ideals, but was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them.

==Christianity==
The most popular religion in the United States is Christianity, comprising the majority of the population (73.7% of adults in 2016), with the majority of American Christians belonging to a Protestant denomination or a Protestant offshoot (such as the Latter Day Saint movement or the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses). According to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies newsletter published March 2017, based on data from 2010, Christians were the largest religious population in all 3,143 counties in the country. Roughly 48.9% of Americans are Protestants, 23.0% are Catholics, 1.8% are Mormons (members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). Christianity was introduced during the period of European colonization. The United States has the world&#x27;s largest Christian population.

According to membership statistics from current reports and official web sites, the five largest Christian denominations are:
* The Catholic Church in the United States, 71,000,000 members
* The Southern Baptist Convention, 13,680,493 members
* The National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., 8,415,100 members
* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6,920,086 members
* The United Methodist Church, 5,714,815 members

The Southern Baptist Convention, with over 13 million adherents, is the largest of more than 200 distinctly named Protestant denominations. In 2007, members of evangelical churches comprised 26% of the American population, while another 18% belonged to mainline Protestant churches, and 7% belonged to historically black churches.

A 2015 study estimates some 450,000 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.

===Protestant denominations===
Beginning around 1600, Northwestern European settlers introduced the Anglican and Puritan religion, as well as Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Quaker, and Moravian denominations. Historians agree that members of mainline Protestant denominations have played leadership roles in many aspects of American life, including politics, business, science, the arts, and education. They founded most of the country&#x27;s leading institutes of higher education. According to Harriet Zuckerman, 72% of American Nobel Prize laureates between 1901 and 1972, have identified from Protestant background.

Traditionally Episcopalians and Presbyterians tended to be wealthier and better educated than most other religious groups, and numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and Astors, Rockefeller, Du Pont, Roosevelt, Forbes, Fords, Whitneys, Morgans and Harrimans were Mainline Protestant families, although 2015/2016 (Pew) studies found households affiliated with Judaism and Hinduism to be more likely to have incomes over $100,000 per year than those in the mainline tradition Protestants, with other American religious groups having lower median incomes.

Some of the first colleges and universities in America, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Dartmouth, Pennsylvania, Duke, Boston, Williams, Bowdoin, Middlebury, and Amherst, all were founded by mainline Protestant denominations. By the 1920s most had weakened or dropped their formal connection with a denomination. James Hunter argues:
:The private schools and colleges established by the mainline Protestant denominations, as a rule, still want to be known as places that foster values, but few will go so far as to identify those values as Christian... Overall, the distinctiveness of mainline Protestant identity has largely dissolved since the 1960s.

===Great Awakenings and other Protestant descendants===
Several Christian groups were founded in America during the Great Awakenings. Interdenominational evangelicalism and Pentecostalism emerged; new Protestant denominations such as Adventism; non-denominational movements such as the Restoration Movement (which over time separated into the Churches of Christ, the Christian churches and churches of Christ, and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)); Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (called &quot;Bible Students&quot; in the latter part of the 19th century); and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism).

===Catholicism===
While the Puritans were securing their Commonwealth, members of the Catholic Church in England were also planning a refuge, &quot;for they too were being persecuted on account of their religion.&quot; Among those interested in providing a refuge for Catholics was the second Lord of Baltimore, George Calvert, who established Maryland, a &quot;Catholic Proprietary&quot;, in 1634, more than sixty years after the founding of the Spanish Florida mission of St. Augustine. The first US Catholic university, Georgetown University, was founded in 1789. Though small in number in the beginning, Catholicism grew over the centuries to become the largest single denomination in the United States, primarily through immigration, but also through the acquisition of continental territories under the jurisdiction of French and Spanish Catholic powers. Though the European Catholic and indigenous population of these former territories were small, the material cultures there, the original mission foundations with their canonical Catholic names, are still recognized today (as they were formerly known) in any number of cities in California, New Mexico and Louisiana. (The most recognizable cities of California, for example, are named after Catholic saints.)

While Catholic Americans were present in small numbers early in United States history, both in Maryland and in the former French and Spanish colonies that were eventually absorbed into the United States, the vast majority of Catholics in the United States today derive from unprecedented waves of immigration from primarily Catholic countries and regions (Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom until 1921 and German unification didn&#x27;t officially occur until 1871) during the mid-to-late 19th and 20th century. Irish, Hispanic, Italian, Portuguese, French Canadian, Polish, German, and Lebanese (Maronite) immigrants largely contributed to the growth in the number of Catholics in the United States. Irish and German Catholics, by far, provided the greatest number of Catholic immigrants before 1900. From 1815 until the close of the Civil War in 1865, 1,683,791 Irish Catholics immigrated to the US. The German states followed, providing &quot;the second largest immigration of Catholics, clergy and lay, some 606,791 in the period 1815-1865, and another 680,000 between 1865 and 1900, while the Irish immigration in the latter period amounted to only 520,000.&quot; Of the four major national groups of clergy (early and mid-19th century)—Irish, German, Anglo-American, and French—&quot;the French emigre priests may be said to have been the outstanding men, intellectually.&quot; As the number of Catholics increased in the late 19th and 20th century, they built up a vast system of schools (from primary schools to universities) and hospitals. Since then, the Catholic Church has founded hundreds of other colleges and universities, along with thousands of primary and secondary schools. Schools like the University of Notre Dame is ranked best in its state (Indiana), as Georgetown University is ranked best in the District of Columbia. The following 10 Catholic universities are also ranked among the top 100 universities in the US: University of Notre Dame, Georgetown University, Boston College, Santa Clara University, Villanova University, Marquette University, Fordham University, Gonzaga University, Loyola Marymount University, and the University of San Diego. 

===Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy===
Eastern Orthodoxy was present in North America since the Russian colonization of Alaska; however, Alaska would not become a United States territory until 1867, and most Eastern Orthodox Russian settlers in Alaska returned to Russia after the American acquisition of the Alaskan territory. However the native converts and a few priests remained behind, and Alaska still is represented. 

Most Eastern Orthodoxes arrived in the contiguous United States as immigrants beginning in the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century. Two major groups brought Eastern Orthodoxy to America, one were Eastern Europeans like Russians, Greeks, Ukrainians, Serbians and others. The second major group were from Levant like Lebanese, Syrians, Palestinians and others. 

Armenians, Copts and Assyrians, also brought Oriental Orthodoxy to America.

===Demographics of various Christian groups===
The strength of various sects varies greatly in different regions of the country, with rural parts of the South having many evangelicals but very few Catholics (except Louisiana and the Gulf Coast, and from among the Hispanic community, both of which consist mainly of Catholics), while urbanized areas of the north Atlantic states and Great Lakes, as well as many industrial and mining towns, are heavily Catholic, though still quite mixed, especially due to the heavily Protestant African-American communities. In 1990, nearly 72% of the population of Utah was Mormon, as well as 26% of neighboring Idaho. Lutheranism is most prominent in the Upper Midwest, with North Dakota having the highest percentage of Lutherans (35% according to a 2001 survey).

The largest religion, Christianity, has proportionately diminished since 1990. While the absolute number of Christians rose from 1990 to 2008, the percentage of Christians dropped from 86% to 76%. A nationwide telephone interview of 1,002 adults conducted by The Barna Group found that 70% of American adults believe that God is &quot;the all-powerful, all-knowing creator of the universe who still rules it today&quot;, and that 9% of all American adults and 0.5% young adults hold to what the survey defined as a &quot;biblical worldview&quot;.

Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Eastern Orthodox and United Church of Christ members have the highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita of all Christian denominations in the United States, as well as the most high-income earners. However, owing to the sheer size or demographic head count of Catholics, more individual Catholics have graduate degrees and are in the highest income brackets than have or are individuals of any other religious community.

==Religious minorities==

===Judaism===
After Christianity, Judaism is the next largest religious affiliation in the United States, though this identification is not necessarily indicative of religious beliefs or practices. The Jewish population in the United States is approximately 6 million. A significant number of people identify themselves as American Jews on ethnic and cultural grounds, rather than religious ones. For example, 19% of self-identified American Jews do not believe God exists. The 2001 ARIS study projected from its sample that there are about 5.3 million adults in the American Jewish population: 2.83 million adults (1.4% of the US adult population) are estimated to be adherents of Judaism; 1.08 million are estimated to be adherents of no religion; and 1.36 million are estimated to be adherents of a religion other than Judaism. ARIS 2008 estimated about 2.68 million adults (1.2%) in the country identify Judaism as their faith. According to a 2017 study, Judaism is the religion of approximately 2% of the American population. According to a 2020 study by the Pew Research Center, the core American Jewish population is estimated at 7.5 million people, this includes 5.8 million Jewish adults. According to study by Steinhardt Social Research Institute, as of 2020, the core American Jewish population is estimated at 7.6 million people, this includes 4.9 million adults who identify their religion as Jewish, 1.2 million Jewish adults who identify with no religion, and 1.6 million Jewish children.

Jews have been present in what is now the United States since the 17th century, and specifically allowed since the British colonial Plantation Act 1740. Although small Western European communities initially developed and grew, large-scale immigration did not take place until the late 19th century, largely as a result of persecutions in parts of Eastern Europe. The Jewish community in the United States is composed predominantly of Ashkenazi Jews whose ancestors emigrated from Central and Eastern Europe. There are, however, small numbers of older (and some recently arrived) communities of Sephardi Jews with roots tracing back to 15th century Iberia (Spain, Portugal, and North Africa). There are also Mizrahi Jews (from the Middle East, Caucasia and Central Asia), as well as much smaller numbers of Ethiopian Jews, Indian Jews, and others from various smaller Jewish ethnic divisions. Approximately 25% of the Jewish American population lives in New York City.

According to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies newsletter published March 2017, based on data from 2010, Jews were the largest minority religion in 231 counties out of the 3143 counties in the country. According to a 2014 survey conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public life, 1.7% of adults in the US identify Judaism as their religion. Among those surveyed, 44% said they were Reform Jews, 22% said they were Conservative Jews, and 14% said they were Orthodox Jews. According to the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey, 38% of Jews were affiliated with the Reform tradition, 35% were Conservative, 6% were Orthodox, 1% were Reconstructionists, 10% linked themselves to some other tradition, and 10% said they are &quot;just Jewish&quot;.

This way, the American Jews&#x27; majority continue to identify themselves with Jewish main traditions, such as Conservative, Orthodox and Reform Judaism. But, already in the 1980s, 20–30 percent of members of largest Jewish communities, such as of New York City, Chicago, Miami, and others, rejected a denominational label.

According to the 2001 National Jewish Population Survey, 4.3 million American Jewish adults have some sort of strong connection to the Jewish community, whether religious or cultural. Jewishness is generally considered an ethnic identity as well as a religious one. Among the 4.3 million American Jews described as &quot;strongly connected&quot; to Judaism, over 80% have some sort of active engagement with Judaism, ranging from attendance at daily prayer services on one end of the spectrum to attending Passover Seders or lighting Hanukkah candles on the other. The survey also discovered that Jews in the Northeast and Midwest are generally more observant than Jews in the South or West.

The Jewish American community has higher household incomes than average, and is one of the best educated religious communities in the United States.

===Islam===
According to a 2016 Gallup poll, Islam is the third largest religion in the United States by numbers, after Christianity and Judaism, with 0.8% of the population identifying as Muslim. According to the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) in 2018, there are approximately 3.45 million Muslims living in the United States, including 2.05 million adults. Compared to other faith groups surveyed (Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, Non-Affiliated), ISPU found in 2017 that Muslims were most likely to be born outside of the US (50%), with 36% having undergone naturalization, and the most racially diverse group (Black or African American 25%; White 24%; Arab 18%; Asian/Chinese/Japanese 18%; Mixed 7%; Hispanic 5%; Native American/American Indian/Alaska Native 1%; Other 2%). In addition to diversity, Americans Muslims are most likely to report being low income, and among those who identify as middle class, the majority are Muslim women, not men. Although American Muslim education levels are similar to other religious communities, namely Christians, within the Muslim American population, Muslim women surpass Muslim men in education, with 31% of Muslim women having graduated from a four-year university. 90% of Muslim Americans identify as straight.

Islam in America effectively began with the arrival of African slaves. It is estimated that about 10% of African slaves transported to the United States were Muslim. Most, however, became Christians, and the United States did not have a significant Muslim population until the arrival of immigrants from Arab and East Asian Muslim areas. According to some experts, Islam later gained a higher profile through the Nation of Islam, a religious group that appealed to black Americans after the 1940s; its prominent converts included Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali. The first Muslim elected to Congress was Keith Ellison in 2006, followed by André Carson in 2008.

Out of all religious groups surveyed by ISPU, Muslims were found to be the most likely to report experiences of religious discrimination (61%). That can also be broken down when looking at gender (with Muslim women more likely than Muslim men to experience racial discrimination), age (with young people more likely to report experiencing racial discrimination than older people), and race, (with Arab Muslims the most likely to report experiencing religious discrimination). Muslims born in the United States are more likely to experience all three forms of discrimination, gender, religious, and racial.

Research indicates that Muslims in the United States are generally more assimilated and prosperous than their counterparts in Europe. Like other subcultural and religious communities, the Islamic community has generated its own political organizations and charity organizations.

===Hinduism===

Hinduism is the fourth largest faith in the United States, representing approximately 1% of the population in 2010s. In 2001, there were an estimated 766,000 Hindus in the US, about 0.2% of the total population. 

The first time Hinduism entered the United States is not clearly identifiable. However, large groups of Hindus have immigrated from India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, other parts of the Caribbean, southern Africa, eastern Africa, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mauritius, Fiji, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and other regions and countries since the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. During the 1960s and 1970s, Hinduism exercised fascination contributing to the development of New Age thought. During the same decades the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), a Vaishnavite Hindu reform organization, was founded in the US by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. In 2003, the Hindu American Foundation—a national institution protecting rights of the Hindu community of US—was founded.

According to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies newsletter published March 2017, based on data from 2010, Hindus were the largest minority religion in 92 counties out of the 3143 counties in the country.

American Hindus have one of the highest rates of educational attainment and household income among all religious communities, and tend to have lower divorce rates. Hindus also have higher acceptance towards homosexuality (71%), which is higher than the general public (62%).

===Bahá&#x27;í Faith===

The Baháʼí Faith was first mentioned in the United States in 1893 at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago. Soon after, early American converts began embracing the new religion. Thornton Chase was the first American Baháʼí, dating from 1894. One of the first Baháʼí institutions in the US was established in Chicago to facilitate the establishment of the first Baháʼí House of Worship in the West, which was eventually built in Wilmette, Illinois and dedicated in 1953.

Worldwide, the religion has grown faster than the rate of population growth over the 20th century, and has been recognized since the 1980s as the most widespread minority religion in the countries of the world. Similarly, by 2020, the religion was the largest minority religion in about half of the counties. Since about 1970 the state with the single largest Baháʼí population was South Carolina. From 2010 data the largest populations of Baháʼís at the county-by-county level are in Los Angeles, CA, Palm Beach, FL, Harris County, TX, and Cook County, IL. However, estimates of the total number of Baháʼís varies widely from around 175,000 to 500,000.

===Druze Faith===
Druze began migrating to the United States in the late 1800s from the Levant (Syria and Lebanon). Druze emigration to the Americas increased at the outset of the 20th century due to the famine during World War I that killed an estimated one third to one half of the population, the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, and the Lebanese Civil War between 1975 and 1990. The United States is the second largest home of Druze communities outside the Middle East after Venezuela (60,000). According to some estimates there are about 30,000 to 50,000 Druzes in the United States, with the largest concentration in Southern California. American Druze are mostly of Lebanese and Syrian descent.

Members of the Druze faith face the difficulty of finding a Druze partner and practicing endogamy; marriage outside the Druze faith is strongly discouraged according to the Druze doctrine. They also face the pressure of keeping the religion alive because many Druze immigrants to the United States converted to Protestantism, becoming communicants of the Presbyterian or Methodist churches.

===Rastafari===

Rastafarians began migrating to the United States in the 1950s, &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s from the religion&#x27;s 1930s birthplace, Jamaica.

Marcus Garvey, who is considered a prophet by many Rastafarians, rose to prominence and cultivated many of his ideas in the United States.

===Buddhism===

Buddhism entered the United States during the 19th century with the arrival of the first immigrants from East Asia. The first Buddhist temple was established in San Francisco in 1853 by Chinese Americans. The first prominent US citizen to publicly convert to Buddhism was Colonel Henry Steel Olcott in 1880 who is still honored in Sri Lanka for his Buddhist revival efforts. An event that contributed to the strengthening of Buddhism in the United States was the Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions in 1893, which was attended by many Buddhist delegates sent from India, China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand and Sri Lanka.

During the late 19th century Buddhist missionaries from Japan traveled to the US. During the same time period, US intellectuals started to take interest in Buddhism.

The early 20th century was characterized by a continuation of tendencies that had their roots in the 19th century. The second half, by contrast, saw the emergence of new approaches, and the move of Buddhism into the mainstream and making itself a mass and social religious phenomenon.

According to a 2016 study, Buddhists are approximately 1% of the American population. According to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies newsletter published March 2017, based on data from 2010, Buddhists were the largest minority religion in 186 counties out of the 3143 counties in the country.

===Sikhism===

Sikhism is a religion originating from the Indian subcontinent which was introduced into the United States when, around the turn of the 20th century, Sikhs started emigrating to the United States in significant numbers to work on farms in California. They were the first community to come from India to the US in large numbers. The first Sikh Gurdwara in America was built in Stockton, California, in 1912. In 2007, there were estimated to be between 250,000 and 500,000 Sikhs living in the United States, with the largest populations living on the East and West Coasts, with additional populations in Detroit, Chicago, and Austin.

The United States also has a number of non-Punjabi converts to Sikhism.

===Jainism===
Adherents of Jainism first arrived in the United States in the 20th century. The most significant time of Jain immigration was in the early 1970s. The United States has since become a center of the Jain Diaspora. The Federation of Jain Associations in North America is an umbrella organization of local American and Canadian Jain congregations to preserve, practice, and promote Jainism and the Jain way of life.

===Taoism===

Taoism was popularized throughout the world by the writings and teachings of Laozi and other Taoists as well as the practice of qigong, tai chi, and other Chinese martial arts. The first Taoists in the United States were immigrants from China during the mid-nineteenth century. They settled mostly in California where the built the first Taoist temples in the country, including the Tin How Temple in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown and the Joss House in Weaverville. Currently, the Temple of Original Simplicity is located outside of Boston, Massachusetts.

In 2004, there were an estimated 56,000 Taoists in the US.

=== Native American religions ===


Native American ethnic and indigenous faiths historically exhibited much diversity, and are often characterized by animism or panentheism and shamanism. Common concept is the supernatural world of deities, spirits and wonders, such as the Algonquian &quot;manitou&quot; or the Lakota&#x27;s &quot;wakan&quot;. In most areas, without Christian influence, was known a supreme Great Spirit or sky deity. Their great creation myths and sacred oral tradition in whole, as anthropologists note, are comparable to the Christian Bible.

The membership of Native American religions in the 21st century comprises about 9,000 people. Since Native Americans practicing traditional ceremonies do not usually have public organizations or membership rolls, these &quot;members&quot; estimates are likely substantially lower than the actual numbers of people who participate in traditional ceremonies.

The following is a list of indigenous American religions those still survive to some degree at the beginning of the 21st century: Alaska Native religions, Abenaki, Anishinaabe (Ojibwe, Midewiwin society), Apache, Blackfoot, Californian (Kuksu religion, Miwok, Ohlone and Pomo), Choctaw, Crow, Haida, Ho-Chunk, Iroquois (Cherokee, Mohawk, Muscogee Creek, Seneca and Wyandot), Jivaroan, Kwakwakaʼwakw, Lenape, Mapuche, Navajo, Nuu-chah-nulth, Pawnee, Pueblo (Acoma Pueblo, Hopi and Zuni), Sioux (Assiniboine, Dakota and Lakota), Tsimshian, Ute, and Yaqui beliefs.

There are also numerous indigenist revitalization movements within them that divided to fundamentalist and reform.

Generally fundamentalist movements include the Pueblo Revolt (1680s), the Shawnee Prophet movement (1805–1811), the Cherokee Prophet movement (1811–1813), the Red Stick War (1813–1814), White Path&#x27;s Rebellion (1826), the Winnebago Prophet movement (1830–1832), the first Ghost Dance (1869–1870) and the second Ghost Dance (1889–1890), and the Snake movements among the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Muscogee Creek peoples during the 1890s.

Generally syncretic reform movements include the Yaqui religion (1500–present), the Longhouse religion (1797–present), the Munsee Prophetess movement (1804–1805), the Kickapoo Prophet movement (1815–present), the Cherokee Keetoowah Society (1858–present), the Washat Dreamers religion (1850–present), the Indian Shakers (1881–present), the Native American Church (1800s–present), the Shoshoni Sun Dance (1890–present), the New Tidings religion or &quot;Wocekiye&quot; of the Canadian Sioux (1900–present), and Ojibwe Drummer movement (contemporary).

Thus, the Longhouse Religion combines and reinterprets elements of traditional Iroquois beliefs with a revised code such as must refrain from drinking, selling of land, intensive animal farming and witchcraft, meant to revive traditional consciousness after a long period of cultural disintegration following colonization. It founded in 1797 by the Seneca prophet Handsome Lake (Sganyodaiyoˀ). The movement had about 5,000 practicing members as of 1969.

Since 1889, in accordance with the millenarian teachings of the Northern Paiute spiritual leader Wovoka, the Ghost Dance ceremony was incorporated into numerous native belief systems.

The Sun Dance is a prominent living ceremony and movement, the Shoshone by origin in 1890, practiced by a number of peoples, primarily those of the Plains Nations. Many of the ceremonies have features in common, such as specific dances and songs, the use of drums, the ceremonial pipe, praying, fasting and, in some cases, the piercing of the skin as a sacrifice. At most ceremonies, other participants stay in the surrounding camp and pray in support of the dancers.

The Native American Church is a 19th-century origin syncretistic religious tradition involving the ceremonial and sacred use of &quot;Lophophora williamsii&quot; (peyote).
===Neopaganism===

Neopaganism in the United States is represented by widely different movements and organizations. The largest Neopagan religion is Wicca, followed by Neo-Druidism. Other neopagan movements include Germanic Neopaganism, Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism, Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism, and Semitic neopaganism.

====Wicca====
Wicca advanced in North America in the 1960s by Raymond Buckland, an expatriate Briton who visited Gardner&#x27;s Isle of Man coven to gain initiation. Universal Eclectic Wicca was popularized in 1969 for a diverse membership drawing from both Dianic and British Traditional Wiccan backgrounds.

====Druidry====
According to the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS), there are approximately 30,000 druids in the United States. Modern Druidism arrived in North America first in the form of fraternal Druidic organizations in the nineteenth century, and orders such as the Ancient Order of Druids in America were founded as distinct American groups as early as 1912. In 1963, the Reformed Druids of North America (RDNA) was founded by students at Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota. They adopted elements of Neopaganism into their practices, for instance celebrating the festivals of the Wheel of the Year.

===New Thought Movement===

A group of churches which started in the 1830s in the United States is known under the banner of &quot;New Thought&quot;. These churches share a spiritual, metaphysical and mystical predisposition and understanding of the Bible and were strongly influenced by the Transcendentalist movement, particularly the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Another antecedent of this movement was Swedenborgianism, founded on the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg in 1787. The New Thought concept was named by Emma Curtis Hopkins (&quot;teacher of teachers&quot;) after Hopkins broke off from Mary Baker Eddy&#x27;s Church of Christ, Scientist. The movement had been previously known as the Mental Sciences or the Christian Sciences. The three major branches are Religious Science, Unity Church and Divine Science.

===Unitarian Universalism===

Unitarian Universalists (UUs) are among the most liberal of all religious denominations in America. The shared creed includes beliefs in inherent dignity, a common search for truth, respect for beliefs of others, compassion, and social action. They are unified by their shared search for spiritual growth and by the understanding that an individual&#x27;s theology is a result of that search and not obedience to an authoritarian requirement. UUs have historical ties to anti-war, civil rights, and LGBT rights movements, as well as providing inclusive church services for the broad spectrum of liberal Christians, liberal Jews, secular humanists, LGBT, Jewish-Christian parents and partners, Earth-centered/Wicca, and Buddhist meditation adherents. In fact, many UUs also identify as belonging to another religious group, including atheism and agnosticism.

==No religion==

In 2020, approximately 28% of Americans declared themselves to be not religiously affiliated.

===Agnosticism, atheism, and humanism===

A 2001 survey directed by Dr. Ariela Keysar for the City University of New York indicated that, amongst the more than 100 categories of response, &quot;no religious identification&quot; had the greatest increase in population in both absolute and percentage terms. This category included atheists, agnostics, humanists, and others with no stated religious preferences. Figures are up from 14.3 million in 1990 to 34.2 million in 2008, representing an increase from 8% of the total population in 1990 to 15% in 2008. A nationwide Pew Research study published in 2008 put the figure of unaffiliated persons at 16.1%, while another Pew study published in 2012 was described as placing the proportion at about 20% overall and roughly 33% for the 18–29-year-old demographic. It is unknown why the number of self-identified &quot;nones&quot; is rising, although it may relate to a general decline of trust in institutions, the September 11 attacks, rise of the religious right, and sexual abuse scandals, particularly those within the Southern Baptist Convention and Catholic Church. The majority of &quot;nones&quot; have religion-like beliefs and believe in some conception of a higher power.

In a 2006 nationwide poll, University of Minnesota researchers found that despite an increasing acceptance of religious diversity, atheists were generally distrusted by other Americans, who trusted them less than Muslims, recent immigrants and other minority groups in &quot;sharing their vision of American society&quot;. They also associated atheists with undesirable attributes such as amorality, criminal behavior, rampant materialism and cultural elitism. However, the same study also reported that &quot;The researchers also found acceptance or rejection of atheists is related not only to personal religiosity, but also to one&#x27;s exposure to diversity, education and political orientation – with more educated, East and West Coast Americans more accepting of atheists than their Midwestern counterparts.&quot; Some surveys have indicated that doubts about the existence of the divine were growing quickly among Americans under 30.

On March 24, 2012, American atheists sponsored the Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., followed by the American Atheist Convention in Bethesda, Maryland. Organizers called the estimated crowd of 8,000–10,000 the largest-ever US gathering of atheists in one place.

Secular people in the United States, such as atheist and agnostics, have a distinctive secular tradition that can be traced for at least hundreds of years. They sometimes create religion-like institutions and communities, create rituals, and debate aspects of their shared beliefs.

====Belief in the existence of a god====
Various polls have been conducted to determine Americans&#x27; actual beliefs regarding a god. (Different wording of the poll question gives significantly different results.):
* A 2021 Pew Research Center Survey found that 91% of American believe in a higher power.
* A 2018 Pew Research Center Survey found that 90% of American believe in a higher power.
* In 2014 the Pew Research Center&#x27;s Religious Landscape Study showed 63% of Americans believed in God and were &quot;absolutely certain&quot; in their view, while the figure rose to 89% including those who were agnostic.
* A 2012 WIN-Gallup International poll showed that 5% of Americans considered themselves &quot;convinced&quot; atheists, which was a fivefold increase from the last time the survey was taken in 2005, and 5% said they did not know or else did not respond.
* A 2012 Pew Research Center survey found that doubts about the existence of a god had grown among younger Americans, with 68% telling Pew they never doubt God&#x27;s existence, a 15-point drop in five years. In 2007, 83% of American millennials said they never doubted God&#x27;s existence.
* A 2011 Gallup poll found 92% of Americans said yes to the basic question &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot;, while 7% said no and 1% had no opinion.
* A 2010 Gallup poll found 80% of Americans believe in a god, 12% believe in a universal spirit, 6% don&#x27;t believe in either, 1% chose &quot;other&quot;, and 1% had no opinion. 80% is a decrease from the 1940s, when Gallup first asked this question.
* A late 2009 online Harris poll of 2,303 US adults (18 and older) found that &quot;82% of adult Americans believe in God&quot;, the same number as in two earlier polls in 2005 and 2007. Another 9% said they did not believe in God, and 9% said that they were not sure. It further concluded, &quot;Large majorities also believe in miracles (76%), heaven (75%), that Jesus is God or the Son of God (73%), in angels (72%), the survival of the soul after death (71%), and in the resurrection of Jesus (70%). Less than half (45%) of adults believe in Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution but this is more than the 40% who believe in creationism... Many people consider themselves Christians without necessarily believing in some of the key beliefs of Christianity. However, this is not true of born-again Christians. In addition to their religious beliefs, large minorities of adults, including many Christians, have &quot;pagan&quot; or pre-Christian beliefs such as a belief in ghosts, astrology, witches and reincarnation... Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in the Harris Interactive panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.&quot;
* A 2008 survey of 1,000 people concluded that, based on their stated beliefs rather than their religious identification, 69.5% of Americans believe in a personal God, roughly 12.3% of Americans are atheist or agnostic, and another 12.1% are deistic (believing in a higher power/non-personal God, but no personal God).
* Mark Chaves, a Duke University professor of sociology, religion and divinity, found that 92% of Americans believed in God in 2008, but that significantly fewer Americans have great confidence in their religious leaders than a generation ago.
* According to a 2008 ARIS survey, belief in God varies considerably by region. The lowest rate is in the West with 59% reporting a belief in God, and the highest rate is in the South at 86%.

===Spiritual but not religious===
&quot;Spiritual but not religious&quot; (SBNR) is self-identified stance of spirituality that takes issue with organized religion as the sole or most valuable means of furthering spiritual growth. Spirituality places an emphasis upon the wellbeing of the &quot;mind-body-spirit&quot;, so holistic activities such as tai chi, reiki, and yoga are common within the SBNR movement. In contrast to religion, spirituality has often been associated with the interior life of the individual.

One fifth of the US public and a third of adults under the age of 30 are reportedly unaffiliated with any religion, however they identify as being spiritual in some way. Of these religiously unaffiliated Americans, 37% classify themselves as spiritual but not religious.

According to some sociologists, perceptions of religious decline are a popular misconception. They state that surveys showing so suffer from methodological deficiencies, that Americans are becoming more religious, and that Atheists and Agnostics make up a small and stable percentage of the population. &quot;Religious belief and interest&quot; has remained relatively stable in recent years; &quot;organizational participation&quot;, in contrast, has decreased.

==Major US-origin movements==
===Christian===
* Adventism — began as an inter-denominational movement during the Second Great Awakening (1790–1840). Its most vocal leader was William Miller, who in the 1830s in New York became convinced of an imminent Second Coming of Jesus. The most prominent modern group to emerge from this is the Seventh-day Adventists.
* Charismatic movement — a broad movement within mainstream Christian denominations to adopt beliefs and practices of Charismatic Christianity and similar to Pentecostalism, with an emphasis on baptism with the Holy Spirit, and the use of spiritual gifts (&quot;charismata&quot;). Since 1960, it has affected most denominations in the US, and has spread widely across the world.
* Christian Science — a faith healing movement associated with the Church of Christ, Scientist that founded in 1879 in New England by Mary Baker Eddy.
* Holiness movement — a movement that emerged chiefly within 19th-century American Methodism with the belief that the Christian life should be free of sin.
* Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses — originated with the nontrinitarian movement known as Bible Students, which was founded in Pennsylvania in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell. In their early years, the Bible Students were loosely connected with Adventism, and the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses still share some similarities with it.
* Latter Day Saint movement, a.k.a. Mormonism, founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith in upstate New York — a product of the Christian revivalist movement of the Second Great Awakening and based in Christian primitivism. Multiple Latter Day Saint denominations can be found throughout the United States. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the largest denomination, is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and it has members in many countries. The Community of Christ, the second-largest denomination, is headquartered in Independence, Missouri.
* Messianic Judaism — a movement of the Jews and non-Jews, which arose in the 1960s within Evangelical Protestantism and absorbed elements of the Jewish Christian traditions.
* Pentecostalism — a large movement which emphasizes the role of the baptism with the Holy Spirit and the use of spiritual gifts, finds its historic roots in the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles from 1904 to 1906, sparked by Charles Parham.
* Oneness Pentecostalism — a nontrinitarian, namely &quot;Jesus Only&quot;, movement within Pentecostalism that began in 1913.
* Restoration Movement, a.k.a. Campbellism — groups that began during the Second Great Awakening (1790–1840) and idealized early Christianity.
* Universalist Church of America&#x27;s first regional conference was founded in 1793.

===Other===

* Goddess movement is a widespread non-centralized trend in modern Paganism with the Goddess veneration, which emerged in the late 1960s. Its belief systems range from monotheistic to polytheistic. Only in the US, it was estimated to have 500,000 members.
* Eckankar is new religious movement founded in Las Vegas in 1965 by Paul Twitchell and drawing from the Radha Soami new Indian movement.

* Native American Church, also known as Peyotism and Peyote Religion, formed by Quanah Parker but beginning in 1800 and incorporating in 1918. Today it is the most widespread indigenous religion among Native Americans in the United States (except Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians), with an estimated 250,000 followers. 
* Neoshamanism, the origin of this broad movement has been traced to the second half of the 20th century, especially to two American anthropologists who are seen as promoting and spreading neoshamanic ideas and associated with them teachings and movements, namely Carlos Castaneda&#x27;s Tensegrity and Michael Harner&#x27;s Core Shamanism.
* New Thought Movement—two of the early proponents of New Thought beliefs during the mid to late 19th century were Phineas Parkhurst Quimby and the Mother of New Thought, Emma Curtis Hopkins. The three major branches are Religious Science, Unity Church and Divine Science.
* Reconstructionist Judaism, which founded by Mordecai Kaplan and started in the 1920s.
* Self-Realization Fellowship is a neo-Hindu movement founded in Los Angeles by Paramahansa Yogananda in 1920.

* Theosophy is an influential esoteric religion established during the late 19th century by Helena Blavatsky.
* Unitarian Universalist Association was founded in 1961 from the consolidation of the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America. Historically Christian denominations, the UUA is no longer Christian and is the largest Unitarian Universalist denomination in the world.
* 3HO is a sect of Sikhism, founded in Los Angeles in 1971 by Yogi Bhajan and followed mostly by White Americans.

==Statistics and measuring religion==

The US census does not ask about religion. Various groups have conducted surveys to determine approximate percentages of those affiliated with each religious group.

===Census and independent polling===
Since the first American census in 1790, census forms have never asked the religion of participants, with Vincent P. Barabba, former head of the United States Census Bureau, stating in April 1976 that &quot;asking such a question in the decennial census, in which replies are mandatory, would appear to infringe upon the traditional separation of church and state&quot; and &quot;could affect public cooperation in the census&quot;. Data on religious affiliation comes from independent pollsters by the Pew Research Center and other agencies or, on membership, from religious associations, such the &quot;Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches&quot; of the National Council of Churches.

===Problems measuring religion===
====Inaccuracies of independent polling====
Independent polling results on religion are questionable due to numerous factors:
* polls consistently fail to predict political election outcomes, signifying consistent failure to capture the actual views of the population
* very low response rates for all polls since the 1990s
* biases in wording or topic affect how people respond to polls
* polls categorize people based on limited choices
* polls often generalize broadly
* polls have shallow or superficial choices, which complicate capturing complexity of religious beliefs and practices
* poll interviewer and respondent fatigue is very common

Researchers note that an estimated 20-40% of the population changes their self-reported religious affiliation/identity over time due to numerous factors and that usually it is their answers on surveys that change, not necessarily their religious practices or beliefs.

Researchers advise caution when looking at the &quot;Nones&quot; demographics on surveys because different surveys systematically have discrepancies that amount to 8% and growing of estimates, part of it being that the respondents on surveys are not consistent and also the questions asked are worded differently, generating consistent discrepancies in responses.

According to Gallup there are variations on the responses based on how they ask questions. They routinely ask on complex things like belief in God since the early 2000s in 3 different wordings and they constantly receive 3 different percentages in responses.

=== The Association of Religion Data Archives (1900-2050) ===


===Public Religion Research Institute data (2020)===

The Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) has made annual estimates about religious adherence in the United States every year since 2013, and they most recently updated their data in 2020. Their data can be broken down to the state level, and data has also been made available of several large metro areas. Data is collected from roughly 50,000 telephone interviews conducted every year.

Their most recent data shows that approximately 70% of Americans are Christians (down from 71% in 2013), with about 46% of the population professing belief in Protestant Christianity, and another 22% adhering to Catholicism. About 23% of the population adheres to no religion, and 7% more of the population professes a Non-Christian religion (such as Judaism, Islam, or Hinduism).

===2014 Pew Research Center data===


=== 2010 ASARB data ===
The Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies (ASARB) surveyed congregations for their memberships. Churches were asked for their membership numbers. Adjustments were made for those congregations that did not respond and for religious groups that reported only adult membership. ASARB estimates that most of the churches not responding were black Protestant congregations. Significant difference in results from other databases include the lower representation of adherents of (1) all kinds (62.7%), (2) Christians (59.9%), (3) Protestants (less than 36%); and the greater number of unaffiliated (37.3%).

===Ethnicity===
The table below shows the religious affiliations among the ethnicities in the United States, according to the Pew Forum 2014 survey. People of Black ethnicity were most likely to be part of a formal religion, with 80% percent being Christians. Protestant denominations make up the majority of the Christians in the ethnicities.

===ARIS findings regarding self-identification===
The United States government does not collect religious data in its census. The survey below, the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) of 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone survey of 54,461 American residential households in the contiguous United States. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281.

Adult respondents were asked the open-ended question, &quot;What is your religion, if any?&quot; Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was &quot;Protestant&quot; or &quot;Christian&quot; further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions.

Religious Self-Identification of the US Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008Figures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of &quot;no religion&quot; than any other group.

Highlights:
# The ARIS 2008 survey was carried out during February–November 2008 and collected answers from 54,461 respondents who were questioned in English or Spanish.
#The American population self-identifies as predominantly Christian, but Americans are slowly becoming less Christian.
#* 86% of American adults identified as Christians in 1990 and 76% in 2008.
#* The historic mainline churches and denominations have experienced the steepest declines, while the non-denominational Christian identity has been trending upward, particularly since 2001.
#* The challenge to Christianity in the US does not come from other religions but rather from a rejection of all forms of organized religion.
# 34% of American adults considered themselves &quot;Born Again or Evangelical Christians&quot; in 2008.
# The US population continues to show signs of becoming less religious, with one out of every seven Americans failing to indicate a religious identity in 2008.
#* The &quot;Nones&quot; (no stated religious preference, atheist, or agnostic) continue to grow, though at a much slower pace than in the 1990s, from 8.2% in 1990, to 14.1% in 2001, to 15.0% in 2008.
#* Asian Americans are substantially more likely to indicate no religious identity than other racial or ethnic groups.
# One sign of the lack of attachment of Americans to religion is that 27% do not expect a religious funeral at their death.
# Based on their stated beliefs rather than their religious identification in 2008, 70% of Americans believe in a personal God, roughly 12% of Americans are atheist (no God) or agnostic (unknowable or unsure), and another 12% are deistic (a higher power but no personal God).
# America&#x27;s religious geography has been transformed since 1990. Religious switching along with Hispanic immigration has significantly changed the religious profile of some states and regions. Between 1990 and 2008, the Catholic population proportion of the New England states fell from 50% to 36% and in New York fell from 44% to 37%, while it rose in California from 29% to 37% and in Texas from 23% to 32%.
# Overall the 1990–2008 ARIS time series shows that changes in religious self-identification in the first decade of the 21st century have been moderate in comparison to the 1990s, which was a period of significant shifts in the religious composition of the United States.

===2024 Barna Group findings===

The media estimates of the number of adult US citizens who consider themselves evangelicals is too high according to 2024 data from the American Worldview Inventory 2024 (AWVI 2024, organized by the Cultural Research Center located at the Arizona Christian University, under the leadership of researcher George Barna). Rather than the conventional estimate of 25% to 40%, only 10% of adult US citizens consider themselves evangelicals, and of that 10% self-identifying as evangelicals, roughly two thirds do not follow major points of Christian Evangelical doctrine.

===Attendance===
Gallup survey data found that 73% of Americans were members of a church, synagogue or mosque in 1937, peaking at 76% shortly after World War II, before trending slightly downward to 70% by 2000. The percentage declined steadily during the first two decades of the 21st century, reaching 47% in 2020. Gallup attributed the decline to increasing numbers of Americans expressing no religious preference.

A 2013 Public Religion Research Institute survey reported that 31% of Americans attend religious services at least weekly. According to a 2022 Gallup poll, 75% of Americans report praying often or sometimes and religion plays a very (46%) or fairly (26%) important role in their lives.

In a 2009 Gallup survey, 41.6% of American residents stated that they attended a church, synagogue, or mosque once a week or almost every week. This percentage is higher than other surveyed Western countries. Church attendance varies considerably by state and region. The figures, updated to 2014, ranged from 51% in Utah to 17% in Vermont.

When it comes to mosque attendance specifically, data collected by a 2017 poll by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) shows that American Muslim women and men attend the mosque at similar rates (45% for men and 35% for women). Additionally, when compared to the general public looking at the attendance of religious services, young Muslim Americans attend the mosque at closer rates to older Muslim Americans. Muslim Americans who regularly attend mosques are more likely to work with their neighbors to solve community problems (49 vs. 30 percent), be registered to vote (74 vs. 49 percent), and plan to vote (92 vs. 81 percent). Overall, &quot;there is no correlation between Muslim attitudes toward violence and their frequency of mosque attendance&quot;.

==Religion and politics==


In August 2010, 67% of Americans said religion was losing influence, compared with 59% who said this in 2006. Majorities of white evangelical Protestants (79%), white mainline Protestants (67%), black Protestants (56%), Catholics (71%), and the religiously unaffiliated (62%) all agreed that religion was losing influence on American life; 53% of the total public said this was a bad thing, while just 10% see it as a good thing.

Politicians frequently discuss their religion when campaigning, and fundamentalists and black Protestants are highly politically active. However, to keep their status as tax-exempt organizations they must not officially endorse a candidate. Historically Catholics were heavily Democratic before the 1970s, while mainline Protestants comprised the core of the Republican Party. Those patterns have faded away—Catholics, for example, now split about 50–50. However, white evangelicals since 1980 have made up a solidly Republican group that favors conservative candidates. Secular voters are increasingly Democratic.

Only four presidential candidates for major parties have been Catholics, all for the Democratic party:
* Alfred E. Smith in presidential election of 1928 was subjected to anti-Catholic rhetoric, which seriously hurt him in the Baptist areas of the South and Lutheran areas of the Midwest, but he did well in the Catholic urban strongholds of the Northeast.
* John F. Kennedy secured the Democratic presidential nomination in 1960. In the 1960 election, Kennedy faced accusations that as a Catholic president he would do as the Pope would tell him to do, a charge that Kennedy refuted in a famous address to Protestant ministers.
* John Kerry, a Catholic, won the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. In the 2004 election religion was hardly an issue, and most Catholics voted for his Protestant opponent George W. Bush.
* Joe Biden, a Catholic, won the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, and then won the 2020 presidential election, becoming the second Catholic president, after John F. Kennedy. Biden was also the first Catholic vice president.

Joe Lieberman was the first major presidential candidate that was Jewish, on the Gore–Lieberman campaign of 2000 (although John Kerry and Barry Goldwater both had Jewish ancestry, they were practicing Christians). Bernie Sanders ran against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary of 2016. He was the first major Jewish candidate to compete in the presidential primary process. However, Sanders noted during the campaign that he does not actively practice any religion.

In 2006 Keith Ellison of Minnesota became the first Muslim elected to Congress; when re-enacting his swearing-in for photos, he used the copy of the Qur&#x27;an once owned by Thomas Jefferson. André Carson is the second Muslim to serve in Congress.

A Gallup poll released in 2007 indicated that 53% of Americans would refuse to vote for an atheist as president, up from 48% in 1987 and 1999. But then the number started to drop again and reached record low 43% in 2012 and 40% in 2015.

Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, is Mormon and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He is the former governor of the state of Massachusetts, and his father George Romney was the governor of the state of Michigan.

On January 3, 2013, Tulsi Gabbard became the first Hindu member of Congress, using a copy of the Bhagavad Gita while swearing-in.

<text>Larry Thomas Justus (30 April 1932 – 20 October 2002) was a Republican member of the North Carolina House of Representatives from Hendersonville, North Carolina, United States; he served nine consecutive terms.

Justus was born in Hendersonville and educated at Dana High School. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, he served in the United States Air Force, where he reached the rank of lieutenant colonel.

He was first appointed to the State Assembly in 1985 to fill the 50th District seat vacated by Charles Hughes&#x27; resignation. He served nine terms and was seeking re-election for a tenth (to the newly established 117th District) when he died in late October 2002. Because his name remained on the ballot and he received a majority of votes cast, the local Republican party named his widow, Carolyn K. Justus, to fill his seat.

The western campus of the North Carolina Justice Academy was named the Larry T. Justus Western Justice Academy in his honor in 2004.

<doc id="532813" wikidata="Q426716" url="?curid=532813" title="Technological and industrial history of the United States">
<text>The technological and industrial history of the United States describes the emergence of the United States as one of the most technologically advanced nations in the world in the 19th and 20th centuries. The availability of land and literate labor, the absence of a landed aristocracy, the prestige of entrepreneurship, the diversity of climate and large easily accessed upscale and literate markets all contributed to America&#x27;s rapid industrialization. 

The availability of capital, development by the free market of navigable rivers and coastal waterways, as well as the abundance of natural resources facilitated the cheap extraction of energy all contributed to America&#x27;s rapid industrialization. Fast transport by the first transcontinental railroad built in the mid-19th century, and the Interstate Highway System built in the late 20th century, enlarged the markets and reduced shipping and production costs. The legal system facilitated business operations and guaranteed contracts. Cut off from Europe by the embargo and the British blockade in the War of 1812 (1807–15), entrepreneurs opened factories in the Northeastern United States that set the stage for rapid industrialization modeled on British innovations.

From its emergence as an independent nation, the United States has encouraged science and innovation. As a result, the United States has been the birthplace of 161 of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;″s 321 Greatest Inventions, including items such as the airplane, internet, microchip, laser, cellphone, refrigerator, email, microwave, personal computer, liquid-crystal display and light-emitting diode technology, air conditioning, assembly line, supermarket, bar code, and automated teller machine.

The early technological and industrial development in the United States was facilitated by a unique confluence of geographical, social, and economic factors. The relative lack of workers kept U.S. wages generally higher than salaries in Europe and provided an incentive to mechanize some tasks. The United States population had some semi-unique advantages in that they were former British subjects, had high English literacy skills, for that period, including over 80% in New England, had stable institutions, with some minor American modifications, of courts, laws, right to vote, protection of property rights and in many cases personal contacts with the British innovators of the Industrial Revolution. They had a good basic structure to build on. 

Another major advantage enjoyed by the United States was the absence of an aristocracy or gentry. The eastern seaboard of the United States, with a great number of rivers and streams along the Atlantic seaboard, provided many potential sites for constructing textile mills necessary for early industrialization. The technology and information on how to build a textile industry were largely provided by Samuel Slater (1768–1835) who emigrated to New England in 1789. He had studied and worked in British textile mills for a number of years and immigrated to the United States, despite restrictions against it, to try his luck with U.S. manufacturers who were trying to set up a textile industry. He was offered a full partnership if he could succeed—he did. A vast supply of natural resources, the technological knowledge on how to build and power the necessary machines along with a labor supply of mobile workers, often unmarried females, all aided early industrialization. The broad knowledge carried by European migrants of two periods that advanced the societies there, namely the European Industrial Revolution and European Scientific Revolution, helped facilitate understanding for the construction and invention of new manufacturing businesses and technologies. A limited government that would allow them to succeed or fail on their own merit helped.

After the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783, the new government continued the strong property rights established under British rule and established a rule of law necessary to protect those property rights. The idea of issuing patents was incorporated into Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution authorizing Congress &quot;to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.&quot; The invention of the cotton gin by American inventor Eli Whitney, combined with the widespread prevalence of slavery in the United States and U.S. settler expansion made cotton potentially a cheap and readily available resource for use in the new textile industry.

One of the real impetuses for the United States entering the Industrial Revolution was the passage of the Embargo Act of 1807, the War of 1812 (1812–15) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15) which cut off supplies of new and cheaper Industrial revolution products from Britain. The lack of access to these goods all provided a strong incentive to learn how to develop the industries and to make their own goods instead of simply buying the goods produced by Britain.

Modern productivity researchers have shown that the period in which the greatest economic and technological progress occurred was between the last half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. During this period the nation was transformed from an agricultural economy to the foremost industrial power in the world, with more than a third of the global industrial output. This can be illustrated by the index of total industrial production, which increased from 4.29 in 1790 to 1,975.00 in 1913, an increase of 460 times (base year 1850 – 100).

American colonies gained independence in 1783 just as profound changes in industrial production and coordination were beginning to shift production from artisans to factories. Growth of the nation&#x27;s transportation infrastructure with internal improvements and a confluence of technological innovations before the Civil War facilitated an expansion in organization, coordination, and scale of industrial production. Around the turn of the 20th century, American industry had superseded its European counterparts economically and the nation began to assert its military power. Although the Great Depression challenged its technological momentum, America emerged from it and World War II as one of two global superpowers. In the second half of the 20th century, as the United States was drawn into competition with the Soviet Union for political, economic, and military primacy, the government invested heavily in scientific research and technological development which spawned advances in spaceflight, computing, and biotechnology.

Science, technology, and industry have not only profoundly shaped America&#x27;s economic success, but have also contributed to its distinct political institutions, social structure, educational system, and cultural identity.

==Pre-European technology==
North America has been inhabited continuously since approximately 4,000 BC. The earliest inhabitants were nomadic, big-game hunter-gatherers who crossed the Bering land bridge. These first Native Americans relied upon chipped-stone spearheads, rudimentary harpoons, and boats clad in animal hides for hunting in the Arctic. As they dispersed within the continent, they encountered the varied temperate climates in the Pacific northwest, central plains, Appalachian woodlands, and arid Southwest, where they began to make permanent settlements. The peoples living in the Pacific northwest built wooden houses, used nets and weirs to catch fish, and practiced food preservation to ensure longevity of their food sources, since substantial agriculture was not developed. Peoples living on the plains remained largely nomadic; some practiced agriculture for parts of the year and became adept leather workers as they hunted buffalo while people living in the arid southwest built adobe buildings, fired pottery, domesticated cotton, and wove cloth. 

Tribes in the eastern woodlands and Mississippian Valley developed extensive trade networks, built pyramid-like mounds, and practiced substantial agriculture while the peoples living in the Appalachian Mountains and coastal Atlantic practiced highly sustainable forest agriculture and were expert woodworkers. However, the populations of these peoples were small and their rate of technological change was very low. Indigenous peoples did not domesticate animals for drafting or husbandry, develop writing systems, or create bronze or iron-based tools like their European/Asian counterparts.

==Colonial era==
===Agriculture===

In the 17th century, Pilgrims, Puritans, and Quakers fleeing religious persecution in Europe brought with them plowshares, guns, and domesticated animals like cows and pigs. These immigrants and other European colonists initially farmed subsistence crops like corn, wheat, rye, and oats as well as rendering potash and maple syrup for trade. Due to the more temperate climate, large-scale plantations in the American South grew labor-intensive cash crops like sugarcane, rice, cotton, and tobacco requiring the importation of thousands of enslaved Africans to maintain. Early American farmers were not self-sufficient; they relied upon other farmers, specialized craftsmen, and merchants to provide tools, process their harvests, and bring them to market.

===Artisanship===
Colonial artisanship emerged slowly as the market for advanced craftsmanship was small. American artisans developed a more relaxed (less regulated) version of the Old World apprenticeship system for educating and employing the next generation. Despite the fact that mercantilist, export-heavy economy impaired the emergence of a robust self-sustaining economy, craftsmen and merchants developed a growing interdependence on each other for their trades. In the mid-18th century, attempts by the British to subdue or control the colonies by means of taxation sowed increased discontent among these artisans, who increasingly joined the Patriot cause.

===Silver working===
Colonial Virginia provided a potential market of rich plantations. At least 19 silversmiths worked in Williamsburg between 1699 and 1775. The best-known were James Eddy (1731–1809) and his brother-in-law William Wadill, also an engraver. Most planters, however, purchased English-made silver.

In Boston, goldsmiths and silversmiths were stratified. The most prosperous were merchant-artisans, with a business outlook and high status. Most craftsmen were laboring artisans who either operated small shops or, more often, did piecework for the merchant artisans. The small market meant there was no steady or well-paid employment; many lived in constant debt.

Colonial silver working was pre-industrial in many ways: many pieces made were &quot;bespoke&quot;, or uniquely made for each customer, and emphasized artistry as well as functionality. Silver (and other metal) mines were scarcer in North America than in Europe, and colonial craftsmen had no consistent source of materials with which to work. For each piece of silver they crafted, raw materials had to be collected and often reused from disparate sources, most commonly Spanish coins. The purity of these sources was not regulated, nor was there an organized supply chain through which to obtain silver. As silver objects were sold by weight, manufacturers who could produce silver objects cheaply by mass had an advantage. Many of these unique, individual aspects to silver working kept artisan practices in place through the late 18th century.

As demand for silver increased and large-scale manufacturing techniques emerged, silver products became much more standardized. For special-order objects that would likely only be made once, silversmiths generally used lost-wax casting, in which a sculpted object was carved out of wax, an investment casting was made, and the wax was melted away. The molds produced in this manner could only be used once, which made them inconvenient for standard objects like handles and buckles. Permanent mold casting, an industrial casting technique focused on high-volume production, allowed smiths to reuse molds to make exact replicas of the most commonly used items they sold. In creating these molds and developing standardized manufacturing processes, silversmiths could begin delegating some work to apprentices and journeymen. 

After 1780, Paul Revere&#x27;s sons took on more significant roles in his shop, and his silver pieces often included wooden handles made by carpenters more experienced with woodwork. For even some of the most successful artisans like Revere, artisan was not a profitable enterprise compared to mass-production using iron or bronze casting. Creating products that could be replicated for multiple customers, adopting new business practices and labor policies, and new equipment made manufacturing more ultimately efficient. These changes, in tandem with new techniques and requirements defined by changing social standards, led to the introduction of new manufacturing techniques in Colonial America that preceded and anticipated the industrial revolution.

Late in the colonial era a few silversmiths expanded operations with manufacturing techniques and changing business practices They hired assistants, subcontracted out piecework and standardized output. One individual in the vanguard of America&#x27;s shift towards more industrial methods was Paul Revere, who emphasized the production of increasingly standardized items later in his career with the use of a silver flatting mill, increased numbers of salaried employees, and other advances. Still, traditional methods of artisan remained, and smiths performed a great deal of work by hand. The coexistence of the craft and industrial production styles prior to the industrial revolution is an example of proto-industrialization.

===Factories and mills===

In the mid-1780s, Oliver Evans invented an automated flour mill that included a grain elevator and hopper boy. Evans&#x27; design eventually displaced the traditional gristmills. By the turn of the century, Evans also developed one of the first high-pressure steam engines and began establishing a network of machine workshops to manufacture and repair these popular inventions. In 1789, the widow of Nathanael Greene recruited Eli Whitney to develop a machine to separate the seeds of short fibered cotton from the fibers. The resulting cotton gin could be made with basic carpentry skills but reduced the necessary labor by a factor of 50 and generated huge profits for cotton growers in the South, leading to a rapid expansion of slavery in the United States. While Whitney did not realize financial success from his invention, he moved on to manufacturing rifles and other armaments under a government contract that could be made with &quot;expedition, uniformity, and exactness&quot;—the foundational ideas for interchangeable parts. However, Whitney&#x27;s vision of interchangeable parts would not be achieved for over two decades with firearms and even longer for other devices.

Between 1800 and 1820, new industrial tools that rapidly increased the quality and efficiency of manufacturing emerged. Simeon North suggested using division of labor to increase the speed with which a complete pistol could be manufactured which led to the development of a milling machine in 1798. In 1819, Thomas Blanchard created a lathe that could reliably cut irregular shapes, like those needed for arms manufacture. By 1822, Captain John H. Hall had developed a system using machine tools, division of labor, and an unskilled workforce to produce a breech-loading rifle—a process that came to be known as &quot;Armory practice&quot; in the U.S. and the &quot;American system of manufacturing&quot; in England.

The textile industry, which had previously relied upon labor-intensive production methods, was also rife with potential for mechanization. In the late 18th century, the English textile industry had adopted the spinning jenny, water frame, and spinning mule which greatly improved the efficiency and quality of textile manufacture, but were closely guarded by the British government which forbade their export or the emigration of those who were familiar with the technology. The 1787 Beverly Cotton Manufactory was the first cotton mill in the United States, but it relied on horse power. Samuel Slater, an apprentice in one of the largest textile factories in England, immigrated to the United States in 1789 upon learning that American states were paying bounties to British expatriates with a knowledge of textile machinery. With the help of Moses Brown of Providence, Slater established America&#x27;s oldest currently existing cotton-spinning mill with a fully mechanized water power system at the Slater Mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1793. 
Hoping to harness the ample power of the Merrimack River, another group of investors began building the Middlesex Canal up the Mystic River, both Mystic Lakes and generally following stream valleys (near to today&#x27;s MA 38) reached the Merrimack in Chelmsford from Boston Harbor, establishing limited operations by 1808, and a system of navigations and canals reaching past Manchester by mid-1814—and spawning commercial activities, and especially new clothing mills throughout the region. At nearly the same time as the canal was completed, Francis Cabot Lowell and a consortium of businessmen set up the clothing mills in Waltham, Massachusetts making use of water power from the Charles River with the concept of housing together production of feedstocks complete consumer processes so raw materials entered, and dyed fabrics or clothing left. For a few decades, it seemed that every lock along the canal had mills and water wheels. In 1821, Boston Manufacturing Company built a major expansion in East Chelmsford, which was soon incorporated as Lowell, Massachusetts—which came to dominate the cloth production and clothing industry for decades.
Slater&#x27;s Mill was established in the Blackstone Valley, which extended into neighboring Massachusetts, (Daniel Day&#x27;s Woolen Mill, 1809 at Uxbridge), and became one of the earliest industrialized region in the United States, second to the North Shore of Massachusetts. Slater&#x27;s business model of independent mills and mill villages (the &quot;Rhode Island System&quot;) began to be replaced by the 1820s by a more efficient system (the &quot;Waltham System&quot;) based upon Francis Cabot Lowell&#x27;s replications of British power looms. Slater went on to build several more cotton and wool mills throughout New England, but when faced with a labor shortage, resorted to building housing, shops, and churches for the workers and their families adjacent to his factories. 

The first power looms for woolens were installed in 1820, at Uxbridge, Massachusetts, by John Capron, of Cumberland, Rhode Island. These added automated weaving under the same roof, a step which Slater&#x27;s system outsourced to local farms. Lowell looms were managed by specialized employees, many of the employed were unmarried young women (&quot;Lowell mill girls&quot;), and owned by a corporation. Unlike the previous forms of labor (apprenticeship, family labor, slavery, and indenture), the Lowell system popularized the concept of wage laborer who sells his labor to an employer under contract—a socio-economic system which persists in many modern countries and industries. The corporation also looked out for the health and well-being of the young women, including their spiritual health, and the hundreds of women employed by it culturally established the pattern of a young woman going off to work for a few years to save money before returning home to school and marriage. It created an independent breed of women uncommon in most of the world.

===Turnpikes and canals===
Even as the country grew even larger with the admission of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio by 1803, the only means of transportation between these landlocked western states and their coastal neighbors was by foot, pack animal, or ship. Recognizing the success of Roman roads in unifying that empire, political and business leaders in the United States began to construct roads and canals to connect the disparate parts of the nation.

Early toll roads were constructed and owned by joint-stock companies that sold stock to raise construction capital like Pennsylvania&#x27;s 1795 Lancaster Turnpike Company. In 1808, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin&#x27;s &quot;Report on the Subject of Public Roads and Canals&quot; suggested that the federal government should fund the construction of interstate turnpikes and canals. While many Anti-Federalists opposed the federal government assuming such a role, the British blockade in the War of 1812 demonstrated the United States&#x27; reliance upon these overland roads for military operations as well as for general commerce. Construction on the National Road began in 1815 in Cumberland, Maryland and reached Wheeling, Virginia in 1818, but political strife thereafter ultimately prevented its western advance to the Mississippi River. Nevertheless, the road became a primary overland conduit through Appalachian Mountains and was the gateway for thousands of antebellum westward-bound settlers.

Numerous canal companies had also been chartered; but of all the canals projected, only three had been completed when the War of 1812 began: the Dismal Swamp Canal in Virginia, the Santee Canal in South Carolina, and the Middlesex Canal in Massachusetts. It remained for New York to usher in a new era in internal communication by authorizing in 1817 the construction of the Erie Canal. This bold bid for Western trade alarmed the merchants of Philadelphia, particularly as the completion of the national road threatened to divert much of their traffic to Baltimore. In 1825, the Pennsylvania General Assembly grappled with the problem by projecting a series of canals which were to connect its great seaport with Pittsburgh on the west and with Lake Erie and the upper Susquehanna on the north. The Blackstone Canal, (1823–1828) in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and the Morris Canal across northern New Jersey (1824–1924) soon followed, along with the Illinois and Michigan Canal from Chicago to the Illinois River(1824–1848).

Like the turnpikes, the early canals were constructed, owned, and operated by private joint-stock companies but later gave way to larger projects funded by the states. The Erie Canal, proposed by Governor of New York De Witt Clinton, was the first canal project undertaken as a public good to be financed at the public risk through the issuance of bonds. When the project was completed in 1825, the canal linked Lake Erie with the Hudson River through 83 separate locks and over a distance of . The success of the Erie Canal spawned a boom of other canal-building around the country: over of artificial waterways were constructed between 1816 and 1840. Smaller cities, such as Syracuse, New York, Buffalo, New York, and Cleveland that lay along major canal routes boomed into major industrial and trade centers, while canal-building pushed some states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana to the brink of bankruptcy.

The magnitude of the transportation problem was such, however, that neither individual states nor private corporations seemed able to meet the demands of an expanding internal trade. As early as 1807, Albert Gallatin had advocated the construction of a great system of internal waterways to connect East and West, at an estimated cost of $20,000,000 ($ in 2024 consumer dollars). But the only contribution of the national government to internal improvements during the Jeffersonian era was an appropriation in 1806 of two percent of the net proceeds of the sales of public lands in Ohio for the construction of a national road, with the consent of the states through which it should pass. By 1818 the road was open to traffic from Cumberland, Maryland, to Wheeling, West Virginia.

In 1816, with the experiences of the war before him, no well-informed statesman could shut his eyes to the national aspects of the problem. Even President James Madison invited the attention of Congress to the need of establishing &quot;a comprehensive system of roads and canals&quot;. Soon after Congress met, it took under consideration a bill drafted by John C. Calhoun which proposed an appropriation of $1,500,000 ($ in 2024 consumer dollars) for internal improvements. Because this appropriation was to be met by the moneys paid by the National Bank to the government, the bill was commonly referred to as the &quot;Bonus Bill&quot;. But on the day before he left office, President Madison vetoed the bill because it was unconstitutional. The policy of internal improvements by federal aid was thus wrecked on the constitutional scruples of the last of the Virginia dynasty. Having less regard for consistency, the United States House of Representatives recorded its conviction, by close votes, that Congress could appropriate money to construct roads and canals, but had not the power to construct them. As yet the only direct aid of the national government to internal improvements consisted of various appropriations, amounting to about $1,500,000 for the Cumberland Road.

As the country recovered from financial depression following the Panic of 1819, the question of internal improvements again forged to the front. In 1822, a bill to authorize the collection of tolls on the Cumberland Road had been vetoed by President James Monroe. In an elaborate essay, Monroe set forth his views on the constitutional aspects of a policy of internal improvements. Congress might appropriate money, he admitted, but it might not undertake the actual construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them. For the moment, the drift toward a larger participation of the national government in internal improvements was stayed. 

Two years later, Congress authorized the U.S. president to institute surveys for such roads and canals as he believed to be needed for commerce and military defense. No one pleaded more eloquently for a larger conception of the functions of the national government than Henry Clay. He called the attention of his hearers to provisions made for coast surveys and lighthouses on the Atlantic seaboard and deplored the neglect of the interior of the country. Among the other presidential candidates, Andrew Jackson voted in the United States Senate for the general survey bill; and John Quincy Adams left no doubt in the public mind that he did not reflect the narrow views of his section on this issue. William H. Crawford felt the constitutional scruples which were everywhere being voiced in the South, and followed the old expedient of advocating a constitutional amendment to sanction national internal improvements.

In President Adams&#x27; first message to Congress, he advocated not only the construction of roads and canals but also the establishment of observatories and a national university. President Thomas Jefferson had recommended many of these in 1806 for Congress to consider for creation of necessary amendments to the Constitution. Adams seemed oblivious to the limitations of the Constitution. In much alarm, Jefferson suggested to Madison the desirability of having Virginia adopt a new set of resolutions, bottomed on those of 1798, and directed against the acts for internal improvements. In March 1826, the Virginia General Assembly declared that all the principles of the earlier resolutions applied &quot;with full force against the powers assumed by Congress&quot; in passing acts to protect manufacturers and to further internal improvements. That the administration would meet with opposition in Congress was a foregone conclusion.

===Steamboats===

Despite the new efficiencies introduced by the turnpikes and canals, travel along these routes was still time-consuming and expensive. The idea of integrating a steam boiler and propulsion system can be first attributed to John Fitch and James Rumsey who both filed for patents or state monopolies on steamboats in the late 1780s. However, these first steamboats were complicated, heavy, and expensive. It would be almost 20 years until Robert R. Livingston contracted a civil engineer named Robert Fulton to develop an economical steamboat. Fulton&#x27;s paddle steamer, &quot;The North River Steamboat&quot; (erroneously referred to as the &quot;Clermont&quot;), made its first trip from New York City north on the Hudson River to Albany on August 17, 1807. By 1820, steamboat services had been established on all the Atlantic tidal rivers and Chesapeake Bay. The shallow-bottomed boats were also ideally suited for navigating the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and the number of boats on these rivers increased from 17 boats to 727 boats between 1817 and 1855. The speed of the steamboats decreased travel times between coastal ports and upstream cities by weeks and costs for transporting goods along these rivers by as much as 90%.

Steamboats profoundly altered the relationships between the federal government, state governments, and private property owners. Livingston and Fulton had obtained monopoly rights to operate a steamboat service within the state of New York, but Thomas Gibbons, who operated a competing New Jersey ferry service, was enjoined from entering New York waters under the terms of the monopoly. In 1824, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot; that Congress could regulate commerce and transportation under the Commerce Clause which compelled the state of New York to allow steamboat services from other states.

Because the physics and metallurgy of boilers were poorly understood, steamboats were prone to boiler explosions that killed hundreds of people between the 1810s and 1840s. In 1838, legislation was enacted that mandated boiler inspections by federal agents under the threat of revocation of the operator&#x27;s navigation licenses and lowered the threshold for liability in suits arising from such accidents. While Americans long resisted any government&#x27;s power to regulate private property, these new rules demonstrated that many Americans believed that property rights did not override civil rights and set the precedent for future federal safety regulations.

===Mining===
Many minerals have been mined across the United States. Coal was one of the earliest, mainly mined in the eastern states, and when combined with iron ore led to the growth of the Steel industry. Gold and silver mining was a significant contributor to the rapid expansion of the western states in the 19thl. century. Copper mining began in the 1840s, and the United States is the fourth largest copper producer in the World.

===Civil War===
Role of industry &amp; technology in causes, conduct &amp; operations, reconstruction
* Samuel Colt, invented the revolver, the first repeating pistol
* John Browning developed some of the first modern repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms.

==Technological systems and infrastructure==

The period after the American Civil War was marked by increasing intense and pervasive industrialization and successive technological advances like the railroad, telegraph &amp; telephone, and internal combustion engine. This facilitated America&#x27;s westward expansion and economic development by connecting the frontier with the industrial, financial, and political centers of the East. Americans increasingly relied upon technological infrastructures like the railroad, electric, and telecommunications systems for economic and social activities.
===Bicycles===

The Overman Wheel Company, founded 1882, was the first manufacturer of safety bicycles in the United States, in their factory complex in Chicopee, Massachusetts. Following their creation in England, Overman rushed a safety bicycle to production before the end of 1887. Overman was known for making all-steel bicycles with no cast metal parts. The Overman Victor bicycle was said to be of higher quality and lower weight than other bicycles of its time. By 1893, the Overman factory made the complete bicycle, including tyres, saddles, rims, etc.
===Railroads===
Between 1820 and 1830, many inventors and entrepreneurs began to apply emerging steamboat technology to engines that could travel on land. The earliest proposal came in 1813 from Oliver Evans&#x27; idea of a railway to connect New York City and Philadelphia with &quot;carriages drawn by steam engines&quot;. Many individuals and companies have a claim to being the first railroad in the United States, but by the mid-1830s several companies were using steam-powered locomotives to move train cars on rail tracks. 

Between 1840 and 1860, the total length of railroad trackage increased from . The efficiency of railroad to move large, bulk items contributed enabled further drops in cost of transporting goods to market but in so doing undermined the profitability of the earlier turnpikes and canals which began to fold and fall into disrepair. However, the early railroads were poorly integrated; there were hundreds of competing companies using different gauges for their track requiring cargo to be trans-shipped—rather than traveling directly—between cities.

The completion of the First transcontinental railroad in 1869 and its attendant profit and efficiency had the effect of stimulating a period of intense consolidation and technological standardization that would last another 50 years. It was during this time that railroad magnates such as Jay Gould and Cornelius Vanderbilt amassed great power and fortunes from consolidation of smaller rail lines into national corporations. By 1920, of standard-gauge railroad track had been laid in the United States, all of it owned or controlled by seven organizations. The need to synchronize train schedules and the inefficiencies introduced by every city having its own local time, also led to introduction of Standard time by railway managers in 1883. Railroads began using diesel locomotives in the 1930s, and they completely replaced steam locomotives by the 1950s, which reduced costs and improved reliability.

During the Post–World War II economic expansion many railroads were driven out of business due to competition from airlines and Interstate highways. The rise of the automobile led to the end of passenger train service on most railroads. Trucking businesses had become major competitors by the 1930s with the advent of improved paved roads, and after the war they expanded their operations as the interstate highway network grew, and acquired increased market share of freight business.

In 1970 the Penn Central railroad declared bankruptcy, the largest bankruptcy in the US at that time. In response Congress created a government corporation, Amtrak, to take over operation of the passenger lines of Penn Central and other railroads, under the Rail Passenger Service Act. Amtrak began inter-city rail operations in 1971. In 1980 Congress enacted the Staggers Rail Act to revive freight traffic, by removing restrictive regulations and enabling railroads to be more competitive with the trucking industry. 

More railroad companies merged and consolidated their lines in order to remain successful. These changes led to the current system of fewer, but profitable, Class I railroads covering larger regions of the United States. To replace the loss of commuter passenger rail service, state and local government agencies established their own commuter rail systems in several metropolitan areas, generally by leasing rail lines from Amtrak or freight railroads. The first rapid transit systems began operation in Chicago (1892), Boston (1897) and New York City (1904).

===Iron and steel-making===
Because iron occurs in nature commonly as an oxide, it must be smelted to drive off the oxygen to obtain the metallic form. Bloomery forges were prevalent in the colonies and could produce small batches of iron to be smithed for local needs (horseshoes, axeblades, plowshares) but were unable to scale production for exporting or larger-scale industry, including gunmaking, shipbuilding, and wheelmaking. Blast furnaces creating cast iron and pig iron emerged on large self-sufficient plantations in the mid-17th century to meet these demands, but production was expensive and labor-intensive: forges, furnaces, and waterwheels had to be constructed, huge swaths of forest had to be cleared and the wood rendered into charcoal, and iron ore and limestone had to be mined and transported. 

By the end of the 18th century, the threat of deforestation forced the English to use coke, a fuel derived from coal, to fire their furnaces. This shift precipitated a drop in iron prices since the process no longer required charcoal, the production of which was labor-intensive. This was a practice that was later adopted in the US as well.

Although steel is an alloy of iron and a small amount of carbon, historically steel and iron-making were intended for different products given the high costs of steel over wrought iron. The main difficulty with making steel is that its higher melting point than pig or cast iron was not easily achievable in large-scale production until methods that introduced air or oxygen to oxidize the carbon in the molten pig iron were developed, allowing the direct conversion of molten pig iron to molten steel.

Throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries, the English steelmakers produced blister and crucible steel which required specialized equipment. In the 18th century, innovations like steamboats, railroads, and guns increased demand for wrought iron and steel. The Mount Savage Iron Works in Maryland was the largest in the United States in the late 1840s, and the first in the nation to produce heavy rails for the construction of railroads. 

In the 1850s, American William Kelly and Englishman Henry Bessemer independently discovered that air blown through the molten iron increases its temperature by oxidizing the carbon and separating additional impurities into the slag. The Kelly-Bessemer process, because it reduces the amount of coke needed for blasting and increases the quality of the finished iron, revolutionized the mass production of high-quality steel and facilitated a drastic drop in steel prices and expansion of its availability.

In 1868, Andrew Carnegie saw an opportunity to integrate new coke-making methods with the recently developed Kelly-Bessemer process to supply steel for railroads. In 1872, he built a steel plant in Braddock, Pennsylvania at the junction of several major railroad lines. Carnegie earned enormous profits by pioneering vertical integration; he owned the iron ore mines in Minnesota, the transport steamboats on the Great Lakes, the coal mines and coke ovens, and the rail lines delivering the coke and ore to his Pennsylvania mills. By 1900, the Carnegie Steel Company was producing more steel than all of Britain and in 1901 Carnegie sold his business to J.P. Morgan&#x27;s U.S. Steel earning Carnegie $480 million personally.

===Telegraph and telephone===
The ability to quickly transmit information over long distances would prove to have an enormous impact on many diverse fields like journalism, banking, and diplomacy. Between 1837 and 1844, Samuel F.B. Morse and Alfred Vail developed a transmitter that could send &quot;short&quot; or &quot;long&quot; electric currents which would move an electromagnetic receiver to record the signal as dots and dashes. Morse established the first telegraph line (between Baltimore and Washington D.C.) in 1844 and by 1849 almost every state east of the Mississippi had telegraph service. Between 1850 and 1865, the telegraph business became progressively more consolidated and the 1866 incorporation of Western Union emerged with a near-monopoly over 22,000 telegraph offices and of cable throughout the country. The telegraph was used to dispatch news from the fronts of the Mexican–American War, coordinate Union troop movements during the Civil War, relay stock and commodity prices and orders between markets on ticker tape, and conduct diplomatic negotiations after the Transatlantic telegraph cable was laid in 1866.

Alexander Graham Bell obtained a patent in 1876 to a device that could transmit and reproduce the sound of a voice over electrical cables. Bell realized the enormous potential for his telephone and formed the Bell Telephone Company which would control the whole system, from manufacturing the telephones to leasing the equipment to customers and operators. Between 1877 and 1893 (the term of Bell&#x27;s patent coverage) the number of phones leased by Bell&#x27;s company increased from 3,000 to 260,000, although these were largely limited to businesses and government offices that could afford the relatively high rates. After the Bell patents expired, thousands of independent operators became incorporated and their competition for services to middle and low-class households as well as rural farmers drove prices down significantly. By 1920, there were 13 million phones in the United States providing service to 39 percent of all farm households and 34 percent of non-farm households.

===Petroleum===
The 1859 discovery of crude oil in western Pennsylvania set off an &quot;oil rush&quot; reminiscent of the 1849 California Gold Rush and would prove to be a valuable resource on the eve of the Civil War. Because crude oil needs to be distilled to extract usable fuel oils, oil refining quickly became a major industry in the area. The rural and mountainous terrain of these Pennsylvania oilfields allowed neither economical in-situ refining nor efficient railroad transportation of extracted oil. Beginning in 1865, the construction of oil pipelines to connect the oilfields with railroads or oil refineries alleviated this geographical bottleneck but also put thousands of coopers and teamsters (who made the barrels and drove the wagons to transport oil) out of business. As the network of oil pipelines expanded, they became more integrated with both the railway and telegraph systems which enabled even greater coordination in production, scheduling, and pricing.

John D. Rockefeller was a forceful driver of consolidation in the American oil industry. Beginning in 1865, he bought refineries, railroads, pipelines, and oilfields and ruthlessly eliminated competition to his Standard Oil. By 1879, he controlled 90% of oil refined in the US. Standard Oil used pipelines to directly connect the Pennsylvanian oilfields with the refineries in New Jersey, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, rather than loading and unloading railroad tank cars, which enabled huge gains in efficiency and profitability. Given the unprecedented scale of Standard Oil&#x27;s network, the company developed novel methods for managing, financing, and organizing its businesses. Because laws governing corporations limited their ability to do business across state lines, Standard Oil pioneered the use of a central trust that owned and controlled the constituent companies in each state. The use of trusts by other industries to stifle competition and extract monopoly prices led to the 1890 passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act. 

In the 1911 case of &quot;Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Standard Oil Trust be disbanded into competing companies that would become Exxon (Standard Oil of New Jersey), Mobil (Standard Oil of New York), and Chevron (Standard Oil of California).

The demand for petroleum products increased rapidly after the turn of the century as families relied upon kerosene to heat and light their houses, industries relied upon lubricants for machinery, and the ever-more prevalent internal combustion engine demanded gasoline fuel. Between 1880 and 1920, the amount of oil refined annually jumped from 26 million to 442 million. The discovery of large oil fields in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and California in the early 20th century touched off &quot;oil crazes&quot; and contributed to these states&#x27; rapid industrialization. Because these previously agrarian western states lay outside of the various Standard Oil&#x27;s production and refining networks, cities like Long Beach, California, Dallas, Texas, and Houston, Texas emerged as major centers for refining and managing these new fields under companies like Sunoco, Texaco, and Gulf Oil.

===Electricity===

Benjamin Franklin pioneered the study of electricity by being the first to describe positive and negative charges, as well as advancing the principle of conservation of charge. Franklin is best known for the apocryphal feat of flying a kite in thunderstorm to prove that lightning is a form of electricity which, in turn, led to the invention of the lightning rod to protect buildings.

Electricity would remain a novelty through the early to mid-19th century, but advances in battery storage, generating, and lighting would turn it into a domestic business. By the late 1870s and early 1880 central generating plants supplying power to arc lamps, first in Europe and then in the US, began spreading rapidly, replacing oil and gas for outdoor lighting, systems that ran on very high voltage (3,000–6,000 volt) direct current or alternating current. 

In 1880, Thomas Edison developed and patented a system for indoor lighting that competed with gas lighting, based on a long-lasting high resistance incandescent light bulb that ran on relatively low voltage (110 volt) direct current. Commercializing this venture was a task far beyond what Edison&#x27;s small laboratory could handle, requiring the setup of a large investor backed utility that involving companies that would manufacture the whole technological system upon which the &quot;light bulb&quot; would depend—generators (Edison Machine Company), cables (Edison Electric Tube Company), generating plants and electric service (Edison Electric Light Company), sockets, and bulbs.

In addition to lighting, electric motors (analogous to generators operating in reverse, or using a current to spin a magnet to perform work) became extremely important to industry. Speed control of early DC motors limited their use. Frank J. Sprague developed the first successful DC motor (ca. 1886) by solving the problem of varying speed with load. Within a few years DC motors were used in electric street railways. In 1888, a Serbian immigrant, Nikola Tesla, a former employee of Edison&#x27;s, patented an AC induction motor and licensed it to the Westinghouse Corporation. Electric motors eventually replaced steam engines in factories around the nation as they required neither complex mechanical transmissions from a central engine nor water sources for steam boilers in order to operate.

Edison&#x27;s direct current generation dominated the initial years of indoor commercial and residential electric lighting and electric power distribution. However, DC transmission was hampered by the difficulty in changing voltages between industrial generation and residential/commercial consumption and the low voltages used suffered from poor transmission efficiency. The mid-1880s saw the introduction of the transformer, allowing alternating current to be transmitted at high voltage long distances with greater efficiency and then &quot;stepped down&quot; to supply commercial and domestic indoor lighting, resulting in AC going from being the outdoor &quot;arc lighting current&quot; to taking over the domestic lighting utility market Edison&#x27;s DC system was designed to supply. The rapid spread of AC and haphazard installation of power lines, especially in the city of New York, led to a series of deaths attributed to high voltage AC and an eventual media backlash against the current. 

In 1888, the Edison company played up the dangers of AC power in their literature and assisted self-appointed anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a parallel goal to limit, to the point of ineffectiveness, the voltages in AC power systems, a market then dominated by Westinghouse Electric. This series of events came to be known as the war of the currents. Brown and Edison&#x27;s lobbying in state legislatures went nowhere and the Edison company continued to lose market share and profitability to the AC based companies. In 1892 the &quot;war&quot; ended with Thomas Edison losing any remaining control of his own company when it was merged with Westinghouse&#x27;s chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to form General Electric, creating a company that controlled three quarters of the US electrical business. Westinghouse&#x27;s lead in AC development would allow them to win a contract in 1893 to build an AC based power station at the Niagara Falls but the transmission contract was awarded to General Electric, who would come to dominate the US electrical business for many years afterwards.

As in other industries of the era, these companies achieved greater efficiencies by eventually merging to form conglomerated companies, with over a dozen electric companies in the 1880s merging down to just two, General Electric and Westinghouse. Lighting was immensely popular: between 1882 and 1920 the number of generating plants in the US increased from one in Downtown Manhattan to nearly 4,000. While the earliest generating plants were constructed in the immediate vicinity of consumers, plants generating electricity for long-distance transmissions were in place by 1900. To help finance this great expansion, the utility industry exploited a financial innovation known as the &quot;holding company&quot;; a favorite holding company investment among many was the Electric Bond and Share Company, later known as Ebasco, created by the GE company in 1905. The abuse of holding companies, like trusts before it, led to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, but by 1920, electricity had surpassed petroleum-based lighting sources that had dominated the previous century.

===Automobiles===

The technology for creating an automobile emerged in Germany in the 1870 and 1880s: Nicolaus Otto created a four-stroke internal combustion engine, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach modified the Otto engine to run at higher speeds, and Karl Benz pioneered the electric ignition. The Duryea brothers and Hiram Percy Maxim were among the first to construct a &quot;horseless carriage&quot; in the US in the mid-1890s, but these early cars proved to be heavy and expensive.

Henry Ford revolutionized the automobile manufacturing process by employing interchangeable parts on assembly lines—the beginning of industrial mass production. In 1908, the Ford Motor Company released the Ford Model T which could generate 20 horsepower, was lightweight, and easy to repair. Demand for the car was so great, he had to relocate his assembly plant to Highland Park, Michigan in 1912. The new plant was a model of industrial efficiency for the time: it was well lit and ventilated, employed conveyors to move parts along an assembly line, and workers&#x27; stations were orderly arranged along the line. The efficiency of the assembly line allowed Ford to realize great gains in economy and productivity; in 1912, Ford sold 6,000 cars for approximately $900 and by 1916 approximately 577,000 Model T automobiles were sold for $360. Ford was able to scale production rapidly because assembly-line workers were unskilled laborers performing repetitive tasks. Ford hired European immigrants, African-Americans, ex-convicts, and the disabled and paid comparatively high wages, but was quick to dismiss anyone involved in labor unions or radical political associations.

With growth of American automobile usage, urban and rural roads were gradually upgraded for the new traffic. Local automobile clubs formed the American Automobile Association to lobby city, state, and federal governments to widen and pave existing roads and build limited-access highways. Some federal road aid was passed in the 1910s and 1920s, resulting in major national highways like U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 66. The coverage and quality of many roads would greatly improve following Depression-era Works Progress Administration investment in road infrastructure. 

New automobile sales were temporarily slowed during World War II when wartime rationing and military production lines limited the number of automobiles that could be manufactured—the largest companies like Ford, GM, and Chrysler would survive those lean years. After the war, rising family sizes, increasing affluence, and government-subsidized mortgages for veterans fueled a boom in single-family homes. Many were automobile-owners. In 1956, Congress passed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 which provided funding for the construction of of toll-free expressways throughout the country laying the legislative and infrastructural foundations for the modern American highway system.

===Radio communication===

Radio communication, originally known as &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot;, was first developed in the 1890s. The first wireless transmissions were achieved by Guglielmo Marconi in Europe and they were first replicated in the United States in April 1899 by Professor Jerome Green at the University of Notre Dame. 

The spark-gap transmitters initially employed could only transmit the dots-and-dashes of Morse code. Despite this limitation, in 1905 a small number of U.S. Navy stations inaugurated daily time signal broadcasts. In 1913 the high-powered station NAA in Arlington, Virginia began broadcasting daily time signals and weather reports in Morse code which covered much of the eastern United States.

The leading early proponent of radio broadcasting in the United States was Lee de Forest, who employed versions of an arc transmitter
developed by Valdemar Poulsen to make a series of demonstrations beginning in 1907. From the outset de Forest noted the potential for regular entertainment broadcasts, envisioning &quot;the distribution of music from a central station&quot; and that &quot;by using four different forms of wave as many classes of music can be sent out as desired by the different subscribers&quot;. 

In the mid-1910s, the development of vacuum tube transmitters provided a significant improvement in the quality and reliability of audio transmissions. Lee de Forest established experimental station 2XG in New York City and conducted the first broadcast in 1916. Station KDKA in Pittsburgh was the first to offer regularly scheduled broadcasts in 1920.

Early radio receivers were developed in the 1890s and used a coherer, a primitive radio wave detector. Vacuum tube technology led to major improvements in receiving sets, both in detecting the radio signals via amplification and better audio quality. The Audion (triode) vacuum tube, invented by de Forest in 1906, was the first practical amplifying device and revolutionized radio. The advent of radio broadcasting increased the market for radio receivers greatly, and transformed them into a consumer product. By the 1930s, the broadcast receiver had become a common household item, with standardized controls that anyone could use.

The invention of the transistor in 1947 again revolutionized radio technology, making truly portable receivers possible, beginning with transistor radios in the late 1950s.

==Effects of industrialization==
===Agricultural production===
In the 1840s, as more and more western states joined the Union, many poor and middle-class Americans increasingly agitated for free land in these large, undeveloped areas. Early efforts to pass a Homestead Act by George Henry Evans and Horace Greeley were stymied by Southern states who feared that free land would threaten the plantation system. The Homestead Act was passed in 1862 after the opposing Southern states had seceded. The Homestead Act granted to farmers who lived on the land for 5 years or allowed the farmer to purchase the land after 6 months for .

Even as America&#x27;s westward expansion allowed over 400 million acres (1,600,000 km2) of new land to be put under cultivation, between 1870 and 1910 the number of Americans involved in farming or farm labor dropped by a third. New farming techniques and agricultural mechanization facilitated both processes. Cyrus McCormick&#x27;s reaper (invented in 1834) allowed farmers to quadruple their harvesting efficiency by replacing hand labor with a mechanical device. John Deere invented the steel plow in 1837, keeping the soil from sticking to the plow and making it easier to farm in the rich prairies of the Midwest. The harvester, self-binder, and combine allowed even greater efficiencies: wheat farmers in 1866 achieved an average yield of 9.9 bushels per acre but by 1898 yields had increased to 15.3 bushels per acre even as the total area had tripled.

Railroads allowed harvests to reach markets more quickly and Gustavus Franklin Swift&#x27;s refrigerated railroad car allowed fresh meat and fish to reach distant markets. Food distribution also became more mechanized as companies like Heinz and Campbell distributed previously perishable foods by canning and evaporation. Commercial bakeries, breweries, and meatpackers replaced locally owned operators and drove demand for raw agricultural goods. Despite increasing demand, rising production caused a drop in prices, creating substantial discontent among farmers. Organizations like The Grange and Farmers Alliance emerged to demand monetary policy that allowed for money supply expansion (as most farmers carried significant debt from planting time to harvest time), railroad regulations, and protective tariffs.

===Urbanization===

The period between 1865 and 1920 was marked by the increasing concentration of people, political power, and economic activity in urban areas. In 1860, there were nine cities with populations over 100,000 and by 1910 there were fifty. These new large cities were not coastal port cities (like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia) but laid inland along new transportation routes, including Chicago, Cleveland, and Denver. The first twelve presidents of the United States had all been born into farming communities, but between 1865 and 1912 the presidency was filled by men with backgrounds of representing businesses and cities.

Industrialization and urbanization reinforced each other and urban areas became increasingly congested. As a result of unsanitary living conditions, diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever struck urban areas with increasing frequency. Cities responded by paving streets, digging sewers, sanitizing water, constructing housing, and creating public transportation systems.
====Transit====

The first large-scale electric trolley line in the world, the Richmond Union Passenger Railway opened on Feb. 2, 1888.
The first interurban tram-train was the Newark and Granville Street Railway in Ohio, which opened in 1889.
The first non-experimental trolleybus system was installed near Nantasket Beach in 1904; the first year-round commercial line was built to open a hilly property to development just outside Los Angeles in 1910.
In 1912, articulated trams were invented and first used by the Boston Elevated Railway.

===Labor issues and immigration===
As the nation deepened its technological base, old-fashioned artisans and craftsmen became &quot;deskilled&quot; and replaced by specialized workers and engineers who used machines to replicate in minutes or hours work that would require a journeyman hours or days to complete. Frederick W. Taylor, recognizing the inefficiencies introduced by some production lines, proposed that by studying the motions and processes necessary to manufacture each component of a product, reorganizing the factory and manufacturing processes around workers, and paying workers piece rates would allow great gains in process efficiency. Scientific management, or &quot;Taylorism&quot; as it came to be known, was soon being applied by progressive city governments to make their urban areas more efficient and by suffragettes to home economics.

Increasing industrialization outpaced the supply of laborers able or willing to work in dangerous, low-paying, and dead-end jobs. However, the demand for low or unskilled jobs drove wages up and attracted waves of Irish, Italian, Polish, Russian, and Jewish immigrants who could earn more in America than in their homelands.

The earliest unions emerged before the Civil War as trade guilds composed of journeyman carpenters, masons, and other artisans who would engage in strikes to demand better hours and pay from their masters. All branches of government generally sought to stop labor from organizing into unions or from organizing strikes.

===Banking, trading, and financial services===
To finance the larger-scale enterprises required during this era, the Stockholder Corporation emerged as the dominant form of business organization. Corporations expanded by combining into trusts, and by creating single firms out of competing firms, known as monopolies.

===Regulation===

The Progressive movement and the Progressive Era that emerged from it was in part a reaction to excesses of the new industrial age. &quot;Muckraking&quot; journalists reported on a wide array of social issues, and the reaction of the public lent urgency to reforms that led to increased government regulation, such as the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 (pertaining to railroads), and the Meat Inspection Act and Pure Food and Drug Act (1906).

==Military-industrial-academic complex==

In the 20th century, the pace of technological developments increasingly became tied into a complex set of interactions between Congress, the industrial manufacturers, university research, and the military establishment. This set of relations, known more popularly as the &quot;military-industrial complex&quot;, emerged because the military&#x27;s unique technological demands, concentration of funding, large-scale application, and highly centralized control played a dominant role in driving technological innovation. Fundamental advances in medicine, physics, chemistry, computing, aviation, material science, naval architecture, and meteorology, and other fields, can be traced back to basic and applied research for military applications. 

Smokestack America became a nickname applied to traditional manufacturing core of U.S. industry, used to represent particular industries, regions, or towns.

===Research universities===
The first universities in the United States were modeled on the liberal curricula of the great English universities and were meant to educate clergymen and lawyers rather than teach vocational skills or conduct scientific research. The U.S. Military Academy, established in 1811, broke the mold of traditional universities and military academies alike by including practical engineering-related subjects in its earliest curricula. 

By the middle of the 19th century, polytechnic institutes were being founded in increasing numbers to train students in the scientific and technical skills needed to design, build, and operate increasingly complex machines. In 1824, Stephen van Rensselaer established the first American institute granting a bachelor&#x27;s degree in technical subjects and in the 1850s several Ivy League schools began to offer courses of study in scientific fields.

Congressional legislators, recognizing the increasing importance and prevalence of these eastern polytechnic schools, passed the 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act providing large grants of land that were to be used toward establishing and funding the educational institutions that would teach courses on military tactics, engineering, and agriculture. 

Many of the United States&#x27; noted public research universities can trace their origins back to land grant colleges. Between 1900 and 1939, enrollments in post-secondary institutes increased from 238,000 to 1,494,000 and higher education had become so available and affordable that a college degree was increasingly required for scientific, engineering, and government jobs that previously only required only vocational or secondary education.

After World War II, the GI Bill caused university enrollments to explode as millions of veterans earned college degrees.

The introduction of the airplane to the battlefield was one of the most radical changes in the history of warfare. The history of flight spans hundreds of years and the distinction of building the first flying machine is complicated, but in December 1903 the Wright Brothers achieved sustained, piloted, and controlled heavier-than-air flight. The Wright brothers had difficulty raising funding from the government and military, but after World War I began in 1914, airplanes quickly assumed great tactical importance for both sides (&quot;see&quot; Aviation in World War I); the US government appropriated $640 million in 1917 to procure 20,000 airplanes for the war for aerial reconnaissance, dogfighting, and aerial bombing. 

After the close of the war in 1918, the US government continued to fund peacetime aeronautical activities like airmail and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, industrial, university, and military research continued to realize gains in the power, maneuverability, and reliability of airplanes: Charles Lindbergh completed a solo non-stop transatlantic flight in 1927, Wiley Post flew around the world in nine days in 1931, and Howard Hughes shattered flight airspeed records throughout the decade. In the 1930s, passenger airlines boomed as a result of the Kelley Act, state and local governments began constructing airports to attract airlines, and the federal government began to regulate air traffic control and investigate aviation accidents and incidents.

===Cold War and Space Race===
The American physicist Robert Goddard was one of the first scientists to experiment with rocket propulsion systems. In his small laboratory in Worcester, Massachusetts, Goddard worked with liquid oxygen and gasoline to propel rockets into the atmosphere, and in 1926 successfully fired the world&#x27;s first liquid-fuel rocket which reached a height of 12.5 meters. Over the next 10 years, Goddard&#x27;s rockets achieved modest altitudes of nearly two kilometers, and interest in rocketry increased in the United States, Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union.

At the end of World War II, both the American and Russian forces recruited or smuggled top German scientists like Wernher von Braun back to their respective countries to continue defense-related work. Expendable rockets provided the means for launching artificial satellites, as well as crewed spacecraft. In 1957 the Soviet Union launched the first satellite, Sputnik I, and the United States followed with Explorer I in 1958. The first crewed space flights were made in early 1961, first by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin and then by American astronaut Alan Shepard.

From those first tentative steps, to the 1969 Apollo program landing on the Moon, to the reusable Space Shuttle, the American space program has created a large display of applied science. Communications satellites transmit computer data, telephone calls, and radio and television broadcasts. Weather satellites furnish the data necessary to provide early warnings of severe storms.

===Health care and biotechnology===
As in physics and chemistry, Americans have dominated the Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine since World War II. The private sector has been the focal point for biomedical research in the United States, and has played a key role in this achievement. As of 2000, for-profit industry funded 57%, non-profit private organizations funded 7%, and the tax-funded National Institutes of Health funded 36% of medical research in the U.S. Funding by private industry increased 102% from 1994 to 2003.

The National Institutes of Health consists of 24 separate institutes supporting the prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and disabilities. At any given time, grants from the NIH support the research of about 35,000 principal investigators, working in every US state and several foreign countries. Between 1971 and 1991, mortality from heart disease dropped 41 percent, strokes decreased by 59 percent, and today more than 70 percent of children who get cancer are cured.

Molecular genetics and genomics research have revolutionized biomedical sciences. In the 1980s and 1990s, researchers performed the first trial of gene therapy in humans and are now able to locate, identify, and describe the function of many genes in the human genome.

Research conducted by universities, hospitals, and corporations also contributes to improvement in diagnosis and treatment of disease. NIH funded the basic research on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), for example. Many of the drugs used to treat this disease have emerged from the laboratories of the American pharmaceutical industry.

==Technology and society==

This section discusses technology, scientific studies, engineering, and overall impact.

===Computers and information networks===

American researchers made fundamental advances in telecommunications and information technology. For example, AT&amp;T&#x27;s Bell Laboratories spearheaded the American technological revolution with a series of inventions including the light emitting diode (LED), the transistor, the C programming language, and the UNIX computer operating system. SRI International and Xerox PARC in Silicon Valley helped give birth to the personal computer industry, while ARPA and NASA funded the development of the ARPANET and the Internet. Companies like IBM and Apple Computer developed personal computers while Microsoft created operating systems and office productivity software to run on them. 

With the growth of information on the World Wide Web, search companies like Yahoo! and Google developed technologies to sort and rank web pages based on relevance. The web also has become a site for computer-mediated social interactions and web services like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter are used by millions to communicate. Moore&#x27;s Law and the increasing pervasiveness and speed of wireless networks had led to substantial adoption of mobile phones and increasingly powerful smartphones based on software platforms like Apple&#x27;s iOS and Google&#x27;s Android.

<text>In Greek mythology, Elara , Elare or Alera (Ancient Greek: Ἐλάρα, Ἐλάραη or Ἀλέρα), also called Larissa, was a mortal princess, the daughter of King Orchomenus and mother of the giant Tityos by Zeus. In some accounts, she was described as the daughter of Minyas instead.

== Myth ==
Zeus fell in love with Elara and hid her from his wife Hera&#x27;s jealous rage by placing her deep beneath the Earth. This was where she gave birth to Tityos, a giant who is sometimes said to be the son of Gaia, the Earth goddess, for the reason being an earth-born (γηγενής &quot;gigenis&quot; &quot;native&quot;) and brought up under the earth. It is further added that Elara died in labour because of the enormous size of her baby.

The cave through which Tityos was believed to have come to the surface of Earth was located on Euboea and referred to as &quot;Elarion&quot;.

== Eponymy ==
One moon of Jupiter is named Elara.

<doc id="532822" wikidata="Q5518837" url="?curid=532822" title="Gallagher and Shean">
<text>Gallagher &amp; Shean was a highly successful musical comedy double act in vaudeville and on Broadway in the 1910s and 1920s, consisting of Ed Gallagher (1873–1929) and Al Shean (1868–1949); Shean was the maternal uncle of the Marx Brothers.

==Career==
Both comedians were relatively obscure vaudeville performers until they teamed up in 1910. Gallagher and Shean first joined forces during the tour of &quot;The Rose Maid&quot; in 1912, but they quarreled and split up two years later, in 1914. They next appeared together in 1920, to star in the Shubert Brothers&#x27; production of the highly successful &quot;Cinderella on Broadway&quot;, through the efforts of Shean&#x27;s sister, Minnie Marx (mother of the Marx Brothers). This pairing lasted until 1925 and led to their fame. 

Gallagher and Shean remain best known for their theme song &quot;Mister Gallagher and Mister Shean&quot;, which was a hit in the 1922 &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. Bryan Foy, son of stage star Eddie Foy and eldest member of the &quot;Seven Little Foys&quot;, said he had written the song, but it is officially attributed to Gallagher and Shean. The song is also sometimes called &quot;Absolutely, Mr. Gallagher? Positively, Mr. Shean!&quot; The song endured in popularity and was regularly tweaked and updated with additional verses; consequently, it exists in several different versions. The song was recorded by Gallagher and Shean as two sides of a 10&quot; 78 rpm record in 1922 for Victor Records. It was also recorded on Okeh Records by The Happiness Boys (Billy Jones and Ernie Hare) and on Cameo Records by Irving and Jack Kaufman, and even in Yiddish on Banner Records, by M. Z. Feinman Brothers. When performed by other artists, it was usually preceded with this introductory lyric:

:There are two funny men
:The best I&#x27;ve ever seen
:One is Mr. Gallagher
:And the other Mr. Shean

:When these two cronies meet
:Why it surely is a treat
:The things they say
:And the things they do
:And the funny way they greet ...

The song was extremely popular and well remembered: a pastiche was included in &quot;The Cabaret Girl&quot;, a 1922 musical produced in London; a parody of it was recorded by Bing Crosby and Johnny Mercer in the late 1930s; another parody was performed by Jackie Gleason and Groucho Marx (who was Al Shean&#x27;s nephew) on television in 1967; and Lenny Bruce was able to make an offhanded reference to it in his nightclub act of the 1960s, all of them confident that audiences would recognize it right away.

Each verse ended with a question-and-answer refrain, one of which—Shean singing &quot;Absolutely, Mister Gallagher?&quot; and Gallagher replying &quot;Positively, Mister Shean!&quot;—became their tagline. This cross-talk format continues to be imitated, parodied, and referenced for audiences who may have no knowledge of the original. Cartoonist Bobby London depicted his characters &quot;Dirty Duck&quot; and Weevil telling each other &quot;Posilutely, Weevil!&quot; &quot;Absotively, Mr. Duck!&quot; In the 1960s, an Australian cleaning product &quot;Mister Sheen&quot; launched a successful TV campaign using the original tune with new lyrics (&quot;Oh, Mr. Sheen, Oh, Mr. Sheen&quot;), as did several 1980s radio commercials for Pitney Bowes office equipment: &quot;Absolutely, Mister Pitney!&quot; &quot;Positively, Mister Bowes!&quot;

Capitalizing on the post-King Tut craze for everything Egyptian, Gallagher and Shean appeared in Egyptian dress (Gallagher in the pith helmet and white suit of the tourist, Shean in the fez and oddly skirted jacket of a &quot;native&quot; Egyptian colonial).

==Later life and career==
In 1921, they were sued by The Shubert Organization for breach of contract. According to Shubert, they could not perform for the competing &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. The plaintiff claimed that Gallagher and Shean&#x27;s act was &quot;unique and irreplaceable&quot;. The comedians&#x27; defense was that their act was mediocre, and the judge initially found in their favor, although the decision was later reversed.

For a time in the 1920s, Gallagher was involved with his protegee, vivacious French-Canadian dancer Fifi D&#x27;Orsay. In 1925, inventor Theodore Case made a short film of them in his sound-on-film process at his Auburn, New York, studio; however, the film was lost in a fire at the Auburn studio in the mid-1950s, and only outtakes of the film now exist. In August 1931, Fleischer Studios released a short cartoon, &quot;Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean&quot;, as part of the Fleischer Screen Songs series. In this short, Jack Kenny (1886–1964) did the voice of Gallagher.

Gallagher and Shean often had personal differences during their partnership. The constant backstage hostilities inspired Neil Simon to incorporate them into his successful show business-themed comedy &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot;.

Ed Gallagher suffered a nervous breakdown after the partnership ended in 1925 and died in 1929; Al Shean worked occasionally thereafter as a solo character actor. The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical &quot;Ziegfeld Girl&quot; (1941) features a recreation of Gallagher and Shean&#x27;s act with Al Shean in his familiar role and costume and character actor Charles Winninger portraying Gallagher. Also The Republic Pictures musical &quot;Atlantic City&quot; (1944) features a recreation of Gallagher and Shean&#x27;s act with Al Shean and character actor Jack Kenney portraying Gallagher.

Ed Gallagher&#x27;s wife, Helen, became a partner in Gallagher&#x27;s Steak House in New York City and the restaurant was named after her. After Ed&#x27;s death, she married her partner, Jack Solomon.

<doc id="532824" wikidata="Q3090521" url="?curid=532824" title="Roger Abbott">
<text>Roger Abbott (July 10, 1946March 26, 2011) was an English-born Canadian sketch comedian who was a founding member of the long-lived Canadian comedy troupe &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;, and remained one of its stars and writers until his death.

==Early life==
Abbott was born in Birkenhead, England; at age 7, he and his family moved to Montreal. While attending Loyola High School, he met Don Ferguson, who would become a co-star of Royal Canadian Air Farce. After graduation in 1963, he attended Loyola College (now Concordia University).

==Career==
Abbott began his career in behind-the-scene jobs in radio. In 1970, comedians John Morgan and Martin Bronstein, who were looking for non-actors who could write and perform their own material, convinced Abbott to join the cast of an improvisational theatre revue called &quot;The Jest Society&quot; (a pun on then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s famous goal of making Canada a &quot;Just Society&quot;). After a number of personnel changes, the troupe — now consisting of Abbott, Morgan, Bronstein, Don Ferguson, Luba Goy and Dave Broadfoot— became known as the Royal Canadian Air Farce. On December 9, 1973, they began a weekly broadcast on CBC radio in front of a live audience at the CBC&#x27;s Parliament Street studio in Toronto. Abbott quickly showed his organizational abilities — Don Ferguson called him &quot;the guiding light of Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; and &quot;a combination of artistic, organizational and business talent&quot;. Abbott also became the &quot;warm-up man&quot; for the weekly broadcasts, chatting to the audience before introducing the rest of the cast. Abbott said the greatest influences on his style of comedy were Dave Broadfoot and the British comedy troupe Monty Python. Bronstein left the troupe the following year—the remaining members became the ongoing cast of Royal Canadian Air Farce for many years.

Air Farce branched into television in 1980 with a 10-week series of television shows for CBC, although they continued to produce their weekly radio show. About the same time, the producers of the American sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot; offered Abbott and Ferguson a chance to be writers on the show, but they turned the offer down.

In 1989, Abbott directed &quot;Huge Jumbo Comedy Thing&quot;, a show starring a troupe called the Maroons that CHOM-FM described as &quot;Canada&#x27;s answer to Monty Python&quot;.

For many years, Abbott and Don Ferguson co-hosted the annual televised Easter Seals Telethon.

In 1992, &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; returned to television, this time as a weekly series, although the weekly radio series also continued to be produced until 1997. Abbott became well known for many roles on the television show, including parodies of Jean Chrétien, The Queen Mother, Yasser Arafat, Leonard Cohen, George W. Bush, Brian Williams, Peter Mansbridge, Don Newman, Craig Oliver, and &quot;Native Persons Spokesman&quot; Billy Two-Willies.

The title of the television show changed several times, first shortened to &quot;Air Farce&quot;, then to &quot;Air Farce Live&quot;, and in its final season (2008–2009), &quot;Air Farce Live—The Final Flight&quot;. Air Farce continued to produce occasional specials for CBC, and Abbott&#x27;s last appearance on Air Farce was their New Year&#x27;s Eve special that aired on December 31, 2010.

==Death==
Abbott was diagnosed with the progressive disease chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 1997, but only shared this fact with family and close friends. After a 14-year battle, he succumbed to leukemia on March 26, 2011, at Toronto General Hospital at the age of 64.

==Tributes==
*A video tribute to Abbott from his friends and colleagues at Royal Canadian Air Farce was posted on YouTube on March 27, 2011.
*An hour-long tribute to Abbott, featuring many of his memorable sketches, aired on CBC Television on March 29, 2011.

*A memorial service entitled &quot;Roger&#x27;s Wrap Party&quot; was held in Toronto on April 11, 2011. Speakers included Jessica Holmes, Dave Broadfoot, Vicki Gabereau, Luba Goy, and Don Ferguson.
*The Air Farce New Years Day special was dedicated to the memory of Roger Abbott. A small segment was shown with the donut foursome sitting at the table with the also late John Morgan. At the end of the special, the message &quot;Dedicated to the Memory of Roger Abbott&quot; appeared on screen.

<text>Luba Goy (; born November 8, 1945) is a Canadian actress, comedian and one of the stars of &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;.

==Life and career==
Goy was born in Haltern, Germany, to Ukrainian parents and raised in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. They immigrated to Canada in 1951. She is a graduate of the Glebe Collegiate Institute in Ottawa, Ontario. In 1969, she graduated from the National Theatre School of Canada, then went on to act in theatre productions in Stratford, Ontario. In 1971, she joined &quot;The Jest Society&quot;, a comedy troupe, which evolved into the Royal Canadian Air Farce in 1973. In the early 1980s, she starred (as herself, alongside Billy Van) in an educational series on computers called &quot;Bits and Bytes&quot;. Produced by TVOntario, the show was aired by PBS stations in the United States.

Later that decade, she played &quot;Lotsa Heart Elephant&quot;, &quot;Treat Heart Pig&quot; and &quot;Gentle Heart Lamb&quot; in Nelvana&#x27;s animated Care Bears franchise. As part of the Air Farce team, Goy has won 15 ACTRA awards, a Juno, the Maclean&#x27;s Honour Roll, and was among the first Canadians to be inducted into the International Humour Hall of Fame. In 1993, Goy and her Air Farce cast members received Honorary Doctor of Law degrees from Brock University. In 1996, Goy received the Outstanding Achievement Award from Women in Film and Television. In 1998, Goy, along with her Air Farce colleagues, received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts.

She has also done voices for various animated TV series featuring &quot;The Elephant Show&quot;, &quot;Babar&quot;, &quot;AlfTales&quot;, &quot;My Pet Monster&quot;, &quot;Sylvanian Families&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Cryptkeeper&quot;, &quot;The Rosey and Buddy Show&quot;, &quot;Rupert&quot;, &quot;The New Archies&quot;, &quot;Little Shop&quot;, &quot;Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors&quot;, and &quot;Wild C.A.T.s&quot;.

Within the Ukrainian Canadian community she occasionally has comedy performances that highlight her Ukrainian heritage. One such example was her involvement in 1999 with the Ukrainian pavilion at Folklorama, a cultural festival in Winnipeg, Manitoba. She speaks Ukrainian fluently. Goy&#x27;s film roles have included an 18th-century innkeeper in the Ukrainian film &quot;Vid&#x27;ma&quot; (Відьма, Witch), filmed in 1990 in Kyiv.

In 2011, she performed at the Toronto Ukrainian Festival. In May 2012 Goy debuted her one-person show &quot;Luba, Simply Luba&quot; at the Berkeley Street Theatre, Toronto. Goy has performed at the Riverdale Share concerts at the Danforth Music Hall and St Barnabas Church.

<text>Edmund Theodore Sylvers (January 25, 1957 – March 11, 2004) was an American singer–songwriter, actor and musician. Sylvers was best known as the lead singer of the American family disco/soul music vocal group The Sylvers, which had popular success with songs such as &quot;Boogie Fever&quot; during the mid- to late-1970s.

==Biography==
Born in Memphis, Tennessee, and raised in Los Angeles, California, Sylvers was the fifth child born to Shirley Mae (née Wyble) (1932 – 2014) and Leon Frank Sylvers Jr. (1932 – 2005). At the age of 14, he began his entertainment career as a voice actor playing the role of Marlon Jackson on the ABC–TV cartoon series &quot;The Jackson 5ive&quot;. After the series ended when he was 15, Sylvers joined his family-based group as the lead singer, and he was 18 in 1975 when he sang lead on the group&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Boogie Fever&quot;. After the group&#x27;s success passed, Sylvers embarked on a solo career, releasing his debut &quot;Have You Heard&quot; in 1980.

===Personal life===
Sylvers dated singer Freda Payne (who was 15 years his senior) from 1979 until January 1983. Sylvers had 11 children, one of whom is actor Jeremy Sylvers, who is most known for his role in the 1991 horror film &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot;. After a ten-month battle with lung cancer, Edmund Sylvers died at a Virginia hospital on March 11, 2004, at age 47.

<text>Jessica Holmes (born August 29, 1973) is a Canadian comedian and actress. She is best known for her work with the show &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;, which she joined in 2003, after starring in her own show, &quot;The Holmes Show&quot; in 2002. She is also an advocate for mental health issues and is married to actor Scott Yaphe.

== Early life ==
Born and raised in Ottawa, Canada, Holmes is the daughter of a feminist mother and a Mormon father. She joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) at age 19, and for 18 months she was a Mormon missionary in Venezuela. She is no longer a member of the LDS Church.

She attended Canterbury High School for the Performing Arts in Ottawa, majoring in Drama. Combining stand up, music and improvisation, she honed her skills and her improv team won Gold at the National High School Improv games.

Holmes moved to Toronto in 1993 to attend Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University) where she majored in writing in the Radio &amp; Television Arts BFA program and spent her free time involved in comedy. She started acting in and then directing the annual sketch comedy show, titled RIOT. On a dare, she tried stand-up comedy and performed at amateur night at The Laugh Resort. After that she decided to try it on as a career.

After graduating, Holmes began performing stand-up and comedic monologues at local clubs. She was immediately recognized for her ability to transform herself into dozens of celebrity characters.

== Career ==
=== Actress and comedian ===

In 1999 Holmes landed several appearances at the Just for Laughs international comedy festival in Montreal. She joined Toronto&#x27;s legendary Second City, where she co-wrote and performed in two shows.

During those years, she appeared on TV shows like &quot;History Bites&quot; (History Channel) and &quot;Laughing Matters&quot;, and starred in her first series entitled &quot;Little Big Kid&quot; on YTV. She was nominated for several 2000 and 2001 Canadian Comedy Awards for her TV and sketch comedy work.
Holmes co-wrote and starred in the Comedy Network series &quot;The Itch&quot;, and the CTV comedy/music series &quot; Sonic Temple&quot;. She went on to write and star in her own one-hour comedy special for CTV titled &quot;Holmes Alone&quot;. For the special, Holmes received a Gemini nomination as well as the Platinum Award at the Houston International Comedy Festival. 

The success of &quot;Holmes Alone&quot; led to the creation of &quot;The Holmes Show&quot;, a Carol Burnett-style sketch comedy series on CTV &amp; The Comedy Network involving edgy satire and celebrity parodies.

Holmes performed in the American films &quot;Citizen Duane&quot; and &quot;Welcome to Mooseport&quot;; and the television series &quot;Zoe Busiek: Wildcard&quot;. 

That was followed by a few guest spots on &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;, where she was invited to become the first &quot;added&quot; cast member since the show began 11 years earlier. She starred on the hit show for five years and participated in reunion specials.
On both &quot;The Holmes Show&quot; and &quot;Air Farce&quot;, she became well known for performing caricatures of various celebrities, including Celine Dion, Liza Minnelli, Geri Halliwell, and Britney Spears.

She also appeared in the television series &quot;XPM&quot;, &quot;Debra&quot;, &quot;That’s My DJ&quot;, and &quot;The Communist&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (CBC Gem), for which she received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Lead Performance in a Web Program or Series at the 10th Canadian Screen Awards in 2022.

On stage, Holmes has appeared in several Ross Petty&#x27;s annual Christmas pantomime family musicals at the Toronto&#x27;s Elgin Theatre, including &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;Wizard Of Oz&quot;, and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.

As a comedian, Holmes has opened for Ellen DeGeneres, Russell Peters, Jerry Seinfeld, and Leslie Nielsen.
=== Author ===

Holmes’ first memoir, &quot;I Love Your Laugh: Finding the Light in My Screwball Life&quot;, was published by McClelland &amp; Stewart in 2011.

Her second book, &quot; Depression The Comedy: A Tale of Perseverance&quot;, speaks of her journey with depression. It was named one of the top 25 books about mental health by &quot;Reader’s Digest&quot; and was named one of the top 40 books on mental health by &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;.

=== Speaker and mental-health advocate ===

Holmes experienced postpartum depression after the birth of her second child, and once she recovered, she became trained as a Wellness &amp; Life Coach through San Diego’s Life Purpose Institute.

In 2011 she developed a series of comedic keynotes on the subject of mental health. She has performed them for companies like Toronto Hydro, Deloitte, Eli Lilly, Credit Institute of Canada, TD, RBC, Scottsdale Insurance, Goodlife Fitness, Prudential Financial, Pepsico, Walmart, Sun Life, Lindt &amp; Sprüngli, Comcast, and Remax. 

Holmes has hosted events for such visionaries as Deepak Chopra, Tony Robbins, and Oprah Winfrey.

As a speaker, she strives to help end the stigma around mental illness and in 2018 joined the Bell Let’s Talk team as a celebrity ambassador.

== Today ==

In 2024 she commenced her Master&#x27;s degree in Applied Positive Psychology from the University of East London. She credits positive psychology with playing a pivotal role in helping her thrive after depression.

She continues to perform across Canada and the United States through Speaker&#x27;s Spotlight as a comedian and keynote speaker and has become one of the most requested mental health speakers in Canada. 

Holmes currently lives in Toronto with her actor husband Scott Yaphe and their two children Alexa and Jordan.

<doc id="532837" wikidata="Q932126" url="?curid=532837" title="Monophthong">
<text>A monophthong ( ; , ) is a pure vowel sound, one whose articulation at only beginning and end is relatively fixed, and which does not glide up or down towards a new position of articulation. The monophthongs can be contrasted with diphthongs, where the vowel quality changes within the same syllable, and hiatus, where two vowels are next to each other in different syllables. A vowel sound whose quality does not change over the duration of the vowel is called a pure vowel.

==Sound changes==

The conversions of monophthongs to diphthongs (diphthongization), and of diphthongs to monophthongs (monophthongization), are major elements of language change and are likely the cause of further changes.

In some languages, due to monophthongization, graphemes that originally represented diphthongs now represent monophthongs.

<text>ABET (pronounced A-bet), formerly known as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc., is a non-governmental accreditation organization for post-secondary programs in engineering, engineering technology, computing, and applied and natural sciences.

 ABET had accredited 4,674 programs across 920 organizations in 42 countries. ABET also accredits online educational programs.

==History==
In 1932, ABET was established as the American Engineers&#x27; Council for Professional Development (ECPD). The organization evaluated its first engineering program in 1936, and by 1947, 580 programs had been accredited across 133 institutions.

In 1980, the ECPD changed its name to the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. In 1985, the organization helped establish the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board (CSAB), one of ABET&#x27;s largest member societies with over 300 programs. ABET began operating and doing business solely under their acronym in 2005, using “Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc.” as their corporate name only when required by law.

==Accreditation process==
The request for ABET accreditation is initiated by the institution seeking accreditation. Accreditation is given to individual programs rather than to the institution as a whole. Re-evaluation is required every six years. Programs with no previous accreditation can request accreditation if they have produced at least one program graduate.

Each program is assigned to one of four accreditation commissions within ABET based on the title. Each commission has different accreditation criteria:

* Applied and Natural Science Accreditation Commission (ANSAC)
* Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC)
* Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC)
* Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC)
Programs conduct an internal evaluation and complete a self-study report documenting how well the program is meeting established accreditation criteria.

The appropriate ABET commission appoints a team chair to lead the on-campus evaluation visit. The team chair and program evaluators (typically one per program requesting accreditation) are made up of volunteers from academia, government, industry, and private practice. During the visit to the institution, the evaluation team reviews program course materials and interacts with students and faculty, culminating in an exit interview with the dean. Following the team&#x27;s visit, the institution is given 7 days to address any topics communicated during the exit interview. ABET provides an evaluation statement to the institution, who is given 30 more days to respond to any additional issues.

== Criteria ==
ABET specifies the minimum curriculum requirements for various engineering programs, including a capstone project and a design class. Because of the organization&#x27;s involvement, engineering curricula are somewhat standardized across the bachelor&#x27;s level.

==Members==
ABET is a federation of the following professional and technical member societies representing the fields of applied science, computing, engineering and engineering technology:
* American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists (AAEES)
* American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA)
* American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)
* American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE)
* American Nuclear Society (ANS)
* American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)
* American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)

* Society of Women Engineers (SWE)
* The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society (TMS)
* Women in Engineering Proactive Network (WEPAN)

==EC 2000==
For most of its history, ABET&#x27;s accreditation criteria specifically outlined the major elements that accredited engineering programs must have, including the program curricula, the faculty type and the facilities. However, in the mid-1990s, the engineering community began to question the appropriateness of such rigid accreditation requirements.

After intense discussion, in 1997, ABET adopted Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC2000). The EC2000 criteria shifted the focus away from the inputs (what material is taught) and to the outputs (what students learned). EC2000 stresses continuous improvement and accounts for specific missions and goals of the individual institutions and programs. 
The intention of this approach was to enable innovation in engineering programs rather than forcing all programs to conform to a standard, as well as to encourage new assessment processes and program improvements.

== ISO 9000:2015 ==
ABET Accreditation is certified by the International Organization for Standardization. ISO 9000 family of quality management systems standards is designed to help organizations ensure that they meet the needs of customers and other stakeholders while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service.

==Licensing and credentialing==
To become a licensed professional engineer, one common prerequisite is graduation from an Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET-accredited program. Requirements for professional engineer testing for EAC accredited programs vary from state to state.

The Engineering Credential Evaluation International (ECEI) was established in 1997 as the credential evaluation service of ABET. ECEI specialized in the evaluation of degrees in engineering, engineering technology, computer science and surveying from outside the U.S. ECEI stopped accepting applications for credentials evaluation; a business decision made by the ABET board of directors.

<doc id="532843" wikidata="Q5152945" url="?curid=532843" title="Committee for Non-Violent Action">
<text>The Committee for Non-Violent Action (CNVA) was an American anti-war group, formed in 1957 to resist the US government&#x27;s program of nuclear weapons testing. It was one of the first organizations to employ nonviolent direct action to protest against the nuclear arms race.

The CNVA&#x27;s immediate antecedent, a committee known as Non-Violent Action Against Nuclear Weapons, was formed by radical Quaker Lawrence Scott. Other leaders of the CNVA included A.J. Muste, Albert Bigelow, Bayard Rustin and George Willoughby.

==History==
In August 1957, members of the CNVA were arrested when they attempted to enter the Camp Mercury nuclear testing grounds near Las Vegas, Nevada. In February 1958, Albert Bigelow and the crew of the &quot;Golden Rule&quot; were intercepted by the US Coast Guard five nautical miles (9 km) from Honolulu, Hawaii, as they attempted to sail their vessel into the Eniwetok Proving Grounds, the US test site in the Marshall Islands. Two further attempts to defy a hastily enacted regulation banning US citizens from sailing to the test site led to the arrest and 60-day imprisonment of the crew.

The voyage of the &quot;Golden Rule&quot; inspired anthropologist Earle L. Reynolds and his family to undertake a similar journey, and on 1 July 1958, their yacht, &quot;Phoenix of Hiroshima&quot;, entered the test zone at Bikini Atoll. The &quot;Phoenix&quot; penetrated into the test area before the vessel was boarded by the Coast Guard and ordered to sail to Kwajalein atoll, where Reynolds was charged with violating the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s new regulation.

In 1958, a CNVA group from Philadelphia travelled to Cheyenne, Wyoming, to raise consciousness and to convince locals to oppose the construction of Atlas missile sites at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base.

In 1959, CNVA sponsored protests at the construction site of an intercontinental ballistic missile near Omaha, Nebraska. Around 15 protestors, including A.J. Muste and Karl H. Meyer, the son of Vermont Senator William Meyer, were arrested and handcuffed as they climbed the fence to invade the site. They were each sentenced to six months in jail. In 1960, the group co-ordinated nonviolent protests against construction of the nuclear weapons equipped Polaris submarine in New London, Connecticut.

During the early 1960s, the CNVA organised two &#x27;Walks for Peace&#x27;, including a march from San Francisco to Moscow, during which the walkers called on the governments of the world to disarm. During a Walk for Peace from Quebec to Cuba, via Washington, D.C., walkers were attacked and jailed as black and white activists walked together through Macon, Georgia. Both walks were led by peace activist Bradford Lyttle.

In 1962, the Cambridge Nonviolent Action Committee (CNAC) on the Eastern shore of Maryland led protests in their city that led to the declaration of Martial Law. On July 23, the Kennedy Administration intervened, negotiating an agreement with the city for, among other things, the complete desegregation of public schools and public accommodations. 

In the mid-1960s, CNVA began to focus on the Vietnam War. Activists traveled to Hanoi in Vietnam and picketed the US embassy, and the CNVA advocated tax refusal as a method of resistance.

In 1968, after the 1967 death of leader A.J. Muste, the CNVA merged with the pacifist War Resisters League.

==Legacy==
While never a mass-membership organization, the CNVA&#x27;s pioneering use of nonviolent direct action would have a significant influence on movements to follow. In particular, it was the example set by the voyages of the &quot;Golden Rule&quot; and the &quot;Phoenix&quot; that would inspire the first Greenpeace activists to use similar methods in their campaigns to halt nuclear testing at the island of Amchitka, Alaska, and at Muraroa Atoll in the Pacific.

<text>A clonogenic assay is a cell biology technique for studying the effectiveness of specific agents on the survival and proliferation of cells. It is frequently used in cancer research laboratories to determine the effect of drugs or radiation on proliferating tumor cells as well as for titration of Cell-killing Particles (CKPs) in virus stocks. It was first developed by T.T. Puck and Philip I. Marcus at the University of Colorado in 1955.

Although this technique can provide accurate results, the assay is time-consuming to set up and analyze and can only provide data on tumor cells that can grow in culture. The word &quot;clonogenic&quot; refers to the fact that these cells are clones of one another.

==Procedure==
The experiment involves three major steps:

# The treatment is applied to a sample of cells.
# The cells are &quot;plated&quot; in a tissue culture vessel and allowed to grow.
# The colonies produced are fixed, stained, and counted.

At the conclusion of the experiment, the percentage of cells that survived the treatment is measured. A graphical representation of survival versus drug concentration or dose of ionizing radiation is called a &quot;cell survival curve&quot;.

For Cell-killing Particle assays, the surviving fraction of cells is used to approximate the Poisson Distribution of virus particles amongst cells and therefore determine the number of CKPs encountered by each cell.

Any type of cell could be used in an experiment, but since the goal of these experiments in oncological research is the discovery of more effective cancer treatments, human tumor cells are a typical choice. The cells either come from prepared &quot;cell lines,&quot; which have been well-studied and whose general characteristics are known, or from a biopsy of a tumor in a patient. The cells are put in petri dishes or in plates which contain several circular &quot;wells.&quot; Particular numbers of cells are plated depending on the experiment; for an experiment involving irradiation it is usual to plate larger numbers of cells with increasing dose of radiation. For example, at a dose of 0 or 1 gray of radiation, 500 cells might be plated, but at 4 or 5 gray, 2500 might be plated, since very large numbers of cells are killed at this level of radiation and the effects of the specific treatment would be unobservable.

Counting the cell colonies is usually done under a microscope and is quite tedious. Recently, machines have been developed that use algorithms to analyse images. These are either captured by an image scanner or an automated microscope that can completely automate the counting process. One such automated machine works by accepting certain types of cell plates through a slot (not unlike a CD player), taking a photograph, and uploading it to a computer for immediate analysis. Reliable counts are available in seconds.

==Variables==
The treatment is usually a drug, ionizing radiation, or a combination of the two. Some current research studies the potentiation of drug effects by concurrent irradiation—a synergistic effect—and in this situation two groups are studied: a control group, which is not treated with the drug; and a treatment group, which is treated with the drug. Both groups are irradiated. If the slopes of their survival curves differ significantly, then a potentiating effect may be evident and could be studied further. Since many tumor cells won&#x27;t grow colonies in culture, cell proliferation assay, which has a satisfactory accuracy reportedly in measuring synergistic effects between ionizing radiation and drugs, may be used as a surrogate 

A thorough discussion of the promising research being conducted with the aid of this technique is beyond the scope of this text, but some studies involve the effect of the expression of particular genes or receptors on the cell, the responses of different cell types, or synergistic effects of multiple drugs.

<text>Erythema (, ) is redness of the skin or mucous membranes, caused by hyperemia (increased blood flow) in superficial capillaries. It occurs with any skin injury, infection, or inflammation. Examples of erythema not associated with pathology include nervous blushes.

== Types ==

* Erythema ab igne
* Erythema chronicum migrans
* Erythema induratum
* Erythema infectiosum (or fifth disease)
* Erythema marginatum
* Erythema migrans
* Erythema multiforme (EM)
* Erythema nodosum
* Erythema toxicum
* Erythema elevatum diutinum
* Erythema gyratum repens
* Keratolytic winter erythema
* Palmar erythema
== Causes ==
It can be caused by infection, massage, electrical treatment, acne medication, allergies, exercise, solar radiation (sunburn), photosensitization, acute radiation syndrome, mercury toxicity, blister agents, niacin administration, or waxing and tweezing of the hairs—any of which can cause the affected capillaries to dilate, resulting in redness. Erythema is a common side effect of radiotherapy treatment due to patient exposure to ionizing radiation.

== Diagnosis ==
Erythema disappears on finger pressure (blanching), whereas purpura or bleeding in the skin and pigmentation do not. There is no temperature elevation, unless it is associated with the dilation of arteries in the deeper layer of the skin.

<text>William Joseph Skowron (December 18, 1930 – April 27, 2012), nicknamed &quot;Moose&quot;, was an American professional baseball first baseman. He played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1954 to 1967 for the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers, Washington Senators, Chicago White Sox, and California Angels. He was an eight-time All-Star and a five-time World Series champion. 

Skowron had been a community relations representative for the Chicago White Sox for several years when he died in 2012.

==Early life==
Skowron was born in Chicago, Illinois, and was of Polish descent. His father was a city garbage collector. One day his grandfather gave the seven-year-old Skowron a haircut resembling that of Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini. His friends jokingly calling him &quot;Mussolini&quot;, which his family shortened to &quot;Moose.&quot; The name stuck throughout his career.

Skowron attended Weber High School in Chicago, then went to Purdue University in Indiana, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Though Skowron went to the school on a football scholarship, he found himself better suited to baseball, hitting .500 as a sophomore in 1950, a record in the Big Ten Conference that lasted ten years.

==Professional baseball career==
Following his sophomore year at Purdue, Skowron was signed to play baseball for the Austin (MN) Packers in the Southern Minny League (Class AA-level town-team baseball). He hit .343 for the Packers in 23 games. He also displayed his power with a three home run game against the Rochester Royals. He did so well in Austin that the Yankees made a contract offer.

===Major leagues===
Skowron signed with the New York Yankees in September as an amateur free agent by Yankees scout Lou Maguolo. He played his first game for the Yankees on April 13, . In the beginning, he was platooned at first base with Joe Collins, but from on he became the Yankees&#x27; full-time first baseman. He played in seven American League (AL) All-Star games as a Yankee: , , twice in , twice in , and (two All-Star Games were played in 1959 through 1962).

After batting .270 with 23 home runs and with Joe Pepitone ready to succeed him as the starting first baseman, Skowron was traded from the Yankees to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Stan Williams at the Winter Meetings on November 26, . Although he floundered against National League pitching the next season, batting just .203 in 237 at bats with four homers, he stunned his former team in the 1963 World Series, leading the Dodgers with a .385 average and a home run, as Los Angeles swept New York in four straight games. As a result, Skowron become one of few players in MLB history to have won back-to-back Series championships with different teams.

On December 6, , he returned to the AL when he was purchased from the Dodgers by the Washington Senators. On July 13, , he was traded by the Senators to the Chicago White Sox. In , he played in his eighth All-Star Game. On May 6, , he was traded by the White Sox to the California Angels. He was released by the Angels on October 9, .

He played in a total of 1,478 major-league games, all but 15 as a first baseman. (He was in 13 games as a third baseman, and two as a second baseman.)

Skowron made the last out of the 1957 World Series, but the following year he knocked in the winning run in game six of the 1958 World Series. Skowron also hit a three-run home run in game seven to propel the Yankees to a World Series win, and a comeback from a 3-1 series deficit. He also scored the only run in game seven of the 1962 World Series against the San Francisco Giants, on a double play grounder by Tony Kubek.

In total, Skowron played on eight World Series teams, on the winning side five times: Seven World Series with the Yankees, winning four rings, 1956, 58, 61 and 62; and won with Dodgers in 1963 against the Yankees.

Skowron was a consistently good hitter throughout most of his career, and more than held his own in World Series play, batting .293, with 8 homers, 29 RBIs, and a .519 slugging percentage in eight World Series.

Skowron was once a playful target of his friend, Yankee pitcher Fritz Peterson. A known practical joker, Peterson was reportedly popular with his teammates, entertaining them with his elaborate jokes. He once used a fake Baseball Hall of Fame letterhead to ask Skowron to donate his pacemaker after he died.

==Personal life==
Skowron met and married Virginia Hulquist while he was playing for the Austin, MN Packers. During his time with the Yankees, he resided in Hillsdale, New Jersey. In 1963, he appeared as himself in the &quot;Mister Ed&quot; episode &quot;Leo Durocher Meets Mister Ed&quot;.

He was inducted into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1980 while living in Schaumburg, Illinois. In 1999, he became a community relations representative for the Chicago White Sox, holding the job through his passing in 2012.

Skowron died at age 81 on April 27, 2012, in Arlington Heights, Illinois, of congestive heart failure following a long battle with lung cancer.

<text>Rumelihisarı (also known as Rumelian Fortress and Roumeli Hissar Fortress) or Boğazkesen Fortress (literally &#x27;strait-cutter fortress&#x27;) is a medieval Ottoman fortress located in Istanbul, Turkey, on a series of hills on the European banks of the Bosphorus. The fortress also lends its name to the immediate neighborhood around it in the city&#x27;s Sarıyer district.

Conceived and built between 1451 and 1452 CE on the orders of Sultan Mehmed II, the complex was commissioned in preparation for a planned Ottoman siege on the then-Byzantine city of Constantinople, with the goal of cutting off maritime military and logistical relief that could potentially come to the Byzantines&#x27; aid by way of the Bosphorus Strait, hence the fortress&#x27;s alternative name, &quot;Boğazkesen&quot;, i.e. &quot;Strait-cutter&quot; Castle. Its older sister structure, Anadoluhisari (&quot;Anatolian Fortress&quot;), sits on the opposite banks of the Bosporus, and the two fortresses worked in tandem during the final siege to throttle all naval traffic along the Bosphorus, thus helping the Ottomans achieve their goal of making the city of Constantinople (later renamed Istanbul) their new imperial capital in 1453.

After the Ottoman conquest of the city, Rumelihisarı served as a customs checkpoint and occasional prison, notably for the embassies of states that were at war with the Empire. After suffering extensive damage in the Great Earthquake of 1509, the structure was repaired, and was used continuously until the late 19th century.

Today, the fortress is a popular museum open to the public, and further acts as an open-air venue for seasonal concerts, art festivals, and special events.

==History==
===Construction===
The necessity of a strategic fortress on the Bosphorus was well known to the Ottomans, who had started in the late 14th century to harbor intentions of capturing the city of Constantinople as a new capital for their then-nascent Empire. In a previous Ottoman attempt to conquer the city, Sultan Murad II (1421–44, 1446–51) had encountered difficulties due to a blockade of the Bosphorus by the Byzantine fleet. Having learned the importance of maritime strategy from this earlier attempt, Sultan Mehmed II (1444–46, 1451–81), son of Murad II, started planning a new offensive immediately following his ascent to the throne in 1451.

In response to the coronation of the ambitious young Sultan, Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI (1449–53), in a classic Byzantine diplomatic move threatened the Ottomans with another potential civil war by releasing Orhan (a pretender to the Ottoman throne). 

This move by the Byzantines was seen as pretext for war and thus Mehmed proceeded with the plans of conquering the Constantinopole by first commissioning the construction of a large fortress that would be used to control all sea traffic along the Bosphorus, and would work together with the older Anadoluhisari (Anatolia Fortress) on the strait to prevent any possible maritime aid from reaching Constantinople during the final Ottoman siege of the city in 1453, particularly from Genoese colonies along the Black Sea, such as Caffa, Sinop and Amasra.
The site for the new fortress was quickly decided to be the narrowmost point of the Bosphorus, where the strait is a mere wide. This tall, hilltop site on the strait&#x27;s European banks not only made for easier control of the waterway, but also had the advantage of being situated directly across the Anadoluhisarı (&quot;Anatolian Fortress&quot;) on the Anatolian (i.e. Asian) banks of the Bosphorus; an older Ottoman fortress built between 1393 and 1394 by Sultan Bayezid I. Historically, there had been a Roman fortification at the hilltop where Rumelihisari was to be built, which had later been used as a prison by the Byzantines and Genoese. Later on, a monastery had been built there.

Construction began on April 15, 1452. The structure&#x27;s top-view plans represent the initials of Mehmed and the Muhammad. Each one of the three main towers was named after the royal vizier who supervised its respective construction; Sadrazam Çandarlı Halil Pasha, who built the large tower next to the gate; Zağanos Pasha, who built the south tower; and Sarıca Pasha, who built the north tower. The Sultan himself personally inspected the activities on the site.

===Architecture===
The Rumelihisarı fortification has one small tower, three main towers, and thirteen small watchtowers placed on the walls connecting the main towers. One watchtower is in the form of a quadrangular prism, six watchtowers are shaped as prisms with multiple corners, and six others are cylindrical.

The main tower in the north, Sarıca Pasha Tower, is cylindrical in form, with a diameter of , walls that are thick, and a total of 9 stories reaching a height of . Today, this tower is also known as &quot;Fatih&quot; (&quot;Conqueror&quot;) &quot;Tower&quot; after Sultan Mehmed II&#x27;s cognomen. The large tower at the waterfront in the middle of the fortress, Halil Pasha Tower, is a dodecagonal prism, and also has 9 stories. It is high with a diameter, and walls measuring thick. The main tower in the south, Zağanos Pasha Tower, has only 8 stories. This cylindrical tower is high, and has a diameter with thick walls. The space within each tower was divided up with wooden floors, each equipped with a furnace. Conical wooden roofs covered with lead originally crowned the towers, although these no longer survive today.
The outer curtain walls of the fortress are long from north to south, and vary between long from east to west. The complex&#x27;s total area is .

The fortress had three main gates next to the main towers, one side gate and two secret gates for the arsenal and food cellars next to the southern tower. There were wooden houses for the soldiers and a small mosque, endowed by the Sultan at the time of construction. Only the minaret shaft remains of the original mosque, while the small masjid added in the mid-16th century has not survived. A new mosque has since been built in the grounds. Water was supplied to the fortress from a large cistern underneath the mosque and distributed through three wall-fountains, of which only one remains. Two inscriptive plaques are found attached to the walls.

The fortress was initially called &quot;Boğazkesen&quot;, literally meaning &quot;Strait Cutter&quot;, referring to the Bosporus Strait. The name carries a secondary and more macabre meaning; as &quot;boğaz&quot; not only means &quot;strait&quot; but also &quot;throat&quot; in Turkish.

It was later renamed as Rumelihisarı, which means &quot;Fortress on the Land of the Romans&quot;, i.e. Byzantine Europe, or the Balkan peninsula.

===Usage in the past===

A battalion of 400 Janissaries was stationed in the fortress, and large cannons were placed in the Halil Pasha Tower, the main tower on the waterfront. Having completed his fortresses, Mehmed proceeded to levy a toll on ships passing within reach of their cannon. A Venetian vessel ignoring signals to stop was sunk with a single shot and all the surviving sailors beheaded, except for the captain, who was impaled and mounted as a human scarecrow as a warning to further sailors on the strait. These cannons were later used until the second half of the 19th century to greet the sultan when he passed by sea.

After the conquest of Constantinople, the fortress served as a customs checkpoint. Rumelihisarı, designated to control the passage of ships through the strait, eventually lost its strategic importance when a second pair of fortresses was built farther up the Bosphorus, where the strait meets the Black Sea. In the 17th century, it was used as a prison, primarily for foreign prisoners of war. Rumelihisarı was partly destroyed by an earthquake in 1509 but was repaired soon after. In 1746, a fire destroyed all the wooden parts in two of the main towers. The fortress was repaired by Sultan Selim III (1761–1807). However, a new residential neighborhood was formed inside the fortress after it was abandoned in the 19th century.

===Modern history===

In 1953, on the orders of President Celal Bayar, the inhabitants were relocated and extensive restoration work began on 16 May 1955, which lasted until 29 May 1958. Since 1960 Rumelihisarı has been a museum.

The Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge, named after the Ottoman Sultan that commissioned Rumelihisarı and conquered the city, is located close to the fortress, to the north.

Rumelihisarı is open to public every day except Mondays from 9:00 to 16:30.

The fortress was depicted on various Turkish banknotes during 1939–1986.

<doc id="532872" wikidata="Q4980575" url="?curid=532872" title="Bryant Gumbel">
<text>Bryant Charles Gumbel (born September 29, 1948) is an American television journalist and sportscaster. He was best known for his 15 years as co-host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;. His older brother was sportscaster Greg Gumbel. From 1995 to 2023, he hosted HBO&#x27;s acclaimed investigative series &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot;, which has been rated as &quot;flat out TV&#x27;s best sports program&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. It won a Peabody Award in 2012.

Gumbel was hired by NBC Sports in the fall of 1975 as co-host of its National Football League pre-game show &quot;GrandStand&quot; with Jack Buck. From 1975 until January 1982 (when he left to do &quot;The Today Show&quot;), he hosted numerous sporting events for NBC including Major League Baseball, college basketball and the National Football League. He returned to sportscasting for NBC when he hosted the prime time coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul and the PGA Tour in 1990.

NBC News made Gumbel the principal anchor of &quot;Today&quot; beginning September 27, 1982, and broadcast from Vietnam, Vatican City, Europe, South America, and much of the United States between 1984 and 1989. Gumbel&#x27;s work on &quot;Today&quot; earned him several Emmys and a large fanbase. He is the third longest serving co-host of &quot;Today&quot;, after former hosts Matt Lauer and Katie Couric. He left the show on January 3, 1997, after 15 years.

Gumbel moved to CBS, where he hosted various shows before becoming co-host of the network&#x27;s morning show &quot;The Early Show&quot; on November 1, 1999. Gumbel was hosting &quot;The Early Show&quot; on the morning of September 11, 2001. He was the first to announce the September 11 attacks to CBS viewers. Gumbel left CBS and &quot;The Early Show&quot; on May 17, 2002.

==Early life and education==
Gumbel was born in New Orleans. He is the son of Rhea Alice (née LeCesne), a city clerk, and Richard Dunbar Gumbel, a judge. Gumbel&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandfather was a German-Jewish emigrant from the village of Albisheim. Raised Catholic, he attended and graduated from De La Salle Institute in Chicago, while growing up on the South Side of the city; his family had moved north when he was a child. He graduated from Bates College in 1970 with a degree in Russian history. He was one of four siblings, including two sisters and an older brother, Greg Gumbel, who also became a nationally recognized sports broadcaster.

== Career ==
In 1971, he became editor of &quot;Black Sports&quot;, leaving the following year. He began his television career in October 1972, when he was made a sportscaster for KNBC-TV in Los Angeles.

=== NBC ===
==== NBC Sports ====
Already a local evening news sports anchor for KNBC (a Los Angeles television station owned and operated by NBC), Gumbel began appearing on NBC Sports telecasts in the fall of 1975, as co-host of its National Football League pre-game show &quot;GrandStand&quot; with Jack Buck. From 1975 until January 1982 (when he left to do &quot;The Today Show&quot;), he hosted numerous sporting events for NBC including Major League Baseball, college basketball and the National Football League. He returned to sportscasting for NBC when he hosted the prime time coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul and the PGA Tour in 1990.

One of Gumbel&#x27;s more memorable moments during his time at NBC Sports occurred when he was on-site for the &quot;Epic in Miami&quot; NFL playoff game between the San Diego Chargers and Miami Dolphins. At the end of the game, he told the viewers, &quot;If you didn&#x27;t like this football game then you don&#x27;t like football!&quot; This would be one of his final assignments for NBC Sports, as he began co-hosting &quot;Today&quot; two days later.

==== &quot;Today&quot; ====
Gumbel began his affiliation with &quot;Today&quot; as the program&#x27;s chief sports reporter contributing twice-weekly features to the program, including a regular series entitled &quot;Sportsman of the Week,&quot; featuring up-and-coming athletes. In June 1981, NBC announced that Tom Brokaw would depart &quot;Today&quot; to anchor the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; with Roger Mudd beginning in the spring of 1982. The search for Brokaw&#x27;s replacement was on, and the initial candidates were all NBC News correspondents, including John Palmer, Chris Wallace, Bob Kur, Bob Jamieson, and Jessica Savitch. The candidates auditioned for Brokaw&#x27;s job throughout the summer of 1981 when he was on vacation. Gumbel became a candidate for the job just by chance when he served as a last-minute substitute for &quot;Today&quot; co-anchor Jane Pauley in August 1981. He so impressed executive producer Steve Friedman and other NBC executives that he quickly became a top contender for the &quot;Today&quot; anchor position. 
While Friedman and other NBC executives favored Gumbel as Brokaw&#x27;s replacement, another contingent within the NBC News division felt strongly that he should be replaced by a fellow news correspondent, not a sports reporter. Wallace was the favored candidate of then-NBC News president Bill Small. NBC News decided to split the difference, selecting Gumbel as the program&#x27;s anchor and Wallace as the Washington-based anchor. Pauley would remain co-anchor in New York. Brokaw signed off of &quot;Today&quot; on December 18, 1981, and Gumbel replaced him on January 4, 1982. Gumbel and Brokaw had previously worked together on KNBC&#x27;s 6:00 p.m. newscast in the mid-1970s, with Brokaw as anchor and Gumbel on sports.

The Gumbel–Pauley–Wallace arrangement, known internally as the &quot;Mod Squad&quot;, lasted only nine months. It was an arrangement that proved intriguing on paper but unwieldy on television. Gumbel served as the show&#x27;s traffic cop, opening and closing the program and conducting New York–based interviews, but Pauley and Wallace handled newsreading duties, and Wallace conducted all Washington-based hard news interviews. With ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in first place and expanding its lead, NBC News made Gumbel the principal anchor of &quot;Today&quot; beginning September 27, 1982, with Pauley as his co-anchor. Wallace became the chief White House correspondent covering President Ronald Reagan, and John Palmer, previously a White House correspondent, became &quot;Today&quot;&#x27;s New York–based news anchor.

Gumbel and Pauley had a challenging first two years together as &quot;Today&quot; anchors as they sought to find a rhythm as a team. &quot;Good Morning America&quot; solidified its lead over &quot;Today&quot; in the ratings during the summer of 1983, and Pauley&#x27;s departure for maternity leave sent &quot;Today&quot; into a ratings tailspin. But when she returned in February 1984, they began to work well together as a team. NBC took &quot;Today&quot; on the road in the fall of &#x27;84, sending Gumbel to the Soviet Union for an unprecedented series of live broadcasts from Moscow. He won plaudits for his performance, erasing any doubts about his hard-news capabilities. That trip began a whirlwind period of travel for &quot;Today&quot;. Remote broadcasts from Vietnam, Vatican City, Europe, South America, and much of the United States followed between 1984 and 1989. &quot;Today&quot; began to regain its old ratings dominance against &quot;Good Morning America&quot; throughout 1985, and by early 1986, the NBC program was once again atop the ratings.

During this time, Gumbel had developed animosity toward David Letterman when the &quot;Late Night&quot; host disrupted taping of a &quot;Today&quot; primetime special in Rockefeller Center with a bullhorn. &quot;If I had gotten to him, I would have hit him,&quot; Gumbel said of Letterman. The pair would reconcile a few years later.

In 1989, Gumbel, who was already known for his strong management style as &quot;Today&quot; anchor, wrote a memo to the executive producer Marty Ryan, on Ryan&#x27;s request, critiquing the program and identifying its shortcomings. Many of his criticisms were directed at fellow &quot;Today&quot; staffers. It was leaked to the press. In the memo, Gumbel commented that Willard Scott &quot;holds the show hostage to his assortment of whims, wishes, birthdays and bad taste ... this guy is killing us and no one&#x27;s even trying to rein him in&quot;. He commented that Gene Shalit&#x27;s movie reviews &quot;are often late and his interviews aren&#x27;t very good.&quot;

There was enough negative backlash in regard to Gumbel&#x27;s comments toward Scott that he was shown making up with Scott on &quot;Today&quot;.

Following Pauley&#x27;s departure from &quot;Today&quot; in December 1989, Gumbel was joined by Deborah Norville in a short-lived partnership that lasted just over a year. &quot;Today&quot; dropped to second place in the ratings during this period as a result of intensely negative publicity surrounding Norville&#x27;s replacement of Pauley, and Gumbel&#x27;s feud with Scott. Norville was replaced by Katie Couric in April 1991, and the Gumbel-Couric team helped refocus &quot;Today&quot; as the morning news program on public affairs during the 1992 presidential campaign. The program returned to first place in the ratings in December 1995.

Gumbel&#x27;s work on &quot;Today&quot; earned him several Emmys and a large group of fans. He is the third longest serving co-host of &quot;Today&quot;, after Matt Lauer and Couric. He stepped down from the show on January 3, 1997, after 15 years.

Since his departure, Gumbel has made occasional appearances on &quot;Today&quot;. He appeared for the show&#x27;s 60th anniversary and hosted with Lauer and Pauley on December 30, 2013.

=== CBS ===
==== &quot;Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel&quot; ====
After 15 years on &quot;Today&quot;, Gumbel moved to CBS to host a new prime time news-magazine called &quot;Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel&quot; during the 1997–1998 television season. The episode &quot;The Reckoning&quot; won a Peabody Award in 1998. It lasted just one season before being cancelled. It aired on Wednesday nights at 9pm ET before moving to Tuesdays at 9pm ET.

==== &quot;The Early Show&quot; ====
After the cancellation of &quot;Public Eye&quot;, Gumbel hosted various other CBS shows before becoming co-host of the network&#x27;s morning show &quot;The Early Show&quot; on November 1, 1999. Gumbel left &quot;The Early Show&quot; (and CBS that same year) on May 17, 2002. Gumbel was hosting &quot;The Early Show&quot; on the morning of September 11, 2001. He was the first to announce the September 11 attacks to CBS viewers.

In the spring and summer of 2010, he served as a special guest moderator of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The View&quot; for multiple days.

==== Boy Scouts incident ====
A CBS camera caught a disgusted Gumbel blurting out, &quot;What a fucking idiot,&quot; just after he had finished a hostile interview with Robert Knight of the Family Research Council (FRC). The incident occurred at about 7:15 a.m. ET on Thursday, June 29, 2000, following Knight&#x27;s appearance to defend the Boy Scout policy of excluding gays from being leaders. The Media Research Center reported that he uttered those words; Gumbel openly admitted to saying so when guest-hosting a June 2007 episode of &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;.

=== &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot; ===
Gumbel has concentrated most of his energy recently on his duties as host of HBO&#x27;s acclaimed investigative series &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot; (a show that he has hosted since 1995). HBO&#x27;s web page claims that &quot;Real Sports&quot; has been described as &quot;flat out—TV&#x27;s best sports program&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. It won a Peabody Award in 2012.

==== Notable remarks ====
In February 2006, Gumbel made remarks seen as controversial regarding the Winter Olympics and the lack of Black athlete participation, while others considered it important sports journalism commentary.

On the August 15, 2006, episode of &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot;, Gumbel made the following remarks about former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue and Players&#x27; Union president Gene Upshaw and directed these comments to new commissioner Roger Goodell:

In response, Tagliabue said:

On the October 18, 2011, Gumbel evoked slavery in his criticism of NBA Commissioner David Stern over the league&#x27;s lockout.

In a Rolling Stone article dated January 20, 2015, Gumbel said: &quot;There are a few things I hate more than the NRA. I mean truly. I think they&#x27;re pigs. I think they don&#x27;t care about human life. I think they are a curse upon the American landscape. So we got that on the record.&quot;

=== &quot;The Weather Man&quot; ===
Gumbel made a cameo appearance alongside Nicolas Cage and Michael Caine in &quot;The Weather Man&quot;, a film directed by Gore Verbinski. In it, he cohosts a morning show entitled &quot;Hello America,&quot; for which Cage&#x27;s character, a depressed weatherman, auditions.

=== &quot;Seinfeld&quot; ===
Gumbel made a cameo appearance on the NBC sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; during which he interviewed Jerry Seinfeld on &quot;Today&quot; while Jerry was wearing the puffy pirate shirt in the episode &quot;The Puffy Shirt&quot;.

=== &quot;The Nanny&quot; ===
Gumbel made a cameo appearance on the sitcom &quot;The Nanny&quot; during which he gives Fran Fine an audition for a job in television in the episode &quot;Fair Weather Fran&quot;.

=== NFL Network ===

In April 2006, NFL Network announced that Gumbel, along with Cris Collinsworth and Dick Vermeil, would comment on its new package of NFL games. Unlike his brother Greg, he had never called play-by-play for live sporting events in his career. Before his first game commentary for the network, his status was brought into question after he stirred up controversy in his closing remarks on his HBO program on August 15, 2006, in which he criticized NFL Players Association head Gene Upshaw and outgoing NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. He would later reconcile with the NFL and retained his play-by-play job with the NFL Network. On December 29, 2007, he had a reunion of sorts as he called the Patriots-Giants game on the NFL Network, CBS, and NBC. This is the first three-network simulcast NFL game and, coincidentally, he has worked for all three networks during his career. He also had a strong affiliation with NFL Films.

Gumbel&#x27;s performance was the subject of criticism over his entire run because of his voice and a perceived lack of knowledge about the game. Gumbel stepped down as play-by-play announcer in April 2008, prior to the 2008 NFL season. He would be replaced on the NFL Network telecasts by Bob Papa, then the radio play-by-play announcer for the New York Giants.

=== &quot;Brain Surgery Live&quot; ===
In 2015, Gumbel hosted the first ever live televised brain surgery during a two-hour National Geographic special. The two-hour event, titled &quot;Brain Surgery Live with Mental Floss&quot;, gave viewers an up-close look at an awake deep brain stimulation surgery. Filming took place via two handheld cameras as well as several robotic cameras with inputs directly in the doctors&#x27; surgical equipment, allowing viewers to see live images as the brain was being operated on in real time.

==Personal life==
Gumbel raised two children with his wife, June, in Waccabuc, north of New York City. In 2001, he divorced her to marry Hilary Quinlan. Around 2002, he shed 55 pounds of weight in seven months. In October 2009, he had surgery to remove a malignant tumor near one of his lungs.

<doc id="532878" wikidata="Q4932103" url="?curid=532878" title="Bob Cole (composer)">
<text>Robert Allen Cole Jr. (July 1, 1868 – August 2, 1911) was an American composer, actor, and playwright who produced and directed stage shows. In collaboration with Billy Johnson, he wrote and produced &quot;A Trip to Coontown&quot; (1898), the first musical entirely created and owned by black showmen. The popular song &quot;La Hoola Boola&quot; (1898) was a result of their collaboration. Cole later partnered with brothers J. Rosamond Johnson, a pianist and singer, and James Weldon Johnson, a pianist, guitarist and lawyer, creating more than 200 songs.

Their vaudeville act featured classical piano pieces and their musicals featured sophisticated lyrics without the usual stereotypes such as &quot;hot-mamas&quot; and watermelons. Success enabled Cole and Rosamond to tour America and Europe with their act. The trio&#x27;s most popular songs were &quot;Louisiana Lize&quot; and &quot;Under the Bamboo Tree&quot; (1901?). Their more successful musicals were &quot;The Shoo-Fly Regiment&quot; (1906) and &quot;The Red Moon&quot; (1908, written without Weldon).

Cole was the preeminent leader in the world of black musical theater both as a composer and as a performer. His skills in acting, writing, and directing were brought to the public eye through his early works: first, he produced the black musical “A Trip to Coontown”, where he joined alliance with Billy Johnson, followed by the production of popular songs such as “ Under the Bamboo Tree,” where he worked with J. Rosamond Johnson. Cole committed suicide by drowning himself in a creek in the Catskills in 1911 after a nervous breakdown and period of clinical depression that worsened in 1910.

==Family and early life==

As stated in Thomas L. Riis’ “‘Bob’ Cole: His Life and His Legacy to Black Musical Theater,” few details of Cole&#x27;s life before the transition into the development of black musicals can be found in research materials, including encyclopedias and historical articles on black theater.

The composer was born in Athens, Georgia, where his father (Robert Allen Cole, Sr.) and mother (Isabella Thomas Weldon) settled after the freedom of blacks through the Emancipation Proclamation. Although Athens, Georgia, was shattered by the war in the South and the racist environment of Southern society at the time, it became a prosperous city with prominent African American families; barbers, blacksmiths, shoemakers, and other sorts of community professionals were black. The people of Athens developed one of the earliest black newspapers, indicating the advancement and progression in education of blacks in the late 19th century. Cole&#x27;s father took advantage of the opportunities provided in Athens, Georgia, and became well known through his political activism during the Reconstruction era of the South. Robert Cole&#x27;s political role may have influenced his son&#x27;s beliefs, especially in regards to the conditions of the African American race. During his involvement in politics, from 1867 to 1873, Robert Cole became a part of the black Athenians and assisted the Georgia State Legislature. In the end, Bob Cole&#x27;s father, with his political side in the background, became a carpenter, supporting his family and his house on Broad Street.

===Childhood years and adulthood===
Bob Cole, born on July 1, 1868, was the first-born of his family, followed by five other siblings, including Dora Cole Norman. His family was musical; both his parents were square dancers (Robert Cole, Sr., also played drums) and all the children of the household were educated in certain musical instruments. Bob played various instruments, such as the banjo, piano and cello, and created his own family band with the support of his sisters. At fifteen years of age, Bob had a violent confrontation with the son of the mayor of Athens, and had to flee the town to live with distant relatives, of his mother&#x27;s side, in Florida. A short time later, Bob was reunited with his family after they moved to Atlanta, Georgia. In Atlanta, Bob was able to attend elementary school and possibly high school; however, he did not proceed towards higher education. Instead of enrolling in a college, Bob found a job at the Atlanta University, which became his approximation of the student experience – from the interview from his sister, he was able to gain a vast amount of knowledge due to his knowledge-packed environment.

==Early short-term careers in music==
Still focused on the music world and following his musical inclinations, Cole moved to Florida, where he was able to be involved in a small string quartet for a short period of time. Later, he worked at a resort in Asbury Park, New Jersey, as a “singing bellboy”. He later moved to Chicago where he became a comedian of a sort – he told jokes, sung, and played the guitar in various clubs throughout the city. His interest towards vaudeville plays and the later black musical genre (including “coon songs”) originated from his work with his peer Lew Henry, who was also an amateur showman. These two young actors attempted to create a vaudeville act together; however, the act was not a success and soon ended. After his failed attempt in the field of vaudeville acting, Cole traveled to New York, preeminent area for novice actors in pursuit of theater or anything related to the theatrical genres, and formed an alliance with Pete Staples, who was well known in his performance as a mandolinist. Cole became Staples’ comedic counterpart in their act together, but their collaboration ended shortly after it began. Due to the lack of information on the details of Bob Cole&#x27;s experience in acting and music, including his early training, there were no solid facts of how Cole came to be the leading black composer and entrepreneur in black musicals. Although Cole seemed to be focused on the comedic and buffoonish aspect of African-American theater and acting, he did not submit to the norm of being involved in so-called “medicine shows” or the circus, unlike his predecessors. Rather than being confined to the traditional use of blackface makeup of early black minstrel shows, he denied the degrading use of such material and deviated from the conventional African American entertainment; thus, he began producing his own entertainment through either a partnership or just being solo.

==Gradual rise to stardom - &quot;The Creole Show&quot;==

Coming from a small black family and gradually gaining popularity in the public eye, Cole began rising in the field of black musicals. A few years after, around the early 1890s, with the support of the Chicago firm of Will Rossitier, Bob Cole presented his two legally published songs: “Parthenia Took a Likin’ to a Coon” and “In Shin Bone Alley.” The titles give the general idea and tone of the songs – Cole incorporated his comedic nature and produced a minstrel-like tone to his songs. His rising soon allowed further opportunities to flow in; for instance, he was soon hired as a comedian by the white entrepreneur, Sam T. Jack, who created the &quot;Creole Show&quot;. The &quot;Creole Show&quot;, in short, focused on black women performers, which was extremely rare during the time; furthermore, in its movement towards breaking the norm, the show shattered the use of black stereotypes in typical minstrel shows, which included denying the usual plot setting at a slave plantation. By moving away from traditional minstrel shows, Sam T. Jack&#x27;s production was predominantly influenced by the styles of vaudeville (with more focus on the beauty and exotic aspects of showgirls), reviving the cakewalk and adding fancy steps. Cole&#x27;s role in the &quot;Creole Show&quot; soon gained popularity and he went from an ordinary comedian act to the headliner of the show. His success in the &quot;Creole Show&quot;, indicated by his popularity amongst his audience that resulted in a promotion, led him to create his own stage character, which he would carry on for another seven years: Willy Wayside, the red-whiskered hobo.

By 1896, as his fame progressed, Cole produced four “Genuine Negro songs by a Genuine Negro Minstrel” that were published by Brooks and Denton of New York and London. These four songs were: “Fly, fly, fly,” “Move up, Johnson,” “Colored aristocracy,” and “Dem golden clouds.” Cole&#x27;s popularity and stardom began to accelerate through his involvement in top productions, such as “Black America.” Soon, he was promoted and became a writer and stage manager for the Creole Show. By the early 1890s, he was partnered professionally with his future wife, Stella Wiley, a dancer from the &quot;Creole Show&quot;. His partnership led him to performances from New England to New York. Around 1894, he formed the All-Star Stock Company – a project that allowed him to train a professional group of actors, comedians and singers. The first production by this group was called Georgia 49, which included John Isham. There was no description or synopsis of the actual show for future reference.

==Black Patti&#x27;s Troubadours: from fame to unemployment==
Later, Cole became an important player in the first shows by Black Patti’s Troubadours in 1896. Black Patti Troubadours was an American vaudeville group founded by Sissieretta Jones’ (“The Black Patti”); their performances consisted of blackface minstrel songs and “coon songs,” also featuring acrobats and comedians. Cole&#x27;s association with this group allowed him to become involved with the Isham shows through the two groups&#x27; coalition – the partnered shows predominantly consisted of comedy sketches, vaudeville specialty acts (i.e. jugglers, singers, and comedians), and ending with a variety of opera-like singers. 

Cole also managed his own Troubadour show in which he starred as Willy Wayside (in this case, his character was the tramp) in the musical &quot;At Jolly Coon-ey Island&quot; and performed a routine with Stella Wiley. The musical incorporated two of his own songs: &quot;4-11-44&quot; and &quot;The Four Hundred&#x27;s Ball&quot;, and music arrangements by its music director J. A. Raynes. Although Cole became the top performer amongst his peers, his significant contributions to the Troubadours did not result in higher pay, and he left the company, taking away his own written scripts and songs. Denounced as a thief and troublemaker by the company&#x27;s white managers, Voelckel and Nolan, his reputation was damaged, and no production manager would hire him. Cole was forced to publish songs under a pseudonym – he used the name Will Handy for his later works after his own name was tainted.

==&quot;A Trip to Coontown&quot;==
Cole soon established his own black production company with the group of individuals who also left the Troubadours. Out of that, he, with Billy Johnson and Will Accooe, in 1898, co-wrote the lyrics and music for &quot;A Trip to Coontown,&quot; which, was the lengthier version of the musical programs he previously written. The production became the supposed first black musical comedy. The musical, consisting of only black actors and revolving around the traditional minstrel stereotypes, delved into the story of a con artist, Jimmy Flimflammer, and his failed attempts to rob an elderly man of his pension. Furthermore, in order to maintain the interest of the audience, the play also included variety, or comedic, acts to liven the show.

Individuals can argue, as stated in Eileen Southern&#x27;s &quot;The Origin and Development of the Black Musical Theater: A Preliminary Report&quot;, that &quot;A Trip to Coontown&quot; was not the first black-dominated musical play produced at the time. Because black musicals were originated from several genres of stage entertainment – the ballad opera, the music extravaganza, the comic opera, the minstrel show, and the variety show – there is a plausible argument that previous nineteenth-century black companies created such theatrical plays, and &quot;A Trip to Coontown&quot; was not the first black musical performed.

The show premiered in South Amboy, New Jersey, on September 27, 1897. The show went through a trial of shut-downs and controversy, where it was banned from showing in the United States; however, the play later gained popularity in Canadian theaters, and subsequently was revived and shown in New York. Theater-promoters Klaw and Erlanger terminated Cole&#x27;s ban from the theater world and helped bring the show to the public. However, although Cole&#x27;s previous scorned image was extinguished with the help of Klaw and Erlanger, Black Patti&#x27;s Troubadours still attempted to ruin his career by directly competing with his own production company. The Troubadours planned their shows to be consistent with Cole&#x27;s presentation of &quot;A Trip to Coontown&quot;, attempting to steal the spotlight. However, there were few evidence that proved that Cole and Johnson discovered the unscrupulous ruse of their competitors and avoided the confrontation altogether by destroying their booking contract with Michael Levitt. Although Cole was able to avoid the Troubadours’ schemes, in the end, he was not able to avoid the lawsuit against his company from Levitt, who fined Cole and Johnson $1000. Cole&#x27;s company faced several trials, including quarrels over finances and transportation; also, the competition of the Black Patti organization was a constant battle. Cole&#x27;s group succeeded through Bob Cole&#x27;s skills in management and his inventiveness in black show business. By 1900, &quot;A Trip to Coontown&quot; finally stopped its production, and the partnership between Cole and Billy Johnson ended due to either Johnson&#x27;s alcoholic nature, or Cole&#x27;s changing ideals in black musicals – he desired to test out another path in vaudeville plays and songwriting

==Union with the Johnson Brothers: a turn in Black entertainment==
In 1899, Cole met two brothers from Jacksonville, Florida. who paved the path of the rest of his career in show business: his partnership with James Weldon and J. Rosamond Johnson, especially J. R. Johnson, lasted until his retirement in 1911. As Thomas L. Riis claimed, Cole&#x27;s “association with the Johnson brothers indicated that Cole was turning away from coon-song composition” (140). There was little evidence as to the reason behind Cole&#x27;s drastic shift from traditional “coon songs”; one possible reason was that Cole wanted to draw the elite audience into his plays. He averted from his normal Willy Wayward persona and adopted a more dignified and respectable character. It is possible that his transition was influenced by his partners, who both held college degrees, and his own political notions at the time. As a result, the cooperation of the two (Cole and Johnson) led to the creation of high-class vaudeville acts that incorporated elegance and sophistication, all of which were executed in evening dresses.

One can perceive that Cole was engaged in the political and societal issues of the time, indicated by his image-altering transition into creating shows for the elite. Furthermore, his interest in black politics was revealed from his scrapbook, which was not bursting with newspaper clippings of his own success in black show business, but rather, it consisted mainly of clippings from the Waller Affair. The Waller Affair involved the imprisonment of John L. Waller as a consequence of political confrontations between Madagascar and France, in which French imperialists who claimed to protect Madagascar did not support black developers. The French court-martial accused Waller of leaking information to the enemy (Madagascar) during the war, and sentenced Waller to twenty years imprisonment. Cole identified with Waller; they were both activists who protested against African-American inequities and believed in aiding their own kin. Although exteriorly, Cole appeared to be a carefree showman whose only purpose was to be famous in black minstrelsy and vaudeville plays, he organized his shows very meticulously and placed much thought in every detail and aspect of his productions. For example, he considered the exact timing of his songs, including the right execution of each part of the performance.

Several of the songs composed by the adjoining Cole-Johnson team were incorporated into larger shows by Klaw and Erlanger. Klaw and Erlanger&#x27;s shows appealed the white audiences, allowing the black composers’ songs to be known throughout the white community. Furthermore, focusing on the sophistication of the songs in comparison to earlier works, the lyrics avoided the stereotypical descriptions of the aggressive black man; instead, the lyrics provided a sentimental, romantic, and even melancholic atmosphere. Also, deviating from the traditional “coon songs,” the humor in Cole and Johnson&#x27;s works were more humane – they did not include the usual racial commentaries and African-American stereotyping. In general, their shows were more sophisticated and focused primarily on grasping the interests of the elite class. The success of their songs originated from the talents of both respective partners: Rosamond Johnson bore the advanced musical training and keyboard skills, whereas Cole bore the innovative talents in writing new pieces. It could be said that their partnership altered the path of black entertainment and subsequently moved the audience&#x27;s interests towards a more refined type of black music. Not only did Cole and Johnson change the audience&#x27;s taste in black music, they also attempted to educate the public through their songs and tried to prevent the regression towards the degrading “coon songs.”

==View on 20th-century Black entertainment and contributions==
By 1902, Cole gained ultimate financial success, and wrote the article &quot;The Negro and the Stage&quot; for &quot;The Colored American Magazine&quot;. In it, he revealed his concerns toward the crippling image placed on African-American performers; for instance, he criticized the use of the African-American villains in black entertainment, for it demeaned African Americans and fueled the racist stereotype of the violent black man. He also denounced adaptations of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; that used African-American stereotypes.

Although he criticized the conventional use of the aggressive black man in most black entertainment of the day, arguing that it enforced a disreputable image on the black actors themselves, he ended the article by envisioning a bright future for black performers, where stereotyping and racism would be nullified, and African Americans would revolutionize the entertainment world.

Cole was a revolutionary figure who contributed to the movement in eliminating the degrading, social characterizations of the black performer, thus, forcing the path of black entertainment towards a more respectable and dignified future.

<doc id="532892" wikidata="Q436676" url="?curid=532892" title="Edward of Middleham, Prince of Wales">
<text>Edward of Middleham, Prince of Wales ( or 1476 9 April 1484), was the son and heir apparent of King Richard III of England by his wife Anne Neville. He was Richard&#x27;s only legitimate child and died aged seven or ten.

==Birth and titles==
Edward was born at Middleham Castle, a stronghold close to York that became Richard and Anne&#x27;s principal base in northern England. His birth date is usually given as around December 1473, but he may have been born as late as 1476. Professor Charles Ross wrote that the date 1473 &quot;lacks authority. In fact, he was probably not born until 1476.&quot; The act of Parliament that settled the dispute between George of Clarence and Richard over Anne Beauchamp&#x27;s inheritance just as if the Countess of Warwick &quot;was naturally dead&quot; was dated May 1474. The doubts cast by Clarence on the validity of Richard and Anne&#x27;s marriage were addressed by a clause protecting their rights in the event they were divorced (i.e. of their marriage being declared null and void by the Church) and then legally remarried to each other, and also protected Richard&#x27;s rights while waiting for such a valid second marriage with Anne. There were no provisions, however, for their heirs in case of this said divorce, which seems to confirm Richard and Anne had no children as of 1474. However, such provision was the province of the ruling king for those of royal blood, so would have been moot.

Edward was mostly kept at Middleham, and was known to be a sickly child.

In 1478, Edward was granted the title of Earl of Salisbury, previously held by the attainted George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. The title became extinct on his death. His father became King of England on 26 June 1483, deposing Edward&#x27;s cousin Edward V. Edward did not attend his parents&#x27; coronation, probably due to illness. He was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in a splendid ceremony in York Minster on 8 September 1483, following his parents&#x27; royal progress across England.

==Death==
Edward died on 9 April 1484, the anniversary of the death of his uncle, Edward IV. The reasons for his sudden death are unknown. The &quot;Croyland Chronicle&quot; reads:

Edward&#x27;s sudden death left Richard without a legitimate child. Contemporary historian John Rous recorded that Richard declared his nephew Edward, Earl of Warwick, his heir-presumptive, but there is no other evidence of this, and seems unlikely as Richard&#x27;s own claim was based on the attainting of Warwick&#x27;s father. Similarly, John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln also seemed to have been designated as Richard&#x27;s heir-presumptive, but was never publicly proclaimed as such.

Richard&#x27;s enemies were inclined to believe that Edward&#x27;s sudden death was divine retribution for Richard&#x27;s alleged involvement in the usurpation and subsequent disappearance of the sons of Edward IV, his nephews Edward V of England and Richard, Duke of York. It may have also emboldened them to renew hostilities.

==Burial==
The location of Edward&#x27;s burial is unknown. A mutilated white alabaster cenotaph (&quot;empty tomb&quot;) in the Church of St Helen and the Holy Cross at Sheriff Hutton, with an effigy of a child, was long believed to represent Edward of Middleham, but is now thought to be an earlier work depicting one of the Neville family.

<text>Kademlia is a distributed hash table for decentralized peer-to-peer computer networks designed by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazières in 2002. It specifies the structure of the network and the exchange of information through node lookups. Kademlia nodes communicate among themselves using UDP. A virtual or overlay network is formed by the participant nodes. Each node is identified by a number or &quot;node ID&quot;. The &quot;node ID&quot; serves not only as identification, but the Kademlia algorithm uses the &quot;node ID&quot; to locate values (usually file hashes or keywords).

In order to look up the value associated with a given key, the algorithm explores the network in several steps. Each step will find nodes that are closer to the key until the contacted node returns the value or no more closer nodes are found. This is very efficient: like many other s, Kademlia contacts only formula_1 nodes during the search out of a total of formula_2 nodes in the system.

Further advantages are found particularly in the decentralized structure, which increases the resistance against a denial-of-service attack. Even if a whole set of nodes is flooded, this will have limited effect on network availability, since the network will recover itself by knitting the network around these &quot;holes&quot;.

I2P&#x27;s implementation of Kademlia is modified to mitigate Kademlia&#x27;s vulnerabilities, such as Sybil attacks.

== System details ==
Peer-to-peer networks are made of nodes, by design. The protocols that these nodes use to communicate, and locate information, have become more efficient over time. The first generation peer-to-peer file sharing networks, such as Napster, relied on a central database to co-ordinate lookups on the network. Second generation peer-to-peer networks, such as Gnutella, used flooding to locate files, searching every node on the network. Third generation peer-to-peer networks, such as Bittorrent, use distributed hash tables to look up files in the network. &quot;Distributed hash tables&quot; store resource locations throughout the network.

Kademlia uses a &quot;distance&quot; calculation between two nodes. This distance is computed as the &quot;exclusive or (XOR)&quot; of the two node IDs, taking the result as an unsigned integer number. Keys and node IDs have the same format and length, so distance can be calculated among them in exactly the same way. The node ID is typically a large random number that is chosen with the goal of being unique for a particular node (see UUID). It can and does happen that geographically far nodes – from Germany and Australia, for instance – can be &quot;neighbors&quot; if they have chosen similar random node IDs.

&quot;XOR&quot; was chosen because it acts as a distance function between all the node IDs. Specifically:
* the distance between a node and itself is zero
* it is symmetric: the &quot;distances&quot; calculated from A to B and from B to A are the same
* it follows the triangle inequality: given A, B and C are vertices (points) of a triangle, then the distance from A to B is shorter than (or equal to) the sum of both the distance from A to C and the distance from C to B.

These three conditions are enough to ensure that &quot;XOR&quot; captures all of the essential, important features of a &quot;real&quot; distance function, while being cheap and simple to calculate.

Each Kademlia search iteration comes one bit closer to the target. A basic Kademlia search algorithm has complexity of &quot;&quot;, that means for network with formula_3 nodes it will take at most formula_2 steps to find that node.

=== Fixed-size routing tables ===
Fixed-size routing tables were presented in the pre-proceedings version of the original paper and are used in the later version only for some mathematical proofs. An actual Kademlia implementation does not have a fixed-size routing table, but a dynamically sized one.

Kademlia routing tables consist of a &quot;list&quot; for each bit of the node ID (e.g. if a node ID consists of 128 bits, a node will keep 128 such &quot;lists&quot;.) Every entry in a &quot;list&quot; holds the necessary data to locate another node. The data in each &quot;list&quot; entry is typically the &quot;IP address&quot;, &quot;port&quot;, and &quot;node ID&quot; of another node. Every &quot;list&quot; corresponds to a specific distance from the node. Nodes that can go in the nth &quot;list&quot; must have a differing nth bit from the node&#x27;s ID; the first n-1 bits of the candidate ID must match those of the node&#x27;s ID. This means that it is very easy to populate the first &quot;list&quot; as 1/2 of the nodes in the network are far away candidates. The next &quot;list&quot; can use only 1/4 of the nodes in the network (one bit closer than the first), etc.

With an ID of 128 bits, every node in the network will classify other nodes in one of 128 different distances, one specific distance per bit.

As nodes are encountered on the network, they are added to the &quot;lists&quot;. This includes store and retrieval operations and even helping other nodes to find a key. Every node encountered will be considered for inclusion in the &quot;lists&quot;. Therefore, the knowledge that a node has of the network is very dynamic. This keeps the network constantly updated and adds resilience to failures or attacks.

In the Kademlia literature, the &quot;lists&quot; are referred to as &quot;k-buckets&quot;. &quot;k&quot; is a system wide number, like 20. Every &quot;k&quot;-bucket is a &quot;list&quot; having up to &quot;k&quot; entries inside; i.e. for a network with k=20, each node will have &quot;lists&quot; containing up to 20 nodes for a particular bit (a particular distance from itself).

Since the possible nodes for each &quot;k-bucket&quot; decreases quickly (because there will be very few nodes which are that close), the lower bit &quot;k-buckets&quot; will fully map all nodes in that section of the network. Since the quantity of possible IDs is much larger than any node population can ever be, some of the &quot;k&quot;-buckets corresponding to very short distances will remain empty.

Consider the simple network to the right. The network size is 2^3 or eight maximum keys and nodes. There are seven nodes participating; the small circles at the bottom. The node under consideration is node six (binary 110) in black. There are three &quot;k-buckets&quot; for each node in this network. Nodes zero, one and two (binary 000, 001, and 010) are candidates for the furthest &quot;k-bucket&quot;. Node three (binary 011, not shown) is not participating in the network. In the middle &quot;k-bucket&quot;, nodes four and five (binary 100 and 101) are placed. Finally, the third &quot;k-bucket&quot; can only contain node seven (binary 111). Each of the three &quot;k-buckets&quot; are enclosed in a gray circle. If the size of the &quot;k-bucket&quot; was two, then the furthest &quot;2-bucket&quot; can only contain two of the three nodes. For example, if node six has node one and two in the furthest 2-bucket, it would have to request a node ID lookup to these nodes to find the location (ip address) of node zero. Each node &quot;knows&quot; its neighbourhood well and has contact with a few nodes far away which can help locate other nodes far away.

It is known that nodes which have been connected for a long time in a network will probably remain connected for a long time in the future. Due to this statistical distribution, Kademlia selects long connected nodes to remain stored in the k-buckets. This increases the number of known valid nodes at some time in the future and provides for a more stable network.

When a &quot;k-bucket&quot; is full and a new node is discovered for that &quot;k-bucket&quot;, the least recently seen node in the &quot;k-bucket&quot; is PINGed. If the node is found to be still alive, the new node is placed in a secondary list, a replacement cache. The replacement cache is used only if a node in the &quot;k-bucket&quot; stops responding. In other words: new nodes are used only when older nodes disappear.

=== Protocol messages ===
Kademlia has four messages.
* PING — Used to verify that a node is still alive.
* STORE — Stores a (key, value) pair in one node.
* FIND_NODE — The recipient of the request will return the k nodes in its own buckets that are the closest ones to the requested key.
* FIND_VALUE — Same as FIND_NODE, but if the recipient of the request has the requested key in its store, it will return the corresponding value.

Each RPC message includes a random value from the initiator. This ensures that when the response is received it corresponds to the request previously sent (see magic cookie).

=== Locating nodes ===
Node lookups can proceed asynchronously. The quantity of simultaneous lookups is denoted by α and is typically three. A node initiates a FIND_NODE request by querying to the α nodes in its own &quot;k-buckets&quot; that are the closest ones to the desired key. When these recipient nodes receive the request, they will look in their &quot;k-buckets&quot; and return the &quot;k&quot; closest nodes to the desired key that they know. The requester will update a results list with the results (node IDs) it receives, keeping the &quot;k&quot; best ones (the &quot;k&quot; nodes which are closer to the searched key) that respond to queries. Then the requester will select these &quot;k&quot; best results and issue the request to them, and iterate this process again and again. Since every node has a better knowledge of its own surroundings than any other node has, the received results will be other nodes that are every time closer and closer to the searched key. The iterations continue until no nodes are returned that are closer than the best previous results. When the iterations stop, the best k nodes in the results list are the ones in the whole network that are the closest to the desired key.

The node information can be augmented with round trip times, or RTT. This information will be used to choose a time-out specific for every consulted node. When a query times out, another query can be initiated, never surpassing α queries at the same time.

=== Locating resources ===
Information is located by mapping it to a key. A hash is typically used for the map. The storer nodes will have information due to a previous STORE message. Locating a value follows the same procedure as locating the closest nodes to a key, except the search terminates when a node has the requested value in its store and returns this value.

The values are stored at several nodes (k of them) to allow for nodes to come and go and still have the value available in some node. Periodically, a node that stores a value will explore the network to find the k nodes which are near the key value and replicate the value onto them. This compensates for disappeared nodes.

Also, for popular values that might have many requests, the load in the storer nodes is diminished by having a retriever store this value in some node near, but outside of, the k closest ones. This new storing is called a cache. In this way the value is stored further and further away from the key, depending on the quantity of requests. This allows popular searches to find a storer more quickly. Since the value is returned from nodes further away from the key, this alleviates possible &quot;hot spots&quot;. Caching nodes will drop the value after a certain time depending on their distance from the key.

Some implementations (e.g. Kad) have neither replication nor caching. The purpose of this is to remove old information quickly from the system. The node that is providing the file will periodically refresh the information onto the network (perform FIND_NODE and STORE messages). When all of the nodes having the file go offline, nobody will be refreshing its values (sources and keywords) and the information will eventually disappear from the network.

=== Joining the network ===
A node that would like to join the net must first go through a bootstrap process. In this phase, the joining node needs to know the IP address and port of another node—a bootstrap node (obtained from the user, or from a stored list)—that is already participating in the Kademlia network. If the joining node has not yet participated in the network it computes a random ID number, which by virtue of being a very large random number is extremely likely not to be already assigned to any other node. It uses this ID until leaving the network.

The joining node inserts the bootstrap node into one of its &quot;k-buckets&quot;. The joining node then performs a node lookup of its own ID against the bootstrap node (the only other node it knows). The &quot;self-lookup&quot; will populate other nodes&#x27; &quot;k-buckets&quot; with the new node ID, and will populate the joining node&#x27;s &quot;k-buckets&quot; with the nodes in the path between it and the bootstrap node. After this, the joining node refreshes all &quot;k-buckets&quot; further away than the &quot;k-bucket&quot; the bootstrap node falls in. This refresh is just a lookup of a random key that is within that &quot;k-bucket&quot; range.

Initially, nodes have one &quot;k-bucket&quot;. When the &quot;k-bucket&quot; becomes full, it can be split. The split occurs if the range of nodes in the &quot;k-bucket&quot; spans the node&#x27;s own id (values to the left and right in a binary tree). Kademlia relaxes even this rule for the one &quot;closest nodes&quot; &quot;k-bucket&quot;, because typically one single bucket will correspond to the distance where all the nodes that are the closest to this node are, they may be more than &quot;k&quot;, and we want it to know them all. It may turn out that a highly unbalanced binary sub-tree exists near the node. If &quot;k&quot; is 20, and there are 21+ nodes with a prefix &quot;xxx0011...&quot; and the new node is &quot;xxx0000&quot;11001&quot;&quot;, the new node can contain multiple &quot;k-buckets&quot; for the other 21+ nodes. This is to guarantee that the network knows about all nodes in the closest region.

=== Accelerated lookups ===
Kademlia uses an &quot;XOR metric&quot; to define distance. Two node IDs or a node ID and a key are XORed and the result is the distance between them. For each bit, the XOR function returns zero if the two bits are equal and one if the two bits are different. Distances in the XOR metric satisfy the triangle inequality: given A, B and C are vertices (points) of a triangle, then the distance from A to B is shorter than (or equal to) the sum of the distances from A to C and from C to B.

The &quot;XOR metric&quot; allows Kademlia to extend routing tables beyond single bits. Groups of bits can be placed in &quot;k-buckets&quot;. The group of bits are termed a prefix. For an &quot;m-bit&quot; prefix, there will be 2m-1 &quot;k-buckets&quot;. The missing &quot;k-bucket&quot; is a further extension of the routing tree that contains the node ID. An &quot;m-bit&quot; prefix reduces the maximum number of lookups from &quot;log2 n&quot; to &quot;log2m n&quot;. These are maximum values and the average value will be far less, increasing the chance of finding a node in a &quot;k-bucket&quot; that shares more bits than just the prefix with the target key.

Nodes can use mixtures of prefixes in their routing table, such as the Kad Network used by eMule. The Kademlia network could even be heterogeneous in routing table implementations, at the expense of complicating the analysis of lookups.

== Academic significance ==
While the XOR metric is not needed to understand Kademlia, it is critical in the analysis of the protocol. The XOR arithmetic forms an abelian group allowing closed analysis. Other DHT protocols and algorithms require simulation or complicated formal analysis in order to predict network behavior and correctness. Using groups of bits as routing information also simplifies the algorithms.

== Mathematical analysis of the algorithm ==
To analyze the algorithm, consider a Kademlia network of formula_2 nodes with IDs formula_6, each of which is a string of length formula_7 that consists of only ones and zeros. It can be modeled as a trie, in which each leaf represents a node, and the labeled path from the root to a leaf represents its ID. For a node formula_8, let formula_9 be the set of nodes (IDs) that share a prefix with formula_10 of length formula_11. Then filling the formula_12-th bucket of formula_10 can be modeled as adding pointers from the leaf formula_10 to formula_15 leaves (IDs) chosen uniformly at random from formula_9. Thus routing can be seen as jumping among the leaves along these pointers such that each step goes towards the target ID as much as possible, i.e., in a greedy way.

Let formula_17 be number of jumps needed to go from the leaf formula_10 to a target ID formula_19.
Assuming that formula_6 are chosen deterministically from formula_21,
it has been proved that 
:formula_22 
where formula_23 is the formula_15-th harmonic number. Since formula_25 as formula_26, when formula_15 is large formula_28 is bounded from above by about formula_29, however the IDs and the target are chosen. This justifies the intuition that in Kademlia only formula_1 nodes are contacted in searching for a target node.

To make the model closer to real Kademlia networks, formula_6 can also be assumed to be chosen uniformly at random without replacement from formula_21. Then it can be proved that for all formula_8 and formula_34,
:formula_35
where formula_36 is a constant depending only on formula_15 with formula_38 as formula_26. Thus for formula_15 large, formula_41 converges to a constant close formula_42. This implies that the number of nodes need to be contact in searching for a target node is actually formula_43 on average.

== Use in file sharing networks ==
Kademlia is used in file sharing networks. By making Kademlia keyword searches, one can find information in the file-sharing network so it can be downloaded.
Since there is no central instance to store an index of existing files, this task is divided evenly among all clients: If a node wants to share a file, it processes the contents of the file, calculating from it a number (hash) that will identify this file within the file-sharing network. Since file hashes and node IDs have the same length, the client can use the XOR distance function to search for several nodes whose ID is close to the hash, and instruct those nodes to store the publisher&#x27;s IP address in an implementation-defined manner. Nodes with IDs closest to the file hash will therefore have a list of IP addresses of peers/publishers of this file, from which a client may in an implementation-defined manner download the file.

Clients that wish to download the file from this publisher do not have to know the publisher&#x27;s IP address (there can be many publishers), but only the hash of the file. A searching client will use Kademlia to search the network for the node whose ID has the smallest distance to the file hash, then will retrieve the sources list that is stored in that node.

Since a key can correspond to many values, e.g. many sources of the same file, every storing node may have different information. Then, the sources are requested from all k nodes close to the key, k being the size of the bucket.

The file hash is usually obtained from a specially formed Internet magnet link found elsewhere, or included within an indexing file obtained from other sources.

Filename searches are implemented using keywords. The filename is divided into its constituent words. Each of these keywords is hashed and stored in the network, together with the corresponding filename and file hash. A search involves choosing one of the keywords, contacting the node with an ID closest to that keyword hash, and retrieving the list of filenames that contain the keyword. Since every filename in the list has its hash attached, the chosen file can then be obtained in the normal way.

<text>Aquaphobia () is an irrational fear of water.

Aquaphobia is considered a specific phobia of natural environment type in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;. A specific phobia is an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger.

==Etymology==

The correct Greek-derived term for &quot;water-fear&quot; is &quot;hydrophobia&quot;, from ὕδωρ (&quot;hudōr&quot;), &quot;water&quot; and φόβος (&quot;phobos&quot;), &quot;fear&quot;. However, this word has long been used in many languages, including English, to refer specifically to a symptom of later-stage rabies, which manifests itself in humans as difficulty in swallowing, fear when presented with liquids to drink, and an inability to quench one&#x27;s thirst. Therefore, fear or aversion to water in general is referred to as &quot;aquaphobia&quot;.

==Prevalence==
A study of epidemiological data from 22 low, lower-middle, upper-middle and high-income countries revealed &quot;fear of still water or weather events&quot; had a prevalence of 2.3%, across all countries; in the US the prevalence was 4.3%. In an article on anxiety disorders, Lindal and Stefansson suggest that aquaphobia may affect as many as 1.8% of the general Icelandic population, or almost one in fifty people. In America, 46% of American adults are afraid of deep water in pools and 64% are afraid of deep open waters.

==Manifestation for aquaphobia==
Specific phobias are a type of anxiety disorder in which a person may feel extremely anxious or have a panic attack when exposed to the object of fear. Specific phobias are a common mental disorder.

Psychologists indicate that aquaphobia manifests itself in people through a combination of experiential and genetic factors. Five common causes of aquaphobia are:
* Instinctive fear of drowning
* Past experience of an incident of personal horror
* Overprotective parent, or parent with aquaphobia
* Psychological difficulty adjusting to water
* Lack of trust in water

In the case of a 37 year old media professor, he noted that his fear initially presented itself as a &quot;severe pain, accompanied by a tightness of his forehead&quot;, and a choking sensation, discrete panic attacks and a reduction in his intake of fluids.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Physical responses include nausea, dizziness, numbness, shortness of breath, increased heart rate, sweating, and shivering.

In addition to the signs and symptoms above, some general signs and symptoms one may display in reaction to a specific phobia are:
* Physical symptoms: trembling, hot flushes or chills, pain or tightness in chest, butterflies in stomach, feeling faint, dry mouth, ringing in ears, and confusion
* Psychological symptoms: feeling fear of losing control, fainting, dread and dying

== Treatment and case studies ==
Treatment options include:
* Hypnosis and systematic desensitization. 28-year-old female, aquaphobic from childhood, hypnosis and systematic desensitization in an 8-week 5-session program, 2-month and 1-year follow up. 37-year-old male, 10 years of extreme aquaphobia (could not even drink water), 6 sessions of hypnotherapy, therapy was successful, no relapse and 6 month follow up.
* Cognitive behavioral therapy 
* Exposure therapy 
* Medication

* List of phobias
* Thalassophobia – fear of the sea

<text>Douglass Rupert Dumbrille (October 13, 1889 – April 2, 1974) was a Canadian actor who appeared regularly in films from the early 1930s.

==Life and career==
Douglass Dumbrille ( ) was born in Hamilton, Ontario. As a young man, he was employed as a bank clerk in Hamilton while pursuing an interest in acting. He eventually left banking for the theatre, finding work with a stock company that led him to Chicago, Illinois, and another that toured the United States. 

In 1913, the East Coast film industry was flourishing and that year he appeared in the film &quot;What Eighty Million Women Want&quot;, but it would be another 11 years before he appeared on screen again. In 1924, he made his Broadway debut and worked off and on in the theatre for several years while supplementing his income by selling such products as car accessories, tea, insurance, real estate, and books. 

During the Great Depression, Dumbrille resumed his screen career in Hollywood, where he specialized in playing secondary character roles alongside the great stars of the day. His physical appearance and suave voice equipped him for roles as slick politician, corrupt businessman, crooked sheriff, or unscrupulous lawyer. He was highly regarded by the studios, and was sought out by Cecil B. DeMille, Frank Capra, Hal Roach and other prominent Hollywood filmmakers. 

He played similar roles in Capra&#x27;s film &quot;Broadway Bill&quot; (1934) (and the 1950 remake, &quot;Riding High&quot;), and DeMille&#x27;s version of &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; (1938, and the 1958 remake). A friend of fellow Canadian-born director Allan Dwan, Dumbrille played Athos in Dwan&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1939).

Dumbrille had roles in more than 200 motion pictures. He also played villainous roles in comedies, projecting a balance of menace and pomposity opposite the Marx Brothers, Abbott and Costello, and The Bowery Boys.
He portrayed the Egyptian priest and magician Jannes in DeMille&#x27;s final film, &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956).

With the advent of television, Dumbrille made numerous appearances in the 1950s and 1960s. He played a flustered tycoon driven to distraction by Gracie Allen on the Burns and Allen episode &quot;Company for Christmas&quot; (1955). He was cast in six episodes of the religion anthology series, &quot;Crossroads&quot;. He portrayed Senator Bates in &quot;Thanksgiving Prayer&quot; (1956) with Ron Hagerthy of &quot;Sky King&quot;. Dumbrille then portrayed Mr. Willoughby in &quot;Big Sombrero&quot; (1957). He guest-starred in the 1957 episode &quot;The Fighter&quot; of the CBS situation comedy &quot;Mr. Adams and Eve&quot;. In 1958, he was cast as Mayor John Geary in three episodes of the NBC western series, &quot;The Californians&quot;. He subsequently guest-starred in Frank Aletter&#x27;s CBS sitcom, &quot;Bringing Up Buddy&quot;. He portrayed Mr. Osborne in six episodes of the 1963–1964 situation comedy &quot;The New Phil Silvers Show&quot;.

Dumbrille made two guest appearances as a judge on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Perry Mason&quot;; in 1964 he played Judge Robert Adler in &quot;The Case of the Latent Lover&quot;, and in 1965 he played an unnamed judge in &quot;The Case of the Duplicate Case&quot;. In his final television role, he portrayed a doctor in episode 10 of &quot;Batman&quot; in February 1966.

==Personal life==
Dumbrille&#x27;s wife Jessie Lawson, mother of their son John and daughter Douglass (Dougie), died in 1957 after 47 years of marriage. In 1960, at the age of 70, Dumbrille married Patricia Mowbray, the 28-year-old daughter of his friend and fellow actor, Alan Mowbray. In response to criticism of the May–December marriage, Dumbrille rebuffed: &quot;Age doesn’t mean a blasted thing. The important thing is whether two people can be happy together. Pat and I agreed that I had some years left and we could best share them together. We don’t give a continental damn what other people think.&quot;

Dumbrille died of a heart attack on April 2, 1974, at the Motion Picture Country Home and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.

<text>Orthomyxoviridae () is a family of negative-sense RNA viruses. It includes seven genera: &quot;Alphainfluenzavirus&quot;, &quot;Betainfluenzavirus&quot;, &quot;Gammainfluenzavirus&quot;, &quot;Deltainfluenzavirus&quot;, &quot;Isavirus&quot;, &quot;Thogotovirus&quot;, and &quot;Quaranjavirus&quot;. The first four genera contain viruses that cause influenza in birds (see also avian influenza) and mammals, including humans. Isaviruses infect salmon; the thogotoviruses are arboviruses, infecting vertebrates and invertebrates (such as ticks and mosquitoes). The Quaranjaviruses are also arboviruses, infecting vertebrates (birds) and invertebrates (arthropods).

The four genera of Influenza virus that infect vertebrates, which are identified by antigenic differences in their nucleoprotein and matrix protein, are as follows:
* &quot;Alphainfluenzavirus&quot; infects humans, other mammals, and birds, and causes all flu pandemics
* &quot;Betainfluenzavirus&quot; infects humans and seals
* &quot;Gammainfluenzavirus&quot; infects humans and pigs
* &quot;Deltainfluenzavirus&quot; infects pigs and cattle.

== Structure ==

The influenzavirus virion is pleomorphic; the viral envelope can occur in spherical and filamentous forms. In general, the virus&#x27;s morphology is ellipsoidal with particles 100–120 nm in diameter, or filamentous with particles 80–100 nm in diameter and up to 20 μm long. There are approximately 500 distinct spike-like surface projections in the envelope each projecting 10–14 nm from the surface with varying surface densities. The major glycoprotein (HA) spike is interposed irregularly by clusters of neuraminidase (NA) spikes, with a ratio of HA to NA of about 10 to 1.

The viral envelope composed of a lipid bilayer membrane in which the glycoprotein spikes are anchored encloses the nucleocapsids; nucleoproteins of different size classes with a loop at each end; the arrangement within the virion is uncertain. The ribonuclear proteins are filamentous and fall in the range of 50–130 nm long and 9–15 nm in diameter with helical symmetry.

== Genome ==
Viruses of the family &quot;Orthomyxoviridae&quot; contain six to eight segments of linear negative-sense single stranded RNA. They have a total genome length that is 10,000–14,600 nucleotides (nt). The influenza A genome, for instance, has eight pieces of segmented negative-sense RNA (13.5 kilobases total).

The best-characterised of the influenzavirus proteins are hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, two large glycoproteins found on the outside of the viral particles. Hemagglutinin is a lectin that mediates binding of the virus to target cells and entry of the viral genome into the target cell. In contrast, neuraminidase is an enzyme involved in the release of progeny virus from infected cells, by cleaving sugars that bind the mature viral particles. The hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins are key targets for antibodies and antiviral drugs, and they are used to classify the different serotypes of influenza A viruses, hence the &quot;H&quot; and &quot;N&quot; in &quot;H5N1&quot;.

The genome sequence has terminal repeated sequences, and these are repeated at both ends (i.e., at both the 5’ end and the 3’ end). These terminal repeats at the 5′-end are 12–13 nucleotides long. Nucleotide sequences at the 3′-terminus are identical, are the same in genera of the same family, most on RNA (segments), or on all RNA species. Terminal repeats at the 3′-end are 9–11 nucleotides long. Encapsidated nucleic acid is solely genomic. Each virion may contain defective interfering copies. In Influenza A (specifically, in H1N1) PB1-F2 is produced from an alternative reading frame in PB1. The M and NS genes produce two genes each (4 genes total) via alternative splicing.

== Replication cycle ==
Typically, influenza is transmitted from infected mammals through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating aerosols containing the virus, and from infected birds through their droppings. Influenza can also be transmitted by saliva, nasal secretions, feces and blood. Infections occur through contact with these bodily fluids or with contaminated surfaces. On certain surfaces (i.e, outside of a host), flu viruses can remain infectious for about one week at human body temperature, over 30 days at , and indefinitely at very low temperatures (such as in lakes in northeast Siberia). They can be inactivated easily by disinfectants and detergents.

The viruses interacts between its surface hemagglutinin glycoprotein to bind to the host’s surface sialic acid sugars, specifically on the surfaces of epithelial cells in the lung and throat (Stage 1 in infection figure). The cell imports the virus by endocytosis. In the acidic pH environment of the endosome, part of the hemagglutinin protein fuses the viral envelope with the vacuole&#x27;s membrane, releasing: the viral RNA (vRNA) molecules, accessory proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase into the host cell’s cytoplasm (Stage 2). These proteins and vRNA form a complex that is transported into the host cell nucleus, where the host’s own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase begins transcribing complementary positive-sense cRNA (Steps 3a and b). The cRNA is either exported into the cytoplasm and translated (step 4), or remains in the host nucleus. Newly synthesised viral proteins are either secreted through the Golgi apparatus onto the host cell surface (in the case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, step 5b) or transported back into the host nucleus, where they bind vRNA and form new viral genome particles (step 5a). Other viral proteins have multiple actions in the host cell, including degrading cellular mRNA and using those consequently-released nucleotides for vRNA synthesis, while also inhibiting translation of the host cell’s mRNAs.

A virion assembles from negative-sense vRNAs (that form the genomes of newly created viruses), RNA-dependent RNA transcriptase and other viral proteins. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules cluster into a bulge in the host cell membrane. The vRNA and viral core proteins leave the nucleus and enter this membrane protrusion (step 6). The mature virus buds off from the host cell in a sphere of host phospholipid membrane, acquiring hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with this membrane coat (step 7). As before, the viruses then adhere to the same host cell capsule through hemagglutinin; the mature viruses detach once their neuraminidase has cleaved sialic acid residues from the host cell. After the release of new influenza virus, the host cell dies, and infection repeats in other host cells.

Orthomyxoviridae viruses are one of two RNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus (the other being retroviridae). This is because the machinery of orthomyxo viruses cannot make their own mRNAs. They use cellular RNAs as primers for initiating the viral mRNA synthesis in a process known as cap snatching. Once in the nucleus, the RNA Polymerase Protein PB2 finds a cellular pre-mRNA and binds to its 5′ capped end. Then RNA Polymerase PA cleaves off the cellular mRNA near the 5′ end and uses this capped fragment as a primer for transcribing the rest of the viral RNA genome in viral mRNA. This is due to the need of mRNA to have a 5′ cap in order to be recognized by the cell&#x27;s ribosome for translation.

Since RNA proofreading enzymes are absent, the RNA-dependent RNA transcriptase makes a single nucleotide insertion error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides, which is the approximate length of the influenza vRNA. Hence, nearly every newly manufactured influenza virus will contain a mutation in its genome. The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing (reassortment) of the genes if more than one variety of influenza virus has infected the same cell (superinfection). The resulting alteration in the genome segments packaged into viral progeny confers new behavior, sometimes the ability to infect new host species or to overcome protective immunity of host populations to its old genome (in which case it is called an antigenic shift).

== Classification ==
In a phylogenetic-based taxonomy, RNA viruses include the subcategory negative-sense ssRNA virus, which includes the order &quot;Articulavirales&quot;, and the family &quot;Orthomyxoviridae&quot;. The genera-associated species and serotypes of &quot;Orthomyxoviridae&quot; are shown in the following table.

== Types ==
There are four genera of influenza virus, each containing only a single species, or type. Influenza A and C infect a variety of species (including humans), while influenza B almost exclusively infects humans, and influenza D infects cattle and pigs.

=== Influenza A ===
Influenza A viruses are further classified, based on the viral surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). 18 HA subtypes (or serotypes) and 11 NA subtypes of influenza A virus have been isolated in nature. Among these, the HA subtype 1-16 and NA subtype 1-9 are found in wild waterfowl and shorebirds and the HA subtypes 17-18 and NA subtypes 10-11 have only been isolated from bats.

Further variation exists; thus, specific influenza strain isolates are identified by the &quot;Influenza virus nomenclature,&quot; specifying virus type, host species (if not human), geographical location where first isolated, laboratory reference, year of isolation, and HA and NA subtype.

Examples of the nomenclature are:
# - isolated from a human
# - isolated from a pig

The type A influenza viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and cause the most severe disease. It is thought that all influenza A viruses causing outbreaks or pandemics originate from wild aquatic birds. All influenza A virus pandemics since the 1900s were caused by Avian influenza, through Reassortment with other influenza strains, either those that affect humans (seasonal flu) or those affecting other animals (see 2009 swine flu pandemic). The serotypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of confirmed human deaths, are:
* H1N1 caused &quot;Spanish flu&quot; in 1918 and &quot;Swine flu&quot; in 2009.
* H2N2 caused &quot;Asian Flu&quot;.
* H3N2 caused &quot;Hong Kong Flu&quot;.
* H5N1, &quot;avian&quot; or &quot;bird flu&quot;.
* H7N7 has unusual zoonotic potential.
* H1N2 infects pigs and humans.
* H9N2, H7N2, H7N3, H10N7.

=== Influenza B ===
Influenza B virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen, and is less common than influenza A. The only other animal known to be susceptible to influenza B infection is the seal. This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2–3 times lower than type A and consequently is less genetically diverse, with only one influenza B serotype. As a result of this lack of antigenic diversity, a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age. However, influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible. This reduced rate of antigenic change, combined with its limited host range (inhibiting cross species antigenic shift), ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur.

=== Influenza C ===
The influenza C virus infects humans and pigs, and can cause severe illness and local epidemics. However, influenza C is less common than the other types and usually causes mild disease in children.

=== Influenza D ===
This is a genus that was classified in 2016, the members of which were first isolated in 2011. This genus appears to be most closely related to Influenza C, from which it diverged several hundred years ago. There are at least two extant strains of this genus. The main hosts appear to be cattle, but the virus has been known to infect pigs as well.

== Viability and disinfection ==
Mammalian influenza viruses tend to be labile, but they can survive several hours in a host’s mucus. Avian influenza virus can survive for 100 days in distilled water at room temperature and for 200 days at . The avian virus is inactivated more quickly in manure but can survive for up to two weeks in feces on cages. Avian influenza viruses can survive indefinitely when frozen. Influenza viruses are susceptible to bleach, 70% ethanol, aldehydes, oxidizing agents and quaternary ammonium compounds. They are inactivated by heat at for minimum of 60 minutes, as well as by low pH &lt;2.

== Vaccination and prophylaxis ==

Vaccines and drugs are available for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infections. Vaccines are composed of either inactivated or live attenuated virions of the H1N1 and H3N2 human influenza A viruses, as well as those of influenza B viruses. Because the antigenicities of the wild viruses evolve, vaccines are reformulated annually by updating the seed strains.

More specifically, flu vaccines are made using the reassortment method, and this has been used for over 50 years. In this method, scientists inject eggs with both one noninfectious flu strain and also one infectious strain. The inert strain must be one that multiples very well in chicken eggs. Scientists pick an infectious strain that carries the desired HA and N receptors that the final product should prevent from infection. They choose these strains by picking the surface HA and NA versions circulating the most in the public, and the ones thought most likely to be prevalent in the upcoming flu season. The two strains—pathogenic and non pathogenic—then multiply and exchange DNA until an inert strain carries eight copies of the infectious strain’s two glycoprotein targets. Finally, of the newly created viruses, scientists pick six versions that multiplied the best in chicken eggs which also carry the necessary HA and NA genes. Ultimately, millions of eggs are injected with those noninfectious strains—which carry the desired proteins—so that the genes can be harvested and used for the vaccine product.

Another method of making the vaccine is by splicing genes from infectious strains and then creating copies in a lab, without the need for the tedious process of chicken egg culture. This method relies on using virus plasmids to excerpt the target genes.

When the antigenicities of the seed strains and wild viruses do not match, vaccines fail to protect the vaccines.

Drugs available for the treatment of influenza include Amantadine and Rimantadine, which inhibit the uncoating of virions by interfering with M2 proton channel, and Oseltamivir (marketed under the brand name Tamiflu), Zanamivir, and Peramivir, which inhibit the release of virions from infected cells by interfering with NA. However, escape mutants are often generated for the former drug and less frequently for the latter drug.

<doc id="532909" wikidata="Q57263003" url="?curid=532909" title="Aplysiida">
<text>The order Aplysiida, commonly known as sea hares (&quot;Aplysia&quot; species and related genera), are medium-sized to very large opisthobranch gastropod molluscs with a soft internal shell made of protein. These are marine gastropod molluscs in the superfamilies Aplysioidea and Akeroidea.

The common name &quot;sea hare&quot; is a direct translation from , as the animal&#x27;s existence was known in Roman times. The name derives from their rounded shape and from the two long rhinophores that project upward from their heads and that somewhat resemble the ears of a hare.

== Taxonomy ==
Many older textbooks and websites refer to this suborder as &quot;Aplysiida&quot;. The original author Paul Henri Fischer described the taxon Aplysiida at unspecified rank above family. In 1925 Johannes Thiele established the taxon Aplysiida as a suborder.

=== 2005 taxonomy ===
Since the taxon Aplysiida was not based on an existing genus, this name is no longer available according to the rules of the ICZN. Aplysiida has been replaced in the new Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet &amp; Rocroi, 2005) by the clade Aplysiomorpha.

The scientific name for the order in which they used to be classified, the Aplysiida, is derived from the Greek for &quot;without a shield&quot; and refers to the lack of the characteristic head shield found in the cephalaspidean opisthobranchs. Many Aplysiidans have only a thin, internal and much-reduced shell with a small mantle cavity; some have no shell at all. All species have a radula and gizzard plates.

=== 2010 taxonomy ===
Jörger et al. (2010) have moved this taxon (named as Aplysiida) to Euopisthobranchia.

===2017 taxonomy===
The name &quot;Aplysiomorpha&quot; was preferred by Bouchet and Rocroi (2005) over &quot;Aplysiida Fischer&quot;, 1883, but the authors now agree that there is a consistent usage for Aplysiida in the recent literature and that the older name must be preferred.

==Description==
Sea hares are mostly rather large, bulky creatures when adults. Juveniles are mainly unobserved on the shoreline. The biggest species, &quot;Aplysia vaccaria&quot;, can reach a length of and a weight of and is arguably the largest gastropod species.

Sea hares have soft bodies with an internal shell, and like all opisthobranch molluscs, they are hermaphroditic. Unlike many other gastropods, they are more or less bilaterally symmetrical in their external appearance. The foot has lateral projections, or &quot;parapodia&quot;.

==Life habits==

Sea hares are herbivorous, and are typically found on seaweed in shallow water. Some young sea hares seemingly are capable of burrowing in soft sediment, leaving only their rhinophores and mantle opening showing. Sea hares have an extremely good sense of smell. They can follow even the faintest scent using their rhinophores, which are extremely sensitive chemoreceptors.

Their color corresponds with the color of the seaweed they eat: red sea hares have been feeding on red seaweed. This camouflages them from predators. When disturbed, a sea hare can release ink from its ink glands, providing a fluid, smoke-like toxic screen, adversely affecting its predators&#x27; olfactory senses while acting as a powerful deterrent. The toxic ink may be white, purple, or red, depending on the pigments in their seaweed food source and lightens in color as it spreads, diluted by seawater. Their skin contains a similar toxin that renders sea hares largely inedible to many predators. In addition to the colored ink, sea hares can secrete a clear slime akin to that released defensively by hagfish which physically plugs the olfactory receptors of predators like lobsters.

Some sea hares can employ jet propulsion as a locomotion and others move like stingrays but with greater fluttering fluidity in their jelly-like &quot;wings&quot;. In the moving marine environment and without the sophisticated cognitive machinery of the cephalopods, their motion appears to be somewhat erratic, but they do reach their goals, such as the seabed, according to the wave-action, currents, or calmness of their area.

==Human use==
Sea hares are consumed in several parts of the world. An example may be &quot;酱爆海兔&quot; (&quot;&quot;), lit. &quot;sauce-fried sea hare&quot;, a Chinese dish featuring sea hare and occasionally squid quickly fried in a sauce.
In Hawaii, sea hares, or &quot;kualakai&quot;, are typically cooked in an imu wrapped in ti leaves.

&quot;Aplysia californica&quot; is a species of sea hare noteworthy for its use in studies of the neurobiology of learning and memory, due to its unusually large axons. It is especially associated with the work of Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel. Research surrounding the aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex may be of particular interest with respect to this.

Bla serves as a central location for NGO activity in the region and is a crossroads for transportation going northeast to Mopti and Gao, as well as south to Sikasso, Burkina Faso, and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. Bla is also the main town for the Djonka, a sub-group of the Bamana. The town&#x27;s population as of 2004 was around 15,000 people.

Bla was established as an outpost by Biton Mamary Coulibaly during the expansion of the Ségou (or Bamana) Empire around the first half of the 18th century. The verb &quot;ka bila&quot; means to &quot;leave behind&quot; in Bamana, thus Bla&#x27;s name relates to the town&#x27;s original function, a supply outpost where the Bamana Empire&#x27;s military left arms and grain for later use.

<doc id="532916" wikidata="Q2482835" url="?curid=532916" title="Luoshu Square">
<text>The Luoshu (pinyin), Lo Shu (Wade-Giles), or Nine Halls Diagram is an ancient Chinese diagram and named for the Luo River near Luoyang, Henan. The Luoshu appears in myths concerning the invention of writing by Cangjie and other culture heroes. It is a unique normal magic square of order three. It is usually paired with the River Map or Hetunamed in reference to the Yellow Riverand used with the River Map in various contexts involving Chinese geomancy, numerology, philosophy, and early natural science.

==Traditions==
The Lo Shu is part of the legacy of ancient Chinese mathematical and divination (cf. the I Ching ) traditions, and is an important emblem in &quot;Feng Shui&quot; ()—the art of geomancy concerned with the placement of objects in relation to the flow of qi (), or &quot;natural energy&quot;.

== History ==
A Chinese legend concerning the pre-historic Emperor Yu () tells of the Lo Shu, often in connection with the &quot;Yellow River Map&quot; (Hetu) and the eight trigrams. In ancient China there is a legend of a huge deluge: the people offered sacrifices to the god of one of the flooding rivers, the Luo river (), to try to calm his anger. A magical turtle emerged from the water with the curiously unnatural Lo Shu pattern on its shell: circular dots representing the integers one through nine are arranged in a three-by-three grid.

Early records dated to 650 BCE are ambiguous, referring to a &quot;river map&quot;, but clearly start to refer to a magic square by 80 CE, and explicitly give an example of one since 570 CE. Recent publications have provided support that the Lo Shu Magic Square was an important model for time and space. It served as a basis for city planning, and tomb and temple design. The magic square was incidentally used to designate spaces of political and religious importance. 

==The layout==
The odd and even numbers alternate in the periphery of the Lo Shu pattern; the four even numbers are at the four corners, and the five odd numbers (which outnumber the even numbers by one) form a cross in the center of the square. The sums in each of the three rows, in each of the three columns, and in both diagonals, are all 15. Since &quot;5&quot; is in the center cell, the sum of any two other cells that are directly through the five from each other must be 10; e.g., opposite squares and corners add up to 10, the number of the &quot;Yellow River Map&quot;.

==In numerology==
The Lo Shu is sometimes connected numerologically with the &quot;Bagua&quot; ( or eight trigrams&quot;), that can be arranged in the eight outer cells, reminiscent of circular trigram diagrams. Because north is placed at the bottom of maps in China, the 3x3 magic square having number 1 at the bottom and 9 at the top is used in preference to the other rotations/reflections. As seen in the &quot;Later Heaven&quot; arrangement, 1 and 9 correspond with ☵ Kǎn &quot;Water &quot; and ☲ Lí &quot;Fire &quot; respectively. In the &quot;Early Heaven&quot; arrangement, they would correspond with ☷ Kūn &quot;Earth &quot; and ☰ Qián &quot;Heaven &quot; respectively. Like the &quot;Yellow River Map&quot;, the Lo Shu square, in conjunction with the Bagua, is sometimes used as a mandalic representation important in Feng Shui geomancy.

<doc id="532918" wikidata="Q1680449" url="?curid=532918" title="Jim Gibbons (Irish politician)">
<text>James M. Gibbons (2 August 1924 – 20 December 1997) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Agriculture from 1970 to 1973 and 1977 to 1979, Minister for Defence from 1969 to 1970 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance from 1965 to 1969. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency from 1957 to 1981 and February 1982 to November 1982. He also served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1973 to 1977.

==Early life==
Gibbons was born in Bonnettsrath, County Kilkenny, the son of Martin Gibbons, a local farmer, and his wife Agnes (née Bowe). Gibbons was born into a political family. His uncle Seán Gibbons was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Cumann na nGaedheal candidate at the 1923 general election, but later joined the Farmer&#x27;s Party and eventually joined Fianna Fáil.

Gibbons was educated locally and later attended Kilkenny CBS and St Kieran&#x27;s College. Here, he earned a reputation on the sports field, winning a Leinster colleges&#x27; hurling title. Following the completion of his Leaving Certificate he studied medicine at University College Dublin, however, he abandoned his studies after two years to return to Kilkenny where he concentrated on farming. Gibbons later bought a 300-acre farm at the Pheasantgry, Dunmore, about four miles from Kilkenny.

==Political career==
Gibbons was politically active from an early age, having joined Fianna Fáil in his youth. He was co-opted onto Kilkenny County Council in 1954, and secured election to that authority in his own right the following year. He remained as a county councillor until 1967.

Gibbons was elected to Dáil Éireann for the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency at the 1957 general election. He secured re-election at the 1961 general election, however, he remained on the government backbenches for a second term.

Following the 1965 general election, Gibbons secured promotion to the junior ministerial ranks under Seán Lemass, when he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. In this position he served under Jack Lynch and later under Charles Haughey.

===Minister for Defence (1969–1970)===
Following Fianna Fáil&#x27;s fourth general election triumph in succession at the 1969 general election, Gibbons joined Jack Lynch&#x27;s cabinet as Minister for Defence. His short tenure in the role would come to define his political career. In August 1969, civil unrest in Northern Ireland boiled over and the Irish government were forced to act. Lynch urged his cabinet to take a cautious line and established a cabinet subcommittee to organise emergency assistance and relief. A government fund of £100,000 was set up to provide relief to nationalist civilians forced out of their homes by the Troubles, and Charles Haughey, as Minister for Finance, was given sole authority over this money. The Minister for Agriculture, Neil Blaney, allegedly made plans with Captain James Kelly to import weapons from continental Europe. Haughey provided the money for the purchase from his civilian relief fund, and also tried to arrange customs clearance for the shipment.

In May 1970, the Arms Crisis broke when Haughey and Blaney were sacked by Lynch when the plot to import arms was revealed. At the subsequent Arms Trial Gibbons would be the chief prosecutorial witness and his evidence would contradict Haughey&#x27;s. Haughey was found not guilty, therefore Gibbons was implied to have been dishonest, an allegation that affected him deeply. He was never charged with any offence himself and was angry that a Dáil motion of confidence in the government effectively turned into a debate about him personally.

===Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (1970–1973)===
In the wake of the Arms Crisis and the ministerial sackings, Gibbons was appointed as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. As a farmer, he was respected and liked by the farming community and its representatives. In his new role Gibbons played a key role in the agricultural negotiations concerning entry into the European Economic Community and in the amalgamation of creameries in the country.

===In opposition (1973–1977)===
Fianna Fáil lost office to a Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition following the 1973 general election. He remained a key member of Jack Lynch&#x27;s team. Shortly after the general election, he was appointed a member of the second delegation from the Oireachtas to the European Parliament. In 1975 Gibbons was appointed to Jack Lynch&#x27;s new front bench as Spokesperson on Agriculture. Charles Haughey, with whom he had clashed in the Arms Crisis, also re-joined the front bench.

===Minister for Agriculture (1977–1979)===

Following Fianna Fáil&#x27;s huge triumph at the 1977 general election, Gibbons&#x27;s tenure as an MEP ended and he returned to Jack Lynch&#x27;s new cabinet as Minister for Agriculture. Once again his appointment was welcomed by farmers.

In 1979, Gibbons clashed with Charles Haughey, the Minister for Health, over the Family Planning Bill. As a devout Catholic, Gibbons voted against the bill that legalised the sale of contraceptives. Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, took no action against him. This action only exacerbated the ill-feeling between Gibbons and Haughey.

In December 1979, Jack Lynch announced his resignation as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader. The subsequent leadership election was a contest between Haughey and George Colley. The latter had the backing of almost every member of the cabinet; however, a backbench revolt saw Haughey narrowly become Taoiseach and party leader.

In the resulting cabinet reshuffle Gibbons and Bobby Molloy lost their ministerial positions, as Haughey promoted backbenchers who had supported him.

===Later political career===
Following his departure from cabinet, Gibbons became a vocal critic of Haughey&#x27;s leadership of Fianna Fáil. After he lost his seat at the 1981 general election he openly called for a change of leadership within the party.

Gibbons regained his seat at the February 1982 general election and voted against Haughey in the leadership challenge that was proposed by Charlie McCreevy. Leaving Leinster House after the vote he was attacked by a number of Fianna Fáil supporters and forced to the ground. A friend of his saw off the attackers. In the aftermath, new swivel doors were erected to prevent mobs pushing their way into the parliament building. The incident was recounted by Desmond O&#x27;Malley in the RTÉ documentary series &quot;Seven Ages&quot; (although O&#x27;Malley does not mention Gibbons by name), and was later also referred to in the 2005 RTÉ biographical series &quot;Haughey&quot;.

A few weeks after this incident Gibbons suffered a heart attack and was unable to vote for Haughey later that year in a no-confidence motion at which point the government fell. He lost his seat at the November 1982 general election and effectively retired from politics.

==Retirement==
In retirement Gibbons suffered from ill health and suffered a number of heart attacks and strokes. He never fully recovered from the physical assault on him outside the Dáil in 1982.

In 1986, Gibbons offered his support to Desmond O&#x27;Malley and the new Progressive Democrats, as he believed that there was no longer a place for him within Haughey&#x27;s Fianna Fáil party. His son Martin Gibbons was elected to the Dáil for the new party in the 1987 general election. In 1997 another son, Jim Gibbons Jnr, was nominated by the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern as a member of the 21st Seanad.

==Death==
Jim Gibbons died on 20 December 1997 aged 73. He had married Margaret (Peg) O&#x27;Neill in 1950, and they had five sons and six daughters.

<doc id="532922" wikidata="Q1068952" url="?curid=532922" title="St. Elsewhere">
<text>St. Elsewhere is an American medical drama television series created by Joshua Brand and John Falsey that originally ran on NBC from October 26, 1982, to May 25, 1988. The series stars Ed Flanders, Norman Lloyd, and William Daniels as teaching doctors at an aging, run-down Boston hospital who give interns a promising future in making critical medical and life decisions. The series was produced by MTM Enterprises, which had success with a similar NBC series, the police drama &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, during that same time. The series were often compared to each other for their use of ensemble casts and overlapping serialized storylines (an original ad for &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; quoted a critic that called the series &quot;&quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; in a hospital&quot;).

Recognized for its gritty, realistic drama, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; gained a small yet loyal following (the series never ranked higher than 47th place in the yearly Nielsen ratings) over its six-season, 137-episode run; however, the series also found a strong audience in Nielsen&#x27;s 18–49 age demographic, a demo later known as a young, affluent audience that TV advertisers were eager to reach. The series also earned critical acclaim during its run, earning 13 Emmy Awards for its writing, acting, and directing and is widely regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time.

==Overview==
&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; was set at the fictional St. Eligius Hospital, a decaying urban teaching hospital in Boston&#x27;s South End neighborhood. (The South End&#x27;s Franklin Square House Apartments, formerly known as the St. James Hotel and located next to Franklin and Blackstone Squares, stood in for the hospital in establishing shots, including the series&#x27; opening sequence.) The hospital&#x27;s nickname, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, is a slang term used in the medical field to refer to lesser-equipped hospitals that serve patients turned away by more prestigious institutions; it is also used in medical academe to refer to teaching hospitals in general.

In the pilot episode, surgeon Dr. Mark Craig (William Daniels) informs his colleagues that the local Boston media had bestowed the derogatory nickname upon St. Eligius since they perceived the hospital as &quot;a dumping ground, a place you wouldn&#x27;t want to send your mother-in-law.&quot; In fact, the hospital was so poorly regarded that its shrine to Saint Eligius was commonly defiled by the hospital&#x27;s visitors and staff. Despite the hospital&#x27;s reputation, they employed some first-rate doctors—including Craig, a world-class heart surgeon. As well, their administrative staff was shown to care deeply about the hospital&#x27;s mission, even as they dealt with a lack of up-to-date equipment, funding, and experienced personnel.

Just as in &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; employed a large ensemble cast, a gritty, &quot;realistic&quot; visual style, and a multitude of interlocking serialized stories, many of which continued over the course of multiple episodes or seasons. In the same way &quot;Hill Street&quot; was regarded as a groundbreaking police drama, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; also broke new ground in medical dramas, creating a template that influenced &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, and other later shows in the genre. &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; portrayed the medical profession as an admirable but less-than-perfect endeavor; the St. Eligius staff, while mostly having good intentions in serving their patients, all had their own personal and professional problems, with the two often intertwining. The staff&#x27;s problems, and those of their patients (some of whom did not survive), were often contemporary in nature, with storylines involving breast cancer, AIDS, and addiction. Though the series dealt with serious issues of life, death, the medical profession, and the human effects of all three, a substantial number of comedic moments, inside jokes, and references to television history were included, as well as tender moments of humanity.

The producers for the series were Bruce Paltrow, Mark Tinker, John Masius, Tom Fontana, John Falsey and Abby Singer. Tinker, Masius, Fontana, and Paltrow wrote a number of episodes as well; other writers included John Tinker, John Ford Noonan, Charles H. Eglee, Eric Overmyer, Channing Gibson, and Aram Saroyan.

The show&#x27;s main and end title theme was composed by famed jazz musician and composer Dave Grusin. Noted film and TV composer J. A. C. Redford wrote the music for the series (except for the pilot, which was scored by Grusin). No soundtrack was ever released, but the theme was released in two different versions: the original TV mix and edit appeared on TVT Records&#x27; compilation &quot;Television&#x27;s Greatest Hits, Vol. 3: 70s &amp; 80s&quot;, and Grusin recorded a full-length version for inclusion on his &quot;Night Lines&quot; album, released in 1983.

==Main cast==
Along with established actors Ed Flanders, Norman Lloyd and William Daniels, &quot;St. Elsewhere&#x27;s&quot; ensemble cast included David Morse, Alfre Woodard, Bruce Greenwood, Christina Pickles, Kyle Secor, Ed Begley Jr., Stephen Furst, Howie Mandel, Mark Harmon, Denzel Washington and Helen Hunt. Notable guest stars include Tim Robbins, whose first major role was in the series&#x27; first three episodes as domestic terrorist Andrew Reinhardt, and Doris Roberts and James Coco, who each earned Emmy Awards for their season-one appearance as a bag lady and her mentally challenged husband.

==Episodes==
&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; ran for six seasons and 137 episodes; the first season (1982–83) aired Tuesdays at 10 p.m. (ET), with remaining seasons airing Wednesdays at 10 p.m.

&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; was noteworthy for featuring episodes with unusual aspects or significant changes to the series&#x27; status quo. Some of those episodes included:

===&quot;Qui Transtulit Sustinet&quot;===
&quot;Original air date: November 16, 1983&quot;

Dr. Morrison learns of the death of his wife, Nina (with whom he had an argument midway through the previous episode, which was the last time he saw her alive), after slipping and hitting her head. Nina&#x27;s heart is donated to a heart transplant patient—a patient of Dr. Craig. The poignant final scene of the episode finds Morrison entering the patient&#x27;s room and, with a stethoscope, hearing the patient&#x27;s new heart—Nina&#x27;s heart—steadily beating.

===&quot;Cheers&quot;===
&quot;Original air date: March 27, 1985&quot;

&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; ended its 3rd season with this TV crossover that found Drs. Westphall, Auschlander, and Craig getting together at &quot;Cheers&quot;. The scene, which was filmed on the main &quot;Cheers&quot; soundstage (Stage 25 at the Paramount Studios lot), finds Cliff Clavin trying and failing to gain free medical advice from the doctors, Auschlander confronting his former accountant Norm Peterson, and barmaid Carla Tortelli voicing her displeasure with the doctors regarding her stay in St. Eligius two years earlier for the birth of her baby. The scene ends with Westphall announcing to his two colleagues that he has decided to leave St. Eligius and medicine, a short-lived departure, as he returned in the Season 4 premiere.

The merger of &quot;Cheers&quot;&#x27; and &quot;St. Elsewhere&#x27;s&quot; universes created a discontinuity with the second season finale, &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, in which Dr. Morrison and his young son spend a day on the town and visit the real-world Bull and Finch Pub, the banners out front celebrating it as the inspiration for (and exterior view of) &quot;Cheers&quot;.

===&quot;Time Heals&quot;===
&quot;Original air date: February 19 and 20, 1986&quot;

This two-part episode featured storylines that fleshed out the 50-year history of St. Eligius, each sequence taped in a different style (i.e. black-and-white for the 1930s setting, muted colors for the 1940s). The storylines included the hospital&#x27;s 1936 founding by Fr. Joseph McCabe (played by Edward Herrmann), the arrivals of Dr. Auschlander and Nurse Rosenthal, the early struggles of Mark Craig and his relationship with his mentor (which mirrored Craig&#x27;s later mentoring of Dr. Ehrlich), the death of Dr. Westphall&#x27;s wife, and Dr. Morrison simultaneously dealing with an overdose patient, a knee injury, and the disappearance of his son. &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;Time Heals&quot; No. 44 on its 1997 list of &quot;100 Greatest Episodes of All Time&quot;, calling the episode &quot;a masterwork of dramatic writing.&quot;

===&quot;After Life&quot;===
&quot;Original air date: November 26, 1986&quot;

This episode deals with the shooting of Dr. Wayne Fiscus, who is critically wounded after being shot by the vengeful wife of a patient he is treating in the ER. As the staff frantically try to save him, Fiscus ventures back-and-forth between Hell (where he meets a former colleague, rapist Peter White), Purgatory, and Heaven, where he has a conversation with God, who presents Himself as a spitting image of Fiscus. Just as Fiscus shakes hands with Lou Gehrig, his colleagues successfully revive him.

===&quot;Last Dance at the Wrecker&#x27;s Ball&quot;===
&quot;Original air date: May 27, 1987&quot;

In the season-five finale, all attempts to save St. Eligius from closing seem to have failed. As demolition begins, a frail Dr. Auschlander, accidentally left in the hospital after a relapse, attempts to escape.

===&quot;A Moon For the Misbegotten&quot;===
&quot;Original air date: September 30, 1987&quot;

St. Eligius is saved (and any damage from the above-mentioned &quot;Wrecker&#x27;s Ball&quot; repaired), but it falls under the new ownership of Ecumena Corporation, a national managed health care concern. (The use of &quot;Ecumena&quot; garnered some real-life controversy, as Humana thought the use of that name sounded too much like its own. The trademark-infringement lawsuit that ensued prompted NBC to begin airing post-episode disclaimers stating that Ecumena was indeed fictional, and to change the corporate name mid-season to &quot;Weigert&quot;.) Ecumena&#x27;s choice to head St. Eligius, Dr. John Gideon, did not get along well with the St. Eligius staff, especially Dr. Westphall, who, in the final scene of this episode (and Ed Flanders&#x27;s last moment as a &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; series regular), delivers his resignation &quot;in terms you can understand&quot;—by dropping his pants and exposing his bare buttocks to Gideon (&quot;You can kiss my ass, pal&quot;). This scene, which would normally be considered controversial, was preserved by NBC&#x27;s censors as they did not consider Westphall&#x27;s display to be erotic in nature.

===&quot;Their Town&quot;===
&quot;Original air date: April 20, 1988&quot;

In a somewhat change-of-pace episode, Drs. Craig and Novino, Ellen Craig, and Lizzie Westphall visit Donald and Tommy Westphall (Lizzie&#x27;s father and brother, respectively), who appear to be enjoying the quiet life in small town New Hampshire. The episode features Dr. Westphall occasionally breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the viewer, a la the &quot;Stage Manager&quot; character in &quot;Our Town&quot; (the episode title and its location are nods to the Thornton Wilder play). The teleplay for &quot;Their Town&quot; was written by &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; cast member Sagan Lewis (as &quot;S.J. Lewis&quot;), although her character of Dr. Wade does not appear.

===&quot;The Last One&quot;===

&quot;Original air date: May 25, 1988&quot;

&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;″s series finale features momentous changes for several main characters, including the departures of Drs. Fiscus and Morrison and the death of Dr. Auschlander, as well as the return of Dr. Westphall to an active leadership role at St. Eligius after Weigert agrees to sell the hospital back to the Boston archdiocese, as Dr. Gideon is set to move on to another hospital in San Jose, California.

The finale is more known for its provocative final scene: Westphall and his son Tommy Westphall (played by Chad Allen), who has autism, are seen in Dr. Auschlander&#x27;s office watching snow falling outside. The image cuts to an exterior shot of the hospital, shaking. At that moment, Tommy and Daniel Auschlander are seen in an apartment building, with Tommy sitting on the floor playing with a snow globe. A much younger-looking Donald arrives home from a day of work, and it is clear from the uniform he wears and the dialog in this scene that he works in construction. &quot;Auschlander&quot; is revealed to be Donald&#x27;s father, and thus Tommy&#x27;s grandfather. Donald laments to his father, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand this autism thing, Pop. Here&#x27;s my son. I talk to him. I don&#x27;t even know if he can hear me, because he sits there, all day long, in his own world, staring at that toy. What&#x27;s he thinking about?&quot; As Tommy shakes the snow globe, he is told by his father to come and wash his hands for dinner. Donald places the snow globe on the family&#x27;s television set and walks into the kitchen with Tommy and Auschlander; as they leave the room, the camera closes in on the snow globe—which holds a replica of St. Eligius.

The most common interpretation of this scene is that the entire series of events in the series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; has been a product of Tommy Westphall&#x27;s imagination, with elements of the above scene used as its own evidence. Author Cynthia Burkhead explains that with this final shot, &quot;St. Elsewhere managed to take the idea of a dream and alter it just enough, putting it in the imagination of an autistic boy&quot;, and surmises that an ending constructed in this manner &quot;reminds viewers that the fiction they have watched for six years is actually fiction within a fiction, occupying a second level of unreality, one level beyond the space of illusion filled by all narrative television.&quot; A notable result of this ending has been the attempt by individuals to determine how many television shows are also products of Tommy Westphall&#x27;s mind owing to its shared fictional characters (the &quot;Tommy Westphall Universe&quot;).

&quot;The Last One&quot;&#x27;s closing credits differ from those of the rest of the series. In all other episodes, the credits appear over a still image of an ongoing surgical operation, followed by the traditional MTM Productions black-backgrounded logo, featuring Mimsie the Cat in a cartoon surgical cap and mask. Here, the credits appear on a black background, flanked by an electrocardiogram and an IV bag, with Mimsie lying on her side at the top of the screen; at the end of the credits, the heart monitor flatlines, and Mimsie dies, thus ending &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; for good. Coincidentally, Mimsie the Cat died in real life shortly after the airing of &quot;The Last One&quot; at the age of 20.

&quot;The Last One&quot; brought in 22.5 million viewers, ranking 7th out of 68 programs that week and attracting a 17.0/29 rating/share, and ranking as the most watched episode of the series. In 2011, the finale was ranked No. 12 on the TV Guide Network special &quot;TV&#x27;s Most Unforgettable Finales&quot;.

==Broadcast history and Nielsen ratings==
The ratings for &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;″s first season were so poor that NBC hesitated to renew the show and the crew understood it to be cancelled. After a ratings pop from the season finale, network CEO Grant Tinker (Mark&#x27;s father and a co-founder of MTM) personally intervened to continue the show. However, it struggled for renewals throughout its run due to its below-average overall ratings/viewership.

==Allusions, crossovers, and homages==
&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; was known for the insertion of several allusions both large and small to classic movies, pop culture, and television events (the latter especially) throughout its run, including other shows that were produced by MTM Enterprises. Some of the more noteworthy allusions have included:
* The St. Eligius public address loudspeakers periodically summoned characters from other television series, often going unnoticed by the show&#x27;s characters.
* The character of hospital orderly Warren Coolidge (played by Byron Stewart) was carried over from &quot;The White Shadow&quot;, where Coolidge had been a student at Carver High. (Before &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, Bruce Paltrow served as &quot;Shadow&#x27;s&quot; showrunner.) Coolidge occasionally sported a Carver High T-shirt while working at St. Eligius. In third-season episode &quot;Any Portrait in a Storm&quot;, Coolidge sees guest star Timothy Van Patten (another &quot;Shadow&quot; alumnus) in an elevator and calls out &quot;Hey! Salami!,&quot; to which Van Patten, playing an unrelated character (named Dean, in a three episode story arc), replies &quot;You got the wrong guy, pal,&quot; leaving Coolidge trying to plead his case with a confused &quot;No – it&#x27;s Warren,&quot; as the elevator doors close.
* In the third season episode &quot;Playing God, Part 2&quot;, the Craigs are in their bedroom and Mrs. Craig says she wants to see who is on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. Dr. Craig says, &quot;Probably some stupid comic.&quot; She turns on the TV and Howie Mandel, the actor/comedian who played Dr. Wayne Fiscus on the show, can be heard. Dr. Craig says, &quot;What is he wearing, a hand?&quot; (a reference to Mandel&#x27;s routine that involved wearing a surgical glove on his head, or more likely his prop &quot;handbag&quot; which was shaped like a hand).
* The third season episode &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; features a recreation of the music video for the ZZ Top song &quot;Legs&quot;. It features the Eliminator car, but the band was played by members of the cast.
* The fourth season episode &quot;Close Encounters&quot; has numerous crossovers.
** In the psychiatric ward, patients watch various MTM-produced shows on television – MTM (headed by Mary Tyler Moore and Grant Tinker) was the company that produced &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;.
*** The patients briefly watch MTM&#x27;s &quot;The White Shadow&quot;, produced by &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; showrunner Bruce Paltrow. It is seen here as fictional, even though orderly Warren Coolidge is a carryover from &quot;The White Shadow&quot; (see above). (In the previous season, the bar from &quot;Cheers&quot; is seen as both fictional &quot;and&quot; part of the &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; universe.)
** The amnesiac patient John Doe #6, a recurring character played by Oliver Clark, while watching an episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; on a hospital TV, believes himself to be that series&#x27; lead character Mary Richards. He then mistakes guest star Betty White, who had already appeared on the show in a straight role as a naval officer, for Sue Anne (the character White had played on that same show). She responds, &quot;I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ve mistaken me for someone else.&quot;
** John Doe #6 is verbally disparaged by another patient in the psychiatric ward — Elliott Carlin, the resident neurotic from &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; played by Jack Riley. Carlin&#x27;s treatment of Doe mirrored his behavior toward Oliver Clark&#x27;s &quot;Bob Newhart Show&quot; character, Mr. Herd. Mr. Carlin subsequently appeared on an episode of &quot;Newhart&quot;, still uncured from the damage caused by &quot;some quack in Chicago.&quot;
* In &quot;Santa Claus Is Dead&quot;, Dr. Craig mentions serving in Korea with his drinking buddy, B. J. Hunnicutt, implying that Dr. Hunnicutt was reassigned to another unit in Korea following the July 1953 deactivation of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital at the end of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;&#x27;s finale, &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;.
* The crew filled the series finale, &quot;The Last One&quot;, with an abundance of allusions and homages. The cold open has Dr. Fiscus saying to an ER patient &quot;General Sarnoff...&quot; (the man responsible for launching NBC, the first television network, in 1926) &quot;... cut down the time you spend in front of the television&quot;. There is a direct reference to the 1967 series finale of &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, when orderly Coolidge catches a &quot;One-Armed Man&quot;, on a water tower, for &quot;Dr. Kimble&quot;. A patient appears to get his hair cut by (&quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;&#x27;s) Floyd the Barber, including his first name, face and clothing. There is a call over the public address system for a Code Blue (someone has reached their &quot;end&quot;) in &quot;Room 222&quot;. There is a direct reference to the 1977 series finale of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, including a group hug, a group shuffle to get tissues and a suggestion that they sing &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot;. The finale for the character Dr. Henry Blake in a 1975 episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; is referred to when cadaver &quot;4077&quot; is autopsied after a &quot;helicopter crash&quot;. There are numerous song references, including Dr. Fiscus saying &quot;It&#x27;s the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine&quot;, and Dr. Auschlander exclaiming &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack, what was that flash?&quot;

&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; was also host to one crossover, served as the source material for two others, and has been paid homage to in several ways:
* The third season&#x27;s finale featured Drs. Westphall, Auschlander, and Craig visiting the eponymous pub of &quot;Cheers&quot; (also set in Boston) for a drink. During the second season of &quot;Cheers&quot;, barmaid Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) gave birth to a child at St. Eligius, and here expresses her displeasure about her hospitalization there, even getting into a verbal altercation with Dr. Craig.
* Two &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; characters were carried over to the NBC series &quot;&quot;, which was executive produced by &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; alumnus Tom Fontana. In an episode in season six entitled &quot;Mercy&quot;, Alfre Woodard reprises her role of Dr. Roxanne Turner, who is accused of illegally euthanizing a cancer patient. Woodard was nominated for an Emmy Award as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her performance. In other &quot;Homicide&quot; episodes, the character of Detective Tim Bayliss (played by Kyle Secor) develops a bad back and is treated by an offscreen &quot;Dr. Ehrlich&quot;. In the &quot;Homicide: The Movie&quot; finale, Ed Begley Jr., makes an uncredited appearance as Dr. Victor Ehrlich.
* Ed Begley Jr., William Daniels, Stephen Furst, and Eric Laneuville reunited to appear in a season-one episode of &quot;Scrubs&quot; where the actors, rather than reprising their &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; roles, play a quartet of doctors that fall sick at a medical convention. The episode was part of a week-long series of events honoring NBC&#x27;s 75th Anniversary.
* Episode 7 (&quot;There Are No F**king Sides&quot;) of Season 1 of Showtime&#x27;s series &quot;City on a Hill&quot; (based in early 1990s Boston) includes an establishing shot of the exterior of St. Eligius, along with hospital scenes in which Dr. Morrison is referenced by a character, and in which Drs. Axelrod, Wade, Westphall, and Fiscus and Nurse Papandreau are paged in the background on the hospital&#x27;s PA system. In S01E08, St. Eligius was mentioned by name.
* In &quot;Oz&quot;, the company Weigert (which played a major role in &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;&#x27;s final season) takes over the prison&#x27;s medical ward after the company makes a deal with Governor Devlin in Season 3. During the final season, nurse and angel of mercy serial killer is mentioned as having been fired from numerous hospitals prior to joining Oz&#x27;s medical staff, including St. Elsewhere.
* In the 2023 Rock N Roll Biographies comic book on King Diamond from Ten Ton Press, the ending is a direct homage to the final episode which writer Spike Steffenhagen has called &quot;The greatest ending to any television show.&quot; The final panel features a couple looking at their two black cats (who have appeared as giants throughout the story) staring into a snow globe with a haunted house in it.

==Awards and nominations==

&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; won 24 out of 106 award nominations. The series garnered 62 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning 13 of them. Out the thirteen wins, Ed Flanders won once and William Daniels won twice for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, Bonnie Bartlett and Doris Roberts each won for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, James Coco won for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, John Masius and Tom Fontana won two awards for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series, and Mark Tinker won for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. It received five Golden Globe Award nominations, with four of them for Best Television Series – Drama. &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; received seven TCA Award nominations, winning once for Outstanding Achievement in Drama. The series also won three out of four Q Awards. Additional accolades include a Peabody Award and People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite New TV Dramatic Program.

==Film adaptation==
In May 2003, Walden Media announced a partnership with Roth Films to create a film adaptation of the television series. It was never made.

==Syndication==
After its initial run, reruns of &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; aired for a time in syndication, with later runs on Nick at Nite, TV Land, Bravo and AmericanLife TV Network.

Also a popular series in the United Kingdom, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; has been aired twice by two separate British broadcasters. Channel 4 aired the series between 1983 and 1989, with Sky One later airing repeats in a daily Midday timeslot during 1992–93. In 2009, Channel 4 began showing the series again, usually at around 03:30 AM, and have repeated the entire series several times since then. All 137 episodes are also available to view online at All 4.

Nick at Nite first added &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; to its regular lineup on April 29, 1996, as part of an all-night sneak peek of sister network TV Land. After the sneak peek, Nick at Nite aired &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; regularly from May 4 until July 6, 1996, every Saturday night as part of a short-lived programming block called &quot;Nick at Nite&#x27;s TV Land Sampler.&quot; &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; was one of many rotating shows airing Saturday nights as part of &quot;Nick at Nite&#x27;s TV Land Sampler&quot;, which included (among other shows) &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot; and &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; along with past Nick at Nite Classics &quot;Mister Ed&quot; and &quot;Green Acres&quot;. Nick at Nite aired reruns of &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; once again from June 30 until July 4, 1997, as part of the week-long event &quot;The 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time&quot;.
Theme music-- St. Elsewhere/Music composed by Dave Grusin. Robert David Grusin, an American composer, arranger, producer, jazz pianist, and band leader, has composed many scores for feature films and television, and has won numerous awards for his soundtrack and record work, including an Academy Award and 10 Grammy Awards.

<text>Ernest Henry Starling (17 April 1866 – 2 May 1927) was a British physiologist who contributed many fundamental ideas to this subject. These ideas were important parts of the British contribution to physiology, which at that time led the world.

He made at least four significant contributions: 1. In the capillary, water is forced out through the pores in the wall by hydrostatic pressure and driven in by the osmotic pressure of plasma proteins (or oncotic pressure). These opposing forces approximately balance; which is known as Starling&#x27;s Principle. 2. The discovery of the hormone secretinwith his brother-in-law William Baylissand the introduction of the word hormone. 3. The analysis of the heart&#x27;s activity as a pump, which is known as the Frank–Starling law. 4. Several fundamental observations on the action of the kidneys. These include evidence for the existence of vasopressin, the anti-diuretic hormone. He also wrote the leading textbook of physiology in English, which ran through 20 editions.

==Rising to prominence==

Ernest Starling became a medical student at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, London, in 1882 (when he was 16). He had a brilliant career there and set his sights on becoming a Harley Street physician. But the science behind medicinephysiologyattracted him much more; he spent a long vacation in Wilhelm Kühne&#x27;s laboratory in Heidelberg, studying the mechanisms of lymph formation and convinced himself that he could become a physiologist. At that time such a job description did not exist in Britain.

Guy&#x27;s had no physiological laboratories, but Starling&#x27;s enthusiasm changed all this, and he published nine papers on lymph and capillary function between 1893 and 1897. He showed that there are opposing forces across the capillary wallan outward movement of water due to hydrostatic pressure (derived from the heart&#x27;s contraction) and an inward movement, secondary to the osmotic pressure of the plasma proteins within the capillary. Without awareness of these forces, the physician cannot begin to understand such conditions as edema. The inward and outward forces are often referred to as &quot;Starling forces&quot;. They established him as a serious contributor.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1899.

==Hormones==

Starling enjoyed collaborating with William Bayliss (1860–1924), who was on the staff of University College London (UCL), and together they published on the electrical activity of the heart and on peristalsis. In 1891, when he was 25, Starling married Florence Amelia Wooldridge, the widow of Leonard Charles Wooldridge, who had been his physiology teacher at Guy&#x27;s and died at the age of 32. She was a great support to Starling as a sounding board, secretary, and manager of his affairs as well as mother of their four children. In 1893 Bayliss married Gertrude, Starling&#x27;s sister, so the two were brothers-in-law. When Starling was appointed professor at UCL in 1899, the scientific family was even closer. Bayliss and Starling were in the newspaper&#x27;s headlines when involved in the Brown Dog affair, a controversy relating to vivisection.

Bayliss and Starling investigated pancreatic secretion, which at that time was believed to be entirely under nervous control. They showed that whenever food or acid was put into the duodenum some blood-borne stimulus was released, causing the pancreas to secrete. They called this substance secretin and Starling proposed that the body produces many secretin-like molecules, and in 1905 proposed that these substances should be called hormones. By doing this, he began a whole new biological subject, which became known as endocrinology.

==Medical education==

Starling felt passionately about many subjects, one of which was medical education. He found the lack of science behind medical practice intolerable, and when in 1910 a Royal Commission (The Haldane Commission) was set up to improve medical education, Starling was an enthusiastic contributor. One of the consequences of the commission was the establishment of medical units in London teaching hospitals: clinical practice supported by laboratory research is now taken for granted in every large institution. For this, we must thank Starling&#x27;s and William Osler&#x27;s evidence given before the Haldane Commission.

==The law of the heart==

The physiological discovery most often associated with Starling is the Law of the Heart. Occupying two years of his life (1910–1912) his investigations examined how the heart increased its output in response to more blood entering the organ, which increases the size of the chambers during filling. For this work he made use of the anaesthetized dog, in an experimental arrangement known as the heart-lung preparation. This played an important role in subsequent experiments, when he was not primarily interested in blood flow.

Starling was unaware of previous work by a German physiologist, Otto Frank, using the isolated frog heart. Frank showed that the longer the heart-muscle fibres were stretched the stronger the contraction. He did this with no interest in the circulation as a whole, so his findings have to be taken in parallel with Starling&#x27;s, thus it became the Frank–Starling law.

==World War I==

During the 1914–1918 war, Starling first was involved in research into poison gases. As a commissioned officer he found the organization of the matter chaotic and on several occasions was very outspoken to his war office superiors. This did his prospects no good at all. Many of his distinguished contemporaries received knighthoods. Starling was awarded a CMG. He resigned from the army in June 1917 and finally was able to undertake war work that utilized his abilities. As chairman of the Royal Society Food (War) Committee, he was instrumental in setting up rationing that provided needed calories and also the nutritional supplements then known. Rationing actually improved nutrition in wartime Britain. Germany had a similar food shortage during the war, but coped with it disastrously.

==Post-war==

Starling returned to UCL at the end of the war. His wartime experiences had left him with a scathing vision on how the country was run, and in particular the educational system. He was especially outspoken on public (the British designation for private) school education. And particularly the teaching of classics themes: &quot;After nine years, nine-tenths of the boys can read neither Latin nor Greek. They may have acquired a few catchwords or allusions to classical mythology, but they can give no account of the manner in which the Greeks lived, or the part played by Greek philosophy in the evolution of modern ideas, or in the way in which western government has been founded on Roman inventions.&quot;

During the 1920s he was very busy doing experiments and his reputation attracted distinguished collaborators. Many of these involved the heart-lung preparation. It was used to investigate the control of blood pressure (with G. V. Anrep), the activity of insulin (with F. P. Knowlton), and renal function (with E. B. Verney). In 1923–24 the American embryologist, George Washington Corner worked with Starling in his laboratory. In 1920, Starling was found to have colonic cancer, and the surgeon Arbuthnot Lane removed half of his colon. It seriously limited his exceptional physical activities: he gave up mountaineering, for example.

==The Nobel Committee==

Starling&#x27;s relationship with the Nobel Prize is of interest. He was first proposed for the prize in 1913 by Otto Loewi (who won a Prize himself in 1936). Starling&#x27;s subject was hormones, with secretin being prominent. The assessor, J. E. Johansson, decided that Starling should receive the prize, but not yet. No prize was given during World War I. In 1920 August Krogh, a Danish physiologist was rewarded for his work on capillaries (his findings were not actually as significant as Starling&#x27;s had been, twenty years before: but the significance of &#x27;Starling forces&#x27; in the capillary had not become apparent).

In 1926, Starling was proposed again, this time for his work on the kidney. On this occasion, Johansson felt that Starling&#x27;s hormone studies should have been rewarded. But by then the experiments had been done almost a quarter of a century before, and Johansson felt that the prize should be given for recent discoveries. He had forgotten that it was he who had put Starling&#x27;s work on the back burner in 1913. Subsequent British Laureates (such as Gowland Hopkins and Charles Sherrington) were given the prize for work they had done twenty or thirty years before. But by this time Johansson was no longer involved with the awarding of the prize.

==Death==

The exact circumstances of Starling&#x27;s death are far from clear. He was on a pleasure cruise in the West Indies, but when his ship, the Elders &amp; Fyffes banana boat &quot;Ariguani&quot;, tied up in Kingston harbour he was found to be dead. He was apparently travelling by himself, and there were no friends or relations at his funeralin pouring rainin Kingston, Jamaica. No autopsy was performed, so the cause of his death which one may presume to be cancer secondary to his colon tumourwas never established.

His death marked the end of an outstanding contributor to medical science. In the words of Henry Dale, &quot;All had found him a generous comrade and leader, and it is impossible to think of physiology in the last thirty years without Starling as the central figure of inspiration … his courage was indomitable, his energy and his passion for knowledge flouted all restraint.&quot;

==Descendants==

Two of his great-grandchildren, Boris Starling (born 1969) and Belinda Starling (1972–2006) are writers.

His daughter Muriel (born c1893), married Sydney Patterson at St. Mary&#x27;s Kilburn, London in 1919.

<text>Alfons Goppel (1 October 1905 – 24 December 1991) was a German politician of the CSU party and Prime Minister of Bavaria (1962–1978).

==Biography==
Alfons Goppel was born in Reinhausen (now Regensburg), one of the nine children of the baker Ludwig Goppel and his wife Barbara.

He married Gertrud Wittenbrink in 1935 and they had six sons.

Goppel studied law in Munich from 1925 to 1929 and, after graduating, moved back to Regensburg, where he became a lawyer. He joined the state prosecutors office in 1934 and was posted to Mainburg, Kaiserslautern and finally Aschaffenburg. He joined the conservative Bavarian People&#x27;s Party in 1930 and was a member until the party&#x27;s self-dissolution in November 1933. He joined the SA (1933) and the NSDAP (1937) in the following years.

He took part in the campaigns in France and Russia in the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War and later became an instructor at the &quot;Infanterieschule Döberitz&quot;, near Berlin, a training camp of the German army.

Returning from the war, he became an official at the city of Aschaffenburg, responsible for housing and refugees. He was elected to the Bavarian &quot;Landtag&quot; in October 1947 but barred from taking up his seat due to his political past. He, unsuccessfully, campaigned for the &quot;Landtag&quot; in 1950 again, became second mayor of Aschaffenburg in 1952 and finally, in 1954, was elected to the &quot;Landtag&quot; and permitted to take up his seat. He remained in the Bavarian parliament until 1978, when he gave it up to become a member of the European Parliament.

He unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Würzburg in 1956 and became an under secretary in the Bavarian Ministry of Justice the year after. He was Bavarian Minister of the Interior (1958–1962) and prime minister of Bavaria from 11 December 1962 to 7 November 1978, serving as President of the Bundesrat in 1972/73. In 1974 he gained the highest election victory for the CSU in Bavarian history with 62.1% of the votes.

From 1979 to 1984 he was a member of the European Parliament, as such being part of the first freely elected group of MPs in 1979. He died, aged 86, in Johannesberg, near Aschaffenburg.

One of his sons, Thomas Goppel, later served amongst others as Minister of Science, Research and the Arts (2003–2008).

The &quot;Alfons-Goppel-Stiftung&quot; (&quot;Alfons Goppel Foundation&quot;), formed in 1980 and named after him, supports needy children in third-world countries.

==Honors==
* Honorary doctorate of the University of Würzburg and the St. John&#x27;s University Minnesota.

<text>The Sun River (also called the Medicine River) is a tributary of the Missouri River in the Great Plains, approximately 130 mi (209 km) long, in Montana in the United States.

==Geography==

It rises in the Rocky Mountains in two forks, the North Fork and South Fork, which join in the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest above Gibson Reservoir along the county line between Teton and Lewis and Clark counties. It flows E, SE, and E away from the mountains, past Simms, Sun River, and Vaughn and joins the Missouri at Great Falls.

The water of the river is used extensively for irrigation, through the Sun River Project of the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The irrigation area covers approximately 92,000 acres (372 km2).

The North Fork of the Sun River begins high up in the Bob Marshall Wilderness and flows generally Southward for about until it meets up with the South Fork of the Sun River. Almost immediately the two forks flow into Gibson Reservoir, impounded by Gibson Dam. From when the water leaves the reservoir until it meets the Missouri River in Great Falls, the flowage is known as the Sun River.

The Sun is a Class I river from Gibson Dam to its confluence with the Missouri River for public access for recreational purposes.

==History==
A sign located 3 miles south of Great Falls gives information on the history of the Sun River:
This river was called &quot;The Medicine&quot; by the Indians. On the return trip from the coast Capt. Lewis of the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition struck this river approximately 50 miles west of here. He followed it down to the Missouri passing near this point July 11, 1806. In his journal under that date he said:
&quot;when I arrived in sight of the white-bear Islands the missouri bottoms on both sides of the river were crowded with buffaloe I sincerely believe that there were not less than 10 thousand buffaloe within a circle of 2 miles around that place&quot;

The City of Great Falls covers a portion of the plain across which the Expedition made their difficult 18 mile portage around the falls of the Missouri in June 1805

<text>The Bavarian State Opera () is a German opera company based in Munich. Its main venue is the Nationaltheater München, and its orchestra the Bavarian State Orchestra. 

== History==

The parent ensemble of the company was founded in 1653, under Electress consort Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy, when Giovanni Battista Maccioni&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;arpa festante&quot; was performed in the court theatre. In 1753, the Residence Theatre (Cuvilliés Theatre) was opened as a major stage. While opera performances were also held in the Prinzregententheater (completed in 1901), the company&#x27;s home base is the Nationaltheater München on Max-Joseph-Platz.

In 1875, the Munich Opera Festival took place for the first time. Sir Peter Jonas became the general manager in 1993, the first British general manager of any major German-speaking opera house. In 2008, Nikolaus Bachler became Intendant (general manager) of the opera company, and Kirill Petrenko became Generalmusikdirektor (GMD) in 2013. In 2014, the Bavarian State Opera received the &quot;Opernhaus des Jahres&quot; (opera house of the year) award from &quot;Opernwelt&quot; magazine. In October 2015, the company announced the extensions of the contracts of Bachler and of Petrenko through August 2021. Both Bachler and Petrenko stood down from their respective posts at the close of the 2020–2021 season.

In March 2018, the company announced the appointments of as its next general manager, and of Vladimir Jurowski as its next GMD, both effective with the 2021–2022 season. In June 2024, the company announced the extension of Dorny&#x27;s contract as &quot;Intendant&quot; through 2031, and of Jurowski&#x27;s contract as GMD through the close of the 2027-2028 season, at which time Jurowski is expected to stand down as GMD.

The company received the &quot;Opera Company of the Year&quot; award at the 2018 and 2023 International Opera Awards.

<doc id="532939" wikidata="Q4828346" url="?curid=532939" title="Averse Sefira">
<text>Averse Sefira was a black metal band from Austin, Texas.

== Biography ==
Averse Sefira was formed in 1996 by guitarist and vocalist Sanguine Mapsama and bassist Wrath Sathariel Diabolus. Their demo, &quot;Blasphomet Sin Abset&quot;, was released later that year. It featured a drum machine in lieu of a live drummer. Three years later, in 1999, their first full-length album, which was entitled &quot;Homecomings March&quot;, was released on Arrogare Records, their own label which was created specifically for the purpose of releasing that album. Again, the band had to make use of a drum machine instead of a real drummer. A remastered version of the album was released in 2003, with the interludes as separate tracks.

2001 had the band releasing a second album, &quot;Battle&#x27;s Clarion&quot;. For this album, the band, for the first time, had a live drummer, The Carcass, who was previously a member of Texas death metal band Death of Millions, and was, at one point, a touring drummer for Incantation. The music on this album took on a profound death metal influence, at times reminiscent of early Deicide or Morbid Angel, but was still easily identifiable as black metal.

After &quot;Battle&#x27;s Clarion&quot;, the band toured internationally for a few years intermittently, both with well-known bands such as Dark Funeral and underground acts such as 
Antaeus and Watain. The band quickly gained a reputation for putting on a fierce live show and gained followings in Europe and South America, particularly in Brazil.

Four years after &quot;Battle&#x27;s Clarion&quot;, in 2005, the band returned to the studio to record their third full-length album, &quot;Tetragrammatical Astygmata&quot;. For the first time, the band had a powerful production, provided by Necromorbus Studio. This album saw the band continuing both in the more sonorous direction employed on &quot;Homecomings March&quot; and the chaotic direction first seen on &quot;Battle&#x27;s Clarion&quot;. A newly found sense of harmonics, similar to Immortal&#x27;s &quot;Pure Holocaust&quot;, aided in the creation of the band&#x27;s sound as well as connecting it to the contemplative moments. Interludes on this album were more limited than on any prior work, occasionally making a brief appearance to connect two songs.

&quot;Advent Parallax&quot; was issued on February 25 by Candlelight Records. And again it was produced by Tore Stjerna (Necromorbus).

In a blog post on May 3, 2012 Averse Sefira announced the band had come to an end. &quot;It is over. The entity Averse Sefira has fractured back into its earthly parts, never to take wing again.&quot;

== Musical style and ideology ==
The band&#x27;s early music was &quot;stylistically most like early Mayhem and Gorgoroth&quot;. Around &quot;Battle&#x27;s Clarion&quot;, they &quot;explored a more death-oriented sound, and helped mold the style of the Texas outfit into something a bit more developed&quot;. On &quot;Advent Parallax&quot;, Averse Sefira &quot;provide raw, scorching, bludgeoning black metal&quot; with &quot;hints of death metal on occasion, but black metal is the main ingredient -- and that means sinister-sounding rasp vocals […], thunderous blastbeats, and an ambience of total doom. One of the things that makes Advent Parallax effective is the fact that you can actually understand the lyrics that are coming out of Mapsama&#x27;s mouth. So many black metal and death metal vocalists are difficult to understand, but Mapsama is quite understandable on pummeling tracks such as &#x27;Viral Kinesis,&#x27; &#x27;Serpent Recoil,&#x27; &#x27;Cognition of Rebirth,&#x27; and &#x27;Seance in a Warrior&#x27;s Memory.&#x27; All things considered, this early-2008 release is a respectable, noteworthy example of an American band with a very Scandinavian-influenced sound&quot; wrote Alex Henderson for AllMusic.

Sanguine has stated that as a Satanist, he finds it &quot;somewhat insulting to see bands who write lyrics where every other word is &#x27;SATAN!&#x27;&quot;, and Wrath Sathariel Diabolus disassociated himself from US death metal bands believing themselves to be black metallers because they use corpse paint and scream &quot;Satan&quot;, pointing out that behind black metal, there is an idea first and not just strongly distorted guitars. Wrath named John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; as a &quot;great piece of literature&quot; he gets inspiration from. He is also inspired by some magical, &quot;particularly ones dealing with Enochian magick&quot;, and the Old Testament, &quot;only because it portrays god and the angels as destructive and terrifying. I like that.&quot; Sanguine is inspired by the works of Arthur Edward Waite, William Blake and Charles Baudelaire. Referring to the 1990s NSBM trend, Wrath pointed out that Averse Sefira never had any link with Nazism; and Sanguine sees &quot;it as somewhat contradictory that people are linking national-socialism and satanism together, although it seems that most of the NS bands are dumping their Satanic roots. Adopting National-Socialism seems like a last ditch shock tactic.&quot;

<text>Pinus ponderosa, commonly known as the ponderosa pine, bull pine, blackjack pine, western yellow-pine, or filipinus pine, is a very large pine tree species of variable habitat native to mountainous regions of western North America. It is the most widely distributed pine species in North America.

&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; grows in various erect forms from British Columbia southward and eastward through 16 western U.S. states and has been introduced in temperate regions of Europe and in New Zealand. It was first documented in modern science in 1826 in eastern Washington near present-day Spokane (of which it is the official city tree). On that occasion, David Douglas misidentified it as &quot;Pinus resinosa&quot; (red pine). In 1829, Douglas concluded that he had a new pine among his specimens and coined the name &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; for its heavy wood. In 1836, it was formally named and described by Charles Lawson, a Scottish nurseryman. It was adopted as the official state tree of Montana in 1949.

== Description ==
&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; is a large coniferous pine (evergreen) tree. The bark helps distinguish it from other species. Mature to overmature individuals have yellow to orange-red bark in broad to very broad plates with black crevices. Younger trees have blackish-brown bark, referred to as &quot;blackjacks&quot; by early loggers. Ponderosa pine&#x27;s five subspecies, as classified by some botanists, can be identified by their characteristically bright-green needles (contrasting with blue-green needles that distinguish Jeffrey pine). The Pacific subspecies has the longest——and most flexible needles in plume-like fascicles of three. The Columbia ponderosa pine has long——and relatively flexible needles in fascicles of three. The Rocky Mountains subspecies has shorter——and stout needles growing in scopulate (bushy, tuft-like) fascicles of two or three. The southwestern subspecies has , stout needles in fascicles of three (averaging ). The central High Plains subspecies is characterized by the fewest needles (1.4 per whorl, on average); stout, upright branches at narrow angles from the trunk; and long green needles——extending farthest along the branch, resembling a fox tail. Needles are widest, stoutest, and fewest (averaging ) for the species.

The egg-shaped cones, which are often found in great number under trees, are long. They are purple when first chewed off by squirrels, but become more brown and spherical as they dry. Each scale has a sharp point.

Sources differ on the scent of &quot;P. ponderosa&quot;. Some state that the bark smells of turpentine, which could reflect the dominance of terpenes (alpha- and beta-pinenes, as well as delta-3-carene). Others state that it has no distinctive scent, while still others state that the bark smells like vanilla if sampled from a furrow. Sources agree that the Jeffrey pine is more strongly scented than the ponderosa pine. When carved into, pitch-filled stumps emit a scent of fresh pitch.

=== Size ===
The National Register of Big Trees lists a ponderosa pine that is tall and in circumference. In January 2011, a Pacific ponderosa pine in the Rogue River–Siskiyou National Forest in Oregon was measured with a laser to be high. The measurement was performed by Michael Taylor and Mario Vaden, a professional arborist from Oregon. The tree was climbed on October 13, 2011, by Ascending The Giants (a tree-climbing company in Portland, Oregon) and directly measured with tape-line at high. As of 2015, a &quot;Pinus lambertiana&quot; specimen was measured at , which surpassed the ponderosa pine previously considered the world&#x27;s tallest pine tree.

== Taxonomy ==
Modern forestry research has identified five different taxa of &quot;P. ponderosa&quot;, with differing botanical characters and adaptations to different climatic conditions. Four of these have been termed &quot;geographic races&quot; in forestry literature. Some botanists historically treated some races as distinct species. In modern botanical usage, they best match the rank of subspecies and have been formally published.

=== Subspecies and varieties ===
* &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; subsp. &quot;brachyptera&quot; Engelm. – southwestern ponderosa pine
:: Four corners transition zone, including southern Colorado, southern Utah, northern and central New Mexico and Arizona, westernmost Texas, and a single disjunct population in the far northwestern Oklahoma panhandle. The Gila Wilderness contains one of the world&#x27;s largest and healthiest forests. Hot with bimodal monsoonal rainfall; wet winters and summers contrast with dry springs and falls; mild winters.
* &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; subsp. &quot;critchfieldiana&quot; Robert Z. Callaham subsp. &quot;novo&quot; – Pacific ponderosa pine
:: Western coastal parts of Washington State; Oregon west of the Cascade Range except for the southward-extending Umpqua–Tahoe Transition Zone; California except for both that transition zone and the Transverse-Tehahchapi Mountains Transition zone in southern California and Critchfield&#x27;s far Southern California Race. Mediterranean hot, dry summers in California; mild wet winters with heavy snow in mountains.
* &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; var. &quot;pacifica&quot; J.R. Haller &amp; Vivrette – Pacific ponderosa pine
:: on coastal-draining slopes of major mountain ranges in California, and in southwestern Oregon, Washington.
* &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; subsp. &quot;ponderosa&quot; Douglas ex C. Lawson – Columbia ponderosa pine, North plateau ponderosa pine
:: Southeast British Columbia, eastern Washington State and Oregon east of the Cascade Range, in northeastern California, northwestern Nevada, Idaho and west of the Helena, Montana, transition zone. Cool, relatively moist summers; very cold, snowy winters (except in the very hot and very dry summers of central Oregon, most notably near Bend, which also has very cold and generally dry winters).
* &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; subsp. &quot;readiana&quot; Robert Z. Callaham subsp. novo – central High Plains ponderosa pine
:: Southern South Dakota and adjacent northern Nebraska and far eastern Colorado, but neither the northern and southern High Plains nor the Black Hills, which are in &quot;P. p. scopulorum&quot;. Hot, dry, very windy summers; continental cold, wet winters.
* &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; var. &quot;scopulorum&quot; (Engelm. in S.Watson) E. Murray, Kalmia 12:23, 1982 – Rocky Mountains ponderosa pine
:: East of the Helena, Montana, transition zone, North &amp; South Dakota, but not the central high plains, Wyoming, Nebraska, northern and central Colorado and Utah, and eastern Nevada. Warm, relatively dry summers; very cold, fairly dry winters.
* &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; var. &quot;washoensis&quot; (H. Mason &amp; Stockw.) J.R. Haller &amp; Vivrette – Washoe pine
:: Predominantly in northeastern California, and into Nevada and Oregon, at , upper mixed-conifer to lower subalpine habitats.

Distributions of the subspecies in the United States are shown in shadow on the map. Distribution of ponderosa pine is from Critchfield and Little. The closely related five-needled Arizona pine (&quot;Pinus arizonica&quot;) extends southward into Mexico.

Before the distinctions between the North Plateau and Pacific races were fully documented, most botanists assumed that ponderosa pines in both areas were the same. In 1948, when a botanist and a geneticist from California found a distinct tree on Mt. Rose in western Nevada with some marked differences from the ponderosa pine they knew in California, they described it as a new species, Washoe pine &quot;Pinus washoensis&quot;. Subsequent research determined this to be one of the southernmost outliers of the typical North Plateau race of ponderosa pine. Its current classification is &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; var. &quot;washoensis&quot;.

An additional variety, tentatively named &quot;P. p.&quot; var. &quot;willamettensis&quot;, found in the Willamette Valley in western Oregon, is rare. This is likely just one of the many islands of Pacific subspecies of ponderosa pine occurring in the Willamette Valley and extending north to the southeast end of Puget Sound in Washington.

=== Distinguishing subspecies ===
The subspecies of &quot;P. ponderosa&quot; can be distinguished by measurements along several dimensions:

== Distribution ==

&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; is a dominant tree in the Kuchler plant association, the ponderosa shrub forest. Like most western pines, the ponderosa is generally associated with mountainous topography. However, it is found on banks of the Niobrara River in Nebraska. Scattered stands occur in the Willamette Valley of Oregon and in the Okanagan Valley and Puget Sound areas of Washington. Stands occur throughout low level valleys in British Columbia reaching as far north as the Thompson, Fraser and Columbia watersheds. In its Northern limits, it only grows below elevation, but is most common below . Ponderosa covers , or 80%, of the Black Hills of South Dakota. It is found on foothills and mid-height peaks of the northern, central, and southern Rocky Mountains, in the Cascade Range, in the Sierra Nevada, and in the maritime-influenced Coast Range. In Arizona, it predominates on the Mogollon Rim and is scattered on the Mogollon Plateau and on mid-height peaks () in Arizona and New Mexico. Arizona pine (&quot;P. arizonica&quot;), found primarily in the mountains of extreme southwestern New Mexico, southeastern Arizona, and northern Mexico and sometimes classified as a variety of ponderosa pine, is presently recognized as a separate species. Ponderosa pine are also found in the Chisos, Davis, and Guadalupe Mountains of Texas, at elevations between .

== Ecology ==
The fire cycle for ponderosa pine is 5 to 10 years, in which a natural ignition sparks a low-intensity fire. Low, once-a-decade fires are known to have helped specimens live for half a millennium or more. The tree has thick bark, and its buds are protected by needles, allowing even some younger individuals to survive weaker fires. In addition to being adapted to dry, fire-affected areas, the species often appears on the edges of deserts as it is comparatively drought resistant, partly due to the ability to close its leaf pores. It can also draw some of its water from sandy soils. Despite being relatively widespread in the American West, it is intolerant of shade.

&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; needles are the only known food of the caterpillars of the gelechiid moth &quot;Chionodes retiniella&quot;. Blue stain fungus, &quot;Grosmannia clavigera&quot;, is introduced in sapwood of &quot;P. ponderosa&quot; from the galleries of all species in the genus &quot;Dendroctonus&quot; (mountain pine beetle), which has caused much damage. Western pine and other beetles can be found consuming the bark. The seeds are eaten by squirrels, chipmunks, quail, grouse, and Clark&#x27;s nutcracker, while mule deer browse the seedlings. American black bears can climb up to 12 feet up a ponderosa.

Various animals nest in the ponderosa pines, such as the piliated woodpecker.

=== Pathology ===
&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; is affected by &quot;Armillaria&quot;, &quot;Phaeolus schweinitzii&quot;, &quot;Fomes pini&quot;, &quot;Atropellis canker&quot;, dwarf mistletoe, &quot;Polyporus anceps&quot;, &quot;Verticicladiella&quot;, &quot;Elytroderma&quot; needle cast, and western gall rust.

=== As an invasive species ===
&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; is classed as a &quot;wilding pine&quot; and spreads as an invasive species throughout the high country of New Zealand, where it is beginning to take over, causing the native species of plants not to be able to grow in those locations. It is also considered a &quot;weed&quot; in parts of Australia.

== Uses ==
Native Americans consumed the seeds and sweet inner bark. They chewed the dried pitch, which was also used as a salve. They used the limbs and branches as firewood and building material, and the trunks were carved into canoes. The needles and roots were made into baskets. The needles were also boiled into a solution to treat coughs and fevers.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, old-growth trees were widely used by settlers as lumber, including for railroads. Younger trees are of poor quality for lumber due to the tendency to warp.

=== Cultivation ===

Cultivated as a bonsai, ponderosas are prized for their rough, flaky bark, contorted trunks, flexible limbs, and dramatic deadwood. Collected specimens can be wildly sculpted by their environment, resulting in beautiful twisted trunks, limbs and deadwood. In the mountains they can be found growing in pockets in the rock, stunting their growth. The main challenge for this species in bonsai cultivation is the natural long length of its needles, which takes years of training and care to reduce.

This species is grown as an ornamental plant in parks and large gardens.

=== In nuclear testing ===
During Operation Upshot–Knothole in 1953, a nuclear test was performed in which 145 ponderosa pines were cut down by the United States Forest Service and transported to Area 5 of the Nevada Test Site, where they were planted into the ground and exposed to a nuclear blast to see what the blast wave would do to a forest. The trees were partially burned and blown over.

== Culture ==
Pinus ponderosa is the official state tree of Montana. In a 1908 poll to determine the state tree, Montana schoolchildren chose the tree over the Douglas fir, American larch, and cottonwood. However, the tree was not officially named the state tree until 1949.

<text>Zazpiak Bat is a heraldic nickname for the Basque coat of arms which includes the arms of the seven Basque provinces, stressing their unity. It was designed by the historian Jean de Jaurgain in 1897 for the &quot;Congrès et Fêtes de la Tradition basque&quot; celebrated at Saint-Jean-de-Luz.

==Name==
&quot;Zazpiak Bat&quot; is a motto attributed to Basque explorer Antoine-Thomson d&#x27;Abbadie in the late nineteenth century, from the Basque words &quot;zazpiak&quot; meaning &#x27;the seven&#x27; and &quot;bat&quot; meaning &#x27;one&#x27;, translates as &quot;the seven [are] one&quot; and refers to the seven Basque Country traditional provinces. However, it was first cited in 1836 by a friend and collaborator of Antoine d&#x27;Abbadie&#x27;s, the Souletin Agosti Xaho (&quot;Etudes grammaticales sur la langue euskarienne&quot;, dedicated to the &quot;Zazpirak Bat&quot;). The motto is based on a similar one fashioned by the Enlightenment society Real Sociedad Bascongada de Amigos del País in 1765, &quot;Irurac bat&quot;, &#x27;the three [are] one&#x27;, after the provinces currently making up the Basque Autonomous Community), while a like variant was created too in the 19th century known as &quot;Laurak bat&quot; (&#x27;the four [are] one&#x27;, after the four Basque peninsular provinces), a motto quoted and celebrated by the Provincial Government of Navarre in 1866.

==History==
The original Zazpiak Bat features a design of traditional arms of the Basque territories, namely Araba, Gipuzkoa, and Bizkaia (which form the Basque Autonomous Community) plus Nafarroa; and the three that are part of the Pyrénées Atlantiques department (Lapurdi, Zuberoa and Baxe-Nafarroa). The coat of arms of the third traditional province, Lower Navarre is subsumed under the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Navarre, therefore represented by the latter. The modern design is based on the current simplified heraldry of these territories. 

===Laurak Bat===

&quot;Laurak Bat&quot;, with the four Basque provinces of peninsular soil, was adopted as the coat of arms of the Basque autonomous community. The red background of the Navarrese insignia currently occupies the fourth quarter of the coat of arms of the Basque Country.

<text>Felix Hoffmann (21 January 1868 – 8 February 1946) was a German chemist notable for re-synthesising diamorphine (independently from C.R. Alder Wright who synthesized it 23 years earlier), which was popularized under the Bayer trade name of &quot;heroin&quot;. He is also credited with synthesizing aspirin, though whether he did this under his own initiative or under the instruction of Arthur Eichengrün is contested.

==Career==
Felix Hoffmann was born on 21 January 1868 in Ludwigsburg, Germany, the son of an industrialist. In 1889, he started studying chemistry at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich to study pharmacy and ended it in 1890 with the pharmaceutical state exam. In 1891 he graduated magna cum laude from the University of Munich. Two years later he earned his doctorate, also magna cum laude, after completing his thesis titled &quot;On certain derivatives of dihydroanthracene&quot;. In 1894, he joined Bayer as a research chemist.

On 10 August 1897 Hoffmann synthesized acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) while working at Bayer under Arthur Eichengrün. By combining salicylic acid with acetic acid, he succeeded in creating ASA in a chemically pure and stable form. The pharmacologist responsible for verifying these results was skeptical at first, yet once several large-scale studies to investigate the substance&#x27;s efficacy and tolerability had been completed, it was found to be an analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory substance. The company then worked to develop a cost-effective production process that would facilitate the promising active ingredient to be supplied as a pharmaceutical product. In 1899 it was marketed for the first time under the trade name &quot;Aspirin&quot;, initially as a powder supplied in glass bottles.

He also synthesized diamorphine (heroin), previously achieved by Charles Romley Alder Wright by acetylating different molecules. It was named Heroin due to its &quot;heroic&quot; nature since it was used to medicate a variety of medical illnesses from child coughs to war injuries. It was also used to cure morphine addicts and would result in worse addictions and increasing tolerance levels to the drug over time.

Following the synthesis of aspirin and heroin, Hoffmann moved to the pharmaceutical marketing department where he stayed until his retirement in 1928.

Hoffman was never married and died on 8 February 1946 in Switzerland. He had no known children.

== Aspirin invention controversy ==

Hoffmann first claimed to be the &quot;inventor&quot; of aspirin (as opposed to just the synthesizer) in a footnote to a German encyclopedia published in 1934, saying that his father had complained about the bitter taste of sodium salicylate, the only drug then available to treat rheumatism. The large doses (6–8 grams) of sodium salicylate that were used to treat arthritis commonly irritated the stomach lining and caused patients considerable pain and irritation. He claimed that he began looking for a less acidic formation which led him to synthesize acetylsalicylic acid, a compound that shared the therapeutic properties of other salicylates but not the strong acidity that he believed caused stomach irritations.

An alternative credit for developing aspirin has also been offered. In 1949, ex-Bayer employee Arthur Eichengrün published a paper in &quot;Pharmazie&quot;, in which he claimed to have planned and directed Hoffman&#x27;s synthesis of aspirin along with the synthesis of several related compounds. He also claimed to be responsible for aspirin&#x27;s initial surreptitious clinical testing. Finally, he claimed that Hoffmann&#x27;s role was restricted to the initial lab synthesis using his (Eichengrün&#x27;s) process and nothing more. Eichengrün died the same month he published in &quot;Pharmazie.&quot;

The Eichengrün version was ignored by historians and chemists until 1999, when Walter Sneader of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow re-examined the case and came to the conclusion that indeed Eichengrün&#x27;s account was convincing and correct and that Eichengrün deserved credit for the invention of aspirin. Bayer denied this in a press release, asserting that the invention of aspirin was due to Hoffmann.

==Legacy==
In 2002, he was inducted into the US National Inventors Hall of Fame.

<text>Max Streibl (6 January 1932 – 11 December 1998) was a German politician of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party and the eighth Minister President of Bavaria.

==Biography==

Streibel was born in Oberammergau in 1932, where his parents owned a hotel business. He married his wife Irmingard in 1960 and they had one daughter and two sons.

After going to school in Ettal, he studied law in Munich, graduating in 1955. He worked in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and later, at the German &quot;Bundesrat&quot; in Bonn and joint the local government of the region of Upper Bavaria in 1960. From 1961, he worked for the state government and began to rise in the ranks of the CSU. From 1961 to 1967, he led the &quot;Junge Union (Young Union), the youth organisation of CDU and CSU in Bavaria.&quot; 

He became a member of the Bavarian &quot;Landtag&quot; in 1962, a position he held until 1994, when he retired. He was then the General Secretary of the party from 1967 to 1970.

Streibl served as Bavarian Minister for the Environment (1970–1977), a newly formed ministry, and for Finance (1977–1988).
After the sudden death of Franz Josef Strauß in 1988, Streibl succeeded him as &quot;Ministerpräsident&quot; of Bavaria on 19 October 1988. 
Streibl was deeply rooted in Catholicism, but soon became unpopular because of alleged bribery (he was paid holiday trips by Burkhart Grob, the chairman of an aircraft production company). Because of this so-called &quot;amigo-affair&quot;, coming to the surface in January 1993, he was forced to resign on 27 May 1993 and Edmund Stoiber took office, despite the latter being involved in the affair, too. The affair did result in a policy change in Bavaria, aimed at untangling the connections between politics and business. 

Streibl&#x27;s defiant final words upon his resignation, with a tear in his eyes, were &quot;Adios Amigos!&quot;.

He retired from politics shortly after and died in December 1998 in Munich.

==Honors==
* Honorary Doctorates from the Universities of Passau (1985) and Munich (1990).
* Grand Cross of Merit of the Italian Republic (1988)
* Honorary Citizen of Oberammergau (1989)
* Grand Cross of the Order Pro Merito Melitensi of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta
* Order of the Holy Sepulchre
*Grand Order of King Dmitar Zvonimir, Croatia
