<text>Regnecentralen (RC) was the first Danish computer company, founded on 12 October 1955. Through the 1950s and 1960s, they designed a series of computers, originally for their own use, and later to be sold commercially. Descendants of these systems sold well into the 1980s. They also developed a series of high-speed paper tape machines, and produced Data General Nova machines under license.

==Genesis==

What would become RC began as an advisory board formed by the Danish &quot;Akademiet for de Tekniske Videnskaber&quot; (&quot;Academy of Applied Sciences&quot;) to keep abreast of developments in modern electronic computing devices taking place in other countries. It was originally named Regnecentralen, Dansk Institut for Matematikmaskiner (&quot;Danish Institute of Computing Machinery &quot;) After several years in the advisory role, in 1952 they decided to form a computing service bureau for Danish government, military and research uses. Led by Niels Ivar Bech, the group was also given the details of the BESK machine being designed at the Swedish Mathematical Center (Matematikmaskinnämndens Arbetsgrupp).

The group decided to build their own version of the BESK to run the bureau, and formed Regnecentralen in October 1955 to complete and run the machine. The result was the DASK, a vacuum tube-based machine that completed construction in 1956 and went into full operation in February 1957. DASK was followed in 1961 by the fully transistorized GIER, used for similar tasks. GIER is an acronym for &quot;Geodætisk Instituts Elektroniske Regnemaskine&quot; (Institute of Geodetics Electronic Calculator) and was introduced there on 14 September 1961. GIER proved to be a useful machine, and went on to be used at many Danish universities. Bech also sold GIER machines to the Eastern Bloc nations, starting with Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria, and later Romania, the East Germany, and Yugoslavia.

RC was also home to Peter Naur, and DASK and GIER became well known for their role in the development of the famous programming language ALGOL. After the first European ALGOL conference in 1959, RC began an effort to produce a series of compilers, completing one for the DASK in September 1961. A version for the GIER followed in August 1962. Christian Andersen and Peter Schyum Poulsen, another RC employee, wrote the first introductory text on the language, &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Desk ALGOL&quot;, in 1961.

==Peripheral business==

To support higher throughput at their own service bureau, RC developed several high-speed input/output devices. One of their most popular was the RC 2000 paper tape reader, introduced in 1963. Feeding the tape at 5 meters per second, the 2000 could read 2,000 characters per second (CPS), storing the results in a buffer while the computer periodically read the data back out instead of stopping the tape to wait for the computer to get ready. The machine was later upgraded as the RC 2500, increasing speed to almost 7 meters a second, improving read speed to 2500 CPS. The RC 2000/2500 became a major product for RC during the 1960s, selling 1,500 examples around the world. Several related devices were added to the line, including a high-speed punch and a dedicated data conversion machine that would &quot;massage&quot; data between formats to ease the burden on the host computer.

In 1964 Regnecentralen was taken public. Most of the firm&#x27;s shares were held by its biggest customers.

==New computers==

In the mid-1960s, RC began the design of a small integrated circuit-based computer system for industrial control and automation needs, initially to fill a request by a Danish company to automate a chemical factory they were building in Poland. The RC 4000 design emerged in 1966 and was completed for the factory the next year. When combined with appropriate peripherals, almost always including an RC 2000 along with several rebranded devices from other companies, the RC 4000 was a highly reliable minicomputer, and went on to be sold across Europe. The RC 8000 from the mid-1970s used newer-generation integrated circuits (ICs) to shrink the RC 4000 into a single rack-mount system. The last in the series, the RC 9000, further shrunk the machine and improved performance to about 4 MIPS, and was sold in versions that could run either RC 8000 programs, or Unix.

The RC 4000 is famous for its operating system, developed by Per Brinch Hansen. Known as the RC 4000 multiprogramming system, it is the first real-world example of a system using a very simple kernel along with a variety of user-selected programs that built up the system as a whole. Today this concept is known as a microkernel, and efforts to correct for microkernels&#x27; poor performance formed the basis of most OS research through the 1970s and 1980s. Brinch Hansen also worked with Charles Simonyi and Peter Kraft on the RC 4000&#x27;s Real-time Control System.

RC also began selling the Data General Nova under license in 1970 as the RC 7000, later introducing their own updated version as the RC 3600 the next year. This series filled a niche similar to the RC 4000, but for much smaller installations. The RC 3600 became a fixture of many Danish schools and universities.

During the 1980s, RC produced the RC700 Piccolo, the RC750 Partner, and the RC759 Piccoline systems, which were sold to Danish schools mostly, and to some businesses in Denmark and abroad. The Piccolo was powered by the Zilog Z80A CPU, while the Piccoline was powered by the Intel 80186 processor.

In 1988, International Computers Limited (ICL) acquired a 50% stake in Regnecentralen, then trading as RC Computer, with the intention of merging the business into ICL Denmark. However, the business persisted as a distinct operational entity under the RC International name.

<text>Peter Joshua Sculthorpe (29 April 1929 – 8 August 2014) was an Australian composer. Much of his music resulted from an interest in the music of countries neighbouring Australia as well as from the impulse to bring together aspects of Aboriginal Australian music with that of the heritage of the West. He was known primarily for his orchestral and chamber music, such as &quot;Kakadu&quot; (1988) and &quot;Earth Cry&quot; (1986), which evoke the sounds and feeling of the Australian bushland and outback. He also wrote 18 string quartets, using unusual timbral effects, works for piano, and two operas. He stated that he wanted his music to make people feel better and happier for having listened to it. He typically avoided the dense, atonal techniques of many of his contemporary composers. His work was often characterised by its distinctive use of percussion. As one of the compositional pioneers of a distinctively Australian sound, Sculthorpe and his music have been likened to the role played by Aaron Copland in America&#x27;s musical coming of age.

==Early life==
Sculthorpe was born and raised in Launceston, Tasmania. His mother, Edna, was passionate about English literature and was the first woman to hold a driver&#x27;s licence in Tasmania; his father, Joshua, loved fishing and nature. He was educated at the Launceston Church Grammar School.

He began writing music at the age of seven or eight, after having his first piano lesson, continuing in secret when his piano teacher punished him for this activity. By the age of 14, he had decided to make a career of music, despite many (especially his father) encouraging him to enter different fields, because he felt the music he wrote was the only thing that was his own. In his early teens he attempted to learn composition through studying Ernst Krenek&#x27;s &quot;Studies in Counterpoint&quot; – &quot;a pretty dreadful book&quot; as he later described it. He studied at the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music from 1946 to 1950, then returned to Tasmania.

His &quot;Piano Sonatina&quot; was performed at the ISCM Festival in Baden-Baden in 1955 (the piece had been rejected for an ABC competition because it was &quot;too modern&quot;).

He won a scholarship to study at Wadham College, Oxford, studying under Egon Wellesz. Through Wellesz he met Wilfrid Mellers, whose wide literary interests included many Australian writers, and who recommended Sculthorpe read D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Kangaroo&quot;. This led directly to the composition of &quot;Irkanda II&quot; (String Quartet No. 5). His song-cycle &quot;Sun&quot;, based on three Lawrence poems, was dedicated to Mellers. These works were later withdrawn, but Lawrence&#x27;s words returned in a revised version of &quot;Irkanda IV&quot; and in &quot;The Fifth Continent&quot;. He left Wadham before completing his doctorate because his father was gravely ill. He wrote his first mature composition, &quot;Irkanda IV&quot;, in his father&#x27;s memory.

Shortly afterwards, he made the acquaintance of the painter Russell Drysdale, who had recently lost his son to suicide, and the pair shared a working holiday in a house on the Tamar River. Not long after this, Drysdale&#x27;s wife Bonnie, who had introduced him to Sculthorpe, also took her own life. His String Quartet No. 6 was dedicated to Bonnie Drysdale&#x27;s memory. His Piano Sonata (later withdrawn and re-released under the title &quot;Callabonna&quot;) was dedicated to Russell Drysdale, who used Lake Callabonna in South Australia as the backdrop to some of his paintings.

==Musical career==
In 1963 he became a lecturer at the University of Sydney, and remained there more or less ever after, where he was an emeritus professor. In the mid-1960s he was composer in residence at Yale University. In 1965 he wrote &quot;Sun Music I&quot; for the Sydney Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s first overseas tour, on a commission from Sir Bernard Heinze, who asked for &quot;something without rhythm, harmony or melody&quot;. Neville Cardus, after the premiere of &quot;Sun Music I&quot;, wrote that Sculthorpe was set to &quot;lay the foundations of an original and characteristic Australian music&quot;. In 1968 the &quot;Sun Music&quot; series was used for the ballet &quot;Sun Music&quot;, choreographed by Sir Robert Helpmann, which gained wide international attention. In the late 1960s, Sculthorpe worked with Patrick White on an opera about Eliza Fraser, but White chose to terminate the artistic relationship. Sculthorpe subsequently wrote an opera (music theatre), &quot;Rites of Passage&quot; (1972–73), to his own libretto, using texts in Latin and the Australian indigenous language Arrernte. Another opera &quot;Quiros&quot; followed in 1982.

In 2003, the SBS Radio and Television Youth Orchestra gave the premiere of &quot;Sydney Singing&quot;, a composition by Sculthorpe for clarinet solo (Joanne Sharp), harp solo (Tamara Spigelman), percussion solo (Peter Hayward) and string orchestra.

Sculthorpe was a represented composer of the Australian Music Centre and was published by Faber Music Ltd. He was only the second composer to be contracted by Faber, after Benjamin Britten.

==Style and themes==
Much of Sculthorpe&#x27;s early work demonstrates the influence of Asian music, but he said that these influences dwindled through the 1970s as Indigenous Australian music became more important. He said that he had been interested in indigenous cultures since his teens, mainly because of his father &quot;who told me many stories of past wrongs in Tasmania. I think he was quite extraordinary for that time, as was my mother&quot;. However, it was only with the advent of recordings and books on the subject around the 1970s that he started to incorporate indigenous motifs in his work.

Sculthorpe said he was political in his work – and that his work had also always been about &quot;the preservation of the environment and more recently, climate change&quot;. His 16th String Quartet was inspired by extracts from letters written by asylum seekers in Australian detention centres.

Sculthorpe came to regard Russell &quot;Tass&quot; Drysdale as a role model, admiring the way he reworked familiar material in new ways. He said &quot;In later years he was often accused of painting the same picture over and over again. But his answer was that he was no different from a Renaissance artist, striving again and again to paint the perfect Madonna-and-Child. Since then, I&#x27;ve never had a problem about the idea of reusing and reworking my material. Like Tass, I&#x27;ve come to look on my whole output as one slowly emerging work&quot;.

==Personal life==
In the early 1970s Sculthorpe was engaged to the Australian composer and music educator, Anne Boyd.

He was distantly related to Fanny Cochrane Smith, a Tasmanian Aboriginal woman whose wax cylinder recordings of songs are the only audio recordings of any of Tasmania&#x27;s Indigenous languages. Her daughter Gladys married Sculthorpe&#x27;s great-grandfather&#x27;s nephew.

<doc id="519271" wikidata="Q1671724" url="?curid=519271" title="Inverse iteration">
<text>In numerical analysis, inverse iteration (also known as the &quot;inverse power method&quot;) is an iterative eigenvalue algorithm. It allows one to find an approximate
eigenvector when an approximation to a corresponding eigenvalue is already known.
The method is conceptually similar to the power method.
It appears to have originally been developed to compute resonance frequencies in the field of structural mechanics.

The inverse power iteration algorithm starts with an approximation formula_1 for the eigenvalue corresponding to the desired eigenvector and a vector formula_2, either a randomly selected vector or an approximation to the eigenvector. The method is described by the iteration

formula_3

where formula_4 are some constants usually chosen as formula_5 Since eigenvectors are defined up to multiplication by constant, the choice of formula_4 can be arbitrary in theory; practical aspects of the choice of formula_4 are discussed below.

At every iteration, the vector formula_8 is multiplied by the matrix formula_9 and normalized.
It is exactly the same formula as in the power method, except replacing the matrix formula_10 by formula_11
The closer the approximation formula_1 to the eigenvalue is chosen, the faster the algorithm converges; however, incorrect choice of formula_1 can lead to slow convergence or to the convergence to an eigenvector other than the one desired. In practice, the method is used when a good approximation for the eigenvalue is known, and hence one needs only few (quite often just one) iterations.

== Theory and convergence ==

The basic idea of the power iteration is choosing an initial vector formula_14 (either an eigenvector approximation or a random vector) and iteratively calculating formula_15. Except for a set of zero measure, for any initial vector, the result will converge to an eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue.

The inverse iteration does the same for the matrix formula_9, so it converges to the eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix formula_9. 
Eigenvalues of this matrix are formula_18 where formula_19 are eigenvalues of formula_10.
The largest of these numbers corresponds to the smallest of formula_21 The eigenvectors of formula_10 and of formula_9 are the same, since

formula_24

Conclusion: The method converges to the eigenvector of the matrix formula_10 corresponding to the closest eigenvalue to formula_26

In particular, taking formula_27 we see that formula_28
converges to the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of formula_29 with the largest magnitude formula_30 and thus can be used to determine the smallest magnitude eigenvalue of formula_10 since they are inversely related.

=== Speed of convergence ===

Let us analyze the rate of convergence of the method.

The power method is known to converge linearly to the limit, more precisely:

formula_32

hence for the inverse iteration method similar result sounds as:

formula_33

This is a key formula for understanding the method&#x27;s convergence. It shows that if formula_1 is chosen close enough to some eigenvalue formula_35, for example formula_36 each iteration will improve the accuracy formula_37 times. (We use that for small enough formula_38 &quot;closest to formula_1&quot; and &quot;closest to formula_35&quot; is the same.) For small enough formula_41 it is approximately the same as formula_42. Hence if one is able to find formula_43, such that the formula_44 will be small enough, then very few iterations may be satisfactory.

=== Complexity ===

The inverse iteration algorithm requires solving a linear system or calculation of the inverse matrix.
For non-structured matrices (not sparse, not Toeplitz...) this requires formula_45 operations.

== Implementation options ==

The method is defined by the formula:

formula_3

There are, however, multiple options for its implementation.

=== Calculate inverse matrix or solve system of linear equations ===

We can rewrite the formula in the following way:
formula_47

emphasizing that to find the next approximation formula_48 we may solve a system of linear equations. 
There are two options: one may choose an algorithm that solves a linear system, or one may calculate the inverse formula_9 and then apply it to the vector.
Both options have complexity &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3), the exact number depends on the chosen method.

The choice depends also on the number of iterations. Naively, if at each iteration one solves a linear system, the complexity will be &quot;k&quot; &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3), where &quot;k&quot; is number of iterations; similarly, calculating the inverse matrix and applying it at each iteration is of complexity &quot;k&quot; &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3).
Note, however, that if the eigenvalue estimate formula_1 remains constant, then we may reduce the complexity to &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3) + &quot;k&quot; &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2) with either method.
Calculating the inverse matrix once, and storing it to apply at each iteration is of complexity &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3) + &quot;k&quot; &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2).
Storing an LU decomposition of formula_51 and using forward and back substitution to solve the system of equations at each iteration is also of complexity &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3) + &quot;k&quot; &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2).

Inverting the matrix will typically have a greater initial cost, but lower cost at each iteration. Conversely, solving systems of linear equations will typically have a lesser initial cost, but require more operations for each iteration.

=== Tridiagonalization, Hessenberg form ===

If it is necessary to perform many iterations (or few iterations, but for many eigenvectors), then it might be wise to bring the matrix to the 
upper Hessenberg form first (for symmetric matrix this will be tridiagonal form). Which costs formula_52 arithmetic operations using a technique based on Householder reduction), with a finite sequence of orthogonal similarity transforms, somewhat like a two-sided QR decomposition. (For QR decomposition, the Householder rotations are multiplied only on the left, but for the Hessenberg case they are multiplied on both left and right.) For symmetric matrices this procedure costs formula_53 arithmetic operations using a technique based on Householder reduction.

Solution of the system of linear equations for the tridiagonal matrix costs formula_54 operations, so the complexity grows like formula_55, where formula_56 is the iteration number, which is better than for the direct inversion. However, for few iterations such transformation may not be practical.

Also transformation to the Hessenberg form involves square roots and the division operation, which are not universally supported by hardware.

=== Choice of the normalization constant ===

On general purpose processors (e.g. produced by Intel) the execution time of addition, multiplication and division is approximately equal. But on embedded and/or low energy consuming hardware (digital signal processors, FPGA, ASIC) division may not be supported by hardware, and so should be avoided. 
Choosing formula_57 allows fast division without explicit hardware support, as division by a power of 2 may be implemented as either a bit shift (for fixed-point arithmetic) or subtraction of formula_56 from the exponent (for floating-point arithmetic).

When implementing the algorithm using fixed-point arithmetic, the choice of the constant formula_4 is especially important. Small values will lead to fast growth of the norm of formula_8 and to overflow; large values of formula_4 will cause the vector formula_8 to tend toward zero.

== Usage ==

The main application of the method is the situation when an approximation to an eigenvalue is found and one needs to find the corresponding approximate eigenvector. In such a situation the inverse iteration is the main and probably the only method to use.

=== Methods to find approximate eigenvalues ===

Typically, the method is used in combination with some other method which finds approximate eigenvalues: the standard example is the bisection eigenvalue algorithm, another example is the Rayleigh quotient iteration, which is actually the same inverse iteration with the choice of the approximate eigenvalue as the Rayleigh quotient corresponding to the vector obtained on the previous step of the iteration.

There are some situations where the method can be used by itself, however they are quite marginal.

=== Norm of matrix as approximation to the &quot;dominant&quot; eigenvalue ===

The dominant eigenvalue can be easily estimated for any matrix. 
For any induced norm it is true that formula_63 for any eigenvalue formula_64. 
So taking the norm of the matrix as an approximate eigenvalue one can see that the method will converge to the dominant eigenvector.

=== Estimates based on statistics ===

In some real-time applications one needs to find eigenvectors for matrices with a speed of millions of matrices per second. In such applications, typically the statistics of matrices is known in advance and one can take as an approximate eigenvalue the average eigenvalue for some large matrix sample.
Better, one may calculate the mean ratio of the eigenvalues to the trace or the norm of the matrix and estimate the average eigenvalue as the trace or norm multiplied by the average value of that ratio. Clearly such a method can be used only with discretion and only when high precision is not critical. 
This approach of estimating an average eigenvalue can be combined with other methods to avoid excessively large error.

<text>Hazuri Bagh () is a garden in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, bounded by the Lahore Fort to the east, Badshahi Mosque to the west, the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh to the north, and the Roshnai Gate to the south. The garden was built during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, in the style of Mughal gardens. In the centre of the garden stands the Hazuri Bagh Baradari, built by the Maharaja in 1818 to celebrate his capture of the &quot;Koh-i-Noor&quot; diamond from Shuja Shah Durrani in 1813. The &quot;Serai Alamgiri&quot; caravanserai formerly stood where Hazuri Bagh is now located.
==History==

The Hazuri Bagh garden was planned and built under the supervision of Faqir Azizuddin in the traditional Mughal style layout. After its completion, it is said, Ranjit Singh, at the suggestion of Khushal Singh Jamadar, ordered that marble vandalized from various mausoleums of Lahore to construct a baradari (pavilion) here. This task was given to Khalifa Nooruddin. Elegant carved marble pillars support the baradari&#x27;s delicate cusped arches. The central area, where Ranjit Singh held court, has a mirrored ceiling. Both the garden and the baradari, originally a 45-foot, three-storey square with a basement approached by fifteen steps, suffered extensive damage during the Sikh wars and was only reclaimed and laid out according to the original plan during the British period. On 19 July 1932, the top story collapsed and was never rebuilt or restored. The tomb of Muhammad Iqbal, completed in 1951, as well as of Sikandar Hayat Khan, the last Premier of the Punjab, lies across from the garden outside of the Badshahi Mosque.

Every Sunday afternoon, people gather in the garden to hear story tellers recite traditional Punjabi Qisse, such as &quot;Heer Ranjha&quot; and &quot;Sassi Punnun&quot;, and other Punjabi Sufi poetic pieces.

<text>Intelligence assessment, or simply intel, is the development of behavior forecasts or recommended courses of action to the leadership of an organisation, based on wide ranges of available overt and covert information (intelligence). Assessments develop in response to leadership declaration requirements to inform decision-making. Assessment may be executed on behalf of a state, military or commercial organisation with ranges of information sources available to each.

An intelligence assessment reviews available information and previous assessments for relevance and currency. Where there requires additional information, the analyst may direct some collection.

Intelligence studies is the academic field concerning intelligence assessment, especially relating to international relations and military science.

== Process ==

Intelligence assessment is based on a customer requirement or need, which may be a standing requirement or tailored to a specific circumstance or a Request for Information (RFI). The &quot;requirement&quot; is passed to the assessing agency and worked through the intelligence cycle, a structured method for responding to the RFI.

The RFI may indicate in what format the requester prefers to consume the product.

The RFI is reviewed by a Requirements Manager, who will then direct appropriate tasks to respond to the request. This will involve a review of existing material, the tasking of new analytical product or the collection of new information to inform an analysis.

New information may be collected through one or more of the various collection disciplines; human source, electronic and communications intercept, imagery or open sources. The nature of the RFI and the urgency placed on it may indicate that some collection types are unsuitable due to the time taken to collect or validate the information gathered. Intelligence gathering disciplines and the sources and methods used are often highly classified and compartmentalised, with analysts requiring an appropriate high level of security clearance.

The process of taking known information about situations and entities of importance to the RFI, characterizing what is known and attempting to forecast future events is termed &quot;all source&quot; assessment, analysis or processing. The analyst uses multiple sources to mutually corroborate, or exclude, the information collected, reaching a conclusion along with a measure of confidence around that conclusion.

Where sufficient current information already exists, the analysis may be tasked directly without reference to further collection.

The analysis is then communicated back to the requester in the format directed, although subject to the constraints on both the RFI and the methods used in the analysis, the format may be made available for other uses as well and disseminated accordingly. The analysis will be written to a defined classification level with alternative versions potentially available at a number of classification levels for further dissemination.

==Target-centric intelligence cycle==

This approach, known as Find-Fix-Finish-Exploit-Assess (F3EA), is complementary to the intelligence cycle and focused on the intervention itself, where the subject of the assessment is clearly identifiable and provisions exist to make some form of intervention against that subject, the target-centric assessment approach may be used.

The subject for action, or target, is identified and efforts are initially made to find the target for further development. This activity will identify where intervention against the target will have the most beneficial effects.

When the decision is made to intervene, action is taken to fix the target, confirming that the intervention will have a high probability of success and restricting the ability of the target to take independent action.

During the finish stage, the intervention is executed, potentially an arrest or detention or the placement of other collection methods.

Following the intervention, exploitation of the target is carried out, which may lead to further refinement of the process for related targets. The output from the exploit stage will also be passed into other intelligence assessment activities.

== Intelligence Information Cycle Theory ==
The Intelligence Information Cycle leverages secrecy theory and U.S. regulation of classified intelligence to re-conceptualize the traditional intelligence cycle under the following four assumptions:

# Intelligence is secret information
# Intelligence is a public good
# Intelligence moves cyclically
# Intelligence is hoarded

Information is transformed from privately held to secretly held to public based on who has control over it. For example, the private information of a source becomes secret information (intelligence) when control over its dissemination is shared with an intelligence officer, and then becomes public information when the intelligence officer further disseminates it to the public by any number of means, including formal reporting, threat warning, and others. The fourth assumption, intelligence is hoarded, causes conflict points where information transitions from one type to another. The first conflict point, collection, occurs when private transitions to secret information (intelligence). The second conflict point, dissemination, occurs when secret transitions to public information. Thus, conceiving of intelligence using these assumptions demonstrates the cause of collection techniques (to ease the private-secret transition) and dissemination conflicts, and can inform ethical standards of conduct among all agents in the intelligence process.

<doc id="519280" wikidata="Q83500" url="?curid=519280" title="Intelligence">
<text>Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. It can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information; and to retain it as knowledge to be applied to adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.

The term rose to prominence during the early 1900s. Most psychologists believe that intelligence can be divided into various domains or competencies.

Intelligence has been long-studied in humans, and across numerous disciplines. It has also been observed in the cognition of non-human animals. Some researchers have suggested that plants exhibit forms of intelligence, though this remains controversial.

Intelligence in computers or other machines is called artificial intelligence.
== Etymology ==

The word &quot;&quot; derives from the Latin nouns &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;, which in turn stem from the verb &quot;&quot;, to comprehend or perceive. In the Middle Ages, the word &quot;intellectus&quot; became the scholarly technical term for understanding and a translation for the Greek philosophical term &quot;nous&quot;. This term, however, was strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism, including theories of the immortality of the soul, and the concept of the active intellect (also known as the active intelligence). This approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by early modern philosophers such as Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and David Hume, all of whom preferred &quot;understanding&quot; (in place of &quot;intellectus&quot; or &quot;intelligence&quot;) in their English philosophical works. Hobbes for example, in his Latin &quot;De Corpore&quot;, used &quot;intellectus intelligit&quot;, translated in the English version as &quot;the understanding understandeth&quot;, as a typical example of a logical absurdity. &quot;Intelligence&quot; has therefore become less common in English language philosophy, but it has later been taken up (with the scholastic theories that it now implies) in more contemporary psychology.

== Definitions ==
There is controversy over how to define intelligence. Scholars describe its constituent abilities in various ways, and differ in the degree to which they conceive of intelligence as quantifiable.

A consensus report called &quot;&quot;, published in 1995 by the Board of Scientific Affairs of the American Psychological Association, states:
Psychologists and learning researchers also have suggested definitions of intelligence such as the following:
== Human ==
Human intelligence is the intellectual power of humans, which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self-awareness. Intelligence enables humans to remember descriptions of things and use those descriptions in future behaviors. It gives humans the cognitive abilities to learn, form concepts, understand, and reason, including the capacities to recognize patterns, innovate, plan, solve problems, and employ language to communicate. These cognitive abilities can be organized into frameworks like fluid vs. crystallized and the Unified Cattell-Horn-Carroll model, which contains abilities like fluid reasoning, perceptual speed, verbal abilities, and others.

Intelligence is different from learning. Learning refers to the act of retaining facts and information or abilities and being able to recall them for future use. Intelligence, on the other hand, is the cognitive ability of someone to perform these and other processes. 

=== Intelligence quotient (IQ) ===
There have been various attempts to quantify intelligence via psychometric testing. Prominent among these are the various Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests, which were first developed in the early 20th century to screen children for intellectual disability. Over time, IQ tests became more pervasive, being used to screen immigrants, military recruits, and job applicants. As the tests became more popular, belief that IQ tests measure a fundamental and unchanging attribute that all humans possess became widespread. 

An influential theory that promoted the idea that IQ measures a fundamental quality possessed by every person is the theory of General Intelligence, or &quot;g&quot; factor. The &quot;g&quot; factor is a construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual&#x27;s scores on a range of cognitive tests. 

Today, most psychologists agree that IQ measures at least some aspects of human intelligence, particularly the ability to thrive in an academic context. However, many psychologists question the validity of IQ tests as a measure of intelligence as a whole.

There is debate about the heritability of IQ, that is, what proportion of differences in IQ test performance between individuals are explained by genetic or environmental factors. The scientific consensus is that genetics does not explain average differences in IQ test performance between racial groups.

=== Emotional ===
Emotional intelligence is thought to be the ability to convey emotion to others in an understandable way as well as to read the emotions of others accurately. Some theories imply that a heightened emotional intelligence could also lead to faster generating and processing of emotions in addition to the accuracy. In addition, higher emotional intelligence is thought to help us manage emotions, which is beneficial for our problem-solving skills. Emotional intelligence is important to our mental health and has ties to social intelligence.

=== Social ===
Social intelligence is the ability to understand the social cues and motivations of others and oneself in social situations. It is thought to be distinct from other types of intelligence, but has relations to emotional intelligence. Social intelligence has coincided with other studies that focus on how we make judgements of others, the accuracy with which we do so, and why people would be viewed as having positive or negative social character. There is debate as to whether or not these studies and social intelligence come from the same theories or if there is a distinction between them, and they are generally thought to be of two different schools of thought.

=== Moral ===

Moral intelligence is the capacity to understand right from wrong and to behave based on the value that is believed to be right. It is considered a distinct form of intelligence, independent to both emotional and cognitive intelligence.

=== Book smart and street smart ===
Concepts of &quot;book smarts&quot; and &quot;street smart&quot; are contrasting views based on the premise that some people have knowledge gained through academic study, but may lack the experience to sensibly apply that knowledge, while others have knowledge gained through practical experience, but may lack accurate information usually gained through study by which to effectively apply that knowledge. Artificial intelligence researcher Hector Levesque has noted that:

== Nonhuman animal ==

Although humans have been the primary focus of intelligence researchers, scientists have also attempted to investigate animal intelligence, or more broadly, animal cognition. These researchers are interested in studying both mental ability in a particular species, and comparing abilities between species. They study various measures of problem solving, as well as numerical and verbal reasoning abilities. Some challenges include defining intelligence so it has the same meaning across species, and operationalizing a measure that accurately compares mental ability across species and contexts.

Wolfgang Köhler&#x27;s research on the intelligence of apes is an example of research in this area, as is Stanley Coren&#x27;s book, &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;. Non-human animals particularly noted and studied for their intelligence include chimpanzees, bonobos (notably the language-using Kanzi) and other great apes, dolphins, elephants and to some extent parrots, rats and ravens.

Cephalopod intelligence provides an important comparative study. Cephalopods appear to exhibit characteristics of significant intelligence, yet their nervous systems differ radically from those of backboned animals. Vertebrates such as mammals, birds, reptiles and fish have shown a fairly high degree of intellect that varies according to each species. The same is true with arthropods.

=== &quot;g&quot; factor in non-humans ===
Evidence of a general factor of intelligence has been observed in non-human animals. First described in humans, the &quot;g&quot; factor has since been identified in a number of non-human species.

Cognitive ability and intelligence cannot be measured using the same, largely verbally dependent, scales developed for humans. Instead, intelligence is measured using a variety of interactive and observational tools focusing on innovation, habit reversal, social learning, and responses to novelty. Studies have shown that &quot;g&quot; is responsible for 47% of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in primates and between 55% and 60% of the variance in mice (Locurto, Locurto). These values are similar to the accepted variance in IQ explained by &quot;g&quot; in humans (40–50%).

== Plant ==
It has been argued that plants should also be classified as intelligent based on their ability to sense and model external and internal environments and adjust their morphology, physiology and phenotype accordingly to ensure self-preservation and reproduction.

A counter argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the creation and use of persistent memories as opposed to computation that does not involve learning. If this is accepted as definitive of intelligence, then it includes the artificial intelligence of robots capable of &quot;machine learning&quot;, but excludes those purely autonomic sense-reaction responses that can be observed in many plants. Plants are not limited to automated sensory-motor responses, however, they are capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of &quot;learning&quot; (registering memories) from their past experiences. They are also capable of communication, accurately computing their circumstances, using sophisticated cost–benefit analysis and taking tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control the diverse environmental stressors.

== Artificial ==

Scholars studying artificial intelligence have proposed definitions of intelligence that include the intelligence demonstrated by machines. Some of these definitions are meant to be general enough to encompass human and other animal intelligence as well. An intelligent agent can be defined as a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. Kaplan and Haenlein define artificial intelligence as &quot;a system&#x27;s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation&quot;. Progress in artificial intelligence can be demonstrated in benchmarks ranging from games to practical tasks such as protein folding. Existing AI lags humans in terms of general intelligence, which is sometimes defined as the &quot;capacity to learn how to carry out a huge range of tasks&quot;.

Mathematician Olle Häggström defines intelligence in terms of &quot;optimization power&quot;, an agent&#x27;s capacity for efficient cross-domain optimization of the world according to the agent&#x27;s preferences, or more simply the ability to &quot;steer the future into regions of possibility ranked high in a preference ordering&quot;. In this optimization framework, Deep Blue has the power to &quot;steer a chessboard&#x27;s future into a subspace of possibility which it labels as &#x27;winning&#x27;, despite attempts by Garry Kasparov to steer the future elsewhere.&quot; Hutter and Legg, after surveying the literature, define intelligence as &quot;an agent&#x27;s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments&quot;. While cognitive ability is sometimes measured as a one-dimensional parameter, it could also be represented as a &quot;hypersurface in a multidimensional space&quot; to compare systems that are good at different intellectual tasks. Some skeptics believe that there is no meaningful way to define intelligence, aside from &quot;just pointing to ourselves&quot;.

Our brain is so good at comprehending language that we do not usually notice.&quot; A prominent example is the &quot;pronoun disambiguation problem&quot; (&quot;PDP&quot;): a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a pronoun in a sentence—such as &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot; or &quot;it&quot;—refers.

<text>Jegog is a form of gamelan music indigenous to Bali, Indonesia, played on instruments made of bamboo. The tradition of jegog is centered in Jembrana, a region in Western Bali. In recent years jegog has started to become popular in other regions of Bali with a few groups being established in central Bali to entertain tourists. International interest has been spread by tourists visiting Bali and by recordings. There are virtually no ensembles outside of Bali with the exception of at least two groups in Japan (Sekar Sakura and Geinoh Yamashirogumi, the latter&#x27;s having been used in 4 of the tracks in their score for the film &quot;Akira&quot; as well as on the final track of &quot;Ecophony Rinne&quot; ), one in the United States (Sekar Jaya) and one in Germany. Jegog music is very fast, loud, rhythmic and precise. Pieces last from a few minutes to as long as thirty minutes.

==Instruments==
Jegog instruments have a four-note scale that roughly corresponds to the four pitches of a dominant 7th chord in Western music. All instruments have eight bamboo keys. Some instruments have two keys for each pitch slightly detuned so that the pitches beat when they are played together. Other instruments have a two octave range with four pitches in a low octave and the same four pitches an octave higher. In this case the instrument will be paired with another instrument that is slightly detuned. Taken together the ensemble has a range of five octaves. 

Most Jegog ensembles have instruments that have keys that are made of bamboo that are split at one end and then half of the tube is removed. The other end remains intact and functions as a resonator for the split part. The keys are suspended on a wooden frame and struck with mallets (&quot;called pangguls&quot;), made out of wood or rubber. There are also Jegog ensembles with instruments called &quot;Jegog Tingklik&quot;. These smaller instruments are used primarily with children. The keys are made of bamboo slats mounted above a resonator box.

===Jegog===
The lowest instrument in a Jegog ensemble is also called a &quot;Jegog&quot;. The ensemble gets its name from this instrument. The keys of the &quot;Jegog&quot; instrument are as long as 3 meters in length and a pitch as low as 60 hertz. The instrument is so large, and the mallets are so heavy that it takes two people to play it. The players crouch on a platform on the top of the instrument and alternate playing the keys. The Jegog instrument has the lowest octave of the ensemble. Each pair of pitches are detuned by as much as 7 hertz. In this octave, that is almost a whole tone. The keys are arranged 1&#x27; 2&#x27; 3&#x27; 4&#x27; 1 2 3 4, one being the lowest pitch and 4 being the highest. The four keys on the left are the higher pitches of the detuned pairs and the four on the right are the lower ones.

===Melody Instruments===
One octave higher than the &quot;Jegog&quot; is an instrument called the &quot;Undir&quot;, and an octave above that is the &quot;Kuntung&quot;. In recent years the &quot;Kuntung&quot; is often called a &quot;Celuluk&quot;. The instruments are small enough to be played by one person each. The &quot;Undir&quot; is still big enough that the player needs to crouch on a platform on the top of it to play it. There are two &quot;Undir&quot; and two &quot;Kuntung&quot;. The &quot;Undir&quot; and &quot;Kuntung&quot; have the same arrangement of keys as the &quot;Jegog&quot; but in higher octaves. These five instruments together play the melody (called the &quot;bun&quot;). Some ensembles have a high pitch flute called a &quot;suling&quot; that also plays the melody.

===Kotekan instruments===
Each of the remaining 9 instruments span two octaves and are arranged 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 where 5 through 8 is an octave above 1 to 4. The lowest of these instruments, called the &quot;Barangan&quot;, span the same octaves as the &quot;Undir&quot; and the &quot;Kuntung&quot;. The next higher is the &quot;Kanci&quot;l which begins with the octave of the &quot;Kuntung&quot; and extends an octave higher. The next higher—the highest in the ensemble—is the &quot;Suir&quot;, likewise, extending one octave higher. There are three Barangan, three Kancil, and three suir.

The &quot;Barangan&quot; often plays the melody twice as fast as the other melody instruments. Since this is often very fast, the players alternate playing the notes. The &quot;Kancil&quot; and &quot;Suir&quot; play interlocking patterns called &quot;Kotekan&quot;, sometimes the &quot;Barangan&quot; play these patterns as well. The &quot;Barangan&quot; are the front line of the ensemble. The center of the three &quot;Barangan&quot; is the leader of the ensemble. Other players watch the leader for cues and tempo changes.

===Instrumentation variations===
A smaller version of a gamelan jegog might not have the 2 &quot;kuntung&quot; and the 3 &quot;suir&quot;. This smaller ensemble has a longer history than the one outlined above. 

If a gamelan jegog is accompanying dance, it may be augmented by &quot;kendang&quot; (drums), &quot;ceng-ceng&quot; (cymbals) and &quot;tawa-tawa&quot; (a beat-keeping small gong).

<text>Victoria Anne Theresa Peterson Cowsill (born January 11, 1958) is an American rock musician and songwriter. She has been the lead guitarist for the Bangles since their founding in 1981. After their first disbandment in 1989, she has returned to the band for all subsequent reunions. In intervening years, she has performed with other artists, most extensively with the Continental Drifters.

== Early life ==
Peterson described herself as a solo artist in her early years – &quot;I was a kid who brought her guitar to every sleep-over and summer afternoon in the park to play her newest creation to anyone who would listen…&quot; In high school she formed a band that went through various incarnations as Crista Galli, Aishi, the Muze, the Fans, and Those Girls from 1976 to 1980.

== Music career ==
In 1981, she founded the Bangs, later renamed the Bangles, with her sister Debbi Peterson and Susanna Hoffs.

After the Bangles disbanded in 1989, Peterson played with the Continental Drifters and the Psycho Sisters, in both cases with Susan Cowsill. In addition to performing their own material, the Psycho Sisters freelanced as backing singers (Steve Wynn&#x27;s &quot;Fluorescent&quot;, Giant Sand&#x27;s &quot;Center of the Universe&quot;), and Peterson has contributed harmony vocals to recordings by the Hoodoo Gurus, John Doe, Tom Petty and Belinda Carlisle. Additionally, she filled in for a pregnant Charlotte Caffey on the 1994–1995 Go-Go&#x27;s reunion tour. In 1999 the Bangles reformed and have recorded and played sporadically.

Peterson married musician John Cowsill, brother of her Continental Drifters and Psycho Sisters bandmate Susan Cowsill, on October 25, 2003. The couple have no children together. An earlier relationship had ended when her fiancé Bobby Donati died of leukemia in 1991.

Peterson lived for several years in New Orleans before relocating back to Los Angeles.

In August 2014, after playing together as the Psycho Sisters for more than 20 years, Peterson and Susan Cowsill released their first album, titled &quot;Up on the Chair, Beatrice&quot;. In 2017, she and John Cowsill joined Bill Mumy as the band Action Skulls to release an album (also including posthumous contributions from the bassist Rick Rosas) titled &quot;Angels Hear&quot;.

== Gear ==

Vicki Peterson&#x27;s first guitar was a plastic guitar from Sears. She &quot;got serious&quot; when, at age nine, she became the proud owner of an Electro ES-17 guitar and an 8-watt Rickenbacker amp. Her next few guitars would be a double cutaway Univox Ripper, a 1972 Gibson Les Paul Custom and a 1967 Fender Stratocaster, which she used on many of the Bangles early recordings. She has also been known to use Carvin guitars and amps, and by the time the Bangles reformed, Vicki also used a Gibson mandolin, a pink Fender Telecaster Thinline, several Daisy Rock Girl Guitars, and Gretsch guitars. When her 72 Les Paul Custom was stolen, Vicki eventually replaced it with a burgundy Les Paul Custom.
Vicki&#x27;s primary amps were Carvin amps, as well as a Marshall combo, a Fender Twin, a 1965 Fender Deluxe Reverb, and a Fender Super Reverb, but as for pedals, she used an Ibanez Tube Screamer. She lists among her influences Paul Simon, Bonnie Raitt, Joni Mitchell, George Harrison, and Nancy Wilson.

<doc id="519303" wikidata="Q1030382" url="?curid=519303" title="Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number">
<text>In mathematics, a Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number, also called simply a Pisot number or a PV number, is a real algebraic integer greater than 1, all of whose Galois conjugates are less than 1 in absolute value. These numbers were discovered by Axel Thue in 1912 and rediscovered by G. H. Hardy in 1919 within the context of Diophantine approximation. They became widely known after the publication of Charles Pisot&#x27;s dissertation in 1938. They also occur in the uniqueness problem for Fourier series. Tirukkannapuram Vijayaraghavan and Raphael Salem continued their study in the 1940s. Salem numbers are a closely related set of numbers.

A characteristic property of PV numbers is that their powers approach integers at an exponential rate. Pisot proved a remarkable converse: if &quot;α&quot; &gt; 1 is a real number such that the sequence

: formula_1

measuring the distance from its consecutive powers to the nearest integer is square-summable, or &quot;ℓ&quot; 2, then &quot;α&quot; is a Pisot number (and, in particular, algebraic). Building on this characterization of PV numbers, Salem showed that the set &quot;S&quot; of all PV numbers is closed. Its minimal element is a cubic irrationality known as the plastic ratio. Much is known about the accumulation points of &quot;S&quot;. The smallest of them is the golden ratio.

==Definition and properties==

An algebraic integer of degree &quot;n&quot; is a root &quot;α&quot; of an irreducible monic polynomial &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of degree &quot;n&quot; with integer coefficients, its minimal polynomial. The other roots of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) are called the conjugates of &quot;α&quot;. If &quot;α&quot; &gt; 1 but all other roots of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) are real or complex numbers of absolute value less than 1, so that they lie strictly inside the unit circle in the complex plane, then &quot;α&quot; is called a Pisot number, Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number, or simply PV number. For example, the golden ratio, &quot;φ&quot; ≈ 1.618, is a real quadratic integer that is greater than 1, while the absolute value of its conjugate, −&quot;φ&quot;−1 ≈ −0.618, is less than 1. Therefore, &quot;φ&quot; is a Pisot number. Its minimal polynomial 

===Elementary properties===
* Every integer greater than 1 is a PV number. Conversely, every rational PV number is an integer greater than 1.
* If α is an irrational PV number whose minimal polynomial ends in &quot;k&quot; then α is greater than |&quot;k&quot;&amp;hairsp;|.
* If α is a PV number then so are its powers α&quot;k&quot;, for all positive integer exponents &quot;k&quot;.
* Every real algebraic number field K of degree &quot;n&quot; contains a PV number of degree &quot;n&quot;. This number is a field generator. The set of all PV numbers of degree &quot;n&quot; in K is closed under multiplication.
* Given an upper bound &quot;M&quot; and degree &quot;n&quot;, there are only finitely many of PV numbers of degree &quot;n&quot; that are less than &quot;M&quot;.
* Every PV number is a Perron number (a real algebraic number greater than one all of whose conjugates have smaller absolute value).

===Diophantine properties===

The main interest in PV numbers is due to the fact that their powers have a very &quot;biased&quot; distribution (mod 1). If &quot;α&quot; is a PV number and &quot;λ&quot; is any algebraic integer in the field formula_2 then the sequence
: formula_3
where ||&quot;x&quot;|| denotes the distance from the real number &quot;x&quot; to the nearest integer, approaches 0 at an exponential rate. In particular, it is a square-summable sequence
and its terms converge to 0.

Two converse statements are known: they characterize PV numbers among all real numbers and among the algebraic numbers (but under a weaker Diophantine assumption).

* Suppose &quot;α&quot; is a real number greater than 1 and &quot;λ&quot; is a non-zero real number such that

:: formula_4

:Then &quot;α&quot; is a Pisot number and &quot;λ&quot; is an algebraic number in the field formula_2 (Pisot&#x27;s theorem).

* Suppose &quot;α&quot; is an algebraic number greater than 1 and &quot;λ&quot; is a non-zero real number such that

:: formula_6

:Then &quot;α&quot; is a Pisot number and &quot;λ&quot; is an algebraic number in the field formula_2.

A longstanding Pisot–Vijayaraghavan problem asks whether the assumption that &quot;α&quot; is algebraic can be dropped from the last statement. If the answer is affirmative, Pisot&#x27;s numbers would be characterized &quot;among all real numbers&quot; by the simple convergence of ||&quot;λα&quot;&quot;n&quot;|| to 0 for some auxiliary real &quot;λ&quot;. It is known that there are only countably many numbers &quot;α&quot; with this property. The problem is to decide whether any of them is transcendental.

===Topological properties===

The set of all Pisot numbers is denoted &quot;S&quot;. Since Pisot numbers are algebraic, the set &quot;S&quot; is countable. Raphael Salem proved that this set is closed: it contains all its limit points. His proof uses a constructive version of the main diophantine property of Pisot numbers: given a Pisot number &quot;α&quot;, a real number &quot;λ&quot; can be chosen so that 0 &lt; &quot;λ&quot; ≤ &quot;α&quot; and

: formula_8

Thus the &quot;ℓ&quot; 2 norm of the sequence ||&quot;λα&quot;&quot;n&quot;|| can be bounded by a uniform constant independent of &quot;α&quot;. In the last step of the proof, Pisot&#x27;s characterization is invoked to conclude that the limit of a sequence of Pisot numbers is itself a Pisot number.

Closedness of &quot;S&quot; implies that it has a minimal element. Carl Siegel proved that it is the positive root of the equation (plastic constant) and is isolated in &quot;S&quot;. He constructed two sequences of Pisot numbers converging to the golden ratio &quot;φ&quot; from below and asked whether &quot;φ&quot; is the smallest limit point of &quot;S&quot;. This was later proved by Dufresnoy and Pisot, who also determined all elements of &quot;S&quot; that are less than &quot;φ&quot;; not all of them belong to Siegel&#x27;s two sequences. Vijayaraghavan proved that &quot;S&quot; has infinitely many limit points; in fact, the sequence of derived sets

: formula_9

does not terminate. On the other hand, the intersection formula_10 of these sets is empty, meaning that the Cantor–Bendixson rank of &quot;S&quot; is &quot;ω&quot;. Even more accurately, the order type of &quot;S&quot; has been determined.

The set of Salem numbers, denoted by &quot;T&quot;, is intimately related with &quot;S&quot;. It has been proved that &quot;S&quot; is contained in the set &quot;T&quot;&#x27; of the limit points of &quot;T&quot;. It has been conjectured that the union of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; is closed.

==Quadratic irrationals==

If formula_11 is a quadratic irrational there is only one other conjugate, formula_12, obtained by changing the sign of the square root in formula_13 from

:formula_14

or from

: formula_15

Here &quot;a&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are integers and in the second case &quot;a&quot; is odd and &quot;D&quot; is congruent to 1 modulo 4.

The required conditions are &quot;α&quot; &gt; 1 and −1 &lt; &quot;α&quot;&#x27; &lt; 1.
These are satisfied in the first case exactly when &quot;a&quot; &gt; 0 and either formula_16 or formula_17, and are satisfied in the second case exactly when formula_18 and either formula_19 or formula_20.

Thus, the first few quadratic irrationals that are PV numbers are:

==Powers of PV-numbers==

Pisot–Vijayaraghavan numbers can be used to generate almost integers: the &quot;n&quot;th power of a Pisot number approaches integers as &quot;n&quot; grows. For example,

: formula_21

Since formula_22 and formula_23 differ by only formula_24

: formula_25

is extremely close to

: formula_26

Indeed

: formula_27

Higher powers give correspondingly better rational approximations.

This property stems from the fact that for each &quot;n&quot;, the sum of &quot;n&quot;th powers of an algebraic integer &quot;x&quot; and its conjugates is exactly an integer; this follows from an application of Newton&#x27;s identities. When &quot;x&quot; is a Pisot number, the &quot;n&quot;th powers of the other conjugates tend to 0 as &quot;n&quot; tends to infinity. Since the sum is an integer, the distance from &quot;xn&quot; to the nearest integer tends to 0 at an exponential rate.

==Small Pisot numbers==

All Pisot numbers that do not exceed the golden ratio &quot;φ&quot; have been determined by Dufresnoy and Pisot. The table below lists ten smallest Pisot numbers in increasing order.

Since these PV numbers are less than 2, they are all units: their minimal polynomials end in 1 or −1.

The polynomials in this table, with the exception of

: formula_28

are factors of either

:formula_29
or
:formula_30

The first polynomial is divisible by &quot;x&quot;2 − 1 when &quot;n&quot; is odd and by &quot;x&quot; − 1 when &quot;n&quot; is even. It has one other real zero, which is a PV number. Dividing either polynomial by &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; gives expressions that approach &quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;x&quot; − 1 as &quot;n&quot; grows very large and have zeros that converge to &quot;φ&quot;. A complementary pair of polynomials,

:formula_31
and
:formula_32

yields Pisot numbers that approach φ from above.

Two-dimensional turbulence modeling using logarithmic spiral chains with self-similarity defined by a constant scaling factor can be reproduced with some small Pisot numbers.

<text>Michael Tenzer (born 1957) is a composer, performer, and music educator and scholar.

== Career ==
Tenzer was born in New York City and studied music at Yale University (BA. 1978) and University of California, Berkeley (Ph.D. 1986). After teaching at Yale from 1986 to 1996, he moved to University of British Columbia where he teaches ethnomusicology, composition, music theory and gamelan performance, and co-directs the doctoral program in ethnomusicology.

Tenzer&#x27;s compositions for chamber, solo and orchestral media have been performed in North America, Europe, and Asia, featuring performers such as Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri (tabla), Alex Klein (oboe) and Evan Ziporyn (clarinet). His publications have been recognized with the Society for Ethnomusicology&#x27;s Alan P. Merriam Prize (best book of 2000) and the 34th annual ASCAP-Deems Taylor award, and his research has been supported with grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and Fulbright. Among his composition prizes are a Library of Congress/Koussevitzky commission for a chamber work, &quot;Sources of Current&quot;. After its premiere the New York Times called it &quot;deft, sophisticated and inventive.&quot; He received the Charles Ives Center award for his percussion quartet (1981), the DiLorenzo prize for the octet &quot;Daya&quot; (1985) for string quartet and clarinets, and the Morse Fellowship to complete his &quot;Symphony for Strings&quot; (1988). Tenzer&#x27;s music is available on New World, Cantaloupe and Bali Stereo labels.

Since 1977, Tenzer has been deeply involved with the gamelan music of Bali, Indonesia. He carried out several years of research and writing about it on a series of fellowships, among them a Fulbright (1982), a grant from the Asian Cultural Council (1987) the Morse Fellowship (1989), and a National Endowment for the Humanities University Teacher&#x27;s Fellowship (1994). An experienced performer and teacher of gamelan, Tenzer is the author of two books on the subject: &quot;Balinese Music&quot; (Periplus: 1991; 2nd ed. 1998) and &quot;Gamelan Gong Kebyar: The Art of 20th Century Balinese Music&quot; (University of Chicago Press 2000). More recently he published Analytical Studies in World Music (Oxford 2006). He was the first Western composer invited to compose for Balinese ensembles in Bali and has completed a series of works of an increasingly experimental character for the gamelan since 1982, among them &quot;Sinar Jegog&quot; (1985), &quot;Situ Banda&quot; (&quot;Bridge of Monkeys&quot;; 1989), &quot;Banyuari&quot; (&quot;Tributary&quot;; 1992), &quot;Talakalam&quot; for gamelan with tabla (1999), &quot;Puser Belah&quot; for 2 simultaneous gamelan (&quot;Unstable Center&quot;; 2003), and &quot;Buk Katah&quot; for gamelan with a nonet of brass, winds and piano (&quot;Underleaf&quot;; 2006). These works have been cited by Balinese critics as &quot;an important and unique contribution to our cultural heritage&quot;. The last three compositions cited plus others are featured on the 2009 CD Let Others Name You on New World records. In 1979, Tenzer co-founded the Sekar Jaya gamelan ensemble in Berkeley, California, an organization of Americans dedicated to the performance of Balinese arts that is now internationally known. Since 1996 he has directed Gamelan Gita Asmara in Vancouver.

<text>The Action libérale nationale (; ALN; ) was a short-lived provincial political party in Quebec, Canada. It was founded during the Great Depression and led by Paul Gouin. The ALN played an important role in the foundation of the Union Nationale.

==Origin and beliefs==

The party was created in 1934 by dissidents from the Liberal Party of Quebec. It soon received the support of French Canadian nationalists as federal Liberal Member of Parliament Édouard Lacroix, Liberal Members of the Legislature Oscar Drouin and Philippe Hamel, and Québec City mayor Joseph-Ernest Grégoire.

The ALN promoted social justice, nationalism and was not affiliated to any federal party. Its platform included the following proposals:

* Farm credit;
* Voluntary migration from cities to rural areas;
* Rural electrification;
* Nationalization of electricity;
* Corporatism;
* Electoral reform;

Its ideology was influenced by the social doctrine of the Catholic Church promoted by the priest Lionel Groulx, and the economical ideas of Esdras Minville.

==Electoral breakthrough==

In order to unite the vote against the Liberal government of Alexandre Taschereau, the Action libérale nationale (ALN) and the Conservative Party of Quebec decided to run only one candidate of either party in each district for the 1935 Quebec election. With 29% of the vote, the ALN elected 26 out of 57 candidates; the Conservatives received 19% of the vote and won 16 seat out of 33 in which they ran a candidate.

==Decline==

Less than a year later, Conservative Leader Maurice Duplessis, a rising star in provincial politics, tried to pressure ALN Leader Paul Gouin into merging both parties. While Gouin cuts ties with Duplessis, 22 of his Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) joined the new party, known as Union Nationale, which won the 1936 Quebec election.

Gouin did not run for re-election to the legislature in 1936. ALN MNAs Vital Cliche, Wilfrid-Eldège Lauriault and Frederick Arthur Monk ran for re-election as Independents. None of them were elected. Cliche ran as an Action libérale nationale candidate in a by-election held on March 17, 1937, in his home district of Beauce. He was defeated.

The ALN opposed conscription and contested the 1939 Quebec election. Other than Gouin who took the leadership, the party was unable to attract any of its former candidates from the 1935 election. Instead René Chaloult and Oscar Drouin, who had grown disillusioned with Duplessis after they joined the Union Nationale, ran as Liberal candidates. The party won only 4.5% of the vote and none of its 56 candidates were elected. It disappeared soon after.

==Legacy==

Even though the ALN did not survive the 1930s political realignment in Quebec politics, many of its policies were eventually implemented by the provincial governments of Maurice Duplessis, Adélard Godbout and Jean Lesage.

<text>Lujo Brentano (; ; 18 December 1844 – 9 September 1931) was a German economist and social reformer.

==Biography==
Lujo Brentano, born in Aschaffenburg into a German Catholic intellectual family (originally of Italian descent), attended school in Augsburg and Aschaffenburg. He studied in Dublin (Trinity College), Münster, Munich, Heidelberg (doctorate in law), Würzburg, Göttingen (doctorate in economics), and Berlin (habilitation in economics, 1871).

He was a professor of economics and state sciences at the universities of Breslau, Strasbourg, Vienna, Leipzig, and most importantly, Munich (1891–1914). With Ernst Engel, the statistician, he made an investigation of the English trade unions.

In 1872, he became involved in an extended dispute with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Brentano accused Marx of falsifying a quotation from an 1863 speech by William Ewart Gladstone.

In 1914, he signed the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three. After the revolution of November 1918, he served in minister-president Kurt Eisner&#x27;s government of the People&#x27;s State of Bavaria as People&#x27;s Commissar (Minister) for Trade, but only for a few days in December 1918.

Brentano died in Munich in 1931, aged 86.

==Legacy==
Brentano was a , a professor advocating social reform, and a founding member of the . He influenced the social market economy and many Germans who were leaders immediately after the end of World War II. He also influenced later economists, such as his doctoral student Arthur Salz.

<text>Sabino Policarpo Arana Goiri (in Spanish), Sabin Polikarpo Arana Goiri (in Basque), or Arana ta Goiri&#x27;taŕ Sabin (self-styled) (26 January 1865 – 25 November 1903), was a Spanish writer and the founder of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV). Arana is considered the father of Basque nationalism.

He died in Sukarrieta at the age of 38 after falling ill with Addison&#x27;s disease during time spent in prison. He had been charged with treason for attempting to send a telegram to President Theodore Roosevelt, in which he praised the United States for helping Cuba gain independence from Spain.

==Background==

One of the consequences of the First Carlist War was the substitution of the Ancien Régime Basque home rule (&quot;fueros&quot;) by a limited still relevant autonomy. A majority in Navarre and the rest of the Basque districts supported the pretender to the Spanish crown Carlos V for his support to their institutions and laws (characterized for being more liberal than elsewhere in Spain). However, they were defeated in 1839, and Navarre, Biscay, Álava and Gipuzkoa were integrated into the Spanish customs system. Basque industrialists profited from privatization of exploitations and the Spanish captive market with the iron ore and the Bessemer converter, and Biscay became &quot;the iron California&quot;. Workers from all of Spain were attracted to the area as labourers for the burgeoning industry.

Arana was born in a &quot;jauntxo&quot; (&quot;petty noble&quot;) family from Abando, a neighbourhood that had been recently incorporated into the city of Bilbao as the new extension for the growth of the industrial era. Abando was a Basque speaking town, but following the attitudes of the elites in the area of Bilbao during this period, Basque was not transmitted to Arana&#x27;s siblings within the family. Abando and its port were at the centre of the &quot;Zamacolada&quot; uprising against attempts by the Spanish premier Manuel Godoy to recruit Basques for the Spanish army (1804), a &quot;contrafuero&quot; or breach of basic Basque legislation.

In the aftermath of the Third Carlist War (1876), Arana attended the Jesuit School of Orduña along with his brother Luis (1876–1881). Orduña became a hotspot and meeting point for the pro-&quot;fueros&quot;, primeval Basque nationalists concerned with the loss of the Basque native institutions. Arana claimed that he had a quasi-religious revelation at Easter 1882, one that he communicated to his brother Luis Arana. From then he devoted himself to the nationalist cause of Biscay, later extended to the Basque Country.

==Basque language proponent==

He was an early proponent of the use of the Basque language in all areas of society to avoid its increasing marginalization in the face of Spanish language penetration, which was imposed as mandatory in schooling, administration and even cultural events such as theater.

Arana learned the language as a young man, and competed for a position as a Basque language professor at the &quot;Instituto de Bilbao&quot;, contending against Miguel de Unamuno and the winner, Resurrección María de Azkue who also became a scholar of the language. Arana attempted to establish a codified orthography and grammar for the Basque language, and proposed several neologisms to replace loanwords of Spanish origin.

Some of these innovations, like the characters &quot;ĺ&quot; and &quot;ŕ&quot;, were ultimately rejected in Basque language standardization efforts beginning in 1968 that led to the establishment of Standard Basque—the &quot;Euskara Batua&quot;.

== Ideology ==
His first published work was &quot;Bizkaya por su independencia&quot; (&quot;Biscay for its independence&quot;), where he calls for the independence of the Biscay district from Castile-Spain (&quot;as it was before 1200&quot;), echoing like proposals put forward by Gipuzkoa&#x27;s governmental representatives to the National Convention officials Pinet and Cavaignac in Getaria during the War of the Pyrenees (1793–1795). 

The document is a collection of historical events, mythical stories and sometimes inaccurate accounts of earlier battles of the ancient people of Biscay. Just as others nationalist ideologies were doing during the period, e.g. Spanish nationalism, Arana&#x27;s historic accounts distorted and magnified events from Basque history. 

Distancing himself from the pro-&quot;fueros&quot; advocates, Arana refused to demand a reversal of , instead putting an emphasis on the full restoration of home rule suppressed in 1839. He considered the as the act putting an end to the Basque own sources of authority and &#x27;secular Basque independence&#x27;, as well as a violation of international law.

In 1894, he founded the first center for the new nationalist party (Partido Nacionalista Vasco - Eusko Alderdi Jeltzalea), the second-oldest political party in Spain, to provide a place for gathering and proselytizing. Sabino Arana, like many Europeans of his time, believed that the essence of a country was defined by its blood or ethnic composition. In Spain, the supremacy of the Spanish race and its &quot;civilizing&quot; pursuit over peoples held to be inferior was defended by the main political figures and parties, while a number of intellectuals Spanish and even Basque, including the Socialists, advocated for the extinction of the Basque language — ever more marginalized to family and informal environments. 

He is considered by many Basques to be a gadfly that sparked the movement for the cultural revival of the Basques, and for the freedom of his people. In that respect, Arana defended the Constitutional foundations of the abolished Basque institutional and legal framework (the &quot;fueros&quot;). The PNV, the party in power in the Basque Autonomous Community from the end of Francoism (except during 2009–2012), developed along more nuanced and pragmatic lines in respect of religion and views on race, moving away from his most controversial ideas but not from his political persona.
Sabino Arana created am ideology centered on the purity of the Basque race and its alleged moral supremacy over others (a derivation of the system of &quot;limpieza de sangre&quot; of Modern-Age Spain), anti-Liberal Catholic integrism, and deep opposition to the migration of Spaniards to the Basque Country. By contrast, unlike many contemporary conservative politicians in Spain, he was against slavery in Spanish colonies such as Cuba.

He was disturbed by the migration into Biscay of many workers from western and central Spain during the Industrial Revolution, into a small territory whose native political institutions had recently been suppressed (1876), believing that their influence would result in the disappearance of the &#x27;pure&#x27; Basque race. He presented the Basque as opposed to the &quot;maketo&quot; (people from the rest of Spain):
He was a prolific writer, with over 600 journalism articles, most of them with a propaganda purpose. He liked to shock and provoke, in order to get attention from a society that he deemed unaware of its fate. There are two key aspects of Sabino Arana&#x27;s political persona:

* He was not a conventional conservative; he strongly opposed slavery (legal in Spanish-held Cuba until ten years before its independence) and defended the right of South African Zulus to their land.
* He was an indefatigable worker, taking action in many areas; he learned the Basque language as an adult, undertook a number of activities to promote the Basque language and culture, created a political movement, and inventing the symbols (flag, anthem, country name) used to this day not only by Basque nationalists, but other political parties and representatives also, especially in the Basque Autonomous Community.

Another essential part of his ideology was devout Catholicism. He considered this to be an essential part of the Basque identity that contrasted with the secularism imported from other parts of Spain and abroad along with new means of production and labour, often unprecedented internal migration. However, his Basque nationalism kept him away from Carlism that was the dominant ultra-Catholic and conservative movement in the area and the ideology of his father. 

Arana and his Basque nationalist movement were persecuted for their ideas against Spanish imperialism, for which he was convicted when he submitted a telegram to Theodore Roosevelt to congratulate him for his assistance in &#x27;liberating&#x27; Cuba in 1902, and put to harsh time in prison, which ruined his health and would die soon after. Ahead of his demise, a baffling manifesto attributed to him was released by which he relinquished the core of his ideas to everyone&#x27;s surprise. The nature of this document establishing the &quot;Liga de Vascos Españolistas&quot; (&#x27;League of the Spanish-minded Basques&#x27;) is still subject to debate as to whether he had sincerely changed his views or whether he was instead merely trying to improve the conditions of his imprisonment. Arana&#x27;s death left the question unanswered and neither his brother Luis nor the party followed through with his proposal.

==Legacy==

Sabino Arana&#x27;s ideas are considered to have spawned the Basque nationalist movement.

In 2015, a made-for-television movie called &quot;Sabin&quot; was released.
In February 2017 the People&#x27;s Party of the Basque Country called for a street named after Arana to be renamed because he “made possible the existence of phenomena such as the ETA terrorist group”.
The Partido Nacionalista Vasco has kept only the more moderate part of his message. On the other hand, some Basques still revere him as the father of the Basque nationalist movement, who managed to start the turnaround of the decay of the Basque language and culture. Many Basque cities have streets named after him.
The estate of his Abando home is now &quot;Sabin-Etxea&quot; (&quot;Sabino-House&quot;), the EAJ-PNV headquarters.

Jon Juaristi has remarked that perhaps the most influential part of his heritage is the neologistic list of Basque versions of names in his &quot;Deun-Ixendegi Euzkotarra&quot; (&quot;Basque saint-name collection&quot;, published in 1910). Instead of the traditional adaptations of Romance names, he proposed others he made up and that in his opinion were truer to the originals and adapted to the Basque phonology.

For example, his brother Luis became &quot;Koldobika&quot;, from Frankish &quot;Hlodwig&quot;. The traditional &quot;Peru&quot;, &quot;Pello&quot; or &quot;Piarres&quot; (&quot;Peter&quot;) became &quot;Kepa&quot; from Aramaic כיפא (Kepha). He believed that the suffix &quot;-[n]e&quot; was inherently feminine, and new names like &quot;Nekane&quot; (&quot;pain&quot;+&quot;ne&quot;, &quot;Dolores&quot;) or &quot;Garbine&quot; (&quot;clean&quot;+&quot;ne&quot;, &quot;Immaculate [Conception]&quot;) are frequent among Basque females. Even the name of the brother-in-law of the king of Spain is Iñaki Urdangarin, &quot;Iñaki&quot; being Arana&#x27;s alternative for Ignatius instead of the Basque traditional &quot;Inazio&quot;.

<text>The Mourne Mountains ( ; ), also called the Mournes or the Mountains of Mourne, are a predominantly granite mountain range in County Down in the south-east of Northern Ireland. They include the highest mountain in all of Ulster, Slieve Donard at . The Mournes are designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and it has been proposed to make the area Northern Ireland&#x27;s first national park. The area is partly owned by the National Trust and sees over 50,000 visitors every year. The Mourne Wall crosses fifteen of the summits and was built to enclose the catchment basin of the Silent Valley and Ben Crom reservoirs. The wall, and the area inside it, are owned by Northern Ireland Water.

==Name==
The name &#x27;Mourne&#x27; is derived from the name of a Gaelic clan or sept called the &quot;Múghdhorna&quot;. The older name of this mountainous territory was &quot;Bairrche&quot;, which is likely a collective noun derived from the Irish &quot;barr&quot;, meaning &#x27;top, peak&#x27;. This survives in the Irish name for the mountains, &quot;na Beanna Boirche&quot;, literally &quot;the peaks of the peak district&quot;. It was historically anglicized as &#x27;Bennyborfy&#x27;. The name Bairche or Boirche was also personified as the mythical shepherd of the mountains.

Many of the mountains have names beginning &quot;Slieve&quot;, from the Irish &quot;sliabh&quot;, meaning &quot;mountain&quot;.

==Mountains==
On clear days, the Mourne Mountains can be seen from the Isle of Man and Dublin.

==Other features==
The below sub-headings detail other features and visitor attractions found in the Mourne Mountains.

===The Mourne Wall===

The Mourne Wall is a dry stone wall measuring in length that crosses fifteen summits and was constructed to define and protect the catchment area purchased by Belfast Water Commissioners in the late 19th century. This followed a number of Acts of Parliament allowing the sale, and the establishment of a water supply from the Mournes to the growing industrial city of Belfast. Construction of the Mourne Wall was started in 1904 and was completed in 1922.

The Mourne Wall has been a listed building since 1996, and 600 repairs were completed in 2018 by Geda Construction.

===Forests===

Tollymore Forest Park is at Bryansford, near the town of Newcastle in the Mourne and Slieve Croob Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It covers an area of at the foot of the Mourne Mountains and has views of the surrounding mountains and the sea at nearby Newcastle. The Shimna River flows through the park where it is crossed by 16 bridges, the earliest dating to 1726. The river is a spawning ground for salmon and trout and is an Area of Special Scientific Interest for its geology, flora and fauna. The forest has four walking trails signposted by different coloured arrows, the longest being the &quot;long haul trail&quot;. The Forest Park has been managed by the Forest Service since they purchased it from the Roden Estate in 1941.

Donard Forest is near Newcastle, County Down. It borders Donard Park at the foot of the Mourne Mountains. The Glen River flows through the forest, crossed by three stone bridges.

Rostrevor Forest is near the village of Rostrevor, County Down, between the Mourne Mountains and Carlingford Lough, in the Mourne Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The first trees, primarily sitka spruce, douglas fir and pine, were planted in 1931.

===Reservoirs===

All water reservoirs are owned and maintained by Northern Ireland Water (NIW).

Silent Valley Reservoir is a reservoir in the Mourne Mountains near Kilkeel, County Down. It supplies most of the water for County Down, surrounding counties and most of Belfast via the Aquarius pipeline. The reservoir was built between 1923 and 1933 by a workforce of over one thousand men, nine of whom died during construction. The catchment area is 9,000-acres (3,600 ha / 36 km2).

Ben Crom Reservoir is upstream of Silent Valley in the Kilkeel River valley, and supplies the same areas. It was constructed between 1953 and 1957.

Spelga Reservoir is in the townland of Spelga (Irish: Speilgeach), close to Hilltown, in the North West of the Mourne Mountains. It was formed by construction of Spelga Dam and sits at over 1,200 ft (370 m) above sea level. The dam was constructed between 1953 and 1957, and has a volume of 2,700,000 cubic metres and a catchment area of 1,340-acres (542 ha / 5.423 km2).

Fofanny Dam Reservoir is approximately 2 km north-east of Spelga Dam and is much smaller.

==Flora and fauna==
Aside from grasses, the most common plants found in the Mournes are heathers and gorse. Of the former, three species are found: cross-leaved heath, bell heather, and common heather. Of the latter, two species are found: common gorse and western gorse. Other plants which grow in the area are: common cottongrass, roseroot, harebell, marsh St John&#x27;s-wort, wild thyme, wood sorrel and heath spotted orchid.

Sheep graze high into the mountains, and the range is also home to birds, including the raven, peregrine falcon, wren, buzzard, meadow pipit, grey wagtail, stonechat and snipe. The golden eagle, a former inhabitant, has not been seen in the Mournes since 1836.

==Recreation==

&quot;Discover Northern Ireland&quot;, a website operated by Tourism NI, promotes the Mourne Mountains as a popular destination for hiking and taking in views of the surrounding landscape, including local forests and the coastline. The Mournes offer a range of activities for visitors, including hiking, forest and beach walks, cycling and rock climbing, with nearly three-quarters of visitors choosing the Mournes as a place to go walking and hiking.

The Mournes are a popular destination for Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award expeditions. However, there are also a number of walking challenges which take place in the Mournes. The Mourne Wall challenge, which is also referred to as the 7-peak challenge because it takes into account 7 of the 10 highest Mourne mountains, is advertised by WalkNI. The Mourne six peak challenge is advertised by DiscoverNI and takes hikers up Slieve Donard, Commedagh, Bearnagh, Slieve Binnian, Slieve Meelmore and Slieve Meelbeg across three days of hiking.

Information and statistics on tourism to the Mournes were gathered by TourismNI in 2014. In a survey of leisure visitors, 79% were found to come from Northern Ireland, 15% from elsewhere in the British Isles or Republic of Ireland, and 5–6% were international visitors. Two-thirds of all visitors made a single-day trip rather staying overnight, and party sizes averaged between 3 and 4 people.

There are many granite cliffs, in the form of outcrops and tors, scattered throughout the range, making the Mournes one of Northern Ireland&#x27;s major rock-climbing areas since the first recorded ascents in the 1930s. The rockforms are generally quite rounded, thus often requiring cams for protection, but with good friction. The 1998 guidebook lists 26 separate crags, with a total of about 900 routes of all grades.

==Conservation==

Following a fundraising drive in 1993, the National Trust purchased nearly of land in the Mournes, which included a part of Slieve Donard (at ) and nearby Slieve Commedagh (at ), the second-highest mountain in the area.

It has been proposed that the Mourne Mountains be made Northern Ireland&#x27;s first national park. The plan has been subject to controversy because of the area&#x27;s status as private property, with over 1,000 farmers based in the proposed park, and also because of fears over the impact on local communities, bureaucracy and house prices.

==Gorse burning==
Historically, gorse had many uses in the rural economy and hill farmers often cleared gorse by hand. There is also a tradition in the Mournes of controlled gorse burning to improve grazing for sheep. Today, however, many of the fires are unmanaged and some become out-of-control wildfires. In the 1950s, Emyr Estyn Evans had written that some shepherds in the Mournes tended to burn gorse and heather recklessly. He said that such over-burning &quot;results in widespread destruction&quot; and, along with other mismanagement, had &quot;greatly impoverished the mountain environment&quot;. In the 21st century there have been hundreds of heather and gorse wildfires in the Mournes each year, the vast majority started deliberately, with &quot;farmers and vandals&quot; often blamed. It is claimed many of the wildfires are caused by hill farmers and landowners carrying out unapproved burning to clear gorse/heather and thus maximize the subsidy payments they receive for the amount of grazing-land they have. Some are also caused by careless visitors. In April 2021, more than a hundred firefighters tackled a major gorse wildfire in the eastern Mournes, which blazed for three days and devastated habitat in the area. The over-clearing of gorse, heather and trees also heightens the risk of landslides.

==Wind farm proposal==
In 2015, German-owned company ABO Wind applied to build a wind farm at Gruggandoo in the western Mourne Mountains. Its first two applications were turned down, and its revised application is to build eight turbines standing high, along with a network of access tracks, substations and a control building. The turbines would be among the tallest structures in Ireland. The company claims they could power 37% of homes in the district. There is opposition, as the wind farm would be in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and would impact wildlife and habitats. Local protest group, Mourne AONB Against Windfarms, warn it would open the door for further wind farms to be built in the Mournes and other protected areas. Planning officers for Newry, Mourne and Down District Council deem the wind farm &quot;unacceptable&quot; and recommended the council reject it. In 2020, councillors instead voted to ask for a public inquiry.

==Popular culture==
The mountains are immortalised in a song written by Percy French in 1896, &quot;The Mountains of Mourne&quot;. The song has been recorded by many artists, including Don McLean, and was quoted in Irish group Thin Lizzy&#x27;s 1979 song &quot;Roisin Dubh (Black Rose): A Rock Legend&quot;.

&quot;The Mountains of Mourne&quot; are also mentioned in John Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;The Luck of the Irish&quot; on the album &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;.

The scenery of the Mourne Mountains have also provided the backdrop for a number of productions, most famously HBO&#x27;s &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

Many local painters have depicted the mountains, including the same Percy French, who immortalized them in song.

The Mourne Mountains also influenced C. S. Lewis to create the mythical world featured in his &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; series.

==Helicopter crash==
On 23 October 2010 an AgustaWestland AW109 (tail number: N2NR) was operating a VFR flight from Enniskillen Airport to Caernarfon Airport, Wales. While en route the helicopter crashed into the western side of Shanlieve, killing all three passengers and crew on board. The cause of the accident was determined to be pilot error in heavy fog.

<doc id="519323" wikidata="Q2036192" url="?curid=519323" title="Whole Earth Catalog">
<text>The Whole Earth Catalog (WEC) was an American counterculture magazine and product catalog published by author Stewart Brand several times a year between 1968 and 1972, and occasionally thereafter, until 1998. 

The magazine featured essays and articles, but was primarily focused on product reviews. The editorial focus was on self-sufficiency, ecology, alternative education, &quot;do it yourself&quot; (DIY), and holism, and featured the slogan &quot;access to tools&quot;. While WEC listed and reviewed a wide range of products (clothing, books, tools, machines, seeds, etc.), it did not sell any of the products directly. Instead, the vendor&#x27;s contact information was listed alongside the item and its review. This is why, while not a regularly published periodical, numerous editions and updates were required to keep price and availability information up to date.

In his 2005 Stanford University commencement speech, Steve Jobs compared &quot;The Whole Earth Catalog&quot; to &quot;a sort of Google in paperback form, before Google came along.&quot;

==Origins==
The title &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot; came from a previous project by Stewart Brand. In 1966, he initiated a public campaign to have NASA release the then-rumored satellite photo of the sphere of Earth as seen from space, one of the first images of the &quot;Whole Earth&quot;. He thought the image might be a powerful symbol, evoking a sense of shared destiny and adaptive strategies from people. The Stanford-educated Brand, a biologist with strong artistic and social interests, believed that there was a groundswell of commitment to thoroughly renovating American industrial society along ecologically and socially just lines, whatever they might prove to be.

Andrew Kirk in &quot;Counterculture Green&quot; notes that the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot; was preceded by the &quot;Whole Earth Truck Store&quot; which was a 1963 Dodge truck. In 1968, Brand, who was then 29, and his wife Lois embarked &quot;on a commune road trip&quot; with the truck, hoping to tour the country doing educational fairs. The truck was not only a store, but also an alternative lending library and a mobile microeducation service.

Kevin Kelly, who would edit later editions of the catalog, summarizes the very early history this way:

The &quot;Truck Store&quot; finally settled into its permanent location in Menlo Park, California. Instead of bringing the store to the people, Brand decided to create &quot;accumulatively larger versions of his tool catalog&quot; and sell it by mail so the people could contact the vendors directly.

Using the most basic typesetting and page-layout tools, Brand and his colleagues created the first issue of &quot;The Whole Earth Catalog&quot; in 1968. In subsequent issues, its production values gradually improved. Its outsize pages measured 11×14 inches (28×36 cm). Later editions were more than an inch thick. The early editions were published by the Portola Institute, headed by Richard Raymond. The so-called &quot;Last Whole Earth Catalog&quot; (June 1971) won the first U.S. National Book Award in the Contemporary Affairs category.
It was the first time a catalog had ever won such an award. 
Brand&#x27;s intent with the catalog was to provide education and &quot;access to tools&quot; so a reader could &quot;find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested.&quot;

J. Baldwin was a young designer and instructor of design at colleges around the San Francisco Bay: San Francisco State University (then San Francisco State College), the San Francisco Art Institute, and the California College of the Arts (then California College of Arts and Crafts). As he recalled in the film &quot;Ecological Design&quot; (1994), &quot;Stewart Brand came to me because he heard that I read catalogs. He said, &#x27;I want to make this thing called a &quot;whole Earth&quot; catalog so that anyone on Earth can pick up a telephone and find out the complete information on anything. ... That&#x27;s my goal.&#x27;&quot; Baldwin served as the chief editor of subjects in the areas of technology and design, both in the catalog itself and in other publications which arose from it.

True to his 1966 vision, Brand&#x27;s publishing efforts were suffused with an awareness of the importance of ecology, both as a field of study and as an influence upon the future of humankind and emerging human awareness.

==Contents==
From the opening page of the 1969 &quot;Catalog&quot;:

The 1968 catalog divided itself into seven broad sections:

* Understanding Whole Systems
* Shelter and Land Use
* Industry and Craft
* Communications
* Community
* Nomadics
* Learning

Within each section, the best tools and books the editors could find were collected and listed, along with images, reviews and uses, prices, and suppliers. The reader was also able to order some items directly through the catalog.

Later editions changed a few of the headings, but generally kept the same overall framework.

The &quot;Catalog&quot; used a broad definition of &quot;tools&quot;. There were informative tools, such as books, maps, professional journals, courses, and classes. There were well-designed special-purpose utensils, including garden tools, carpenters&#x27; and masons&#x27; tools, welding equipment, chainsaws, fiberglass materials, tents, hiking shoes, and potters&#x27; wheels. There were even early synthesizers and personal computers.

The &quot;Catalog&quot;&#x27;s publication coincided with a great wave of convention-challenging experimentalism and a do-it-yourself attitude associated with &quot;the counterculture,&quot; and tended to appeal not only to the intelligentsia of the movement, but to creative, hands-on, and outdoorsy people of many stripes. Some of the ideas in the &quot;Catalog&quot; were developed during Brand&#x27;s visits to Drop City.

With the &quot;Catalog&quot; opened flat, the reader might find the large page on the left full of text and intriguing illustrations from a volume of Joseph Needham&#x27;s &quot;Science and Civilization in China&quot;, showing and explaining an astronomical clock tower or a chain-pump windmill, while on the right-hand page are a review of a beginners&#x27; guide to modern technology (&quot;The Way Things Work&quot;) and a review of &quot;The Engineers&#x27; Illustrated Thesaurus&quot;. On another spread, the verso reviews books on accounting and moonlighting jobs, while the recto bears an article in which people tell the story of a community credit union they founded. Another pair of pages depict and discuss different kayaks, inflatable dinghies, and houseboats.

==Publication after 1972==
The catalog was published sporadically after 1972. An important shift in philosophy in the &quot;Catalogs&quot; occurred in the early 1970s, when Brand decided that the early stance of emphasizing individualism should be replaced with one favoring &quot;community&quot;. He had originally written that &quot;a realm of intimate, personal power is developing&quot;; regarding this as important in some respects (to wit, the soon-emerging potentials of personal computing), Brand felt that the overarching project of humankind had more to do with living within natural systems, and this is something we do in common, interactively.

The broad interpretation of &quot;tool&quot; coincided with that given by the designer, philosopher, and engineer Buckminster Fuller, though another thinker admired by Brand and some of his cohorts was Lewis Mumford, who had written about words as tools. Early editions reflected the considerable influence of Fuller, particularly his teachings about &quot;whole systems,&quot; &quot;synergetics,&quot; and efficiency or reducing waste. By 1971, Brand and his co-workers were already questioning whether Fuller&#x27;s sense of direction might be too anthropocentric. New information arising in fields like ecology and biospherics was persuasive.

By the mid-1970s, much of the Buddhist economics viewpoint of E. F. Schumacher, as well as the activist interests of the biological species preservationists, had tempered the overall enthusiasm for Fuller&#x27;s ideas in the catalog. Still later, the amiable-architecture ideas of people like Christopher Alexander and similar community-planning ideas of people like Peter Calthorpe further tempered the engineering-efficiency tone of Fuller&#x27;s ideas.

The &quot;Whole Earth Epilog&quot; published in 1974 was intended as a &quot;volume 2&quot; to the &quot;Last Whole Earth Catalog&quot;, which itself was revised as &quot;The (Updated) Last Whole Earth Catalog&quot; in 1975. 

&quot;The Next Whole Earth Catalog&quot; () in 1980 was well received, and an updated second edition followed in 1981. The 1980s also saw two editions of the &quot;Whole Earth Software Catalog&quot;, a compendium for which Doubleday had bid $1.4 million for the trade paperback rights. The 1986 publication of &quot;The Essential Whole Earth Catalog&quot; () preceded the 1989 &quot;Electronic Whole Earth Catalog&quot; on CD-ROM, which used HyperCard, an early form of hypermedia developed by Apple Computer. Dedicated editions were published for communications tools &quot;Signal&quot; in 1988, new age topics &quot;The Fringes of Reason&quot; in 1989, and ecological matters &quot;Whole Earth Ecolog&quot; in 1990. 

Published in 1994, &quot;The Millennium Whole Earth Catalog&quot; () was subtitled &quot;Access to Tools and Ideas for the Twenty-First Century&quot;. 

A slender &quot;30th Anniversary Celebration&quot; was published in 1998 as part of Issue 95 of the &quot;Whole Earth&quot; magazine (), reprinting the original &quot;WEC&quot; along with new material. An important edit to this reprint was a limitation placed by book publishers who &quot;begged&quot; the Catalog not to promote titles they no longer carry. All such information was placed at the back of the catalog, hampering a valuable Catalog function: nudging publishers to keep seminal works in print.

==Publication history==
==Books==
Three books were serialized in the pages of the WEC, printing a couple of paragraphs per page. This made reading the catalog a page-by-page experience.
* &quot;Divine Right&#x27;s Trip&quot; by Gurney Norman, July 1971 edition
* &quot;Tales of Tongue Fu&quot; by Paul Krassner, October 1974 edition
* &quot;The Rising Sun Neighborhood&quot; by Anne Herbert, March 1981 edition

== Impact and legacy ==
Steve Jobs compared &quot;The Whole Earth Catalog&quot; to Internet search engine Google in his June 2005 Stanford University commencement speech. 
When I was young, there was an amazing publication called &quot;The Whole Earth Catalog&quot;, which was one of the bibles of my generation ... It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic and overflowing with neat tools and great notions. 
Then at the very end of this commencement speech Jobs quotes explicitly the farewell message placed on the back cover of the last 1974 edition of the &quot;Catalog&quot; (#1180 October 1974 titled &quot;Whole Earth Epilog&quot;) and makes it his own final recommendation: &quot;Stay hungry. Stay foolish.&quot;
In 2009, Kevin Kelly stated:

For this new countercultural movement, information was a precious commodity. In the &#x27;60s, there was no Internet; no 500 cable channels. ... [The &quot;WEC&quot;] was a great example of user-generated content, without advertising, before the Internet. Basically, Brand invented the blogosphere long before there was any such thing as a blog. ... No topic was too esoteric, no degree of enthusiasm too ardent, no amateur expertise too uncertified to be included. ... This I am sure about: it is no coincidence that the &quot;Whole Earth Catalogs&quot; disappeared as soon as the web and blogs arrived. Everything the &quot;Whole Earth Catalogs&quot; did, the web does better.

Looking back and discussing attitudes evident in the early editions of the catalog, Brand wrote, &quot;At a time when the New Left was calling for grassroots &quot;political&quot; (i.e., referred) power, &quot;Whole Earth&quot; eschewed politics and pushed grass-roots &quot;direct&quot; power—tools and skills.&quot;

As an early indicator of the general Zeitgeist, the catalog&#x27;s first edition preceded the original Earth Day by nearly two years. The idea of Earth Day occurred to Senator Gaylord Nelson, its instigator, &quot;in the summer of 1969 while on a conservation speaking tour out west,&quot; where the Sierra Club was active, and where young minds had been broadened and stimulated by such influences as the catalog.

Despite this popular and critical success, particularly among a generation of young hippies and survivalists, the catalog was not intended to continue in publication for long, just long enough for the editors to complete a good overview of the available tools and resources, and for the word, and copies, to get out to everyone who needed them.

=== Spin-offs and inspirations ===
From 1974 to 2003, the Whole Earth principals published a magazine, known originally as &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot;. When the short-lived &quot;Whole Earth Software Review&quot; (a supplement to &quot;The Whole Earth Software Catalog&quot;) failed, it was merged in 1985 with &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; to form the &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot; (edited at different points by Jay Kinney, 
Kevin Kelly, and Howard Rheingold), later called &quot;Whole Earth Magazine&quot; and finally just &quot;Whole Earth&quot;. The last issue, number 111 (edited by Alex Steffen), was meant to be published in Spring 2003, but funds ran out. The Point Foundation, which owned &quot;Whole Earth&quot;, closed its doors later that year. 

The Whole Earth website continues the &quot;WEC&quot; legacy of concepts in popular discourse, medical self-care, community building, bioregionalism, environmental restoration, nanotechnology, and cyberspace. As of January 2022, the website appears to be offline. 

Recognizing the &quot;developed country&quot; focus of the original WEC, groups in several developing countries have created &quot;catalogs&quot; of their own to be more relevant to their countries. One such effort was an adaptation of the WEC (called the &quot;Liklik Buk&quot;) written and published in the late 1970s in Papua New Guinea; by 1982 this had been enlarged, updated, and translated (as &quot;Save Na Mekem&quot;) into the Pidgin language used throughout Melanesia, and updates of the English &quot;Liklik Buk&quot; were published in 1986 and 2003.

In the United States, the book &quot;Domebook One&quot; was a direct spin-off of the WEC. Lloyd Kahn, Shelter editor of the WEC, borrowed WEC production equipment for a week in 1970 and produced the first book on building geodesic domes. A year later, in 1971, Kahn again borrowed WEC equipment (an IBM Selectric Composer typesetting machine and a Polaroid MP-5 camera on an easel), and spent a month in the Santa Barbara Mountains producing &quot;Domebook 2&quot;, which went on to sell 165,000 copies. With production of DB 2, Kahn and his company Shelter Publications followed Stewart Brand&#x27;s move to nationwide distribution by Random House.

In 1973, Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie are part of a research project at Berkeley University and publish a feminist catalog inspired by the Whole Earth Catalog, the New Woman&#x27;s Survival Catalog, which gathers feminist initiatives in different domains (art, communication, work, money, self-help, self-defense...) in the USA.

In 1969, a store which was inspired by (but not financially connected with) &quot;The Whole Earth Catalog,&quot; called the Whole Earth Access opened in Berkeley, California. It closed in 1998. In 1970 a store called the &quot;Whole Earth Provision Co.&quot;, inspired by the catalog, opened in Austin, Texas. It has six stores in Austin, Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio.

In late 2006, Worldchanging released their 600-page compendium of solutions, &quot;Worldchanging: A User&#x27;s Guide for the 21st Century&quot;, which Bill McKibben, in an article in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; called &quot;The Whole Earth Catalog retooled for the iPod generation.&quot; The editor of Worldchanging has since acknowledged the Catalog as a prime inspiration.

&quot;Whole Arctic Catalog&quot; was written by Pamela Richot and Published in &quot;Backet 3: At Extremes&quot; in 2015 to draw attention to threats to the arctic region specifically, similarly to how &quot;The Whole Earth Catalog&quot; drew attention to global environmental threats.

Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds publishes a &quot;Whole Seed Catalog,&quot; with a title and cover image inspired by the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;.

Kevin Kelly, mentioned above for his role in editing later editions of the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;, maintains a web site—Cool-Tools.org—that publishes reviews of &quot;the best/cheapest tools available. Tools are defined broadly as anything that can be useful. This includes hand tools, machines, books, software, gadgets, websites, maps, and even ideas.&quot; He also published a large format book in 2013—&quot;Cool Tools A Catalog of Possibilities&quot;—which draws on the many reviews published over the years on that web site. The format, size, and style of the book reflect and pay homage to the original &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;.

=== In popular culture ===
In 1970, on April Fool&#x27;s Day, the Whole Earth Restaurant opened at UC Santa Cruz. It was an early source of &quot;whole foods&quot; in Northern California until it closed in 2002.

In 1972 Warner Bros. Records release a 2 disc sample album &quot;The Whole Burbank Catalog&quot;. The cover parodied the publication&#x27;s artwork. 

The WEC is mentioned in the song &quot;Country Man,&quot; the title track from the 1972 debut album by Canadian musician Valdy: &quot;Feed the cat, feed the dog, feed the chickens, chop the log / Have a smoke and clear the fog, read the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;.&quot;

A 2010 issue of the political art magazine made by the Adbusters Media Foundation was titled &quot;The Whole Brain Catalog&quot;, which features a parody cover with a small human brain in place of the earth, and many references to the 1960s counter culture movement. The tagline read &quot;Access to Therapies&quot; rather than &quot;Access to Tools&quot;.

On April 17, 2018, My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James announced the release of his third solo album &quot;Uniform Distortion&quot;, which he stated was inspired by &quot;The&quot; &quot;Whole Earth Catalog.&quot;

==Scholarship==
Stewart Brand and &quot;The Whole Earth Catalog&quot; are both subjects of interest to scholars. Notable examples include works by Theodore Roszak, Howard Rheingold, Fred Turner, John Markoff, Andrew Kirk, Sam Binkley and Felicity Scott. The Stanford University Library System has a &quot;Whole Earth&quot; archive in its Department of Special Collections.

<text>The Ulster Scots people or Scots-Irish are an ethnic group descended largely from Scottish and Northern English Borders settlers who moved to the northern province of Ulster in Ireland mainly during the 17th century. There is an Ulster Scots dialect of the Scots language. 

Historically, there has been considerable population exchanges between Ireland and Scotland over the millennia. This group are found mostly in the province of Ulster, their ancestors were Protestant settlers who migrated from the Scottish Lowlands and Northern England during the Plantation of Ulster, which was a planned process of colonisation following the Tudor conquest of Ireland. The largest numbers came from Dumfries and Galloway, Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Ayrshire, Scottish Borders, Northumberland, Cumbria, Durham, Yorkshire and, to a lesser extent, from the Scottish Highlands.

Ulster Scots people, displaced through hardship, emigrated in significant numbers around in the British Empire and especially to the American colonies, later Canada and the United States. In North America, they are sometimes called &quot;Scotch-Irish&quot;, though this term is not used in the British Isles.

==History==
===Early development===
After some minor settling during the late Tudor and early Stuart periods, the first major influx of Lowland Scots and Border English Protestant settlers into Ulster came in the first two decades of the 17th century.

Before the Plantation of Ulster (and even before the Flight of the Earls), there was the 1606 independent Scottish settlement in east Down and Antrim. It was led by adventurers James Hamilton and Sir Hugh Montgomery, two Ayrshire lairds. Montgomery was granted half of Lord of Upper Clandeboye Conn McNeill O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s land, a significant Gaelic lordship in Ulster, as a reward for helping him escape from English captivity. Hamilton forced himself in on this deal when he discovered it and, after three years of bickering, the final settlement gave Hamilton and Montgomery each one-third of the land.

Starting in 1609, Scots began arriving into state-sponsored settlements as part of the Plantation of Ulster. This scheme was intended to confiscate all the lands of the Gaelic Irish nobility in Ulster and to settle the province with Protestant Scottish and English colonists. Under this scheme, a substantial number of Scots were settled, mostly in the south and west of Ulster, on confiscated land. 

While many of the Scottish planters in Ulster came from southwest Scotland, a large number came from the southeast, including the unstable regions right along the border with England (the Scottish Borders and Northumberland). These groups were from the Borderers or Border Reivers culture, which had familial links on both sides of the Anglo-Scottish border. The plan was that moving these Borderers to Ireland would both solve the Borders problem and tie down Ulster. This was of particular concern to James VI of Scotland when he became King of England, since he knew Scottish instability could jeopardise his chances of ruling both kingdoms effectively.

During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the native Irish gentry attempted to extirpate the English and Scottish settlers in revenge for being driven off their ancestral land, resulting in severe violence, massacres and ultimately leading to the deaths of between four and six thousand settlers over the winter of 1641–42. Native Irish civilians were massacred in return. By 1642, native Irish were in &quot;de facto&quot; control of much of the island under a Confederate Ireland, with about a third under the control of the opposition. However, many Ulster-Scots Presbyterians joined with the Irish in rebellion and aided them in driving the English out.

The Ulster Scots population in Ireland was probably preserved from destruction during the subsequent Irish Confederate Wars, when a Scottish Covenanter army was landed in the province to protect the Ulster-Scottish settlers from native Irish landowners. The war itself, part of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, ended in the 1650s, with the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. At the head of the army, Oliver Cromwell conquered all of Ireland. Defeating the Irish Confederates and English Royalists on behalf of the English Parliamentarians, he and his forces employed methods and inflicted casualties among the civilian Irish population that have long been commonly considered by contemporary sources, historians and the popular culture to be outside of the accepted military ethics of the day (see more on the debate here). After the Cromwellian war in Ireland was over, many of their soldiers settled permanently in eastern Ulster.

Under the Act of Settlement 1652, all Catholic-owned land was confiscated and the British Plantations in Ireland, which had been destroyed by the rebellion of 1641, were restored. However, due to the Scots&#x27; enmity to the English Parliament in the final stages of the English Civil War, English settlers rather than Scots were the main beneficiary of this scheme.

There was a generation of calm in Ireland until another war broke out in 1689, again due to political conflict closely aligned with ethnic and religious differences. The Williamite war in Ireland (1689–91) was fought between Jacobites who supported the restoration of the Catholic James II to the throne of England and Williamites who supported the Protestant William of Orange. The majority of the Protestant colonists throughout Ireland but particularly in Ulster, fought on the Williamite side in the war against the Jacobites. The fear of a repeat of the massacres of 1641, fear of retribution for religious persecution, as well as their wish to hold on to lands which had been confiscated from Catholic landowners, were all principal motivating factors.

The Williamite forces, composed of British, Dutch, Huguenot and Danish armies, as well as troops raised in Ulster, ended Jacobite resistance by 1691, confirming the Protestant minority&#x27;s monopoly on power in Ireland. Their victories at Derry, the Boyne and Aughrim are still commemorated by the Orange Order into the 21st century.

Finally, another major influx of Scots into northern Ireland occurred in the late 1690s, when tens of thousands of people fled a famine in Scotland to come to Ulster.

It was only after the 1690s that Scottish settlers and their descendants, the majority of whom were Presbyterian, gained numeric superiority in Ulster, though still a minority in Ireland as a whole. Along with Catholics, they were legally disadvantaged by the Penal Laws, which gave full rights only to members of the Church of Ireland (the Anglican state church), who were mainly Anglo-Irish (themselves often absentee landlords), native Irish converts or the descendants of English settlers. For this reason, up until the 19th century, there was considerable disharmony between Dissenters and the ruling Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. With the enforcement of Queen Anne&#x27;s 1703 Test Act, which caused further discrimination against all who did not participate in the established church, considerable numbers of Ulster-Scots migrated to the colonies in British America throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. In fact, these &#x27;Scots-Irish&#x27; from Ulster and Lowland Scotland comprised the most numerous group of immigrants from Great Britain and Ireland to the American colonies between 1717 and 1775, with over 100,000 leaving Ulster at the time.

Towards the end of the 18th century, many Ulster-Scots Presbyterians ignored religious differences and, along with many Catholic Gaelic Irish, joined the United Irishmen to participate in the Irish Rebellion of 1798 in support of republican and egalitarian ideals.

==Scotch-Irish Americans and Canadians==


Just a few generations after arriving in Ulster, considerable numbers of Ulster-Scots emigrated to the North American colonies of Great Britain. Between 1717 and 1775, over 100,000 migrated to what became the United States of America. Around the same time, the British took control of the territory of New France, allowing many Ulster-Scots to migrate to these areas as well. These people are known as the Scotch-Irish Canadians.

In the United States census of 2000, 4.3 million Americans (1.5% of the population of the United States) claimed Scotch-Irish ancestry. Author and former United States Senator Jim Webb suggests that the true number of people with some Scots-Irish heritage in the United States is higher (over 27 million) likely because contemporary Americans with some Scotch-Irish heritage may regard themselves as either Irish, Scottish, or simply American instead.

==Culture==

Over the centuries, Ulster Scots culture has contributed to the unique character of the counties in Ulster. The Ulster Scots Agency points to industry, language, music, sport, religion and myriad traditions brought to Ulster from the Scottish lowlands. In particular, the origin of country and western music was extensively from Ulster Scots folk music, in addition to English, German, and African-American styles.

The cultural traditions and aspects of this culture including its links to country music are articulated in David Hackett Fischer&#x27;s book, &quot;Albion&#x27;s Seed: Four British Folkways in America&quot;. In 2010&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Hamely Tongue&quot;, filmmaker Deaglán Ó Mocháin traces back the origins of this culture and language, and relates its manifestations in today&#x27;s Ireland. The film&#x27;s title refers to James Fenton&#x27;s book, &quot;The Hamely Tongue: A personal record of Ulster-Scots in County Antrim&quot;.

Most Ulster Scots speak Ulster English as a first language. Ulster Scots is the local dialect of the Lowland Scots language which has, since the 1980s, also been called &quot;Ullans&quot;, a portmanteau neologism popularised by the physician, amateur historian and politician Ian Adamson, merging &quot;Ulster&quot; and &quot;Lallans&quot; – the Scots for &#x27;Lowlands&#x27; – but also said to be a backronym for &#x27;Ulster-Scots language in literature and native speech&#x27;.

==Hereditary disease==
The North American ancestry of the X-linked form of the genetic disease congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus has been traced to Ulster Scots who travelled to Nova Scotia in 1761 on the ship &quot;Hopewell&quot;.

<text>Tollymore Forest Park was the first state forest park in Northern Ireland, established on 2 June 1955. It is located at Bryansford, near the town of Newcastle in the Mourne and Slieve Croob Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It covers an area of at the foot of the Mourne Mountains and has views of the surrounding mountains and the sea at nearby Newcastle. The Shimna River flows through the park where it is crossed by 16 bridges, the earliest dating to 1726. The river is a spawning ground for salmon and trout and is an Area of Special Scientific Interest due to its geology, flora and fauna.
The forest has four walking trails signposted by different coloured arrows, the longest being the &quot;long haul trail&quot; at long. It was listed in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; top twenty British picnic sites for 2000. The Forest Park has been managed by the Forest Service since they purchased it from the Roden Estate in 1941.

==History==

===Early history===
The name Tollymore (&quot;Tulaigh Mhór&quot;) is derived from &quot;large hill or mound&quot;, referring to the two hills, approximately 250 m high, which are located within the forest boundary. Their official names have been recorded as Slieve Neir (possibly from &quot;Sliabh an Aoire&quot;, meaning &quot;the mountain of the shepherd&quot;) and Slieve Snaran (from either &quot;snarvan&quot;, meaning to creep, or &quot;snarban&quot;, meaning a cataract). However, they are more commonly known as The Drinns and Curraghard, meaning &quot;ridge&quot; and &quot;marshy upland&quot; respectively.

After the Norman invasion of Ulster in 1177 and the creation of the Earldom of Ulster, the Magennis clan gained power in the area. The extended Magennis families controlled most of the land in the south of County Down by the 15th century, including the area where Tollymore is located. On 22 February 1611, Tollymore (officially referred to as Ballytollymore) was included in seven and a half townlands which were surrendered to the English crown in return for a formal freehold in the name of Brian McHugh McAghorley Magennis. The land was passed to his grandson in 1628 and when he died without issue in the 1660s, it was passed to Brian Magennis&#x27; only daughter Ellen, who was married to William Hamilton of Ayrshire.

===Hamilton family===

William Hamilton was from Lecale, County Down, and was a close relative of James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye, who acquired a large amount of land in County Down a number of years before the Plantation of Ulster. The land was passed to his son James upon his death in 1674.

Tollymore was one of the properties forfeit from the reversal of Cromwellian land settlement and the Act of Settlement 1662 by James II&#x27;s Patriot Parliament in 1689. This was likely because James Hamilton had raised a regiment in support of William of Orange and was providing the Williamites with supplies. County Down was not involved in the subsequent war.

James Hamilton died in 1701 and Tollymore was passed to his son, James, who became Viscount Limerick in 1719 and 1st Earl of Clanbrassil (second creation) in 1756.

The Hamilton family owned Tollymore until James Hamilton, William&#x27;s great grandson, died in 1798. The estate was transferred to his sister Anne and her husband, Robert Jocelyn, 1st Earl of Roden. The Jocelyn family continued ownership of Tollymore until Robert Jocelyn, 8th Earl of Roden sold it to the Ministry of Agriculture for use in the forestry industry. It was sold in two parts, the first in 1930 and the remaining in 1941.

The seat of the Roden family in Tollymore demesne, known as &#x27;Tollymore Park House&#x27; or &#x27;Bryansford House&#x27;, was a Georgian mansion built initially by James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Clanbrassil (second creation) around 1730, and was demolished in 1952.

During the 1800s, the forest contained five saw mills for processing felled trees. The mills were located on the banks of the Shimna River and powered by water. Millponds stored water, which during dry periods was released to turn the water wheels. The millponds are still located in the forest but are no longer in use.

Between 1994 and 2003, four flint artefacts were discovered in the park, close to the Shimna River. A flake, two blades and a concave scraper were found in two locations the forest. The flake, scraper and one of the blades were identified as prehistoric. The second blade was identified as Late Mesolithic or Early Neolithic. A fifth artefact, a Bronze Age barbed and tanged arrowhead, was found in a nearby field.

==Structures, follies and bridges==

Tollymore features many follies whose design were influenced by Thomas Wright of Durham, a friend of James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Clanbrassil. At the entrance and exit to the park there are Gothic gate arches built by James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Clanbrassil (Viscount Limerick). The gate and gate lodge at the exit were built in 1786 and, along with the front walling, are grade B1 listed structures. The barbican gate, also of Gothic design, is located on the main drive at the entrance to the park. It was built in 1780 and is a B+ listed building.

Clanbrassil Barn, located near the exit to the park, was built in around 1757 by James Hamilton (1st Earl of Clanbrassil). The building was designed to look like a church. A steeple containing a bell, clock and sundial was added to the east end of the building in 1789. The barn, attached Gothic gate and wall are grade B1 listed buildings. The barn functioned as a stable and store until 1971. The ground floor now contains toilets and an education room.

A granite obelisk, located on a small grassy hill near the main drive, was built between 1812 and 1820 by Robert Jocelyn, 2nd Earl of Roden as a monument to his son, James Bligh Jocelyn, who died of an asthma attack while serving in the Royal Navy.

There are numerous artificial and natural features along the Shimna River, including bridges, grottos and caves. The Hermitage is a small stone shelter designed by James Hamilton (2nd Earl of Clanbrassil) in the 1770s in memory to his friend the John Montagu, Marquess of Monthermer. It is built into the side of the gorge above the river and was used as a place for ladies to shelter while the men fished. There is an inscription in Greek within the Hermitage which translates as &quot;Clanbrassil, to his very dear friend Monthermer 1770&quot;.

The Shimna River is crossed by 16 bridges as it flows through Tollymore. The Old Bridge, built by James Hamilton in 1726, is the oldest of the current bridges. The Ivy Bridge was built in 1780 and Foley&#x27;s Bridge in 1787. Parnell Bridge, named in recognition of Sir John Parnell who visited Tollymore in the late 18th century, was constructed in 1842. It was the last stone bridge to be built in Tollymore. The more recent footbridges are constructed from wood. Horn Bridge crosses a small culverted burn (stream) and is crossed by a gravel road. The burn below the bridge is covered with a board walk connected to a path. It was built c.1770 by either the 1st or 2nd Earl.

The King&#x27;s Grave is a megalithic cairn located in the western end of the park. It is across and high and dates to 1000 - 1500 BC.

The white fort is located in the west of the park, about halfway between Parnell&#x27;s Bridge and Horne Bridge. It is a large cashel measuring 44x54 m with 3 m thick walls. The walls are approximately 2 m high but were likely more than double that when it was in use during the first millennium AD.
In 2014, the Mourne Heritage Trust carried out restoration work on 15 structures within the park including the granite monument, both gates, the hermitage, Foley&#x27;s Bridge, Horn Bridge and the Old Bridge.

==Ecology==
Tollymore contains a population of approximately 120-150 wild fallow deer, which have been in the park since the 1970s. The forest service carry out a cull of the deer once a year, to keep the population from becoming too large.

Red squirrels were first recorded in the park in 1880, although they are likely to have been present before then. A decline in numbers was noticed in 2004. A rise in grey squirrel numbers, first seen in the park approximately 10 years previously, was noted at the same time. Since then The Tollymore Red Squirrel Group, consisting of volunteers, forest service staff and members of the Mourne Heritage Trust, have been working to preserve the species within the forest by providing additional food and attempting to reduce the numbers of grey squirrels. In 2011 approximately 90% of the park&#x27;s red squirrel population were killed by squirrel pox, passed on by the grey squirrels. The following year there were only an estimated 10 to 15 red squirrels remaining. However, numbers did recover over the following 5 years. Although an approximately 50% increase in red squirrel sightings was reported during the later part of 2013, exact numbers were not known as the Tollymore Red Squirrel Group were unable to carry out their annual survey in October 2013. There was a second outbreak of squirrel pox in 2016 although it didn&#x27;t have the same fatality rate as the 2011 outbreak.

In 2007 a breeding pair of great spotted woodpeckers, which had not bred in Ireland for centuries, were recorded in Tollymore for the first time. Another breeding pair, along with juveniles, were spotted in the park in 2009 and 2010. Evidence of nesting in previous years has also been observed. Kingfishers and dippers can also be seen in the park, close to the river. A population of approximately 20-30 pairs of feral Mandarin ducks have been present on the Shimna river and on a pond within the park since 1978. Tollymore and the Shimna river are the only place in Ireland where Mandarins have been regularly recorded.

Pine martens, which are one of the rarest native mammal species in Ireland, are frequently spotted in the park by volunteers monitoring the squirrels. Badgers, foxes and otters are also present in the forest.

==Botany==

The arboretum in Tollymore was started in 1752 and is one of the oldest in Ireland. It contains trees from many different parts of the world, including the remains of a giant redwood which was struck by lightning.
The slightly milder climate in the area, due to its proximity to the coast, provided more favourable growing conditions than further inland for the more exotic trees in the arboretum.
The most common trees in the park are ash (&quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot;), beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;), birch and Oak (including &quot;Quercus robur&quot; and &quot;Quercus ilex&quot;). Larch, Sitka spruce and willow are also found in reasonable quantities. Other trees present include field maple (&quot;Acer campestre&quot;), Himalayan cedars (&quot;Cedrus deodara&quot;), coast Douglas fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii&quot;) and yew (&quot;Taxus baccata&quot;).

The slow growing spruce &quot;Picea abies&quot; &#x27;Clanbrassiliana&#x27; originated near the park in 1750. The original tree of this species is the oldest tree found in any arboretum in Ireland. Wood from the oak trees in Tollymore was used by Harland and Wolff for the interior of the RMS Titanic.

In 2011 there was an outbreak of the tree disease &quot;Phytophthora lateralis&quot;, affecting approximately 800 Lawson cypress trees over a two hector area. Felling of infected trees was carried out to prevent further spread.

Shrub species found in the park include Rhododendron, elderberry, blackberry, laurel and ivy. Lawn areas contain bent (various &quot;Agrostis&quot; species) buttercups, clover, dandelions, meadow grass and perennial reygrass (&quot;Lolium perenne&quot;). In 2012, 50 hectares of the invasive &quot;Rhododendron ponticum&quot; was removed from forests in the Mourne area, including Tollymore. The project was carried out to improve the quality of the woodland and prevent the spread of &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot;, which the species is known to host.

Algae (&quot;Nitella flexilis&quot;) and ferns (&quot;Hymenophyllum wilsonii&quot;, &quot;Phegopteris connectilis&quot;, &quot;Polystichum aculeatum&quot; and &quot;Dryopteris aemula&quot;) are also common.
Other plant species include:

* &quot;Acaena ovalifolia&quot;, an invasive &quot;Acaena&quot; species which is now illegal to plant in the wild in Northern Ireland.
* &quot;Acaena novae-zelandiae&quot;, an invasive plant native to Australia and New Zealand.
* &quot;Prunus padus&quot;, also known as Bird Cherry.
* &quot;Rosa arvensis&quot;, also known as the Field Rose or Trailing Rose.
* &quot;Circaea × intermedia&quot;, a hybrid of &quot;Circaea alpina&quot; and &quot;Circaea lutetiana&quot;
* &quot;Pyrola minor&quot;, a flowering plant also known as snowline, lesser or common wintergreen. 
* &quot;Scrophularia auriculata&quot;, a perennial plant found near the edges of rivers or ponds.
* &quot;Mimulus moschatus&quot;, a flowering plant native to western North America
* &quot;Melampyrum pratense&quot;, a herbaceous plant also known as common cow-wheat.
* &quot;Lathraea squamaria&quot;, also known as common toothwort.
* &quot;Pinguicula lusitanica&quot;, also known as pale butterwort
* &quot;Mentha gentilis&quot;, a hybrid mint plant.
* &quot;Sambucus ebulus&quot;, a herbaceous species of elder.
* &quot;Erigeron karvinskianus&quot;, wildflower native to South America and Mexico.
* A number of species of hawkweed (&quot;Hieracium senescens&quot;, &quot;Hieracium argenteum&quot;, &quot;Hieracium duriceps&quot;, &quot;Hieracium grandidens&quot;, &quot;Hieracium stewartii&quot;)
* &quot;Neottia nidus-avis&quot;, also known as Bird&#x27;s-nest orchid
* A number of species of sedge (&quot;Carex laevigata&quot;, &quot;Carex pallescens&quot;, &quot;Carex pilulifera&quot;)
* &quot;Festuca altissima&quot;, a species of grass belonging to the genus &quot;Festuca&quot;.
* &quot;Melica uniflora&quot;, a species of grass also known as wood melick.
* &quot;Milium effusum&quot;, a species of grass also known as American milletgrass or Wood millet.

==Uses==

===Recreation===
The park has designated areas for camping and caravans.

There are four official walking trails within the forest each marked with different coloured sign posts. All the trails start and end in the main car park. The blue tail (Arboretum Path) is half a mile long and passes through the arboretum. The red tail (River Trail) is three miles long and follows the Shimna River up one side as far as Parnell&#x27;s bridge and then back along the other side. The black trail (Mountain Trail) is five and half miles long and the black trail 1 (The Drinns Trail) adds another three miles to the black trail by passing behind The Drinns (two forested hills) and following the boundary wall. The Ulster Way also passes through the forest.

===Filming===
The forest has been used as a filming location for the TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and the film &quot;Dracula Untold&quot;.

<doc id="519342" wikidata="Q2734353" url="?curid=519342" title="Kareem Rush">
<text>Kareem Lamar Rush (born October 30, 1980) is an American former professional basketball player. Rush&#x27;s younger brother, Brandon, last played for the Minnesota Timberwolves, while older brother JaRon played college basketball for UCLA.

==College career==
After graduating from Pembroke Hill School in Kansas City, Rush attended the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, where he was a standout guard on the basketball team. Rush averaged 19.8 points per game as a junior, leading the Tigers to the Western Regional finals in the NCAA tournament, where they lost to Oklahoma. As a sophomore in 2000–01, he led the Big 12 in scoring, averaging 21.1 points per game. During this time, Rush worked with world-renowned conditioning coach Istvan Javorek.

==Professional career==
===Los Angeles Lakers (2002–2004)===
Rush entered the 2002 NBA draft after his junior season and was selected with the 20th pick overall by the Toronto Raptors, who immediately traded his rights to the Los Angeles Lakers. Rush was projected to be a top 10 pick, but much like what happened to Kareem&#x27;s elder brother JaRon—a former UCLA star—Kareem slipped down much further than anticipated. At the 2000 draft, JaRon, who left the Bruins after his sophomore season, was not selected. &quot;No one wants to see something like that happen to his brother&quot;, JaRon said, weeping. &quot;I mean, I knew he was going to get drafted eventually, but it was still hard.&quot;

Over his first two seasons, he played a limited, back-up role on the Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant-led club. However, due to his three-point shooting accuracy, he would become a more frequently used reserve player in the 2003–2004 playoffs for coach Phil Jackson. Although the Lakers would lose to the Pistons in the NBA Finals, Rush was able to make somewhat of a name for himself as a sharpshooter, averaging 14 minutes per game and hitting 40% of his three-point shots in the playoffs. He was a major contributor in helping the Lakers clinch the Western Conference Finals against Kevin Garnett and the Minnesota Timberwolves, when he scored 18 points in the sixth and final game, all from 3-point range, where he was 6 for 7.

===Charlotte Bobcats (2004–2006)===
Fourteen games into the 2004–05 season, the Lakers traded Rush to the Charlotte Bobcats for two future second-round draft picks. In Charlotte, Rush found a larger role, often starting and averaging more than 25 minutes and 11.5 points per game. He set a then-Bobcats franchise record by scoring 35 points against the Indiana Pacers. His season ended March 2 when he strained his MCL during a game in New Orleans.

===Seattle SuperSonics (2006)===
During the 2006–07 offseason, Rush signed with the Seattle SuperSonics, but recovered slowly from a groin injury. In November 2006, the club waived him to make room for a replacement for two frontcourt players who had sustained injuries.

===Lithuania (2006–2007)===
Rush spent the next season playing in Lithuania. On December 21, 2006, he signed with ULEB Cup participant Lietuvos rytas from Vilnius. He was chosen by the Slovenian coach Zmago Sagadin and led his team to the cup final. On February 24, 2007, Rush was named the MVP of the 2007 LKL All-Star Game. On April 21, Rush&#x27;s team became the champion of the Baltic Basketball League; he was named the Final Four MVP.

===Indiana Pacers (2007–2008)===
On July 3, 2007, Rush signed with the Indiana Pacers, who cited their need for a shooter.

===Philadelphia 76ers (2008–2009)===
On July 28, 2008, Rush signed a deal with the Philadelphia 76ers.

===Los Angeles Clippers (2009–2010)===
Rush eventually signed for the Los Angeles Clippers, because of injuries to other players on the roster. However, Rush himself suffered an ACL tear in his right knee on November 18, 2009. The day before his ACL tear would end up being his final NBA game ever. On November 17, 2009, the Clippers would lose to the New Orleans Hornets 102 - 110 with Rush only playing for less than 2 minutes and recording no stats.

Rush was waived by the Clippers on January 22, 2010.

===Los Angeles D-Fenders (2012)===
On March 12, 2012, Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA D-League acquired Rush.

===Los Angeles Slam (2012–2013)===
For the 2012–13 season, Rush played for the Los Angeles Slam of the ABA.

===Los Angeles D-Fenders (2013–2014)===
In November 2013, he was re-acquired by the Los Angeles D-Fenders.

On January 22, 2014, Rush left the D-Fenders, citing his desire to formally retire from basketball.

===BIG3 Basketball (2017)===
In 2017, Rush joined the BIG3 basketball league, playing on a talent-stacked 3 Headed Monsters roster, highlighted by head coach (and NBA Hall of Famer) Gary Payton, as well as Kwame Brown (the first ever directly-from-high-school player to go #1 overall in the NBA draft), Rashard Lewis, Jason Williams, and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf.

=== North American Premier Basketball (2018–present)===
In January 2018, he signed with the Kansas City Tornados of the first-year North American Premier Basketball.

<doc id="519343" wikidata="Q2279698" url="?curid=519343" title="Transcendental idealism">
<text>Transcendental idealism is a philosophical system founded by German philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 18th century. Kant&#x27;s epistemological program is found throughout his &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; (1781). By &quot;transcendental&quot; (a term that deserves special clarification) Kant means that his philosophical approach to knowledge transcends mere consideration of sensory evidence and requires an understanding of the mind&#x27;s innate modes of processing that sensory evidence.

In the &quot;Transcendental Aesthetic&quot; section of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason,&quot; Kant outlines how space and time are pure forms of human intuition contributed by our own faculty of sensibility. Space and time do not have an existence &quot;outside&quot; of us, but are the &quot;subjective&quot; forms of our sensibility and hence the necessary &quot;a priori&quot; conditions under which the objects we encounter in our experience can appear to us at all. Kant describes time and space not only as &quot;empirically real&quot; but &quot;transcendentally ideal.&quot;

Kant argues that the conscious subject recognizes the objects of experience not as they are in themselves, but only the way they appear to us under the conditions of our sensibility. This fits his model of perception outlined at the outset of the &quot;Transcendental Aesthetic&quot; by which he distinguishes the empirical reality of appearances studied by the empirical sciences from the noumenal reality of things as they are in themselves, independent of empirical observation. Thus Kant&#x27;s doctrine restricts the scope of our cognition to appearances given to our sensibility and denies that we can possess cognition of things as they are in themselves, i.e. things as they are independently of how we experience them through our cognitive faculties.

== Background ==
Although it influenced the course of subsequent German philosophy dramatically, exactly how to interpret this concept was a subject of some debate among 20th century philosophers. Kant first described it in his &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; and distinguished his view from contemporary views of realism and idealism, but it remains the case that philosophers do not agree on how sharply Kant differs from each of these positions.

Transcendental idealism is associated, if not identified, with the &quot;formalistic idealism&quot; Kant discusses in his &quot;Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics&quot;, although recent research has tended to dispute this identification. Transcendental idealism was also adopted as a label by the subsequent German philosophers Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, Arthur Schopenhauer, and in the early 20th century by Edmund Husserl in the novel form of transcendental-phenomenological idealism.

== Kant&#x27;s transcendental idealism ==
Kant presents an account of how we intuit () objects and accounts of space and of time. Before Kant, some thinkers, such as Leibniz, had come to the conclusion that space and time were not things, but only the relations among things. Contrary to thinkers, including Newton, who maintained that space and time were real things or substances, Leibniz had arrived at a radically different understanding of the universe and the things found in it. According to his &quot;Monadology&quot;, all things that humans ordinarily understand as interactions between and relations among individuals (such as their relative positions in space and time) have their being in the mind of God but not in the Universe where we perceive them to be. In the view of realists, individual things interact by physical connection and the relations among things are mediated by physical processes that connect them to human brains and give humans a determinate chain of action to them and correct knowledge of them.

Kant was aware of problems with both of these positions. He had been influenced by the physics of Newton and understood that there is a physical chain of interactions between things perceived and the one who perceives them. However, an important function of mind is to structure incoming data and to process it in ways that make it other than a simple mapping of outside data. Martin says:
The salient element here is that space and time, rather than being real &quot;things-in-themselves&quot; or empirically mediated appearances (), are the very forms of intuition () by which we must perceive objects. They are hence neither to be considered properties that we may attribute to objects in perceiving them, nor substantial entities of themselves. They are in that sense subjective, yet necessary, preconditions of any given object insofar as this object is an appearance and not a &quot;thing-in-itself&quot;. Humans necessarily perceive objects as located in space and in time. This condition of experience is part of what it means for a human to cognize an object, to perceive and understand it as something both spatial and temporal: &quot;By &quot;transcendental idealism&quot; I mean the doctrine that appearances are to be regarded as being, one and all, representations only, not things in themselves, and that time and space are therefore only sensible forms of our intuition...&quot; Kant argues for these several claims in the section of the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; entitled the &quot;Transcendental Aesthetic&quot;. That section is devoted to inquiry into the &quot;a priori&quot; conditions of human sensibility, i.e. the faculty by which humans intuit objects. The following section, the &quot;Transcendental Logic&quot;, concerns itself with the manner in which objects are thought.

== Schopenhauer ==
Schopenhauer takes Kant&#x27;s transcendental idealism as the starting point for his own philosophy, which he presents in &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;. Schopenhauer described transcendental idealism briefly as a &quot;distinction between the phenomenon and the thing in itself&quot;, and a recognition that only the phenomenon is accessible to us because &quot;we know neither ourselves nor things as they are in themselves, but merely as they appear.&quot; In volume 1 of the &quot;Parerga and Paralipomena&quot; (&quot;Fragments for the History of Philosophy&quot;), Schopenhauer writes:

Further on in §13, Schopenhauer says of Kant&#x27;s doctrine of the ideality of space and time: &quot;Before Kant, it may be said, we were in time; now time is in us. In the first case, time is &quot;real&quot; and, like everything lying in time, we are consumed by it. In the second case, time is &quot;ideal&quot;; it lies within us.&quot; 

Schopenhauer contrasted Kant&#x27;s transcendental critical philosophy with Leibniz&#x27;s dogmatic philosophy. 

== P. F. Strawson ==
In &quot;The Bounds of Sense&quot;, P. F. Strawson suggests a reading of Kant&#x27;s first &quot;Critique&quot; that, once accepted, forces rejection of most of the original arguments, including transcendental idealism. Strawson contends that, had Kant followed out the implications of all that he said, he would have seen that there were many self-contradictions implicit in the whole.

Strawson views the analytic argument of the &quot;transcendental deduction&quot; as the most valuable idea in the text, and regards transcendental idealism as an unavoidable error in Kant&#x27;s greatly productive system. In Strawson&#x27;s traditional reading (also favored in the work of Paul Guyer and Rae Langton), the Kantian term phenomena (literally, things that can be seenfrom Greek: &quot;phainomenon&quot;, &quot;observable&quot;) refers to the world of appearances, or the world of &quot;things&quot; sensed. They are tagged as &quot;phenomena&quot; to remind the reader that humans confuse these derivative appearances with whatever may be the forever unavailable &quot;things in themselves&quot; behind our perceptions. The necessary preconditions of experience, the components that humans bring to their apprehending of the world, the forms of perception such as space and time, are what make &quot;a priori&quot; judgments possible, but all of this process of comprehending what lies fundamental to human experience fails to bring anyone beyond the inherent limits of human sensibility. Kant&#x27;s system requires the existence of noumena to prevent a rejection of external reality altogether, and it is this concept (senseless objects of which we can have no real understanding) to which Strawson objects in his book.

== Henry E. Allison ==
In &quot;Kant&#x27;s Transcendental Idealism&quot;, Henry E. Allison proposes a new reading that opposes, and provides a meaningful alternative to, Strawson&#x27;s interpretation. Allison argues that Strawson and others misrepresent Kant by emphasising what has become known as the two-worlds reading (a view developed by Paul Guyer). This—according to Allison, false—reading of Kant&#x27;s phenomena/noumena distinction suggests that phenomena and noumena are ontologically distinct from each other. It concludes on that basis that we somehow fall short of knowing the noumena due to the nature of the very means by which we comprehend them. On such a reading, Kant would himself commit the very fallacies he attributes to the transcendental realists. On Allison&#x27;s reading, Kant&#x27;s view is better characterized as a two-aspect theory, where noumena and phenomena refer to complementary ways of considering an object. It is the dialectic character of knowing, rather than epistemological insufficiency, that Kant wanted most to assert.

Allison&#x27;s two-aspect interpretation also serves as an at least partially successful defense of transcendental idealism, particularly within anglophone analytic philosophy. Although his interpretive position is contested among Kant scholars, including Anja Jauernig in her 2021 monograph &quot;The World According to Kant&quot;, Allison&#x27;s &quot;Kant&#x27;s Transcendental Idealism&quot; uncontroversially helped start the late-20th century revival of contemporary interest in Kant&#x27;s metaphysical, or as Allison describes it &#x27;metaepistemological&#x27;, transcendental idealism.

== Opposing views: Naïve realism ==
Opposing Kantian transcendental idealism is the doctrine of naïve realism, that is, the proposition that the world is knowable as it really is, without any consideration of the knower&#x27;s manner of knowing. This has been propounded by philosophers such as Hilary Putnam, John Searle, and Henry Babcock Veatch. Naïve or direct realism claims, contrary to transcendental idealism, that perceived objects exist in the way that they appear, in and of themselves, independent of a knowing spectator&#x27;s mind. Kant referred to this view as &quot;transcendental realism,&quot; which he defined as purporting the existence of objects in space and time independent from our sensibility.

<doc id="519350" wikidata="Q11363" url="?curid=519350" title="Screamo">
<text>Screamo (also referred to as skramz) is a subgenre of emo that emerged in the early 1990s and emphasizes &quot;willfully experimental dissonance and dynamics&quot;. San Diego–based bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow pioneered the genre in the early 1990s, and it was developed in the late 1990s mainly by bands from the East Coast of the United States such as Pg. 99, Orchid, Saetia, and I Hate Myself. Screamo is strongly influenced by hardcore punk and characterized by the use of screamed vocals. Lyrical themes usually include emotional pain, death, romance, and human rights. The term &quot;screamo&quot; has frequently been mistaken as referring to any music with screaming.

==Terminology==
While the genre was developing in the early 1990s, it was not initially called &quot;screamo.&quot; Chris Taylor, lead vocalist for the band Pg. 99, said &quot;we never liked that whole screamo thing. Even during our existence, we tried to venture away from the fashion and tell people, &#x27;Hey, this is punk.&#x27;&quot; Jonathan Dee of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the term &quot;tends to bring a scornful laugh from the bands themselves.&quot; Lars Gotrich of NPR Music made the following comment on the matter in 2011:

In the 2000s, the term &quot;screamo&quot; began being used loosely to describe any use of human vocal instrument growled-word vocals (commonly termed screamed vocals) in music. It has been applied to a wide variety of genres unrelated to the original screamo scene. Juan Gabe, vocalist for the band Comadre, alleged that the term &quot;has been kind of tainted in a way, especially in the States.&quot; Derek Miller, guitarist for the band Poison the Well, noted the term&#x27;s constant differing usages and jokingly stated that it &quot;describes a thousand different genres.&quot; Bert McCracken, lead singer of The Used, stated that screamo is merely a term &quot;for record companies to sell records and for record stores to categorize them.&quot;

==History==
===Origins (1990s)===
Around 1990 and 1991, a number of bands began pushing the sound of early emo into more extreme and chaotic territory. The earliest of these acts were New Jersey&#x27;s Iconoclast and Merel, however the most influential acts were those from San Diego and signed to Gravity Records. In particular, Heroin are the band generally cited as either pioneering screamo or being the band that inspired the earliest acts in the genre, with other notable bands from the city, including Angel Hair, Antioch Arrow and Swing Kids. These early San Diego screamo bands were sometimes called &quot;spock rock&quot; by fans due to many of them dyeing their hair black and cutting straight fringes similar to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; character Spock. This, in combination with their geek-chic style of dressing would prove particularly influential on the development of the subsequent emo and scene subcultures.

In New Jersey, the genre continued to grow, soon expanding into New York City. Native Nod, Rye Coalition, 1.6 Band, and Rorschach all became prominent in this scene, which was centred around ABC No Rio, while the sound expanded to elsewhere in the United States with Universal Order of Armageddon (from Baltimore) and Mohinder (from Cupertino, California). In San Francisco, Portraits of Past were one of the earliest groups to merge the primitive screamo sound with post-rock, a combination that Funeral Diner would then continue, while also embracing the influence of black metal.

At the same time, many bands in the southern United States began pushing the early screamo sound even further sonically. Columbia, South Carolina band In/Humanity coined the term &quot;emoviolence&quot; to describe this sound, played by them, as well as Florida bands Palatka and the End of the Century Party. When coined, the term was a tongue in cheek portmanteau of &quot;emo&quot; and &quot;powerviolence&quot;, two genre descriptions the members of In/Humanity maligned, as well as a reference to the album &quot;Emotional Violence&quot; by funk band Cameo, however as subsequent bands took influence from the sound of these groups, the term became increasingly widespread.

Towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s, Virginia developed a large and influential screamo scene: Pg. 99, who continued in the extreme and chaotic screamo sound; City of Caterpillar, who were one of the most influential early bands to merge screamo with post-rock; Majority Rule who merged the genre with metalcore; and Malady who merged post-inflected screamo with indie rock. All of which released albums which &quot;BrooklynVegan&quot; writer Andrew Sacher called essential albums in the genre. One of the most influential bands to come from the New York City screamo scene was Saetia, who formed in 1997 and created a sound influenced by math rock, jazz and Midwest emo. Following Saetia&#x27;s 1999 disbandment, its members formed the similarly influential bands Off Minor and Hot Cross. Other impactful groups in the genre at this time included Jeromes Dream, Neil Perry, I Hate Myself, Reversal of Man, Yaphet Kotto and Orchid.

===Mainstream crossover (2000s)===

By 1995, the term &quot;screamo&quot; drifted into the music press, especially in the journalism of Jim DeRogatis and Andy Greenwald. Following the release of their 2001 album &quot;Full Collapse&quot;, New Jersey&#x27;s Thursday were the first screamo–influenced band to gain significant media attention. The following year, saw the release of Canada&#x27;s Alexisonfire&#x27;s self-titled album, which &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; writer Matt Mills called &quot;key in legitimising the screamo sound&quot;. In the following years, the Used, Thrice, Finch and Silverstein all gained significant attention for furthering this sound. In contrast to the do-it-yourself screamo bands of the 1990s, screamo bands such as Thursday and the Used signed multi-album contracts with labels such as Island Def Jam and Reprise Records. However, this style&#x27;s connection to the genre has been disputed, with some referring to it as &quot;&quot;MTV&quot; screamo&quot; or &quot;pop-screamo&quot;, and many bands more commonly being categorized as post-hardcore or metalcore.

In the underground screamo scene, post-rock became an increasingly prominent influence amongst bands. The most prominent and influential of these acts was Richmond, Virginia&#x27;s City of Caterpillar, who &quot;Vice&quot; writer Jason Heller stated &quot;encompass [the] era&quot;. Music critics coined the term &quot;post-screamo&quot; to refer to this sound. Other prominent acts making this sound at the time included Circle Takes the Square, Raein, Envy and Daïtro. Fluff Fest, held in Czechia since 2000, was in 2017 described by Bandcamp Daily as a &quot;summer ritual&quot; for many fans of screamo in Europe.

=== Revival (2010s) ===

In the early 2010s the term &quot;screamo&quot; began to be largely reclaimed by a new crop of do-it-yourself bands, with many screamo acts, like Loma Prieta, Pianos Become the Teeth, La Dispute, and Touché Amoré releasing records on fairly large independent labels such as Deathwish Inc. In 2011 &quot;Alternative Press&quot; noted that La Dispute is &quot;at the forefront of a traditional-screamo revival&quot; for their critically acclaimed release &quot;Wildlife&quot;. They are a part of a group of stylistically similar screamo-revival bands self-defined as &quot;The Wave,&quot; made up of Touché Amoré, La Dispute, Defeater, Pianos Become the Teeth, and Make Do and Mend. As well as, California&#x27;s Deafheaven, who formed in 2010, having been described as screamo, in a style similar to that of Envy. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; has cited a &quot;pop screamo revival&quot; along with this, with bands like Before Their Eyes, the Ongoing Concept, Too Close to Touch and I Am Terrified.

In August 2018, &quot;Noisey&quot; writer Dan Ozzi declared that it was the &quot;Summer of Screamo&quot; in a month-long series documenting screamo acts pushing the genre forward following the decline in popularity of &quot;The Wave,&quot; as well as the reunions of seminal bands such as Pg. 99, Majority Rule, City of Caterpillar, and Jeromes Dream. Groups highlighted in this coverage, including Respire, Ostraca, Portrayal of Guilt, Soul Glo, I Hate Sex, and Infant Island, had generally received positive press from large publications, but were not as widely successful as their predecessors. &quot;Noisey&quot; also documented that, despite its loss of mainstream popularity and continued hold in North American scenes, particularly Richmond, Virginia, screamo had become a more international movement; notably spreading to Japan, France, and Sweden with groups including Heaven in Her Arms, Birds in Row and Suis La Lune, respectively. Also in 2018, Vein released their debut album &quot;Errorzone&quot; to critical acclaim and commercial success, bringing together elements of screamo, hardcore, and nu metal. This underground cohort of acts was primarily released by independent labels like Middle-Man Records in the United States, Zegema Beach Records in Canada, and Miss The Stars Records in Berlin.

Screamo is a style of hardcore punk-influenced emo with screaming. Alex Henderson of AllMusic considers screamo a bridge between hardcore punk and emo. The term screamo is a portmanteau of the words &quot;scream&quot; and &quot;emo&quot;. Screamo uses typical rock instrumentation, but is notable for its brief compositions, chaotic sounds, harmonized guitars, and screaming vocals. Screamo is characterized &quot;by frequent shifts in tempo and dynamics and by tension-and-release catharses.&quot; Many screamo bands also incorporate ballads. According to AllMusic, screamo is &quot;generally based in the aggressive side of the overarching punk-revival scene.&quot; Screamed vocals are used &quot;not consistently, but as a kind of crescendo element, a sonic weapon to be trotted out when the music and lyrics reach a particular emotional pitch.&quot; Emotional singing and harsh screaming are common vocals in screamo.

Screamo lyrics often feature topics such as emotional pain, breakups, romantic interest, politics, and human rights. These lyrics are usually introspective, similar to that of softer emo bands. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;part of the music&#x27;s appeal is its un-self-conscious acceptance of differences, respect for otherness.&quot; Some screamo bands openly demonstrate acceptance of religious, nonreligious, and straight edge lifestyles

Many screamo bands in the 1990s saw themselves as implicitly political, and as a reaction against the turn to the right embodied by California politicians, such as Roger Hedgecock. Some groups were also unusually theoretical in inspiration: Angel Hair cited surrealist writers Antonin Artaud and Georges Bataille, and Orchid lyrically name-checked French new wave icon Anna Karina, German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, French philosopher Michel Foucault, and critical theory originators the Frankfurt School.

==Subgenres and fusion genres==
===Emoviolence===

Some screamo bands borrow the extreme dissonance, speed, and chaos of powerviolence. As a result, the term emoviolence was half-jokingly coined by the band In/Humanity to describe the fusion of the two styles which applied to themselves, as well as other bands including Pg. 99, Orchid, Reversal of Man, Usurp Synapse, and RentAmerica. Additionally, bands such as Orchid, Reversal of Man, and Circle Takes the Square tend to be much closer in style to grindcore than their forebears. In contemporary times, the genre is no longer as prevalent or widespread as it had been in the past, yet it still remains as a notable and prevalent force in underground screamo. A revival of the genre has occurred internationally with regional scenes in Southeast Asia and South America taking prominence.

===Post-screamo===
Bands including City of Caterpillar, Circle Takes the Square, Envy, Funeral Diner, Pianos Become the Teeth, Respire, and Le Pré Où Je Suis Mort have incorporated post-rock elements into their music. This fusion is characterized by abrupt changes in pace, atmospheric and harmonic instrumentation, and distorted vocals. Similarly, bands such as Heaven in Her Arms and the aforementioned group Envy, use elements of shoegazing.

===Sass===
Sass (, also known as white belt hardcore, sassy screamo or dancey screamo) is a style that emerged from the late-1990s and early-2000s screamo scene. The genre incorporates elements of post-punk, new wave, disco, electronic, dance-punk, grindcore, noise rock, metalcore, mathcore and beatdown hardcore. The genre is characterized by overtly flamboyant mannerisms, homoerotic lyrical content, synthesizers, dance beats and a lisping vocal style. Sass bands include the Blood Brothers, An Albatross, The Number Twelve Looks Like You, the Plot to Blow Up the Eiffel Tower, early Daughters, later-Orchid and SeeYouSpaceCowboy.

===Pop screamo===
&quot;Pop screamo&quot; and &quot;MTV screamo&quot; are terms used to describe screamo influenced bands who use metallic instrumentation and pop song structure to form a more commercially viable sound than traditional screamo. The style developed and gained mainstream success in the early-2000s. The scene was led by bands such as Thursday, Hawthorne Heights, Taking Back Sunday, The Used, Senses Fail, Silverstein, Chiodos, From First to Last, Saosin, Thrice and Finch and now-defunct less-known bands such as Before Their Eyes, Here I Come Falling, Agraceful, Yesterdays Rising, Chasing Victory, Beloved, Dead Poetic, Burden of a Day and Sever Your Ties. The genre had a revival in the 2010s, including such outfits as Before Their Eyes, The Ongoing Concept, Too Close to Touch, I Am Terrified. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; describes pop screamo as &quot;metal-influenced riffs and aggressive, high-end screams filled song&#x27;s verses, while soaring melodies carried choruses to new, previously unattained heights.&quot; as well as &quot;Poppy emo music with screaming in it that captured mainstream attention in the mid-2000s&quot;. Furthermore, many of these groups are more commonly categorized as, and influenced by, post-hardcore or metalcore.

<text>Harry Austryn Wolfson (November 2, 1887 – September 19, 1974) was an American scholar, philosopher, and historian at Harvard University, and the first chairman of a Judaic Studies Center in the United States. He is known for his seminal work on the Jewish philosopher Philo, but he also authored an astonishing variety of other works on Crescas, Maimonides, Averroes, Spinoza, the Kalam, the Church Fathers, and the foundations of Western religion. He collapsed the artificial barriers that isolated the study of Christian philosophy from Islamic philosophy and from Jewish philosophy . Being the first Judaica scholar to progress through an entire career at a top-tier university , in Wolfson is also represented the fulfillment of the goals of the 19th-century &quot;Wissenschaft des Judentums&quot; movement.

== Biography ==
Wolfson was born to Sarah Savitsky and Max Mendel Wolfson in Astryna (Yiddish: Ostrin), Vilna Governorate (in present-day Shchuchyn district, Grodno Region, Belarus), and in his youth he studied at the Slabodka yeshiva under Rabbi Moshe Mordechai Epstein. He emigrated to the U.S. with his family in 1903. They settled in New York&#x27;s East Side. Wolfson was invited to teach Hebrew to children in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which he did for three years while earning his diploma from Scranton High School. Wolfson took the entrance examination for Harvard College and won admission. 

In September 1908, Wolfson arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts to attend Harvard University, where, it would turn out, he would remain for the rest of his career. He earned his Bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1911, Master&#x27;s in 1912, and Ph.D. in 1915. His only absences were the years 1912–1914, when he held a traveling fellowship from Harvard which enabled him to study and do research in Europe, and some months in 1918 when he was conscripted into the Army, and together with Norbert Wiener received basic training at Fort Slocum, New York, and was then transferred to the Adjutant General&#x27;s Office in Washington, D.C..

Wolfson was offered an appointment as annual instructor in Jewish philosophy and Literature at Harvard University in 1915, provided he could find outside funding for his salary, which judges Julian Mack and Irving Lehman took responsibility for. He was promoted to faculty instructor and then Assistant Professor in 1921. In 1925 his position was to be terminated unless he could obtain permanent outside funding. Lucius Littauer stepped up and endowed him a permanent chair in his father&#x27;s honor, the Nathan Littauer Professor of Hebrew Literature and Philosophy. Wolfson was the first professor in any American university to occupy a chair devoted solely to Jewish studies.

Wolfson held the chair from 1925 until his retirement in 1958. He was a student and friend both of George Santayana and George Foot Moore. R.D. Crouse, the scholar of early medieval theology, was among his students. He received honorary degrees from 10 different universities , and was a founding member and president of the American Academy for Jewish Research. Wolfson never married. He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts on September 19, 1974. His brother Nathan survived him by 27 years, living to age 101 until 2001. Another notable family member was his nephew Erwin S. Wolfson who developed the Pan Am Building in Manhattan in 1960.

==Works==

Wolfson was a tireless scholar. About him writes, &quot;He was reminiscent of an old-fashioned &quot;gaon&quot;, transposed into a modern university setting, studying day and night, resisting presumptive attractions and distractions, honors and chores, with a tenacity which sometimes seemed awkward and antisocial.&quot; He spent vast amounts of time secluded in the Widener Library pursuing his research. writes that even in his retirement, Wolfson was &quot;still the first person to enter Widener library in the morning and the last to leave it at night.&quot;

Wolfson wrote works including a translation and commentary on Hasdai Crescas&#x27; &quot;Or Adonai&quot;, the philosophy of the church fathers, the repercussions of the Kalam on Judaism, and works on Spinoza, Philo, and Averroes. The best-known of these works are listed below, their publication in several instances—among them the work on Philo—having been considered scholarly events of the first magnitude.

Wolfson was additionally known as a &quot;daring&quot; scholar, one who was not afraid to put forward a bold hypothesis with limited evidential support. In his work Wolfson therefore often chooses bold conjecture over safe, but boring, analyses .

=== Books ===

* &quot;Crescas&#x27; Critique of Aristotle: Problems of Aristotle&#x27;s Physics in Jewish and Arabic philosophy&quot; (1929)
* &quot;The Philosophy of Spinoza: Unfolding the Latent Processes of His Reasoning&quot;, Harvard University Press (1934/1962). 
* &quot;Philo: Foundations of Religious Philosophy in Judaism, Christianity and Islam&quot;, Harvard University Press (1947). Until the publication of this book, Philo had been considered no more than a preacher with a philosophic bent. Wolfson showed that behind the philosophic utterances scattered throughout Philo&#x27;s writings there lay a coherent philosophic system. Wolfson went even further, claiming that Philo was the founder of religious philosophy in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and that &quot;Philonic&quot; philosophy dominated European thought for 17 centuries until it was destroyed by Spinoza, &quot;the last of the medievals and the first of the moderns.&quot;
* &quot;The Philosophy of the Church Fathers: Volume I Faith Trinity, Incarnation&quot;, Harvard University Press (1956)

* &quot;Repercussions of the Kalam in Jewish philosophy&quot;, Harvard University Press (1979)

=== Articles ===
A complete bibliography of Wolfson&#x27;s work can be found in . He was known principally, as mentioned above, for crossing all artificial boundaries of scholarship, as best revealed by the titles of some of his papers:
* &quot;The meaning of &quot;Ex Nihilo&quot; in the Church Fathers, Arabic and Hebrew philosophy, and St. Thomas&quot; (1948)
* &quot;The double faith theory in Clement, Saadia, Averroes and St. Thomas, and its origin in Aristotle and the Stoics&quot; (1942)
* &quot;The internal senses in Latin, Arabic, and Hebrew philosophical texts&quot; (1935)
* &quot;The amphibolous terms in Aristotle, Arabic philosophy, and Maimonides&quot; (1938)
*&quot;Solomon Pappenheim on time and space and his relation to Locke and Kant&quot;, pp. 426–440 in &quot;Jewish studies in memory of Israel Abrahams&quot;, Press of the Jewish Institute of Religion (1927)

<text>Moshe Mordechai Epstein (7 March 1866–28 November 1933) was rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Knesseth Yisrael in Slabodka, Lithuania and is recognized as having been one of the leading Talmudists of the twentieth century. He is also one of the founders of the city of Hadera.

==Childhood==
Epstein was born in Bakst, in the Vilna district of Lithuania, on the 20th of Adar, 5626 (1866), to Rabbi Tzvi Chaim and Baila Chana Epstein. His father, who served as the rabbi of Bakst, had been affectionately referred to during his days in the Volozhin yeshiva as &quot;the Bakst Genius&quot;. Moshe Mordechai&#x27;s genius was detected from a very early age and he was called the &quot;illui from Bakst&quot;. The child prodigy began studying in the Volozhin yeshiva at the age of 16, under the guidance of the legendary Torah giant Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik. There, he met his brother-in-law-to-be, Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer, and, in 1889, married Menucha Frank, the eldest &quot;Frank sister&quot;.

==Leadership==
After his marriage, Epstein moved to his wife&#x27;s hometown, in Kovno, and was joined there two years later by Rabbi Meltzer, following his marriage to Epstein&#x27;s sister-in-law, Baila Hinda Frank. In Kovno, the two scholars studied under the renowned mussar master, Rabbi Yitzchak Blazer, known in yeshivos as &quot;Reb Itzele Peterburger&quot;, one of Rabbi Yisrael Salanter&#x27;s foremost disciples. It was there that they became intrigued with the study of mussar.

In 1894, both rabbis started teaching in the famed Slabodka yeshiva, which was not far from Kovno. In 1897, Nosson Tzvi Finkel, Slabodka&#x27;s famed mashgiach ruchani), invited Epstein to become the rosh yeshiva. Epstein accepted the post, while Meltzer moved together with some of his best talmidim to the town of Slutsk to lead the Ridvaz&#x27;s yeshiva there. The Slabodka yeshiva flourished under the joint leadership of Rabbis Epstein and Finkel, and many of its students were crucial in nurturing the spiritual level of the Jewish people in subsequent generations. For a list of notables, see Slabodka yeshiva.

In 1924, Rabbi Epstein was part of a delegation to the United States headed by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, chief rabbi of the Land of Israel.

In 1924, Epstein, Finkel, and most of the yeshiva, relocated to Hebron, in what was then British Mandate for Palestine. The yeshiva thrived for five years in Hebron as it had in Lithuania. In late August 1929 mobs, incited by the antisemitic Mufti of Jerusalem, swarmed the yeshiva, killing over 67 Jews and wounding many more, in an event known as the 1929 Hebron massacre. Among the victims was his American-born nephew Aaron David Epstein. In the aftermath, the British authorities evacuated the rest of the Jewish community. The yeshiva was relocated to the Geula section of Jerusalem, and was renamed Yeshivas Chevron. In 1975, Yeshivas Chevron moved to its current location in Givat Mordechai.

==Legacy==
Epstein was known to share a warm relationship with Finkel. Epstein&#x27;s daughter married Finkel&#x27;s son, Moshe Finkel. Epstein&#x27;s other daughter married Yechezkel Sarna (1895–1969), who succeeded Epstein as rosh yeshiva of Chevron after his death. Epstein had only one son, Chaim Shraga Feivel, whom he named after his father-in-law. Epstein authored the &quot;Levush Mordechai&quot; (1901), which contains his &quot;chiddushim&quot;, or novellae, on all tractates of the Talmud.

His brother, Rabbi Ephraim Epstein (1876-1960) also studied at the Slabodka yeshiva, and later moved to the United States were he served as rabbi to Congregation Anshei Kneseth in Chicago for over 50 years. Rabbi Ephraim Epstein&#x27;s son, Rabbi Harry Epstein, headed Ahavath Achim Congregation in Atlanta Georgia for over 50 years and founded what is now called the Epstein School.

Epstein died in Jerusalem in 1933, corresponding to the Hebrew date 10 of Kislev 5694. He is buried on the Mount of Olives.

A street in the Neve Haim neighborhood in Hadera is named after him, and a street in the Geula neighborhood of Jerusalem is named after his book &quot;Levush Mordechai&quot;

<doc id="519388" wikidata="Q700131" url="?curid=519388" title="Junkers Ju 90">
<text>The Junkers Ju 90 was a four-engined airliner and transport aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Junkers.

Derived from the abortive Ju 89 strategic bomber, it was developed to be used as a long-distance commercial aircraft for the German flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa. It drew heavily upon the Ju 89, sharing the same wing and tail unit while adopting an all-new fuselage that could seat up to 40 passengers. In contrast to the corrugated skin traditionally used on Junkers aircraft, virtually all of the aircraft had a smooth duralumin covering. Various models of engines were used to power the type. Junkers&#x27; design team was headed by Ernst Zindel, and Professor Herbert Wagner.

On 28 August 1937, the first prototype performed its maiden flight; flight testing was undertaken in close collaboration with Deutsche Luft Hansa, who was sufficiently encouraged by the results to issue a production order. While the Ju 90 did enter limited service with the airline, the planned full scale passenger services envisioned were never enacted due to the outbreak of the Second World War. During the conflict, the civil Ju 90s were impressed into service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; as military transports. They were active during the invasion of Norway and on the Eastern Front, where they were supplied the German 6th Army that was besieged at Stalingrad. &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Ju 90s were also operated in the Mediterranean for a time.

Several Ju 90s were rebuilt into prototypes for the Ju 290, a larger transport and reconnaissance aircraft. Just two Ju 90s survived the conflict and were scrapped shortly thereafter.

==Design and development==
===Background===
The origins of the Junkers Ju 90 are directly connected with that of the Ju 89, a prototype strategic bomber. This aircraft, which had commenced developing during the mid-1930s, was a contender in the Ural bomber programme that was aimed at creating a long-range strategic bombing capacity for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. By the time that the Ju 89 programme had made it through to the flight testing phase, the development of four-engined bombers had become an increasing politically contentious matter, particularly following the untimely demise of General Wever (one of the programme&#x27;s most powerful advocates) as well as rising tensions between Erhard Milch (another proponent) and commander-in-chief of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, Hermann Göring. Recognising that strategic bombing was falling out of favour with the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) in favour of smaller and faster bombers, Junkers approached the RLM with their proposal to reuse the components intended for the third Ju 89 prototype to produce a transport aircraft for the German flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa instead.

The RLM consented to Junkers&#x27; proposal, but only on the basis that an alternative engine to the Ju 89&#x27;s Daimler-Benz DB 600A V-12 engine was used on any subsequent aircraft. Accordingly, while the aircraft retained the wings and tail unit of the Ju 89, it also incorporated an all-new fuselage that was considerably wider and suitable for the carriage of passengers. This new rectangular section fuselage was primarily constructed of duralumin along with some steel elements, was relatively generous by the standards of the time, possessing an internal width of 2.83 m (9 ft  in).

In terms of its basic configuration, the Ju 90 was a four-engine all-metal low-wing aircraft fitted with twin end-plate vertical stabilizers. The wings were built around five tubular girder spars and covered with a smooth stressed skin. The leading edge was quite markedly swept while the trailing edge was almost straight. The Junkers &quot;double wing&quot;, a full-span movable flap/aileron combination, was also present. The fins and rudders, the latter with prominent horn balances assemblies, were placed at the end of the tailplane; this latter carried the elevators separated by a gap, forming another double wing. The rudders and rear portion of the elevator of the prototypes were the only part of the aircraft to use the traditional Junkers corrugated skin; all other areas had a smooth duralumin covering that was flush-rivetted.

The interior of the aircraft was could be configured into various cabin layouts; when arranged to maximise occupancy, the carriage of up to 40 passengers was possible. Aft of the passenger compartments were Toilets, a cloakroom, a storage space for air mail; a baggage hold was located forward of the passenger compartment. The tailwheel undercarriage was fully retractable, the single-wheel main units were raised hydraulically into the inner engine nacelles.

===Into flight and civil usage===

On 28 August 1937, the first prototype, the Ju 90 V1, performed its maiden flight; it was powered by four Daimler-Benz DB 600C liquid-cooled inverted V engines, each one capable of producing up to 820 kW (1,100 hp). These engines were more powerful than both those of its Ju 89 predecessor and subsequent production standard commercial Ju 90s. It was named &quot;Der Grosse Dessauer&quot;, as had been the earlier Junkers G 38. Deutsche Luft Hansa played a leading role in the long-distance portion of flight testing. On 6 February 1938, following eight months of flight tests, this first prototype was lost while performing over-speed tests.
During May 1938, the second prototype (V2) was delivered to Luft Hansa for flight testing. Akin to the following production standard commercial Ju 90, this aircraft was powered by four BMW 132 radial engines delivering 620 kW (830 hp). The move towards lower power has been speculated to have been necessitated by the demands on Daimler Benz to produce engines for strategically important front-line aircraft. This aircraft, named &quot;Preussen&quot;, was lost during a failed take off for tropical flight tests in November 1938 at Bathurst, Gambia.

Despite these setbacks, Luft Hansa opted to order eight production standard Ju 90A-1 aircraft. They also flew the next two prototypes, starting with V3 &quot;Bayern&quot; which flew on the Berlin-Vienna route from July 1938. This aircraft flew a total of 62,572 km ( mi) in 1938. Only seven of the Ju 90A-1s were ever delivered to Luft Hansa, the final in April 1940, one going directly to the Luftwaffe. Full scale passenger services were never introduced due to the outbreak of the Second World War. The airline&#x27;s Ju 90s were impressed into &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service, although two were subsequently returned to Luft Hansa. 

The Ju90 attracted some interest from prospective foreign operators. South African Airways (SAA) opted to order a pair of Ju 90A-1s, powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp engines that could produce up to 670 kW (900 hp) each. The delivery of these aircraft were scheduled to take place during the summer of 1939; however, neither aircraft were ever delivered to SAA.

During July 1941, the fourth prototype V4 entered service with the Luftwaffe; it was fitted with 980 kW (1,320 hp) Jumo 211F/L engines. On the first four Ju 90As, five pairs of rectangular windows were on each side, each double pair lighting a divided-off section of the cabin containing eight seats in facing pairs on either side of a central aisle. On the Ju 90B, whose prototypes were the Ju 90 V5 through the Ju 90 V10 aircraft, adopted round fuselage portholes instead. The Ju 90 V11 became the definitive Ju 290 prototype, featuring smaller rectangular-shaped fuselage windows.

The &quot;Ju 90B&quot; series were visually distinctive due to their oval tail fins. The Ju 90 V6 was withdrawn from test flights, and rebuilt as the Ju 390 V1 prototype. The Ju 90 V9 was also withdrawn and rebuilt as the Ju 390V2, later redesignated in October 1944 as the Ju 390A-1. The rebuilding of Ju 90 V10 into the Ju 390 V3 bomber prototype was commenced, but was ultimately scrapped at the factory in June 1944. The Junkers firm was paid compensation for seven Ju 390s that were partially constructed when the corresponding orders were cancelled.

===Militarisation===
In April 1939, the RLM asked Junkers for a further development of the Ju 90 for military transport purposes. The Ju 90V5 and V6 were the prototypes of this military design. They got a new wing with a straight inner section leading edge, of greater span (19%) and area (11%). The landing gear was strengthened with twin main wheels and the fins were more rounded, lacking the characteristic horn balance nick of the earlier models. The windows were replaced by 10 small portholes a side. The Ju 90 V5 flew first on 5 December 1939. A special feature of both the V5 and V6 was a powered boarding ramp in the floor of the rear section of the fuselage for loading cars and larger cargo freight. This &quot;Trapoklappe&quot; ramp, when lowered, was powerful enough to raise the fuselage to the horizontal flying position. Both aircraft were retroactively fitted with the much more powerful, unitized &quot;Kraftei&quot;-mount 1,200 kW (1,600 hp) BMW 801MA radials, with the first suffix letter &quot;M&quot; signifying the initial &quot;Motoranlage&quot; format of unitized powerplant installation design promulgated by the RLM. Ju 90s were also used as tugs for heavy gliders.

The two last prototypes – the V7 and V8 – fed directly into the Ju 290 development programme. The former had a fuselage extension of 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) and the addition of dihedral to the tailplane to solve a yaw instability. A reconnaissance prototype aerodynamically similar to the V7, the V8 was armed, however, with two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons and up to nine 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns in two dorsal, one ventral, and one tail position.

The Ju 90 was used for the first time operationally during the invasion of Norway. Operated as part of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s transport force, they were deployed to the Eastern Front for a time to help supply the German 6th Army that was besieged at Stalingrad. They were subsequently transferred to the Mediterranean theatre, where they operated into late 1943.

===Ju 290 / 390 development===
Several Ju 90s were converted into prototypes of the Ju 290, a larger aircraft intended for transport and reconnaissance duties. The more powerful engines and other modifications to the Ju 90 V5 and V7 were steps in this direction and the latter was converted into the Ju 290 V3. The Ju 90 V8 became the second prototype Ju 290 V2. The incomplete Ju 90 V11 airframe was converted into the Ju 290 V1. The Ju 90 V6 airframe was used in the construction of the Ju 390 V1.

===Numbers and survivors===
Just 18 Ju 90s of all versions were completed of which two survived the war, both captured, and then scrapped shortly afterwards. The wreck of one Ju 90, which was shot down on 23 July 1943, south of Bastia, North Corsica, is accessible to scuba divers and in 2023, two-thirds of the wreck remained intact.

<text>Hebron Yeshiva, also known as &quot;Yeshivas Hevron&quot;, or Knesses Yisroel, is a yeshiva (school for Talmudic study). It originated in 1924 when the roshei yeshiva (deans) and 150 students of the Slabodka Yeshiva, known colloquially as the &quot;mother of yeshivas&quot;, relocated to Hebron.

==Relocation of Slabodka Yeshiva to Israel==

A 1924 edict requiring enlistment in the military or supplementary secular studies in the yeshiva led a large number of students in the Slabodka yeshiva to relocate to the Land of Israel, at that time Palestine under the British mandate. Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, also known as &quot;Der Alter fun Slabodka&quot; (&quot;The Elder of Slabodka&quot;), sent Rabbi Avraham Grodzinski to head this group and establish the yeshiva in Hebron. Upon Grodzinski&#x27;s return to Slabodka, the Alter transferred the &quot;mashgiach ruchani&quot; responsibilities to him, and the &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot; duties to Rabbi Yitzchok Isaac Sher, and he moved to Hebron to lead the yeshiva there together with Rabbi Moshe Mordechai Epstein. Hebron was chosen over Jerusalem to avoid the influence of the conservative Old Yishuv. The Slabodka yeshiva in Europe ceased operation during the Holocaust. A branch was also established in Bnei Brak.

==1929 Hebron massacre and relocation to Jerusalem==

Twenty-four students were murdered in the 1929 Hebron massacre, and the yeshiva was re-established in the Geula neighbourhood of Jerusalem.

Eight of the victims were American citizens who had come to study in the yeshiva from American yeshivas such as Hebrew Theological College, Torah Vodaath and RIETS.

On the day of the 1929 massacre, Rabbi Simcha Zissel Broide, who was appointed Rosh Yeshiva in 5721 (1960/61), was not in Hebron.

The yeshiva moved into a new and larger campus in the south-central Givat Mordechai neighbourhood in 1975. It has about 1500 students and is one of the most prestigious and influential haredi non-hassidic yeshivahs in Israel. The current &quot;roshei yeshiva&quot; (deans) are rabbis Dovid Cohen and Yosef Chevroni.

<text>Spectravideo International Limited (SVI) (printed as Spectra Video, with the space, in game manuals) was an American computer manufacturer and software house. It was originally called SpectraVision, a company founded by Harry Fox in 1981. The company produced video games and other software for the VIC-20 home computer, the Atari 2600 home video game console, and its CompuMate peripheral. Some of their own computers were compatible with the Microsoft MSX or the IBM PC.

Despite their initial success, the company faced financial troubles, and by 1988, operations ceased. Later, a UK-based company bought the Spectravideo brand name from Bondwell in 1988, but this company, known as Logic3, had no connection to the original Spectravideo products and was dissolved in 2016.

== History ==

SpectraVision was founded in 1981 by Harry Fox and Alex Weiss as a distributor of computer games, contracting external developers to write the software. Their main products were gaming cartridges for the Atari 2600, Colecovision and VIC-20. In late 1982 the company was renamed to Spectravideo due to a naming conflict with On Command Corporation&#x27;s Hotel TV system called SpectraVision.

Harry Fox and Peter Law developed and patented ergonomic joystick for Spectravideo.
This was the basis for QuickShot line of joysticks and other input devices produced by Spectravideo for video game machines and home computers.

In the early 1980s, the company developed 11 games for the Atari 2600, including several titles of some rarity: &quot;Chase the Chuckwagon&quot;, &quot;Mangia&quot; and &quot;Bumper Bash&quot;.
A few of their titles were only available through the Columbia House music club.

The company&#x27;s first attempt at a computer was an add-on for the Atari 2600 called the Spectravideo CompuMate, with a membrane keyboard and very simple programmability.

Spectravideo&#x27;s first real computers were the SV-318 and SV-328, released in 1983. Both were powered by a Z80 A at 3.6 MHz, but differed in the amount of RAM (SV-318 had 32KB and SV-328 had 80KB total, of which 16KB was reserved for video) and keyboard style. The main operating system, residing in ROM, was a version of Microsoft Extended BASIC, but if the computer was equipped with a floppy drive, the user had the option to boot with CP/M instead. These two computers were precedent to MSX and not fully compatible with the standard, though the changes made to their design to create MSX were minor. The system had a wide range of optional hardware, for example an adapter making it possible to run ColecoVision games on the SVI.
SpectraVideo also created the QuickShot SVI-2000 Robot Arm which could be connected to a Commodore 64 user port or be controlled stand-alone with two joysticks.

In May 1983, Spectravideo went public with the sale of 1 million shares of stock at $6.25 per share in an initial public offering underwritten by brokerage D. H. Blair &amp; Co.

However, Spectravideo quickly ran into trouble. By December 1983 its stock had fallen to 75 cents per share. In March 1984, the company agreed to sell a 60% stake of itself to Hong Kong-based Bondwell Holding in a deal that would have also required the resignation of president Harry Fox and vice-president Alex Weiss. That deal was set aside when Spectravideo was unable to restructure about $2.6 million worth of debt, and another deal where Fanon Courier U.S.A. Inc. would have purchased 80% of the company was struck in July.

The Fanon Courier deal similarly fell through, and Fox resigned as president in September, with Bondwell Holding purchasing over half of the company&#x27;s stock and installing Bondwell vice-president Christopher Chan as the new president.

In May 1984 the Spectravideo SVI-728 was released. This was a MSX compatible machine.

In 1985 the SVI-738, also MSX compatible was released. The machine came with a built-in 360 KB 3.5&quot; floppy drive.

The last computer produced by Spectravideo was the SVI-838 (also known as Spectravideo X&#x27;Press 16), released in 1986. It was compatible with both the PC and MSX2 standards.

== Legacy ==
The Spectravideo name was used by a UK-based company called SpectraVideo Plc, formerly known as Ash &amp; Newman. That company was founded in 1977, and bought the Spectravideo brand name from Bondwell in 1988. They sold a range of products branded as Logic3, and have no connection to the original Spectravideo products. The company changed its name to Logic3 in 2006, and entered administration in 2013 after a licensing deal with Ferrari proved to be a failure. The company was formally dissolved on 19 April 2016.

== List of video games ==

There are 68 games for Spectravideo that are not compatible with MSX computers

<text>Warith Deen Mohammed (born Wallace D. Muhammad; October 30, 1933 – September 9, 2008), also known as W. Deen Mohammed, [[Imam]] W. Deen Muhammad and Imam Warith Deen, was an African-American Muslim leader, theologian, philosopher, Muslim revivalist, and Islamic thinker.

He was a son of Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam from 1933 to 1975. In 1975, upon Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s death, he became the Nation of Islam&#x27;s national leader (&quot;Supreme Minister&quot;).

In 1976, he disbanded the original Nation of Islam (NOI) and transformed it into an ostensibly orthodox and mainstream Islamic movement. He rejected the previous deification of Wallace Fard Muhammad, accepted whites as fellow-worshippers, forged closer ties with mainstream Muslim communities, and introduced the Five Pillars of Islam into his group&#x27;s theology. This organization was called the &quot;Bilalians&quot; (1975), &quot;World Community of Al-Islam in the West&quot; (1976–77), &quot;American Muslim Mission&quot; (1978–85), and finally the American Society of Muslims.

Splinter groups which resisted these changes were formed after Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s death, particularly under Louis Farrakhan, who would revive the name Nation of Islam (from Final Call) for his organization in 1978. Farrakhan&#x27;s NOI and the previous Final Call claim that they are direct continuations of the pre-1975 NOI and the pre-1975 Final Call.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

Mohammed was born Wallace D. Muhammad on Yemans Street in Hamtramck, Michigan in 1933. In 1992, he changed his legal name to Warithuddin Muhammad, Warith Deen Muhammad, which translates to &#x27;Inheritor of the Religion of Muhammad&#x27;. His parents were Clara and Elijah Muhammad, both highly active in the Nation of Islam (NOI), the organization that preached a form of Black nationalism and its own version of Islam. From 1934 until he died in 1975, Elijah Muhammad led the Nation under the title, &quot;the Messenger of Allah.&quot;

Named to honor Wallace Fard Muhammad (Fard), the founder of the Nation of Islam, Mohammed grew up in Chicago as one of seven siblings. His elementary education came from the Muhammad University of Islam (MUI) school system (later known as the Clara Muhammad Schools, or Muhammad Schools). He briefly studied Arabic as a youth under Jamal Shakir Diab, a Palestinian who was later hired by his father to teach at the MUI in Chicago.

Mohammed became a minister under his father in late 1958 and served in Philadelphia during the late 1950s and early 1960s. While serving in Philadelphia, W.D. Mohammed commenced an extensive study of Ahmadiyya doctrines under Philadelphia-based Ahmadi missionary Muhammad Abdullah.

On October 29, 1961, Mohammed was arrested for failure to report to Elgin State Hospital. The following day, on his 28th birthday, Mohammed was transferred to Federal Correctional Institution, Sandstone to begin a term for having refused induction into the United States military. He could have performed community service, but his father pressed him to accept the jail time. He spent most of that time studying the &quot;Quran&quot;, the main Islamic holy book, and the Bible.

He became convinced that the Nation of Islam had to change. In 1963, he was released from prison and resumed studies under Muhammad Abdullah. Close also to Malcolm X, who the NOI had expelled, he found that by this time his viewpoints deviated significantly from those of his father, whom he no longer believed to be a prophet. Because of this conclusion, he was excommunicated five different times; by 1974, he returned permanently to the NOI.

==Religious leadership and ministry==

===Reforming the Nation of Islam===
Upon his father&#x27;s death on February 25, 1975, Mohammed was unanimously chosen as the leader of the Nation of Islam and introduced to the NOI membership at the annual Saviours&#x27; Day convention on February 26, 1975. Among the first changes Mohammed instituted, he dropped the title Supreme Minister and took the titles Mujaddid, Chief Imam, or simply Imam, in 1976. The same year, he unveiled a new flag for the NOI community.

These were just two of the many reforms which Mohammed introduced. Among others, he eliminated the NOI dress code, disbanded the military branch of the NOI, clarified the concept of the devil, and introduced an eclectic, esoteric interpretation of Islam he labeled, &quot;The Divine Mind/Body-Christ.&quot; According to WD&#x27;s former Special Aide Dr. Na&#x27;im Akbar, WD&#x27;s &quot;Teachings&quot; are not restricted to WD&#x27;s followers but &quot;will provide for the social community a series of readings which will cultivate and grow them more effectively as social human beings... based on the most renowned religious teachings of a teacher in the West.&quot; Similarly, via his various written works, &quot;Muhammad Speaks&quot; newspaper, and public speeches, he gradually introduced and explained Islam&#x27;s Five Pillars. He stated that Fard was not divine and that his father was not a prophet. All of the over 400 temples were converted into traditional Islamic mosques. He also renamed the community several times before finally settling on the American Society of Muslims to reflect the new thinking. Mohammed was frank about his intentions to evolve the movement. On November 19, 1978, he spoke on the &quot;Evolution of the Nation of Islam&quot; at the American Academy of Religion in New Orleans.

Mohammed&#x27;s changes reached deep into the philosophy of the movement which his father had led for so long. He rejected literal interpretations of divine scriptures, his father&#x27;s theology, and Black-separatist views, and based on his intensive independent study, history, and theology, he accepted whites as fellow worshipers. However, he also encouraged African Americans (Bilalians) to separate themselves from their pasts, in 1976 calling upon them to change their surnames which were often given to their ancestors by slave masters. He forged closer ties with mainstream Muslim communities, including Latinos. He also decentralized power. On September 10, 1978, in an address in Atlanta he resigned as Chief Imam and appointed a six-member council to lead the Community.

Mohammed felt quite keenly about his role in reform. In an interview which was published in the &quot;Muhammad Speaks&quot; newspaper and conducted by his brother Jabir Herbert Muhammad, Mohammed described his role as the successor to their father as that of a Mujeddid, one who would watch over the new Islam or community. In 1979 he used the title Mujeddid (Mujaddid) on his byline in his weekly articles for the &quot;Bilalian News&quot; (the new title of &quot;Muhammad Speaks&quot;).

Warith Deen Mohammed received encouragement from the international Muslim community, yet the changes which he made within the Nation of Islam were not universally accepted. Several dissident groups resisted, most notably those who followed Louis Farrakhan in breaking ranks with Mohammed. These groups revived the name &#x27;Nation of Islam&#x27; between 1977 and 1979. At the outset of the 1991 Gulf War, Warith Deen Mohammed became the only American Imam to issue a public endorsement of the US military bombing of Iraq. Two consecutive &quot;Muslim Journal&quot; issues featured the endorsement on its front page. The endorsement came on the eve of the Amiriyah shelter bombing.

The following year, in recognition of his military endorsement, the United States Congress and Pentagon honored WD Mohammed for his &quot;loyal and unswerving religious leadership in support of our Nation during the difficult times during the Gulf War.&quot; Mohammed described the invitation &quot;I am like floating in the air. I never dreamed that we would receive such an invitation.&quot; When questioned about his Gulf War endorsement and call for Muslims to fight Muslims generated conflicts in his community, he replied, &quot;Yes, it is a conflict. It is a conflict of emotions and a conflict of conscience for many. But for me it is no conflict of conscience when I know that I am on the right side. Once I know that I am on the right side, I have no conflict of conscience at all. I did not rush into any decision. I thought it out very carefully…So I thank America many times. I thank you again. I thank the military. I thank the Army. I thank all of you. I told my sons I would be proud if my sons were in the military.&quot;

In 1995, Mohammed released a statement in which he expressed his concern about Farrakhan&#x27;s motivations and the racial divisiveness of his ministry. Yet over the next twenty years, the pair would embrace publicly. Warith Deen Mohammed declared, &quot;I will never denounce him as long as he says he wants to be a Muslim.&quot; They also declared reconciliation at the annual NOI &quot;Saviours&#x27; Day&quot; convention on February 25, 2000, and NOI &quot;Million Family March&quot; on October 16, 2000. Still, on August 10, 2007, Mohammed repeated his frustration with the separatist stance of the current Nation of Islam, stating that its leaders had, &quot;for the last 10 years or more...just been selling wolf tickets to [threatening, without substance] the white race and having fun while they collect money and have fancy lifestyles.&quot; He predicted a quiet evolution in the NOI towards unity with the mainstream American Muslim community.

===Building ties within the Muslim community===
Mohammed was intent on strengthening bonds between his movement and the wider American Muslim faith community as well as with followers of Islam abroad. It was his goal to align American Muslims with Sunni Islam. In 1976, he took a delegation to Guyana on an official state visit to meet with Prime Minister Forbes Burnham, and the then President of Guyana Arthur Chung, during which he forged ties with the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in the region.

In Geneva, Switzerland in 1985, he met with Dr. Muhammad Ahmad Al-Sharif, Secretary General of the World Islamic Call Society of Libya and Dr. Abdul Hakim Tabibi, an Afghan mujahid, to discuss areas of future cooperation with the World Islamic Call Society and the Muslim Community of America. He hosted Grand Mufti Abdullah Mukhtar, the leader of an estimated 60 million Muslims at Masjid Bilal, during his first visit to the United States in 1994.

In 1999, he was elected to serve on the Islamic Society of North America&#x27;s &quot;shura&quot; board. That same year, during Ramadan, he pledged to work with the Grand Mufti of Syria, Shaikh Ahmed Kuftaro an-Naqshbandi for the advancement of Al-Islam during a meeting with Kuftaro and Shaikh Nazim al-Haqqani. He was the special invited guest and keynote speaker at the &quot;Inaugural Conference on the Growth and Development of Islam in America&quot;, held at Harvard University on March 3–4, 2000.

===Interfaith cooperation===
Just as Mohammed sought to be racially inclusive, he also focused on cooperation between multiple faiths. On May 23, 1976, he conducted a massive interfaith Spiritual Life Jubilee with the Peoples Temple in Los Angeles, California and headlined with Jim Jones on the subject, &quot;A New Heaven and a New Earth&quot;. In 1977, he participated in a Muslim-Christian dialogue in Fort Worth, Texas with Dr. Jack Evans, then President of Southwestern Christian College in Terrell, Texas. In February 1978, he gave a historic address before more than 1,000 Jews and Muslims at the Washington Hebrew Congregation in Washington, D.C., then under the leadership of Rabbi Joshua O. Haberman.

This was a focus that would persist throughout his career. In 1993, he spoke at the Interfaith Roundtable National Conference of Christians, Jews and Muslims in Detroit, Michigan. &quot;If we look at the broad definition for Muslim, we have to say that even though a Christian may be worshipping Jesus the Christ Prophet more than he is worshipping Allah, he or she may be Muslim in their spirit. They may still be Muslim, though the orientation has now dominated their Muslim urge. The person carrying a heavy cross may be a Muslim inwardly. So it is for a Jew, or Communist, or a Buddhist, or a Hindu.&quot;

In March 1995, he gave the keynote address at the Muslim-Jewish Convocation in Glencoe, Illinois. From October 1–6, 1996 he met with Pope John Paul II and Cardinal Francis Arinze at the Holy See in Rome. On August 17, 1997, he was presented the Luminosa Award for Unity from the Focolare Movement. On September 9, 1997, he addressed the Baltimore Jewish Council speaking on themes of worldwide justice and fairness.

On May 18–20, 1998, he attended the Conference on Religion and Peace which was sponsored by the Center for Christian, Jewish Understanding of Sacred Heart University in Auschwitz, Poland. In June 1998 he addressed the Muslim Friends of the Focolare conference in Rome, Italy, in October of the following year, along with a 92-member delegation, he spoke before a gathering of 100,000 people in the Vatican. Pope John Paul II and the Dalai Lama were both in attendance.

On October 29, 2001, Mohammed, Minister Louis Farrakhan, Pastor Robert H. Schuller, and members of the Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions participated in an &quot;Evening of Religious Solidarity&quot; at the Islamic Foundation in Villa Park, Illinois.

==Political and social activities==
Throughout his ministry, Mohammed remained politically active, both domestically and internationally. His early meetings with prominent political figures included meetings with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1975, Sharjah ruler Sheik Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi in 1976, and United States President Jimmy Carter in 1977.

He was the only American who was invited and the only American to attend the 10th Annual Islamic Conference of Ministers in May, 1979, in Fes, Morocco.

In April 1988, he participated as the representative of Muslim Americans in the &quot;Political and Religious Leaders Campaign for Planetary Survivor&quot; in Oxford Town Hall. Later that year he was among 100 leaders in religion, government, business, law and philanthropy who gathered in Williamsburg, Virginia during the Williamsburg Charter Foundations &quot;First Liberty Summit&quot;.

In 1995, he participated in the &quot;Forbes&quot; Forum on Management in Naples, Florida. In 1996, he participated in the &quot;National Discussion on Race &amp; Reconciliation&quot; sponsored by the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. In late 1997, he attended the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Teheran, Iran, and he participated in &quot;The Religious Community and Moral Challenge of Poverty Round Table Discussion&quot; convened by former U. S. Senator Paul Simon in 1998 in Carbondale, Illinois.

In November 1999, he attended consecutive World Peace Conferences. The first conference, &quot;Jubilenium Interfaith Conference for World Peace&quot;, was an invitation-only event held in Tiberias, Israel. The second was the &quot;7th World Assembly of the World Conference on Religion and Peace&quot;, held in Amman, Jordan.

He was a prominent political speaker. Mohammed gave the first invocation in the United States Senate ever by a Muslim in 1992. That same year, he became the first Muslim to deliver an address on the floor of the Georgia State Legislature. In 1993, he gave an Islamic prayer during the first Inaugural Interfaith Prayer Service of President Bill Clinton, and again in 1997 at the second Interfaith Prayer Service. In 1996, he was invited to Egypt by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to address the Supreme Council of Affairs in Cairo on the theme &quot;Islam and the Future of Dialogue between Civilizations&quot;.

He sat on a number of councils and committees, both domestically and abroad. In 1986, he was selected to serve on the World Supreme Council of Masajid (mosques) as one of only three representatives of the United States. Also in 1995 he was selected as a President of the World Conference of Religions for Peace (WCRP) and addressed its governing board in Copenhagen, Denmark. In January 1997, he was appointed to President Bill Clinton&#x27;s Religious Advisory Council. In 2000, he was named to the executive committee of the Religious Alliance Against Pornography (RAAP).

He made his opinions on political matters known. On July 4, 1976, he started the New World Patriotism Day celebrations which were conducted on Independence Day in major cities across America.

In 1984, Mohammed went against the mainstream African American political establishment and opposed Reverend Jesse Jackson&#x27;s run for the Democratic nomination for president. In 1985, to protest the Chicago probate court handling of an American Muslim Mission case, he organized a &quot;Walk for Justice&quot; that drew 500,000 participants.

On December 23, 1989, he spoke at the &quot;Annual Conference of the Islamic Committee for Palestine&quot; on the plight of the Palestinians. In 1990, Mohammed supported and endorsed Neil Hartigan for Governor of Illinois. He gave his support to the peacemaking and humanitarian efforts of Bishop Samuel Ruiz.

On September 10, 1990, he participated in the international conference on the &quot;Current Situation in the Gulf&quot;, where he made his opposition to Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait a matter of public record. He stated: &quot;We consider President George Bush to be an honorable man. We commend his actions in ordering the surgical strikes on Iraqi military installations. These efforts to avoid excessive loss of human life are appreciated.&quot;

On behalf of the Muslim American Community, he donated $85,000 to Nelson Mandela to aid his efforts to end apartheid in South Africa during a personal meeting in Oakland, California on June 30, 1990. On September 11, 2001, he denounced the terrorist attacks as un-Islamic.

==Islamic beliefs and ideology==
===Fiqh===
While he emphasized unity within the Muslim community, Warith Deen Mohammed also asked the American Muslim community to establish a new school of &quot;fiqh&quot;, a code of conduct for the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. He told &quot;Islamica&quot; magazine in 2008 that he felt that the &quot;madhhab&quot;—the schools of thought within fiqh—were geographically influenced and should be regionally developed, suggesting that &quot;I think we are gradually getting a sense of madhabs in America, especially those like me. We are getting a sense of madhabs. And with the coming generation I think that we will be getting a much stronger sense of it. It is coming more and more.&quot; However, his call for a new madhhab came under fire from mainstream Muslims globally who questioned his motivation for desiring such an unprecedented action.

===Imagery and color symbolism===

Mohammed was sensitive to the potential impact of the use of images and symbols in religions. In a 1975 article, he explored this topic and in 1976, he published his first article about the subject in the &quot;Bilalian News&quot; (later the &quot;Muslim Journal&quot;). Titled &quot;A Message of Concern&quot;, this article has run in every subsequent copy of the publication. He also spoke about the subject. For instance, during a June 17, 1977 Friday service, he taught his followers about &quot;The meaning of colors in Scripture and the Natural Powers of Black and White&quot;, describing ancient scriptural symbolism and its effect on modern-day scriptural and religious interpretation. He also elaborated on how colors in scripture have triggered racist influences in religious societies. In 1977, he formed the &quot;Committee for the Removal of All Images that Attempt to Portray the Divine&quot; (C.R.A.I.D.).

==Personal life==
Warith Deen Mohammed&#x27;s first wife was Shirley Mohammed, with whom he had four children. By 1994, according to &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, Mohammed had been married four times and had fathered eight children. Mohammed married Khadija Siddeeq in 2004. Mohammed&#x27;s eldest child Laila Mohammed stated that Warith Deen practiced polygamy. However this polygamy assertion is disputed within the community.

Beyond his public role in religion and politics, Mohammed was involved in real estate, clothing imports, and skin care. During his excommunications from the Nation of Islam in his 30s, he served as a laborer.

==Death==
Mohammed died in Chicago in early September 2008 of a likely heart attack. His body was found in his home by his assistant Rafa Muhammad on Tuesday September 9. In addition to cardiovascular disease, Mohammed suffered from diabetes.

According to the &quot;Final Call&quot; newspaper, &quot;The Janazah prayer service was delayed for close to an hour so the huge crowd that had assembled could be organized and situated.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that 8,000 Muslims attended his funeral. His funeral was held at the Islamic Foundation Masjid in Villa Park, Illinois. Imam W.D. Mohammed was buried at Mount Glenwood Memory Gardens (South) Glenwood, Cook County, Illinois.

==Honors==
On his 44th birthday (October 30, 1977), Mohammed received the Key to the City of Detroit, Michigan from the then Mayor of Detroit Coleman Young, along with a Proclamation declaring October 30, 1977 Wallace D. Muhammad Day in Detroit.

Then Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton proclaimed March 26, 1983 &quot;Economic Dignity Day&quot; in the state of Arkansas. In doing so he stated the following: &quot;Whereas, through the leadership and efforts of Warith Deen Muhammad, the American Muslim Mission is on the path of economic progress and achieving growth through unity...(I) urge all citizens to engage in activities which promote economic progress.&quot;

On July 4, 1983, Muhammad shared the Reviewing Stand for the 1984 &quot;New World Patriotism Day Parade&quot; in Chicago with then State Senator, Emarald Jones, State Representative, Howard Brooks, parade Grand Marshal, Harold Washington the then Mayor of Chicago, and many other dignitaries. Mayor Harold Washington issued a proclamation declaring July 4, 1984 as &quot;New World Patriotism Day Coalition Parade Day&quot; in Chicago.

In 1988, King Hassan II of Morocco, invited Mohammed to participate in the traditional devotions during Ramadan, stating: &quot;Through you Imam W. Deen Mohammed all the people in America are represented.&quot;

In 1992, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt honored Warith Deen Mohammed with &quot;The Gold Medal of Recognition&quot; for his religious work in the United States. He received the Focolare Movement &quot;Luminosa Award for Unity&quot; in 1997. On May 17, 1999, he received a Certificate of Appreciation from the United States Department of State. In 2002, &quot;Ebony Magazine&quot; selected him as one of its &quot;100 Most Influential Black Americans&quot;.

On December 9, 1994, he received the Cup of Compassion from the Hartford Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut.

On April 6, 2002, Mohammed was made a member of the Martin Luther King Jr. International Board of Preachers at Morehouse College in Atlanta, and his portrait was hung in the International Chapel there.

On Saturday, September 3, 2005, the Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR) presented an award to W. Deen Mohammed in recognition of his outstanding leadership role in the American Muslim community at The Mosque Cares sponsored Annual Islamic Convention.

In eulogizing Mohammed on CNN blogs, the executive director of CAIR-Chicago, Ahmed Rehab, called him &quot;America&#x27;s Imam.&quot;

<doc id="519419" wikidata="Q542745" url="?curid=519419" title="Angra (band)">
<text>Angra is a Brazilian power metal and progressive metal band formed in 1991. They have released ten regular studio albums, six EPs, and seven live CD/DVDs to date. Led by Rafael Bittencourt, the band has gained a degree of popularity in Japan and Europe. 

On 2 April 2015, guitarist Kiko Loureiro left Angra to join American thrash metal band Megadeth.

==History==
===Formation===
Angra was formed in November 1991 by former Viper vocalist Andre Matos and guitarists Rafael Bittencourt and André Linhares, in a collaboration with music promoter and &quot;Rock Brigade&quot; magazine owner Antônio &quot;Toninho&quot; Pirani. The trio was joined by drummer Marco Antunes, a former bandmate of Bittencourt&#x27;s, and bassist André Lichewitz - quickly replaced by Luis Mariutti. Bittencourt and Matos were the primary songwriters in the band&#x27;s early days.
Early in 1992, Linhares left the band and was replaced by André Hernandes, who quit in the same year to be replaced by Kiko Loureiro. With Loureiro in the line-up, Angra recorded their first demo tape &quot;Reaching Horizons&quot;, which was released in 1993 through the German label Limb Music. Among the tracks, &quot;Queen of the Night&quot;, originally titled &quot;Rainha&quot; (&quot;Queen&quot;), had been previously composed for Bittencourt and Antunes&#x27; previous band; and &quot;Evil Warning&quot; was written during Hernandes&#x27; brief stint as guitarist.

===&quot;Angels Cry&quot;===

During the recording sessions for their first album &quot;Angels Cry&quot;, Marcos Antunes left the band. A number of session drummers, including Alex Holzwarth were used to finish the album. Ricardo Confessori was later installed as a permanent replacement. This line-up change established a stable line-up lasted from 1993 to 2000. &quot;Angels Cry&quot; was recorded at Gamma Ray guitarist Kai Hansen&#x27;s studio in Hamburg, Germany. Besides Hansen, the album included guest performances by Heavens Gate guitarist Sascha Paeth and Dirk Schlächter.

The album was released in Brazil in 1993 through Eldorado Records and contained a number of classical influences as well as a cover of Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. The album had some success both in Brazil as well as Japan. The band were managed by Antonio Pirani, also editor of &quot;Rock Brigade&quot; magazine. Due to the album&#x27;s success in Japan, the &quot;Evil Warning&quot; EP was released in 1994 through Victor, which included remixed versions of songs &quot;Evil Warning&quot;, &quot;Angels Cry&quot;, &quot;Carry On&quot; and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. In the following year the album was made available in Germany through Dream Circle, and in France by CNR Music.

===&quot;Holy Land&quot; ===

In 1996 Angra opened for AC/DC in Brazil and was invited to the inaugural Brazilian Monsters of Rock Festival. Following the festival, the band embarked on a Brazilian tour, with further dates in Europe in 1995. &quot;Holy Land&quot; - an ambitious project involving orchestration, choirs, and Brazilian rhythms - was released in 1996. The production was handled by Sascha Paeth and Charlie Bauerfiend. &quot;Holy Land&quot; proved successful and the Japanese Victor release, which included the bonus track &quot;Queen of the Night&quot;, went gold. The band toured Japan for the first time following the album&#x27;s success, while in France the single &quot;Make Believe&quot; was released. That same year the EP &quot;Freedom Call&quot; was released, containing cover versions of Judas Priest´s &quot;Painkiller&quot;. After the tour in support of the album, the band released a six-track live album &quot;Holy Live&quot;, recorded in Paris in 1996. &quot;The Holy Box&quot; was released in 1998 by Lucretia Records (Italy), which included seven acoustic tracks.

===&quot;Fireworks&quot; (1998–2000) ===
In 1998 the band released the single &quot;Lisbon,&quot; followed by the album &quot;Fireworks,&quot; produced by Chris Tsangarides. &quot;Fireworks&quot; was a departure from Angra&#x27;s earlier experimental sound, focusing more on a neo-classical metal sound and lacking the Brazilian rhythms that were included in &quot;Holy Land&quot;. The album was the first for the Steamhammer label and appeared in North America through Century Media. A lengthy world tour was set up in support for the album. The band appeared at the Buenos Aires edition of Monsters of Rock, while they co-headlined shows in Europe with Time Machine and Stratovarius in 1999. Bruce Dickinson made a guest appearance during the Paris show, while the band also performed at the Wacken Open Air festival.

===Matos departure and &quot;Rebirth&quot; (2000–2004) ===

In August 2000 Angra split, parting ways with vocalist Andre Matos who took bassist Luis Mariutti and drummer Ricardo Confessori with him. In March 2001, the two remaining members, Kiko Loureiro and Rafael Bittencourt, announced the new line-up that included Symbols&#x27; vocalist Edu Falaschi, drummer Aquiles Priester (Hangar) and bassist Felipe Andreoli (Karma).

This line-up began recording instantly and the album &quot;Rebirth&quot; was released in 2001, produced by Dennis Ward. The album was both a critical and commercial success in Brazil and internationally, selling over 100,000 copies worldwide. The album went gold in Brazil that same year. The EP &quot;Hunters and Prey&quot; was released in 2002 which included acoustic takes of Rebirth songs, as well as other new material, a cover of &quot;Mama&quot; by Genesis, and their first song with lyrics in Portuguese, &quot;Caça e Caçador&quot; (&quot;Hunter and Prey&quot;).

Angra would play live in Japan, appearing in Rock Machine in Spain, Wacken Open Air in Germany and ProgPower in Atlanta, Georgia, which was their first visit to the United States. Following the tour, the band submitted their version of Kashmir to the compilation &quot;The Music Remains The Same (A Metal Tribute to Led Zeppelin)&quot;.

===&quot;Temple of Shadows&quot; (2004–2006)===
&quot;Temple of Shadows&quot; recording sessions started in January 2004 at Mosh Studios in São Paulo, once again produced by Dennis Ward. The album featured guest vocalists Kai Hansen (Gamma Ray), Sabine Edelsbacher (Edenbridge), Hansi Kürsch (Blind Guardian) and Brazilian Música popular brasileira legend Milton Nascimento. Temple of Shadows was a concept album based around a character known as &quot;The Shadow Hunter&quot;, a crusader knight disputing the expansionist ideals of the Catholic Church in the eleventh century.

The band toured Brazil and Europe, headlining shows in Southern Europe throughout Spain, Italy, and France in February 2005. For the first time since its creation, the band played at a UK show at The Mean Fiddler in London, supported by DragonForce, and later joined Finnish band Nightwish for the Japanese dates in March. The band then went to Taiwan and after, for the first time, they played in Oceania, headlining shows in Australia. Angra resumed the Brazilian tour and then returned to Europe for the Lorca Roch Festival, Live in Italy and Bull Rock Festival, sharing stages with big heavy metal names like Iron Maiden.

===&quot;Aurora Consurgens&quot;, management problems, Confessori&#x27;s return (2006–2009) ===
Later in 2006, Angra worked once again with producer Dennis Ward on their new album, entitled &quot;Aurora Consurgens&quot;, focusing on a non-concept album as &quot;Rebirth&quot; was. Instead, they pursued a close relative of the idea, a theme album. Also in 2006, Fábio Laguna composed a solo progressive instrumental album called &quot;Freakeys&quot; along with drummer Aquiles Priester and bassist Felipe Andreoli. In mid-2007, the band took a break due to an unresolved situation with its manager, who was also the owner of the Angra brand. As result, other non-resolved situations between the members arose, culminating in an indefinite hiatus until a solution was reached.

In 2008, singer Edu Falaschi was originally reported as saying that Angra &quot;has been terminated,&quot; but this was later revealed to be both a misunderstanding and a misreporting of his words. Edu later clarified what was meant by his earlier comments: &quot;Angra is not done; we&#x27;re taking a break, a pause. The band is going through some difficult management issues, and all of us are doing our best to get back on the road.&quot; In 2009, the band&#x27;s official site was taken down. Instead, the home page announced that the site was under construction and news would be released soon. In March 2009, the band&#x27;s official site announced the return of drummer Ricardo Confessori after a 9-year hiatus to Angra, replacing Aquiles Priester, who left the band to dedicate full force to his band Hangar. The band went out on tour along with fellow Brazilian band Sepultura during 2009.

===&quot;Aqua&quot; and departure of Falaschi and Confessori (2010–2014) ===

In the beginning of 2010, Angra started writing songs for their upcoming yet unnamed album due out in mid-2010. The album was composed partly at the members&#x27; houses and partly at Confessori&#x27;s ranch, where they rehearsed and improved the arrangements of the new songs. In February, they came into Norcal Studios in São Paulo, to start recordings. The band members made home videos from the writing/recording process and released them to the fans almost weekly.

On July 5 the band unveiled the cover and track list of the new album, named &quot;Aqua&quot;. On July 10, the first single &quot;Arising Thunder&quot; was released. On July, 15 a new song, called &quot;Lease of Life&quot;, was played for the first time on Brazilian radio station &quot;Kiss FM&quot;. The radio program featured an interview with Loureiro and Falaschi, followed by a high quality play of the song. On August 11, &quot;Aqua&quot; was officially released in Japan and the Aqua Tour began with a series of pocket shows, being followed by a Brazilian tour through several venues around the country.

On May 23, 2012, Edu Falaschi issued an open letter in which he announced his departure from Angra. Despite not explaining why, he said he would focus on his future projects, including Almah. Management of the band approached Matos for a possible return, but he declined. Fabio Lione (ex-Labyrinth, Rhapsody of Fire) became the third vocalist for the band.
In 2014, drummer Ricardo Confessori announced he would end his second tenure with the band. He was later replaced by 23-year-old Bruno Valverde.

===&quot;Secret Garden&quot;, Kiko&#x27;s departure, and &quot;Ømni&quot; (2014–2021)===

In November 2014, the band announced their eighth studio album, &quot;Secret Garden&quot;, that was released on December 17 in Japan and on January 16, 2015 in Brazil and Europe. On September 19, 2015, Angra performed at Rock in Rio with special guests Doro Pesch and Dee Snider. A third, surprise guest was also announced mid-show: lead guitarist Marcelo Barbosa, who was revealed as Loureiro&#x27;s touring replacement after the latter had joined Megadeth earlier in the year. The band released their ninth studio album, &quot;Ømni&quot;, on February 16, 2018 worldwide.

Former vocalist Andre Matos died on 8 June 2019. A heart attack was cited as the cause.

In 2021, the band released a graphic novel based on the history of the album &quot;Temple of Shadows&quot;, called &quot;O Templo das Sombras&quot;.

===&quot;Cycles of Pain&quot; and third hiatus (since 2021)===
The band announced that their tenth album, &quot;Cycles of Pain&quot;, would be released on November 1, 2023 in Japan and on November 3 elsewhere. It will be their first album released under Atomic Fire.

On September 2, 2024, the band announced that they will take a touring and recording hiatus after finishing the tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of their album &quot;Temple of Shadows&quot; in March 2025.

<text>Paul Gouin (; May 20, 1898 – December 4, 1976) was a politician in Quebec, Canada, was the son of Sir Lomer Gouin and the grandson of Premier Honoré Mercier.

==Life and career==
He was born in Montreal, Quebec to Lomer Gouin and Éliza Mercier. He fought in World War I as a tank commander, studied at Université Laval, and was admitted to the bar of Quebec in 1920.

Dissatisfied with the direction of the Quebec Liberal Party, he helped found the Action libérale nationale party on June 6, 1934. He soon formed an alliance with Maurice Duplessis&#x27;s Quebec Conservative Party to contest the 1935 provincial election. Gouin withdrew his support from Duplessis on June 18, 1936, but most members of the ALN caucus sided with Duplessis and joined with his Conservative caucus, which formally merged into the Union Nationale party, which not long afterwards won the 1936 election.

He re-formed the Action libérale nationale and became its leader on July 24, 1938. However, the ALN did poorly in the 1939 election, winning only 4.5% of the popular vote and no seats, and soon disbanded. He helped found the Bloc populaire canadien in 1942 but left it in early 1944 when André Laurendeau was chosen to lead the Quebec wing of the party. In 1952 he succeeded Madame Athanase David as the President of the Montreal Festivals, a post he held through 1956.

<text>UTV (formerly Ulster Television, branded on air as ITV1 since 2020) is the ITV region covering Northern Ireland, ITV subsidiary and the former on-air name of the free-to-air public broadcast television channel serving the area. It is run by ITV plc and is responsible for the regional news service and programmes made principally for the area by the UTV production team. It currently uses the network ITV1 channel with an opt-out service for local advertising and on-air promos for local programming.

The present day TV service, ITV1, is directly descended from the ITV network, which originally consisted of independent regional companies which were once the only commercial TV broadcasters in their area. UTV held the licence for Northern Ireland and first went on the air on 31 October 1959.

The company itself was formed in November 1958 to apply for the licence – advertised by the Independent Television Authority – and became the first indigenous broadcaster in Ireland. The company later diversified and the UTV television operation was sold by parent UTV Media plc (now known as Wireless Group and part of News UK) to ITV plc in February 2016.

==History==
In 1953, the BBC began its first television broadcasts in Northern Ireland, from a temporary relay transmitter in Glencairn that was hastily set up in time for the coronation of Elizabeth II. The following year, the UK Parliament passed the Television Act of 1954, which led to the launch of the country&#x27;s first commercial television broadcaster, ITV (and subsequently, the beginning of commercial television broadcasts in the United Kingdom). On 2 September 1958, the ITA began searching for companies and entities interested in operating an ITV franchise for Northern Ireland. Among the candidates for the franchise are Associated-Rediffusion and Granada, as well as two consortia - one led by the Duke of Abercorn and the other led by the Earl of Antrim. The ITA eventually awarded the franchise to the Antrim consortium on 4 November by having the &quot;Whig&quot; and &quot;Telegraph&quot; among the franchise shareholders, while also having sufficient Roman Catholic representation.

With a reluctant MacQuitty as the franchise&#x27;s founding managing director, the newly-formed group, Ulster Television Limited, set out to launch the new station on Halloween 1959, giving them less than a year to construct facilities and hire needed personnel within a tight budget. The group would purchase Havelock House, then an abandoned linen factory on the Ormeau Road, for £17,000 and convert it into a television studio complex. Instead of providing six hours a week of local programming (inclucing a full news service) within year one (as stipulated in the franchise contract), UTV would do so in stages, with the twenty-minute weekday magazine programme &quot;Roundabout&quot; being the first local programme to be produced. Ulster Television would sign an affiliation agreement with another broadcaster, ABC Television, to supply the former with programmes and advertising.

===On air===
Ulster Television went on air at 4:45pm on 31 October 1959, with Laurence Olivier (then of &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and &quot;Richard III&quot; fame) being the first person to appear. During its first minutes on air, it featured children engaging in Halloween festivities, an introduction to Northern Ireland &quot;in words and music&quot; by Richard Hayward, and prerecorded messages from ITV talent. The first programmes to air on Ulster Television are (in order) an episode of &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, an ITN bulletin, an episode of &quot;African Patrol&quot;, an episode of &quot;Boy Meets Girls&quot; (a music programme now wiped), an episode of 77 Sunset Strip, an episode of The Jewel and Warriss Show, another ITN bulletin, a wrestling programme, the 1949 American war film &quot;Task Force&quot;, and an episode of &quot;The Florian Zabach Show&quot;. Olivier would then close Ulster Television&#x27;s inaugural broadcast with an excerpt from Joseph Addison&#x27;s &quot;The Spacious Firmament&quot;. On that night, some residents from Dublin (which falls outside the station&#x27;s intended broadcast area) called the station to report poor picture reception.

The following evening, UTV aired &quot;Rich and Rare&quot;, a film consisting of thirty images from across Northern Ireland produced by John Loder (then-Governor of Northern Ireland and Lord Wakehurst), followed by &quot;A Shilling for the Evil Day&quot; (a play by Irish writer Joseph Tomelty, as part of Armchair Theatre).

At launch, Ulster Television employed a staff of 100 people including six presenters: Ivor Mills and Anne Gregg were chosen as the presenters of local magazine programme &quot;Roundabout&quot;, Adrienne McGuill, James Greene and Brian Durkin were the first continuity announcers, and former rugby union international Ernest Strathdee was recruited as the station&#x27;s sports presenter.

Coverage of UTV spread to Western areas of Northern Ireland when the Strabane transmitter opened in February 1963.

===1970s–2000s===
Ulster Television&#x27;s UHF PAL colour service was launched with the opening of the UHF transmitter Divis in September 1970. This was followed by two additional transmitters at Limavady (opened in 1975) and Brougher Mountain (in 1978). In the early 1980s it broadcast reduced hours when no schools programmes were being broadcast coming on air at 12 noon during the week, and closing down every evening at 23:30 – this remained in place until 1982. In October 1988, the station began 24-hour broadcasting – the last station in the ITV network to do so. UTV was originally scheduled to take a service provided by Central in Birmingham, but a late minute decision to switch to Granada Television&#x27;s sustaining feed, &quot;Night Time&quot;, led to a month-long delay.

At the company&#x27;s annual general meeting in Belfast on 26 May 2006, the registered company name was changed from &#x27;Ulster Television plc&#x27; to &#x27;UTV plc&#x27;. The company believed that the existing name no longer reflected the full scope of the company&#x27;s business. In a further change in October 2007, UTV underwent a corporate reorganisation which saw UTV shareholders swap their shares for shares in a new holding company, UTV Media plc, which took over UTV plc&#x27;s shareholdings in the new media and radio subsidiaries. UTV Ltd. – the original Ulster Television Limited, now a wholly owned subsidiary of UTV Media – returned to being solely the operating company for the ITV franchise.

===Sale to ITV and end of local continuity===
On 19 October 2015, UTV Media announced that it would sell its ITV franchise and the UTV brand to ITV plc for £100 million, subject to regulatory approval. ITV plc CEO Adam Crozier welcomed the news by saying: &quot;UTV Television&#x27;s strategic objectives are closely aligned with our own and we are very pleased that they are joining the ITV family.&quot;

The acquisition was finalised the following February. ITV stated that they intended to retain the UTV brand in Northern Ireland.

The former UTV Media group was restructured and rebranded as the Wireless Group, retaining its radio assets until June 2016, when the company was bought by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp. On 11 July 2016, ITV plc announced that was selling the UTV Ireland service to Virgin Media Ireland for €10 million. Virgin Media Ireland was a subsidiary of Liberty Media and had already bought Ireland&#x27;s TV3 in 2015).

In October 2016, ITV announced plans to close UTV&#x27;s Havelock House studios. UTV began broadcasting from a new broadcast centre at City Quays 2 in the Belfast Harbour Estate from 1 July 2018.
Local continuity announcements ended in April 2020, effectively rebranding the channel as ITV in line with all other ITV plc regions. This change was made permanent in November 2020. The ITV channel (including UTV) rebranded as ITV1 in November 2022. The UTV name continues to be used for local programming, notably the news service &quot;UTV Live&quot;, and in on-air promotions for local non-news programmes.

==Programming==
UTV&#x27;s focus has always been on programmes made explicitly for viewers in Northern Ireland, but until the 1990s it also made a number of contributions to the ITV network and Channel 4, many of which were in some way about the province.

==Visual identity and presentation==

Before ITV branding was introduced in 2020, UTV/Ulster Television used a number of different logos, or idents on-screen over the years.
*1959 – The station&#x27;s first on-screen logo was an oscilloscope pattern made up of seven dots joined by six lines. The logo animated to a jingle based on the local folk tune &quot;The Mountains of Mourne&quot;. According to UTV&#x27;s website, the original logo was designed as part of a competition, and the winner among over 450 entrants was Mr Roy Irwin of Ballycarry.
*1970 – With the imminent launch of UHF colour broadcasts, Ulster Television redesigned its first logo – the oscilloscope pattern was retained; but the dots were removed, and the lines were encased in a television-screen shape. Monochrome and colour versions of this ident were produced, the colour using a yellow logo and text on a blue background, which were adopted as the station&#x27;s colour scheme. UTV&#x27;s ident at this time did not animate and was not accompanied by a jingle. The logo type introduced on this ident was retained until 1993.
*1980 – To celebrate their 21st anniversary, UTV commissioned a new ident featuring a model of the station logo embedded on four faces of a cube, coated in silver with a pole skewering the top and bottom of the cube. This model was then filmed on video with a black cloth background as it revolved on a turntable. When it appeared on screen, it was accompanied by a synthesised jingle, and the words &quot;Ulster Television&quot; wiped on screen in yellow text. This ident made its on-screen debut on Halloween Day 1980, and it was used until New Year&#x27;s Eve 1988.
*1987 – On 7 September 1987, to coincide with the launch of the station&#x27;s new evening magazine programme, &quot;Six Tonight&quot;, a new ident was used to introduce the programme, featuring a computer-animated silver station logo on a blue/green backdrop. After five seconds, the logo faded into the background as the titles of &quot;Six Tonight&quot; began. This ident, UTV&#x27;s first attempt at a CGI ident, was later adapted as a temporary station ident in the last few months of 1988, with a video freeze used as the logo sank into the background.
*1989 – On New Year&#x27;s Day 1989 a revised computer animation was introduced and the last to feature the oscilloscope logo and the &quot;Ulster Television&quot; name. The ident began with a panning shot over a huge plate with texture to make it look like frost or ice (possibly a white and gray cloudy texture), against a light blue background. Then, an oscilloscope rises out from the plate, and the lines of the oscilloscope pattern are formed with a wipe. In this ident, the lines of the oscilloscope are yellow, with the rest of the logo (the television screen shape) in blue. When the lines are formed, the logo turns and reveals on screen, as a grey banner flies in underneath bearing the words &quot;Ulster Television&quot; and settles underneath the station logo, waving like a flag. This ident was accompanied by a new jingle, and was used until 4 June 1993.

*1993 – At 6pm on 4 June 1993, UTV officially unveiled a new logo. This consisted of an italicised Times Roman capital U forming on screen from different component parts, settling on a blue and yellow plate with &quot;TV&quot; written in italicised red Agency FB Font text. A new jingle was also introduced with a distinct Celtic sound. Since the start of 1993, continuity announcements and trailers referred increasingly to &quot;UTV&quot;, and the station&#x27;s news service was rebranded as UTV Live. With the new logo, the use of &quot;Ulster Television&quot; to identify the station was consigned to history. It also dropped ITV network promotions and introduced locally produced trails.
*1996 – UTV introduced a new series of idents on 11 November 1996, which showcased scenic locations in Northern Ireland. These include the Giant&#x27;s Causeway, a waterfall at Glenarriff, and Portaferry harbour. These are supplemented on 12 January 1998 with a set of idents featuring people playing the UTV jingle on various musical instruments. Some of the idents featured UTV personalities. It also dropped live daytime continuity.

*2000 – On 1 July 2000, the day when programme presentation and commercials shown on the four main UK television channels switched from the 4:3 aspect ratio to 14:9 on analogue broadcasts and 16:9 on digital broadcasts, UTV refused to adopt the 1999 ITV Hearts look and introduced a new set of idents inspired by the 1989 ITV generic ident featuring a stripe on a black background using footage from the 1996 &quot;landscape&quot; idents, the break filler films used on its short-lived sister channel TV You, and a UTV corporate advertisement where a shoal of fish grouped together to form the 1993 logo. This collection of idents were the first to be created and transmitted in 16:9 aspect ratio, on digital terrestrial and digital cable providers. This was the last set of idents which used the 1993 logo, and they were phased out shortly before Christmas 2000, when a new logo was introduced.
*2001 – The 1993 logo was later replaced with a similar flatter and wider logo. The &quot;U&quot; is rendered in yellow on a blue oblong, with the &quot;TV&quot; in red on a yellow oblong contained inside the blue oblong. Its first use was in UTV&#x27;s 2000 Christmas ident, replacing the previous set. On 6 January 2001, a new series of idents shot at various locations across Northern Ireland, including the Silent Valley Reservoir in County Down, Great Victoria Street in Belfast and the &quot;Hands Across the Divide&quot; sculpture at the Craigavon Bridge, Derry. This was complemented by further idents in 2002 featuring people walking towards the camera and touching the screen with their fingers to make the UTV logo appear.
*2002 – On 28 October 2002, most of the regional ITV companies adopted a common look with the ITV1 brand replacing the various station logos. This was marked with a series of idents showing actors, presenters and newsreaders associated with ITV appearing in idents. At the same time, UTV decided to adopt these idents, but replaced the ITV logo with their own station logo. The soundtrack used on these idents was identical to those heard on the ITV network versions. This is the nearest that UTV had come to using identical idents to the rest of the ITV network. Around Christmas 2002, UTV broadcast a similar collection of idents showcasing their own presenting talent, shown in addition to the national idents. By early 2003, the network and local celebrity idents were phased out, and a generic ident showing the UTV logo on an animated blue background was used in all junctions.
*2003 – UTV replaces its network-inspired graphics on 20 November 2003 with a series landscape films of Northern Ireland in their idents, in the form of a panorama shot as the camera revolved around a location. Among the scenes used in this series of UTV idents included the Mourne Mountains, Enniskillen and Lurgan Park. These idents primarily used one of the ident jingles until 3 November 2005, when UTV reprised its 1993–2002 station jingle.
*2006 – To coincide with the introduction of a new identity across ITV plc stations on Monday 16 January 2006, UTV replaced its 2003 idents with a brand new set. The new idents featured newly recorded films shot across Northern Ireland, again in the form of panoramas. The landscape films used in these idents were updated in July 2007 and October 2008, with the background of each ident changing from black to white in December 2008. Special variations of the UTV idents were used to promote the 2006 North West 200 event, 2006 Special Olympics, the 2007 Rugby World Cup and the &quot;UTV Rewind&quot; series. 
*2016 – On 17 October 2016, a brand new look was unveiled, aligning the UTV brand more closely with that of the ITV channel. The station idents, based on those used by ITV since a major rebrand in January 2013, included the UTV logo changing colour as it blended in on a live-action scene - a process known as &quot;colour picking&quot;.
*2020 – Since 2 April 2020, UTV has taken full ITV branding and presentation from London including network announcements, idents, promos and end credit sequences. This was initially announced as a temporary measure due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on staff at the Belfast studios. Local continuity was officially abandoned in November 2020 with the departures of the announcing team.

===Local continuity===
Until April 2020, UTV was one of two stations in the ITV network – and the only one owned by ITV plc – to have its own continuity announcers.

UTV was also the last company in the network to retain in-vision continuity links, where the duty announcer appeared on-camera to introduce the evening&#x27;s programmes. In later years, local continuity was generally restricted to evenings with in-vision links presented at weekends by senior announcer Julian Simmons. In 2009, the practice was restored to weekday evenings and presented by the entire announcing team.

Following the sale of UTV, ITV plc transferred most of the station&#x27;s presentation operations from the Havelock House studios in Belfast to Red Bee Media in Chiswick, which provides playout services for most of ITV&#x27;s channels.

The last live in-vision announcement was made by Simmons at 11.15 pm on Sunday 16 October 2016, marking the end of 57 years of local transmission.

Two of UTV&#x27;s longest-serving announcers, Julian Simmons and Gillian Porter, were retained to pre-record out-of-vision continuity – with Aidan Browne providing relief cover – until 2 April 2020, when the channel began taking ITV-branded network presentation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In November 2020, it was reported the announcing team had left UTV following a decision to switch permanently to network continuity. The last known announcement, voiced by Porter, aired at 5.59 am on Thursday 2 April 2020.

In April 2021, a local voice-over started to be used over the ident before some local programmes. A new bumper with the UTV logo and the tagline &quot;Part of ITV&quot; was also shown for a short time before some – but not all – commercial breaks.

===Station theme tunes===
In common with the rest of the ITV Network, the station aired specially composed signature tunes as part of its daily start-up routine. From launch until 1971, the opening theme was &quot;Seamus&quot; by the American musician, composer and bandleader Van Phillips, who had earlier written the theme tune of the popular 1950s BBC radio science fiction drama &quot;Journey into Space&quot;. UTV&#x27;s best-known theme was &quot;The Antrim Road&quot;, a classical symphony composed by Wayne Hill and Earl Ward, which was used between 1971 and 1983. It originally featured on &quot;The British Isles&quot;, an LP of orchestral arrangements of traditional and characteristic national tunes of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The album was released on the De Wolf label in 1971.

==HD and timeshift ==

===ITV1 HD (UTV region) ===
ITV&#x27;s service for the UTV region is available in HD – like most other ITV regions – but UTV was one of the first stations in the ITV network to offer a full HD simulcast in its days as an independent company.

UTV HD, a simulcast of UTV in high-definition, was launched on Virgin Media on 5 October 2010. It became available on Freeview when the digital switchover took place on 24 October 2012 and on Sky and Freesat on 4 November 2013.

For the first few months, the only true HD content came from the ITV network but after an upgrade local material including adverts started to be played out in HD.

In May 2011, the presentation infrastructure was upgraded to become fully HD-capable in readiness for the digital switchover in 2012.

===ITV1 +1 (Services offered in Northern Ireland) ===
A delayed version of the full ITV1 service for the UTV region is available on Freeview and Virgin Media.

The timeshift service – branded UTV+1 before the station adopted ITV branding in 2020 – launched at 8pm on 11 January 2011 on Freeview and Virgin Media. UTV +1 however didn&#x27;t launch on Sky and Freesat until 21 May 2018.

On 13 April 2021, ITV stopped broadcasting UTV +1 on satellite. ITV +1 Granada was added to Sky in Northern Ireland to replace UTV +1.

== UTV 2 ==
The channel was launched on June 28, 1999, originally named TV You. In 2000, it was rebranded as UTV2. Its programming mainly featured simulcasts with ITV2, which was broadcast in England, Wales, and the Scottish Borders. 

Additionally, the channel aired archive programs from UTV. It was free from advertising and eventually closed following a deal with ITV Digital.

==UTV Ireland==
UTV Ireland was a short-lived sister station to UTV&#x27;s Northern Ireland service, broadcasting to the Republic of Ireland.

The new channel launched on New Year&#x27;s Day 2015, following approval by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.

UTV Ireland was broadcast from the company&#x27;s Dublin base at Macken House and carried a large amount of ITV&#x27;s networked programming (including &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, previously broadcast by TV3) alongside some bespoke programming, including &quot;Ireland Live&quot;, a twice nightly national news programme airing at 5.30 pm and 10 pm.

Ratings and advertising revenue were disappointing which meant the costs of the new station were greater than UTV Media had expected. This played a part in the company&#x27;s decision to sell the whole television business to ITV plc.

In July 2016, the channel was sold on by ITV to TV3 Group (now known as Virgin Media Television) which then, effectively, closed it.

It was replaced by a substantially new channel called Be3 on 9 January 2017. This new channel was rebranded as Virgin Media Three in August 2018. It focuses on children&#x27;s and female-orientated programming.

<doc id="519437" wikidata="Q41563" url="?curid=519437" title="Julia Gillard">
<text>Julia Eileen Gillard (born 29 September 1961) is an Australian former politician who was the 27th prime minister of Australia from 2010 to 2013. She held office as the leader of the Labor Party and was the member of parliament (MP) for the Victorian division of Lalor from 1998 to 2013. She previously served as the 13th deputy prime minister from 2007 to 2010, under Kevin Rudd. She is the first and only woman to hold either office in Australian history.

Born in Barry, Wales, Gillard migrated with her family to Adelaide in South Australia in 1966. She attended Mitcham Demonstration School and Unley High School. Gillard went on to study at the University of Adelaide, but switched to the University of Melbourne in 1982, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1986 and a Bachelor of Arts in 1989. During this time, she was president of the Australian Union of Students from 1983 to 1984. In 1987, Gillard joined the law firm Slater &amp; Gordon, eventually becoming a partner in 1990, specialising in industrial law. In 1996, she became chief of staff to John Brumby, the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria. Gillard was first elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 election for the seat of Lalor. Following the 2001 election, she was appointed to the shadow cabinet. In December 2006, Gillard became the running mate of Kevin Rudd in a successful leadership challenge to Kim Beazley, becoming deputy leader of the opposition. After Labor&#x27;s victory at the 2007 election, she was appointed as deputy prime minister, and was also given the roles of Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and Minister for Social Inclusion.

On , after Rudd lost internal support within the Labor Party and resigned as leader, Gillard was elected unopposed as his replacement in a leadership spill, and was sworn in as prime minister. She led Labor through the 2010 election weeks later, which saw the first hung parliament since 1940. Gillard was able to form a minority government with the support of the Greens and three independents. During its term of office, the Gillard government introduced the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), the Gonski funding, oversaw the early rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN), and controversially implemented a carbon pricing scheme, which was widely perceived as a breach of a pre-election commitment. Her premiership was often undermined by party instability and numerous scandals, including the AWU affair and the Health Services Union expenses affair. Gillard and Rudd became embroiled in a lengthy political rivalry, resulting in Gillard losing the leadership of the party back to him in a June 2013 leadership spill. Her resignation as prime minister took effect the next day, and she announced her retirement from politics.

In the years following her retirement, Gillard has been a visiting professor at the University of Adelaide, the Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution&#x27;s Center for Universal Education, the chair of the Global Partnership for Education since 2014 and the chair of Beyond Blue since 2017. She released her memoir, &quot;My Story&quot;, in September 2014. In April 2021, she became chair of the Wellcome Trust, succeeding Eliza Manningham-Buller. Although Gillard often ranked poorly in opinion polls as prime minister, her premiership has been more favourably received in retrospect. Political experts often place her in the middle-to-upper tier of Australian prime ministers.

== Early life ==
===Birth and family background===
Gillard was born on 29 September 1961 in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, Wales. She is the second of two daughters born to John Oliver Gillard (1929–2012) and the former Moira Mackenzie (born 1928); her older sister Alison was born in 1958. Gillard&#x27;s father was born in Cwmgwrach, but was of predominantly English descent; he worked as a psychiatric nurse. Her mother was born in Barry, and is of distant Scottish and Irish descent; she worked in a Salvation Army nursing home.

After Gillard suffered from bronchopneumonia as a child, her parents were advised it would aid her recovery if they were to live in a warmer climate. This led the family to migrate to Australia in 1966, settling in Adelaide, South Australia. The Gillard family&#x27;s first month in Australia was spent in the Pennington Hostel, a now-closed migrant facility located in Pennington, South Australia. In 1974, eight years after they arrived, Gillard and her family became Australian citizens. As a result, Gillard held dual citizenship until she renounced her British citizenship prior to entering the Australian parliament in 1998.
=== Education and legal career ===
Gillard attended Mitcham Demonstration School before going on to Unley High School. She began an arts degree at the University of Adelaide, during which she was president of the Adelaide University Union from 1981 to 1982. In her second year at the university, Gillard was introduced to politics by the daughter of a state Labor minister. Accordingly, she joined the Labor Club and became involved in a campaign to fight federal education budget cuts. Gillard cut short her courses in Adelaide in 1982, and moved to Melbourne to work with the Australian Union of Students. In 1983, she became the second woman to lead the Australian Union of Students, serving until the organisation&#x27;s discontinuation in 1984. She was also the secretary of the left-wing organisation Socialist Forum. Having transferred her studies to the University of Melbourne, Gillard graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1986 and a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1989. In 1987, she joined the law firm Slater &amp; Gordon in Werribee, Victoria, working in industrial law. In 1990, she was admitted as a partner; at the age of 29, she was the youngest partner within the firm, and one of the first women to hold the position.

===Early political involvement===
From 1985 to 1989, Gillard was president of the Carlton branch of the Labor Party. She stood for Labor preselection in the Division of Melbourne prior to the 1993 federal election, but was defeated by Lindsay Tanner. At the 1996 federal election, Gillard won the third position on Labor&#x27;s Senate ticket in Victoria, behind Robert Ray and Barney Cooney. However, on the final distribution of preferences she was defeated by Lyn Allison of the Australian Democrats.

In 1996, Gillard resigned from her position with Slater &amp; Gordon to serve as chief of staff to John Brumby, at that time the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria. She was responsible for drafting the affirmative-action rules within the Labor Party in Victoria that set the target of pre-selecting women for 35 per cent of &quot;winnable seats&quot;. She also played a role in the foundation of EMILY&#x27;s List, the pro-choice fund-raising and support network for Labor women.

Gillard has cited Welsh Labour politician Aneurin Bevan as one of her political heroes.

== Member of Parliament (1998–2007) ==
Gillard was first elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election representing Lalor, a safe Labor seat near Melbourne, replacing Barry Jones who retired. She made her maiden speech to the House on 11 November 1998. Gillard was a member of the standing committee for Employment, Education and Workplace Relations from 8 December 1998 to 8 December 2001, in addition to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs from 20 March 2003 to 18 August 2003. Within the joint committees, she was a member of the Public Accounts and Audit from 8 December 1998 to 11 February 2002, in addition to the Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund from 20 March 2003 to 11 August 2003.

=== Shadow Minister (2001–2007) ===

After Labor&#x27;s defeat at the 2001 federal election, Gillard was elected to the Shadow Cabinet under then-Labor Leader Simon Crean, where she was given responsibility for Population and Immigration. In February 2003, she was given additional responsibilities for Reconciliation and Indigenous Affairs. In these roles, in the wake of the Tampa and Children Overboard affairs, which were partly credited with Labor&#x27;s 2001 election loss, Gillard developed a new immigration policy for the Labor Party.

Gillard was later promoted to the position of Shadow Minister for Health and Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the House (to Mark Latham) on 2 July 2003. During this time, she shadowed Tony Abbott, with the rivalry between the two often attracting attention from the media. She was later given additional responsibility for managing opposition business in the House of Representatives by Latham, who had succeeded Beazley as Labor Party leader.

In the aftermath of Labor&#x27;s fourth consecutive defeat in the 2004 federal election it was widely speculated that Gillard might challenge Jenny Macklin for the deputy leadership, but she did not do so. Gillard had been spoken of as a potential future leader of the party for some years, but never stood in a leadership contest. After Mark Latham resigned as Labor Leader in January 2005, Gillard appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Australian Story&quot; in March 2006, after which an Ipsos Mackay poll conducted for Network Ten&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot; found that more respondents would prefer Gillard to be Labor Leader; she polled 32% compared with Beazley&#x27;s 25% and Kevin Rudd&#x27;s 18%. Although she had significant cross-factional support, she announced on 25 January 2005 that she would not contest the leadership, allowing Beazley to be elected unopposed.

===Deputy Opposition Leader (2006–2007)===
On 1 December 2006, as part of a cross-factional political partnership with Kevin Rudd, Gillard challenged Jenny Macklin for the deputy leadership. After Rudd successfully replaced Beazley as Labor Leader on 4 December 2006, Macklin chose to resign, allowing Gillard to become Deputy Leader unopposed. In the subsequent reshuffle, Gillard was allocated responsibility for Employment, Workplace Relations and Social Inclusion, as well as being made Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

== Deputy Prime Minister (2007–2010) ==

After the Labor Party&#x27;s victory in the 2007 federal election, Gillard was sworn in as the first ever female Deputy Prime Minister of Australia on 3 December 2007. In addition to being appointed to the position of Deputy Prime Minister, Gillard was given responsibility for a so-called &quot;super ministry&quot;, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.

She was a member of the Strategic Priorities Budget Committee (SPBC) – also referred to as &quot;Gang of Four&quot; – which comprised Rudd and his most senior ministers: Gillard, Treasurer Wayne Swan and Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner. Formed in late-2007 as a result of an internal review, the SPBC was responsible for the government&#x27;s handling of the 2007–08 global financial crisis.

On 11 December 2007, Gillard was acting prime minister while Rudd attended the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali, becoming the first woman ever to hold that position. She assumed these duties for a total of 69 days throughout Rudd&#x27;s tenure, during his various overseas travel engagements. Gillard quickly became known as a highly regarded debater, with her performances during parliamentary question time prompting Peter van Onselen to call her &quot;the best parliamentary performer on the Labor side&quot;.

===Ministerial portfolios===
In her role as Minister for Education, Gillard travelled to Washington, D.C., in 2009, where she signed a deal with US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to encourage improved policy collaboration in education reform between both countries. The establishment of the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA), an independent authority responsible for the development of a national curriculum, was amongst her first policy pursuits in 2008. She launched the government&#x27;s &quot;Digital Education Revolution&quot; (DER) program, which provided laptops to all public secondary school students and developed quality digital tools, resources and infrastructure for all schools. In conjunction with DER, Gillard oversaw the &quot;Building the Education Revolution&quot; (BER) program, which allocated $16 billion to build new school accommodation including classrooms, libraries and assembly halls.

Gillard also ensured the implementation of the National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) in 2008, whereby a series of standardised tests focused on basic skills are administered annually to Australian students. This was followed by the introduction of the My School website; launched in January 2010, the website reports on data from NAPLAN and displays information such as school missions, staffing, financial information, its resources and its students&#x27; characteristics.

As Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Gillard removed the WorkChoices industrial relations regime introduced by the Howard government, and replaced it with the &quot;Fair Work Act&quot;. This established a single industrial relations bureaucracy called Fair Work Australia.

== Prime Minister (2010–2013) ==
=== 2010 leadership vote ===
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd suffered a decline in his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following the failure of the Government&#x27;s insulation program, controversy regarding the implementation of a tax on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy. Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd. On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard had asked him to hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.

As late as May 2010, prior to challenging Rudd, Gillard was quipping to the media that &quot;There&#x27;s more chance of me becoming the full-forward for the Dogs than there is of any change in the Labor Party&quot;. Consequently, Gillard&#x27;s move against Rudd on 23 June appeared to surprise many Labor backbenchers. Daryl Melham, when asked by a reporter on the night of the challenge if indeed a challenge was on, replied: &quot;Complete garbage. ABC have lost all credibility.&quot; As he was being deposed, Rudd suggested that his opponents wanted to move Labor to the right, saying on 23 June: &quot;This party and government will not be lurching to the right on the question of asylum seekers, as some have counselled us to do.&quot;
Initially, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that the final catalyst for the move on Rudd was sparked by a report that Rudd had used his chief of staff to sound out back benchers on his level of support, thus implying that &quot;he did not trust the repeated assurances by Ms Gillard that she would not stand&quot;. Later, ABC&#x27;s 7:30 Report said the seeds for the challenge to Rudd came from &quot;factional heavyweights&quot; Bill Shorten and Senator David Feeney, who secured the support of &quot;New South Wales right power broker&quot; Mark Arbib and that Feeney and Arbib went to discuss a challenge with Gillard on the morning of 23 June and a final numbers count began for a challenge. Accounts have continued to differ as to the extent of Gillard&#x27;s foreknowledge and planning of the replacement of Rudd.
Rudd initially said that he would challenge Gillard, but it soon became apparent that he did not have enough support within the party to survive in his position. Hours before the vote on 24 June, he resigned as prime minister and Leader of the Labor Party, leaving Gillard to assume the leadership unopposed. Treasurer Wayne Swan was at the same time elected unopposed to succeed Gillard as Deputy Leader.

Shortly afterward, Gillard was sworn in as the 27th prime minister of Australia by Governor-General Quentin Bryce, with Swan being sworn in as deputy prime minister. The members of the Rudd Ministry, with the exception of Rudd himself who returned to the backbenches, subsequently became the members of the First Gillard Ministry. It was the first time in Australian history that both the head of state as well as the head of government were female.

Later that day, in her first press conference as prime minister, Gillard said that at times the Rudd government &quot;went off the tracks&quot;, and &quot;[I] came to the view that a good Government was losing its way&quot;. Gillard offered wider explanation of her motivations for replacing Rudd during the 2012 Labor leadership spill in which Rudd challenged Gillard to regain the Labor leadership, telling the media that the Rudd government had entered a &quot;period of paralysis&quot; and that Rudd&#x27;s work patterns were &quot;difficult and chaotic&quot;.

Upon her election by the Labor Party, Gillard said that she wouldn&#x27;t move into The Lodge until she was elected prime minister in her own right, instead choosing to divide her time between a flat in Canberra and her home in Altona, a western suburb of Melbourne. Gillard moved into The Lodge on 26 September 2010.

As well as being the first female prime minister, and the first never to have married, Gillard is the first prime minister since Billy Hughes to have been born overseas.

The leadership question remained a feature of the Gillard government&#x27;s terms in office, and amidst ongoing leadership speculation following an ABC TV &quot;Four Corners&quot; examination of the events leading up to Rudd&#x27;s replacement which cast doubt on Gillard&#x27;s insistence that she did not actively campaign for the Prime Ministership, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon spoke of Rudd&#x27;s record in the following terms: &quot;I don&#x27;t think we should whitewash history – while there are a lot of very good things our government did with Kevin as prime minister, there were also a lot of challenges, and it&#x27;s Julia who has seen through fixing a lot of those problems.&quot;

=== 2010 election ===
On 17 July 2010, 23 days after becoming prime minister and after receiving the agreement of the Governor-General Quentin Bryce, Gillard announced the next federal election would be held on 21 August 2010. Gillard began campaigning with a speech using the slogan &quot;moving forward&quot;. In the early stages of the campaign, a series of leaks were released by purported Labor Party sources, indicating apparent divisions within Cabinet over the replacement of Kevin Rudd by Gillard. Midway through the campaign, Gillard offered journalists a self-assessment of her campaign by saying that she had been paying too much attention to advisers in her strategy team, and she wanted to run a less &quot;stage-managed&quot; campaign:

Gillard met Opposition leader Tony Abbott for one official debate during the campaign. Studio audience surveys by Channel Nine and the Seven Network suggested a win to Gillard. Unable to agree on further debates, the leaders went on to appear separately on stage for questioning at community forums in Sydney and Brisbane, Queensland. An audience exit poll of the Rooty Hill RSL audience indicated an Abbott victory. Gillard won the audience poll at the Broncos Leagues Club meeting in Brisbane on 18 August. Gillard also appeared on the ABC&#x27;s Q&amp;A program on 9 August. On 7 August, Gillard was questioned by former Labor leader turned Channel Nine reporter Mark Latham.

Gillard officially &quot;launched&quot; Labor&#x27;s campaign in Brisbane five days before polling day, outlining Labor policies and using the slogan: &quot;Yes we will move forward together&quot;.

Labor and the Coalition each won 72 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, four short of the requirement for majority government, resulting in the first hung parliament since the 1940 election. Labor suffered an 11-seat swing, even though it won a bare majority of the two-party vote. Both major party leaders sought to form a minority government.

Six crossbench MPs held the balance of power. Four crossbench MPs, Greens Adam Bandt and independents Andrew Wilkie, Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor declared their support for Labor on confidence and supply, allowing Gillard and Labor to remain in power with a minority government. Governor-General Bryce swore in the Second Gillard Ministry on 14 September 2010.

=== Domestic policies ===
====Economy====
Gillard came to office in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2007–2008. Government receipts fell during the international downturn and the Rudd government had employed pump priming expenditure. Upon taking over as leader of the Labor Party on 24 June 2010, Gillard said she could &quot;assure&quot; Australians that the Federal Budget would be in surplus in 2013. The Government continued to promise this outcome until December 2012. Gillard initially ruled out a &quot;carbon tax&quot; but said that she would build community consensus for a price on carbon and open negotiations with the mining industry for a re-vamped mining profits tax. Following the 2010 hung parliament election result, the Labor Party elected to adopt the Australian Greens preference for a carbon tax to transition to an emissions trading scheme, establishing a carbon price via the Clean Energy Act 2011. The government also introduced a revised Minerals Resource Rent Tax and the Queensland Flood Levy.

In his 2012–13 Budget, Treasurer Swan announced that the government would deliver a $1.5 billion surplus. The government cut defence and foreign aid spending. In December 2012, Swan announced that the government no longer expected to achieve a surplus, citing falling revenue and global economic conditions.

====Health====
Like her predecessor Rudd, Gillard had said that health is a priority in her agenda. She announced during the 2010 election, that there would be an increase of 270 placements for emergency doctors and nurses and 3,000 extra nursing scholarships over the following 10 years. She also said mental health would be a priority in her second term, with a $277 million suicide-prevention package which would target high-risk groups. As the election delivered a hung parliament, a $1.8 billion package was given to rural hospitals, which was agreed to by the independents to support her re-election.

In October 2010, her government introduced legislation to reform funding arrangements for the health system, with the intention of giving the Commonwealth responsibility for providing the majority of funding to public hospitals and 100 per cent of funding for primary care and GP services. In February 2011, Gillard announced extensive revision of the original health funding reforms proposed by the Rudd government, which had been unable to secure the support of all state governments. The revised Gillard government plan proposed that the federal government move towards providing 50% of new health funding (and not 60 per cent as originally agreed) and removed the requirement of the states to cede a proportion of their GST revenue to the Federal Government to fund the new arrangement. The new agreement was supported by all state premiers and chief ministers and signed on 2 August.

====Immigration====

In relation to population targets for Australia, Gillard told Fairfax Media in August 2010 that while skilled migration is important: &quot;I don&#x27;t support the idea of a big Australia&quot;. Gillard also altered the nomenclature of Tony Burke&#x27;s role as &quot;Minister for Population&quot; to that of &quot;Minister for Sustainable Population&quot;. The Government released a &quot;sustainable population strategy&quot; in May 2011 which did not specify a target population. In October 2011 trade minister Craig Emerson released a paper with Gillard&#x27;s approval which advocated for continued rapid rates of population growth.

After winning leadership of the Labor Party, Gillard identified addressing the issue of unauthorised arrivals of asylum seekers as a priority of her government. She announced that negotiations were underway for a return to &quot;offshore processing&quot; of asylum seeker claims. Gillard ruled out a return to processing at Nauru and named East Timor as a preferred location for new detention and processing facilities. The East Timorese government rejected the plan.

In October 2010, her government announced that it would open two detention centres for 2000 immigrants, due to the pressures in allowing women and children to be released into the community. One was to be opened in Inverbrackie, South Australia, and one in Northam, Western Australia. She said it would be a short-term solution to the problem and that temporary detention centres would be closed.

On 15 December 2010, a ship containing 89 asylum seekers crashed on the shore of Christmas Island, killing up to fifty people. Refugee and migrant advocates condemned the government&#x27;s hardline policy as responsible for the tragedy, and Labor Party president Anna Bligh called for a complete review of the party&#x27;s asylum seeker policy. Gillard returned early from holidays in response to the crash, and to review asylum seeker policy. Some months later Gillard would announce &quot;The Malaysia Solution&quot; in response.

In April 2011, Australia&#x27;s federal government confirmed that a detention centre for single men would be built at the old army barracks at Pontville, 45 minutes north of Hobart, Tasmania. This immigration detention centre would house up to 400 refugees. Also in April 2011, immigration detainees at the Villawood detention centre rioted in protest of their treatment, setting fire to several buildings.

In May 2011, Gillard announced that Australia and Malaysia were finalising an arrangement to exchange asylum seekers. Gillard and Immigration Minister Chris Bowen said they were close to signing a bilateral agreement which would result in 800 asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat being taken to Malaysia instead. Australia would take 4,000 people from Malaysia who have previously been assessed as being refugees. However, on 31 August, the High Court ruled that the agreement to transfer refugees from Australia to Malaysia was invalid, and ordered that it not proceed. Australia would still accept 4,000 people who have been assessed as refugees in Malaysia.

The asylum seeker debate returned during August 2012 following the report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, led by retired Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston. Accepting the panel&#x27;s recommendation, Gillard on 12 August 2012 announced that a bill then before Parliament would be amended to allow the Government to choose sites for off-shore processing. At the same time she announced the Government would nominate the former detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island, Papua New Guinea to be re-opened. The amended bill passed with the support of the Opposition on 16 August 2012.

====Education====

Gillard held the responsibilities of the Education portfolio for four days after becoming prime minister, before appointing Simon Crean as Education Minister on 28 June 2010. Following the 2010 election, Peter Garrett assumed the role of Minister for Education, where he remained until June 2013. Gillard also altered the nomenclature of &quot;Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research&quot; to comprise tertiary education; Chris Evans, Chris Bowen, and later, Craig Emerson, each was Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research in the Gillard government.

At the July 2010 National Press Club, Gillard stated &quot;I will make education central to my economic agenda because of the role it plays in developing the skills that lead to rewarding and satisfying work – and that can build a high-productivity, high-participation economy.&quot; The Gillard government in January 2011 extended tax cuts to parents to help pay for stationery, textbooks or computer equipment under the Education Tax Refund scheme.

As Education Minister under Rudd, Gillard commissioned David Gonski to be chairman of a committee to make recommendations regarding funding of education in Australia. The findings and recommendations of the committee were later presented to the Gillard government in November 2011, whereafter deliberations were entered into by the Federal and state governments to consider its content. The committee&#x27;s report is known as the Gonski Report. Subsequently, the proposed reforms (an increase in funding) became known as &quot;Gonski&quot; and supporters urged governments to &quot;Give a Gonski&quot;. The report was removed from the government website by the newly elected Abbott government after the 2013 Federal election and is preserved by Australia&#x27;s Pandora Archive.

Gillard continued to put the My School website centre of her education agenda, which was controversial at the time when she implemented it as Minister for Education. Although it was popular amongst parents, the website helped parents view statistics of the school their children attended. She had since unveiled the revamped version, My School 2.0, promising better information to parents.

Universities also placed highly on her education agenda. Legislation which would have been voted on in November 2010 would have seen the introduction of a national universities regulator; however, this was delayed until 2011 following criticisms from the higher education sector. It was also announced by her government that legislation to establish the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency would also be introduced early 2011.

====Climate change====
The Rudd Labor opposition promised to implement an emissions trading scheme (ETS) before the 2007 federal election which Labor won. Rudd, unable to secure support for his scheme in the Senate, dropped it. During his 2012 leadership challenge against Gillard&#x27;s prime ministership, Rudd said that it was Gillard and Swan who convinced him to delay his Emissions Trading Scheme.

In the 2010 election campaign, Gillard pledged to build a &quot;national consensus&quot; for a carbon price by creating a &quot;citizens assembly&quot;, to examine &quot;the evidence on climate change, the case for action and the possible consequences of introducing a market-based approach to limiting and reducing carbon emissions&quot;, over the course of one year. The assembly was to be selected by an independent authority who would select people from the electoral roll using census data. The plan was never implemented. After the 2010 Election, Gillard agreed to form a minority government with the Greens and Independents and replaced her &quot;citizens assembly&quot; plan with a climate change panel consisting of Labor, Greens and independent members of the Australian parliament. The panel ultimately announced backing for a temporary carbon tax, leading up to an Emissions Trading Scheme.

During the 2010 election campaign, Gillard also said that no carbon tax would be introduced under a government she led. In the first hung parliament result in 70 years, the Gillard government, with the support of the Australian Greens and some cross bench independents, negotiated the implementation of a carbon tax (the preferred policy of the Australian Greens), by which a fixed-price carbon tax would proceed to a floating-price ETS within a few years under the plans. The government proposed the Clean Energy Bill in February 2011, which the opposition claimed to be a broken election promise.

The bill was passed by the Lower House in October 2011 and the Upper House in November 2011.

====Poker machines====
In 2010, Gillard agreed with Nick Xenophon, Andrew Wilkie and the Australian Greens to introduce poker machine reform legislation (to curb problem gambling) into the Australian parliament by May 2012. After members of the cross bench advised that they would not support this bill in the Australian House of Representatives, Gillard withdrew her support. Wilkie said that many Australians felt &quot;very let down by the PM&quot;, and fellow anti-gambling campaigner Xenophon accused the Prime Minister of &quot;backstabbing the person who put her in office&quot;.

On 21 January 2012, Wilkie announced that he was withdrawing his support for the Gillard government after it broke the agreement he had signed with Gillard to implement mandatory precommitment for all poker machines by 2014. He stated that he would support the government&#x27;s alternative plan to trial pre-commitment in the ACT and require that pre-commitment technology be installed in all poker machines built from 2013, but that this fell short of what he had been promised in return for supporting the government. In response, Gillard and Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Jenny Macklin argued that there was not enough support in the House of Representatives for Wilkie&#x27;s preferred option for it to be passed, and that they had been advised it was technically unfeasible to implement mandatory commitment within the time frame he had specified.

====Same-sex marriage====
The triennial Labor conference held in December 2011 saw Gillard successfully negotiate an amendment on same-sex marriage to see the party introduce a conscience vote to parliament through a private member&#x27;s bill, rather than a binding vote. Despite Gillard, who had previously stated her personal objection to same-sex marriage, the motion passed narrowly by 208 votes to 184. In February 2012, two bills to allow same-sex marriage in Australia were introduced in the 43rd Parliament.

On 19 September 2012, the House of Representatives voted against passing its same-sex marriage bill by a margin of 98–42 votes. On 21 September 2012, the Senate also voted down its same-sex marriage legislation, by a vote of 41–26.

====Forced adoptions====
On 21 March 2013, Gillard delivered a national apology on behalf of the Australian Parliament to all those affected by the forced adoption practices that took place in Australia from the late–1950s to the 1970s. The apology, held in the Great Hall of Parliament House, was well–received by the 800 attendees, most of whom were victims or shared a connection to these practices. Gillard opened her speech by announcing that the Parliament would take responsibility for the practice of forced adoptions:

In the speech, Gillard committed to $5 million worth of specialist support and records tracing for victims of forced adoptions, and an additional $1.5 million towards the National Archives of Australia &quot;to record the experiences of those affected by forced adoption through a special exhibition.&quot;

=== Commonwealth ===
Gillard represented Australia at the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in London in April 2011 and hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Perth in October of that year. The Perth CHOGM saw the historic announcement, by Gillard and British Prime Minister David Cameron, of changes to the succession laws regarding to thrones of the Commonwealth realms, overturning rules privileging male over female heirs to the line of succession and removing a ban on Roman Catholic consorts. At the CHOGM, Gillard also hosted Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia in what ended up being the monarch&#x27;s final tour Down Under.

=== Foreign affairs ===

During her first major international tour as prime minister in late 2010, Gillard told ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;7.30 Report&quot;:

When Gillard replaced Rudd in 2010, Stephen Smith retained the portfolio of Foreign Affairs up until the 2010 election, when he was moved to Defence. Following her 2010 election victory, Gillard selected her former leader Kevin Rudd (a career diplomat) as Foreign Minister. After Rudd&#x27;s unsuccessful leadership challenge in February 2012, Gillard appointed Bob Carr to succeed Rudd as Foreign Affairs Minister. When Gillard was not present in the Australia due to international commitments, or in other circumstances, Wayne Swan assumed the title of acting prime minister; when neither leader nor deputy were present in Australia, Leader of the Government in the Senate Chris Evans assumed the role, as occurred in October and November 2012.

After the creation of a no-fly zone, which Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd vocally supported, Gillard voiced strong support for the 2011 military intervention in Libya.

The Gillard government released the &quot;Asian Century White Paper&quot; in October 2012, offering a strategic framework for &quot;Australia&#x27;s navigation of the Asian Century&quot;. The report included focus on Australia&#x27;s relations with China, India, the key ASEAN countries as well as Japan and South Korea.

On 19 October 2012, Australia secured election to a seat as a Non-Permanent Member of the United Nations Security Council. The initiative had been launched by the Rudd government, and further pursued under the Gillard government.

====Afghanistan====

On her first day as prime minister, Gillard reassured US president Barack Obama of Australia&#x27;s continuing support for the military campaign in Afghanistan, which was then in its ninth year of operation.

She visited Afghanistan on 2 October 2010, meeting with members of the Australian Defence Force in Tarinkot, and President Hamid Karzai in Kabul. The visit marked her first foreign trip as prime minister. Following the visit, A parliamentary debate was conducted for four sitting weeks of parliament in November 2010, with the agreement between Gillard and Abbott that it would be necessary for Australian soldiers to stay in Afghanistan and prevent it from becoming a safe haven for terrorists. She made her second trip to Afghanistan on 7 November 2011; much like her first trip, Gillard visited the 1,550 Australian troops based in Tarinkot, before meeting Karzai in Kabul where the two discussed the transition plans for Afghan military control. Whilst in Kabul, she opened Australia&#x27;s newest embassy in Afghanistan.

In April 2012, Gillard announced at a speech to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute that her government would withdraw all Australian combat forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2013, a year earlier than anticipated; nevertheless, she also committed Australia to long-term military and financial support for Afghanistan in the years following the 2014 transition to military control. Gillard made her third and final trip to the country on 15 October 2012, where she met with President Kurzai, the governor of the Urozgan Province, before visiting the troops based in the aforementioned province.

====India====
Relations between Australia and India improved throughout Gillard&#x27;s premiership, following a strained period between the two countries as a result of the Rudd government&#x27;s decision to ban uranium sales to India in 2007, and the prolonged attacks against Indians living in Australia during 2009 to 2010.

In November 2011, Gillard announced a desire to allow uranium exports to India, as a matter of &quot;national interest, a decision about strengthening our strategic partnership with India in this the Asian century.&quot; The Rudd government had previously blocked uranium sales to India as a result of the Indian Government not being a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The change in policy was supported a month later at the Labor Party National Conference, and Gillard reversed Australia&#x27;s ban on exporting uranium to India on 4 December 2011. Gillard further expressed that any future agreement to sell uranium to India would include strict safeguards to ensure it would only be used for civilian purposes, and not end up in nuclear weapons.

Gillard made her prime-ministerial visit to India on 16 October 2012, for a three-day bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, where they negotiated the safeguards required prior to the commencement of uranium trading between India and Australia. The prospect of a quick trading arrangement was downplayed by both leaders in 2012; nevertheless, Gillard&#x27;s efforts in brokering the deal was a precursor of the agreement being finalised between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, in 2014. This was her second trip to India whilst in Government; on 31 August 2009, Gillard, then–deputy prime minister, met in India with Minister of Human Resource Development Kapil Sibal for the purpose of discussing the Australian Government&#x27;s response to the string of attacks on Indian people living in Australia and attending Australian educational institutions.

====New Zealand====
Gillard maintained the close bonds between Australia and New Zealand throughout her tenure as prime minister. She had a close working relationship with her New Zealand counterpart, Prime Minister John Key, who was among the first international leaders to congratulate Gillard on gaining the premiership in June 2010. In late 2010, the World Trade Organization overturned Australia&#x27;s 1921 import restriction on New Zealand apples on the basis such ban was &#x27;unscientific&#x27;, after the New Zealand Government had appealed against a decision by the Rudd government which imposed further quarantine measures. Gillard and Key had previously made a symbolic bet on the outcome of the 2011 Rugby World Cup held in New Zealand, whereby the losing team of either leader would eat an apple of whichever of the two countries won; New Zealand won, and Gillard would later honour the bet in February 2013, during a dinner with Key.

On 15 February 2011, Gillard made her first trip to New Zealand, during which she met with Key and held a luncheon with business leaders in Auckland. It marked the first New Zealand visit of a prime minister since Howard visited in 2007. To conclude her two-day visit to New Zealand, Gillard travelled to Wellington on 16 February, where she became the first foreign dignitary to address the New Zealand Parliament in its history. In her speech, Gillard reflected on the countries&#x27; close ties to one another, their shared defence history, and efforts to increase economic cooperation. Her second visit to New Zealand, coincided with the September 2011 gathering of the Pacific Islands Forum, held in Auckland, of which both Australia and New Zealand are members. Gillard made her final trip to New Zealand on 9 February 2013; visiting Queenstown, she and Prime Minister Key announced a deal on asylum seekers, which would see New Zealand accept 150 refugees annually from Australia, starting in 2014.

====United States====

In a 2008 speech in Washington, Gillard endorsed the ANZUS Alliance and described the United States as a civilising global influence. Her former colleague and leader Mark Latham wrote in a 2009 article for the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; that these comments were &quot;hypocritical&quot;, given past private communications Gillard had exchanged with him which apparently mocked elements of American foreign policy: &quot;One of them concerned her study tour of the US, sponsored by the American Government in 2006—or to use her moniker—&#x27;a CIA re-education course&#x27;. She asked me to &#x27;stand by for emails explaining George Bush is a great statesman, torture is justified in many circumstances and those Iraqi insurgents should just get over it&#x27;.&quot;

On 9 March 2011, Gillard travelled to the United States to mark the 60th Anniversary of the ANZUS Alliance. She held formal meetings with President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. She also met with First Lady Michelle Obama, and senior US Senator John McCain. Gillard addressed a joint session of the United States Congress, becoming the fourth Australian leader to do so and first foreign dignitary to address the 112th congress. In her speech to Congress, Gillard reiterated Australia&#x27;s diplomatic and security alliance with the United States, and noted that the United States has &quot;a true friend down under ... In both our countries, true friends stick together – in both our countries real mates talk straight ... So as a friend I urge you only this – be worthy to your best traditions. Be bold.&quot;

=== Gender politics ===
During the course of Gillard&#x27;s prime ministership, sexism had been a contentious issue for a number of Labor and Greens Party figures, as well as some commentators. Former Labor Party advisor Anne Summers said in 2012 that &quot;Gillard is being persecuted both because she is a woman and in ways that would be impossible to apply to a man&quot;. In reply, journalist Peter Hartcher wrote, &quot;She was a woman when she was popular; she can&#x27;t be unpopular now because she&#x27;s a woman. The change is a result of her actions in office, not her gender.&quot;

====Misogyny speech====

In an August 2012 press conference regarding the AWU affair, Gillard was critical of &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper for writing about her connection to the affair and of what she called &quot;misogynist nut jobs on the internet&quot;. Gillard said that she had been &quot;the subject of a very sexist smear campaign&quot;. In early October, the Opposition Leader&#x27;s wife, Margie Abbott, accused the Gillard government of a deliberate campaign to smear Tony Abbott, on gender issues.

On 9 October 2012, Gillard also raised &quot;sexism and misogyny&quot; in a speech opposing a motion to remove Peter Slipper, her choice as Speaker of the House of Representatives, after revelations of inappropriate conduct on his part became public. Gillard linked the speech to the context of the then ongoing Alan Jones &quot;died of shame&quot; controversy. The speech was widely reported around the world. In Laos soon after for an Asian-European leaders conference, Gillard described comments by François Hollande and Helle Thorning-Schmidt: &quot;The president of France congratulated me on the speech, as did the Prime Minister of Denmark, and some other leaders, just casually as I&#x27;ve moved around, have also mentioned it to me.&quot; US president Barack Obama reportedly &quot;complimented&quot; Gillard on the speech in a private conversation following his re-election, and his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the speech as &quot;very striking&quot; with Gillard going &quot;chapter and verse&quot;.

Labor had secured the defection of Slipper from the Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP) to sit in the Speaker&#x27;s chair a year earlier, but he was forced to stand aside from his main duties in April 2012 pending the conclusion of a criminal investigation. After a week of controversy, Gillard announced that she was asking Slipper to delay his return to the chair pending the conclusion of concurrent civil proceedings, in an effort to dispel what she described as a &quot;dark cloud&quot; over her government (a reference also to the ongoing Craig Thomson affair involving a Labor MP linked to corruption allegations).

=== 2012 leadership vote ===


In the light of poor polling results for the Gillard government, speculation that Foreign Minister and former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd wished to challenge Gillard for the leadership culminated with Rudd resigning from the Cabinet on 22 February 2012. Rudd told the media &quot;I can only serve as Foreign Minister if I have the confidence of Prime Minister Gillard and her senior ministers&quot; after Gillard failed to repudiate cabinet ministers who publicly criticised Rudd and his tenure as prime minister. The situation had been further exacerbated by the revelation on &quot;Four Corners&quot; that Gillard&#x27;s staff wrote her victory speech for the 2010 leadership election two weeks prior to her challenge, contradicting Gillard&#x27;s earlier claims that she had only resolved to challenge Rudd the day before the vote. This revelation caused particular conflict between Labor factions to surface, with Labor MP Darren Cheeseman calling on Gillard to resign, while his colleague Steve Gibbons called Rudd a &quot;psychopath with a giant ego&quot;.

After resigning, Rudd stated that he did not think Gillard could defeat the Coalition at the next election and that, since his resignation, he had received encouragement from Labor MPs and Cabinet Ministers to contest the leadership. Gillard responded to these developments by announcing a leadership ballot for the morning of 27 February 2012, saying that if she lost the vote she would return to the backbench and renounce any claims to the leadership. She asked that Rudd make the same commitment.

At the leadership ballot, Gillard won comfortably by a vote of 71 to 31.

=== March 2013 leadership vote ===

Despite Gillard&#x27;s defeating Kevin Rudd comfortably in the 2012 leadership spill, tensions remained in the Labor Party regarding Gillard&#x27;s leadership. After Labor&#x27;s polling position worsened in the wake of Gillard announcing the date of the 2013 election, these tensions came to a head when former Labor Leader and Regional Minister Simon Crean called for a leadership spill and backed Rudd on 21 March 2013. In response, Gillard sacked Crean from his position, and called a leadership spill for 4.30 pm that same day.

Ten minutes before the ballot was due to occur, Rudd publicly announced that he would not contest the leadership, in line with the commitment he had made following the 2012 contest. As such, Gillard and Wayne Swan were the only candidates for the Leadership and Deputy Leadership of the Labor Party, and were elected unopposed. This marked the first time in history that an incumbent Labor Leader was elected unopposed at a leadership ballot. Several ministers subsequently resigned from the government, including Chief Government Whip Joel Fitzgibbon, Human Services Minister Kim Carr, and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson.

Gillard declared that the question of the Labor leadership was now &quot;settled&quot;. Nevertheless, speculation on Gillard&#x27;s leadership remained a major issue, with polling results indicating an electoral disaster were she to lead the Labor Party into the election. In light of this, media attention once more turned to Kevin Rudd as a possible replacement in the short term. It was reported that Gillard&#x27;s supporter Bill Shorten was under pressure to ask her to resign, creating a vacancy that Rudd would contest.

=== June 2013 leadership vote ===
By the end of June 2013, Labor&#x27;s standing in the polls had worsened, and the Coalition had been leading in most opinion polls for two years; one poll in early June showed that Labor would be reduced to as few as 40 seats after the next election. With a general election due later that year, even some staunch Gillard supporters began to believe that Labor faced almost certain defeat if Gillard continued as leader. According to the ABC&#x27;s Barrie Cassidy, the question was not whether Gillard would be ousted as Labor leader, but when the ousting would take place.

Following further speculation over her leadership, on 26 June a rumour emerged that supporters of Kevin Rudd were collecting signatures for a letter demanding an immediate leadership vote. That afternoon, before any letter had been published, Gillard called a leadership spill live on television. She challenged any would-be opponent to join her in a pledge that, while the winner would become leader, the loser would immediately retire from politics. Despite his earlier comments that he would not return to the leadership under any circumstances, Kevin Rudd announced that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost. In the party-room ballot later that evening, Rudd defeated Gillard by a margin of 57 votes to 45.

===Resignation and retirement from politics===

Following her defeat in the leadership vote on 26 June 2013, Gillard congratulated Rudd on his win and announced that she would immediately tender her resignation as Prime Minister to the Governor-General, Quentin Bryce. She also announced, in keeping with her pledge before the leadership vote, that she would not re-contest her Labor seat at the upcoming election, and thus would retire from politics. In her final speech, she reflected on the honour of being the first female head of government in Australia and expressed confidence for the future of women leaders in Australia:

Gillard&#x27;s resignation as Prime Minister took effect the following day, upon the swearing in of Rudd, and she made her final appearance in the House of Representatives shortly thereafter. Her parliamentary service ended at the dissolution of the Parliament on 5 August. By the conclusion of her tenure, Gillard overtook Gough Whitlam as the 15th longest–serving Prime Minister of Australia, having served in the position for three full years. She also became the longest–serving Prime Minister since John Howard&#x27;s electoral loss in 2007, a record which was not exceeded until August 2021, when Scott Morrison overtook her as the 14th longest–serving Prime Minister of Australia.

Subsequent to the federal election held on 7 September 2013, Gillard was succeeded as the Member for Lalor by her preferred replacement, Joanne Ryan, a former school principal.

== Political positions ==

===Political philosophy===
Although nominally a member of the Victorian Left faction of the Labor Party, her election to Prime Minister occurred because of support from the Labor Right faction, with the Labor Left planning to support Rudd in the Caucus vote had there actually been one. Analyses of Jacqueline Kent&#x27;s 2009 biography of Gillard suggest that her membership in the Left faction is &quot;more organisational than ideological&quot;. In July 2010, historian Ross Fitzgerald said that &quot;at least since [2009] Gillard has sought to reposition herself more towards the Labor Right.&quot;

=== Civil liberties and democracy ===
Gillard supports Australia becoming a republic and has suggested that the end of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign would be &quot;probably the appropriate point for a transition&quot;. Following the elevation of republican Malcolm Turnbull to the prime-ministership in September 2015, Gillard along with Rudd tweeted their support for Peter FitzSimons, the head of the Australian Republican Movement, and his call for new members to join the movement.

Following the November 2010 release of secret United States diplomatic cables, Gillard stated, &quot;I absolutely condemn the placement of this information on the WikiLeaks website. It&#x27;s a grossly irresponsible thing to do and an illegal thing to do.&quot; After an Australian Federal Police investigation failed to find WikiLeaks had broken any Australian laws by publishing the US diplomatic documents, Gillard maintained her stance that the release of the documents was &quot;grossly irresponsible&quot;.

===Social policy===
Gillard expressed support for legal abortion in 2005, saying that &quot;Women without money would be left without that choice or in the hands of backyard abortion providers&quot; and that she understood &quot;the various moral positions&quot; regarding abortions. Pertaining to unplanned pregnancies and counselling, Gillard is of the view that women ought to be couselled by someone of their choice – as opposed to only trained professionals referred to by their general practitioners. In August 2012, Gillard reiterated her position in support of abortion, stating that &quot;Women must have the right to healthcare and women must have the right to choose.&quot;

In response to a 2012 report by think-tank Australia 21, which recommended the relaxation of illicit drug laws in Australia, Gillard rejected the report and claimed that &quot;drugs kill people they rip families apart, they destroy lives ... I am not in favour of decriminalisation of any of our drug laws.&quot;

Concerning euthanasia, Gillard warned that it may &quot;open the door to exploitation and perhaps callousness towards people in the end stage of life&quot; and that she is not convinced that the policy of pro-euthanasia advocates contain &quot;sufficient safeguards&quot;.

Gillard, as a member of parliament, voted against a bill that would have legalised same-sex marriage in Australia in 2011. In 2010 she stated &quot;the Marriage Act is appropriate in its current form, that is recognising that marriage is between a man and a woman&quot; and that marriage being between a man and woman &quot;has a special status&quot;. The triennial Labor conference held in December 2011 saw Gillard successfully negotiate an amendment on same-sex marriage to see the party introduce a conscience vote to parliament through a private member&#x27;s bill, rather than a binding vote. When the private members bill was introduced by Labor backbencher Stephen Jones, it was defeated in the House of Representatives on 19 September 2012. In September 2014, Gillard said that the &quot;course of human history now is that we are going to see same-sex marriage here and in, you know, most parts of the developed world.&quot; She declared her support for same-sex marriage in August 2015.

==Post-political career (2013–present)==
===Publications and appearances===

In July 2013, Gillard signed a book deal for her memoirs with Penguin Australia. The autobiography, &quot;My Story&quot;, was published in 2014 by Random House. In the book, Gillard reflects on various personal aspects of her life and career, including her own analysis of the people and key players during the Rudd–Gillard governments. Senator Nick Xenophon was said to have been &quot;infamously excluded from university for a period as punishment for stuffing a ballot box full of voting papers he had somehow procured&quot;, which was denied by Xenophon. In February 2015, Random House issued a public apology to Xenophon and paid a confidential cash settlement. Following requests from Xenophon for a personal apology from Gillard, on 6 August 2015 she published a personal apology to him in a number of Australian newspapers.

Following her departure from parliament at the 2013 election, Gillard has remained engaged with the Labor Party. After Labor&#x27;s defeat at the federal election held in September 2013, Gillard penned an op-ed for &quot;Guardian Australia&quot;, wherein she wrote about her legacy and how she believes the Labor Party ought to rebuild. In June 2015, Gillard participated in Sarah Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;The Killing Season&quot;, a three-part documentary series which chronicles the events of the Rudd–Gillard years in power. The television series featured in-depth interviews with key Labor Party officials during the Rudd–Gillard governments. Prior to the 2016 election campaign, Gillard offered her assistance to the Labor party, whereby a video was released of her endorsing and seeking donations for the party&#x27;s education policy. She later joined former Labor Prime Ministers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating at Bill Shorten&#x27;s Labor campaign launch on 19 June 2016.

She had been a supporter of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s Democratic Party candidacy for President of the United States, from as early as September 2014 when Gillard announced that she would &quot;loudly barrack from the sidelines&quot; should Clinton run. Having endorsed Clinton after she announced her candidacy in April 2015, Gillard appeared in a campaign video in October, wherein she advocated for the presidential candidate and her leadership surrounding women&#x27;s issues. Gillard attended the first day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on 25 July 2016, alongside former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The following day, Gillard published an open letter to Clinton in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, urging voters to &quot;shame sexism&quot; levied against the Democratic presidential candidate.

===Honours and appointments===
In April 2014, Gillard was admitted to the degree of Doctor of Victoria University, honoris causa, for her accomplishments surrounding education and disability reform as a political leader. On 11 February 2015, Gillard received an honorary doctorate from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel &quot;for her achievements as a woman committed to education and to social inclusion, and for the impact of her commitment on the situation of children, youngsters and women worldwide&quot;; and she also held a Kapuscinski Development Lecture on &quot;the importance of education in development contexts&quot; at the said university. In October, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Canberra, for her work in &quot;education and gender equality.&quot; In January 2016 she opened the Julia Gillard Library in the Melbourne suburb of Tarneit; the library&#x27;s name was selected by the Wyndham City Council to recognise her contributions as both the local member of parliament and prime minister. Gillard was conferred an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by Deakin University, for her promotion of &quot;education opportunities in Australia, especially to groups under-represented in higher education&quot;, in December 2016.

Having moved back to Adelaide, Gillard was appointed an honorary visiting professor of Politics at the University of Adelaide in 2013. In October of that year, she joined the Brookings Institution&#x27;s Center for Universal Education as a nonresident senior fellow. In February 2014, Gillard was appointed chairwoman of the Global Partnership for Education, an international organisation focused on getting all children into school for a quality education in the world&#x27;s poorest countries. Later that year, in December, Gillard joined the board of the mental health organisation Beyond Blue, chaired by former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett. Kennett announced on 21 March 2017 that he would be stepping down from the position during the second–half of the year, almost 17 years after founding the organisation; Gillard succeeded him as chair of Beyond Blue on 1 July 2017, becoming the first former prime minister since Malcolm Fraser to head a mental-health organisation. Since February 2015 she has been the patron of the John Curtin Prime Ministerial Library at Curtin University in Perth. On 30 June 2015, she was conferred with a fellowship from Aberystwyth University in recognition of her &quot;significant contribution to political life&quot;. In September 2016 Gillard was appointed a visiting professor at King&#x27;s College London, joining the King&#x27;s Policy Institute to chair the Global Institute for Women&#x27;s Leadership, as well as the Menzies Centre for Australian Studies.

In 2017, Gillard was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) &quot;for eminent service to the Parliament of Australia, particularly as Prime Minister, through seminal contributions to economic and social development, particularly policy reform in the areas of education, disability care, workplace relations, health, foreign affairs and the environment, and as a role model to women.&quot; According to &quot;The West Australian&quot;, one of her nominators for the award was then–Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who wrote a letter testifying to her suitability for the honour in 2014. Gillard is the most recent former prime minister to have received such award since John Howard in 2008, and the sixth prime minister overall. In July 2017 she took up her appointment as chair of Beyond Blue.

In 2018 she was listed as one of BBC&#x27;s 100 Women.

In April 2021, Gillard was appointed chair of the board of Governors at Wellcome Trust, one of the most richly-endowed philanthropic charitable trusts, headquartered in London UK but with global reach, supporting research and innovation in medicine, public health, mental health and climate change. In April 2021, Gillard was honoured by the award of the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun from the Government of Japan, which was formally presented by the Ambassador of Japan to Australia in a ceremony held on 4 February 2022. Gillard is the 8th Australian prime minister to receive the award, after Edmund Barton, Robert Menzies, John McEwen, Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, and John Howard. On 26 October 2023, she was awarded an honorary fellowship at Girton College, Cambridge.

== Royal Commission into early education in South Australia ==
In October 2022 it was announced that Gillard would be leading the Royal Commission into early education in South Australia. In August 2023 Gillard authorised the release of the final report from the Royal Commission.

== Personal life ==

Gillard met Tim Mathieson in 2004, and they began a relationship in 2006. The relationship ended in 2020 or 2021.

Gillard&#x27;s mother told ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;Australian Story&quot; program that Gillard had spoken from a young age of never wanting children. Gillard herself told the program that while she admired women who could balance child rearing with a career, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure I could have. There&#x27;s something in me that&#x27;s focused and single-minded and if I was going to do that, I&#x27;m not sure I could have done this.&quot;

Gillard owned a single-storey home in the south-western Melbourne suburb of Altona which she occupied prior to The Lodge and sold in December 2013. She is a public supporter of the Western Bulldogs Australian rules football team and the Melbourne Storm rugby league team. She currently resides in Adelaide, in the beachside suburb of Brighton.

Gillard was brought up in the Baptist tradition, but is an atheist. In a 2010 interview, when asked if she believed in God, she stated: &quot;No, I don&#x27;t ... I&#x27;m not a religious person ... I&#x27;m a great respecter of religious beliefs but they&#x27;re not my beliefs.&quot; Comparing Australia to the United States in a 2013 interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, she stated: &quot;I think it would be inconceivable for me if I were an American to have turned up at the highest echelon of American politics being an atheist, single and childless.&quot; In her 2014 autobiography, &quot;My Story&quot;, Gillard stated, &quot;Kevin had to be the leader in our alliance because I understood that I was not what Labor needed at that point: a woman, not married, an atheist.&quot;

Gillard has admitted to having smoked cannabis before, but said she &quot;didn&#x27;t like it&quot;.

=== AWU affair ===

Gillard worked in the industrial department of the law firm Slater &amp; Gordon from 1988 through to 1995. In the early 1990s, she was in a relationship with Bruce Wilson, an official of the Australian Workers&#x27; Union (AWU). Gillard provided pro-bono legal assistance to help establish the AWU Workplace Reform Association for Wilson and his associate Ralph Blewitt. She was also involved in providing legal services in relation to the purchase of a Fitzroy property by Wilson and Blewitt. Wilson and Blewitt have been accused of creating the association to use a slush fund for personal benefit, including diverting funds for the purchase of the house in Fitzroy.

Slater &amp; Gordon investigated Gillard&#x27;s conduct and concluded that she had no case to answer. Gillard has denied any wrongdoing. A subsequent Royal Commission into union corruption found that Gillard had not committed or known of any criminal activity, but had displayed a lapse in professional judgement.

<text>The Fairey Battle is a British single-engine light bomber that was designed and manufactured by the Fairey Aviation Company. It was developed during the mid-1930s for the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a monoplane successor to the Hawker Hart and Hind biplanes. The Battle was powered by the same high-performance Rolls-Royce Merlin piston engine that powered various contemporary British fighters such as the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire. As the Battle, with its three-man crew and bomb load, was much heavier than the fighters, it was therefore much slower. Though a great improvement over the aircraft that preceded it, its relatively slow speed, limited range and inadequate defensive armament of only two .303 (7.7 mm) machine guns left it highly vulnerable to enemy fighters and anti-aircraft fire.

The Fairey Battle was used on operations early in the Second World War. During the &quot;Phoney War&quot; the type achieved the distinction of scoring the first aerial victory of an RAF aircraft in the conflict. In May 1940, the Battles of the Advanced Air Striking Force suffered many losses, frequently in excess of 50 per cent of aircraft sorties per mission. By the end of 1940 the type had been withdrawn from front-line service and relegated to training units overseas. As an aircraft that had been considered to hold great promise in the pre-war era, the Battle proved to be one of the most disappointing aircraft in RAF service.

==Development==

===Origins===
In April 1933, the British Air Ministry issued Specification P.27/32 which sought a two-seat single-engine monoplane day bomber to replace the Hawker Hart and Hind biplane bombers then in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF). A requirement of the prospective aircraft was to be capable of carrying of bombs over a distance of while flying at a speed of . According to aviation author Tony Buttler, during the early 1920s, Britain had principally envisioned that a war with France as its enemy and the range to reach Paris was sought. According to aerospace publication Air International, a key motivational factor in the Air Ministry&#x27;s development of Specification P.27/32 had been for the corresponding aircraft to act as an insurance policy in the event that heavier bombers were banned by the 1932 Geneva Disarmament Conference.

The Fairey Aviation Company were keen to produce a design to meet the demands of Specification P.27/32 and commenced work upon such a design. The Belgian aeronautical engineer Marcel Lobelle served as the aircraft&#x27;s principal designer. One of the early decisions made by Lobelle on the project was the use of the newly developed Rolls-Royce Merlin I engine, which had been selected due to its favourable power and compact frontal area. The Merlin engine was quickly paired to a de Havilland Propellers-built three-bladed variable-pitch propeller unit. The choice of engine enabled the designing of the aircraft to possess exceptionally clean lines and a subsequently generous speed performance. The resulting design was an all-metal single-engine aircraft, which adopted a low-mounted cantilever monoplane wing and was equipped with a retractable tail wheel undercarriage.

A total of four companies decided to formally respond to Specification P.27/32, these being the Fairey, Hawker Aircraft, Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft, and Bristol Aeroplane Company. Of the submissions made, the Air Ministry selected Armstrong Whitworth and Fairey to produce prototypes to demonstrate their designs. On 10 March 1936, the first Fairey prototype, &quot;K4303&quot;, equipped with a Merlin I engine capable of generating , performed its maiden flight at Hayes, Middlesex. The prototype was promptly transferred to RAF Martlesham Heath, Woodbridge, Suffolk for service trials, during which it attained a maximum speed of 257 MPH and reportedly achieved a performance in advance of any contemporary day bomber.

Even prior to the first flight of the prototype, some members of the Air Staff had concluded that both the specified range and bomb load, to which the aircraft had been designed, were insufficient to enable its viable use in a prospective conflict with a re-emergent Germany. Despite these performance concerns, there was also considerable pressure for the Battle to be rapidly placed into mass production in order that it could contribute to a wider increase of the RAF&#x27;s frontline combat aircraft strength in line with similar strides being made during the 1930s by the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. As such, the initial production order placed for the type, for the manufacture of 155 aircraft built as per the requirements of Specification P.23/35, which had received the name &quot;Battle&quot;, had been issued in advance of the first flight of the prototype.

===Production===

In 1936, further orders were placed for Fairey to build additional Battles to Specification P.14/36. In June 1937, the first production Battle, &quot;K7558&quot;, conducted its maiden flight. &quot;K7558&quot; was later used to perform a series of official handling and performance trials in advance to the wider introduction of the type to operational service. During these trials, it demonstrated the Battle&#x27;s ability to conduct missions of a 1,000-mile range while under a full bomb load. The first 136 Fairey-built Battles were the first aircraft to be powered by the Merlin I engine. By the end of 1937, 85 Battles had been completed and a number of RAF squadrons had been re-equipped with the type, or were otherwise in the process of re-equipping.
As the RAF embarked on what became a substantial pre-war expansion programme, the Battle was promptly recognised as being a priority production target. At one point a total of 2,419 aircraft were on order for the service. In June 1937, the first aircraft was completed at Hayes, but all subsequent aircraft were manufactured at Fairey&#x27;s newly completed factory at Heaton Chapel, Stockport, Cheshire. Completed aircraft were promptly dispatched for testing at the company&#x27;s facility adjacent to RAF Ringway, about 6 miles away. A total of 1,156 aircraft were produced by Fairey. Subsequently, as part of government-led wartime production planning, a shadow factory operated by the Austin Motor Company at Cofton Hackett, Longbridge, also produced the type, manufacturing a total of 1,029 aircraft to Specification P.32/36. On 22 July 1938, the first Austin-built Battle, &quot;L4935&quot;, conducted its maiden flight. At that point, concerns that the aircraft was obsolete had become widespread, but due to the difficulties associated with getting other aircraft types into production, and the labour force having already been established, stop-gap orders were maintained, and production continued at a steady rate through to late 1940.

A further 16 were built by Fairey for service with the Belgian Air Force. The Belgian Battles were delivered in early 1938, and were differentiated from British-built examples by having a longer radiator cowling and a smoother camouflage finish. In September 1940, all production activity came to a close and the final assembly lines were shuttered. Overall production of the Battle during its entire manufacturing life was 2,201 machines, including 16 for Belgium.

A number of Battles which had been originally completed as bombers were later converted to serve in different roles, such as target tugs and trainer aircraft.

==Design==

The Fairey Battle was a single-engine monoplane light bomber, powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. Production aircraft were progressively powered by various models of the Merlin engine, such as the Merlin I, II, III (most numerous) and V but all bomber variants were called the Battle Mk I. The Battle had a relatively clean design, having adopted a slim oval-shaped fuselage which was manufactured in two sections. The forward section, in front of the cockpit, included a steel tubular structure to support the engine; the rear section was of a metal monocoque structure comprised hoop frames and Z-section stringers which was built on jigs. The structure of the aircraft involved several innovations and firsts for Fairey: it had the distinction of being the company&#x27;s first low-wing monoplane; it also was the first light-alloy stressed-skin construction aircraft to be produced by the firm.

The wing of the Battle used a two-part construction, the centre section being integral with the fuselage. The internal structure of the wings relied upon steel spars which varied in dimension towards the wing tips; the ailerons, elevators and rudder all were metal-framed with fabric coverings, while the split trailing edge flaps were entirely composed of metal.

The Battle had a crew of three, pilot, observer/bomb aimer and radio operator/air gunner, under one long continuous canopy which extended between the two cockpits set at the leading and trailing edges of the wing. The aircraft had a fixed .303 Browning machine gun mounted in the starboard wing for the pilot and a free .303 Vickers K machine gun in the rear cockpit for the gunner. The observer-navigator was behind and below the pilot in a cabin within the fuselage. The bomb aiming position was in the bottom of the aircraft with sighting done in a prone position through an open aiming panel behind the radiator outlet. If the pilot&#x27;s canopy was open a rush of hot air and oil mist from the radiator through the open panel would prevent the bomb aimer from using the Mk. VII Course Setting Bomb Sight.

The armament and crew of the aircraft were similar to the Bristol Blenheim bomber: three crew, 1,000 lbs standard bomb load and two machine guns, although the Battle was a single-engine bomber with less horsepower. The Battle had a standard payload of four GP bombs which was carried in cells contained within the internal space of the wings. Maximum bomb load was , with two additional bombs on under-wing racks or with two bombs carried externally under bomb bays and two bombs on under-wing racks. The bombs were mounted on hydraulic jacks and were normally released via trap doors; during a dive bombing attack, they were lowered below the surface of the wing.

The Battle was a robust aircraft which was frequently described as being easy to fly, even for relatively inexperienced pilots. The pilot was provided with good external visibility and the cockpit was considered to be roomy and comfortable for the era but the tasks of simultaneously deploying the flaps and the retractable undercarriage, which included a safety catch, has been highlighted as posing considerable complication. Climate control within the cockpit was also reportedly poor.

By the time that the Battle was entering service in 1937 it had already been rendered obsolete by the rapid advances in aircraft technology. The performance and capabilities of fighter aircraft had increased to outstrip the modest performance gains that the light bomber had achieved over its biplane antecedents. For defence, the Battle had been armed only with a single Browning machine gun and a trainable Vickers K in the rear position; in service, these proved to be woefully inadequate. The Battle lacked an armoured cockpit and self-sealing fuel tanks. The Battle was considered well-armoured by the standards of 1940, although there was an emphasis on protection against small-arms fire from the ground. No RAF bombers were fitted with self-sealing tanks at the beginning of the war, although they were hastily fitted once the necessity became apparent. Since it was some time before self-sealing tanks could be mass-produced, it was a common stop-gap in 1940, even into 1941, to simply armour the rear of the fuel tanks with single or double layers of 4 mm armour. The Battle, along with the rest of the early-war inventory, was taken out of front-line duties before it had a chance to be fitted with self-sealing tanks.

==Operational history==
===Introduction===

In June 1937, No. 63 Squadron, based at RAF Upwood, Cambridgeshire, became the first RAF squadron to be equipped with the Fairey Battle. On 20 May 1937, the delivery of the first Battle to No. 63 occurred; following further deliveries, the squadron was initially assigned to perform development trials. The type holds the distinction of being the first operational aircraft powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine to enter service, having beaten the debut of the Hawker Hurricane fighter by a matter of months.

By May 1939, there were a total of 17 RAF squadrons that had been equipped with the Battle. While many of these were frontline combat squadrons, some, under the No. 2 Group, were assigned to a non-mobilising training role; on the eve of the outbreak of war, these squadrons were reassigned to operate under No. 6 Training Group or alternatively served as reserve squadrons.

===Wartime bomber service===

The Battle was obsolete by the start of the Second World War, but remained a front-line RAF bomber owing to a lack of a suitable replacement. On 2 September 1939, during the &quot;Phoney War&quot;, 10 Battle squadrons were deployed to pre-selected airfields in France to form a portion of the vanguard of the British RAF Advanced Air Striking Force, which was independent of the similarly-tasked Army-led British Expeditionary Force. Once the Battles arrived, the aircraft were dispersed and efforts were made to camouflage or otherwise obscure their presence; the envisioned purpose of their deployment had been that, in the event of German commencement of bombing attacks, the Battles based in France could launch retaliatory raids upon Germany, specifically in the Ruhr valley region, and would benefit from their closer range than otherwise possible from the British mainland.

Initial wartime missions were to perform aerial reconnaissance of the Siegfried Line during daylight, resulting in occasional skirmishes and losses. On 20 September 1939, a German Messerschmitt Bf 109 was shot down by Battle gunner Sgt F. Letchford during a patrol near Aachen; this occasion is recognised as being the RAF&#x27;s first aerial victory of the war. Nonetheless, the Battle was hopelessly outclassed by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighters, being almost slower than the contemporary Bf 109 at . That same day, three Battles were engaged by German fighters, resulting in two Battles being lost. During the winter of 1939–1940, the Advanced Air Striking Force underwent restructuring; some of the Battle-equipped squadrons were returned to the UK while their place was taken by Bristol Blenheim-equipped squadrons instead. The activities of the Advanced Air Striking Force were principally restricted to training exercises during this time.

Upon the commencement of the Battle of France in May 1940, Battles were called upon to perform unescorted, low-level tactical attacks against the advancing German army; this use of the type placed the aircraft at risk of attack from &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighters and within easy range of light anti-aircraft guns. In the first of two sorties carried out by Battles on 10 May 1940, three out of eight aircraft were lost, while a further 10 out of 24 were shot down in the second sortie, giving a total of 13 lost in that day&#x27;s attacks, with the remainder suffering damage. Despite bombing from as low as , their attacks were recorded as having had little impact on the German columns. During the following day, nine Belgian Air Force Battles attacked bridges over the Albert Canal that connects to the Meuse River, losing six aircraft and in another RAF sortie that day against a German column, only one Battle out of eight survived.

On 12 May, a formation of five Battles of 12 Squadron attacked two road bridges over the Albert Canal; four of these aircraft were destroyed while the final aircraft crash-landing upon its return to its base. Two Victoria Crosses were awarded posthumously for the action, to Flying Officer Donald Garland and air observer/navigator sergeant Thomas Gray of Battle serial &quot;P2204&quot; coded PH-K, for pressing home the attack in spite of the heavy defensive fire. The third crew member, rear gunner Leading Aircraftsman Lawrence Reynolds, did not share the award. Both fighters and flak had proved lethal for the Battles. Although Garland&#x27;s Battle managed to destroy one span of the bridge, the German army quickly erected a pontoon bridge to replace it.

On 14 May 1940, in a desperate attempt to stop German forces crossing the Meuse, the Advanced Air Striking Force launched an &quot;all-out&quot; attack by all available bombers against the German bridgehead and pontoon bridges at Sedan. The light bombers were attacked by swarms of opposing fighters and were devastated. Out of a strike force of 63 Battles and eight Bristol Blenheims, 40 (including 35 Battles) were lost. After these abortive raids, the Battle was switched to mainly night attacks, resulting in much lower losses.

A similar situation befell the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the early days of the Battle of Britain, when the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bomber suffered equivalent losses in a similar role. With the exception of a few successful twin-engine designs such as the de Havilland Mosquito, Bristol Beaufighter and Douglas A-20, low-level attack missions passed into the hands of single-engine, fighter-bomber aircraft, such as the Hawker Hurricane, Hawker Typhoon and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt.

On 15 June 1940, the last remaining aircraft of the Advanced Air Striking Force returned to Britain. In six weeks almost 200 Battles had been lost, with 99 lost between 10 and 16 May. After the return from France, for a short period of time, the RAF continued to rely on the light bomber. Reforming No. 1 Group and later equipping four new Polish squadrons with the type, it continued to be deployed in operations against shipping massed in the Channel ports for Operation Sealion. Their last combat sortie was mounted on the night of 15/16 October 1940 by No. 301 (Polish) Squadron in a raid on Boulogne, and Nos 12 and 142 Squadrons bombing Calais. Shortly afterwards Battle squadrons of No. 1 Group were re-equipped with Vickers Wellington medium bombers. Battles were operated into 1941 by 88 and 226 Squadrons in Northern Ireland and 98 Squadron in Iceland, for coastal patrol work.

===East Africa===
The South African Air Force were also supplied with some Battles. In August 1940, No. 11 Squadron took possession of at least four, which were flown north to be operated in the Italian East Africa (Ethiopia, Italian Somaliland and Eritrea) campaign. They conducted bombing and reconnaissance operations. Whereas in France the RAF&#x27;s Battles had encountered modern German fighters in large numbers, the South Africans faced a smaller number of Italian biplane fighters (Fiat CR.32 and CR.42), which enabled the aircrews to contribute more effectively to the campaign; but not without several losses, especially when surprised above some predictable targets (air bases, ports etc.). Italian biplanes dived as fast as possible over the bombers, trying to shoot them down in the first pass.

===Greece===
The last combat operations carried out by Fairey Battles were during the Italian and German invasion of Greece, from the end of 1940 until April 1941. A few Fairey Battles of the RAF and about a dozen belonging to the RHAF – serial numbers starting from B274 – participated in secondary bombing roles against enemy infantry. Most of them were destroyed on the ground by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air attacks on the airfields of Tanagra and Tatoi north of Athens between end of March and mid April 1941. No significant contribution of this type was reported during this period, although some hits were recorded by the Greek Air Force.

Prior to the Second World War, in spring 1939, the Polish government had placed an order for 100 Battle bombers, but none of these were delivered before the outbreak of war. The first 22 aircraft were sent in early September 1939 on two ships to Constanta in Romania, to be received there by the Polish crews, but the ships were ordered back while in Istanbul when the fall of Poland became inevitable. They were next offered to Turkey.

Some sources state that the Fairey Battle was licence-produced in Denmark for the Danish Air Force before the German invasion in 1940, but no such plane is known to have been completed.

===Trainer role===

While found to be inadequate as a bomber aircraft in the Second World War, the Fairey Battle found a new niche in its later service life. As the Fairey Battle T, for which it was furnished with a dual-cockpit arrangement in place of the standard long canopy, the type served as a trainer aircraft. The Battle T was equipped with dual-controls in the cockpit and optionally featured a Bristol-built Type I gun turret when employed as a bombing/gunnery training. As the winch-equipped Fairey Battle TT (target tug), it was used as a target-towing aircraft to support airborne gunnery training exercises. Furthermore, Battles were not only used in this role by the RAF, several overseas operators opted to acquire the type as a training platform.

In August 1939, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) received its first batch of eight Battles at RCAF Station Borden, Ontario, Canada. A total of 802 Battles were eventually delivered from England, serving in various roles and configurations, including dual-control trainers, target-tugs, and gunnery trainers for both the Bombing and Gunnery schools of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Canadian use of the Battle declined as more advanced aircraft, such as the Bristol Bolingbroke and North American Harvard, were introduced; the type remained in RCAF service until shortly after the end of hostilities in 1945.

The Battle served as a trainer with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), which allocated it the prefix &quot;A22&quot;. On 30 April 1940, the first four RAAF Battles were delivered to No. 1 Aircraft Depot; on 29 June 1940, the first assembled aircraft, &quot;P5239&quot;, conducted its first flight. Deliveries occurred at a steady pace until the last Battle was received on 7 December 1943. These aircraft were a mix of bomber, target tug, and dual-control trainer variants; they were mainly used by Bombing and Gunnery schools until 1945; the last aircraft were phased out in 1949.

Following an initial evaluation using a handful of aircraft, the SAAF purchased a number of Battles. Operated in the Western Desert and East Africa, SAAF Battles were used into early 1942. Battles were also sold to the Turkish Air Force, which was reportedly pleased by the type&#x27;s manoeuvrability. The type remained in RAF service, in secondary roles, until 1949.

===Engine testbed===
While the Battle was no longer viable as a frontline combat aircraft, its benign handling characteristics meant that it was an ideal platform for testing engines, and it was used in this role to evaluate engines up to including the Rolls-Royce Exe, Fairey Prince (H-16) and Napier Dagger. These trials were often conducted to support the development of other aircraft, such as the Fairey Spearfish, as well as the suitability of the individual engines.

As part of a study of potential alternative engines in the event of supply interruptions of the Merlin engine, which normally powered the type, were encountered, a single Canadian Battle, &quot;R7439&quot;, was re-engined by Fairchild Aircraft with a Wright R-1820 Cyclone radial engine. R7439 was the sole aircraft to be equipped with this powerplant.

In 1939, one Battle, &quot;K9370&quot;, underwent extensive modifications in order to test the Fairey Monarch or higher engine; in addition to the engine itself, K9370 was furnished with electrically-controlled three-bladed contra-rotating propellers and a large ventral radiator. According to &quot;Jane&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Aircraft 1946–47&quot;, the aircraft was shipped to the US after 86 hours test time in December 1941. Testing continued for a time at Wright Field, Ohio.

Two aircraft, &quot;K9270&quot; and &quot;L5286&quot;, acted as flying testbeds for the Napier Sabre engine. Modifications included the adoption of a fixed undercarriage, large ventral radiator, and an auxiliary intake. The two Sabre-equipped Battles accumulated roughly 700 flight hours.

==Variants==
;Fairey Day Bomber: Prototype (K4303).
;Battle Mk I: Three-seat light bomber version. Powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin I, a Merlin II, Merlin III or Merlin V inline piston engines (sometimes known unofficially as Battle I, II, III, V respectively).
;Battle T: After May 1940, a number of Battle Mk Is, IIs and Vs were converted into training aircraft.
;Battle IT: After May 1940, a number of Battle Mk Is, IIs and Vs were converted into training aircraft with a turret installed in the rear.
;Battle IIT: In October 1940, a sole RCAF Battle Mk I was converted into a prototype for a future series, powered by an Wright Cyclone R-1820-G38. The Battle IIT was conceived as a stopgap conversion in the likelihood that Merlins were unavailable.
;Battle TT: After May 1940, a number of Battle Mk Is, IIs and Vs were converted into target tug aircraft; 100 built.
;Battle TT.Mk I: Target tug version. This was the last production version; 226 built.

Tipple of 264 Squadron RAF was tasked with ferrying Fairey Battle Mk.I (N2159) from RAF Little Rissington to RAF Martlesham Heath in company with a more experienced officer in another Battle. Tipple had never flown the type previously and received only brief instruction before takeoff. Once in the air the aircraft was observed to be trailing smoke. By the time the pair had reached Hintlesham, Suffolk the aircraft was losing altitude and Tipple attempted to bail out. The aircraft crashed at Little Wenham, Babergh, Suffolk and the pilot was killed. Tipple is buried in Hintlesham churchyard and is commemorated on the adjacent war memorial.

On 2 August 1940, Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth, a racing motorist, aviator and prolific collector of veteran cars and aircraft was killed when Fairey Battle &quot;L4971&quot; of No. 12 Operational Training Unit RAF Benson crashed into a hill during a solo night flying exercise.

On 23 September 1940, Fairey Battle K9480 on a training flight, crashed onto a house, killing the Polish pilot and five civilians from one family in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.

==Surviving aircraft==

* L5343/L5340 – Battle I on static display at the Royal Air Force Museum Hendon in London. In July 1940, it was with No. 98 Squadron RAF, based at Kaldadarnes, Iceland for anti-invasion operations supporting British forces. L5343 was the first RAF aircraft to land on Icelandic soil, and crashed during subsequent operations. In 1972, the RAF recovered the wreck for restoration, which was completed at the Michael Beetham Conservation Centre of the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford using parts from L5340.
* N2188 – Battle I under restoration at the South Australian Aviation Museum in Port Adelaide, South Australia. The aircraft was recovered from a tidal swamp near Port Pirie in South Australia.
* R3950 – Battle TT.I on static display at the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and of Military History in Brussels, Belgium. This aircraft spent much of its career in Canada. It was acquired by the Brussels museum in 1990 as representative of aircraft that served with the Belgian Air Force in 1940.
* R7384 – Battle IT on static display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa, Ontario. It was built as a pilot trainer in 1940, and taken on strength by the RCAF in 1941. Converted to a gunnery trainer with a turret in 1942, it was used until stored in 1943. The aircraft was transferred to the Canada Aviation Museum in 1964, and was restored in the 1990s.
* Full scale model under construction at the Commonwealth Air Training Plan Museum in Brandon, Manitoba.

<text>Mossley (/ˈmɒzli/) is a town and civil parish in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England, in the upper Tame Valley and the foothills of the Pennines, south-east of Oldham and east of Manchester.

The town grew up straddling the three historic counties of Lancashire, Cheshire and Yorkshire. It was placed entirely in Lancashire in 1889, and became part of Greater Manchester in 1974. At the 2021 census, the built-up area had a population of 11,410 and the parish population was 11,557.

==Toponymy==
Mossley means &quot;a woodland clearing by a swamp or bog&quot;. The earliest record of the name here dates from around 1319.

==History==

Mossley—alongside neighbouring Stalybridge and Uppermill in Saddleworth—helped launch the annual Whit Friday Band Contest, an internationally known brass band event, which began in 1884 in Uppermill.

===Public venue===

George Lawton, the son of magistrate and alderman John Lawton, inherited a family fortune and when he died in August 1949, he left the bulk of his wealth to the people of Mossley. Part of his £77,760 wealth () was left to build a public meeting place, the George Lawton Hall, which opened in 1960.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Mossley, at civil parish (town) and metropolitan borough level: Mossley Town Council and Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council. Tameside Council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Greater Manchester. There is a Mossley ward for elections to Tameside council, which covers a slightly larger area than the parish.

Mossley Town Council generally meets at the Methodist Church on Chapel Street.

===Administrative history===
The original hamlet of Mossley was in the parish of Ashton-under-Lyne in Lancashire, but lay very close to the boundaries with Cheshire and Yorkshire. As the town grew during the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, the urban area came to straddle the three counties. To the east, it extended into the townships of Stayley and Tintwistle, both of which formed part of the parish of Mottram-in-Longdendale in Cheshire. To the north, it extended into the township of Saddleworth, which was the part of Rochdale parish which lay in the West Riding of Yorkshire (the rest of Rochdale parish was in Lancashire).

In 1864, a Mossley local government district was established, with a newly-defined boundary that straddled the three counties and four townships. The district was administered by an elected local board.
Mossley was granted a municipal charter on 13 March 1885, which converted the local government district into a municipal borough, with a borough council replacing the board. The borough council bought Mossley Hall in 1891 to serve as its headquarters, renaming it the Town Hall.

Elected county councils were established in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888. The 1888 Act also directed that urban sanitary districts which straddled county boundaries, as the borough of Mossley did, were to be placed entirely in the county which had the majority of the district&#x27;s population. Mossley was therefore placed entirely in Lancashire. The borough continued to straddle four townships until 1894, when a single township or civil parish of Mossley was created covering the same area as the borough.

The borough of Mossley was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside in Greater Manchester.

No successor parish was created for Mossley at the time of the 1974 reforms, and so it became unparished. A new civil parish of Mossley was established in 1999, with its council taking the name Mossley Town Council. The parish is divided into three wards for town council elections, called Cheshire, Lancashire, and Yorkshire, reflecting the historic county boundaries.

The town&#x27;s unofficial coat of arms includes Cheshire&#x27;s sheaf of corn, Lancashire&#x27;s red rose and Yorkshire&#x27;s white rose to signify the historic demarcation.

===Parliament===
From 1918 to 1950 the town gave its name to the Mossley constituency which returned a Member of Parliament; for most of the period, the MP was Austin Hopkinson, who was notable for being elected as an Independent candidate. The town is now represented by the MP for Stalybridge and Hyde.

==Geography==

Mossley lies amongst the foothills of the Pennines, on the western edge of Saddleworth Moor.

*St. Joseph&#x27;s Church, in the centre of Mossley, is Roman Catholic
*All Saints&#x27; Church is in Micklehurst, aligned to Cheshire
*St John the Baptist Church is of Yorkshire
*St George&#x27;s Church is of Lancashire

A tram network operated by the SHMD Joint Board ran lines through Mossley from 1904 to 1945, until their replacement by buses. The second-generation tramway Manchester Metrolink currently terminates at nearby Ashton-under-Lyne for connections to the city centre.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter and one of the two local relay transmitters (Saddleworth and Brock Bottom ). 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Manchester, Capital Manchester and Lancashire, Heart North West, Smooth North West, Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West, and Tameside Radio, a community based station.

The local newspaper is the &quot;Tameside Reporter&quot;, published on Thursdays.

==Sport==
Local sport teams include Mossley A.F.C., Mossley Mayhem Softball Club, Mossley Athletic JFC, Mossley Juniors F.C., Mossley AFC Running Club and Micklehurst Cricket Club.

==Fairtrade==
Mossley&#x27;s Town Council passed a resolution in November 2009 to make Mossley a Fairtrade Town. A group of local campaigners and activist have started the Fairtrade Mossley group to make 2010 the year that Mossley becomes a Fairtrade Town.

<text>Donald Margulies (born September 2, 1954) is an American playwright and academic. In 2000, he won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his play &quot;Dinner with Friends&quot;.

==Background and education==
Margulies attended John Dewey High School in Brooklyn, New York, and graduated from Purchase College where he received a BFA in Visual Arts. Margulies lives with his wife, Lynn Street, a physician, and their son, Miles, in New Haven, Connecticut.

He is a Professor in the Practice of English and Theatre &amp; Performance Studies at Yale University.

==Theater==
Margulies&#x27; notable works include &quot;The Country House&quot; (2014), &quot;Time Stands Still&quot; (2009) and &quot;Brooklyn Boy&quot; (2004). &quot;Sight Unseen&quot; and &quot;Collected Stories&quot; were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, in 1992, and 1997, respectively; &quot;Dinner with Friends&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 2000.

Margulies said of &quot;Sight Unseen&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s about loss, like most of my plays, and about identity.&quot; Ben Brantley noted themes in his works: &quot;The central motifs in &quot;Brooklyn Boy&quot; have always been visible in Mr. Margulies&#x27;s work, from the willed amnesia of the self-invented artist (&quot;Sight Unseen&quot;) to the hazy lines between fiction and reality (&quot;Collected Stories&quot;). And Eric&#x27;s fractious, divided family, summoned in recollection in &quot;Brooklyn Boy,&quot; has been anticipated in &quot;The Loman Family Picnic&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With This Picture?&quot;

=== &quot;Long Lost&quot; ===
The play was developed in connection with the Nashville Repertory Theatre Ingram New Works Festival. The unfinished play was given a reading in May 2015 at the Festival.

<text>Paul Heinrich Gerhard Möhring (also Paul Mohr; 21 July 1710 in Jever – 28 October 1792) was a German physician, botanist and zoologist.

He studied medicine in Danzig and Wittenberg, and following graduation (1733), he settled as a general practitioner in his hometown of Jever. Möhring was a physician to the Prince of Anhalt. In 1752 he published &quot;Avium Genera&quot;, an early attempt to classify bird species, which divided birds into four classes and shows the beginnings of the modern groupings.

During his long career, he maintained correspondence with Albrecht von Haller, Lorenz Heister, Carl Linnaeus, Hans Sloane and Paul Gottlieb Werlhof. The plant genus &quot;Moehringia&quot; (family Caryophyllaceae) was named in his honor by Carl Linnaeus.

<text>This is a list of file formats used by archivers and compressors used to create archive files.

== Archive formats by purpose ==
Archive formats are used for backups, mobility, and archiving. Many archive formats compress the data to consume less storage space and result in quicker transfer times as the same data is represented by fewer bytes. Another benefit is that files are combined into one archive file which has less overhead for managing or transferring. There are numerous compression algorithms available to losslessly compress archived data; some algorithms are designed to work better (smaller archive or faster compression) with particular data types. Archive formats are used by most operating systems to package software for easier distribution and installation than binary executables.

<text>Denmark Hill is an interchange station between the Windrush line of the London Overground and National Rail services on the Catford loop line, located in Denmark Hill in South London. It is down the line from . The station is located in Travelcard Zone 2 and is managed by Thameslink. The station receives services operated by Southeastern and Thameslink in addition to the London Overground.

==History==

The station was built between 1864 and 1866. Its design by Charles Henry Driver is in the Italianate style, with an extremely decorative frontage and French pavilion roofs.

In 1920 the waiting room was used by &quot;The Mystical Church of the Comforter&quot;, founded by Elizabeth Mary Eagle Skinner, who was known as &quot;The Messenger&quot;. The waiting room was transformed by an altar, painted white and surrounded by the seven colours of the rainbow. The &quot;Nottingham Evening Post&quot; for 17 June 1926 reported that babies were baptised, funeral services were read and even a marriage was solemnised. The porters and clerks of the railway company often worked to the accompaniment of hymns sung by the congregation. The church is believed to have ceased to function after the death of Skinner in November 1929.

By the late 1970s, the structure had fallen into disrepair. Arsonists burst into the booking hall in March 1980, and the ensuing fire damaged the roof. Initial work by British Rail engineers to make the building safe by demolishing parts of the remaining building triggered a protest campaign by the Camberwell Society. Following a joint initiative between them, the Southwark Environment Trust and the British Rail Director of the Environment, Bernard Kaukas, the building was restored in 1985.

The project included the addition of a public house, initially called the Phoenix and Firkin to commemorate the fire, then called O&#x27;Neills and now the Phoenix. The building was given a Civic Trust award in 2009.

In the period 2011–2013 the station underwent a redesign with the construction of a new ticket office with access from Champion Park, new walkways and lifts to the platforms.

In September 2021, a second entrance opened on the north-eastern side of the station.

==Design==

The platforms are below road level, with the short Grove Tunnel at one end and Denmark Hill road bridge at the other.

<text>Wandsworth Road is a station on the Windrush line of the London Overground, located between Battersea and Clapham in South London. It is from .

==History==
===Chatham lines===
The station opened on 1 March 1863, on the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) original double-track low-level route from Victoria via Stewarts Lane, which was opened between Victoria and Herne Hill, on 25 August 1862. The LCDR constructed a triple-track high-level route between Battersea Pier Junction and Brixton, part of which opened between Factory Junction, (100 metres north of Wandsworth Road station) and Brixton on 1 May 1866, together with three additional platforms at Wandsworth Road. Therefore, from May 1866 until April 1916, this station had five platforms. In 1879 the LCDR was running the following services that stopped at Wandsworth Road:

* Frequent trains between Moorgate and Victoria, calling at all stations
* Half-hourly trains between Moorgate and Clapham Junction, calling at all stations
* Through trains from Kentish Town to Victoria, calling at all stations 

The LCDR was operated as part of the joint South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) from 1899.

SECR withdrew it services on 3 April 1916 and the three 1866 platforms were closed. 

The former South Eastern &amp; Chatham platforms which closed in 1916 were demolished in the late 1920s.

===Atlantic lines===
On 1 May 1867, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway leased the original two tracks to the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) for use by its new South London line service, which ran between Victoria and London Bridge via Denmark Hill. After the SECR withdrew its service on 3 April 1916 only the original two 1863 platforms remained in operation and were served by the LBSCR. The South London line service was withdrawn for four months during the 1926 general strike with the station closed from 19 May 1926 to 20 September 1926. 

A footbridge was installed by Network SouthEast in November 1988 having previously been used at Mitcham.

The and service continued until 8 December 2012, ultimately with a train twice-hourly and operated by Southern. This was mostly replaced by the London Overground service between Clapham Junction and Dalston Junction.

===Parliamentary trains===

Following the withdrawal of CrossCountry&#x27;s services from to via in December 2008 the Department for Transport required a weekly parliamentary train to run on lines no longer used by other services, hence Southern operated a morning weekday service from Kensington Olympia to Clapham High Street with a corresponding service in the afternoon. This was withdrawn in December 2012. Since then the service was instead been cut back to Wandsworth Road from Kensington Olympia, and then withdrawn completely in June 2013, following the ratification of the service withdrawal request by the Department for Transport and Office of Rail and Road.

==Services==
London Overground operate four services per hour in each direction on the Windrush line between and . There is also a limited early morning and late evening service from and to .

==Connections==
London Buses routes 77, 87 and 452 and night route N87 serve the station.

<text>The (American) five-lined skink (Plestiodon fasciatus) is a species of lizard in the family Scincidae. The species is endemic to North America. It is one of the most common lizards in the eastern U.S. and one of the seven native species of lizards in Canada.

==Common names==
Other common names for &quot;P. fasciatus&quot; include blue-tailed skink (for juveniles) and red-headed skink (for adults). It is technically appropriate to call it the American five-lined skink to distinguish it from the African skink &quot;Trachylepis quinquetaeniata&quot; (otherwise known as five-lined mabuya) or the eastern red-headed skink to distinguish it from its western relative &quot;Plestiodon skiltonianus&quot; (otherwise known as the western skink). The blue-tailed skink proper is &quot;Cryptoblepharus egeriae&quot; from Christmas Island, but in North America the juveniles of any &quot;Eumeces&quot; or &quot;Plestiodon&quot; species may be called this.

==Description==
The American five-lined skink is small to medium-sized, growing to about total length (including tail). Young American five-lined skinks are dark brown to black with five distinctive white to yellowish stripes running along the body and a bright blue tail. The blue color fades to light blue with age, and the stripes also may slowly disappear. Females however, are more likely to retain the blue tail color as they age. The dark brown color fades, too, and older individuals are often uniformly brownish. The southeastern five-lined skink, &quot;P. inexpectatus&quot;, of the Southeastern United States is very similar to this species and there is some overlap in range. The two species can be distinguished by their scales. The broad-headed skink, &quot;P. laticeps&quot;, is similar, and may be difficult to distinguish from &quot;P. fasciatus&quot;. The former species usually lacks the two enlarged postlabial scales characteristic of &quot;P. fasciatus&quot;. Adult male broad-headed skinks, with their large size and swollen red head, are readily distinguished from &quot;P. fasciatus&quot;. Research suggests that are sexually dimorphic in terms of size. The males are often larger than the females, but this depends on the area they live. Their claws are short and curved downward; they make a right angle at the axis of each toe.

==Geographic range ==

The range of the American five-lined skink extends in the north to southern Ontario, Michigan and eastern New York. The western border is in Minnesota, Missouri and eastern Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas. &quot;P. fasciatus&quot; tends to be most abundant on the coastal plain in the southeastern United States and along the Gulf Coast. It has now been seen in increasing numbers in the northern Chesapeake Bay Region of Maryland particularly along the shores of the Elk River, and northern Virginia.It has also been seen in northern South America, such as Colombia.

==Habitat==
The American five-lined skink is a ground-dwelling animal. It prefers moist, hardwood areas with a permanent water source such as rivers or streams, as well as sites to bask in the sun. It can also be found in broken, rocky areas at the northern edge of its habitat. Within the northern edge of its habitat, it was found that they prefer areas with longer than average rock cover in areas with few trees. While little is known about any hibernation patterns, &quot;P.fasciatus&quot; is rarely seen throughout winter and the surrounding months. It is assumed by scientists that they are sheltered and dormant under rocks, logs, or leaves provided by the hardwood areas it inhabits. They are resistant to minor disturbances, but can be affected by the removal of woody debris in their northern habitats.

==Reproduction==
Fertilization in the American five-lined skink is internal, with eggs laid by the female between the middle of May and July, at least one month after mating. Males will mate with multiple females. The mating season begins in May. The female &quot;Plestiodon&quot; will lay its eggs in June, and four to six weeks after the incubation, the young hatch. Thus the birthing process consists of laying eggs and external incubation. Fertilization occur shortly after copulation, unlike many other lizard species &quot;Plestiodon fasciatus&quot; females are unable to store sperm between successive clutches. One study found that most clutches had multiple sires, but within those clutches, there was unequal sharing of paternity.

Females lay fifteen to eighteen eggs in a small cavity cleared beneath a rotting log, stump, board, loose bark, a rock, or an abandoned rodent burrow. Females prefer secluded nest sites in large, moderately decayed logs. Soil moisture is also an important factor in nest selection. Females often place nests in regions where soil moisture is higher than in adjacent areas. Vertical position of the nest also varies with moisture, with nests located deeper in a soil cavity at dry sites. Even when nesting sites are not limited, a significant amount of aggregation occurs.

The parchment-like eggs of the American five-lined skink, similar to many other reptiles, are thin and easily punctured. Freshly laid eggs range from spherical to oval in shape averaging in length. Absorption of water from the soil leads to increased egg size. Egg coloration also changes over time, from white to mottled tan, after contact with the nest burrow. The incubation period ranges from 24 to 55 days, and varies due to fluctuations in temperature. Females typically brood their eggs during this time, exhibiting defensive behavior against smaller predators. Parental care ends a day or two after hatching when hatchlings leave the nest. Young American five-lined skinks, with a potential life span of up to six years, attain sexual maturity and begin reproducing within two to three years of hatching.

==Behavior==

Adult male American five-lined skinks exhibit complex courtship and aggressive behavior. Although males tolerate juveniles and females in their territories, they actively defend these areas against other males. It has been proposed that one of the functions of their blue tails is intraspecific communication with the purpose of preventing attacks by more aggressive males because the blue tail signifies that they are juveniles or females. Vomeronasal analysis of chemical cues and recognition of sex-specific visual stimuli, including tail and body coloration, aid in the identification of sex. Evidence suggests that males may rely more on contact pheromones than volatile airborne molecules in the identification of conspecifics. Courting males grasp the necks of receptive females in their jaws after approaching them from the side. Using the tail to align cloacal openings, males initiate copulation by inserting one of the two hemipenes into the female&#x27;s cloaca. Copulation events typically last four to eight minutes.

Female American five-lined skinks demonstrate high levels of parental care which reduces egg mortality. Females exhibit several brooding positions of variant contact levels with the body placed beside, over, through, or in a coil around the eggs. Brooding position varies according to soil moisture. Maternal body contact increases at lower moisture levels potentially reducing the transpirational loss of the eggs. In communal nests, females may alternate foraging and guarding of the nests, leaving eggs protected at all times. Females may also urinate in the nests and turn eggs to maintain humidity. In addition, females transfer heat from basking through body contact. Any eggs displaced from the nest are retrieved by head or snout rolling, and rotten eggs are eaten.

American five-lined skinks also exhibit antipredation behavior. In evasion of various predators including snakes, crows, hawks, shrews, moles, opossums, skunks, raccoons, and domestic cats, skinks may disconnect their entire tail or a small segment. It is thought that the bright blue color attracts predators to the expendable tail. Skinks run to shelter to escape their death as the disconnected tail continues to twitch. Skinks may also utilize biting as a defensive strategy.

== Diet ==
The common five-lined skink&#x27;s diet consists primarily of a variety of arthropods, particularly spiders, crickets, beetles and other insects. However, they have been reported to also eat newborn mice, frogs, and other lizards. Wild skinks will make short forays into heavily used core areas to find food. Those who own a pet skink are advised to supplement the skink&#x27;s diet with fruits and vegetables. In addition to eating insects, skinks enjoy a variety of fruits and vegetables. Fruits that skinks enjoy include blueberries, mangos, raspberries, papayas, cantaloupes, strawberries, and figs. Studies have indicated that the majority of the five-lined skink&#x27;s diet is mostly invertebrates, which for some of the many prey species the effect is negligible, but because of its voracious diet, its predation may be a major ecological factor.

==Conservation status==
The Great Lakes - St. Lawrence population of &quot;P. fasciatus&quot; is listed as &quot;special concern&quot; in Ontario and Canada by COSSARO and COSEWIC. It is illegal to remove any of the three species of skinks found in Canada from their habitats. Skinks are at the extreme edge of their habitat range in Canada, which makes it an area of special interest to ecologists, as extreme conditions place unique evolutionary pressures upon species. The American five-lined skink has split into two phylogenetically-distinct populations in this edge habitat; the Carolinian population, also present in the United States, ends around Point Pelee National Park in southern Ontario. The Carolinian population is listed as &quot;endangered&quot; in Ontario and Canada by COSSARO, COSEWIC, The St. Lawrence / Great Lakes population resides in the Ottawa Valley in eastern Ontario and tends to be more tolerant to sparse or rocky conditions than its sister subspecies.

==Captive care==
American five-lined skinks can be maintained in captivity with minimal care. Some U.S. states impose general restrictions on taking reptiles including native American five-lined skinks from the wild without a permit or hunting license, for example Maryland (no more than 4 may be possessed without a permit), Indiana and Ohio.

A pair of skinks may live in a 25-30 US gallon terrarium, and may live for 5–10 years with adequate care.

<doc id="519473" wikidata="Q3456514" url="?curid=519473" title="Tandem repeat">
<text>In genetics, tandem repeats occur in DNA when a pattern of one or more nucleotides is repeated and the repetitions are directly adjacent to each other, e.g. ATTCG ATTCG ATTCG, in which the sequence ATTCG is repeated three times.

Several protein domains also form tandem repeats within their amino acid primary structure, such as armadillo repeats. However, in proteins, perfect tandem repeats are rare in naturally proteins, but they have been added to designed proteins.

Tandem repeats constitute about 8% of the human genome. They are implicated in more than 50 lethal human diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington&#x27;s disease, and several cancers.

==Terminology==
All tandem repeat arrays are classifiable as satellite DNA, a name originating from the fact that tandem DNA repeats, by nature of repeating the same nucleotide sequences repeatedly, have a unique ratio of the two possible nucleotide base pair combinations, conferring them a specific mass density that allows them to be separated from the rest of the genome with density-based laboratory techniques, thus appearing as &quot;satellite bands&quot;. Albeit, a tandem repeat array could not show up as a satellite band if it had a nucleotide composition close to the average of the genome.

When exactly two nucleotides are repeated, it is called a &quot;dinucleotide repeat&quot; (for example: ACACACAC...). The microsatellite instability in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer most commonly affects such regions.

When three nucleotides are repeated, it is called a &quot;trinucleotide repeat&quot; (for example: CAGCAGCAGCAG...), and abnormalities in such regions can give rise to trinucleotide repeat disorders.

When between 10 and 60 nucleotides are repeated, it is called a minisatellite. Those with fewer are known as microsatellites or short tandem repeats.

When much larger lengths of nucleotides are repeated, on the order of 1,000 nucleotides, it is called a macrosatellite.

When the repeat unit copy number is variable in the population being considered, it is called a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR). MeSH classifies variable number tandem repeats under minisatellites.

==Mechanism==

Tandem repeats can occur through different mechanisms. For example, slipped strand mispairing, (also known as replication slippage), is a mutation process which occurs during DNA replication. It involves denaturation and displacement of the DNA strands, resulting in mispairing of the complementary bases. Slipped strand mispairing is one explanation for the origin and evolution of repetitive DNA sequences.

Other mechanisms include unequal crossover and gene conversion.

==Uses==
Tandem repeat describes a pattern that helps determine an individual&#x27;s inherited traits.

Tandem repeats can be very useful in determining parentage. Short tandem repeats are used for certain genealogical DNA tests. DNA is examined from &quot;microsatellites&quot; within the chromosomal DNA. Parentage can be determined through the similarity in these regions.

Polymorphic tandem repeats (alias VNTRs) are also present in microorganisms and can be used to trace the origin of an outbreak. The corresponding assay in which a collection of VNTRs is typed to characterize a strain is most often called MLVA (Multiple Loci VNTR Analysis). Using tandem repeat polymorphism, recombination has been reported in the natural transmission of monkeypox (mpox) virus genome during 2022 pandemic.

In the field of computer science, tandem repeats in strings (e.g., DNA sequences) can be efficiently detected using suffix trees or suffix arrays.

Studies in 2004 linked the unusual genetic plasticity of dogs to mutations in tandem repeats.

Nested tandem repeats are described as repeating unit lengths that are variable or unknown and frequently include an asymmetric hierarchy of smaller repeating units. These repeats are constructed from distinct groups of homologous-length monomers. An algorithm known as NTRprism was created by Oxford Nanopore Technologies researchers to enable for the annotation of repetitive structures in built satellite DNA arrays. The algorithm NTRprism is developed to find and display the satellite repeating periodicity.

==Biotechnology==
Kang. et al. successfully &quot;in vitro&quot; amplified up to 5kb of a sequence containing 36 identical 99bp tandem repeats and a 561bp sequence with 91% AT content using SHARP, which utilizes engineered superhelicases with enhanced processivity and speed. SHARP combines single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) and superhelicases with standard PCR reagents to achieve isothermal amplification that mimics biological DNA replication. The method operates at a constant temperature, eliminating the need for thermal cycling, and has shown particular utility in cases where traditional PCR either fails to amplify target sequences or produces unwanted side products.

<doc id="519481" wikidata="Q1699816" url="?curid=519481" title="John Dickinson (inventor)">
<text>John Dickinson (29 March 1782 – 11 January 1869) was an Englishman who invented a continuous mechanised papermaking process. He established in 1809 the English paper and stationery producer Longman &amp; Dickinson, which later evolved into John Dickinson Stationery.

== Early life ==
Dickinson was probably born in London, the eldest of nine children of Captain Thomas Dickinson RN (1754–1828) and his wife, Frances de Brissac (1760–1854). Thomas Dickinson was the superintendent of the Ordnance Transports at Woolwich and Frances Dickinson was the daughter of a French silk-weaver in Spitalfields. At the age of fifteen, Dickinson started a seven-year apprenticeship as a stationer with Messrs Harrison and Richardson in London. He was admitted to the Livery of the Stationers&#x27; Company in 1804 and began to trade, in stationery, in the City of London.

==Inventor==
Dickinson demonstrated his resourceful nature by inventing a new kind of paper for cannon cartridges. This type of paper did not smoulder after the cannon had fired, which had been the cause of constant accidental explosions in the artillery. Until his time, paper was produced using rag and esparto, instead of the conventional wood pulp Dickinson patented his invention, and it was taken up by the army. It was said to have been of great value in the battles against Napoleon, increasing the British firing rate while simultaneously reducing premature firing accidents.

==Paper mills==
Attempts had already been made to build a machine capable of the continuous manufacture of paper to replace the handmade techniques then used, notably by the Frenchman Henry Fourdriner. Dickinson patented his own design in 1809. In the same year he gained the financial backing from George Longman, whose family controlled the Longman publishing firm, and formed a new company, Longman &amp; Dickinson. Money was borrowed from the printer and MP Andrew Strahan (1749–1831).

Dickinson was then able to purchase Apsley Mill which had already been converted to manufacture paper by the previous owner. George Stafford, the seller, had been one of Dickinson&#x27;s suppliers. Dickinson installed his own machinery at the mill. In 1811 he bought a second paper mill in nearby Nash Mill (formerly a medieval corn-mill). Between 1828 and 1830, he built a third one in Croxley. The canal at Apsley, Nash Mills and Croxley provided power for the mills and transport for materials and product.

Penny Post, a paper containing silk threads, was produced by Dickinson, for security purposes. He also developed envelopes that had a gum-like adhesive to keep them closed. Production of those started in 1850. When Dickinson built himself a new house on the east of Nash Mills in 1836, he was his own architect. He called it Abbots Hill. It was located on a hillside site looking down upon his mills in the valley bottom.

In 1858, Dickinson passed on his thriving business to his nephew, John Evans. Over the years, the company has merged with several other stationery manufacturers. The most recent was with Hamelin Brands in 2008 From small beginnings, his company went on to become John Dickinson Stationery, one of the largest stationery manufacturers in the world.

== Dickinson paper making process ==
The process consisted of a perforated cylinder of metal, with a closely fitting cover of finely woven wire, which revolved in a vat of wood pulp. The water from the vat was carried off through the axis of the cylinder, leaving the fibres of the wood pulp clinging to the surface of the wire. An endless web of felt passed through what was known as a &#x27;couching roller&#x27; lying upon the cylinder drew off the layer of pulp which when dried became paper.

== Family ==
In 1810, he married Ann Grover (1789–1874), daughter of Harry Grover (1761–1835), senior partner in the &quot;Hemel Hempstead Bank&quot; (now part of Lloyds Bank) in Hemel Hempstead. There were seven children. John Dickinson, the writer, was the eldest surviving son. One of the daughters, Harriet Ann, married her first cousin, son of Dickinson&#x27;s sister Anne and her husband Arthur Benoni Evans. John Evans, Dickinson&#x27;s nephew and son-in-law, took over the business, and also achieved eminence in several scholarly fields.

Dickinson&#x27;s grandchildren included Sir Arthur John Evans (1851–1941), curator of the Ashmolean Museum and excavator of Minoan Crete, and his brother Lewis Evans (1853–1930), the collector. Their half-sister was Dame Joan Evans (1893–1977), a British historian of French and English mediaeval art, who was a great-niece of John Dickinson. According to family tradition the Dickinsons were distantly related to the American solicitor and politician John Dickinson (1732-1808), one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.

<text>John Dickinson (November 13, O.S. November 2] 1732 – February 14, 1808), a Founding Father of the United States, was an attorney and politician from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Wilmington, Delaware. Dickinson was known as the &quot;Penman of the Revolution&quot; for his twelve &quot;Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania&quot;, published individually in 1767 and 1768, and he also wrote &quot;The Liberty Song&quot; in 1768.

As a member of the First Continental Congress, where he signed the Continental Association, Dickinson drafted most of the 1774 Petition to the King, and then, as a member of the Second Continental Congress, he wrote the 1775 Olive Branch Petition. Both of these attempts to negotiate with King George III of Great Britain failed. Dickinson also reworked Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s language to write the final draft of the 1775 Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms.

While in Congress, Dickinson served on the committee that wrote the Model Treaty, a template for seeking alliances with foreign countries, but he opposed independence from Great Britain. He either abstained or was absent from the vote on the Declaration of Independence and refused to sign the document after its passage. Nevertheless, Dickinson wrote the first draft of the 1776–1777 Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union and served as a militia officer during the Revolution. He later was elected president of the 1786 Annapolis Convention, which called for the Constitutional Convention of 1787, and as a delegate from Delaware, he signed the United States Constitution.

One of the wealthiest men in the British American colonies, Dickinson served as president of Delaware (1781–1783) and president of Pennsylvania (1782–1785). Upon Dickinson&#x27;s death, President Thomas Jefferson referred to Dickinson as, &quot;(a)mong the first of the advocates for the rights of his country when assailed by Great Britain&quot; and called him &quot;one of the great worthies of the revolution.&quot;

Together with his wife Mary Norris Dickinson, he is the namesake of Dickinson College, Penn State Dickinson Law, and the Dickinson Complex at the University of Delaware. John Dickinson High School in Wilmington, Delaware, was dedicated in his honor in 1959.

==Family history==

Dickinson was born at Crosiadore Plantation, his family&#x27;s tobacco plantation near the village of Trappe in Talbot County, Province of Maryland. He was the great-grandson of Walter Dickinson who came from England as an indentured servant to the Colony of Virginia in 1654 and, having joined the Society of Friends, came with several co-religionists to Talbot County on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay in 1659. There, with on the banks of the Choptank River, Walter began a plantation, &quot;Croisadore&quot;, meaning &quot;cross of gold.&quot; Walter also bought on St. Jones Neck in what became Kent County, Delaware.

&quot;Croisadore&quot; passed through Walter&#x27;s son, William, to his grandson, Samuel, the father of John Dickinson. Each generation increased the landholdings so that Samuel inherited on five farms in three Maryland counties; over his lifetime he increased that to . He also bought the Kent County property from his cousin and expanded it to about , stretching along the St. Jones River from Dover to the Delaware Bay. There he began another plantation and called it Poplar Hall. These plantations were large, profitable agricultural enterprises worked by slave labor, until 1777 when John Dickinson freed the enslaved of Poplar Hall.

Samuel Dickinson married Judith Troth (1689–1729) on April 11, 1710. They had nine children; William, Walter, Samuel, Elizabeth, Henry, Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot;, Rebecca, and Rachel. The three eldest sons died of smallpox while in London seeking their education. Widowed with two young children, Henry and Betsy, Samuel married Mary Cadwalader in 1731. She was the daughter of Martha Jones, the granddaughter of Dr. Thomas Wynne, and the prominent Quaker John Cadwalader, who was the grandfather of General John Cadwalader of Philadelphia. Their sons, John, Thomas, and Philemon were born in the next few years.

For three generations the Dickinson family had been members of the Third Haven Friends Meeting in Talbot County, and the Cadwaladers were members of the Meeting in Philadelphia. But in 1739, John Dickinson&#x27;s half-sister, Betsy, was married in an Anglican church to Charles Goldsborough in what was called a &quot;disorderly marriage&quot; by the Meeting. The couple would be the grandparents of Maryland Governor Charles Goldsborough.

Leaving &quot;Croisadore&quot; to elder son Henry Dickinson, Samuel moved to Poplar Hall, where he had already taken a leading role in the community as judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Kent County. The move also placed Mary nearer her Philadelphia relations. Poplar Hall was situated on an artificially straightened section of the St. Jones River. There was plenty of activity delivering the necessities and shipping the agricultural products produced. Much of this product was wheat that along with other wheat from the region, was milled into a &quot;superfine&quot; flour. Most people at this plantation were servants and slaves of the Dickinsons.

==Early life and education==

Dickinson was educated at home by his parents and by recent immigrants employed for that purpose. Among them was the Presbyterian minister Francis Alison, who later established New London Academy in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Most important was his tutor, William Killen, who became a lifelong friend and who later became Delaware&#x27;s first chief justice and chancellor. Dickinson was precocious and energetic and in spite of his love of Poplar Hall, his family was drawn to Philadelphia.

At age 18, Dickinson began studying law under John Moland in Philadelphia. While there, he became friends with fellow students George Read, Samuel Wharton, and others. In 1753, he went to London for three years of study at the Middle Temple. He spent those years studying the works of Edward Coke and Francis Bacon at the Inns of Court, following in the footsteps of his lifelong friend, Pennsylvania Attorney General Benjamin Chew, and in 1757 was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar beginning his career as barrister and solicitor.

In protest to the Townshend Acts, Dickinson published &quot;Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania&quot;, which were first published in the &quot;Pennsylvania Chronicle&quot;. Dickinson&#x27;s letters were reprinted by numerous other newspapers, and they emerged among the most influential American political documents prior to the American Revolution. Dickinson argued that the British Parliament had the right to regulate commerce but lacked the right to levy duties for revenue. Dickinson further warned that if the colonies acquiesced to the Townshend Acts, Parliament would lay further taxes on the colonies in the future. After publishing these letters, he was elected in 1768 to the American Philosophical Society as a member.

On July 19, 1770, Dickinson married Mary Norris, known as Polly, a prominent and well educated 30-year-old woman in Philadelphia with a substantial holding of real estate and personal property, including a 1,500 volume library, one of the largest in the colonies at the time, who had been operating her family&#x27;s estate, Fair Hill, for several years by herself with some support from her sister. She was the daughter of wealthy Philadelphia Quaker and Speaker of the Pennsylvania General Assembly Isaac Norris and Sarah Logan, the daughter of James Logan. She was also cousin to the Quaker poet Hannah Griffitts. Dickinson and Norris had five children, but only two survived to adulthood: Sarah Norris &quot;Sally&quot; Dickinson and Maria Mary Dickinson. Dickinson never formally joined the Quaker Meeting because, as he explained, he believed in the &quot;lawfulness of defensive war&quot;. He and Norris were married in a civil ceremony.

In Philadelphia, they lived at Fair Hill near the present-day Germantown neighborhood in Philadelphia, which they modernized through their combined wealth. Meanwhile, Dickinson built an elegant mansion on Chestnut Street, but never lived there because the mansion was confiscated and turned into a hospital during his 1776–77 absence in Delaware. It then became the residence of the French ambassador and then the residence of Dickinson&#x27;s brother, Philemon Dickinson. On October 4, 1777, Fair Hill was burned by the British during the Battle of Germantown. While in Philadelphia as state president, Dickinson lived at the confiscated mansion of Joseph Galloway at Sixth and Market Streets, which is now the State Presidential Mansion.

Dickinson lived at Poplar Hall for extended periods from 1776 to 1777 and from 1781 to 1782. In August 1781, Poplar Hall was sacked by Loyalists and was badly burned in 1804. It is now owned by the state of Delaware and is open to the public. In 1785, following his service as president of Pennsylvania, Dickinson lived in Wilmington, Delaware, and built a mansion at the northwest corner of 8th and Market Streets in Center City Philadelphia.

==Career==
===Continental Congress===
Dickinson was one of the delegates from the Province of Pennsylvania to the First Continental Congress in 1774 and the Second Continental Congress in 1775 and 1776. In support of the cause, he continued to contribute declarations in the name of the Congress. Dickinson wrote the Olive Branch Petition as the Second Continental Congress&#x27; last attempt for peace with King George III, who did not read the petition. But through it all, agreeing with George Read and many others in Philadelphia and the lower counties, Dickinson&#x27;s objective at first was reconciliation, not independence and revolution. Dickinson prepared the first draft of the Articles of Confederation in 1776, after others had ratified the Declaration of Independence despite his concerns that the Declaration would escalate the Revolutionary War, which began in 1775 at the Battle of Lexington and Concord. At the time, he chaired the committee charged with drafting the Articles of Confederation, Dickinson was serving in the Continental Congress as a delegate from the Province of Pennsylvania.

When the Second Continental Congress began the debate on the Declaration of Independence on July 1, 1776, Dickinson reiterated his opposition to declaring independence at that time. Dickinson believed that the Congress should complete the Articles of Confederation and secure a foreign alliance before issuing a declaration. Dickinson also objected to violence as a means for resolving the Thirteen Colonies&#x27; dispute with Britain. He abstained or absented himself from the votes on July 2 that declared independence and absented himself again from voting on the wording of the formal declaration on July 4. Dickinson understood the implications of his refusal to vote saying, &quot;My conduct this day, I expect will give the finishing blow to my once too great and, my integrity considered, now too diminished popularity.&quot; Dickinson refused to sign the declaration, and since a proposal had been brought forth and carried that stated &quot;for our mutual security and protection&quot;, no man could remain in the Continental Congress without signing it, so Dickinson voluntarily departed and joined the Pennsylvania patriot militia. John Adams, a fierce advocate for independence and Dickinson&#x27;s adversary on the floor of Congress, remarked, &quot;Mr. Dickinson&#x27;s alacrity and spirit certainly become his character and sets a fine example.&quot;

Dickinson is one of only two members of the First Continental Congress who actively took up arms during the Revolutionary War.

In the Pennsylvania militia, known as the Associators, Dickinson was given the rank of brigadier general and led 10,000 soldiers to Elizabeth, New Jersey, to protect that area against British attack from Staten Island. But because of his unpopular opinion abstaining from supporting independence, two junior officers were promoted above him.

===Return to Poplar Hall===
Dickinson resigned his commission in December 1776 and went to stay at Poplar Hall in Kent County. While there, Dickinson learned that his home on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia had been confiscated and converted into a hospital. He stayed at Poplar Hall for more than two years. The Delaware General Assembly tried to appoint him as their delegate to the Second Continental Congress in 1777, but he refused. In August 1777, he served as a private with the Kent County militia at Middletown, Delaware, under General Caesar Rodney to help delay General William Howe&#x27;s march to Philadelphia during the Philadelphia campaign. In October 1777, Dickinson&#x27;s friend Thomas McKean appointed him as a brigadier general in the Delaware Militia, but he again declined the appointment. Shortly afterwards, Dickinson learned of the burning of Fair Hill during the battle of Germantown.

In 1777, Dickinson, by then Delaware&#x27;s wealthiest farmer and largest slaveholder, decided to free his slaves. While the number of slaves in Kent County was not as large as the Southern Colonies and Dickinson had only 37 slaves, this action has been described as requiring considerable personal courage on Dickinson&#x27;s part. The strongly abolitionist Quaker influences around them likely were influential in his decision, and his action was facilitated by the fact that his farm had moved away from farming tobacco to less labor-intensive crops, including wheat and barley. Dickinson was the only Founding Father to free his slaves prior to 1786 when others also began doing so, except for Benjamin Franklin, who had freed his slaves by 1770.

===President of Delaware===

On January 18, 1779, Dickinson was appointed to be a delegate for Delaware to the Second Continental Congress, which was convening at what today is Independence Hall in Philadelphia. During this term, he signed the Articles of Confederation, which he authored while serving in the First Continental Congress as a delegate from Province of Pennsylvania. In August 1781, while still a delegate in Philadelphia, he learned that Poplar Hall had been severely damaged by a Loyalist raid. Dickinson returned to the property to investigate the damage, and remained there for several months.

In October 1781, while at Poplar Hall, Dickinson was elected to represent Kent County in the State Senate. Shortly after, the Delaware General Assembly elected him president of Delaware. The General Assembly&#x27;s vote was nearly unanimous; the only dissenting vote was cast by Dickinson himself. Dickinson took office on November 13, 1781, and served until November 7, 1782. Beginning his term with a &quot;Proclamation against Vice and Immorality,&quot; he sought ways to bring an end what he perceived to be the disorder of the American Revolution. It was a popular position and enhanced his reputation both in Delaware and Pennsylvania. Dickinson then successfully challenged the Delaware General Assembly to address lagging militia enlistments and to properly fund the state&#x27;s assessment to the Confederation government. Recognizing the delicate negotiations then underway to end the American Revolution, Dickinson secured the Assembly&#x27;s continued endorsement of the French alliance, with no agreement on a separate peace treaty with Great Britain.

On October 10, 1782, Dickinson was elected to the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania. On November 7, 1782, a joint ballot by the Council and the Pennsylvania General Assembly elected him as president of the council and thereby president of Pennsylvania. But he did not actually resign as president of Delaware. Even though Pennsylvania and Delaware shared the same governor until very recently, attitudes were changing, and many in Delaware were upset at seemingly being cast aside so readily, particularly after Philadelphia newspapers began criticizing Delaware for permitting its office holders to be non-residents. Dickinson&#x27;s constitutional successor, John Cook, was considered too weak in his support of the Revolution. On January 12, 1783, Cook called for a new election to choose a replacement, leading Dickinson to formally resign.

===President of Pennsylvania===

When the American Revolution began, Dickinson fairly represented centrist views in Pennsylvania politics at a time when views varied over independence. The Pennsylvania General Assembly at the time was dominated by the Loyalists and moderates who, like Dickinson, did little to support the burgeoning Revolution or independence, except protest. The Radicals took matters into their own hands, using irregular means to write the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, which by law excluded from the franchise anyone who would not swear loyalty to the document or the Christian Holy Trinity. In this way, all Loyalists, moderate Whigs, and Quakers were kept out of government. This peremptory action seemed appropriate to many during the crises of 1777 and 1778 but less so in the later years of the Revolution, and the moderate Whigs gradually became the majority.

Dickinson&#x27;s election to the Supreme Executive Council was the beginning of a counterrevolution against the Constitutionalists. He was elected president of Pennsylvania on November 7, 1782, garnering 41 votes to James Potter&#x27;s 32. As president he presided over the intentionally weak executive authority of the state and was its chief officer but always required the agreement of a majority to act. He was re-elected twice and served the constitutional maximum of three years; his election on November 6, 1783, was unanimous. On November 6, 1784, he defeated John Neville, who also lost the election for vice president the same day. Working with small majorities in the General Assembly in his first two years and with the Constitutionalists in the majority in his last year, all issues were contentious. At first he endured withering attacks from his opponents for his alleged failure to fully support the new government in large and small ways. He responded ably and survived the attacks. He managed to settle quickly the old boundary dispute with Virginia in southwestern Pennsylvania but was never able to satisfactorily disentangle disputed titles in the Wyoming Valley resulting from prior claims of Connecticut to those lands. An exhausted Dickinson left office October 18, 1785. On that day a special election was held in which Benjamin Franklin was unanimously elected to serve the ten days left in Dickinson&#x27;s term.

Perhaps the most significant decision of his term was his patient, peaceful management of the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783. This was a violent protest of Pennsylvania veterans who marched on the Continental Congress demanding their pay before being discharged from the Continental Army. Somewhat sympathizing with their case, Dickinson refused Congress&#x27;s request to bring full military action against them, causing Congress to vote to remove themselves to Princeton, New Jersey. And when the new Congress agreed to return in 1790, it was to be for only 10 years, until a permanent capital was found elsewhere.

===United States Constitution===

After his service in Pennsylvania, Dickinson returned to Wilmington, Delaware, where he was quickly appointed to represent Delaware at the Annapolis Convention, where he served as its president. In 1787, Delaware sent him as one of its delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, along with Gunning Bedford Jr., Richard Bassett, George Read, and Jacob Broom. There, he supported the effort to create a strong central government but only after the Great Compromise assured that each state, regardless of size, would have an equal vote in the future United States Senate. As he had done with the Articles, he also carefully drafted it with the term &quot;Person&quot; rather than &quot;Man&quot; as was used in the Declaration of Independence. He prepared initial drafts of the First Amendment. Following the Convention he promoted the resulting Constitution in a series of nine essays, written under the pen name &quot;Fabius&quot;.

Dickinson himself did not sign the constitution as he left early due to chronic illness but instead a colleague, George Read signed his name.

In 1791, Delaware convened a convention to revise its existing Constitution, which had been hastily drafted in 1776. Dickinson was elected president of this convention, and although he resigned the chair after most of the work was complete, he remained highly influential in the content of the final document. Major changes included the establishment of a separate Chancery Court and the expansion of the franchise to include all taxpayers. Dickinson remained neutral in an attempt to include a prohibition of slavery in the document, believing the General Assembly was the proper place to decide that issue. The new Constitution was approved June 12, 1792. Dickinson had freed his slaves conditionally in 1776 and fully by 1787.

Dickinson returned to the State Senate for the 1793 session but served just one year before resigning because of his declining health. He was the Anti-Administration nominee in the 1795 United States Senate special election in Delaware, losing by one vote to congressman Henry Latimer.

In his final years, he worked to further the abolition movement and donated a considerable amount of his wealth to the &quot;relief of the unhappy&quot;. In 1801, Dickinson published two volumes of his collected works on politics.

==Death and legacy==

Dickinson died at Wilmington, Delaware, and was buried in Friends Burial Ground in Wilmington. Shortly before his death he unconditionally freed all of his slaves. While he had been economically reliant on them, he also wanted slavery to end. By freeing all of his slaves upon his death, he thought this would contribute to the United States having a future without slavery. Like many of the founders he believed slavery would die &quot;a natural death.&quot;

In an original letter discovered November 2009 from Thomas Jefferson to Joseph Bringhurst, caretaker of Dickinson in his later years, Jefferson responds to news of Dickinson&#x27;s death:
&quot;A more estimable man, or truer patriot, could not have left us. Among the first of the advocates for the rights of his country when assailed by Great Britain, he continued to the last the orthodox advocate of the true principles of our new government and his name will be consecrated in history as one of the great worthies of the revolution.&quot;

He shares with Thomas McKean the distinction of serving as chief executive of both Delaware and Pennsylvania after the Declaration of Independence. Dickinson College and Dickinson School of Law (now of the Pennsylvania State University), separate institutions each operating a campus located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on land inherited and managed by his wife Mary Norris, were named for them. Dickinson College was originally named &quot;John and Mary&#x27;s College&quot; but was renamed to avoid an implication of royalty by confusion with &quot;William and Mary.&quot; And along with his &quot;Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania&quot;, Dickinson also authored &quot;The Liberty Song&quot;.

Dickinson Street in Madison, Wisconsin, is named in his honor, as is John Dickinson High School in Milltown, Delaware, and Dickinson Hall at the University of Delaware.

An original stage play &quot;Except, Mr. Dickinson&quot; was presented at the 15th Street Meeting House in an off-Broadway setting. The show was written by August Nigro.

== Social and religious views ==
Dickinson was a self-taught scholar of history, and spent most of his time in historical research. As an intellectual, he thought that men should think for themselves, and his deepening studies led him to refuse to sign the Declaration of Independence, which was subsequently unanimously adopted by the remaining delegates to the Second Continental Congress. Dickinson did not consider it wise to plunge into immediate war; rather, he thought it best to use diplomacy to attain political ends and used the insights he gained from his historical studies to justify his caution. Given that Dickinson was raised in an aristocratic family, his cautious and thoughtful temperament was influenced by his Quaker affiliation and upbringing. As Dickinson grew to learn more about historical movements, however, he came to embrace the Revolutionary cause. Dickinson was very careful and refined in thought. Dickinson wrote in 1767, &quot;We cannot act with too much caution in our disputes. Anger produces anger; and differences, that might be accommodated by kind and respectful behavior, may, by imprudence, be enlarged to an incurable rage.&quot; He did not behave rashly, insisting that prudence was the key to great politics. Dickinson used his study of history and furthered his education to become a lawyer, which exposed him to more historical schooling. His education and religion allowed him to make important political decisions based on reason and sound judgment. John Powell states, &quot;...these forces of Puritanism had a vigorous expression. It is precisely because Dickinson epitomized the philosophic tenets of the Puritan Revolution that his theories were of enormous importance in the formation of the Constitution, and have considerable meaning for us today.&quot; His studies of history and religious viewpoints had a profound impact on his political thought and actions.

Dickinson incorporated his learning and religious beliefs to counteract what he considered the mischief flowing from the perversion of history and applied them to its proper use according to his understanding. His religiosity contributed heavily to his discernment of politics. Quakers disseminated their theologico-political thought aggressively and retained a significant measure of political influence. Dickinson&#x27;s political thought, given his education and religion, was influential towards the founding of the United States. The political theory of Quakers was informed by their theology and ecclesiology, consequently Dickinson applied his religious beliefs and his belief in adhering to the letter of the law in his approach to the Constitution, referring to his historical knowledge as he did so. Quakers did use secular history as a guide for their political direction, and they considered scripture the most important historical source.

Jane Calvert has argued that Dickinson was an early feminist, partly attributable to Quaker culture. He believed that women were spiritually equal to men and deserved equal religious rights. Unlike many men of the era, Dickinson sought and took political counsel from women, particularly from his wife and his mother. Dickinson was also good friends with Quaker feminist Susanna Wright and corresponded with Catharine Macaulay and Mercy Otis Warren. He encouraged both Warren and Macaulay to continue writing. He bought books that detailed the lives of strong Quaker women. As a lawyer, Dickinson often defended poor women in court, including Rachel Francisco, a &quot;free mollato&quot; who had been charged with infanticide. In 1776, while drafting the Articles of Confederation, Dickinson proposed the first gender inclusive language in an American constitution. In the proposed religious liberty clause, he wrote &quot;No person or persons in any Colony living peaceably under the Civil Government shall be molested or prejudiced in his or their {his or her} persons or Estate for his or her religious persuasion or Practise, nor be compelled to frequent or maintain or contribute to maintain any religious Worship, Place of Worship, or Ministry, contrary to his or her Mind.&quot;

==Almanac==
Delaware elections were held October 1 and members of the General Assembly took office on October 20 or the following weekday. The State Legislative Council was created in 1776, and its legislative councilmen served a three-year term. Beginning in 1792, it was renamed the State Senate. State Assemblymen had a one-year term. The whole General Assembly chose the state president for a three-year term.

Pennsylvania elections were also held in October. Assemblymen had a one-year term. The Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council was created in 1776, and counsellors were popularly elected for three-year terms. A joint ballot of the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the Council chose the president from among the twelve counsellors for a one-year term. Both assemblies chose the Continental Congressmen for a one-year term as well as the delegates to the Constitutional Convention, which convened in Philadelphia from May 25 to September 17, 1787.

<text>TRON (acronym for The Real-time Operating system Nucleus) is an open architecture real-time operating system kernel design. The project was started by Ken Sakamura of the University of Tokyo in 1984. The project&#x27;s goal is to create an ideal computer architecture and network, to provide for all of society&#x27;s needs. For different scenarios, the need for different OS kernels was identified. (See, for example, papers written in English in TRON Project 1988 )

The Industrial TRON (ITRON) derivative was one of the world&#x27;s most used operating systems in 2003, being present in billions of electronic devices such as mobile phones, appliances and even cars. Although mainly used by Japanese companies, it garnered interest worldwide. However, a dearth of quality English documentation was said to hinder its broader adoption. The situation has improved since TRON Forum has taken over the activities to support TRON Project since 2015. (See the specification page that lists many English documents. )

The focus of these activities was a non-profit organization called TRON Association which acted as the communication hub for the parties concerned with the development of ITRON specification OS and its users in many fields including home electronics, smart house industry, etc.

In 2002, T-Engine Forum was formed to provide an open source RTOS implementation that supersedes the ITRON specification OS, and provides binary compatibility additionally. The new RTOS was T-Kernel. The activities of TRON Association to support TRON Project were taken over by T-Engine Forum in 2010. In 2015, T-Engine Forum changed its name into TRON Forum. 

Today, ITRON specification OS and T-Kernel RTOS are supported by popular Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) libraries such as wolfSSL.

== History ==

In 1984, the TRON project was officially launched. In 1985, NEC announced the first ITRON implementation based on the ITRON/86 specification. In 1986, the TRON Kyogikai (unincorporated TRON Association) was established, Hitachi announced its ITRON implementation based on the ITRON/68K specification, and the first TRON project symposium is held. In 1987, Fujitsu announced an ITRON implementation based on the ITRON/MMU specification. Mitsubishi Electric announced an ITRON implementation based on the ITRON/32 specification, and Hitachi introduced the Gmicro/200 32-bit microprocessor based on the TRON VLSI CPU specification.

In 1988, BTRON computer prototypes were being tested in various schools across Japan as the planned standardized computer for education. The project was organized by both the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Education. However, Scott Callon of Stanford University writes that the project ran into some issues, such as BTRON being incompatible with existing DOS-based PCs and software. At the time NEC controlled 80–90% of the education market with DOS infrastructure, so adopting BTRON would have meant getting rid of all existing infrastructure. The existing incompatible PC software had also been personally written by school personnel, who opposed BTRON for this incompatibility with their earlier projects. There was also no software yet for the brand new computer. The project was additionally at least a year behind schedule and didn&#x27;t perform better than earlier systems although that had been promised, which was possibly affected by the OS having been made by a firm that hadn&#x27;t written one before. Because of these reasons, at the end of 1988 the Ministry of Education decided that it would not support the project unless BTRON was also made compatible with DOS. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry had hoped to avoid supporting NEC&#x27;s domination of the PC market with DOS.

BTRON integration with NEC DOS architecture was difficult but possible with negotiation. In April 1989 the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative issued a preliminary report accusing BTRON of being a trade barrier, as it only functioned in Japan, and asked the Japanese government not to make it standard in schools. TRON was included along with rice, semiconductors, and telecommunications equipment in a list of items targeted by Super-301 (complete stop of import based on section 301 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988). It was removed from the list after the USTR inspection team visited the TRON Association in May. In June the Japanese government expressed their regret at U.S. intervention but accepted this request not to make it standard in schools, thus ending the BTRON project. Callon opines that the project had nevertheless run into such difficulties that the U.S. intervention allowed the government to save face from cancelling the project.

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, in 1989 US officials feared that TRON could undercut American dominance in computers, but that in the end PC software and chips based on the TRON technology proved no match for Windows and Intel&#x27;s processors as a global standard. In the 1980s Microsoft had at least once lobbied Washington about TRON until backing off, but Ken Sakamura himself believed Microsoft wasn&#x27;t the impetus behind the Super-301 listing in 1989. Known for his off the cuff remarks, in 2004 governor of Tokyo Shintaro Ishihara mentioned in his column post concerning international trade policy that TRON was dropped because Carla Anderson Hills had threatened Ryutaro Hashimoto over it.

On 10 November 2017, TRON Forum, headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, which has been maintaining the TRON Project since 2010, has agreed with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, headquartered in the US, to share the copyrights of TRON μT-Kernel 2.0 specification, the most recent version of T-Kernel (the successor of the original ITRON) for free. This was to facilitate the creation of IEEE standard of RTOS based on μT-Kernel specification.

Stephen Dukes, Standards Committee, vice chair, IEEE Consumer Electronics Society of that time said that IEEE will &quot;accelerate standards development and streamline global distribution&quot; through the agreement. 

On September 11, 2018, &quot;IEEE 2050-2018 - IEEE Standard for a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for Small-Scale Embedded Systems&quot;, a standard based on &quot;μT-Kernel 2.0 was officially approved as an IEEE standard.

In May 2023, the IEEE recognized the RTOS, proposed, created, and released by TRON Project, as an IEEE Milestone, titled &quot;TRON Real-time Operating System Family, 1984.&quot; The certified Milestone plaque is installed on the campus of the University of Tokyo, where Ken Sakamura, the leader of TRON Project, worked as a research assistant in 1984.

== Architecture ==

TRON does not specify the source code for the kernel, but instead is a &quot;set of interfaces and design guidelines&quot; for creating the kernel. This allows different companies to create their own versions of TRON, based on the specifications, which can be suited for different microprocessors.

While the specification of TRON is publicly available, implementations can be proprietary at the discretion of the implementer.

The TRON framework defines a complete architecture for the different computing units:

* ITRON (Industrial TRON): an architecture for real-time operating systems for embedded systems; this is the most popular use of the TRON architecture
** JTRON (Java TRON): a sub-project of ITRON to allow it to use the Java platform
* BTRON (Business TRON): for personal computers, workstations, PDAs, mainly as the human–machine interface in networks based on the TRON architecture
* CTRON (Central and Communications TRON): for mainframe computers, digital switching equipment
* MTRON (Macro TRON): for intercommunication between the different TRON components.
* STRON (Silicon TRON): hardware implementation of a real-time kernel.
* TRON (encoding), a way that TRON represents characters (as opposed to Unicode).

== Administration ==

The TRON project was administered by the TRON Association for a long time. After it was integrated into T-Engine Forum in 2010, and T-Engine Forum changed its name to TRON Forum in 2015, TRON Forum has supported the TRON Project by acting as the communication hub for the parties involved.
