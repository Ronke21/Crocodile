<text>Raymond Jacques Adrien Sabouraud (; 24 November 1864 – 4 February 1938) was a French physician born in Nantes. He specialized in dermatology and mycology, and was also an accomplished painter and sculptor.

He studied medicine in Nantes and Paris, and worked as a hospital interne at the Hôpital Saint-Louis under Ernest Besnier and at the Hôpital des Enfants-Assistés under Edouard Francis Kirmisson. Afterwards he studied bacteriology with Pierre Paul Émile Roux at the Pasteur Institute. In 1894 he received his doctorate, and he later served as chief of Jean Alfred Fournier&#x27;s laboratory at the Hôpital Saint-Louis.
In 1904, Sabouraud introduced radiological treatment against ringworm of the scalp. He was well known for his knowledge of scalp diseases, and had a clinic which attracted patients from all over the world.

He invented a method to select fungi with a medium of low pH and a rather high concentration of sugar. This medium, called Sabouraud agar is named after him.

With Ferdinand-Jean Darier (1856–1938) and Henri Gougerot (1881–1955), he was the editor of an eight-volume encyclopedia of dermatology titled &quot;Nouvelle Pratique Dermatologique&quot;. His &quot;Manuel élémentaire de dermatologie topographique régionale&quot; (1905), was translated into English and published as &quot;Elementary Manual of Regional Topographical Dermatology&quot; (1906), and several years later re-published as &quot;A Manual of Regional Topographical Dermatology&quot; (1912).

<doc id="512323" wikidata="Q270102" url="?curid=512323" title="Rugby sevens">
<text>Rugby sevens (commonly known simply as sevens, and originally seven-a-side rugby) is a variant of rugby union in which teams are made up of seven players playing seven-minute halves, instead of the usual 15 players playing 40-minute halves. Rugby sevens is administered by World Rugby, the body responsible for rugby union worldwide. The game is popular at all levels, with amateur and club tournaments generally held in the summer months. Sevens is one of the most well distributed forms of rugby, and is popular in parts of Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas, and especially in the South Pacific.

Rugby sevens originated in the 1880s in the Scottish town of Melrose; the Melrose Sevens tournament is still played annually. The popularity of rugby sevens increased further with the development of the Hong Kong Sevens in the 1970s and was later followed by the inclusion of the sport into the Commonwealth Games for the first time in 1998 and the establishment of the annual World Rugby Sevens Series in 1999 and the World Rugby Women&#x27;s Sevens Series in 2012. In 2016, rugby sevens was contested in the Summer Olympics for the first time. It has also been played in events such as the Games of the Small States of Europe, Pan American Games and the Asian Games, and in 2018 a women&#x27;s tournament was played for the first time at the Commonwealth Games.

==Overview==
Rugby sevens is sanctioned by World Rugby, and is played under similar laws (with exceptions noted below) and on a field of the same dimensions as the 15 player game. Whereas a regular rugby union match lasts at least 80 minutes, a normal sevens match consists of two halves of seven minutes with a two-minute half-time break. Previously, the final of a competition could be played over two halves of ten minutes each, but beginning in 2017, final-round matches were limited to seven-minute halves (excluding ties) in an effort to reduce injuries. Sevens scores are generally comparable to regular rugby scores, but scoring occurs much more frequently in sevens, since the defenders are more spaced out. The scoring system is the same as regular rugby union, namely five points for a try, three points for a penalty or drop goal and two points for a post-try conversion.

The shorter match length allows rugby sevens tournaments to be completed in a day or a weekend. Many sevens tournaments have a competition for a cup, a plate, a bowl, and a shield, allowing many teams of different standards to avoid leaving empty-handed.

Sevens tournaments are traditionally known for having more of a relaxed atmosphere than fifteen-a-side games, and are often known as &quot;festivals&quot;. Sevens tournaments gained their &quot;popularity as an end of season diversion from the dourer and sterner stuff that provides the bulk of a normal season&#x27;s watching.&quot; Fans frequently attend in fancy dress, and entertainment is put on for them.

The Hong Kong Sevens tournament has been especially important in popularising the game in Asia, and rugby sevens has been important as a form of international rugby &quot;evangelism&quot;; hence it is perhaps the most widely played form of the game, with tournaments in places as far apart as Bogota and Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Kenya, Singapore and Scandinavia, as well as the countries in which rugby union is well known.

==Laws ==

Sevens is played on a standard rugby union playing field. The field measures up to long and wide. On each goal line is an H-shaped goal.

===Variations to the laws of the game===
There are several variations in laws which apply to rugby sevens, primarily to speed up the game and to account for the reduced number of players. The main changes can be summarised as follows:

* 7 players per team on field (instead of 15).
* Five substitutes, with five interchanges (instead of 8).
* Seven minute halves (instead of 40-minute halves, in fifteen-a-side).
* Maximum of two minutes half-time (instead of ten minutes).
* Matches drawn after regulation are continued into golden point extra time, in multiple 5-minute periods.
* All conversion attempts must be drop-kicked (instead of having the option to place-kick).
* Conversions must be taken within 30 seconds of scoring a try (instead of 90 seconds). Prior to 2016, the limit had been 40 seconds.
* Three player scrums (instead of eight players).
* Kick-offs: in sevens, the team which has just scored kicks off, rather than the conceding team, as in fifteen-a-side.
* Yellow cards net a 2-minute suspension (instead of 10 minutes) to the offender.
* Referees decide on advantage quickly (where one play usually ends advantage, unlike in fifteens).
* In major competitions, there are additional officials present (in-goal touch judges) to judge success of kicks at goals, which means the game is not delayed waiting for touch judges to move into position to judge conversion attempts.

==Gameplay==

===Positions and gameplay===
Teams are composed of seven players – three forwards and four backs. Scrums are made up of three players from each team. The chart below shows a team&#x27;s typical formation at scrum time, with three forwards bound into the scrum, a scrum-half waiting to retrieve the ball once it exits the scrum, and three backs positioned to receive a pass.
The numbers shown here are for illustrative purposes only. Unlike rugby fifteens, where a player&#x27;s number corresponds to their position, numbering in rugby sevens is more flexible. In a squad of twelve players, the players will be numbered one through twelve. The starting players can have any of the twelve numbers, not necessarily one through seven. No set numbers differentiate positions; for example, numbers one through three are not reserved for forwards, but can be worn by any squad player. 

In open play, a typical defensive formation involves a line of six defenders, with one sweeper behind the line. With the attacking team using all seven players against the defending team&#x27;s six in the line, the attacking team often attempts to move the ball to create an overload. The defensive line can be put under pressure if the defending team makes a tackle and commits players to the ruck; with fewer players in the defending line, it leaves more space for the attacking team to exploit.

===Pace of the game===
Rugby sevens tends to be played at a faster pace than rugby fifteens. Because of the faster nature of the game, sevens players are often backs or loose forwards in fifteens rugby. The differences are most notable on game restarts. Because scrums in sevens involve three players forming one row instead of eight players forming three rows, scrums tend to assemble more quickly, require fewer restarts, and the ball exits the scrum more quickly. Penalties in sevens are generally taken with a quick tap, instead of a kick for touch and a line out, resulting in the ball being put back in play more quickly. When a player is tackled and a ruck is formed, the ball tends to exit the ruck more quickly, as the attacking team generally has only three players involved in the ruck – the tackled player, one support player, and one scrum-half.

==History==
===Origins===

At Loretto School in Musselburgh, Scotland, the then headmaster Hely Hutchinson Almond got the schoolboys to play short-sided matches in the 1860s and 1870s. This was to improve the players&#x27; passing. A full rugby union match, at the time, was twenty-a-side and individualism was the style. Almond stated that he:

urged on his boys in the sixties that if only they would pass constantly and systematically to each other, they would baffle any side unaccustomed to such tactics.

Almond, a pioneer in collectivism in rugby union, struggled to get his schoolboys to get used to the system. The schoolboys stated this was &#x27;funking&#x27;; but by 1872 he was organising eleven-a-side matches with Edinburgh Academicals. In 2007, Almond was nominated for the IRB Hall of Fame but was not inducted.

Collectivism did eventually take hold with new clubs, and Scotland exported it through Sevens around the world, and sides like New Zealand and South Africa quickly realised the benefits of collectivism. The bigger clubs in Scotland were reluctant to change their ways. They were winning, and could attract the best individualists from other clubs to maintain their position. In 1895 the &quot;Scottish Referee&quot; newspaper was still criticising West of Scotland for not using the collective method.

In England, the push for smaller sides eventually resulted in the formation of rugby league; and there was experimentation with numbers in the north of England prior to the split. There was a six-a-side tournament in Huddersfield in September 1879, played under regular rules but with 10 minute halves. Other tournaments were played over the next few years across the North before being replaced by a nine-a-side game. Matches attracted large crowds and raised thousands to support the clubs or local hospital charities. In August 1890, Yorkshire suspended 8 teams and in September Lancashire banned games with less than 15-a-side over allegations of professionalism; short sided games effectively ended in England.

====Scotland====
Rugby sevens was initially conceived in 1883 by Ned Haig and David Sanderson, who were butchers from Melrose, Scotland as a fund-raising event for their local club, Melrose RFC. The first-ever sevens match was played at The Greenyards, the Melrose ground, where it was well received. Two years later, Tynedale was the first non-Scottish club to win one of the Borders Sevens titles at Gala in 1885.

Rugby union sevens&#x27; popularity in the Borders spread north throughout Scotland:- Aberdeen hosting Sevens in 1889; Edinburgh hosting Sevens in 1896; Glasgow hosting Sevens in 1898; Dundee hosting Sevens in 1901. The popularity of Sevens exploded in the 1920s and 1930s. From the 19th century to today, over 150 Sevens tournaments in Scotland are known; and though some tournaments have folded; new tournaments continue to be born.

Sevens remain popular in Scotland; and the Melrose Sevens annually attracts around 12,000 spectators to the small Borders town. The Melrose Sevens centenary tournament in 1983 attracted 17,500 fans.

===International spread===

====England====

A rugby sevens tournament was played by St. Helens Cricket Club on 29 May 1886; and the final took place a week later. A rugby sevens tournament was organised by Warrington F.C. (a rugby club) on their athletics day on 14 August 1886 but it was not repeated. A rugby sevens match was played in Chorley, Lancashire as part of the Chorley Rugby and Athletic club&#x27;s sports day on 22 July 1888; another match looks to have taken place the following year on 24 August 1889. The Rainford Athletics Club hosted a Sports Day on 7 August 1888 with a 3 team rugby sevens tournament, but this was a one-off and not repeated. Sevens then ended in England and it would be a long wait for any future English Sevens tournaments to arrive, with the exception of a Whitsuntide event, which included sevens, at Hexham in 1894 which seemed to go ahead without official backing. The Hexham Whitsuntide Sports committee tried to invite Hawick RFC as their star guests, but without backing this did not come off.

For a long time the English Rugby Union held against rugby sevens being played in England. English clubs, particularly those close to the Scottish border and aware of the game&#x27;s success in Scotland, wanted to play their own tournaments. Their pleas went in vain.

England finally hosted its first Sevens tournament in 1921 as the Scottish game crept south over the border. This was on 23 April 1921 by Carlisle rugby club; they beat a Hawick &#x27;B&#x27; side in the final. Next was on 3 September 1921 in north east England at the Percy Park Sevens in North Shields. It was close to the Scottish Borders and Scottish sides were invited to play in the tournament with local English sides. The final was contested between Selkirk and Melrose; with Selkirk winning the event.

First played in 1926, the Middlesex Sevens were set-up by Dr J.A. Russell-Cargill, a London-based Scot. The tournament was intended as a fundraiser for King Edward VII Hospital. It raised £1,600; at a time when standard admission was a shilling, and stand seats cost five shillings. This became England&#x27;s premier Sevens tournament:- it had some formidable figures on its sub-committee such as Wavell Wakefield and Bill Ramsay; it was close to London – and 10,000 spectators attended the second Middlesex tournament; and it helped rugby in London develop – featuring the aforementioned Wavell Wakefield, Carl Aarvold (later Recorder of the City of London) of Blackheath FC, Wick Powell of London Welsh RFC, and John Tallent, who would later become chairman of the Four Home Unions Tours Committee. Invitation sides graced the Sevens tournament:- such as Sale RFC in 1936, which included such players as Wilf Wooller and Claude Davey of and Ken Fyfe of amongst their backs; and in 1939, Cardiff RFC, which included players such as Wilf Wooller again, and Les Spence and Wendy Davis.

====India====

The Earl of Dalhousie became Governor-General of India in the middle of the nineteenth century. He took his summers in the Indian western Himalayas. His base there, also called Dalhousie, and the neighbouring Khajjiar region, remains known as a &#x27;Little Scotland of India&#x27;. Teams from Dalhousie and Chamba played various sports against one another at the Khajjiar Gymkhana. The Chamba side was a mixed civilian and native side; the Dalhousie side was a military side. On 29 June 1886 at 1am they played a rugby sevens match, as the Dalhousie players favoured rugby union; and the Chamba players, that had already beaten Dalhousie in cricket and association football, confidently obliged. The Dalhousie side unsurprisingly won the match; with the newspaper report seeming to blame Chamba&#x27;s native players for the loss, a sad reflection of the times.

====New Zealand====

Sevens then spread from Scotland to Dunedin; a Scottish expatriate city in New Zealand. The first Dunedin Sevens tournament was the Charity tournament in aid of Dunedin hospital on 28 September 1889. From Dunedin, sevens spread north to Christchurch where Canterbury Rugby Union held a Sevens tournament on 16 September 1893. On 23 May 1894, sevens had almost reached the North Island with a tournament in Nelson.

====Australia====

The first notice of a Sevens tournament in Australia is that of Central Queensland Rugby Union&#x27;s tournament in Rockhampton on 4 July 1891. The Wanderers won the tournament beating the Waratahs and the Berserkers.

====Ireland====

In Ireland, Douglas RFC of Cork attempted to host a Sevens tournament on 8 December 1900. However, due to inclement weather this did not come off. The first Sevens tournament in Ireland was then the Belfast tournament of 30 April 1921 in aid of the Warriors Day fund. This was run by the northern branch of the IRFU.

====Argentina====

The next country to host a Sevens tournament was Argentina; arriving again via Scottish expatriates. The Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club hosted their own Sevens event on 9 July 1921. The Buenos Aires club defeated Belgrano Athletic Club in the final. The Buenos Aires club went on to host Sevens tournaments on 9 July every year; however a pitch-invasion tradition at the final meant that no further winners were recorded until 1937. The 9 July is Argentina&#x27;s Independence Day holiday; and a feast is often prepared in celebration. It is said that the pitch invasion tradition started when a bell, announcing that food was ready, rang out during the final.

===National side tournaments===

====First international tournament====

The first-ever officially sanctioned tournament for national teams was the 1973 International Seven-A-Side Tournament held at Murrayfield as part of the &quot;Scottish Rugby Union&#x27;s Celebration of Rugby&quot; centenary celebrations.

====Hong Kong Sevens====
Due to the success of the format, the Scottish connection continued in the establishment of the Hong Kong Sevens in the 1970s. Founded largely by expats such as &quot;Tokkie&quot; Smith, the Hong Kong Sevens were ahead of their time and an influential force in the modernisation of rugby union. For example, the Hong Kong Sevens was one of the first rugby union tournaments to attract major sponsorship when the airline Cathay Pacific sponsored the inaugural tournament in 1976. They also provided a level of cosmopolitan international competition, which tended not to exist in rugby before the first Rugby World Cup in 1987, especially since was not seen as one of the &quot;Big Eight&quot;. By 1986, the Hong Kong Sevens were held up as a positive example to others, although many of the smaller nations&#x27; teams were largely made up of expatriates.

====World Cup====

The Rugby World Cup Sevens, in which the &quot;Melrose Cup&quot; is contested, was launched in 1993.

===International development===

Rugby sevens continues to be popular in the Scottish Borders, where the ten most prestigious tournaments make up a league competition known as the Kings of the Sevens. In honour of the role of Melrose RFC in the creation of rugby sevens, the club was inducted, along with Haig, to the IRB Hall of Fame in 2008. Top club sides and international sides frequently enter the Sevens tournaments in Scotland; the Melrose Sevens, as the founding event of the sport, being the most prestigious.

Sevens has also taken strong root in the Pacific island nations of Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa, as well as in Kenya. In many minor rugby nations, such as in Poland, development has tended to concentrate on rugby sevens as a means of introducing the sport to people. Rugby sevens has become popular in places such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai, which are not so successful in the fifteen-a-side code. In addition, seven of the 15 current &quot;core teams&quot; that compete in all legs of the World Series represent nations that are not within the recognised top tier of the 15-man game – Fiji, Samoa, Kenya, the United States, Canada, Portugal, and Japan.
Recently there has been the introduction of many new teams to the sevens circuit such as Russia and Germany.

===Rugby league sevens===

Rugby league also has a long heritage in the seven-a-side game. The world record rugby league crowd for sevens was 80,000 in Roundhay Park, Leeds, 1932, before a royal audience. In the modern era, however, small-sided rugby league has concentrated on the Nines format, which boasts similar adaptations to the league code as sevens does with the union code.

Both Bradford and Wigan rugby league sides have defeated rugby union teams in major rugby union sevens tournaments, demonstrating the adaptability of rugby league players generally.

==Major tournaments==
=== World Rugby Sevens Series ===
The World Series was a series held every season since the 1999–2000 inaugural season. Each season the Sevens Series held from seven to eleven tournaments, from around October and concluding around June. Most tournaments see 16 teams competing – mostly &quot;core teams&quot; that participate in each event, but also some teams that win the right to participate in select events. The last tournament was held in the 2022–2023 season.

New Zealand has been the dominant force in the Sevens Series, winning 13 out of the 23 seasons, including the first six seasons from 1999–2000 to 2004–05. In recent years, however, several other teams have challenged New Zealand&#x27;s dominance. Fiji won the Series in 2005–06 and again in 2014–15 and 2015–16; South Africa won in 2008–09 and 2016–17; and Samoa claimed the 2009–10 crown. Other strong contenders include England and Australia, each of whom have had several top four finishes in recent seasons. The 2015 London Sevens, saw the United States win their first-ever tournament in the World Series.

Notable World Series players include England&#x27;s Dan Norton, who has scored more tries (&gt;230) than any other player; and England&#x27;s Ben Gollings, who has scored more points (2,652) than any other player.

=== World Rugby Women&#x27;s Sevens Series ===
The Rugby Women&#x27;s Sevens Series was held every season since the 2012–13 inaugural season. Each season the Sevens Series held from five to six tournaments, usually starting around November and concluding around June. Most tournaments see 12 teams competing – mostly &quot;core teams&quot; that participate in each event, but also some teams that win the right to participate in select events. The last series was held in the 2022–2023 season

New Zealand have been the most dominant team in the series since its establishment by winning four of the six competitions held up to and including 2018.

===SVNS===

In 2023 World Rugby re-branded the Sevens series to a new World Rugby SVNS Series (known for sponsorship reasons as the HSBC SVNS). World Rugby announced it will fully combine the men’s and women’s tours aligning with the Olympic competition model, with both taking place on the same weekends in the same cities and venues starting in December 2023 in Dubai and will conclude in Madrid in June 2024. The idea is to bring about a festival type atmosphere in each city across the world. Both men and women&#x27;s teams will earn the same with equal participation fees. The new format will showcase the twelve best men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams, which will conclude in a Grand Final weekend where the top eight teams will compete to be crowned Series champions. The teams ranked ninth to twelfth will compete against the top four teams from a new Challenger Series in a relegation play-off to see who secures their place in the 2024–2025 season.

===Summer Olympics===
The International Olympic Committee voted in 2009 to include rugby sevens on the program for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. There were two open spots for sports and initially seven sports began the bidding for inclusion in the 2016 program. The event debuted in an Olympic program at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics.

Two issues related to differences between the structures of rugby union and the Olympics were sorted out before the 2016 Olympic Games. The issue of a combined British team has proven less of a problem in rugby union. World Rugby chief executive Mike Miller endorsed the concept of a combined British sevens team in 2011 for the 2016 Olympics and beyond. Another issue is the status of Northern Ireland. World Rugby recognises the Irish Rugby Football Union as the sport&#x27;s governing body for the entire island of Ireland. By contrast, the International Olympic Committee recognises the British Olympic Association as the governing body of the UK Olympic team, while the Olympic Council of Ireland usually fields teams representing all of Ireland in sports which are organised on an all-Ireland basis. Northern Irish sevens players play for the Irish team.

In the men&#x27;s competition Fiji won the gold medal in the sport&#x27;s Olympic debut, with Great Britain taking the silver and South Africa the bronze. The women&#x27;s gold medal was won by Australia, with New Zealand taking silver and Canada bronze.

===World Cup Sevens===
The Rugby World Cup Sevens is held every four years and is the premier international rugby sevens tournament outside of the Olympic Games. The first tournament was held at Murrayfield in 1993 with England becoming the first team to win the event. Fiji and New Zealand are the most successful, with Fiji winning two World Cups and New Zealand winning three World Cups. In the men&#x27;s competition teams compete for the Melrose Cup and in the women&#x27;s competition, launched in 2009, teams compete for the Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup Sevens Trophy.

Beginning with the 2018 edition, which was held in San Francisco, United States, the World Cup Sevens is held in the middle of the Summer Olympic cycle, two years after each Olympics. As part of the drive to include Sevens as an Olympic sport, World Rugby proposed ending the World Cup event entirely to ensure the Olympic event had the greatest prestige. However, following feedback, World Rugby and the IOC recognised the benefit to keeping the typically much larger World Cup event (24 teams), but to align it timewise with the more streamlined Olympic tournament (12 to 16 teams).

===Commonwealth Games===

Rugby sevens has been played at each of the Commonwealth Games every four years since its first appearance at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and was the first major international multisports event to include the sport. Rugby sevens is a &quot;Core&quot; sport by the Commonwealth Games Federation, necessitating its appearance at all future games. The New Zealand team has won the gold medal four times with South Africa winning the tournament at Glasgow 2014 beating the defending champions in the final. Through the 2014 Games in Glasgow, it was the last remaining male-only sport at the Commonwealth Games, after women&#x27;s boxing was added for those Games. Women&#x27;s sevens made its Commonwealth Games debut in the 2018 Games. The New Zealand teams won the gold medal in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions.

==Regional tournaments==

Rugby sevens is played at various regional multi-sport competitions, including the Asian Games and the Pacific Games. Rugby union was formerly played at the World Games, but this has ceased as rugby is now an Olympic sport.

===Asian Games===

A men&#x27;s rugby sevens was introduced at the Asian Games in 1998. A women&#x27;s tournament was added in 2010.

===Pan American Games===

Men&#x27;s rugby sevens at the Pan American Games has been held every four years since the 2011 Pan American Games, with Canada, Argentina, and the United States placing for medals each time. Women&#x27;s rugby sevens was later added to the program for the 2015 Pan American Games.

===European Sevens Championship===
The Rugby Europe Sevens Grand Prix Series serves as a regional qualifier for two types of tournaments. The top two finishing teams each year who are not core members of the World Rugby Sevens Series advance to the Hong Kong Sevens, the qualifying tournament for teams vying to achieve core team status in the World Rugby Sevens Series. The Europe Grand Prix also serves as a regional qualifier for major quadrennial tournaments, such as the summer Olympics and the Rugby World Cup Sevens.

In Europe, Portugal dominated in sevens during the Championship era (2002–10); only twice the team did not win the trophy, in 2007 and 2009, when both times the championships were won by Russia. 
In the Grand Prix Series era from 2011 to the present, the champions became England and France; both teams won the trophy twice in a row. Portugal won the first edition, while Russia is the current champion.

===Premier Rugby Sevens===
Premier Rugby Sevens is a standalone, professional rugby sevens circuit based in North America and sanctioned by USA Rugby as the highest level of domestic sevens. The league began play in 2021 and has been scheduled opposite to the World Rugby Sevens Series in order to feature top American and other international caliber players.

==Women&#x27;s rugby sevens==
Women&#x27;s rugby sevens has been dominated by New Zealand, with either the New Zealand team (1999–2001) or Aotearoa Maori Women&#x27;s Rugby sevens team (playing as New Zealand), winning the annual Hong Kong Sevens tournament from 1997 until 2007. The United States won the Hong Kong Sevens in 2008 by defeating Canada in the final (New Zealand failed to send a team).

The inaugural Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament took place in Dubai together with the men&#x27;s tournament during the first weekend of March 2009. England defeated Canada 12–0 in the Bowl final while Australia edged New Zealand 15–10 in extra-time to become the first to win the Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup.

WR, then known as the International Rugby Board (IRB), organised its first official women&#x27;s sevens tournament outside of the World Cup as part of the 2011 Dubai Sevens. This was part of a plan to launch a full IRB International Women&#x27;s Sevens Series for 2012–13. The international series was officially christened as the IRB Women&#x27;s Sevens World Series in an IRB announcement on 4 October 2012. The series, as planned, launched for the 2012–13 season and initially featured events in Dubai, the US, China and the Netherlands. Two additional events were planned for the 2013–14 series, but in the end only one of these events, in Brazil, took place. For the 2014–15 series, China dropped from the schedule, while Canada and England hosted new events. The series was rechristened for 2014–15 as the World Rugby Women&#x27;s Sevens Series, following the November 2014 renaming of the IRB as World Rugby. The 2015–16 series included only five events; the England and Netherlands events were dropped and an event in France was added. The 2016–17 series returned to six events with the launch of an event in Japan.

Women&#x27;s rugby sevens was included in the 2016 Olympic Games due to the IRB&#x27;s successful bid to reintroduce rugby to the Summer games. Australia claimed the gold medal for the event, beating New Zealand in the final with a score of 24–17. Canada claimed the bronze medal after beating Great Britain 33–10 in the third place play-off. WR also successfully pushed for the inclusion of women&#x27;s sevens in the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

Many of the Scottish Sevens club tournaments run women&#x27;s events as part of their Sevens.

==Sevens vs Fifteens==
As sevens has proven a commercial and competitive success, sevens is starting to become divorced from the 15-man game. Former Wales rugby union player and current pundit John Taylor wrote in 2010, stating:

<doc id="512325" wikidata="Q2599279" url="?curid=512325" title="Yampa River">
<text>The Yampa River flows through northwestern Colorado, United States. Rising in the Rocky Mountains, it is a tributary of the Green River and a major part of the Colorado River system. The Yampa is one of the few free-flowing rivers in the western United States, with only a few small dams and diversions.

The name is derived from the Snake Indians word for the Perideridia plant, which has an edible root. John C. Frémont was among the first to record the name &#x27;Yampah&#x27; in entries of his journal from 1843, as he found the plant was particularly abundant in the watershed.

==Course==
The headwaters of the Yampa are in the Park Range in Routt County, Colorado as the confluence of the Bear River and Phillips Creek, near the town of Yampa. The Bear River, larger of the two, flows from a source of at Derby Peak in the Flat Tops Wilderness. The Yampa River then flows north through a high mountain valley, through Stagecoach Reservoir and Lake Catamount, before reaching Steamboat Springs, where it turns sharply west. Below Steamboat Springs, the Yampa flows through a wider valley in the western foothills of the Rockies. It receives the Elk River from the north, then passes the towns of Milner and Hayden.

After entering Moffat County the Yampa passes Craig and is joined by the Williams Fork. West of Craig, the Yampa crosses arid, sparsely populated sagebrush country for about before reaching Cross Mountain Canyon, where the river slices a deep gap through the namesake mountain. Below Cross Mountain the Yampa enters the open valley of Lily Park, where it is joined by its largest tributary, the Little Snake River. Further west it enters Dinosaur National Monument, where it traverses more than of rugged canyons and rapids. The Yampa joins the Green in Echo Park at Steamboat Rock deep within the national monument, about from the Colorado–Utah border.

==Watershed==
The Yampa drains of mostly semi-arid plateau country in northwestern Colorado and a small portion of southern Wyoming. The bulk of the watershed is located between the Park Range, to the east; the Flat Tops, to the south; and the Uinta Mountains, to the west. The Great Divide Basin, an area of closed drainage, borders the Yampa River basin to the north. The Continental Divide runs along the north and east sides of the Yampa basin, separating it from the headwaters of the North Platte River, which flows into the Mississippi River system. On the south, the Yampa River basin is bordered by that of the White River, which like the Yampa flows in a westerly direction to join the Green.

==Volume==
The Yampa River is a typical Western snow-fed stream, but unlike most other rivers in the western United States its seasonal discharge patterns are not affected by large dams and water projects. The river forms a noticeably wide, shallow braided stream throughout much of its course. The lower three fourths of the Yampa, from the Elk River down, are navigable by small craft. However the meandering, shallow nature of the river can render the river unnavigable during late summer in low water years.

The average flow at the confluence of the Green is , averaging during the spring runoff of April–July, and falling below during late summer and autumn. The upper section of the river freezes over between December and March.

According to a U.S. Geological Survey stream gage at Deerlodge Park, about above the mouth, the average river flow was between 1983 and 2013. The highest annual mean was in 2011, and the lowest in 2002. Monthly recorded average flows were highest in May at and lowest in September at . The highest recorded peak flow was during the record snowmelt of May 18, 1984.

==Ecology==
Because the Yampa River maintains a relatively natural flow pattern, it supports a productive riparian zone environment along much of its course. In addition, much of the river is unconstrained by levees allowing it to maintain its natural floodplain. This is also true of its main tributary, the Little Snake River. The Yampa River Preserve west of Steamboat Springs protects a rare riparian forest type consisting of narrowleaf cottonwood, box elder and red-osier dogwood that was once more common in the Upper Colorado River Basin. The Yampa&#x27;s warm, silty waters are an ideal spawning ground for native fish such as the Colorado pikeminnow and humpback chub which have largely disappeared from dammed waterways in other parts of the Colorado River system.

==History==
===Native Americans===
Archaeological studies conducted in the Dinosaur National Monument have revealed evidence of human habitation up to 7000 BC. The Fremont culture or Desert Archaic people inhabited the Yampa River basin starting about 800 AD, but disappeared for reasons uncertain during the 1400s. The Fremont created petroglyphs along the Yampa River Canyon, of which more than 300 are still visible today. After the collapse of the Fremont culture, a branch of the Utes moved into the Yampa River basin. The White River Utes inhabited the valleys of the Yampa and White Rivers and the Rockies of northwestern Colorado. The band living in the Yampa River valley was known as the Yamparika or Yapudttka Utes. At times the river also served as a boundary between the Utes and Shoshone peoples to the north; there was also a band of Shoshone called the Yamparika.

The name &quot;Yamparika&quot; is a Snake Indians word meaning &quot;yampa eaters&quot;, &quot;yampa&quot; referring to the edible roots of the &quot;Perideridia&quot; plant. &quot;Yampa&quot; itself probably meant &quot;water-plant&quot; or &quot;common plant&quot;. In 1843 explorer John C. Frémont was among the first to record the name &quot;Yampah&quot;, finding this plant to be of particular abundance in the watershed. Some fur traders in the 1800s thought Yampa was the Ute word for &quot;bear&quot;, and the Yampa was often called the Bear River on early maps.

==Dam and diversion proposals==
During the 1960s, the Yampa and Green River canyons were slated to be flooded under a reservoir created by Echo Park Dam, a U.S. Bureau of Reclamation water project. Due to environmentalists&#x27; opposition, this dam was never built, and the free-flowing character of the Yampa was retained. However, as part of the compromise to preserve Echo Park, the controversial Glen Canyon and Flaming Gorge dam projects were allowed to move forward, damming the Colorado and Green Rivers, respectively. Today the Yampa remains the only major tributary in the Colorado River system without a single large dam along its course (the moderately sized Stagecoach Dam, built 1989 and several others on the headwaters have only a limited impact on its flow).

In December, 2006, a report proposed to pump water from the Yampa River 200 miles east, under the Continental Divide, to the state&#x27;s major cities along the Front Range. The diversion was proposed to start near Maybell, downstream of Craig, Colorado . The proposal faces widespread opposition because it could lower river flows in late summer due to the diversion.

<text>Arariboia (old spelling: Ararigboya; – 1589) was the founder of the city of Niterói, in Brazil.

Son of Temiminó chief Maracajá-guaçu, he was the leader of the Temiminó tribe, which inhabited the territory of the present Espírito Santo state after losing their territories to long-term enemies, the Tamoios, only to come back to Rio de Janeiro in 1564 with Estacio de Sá&#x27;s fleet. Under his leadership, the tribe assisted the Portuguese in their war with France for total control of the Guanabara Bay, sending an infantry of armed soldiers to retake the Guanabara Bay from the French, as Arariboia had become the leader of the temimiminó, after his father, reinforcing the Bay with about 8,000 native indigenous soldiers, who were quite knowledgeable of the territory, as they once called it home.

The French, meanwhile, had settled in the Guanabara Bay in 1555, occupying the Serigipe Island (current Ilha de Villegagnon), where they built the Coligny Fort. To counter Portuguese forces, the French commander, Nicolas Durand de Villegagnon, formed an alliance with the Tamoios, native indigenous people, allocating about 70,000 people by the coast. The agreement prevented the forces sent from Salvador by Mem de Sá, governor-general of Brazil in 1565, from achieving a definitive victory against the French. With the unity of the colony in danger, Mem de Sá sent his nephew Estácio de Sá in and entrusted him to adopt the same strategy as the French: enlist indigenous support.

The most violent confrontation occurred on January 20, 1567, at Uruçumirim, on the present-day Glória hill, where the French and Tamoios were quartered. Climbing over cliffs, Arariboia was the first to enter the enemy stronghold. He held a torch, with which he blew up the powder and opened the way for the attack. During the fight, a poisoned arrow grazed Estácio de Sá&#x27;s face, who later died of infection. The attack was followed by a nightly slaughter, from which the Portuguese and Temimimó forces emerged victorious. In a legendary episode, Arariboia allegedly swam across the bay to lead the assault.

After their victory, Arariboia remained in Rio de Janeiro until 1573, when his tribe officially received the lands (sesmaria) across the Guanabara Bay on November 22.

The fact is that, with his support, the Portuguese operation against the French was successful, and the Portuguese regained control over Guanabara Bay. From then on, the city of Rio de Janeiro, which in the meantime had been founded by Estácio de Sáin 1565 by the Cara de Cão hill, was assured of its survival. After the defeat of the Tamoios, as a reward for his deeds, Arariboia received from the Portuguese Crown, first, a piece of land in today&#x27;s São Cristóvão, close to Ilha do Governador. Later, in 1573, he received a piece of land on the other side of Guanabara Bay, where he would have the mission to protect the other side of the bay&#x27;s entrance.

This sesmaria (piece of land given by the Portuguese Crown) was named São Lourenço dos Índios, which is now considered the beginning of the current city of Niterói (term that, translated from the Tupi language, means &quot;true cold river&quot;, by the junction of &#x27;y, &quot;river; eté, &quot;true&quot;; and ro&#x27;y, &quot;cold&quot;), 30 minutes away from Rio de Janeiro, by ferry boat. He converted to Christianity and adopted the name Martim Afonso de Sousa, in honour of the Portuguese navigator of the same name, who commanded a Portuguese exploration that touched Guanabara, in 1530. Also the chieftain Tibiriçá, from the Planalto Paulista adopted the name Martim Afonso de Sousa. He ended his days in conflict with the new Governador-General of the southern part of the state of Brazil (headquartered in Rio de Janeiro), Antônio Salema (1575-1577). At the official inauguration ceremony, Arariboia, having travelled from Niterói to Rio de Janeiro, sat down with his legs crossed.

This displeased the governor, who reprimanded him. Arariboia retorted, &quot;My legs are tired from fighting so hard for your King, that&#x27;s why I cross them when I sit down”. The elderly cacique then returned to the sesmaria of Niterói, and is said to never have set foot in Rio de Janeiro again.

Arariboia also received the title of knight of the Order of Christ, Captain of the village (Capitão-Mor), a salary of 12,000 réis per year and a piece of clothing that had belonged to King Sebastian of Portugal.

In 1568 he received the Christian name of Martim Afonso, to honour Martim Afonso de Sousa.

Arariboia drowned near the island of Mocanguê in 1589.

In Tupi, his name refers to a venomous snake from the Boidae family.

Notable Descendants

Violante do Céu Soares de Sousa

Indigenous woman descendant of Araribóia, married to Domingos de Araújo. She donated the land for the construction of a chapel in 1652, the origin of the current São Domingos de Gusmão Church, located in Niterói, in front of the Gragoatá Campus of the Universidade Federal Fluminense.

José Luíz of Araribóia Cardoso

José Luís do Nascimento Cardoso founded the Glorifying Commission to Martim Afonso Arariboia - also referred to as the Devotion to São Lourenço, and was president of the Commission. José Luiz introduced himself as being of the 12th generation of descendants of the Temiminó chief Araribóia, a justification used to have him sign in the works of the Commission as José Luís de Araribóia Cardoso. He was archivist and janitor of the São Lourenço dos Índios Church, playing a key role in the organisation of the works of the Glorifying Commission.

The holiday of November 22 became &quot;Araribóia Day&quot; in the city of Niterói from the reclamation of José Luís, and became an official holiday as of 1909, even though, since 2021, the date is no longer considered a municipal holiday. Another important contribution of the Commission based on José Luiz&#x27;s proposition was the transfer of the ownership of the São Lourenço dos Índios Church to the municipality of Niterói, according to Ordinance No. 476, June 13, 1934, when José Luíz de Araribóia Cardoso took on the position of archivist and janitor as a municipal civil servant. If today we think of Araribóia as the mythological founder of Niterói, this is due both to the figure of José Luiz and to the work of the Glorifying Commission, dissolved in 1915 for unknown reasons.

<text>Squander (written as &quot;$QUANDER&quot; on the box and in the rules) is an Avalon Hill board game published in 1965. It is based loosely on the game Monopoly, but in reverse. As in Monopoly, players roll dice and move around a board, encountering opportunities to make financial decisions. The object, however, is to lose money rather than gain it. Each player starts with a million &quot;Squanderbucks&quot; and the winner is the first player to become bankrupt.

<text>The State University of New York College at Geneseo (SUNY Geneseo, Geneseo State College or, colloquially, &quot;Geneseo&quot;) is a public liberal arts college in Geneseo, New York. It is New York&#x27;s public honors college and part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system. The college was founded in 1867 as the Wadsworth Normal and Training School before it became part of the new State University of New York system as a state liberal arts college in 1948.

==History==
The initial predecessor to SUNY Geneseo opened in 1867 as the Wadsworth Normal and Training School through an act of the New York State Legislature. However, the legislature later changed the new college&#x27;s name to the Geneseo Normal and Training School before it officially opened on September 13, 1871.

In 1962, the school adopted its current name, State University of New York College at Geneseo. Just two years later, in 1964, the school began to offer four-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees in subjects other than education.

==Academics==
Geneseo is a public liberal arts college with 61 undergraduate majors, 5 master&#x27;s programs, and 67 interdisciplinary minors. The most popular majors, in descending order, are education, business, the social sciences, biology, and psychology.

Geneseo is part of the New York Space Grant Consortium, and is provided grants by NASA to support outer-space related research on-campus..

===Administration===
Following the retirement of long-time President Christopher Dahl, Denise Battles became the college&#x27;s president in July 2015.

==Rankings and admissions==

===Admissions===
Geneseo&#x27;s acceptance rate is 65% as of 2021.

=== Rankings ===
&quot;Forbes&quot; ranked SUNY Geneseo 156th out of the top 500 rated private and public colleges and universities in America for the 2024-25 report. Geneseo was also ranked 69th among public colleges and 66th in the northeast.

===Phi Beta Kappa===
Geneseo has a chapter of the oldest academic honor society in the United States, Phi Beta Kappa. SUNY&#x27;s four university &quot;centers&quot; already had chapters; Geneseo&#x27;s establishment of a chapter is significant because it was the first (and is currently the only) of New York&#x27;s thirteen state comprehensive &quot;colleges&quot; to receive the honor.

The inaugural ΦΒΚ class was inducted to Geneseo&#x27;s Alpha-Gamma of New York chapter in April 2004.

==Campus==

At the far end of the South Village Residences, the college maintains the Spencer J. Roemer Arboretum wherein are preserved &quot;more than 70 species of trees, shrubs and wildflowers, including a magnificent group of oak trees which are more than 200 years old, and several black walnut trees estimated to be over 100 years old.&quot;

==Traditions and campus culture==

===The Bronze Bear===

Just off campus, in the center of Main Street in Geneseo sits the famous Bronze Bear statue. &quot;The Bear&quot; also plays host to any number of spontaneous decorations and pranks throughout the academic year. A story also circulates that one of the wealthy Wadsworth daughters saw the bear fountain in a small town in Germany, fell in love with it, bought it, and sent it back to Geneseo in the early 19th century. This story is unverified, but an excerpt from a history of the family that settled the valley implies that this is not true, and that the fountain was designed and built for its current location: &quot;[Main Street] is still dominated by a drinking fountain for horses dedicated to Mrs. Emmeline Austin Wadsworth. For some obscure reason its designer placed a short pole in its center on top of which sits a cunning little iron bear, who is generally known as &#x27;Aunt Emmeline&#x27;&quot;.

==College seal and logotype==

The Geneseo college seal was unveiled in July 1968. According to the college&#x27;s office of publications, the seal is a representation of the college&#x27;s location and mission: &quot;The circular design features a flame from the torch of knowledge surrounded by leaves symbolic of the bucolic setting of SUNY Geneseo and its growth. Both are atop waves symbolizing the historic Genesee River.&quot;

In 1986, the college designed a logo to &quot;provide the College with an identity mark that was more readily identifiable than the College Seal and was not meant to replace the College Seal.&quot; Again drawing on the college&#x27;s unique surroundings, &quot;the graphic underneath the word &#x27;Geneseo&#x27; symbolizes the rolling and rural character of the surrounding Genesee Valley.&quot; The typeface used in this logo, and in many other college publications, is &quot;Galliard&quot;.

In October 2012, Geneseo unveiled a new logotype, featured in the infobox above. Bill Caren, Geneseo&#x27;s Associate Vice President of Enrollment, stated the new word mark reflected &quot;[Geneseo&#x27;s] competitors&#x27; logos,&quot; which are less stylized. &quot;If [Geneseo] wants to be perceived in the same category as its competitors,&quot; Caren added, &quot;it would be good to have a logo that corresponds on the same level.&quot; The logotype was met with mixed responses by the student body, although its implementation throughout campus continued unhindered.

==Student organizations==

Greek life began at Geneseo in 1871, originally as literary societies. The college hosts several local Greek organizations along with national organizations, as is common in the SUNY schools. As of 2019, about 30% of students were active in either social or professional and service Greek organizations.

<text>Annia Galeria Faustina the Younger ( AD, – 175/176 AD) was Roman empress from 161 to her death as the wife of emperor Marcus Aurelius, her maternal cousin. Faustina was the youngest child of emperor Antoninus Pius and empress Faustina the Elder. She was held in high esteem by soldiers and her husband as Augusta and &quot;Mater Castrorum&quot; (&#x27;Mother of the Camp&#x27;) and was given divine honours after her death.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===

Faustina, named after her mother, was her parents&#x27; fourth and youngest child and second daughter; she was also their only child to survive to adulthood. She was born and raised in Rome.

Her second cousin three times removed, Hadrian, had arranged with her father for Faustina to marry Lucius Verus. On 25 February 138, she and Verus were betrothed. Verus&#x27; father was Hadrian&#x27;s first adopted son and his intended heir; however, when Verus&#x27; father died, Hadrian chose Faustina&#x27;s father to be his second adopted son, and eventually, he became Hadrian&#x27;s successor. Faustina&#x27;s father ended the engagement between his daughter and Verus and arranged for Faustina&#x27;s betrothal to her biological maternal cousin, Marcus Aurelius; Aurelius was also adopted by her father.

=== Imperial heiress ===

In April or May 145, Faustina and Marcus Aurelius were married, as had been planned since 138. Since Aurelius was, by adoption, Antoninus Pius&#x27; son, under Roman law he was marrying his sister; Antoninus would have had to formally release one or the other from his paternal authority (his &quot;patria potestas&quot;) for the ceremony to take place. Little is specifically known of the ceremony, but it is said to have been &quot;noteworthy&quot;. Coins were issued with the heads of the couple, and Antoninus, as &quot;Pontifex maximus&quot;, would have officiated. Marcus makes no apparent reference to the marriage in his surviving letters, and only sparing references to Faustina. Faustina was given the title of &quot;Augusta&quot; on 1 December 147 after the birth of her first child, Domitia Faustina.

=== Empress ===
When Antoninus died on 7 March 161, Marcus and Lucius Verus ascended to the throne and became co-rulers. Faustina then became empress. Following the birth of her first child in 147, Faustina obtained the title of Augusta granted to her by the Senate, before her husband Marcus Aurelius became Augustus himself in 161.
Not much has survived from the Roman sources regarding Faustina&#x27;s life, but what is available does not give a good report. Cassius Dio and the unreliable &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; accuse Faustina of ordering deaths by poison and execution; she has also been accused of instigating the revolt of Avidius Cassius against her husband. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; mentions adultery with sailors, gladiators, and men of rank; however, Faustina and Aurelius seem to have been very close and mutually devoted.

Faustina accompanied her husband on various military campaigns and enjoyed the excessive love and reverence of Roman soldiers. Aurelius gave her the title of &quot;Mater Castrorum&quot; or &#x27;Mother of the Camp&#x27;. She attempted to make her home out of an army camp. Between 170 and 175, she was in the north, and in 175, she accompanied Aurelius to the east.

=== Revolt of Avidius Cassius and death ===

That same year, 175, Aurelius&#x27;s general Avidius Cassius was proclaimed Roman emperor after the erroneous news of Marcus&#x27;s death; the sources indicate Cassius was encouraged by Marcus&#x27; wife Faustina, who was concerned about her husband&#x27;s failing health, believing him to be on the verge of death, and felt the need for Cassius to act as a protector in this event, since her son Commodus, aged 13, was still young. She also wanted someone who would act as a counter-weight to the claims of Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus, who was in a strong position to take the office of Princeps in the event of Marcus&#x27;s death. The evidence, including Marcus&#x27;s own &quot;Meditations&quot;, supports the idea that Marcus was indeed quite ill, but by the time Marcus recovered, Cassius was already fully acclaimed by the Egyptian legions of II Traiana Fortis and XXII Deiotariana.

&quot;After a dream of empire lasting three months and six days&quot;, Cassius was murdered by a centurion; his head was sent to Marcus Aurelius, who refused to see it and ordered it buried. Egypt recognized Marcus as emperor again by 28 July 175.

The facts concerning the death of Faustina are not definite. She died in the winter of 175 at the military camp in Halala (a city in the Taurus Mountains in Cappadocia). The causes of her death are of speculation of scholars and range from death from natural causes, suicide, an accident, or even possibly assassination in retaliation for her alleged affair with Cassius earlier that year, depending on the source. 

Aurelius grieved much for his wife and buried her in the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome. She was deified, with her statue placed in the Temple of Venus in Rome and a temple dedicated to her in her honor. Halala&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Faustinopolis&quot; and Aurelius opened charity schools for orphan girls called &quot;Puellae Faustinianae&quot; or &#x27;Girls of Faustina&#x27;. The Baths of Faustina in Miletus are named after her.

== Marriage and issue ==

In their thirty years of marriage, Faustina and Marcus Aurelius had at least fourteen children, including two sets of twins. Only six of them survived to adulthood, five daughters and the son Commodus.

Faustina&#x27;s role as a mother was glorified, and with the birth of her daughter Fadilla, coins were issued portraying her as Juno Lucina.

Their known children were:
* Domitia Faustina (147–151), died in childhood; 
* Titus Aelius Antoninus (born and died in 149), twin of Aurelius, died in infancy; 
* Titus Aelius Aurelius (born and died in 149), twin of Antoninus, died in infancy;
* Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla (150–182), married her father&#x27;s co-ruler Lucius Verus, then Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus, had issue from both marriages;
* Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina (born in 151), married Gnaeus Claudius Severus, had a son;
* Tiberius Aelius Antoninus (born in 152, died before 156), died in childhood;
* Unknown child (died before 158), died in childhood;
* Annia Aurelia Fadilla (born in 159), married Marcus Peducaeus Plautius Quintillus, had issue;
* Annia Cornificia Faustina Minor (born in 160), married Marcus Petronius Sura Mamertinus, had a son;
* Titus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus (161–165), elder twin brother of Commodus, died in childhood;
* Lucius Aurelius Commodus Antoninus (Commodus) (161–192), twin brother of Titus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus, later emperor, married Bruttia Crispina, no issue;
* Marcus Annius Verus Caesar (162–169), died in childhood;
* Hadrianus, died in infancy; 
* Vibia Aurelia Sabina (170 – died before 217), married Lucius Antistius Burrus, no issue.

<text>International Film Service (IFS) was an American animation studio created to exploit the popularity of the comic strips controlled by William Randolph Hearst.

Despite their similar names &quot;Hearst News&quot; IFS, California, is not related to &quot;International Film Service Company, Inc.&quot;, New York.

== History ==
In 1914, William Randolph Hearst expanded his International News Service wire syndicate into the International Picture Service, a syndicate formed to create newsreels, when newsreels were an entirely new idea. The success of the Hearst Newsreel led the media magnate to create International Film Service (IFS) in 1915. The purpose of this company was to translate Hearst&#x27;s top comic strip properties into &quot;living comic strips&quot;, to be added to the tail-end of the newsreels. For Hearst, the purpose of these cartoons was to be the same as the comics: to increase the circulation of his newspapers. The fact that former Hearst employees Winsor McCay, George McManus, and Bud Fisher were all doing very well with animated cartoons based on their Hearst comic strips (&quot;Little Nemo&quot;, &quot;The Newlyweds&quot;, and &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot;) may have had something to do with it as well, since Hearst was a sore loser.

To lead this new studio, Hearst did what he usually did: lured the best talent away from his competitors with the promise of the kind of huge salary only a Hearst could afford. The supervisor was Gregory La Cava, who had animated for the Barré Studio. La Cava was given director credit for all of the IFS cartoons. IFS cartoons were the first comic strip properties to give proper credit to the director and animators, as opposed to just the creator of the comic (their credit was in tiny print on the screen, but it was there). With him came William Nolan and Frank Moser, the fastest animators in the business. Hearst hired Raoul Barré, head of another animation studio, to animate his first series and teach the new hires how animation was done.

IFS jumped into eight different series right from the start. This was possible only because of La Cava&#x27;s extraordinary organization skills. On the other hand, the quality suffered. IFS cartoons are indeed &quot;living comic strips&quot;, with little motion and many dialog balloons instead of the intertitles used by most other animation studios. As a result, they are not very interesting to look at today. The studio did give birth to one enduring series, however: &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;. IFS was also the first studio for a whole host of future animation talent: Vernon Stallings, Walter Lantz, Ben Sharpsteen, Jack King, John Foster, Grim Natwick, Burt Gillett and Isadore Klein.

World War I proved the death-knell for IFS. Hearst had been pursuing an aggressive pro-German position for decades under the assumption that German immigrants were the core of his newspaper consistency. As a result, International News Service lost its credibility. The spiraling debt this created forced Hearst to cut out his least-profitable business, and that was IFS. The entire staff was laid off on July 6, 1918, a date referred to in animation history as &quot;Black Monday&quot;, but Hearst still cared about his animated properties, so he licensed them to John C. Terry&#x27;s studio. When that studio folded a year later, he licensed his former competitor, Bray Productions, to make the IFS cartoons. The deal lasted from 1919 to 21, when the IFS-Bray agreement broke off, with the final few cartoons released in early 1921.

<doc id="512341" wikidata="Q1236386" url="?curid=512341" title="Dolores River">
<text>The Dolores River is a tributary of the Colorado River, approximately long, in the U.S. states of Colorado and Utah. The river drains a rugged and arid region of the Colorado Plateau west of the San Juan Mountains. Its name derives from the Spanish &quot;El Rio de Nuestra Señora de Dolores&quot;, River of Our Lady of Sorrows. The river was explored and possibly named by Juan Maria Antonio Rivera during a 1765 expedition from Santa Fe.

The mean annual flow of the Dolores prior to damming was approximately , but due to diversions it has been reduced to about .

==Course==

The Dolores River rises in a meadow called Tin Can Basin, near Hermosa Peak in the San Miguel Mountains, in Dolores County, Colorado. The headwaters are located about south of Lizard Head Pass in the San Juan National Forest. The river flows southwest in a canyon past Rico, receiving the West Dolores River, then flows into McPhee Reservoir near Dolores in Montezuma County. Formed by McPhee Dam, the reservoir is about long and diverts flows of the upper Dolores River for irrigation.

Downstream from McPhee Dam, the river re-enters Dolores County and carves the Dolores River Canyon, which stretches north for over and averages deep. This section of the Dolores River is noted for its exposed sedimentary strata, desert wildlife, and during years of heavy snowmelt for its whitewater. Near Egnar the river crosses into San Miguel County and then from there into Montrose County.

Continuing north, the Dolores cuts &quot;across&quot; the Paradox Valley which runs in an unusual transverse direction to the river. Immediately below Paradox Valley it is joined by the San Miguel River, its main tributary, from the east. (Incidentally, the Dolores and San Miguel have their headwaters to either side of Lizard Head Pass.) Due to diversions on the main stem, the San Miguel is typically the same size as the Dolores if not larger, providing most of the flow below the confluence in dry years.

Below the confluence with the San Miguel, the Dolores enters Mesa County, flowing north-northwest past Gateway and then turning west into Utah. The last segment of the river, entirely within Grand County, joins the Colorado near the historic Dewey Bridge, about above Moab.

The Hanging Flume is located on the canyon wall near Uravan, Colorado.

==Discharge==
Measured at Cisco, Utah, not far above the confluence with the Colorado River, the average unimpaired discharge of the Dolores River between 1906 and 1995 was , or about . The United States Geological Survey has operated a stream gage at Cisco from 1950 to the present. For the 36-year period December 1950 to September 1986, the river flow at Cisco averaged . By contrast, in the 27 years from October 1986 (the year McPhee Dam was completed) to October 2013, the river averaged only due to the McPhee Dam diversions.

Measured at Bedrock, Colorado, at the entrance to Paradox Valley (above the San Miguel confluence) the effect of the flow reductions is more obvious, with an average of before September 1984 as compared to between October 1984 and May 2014.

==Geology==
The ancestral Dolores River is believed to have flowed south to join the San Juan River near the Four Corners in what is now northwestern New Mexico. The uplift of Sleeping Ute Mountain about 70 million years ago diverted the Dolores River to its present northward course, causing it to carve the Dolores River Canyon on its way to the Colorado River, creating unusual geologic features such as the Paradox Valley. The Dolores Canyon exposes rocks ranging from 300-million-year-old Pennsylvanian limestone to the 140-million-year-old Entrada sandstone deposited during the Jurassic. A cap of Cretaceous Dakota sandstone forms most of the upper rim of the canyon. It also includes red Wingate Sandstone.

The lower Dolores River may have once been the original course of the Colorado River, which flowed through the now dry Unaweep Canyon, currently occupied by West Creek, a small tributary of the Dolores. When the Uncompahgre Plateau was formed, it diverted the larger Colorado northwards through what is now the Grand Valley, looping around through Westwater Canyon to the confluence with the Dolores in eastern Utah and leaving Unaweep Canyon as a huge dry gap across the plateau. However, some geologists contend that Colorado never flowed through Unaweep and the lower Dolores River, as the erosive force of the river should have created a water gap here; instead, the canyon may have been formed by glaciation during the Paleozoic.

==River modifications==

The Dolores is dammed at McPhee Reservoir near Cortez, Colorado to irrigate about of arid plateau land. The dam and diversion canals are operated by the Bureau of Reclamation as the Dolores Project. In some years, almost all the water entering the reservoir is diverted, leaving only a small legally mandated minimum flow to pass downstream, as a result reducing the 150 mile (242 km) stretch between the dam and the confluence of the San Miguel River to a large creek.

The dam&#x27;s construction allowed local farmers to extend the irrigation season through September, whereas natural river flows would have been insufficient by July or August. While the dam has reduced and sometimes completely halted spring peak flows in the lower Dolores, it provides supplemental flows in late summer (August through October) in the range of , maintaining downstream fisheries. Before the dam was built, irrigators diverted nearly the entire river flow, leaving as little as to flow downstream.

Releases from McPhee Dam are a controversial topic. Currently, the Bureau of Reclamation operates McPhee on a &quot;fill, then spill&quot; policy, where the dam is filled first, and only in high water years when inflows exceed the reservoir capacity are larger flows released. This fact aggrieves recreational boaters, who claim it is difficult for anyone but a local resident closely watching the gauges to plan trips in advance on the river. The San Juan Citizens&#x27; Alliance has worked to start a dialogue between Dolores River stakeholders in the hopes of shifting release policy to one that allows for greater, planned releases.

==Recreation and conservation==
The Dolores is navigable by rafts and kayaks (up to class IV) from McPhee Reservoir to its confluence with Colorado. When water is restricted from the reservoir, it may be possible to boat downstream from the San Miguel River. However, the river is extensively used for irrigation and, during low water years, can be wholly unnavigable.

In high-runoff years, the section from Bradfield Ranch near Cahone, Colorado down to Slick Rock, Colorado, offers scenery, camping, and rapids for inflatables and kayaks. The section from Slickrock to Bedrock, Colorado goes through the goosenecks of a sandstone canyon with several mostly class II rapids. The Bureau of Land Management recommends minimum flows of for canoes, kayaks, and inflatable kayaks, for small rafts of up to , and for larger rafts of up to in size. The BLM does not require permits for groups running the river in Colorado, though permits are required from the Moab BLM office for boaters wishing to make the run from Gateway, CO, into Utah and to the confluence with the Colorado River near Dewey Bridge. In 2010, flash flooding altered Diversion Dam Rapid and Stateline Rapid on this section, making the latter very difficult to run in any vessel larger than a kayak.

Advocates have proposed establishment of a national monument encompassing 400,000 acres of the Dolores River Canyon and the surrounding region in Mesa and Montrose Counties. There are also proposals for a smaller 30,000-acre national conservation area in the northern portion (Mesa and Montrose Counties) and a 68,000-acre national conservation area and special management area in the southern portion (San Miguel, Dolores, and Montezuma Counties).

<doc id="512345" wikidata="Q679277" url="?curid=512345" title="Wildspitze">
<text>Wildspitze () is the highest mountain in the Ötztal Alps and in North Tyrol, as well as the second highest mountain in Austria after the Großglockner and in terms of prominence (2261 m) is the fourth summit of the Alps and the fifteenth of Europe.

==Location==
The Wildspitze is on a ridge called &quot;Weißkamm&quot; (&quot;white ridge&quot;) that joins the main chain of the Alps at the Weißkugel. Its north and west flanks form the end of the Pitz valley, while the south and east flanks rise above the upper ends of the Ötztal. The mountain has twin peaks, with a rocky south summit (3768 m or by most other sources 3770 m) and a firn-covered north summit at about 3760 m. The mountain is surrounded by glaciers on three sides, of which the Taschachferner (at 8 km2) is the largest. The 50° north face is popular with ice climbers.

The view from the peak is only limited by the curvature of the Earth. To the east one can see as far as the Großglockner and to the west as far as the Finsteraarhorn.

The nearest higher mountain is the Ortler, away in South Tyrol.

==Early ascents==
The first recorded attempt at the Wildspitze was made in 1847 by Hermann and Adolf Schlagintweit, who probably reached a point at 3,552 m on the north east ridge. The first successful ascent was in 1848 by Leander Klotz, a guide and farmer in the at the foot of the mountain (now part of Sölden), and another, unnamed local farmer. In August 1857, the brothers Nikodem, Leander and Hans Klotz guided , a merchant from Vienna, to the summit for the second ascent. The northern summit was somewhat higher, at the time measured to be 11,947 Viennese feet or 3,776 m, but the south summit was a better viewpoint and the first two parties had climbed it instead. On August 29, 1861, Nikodem and Leander Klotz guided Anthon von Ruthner and Friedrich R. von Enderes, both from Vienna, to the south summit again. During their hour-long stay on top, Leander traversed to the north peak, which subsequently was considered the first ascent of the main summit of the Wildspitze. However, by the end of the 20th century, snow melt had lowered the northern summit to about 3,765 m, rendering the south summit the highest point and 1848 the year of first ascent.

==Routes==
The most common route to the top is from the Breslauer Hut, which is approached from the village Vent (1900 m a.s.l.). Most climbers sleep at the hut or in a tent and continue to the summit the next day (about 4 hours from the Breslauerhütte).

An alternative route goes from the Braunschweiger Hut in the Pitztaler glacier area. From the hut the route crosses the glaciers to the Mittelbergjoch (see right image, close to the lower left corner), and then traverses a crevasse-filled area of the Taschachferner glacier to the summit of the Wildspitze. The average time used for this tour is 6.5 hours.

==Climate==
Wildspitze has a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;).

<text>The Tupolev Tu-204 () is a twin-engined medium-range narrow-body jet airliner capable of carrying 210 passengers, designed by Tupolev and produced by Aviastar-SP and Kazan Aircraft Production Association. First introduced in 1989, it was intended to be broadly equivalent to the Boeing 757, with slightly lower range and payload, and had competitive performance and fuel efficiency in its class.

It was developed for Aeroflot as a replacement for the medium-range Tupolev Tu-154 trijet in the 1990s. The latest version, with significant upgrades and improvements, is the narrow-body Tu-204SM, which made its maiden flight on 29 December 2010. In April 2022, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) announced plans to assemble 70 Tu-214s by 2030. However, in early 2024, Aeroflot expressed intention to transfer its order for fleets exclusively to next-gen MS-21 jets. The rejection of the Tupolev has various reasons, including no two-member cockpit, and also the evacuation ramps and about 13% of avionics (e.g. TCAS) still needing to be replaced by Russian equipment. The production plan eventually remains, especially for designing new domestic aircraft parts.

==Design and development==

The Tu-204 was designed as a family of aircraft incorporating passenger, cargo, combi and quick-change variants. It is powered by either two Aviadvigatel PS-90 or Rolls-Royce RB211 engines. The Tu-204 is produced at two of the largest Russian aircraft manufacturing plants in Ulyanovsk (Tu-204 series) and Kazan (Tu-214).

The Tu-204 cabin is available in several layouts, including the baseline single-class layout seating for 210 passengers and a two- or three-class layout designed for 164–193 passengers. A cargo version of the Tu-204 is being successfully operated by several airlines in Europe and Egypt.
Seating configuration is 3–3 in economy and 2–2 in Business class. The business class cabin has a seat pitch of . The passenger cabin can be divided into compartments according to class with removable bulkheads and curtains. Compartments are illuminated by reflected light. Overhead bins for passenger baggage and coats are of the closed type. The volume of baggage per passenger is .

In 1994, the first certificate for Tu-204 aircraft (with PS-90A engines) was issued. Subsequently, issued certificates have extended estimated operational conditions. The Tu-204-120 variant, certified with Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engines, complies with noise regulations described in Chapter 3 of Supplement 16 to ICAO, hence meeting all current European and ICAO requirements. The Tu-204-100 variant, certified with PS-90A engines, complies with noise regulations described in Chapter 4 of Supplement 16 to ICAO which means it is quieter. The aircraft was certified to Russian standards AP-25 (harmonized with FAR-25 and JAR-25).

===Technology===

The Tu-204 is part of the same generation of Russian aircraft as the Ilyushin Il-96. The Tu-204 features technologies such as fly-by-wire control systems, a glass cockpit, supercritical wings with winglets, and is available with Russian or foreign avionics. The wings and tails are relatively resistant to ice build-up, and as such anti-icing systems are not equipped. Among today&#x27;s airliners the Tu-204 is the only one which does not require wing anti-icing systems. During the test flight safety has been confirmed without the anti-icing system on the bearing surfaces and the aircraft obtained Russian and European certificates.

==Tu-204 variants==
===Tu-204/204C===
The Tu-204 is the basic passenger airline model, and the Tu-204C is the basic freight or cargo model. The most-used models are the -100C and the -120C.

===Tu-204-100/200===
Certified in January 1995, this initial version is powered by Soloviev (now Aviadvigatel) PS90 turbofans with 157 kN (35,300 lbf) of thrust, and uses Russian avionics in addition to its Russian engines. The Tu-204-200 is a heavier version with extra fuel for more range. Only one was built by Aviastar-SP in Ulyanovsk but has not yet been delivered (RA-64036). Now this version is only produced by KAPO in Kazan, marketed under the designation Tu-214. The Tu-204-100C and Tu-204-200C are cargo versions of the −100 and −200 respectively, fitted with a forward main deck freight door. Currently, the Tu-204-100/200 is offered with the option of an up-rated Aviadvigatel PS90A2 turbofan, which promises 40% more service between overhauls.

The Tu-204-100&#x27;s maximum take-off weight (MTOW) is 107.5 tonnes, and its range with 196 passengers in a two-class configuration is .
===Tu-204-120/220/120C/220C===
To broaden product appeal, the Tu-204-120/220 offers non-Russian avionics and engines. It is powered by two Rolls-Royce RB211-535 engines, each with thrust of 192 kN (43,100 lbf). Egypt&#x27;s Cairo Aviation became the debut operator in November 1998 when it took delivery of a Tu-204-120 and its cargo version the Tu-204-120C. The Tu-204-220 and Tu-204-220C cargo version, are a higher gross weight variants of the basic Tu-204-120.

The Tu-204-120 has a maximum takeoff weight of 103 metric tons and a range of with 196 passengers in a two-class seating configuration.

===Tu-204-300===

A shortened, longer-range and more efficient derivative of the Tu-204, the Tu-204-300 is also known as Tu-234. About six meters (20 ft) shorter than the basic Tu-204, this variant is available in two versions: the longer-ranged, heavier version, powered by Aviadvigatel PS-90A2 turbofans, has a maximum take-off weight of 107.5 metric tons and range (with 166 passengers) increased to ; and the lighter, shorter-ranged version, with a maximum take-off weight of 89 metric tons and range of with 166 passengers. The former Russian airline Vladivostok Air was the debut customer. This airline&#x27;s aircraft are in a two-class seating configuration, with a 142-passenger capacity. Average numbers of flight hours during each 24-hour period is 9.35 hours, for year 2009. It is also operated by Air Koryo which currently operates one Tu-204-100B and one Tu-204-300. The Тu-204s operate on the Pyongyang-Beijing, Bangkok, Vladivostok, Shenyang and Kuala Lumpur routes.

===Tu-204-500===
This is a version of the Tu-204-300 optimized for shorter routes, featuring smaller wings and an increased cruising speed (to Mach 0.84), which makes it a competitor to the Next Generation Boeing 737. It is ETOPS rated, and fitted with a Honeywell 331-200ER APU.

===Tu-206===

The Tu-206 is a company-funded concept aircraft that, if built, would be used as a testbed for alternative fuels, specifically liquefied natural gas.

===Tu-204SM===
The Tu-204SM, alternatively Tu-204CM, a medium-range airliner, is an upgraded version of the Tu-204-100/300. While the Tu-204SM will retain key design and aerodynamic features of the Tu-204-100/100E/100V series, there are numerous upgrades, largely aimed at meeting the current and near-future Russian and international standards, including those of ICAO and Eurocontrol.

The new cockpit features allow the Tu-204SM to be flown by a two-pilot crew (as compared with the three-pilot arrangement of the original Tu-204 series). These features include a new computer (VSUPT-85-2040), a new flight management system (ASO-204/FMS), wide LCD displays (KSEIS-204E), head-up displays (HUD), and an automated board system maintenance and diagnostic system. The electronic flight bag concept will be implemented and all controls and displays will be in English.

The Tu-204SM will be powered by two PS-90A2 engines. The latter is significantly improved over the original PS-90A power plants. and features a unified twin-spool turbofan with a high bypass ratio. The PS-90A2 is expected a life cycle cost saving of 35% over the original engine with a simultaneous increase in reliability in the 50 to 100% range. The PS-90A2 is designed to meet the Russian AP-33 aviation standard, which is harmonized with the US FAR Part 33 and the European JAR33.

There will also be a new APU (TA-18 APU-200) and upgraded fuel management, hydraulic and fire safety systems.

The updated passenger cabin accommodates a maximum of 210 passengers or 174 in a typical two-class layout.
The upgrades include new larger storage bins, multicolored LED lighting, sound-absorbing structures and a modern in-flight entertainment system (IFE).

The price for one Tu-204SM is estimated at USD 40–47 million.

The first test flight of Tu-204SM was successfully carried out on 29 December 2010. First deliveries of Tu-204SM were originally planned for 2011. As of December 2019, no Tu-204SM aircraft have been delivered and the project likely will never see fruition.

====Tu-204SM orders====
Red Wings Airlines was the first airline to order the Tu-204SM. Ilyushin Finance Co. (IFC) said it would complete negotiations with Red Wings for 44 Tu-204SM aircraft in February, to sign a firm order in March 2011. Red Wings already operates a fleet of Tu-204-100 and Tu-204-100V jetliners, to which it added one airframe in 2010.
Russia&#x27;s largest aircraft lessor, Ilyushin Finance, has previously placed Tu-204-100 aircraft with Cubana, Air Koryo and Red Wings, and Tu-204-300s with Vladivostok Avia and Air Koryo. Faced with low production rates for the Tu-204 models, Tupolev asked component providers to lower their prices in order to cut the plane&#x27;s overall price by 27–30%. These suppliers agreed, on condition that 44 more firm orders be secured for the Tu-204SM through 2016.

By January 2012 a firm order from Red Wings had not been signed, the stumbling blocks being requests for guarantees of the residual value of the airframes and after-sales support at a cost the same as an equivalent Airbus or Boeing model. It was subsequently announced that Red Wings had cut back its initial commitment from 44 to 15 Tu-204SMs due to delays to the flight-test programme and after the lessor Ilyushin Finance reportedly &quot;lost interest&quot;.

A large order by Iran Air Tours is under threat because of sanctions against the Iranian economy, as the American company Pratt &amp; Whitney has been involved in the development of the engine with the Perm Engine Company. Completing the sale by re-equipping the Tu-204SMs with the Tu-204&#x27;s Russian-made PS-90A engines has been proposed.

At the Singapore Air Show in 2016 the Vice President of the Russian United Aircraft Corporation stated that every company that has ordered the Tu-204 has gone bankrupt so there were no outstanding orders for the Tu-204SM, and Tupolev has frozen development work on the aircraft and UAC would withdraw it from their list of aircraft prices as soon as the Irkut MC-21 comes to the market.

==Tu-214 variants==
===Tu-214===
The Tu-214 is also a variation of the Tu-204 first flown on 21 March 1996. It is technically a Tu-204-200, one of the differences being that it is built by a different factory. Planes designated Tu-204 are produced in Ulyanovsk by Aviastar-SP; Tu-214 in Kazan by the Kazan Aircraft Production Association (KAPO). Both factories are independent from the Tupolev design bureau and have some control over the design of the variant they produce.

The main difference is a full-size main door at the left side of the fuselage just before the wing. The Tu-204 has two main doors and two emergency doors; the Tu-214 has three doors and one emergency door.

The Tu-214 is essentially a higher gross weight variant of the Tu-204, being fitted with extra fuel tanks and structural adjustments to deal with the heavier gross weight. For this reason, the Russian government prefers to use it as the platform upon which all further modifications for the &#x27;Special Mission&#x27; variants will be based. Some of the special mission variants are claimed to be capable of a non-stop 10,000-kilometre flight range.

As of July 2018, a total of three Tupolev Tu-214 aircraft were in airline service with Rossiya.

In March 2022, CEO of Rostec Sergey Chemezov declared a possibility to relaunch big production of Tu-214 due to International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War. On 6 April 2022, Yuri Slusar announced the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) had already started production of 20 Tu-214s to replace Russia&#x27;s fleet of Boeing and Airbus passenger aircraft.

On 16 August 2022, United Aircraft Corporation announced plans to increase Tupolev Tu-214 production to at least 10 to 12 aircraft per year, with the aim to produce 70 Tupolev Tu-214 by 2030. It was said the first Tu-214 for commercial flights expected to appear in 2024, then delayed to 2025, but later that year in November, a 100% Russian-made prototype had its maiden flight as a testbed.

====Tu-214ON====

The Tu-214ON is an observation version of the Tu-204-200, equipped for Treaty on Open Skies missions and built by Kazan Aircraft Production Association. Vega Radio Engineering Corporation was contracted for the development of airborne surveillance system, ground-based complex and other mission equipment for the aircraft. It is equipped with one A-84ON panoramic camera, one AK-111 topographic camera and two perspective AK-112 digital aerial cameras to capture high-resolution aerial photography. Two video cameras, a Raduga infrared thermographic camera and Ronsard Side looking airborne radar are also fitted.

The first Tu-214ON (RA-64519) was demonstrated at the MAKS-2011 international air show in Moscow. It performed its first test flight on 1 June 2011, which was followed by a series of 24 flights by December 2011. The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation conducted state tests to verify the air and ground equipment of the Tu-214ON aircraft in April 2013. The jet was delivered to the Russian Defence Ministry on 22 August 2013. The second airliner (RA-64525) made its first flight on 18 December 2013 and was delivered on 4 July 2014. The Tu-214ON is set to replace the Tupolev Tu-154 and Antonov An-30 aircraft in the role.

After Russia withdrew from the Treaty on Open Skies in 2021, the two Tu-214ON used for treaty observation missions have been used for military observation flights in Crimea.

====Tu-214PU====
Airborne command post version. Six operated for the Russian President.
====Tu-214SR====
Communications relay version. Five operated by Special Flight Unit Rossiya for the Russian government.

====Tu-214SUS====
Communications relay version for the Russian President. Two delivered.

====Tu-214R====
Special-mission versions of the Tu-214 commercial transport aircraft, developed under the codename &#x27;Project 141&#x27;, to replace the Il-20 ELINT platform. The aircraft are configured to carry the MRC-411 multi-intelligence payload, to include electronic intelligence (ELINT) sensors, side-looking Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and other Signals Intelligence (SIGINT). In addition, the aircraft will carry multi-spectral electro-optical systems. The aircraft has conducted test flights over the Sea of Japan but the programme experienced problems in January 2013. (Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly 16 January 2013)The Tu-214R made its public debut in August 2013 at Moscow Air Show MAKS and was heralded as a platform for conducting surveillance of the U.S., in accordance with the Treaty on Open Skies, to monitor compliance with the relevant treaties.

As of January 2015, two were conducting test flights with the Russian Air Force.

In February 2016, Russia was reported to have deployed one Tu-214R to its base in Latakia, Syria.

In July 2016, two flights have been reported to have been conducted near the Latvian, Estonian and Finnish borders, with the plane (registry reported as RA-64514) conducting close approaches a few dozen kilometers of the Finnish border on 5 and 7 July.

After Syria operation, the aircraft was declared combat-ready. One plane was reportedly used against Ukraine in 2022.

====Tu-214PU-SBUS====
Special-purpose aircraft-control point equipped with a special onboard communication unit SBUS-214 intended for the Ministry of Defence of Russia. The aircraft is built with Russian-made components only, meeting the requirements of the state customers, and has a range of at least . The main purpose of the aircraft is to provide additional communication capabilities to the user. The Russian MoD placed an order for two aircraft in November 2015. The first aircraft was delivered in March 2018, the second in June the same year.

====Tu-214LMK====
A flying laboratory based on a serial Tu-214 passenger plane (registration number RA-64507) equipped with a multifunctional flight complex LMK-214. The aircraft is intended for in-flight testing of a new radar complex and other on-board aviation equipment for the modernized Tupolev Tu-160M2 and the future Tupolev PAK DA strategic bombers. It began flight testing on 29 December 2018.

==Operators==


As of July 2018, there are 14 aircraft in commercial service. Total users as of August 2024 include:
As is common with post-Soviet Russian aircraft, the Tupolev is a relatively rare aircraft, with only 86 examples being built as of December 2019. However, because of the 2022 sanctions, Russia aims to build at least 10 jets per year to replace its fleets.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On 14 January 2002, Siberia Airlines Flight 852, a Tupolev Tu-204-100 (RA-64011), experienced a flameout of both engines, glided and overran the runway at Omsk Airport and sustained minor damage, but was repaired and returned to service. The aircraft was later written off in a 2010 accident.
*On 22 March 2010, Aviastar-TU Flight 1906, the same aircraft involved in the Siberia Airlines Flight 852 incident, crash-landed short of the runway near Moscow Domodedovo Airport while attempting to land at night in fog and poor visibility. There were no fatalities, but four of the eight crew members were seriously injured. It was a repositioning flight with no passengers on board. In September 2010, the МАК released their final report into the accident. The cause of the accident was attributed to pilot error, with a number of factors contributing to the accident including inadequate crew training and lack of cockpit resource management, failure of autoflight systems and serious regulatory violations by Aviastar-TU. This accident was the first hull-loss of the Tu-204.
* On 29 December 2012 at 16:35 local time (12:35 GMT), Red Wings Airlines Flight 9268 crashed on landing after overrunning runway 19 at Moscow Vnukovo International Airport (VKO) following a non-revenue repositioning flight originating from Pardubice Airport, Czech Republic. The aircraft collided with an elevated highway, which launched debris at moving cars. It came to a stop past the runway&#x27;s end. There were eight crew members on board of whom five were killed and the other four seriously injured. Apart from those, one person who was driving his car on the highway was seriously injured from the nose wheel that flew across the highway. The driver behind him recorded the impact on camera. The fatal Vnukovo accident was the second runway overrun incident involving a Red Wings operated Tu-204 in nine days following a Moscow Vnukovo to Novosibirsk flight on 20 December 2012 that overran runway 25 at Tolmachevo Airport by into an open field. Flight data recorder readouts indicate that brake failure as well as engine thrust reverser issues were major contributing causes in both overruns resulting in the issuance of additional airworthiness directives. This accident remains the sole fatal accident involving the Tu-204.
*On 24 August 2016, Aviastar-TU Flight 9625, a Tu-204S (RA-64021), was written off after landing hard at Norilsk Airport when it bounced on landing; when the aircraft taxied to its parking position, severe damage was found on the rear spar of the wing.
*On 22 August 2018, one of the Aviadvigatel PS-90 engines on Red Wings Flight 808, a Tu-204-100 (RA-64050), from Ufa to Sochi experienced an engine surge during takeoff from Ufa International Airport and subsequently caught fire. The crew did not receive any fire indications, the automatic fire suppression system did not work, and the manual fire suppression failed to fully extinguish the flames. Emergency services had put out the fire after landing while the passengers were safely evacuated through the right hand (emergency) doors via slides. There were no injuries. A Rosaviatsia (Russia&#x27;s Civil Aviation Authority) commission was set up to investigate the occurrence.
*On 8 January 2022, Aviastar-TU Flight 6534, operating for Cainiao, a Chinese marketing program ran by Allibaba, had severely burned out following a cargo fire due to overheating lithium batteries. The aircraft was about to taxi, but the fire then started. This happened at Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport. The aircraft was undergoing a cargo service from Hangzhou to Novosibirsk. Luckily, there were no fatalities.

<text>The garden sunbird (Cinnyris jugularis), previously known as the olive-backed sunbird, is a species of passerine bird in the family Nectariniidae that is found in the Philippines except on the Palawan island group. It was formerly considered to be conspecific with seven other species: the ornate sunbird, Palawan sunbird, Sahul sunbird, Tukangbesi sunbird, Flores Sea sunbird, South Moluccan sunbird and the Mamberamo sunbird. 
It is a small, brightly coloured bird with olive-green plumage on the wings and back with a bright yellow chest. It has a long downward-curved bill it uses for taking nectar and capturing insects. It is primarily nectarivorous, but will take insects and spiders, particularly when feeding chicks.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the garden sunbird in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in the Philippines. He used the French name &quot;Le petit grimpereau des Philippines&quot; and the Latin &quot;Certhia Philippensis Minor&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the garden sunbird. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Certhia jugularis&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific name &quot;jugularis&quot; is Medieval Latin for &#x27;of the throat&#x27;. The garden sunbird is now one of 64 species placed in the genus &quot;Cinnyris&quot; that was introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1816.

The garden sunbird (under the name olive-backed sunbird) formerly included 21 subspecies and had a range that extended from Southeast Asia to Australia. Based on the difference in the male plumage and a genetic study comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences of some of the subspecies, the olive-backed sunbird was split into eight species. The seven new species are: ornate sunbird (&quot;Cinnyris ornatus&quot;), Palawan sunbird (&quot;Cinnyris aurora&quot;), Sahul sunbird (&quot;Cinnyris frenatus&quot;), Tukangbesi sunbird (&quot;Cinnyris infrenatus&quot;), Flores Sea sunbird (&quot;Cinnyris teysmanni&quot;), South Moluccan sunbird (&quot;Cinnyris clementiae&quot;) and Mamberamo sunbird (&quot;Cinnyris idenburgi&quot;).

Three subspecies are now recognised:
* &quot;C. j. obscurior&quot; Ogilvie-Grant, 1894 – north Luzon and Babuyan Islands in northern Philippines
* &quot;C. j. jugularis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – central, south Luzon group, Mindoro, Visayas and Mindanao group (north to south Philippines)
* &quot;C. j. woodi&quot; (Mearns, 1909) – Sulu Archipelago in southern Philippines

==Description==

The garden sunbird is in size; males weigh and females . The male in its nominate (&quot;jugularis&quot;) form displays an olive hue on its upper body, featuring black wing feathers with green edges and a black tail adorned with white tips. The areas around its eyes (lores), neck, chin, throat, and breast are dark and iridescent, accompanied by yellow pectoral tufts. The lower portion of the bird is dark yellow, sometimes with a brown band encircling the gorget area. The iris is dark brown, while its bill and legs are black. Non-breeding males often have the glossy black coloration limited to the central throat stripe, which may represent juvenile birds transitioning to their adult plumage.
In contrast, the female exhibits an upper body of greenish olive, featuring a pale-yellowish stripe above the eyes, yellowish borders on its wing feathers, a tail with black and white markings, and a deep yellow color on the lower portion of its body, slightly lighter on the undertail feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female but tend to be paler and browner in appearance.

==Distribution and habitat==

The garden sunbird is found on the Philippine islands except on the Palawan archipelago which is occupied by the similar Palawan sunbird. It inhabits forests, shrublands, grasslands and artificial habitats. The garden sunbird has adapted well to human environments and is common in fairly densely populated areas, where it builds nests in human settlements.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The female garden sunbird builds the nest using grass, cotton, moss, lichens, leaf fragments, vegetable fibers, and spider webs, lined with bark or feathers. The nest has the form of a hanging oval pouch with a sheltered side opening, often featuring a dangling &quot;beard.&quot; She lays eggs in May and June.
Sunbirds feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. Most species can take nectar by hovering, but usually perch to feed most of the time.

== Conservation ==
The garden sunbird has been classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List as it is common throughout its wide range.

<text>The San Miguel River is a tributary of the Dolores River, approximately long, in southwestern Colorado in the United States. It rises in the San Juan Mountains southeast of Telluride and flows northwest, along the southern slope of the Uncompahgre Plateau, past the towns of Placerville and Nucla and joins the Dolores in western Montrose County approximately 15 miles (24 km) east of the state line with Utah.

== Geography and protected areas ==
The San Miguel is more or less free-flowing; however, diversion dams dot the river and alter flows. In some parts it is however one of the few remaining naturally functioning rivers of the West.

The San Miguel varies in gradient, from extremely steep in its upper reaches (forming a shallow, rocky, unnavigable stream) to more mellow in the lower sections ( of drop, which offers the whitewater boater a variety of runs all within the class II+--III range). All told, the San Miguel drops over from an alpine ecosystem to the desert. The average flow is about .

More than 30 miles of the San Miguel are a protected area, as pats of the area were purchased by the ″Nature Conservancy Association″ in 1989.

The preserved zone hosts a riparian habitat, featuring the typical vegetation such as grey alders and narrowleaf cottonwood. The native fish include rather rare species such as cutthroat trout and the mottled sculpin. The River also features a 2,000 feet high, narrow canyon with walls of red-rock sandstone. American dippers have built their nests.
Bridal Veil Creek of Bridal Veil Falls and other creeks above Telluride join to form the river, which first flows to the west through Telluride. Other tributaries include the South Fork of the San Miguel River, which joins from the south and itself has various creeks and the Lake Fork of the San Miguel River as tributaries.

== Tourism ==
Whitewater kayakers and boaters enjoy many sections on the San Miguel. Minimum suggested flows for small vessels is 250 cfs, with the river near Placerville usually becoming navigable in late April or early May. Several runs of varying length are commonly undertaken from there to the confluence with the Dolores, near the site of Uravan. The San Miguel is considered a continuous class 2 run with several class three rapids which become more challenging at higher flows, where the river&#x27;s speed can make it difficult to stop and scout. Additional River hazards are three diversion dams that exist between Naturita and the Hwy 145 bridge East of Norwood. All of them are relatively easy to scout and portage, however. As the river meanders through an agricultural valley just east of Naturita, several cattle fences cross the river.

Other popular outdoor activities at San Miguel River include walking, hiking and fly fishing, for which the conditions are best from July to September.

<text>Manchester University (formerly Manchester College) is a private liberal arts university associated with the Church of the Brethren and two locations, a residential campus in North Manchester, Indiana, and a second location in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which hosts the university&#x27;s doctorate programs in pharmacy; master&#x27;s programs in pharmacogenomics, athletic training, and nutrition and nutrigenomics; and an accelerated second degree program in nursing. Total enrollment is approximately 1,200 students.

==History==
Manchester University (formerly Manchester College) was founded in Roanoke, Indiana, as the Roanoke Classical Seminary in 1860 by the United Brethren Church. David N. Howe served as the last president of Roanoke Classical Seminary, which was moved to North Manchester to become North Manchester [Manchester] College. He served as Manchester College&#x27;s first president from 1889 to 1894 and is known as the founder. The school was renamed Manchester College in 1889 when it moved to North Manchester. In 1932, Manchester merged with Mount Morris College of Mount Morris, Illinois, a Methodist seminary founded in 1839. Manchester is a college of the Church of the Brethren.

The Peace Studies Institute and Program for Conflict Resolution—the first undergraduate peace studies major in the U.S., was established at Manchester in 1948. The program was chaired by Kenneth Brown from 1980 until 2005.

The Manchester College Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

In 2012, Manchester changed its name from Manchester College to Manchester University to reflect the growing number of graduate programs offered. Manchester also expanded &amp; opened its second location featuring its state-of-the-art pharmacy school in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 2012. Manchester is the first university to offer a master&#x27;s degree program in pharmacogenomics.

==Academics==
Manchester University operates on a 4-1-4 (four month semester- January Session- four month semester) academic calendar in its College of Undergraduate Studies. Students working toward a bachelor&#x27;s degree can choose from seventy-eight major fields of study and thirty-four minor fields. Students working toward an associate degree can choose from two major fields of study. Manchester also offers master&#x27;s degrees in five fields of study and a doctorate degree in pharmacy.

===Accreditation===
Manchester University as a whole has been accredited by The Higher Learning Commission continuously since 1932 and was a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools prior to its dissolution in 2014.

===Department of History and Political Science===
The Department of History and Political Science is one of the oldest and most prestigious programs of study at Manchester, housing the Mock Trial and Model United Nations organizations. Well-known graduates include G. John Ikenberry, Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and co-faculty director of the Princeton Project on National Security; and Steven A. Shull, &#x27;65, university research professor at the University of New Orleans. Distinguished faculty have included Professor of Political Science Robert Johansen (Class of 1962; faculty 1967–74), founding Fellow of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame and president of the World Policy Institute (1978–1982); and Professor of Medieval History Andrew Cordier (Class of 1922; faculty 1926–1944), one of the co-founders of the United Nations and president of Columbia University (1968–1970).

Manchester benefited from Cordier&#x27;s faculty position as, through its relationship with him, Manchester also became the only college in the United States to hold NGO status with the United Nations, a distinction Manchester still holds. This has allowed the institution to attract a number of renowned public figures and policy makers to its campus, including Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King Jr., Barry Goldwater, Ralph Nader, and Jesse Jackson.

==Campus==
All students classified as first-years, sophomores, or juniors must live on campus unless they live within 40 miles of Manchester University with their parents or are married. There are no fraternities or sororities at Manchester, and the university is a partially dry campus with alcohol being permitted at certain events.

Manchester University has five residence halls:
*East Hall is a traditional-style hall that houses up to 224 men and women and is designated for first-year students.
*Garver Hall is a traditional-style hall houses up to 275 men and women with a majority of the hall being restricted to first-year students.
*Helman Hall is a suite-style hall that houses up to 129 men and women classified as sophomores, juniors, or seniors.
*Oakwood Hall is a suite-style hall that houses up to 129 men and women classified as sophomores, juniors, or seniors.
*Schwalm Hall take offline in 2021
*East Street Apartments houses students classified as sophomores, juniors, or seniors, with priority given to seniors.

Students in their senior year are permitted to live off campus, and often live in named, themed houses that may persist through several years of occupants.

Manchester also offers more than thirty student clubs and organizations.

===Service===
In 2012–13, Manchester students contributed over 47,000 hours of community service, earning the university a spot on the president&#x27;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for the fifth-straight year. The university&#x27;s chapter of Indiana Reading Corps is one of the largest in the state, logging more than 3,000 hours tutoring elementary school children. Habitat for Humanity also is a major recipient of campus service.

Washington Monthly magazine ranks Manchester 14th among the nation&#x27;s baccalaureate colleges for its “contribution to the public good.”

===Buildings===
The university president&#x27;s residence, named Tall Oaks, is located on the North end of campus and is passed on from president to president.

The principal nonresidential buildings on the campus of Manchester University are:
*Science Center
*Funderburg Library
*Cunningham Academic Center
*Clark Computer Center
*Otho Winger Memorial Hall

*Jean Childs Young Intercultural Center and Toyota Round

Note: The Academic Center is a renovation of the former Holl-Kintner Hall, and contains classrooms, faculty offices and an admissions Welcome Center.

Note: The Administration Building was razed in 2022.

==Athletics==
Manchester University teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III.

<text>The Little Snake River is a tributary of the Yampa River, approximately long, in southwestern Wyoming and northwestern Colorado in the United States.

It rises near the continental divide, in Routt National Forest in northern Routt County, Colorado, along the northern edge of the Park Range. It flows west along the Wyoming-Colorado state line, meandering across the border several times and flowing past the Wyoming towns of Dixon and Baggs. It turns southwest and flows through Moffat County, Colorado, joining the Yampa approximately 45 mi (72 km) west of Craig, just east of Dinosaur National Monument. The Little Snake is not generally navigable except seasonally in years of plentiful water.

She was the first woman to produce and distribute animated films. Winkler was the subject of the feature film &quot;Walt Before Mickey&quot;.

== Early life and career ==
Hungarian-born of German descent, Winkler began her career as the personal secretary of Harry Warner, one of the founders of Warner Brothers. Through most of the silent era, Warner Brothers was strictly a film distributor, and Harry Warner was the man who made the deals. In 1917, Warner Brothers began distributing cartoons of &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; in New York and New Jersey. Warner was impressed with Winkler&#x27;s talents.

In 1921, Winkler founded M.J. Winkler Pictures (later Screen Gems) and signed a contract with Pat Sullivan Productions to produce &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; cartoons. The following year she signed another contract to distribute for Fleischer Studios on the &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; series. This established her reputation as the top distributor in the cartoon world. It was a good thing, because at the end of the same year the Fleischer brothers, flush with success as a result of Winkler&#x27;s work, left her to form their own distribution company, Red Seal Pictures. However much Sullivan helped Winkler&#x27;s business, he and Winkler were constantly fighting. In September 1923, the renewal of his contract came up, and his unrealistic demands meant M.J. Winkler Pictures might have to survive for a while without its biggest star. Winkler viewed a pilot reel, called &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot; (1923), submitted by then neophyte animator Walt Disney, the first entry in the &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; series. Winkler was intrigued with the idea of a live-action girl in a cartoon world, and signed Disney to a year-long contract despite the fact that Laugh-O-Gram Studio, the studio that made the cartoon, was now bankrupt.
Disney subsequently formed a new studio, Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, which was the first cartoon studio in Hollywood and eventually changed its name to Walt Disney Productions. Disney was helped by the tutelage of Winkler, who insisted on editing all of the &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; episodes herself. One of her suggestions was the addition of a suspiciously Felix-like character called Julius. This was apparently the &quot;straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back&quot; for Sullivan, who signed with rival distributor E. W. Hammons of Educational Pictures in 1925.

Winkler was the first female member of the Motion Picture Producer&#x27;s Guild. To disguise her gender, she would sign letters &quot;M.J. Winkler.&quot;

== Marriage ==
In 1924, she married Charles B. Mintz, a film distributor who had been working for her since 1922. Soon after she had her first child and retired from the business, turning her company over to her husband who renamed it Winkler Productions in 1926. The couple had two children, Katherine and William. The company was eventually renamed Screen Gems.

== Death ==
Winkler died on June 21, 1990, in Mamaroneck, New York. She was 95 years old.

<text>Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport at Keāhole is the primary airport on the Island of Hawaiʻi, located in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, United States. The airport serves leeward (western) Hawaiʻi island, including the resorts in North Kona and South Kohala. It is one of two international airports serving Hawaiʻi island, the other being Hilo International Airport on the windward (eastern) side.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025, in which it is categorized as a small-hub primary commercial service facility.

== History ==

=== Construction ===
Much of the runway is built on a relatively recent lava flow: the 1801 &quot;Huʻehuʻe&quot; flow from Hualālai. This flow extended the shoreline out an estimated , adding some of land to the island and creating Keāhole Point. The airport opened on July 1, 1970, with a single runway; the previous smaller airstrip was converted into the Old Kona Airport State Recreation Area.

Construction crews from Bechtel Corporation used three million pounds of dynamite to flatten the lava tube riddled lava flow within 13 months.

In its first full year, 515,378 passengers passed through the new open-air tropical-style terminals.

=== Naming ===
The airport has had several names over its lifetime.

At the time of its opening in 1970, it was named the Ke-āhole Airport, after its geographical location, Keāhole Point, itself named after the ʻāhole fish found in the area.

In 1993, the airport was renamed Keāhole-Kona International Airport, after the nearby resort town of Kona. In 1997, the Kona name was further emphasized when the airport was renamed the Kona International Airport at Keāhole. 

On January 8, 2017, the airport was renamed Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport at Keāhole to honor astronaut Ellison Onizuka who was born and raised in Kona and died in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.

=== Impact ===
Prior to the construction of the new airport in 1970, tourism was centered on the town of Hilo on the eastern side of the Big Island. Tourists to Kona and the western side of the island typically flew into the Hilo Airport and had to make nearly two hour drive across the island. The lack of a major airport became especially problematic as large resorts started opening in Kona around 1968.

When the airport opened, it helped accelerate a shift of tourism from East Hawaii to West Hawaii. Tourism in Hilo had already taken a hit when a tsunami destroyed all seaside hotels in 1960.

The full extent of the airport&#x27;s impact and shift in tourism can be seen in Hawaii Island Strategic Plan for 2006 to 2015. By 2005 the percentage of accommodations on the west side of the island increased to 86% of the total. In 2005, just four modest hotels continued to serve the east side of the Big Island, with three of them dating back to the 1960s.

Tourism has helped fuel Hawaii County&#x27;s overall population growth. Between 1990 and 2010, the population increased 48%.

=== Expansion ===
Aloha Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines were the primary air carriers during the early and mid-1970s for inter-island flights from Honolulu on Oahu, Kahului on Maui and Lihue on Kauai with Aloha operating Boeing 737-200 jets and Hawaiian operating McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jets at this time. In the late 1970s, Hawaiian operated larger McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50 jets on its inter-island flights.

By early 1985, United Airlines was operating nonstop service into the airport from both Los Angeles and San Francisco with Douglas DC-8-71 and wide-body McDonnell Douglas DC-10 jetliners.

In 1991, a small museum, the Astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka Space Center opened at the airport. The displays included a sample of lunar soil, a spacesuit from Apollo 13, and personal items from Onizuka.

In 1994, the airport&#x27;s runway was extended to , the second-longest in the Hawaiian Islands after Honolulu. The longer runways enabled much larger aircraft to use the airport, enabling nonstop flights between Kona and Tokyo or destinations in the United States beyond the West Coast hubs.

Japan Airlines (JAL) started a Kona-Tokyo flight in 1996. The route was suspended between 2010 and September 2017 leaving the island with only one scheduled international flight (to Vancouver) for a time. Hawaiian Airlines filed an application with the US Department of Transportation (USDOT) for nonstop flights from Kona to Tokyo&#x27;s Haneda Airport, to restore the link between the two cities after JAL ended flights to Narita Airport in 2010. The USDOT rejected the airline&#x27;s application in favor of Delta&#x27;s Seattle to Haneda flights despite support from residents of west Hawaii. On October 23, 2013, Hawaiian Airlines announced that they would re-apply to the USDOT for nonstop Kona-Haneda flights a year after their application to fly that route was rejected. On July 8, 2016, Hawaiian Airlines announced that nonstop Kona-Haneda flights would begin on December 20, 2016, after the USDOT awarded them the route in May. JAL&#x27;s resumption of daily Tokyo service in 2017 generated 900 jobs and $8.58 million in tax revenue for the Big Island during its first year, according to the Hawaiian Tourism Authority. Tokyo service on both Hawaiian and JAL was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which time a new international arrivals facility was built at Kona; JAL resumed its Narita-Kona route in August 2022.

A modernization project started in March 2017 to combine the airport&#x27;s two separate terminals into one terminal area. The program allowed the airport to have one, central security screening area and also allowed passengers to use the shopping and dining areas in either terminal. To enable the expansion, the Onizuka Space Center was closed in March 2016, and the airport was renamed after Onizuka in January 2017.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport at Keāhole covers at an elevation of 47 feet (14 m) above mean sea level. It has one asphalt runway, 17/35, 7,000 by 150 feet (2,134 x 46 m).

In the year ending November 30, 2021, the airport had 87,770 aircraft operations, an average of 240 per day: 51% general aviation, 30% scheduled commercial, 12% air taxi and 7% military. In March 2022, there were 56 aircraft based at this airport; 26 single-engine, 8 multi-engine, 18 helicopters and 4 ultralights.

=== Passenger terminal ===
The state government of Hawaiʻi facility operates a runway and a terminal complex of single-story buildings along the eastern edge of the airfield for passengers, air cargo and mail, airport support, and general aviation. Airport operations fall under the State of Hawaii Department of Transportation.

The commercial passenger facility is a set of rambling, open-air, tropical-style structures, divided into three terminals: Terminal 1 includes gates 1 through 5, Terminal 2 includes gates 6 through 10, and Terminal 3 hosts smaller commuter flights. Kona International is the only remaining major airport in the Hawaiian Islands where passengers board using mobile stairs or ramps, instead of more modern jet bridges. Despite the less modern facilities, Kona is used by large airliners including the Airbus A321 and A330 along with the Boeing 717, 737, 757, 767, 777, and 787.

* On August 25, 1977, an Air Cargo Hawaii twin-turboprop Short SC.7 Skyvan crashed and burned while attempting to land at Keahole Airport. The pilot and passenger were killed. The crash occurred about short of the runway.
* On September 10, 1989, the pilot of an Aero Commander 680 was making an emergency landing on runway 17 due to loss of power in the right engine. He crashed about southwest of the runway, resulting in one fatality and one serious injury.
* On June 21, 2022, a Rockwell Commander 114 suffered a landing gear failure while landing at the airport. As a result the runway was blocked for 3 hours, and some inbound flights were diverted. The lone pilot was not injured.
* On January 16, 2024, cracks found in the runway forced the airport to temporarily close. The airport reopened the following morning after repairs were completed overnight.

<doc id="512378" wikidata="Q2525280" url="?curid=512378" title="The Black Book of Soviet Jewry">
<text>The Black Book of Soviet Jewry or simply The Black Book (; , &quot;Dos shvartse bukh&quot;), also known as The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry, is a 500-page document compiled for publication by Ilya Ehrenburg and Vasily Grossman originally in late 1944 in the Russian language. It was a result of the collaborative effort by the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC) and members of the American Jewish community to document the anti-Jewish crimes of the Holocaust and the participation of Jews in the resistance movement against the Nazis during World War II. The 1991 Kyiv edition of &quot;The Black Book&quot; was subtitled &quot;The Ruthless Murder of Jews by German-Fascist Invaders Throughout the Temporarily-Occupied Regions of the Soviet Union and in the German Nazi Death Camps established on occupied Polish soil during the War 1941–1945&quot;.

The book was not allowed to be published in the Soviet Union upon the conclusion of the war. Its insistence on the uniqueness of Jewish suffering – above and beyond the rest of Soviet citizenry – was denounced by the Central Committee as anti-Soviet.

==Background==
Prominent Jewish Soviet writers and journalists Ilya Ehrenburg and Vasily Grossman served as war reporters for the Red Army. Grossman&#x27;s documentary reports of the opening of the Treblinka and Majdanek extermination camps were some of the first eyewitness accounts — as early as 1943 — of what later became known as the Holocaust. His article &quot;The Treblinka Hell&quot; was disseminated at the Nuremberg trials as a document for the prosecution.

==Manuscripts and publications==
In 1944–1945, based on their own experiences and on other documents they collected, Ehrenburg and Grossman produced two volumes under the title &quot;Murder of the People&quot; in Yiddish and handed the manuscript to the JAC. Copies were sent to the United States, the British mandate of Palestine (now Israel) and Romania in 1946, and excerpts were published in the United States in English under the title &quot;Black Book&quot; that same year. In Romania, a part of the manuscript was also published in 1946.
It was also printed in Israel. A handwritten manuscript of the book is held at Yad Vashem.

==The fate of the Black Book in the USSR==
According to Ehrenburg, the mandatory State literary commission did not commit to publish the book in October 1944: &quot;Instead of a straight answer, the resolution was:
The book was partially printed in the Soviet Union by the Yiddish publisher &quot;Der Emes&quot;; however, the entire edition, the typefaces, as well as the manuscript, were destroyed. First the censors ordered changes in the text to conceal the specifically anti-Jewish character of the atrocities and to downplay the role of some Ukrainians who worked as Nazi police officers. In 1948 the Soviet edition of the book was scrapped completely. The collection of original documents that Ehrenburg handed down to the Vilnius Jewish Museum after the war was secretly returned to him upon the Museum&#x27;s termination in 1948. The JAC was also disbanded, its members purged at the outset of the state campaign against the &quot;rootless cosmopolitans&quot;, a Soviet euphemism for Jews. (See also the Doctors&#x27; plot.)

Typically, the official Soviet policy regarding the Holocaust was to present it as atrocities committed against Soviet citizens, without specifically acknowledging the genocide of the Jews.

A Russian-language edition of the &quot;Black Book&quot; was published in Jerusalem in 1980, and finally in Kyiv, Ukraine in 1991.

The new Russian-language edition of the &quot;Black Book&quot; was published in 2014 by Editions Corpus with the help of Planeta.ru, a Russian crowdfunding site.

<text>Pinus virginiana, the Virginia pine, scrub pine, Jersey pine, possum pine, is a medium-sized tree, often found on poorer soils from Long Island in southern New York south through the Appalachian Mountains to western Tennessee and Alabama. The usual size range for this pine is 9–18 m, (18–59 feet) but can grow larger under optimum conditions. The trunk can be as large as 20 inches diameter. This tree prefers well-drained loam or clay, but will also grow on very poor, sandy soil, where it remains small and stunted. The typical life span is 65 to 90 years.

The short (4–8 cm), yellow-green needles are paired in fascicles and are often twisted. Pinecones are 4–7 cm long and may persist on the tree for many years, often (though not always) releasing their seeds in the second year. In growth habit, some trees may be inclined with twisted trunks.

This pine is useful for reforesting and provides nourishment for wildlife. Its other main use is on Christmas tree farms, despite having sharp-tipped needles and yellowish winter color. It also can provide wood pulp and lumber. Like some other southern yellow pines, Virginia pine lumber case hardens. That is, it becomes very hard over time during wood drying. Wood from Virginia pine is not normally considered to resist rot unless treated with preservatives.

== Description ==
&quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; is endemic to the United States and can be identified by a key characteristic; the relatively short needles are twisted and come in bunches of two. The needles are typically two to eight centimeters in length. There is hair on the bracts and on the bud scales of the &quot;P. virginiana&quot;. The leaf sheath of the &quot;P. virginiana&quot; is greater than 2.5 millimeters long. The cones of the &quot;P. virginiana&quot; only open after they are mature. The branches of the &quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; are flexible. They will bend when pressure is added to them. &quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; are between 9 and 18 meters tall. The bark of &quot;P. virginiana&quot; is red and brown in color, and also has the tendency to be rough with relatively small bark scales. The pollen cones are circular, almost elliptical and are 10–20 millimeters in size. They are the same color as the bark, typically. Seed cones are spread throughout the tree. The mature seed cones (4–7 cm) are much larger than the pollen cones. The &quot;P. virginiana&quot; prefers to grow in poor soils and dry loam or clay. They can grow on sandy soil, but this usually causes the tree to be smaller than the average &quot;P. virginiana&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; is in the family Pinaceae and the order Pinales. A molecular phylogeny indicates that the sister taxa to &quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; are &quot;Pinus clausa&quot;, &quot;Pinus contorta&quot;, and &quot;Pinus banksiana&quot;. &quot;Pinus banksiana&quot; has shorter needles than &quot;P. viginiana&quot; at 2–3.5 centimeters in length, whereas &quot;P. virginiana&quot; is 2–8 centimeters in length. &quot;P. banksiana&quot; needles are not twisted, but curved, and has cones that are serotinous and unarmed. The leaf sheaths in &quot;P. banksiana&quot; are less than 2.5 millimeters long. In &quot;P. virginiana&quot; the needles are twisted and straight. The cones open at maturity, are not serotinous and the scales on the cones have prominent prickles. The sheaths of the &quot;P. virginiana&quot; are greater than 2.5 millimeters long. &quot;Pinus clausa&quot; has larger needles than the &quot;P. virginiana.&quot; The &quot;Pinus clausa&quot; has needles that are between 5 and 13 centimeters long, &quot;P. virginiana&quot; has needles that range between 2 and 8 centimeters long. &quot;Pinus clausa&quot; is also serotinous. Lastly, &quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; and &quot;Pinus contorta&quot; are distributed differently: &quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; are found on the eastern side of the United States, whereas &quot;Pinus contorta&quot; are found on the western side. A similarity between &quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; and &quot;Pinus contorta&quot; is that the needles of both species are twisted.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; inhabit dry forested areas. The tree occurs in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Indiana, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware. In locations where the &quot;P. virginiana&quot; lives, rainfall is typically between 890 and 1400 millimeters. The average temperatures in the summer are between 21–24 degrees Celsius and in the winter it is around −4 to 4 degrees Celsius. &quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; is poorly adapted to fire, but if the tree is larger they are able to survive. Open growth Virginia pines may begin cone production at only 5 years old. There have been documented cases of trees as young as 18 months beginning to flower. Virginia pine is monecious and some self-pollination is possible, but a significant seed crop requires two trees. Cones take two complete growing seasons to develop. Pollination takes place 13 months after cone formation begins, and dispersal occurs the following autumn. Unlike some other pines, Virginia pine produces cones in all parts of the canopy.
&quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; is reportedly naturalized in southern Ontario 

== Ethnobotany ==
Cherokee Native Americans used &quot;P. virginiana&quot; medicinally for a variety of purposes. Diarrhea, stiffness of the body, colds, fevers, hemorrhoids, tuberculosis, and constipation, among others, are all ailments treated with parts of the tree. Cherokee also used it in certain cultural rituals. In burial, &quot;P. virginiana&quot; branches were burned and the ashes were used for a fire in their homes. Ball players would consume apple juice infused with &quot;P. virginiana&quot; needles &quot;for wind&quot; prior to events. Root infusions from the plant may be used as a stimulant and the needles as a soap.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the &quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; is as follows: &quot;Pinus&quot; is Latin for Pine and &quot;virginiana&quot; means of Virginia.

== Uses ==
&quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; was used historically as mine timbers, for railroad ties, and for fuel and tar. Currently, it is being planted as in reclamation sites for coal mining operations. &quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; can also be used for wood pulp, which is used to make paper, and for lumber. The wood weighs 32 pounds (14 kg) per foot.

== Conservation ==
On the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the &quot;Pinus virginiana&quot; is considered a species that is of least concern. It is a species of least concern due to relative commonness as an early successional species. In areas of abandoned farmland in the eastern US, &quot;P. virginiana&quot; tends to be common.

<text>These are the &quot;Billboard&quot; [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] number-one hits of 1985. The two longest running number-one singles of 1985 are &quot;We Are the World&quot; by USA for Africa and &quot;Say You, Say Me&quot; by Lionel Richie which each logged four weeks at number-one. &quot;Say You, Say Me&quot; logged two weeks at number-one in 1985 and two more additional weeks in 1986, reaching a total of four. &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; by Madonna concluded a six-week run that started in 1984.

That year, 17 acts first hit number one, such as Foreigner, USA for Africa, Simple Minds, Tears for Fears, Bryan Adams, Paul Young, Huey Lewis and the News, John Parr, Dire Straits, Ready for the World, a-ha, Whitney Houston, Jan Hammer, Starship, Marilyn Martin, and Mr. Mister. George Michael, having already hit number one with Wham!, also earns his first number one song as a solo act. Madonna, Wham!, Phil Collins, and Tears for Fears were the only acts to have more than one song reach number one, with Phil Collins having the most with three, while the others have two. 

This was also a record year for British acts with 13 hits reaching the top spot. As of 2022 this record remains unbroken.

<text>&quot;Azati Prime&quot; is the eighteenth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, the 70th overall. The episode was written by Manny Coto from a story developed by Coto, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. It was directed by Allan Kroeker, his second of the season. The episode featured several guest actors, including those playing members of the Xindi Council, as well as Matt Winston who reprised his role of Temporal Agent Daniels for the second time this season.

Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, registration NX-01. Season three of &quot;Enterprise&quot; features an ongoing story following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the Xindi. In this episode, the crew track a Xindi superweapon down to a planet and Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) seeks to destroy the weapon in a suicide attack. He is captured, and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is seriously damaged after an attack by four Xindi vessels.

The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-J appeared in this episode, based on designs by Doug Drexler. The ship was from 400 years in the future from the timeframe that the series is set in, and the bridge set was created mostly using green screen. John Eaves also created several designs of aquatic Xindi vessels for this episode. &quot;Azati Prime&quot; received Nielsen ratings of 2.6/4 percent. Critical reaction was mostly positive, with praise directed at the pacing of the episode and the plotting of the overall arc.

==Plot==
&quot;Enterprise&quot; approaches Azati Prime where the Xindi are constructing their super weapon. Captain Archer sends Commander Tucker and Ensign Mayweather on board the Xindi shuttle they had captured, to investigate the planet. Working their way past security, they approach the weapon, which is being built underwater. Archer orders &quot;Enterprise&quot; to destroy a Xindi detection facility on the planet&#x27;s moon to prevent it from signalling the ship&#x27;s presence. The shuttle returns with scans of the weapon and Archer decides to pilot a suicide mission to destroy it. The crew try to talk him out of it but he is resolute.

Archer then finds himself 400 years in the future on board the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-J, alongside Temporal Agent Daniels. They are at the battle where the Sphere Builders are defeated by the Federation, preventing an invasion. The builders have the technology to view alternate timelines, and have been manipulating the Xindi to prevent the Federation from forming. Daniels gives Archer an initiation medal from a Xindi who had joined Starfleet as temporal evidence. Back on his &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Archer rejects the notion of a Human–Xindi détente and leaves on the shuttle. He arrives at the super weapon construction site but finds the weapon is gone, and is rapidly captured by the Xindi Commander Dolim.

The Reptilians begin to interrogate Archer, who then asks to speak to Degra, the Primate scientist from episode Stratagem. Using Daniels&#x27; medal, Archer tries to convince Degra that the Reptilians cannot be trusted but Dolim arrives with armed colleagues and takes the Primates away. Sub-Commander T&#x27;Pol, in command of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, displays signs of an emotional breakdown. She also decides to go on a mission, to negotiate a peace and reacts angrily when Tucker tries to stop her. An attack from four Xindi ships follows, and the episode concludes with a cliffhanger, as &quot;Enterprise&quot; is left severely damaged.

==Production==
&quot;Azati Prime&quot; was the first episode of &quot;Enterprise&quot; to be filmed in 2004, starting on January 5. Filming took eight days, concluding on January 14. The eighth day overlapped with the production of the following episode, &quot;Damage&quot;. The story was developed by Manny Coto alongside Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. Coto developed it into a script, his third of the series. The director of the episode was Allan Kroeker, who also directed &quot;The Xindi&quot; earlier in the season as well as the final episodes of both &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. The episode featured a number of guest stars, including Smallwood, Oglesby, MacDonald and Worthy, who appeared in their recurring roles on the Xindi council. Winston appeared as Daniels for the second time during season three, having made his debut in season one&#x27;s &quot;Cold Front&quot;.

The Xindi shuttle set had been constructed for &quot;Hatchery&quot;, while a new set was constructed for the bridge of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-J, which consisted mostly of a green screen. The future &quot;Enterprise&quot; was designed by Doug Drexler, who drew the first design only two days prior to the production meeting for the episode. The computer generated model was created in a few hours, and Drexler later said that they would have finished it differently. He imagined that the vessel was so large that there would be universities and entire parks on board, with the turbolifts replaced by short range transporters. More than one design was created, with the final version created with elements from different designs. One of the elements incorporated into the version seen on screen was a reduction in the size of the warp nacelle supports as Drexler said that he did not like that they had increased in size. John Eaves also created a number of designs for aquatic Xindi vessels for use in the episode, as well as a rejected design for the superweapon.

==Reception==
&quot;Azati Prime&quot; was first aired in the United States on UPN on March 3, 2004. It received a 2.6/4 percent share among adults. This means that it was seen by 2.6 percent of all households, and four percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was the sixth most watched program in the time slot, behind &quot;Smallville&quot; on The WB. It was estimated that &quot;Azati Prime&quot; was watched by 4.02 million viewers, which was less than recent episodes had received.

Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation compared elements of the episode to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, such as the Xindi super-weapon standing in for the Death Star. She found the pacing made the episode &quot;engrossing&quot; and thought that the action sequences would qualify it for technical Emmy Awards. She said that the one flaw in the episode was the characterization of Archer and T&#x27;Pol, as she felt that some of their actions were implausible. Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website &quot;Jammer&#x27;s Reviews&quot;, gave &quot;Azati Prime&quot; a rating of three and a half out of four. He thought it was compelling and was impressed with how elements of earlier episodes were brought together, also saying that it was &quot;possibly the most entertaining episode of &quot;Enterprise&quot; yet this season&quot;. &quot;Aint It Cool News&quot; gave the episode a rating of 3.5 out of five, and generally praised the episode, but complained that Archer found himself in a prison cell yet again. Film and television critic Jordan Hoffman gave the episode four out of five, and said that the Xindi story-line was reaching a peak.
James Gray writing for &quot;The Digital Fix&quot; said &quot;Azati Prime&quot; was probably the best episode in the series yet, and had the best space battle scene of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; television and movies up to that time. &quot;Io9&quot; ranked the spacecraft design shown in this episode, the &quot;Enterprise-J&quot;, as the eleventh best version of the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

==Home media release==
The only home media release of &quot;Azati Prime&quot; has been as part of the season three DVD box set, released in the United States on September 27, 2005. The Blu-ray release of &quot;Enterprise&quot; was announced in early 2013 and season three is expected to be released in January 2014.

<text>The cinnamon bittern (Botaurus cinnamomeus) or chestnut bittern is a small Old World bittern, breeding in tropical and subtropical Asia from India east to China and Indonesia. It is mainly resident, but some northern birds migrate short distances. This species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The cinnamon bittern was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with herons, cranes, egrets and bitterns in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea cinnamomea&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Chinese heron&quot; that had been included by the English ornithologist John Latham in his multi-volume &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham had based his own description on a partial specimen in the British Museum. The cinnamon bittern was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study of the heron family Ardeidae published in 2023 found that &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was paraphyletic. To create a monophyletic genus, &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was merged into the genus &quot;Botaurus&quot; that had been introduced in 1819 by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens. The genus name &quot;Botaurus&quot; is Medieval Latin for a bittern. The specific epithet &quot;cinnamomeus&quot; is Latin meaning &#x27;cinnamon coloured&#x27;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

It is a small bittern at length. Possessing a short neck and longish bill, the male is uniformly cinnamon above and buff below. The female is similar but her back and crown are brown, and the juvenile is like the female but heavily streaked brown below. When surprised on its nest or concerned, it assumes the characteristic attitude of bitterns, termed the &quot;on-guard&quot;. The neck is stretched perpendicularly, bill pointing skyward, while the bird freezes and becomes very hard to see among the surrounding reeds.

==Distribution and habitat==

The species has an extremely large range throughout Asia; there are breeding populations from India to Indonesia. Vagrants have been in Micronesia, the Seychelles and Afghanistan, among other locations. Global population estimates are uncertain and range from 130,000 to 2,000,000 individuals.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The cinnamon bittern breeds in reed beds, nesting on platforms of reeds in shrubs. Four to six eggs are laid. The species can be difficult to see, given their skulking lifestyle and reed bed habitat, but tend to emerge at dusk, when they can be seen creeping almost cat-like in search of frogs. Cinnamon bitterns feed on insects, fish and amphibians.

<text>The Rio–Niterói Bridge (in Portuguese: Ponte Rio-Niterói), officially the President Costa e Silva Bridge, is a box girder bridge spanning the Guanabara Bay, connecting the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Niterói in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is currently the second longest bridge in Latin America, after the Metro Line 1 bridge, and the 48th longest in the world in 2020. From its completion in 1974 until 1985 it was the world&#x27;s second-longest bridge, second only to the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.

It is long – over water and the bridge&#x27;s central span is high in order to allow the passage of hundreds of ships entering and leaving the bay every month. At the time it was completed, the central span was the longest box girder in the world; it has since been surpassed by the main span of the Stolma Bridge (1998) and the main span of the second Shibanpo Bridge (2006). It carries over 150,000 vehicles daily, which pay a toll only when entering Niterói of . It has 18 access points and eight overpasses.

Officially, it is part of federal highway BR-101. From 1 June 1995, it was under the management of Ponte S.A. under a 20-year concession until 1 June 2015 since when Ecoponte has managed the bridge.

==History==
The concept dates to 1875, when a bridge-and-tunnel connection was envisioned between two cities separated by Guanabara Bay and connected by road only via inland journey of more than through the city of Magé.

In 1963, a working group was created to study a bridge-building project. On 29 December 1965, an executive committee was formed to run the bridge-building program. President Artur da Costa e Silva signed a decree on 23 August 1968, authorizing the project for the bridge. The bridge program was run by Minister of Transport .

Construction began symbolically on 9 November 1968, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom on her only visit to Brazil. Actual work began in December 1968 

Initially, the bridge was constructed by a consortium of Brazilian companies led by Camargo Correa SA (for the concrete works) and by Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company and Redpath Dorman Long in association with Montreal Engenharia of Brazil (for the steel navigation spans). On January 26, 1971, President Emílio Garrastazu Médici signed a decree taking control of the consortium.

The bridge opened on 4 March 1974, on a Monday morning, with the official name of President Costa e Silva Bridge. &quot;Rio-Niterói&quot; started as a descriptive nickname that soon became better known than the official name. Today hardly anyone refers to it by its official name.

In 2012 a bill was introduced to change its official name, President Costa e Silva Bridge - the second president of the Brazilian military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985 - to Herbert de Souza Bridge, which has annoyed the Brazilian military.

== Controversy ==
Officially, 33 people died during the construction of the bridge. Unofficial estimates put the death toll in excess of 400. Some people suggested that workers were buried within the concrete, but engineer Bruno Contarini contested that by saying, &quot;There wasn’t even concrete when one of the foundations toppled over during the load test and eight people died. If any bodies were not rescued, it’s because they disappeared in the bay, not because they were buried in concrete .&quot;

== Pop culture ==
In 1977, the famous Brazilian singer Maysa died in a car crash on the bridge.

In 2011, the bridge was featured in the film &quot;Fast Five&quot;. The Puerto Rican bridge Teodoro Moscoso doubled for the bridge during the last moments of the film.

<doc id="512414" wikidata="Q20972612" url="?curid=512414" title="Ambrosia beetle">
<text>Ambrosia beetles are beetles of the weevil subfamilies Scolytinae and Platypodinae (Coleoptera, Curculionidae), which live in nutritional symbiosis with ambrosia fungi. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead or stressed trees into which they introduce fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant&#x27;s xylem tissue, extracts nutrients from it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery. Ambrosia fungi are typically poor wood degraders, and instead utilize less demanding nutrients. Symbiotic fungi produce and detoxify ethanol, which is an attractant for ambrosia beetles and likely prevents growth of antagonistic pathogens and selects for other beneficial symbionts. The majority of ambrosia beetles colonize xylem (sapwood and/or heartwood) of recently dead trees, but some colonize stressed trees that are still alive, and a few species attack healthy trees. Species differ in their preference for different parts of trees, different stages of deterioration, and in the shape of their tunnels (&quot;galleries&quot;). However, the majority of ambrosia beetles are not specialized to any taxonomic group of hosts, unlike most phytophagous organisms including the closely related bark beetles.
One species of ambrosia beetle, &quot;Austroplatypus incompertus&quot; exhibits eusociality, one of the few organisms outside of Hymenoptera and Isoptera to do so.

==Classification and diversity==
Until recently ambrosia beetles have been placed in independent families Scolytidae and Platypodidae, however, they are in fact some of the most highly derived weevils, and are now placed in the subfamilies Scolytinae and Platypodinae of Family Curculionidae There are about 3,000 known beetle species employing the ambrosia strategy.

Ambrosia beetles are an ecological guild, but not a phylogenetic clade. The ambrosia habit is an example of convergent evolution, as several groups evolved the same symbiotic relationship independently. The highest diversity of ambrosia beetles is in the tropics. In the Paleotropical region, hundreds of species of Xyleborini and Platypodinae are the main agent initiating dead wood decomposition. In the Neotropics, Platypodinae and Xyleborini are joined by the scolytine tribe Cortylini. Compared to the diversity in the tropics, ambrosia beetle fauna in the temperate zone is rather limited. In the Nearctic region it is dominated by a few species from Cortylini, Xyleborini and Xyloterini. In the Palearctic realm, significant groups are Xyloterini and Xyleborini, joined by Scolytoplatypodini in the Far East.

==The symbiotic relationship==
Beetles and their larvae graze on mycelium exposed on the gallery walls and on bodies called sporodochia, clusters of the fungus&#x27; spores. Most ambrosia beetle species don&#x27;t ingest the wood tissue; instead, the sawdust resulting from the excavation is pushed out of the gallery. Following the larval and pupal stage, adult ambrosia beetles collect masses of fungal spores into their mycangia and leave the gallery to find their own tree.

A few dozen species of ambrosia fungi have been described, currently in the genera &quot;Ambrosiella&quot;, &quot;Meredithiella&quot;, and &quot;Phialophoropsis&quot; (from Microascales), &quot;Afroraffaelea&quot; and &quot;Raffaelea&quot; (from Ophiostomatales), &quot;Ambrosiozyma&quot; (Saccharomycetales), &quot;Fusarium&quot; and &quot;Geosmithia&quot; (from Hypocreales), and &quot;Flavodon&quot; (from Basidiomycota). Many more species remain to be discovered. Little is known about the bionomy or specificity of ambrosia fungi. Ambrosia fungi are thought to be dependent on transport and inoculation provided by their beetle symbionts, as they have not been found in any other habitat. All ambrosia fungi are probably asexual and clonal. Some beetles are known to acquire (&quot;steal&quot;) fungal inoculum from fungal gardens of other ambrosia beetle species.

==Evolutionary origin==
During their evolution, most scolytid and platypodid weevils became progressively more or less dependent on fungi regularly co-habiting dead trees. This evolution had various outcomes in different groups:
* Some phloem-eating bark beetles (phloeophages) are vectors of phytopathogenic fungi, which in some cases contribute to tree death. The extent to which fungal pathogenicity benefits the beetles themselves is not at all trivial and remains disputed.
* Many of phloem-feeding bark beetles use phloem-infesting fungi as an addition to their diet. Some phloeophages became dependent on such a mixed diet and evolved mycangia to transport their symbionts from maternal trees to newly infested trees. These beetles are called &quot;mycophloeophages&quot;.
* Ambrosia beetles and ambrosia fungi are thus only one end of the spectrum of the weevil-fungus association, where both the beetle and the fungus became completely dependent on each other.

==Impact on forests==

The vast majority of ambrosia beetles colonize dead trees, and have minor or no economic effect. A few species are able to colonize living stressed trees (&quot;Xylosandrus&quot;). A few species are able to attack live and healthy trees, and those can reach epidemic proportions in non-native, invaded regions (&quot;Xyleborus glabratus&quot;, &quot;Euwallacea fornicatus&quot;).

Beetle species that readily colonize lumber, such as sawlogs, green lumber, and stave-bolts, often cause region-specific economic loss from the pinhole and stained-wood defects caused by their brood galleries. In Northern USA and Canada, conifer logs are attractive to &quot;Trypodendron lineatum&quot; (Oliv.) during the spring swarming flight (Dyer 1967). Previous studies showed that short log sections become attractive more rapidly than corresponding long logs.

<doc id="512420" wikidata="Q888536" url="?curid=512420" title="Yellow bittern">
<text>The yellow bittern (Botaurus sinensis) is a small bittern. It is of Old World origins, breeding in the northern Indian Subcontinent, east to the Russian Far East, Japan and Indonesia. It is mainly resident, but some northern birds migrate short distances. It has been recorded as a vagrant in Alaska and there is a single sighting in Great Britain, from Radipole Lake, Dorset on November 23, 1962 – however, the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union has always considered this occurrence to be of uncertain provenance and currently it is not accepted onto the official British List. This species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The yellow bittern was formally described in 1789 by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the herons, cranes, storks and bitterns in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea sinensis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Chinese heron&quot; that had been included by the English ornithologist John Latham in his multi-volume work &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham based his description on a collection of Chinese drawings. The yellow bittern was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study of the heron family Ardeidae published in 2023 found that &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was paraphyletic and to create monophyletic genera, &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was merged into the genus &quot;Botaurus&quot; that had been introduced in 1819 by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens. The genus name &quot;Botaurus&quot; is Medieval Latin for a bittern. The specific epithet &quot;sinensis&quot; is Modern Latin meaning &quot;China&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The yellow bittern is a small species at in length, with a short neck and longish bill. It has yellow green legs, an ivory bill (darker on top), a short black tail and yellow irises. The male of the species has a dark cap, chestnut head and neck, with a uniformly dull yellow body above and buff below. The female&#x27;s cap, neck and breast are streaked, with a rufous hindneck and upper back and streaked dark red brown and buff under parts. The juveniles of the species resemble the female but is more boldly streaked, brown on its head and back, and mottled with buff above.

==Distribution and habitat==

Yellow bittern&#x27;s are found in fresh water marshes and swamps. It nests in small constructed platforms of reeds or twigs in the vegetation of reed beds or in trees and shrubs adjacent to or above water. They lay four to six pale blue-green eggs.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Yellow bitterns feed on a variety of insects, fish, amphibians, crustaceans and molluscs. 

==Conservation==
The yellow bittern is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

<doc id="512421" wikidata="Q3551466" url="?curid=512421" title="North Park University">
<text>North Park University is a private Christian university in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded in 1891 by the Evangelical Covenant Church. It is located on Chicago&#x27;s north side in the North Park community area and enrolls more than 2,600 undergraduate and graduate students.

==History==

The university originated in the founding of North Park Theological Seminary in 1891 by the Evangelical Covenant Church in Minneapolis. In 1894, the school moved to Chicago and opened as North Park College, to its present location at the corner of Foster and Kedzie. Although far from the Loop, the location was close to then existing Swedish-American villages and the newly established Swedish Covenant Hospital. Old Main, the oldest building on campus, was erected and dedicated on June 16, 1894. It is at this time that the name North Park was first used to describe the school.

Struggles and success marked the early years of North Park; enrollment and funding fluctuated significantly. An interesting source of both money and headache came from P. H. Anderson, who was serving as a Covenant missionary in Alaska at the time. When he made a small fortune during the gold rush, he donated a significant portion of the windfall to North Park. However, the money was considered tainted by some of North Park’s leadership, who thought the money was of dubious origin.
A leader at that time was David Nyvall. Nyvall served as president and teacher in the Seminary for many years. The current seminary building, Nyvall Hall, is named after him. 

Since the early days, the school has developed and changed in many ways. In 1958, North Park Junior College expanded from a two-year college into a four-year program, becoming North Park College. In 1997, the decision was made to change the name of the school again, and North Park University was born. Though North Park still holds on to its Swedish American past and close ties with the Evangelical Covenant Church, it is now an intercultural institution focused on diversity. North Park describes itself as a liberal arts university that is Christian, city-centered, and intercultural. North Park University is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and the Higher Learning Commission. It is also a designated Hispanic-serving institution. The seminary is additionally accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada. North Park&#x27;s last president, David L. Parkyn, retired at the end of the 2016–2017 academic year. Carl E. Balsam was named as the interim president in June 2017, and served until August 2018. Mary Surridge was nominated as the school&#x27;s tenth president, and began her term in August 2018.

<doc id="512426" wikidata="Q888559" url="?curid=512426" title="Black bittern">
<text>The black bittern (Botaurus flavicollis) is a bittern of Old World origin, breeding in tropical Asia from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka east to China, Indonesia, and Australia. It is mainly resident, but some northern birds migrate short distances. This species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The black bittern was formally described in 1790 by the English ornithologist John Latham under the binomial name &quot;Ardea flavicollis&quot;. He used the English name &quot;yellow-necked heron&quot; and specified the type locality as India. The black bittern was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; but when a molecular phylogenetic study of the heron family Ardeidae published in 2023 found that &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was paraphyletic, &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was merged into the genus &quot;Botaurus&quot; that had been introduced in 1819 by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens. The genus name &quot;Botaurus&quot; is Medieval Latin for a bittern. The specific epithet &quot;flavicollis&quot; combines Latin &quot;flavidus&quot; meaning &quot;yellowish&quot; with Modern Latin &quot;-collis&quot; meaning &quot;-throated&quot;.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;B. f. flavicollis&quot; (Latham, 1790) – India to Indochina, Philippines and west, central Indonesia
* &quot;B. f. australis&quot; (Lesson, RP, 1831) – east Indonesia, New Guinea, Bismarck Archipelago and Australia
* &quot;B. f. woodfordi&quot; (Ogilvie-Grant, 1888) – Bougainville Island to Rennell Island (north to south Solomon Islands, except Makira)

==Description==
It is a medium sized bittern at in length. It has dark upperparts with a dark bill. The male is black above with buff neck sides and with a neck is heavily streaked with brown. The female is dark brown rather than black. The juvenile is like the female but paler. They can be difficult to see, given their skulking lifestyle and reed bed habitat, but tend to fly fairly frequently when the all black upperparts makes them unmistakable.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Their breeding habitat is reed beds. They nest on platforms of reeds in shrubs, or sometimes in trees. Three to five eggs are laid. The chicks are covered with white down with brown patches. They first wander from their nest when aged around 15 days.

===Food and feeding===
Black bitterns feed on frogs, fish up to 15cm in length, crustacea and insects. They are crepuscular and nocturnal, mainly feeding at dusk and at dawk.

==Conservation status==
===Australia===
Black bitterns are not listed as threatened on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. In the state of State of Victoria, Australia, the black bittern is listed as threatened on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988). Under this act, an &quot;Action Statement&quot; for the recovery and future management of this species has not yet been prepared. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the black bittern is listed as vulnerable.

<text>Marcus Piavonius Victorinus was emperor in the Gallic provinces from 268 to 270 or 269 to 271, following the brief reign of Marius. He was murdered by a jealous husband whose wife he had tried to seduce.

==Reign==
Hailing from Gaul, Victorinus was born into a Gallic family of great wealth, and was a soldier under Postumus, the first of the so-called Gallic emperors. He showed considerable ability, as he held the title of tribunus praetorianorum (tribune of the praetorians) in 266/267, and rose swiftly to become co-consul with Postumus in 268. It is also possible that Postumus then elevated him to the post of praetorian prefect. Shortly after putting down a rebellion by Laelianus in 269, Postumus was murdered by his own troops, who appointed Marius as emperor in his place.

After engineering the death of Marius, Victorinus was declared emperor by the troops located at Augusta Treverorum (Trier) in the fall of 269. His principal concern was to prevent the western provinces from submitting to the central authority of the Roman Empire, a fact made clear to him from the first few weeks when only the provinces of Gaul, Germania and Britain recognised him. Hispania deserted the Gallic Empire and declared its loyalty to Claudius Gothicus. Claudius then sent his trusted general Placidianus to south-east Gaul with instructions to bring over as many of the wavering cities as he could. Very quickly Placidianus captured Cularo (Grenoble), but did not proceed any further.

The presence of Placidianus inspired the city of Augustodunum Haeduorum (Autun) to abandon Victorinus and declare its intention to declare for Claudius Gothicus. This forced Victorinus to march south and besiege it, where it fell after seven months, after which Victorinus’ troops plundered and destroyed the city. Victorinus returned to Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (Cologne) in triumph. It remains a mystery just why Claudius did not authorise Placidianus to go to the relief of Augustodunum; however, it is speculated that Claudius, who was fully engaged either in Italy against the Alamanni or in the Balkans against the Goths, did not wish to open a second theatre of operations in Gaul, which would not only have involved a major military effort, but would also have required Claudius to assume responsibility for the defense of the Rhine frontier had he been successful. There is evidence to suggest that Claudius was having some difficulties in the East, which also occupied his attention.

Victorinus was murdered at Colonia in early 271 by Attitianus, one of his officers, whose wife Victorinus had supposedly seduced. Since the motive was personal and not political, Victorinus&#x27; mother, Victoria (or Vitruvia), was able to continue to hold power after the death of Victorinus and she arranged for his deification and, after considerable payment to the troops, the appointment of Tetricus I as his successor. Another military commander appears to have been proclaimed as the emperor Domitianus II, but was soon eliminated.

Victorinus is listed among the Thirty Tyrants in the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;. The dubious &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; equally has a short description of Victorinus Junior, allegedly the son of Victorinus, who was appointed emperor by his family the day his father was murdered, and would have been killed immediately afterwards by the troops. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; also says that both father and son were buried near Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium in marble tombs.

<doc id="512432" wikidata="Q852467" url="?curid=512432" title="Valpolicella">
<text>Valpolicella (, , ) is a viticultural zone of the province of Verona, Italy, east of Lake Garda. The hilly agricultural and marble-quarrying region of small holdings north of the Adige is famous for wine production. Valpolicella ranks just after Chianti in total Italian &quot;denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) wine production.

The red wine known as Valpolicella is typically made from three grape varieties: Corvina Veronese, Rondinella, and Molinara. A variety of wine styles are produced in the area, including a &quot;recioto&quot; dessert wine and Amarone, a strong wine made from dried grapes. Most basic Valpolicellas are light, fragrant table wines produced in a &quot;novello&quot; style, similar to Beaujolais nouveau and released only a few weeks after harvest. Valpolicella Classico is made from grapes grown in the original Valpolicella production zone. Valpolicella Superiore is aged at least one year and has an alcohol content of at least 12 percent. Valpolicella Ripasso is a form of Valpolicella Superiore made with partially dried grape skins that have been left over from fermentation of Amarone or &quot;recioto&quot;.

Winemaking in the region has existed since at least the time of the ancient Greeks. The name &quot;Valpolicella&quot; appeared in charters of the mid-12th century, combining two valleys previously thought of independently. Its etymology is likely from the Latin &quot;vallis pulicellae&quot; (&quot;valley of river deposits&quot;). Today Valpolicella&#x27;s economy is heavily based on wine production. The region, colloquially called the &quot;pearl of Verona&quot;, has also been a preferred location for rural vacation villas. Seven &quot;comuni&quot; compose Valpolicella: Pescantina, San Pietro in Cariano, Negrar, Marano di Valpolicella, Fumane, Sant’Ambrogio di Valpolicella and Sant’Anna d’Alfaedo. The Valpolicella production zone was enlarged to include regions of the surrounding plains when Valpolicella achieved DOC status in 1968. In December 2009, the production of Amarone and &quot;recioto&quot; dessert wines within the Valpolicella DOC received their own separate &quot;denominazione di origine controllata e garantita&quot; (DOCG) status.

==History==
Viticulture has been used in the Veneto region since at least the time of the ancient Greeks, though the exact period of cultivation for the Valpolicella area is not precisely known. The tradition of using partially dried grapes (seen today in the modern Valpolicella wines of Amarone) was known as the &quot;Greco&quot; or &quot;Greek style&quot; of winemaking, with its origins likely dating back to this period. In the 6th century AD, the Roman writer Cassiodorus notes that the sweet wines of the area were favorites in the courts of the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy. Since the 8th century AD, the Republic of Venice was long a vital trading port in the Mediterranean, linking the Byzantine Empire with the rest of Europe. Merchants records shows that one of the items regularly traded through Venice was local wines produced in Verona province in the hills west of Venice. During the 15th and 16th century, struggles with the Ottoman Turks led to frequent blockades of the Venetian ports, limiting the amount of available export wines from the Greek isles and abroad. This further stimulated the development of domestic vineyards for the Venetians, who pushed even further into the hills of the Verona and the Valpolicella region.

The 19th century brought a series of calamities to most wine-producing regions including the phylloxera epidemic, oidium, downy mildew and the political upheaval of the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;. According to the 1889 writings of the French wine historian Dr. C. B. Cerletti, one of the few Italian wine regions to emerge from this period relatively unscathed was Valpolicella. In the 1950s, the &quot;Amarone&quot; style of winemaking was rediscovered. In 1968, the Valpolicella region received official recognition for quality wine production when it was granted its own DOC. However, with DOC recognition also came a large expansion of vineyard areas that were permitted to produce Valpolicella DOC wine, including land in the fertile plains of the Po River, which tend to produce large yields of grapes with varying qualities. Additionally, the grape composition for Valpolicella wines was expanded to include varieties of lower potential quality such as Molinara and Rondinella. This led to a general drop in quality, which had a detrimental impact not only on the area&#x27;s reputation in the international wine market but also on sales and prices. As winemaking became less profitable, the vineyards in the most labor-intensive areas (such as the hillsides in the classico zone) were uprooted and abandoned. This shifted the source of grape production even further away from the better quality producing hillside regions down to the fertile plains.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the Amarone wines of Valpolicella experienced a spike in popularity on the world&#x27;s wine market. Production of Amarone jumped from 522,320 US gallons (19,772 hectoliters) in 1972 to 1.2 million gallons (46,500 hl) by 1990. By 2000 Amarone production grew to over 3.9 million gallons (148,000 hl). By this point, the price for grapes destined for Amarone production was nearly three times higher than what a comparable quantity of grapes would fetch for basic Valpolicella production. This sparked renewed interest in planting vineyards in the high altitude hillside locations that produced lower yields of grapes better suited for Amarone production. In the 21st century, the reputation of Valpolicella wines continued to expand on the world&#x27;s wine market, as ambitious winemakers began to invest more in advanced viticultural and winemaking techniques that produce higher quality wines. In 2003, the DOC regulations were adjusted to eliminate mandatory blending requirements for sub-quality grapes such as Molinara. At the end of 2009, the production of both Amarone and &quot;recioto&quot; dessert wines in the Valpolicella zone received Italy&#x27;s highest quality wine designation as a DOCG zones.

==Climate and geography==

The Valpolicella region has mostly a mild to cool continental climate that is influenced by its proximity to two sizable bodies of water-Lake Garda to the west and the Adriatic Sea to the southeast. The coolest regions are in the &quot;Monti Lessini&quot; foothills to the north, where cool winds blow southward from the Alps. This area is traditionally classified as the &quot;classico zone&quot;. Towards the south and east, the climate gets warmer in the fertile plains of the Adige river. The mean temperature in the growing season is usually around 74.5 °F (23.6 °C), with average rainfall around 34 inches (860 mm).

The vineyard soils of the region range from morainic gravel near Lake Garda to more dolomite residual gravel with alluvial deposits in the fertile central plains. Towards the east and near the Soave DOC are several areas featuring volcanic soils. The most favorably situated vineyards are located in the Monti Lessini foothills in the &quot;classico zone&quot; where the grapes ripen at altitudes between .

==Wine regions==

The Valpolicella zone is bordered to the west by the Bardolino DOC, located along the banks of Lake Garda, which produces similar wines to basic Valpolicella using many of the same grapes. The historical &quot;heart&quot; of Valpolicella winemaking is in the Monti Lessini hills located northwest of Verona. In 1968, the boundaries of the region were extended far eastward towards the DOC production zone of Soave and south to the plains of the northern bank of the Po river and the Adige.

Today the original zone is known as &quot;Valpolicella Classico&quot; zone and may duly noted on the wine labels of wines produced completely from grapes grown in this area. Today over 40% of all wine production in Valpolicella takes place in the classico zone, with an estimated yearly production of 12.2 million gallons (460,000 hl). Another sub-zone that is permitted to attach its name to the wine is the &quot;Valpolicella Valpantena&quot; located in the valley located just east of Verona.

==Grapes and wine styles==

Most of the wines produced under the Valpolicella DOC are red and usually contain a sizable amount of the area&#x27;s most distinguished grape, Corvina. Other grapes used in the production of Valpolicella wine most often include Rondinella and Corvinone, but also Molinara, Rossignola, Negrara, Barbera, Sangiovese and Bigolona. A few producers are experimenting with reviving the indigenous grape Oseleta in Valpolicella. The wines are produced in a wide variety of styles ranging from basic &quot;nouveau&quot; table wines, full-bodied red wines, sweet dessert wines and even sparkling &quot;spumante&quot;. The most basic Valpolicella are light-bodied and often served slightly chilled. They have many characteristics similar to a Beaujolais wine and are often noted for their sour cherry flavor. While full-bodied &quot;recioto&quot; and Amarone styles reach alcohol levels of 15–16%, most Valpolicellas have more moderate alcohol levels around 11%. For wines labeled &quot;Valpolicella Superiore&quot; the wines must be aged a minimum of one year in wood and reach a minimum alcohol level of 12%.

=== Recioto ===

The sweet red dessert wine &quot;Recioto della Valpolicella&quot; was awarded its own separate DOCG status in 2010 and has been the style historically associated with the region. The name &quot;recioto&quot;, also made in neighbouring Soave and Gambellara regions with their own DOCG designations, comes from the local dialect &quot;recie&quot;, meaning &quot;ears&quot;, and refers to the extending lobes that appear as &quot;ears&quot; at the top of a grape cluster. The exposed grapes on the &quot;ears&quot; usually receive the most direct sunlight and become the ripest grapes on the cluster. Historically these very ripe &quot;ears&quot; were picked separately and used to make very rich, sweet wines. Today the method for making &quot;recioto&quot; has evolved to include the use of whole grape clusters. Grapes destined for Recioto della Valpolicella are often grown in the most ideally situated hillside vineyards. Recioto can trace its origins to winemaking techniques of the ancient Greeks; the grapes are taken to special drying rooms where they are allowed to desiccate, concentrating the sugars inside the grape.

While &quot;recioto&quot; is typically sweet, with high levels of residual sugar, the must can be allowed to ferment completely dry. Often producers will label this wine as Amarone, but they may also choose to produce it as Valpolicella DOC wine or even an &quot;indicazione geografica tipica&quot; (IGT) table wine if they choose to use grape blends outside the DOC requirement. Some producers are experimenting with international varieties and producing dry Amarone style wines from grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon.

===&quot;Ripasso&quot;===

In the late 20th century, a new style of wine known as &quot;ripasso&quot; (meaning &#x27;repassed&#x27;) emerged. With this technique, the pomace of leftover grape skins and seeds from the fermentation of &quot;recioto&quot; and Amarone are added to the batch of Valpolicella wines for a period of extended maceration. The additional food source for the remaining fermenting yeast helps boost the alcohol level and body of the wines while also leaching additional tannins, glycerine and some phenolic compounds that contribute to a wine&#x27;s complexity, flavor and color. As the production of Amarone has increased in the 21st century, so too has the prevalence of &quot;ripasso&quot; style wines appearing in the wine market, with most Amarone producers also producing a &quot;ripasso&quot; as a type of &quot;second wine&quot;. An alternative method is to use partially dried grapes, instead of leftover pomace, which contain less bitter tannins and even more phenolic compounds.

The first Valpolicella producer to commercially market a &quot;ripasso&quot; wine was Masi in the early 1980s. When the style first became popular in the late 20th century, it was rarely noted on the wine label. There was also debate about whether it was even permitted to be included under DOC regulations. If it was mentioned at all it was relegated to the back label wine description notes. Today the term &quot;ripasso&quot; is freely permitted to be used, with several examples on the wine market labeled as being made in the &quot;ripasso&quot; style. In late 2009, &quot;Ripasso della Valpolicella&quot; received its own DOC designation.

===Amarone===


While the style of Amarone has existed in the region for centuries, it was very rarely made as a deliberate wine style. Mostly it was produced in warm vintages when batches of wines destined for sweet &quot;recioto&quot; were unintentionally allowed to ferment completely dry. The modern concept of Amarone has its roots in the early 1950s when producers &quot;rediscovered&quot; the style and began deliberately using yeast strains that could ferment the high levels of sugars in the wine completely into alcohol. The first completely dry Amarones that were commercially marketed were the 1953 vintages produced by Bolla and Bertani. In 2009, the production of Amarone wine in the Valpolicella zone achieved DOCG status. During the petitioning process, the wine producers in the region established several quality control regulations including quotas on the amount of grapes grown in the fertile plains that could be used in Amarone production. Another measure was the 2003 removal of Molinara from the list of mandatory blending grapes.

Amarone is unique in the wine world. Typically very alcoholic, full-bodied and ripe-tasting wines are produced in very warm climate regions, where the grapes are able to build up large amounts of sugar while ripening on the vine. Examples of warm climate regions include parts of Australia, California and southern Italy. The Valpolicella region is characterized as a &quot;cool climate region&quot; where acid levels are usually maintained and sugar build occurs more slowly in the vine. Grapes destined for Amarone are the last grapes in Valpolicella to be harvested, getting as ripe as they can before mold and rot set in. The sugars in the grapes are then concentrated by a process of desiccation where they are kept in special drying rooms for anywhere from three to four months. During this time over a third of the water is removed as the grapes shrivel into raisins. This method (known as &quot;passito&quot;) produces more concentrated grapes that still maintain the acid balance of a cool-climate grape. Amarones differ from other late harvest wines in that the presence of &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; is actively discouraged, as winemakers attempt to avoid the smoky, mouldy flavors that come with botrytized wine. Extra care is taken in the vineyard to ensure that the grapes are kept dry and harvested before rot can develop.

The Amarones are then aged for several years, with many premium examples being aged for at least five years prior to release. They are often aged in large wooden barrels of either Slavonian or French oak. Traditionally the barrels are older and essentially &quot;neutral&quot;, in that they do not impart much flavor or wood tannins, but in the late 20th and early 21st centuries more Amarone producers have been experimenting with the use of smaller new oak barrels that introduce more oak flavoring to the wine.

Amarones are rich, full-bodied wines with flavor and aroma notes that are often compared to the flavors of Port wine. The wines often have notes of mocha, bitter-sweet dark chocolate, raisin, dried fig and earthy flavors. At restaurants sommeliers will often recommend food and wine pairings for Amarone with hearty, heavy dishes such as meat roasts. A classic after-dinner assortment is Amarone paired with walnuts and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Master of wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan notes that well-made examples of Amarone from favorable vintages usually need about ten years of bottle aging for the flavors to mature, and have the potential to continue developing for twenty years or more.

<text>Lagarostrobos franklinii is a species of conifer native to the wet southwestern corner of Tasmania, Australia. It is often known as the Huon pine or Macquarie pine, although it is actually a podocarp (Podocarpaceae), not a true pine (Pinaceae). It is the sole species in the genus Lagarostrobos; one other species &quot;L. colensoi&quot; (endemic to New Zealand) formerly included has been transferred to a new genus &quot;Manoao&quot;. The genus was also formerly included in a broader circumscription of the genus &quot;Dacrydium&quot;.

In molecular phylogenetic analyses &quot;Lagorostrobos&quot; was found to be related to &quot;Parasitaxus&quot; (a parasitic and monotypic genus from New Caledonia) and &quot;Manoao&quot;, but their exact relationships are unresolved.

The wood is highly prized for its golden yellow colour, fine grain, and natural oils that resist rotting. The chemical giving the timber its unique smell and preservative qualities is methyl eugenol.

It has been planted in the grounds of Crathes Castle, Aberdeenshire, Scotland and has done well. Two healthy specimens can also be found at Torosay Castle, Isle of Mull.

==Description==

The Huon pine is a slow-growing, but long-lived tree; some living specimens of this tree are in excess of 2,000 years old. It grows to tall, exceptionally reaching , with arching branches and pendulous branchlets. The leaves are spirally arranged, very small and scale-like, long, covering the shoots completely. It is dioecious, with male (pollen) and female (seed) cones on separate plants. The male cones are yellow, long and broad. The mature seed cones are highly modified, berry-like, with 5 to 10 lax, open scales which mature in six-to-eight months, with one seed long on each scale. Unlike the closely related New Zealand genus &quot;Manoao&quot;, the scales do not become fleshy and are water-dispersed, not bird-dispersed.

Based on herbarium specimens the extent of occurrence is estimated to be around with an estimated area of occupancy of . The actual area of occupancy is estimated to range from (Gibson 1991) to as much as (Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania 2006).

==Age==
Huon pines are some of the oldest living organisms on the Earth.

A stand of trees in excess of 10,500 years old was found in 1955 in western Tasmania on Mount Read. Each of the trees in this stand is a genetically identical male that has reproduced vegetatively. Although no single tree in this stand is of that age, the stand itself as a single organism has existed that long.

Individual trees in the clonal patch have been listed as having ages of 2,000 or even to 3,000 years old.

Because of the long life of individual trees, tree rings from Huon Pine have been used for dendrochronology to establish a record of climate variation.

==Conservation==
An estimated 15% of its habitat has been lost through inundation for hydroelectric schemes and to fire over the past 100 years or so. Extensive logging in the past has removed nearly all large trees, but there is regrowth nearly everywhere. One stand of the species has been made available for access to craft wood from dead and downed timber under a strict licensing system. It is illegal to cut living trees.

<text>Ferroelectric capacitor is a capacitor based on a ferroelectric material. In contrast, traditional capacitors are based on dielectric materials. Ferroelectric devices are used in digital electronics as part of ferroelectric RAM, or in analog electronics as tunable capacitors (varactors).

In memory applications, the stored value of a ferroelectric capacitor is read by applying an electric field. The amount of charge needed to flip the memory cell to the opposite state is measured and the previous state of the cell is revealed. This means that the read operation destroys the memory cell state, and has to be followed by a corresponding write operation, in order to write the bit back. This makes it similar to (now obsolete) ferrite core memory. The requirement of a write cycle for each read cycle, together with the high but not infinite write cycle limit is a potential problem for some special applications.

== Theory ==
In a short-circuited ferroelectric capacitor with a metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) structure, a charge distribution of screening charges forms at the metal-ferroelectric interface so as to screen the electric displacement of the ferroelectric. Due to these screening charges, there is a voltage drop across the ferroelectric capacitor with screening in the electrode layer that can be obtained using the Thomas-Fermi approach as follows:

formula_1

Here formula_2 is the film thickness, formula_3 and formula_4 are the electric fields in the film and electrode at the interface, formula_5 is the spontaneous polarization, formula_6, and formula_7 &amp; formula_8 are the dielectric constants of the film and the metal electrode.

With perfect electrodes, formula_9 or for thick films, with formula_10 the equation reduces to:

formula_11

<doc id="512438" wikidata="Q4552173" url="?curid=512438" title="USS Dickerson">
<text>USS &quot;Dickerson&quot; (DD-157) was a &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy, and was converted to a high-speed transport at Charleston, South Carolina and designated APD-21 in 1943. She was named for Mahlon Dickerson (1770–1853), Secretary of the Navy from 1834 to 1838.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Dickerson&quot; was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden in New Jersey on 25 May 1918, launched on 12 March 1919 by Mrs. J. S. Dickerson and commissioned on 3 September 1919. &quot;Dickerson&quot; was decommissioned on 26 June 1922 and placed in reserve at the New York Navy Yard until recommissioned on 1 May 1930, served with the Rotating Reserve, was assigned to the Neutrality Patrol at Key West on 25 July 1940,

==Service history==
&quot;Dickerson&quot; operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean and in 1921 took part in the combined fleet maneuvers off South America, visiting Valparaíso, Callao, and Balboa, Panama, before returning to Hampton Roads where the U.S. Atlantic Fleet was reviewed by President Warren G. Harding. Entering New York Navy Yard in November 1921, &quot;Dickerson&quot; was decommissioned there 25 June 1922.

Recommissioned 1 May 1930, &quot;Dickerson&quot; resumed operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean, engaging in tactical exercises with carriers, torpedo firing, and maneuvers with the Fleet. In 1932 and again in 1933–34, she transited the Panama Canal for combined fleet maneuvers on the west coast. Upon her return from the latter cruise, she took part in the Presidential Fleet Review on 31 May 1934 at Brooklyn, New York, then entered Norfolk Navy Yard in August where she was assigned to Rotating Reserve Squadron 19 for overhaul. In 1935, she was attached to the Training Squadron and served as training ship for members of the Naval Reserve, operating between Charleston and Florida and the Caribbean.

Assigned to Destroyer Squadron 10, Atlantic Squadron, in 1938, &quot;Dickerson&quot; acted as plane guard for operating off Norfolk, then took part in the fleet landing exercises in the Caribbean in the spring of 1939. She sailed from Norfolk late that summer to join Squadron 40-T at Lisbon, Portugal. During the year spent in European waters, she visited Spanish ports; aided in the evacuation of refugees from Casablanca; and executed special mission for the State Department. She returned to Norfolk 25 July 1940.

===World War II===
&quot;Dickerson&quot; was assigned to the Neutrality Patrol at Key West and except for brief duty at New London with Submarine Squadron 2 in October 1940, remained on patrol in the Caribbean until October 1941. During this time she searched for and recovered six survivors of in September. After American entry into the war she was sent to Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, where she continued to patrol and escorted one convoy to Iceland and return (December 1941 – January 1942).

By March 1942, &quot;Dickerson&quot; was back at Norfolk for coastal patrol and escort duty. On 19 March, while returning to Norfolk, she sighted an unidentified ship which fired on the destroyer and badly damaged the charthouse. Four of &quot;Dickerson&quot;″s crew was killed, including her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander J. K. Reybold. The attacking ship was identified as a nervous merchantman, , and &quot;Dickerson&quot; continued on to Norfolk for repairs. She returned to duty in April and escorted convoys between Norfolk and Key West until August; between Key West and New York until October; and between New York and Cuba until January 1943.

In the first half of 1943, &quot;Dickerson&quot; operated in the Caribbean and escorted tanker convoys to Gibraltar and Algiers. She joined the hunter-killer group at Casablanca in June for offensive operations in the middle Atlantic. Between 17 July and 13 August, she sailed to Derry, Northern Ireland, for exercises with British Fleet units, returning to Charleston, S.C., for conversion to a high-speed transport.

===Convoys escorted===
===As a high-speed transport===
&quot;Dickerson&quot; was reclassified APD-21 on 21 August 1943. She sailed from Norfolk 1 November 1943 for the Pacific. She escorted convoys from Espiritu Santo to Guadalcanal, and then remained in the Solomons on patrol and local escort duty. On 30 January 1944, she landed a reconnaissance group of New Zealanders on Green Island, reembarking them shortly after midnight of 1 February after the boats were strafed by enemy airplanes. On the 15th and 20th, she landed troops on the island to capture and occupy it, and on 20 March landed marines on Emirau Island without opposition.

In April 1944, &quot;Dickerson&quot; arrived at Milne Bay, and during her 2 months in the New Guinea area, supported the landings at Seleo Island and Aitape. After a brief repair period at Pearl Harbor, she arrived at Roi in the Marshalls to embark an underwater demolition team from and carried them into action at Saipan and Guam. She remained in the Marianas as supply, control and fire support ship for her team until the end of July, then returned to the west coast for overhaul the following month.

===Fate===
&quot;Dickerson&quot; returned to action in November 1944 with her arrival at Aitape, New Guinea. After escort duty in New Guinea, she sailed 27 December for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, on 9 January 1945, again supporting the operations of an underwater demolition team. She reported to Ulithi at the end of January for repairs, and then joined the screen of a logistics support force for the invasion of Iwo Jima 19 February. She returned to Leyte with 58 prisoners of war, then departed again 24 March with an LST-LSM convoy which was assigned to capture the island of Keise Shima, on which heavy artillery would be placed for the bombardment of Okinawa. Her mission complete, &quot;Dickerson&quot; was with the transports southwest of Okinawa on the night of 2 April, when the Japanese attacked in strength. One of the &quot;kamikaze&quot; planes approached the destroyer in a long, low glide, and slashed off the tops of her two stacks before smashing into the base of her bridge, toppling her mast and starting intense gasoline fires. Almost simultaneously another plane scored a direct hit on the center of her forecastle. The explosion tore a hole in the deck almost the complete width of the ship. Despite immediate fire and damage control measures, &quot;Dickerson&quot;″s crew was forced to abandon ship when the raging fires threatened her forward magazine. Fifty-four officers and men, including the commanding officer, were lost. and stood by to rescue survivors, and &quot;Bunch&quot; succeeded in putting out the fires which had virtually demolished &quot;Dickerson&quot;. The smoldering hulk was towed by to a captured Japanese Base, Kerama Retto, the dead and salvageable material were removed, then it was towed out to sea and sunk on 4 April 1945.

==Awards==
&quot;Dickerson&quot; received six battle stars for World War II service.

<text>In the United States, a number of ships whose construction was authorized during World War I entered service at a time when the post-war cutbacks in funds and personnel seriously curtailed American peacetime naval operations. The Navy established the rotating reserve to maintain a force at different levels of readiness. In practice, this system divided the force into thirds. One-third of a given force would &quot;remain alongside&quot; where the ship would be moored or buoyed in port, maintained by only the minimum number of personnel. The other third was half-staffed and berthed at a buoy in the harbor. The final third was also buoyed in the harbor, but was fully staffed and conducted periodic operations underway at sea.

<text>Moorhens—sometimes called marsh hens—are medium-sized water birds that are members of the rail family (Rallidae). Most species are placed in the genus Gallinula, Latin for &quot;little hen.&quot; 
They are close relatives of coots. They are often referred to as (black) gallinules. Recently, one of the species of &quot;Gallinula&quot; was found to have enough differences to form a new genus &quot;Paragallinula&quot; with the only species being the lesser moorhen (&quot;Paragallinula angulata&quot;).

Two species from the Australian region, sometimes separated in , are called &quot;native hens&quot; (also native-hen or nativehen). The native hens differ visually by shorter, thicker and stubbier toes and bills, and longer tails that lack the white signal pattern of typical moorhens.

==Description==

These rails are mostly brown and black with some white markings in plumage color. Unlike many of the rails, they are usually easy to see because they feed in open water margins rather than hidden in reedbeds.

They have short rounded wings and are weak fliers, although usually capable of covering long distances. The common moorhen in particular migrates up to from some of its breeding areas in the colder parts of Siberia. Those that migrate do so at night. The Gough moorhen on the other hand is considered almost flightless; it can only flutter some metres. As is common in rails, there has been a marked tendency to evolve flightlessness in island populations.

Moorhens can walk very well on their strong legs, and have long toes that are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces.

These birds are omnivorous, consuming plant material, small rodents, amphibians and eggs. They are aggressively territorial during the breeding season, but are otherwise often found in sizeable flocks on the shallow vegetated lakes they prefer.

==Systematics and evolution==

The genus &quot;Gallinula&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the common moorhen (&quot;Gallinula chloropus&quot;) as the type species.

The genus &quot;Gallinula&quot; contains five extant, one recently extinct, and one possibly extinct species:

*Samoan moorhen, &quot;Gallinula pacifica&quot; – sometimes placed in &quot;Pareudiastes&quot;, possibly extinct (1907?)
*Makira moorhen, &quot;Gallinula silvestris&quot; – sometimes placed in &quot;Pareudiastes&quot; or &quot;Edithornis&quot;, extremely rare with no direct observations in recent decades, but still considered likely extant due to reports of the species persisting in very small numbers.
*†Tristan moorhen, &quot;Gallinula nesiotis&quot; – formerly sometimes placed in &quot;&quot;; extinct (late 19th century)
*Gough moorhen, &quot;Gallinula comeri&quot; – formerly sometimes placed in &quot;Porphyriornis&quot;
*Common moorhen, &quot;Gallinula chloropus&quot;
*Common gallinule, &quot;Gallinula (chloropus) galeata&quot;, recently split by the AOU, other committees still evaluating
*Dusky moorhen, &quot;Gallinula tenebrosa&quot;

Former members of the genus:
*Lesser moorhen, &quot;Paragallinula angulata&quot;
*Spot-flanked gallinule, &quot;Porphyriops melanops&quot;
*Black-tailed native hen, &quot;Tribonyx ventralis&quot;
*Tasmanian native hen, &quot;Tribonyx mortierii&quot;

Other moorhens have been described from older remains. Apart from the 1–3 extinctions in more recent times, another 1–4 species have gone extinct as a consequence of early human settlement: Hodgen&#x27;s waterhen (&quot;Gallinula hodgenorum&quot;) of New Zealand—which belongs in subgenus &quot;Tribonyx&quot;—and a species close to the Samoan moorhen from Buka, Solomon Islands, which is almost certainly distinct from the Makira moorhen, as the latter cannot fly. The undescribed Viti Levu gallinule of Fiji would either be separated in &quot;Pareudiastes&quot; if that genus is considered valid, or may be a completely new genus. Similarly, the undescribed &quot;swamphen&quot; of Mangaia, currently tentatively assigned to &quot;Porphyrio&quot;, may belong to &quot;Gallinula&quot;/&quot;Pareudiastes&quot;.

===Evolution===

Still older fossils document the genus since the Late Oligocene onwards. The genus seems to have originated in the Southern Hemisphere, in the general region of Australia. By the Pliocene, it was probably distributed worldwide:
* &quot;Gallinula&quot; sp. (Early Pliocene of Hungary and Germany)
* &quot;Gallinula kansarum&quot; (Late Pliocene of Kansas, USA)
* &quot;Gallinula balcanica&quot; (Late Pliocene of Varshets, Bulgaria).
* &quot;Gallinula gigantea&quot; (Early Pleistocene of Czech Republic and Israel)

The ancient &quot;&quot;Gallinula&quot; disneyi&quot; (Late Oligocene—Early Miocene of Riversleigh, Australia) has been separated as genus &quot;Australlus&quot;.

Even among non-Passeriformes, this genus has a long documented existence. Consequently, some unassigned fragmentary rail fossils might also be from moorhens or native hens. For example, specimen QM F30696, a left distal tibiotarsus piece from the Oligo-Miocene boundary at Riversleigh, is similar to but differs in details from &quot;&quot;G.&quot; disneyi&quot;. It cannot be said if this bird—if a distinct species—was flightless. From size alone, it might have been an ancestor of &quot;G. mortierii&quot; (see also below).

In addition to paleosubspecies of &quot;Gallinula chloropus&quot;, the doubtfully distinct Late Pliocene to Pleistocene &quot;Gallinula mortierii reperta&quot; was described, referring to the population of the Tasmanian native hen that once inhabited mainland Australia and became extinct at the end of the last ice age. It may be that apart from climate change it was driven to extinction by the introduction of the dingo, which as opposed to the marsupial predators hunted during the day, but this would require a survival of mainland &quot;Gallinula mortierii&quot; to as late as about 1500 BC.

&quot;&quot;G.&quot; disneyi&quot; was yet another flightless native hen, indicative of that group&#x27;s rather basal position among moorhens. Its time and place of occurrence suggest it as an ancestor of &quot;G. mortierii (reperta)&quot;, from which it differed mostly in its much smaller size. However, some limb bone proportions are also strikingly different, and in any case such a scenario would require a flightless bird to change but little during some 20 million years in an environment rich in predators. As the fossils of &quot;G. disneyi&quot; as well as the rich recent and subfossil material of &quot;G. mortierii&quot; shows no evidence of such a change at all, &quot;&quot;G.&quot; disneyi&quot; more probably represents a case of parallel evolution at an earlier date, as signified by its placement in &quot;Australlus&quot;.

<doc id="512446" wikidata="Q727210" url="?curid=512446" title="Asiago cheese">
<text>Asiago ( , , ) is a cow&#x27;s milk cheese, first produced in Asiago in Italy, that can assume different textures according to its aging, from smooth for the fresh Asiago (called , which means &quot;pressed Asiago&quot;) to a crumbly texture for the aged cheese (, which means &quot;breeding farm Asiago&quot;). The aged cheese is often grated in salads, soups, pastas, and sauces while the fresh Asiago is sliced to prepare &quot;panini&quot; or sandwiches; it can also be melted on a variety of dishes and cantaloupe. It is classified as a Swiss-type or Alpine cheese.

Asiago is produced in multiple countries around the world including Italy, the U.S. and Australia.

In Italy, Asiago has a protected designation of origin ( or DOP, see below), as Asiago was originally produced around the alpine area of the Asiago plateau, in the regions of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige. Asiago cheese is one of the most typical products of the Veneto region. It was, and still is, the most popular cheese in the DOP area where it is produced. The DOP production area is strictly defined: It starts from the meadows of the Po Valley and finishes in the Alpine pastures between the Asiago plateau and the Trentino&#x27;s highlands. The DOP designated area where the milk is collected and Asiago DOP cheese is produced extends to four provinces in the north-east of Italy: the entire area of Vicenza and Trento and part of the provinces of Padua and Treviso. Asiago cheese which is produced and matured in dairies located more than above sea level, using milk from farms also more than above sea level, is entitled to the additional label &quot;Product of the Mountains&quot;.

Over time, production of asiago was initiated in other countries as well, particularly those with a history of notable immigration from Italy. As such, production of the cheese has spread around the globe and the term &quot;asiago&quot; describes a style of cheese that can be produced anywhere.

==History==
Between the 10th and 15th centuries, sheep raising was the predominant agricultural activity in the Asiago plateau – which was known for its pastures – the purpose of which was the production of savory cheeses (originally called &quot;Pegorin&quot;), and wool production, destined for the textile works of the near valley (Valdagno, Schio, Piovene Rocchette). In the 1700s Asiago production was expanded to surrounding areas; by the 18th and 19th centuries during long maturation Asiago d&#x27;Allevo was produced. It wasn&#x27;t until the early 1900s that the shorter maturation Asiago Pressato was produced.

Bartolomeo Platina wrote &quot;goat&#x27;s milk is excellent, ewe&#x27;s milk is next, with cow&#x27;s milk is in third place&quot;.

Asiago was introduced into the United States by Italian immigrants in the 1920s and became well known in the late 20th and early 21st centuries for its use in shredded cheese blends and as a topping on the eponymous &quot;asiago bagel&quot;.

==Varieties and production==
===Pressed Asiago===
This type is produced by using fresh whole milk. The first step is heating milk at . Specific enzymes, like rennet and lipase, are then added as liquid solution and the milk starts to coagulate. The curd is kneaded and partially cooked. The curd is broken into many little pieces (of the size of a nut), whereupon the curd is cooked again at approximately . Later, this mixture is poured into molds with perforated walls; afterwards there is a first dry salting and then the mold is squeezed with a press, usually hydraulic, for about four hours. Then the rounds are wrapped laterally with plastic bands (which put the brand Asiago around the entire form) and are placed in a room called &quot;Frescura&quot; for two to three days to dry.
At this point the bands are removed to allow one last curing by a bath in brine for a period of two days. Then the forms are allowed to rest in a dry environment for a period ranging from 20 to 40 days. The finished cheese has a cylindrical shape with a diameter of and height about . The average weight of a wheel is . The rind is thin and elastic; the paste inside is soft, buttery, white or slightly yellowish.

===Asiago d&#x27;Allevo===

This type is produced by using a mixture of whole milk and skimmed milk. First the raw milk is heated to about and rennet and enzymes are added as a liquid solution to make it coagulate. The batter obtained is then kneaded and partially cooked; the curd is broken into many small parts (of the size of a grain of rice). At this stage there are two other firings: to . The paste is removed from the heat and stirred with a large whisk, then the curd is extracted and placed into molds lined with cheese cloth for forming. It is divided up and left to rest for a couple of hours on a draining table and then the cheese is turned several times. Next, in the pre-salting stage, the last whey is removed and the DOP logo is impressed onto the side. This process takes a couple of days (at least 48 hours) and during this time the wheels are turned several times. The cheese is then salted in one of two ways, either by spreading salt over the surface of the cheese or by soaking it in brine. The last step is the ageing process, which lasts at least 60 days and must take place within the area of origin, and is done in warehouses where the storage temperature and relative humidity are meticulously controlled (optimal values are and 80-85%).

According to the duration of ageing, Asiago d&#x27;Allevo is classified as follows:
* &quot;Asiago Mezzano&quot; (middle Asiago): 4 to 6 months of aging; compact paste, straw-colored and sweetish taste.
* &quot;Asiago Vecchio&quot; (old Asiago): 10 to 16 months of aging; hard paste, straw-colored and bitter taste.
* &quot;Asiago Stravecchio&quot; (very old Asiago): more than 15 or more months of aging; very hard and grainy paste, amber-colored with a bitter and spicy taste.

===Protected designation of origin===
Within the EU, Asiago cheese is an Italian D.O.P. product (Denominazione di Origine Protetta), equivalent to a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). This simply means that the product can be considered as &quot;authentic&quot; by European law if and only if it is produced in its specific origin area, and according to a specific regime, known as the &quot;Disciplinare di produzione&quot;. The EU law does not apply outside the European Union. Previously it had enjoyed protected status in a number of European countries with which Italy had bilateral agreements under the &quot;Denominazione d’Origine&quot; awarded by the presidential decree of 21 December 1978 and subsequently modified by the prime-ministerial decree of 3 August 1993 and by the ministerial decree of 6 June 1995, under which the current &quot;Disciplinare&quot; came into force.

=== Generic nature of Asiago ===
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has ruled clearly and repeatedly that asiago is a generic term, citing widespread use of the term by multiple companies to describe a type of cheese, not a unique product produced solely in Italy. In 2019, the Consorzio Tutela Formaggio Asiago abandoned efforts to trademark &quot;asiago&quot; in the United States following the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office&#x27;s rejection of a trademark application on the grounds that &quot;asiago&quot; is a generic term. Similar efforts to trademark the term &quot;asiago&quot; have been struck down by IP Australia in 2018.

<text>USS &quot;Leary&quot; (DD-158) was a in the United States Navy during World War II. She was named for Lieutenant Clarence F. Leary, posthumously awarded the Navy Cross in World War I.

Commissioned in 1919, she saw a number of fleet exercises and training cruises, as well as a period of decommissioning from 1922 to 1930. With the outbreak of World War II, she escorted a number of convoys to Iceland, the Caribbean, and west Africa to support the war effort, later being upgraded to serve as an anti-submarine warfare vessel. On 24 December 1943, while escorting through rough seas in the North Atlantic, she was torpedoed three times by the and sank with the loss of 98 men.

== Design and construction ==
&quot;Leary&quot; was one of 111 s built by the United States Navy between 1917 and 1919. She, along with nine of her sisters, were constructed at New York Shipbuilding Corporation shipyards in Camden, New Jersey using specifications and detail designs drawn up by Bethlehem Steel.

She had a standard displacement of an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . On trials, &quot;Leary&quot; reached a speed of . She was armed with four 4&quot;/50 caliber guns, two 3&quot;/23 caliber guns, and twelve  torpedo tubes. She had a regular crew complement of 176 officers and enlisted men. She was driven by two Curtis steam turbines powered by four Yarrow boilers.

Specifics on &quot;Leary&quot;″s performance are not known, but she was one of the group of &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers known unofficially as the &#x27;Liberty Type&#x27; to differentiate them from the destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by Bath Iron Works, which used Parsons or Westinghouse turbines. The &#x27;Liberty&#x27; type destroyers deteriorated badly in service, and in 1929 all 60 of this group were retired by the Navy. Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in fuel economy, with most only able to make at instead of the design standard of at . The class also suffered problems with turning and weight.

She was the first ship to be named for Clarence F. Leary. A subsequent would be commissioned, this one a completed in 1945.

==Service history==
&quot;Leary&quot; was laid down on 6 March 1918 and launched on 18 December 1918. She was sponsored by Mrs. Anne Leary, the mother of Clarence F. Leary. She was commissioned on 5 December 1919.

She departed Boston on 28 January 1920, underwent her shakedown cruise in the Caribbean and then conducted training operations along the East Coast of the United States. In January 1921, she joined the Pacific Battle Fleet, and through February took part in a large-scale battle exercise off the coast of Peru. In March, &quot;Leary&quot; transited the Panama Canal and reported to the commander of Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She then was on station during bombing tests conducted by the U.S. Army Air Forces against naval targets, overseen by Billy Mitchell. She resumed her training exercises off the Caribbean until June 1922, when in accordance with the Washington Naval Conference, she was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Yard.

Recommissioned on 1 May 1930 with a home port in Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Leary&quot; alternated between the Pacific Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet, carrying out training maneuvers and taking part in several fleet problems. After 1935, most of her time was taken up conducting training cruises for reserves and midshipmen. In April 1937, she underwent a shipyard overhaul, including being equipped with a radar. &quot;Leary&quot; was the first U.S. navy vessel to be equipped with the device. This was a temporary, month long experimental installation.

In September 1939, &quot;Leary&quot; and established a continuous patrol off the coast of New England against German U-boats. On 9 September 1941, she began escort missions to Iceland. DANFS reports that she was also the first to make radar contact with a German U-boat, while escorting a British convoy in the North Atlantic on 17–25 November 1941. This is at odds with her overhaul at the New York Navy Yard in November. This was a yard period where she was rearmed, and might have actually had radar installed. For her to have made contact in the North Atlantic sometime in mid November, then return for an extensive yard period, with plans dated November 29, is unlikely. She is supposedly out on another convoy run on December 4.

With the entry of the United States into World War II following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Leary&quot; undertook regular convoy escort duties. After 26 February 1942, she spent a year escorting convoys from a mid-ocean meeting point to Icelandic ports. On 7 February 1943, she left for Boston and reassignment. During this time, she was given a shipyard overhaul at Boston Navy Yard and converted into an anti-submarine warfare ship. On 1 March, she left Boston for Guantanamo Bay, and undertook anti-submarine exercises with . She then resumed escort duty, and made several trips to Trinidad and several Caribbean ports. Returning to New York on 25 June, she began escorting transatlantic convoys, and successfully escorted two of them through Aruba and to Algiers and Casablanca. She later joined Task Group 21.41 under the command of Captain Arnold J. Isbell and escorting .

On 24 December 1943, the task group was caught in a storm in the North Atlantic when at 01:58 in the morning, &quot;Leary&quot; made a ping on a U-boat off her starboard bow. After her commander, James E. Kyes, ordered her to battle stations but before the destroyer could react, she was struck by a G7es torpedo fired by the . The torpedo struck her starboard side and detonated in the after engine room, killing all of the men there and damaging both propeller shafts. She quickly developed a 20 degree list to starboard, and was unable to move in the heavy seas. Unbeknownst to the task group, a second German submarine, fired at &quot;Leary&quot; but missed. Soon after, Kyes ordered the crew to abandon ship. Two additional torpedoes from &quot;U-275&quot; rocked the ship, and it rapidly sank, stern first. She took 98 men with her, including Kyes. Survivors were picked up by her sister ship, .

Three or four minutes after the second torpedo hit, the executive officer, Lt. R. B. Watson, concluded a quick inspection of the ship, during which he found a thick, gooey substance covering the deck. He was astonished to see two seamen sitting on a torpedo tube, calmly eating Boston cream pie. The cook had just baked a batch, the explosion spattering most of it on the deck.

&quot;Leary&quot; received one battle star for her service in World War II. For his actions in ensuring the safety of his crew, Kyes was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. The &quot;Gearing&quot;-class destroyer was later named for him.

<doc id="512449" wikidata="Q182223" url="?curid=512449" title="Maroon 5">
<text>Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California. It consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Adam Levine, rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Jesse Carmichael, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton, and bassist Sam Farrar. Original members Levine, Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara&#x27;s Flowers in 1994, while they were in high school. 

After self-releasing their independent album &quot;We Like Digging?&quot;, the band signed to Reprise Records and released the album &quot;The Fourth World&quot; in 1997. The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college. In 2001, the band re-emerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding guitarist Valentine. The band signed with Octone Records, an independent record label with a separate joint venture relationship with J Records and released their debut album &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; in June 2002. Aided by the hit singles &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;, &quot;This Love&quot; and &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot;, the album peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and went quadruple platinum in 2005. In the same year, the band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. In 2006, Dusick left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn.

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Soon Before Long&quot; was released in May 2007. It debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and the lead single &quot;Makes Me Wonder&quot;, became the band&#x27;s first number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 2010, the band released their third album &quot;Hands All Over&quot;, to favorable reviews, re-releasing a year later to include the single &quot;Moves like Jagger&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 2012, Carmichael left the group and was replaced by musician PJ Morton, as the band released the fourth album &quot;Overexposed&quot;, with the song &quot;One More Night&quot;, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for nine consecutive weeks.

In 2014, Carmichael rejoined the band alongside Morton to record the fifth album &quot;V&quot; (roman numeral pronounced &quot;five&quot;), with the band signed to Interscope Records and Levine&#x27;s own label 222 Records. Following the release of &quot;V&quot;, it reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 2016, Maroon 5 recruited their long-time collaborator Sam Farrar, as the band continued for the sixth studio album &quot;Red Pill Blues&quot;, which was released in November 2017. With the addition of Morton and Farrar, the band&#x27;s lineup increased to seven members. The successful singles of both albums &quot;Sugar&quot; and &quot;Girls Like You&quot; peaked at numbers two and one on the Hot 100 chart respectively. Madden announced his departure from the band in 2020 following his arrest on domestic violence charges, with Farrar becoming their new bassist. The band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Jordi&quot;, was released in June 2021. Maroon 5 has sold more than 120 million records, making them one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists. In January 2023, it was announced &quot;Moves like Jagger&quot; is the second most downloaded song of all time.

== History ==
=== 1994–2001: Kara&#x27;s Flowers and the formation of Maroon 5 ===
Adam Levine was introduced to Ryan Dusick by a mutual friend and guitarist, Adam Salzman. Levine was 15 years old, and Dusick was 16. Three of the five members of the band started playing together at age 12. The four original members of the band met while attending Brentwood School in Los Angeles. While attending Brentwood School, Levine and Jesse Carmichael joined with Mickey Madden and Dusick to form Kara&#x27;s Flowers, a rock band. The name was taken from a girl that went to their high school that the band had a &quot;collective crush&quot; on. The band independently released an album, &quot;We Like Digging?&quot;, in late 1994. The band would play many shows through the next few years, and would also record their official debut. While they were playing a beach party in Malibu, independent producer Tommy Allen heard them play and offered to manage them and record a complete record with his partner, songwriter John DeNicola, who is known for his work on &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; (1987)including &quot;(I&#x27;ve Had) The Time of My Life&quot;. Producer Rob Cavallo&#x27;s management team heard the record Allen and DeNicola produced, which eventually led Cavallo to offer them a deal with Reprise Records, re-recording the album. However, after the release of &quot;The Fourth World&quot;, during Levine and Madden&#x27;s senior year of high school in 1997, it had morphed into a band with a style reminiscent of 1960s Britpop. Despite high expectations from the band and record company, the album failed to catch on and their lead single, &quot;Soap Disco&quot;, was a failure. According to Levine, the failure of the album was &quot;a huge disappointment&quot; that nearly led them to break up. The album sold around 5,000 copies and the band was dropped after six months.

Between 2000 and 2001, the band would play very sporadic shows, due to the members going to college. Dusick and Madden attended college locally at University of California, Los Angeles, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the East coast to attend Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote. Although their band, Kara&#x27;s Flowers, lost the 2000 UCLA Spring Sing competition, the competition was stiff, since the overall winner was Sara Bareilles.

When the band returned in 2001, they brought those influences with them. Frequent collaborator and future member Sam Farrar (then only the bassist of the band Phantom Planet) explained that the Aaliyah song &quot;Are You That Somebody?&quot; affected the band and influenced the song &quot;Not Coming Home&quot;. Producer Tim Sommer signed them to a demo deal with MCA Records and produced three tracks with them in Los Angeles in the middle of 2001, with Mark Dearnley engineering. Against Sommer&#x27;s advice, MCA declined to pick up the band, and these tracks were never released. The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before acquired by Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman and David Boxenbaum. While looking for talent for the Octone label, Berkman was given a bunch of demos by the brother of a former colleague at Columbia Records and the song that caught his attention was Sunday Morning which he referred to as a &quot;genius song&quot;. Berkman was surprised the song was credited to Kara&#x27;s Flowers, because the band sounded completely different from the one he had heard while at Warner Bros. Records.

Berkman encouraged Diener and Boxenbaum to fly out to Los Angeles to watch a showcase gig at The Viper Room for the four-piece Kara&#x27;s Flowers. After watching Levine onstage, they were convinced. Berkman believed what the band needed was a &quot;fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer, so he could be the star I perceived him to be&quot;. Octone insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past. The label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from the L.A. band Square) was recruited. On his joining the band, Valentine commented: &quot;I became friends with them and we sort of started jamming together, it was very much like I was cheating on my band, we were having sort of an affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them.&quot; After hearing Levine play, Valentine noticed his affinity for Phish and the two musicians bonded over the band. After briefly being known as simply &quot;Maroon&quot;, the band changed their name to &quot;Maroon 5&quot;. In an interview with Howard Stern, Levine revealed that the only person outside of the band to know the story behind the name change is Billy Joel.

=== 2002–2006: &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; and Dusick&#x27;s departure ===

James Valentine attended Berklee College of Music with John Mayer in 1996, where they developed a rapport. In 2002, the two reconnected at a Mayer radio broadcast. After Mayer heard their album, he was so impressed (particularly by &quot;This Love&quot;, which became the most successful release off the album) that he invited them to open for him during his early 2003 tour. The first single, &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;, slowly started to pick up airplay which helped sales of the album. By March 2004, the album had reached the Top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; had made the Top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles charts. The album peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in September 2004, 26 months after its release; this was the longest period between an album&#x27;s release and its initial Top 10 appearance since SoundScan results were included in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 1991. The album went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide. Mayer invited the band to open for him again in 2004. Over the next three years, the band toured, including visits to seventeen countries. During this time, the band toured with Michelle Branch, Graham Colton, and the Rolling Stones.

At the start of their Overexposed Tour in South America, Maroon 5 introduced the newest addition in the band to the audience: their old and close friend Sam Farrar on guitars, occasionally on the bass guitar, percussion, additional keyboards, backing vocals and providing samples and other special effects (using the MPC). Farrar co-wrote and co-produced a few of the band&#x27;s songs on almost all of their studio albums and also remixed their song &quot;Woman&quot; on &quot;Call and Response: The Remix Album&quot;, released in 2008 (from the &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; soundtrack). On August 31, 2012 – during a show in Argentina – Farrar filled-in for Mickey Madden on the bass guitar for the first time – he subsequently filled-in for Madden on the next few shows of the tour. In July 2012, Maroon 5 began to work on the upcoming fifth studio album, after the commercial success of &quot;Overexposed&quot; and on October 10, 2012, Jesse Carmichael confirmed that he would be returning to the band after they complete their Overexposed Tour and will rejoin in time to record their fifth studio album.

=== 2013–2016: &quot;V&quot;, return of Carmichael and lineup changes ===

In April 2013, James Valentine said the band was in the studio recording songs for the fifth album: &quot;The stuff we&#x27;re working on now, it definitely has gone maybe a little darker in its sound, maybe back a little bit more to what we kind of did on &quot;Songs About Jane&quot;, but at this point, we do have all kinds of different songs and it is early&quot;. The band announced it would headline the 2013 Honda Civic Tour, with special guest Kelly Clarkson. The tour began on August 1, and concluded on October 6, 2013, comprising 33 dates.

On April 15, 2014, Jesse Carmichael confirmed that his hiatus from the band was complete and he reunited with the band in time to record for the album.

Later, the band performed at the Grammy Awards&#x27; Christmas special, titled &quot;A Very Grammy Christmas&quot; on December 5, 2014, and at the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour 2014 on December 12, 2014.

On February 3, 2019, Maroon 5 headlined the Super Bowl LIII halftime show in Atlanta, Georgia, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, with American rappers Big Boi and Travis Scott. The band&#x27;s decision was controversial, because other musicians, including Cardi B and Rihanna, refused to perform.

== Musical style and influences ==
Maroon 5&#x27;s musical style has generally been regarded as pop, pop rock, funk rock, dance-pop, blue-eyed soul, neo soul, soft rock, and indie rock. Adam Levine has stated: &quot;Everything that&#x27;s written and performed and put together pretty much comes from us. I just think people would be surprised to know that we&#x27;re a self-contained unit. We&#x27;re a band that does their own thing. There&#x27;s no puppet master.&quot; However, in an article about the songwriter and producer Benny Blanco, it is revealed that at least some of the band&#x27;s songs, such as &quot;Moves like Jagger,&quot; are the product of efforts by or collaborations with, professional songwriters and producers. In the same article, Levine says, &quot;It&#x27;s almost as if [Benny Blanco] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the right time to create a musical moment. He&#x27;s about collaboration. And he&#x27;s so good at nailing down who does everything best.&quot;

Adam Levine cited Britpop band Oasis as &quot;one of the best bands ever&quot; and said &quot;We love Oasis&quot;. The band has cited Michael Jackson, The Beatles, The Police, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, the Bee Gees, Tonic, Prince, Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye as influences. Levine has also cited Billy Joel as an influence. Furthermore, guitarist James Valentine said he was influenced by guitarists like Pat Metheny, Bill Frisell and John Scofield, as well as the rock band Queens of the Stone Age. The band&#x27;s songs tend to be very guitar-heavy, often accompanied by piano or synthesizer. The theme in most of their songs is love, frequently lost love; songs like &quot;This Love&quot;, &quot;Makes Me Wonder&quot; and &quot;Misery&quot; have a very cynical tone, often expressing dissatisfaction with a relationship, while their more heartfelt and emotional songs such as &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Never Gonna Leave This Bed&quot; express a longing for a romantic relationship. &quot;Makes Me Wonder&quot; has a secondary theme, in which Levine expresses his disillusionment and frustration with the state of American politics and the Iraq War.

The band&#x27;s style changes from album to album. &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; consists of songs about Levine&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Jane Herman. On &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Soon Before Long&quot; the songs are less personal and are more electric with more use of synthesizers, creating a retro feel. &quot;Hands All Over&quot; continues the band&#x27;s lost love theme, along with songs about infatuation and was re-released in 2011, with the hit single &quot;Moves like Jagger&quot;, an electropop song which represents a drastic change in the band&#x27;s sound, with more of a dance feel to it. &quot;It was one of those songs that was definitely a risk&quot;, Levine said. &quot;It&#x27;s a bold statement. We&#x27;ve never really released a song like that. But it&#x27;s exciting to do something different, do something new. I&#x27;m just glad that everyone likes it.&quot; James Valentine called &quot;Overexposed&quot; &quot;our most &#x27;pop&#x27; record ever and we weren&#x27;t shy about really going for it&quot;. They also have experimented with new wave and disco sounds on several albums.

== Controversies ==
In an interview with &quot;Variety&quot; in November 2018, the frontman of the band, Adam Levine, when asked if the band is pop, rock or urban, said, &quot;Something unique to this band is that we have always looked to hip-hop, R&amp;B, all rhythmic forms of music, from back when we were writing our first album to now. Rock music is nowhere, really. I don&#x27;t know where it is. If it&#x27;s around, no one&#x27;s invited me to the party. All of the innovation and the incredible things happening in music are in hip-hop&quot;. This statement prompted widespread criticism from rock fans and some rock stars. Despite this backlash, the band saw a continued increase in popularity and commercial success in 2018, leading them to become one of the world&#x27;s best-selling pop bands. The band mostly collaborates with hip hop artists and creates primarily pop music.

On February 27, 2020, the band performed at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival in Chile. The performance, which began 29 minutes late, was listed as &quot;mediocre&quot; by part of the press. Mark Savage of BBC News said that Levine performed the songs with a &quot;lack of energy&quot; and was &quot;out of tune&quot;, adding that the disappointment of some fans increased when videos were leaked. The videos showed Levine when he was leaving the stage, angry and saying that &quot;they were deceived&quot;, &quot;that was a TV show! ... that was not a concert&quot;, and that Viña del Mar is a &quot;shitty city,&quot; sparking criticism. Levine later posted on Instagram to apologize for the incident, and the band said they had experienced technical difficulties with the audio feed to Levine&#x27;s in-ear monitors.

<text>USS &quot;Palmer&quot; (DD-161) was a of the United States Navy, later converted to a minesweeper and reclassified as DMS-5. She was named for Rear Admiral James Shedden Palmer USN (1810–1867).

&quot;Palmer&quot; was laid down on 29 May 1918 by Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts. The ship was launched on 18 August 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Robert C. Hilliard, and commissioned on 22 November 1918.

==Service history==
Assigned to the Pacific Fleet, &quot;Palmer&quot; joined in fleet operations until decommissioning at San Diego on 31 May 1922. There she was in reserve until recommissioning on 7 August 1940. Converted to a minesweeper with the designation DMS–5 on 19 November, she returned to the Atlantic and joined Mine Division 19 (MinDiv 19) out of Norfolk, Virginia for escort duty in the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. She sortied on 24 October 1942, screening Task Force 34 (TF 34) to the invasion of North Africa, arriving on 7 November off Fedala, where she made an exploratory sweep before taking station in the anti-submarine screen. The next day, &quot;Palmer&quot; seized the French trawler &quot;Joseph Elise&quot;, and engaged an enemy shore battery.

&quot;Palmer&quot; served on patrol and escort off North Africa until 12 December, and then returned to Atlantic escort duty through 1943, plying coastal, Caribbean and Northwestern Atlantic routes. Ordered to the Pacific, she trained out of San Diego, and then joined Task Force 53 at Pearl Harbor, sailing with it on 22 January 1944 for the assault on Kwajalein. &quot;Palmer&quot; remained in the Marshalls until 12 February laying buoys and screening transports, then made escort voyages to Pearl Harbor and Majuro.

Preceding the invasion force by two days, &quot;Palmer&quot; arrived off Saipan for a five-hour sweep on 13 June, and then screened transports during the amphibious landings. Screening duty to Eniwetok caused her to miss the Battle of the Philippine Sea, but she returned to Saipan for screening duties from 22 June–8 July.

&quot;Palmer&quot; arrived off Guam on 22 July, the day after the island was invaded, to screen transports off Apra for five days. Returning to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Palmer&quot; prepared for the return to the Philippines, a vast operation in which the aging converted destroyers would once again prove themselves. Staging at Manus, her force arrived in Leyte Gulf on 17 October to sweep the main channels and transport areas during the three days before the landings. After escorting the transports through the safe channels, the minesweepers made a quick sweep in Surigao Strait, then returned to Manus on 23 October, the eve of the Battle for Leyte Gulf.

===Fate===
Replenished, &quot;Palmer&quot; cleared Manus on 23 December for Lingayen Gulf, where she was to repeat the successful operations carried out at Leyte. Harassed en route by enemy ships and planes, &quot;Palmer&quot; and her force successfully penetrated Lingayen Gulf early on 7 January 1945, and began their sweep under enemy air attack. At about 15:45, a violent explosion occurred, knocking out &quot;Palmer&quot;″s port low-pressure turbine. She began recovering sweeping gear and left formation to make repairs. At 18:40, a Japanese twin-engine bomber flew low overhead and dropped two bombs, which hit portside. A huge fire, threatening the magazines, billowed skyward, and &quot;Palmer&quot; sank in six minutes. Of her crew, two were killed, 38 wounded, and 26 missing in action.

==Awards==
&quot;Palmer&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

, no other ship in the US Navy has been named &quot;Palmer&quot;.

<text>Knight&#x27;s Armament Company (KAC) is an American firearms and firearms parts manufacturer, known for producing the Rail Interface System (RIS) and the Rail Adapter System (RAS) grips for firearms use. The company produces a variety of firearms, including AR-15-style rifles.

KAC is owned by C. Reed Knight and is based in Titusville, Florida. Knight&#x27;s Manufacturing Company (KMC) is the division of KAC responsible for producing products for the civilian market.

==History==

The United States military, as well as other special forces and police around the world, use KAC RIS/RAS conversions for many popular firearms, including the American M16/M4 rifles and Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 series submachine guns. The RIS/RAS system allows for the mounting of accessories to firearms without additional tools or modifications. The system is utilized alongside a KAC suppressor and forward grip on the &quot;Special Operations Peculiar MODification&quot; (SOPMOD) M4 carbine package in use by United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). The mounted accessories can include tactical flashlights, laser targeting units, bipods, and vertical foregrips.

KAC produces sound suppressors for the Heckler &amp; Koch Mark 23 SOCOM pistol. KAC also produces a line of clip-on night vision and thermal weapon sights, including the AN/PVS-22 Universal Night Sight. KAC produces mounts for optics and grenade launchers, as well as backup iron sights.

Knight&#x27;s Armament produces a line of firearms including the semi-automatic SR-15 line of rifles, the fully automatic SR-16 carbine, the semi-automatic SR-25 sniper rifle, the SR-25 based Mark 11 Mod 0 Sniper Weapon System, and the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System. KAC designed and produces the Knight&#x27;s Armament Company PDW and also produces the Stoner LMG in limited quantities. In 2011, KAC released the SR15/SR16 E3 line of rifles.

In September 2023, the company was selected to provide the Knight&#x27;s Stoner 1 variant of its SR-16 rifle to the British Army Special Operations Brigade and to the Royal Marines.

<text>TasWireless is a group of wireless networking enthusiasts in Tasmania, Australia. Between them they have set up wireless community networks in both Hobart and Launceston. The group has gone through many names, tas.air, www.tas.air.net.au, TPAN (Tasmanian Public Airwave Network) and now TasWireless.

With users from several different backgrounds, including computer networking, amateur radio, amateur television, programming, Linux/BSD server administration, antenna and satellite dish installations, and lots more, they are willing to assist with any community networks in any part of the state.

==Introduction ==
The TasWireless site was first started in 1999. It started as a splitter group from TasLUG, the Tasmanian Linux Users Group. There was only a small number of people who were interested in wireless networking at this time, less than five each in Hobart and Launceston. A node database () for Tasmanian regions was started, the mailing list was put on line, but due to the lack of practical experience and knowledge, very little happened. The cost of Wi-Fi cards and wireless access points was also a problem.
In early 2002, a flood of cheap SkyNet Global 802.11b PC card cards flooded the market. These cards were liquidated stock and cost around A$50-60 each - the average retail price was still around A$200. A lot of these cards were shipped to the state and distributed (both by TasWireless admins and otherwise).

== Wireless networks in Hobart ==
The predominant network in Hobart is called StarNet. This was started as a private network by a small group of amateur radio enthusiasts, around April 2002. It included around six or seven sites.

In April 2003, an operator of the TasWireless website stumbled upon one of their nodes, with SSID &quot;StarNet&quot;, and posted his find to the mailing list.

As a result, all users involved were able to share knowledge and make some minor changes to the network routing.
Another network &quot;RexNet&quot;, based in Kingston was also found; they had already been working with the StarNet group to eventually join the networks.

In mid-2003, various 802.11b wireless access points appeared on the market at low prices - Svec and Minitar brand access points were selling for around $100. This made setting up nodes easier, as the compatibility issues between various brands of PCI cradles, PC cards, and operating systems caused some problems.

By the start of March 2004, there were around 25 nodes on &quot;StarNet&quot;, reaching from Tea Tree, Otago, Rosetta, Lutana, Glenorchy, Moonah, Lindisfarne, Lenah Valley, Bellerive, Acton, Tranmere, Sandy Bay and Kingston.

== Wireless networks in Launceston ==
Wireless networks in Launceston were a lot slower to take off than in Hobart, but is to be expected with a smaller population. Several small peer-to-peer links were tested, but no major infrastructure was rolled out.

At the end of January 2004, two groups appeared, around the same time. One group was unnamed (though was working under the TasWireless name), the other was called TasGrid.

Both groups currently have two major access points each with around 10-12 nodes being on each. Neither group appears to be very active at the present time.

Launceston Wireless has started forming some connections to hopefully create a working citywide public network

== Wireless networks in the north-west ==
There are several people who have expressed interest in a wireless network on the north-west coast of Tasmania - however no networks currently exist.

<doc id="512461" wikidata="Q1794018" url="?curid=512461" title="Royal standards of Canada">
<text>The royal standards of Canada are a set of heraldic flags used by members of the Canadian royal family to denote the presence of the bearer within any vehicle, building, or area within Canada or when representing Canada abroad. All are based on a escutcheon of the coat of arms of Canada, the arms of dominion of the Canadian monarch. 

The standard of the Canadian monarch&#x27;s is simply the escutcheon of the coat of arms in banner form. The standards belonging to the Prince of Wales; Princess Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, are differentiated by heraldic labels and roundels with personal identifiers within. A standard with an ermine border is used by remaining royal family members that do not have a personal flag created for use in Canada.

The first standard was created for Queen Elizabeth II in 1962. The current flag for the Canadian monarch was unveiled on 6 May 2023, the day of King Charles III&#x27;s coronation. The flags are part of a larger collection of Canadian royal symbols.

==Current standards==
There are several standards created by the Canadian Heraldic Authority to are currently in use by the Canadian monarch, the Prince of Wales, and other members of the Canadian royal family.

===Sovereign===

The Sovereign’s Flag for Canada (also called the Sovereign’s personal Canadian flag and the Royal Standard of Canada) is the banner of arms of the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada, and is used to denote the presence of the Canadian monarch. The flag consists of the escutcheon of the coat of arms, namely the quartered arms of the kingdoms of England, Scotland, Ireland, and France above three maple leaves on a silver background. The official blazon of the royal arms is:

The standard was created by the Canadian Heraldic Authority in 2023 for Charles III in his capacity as King of Canada. The standard was approved in April 2023, shortly after Charles III&#x27;s ascension, and was unveiled on his coronation day, 6 May 2023. The standard is protected under Canada&#x27;s Trademarks Act.

Queen Elizabeth II, the monarch preceding King Charles III, had used a personal Canadian standard that incorporated the Canadian banner of arms, charged with her personal badge from 1962 to her death in 2022. However, Elizabeth II&#x27;s Canadian standard was personal to her, while the Sovereign&#x27;s Flag was designed for use by Charles III and all future Canadian monarchs.

===Prince of Wales===

The flag of The Prince of Wales for personal use in Canada is a personal standard that is used to denote the presence of the prince, currently William. Use of the banner of the Royal Arms of Canada in the personal flag symbolizes the Prince of Wales is the heir to the Canadian Crown. 

The standard is made up of the banner of arms of Canada, charged with a blue disc or roundel within a wreath of golden maple leaves. The disc features the Prince of Wales&#x27; feathers, a symbol commonly used by the heir apparent. The traditional heraldic marker to denote an eldest son is placed near the top of the banner, a three-point white heraldic label. The initial concept for the design was done by Claire Boudreau, the Chief Herald of Canada, with assistance from other heralds of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, and with the co-operation of Buckingham Palace officials.

The Prince of Wales&#x27; personal Canadian flag was approved for use by Elizabeth II through Letters Patent dated 31 May 2011, and gazetted in the Canada Gazette on 24 March 2012. The personal standard was unveiled to the public on 29 June 2011, alongside the personal flag for Prince William (then known as the Duke of Cambridge) prior to his 2011 royal tour of Canada.

===Other royal family members with personal flags===
In addition to the Sovereign and the Prince of Wales, there are several other Canadian royal family members who have a personal Canadian standards made specifically for them by the Canadian Heraldic Authority. this includes Anne, Princess Royal, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh. 

These personal flags follow a standard pattern similar to the Prince of Wales&#x27; Canadian standard unveiled in 2011, consisting of a banner of arms of the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada, differenced by a silver heraldic label and, in the centre, a blue roundel with a border of 24 gold maple leaves. The roundels for these specific personal flags contain the bearer&#x27;s cypher—the initial of their first name surmounted by a coronet to signify them as children of the monarch. On the labels, all taken from the holder&#x27;s personal coats of arms, Anne&#x27;s has a red heart on the centre point and red crosses on the outer points, Andrew&#x27;s has a blue anchor on the centre point, and Edward&#x27;s has a Tudor rose on the centre point. The initial concept for these designs were done by Claire Boudreau, the Chief Herald of Canada, with assistance from other heralds of the Canadian Heraldic Authority. 

The personal flag for Princess Anne, was approved for use by Queen Elizabeth II on 8 May 2013, while the personal flags for Prince Andrew and Prince Edward were approved by the Queen on 15 May 2014. 

===Flag for royal family members without personal flags===

The flag for members of the royal family for use in Canada denotes the presence of a royal person who does not have their own personal Canadian flag. 

The flag includes the banner of the royal arms of Canada surrounded by an ermine border, a design element also seen on British standards that are used by royal family members without personal flags. The initial concept for the design was done by Claire Boudreau, the Chief Herald of Canada, with assistance from other heralds of the Canadian Heraldic Authority.

This flag was approved for use by Elizabeth II on 20 December 2014, and was gazetted in the Canada Gazette on 3 October 2015.

==Use and protocol==

As the monarch is the personification of the Canadian state, their banner takes precedence above all other flags in Canada, including the national flag and those of the other members of the Canadian royal family.

However, the Sovereign&#x27;s Flag for Canada is usually only employed when he is in Canada or is attending an event abroad as the Canadian head of state; for example, the flag will be unfurled at Juno Beach in France when the sovereign is present there for commemorations of the Normandy Landings. The flag must be broken immediately upon the sovereign&#x27;s arrival and fly day and night until lowered directly after the King&#x27;s departure from any building, ship, aircraft (not in the air), or other space or vehicle. 

No other person may use the flag; the King&#x27;s federal representative, the governor general, possesses a unique personal flag, as does each of the monarch&#x27;s provincial viceroys. Flags are kept at the King&#x27;s Ottawa residence, Rideau Hall, and supplied to Department of Canadian Heritage royal visit staff by the household staff prior to the King&#x27;s arrival.

Protocol is sometimes, though rarely, officially broken. On 9 August 1902, the day of the coronation of King Edward VII, the monarch&#x27;s royal standard (then the same in Canada as in the United Kingdom) was raised on a temporary flag pole at His Majesty&#x27;s Dockyard in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Similarly, for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June 1953, the sovereign&#x27;s royal standard was broken atop the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. Sixty years later, on 6 February 2012, the Queen&#x27;s personal standard for Canada was unfurled at Rideau Hall and Parliament Hill, as well as at other legislatures across the country to mark the monarch&#x27;s diamond anniversary of her accession to the throne; permission to do so was granted by the Queen.

When Police Service Horse Burmese was presented to Queen Elizabeth II by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on 28 April 1969, she requested that Burmese perform in the Royal Windsor Horse Show and have the rider carry the Queen&#x27;s royal standard on the lance, instead of the usual red and white pennon, thus allowing Elizabeth to easily follow Burmese&#x27;s performance.

==History==

Prior to the adoption of the Canadian royal standards, members of the royal family who toured Canada used the royal standard they employed when in the United Kingdom; although, for the 1860 tour undertaken in 1860 by Prince Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), he used the banner of his mother, Queen Victoria. after 1931, each of those standards took on a dual role of representing a member of either the British or the Canadian royal family, depending on the context.

Elizabeth II was the first Canadian monarch to use a standard for her role as Queen of Canada. Adopted in 1962, it is made up of the banner of arms with the Queen&#x27;s personal device in the centre—a blue roundel with a border of gold roses, containing within it a capital &quot;E&quot; surmounted by a crown. It was added to the Canadian Heraldic Authority&#x27;s &quot;Public Register of Arms, Flags, and Badges&quot; on 15 March 2005. Nathan Tidridge argued the introduction of this standard set red and white as the national colours of Canada. However, there is debate over whether the proclamation of the coat of arms in 1921 determined Canada&#x27;s national colours.

The next two personal flags were created for Charles, then-Prince of Wales, and William, then-Duke of Cambridge, and were revealed on 29 June 2011. The creation of the flags made Canada the second Commonwealth realm, after the United Kingdom, to adopt unique flags for members of the royal family. 

William&#x27;s flag consisted of the banner of arms with, in the centre, a blue roundel with a border of 12 gold maple leaves alternating with 12 gold scallops and, within this, his cypher—a &quot;W&quot; surmounted by a coronet of a child of the heir apparent. The label had a red scallop on the centre point. It was first flown from the Canadian Forces airplane that carried him and his wife, Catherine, to Canada in 2011.

Charles&#x27;s flag, which is now used by William as Prince of Wales, was first flown from the Royal Canadian Air Force airplane that carried him and his wife, Camilla, to Canada for a royal tour marking the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2012. 

Additional personal flags were ceated in subsequent years, with the first use of Princess Royal&#x27;s banner occurring during her October 2013 visits to CFB Borden and CFB Kingston. Prince Edward&#x27;s flag was first used on 12 September 2014, during a visit to Government House, British Columbia, with his wife Sophie, as part of a royal tour.

Sean Palmer asserted in the 2018 book, &quot;The Canadian Kingdom: 150 Years of Constitutional Monarchy&quot;, that, by way of creating the uniquely Canadian standards for members of the royal family other than the monarch, Canada took &quot;&#x27;ownership&#x27;, not only of the Queen of Canada, but, of the other members of her family as well&quot;, and that doing so was another formal affirmation of the concept of a Canadian royal family &quot;as distinct as the Queen of Canada is from the Queen of the United Kingdom&quot;. Jai Patel and Sally Raudon also noted the following year that the purpose of these heraldic banners was to recognize the owners&#x27; roles as members of the Canadian royal family.

===Coronation standard===
The coronation of monarchs at Westminster Abbey have included standards from of various countries, carried by officials in a procession into the abbey. The flags carried in for the coronations of King George V in 1911, King George VI in 1937, and Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, were the countries&#x27; banners of arms. The standard carried in by Canadian officials in 1911 was quartered with the arms of the first four Canadian provinces, while the standard carried in for the 1937 and 1953 coronations was based on the escutcheon of the Canadian coat of arms, as devised in 1921. 

The coronation of Charles III saw representatives from the Commonwealth realms carry their respective national flag instead of a banner of arms.

<doc id="512467" wikidata="Q312672" url="?curid=512467" title="Tetricus I">
<text>Gaius Pius Esuvius Tetricus was a Gallo-Roman nobleman who ruled as emperor of the Gallic Empire from 271 to 274 AD. He was originally the (provincial governor) of Gallia Aquitania and became emperor after the murder of Emperor Victorinus in 271, with the support of Victorinus&#x27;s mother, Victoria. During his reign, he faced external pressure from Germanic raiders, who pillaged the eastern and northern parts of his empire, and the Roman Empire, from which the Gallic Empire had seceded. He also faced increasing internal pressure, which led him to declare his son, Tetricus II, in 273 and possibly co-emperor in 274, although this is debated. The Roman emperor Aurelian invaded in 273 or 274, leading to the Battle of Châlons, at which Tetricus surrendered. Whether this capitulation was the result of a secret agreement between Tetricus and Aurelian or that surrender was necessary after his defeat is debated. Aurelian spared Tetricus, and made him a senator and the (governor) of Lucania et Bruttium. Tetricus died of natural causes a few years after 274.

==Historiography==
The primary sources for the Gallic Empire are substandard. According to numismatist Jerome Mairat, the most reliable contemporary sources of the Gallic Empire, are Aurelius Victor and Eutropius, although they are brief and believed to rely upon the hypothetical lost Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte. Historians Nicholson and Casey second this, describing a key source of information as being &quot;brief notices by late 4th-century Latin authors who depended for much of their information on the lost (Enmann&#x27;s History of the Emperors)&quot;. Mairat states that Zosimus and Zonaras both reveal key information regarding the Gallic Empire in short sentences, relying upon the mostly lost works of Dexippus; Nicholson and Casey state more specifically that another main source for Tetricus, in particular, is &quot;scattered allusions&quot; from Zomimus&#x27; first book. Nicholson and Casey further posit another source as being &quot;information gleaned from the rather copious coinage minted by the Gallic emperors&quot;. Lastly, Mairat states that the imperial biographies of the semi-fictional provide a wealth of details regarding the Gallic Empire, with Tetricus being listed as one of the &quot;Thirty Tyrants&quot; within; however, this work is generally unreliable, with Nicholson and Casey stating that it the biographies &quot;interweave fact, invention, and an idiosyncratic sense of humour.&quot; For instance, the states that Tetricus was recognized in Hispania, but modern historians have rejected this.

According to historian John F. Drinkwater, Victor and Eutropius, who form the traditionalist view, cast Tetricus as being a &quot;civilian&quot; rather than a &quot;soldier-emperor&quot;, therefore arguing he was not prepared to rule during a time of emergency, explaining why he was originally posted to Gallic Aquitania during his time as governor, rather than the Rhine. Eutropius states that Tetricus had to suppress rebellion when he first became emperor, which Mairat identifies with the usurper Domitian II, noting that Zosimus provides only that he rose to power at the beginning of Aurelian&#x27;s reign, without providing the area of his rule, but that two coins minted in his name that have been discovered were doubtlessly made in the Gallic mints between 269-274, with the specifics of the coin suggesting a dating of mid 271. Mairat then suggests that Domitian&#x27;s usurpation may have been an uprising of the army, based in the same areas as the mint, against Tetricus due to his civilian origin. However, Drinkwater argues the possibility that this &quot;civilian&quot; tradition is influenced by Emperor Aurelian&#x27;s propaganda and notes that Victoria put forth significant funds to see him made emperor to secure her own position and that Aquitania was a significant province, bordered on all sides by areas (Gallia Narbonensis and Hispania) which were threatened, or had recently been re-conquered by Rome. Drinkwater goes on to state that such a position &quot;must have required considerable ability, both administrative and military&quot;, arguing that he proved himself an able commander against the Germans, and concluding that &quot;The last Gallic emperor should not be dismissed as a lightweight&quot;.

Epigraphic sources also provide some information: however, the epigraphic habit (the use of monumental inscriptions for public display) of the Roman Empire was in decline during the period, and many are undated. Fourteen inscriptions bearing Tetricus&#x27; name have been found in Gaul, although these are broken into two regions by a vertical line of inscriptions bearing Aurelian&#x27;s name, which were made after the surrender of Tetricus; no Tetrican inscriptions overlap with Aurelianic inscriptions. There are another five inscriptions bearing his name that have been discovered in Britannia.

==Background==
The Gallic Empire was a state composed of the Roman provinces which made up Britannia, Hispania, Gaul, and Roman Germania, which broke away from the Roman Empire during the reign of Emperor Gallienus. Gallienus had become emperor after his father, Emperor Valerian, was captured by the Sassanids in 260. Gallienus&#x27;s rule occurred during the Crisis of the Third Century (235–284), a period of intense political and military power struggles. Gallienus was overwhelmed by numerous issues, including several usurpers, as well as attacks in the Balkans and along the Rhine by various tribes. Hispania was also impacted, with raids from the Franks, with historian Lukas De Blois describing the raids against Hispania Baetica as &quot;grievous&quot;, and the city of Tarraco (modern-day Tarragona) being sacked in the 260s, As a result of the threat to the empire, certain governors were appointed as (leader) of an entire border line, including Postumus in 258-259. Because Gallienus was unable to prevent the raids, Postumus rose up and declared himself emperor; at about the same time, he assassinated Saloninus, Gallenius&#x27;s son and co-emperor, in Colonia (modern-day Cologne). Postumus focused on defending the Gallic Empire, and, in the words of the 4th-century Roman historian Eutropius, &quot;restored the almost exhausted provinces through his enormous vigour and moderation.&quot;

Gallienus attempted to invade the Gallic Empire twice, in 260 and 265, but was repulsed both times, forcing him to accept the secession. Although he was unable to conquer the Gallic Empire, Gallienus did ensure that the Roman Empire was defended; he stationed Aureolus, a military commander, in northern Italia, to prevent Postumus from crossing the Alps. Postumus was killed by his soldiers in 269 in Mogontiacum (modern-day Mainz) while putting down a revolt by the usurper Laelianus, because he would not permit them to sack the city. After the army killed Postumus, they elected Marcus Aurelius Marius, an officer, as Gallic emperor. While some Roman historians, such as the 4th-century historians Aurelius Victor and Eutropius, hold that Marius reigned for only two days before being killed by Victorinus, who had served as praetorian prefect (commander of his praetorian guard) under Postumus, the number of coins issued by Marius indicate that he must have served for a longer time, a period of roughly three months. Victorinus declared himself emperor in mid-269 in Augusta Treverorum (modern-day Trier), two days after killing Marius. Victorinus&#x27;s rule was recognized by the provinces of Britannia and Gaul, but not by those of Hispania.

==Life==
===Rise to power===

Gaius Pius Esuvius Tetricus, commonly referred to as Tetricus I, was born in Gaul, on an unknown date, to a noble family of Gallic origin. Little of his early life is known, however, he had become a senator and occupied the post of (provincial governor) of Gallia Aquitania, a province in the southwest of what is now France, by 271. In early 271, emperor Victorinus was murdered in Colonia by Attitianus, an officer in the Gallic army, allegedly because he had seduced Attitianus&#x27;s wife. Because the motivation for his assassination was personal, rather than political, Victorinus&#x27;s mother, Victoria, was able to retain power within the empire; as Drinkwater notes, she was unable to take the throne herself as a woman, and thus selected Tetricus as a candidate, having him appointed by the army after securing their support with large bribes; he further mentions the possibility that Tetricus was related to Victoria and Victorinus, but states that there is no direct support for this. The army proclaimed Tetricus as Gallic emperor in spring of the same year at Burdigala (modern-day Bordeaux). However, Tetricus was not present for the proclamation.

Drinkwater posits that, as he was governor of Gallia Aquitania, Victoria likely reigned for several weeks from Colonia before Tetricus assumed power, possibly issuing coins deifying Victorinus during this period. Mairat argues that, if Tetricus was absent for the proclamation, it is most likely that Victoria did order the minting of the coins, but notes that the coins of Domitian II appear to have been made in the same issue, noting that the coinage may have been created by the Gallic armies, due to political uncertainty regarding succession, or that Victoria may have minted coins in Victorinus&#x27; name, rather than Tetricus&#x27;, for the same reason.

The Gallic Empire mirrored the Roman imperial administrative traditions, and as such each Gallic emperor adopted a Roman regnal title upon his accession; after becoming emperor, Tetricus adopted the regnal name and titles of Imperator Caesar Esuvius Tetricus Pius Felix Invictus Augustus Pontifex Maximus. The Gallic Empire also followed the Roman tradition of emperors appointing themselves as consul, with Tetricus appointing himself as consul in 271, 272, 273, and 274. By Roman custom, there were two consuls per year; however, the names of the other consuls for 271–273 are not known, but it is known that Tetricus&#x27;s son, Tetricus II, served as his colleague in 274. Tetricus was also tribune from 271 to 274. Tetricus elevated Tetricus II as in 273 to increase the legitimacy of his reign by founding a dynasty; he may have also elevated his son to co-emperor during the last days of his reign, but this is uncertain. The semi-fictional , in its biography of emperor Aurelian, states that Tetricus elevated his son at an unspecified date, however, neither Aurelius Victor nor Eutropius mentions such an event.

===Reign===
During Tetricus&#x27;s reign, the main threats to the Gallic Empire came from the Roman Empire and Germanic peoples. Tetricus also had to contend with dissent within the army and government. Tetricus was recognized as emperor by all of Gaul — except Gallia Narbonensis, which had been partially reconquered by Placidianus, a general under Roman emperor Claudius Gothicus — and Britannia. He was not recognized by the provinces of Hispania, including Hispania Baetica, Lusitania, and Hispania Tarraconensis, which had earlier refused to recognize Victorinus as emperor, nor by the city of Argentoratum (modern-day Strasbourg) in Germania. The provinces that did not recognize Tetricus chose instead to recognize Aurelian as Roman emperor, who had been proclaimed emperor in September 270 at Sirmium in Pannonia. By the time of Tetricus&#x27;s rule, the Germanic peoples had become increasingly aggressive, launching raids across the Rhine and along the coast. Tetricus moved the capital of the Gallic Empire from Colonia to Augusta Treverorum in late 271 in order to guard against the Germanic peoples. Tetricus attacked them with some success, mainly during the early part of his reign, celebrating a triumph for one of his victories. Later in his reign, he was forced to withdraw troops and abandon forts, which allowed the border territories to be pillaged. Later Germanic raids were met with almost no opposition — one penetrated so far into Gallic territory that it reached the Loire. While Aurelian was focused on attacking the Palmyrene Empire, which had broken away from the Roman Empire in 270 under its queen, Zenobia, Tetricus was able to recover Gallia Narbonensis and southeastern parts of Gallia Aquitania. During 273–274, Faustinus, provincial governor of Gallia Belgica, rebelled against Tetricus, however, his revolt was swiftly crushed. Around this time, Tetricus also held the , public games that took place every four years.
===Defeat and later life===
After Aurelian had succeeded in his reconquest of the Palmyrene Empire, he turned his attention to the Gallic Empire, beginning preparations for an invasion in 273. In early 274, Aurelian began to march into northern Gaul, while Tetricus led his troops southward from Augusta Treverorum to meet him. The armies of Aurelian and Tetricus met in February or March 274 at the Battle of Châlons, near modern-day Châlons in north-eastern France. The higher discipline of the Roman forces, coupled with the greater military command of Aurelian, tipped the harsh battle in Roman favor, and after Tetricus was captured in the combat, the morale of the Gallic forces broke. The army of Tetricus was soundly defeated, and Tetricus surrendered either directly after his defeat or later; the latest possible date for his surrender was March 274, when the Gallic mints switched from minting coins of Tetricus I and II to those of Aurelian. Some Roman sources including Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, the , and Orosius report that Tetricus had already made a deal with Aurelian, offering to surrender in exchange for an honourable defeat and no punishment, quoting the ghost of Palinurus from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; 6.365: (&#x27;pluck me out, O undefeated one, from these troubles&#x27;). However, this is believed by modern historians to be a product of Roman imperial propaganda; Aurelian, who was attempting to stabilise his fragile empire, benefited from the account that Tetricus had planned to betray his army, as his troops would then be less likely to rise up again.

Upon Tetricus&#x27;s surrender, the Gallic Empire rejoined the Roman Empire, once more restored to its former borders, and Aurelian held a triumph in Rome involving many chariots; twenty elephants; two hundred beasts, including tigers, giraffes, and elk; eight hundred gladiators; and prisoners from various barbarian peoples. The leaders of the two secessionist states, Tetricus of the Gallic Empire and Zenobia of the Palmyrene Empire, were paraded during this triumph, along with Tetricus II; Tetricus and his son were not placed in chains for their march, but instead were made to wear (Gallic trousers). Aurelian pardoned all three of them and made Tetricus a senator and (governor) of either , a region of southern Italy, or all of Italy. The states that he was made (governor of Lucania) in the biography of Tetricus, but states that he was made (governor of Italy) in the biography of Aurelian. Epigraphic evidence exists for who predate Tetricus, whereas the first epigraphic evidence for a of a smaller region comes from around 283, ten years after Aurelian appointed Tetricus as . Because of the contradictions within the , the opinion of modern scholars is divided. In 1921, David Magie, the editor of the Loeb edition of the , favored Tetricus&#x27;s having been made , while others, such as Alaric Watson in his 1999 &quot;Aurelian and the Third Century&quot;, support his having been made . Tetricus died of natural causes several years later in Italia.

==Numismatics==
The gold issued during the reign of Tetricus fall into several types. Seven surviving coins feature his image on the obverse, with the reverses showing him riding a horse, him holding an olive branch and a scepter, as well as various depictions of deities standing, including: Aequitas, Jupiter, Laetitia, Pax, and Spes. One features his face on the obverse and a standing Hilaritas on the reverse. Another displays his head on the obverse and a depiction of the Roman goddess Victoria walking to the right on the reverse. There are two types that depicted Tetricus I and Tetricus II together; both feature jugate (side-by-side) images of them on the obverse, with one having a standing Aeternitas on the reverse and the other having a standing Felicitas. A rare (a silver coin) issued during his reign has a three-quarter facing image of Tetricus on the obverse and Victoria standing with her foot on a globe on the reverse.

Most of the coins minted during Tetricus&#x27;s reign were of low quality; his antoninianus contained so little silver content that imitations were easy to make, leading to the market being flooded with fakes, called barbarous radiates.

The coinage of the Gallic Empire does not give any evidence of public games or festivals, as was common in the Roman Empire, although it is believed that similar games and festivals were held. There are a number of issues of coins in which the emperor&#x27;s head faces left, rather than the usual right, which historians Oliver Nicholson and P. J. Casey state may have been donatives granted to soldiers upon the emperor&#x27;s accession or consulship, in line with the expectations of the time.

<text>A rubber band (also known as an elastic, gum band or lacky band) is a loop of rubber, usually ring or oval shaped, and commonly used to hold multiple objects together. The rubber band was patented in England on March 17, 1845, by Stephen Perry. Most rubber bands are manufactured out of natural rubber as well as for latex free rubber bands or, especially at larger sizes, an elastomer, and are sold in a variety of sizes.

Notable developments in the evolution of rubber bands began in 1923 when William H. Spencer obtained a few Goodyear inner tubes and cut the bands by hand in his basement, where he founded Alliance Rubber Company. Spencer persuaded the &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; as well as the &quot;Tulsa World&quot; to try wrapping their newspapers with one of his rubber bands to prevent them from blowing across lawns. He went on to pioneer other new markets for rubber bands such as: agricultural and industrial applications and a myriad of other uses. Spencer obtained a patent on February 19, 1957, for a new &quot;Method for Making Elastic Bands&quot; which produced rubber bands in an Open Ring design.

==Manufacturing==
Most rubber, whether it is natural or synthetic, normally arrives at the manufacturing facility in large bales. Rubber bands are made by extruding the rubber into a long tube to provide its general shape. There are a number of different methods that can be applied at this point in the manufacturing process. Originally, and in some instances still today, the rubber tubes will then be placed on mandrels, curing the rubber with heat, and then slicing them across the width of the tube into little bands. This causes the tube to split into multiple sections, creating rubber bands. This is most commonly known as an &quot;off-line&quot; rubber extrusion process.

While other rubber products may use synthetic rubber, most rubber bands are primarily manufactured using natural rubber because of its superior elasticity.

Natural rubber originates from the latex of the rubber tree, which is acquired by tapping into the bark layers of the rubber tree. Rubber trees belong to the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae) and only survive in hot, humid tropical climates near the equator, so the majority of latex is produced in the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Once the latex has been tapped and is exposed to the air, it begins to harden and become elastic, or rubbery.

==Rubber band sizes==
===Measuring===

A rubber band is usually measured in three basic dimensions: the flat length, cut width, and wall thickness. The flat length is the total unstretched length. Perpendicular to the flat length is the cut width. Wall thickness is generally measured using tools such as calipers or pin gauges. The wall thickness determines the band&#x27;s strength and durability.

If one imagines a rubber band during manufacture, that is, a long tube of rubber on a mandrel, before it is sliced into rubber bands, the band&#x27;s width is decided by how far apart the slices are cut, and its length by the circumference of the tube.

===Size numbers===

A rubber band is assigned an industry-standard number based on its dimensions. The first use of rubber band size numbers can be traced back to the early 20th century. While it is difficult to pinpoint an exact date, the practice of categorizing rubber bands by size allowed to easily select the appropriate rubber band for their specific needs. Standards for the rubber band were established in the United States in 1925 by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Standards and is the first known publication to reference rubber band size. 

Generally, rubber bands are numbered from smallest to largest, width first.
Thus, rubber bands numbered 8–19 are all  inch wide, with lengths going from  inch to  inches.
Rubber band numbers 30–35 are for width of  inch, going again from shorter to longer.
For even longer bands, the numbering starts over for numbers above 100, again starting at width  inch.

==Thermodynamics==
Temperature affects the elasticity of a rubber band in an unusual way. Heating causes the rubber band to contract and cooling causes expansion.
Stretching a rubber band will cause it to release heat, while releasing it after it has been stretched will make it absorb heat, causing its surroundings to become a little cooler. This effect is due to the higher entropy of the unstressed state, which is more entangled and therefore has more states available. In other words, the ability to convert thermal energy into work while the rubber relaxes is allowed by the higher entropy of the relaxed state.

The result is that a rubber band behaves somewhat like an ideal monatomic gas inasmuch as (to good approximation) that elastic polymers do not store any potential energy in stretched chemical bonds. No elastic work is done to &quot;stretch&quot; molecules when work is done upon these bulk polymers. Instead, all work done to the rubber is &quot;released&quot; (not stored) and appears immediately in the polymer as thermal energy. Conversely, when the polymer does work on the surroundings (such as contracting to lift an object) it converts thermal energy to work in the process and cools in the same manner as an ideal gas, expanding while doing work.

==Red rubber bands==

In the UK during 2004, following complaints from the public about postal carriers creating litter by discarding the rubber bands which they used to keep their mail together, the Royal Mail introduced red bands for their workers to use: it was hoped that, as the bands were easier to spot than the traditional brown ones and since only the Royal Mail used them, employees would see (and feel compelled to pick up) any red bands which they had inadvertently dropped. As of 2006, some 342 million red bands were being used per year.
The Royal Mail no longer uses red rubber bands as of about 2010. The exact date of the expunging of these is uncertain, presumably as different areas used up old stock at varying rates.

==Rubber bands in orthodontics==

Special rubber bands of medical-grade latex can be used (worn) for orthodontic correction of teeth position together with metal braces or clear aligners to apply additional pressure on the teeth being straightened. These rubber bands are manufactured in different sizes for use in the varying steps of Orthodontic treatment. They are often termed orthodontic elastics.

==Ranger bands==
This type of rubber band was popularized by use in the military. Ranger bands are essentially sections of tire inner tubing cut into various sizes. They have the advantage of being versatile, durable, and resistant to weather and abrasion. They are commonly used for lashings, and can also be used for makeshift handle grips, providing a strong high-friction surface with excellent shock absorption.

Identical loops of inner tube are used by cavers and cave divers, and in that context are called snoopy loops by the British caving and cave diving community. When they get lost they are recognizable as a common form of litter.

Snoopy loops are easily cut from discarded car and motorcycle inner tubes using a pair of scissors. A knife cut may leave a notched edge which can lead to tearing. Varying sizes of inner tube are used for different tasks. Uses in caving include sealing cuffs of oversuits and collars of boots against the ingress of water, holding kneepads and elbow pads in place or securing dive lines to small rocks. and have been used for first aid for strapping injured joints tightly in place.

Technical divers use small snoopy loops made from bicycle inner tubes to prevent backup lights clipped to a dive harness from dangling, and larger loops cut from car tubes are used to stow hoses against sling or sidemount cylinders.

The exact origin is unknown and has been subject to much speculation. The practice of using snoopy Loops has been claimed to have originated in Greece and spotted by Cave Diving Group members in the late 1970s. The practice was then propagated in Yorkshire Dales. Another claim is that snoopy loops were named by Dave Morris, a Cave Diving Group caver who noticed how they &#x27;snooped&#x27; around boulders. It was considered a ridiculous name at the time. None of these claims are particularly plausible as the use is obvious and is likely to have originated independently in several places at earlier dates.

==Elastration==
In animal husbandry, rubber bands are used for docking and castration of livestock. The procedure involves banding the body part with a tight latex (rubber) band to restrict blood flow. As the blood flow diminishes, the cells within the gonads die and dehydrate. The part eventually drops off.

==Model use==
Rubber bands have long been one of the methods of powering small free-flight model aircraft, the rubber band being anchored at the rear of the fuselage and connected to the propeller at the front. To &#x27;wind up&#x27; the &#x27;engine&#x27;, the propeller is repeatedly turned, twisting the rubber band. When the propeller has had enough turns, the propeller is released and the model launched, the rubber band then turning the propeller rapidly until it has unwound.

One of the first to use this method was pioneer aerodynamicist George Cayley, who used rubber band-driven motors for powering his small experimental models. These &#x27;rubber motors&#x27; have also been used for powering small model boats.

==Balls==


A rubber band ball is a sphere of rubber bands made by using a knotted single band as a starting point and then wrapping rubber bands around the center until the desired size is achieved. The ball is usually made from 100% rubber bands, but some instructions call for using a marble, a crumpled piece of paper, or a ping-pong ball as a starting point.

===Notable rubber band balls===
The world&#x27;s largest rubber band ball as of November 19, 2008, was created by Joel Waul of Lauderhill, Florida. He is currently the World Record Holder according to the Guinness World Records. The ball, which previously sat under a tarp in Waul&#x27;s driveway, weighs 9,032 pounds (4,097 kg), is more than tall (which implies about a circumference), and consists of more than 700,000 rubber bands. It set the world record on November 13, 2008, in Lauderhill, Florida. The ball is now owned by Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!.

Steve Milton of Eugene, Oregon, previously held the record for the biggest rubber band ball beginning in 2006. During the construction of his rubber band ball, he was sponsored by OfficeMax, who sent him rubber bands to use for his ball. His ball was approximately 175,000 rubber bands, tall (circumference: ), and weighed . He began building the ball, with help from his family, in November, 2005 and would store the ball in their garage.

Before Steve Milton, the record was held by John Bain of Wilmington, Delaware, beginning in 1998. In 2003, his ball weighed around , consisting of over 850,000 rubber bands and is tall (circumference: ). He put the ball up for auction in 2005, but he and his ball participated in Guinness World Records Day 2006. The bands were donated by two companies: Alliance Rubber and Textrip Ltd./Stretchwell Inc.

The former world record was set in 1978.

<text>Aloysius Tyrone Foster (born January 18, 1943) is an American jazz drummer. Foster&#x27;s professional career began in the mid-1960s, when he played and recorded with hard bop and swing musicians including Blue Mitchell and Illinois Jacquet. Foster played jazz fusion with Miles Davis during the 70s and was one of the few people to have contact with Davis during his retirement from 1975 to 1980. During Davis&#x27;s retirement, Foster continued to play and record acoustic jazz with Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, McCoy Tyner, Horace Silver, and other band leaders. Foster played on Miles Davis&#x27;s 1981 comeback album &quot;The Man with the Horn&quot;, and was the only musician to play in Davis&#x27;s band both before, and after, his retirement. After leaving Davis&#x27;s band in the mid-1980s, Foster toured and recorded with Herbie Hancock, Sonny Rollins, Joe Henderson, and many other band leaders, primarily working in acoustic jazz settings. Foster has also released several solo albums under his own name, starting with &quot;Mixed Roots&quot; in 1978.

==Biography==
Foster was born in Richmond, Virginia, United States, and grew up in New York. He began playing drums at the age of 13 and made his recording debut on Blue Mitchell&#x27;s 1964 album, &quot;The Thing to Do&quot;, at the age of 20.

He joined Miles Davis&#x27;s group when Jack DeJohnette left in 1972, and played with Davis until 1985. In his 1989 autobiography, Davis described the first time he heard Foster play live in 1972 at the Cellar Club in Manhattan: &quot;He [Foster] knocked me out because he had such a groove and he would just lay it right in there. That was the kind of thing I was looking for. Al could set it up for everybody else to play off and just keep the groove going forever.&quot;

Foster began composing in the 1970s, and has toured with his own band, including musicians such as bassist Doug Weiss, saxophonist Dayna Stephens, and pianist Adam Birnbaum.

<doc id="512486" wikidata="Q5137024" url="?curid=512486" title="Clyde Stubblefield">
<text>Clyde Austin Stubblefield (April 18, 1943 – February 18, 2017) was an American drummer best known for his work with James Brown, with whom he recorded and toured for six years (1965-70). His syncopated drum patterns on Brown&#x27;s recordings are considered funk standards. Samples of his drum performances (particularly his break in the 1970 track &quot;Funky Drummer&quot;) were heavily used in hip hop music beginning in the 1980s, although Stubblefield frequently received no credit.

A self-taught musician, Stubblefield was influenced by the sound of industrial rhythms he heard in factories and trains. He began playing with local groups in his native Tennessee and later moved to Georgia, where he played with musicians such as Eddie Kirkland and Otis Redding in the early 1960s before joining Brown&#x27;s band. He later settled in Madison, Wisconsin, where he was a staple of the local music scene. He has been named among the great drummers of all time by various publications. In 2017, he accepted an honorary degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

==Early life==
Born to Frank D. and Vena Stubblefield on April 18, 1943, he grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was inspired to pursue drumming after seeing drummers for the first time in a parade. As a youngster his sense of rhythm was influenced by the industrial sounds of factories and trains around him. He practiced the rhythm patterns he heard, sometimes playing two patterns simultaneously. Years later he said if he could hum a drum pattern, he could play it. He played professionally as a teenager and performed in local bands such as Blue Shufflers, Inclines, and Cascades. In the early 1960s he moved to Macon, Georgia, and worked with guitarist Eddie Kirkland and toured with Otis Redding.

==Drummer for James Brown, 1965 to 1970==
In 1965, James Brown saw Stubblefield perform in Macon, Georgia, and asked him to audition. Soon after he joined Brown&#x27;s band. Over the next six years the band had two drummers, Stubblefield and John &quot;Jabo&quot; Starks who had joined the band two weeks earlier. Starks&#x27; style was influenced by the church music he grew up with in Mobile, Alabama. The two drummers had no formal training. According to Stubblefield, &quot;We just played what we wanted to play (...) We just put down what we think it should be.&quot; The two &quot;created the grooves on many of Brown&#x27;s biggest hits and laid the foundation for modern funk drumming in the process.&quot;

Stubblefield&#x27;s recordings with James Brown are considered to be some of the standard-bearers for funk drumming, including the singles &quot;Cold Sweat&quot;, &quot;I Got the Feelin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Give It Up or Turnit a Loose&quot;, &quot;Say It Loud – I&#x27;m Black and I&#x27;m Proud&quot;, &quot;Mother Popcorn&quot;, &quot;Get Up, Get into It, Get Involved&quot;, &quot;There Was a Time&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Funky Now&quot;, and the album &quot;Sex Machine&quot;.

His rhythm pattern on James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; is among the world&#x27;s most sampled musical segments. It has been used for decades by hip-hop groups and rappers such as Public Enemy, Run-DMC, N.W.A, Raekwon, LL Cool J, Beastie Boys and Prince, and has also been used in other genres. Though the sole creator of his patterns, Stubblefield was not credited for the use of the samples. He was featured in the 2009 PBS documentary, &quot;Copyright Criminals&quot;, which addressed the creative and legal aspects of sampling in the music industry.

==Career, 1971 to 2017==
Stubblefield lived in Madison, Wisconsin, from 1971 onward. For over twenty years he played Monday nights with his band, The Clyde Stubblefield Band, in downtown Madison. The band featured his longtime friend and keyboard-organ player Steve &quot;Doc&quot; Skaggs, along with soul vocalists Charlie Brooks and Karri Daley, as well as a horn section and supporting band. Stubblefield retired from the Monday shows in 2011 due to health issues, leaving the band in the hands of his nephew Bret Stubblefield.

Stubblefield worked with a variety of musicians in the Madison area such as keyboardist Steve Skaggs, guitarists Luther Allison and Cris Plata, jazz violinist Randy Sabien, rock band Garbage, country trio Common Faces and jazz group NEO. He performed and recorded with members of The J.B.&#x27;s including Bootsy Collins, Maceo Parker and &quot;Jabo&quot; Starks. The group released the album &quot;Bring the Funk on Down&quot; in 1999. From the early 1990s to 2015, he performed on the nationally syndicated public radio show &quot;Whad&#x27;Ya Know?&quot;

Stubblefield&#x27;s first solo album &quot;The Revenge of the Funky Drummer&quot; was released in 1997. The album was produced by producer-songwriter Richard Mazda. In 1998, he released a 26 track break-beat album titled &quot;The Original Funky Drummer Breakbeat Album&quot;. Stubblefield&#x27;s third solo album &quot;The Original&quot; was released in 2003. All compositions were based on Stubblefield&#x27;s drum grooves and the album was produced by Leo Sidran.

Stubblefield collaborated frequently with &quot;Jabo&quot; Starks. As the Funkmasters, the duo released an album in 2001 called &quot;Find the Groove&quot; and an album in 2006 called &quot;Come Get Summa This&quot;. The duo also released a drumming instruction video in 1999 titled &quot;Soul of the Funky Drummers&quot;. In December 2007, the duo joined Bootsy Collins in Covington, Kentucky, for the first tribute concert in memory of James Brown. Stubblefield and Starks played on &quot;Funk for Your Ass&quot;, a tribute album by fellow James Brown orchestra alum Fred Wesley. The album was released in 2008. Later that year an expansion to the EZdrummer software was released with samples recorded by Stubblefield and Starks.

In 2009, Stubblefield was in need of a kidney transplant and underwent dialysis treatments. Musicians in the Madison area organized fundraiser events, donating the proceeds to supplement his dialysis treatment and subsequent medical bills. Stubblefield coped with health issues from the early 2000s onward including cancer. His wife Jody Hannon was a source of support in managing his health.

In 2011, Stubblefield performed &quot;Fight the Power&quot; on the &quot;Jimmy Fallon show&quot; along with Chuck D and members of The Roots and Eclectic Method. In 2012, he gave an autobiographical talk and performed his favorite beats at the Madison Ruby conference in Madison, Wisconsin. In 2015, a scholarship fund for music education was started and named after Stubblefield.

== Recognition ==

In 2014, Stubblefield was named the second best drummer of all time by &quot;LA Weekly&quot;. According to the &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, &quot;Stubblefield is one of the most sampled drummers in history, the man whose uncanny ability to deconstruct pop music&#x27;s simple 4/4 rhythms into a thousand different sly syncopations laid the foundation not only for funk, but for most of hip-hop, as well.&quot; In 2013, Stubblefield and Starks received the Yamaha Legacy Award. In 2004, he received the lifetime achievement award at the Madison Area Music Awards. In 2000, he was inducted into the Wisconsin Area Music Industry hall of fame. In 1990 he was named drummer of the year by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, and in 2016 the magazine named Stubblefield and Starks the sixth best drummer of all time. A set of Stubblefield&#x27;s autographed drum-sticks are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Drummer David Garibaldi credits Stubblefield for inventing the vocabulary of funk drumming. Garibaldi singles out the drumming on &quot;I Got the Feelin&#x27;&quot; as the &quot;sign of a genius&quot;. According to Questlove, drummer of The Roots, Stubblefield is the one &quot;who defined funk music.&quot; Chuck D said of Stubblefield&#x27;s impact on hip-hop, &quot;It was a style of repetition that was emulated as opposed to just the actual sound. You know, holding it there, and keeping steady with the vamp.&quot; Nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot paid tribute to Stubblefield in his song &quot;Good Old Clyde&quot;. Hip hop artist Black Thought of The Roots rhymes &quot;I&#x27;m cooler than Clyde Stubblefield, drummer for James&quot; in the song &quot;Stay Cool&quot;.

Ben Sisario of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes: &quot;On songs like &#x27;Cold Sweat&#x27; and &#x27;Mother Popcorn&#x27; [Stubblefield] perfected a light-touch style filled with the off-kilter syncopations sometimes called ghost notes.&quot; According to National Public Radio, &quot;the grooves [Stubblefield and Starks] created have inspired generations of artists — not just in funk, but in hip-hop, where their steady but intricate patterns make natural material for sampling.&quot; In 2017, Stubblefield accepted an honorary doctorate of fine arts from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, which was conferred posthumously.

==Death==
Stubblefield died on February 18, 2017, from kidney failure. He survived cancer in 2000 and coped with kidney disease since 2002. In 2016, it was reported pop icon Prince, who deeply admired Stubblefield, paid about $80,000 of the drummer&#x27;s medical costs. Stubblefield was survived by his wife Jody Hannon.

==Quotations==
In a 1991 interview with &quot;Isthmus&quot;, Stubblefield said: &quot;What influenced me mainly was sounds. Train tracks. Washing machines. I just put patterns against natural sounds, and that&#x27;s what I do today. I could be walking down the street in time and put a drum pattern against it while I&#x27;m walking (...) That&#x27;s the same thing I&#x27;m doing now when I sit down behind the drums. I put a pattern behind what everyone else is doing.&quot;

<doc id="512487" wikidata="Q846561" url="?curid=512487" title="Monochrome painting">
<text>Monochromatic painting has played a significant role in modern and contemporary Western visual art, originating with the early 20th-century European avant-gardes. Artists have explored the non-representational potential of a single color, investigating shifts in value, diversity of texture, and formal nuances as a means of emotional expression, visual investigation into the inherent properties of painting, as well as a starting point for conceptual works. Ranging from geometric abstraction in a variety of mediums to non-representational gestural painting, monochromatic works continue to be an important influence in contemporary art.

==Origins==

Monochrome painting was initiated at the first Incoherents exhibition in Paris in 1882, with a black painting by the poet Paul Bilhaud entitled &quot;Combat de Nègres pendant la nuit&quot; (&quot;Battle of negroes during the night&quot;), which had been missing since 1882 when it was rediscovered in a private collection in 2017–2018. It has been classified as a National Treasure by the French state. Although Bilhaud was not the first to create an all-black artwork: for example, Robert Fludd published an image of &quot;Darkness&quot; in his 1617 book on the origin and structure of the cosmos; and Bertall published his black &quot;Vue de La Hogue (effet de nuit)&quot; in 1843. In the subsequent exhibitions of the Incoherent arts (also in the 1880s) the writer Alphonse Allais proposed other monochrome paintings, such as &quot;Première communion de jeunes filles chlorotiques par un temps de neige&quot; (&quot;First communion of anaemic young girls in the snow&quot;, white), or &quot;Récolte de la tomate par des cardinaux apoplectiques au bord de la Mer Rouge&quot; (&quot;Tomato harvesting by apoplectic cardinals on the shore of the Red Sea&quot;, red). Allais published his &quot;Album primo-avrilesque&quot; in 1897, a monograph with seven monochrome artworks. However, this kind of activity bears more similarity to 20th century Dada, or Neo-Dada, and particularly the works of the Fluxus group of the 1960s, than to 20th century monochrome painting since Malevich.

Jean Metzinger, following the &quot;Succès de scandale&quot; created from the Cubist showing at the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, in an interview with Cyril Berger published in &quot;Paris-Journal&quot; 29 May 1911, stated:

We cubists have only done our duty by creating a new rhythm for the benefit of humanity. Others will come after us who will do the same. What will they find? That is the tremendous secret of the future. Who knows if someday, a great painter, looking with scorn on the often brutal game of supposed colorists and taking the seven colors back to the primordial white unity that encompasses them all, will not exhibit completely white canvases, with nothing, absolutely nothing on them. (Jean Metzinger, 29 May 1911)

Metzinger&#x27;s (then) audacious prediction that artists would take abstraction to its logical conclusion by vacating representational subject matter entirely and returning to what Metzinger calls the &quot;primordial white unity&quot;, a &quot;completely white canvas&quot; would be realized two years later. The writer of a satirical manifesto entitled &quot;Manifeste de l&#x27;école amorphiste&quot;, published in &quot;Les Hommes du Jour&quot; (3 May 1913), may have had Metzinger&#x27;s vision in mind when the author justified amorphism&#x27;s blank canvases by claiming &#x27;light is enough for us&#x27;. With perspective, writes art historian Jeffery S. Weiss, &quot;&quot;Vers Amorphisme&quot; may be gibberish, but it was also enough of a foundational language to anticipate the extreme reductivist implications of non-objectivity&quot;.

In a broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the geometric abstractions of painters associated with the Bauhaus, in the works of Kazimir Malevich, Piet Mondrian and other artists associated with the De Stijl movement, and the Russian Constructivist movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor Constantin Brâncuși. Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Josef Albers, and the works of artists as diverse as Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, Giorgio Morandi, and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of Abstract Expressionism that had been dominant in the New York School during the 1940s and 1950s.

The wide range of possibilities (including impossibility) of interpretation of monochrome paintings is arguably why the monochrome is so engaging to so many artists, critics, and writers. Although the monochrome has never become dominant and few artists have committed themselves exclusively to it, it has never gone away. It reappears as though a spectre haunting high modernism, or as a symbol of it, appearing during times of aesthetic and sociopolitical upheavals.

===Suprematism and Constructivism===
Monochrome painting as it is usually understood today began in Moscow, with &quot;Suprematist Composition: White on White&quot; of 1918 by Suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich. This was a variation on or sequel to his 1915 work &quot;Black Square on a White Field&quot;, a very important work in its own right to 20th century geometric abstraction.

In 1921, Constructivist artist Alexander Rodchenko exhibited &quot;Pure Red Color, Pure Blue Color,&quot; and &quot;Pure Yellow Color&quot;: three paintings together, each a monochrome of one of the three primary colors. He intended this work to represent the &quot;death of painting.&quot; While Rodchenko intended his monochrome to be a dismantling of the typical assumptions of painting, Malevich saw his work as a concentration on them, a kind of meditation on art&#x27;s essence (“pure feeling”).

These two approaches articulated very early on in its history this kind of work&#x27;s almost paradoxical dynamic: that one can read a monochrome either as a flat surface (material entity or “painting as object”) which represents nothing but itself, and therefore representing an ending in the evolution of illusionism in painting (i.e. Rodchenko); or as a depiction of multidimensional (infinite) space, a fulfillment of illusionistic painting, representing a new evolution—a new beginning—in Western painting&#x27;s history (Malevich). Additionally, many have pointed out that it may be difficult to deduce the artist&#x27;s intentions from the painting itself, without referring to the artist&#x27;s comment.

==Artists==
===New York===
===Abstract Expressionists===

* Milton Resnick had a long career as an abstract expressionist painter. Initially, during the 1940s, he explored the then-current style of action painting. His later work, from the 1950s through the 1970s is often characterized as abstract impressionist —largely because he constructed his allover compositions with multiple, repetitive, and close-valued brushstrokes, in the manner of Claude Monet in the famous &quot;Waterlilies&quot; series. During the final two and a half decades of his painting career Resnick&#x27;s paintings became monochromatic, albeit with thickly brushed and layered surfaces.
* Ad Reinhardt was an abstract expressionist artist notable for painting nearly &quot;pure&quot; monochromes over a considerable span of time (roughly from 1952 to his death in 1967), in red or blue, and lastly and most (in)famously, in black. Like the Johns works mentioned below, Reinhardt&#x27;s black paintings contained faint indications of geometrical shape, but the actual delineations are not readily visible until the viewer spends time with the work. This tends to encourage a state of contemplative meditation in the viewer, and to create uncertainty about perception; in terms of Frank Stella&#x27;s famous quote, you may question whether &quot;what you see&quot; is actually what you are seeing.
* Richard Pousette-Dart created several distinct series of paintings during his long career as an abstract expressionist painter, his monochromatic series called &quot;Presences&quot; spanning the late 1950s through the early 1990s, was among his most powerful.

===Color field===
Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, several abstract expressionist/color field artists (notably: Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Adolph Gottlieb, Theodoros Stamos, Sam Francis, Ludwig Sander, Clyfford Still, Jules Olitski, and others) explored motifs that seemed to imply monochrome, employing broad, flat fields of colour in large scale pictures which proved highly influential to newer styles, such as post-painterly abstraction, lyrical abstraction, and minimalism.

One of Barnett Newman&#x27;s near monochrome paintings generated outrage and widespread ridicule (and discussion) in Canada when the National Gallery purchased his 1967 painting &quot;Voice of Fire&quot; for $1.8 million in the 1980s. Another of Barnett Newman’s very sparse (though technically not monochrome) geometric abstractions was slashed with a knife by an enraged viewer in the 1980s at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.

===Lyrical Abstraction===
Lyrical abstractionist painters such as Ronald Davis, Larry Poons, Walter Darby Bannard, Dan Christensen, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Ralph Humphrey, David Budd, David R. Prentice, Brice Marden, David Diao, David Novros, Jake Berthot, and others also explored and worked on series of shaped and rectangular canvases that approached the monochrome—with variations especially during the 1960s and 1970s.

====Shaped canvas====

Since the 1960s artists as diverse as Frank Stella, Ellsworth Kelly, Ronald Davis, David Novros, Paul Mogensen, Patricia Johanson and others made monochrome paintings on various shaped canvases. While some of their monochromatic works related to minimalism none of the above were minimalists.

===Neo-Dada===

* Robert Rauschenberg: &quot;A canvas is never empty&quot;. In the early 1950s, became known for white, then black, and eventually red monochrome canvases. In the &quot;White Paintings&quot; (1951) series, Rauschenberg applied everyday house paint with paint rollers to achieve smooth &quot;blank&quot; surfaces. White panels were exhibited alone or in modular groupings. The &quot;Black Paintings&quot; (1951–1953) incorporated texture under the painted surface by way of collaged newspaper that sometimes indicates a grid-like structure. The &quot;Red Paintings&quot; (1953–54) incorporate still more materials such as wood and fabric under the heavily worked painted surface, and seem to foreshadow Rauschenberg&#x27;s development of assemblage in his &quot;Combine Paintings&quot; as well as his stated intention to act in &quot;the gap&quot; between &quot;Art&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;.
:The white canvases became associated with the work 4&#x27;33&quot; by the composer John Cage, which consisted of three movements of silence, and was inspired at least in part by Cage&#x27;s study of Zen Buddhism. In both works attention is drawn to elements of listening / viewing which lie outside the artist&#x27;s control: e.g. the sounds of the concert environment, or the play of shadows and dust particles accumulating on the &#x27;blank&#x27; canvas surfaces (&quot;landing strips&quot; – Cage).
:In a related work, his &quot;Erased de Kooning Drawing&quot; of 1953, Rauschenberg erased a drawing by abstract expressionist artist Willem de Kooning. Perhaps surprisingly, De Kooning was sympathetic to Rauschenberg&#x27;s aims and implicitly endorsed this experiment by providing the younger artist with one of his own drawings which was very densely worked, taking 2 months and many erasers for Rauschenberg to (incompletely) erase.
* Jasper Johns was a friend of Rauschenberg, and both were often categorized as Neo-Dadaist, pointing to their rejection of the Abstract Expressionist aesthetic which was dominant in the 1950s. Johns painted a number of works such as &quot;White Flag&quot;, &quot;Green Target&quot;, and &quot;Tango,&quot; in which there is only a slight indication of an image, resembling the &quot;White Square on a White Field&quot; of Malevich in technique.
:These works often show more evidence of brushwork than is typically associated with monochrome painting. Many other works also approach monochrome, like the melancholic &quot;grey&quot; works of the early 1960s, but with real objects (&quot;assemblage&quot;) or text added.

===Minimalists===
* Ellsworth Kelly spent a lot of time in both Paris and New York. Not strictly a minimalist, he has made a number of monochrome paintings on shaped canvases and single color rectangular panels. His abstractions were &quot;abstracted&quot; from nature. His interest in nature extends so far that he has made a series of plant lithographs in an impressive and sincerely realistic style.
* Mino Argento monotones, white on white paintings were variations on the gridded, rectangle on rectangle themes, but were enlivened with differences in rhythm and conception. One composition included grayed grids and vertical rectangles in several, more opaque whites, clustered centrally.
* Agnes Martin whose works of the 1950s and 1960s are serene meditations on &quot;perfection&quot;, and hence &quot;beauty&quot;, are typically white, off-white or pale grey canvases with faint evidence of pencil dragged in lines or grids across the painted surface.
* Robert Ryman in works such as &quot;Ledger&quot; (1982) purposely draws attention to supports, framing, and the artist&#x27;s signature as important elements of works which are usually white, or off-white, and in square format. Abstract Expressionist brushwork is used as formal material in these minimalist constructions. Ryman exhibits a tour de force of variation on a deliberately limited theme.
* Brice Marden in his earliest mature works explored a reductive strategy which seemed similar to that of Jasper Johns&#x27;s and Ellsworth Kelly&#x27;s contemporaneous works, yet more formalist: paintings such as &quot;Return 1&quot; consist of subtly grey fields painted in encaustic (wax-medium) with a narrow strip along the bottom of the canvas where Marden left bare evidence of process (i.e., drips and spatters of paint). During the late 1980s Brice Marden, who held a spiritual/emotional view of abstraction, began a more multi-colored and calligraphic form of abstract painting.
* Frank Stella echoed composer Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s famous assertion that &quot;music is powerless to express anything but itself&quot; when he said &quot;What you see is what you see&quot;, a remark he later qualified by saying his early paintings were influenced to a degree by the writing of Samuel Beckett (see above). In his work he was attempting to minimize any inference of &quot;spiritual&quot; or even &quot;emotional&quot; response on the part of the viewer, and this is perhaps most striking in his pinstripe beginning in the late 1950s, where the pinstripes are articulated by unpainted canvas. Later, Stella abandoned not only monochrome, but also eventually geometric painting.
* John McCracken is characteristically Minimalist in that his &quot;objects&quot; aren&#x27;t adequately categorized as &quot;painting&quot; or &quot;sculpture&quot;. Famous since 1965 for &quot;slabs, columns, planks ... Neutral forms&quot;, his meticulously finished, polished monochrome objects are often simply leaned up against gallery walls, in what some critics describe as a casual &quot;West Coast-lean&quot;. Although he draws from techniques characteristic of surfboard manufacture, his works are personally and meticulously handcrafted, unlike those of John M. Miller and other more recent artists, which are typically factory-made according to the artist&#x27;s specifications.

* Allan McCollum determined in the mid-1970s that the social forces that give paintings meaning may be better understood if the &quot;painting&quot; itself could be reduced to a generic form—a painting that could read as a &quot;sign&quot; for a painting&quot;, which could function of a &quot;&quot;, or a kind of &quot;prop&quot;. In the 1970s and early 80s he painted what he called &quot;Surrogate Paintings,&quot; and ultimately began casting them in plaster, frame and all. These hundreds of objects that looked like framed, matted, fields of painted blackness, worked as neutral, &quot;generic signs&quot; that might inspire the viewer to think about the social expectations that constructed the &quot;idea&quot; of a painting, more than the actual painting itself. By reducing paintings to mere signs of themselves, McCollum turned the gallery and the museum setting into a kind of theater, highlighting the drama of presenting, displaying, buying and selling, exchanging, photographing, assessing, criticizing, choosing, and writing about the works; the object-paintings at the center of the action were purposely rendered moot, in order to turn one&#x27;s attention to the supplementary devices and social practices that, in the end, bestow the value on the work. Paradoxically, as time went by, these neutral objects became valuable in themselves, as symbols of an anthropological way of looking at art.
* Anne Truitt was an American artist of the mid-20th century; she is associated with both minimalism and Color Field artists like Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland. Primarily thought of as a minimalist sculptor, and as a colorist who painted her sculpture, throughout her career Truitt produced several series of Monochromatic paintings.
:She made what is considered her most important work in the early 1960s anticipating in many respects the work of minimalists like Donald Judd and Ellsworth Kelly. She was unlike the minimalists is some significant ways. She named, for instance, many of her works after places and events that were important to her—a practice suggesting a narrative beyond and yet somehow contained by the sculpture.
:The sculpture that made her significant to the development of Minimalism were aggressively plain and painted structures, often large. The recessional platform under her sculpture raised them just enough off the ground that they appeared to float on a thin line of shadow. The boundary between sculpture and ground, between gravity and verticality, was made illusory. This formal ambivalence is mirrored by her insistence that color itself, contained a psychological vibration which when purified, as it is on a work of art, isolates the event it refers to as a thing rather than a feeling. The event becomes a work of art, a visual sensation delivered by color.

===Europe===
* Lucio Fontana started from 1949 the so-called Spatial Concept or slash series, consisting in holes or slashes on the surface of monochrome paintings, drawing a sign of what he named &quot;an art for the Space Age&quot; (Concetto spaziale (50-B.1), 1950, MNAM, Paris).

=== Monochrome works: The Blue Epoch ===
* Yves Klein: although Klein had painted monochromes as early as 1949, and held the first private exhibition of this work in 1950, his first public showing was the publication of the artist&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; in November 1954. Parodying a traditional catalogue, the book featured a series of intense monochromes linked to various cities he had lived in during the previous years. &quot;Yves: Peintures&quot; anticipated his first two shows of oil paintings, at the Club des Solitaires, Paris, October 1955 and &quot;Yves: Proposition monochromes&quot; at Gallery Colette Allendy, February 1956. These shows, displaying orange, yellow, red, pink and blue monochromes, deeply disappointed Klein, as people went from painting to painting, linking them together as a sort of mosaic.

The next exhibition, &quot;Proposte Monochrome, Epoca Blu&quot; (Proposition Monochrome; Blue Epoch) at the Gallery Apollinaire, Milan, (January 1957), featured 11 identical blue canvases, using ultramarine pigment suspended in a synthetic resin &quot;Rhodopas&quot;. Discovered with the help of Edouard Adam, a Parisian paint dealer, the effect was to retain the brilliance of the pigment which tended to become dull when suspended in linseed oil. Klein later patented this recipe to maintain the &quot;authenticity of the pure idea&quot;. This colour, reminiscent of the lapis lazuli used to paint the Madonna&#x27;s robes in medieval paintings, was to become famous as &quot;International Klein Blue&quot; (IKB). The paintings were attached to poles placed 20 cm away from the walls to increase their spatial ambiguities.

The show was a critical and commercial success, traveling to Paris, Düsseldorf and London. The Parisian exhibition, at the Iris Clert Gallery, May 1957, became a seminal happening; As well as 1001 blue balloons being released to mark the opening, blue postcards were sent out using IKB stamps that Klein had bribed the postal service to accept as legitimate. An exhibition of tubs of blue pigment and fire paintings was held concurrently at Gallery Collette Allendy.
* Gerhard Richter is an artist who is probably best known for his technically stunning photo-realist paintings, which overshadow his abstract and monochrome works. Both his abstract and representational works seem to cover similar emotional terrain, a kind of ironic pessimism which made his work very fashionable in the late 1980s. His grey paintings, are made by drawing &quot;expressive&quot; gestures in wet paint.
* Olivier Mosset also has spent considerable time in New York and Paris. In Paris in the 1960s he was a member of the BMPT group, along with Daniel Buren, Michel Parmentier, and Niele Toroni. The group brought forth questions about the notions of authorship and originality, implying that they often did each other&#x27;s works, and that the art object was more important than its authorship. Later, in New York in the late 1970s, Mosset undertook a long series of monochrome paintings, during the heyday of Neo-expressionism. He became a founding member of the New York Radical Painting group, radical referring both to an implied radical social stance, as well as a returning to the radical &quot;root&quot; of painting. This re-assertion of social relevance for abstraction, and even the monochrome, hadn&#x27;t been emphasized to such a degree since Malevich and Rodchenko. 1980s neo-geo artists such as Peter Halley who assert a socially relevant, critical role for geometric abstraction, cite Mosset as an influence.

===Asia===
Dansaekhwa (Korean: 단색화), is a style of South Korean &quot;monochrome painting&quot; beginning in the mid 1970s.

<text>North Karelia (or &quot;Northern Karelia&quot;, ; ) is a region in eastern Finland. It borders the regions of Kainuu, North Savo, South Savo and South Karelia, as well as Russia&#x27;s Republic of Karelia. It is the easternmost region of Finland and shares a border with Russia. The city of Joensuu is the capital and the largest settlement of the region.

North Karelia has successfully reduced chronic diseases through public health measures. In the 1960s Finland led industrialized nations in heart disease mortality rates; North Karelia had Finland&#x27;s highest incidence. In 1972 a long-term project was undertaken which targeted this risk in North Karelia. The resulting improvement in public health is still considered remarkable, a model for the rest of the nation. North Karelia is also known as the most sociable region in Finland.
== History ==

The borders of remote North Karelia were formed gradually. Important border foundations were the Treaty of Stolbovo (1617) for the eastern border and the Treaty of Teusina (1595) for the western border. The border was finally established in the Treaty of Nystad (1721), where North Karelia was separated from the &quot;other Karelias&quot; that remained on Russia&#x27;s side.

Regional identity began to form gradually in the 18th century. In 1767, the häradshövding (judge) used the name &quot;Pohjois-Karjala&quot; (North Karelia). The residents also called themselves &quot;the men of the province&quot; and drew up their own regulations in Finnish for the border guard, showing their separateness. Administratively, North Karelia belonged to different counties in the 18th century, but it had its own &quot;North Karelia county&quot;. This self-administration set it apart from other regions. The separation was further strengthened when North Karelia was formed into its own province in 1960. North Karelia became its own region in 1994. Instead, North Karelia province was abolished in 1997 and its functions were transferred to the Eastern Finland province.

== Historical province ==
== Heraldry ==

The coat of arms of North Karelia is composed of the arms of Karelia.

<doc id="512497" wikidata="Q737903" url="?curid=512497" title="Stelios Kazantzidis">
<text>Stelios Kazantzidis (Greek: Στέλιος Καζαντζίδης; 29 August 1931 – 14 September 2001) was one of the most prominent Greek singers. He was of Pontian and Asia Minor roots. A top artist of Greek music, or Laïkó, he collaborated with many of Greece&#x27;s foremost composers.

== Biography ==
Kazantzidis was born in Nea Ionia, in Athens, Greece. He was the first of two brothers born to Haralambos Kazantzidis (of Pontian roots from Ordu) (Greek Κοτύωρα Kotyora) and Gesthimani Kazantzidi, who was a Greek who came from the town of Alanya (known as Alaiya) (Greek Κορακήσιον Korakesion) in what is now southern Turkey and migrated to Greece as a result of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). He was orphaned at the age of 16 when his father, a member of the Greek Resistance, was beaten to death by right-wing guerillas in 1947, during the Greek Civil War. This forced Kazantzidis into employment, working as a baggage-carrier at Omonia Square and then for an interstate bus company, as a seller of roasted chestnuts at open markets, and as a labourer at the Nea Ionia textile mills.

His life changed when the owner of a factory, which was located in the Perissos working district, gave him a guitar. He spent long hours playing music. He made his first public appearance at a Kifissia night club in the early 1950s and soon after, in July 1952, made his first studio recording at Columbia studios with a song entitled &quot;I&#x27;m going for a swim&quot; (Για μπάνιο πάω), written by Apostolos Kaldaras. It did not do well but he tried again, recording Giannis Papaioannou&#x27;s &quot;The suitcases&quot; (Οι βαλίτσες) soon after. The song became the first of many hits and with his newfound popularity he began to make appearances in some of the biggest clubs of the time, like &quot;Theios&quot;, &quot;Mpertzeletos&quot; and &quot;Rosignol&quot;. With his career in full swing, Kazantzidis began to collaborate with some of the biggest names in Greek music, among them Manolis Chiotis, Manos Hadjidakis, Mikis Theodorakis, and Stavros Xarhakos.

A hallmark in his career – and an event of great importance for the musical scene of post-war Greece – was his cooperation with composer Vassilis Tsitsanis. Starting in 1956 it resulted in several new songs as well as reinterpretions of Tsitsanis older songs. Kazantzidis, thus, sung and popularized such rebetiko classics as &quot;Synnefiasmeni Kyriaki&quot;, &quot;Bakse tsifliki&quot; and &quot;Ta Kavourakia&quot;. These songs, and many others, previously unknown to the wide public suddenly became cherished and sought-after.

A few years later Kazantzidis started to develop his own musical style, a style with influences ranging from rebetika to Indian music. This new turn met with considerable success and became a template for later developments in Greek popular music. &quot;Mantoubala&quot; for example, a Kazantzidis original, was inspired by Madhubala, an Indian actress he saw. This was the first record in Greece to sell over 100,000 copies, an amazing fact since the total population of the country (at the time) was about 7.5 million.

Stelios Kazantzidis married Marinella on 7 May 1964 and they toured together in Germany and the United States. The two of them became a legendary duo. In 1965, Kazantzidis, whilst at the peak of his career, decided to stop appearing in nightclubs. For the next ten years, he only released studio albums. In September 1966 he divorced Marinella, and they recorded their last duets (&quot;Mi Mou Lete Gia Aftin&quot;, &quot;Apopse Se Eho Stin Agalia Mou&quot; and &quot;I Kardia Tis Manas&quot;) for Philips the following year.

Following Marinella&#x27;s departure Litsa Diamandi became his primary female harmony vocalist in 1968. The album simply titled &quot;Stelios Kazantzidis&quot; (often referred to as the &quot;balloon album&quot;, due to its cover artwork), was a transitional album. Marinella sang on some songs (including &quot;Pame Tsarka&quot;-an updated version of Tsitsanis&#x27; &quot;Bakse Tsifliki&quot;) and Diamandi on others (e.g. the big hit &quot;Efiye Efiye&quot;).

In 1968, Kazantzidis recorded &quot;Nyhterides Ki Arahnes&quot;, written by newcomer Christos Nikolopoulos; the song became an immediate success. The follow-up to this album, &quot;Ena Gramma&quot; had a number of hits, which included &quot;Sto Trapezi Pou Tha Pino&quot;, &quot;Pare T&#x27; Ahnaria&quot;, &quot;Tha Kopso to Telefono&quot; and &quot;Kai Oi Andres Klene&quot;. Marinella had an &quot;answer back&quot; to that latter song, by releasing &quot;Oi Andres Den Klene&quot; (men don&#x27;t cry).

In 1973 he collaborated with songwriter Akis Panou and released an album with six songs, including one of his biggest hits, &quot;I zoi mou oli&quot;, and in 1974 he recorded &quot;Stin Anatoli&quot;, composed by Mikis Theodorakis. The next year he recorded another one of his biggest hits, &quot;Iparho&quot;, penned by Pythagoras. Suddenly Kazantzidis rocked the Greek music industry again, when he announced his decision to stop recording. He accused his label of &quot;colonial-like&quot; contracts and took a leave from recording. In 1987 he recorded again for the first time after 12 years. &quot;Ο Dromos Tis Epistrofis&quot; (Ο Δρόμος της Επιστροφής) sold 200,000 copies in a fiew hours and became a commercial success. He continued to release special records occasionally for the rest of his life (Eleftheros, Vradiazei, Tragoudo etc). Kazantidis, besides his work on folk music, also recorded four records with Pontic music alongside Chrysanthos Theodoridis, the greatest Pontic singer, songwriter, and lyricist. On December 19, 2024, his life was brought to the big screen in the movie I Exist, starring Christos Mastoras. In just the first four days of its release, the film sold 118,000 tickets.

==Foreign audiences==
In Israel, he was a musical icon. Many of his songs were translated into Hebrew and performed by the country&#x27;s leading singers. Yaron Enosh, an Israel Radio broadcaster who often plays Greek music on his programs, described the singer&#x27;s ability to combine joy with sorrow: &quot;This is the task of music: to touch the entire range of feelings...Kazantzidis could do this; he played on all the strings.&quot; To the Greek Jews who immigrated to Israel, Kazantzidis was &quot;the voice of the world they left behind, for good or for bad.&quot; According to the operator of Radio Agapi, a station that plays Greek music 24 hours a day, &quot;Kazantzidis was the voice of the people, of the weary, the exploited, the betrayed. And the voice of the refugee and the emigre, too.&quot;

In the 1970s/80s, many Greek recording artists, including Kazantzidis, had recordings issued by the New York-based P.I. (Peters International) label, for the Greek diaspora in the USA.

Minos also had Kazantzidis recordings issued in Israel, for the local market there.

==Death==
Kazantzidis died of a brain tumor on 14 September 2001. His death was an emotional event for Greece, as attested to by the many obituaries in appreciation of his life and work. His funeral through the streets of Elefsina (26 km from Athens) was broadcast live on Greek television. His music was also beloved by the Greek diaspora all over the world, capturing their feelings in the difficult post-war period.

He was commemorated on a Greek postage stamp in 2010.

==Film==
Greek popular music had long been intertwined with Greek post-war cinema. In the 50s and 60s, almost every film contained portions of music performed on screen, often by Kazantzidis.

The first is heard in the background of a restaurant while the second is heard in multiple of the final scenes of the episode; the music was not sourced anywhere on set, a technique rarely used by the show&#x27;s producers.

&quot;Epsahna Adika Na Vro&quot; is audible in the Movie &quot;Summer Lovers&quot;. However, it does not appear on the soundtrack album, nor is it in the film credits.

<text>Gaius Pius Esuvius Tetricus, better known as Tetricus II, was the son and heir of Tetricus I, emperor of the Gallic Empire from 271 to 274 AD. 

In 273, he was given the title of &quot;Caesar&quot; alongside that of &quot;princeps iuventutis&quot;, and in January 274 he started his first consulship, together with his father. 

After the defeat and deposition of his father in the autumn of 274 by the Emperor Aurelian, he and his father appeared as prisoners in Aurelian&#x27;s triumph, but the emperor spared their lives. According to some sources, Tetricus II also kept his senatorial rank.

<text>The German camps in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|occupied Poland]] during World War II were built by the Nazis between 1939 and 1945 throughout the territory of the Polish Republic, both in the areas annexed in 1939, and in the General Government formed by Nazi Germany in the central part of the country &quot;(see map)&quot;. After the 1941 German attack on the Soviet Union, a much greater system of camps was established, including the world&#x27;s only industrial extermination camps constructed specifically to carry out the &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot;.

German-occupied Poland contained 457 camp complexes. Some of the major concentration and slave labour camps consisted of dozens of subsidiary camps scattered over a broad area. At the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, the number of subcamps was 97. The Auschwitz camp complex (Auschwitz I, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, and Auschwitz III-Monowitz) had 48 satellite camps; their detailed descriptions are provided by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. Stutthof concentration camp had 40 subcamps officially and as many as 105 subcamps in operation, some as far as Elbląg, Bydgoszcz and Toruń, at a distance of from the main camp. The camp system was one of the key instruments of terror, while at the same time providing necessary labour for the German war economy.

The camp system was one of the key instruments of terror, while at the same time providing necessary labour for the German war economy. Historians estimate that some 5 million Polish citizens (including Polish Jews) went through them. Impartial scientific research into prisoner statistics became possible only after the collapse of the Soviet Empire in 1989, because in the preceding decades all inhabitants of the eastern half of the country annexed by the USSR in 1939 were described as citizens of the Soviet Union in the official communist statistics.

== Overview ==
Before the September 1939 Invasion of Poland, the concentration camps built in Nazi Germany held mainly German Jews and political enemies of the Nazi regime. Everything changed dramatically with the onset of World War II. The Nazi concentration camps (&quot;Konzentrationslager&quot;, KL or KZ) set up across the entire German-occupied Europe were redesigned to exploit the labor of foreign captives and prisoners of war at high mortality rate for maximum profit. Millions of ordinary people were enslaved as part of the German war effort. According to research by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Nazi Germany created some 42,500 camps and ghettos in which an estimated 15 to 20 million people were imprisoned. All types of confinement were used as a source of labour supply.

Between 1941 and 1943, the concerted effort to destroy the European Jews entirely led to the creation of extermination camps by the SS for the sole purpose of mass murder in gas chambers. During the Holocaust, many transit camps as well as newly formed Jewish ghettos across German occupied Poland served as collection points for deportation under the guise of &quot;resettlement&quot;. The unsuspecting victims used to mistakenly perceive their own deportations as work summons. The Germans turned Auschwitz into a major death camp by expanding its extermination facilities. It was only after the majority of Jews from all Nazi ghettos were annihilated that the cement gas chambers and crematoria were blown up in a systematic attempt to hide the evidence of genocide. The cremation ovens working around the clock till November 25, 1944, were blown up at Auschwitz by the orders of SS chief Heinrich Himmler.

== Extermination camps ==
The vision of the Final Solution had crystallised in the minds of the Nazi leadership during a five-week period, from 18 September to 25 October 1941. It coincided with the German victories on the Eastern Front which yielded over 500,000 new POWs near Moscow. During this time, the concept of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Lebensraum&quot; was redefined. Different methods of industrial-scale murder were tested and the sites of the extermination camps were selected.

The new extermination policy was spelled out at the Wannsee Conference near Berlin in January 1942, leading to the attempt at &quot;murdering every last Jew in the German grasp&quot; thereafter. In early 1942 the German Nazi government constructed killing facilities in the territory of occupied Poland for the secretive Operation Reinhard. The extermination camps (&quot;Vernichtungslager&quot;) were added to already functioning extermination through labor systems, including at Auschwitz &quot;Konzentrationslager&quot; and Majdanek; both operating in a dual capacity until the end of the war. In total, the Nazi German death factories (&quot;Vernichtungs- oder Todeslager&quot;) designed to systematically murder trainloads of people by gassing under the guise of a shower, included the following:

The primary function of death camps was the murder of Jews from all countries occupied by Germany, except the Soviet Union (Soviet Jews were generally murdered by death squads). Non-Jewish Poles and other prisoners were also murdered in these camps; an estimated 75,000 non-Jewish Poles were murdered at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Most extermination camps had regular concentration camps set up along with them including Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and Treblinka I. However, these camps were &quot;distinct from the adjoining extermination camps&quot;.

== Concentration camps ==
At the beginning of the war, the new Stutthof concentration camp near Gdańsk served exclusively for the internment and extermination of the Polish elites. Before long, it became a nightmare of Moloch with 105 subcamps extending as far as 200 kilometres south into the heartland of Poland and more than 60,000 dead before the war&#x27;s end, mainly non-Jewish Poles. As far as forced labour, there was little difference between camp categories in Poland except for the level of punitive actions. Some camps were built so that the prisoners could be worked to death out of the public eye; this policy was called &quot;Vernichtung durch Arbeit&quot; (annihilation through work). Large numbers of non-Jewish Poles were held in these camps, as were various prisoners from other countries. Among the major concentration camps run by SS for the purpose of wilful killing of forced labourers, the most notable examples included the Soldau concentration camp in Działdowo, and the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp made famous in the feature film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and the &quot;Inheritance&quot; documentary.

The Gross-Rosen concentration camp located in Rogoźnica, Poland (part of the German Silesia in World War II), was surrounded by a network of 97 satellite camps (&quot;Aussenlager&quot;) populated with Polish nationals expelled from Nazi &quot;Wartheland&quot; in the process of ethnic cleansing. By October 1943, most inmates were Polish Jews including nearly 26,000 women. There were similar camps, built locally, at Budzyń, Janowska, Poniatowa, Skarżysko-Kamienna (HASAG), Starachowice, Trawniki and Zasław servicing Nazi German startups which ballooned during this period. War profiteers set up camps in the vicinity of the ghettos via &quot;Arbeitsamt&quot;, as in Siedlce, the Mińsk Ghetto (Krupp), and numerous other towns with virtually nothing to eat.

== War economy of Nazi Germany ==
Following the failure of the Blitzkrieg strategy on the Eastern Front, the year 1942 marked the turning point in the German &quot;total war&quot; economy. The use of slave labour increased massively. About 12 million people, most of whom were Eastern Europeans, were interned for the purpose of labour exploitation inside Nazi Germany. Millions of camp inmates were used virtually for free by major German corporations such as Thyssen, Krupp, IG Farben, Bosch, Blaupunkt, Daimler-Benz, Demag, Henschel, Junkers, Messerschmitt, Philips, Siemens, and even Volkswagen, not to mention the German subsidiaries of foreign firms, such as &quot;Fordwerke&quot; (Ford Motor Company) and Adam Opel AG (a subsidiary of General Motors) among others. The foreign subsidiaries were seized and nationalized by the Nazis. Work conditions deteriorated rapidly. The German need for slave labour grew to the point that even the foreign children have been kidnapped in an operation called the &quot;Heuaktion&quot; in which 40,000 to 50,000 Polish children aged 10 to 14 were used as slave labour. More than 2,500 German companies profited from slave labour during the Nazi era, including Deutsche Bank.

The prisoners were deported to camps servicing German state projects of Organization Schmelt, and the war profiteering Nazi companies controlled by SS-WVHA and &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot; (RAD) in charge of &quot;Arbeitseinsatz&quot;, such as &quot;Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe&quot; (DWB), &quot;Deutsche Ausrüstungswerke&quot; (DAW), and the massive Organisation Todt (OT), which built Siegfried Line, Valentin submarine pens, and launch pads for the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket, among other slave labour projects such as the SS Ostindustrie GmbH, or private enterprises making German uniforms such as Többens and Schultz.

=== Labour camp categories ===
The Germans pressed large numbers of Poles and Polish Jews into forced labour. The labourers, imprisoned in German &quot;Arbeitslager&quot; camps and subcamps across Poland and the Reich, worked for a broad range of war-related industries from armaments production and electronics to army uniforms and garments. At most camps, including Buchenwald, the Poles and Polish Jews deported from Pomerania and Silesia were denied recognition as Polish nationals. Their true numbers can never be known. Only 35,000 Poles who were still alive in 1945 came back to Poland and registered as Buchenwald survivors, others remained in the West.
The Gross-Rosen population accounted for 11% of the total number of inmates in Nazi concentration camps by 1944, and yet by 1945 nothing remained of it due to death march evacuation. Auschwitz ran about 50 subcamps with 130,000-140,000 Poles on record, used as slave labour. Over half of them were murdered there; others were shipped to other complexes. There were hundreds of &quot;Arbeitslager&quot; camps in operation, where at least 1.5 million Poles performed hard labour at any given time. Many of the subcamps were transient in nature, being opened and closed according to the labour needs of the occupier. There were also around 30 &quot;Polenlager&quot; camps among them, formally identified in Silesia as permanent (see list) such as Gorzyce and Gorzyczki. Many of the 400,000 Polish prisoners of war captured by Germans during the 1939 invasion of Poland were also imprisoned in these camps, although many of them were sent as forced labourers to the heartland of Germany. Several types of labor camps in this category were distinguished by German bureaucracy.
#&quot;Arbeitslager&quot; was general-purpose term for labor camps in the direct sense.

== Prisoner of war camps ==
The Germans established several camps for prisoners of war (POWs) from the western Allied countries in territory which before 1939 had been part of Poland. There was a major POW camp at Toruń (Thorn, called Stalag XX-A) and another at Łódź with hundreds of subsidiary &quot;Arbeitskommandos&quot;; Stalag VIII-B, Stalag XXI-D, plus a network of smaller ones including district camps. Many Soviet prisoners-of-war were also brought to occupied Poland, where most of them were murdered in slave labor camps. The POW camp in Grądy (Stalag 324) held 100,000 Soviet prisoners; 80,000 of them perished. The Germans did not recognise Soviets as POWs and several million of them died in German hands. They were fed only once a day, and the meal would consist of bread, margarine and soup.

== The victims ==
The Polish nation lost the largest portion of its pre-war population during World War II. Out of Poland&#x27;s pre-war population of 34,849,000, about 6 millionconstituting 17% of its totalperished during the German occupation. There were 240,000 military deaths, 3,000,000 Polish-Jewish Holocaust victims, and 2,760,000 civilian deaths (see World War II casualties backed with real research and citations).

The Polish government has issued a number of decrees, periodically updated, providing for the surviving Polish victims of wartime (and post-war) repression, and has produced lists of the various camps where Poles (defined both as citizens of Poland regardless of ethnicity, and persons of Polish ethnicity of other citizenship) were detained either by the Germans or by the Soviets.

== Camps after the liberation ==
German camps were liberated by the Red Army and Polish Army in 1944 or 1945. A number of camps were subsequently used by the Soviets or Polish communist regime as POW or labor camps for Germans, Poles, Ukrainians, e.g.: Zgoda labour camp, Central Labour Camp Potulice, Łambinowice camp.

== Decrees of Polish Parliament ==
On 20 September 2001 the Sejm of the Republic of Poland introduced a special bill devoted to commemoration of Poland&#x27;s citizens subjected to forced labour under German rule during World War II. The bill confirmed various categories of camp victims as defined during the founding of the Institute of National Remembrance (Dz.U.97.141.943), but most importantly, named every Nazi German concentration camp and subcamp with Polish nationals in them. The list was compiled for legal purposes as reference for survivors seeking international recognition and/or compensation action. It included Soviet and Stalinist places of detention as well. Among the Nazi German camps were 23 main camps with Polish prisoners, including 49 subcamps of Auschwitz, 140 subcamps of Buchenwald, 94 subcamps of KZ Dachau, 83 subcamps of KZ Flossenbürg, 97 subcamps of Gross-Rosen, 54 subcamps of KZ Mauthausen, 55 subcamps of Natzweiler, 67 subcamps of KZ Neuengamme, 26 subcamps of Ravensbrück, 55 subcamps of KZ Sachsenhausen, 28 subcamps of Stutthof, 24 subcamps of Mittelbau and others. Without exception, they were set up by the Germans for the abuse and exploitation of foreign nationals.

Naming of the camps by western media often cause controversies due to the usage of ambiguous phrase &quot;Polish death camps&quot; discouraged by the Polish and Israeli governments as loaded. All camps built in occupied Poland were German. They were set up during the reign of the Nazis over German-occupied Europe. Sporadically, the controversy is caused by the lack of sensitivity toward the history of the German occupation of Poland with comments made without awareness of the controversy.

<text>The Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry is a committee of the United States Senate empowered with legislative oversight of all matters relating to the nation&#x27;s agriculture industry, farming programs, forestry and logging, and legislation relating to nutrition, home economics, and rural development.

The current chair is Republican John Boozman of Arkansas, and the ranking member is Democrat Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

==History==
Founded in 1825 the committee was formed at the request of Senator William Findlay from Pennsylvania. Arguing that agriculture was as important to national progress as commerce and manufacturing, Findlay succeeded in persuading the full Senate to divide the Committee on Commerce and Manufactures into two separate committees. The Committee on Agriculture was formed by resolution on December 9, 1825.

During the first four decades of the existence of this committee, the need for it was repeatedly called into question. At that time in America, nearly two-thirds of the population was directly engaged in agriculture. As such, issues related to agriculture overlapped with areas covered by other committees and were often referred to those committees instead of the Agriculture Committee.

Following a debate over the necessity of various committees to have need of the services of a dedicated clerk, a Special Committee was formed to investigate ways to &quot;reduce the number and increase the efficiency of the committees.&quot; On February 17, 1857, the Special Committee submitted a plan of reorganization for the committees that did not include the Agriculture Committee. During a special session of the Senate, on March 5, 1857, the Senate approved the Special Committees recommendations and the Committee on Agriculture was dissolved.

In 1862, the country was embroiled in the Civil War, a large influx of immigrants was occurring and the nation was moving towards industrialization. That year, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Organic Act recreating the Department of Agriculture.

It became the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry in 1884, a reflection of the growing importance of forests to the country&#x27;s needs. It was renamed again to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry in 1977. Nutrition was added to the name after the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 directed the Department of Agriculture to &quot;conduct more human nutrition research, establish a national nutrition education program and develop a system to monitor America&#x27;s nutritional status&quot;.

==Jurisdiction==
In accordance of Rule XXV of the United States Senate, all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to the following subjects are referred to the Agriculture Committee:
# Agricultural economics and research.

# Animal industry and diseases.
# Crop insurance and soil conservation.
# Farm credit and farm security.
# Food from fresh waters.

# Rural development, rural electrification, and watersheds.
# School nutrition programs.

The Agriculture Committee is also charged &quot;to study and review, on a comprehensive basis, matters relating to food, nutrition, and hunger, both in the United States and in foreign countries, and rural affairs, and report thereon from time to time.&quot;

<text>The Auschwitz concentration camp complex was a system of concentration camps (, abbreviated as either &quot;KL&quot; or &quot;KZ&quot;) run by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland from 1940 to 1945. The main camp (German: &quot;Stammlager&quot;) was Auschwitz I. Auschwitz II, or Birkenau, was a concentration and extermination camp, and became the most notorious of the camps. Auschwitz III, or Monowitz, was a labour camp.

In addition to the three largest camps, Auschwitz consisted of several subcamps. The satellite camps were named &quot;Aussenlager&quot; (external camp), &quot;Nebenlager&quot; (extension or subcamp), and &quot;Arbeitslager&quot; (labour camp). Several lay within of the main camp, with prisoner populations ranging from dozens to several thousand.

==KL Auschwitz==
=== Administration ===

As the size and purpose of Auschwitz changed during World War II, its structure and chain of command changed too. From 1940 to late 1943, Auschwitz I was the &quot;Stammlager&quot; and the other camps were subordinate to it. In November 1943 Birkenau and Monowitz became independent camps with their own commandants, although the commandant of Auschwitz I remained the senior officer. Auschwitz I and Birkenau were placed back under one command in November 1944, and Auschwitz III was named Monowitz.

===Commandants===
*Auschwitz I: Rudolf Höss (May 1940 – November 1943), Arthur Liebehenschel from (November 1943 – May 1944), Richard Baer (May 1944 – 27 January 1945)
*Birkenau: Fritz Hartjenstein (November 1943 – May 1944), Josef Kramer (May 1944 – November 1944). Other: Johann Schwarzhuber (overseer, men&#x27;s camp, November 1943 – November 1944)
*Monowitz: Heinrich Schwarz (November 1943 – January 1945)

<doc id="512516" wikidata="Q2747635" url="?curid=512516" title="Night of the Big Wind">
<text>The Night of the Big Wind () was a powerful European windstorm that swept across what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, beginning on the afternoon of 6 January 1839, causing severe damage to property and several hundred deaths. 20 to 25% of houses in north Dublin were damaged or destroyed, and 42 ships were wrecked. The storm attained a very low barometric pressure of and tracked eastwards to the north of Ireland, with gusts of over before moving across the north of England to continental Europe, where it eventually dissipated. At the time, it was the worst storm to hit Ireland for 300 years. Liverpool also suffered severely, with many shipwrecks and much structural damage. 120 people died as a result of such accidents in the city alone. Two major shipwrecks resulted in damage of at least £500,000, .

==Meteorological situation==
The storm developed after a period of unusual weather. Heavy snow, rare in Ireland, fell across the country on the night of 5 January, which was replaced on the morning of 6 January by an Atlantic warm front, which brought a period of complete calm with dense, motionless, cloud cover. Through the day, temperatures rose well above their seasonal average, resulting in rapid melting of the snow.

Later on 6 January, a deep Atlantic depression began to move towards Ireland, forming a cold front when it collided with the warm air over land, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. First reports of stormy weather came from western County Mayo around noon, and the storm moved very slowly across the island through the day, gathering strength as it moved. By midnight the winds reached hurricane force. 

==Damage==

Contemporary accounts of damage indicate that the Night of the Big Wind was the most severe storm to affect Ireland for many centuries. It is estimated that between 250 and 300 people lost their lives in the storm. Severe property damage was caused, particularly in Connacht, but also in Ulster and northern Leinster. Between a fifth and a quarter of all houses in Dublin suffered damage ranging from broken windows to complete destruction. Much of the inland damage was caused by a storm surge that drew large quantities of sea water inland, resulting in widespread flooding.

Even well-built buildings suffered structural damage, including new factories and military barracks. The newly constructed St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Derrytrasna was completely destroyed; one of the steeples of the Church of Ireland church in Castlebar was blown down, and a number of large country houses were unroofed. Among the poorly built homes of the poor, damage was more severe and many were completely destroyed. A total of 42 ships, most along the less sheltered west coast, were wrecked while unsuccessfully trying to ride out the storm: a majority of the recorded casualties occurred at sea.

Stacks of hay and corn were widely destroyed, resulting in severe starvation among livestock in the following months.

==Legacy==

The Night of the Big Wind became part of Irish folk tradition. Irish folklore held that Judgment Day would occur on the Feast of the Epiphany, 6 January. Such a severe storm led many to believe that the end of the world was at hand.

The Old Age Pensions Act 1908 introduced pensions for over-70s, but many Irish Catholics prior to the Registration of Births and Deaths (Ireland) Act 1863 had no birth registration. One of the questions used to establish proof of age was whether the applicant remembered the Night of the Big Wind.

==Related writing==

Irish language poems about the event include &quot;Oíche na Gaoithe Móire&quot; by Micheál de Búrc (c.1800–1881) and &quot;Oíche Nollaig na mBan&quot; by Seán Ó Ríordáin (1916–1977). The latter&#x27;s title means &quot;Night of Women&#x27;s Christmas&quot;; Women&#x27;s Christmas is observed in Ireland on the feast of the Epiphany (6 January). The first verse describes a storm on that date (5 January) while the second recounts the poet&#x27;s desire that his eventual death should coincide with a similar storm.

<text>Kenneth Clarke Spearman (January 9, 1914January 26, 1985), known professionally as Kenny Clarke and nicknamed Klook, was an American jazz drummer and bandleader. A major innovator of the bebop style of drumming, he pioneered the use of the ride cymbal to keep time rather than the hi-hat, along with the use of the bass drum for irregular accents (&quot;dropping bombs&quot;).

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he was orphaned at the age of about five and began playing the drums when he was eight or nine on the urging of a teacher at his orphanage. Turning professional in 1931 at the age of seventeen, he moved to New York City in 1935 when he began to establish his drumming style and reputation. As the house drummer at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse in the early 1940s, he participated in the after-hours jams that led to the birth of bebop. After military service in the US and Europe between 1943 and 1946, he returned to New York, but from 1948 to 1951 he was mostly based in Paris. He stayed in New York between 1951 and 1956, performing with the Modern Jazz Quartet and playing on early Miles Davis recordings. He then moved permanently to Paris, where he performed and recorded with European and visiting American musicians and co-led the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band between 1961 and 1972. He continued to perform and record until the month before he died of a heart attack in January 1985.

==Biography==
===Early life and career (1914–1935)===
Clarke was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on January 9, 1914 as the youngest of two sons, to Martha Grace Scott, a pianist from Pittsburgh, and Charles Spearman, a trombonist from Waycross, Georgia. The family home was on Wylie Avenue in the Lower Hill District of Pittsburgh. Clarke&#x27;s father left the household to start a new family in Yakima, Washington, and his mother, who began a relationship with a Baptist preacher shortly afterwards, died suddenly in her late twenties when Clarke was about five, leaving him an orphan. He and his brother were placed in the Coleman Industrial Home for Negro Boys. He played in the orphanage&#x27;s marching band on the snare drum, which he had taken up on the urging of a teacher at about age eight or nine, after trying a few brass instruments. When he was young he also played the piano, on which his mother had taught him to play simple tunes, along with the pump organ at the parish church, for which he played hymns and composed pieces that were introduced there. At the age of eleven or twelve, he and his brother resumed living with his stepfather, who did not look favorably upon music or associating with those involved with it. He dropped out of Herron Hill Junior High School at the age of fifteen. Around the same time, his stepfather threw Clarke and his brother out of his house after an argument, and Clarke was placed without his brother in a foster home, where he lived for about a year until his sixteenth birthday.

He then took on several odd jobs while establishing his music career, becoming a local professional with the Leroy Bradley Band by the age of seventeen. After touring with the Roy Eldridge band through Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio, he returned to Bradley&#x27;s band based at the Cotton Club in Cincinnati. He stayed with that band for two years, broken up by a two-month stint with the Jeter-Pillars Orchestra, which at the time included trumpeter Harry Edison and bassist Walter Page, who would go on to be featured in the Count Basie Orchestra. Around this time he took up the vibraphone, with assistance from Adrian Rollini, a pioneer on the instrument.

===Move to New York and innovations (1935–1943)===
In late-1935, Clarke moved to New York City, where he dropped the surname Spearman to become known as Kenny Clarke. He doubled on drums and the vibraphone in a trio with his half-brother Frank, a bassist and guitarist who had recently moved to New York and likewise changed his surname from Spearman to Clarke to profit from Kenny&#x27;s newfound fame. In 1936, Clarke played alongside guitarist Freddie Green in a group fronted by tenor saxophonist Lonnie Simmons, where he began to experiment with rhythmic patterns against the basic beat of the band. From April 1937 to April 1938, he was in Edgar Hayes&#x27;s group, still doubling on vibraphone, where he made his recording debut and traveled overseas for the first time. When he returned to the US with the band, he struck up a personal and musical friendship with trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie who had been hired for the group&#x27;s one-week stint at the Apollo Theater in New York. In his book &quot;Drummin&#x27; Men: The Heartbeat of Jazz&quot;, music critic Burt Korall writes of this time period: &quot;Clarke was moving beyond mere functional timekeeping. He had begun to outline and emphasize ensemble, brass, and saxophone figures and to support soloists in the manner that before long would be identified as his. ... The revision of the swing drum style had not yet become fully apparent. But it was clear Clarke was working on something new.&quot; He was encouraged in these endeavors by composer/arranger Joe Garland, who gave him the band&#x27;s trumpet parts, and suggested that he play along with the brass when he felt it necessary to emphasize or support their lines.

He then spent eight months playing drums and the vibraphone in Claude Hopkins&#x27;s group, before Gillespie gave Clarke an opening to join him in the Teddy Hill band in the Savoy Ballroom in 1939. While playing for this group on a fast tune, he came upon the idea of using the ride cymbal on his right hand to keep time rather than the hi-hat, an approach that freed up his left hand to play more syncopated figures. On the bass drum he played irregular accents (dropping bombs), while using the hi-hat on the backbeats, adding more color to his drumming. With Gillespie, who encouraged this new approach to time keeping, Clarke wrote a series of exercises for himself to develop the independence of the bass drum and snare drum, while maintaining the time on the ride cymbal. One of these passages, a combination of a rimshot on the snare followed directly by a &quot;bomb&quot;, reportedly inspired Clarke&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Klook&quot;, which was short for &quot;Klook-mop&quot;, in imitation of the sound this combination produced. At the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Clarke played opposite a band led by fellow drummer Chick Webb, who strongly influenced him and encouraged his rhythmic explorations. He was briefly fired from Hill&#x27;s band due to unrest in the trombone section about his unorthodox time-keeping methods, but later returned and stayed with the group until it disbanded in 1940. He then worked with bands led by Sidney Bechet, Ella Fitzgerald (where he and Gillespie are said to have co-written the composition &quot;Salt Peanuts&quot;), and Louis Armstrong, before working with Roy Eldridge once again along with the Count Basie Orchestra. He also made recordings with Bechet, Fitzgerald, and Mildred Bailey.

In 1941, Clarke was hired by Hill, who had become the manager of Minton&#x27;s Playhouse in Harlem, to handle the music at the club. Clarke was given free rein over whom he could hire and which style of music he could play. The house band consisted of trumpeter Joe Guy, pianist Thelonious Monk, bassist Nick Fenton, and Clarke on drums. Regulars at the club included Gillespie and guitarist Charlie Christian, and bandleaders such as Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Benny Goodman listened to or participated in the sessions. In his entry on Clarke in &quot;American National Biography&quot;, Barry Kernfeld wrote: &quot;The sessions became famous for demonstrations of virtuosity—unexpected harmonies, fast tempos, unusual keys—that discouraged those whose style did not fit in well. These experimental sounds were crucial to the development of bebop.&quot; It was in this setting that Clarke and Monk co-wrote the jazz standard &quot;Epistrophy&quot;, originally known as &quot;Fly Right&quot;. He then led his own band at Kelly&#x27;s Stables in New York, the Kansas City Six, featuring tenor saxophonist Ike Quebec (where the two are said to have come up with the riff tune &quot;Mop Mop&quot;, later associated with Sid Catlett), and played in a septet with saxophonist Benny Carter, as well as with Red Allen&#x27;s band in Boston and Chicago.

===Military service and later career in the United States (1943–1956)===
Clarke was drafted into the US Army and reported for induction in 1943. During his basic training in 1944, he married singer Carmen McRae. He went absent without leave for nearly four months, during which time he played with Cootie Williams and Dinah Washington, before being captured and sent to Europe. He eventually became part of the Special Services where he led and sang in chorales and performed on drums, trombone, and piano in various bands. While in Paris he met pianist and arranger John Lewis, with whom he began a long association.

Shortly after being discharged from the military in 1946, Clarke converted to Islam and took the name Liaquat Ali Salaam. He joined Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s band for eight months, replacing Max Roach, who had become the most important bebop drummer in Clarke&#x27;s absence. Clarke introduced Lewis to the band and made several bop recordings with Gillespie&#x27;s sextet including &quot;One Bass Hit (part 1)&quot; and &quot;Oop Bop Sh&#x27;Bam&quot;, where his nickname was enshrined in the scat lyrics &quot;Oop bop sh&#x27;bam a klook a mop&quot;. He left Gillespie&#x27;s band temporarily and worked with Tadd Dameron, Sonny Stitt, Fats Navarro, and his own 52nd Street Boys, before rejoining Gillespie&#x27;s group in December 1947. He embarked on a tour with the band in Europe in early 1948, which he considered the highlight of his career. He stayed on in Paris until that August, recording, performing, teaching, and helping to select musicians for the First International Jazz Festival. He then returned to New York for nine months to work with Dameron&#x27;s group at the Royal Roost. During this time he also played with bassist Oscar Pettiford&#x27;s band and recorded in the second session of what became the Miles Davis album &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;. Also around this time, or perhaps shortly afterward, he developed an addiction to heroin that lasted until at least the 1960s. In 1948, he permanently separated from McRae; they divorced in 1956. In May 1949, Clarke returned to Paris for the festival, making the city his home base for the next two years. While there he worked and recorded with bands led by pianist Bernard Peiffer and saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, and returned to Bechet&#x27;s band. At this time he met and had a brief affair with jazz singer Annie Ross, which resulted in a son, Kenny Clarke Jr. (born 1950), who was raised by Clarke&#x27;s brother and his wife.

Upon returning to New York in 1951, he toured with Billy Eckstine, and made recordings with saxophonist Charlie Parker&#x27;s quintet and Milt Jackson&#x27;s quartet. Jackson&#x27;s ensemble, which included Clarke&#x27;s friend John Lewis, became the Modern Jazz Quartet, and he performed with the group at the first Newport Jazz Festival in 1954 and recorded for their albums &quot;Modern Jazz Quartet&quot; (1952), &quot;1953: An Exceptional Encounter&quot; (1953), and &quot;Django&quot; (1953–1955). He left the ensemble in 1955, saying &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be able to play the drums my way again after four or five years of playing eighteenth-century drawing-room jazz&quot;. Korall wrote of his work in the group:
Between 1951 and 1954, Clarke recorded with Miles Davis, including tracks that appeared on the 1957 compilation albums &quot;Bags&#x27; Groove&quot; and &quot;Walkin&#x27;&quot;, along with 1959&#x27;s &quot;Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants&quot;. Korall described these recordings as &quot;his best work of the 1950s – perhaps of his entire career&quot;, writing: &quot;Clarke follows feelings, lives inside the pulse, defining the contours, dynamics, and implications of each solo and each piece. Like Dave Tough, he is a totally unselfish player – nonintrusive yet spirited and spiritual.&quot; In mid-1955 he rejoined Pettiford&#x27;s group at Café Bohemia, later working with him and pianist Phineas Newborn Jr. at Basin Street West and recording with Pettiford on Newborn&#x27;s 1956 album &quot;Here Is Phineas&quot;. During this period he was the resident drummer and a talent scout for Savoy Records, introducing the label to artists such as saxophonists Cannonball Adderley and Pepper Adams, and trumpeter Donald Byrd. He often worked with recording engineer Rudy Van Gelder, who dubbed Clarke&#x27;s location in his studio &quot;Klook&#x27;s corner&quot;.

===Move to Paris and later life (1956–1985)===

In September 1956, Clarke moved to Paris where he initially worked with Jacques Hélian&#x27;s orchestra, before holding engagements at the Club Saint-Germain and the Blue Note. He regularly worked with visiting American musicians such as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, and Stan Getz, contributing with Davis to the soundtrack recording for &quot;Ascenseur pour l&#x27;échafaud&quot; (&quot;Elevator to the Gallows&quot;). Clarke also formed a trio, known as &quot;The Three Bosses&quot;, with pianist Bud Powell, another Paris resident, and bassist Pierre Michelot, who also performed on the Davis soundtrack. In 1963, The Three Bosses recorded the album &quot;Our Man in Paris&quot; with tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon. In 1961, with Belgian pianist Francy Boland, Clarke formed the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band, featuring leading European and expatriate American musicians. It began touring in 1966 and was active until 1972. Korall said of his contribution to the band: &quot;Playing softer than most drummers in a large ensemble, feeding the surge, doing the work of the great accompanist he always had been, Clarke consistently proved flash is totally irrelevant. He used just enough decoration to make the band&#x27;s music, much of it with a blues base, a bit more exciting and interesting for the players and listeners.&quot;

In 1962, he married Daisy Wallbach, a Dutch woman, and they settled in the Paris suburb of Montreuil. The couple had a son, Laurent (born 1964). Clarke began a drumming school with Dante Agostini at the headquarters of the instrument maker Henri Selmer Paris in 1965, and he and Agostini spent seven years creating a drumming method. In 1967, he began teaching at the Saint-Germain-en-Laye Conservatoire (where he worked until 1972). He had a period of convalescence after a heart attack in 1975, before going to Chicago in September 1976 for a reunion of Gillespie&#x27;s big band. In 1979, he taught jazz at the University of Pittsburgh as a substitute for his friend Nathan Davis. He continued to perform at European jazz festivals until 1983 and made his last performances at a five-night-a-week engagement in December 1984. On January 26, 1985, he died of a second heart attack at his home; he was 71.

==Recognition==
Clarke was made an NEA Jazz Master in 1983 and inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame through the Critics&#x27; Poll in 1988. In 2024, he was inducted into Jazz at Lincoln Center&#x27;S Nesuhi Ertegun Jazz Hall of Fame.

<text>Strip games or stripping games are games which have clothing removal as a gameplay element or mechanic.

== Classification ==

There are two broad categories of these games: the first are sexualized, and getting other people to remove their clothes is one of the aims of the game. The second are not sexualized, and the taking off of clothes is done to distinguish between two teams, for instance half the men playing shirts versus skins soccer will remove their shirts in order to visually distinguish between the two teams.

In the sexualized games, the eventual complete loss of clothing is considered part of a usual game in the style of a striptease. Games involving stripping have been invented independently of non-stripping game. Games not normally involving clothing loss can be adapted into strip games. Some rulesets can be adapted more easily than others; but generally strip games are flexible and intended to generate an atmosphere of fun in a group of consenting adults.

== Notable games ==

=== Mahjong ===

Many video games have been published, especially by Japanese software companies.

=== Murchéh daréh ===

&quot;Murcheh dareh che kar konam?&quot; (&quot;There are ants [here], what shall I do?&quot;), or just &quot;Murcheh dareh&quot; (مورچه داره, There Are Ants), is a traditional Iranian dance-based game played by women, although a parody played by men exists (&quot;Zar gazidam&quot;).

=== Poker ===

Strip poker is a party game and a variation of the traditional poker where players remove clothing when they lose a round. Any form of poker can be adapted to a strip form; however, it is usually played with simple variants with few betting rounds, like five-card draw.

Strip poker can be played by single-sex groups or by mixed groups in social situations and intended to generate an atmosphere of fun and to lighten the social atmosphere by the removal of clothing. While the game is sometimes employed as a type of foreplay, it is itself usually not considered a sexual interaction due to the fact that it does not require contact and full nudity is involved only at the end of the game or sometimes not at all (depending on rule variants). The game is sometimes integrated with Truth or Dare? rules. Strip poker has been adapted for solo gameplay, such as by use of online or offline video games.

==== Rules ====

At the beginning of each turn, each player must remove an article of clothing as an ante. If there are two couples playing there should be four shoes in the pot before the cards are dealt. At the outset, one of the articles of clothing is removed from the game permanently. So the winner will receive three articles of clothing in the ante. 

The opener must bet, and they can be raised, just like ordinary poker. After the draw, the players make another bet, like regular poker. Once an article of clothing is removed, it cannot be put back on. The clothing is just used as a stake for betting. Only clothing can be bet. No player may withdraw once the game begins without forfeiting all articles of clothing.

==== Strategy ====

In some rule sets, players who fold before the flop are not required to remove clothing. As such, a player who is uncomfortable removing clothing (or, more commonly, a player who does not want to remove all their clothing first) can simply fold very often or every time before the flop, essentially playing a &quot;tight&quot; pre-flop strategy. Using this strategy, a player could stay clothed for the entire game simply by folding their hands.

Strip poker requires a different overall strategy from poker played with betting chips since the maximum loss on a hand of strip poker is (typically) one item of clothing. In a betting environment, a player who stays in the pot with a weak hand is liable to lose many chips in a single hand. In strip poker, the risk of staying in a hand is significantly limited, so players can play hands with lower probabilities than they would in a cash game. For example, in a cash game, because it occurs only 8% of the time, an inside straight draw might be a poor hand to play, hence the saying &quot;Never draw to an inside straight.&quot; In strip poker, when the potential loss is only one item of clothing whether you fold or call, an 8% chance to win the hand is better than the alternative.

Another variant uses some sort of betting token, allowing for normal poker strategies. Once a player runs out of tokens, they can &quot;sell&quot; a piece of clothing for more tokens in order to stay in the game.

==== History ====

While it has been suggested that strip poker originated in New Orleans brothels in the United States around the same time as original poker in the 19th century, the term is only attested since the 20th century. Strip poker most likely began as a prank or hazing among college-age boys, and as late as the 1930s, the current mixed-gender version was called &quot;mixed strip poker&quot; in England to differentiate it from the all-male variety.

=== Yakyūken ===

Popularised by Kinichi Hagimoto (although he later expressed regret) and inspired by contemporary Japanese baseball pep routines — Yakyūken (野球拳) means &#x27;baseball fist&#x27; — strip games became a popular fixture of comedy and game shows in the mid-20th century initially in the form of yakyūken, in which several rounds of jyan-ken-pon (rock-paper-scissors) are played and televised, with the loser removing a layer of clothing.

== Legality ==

Depending on jurisdiction and the particular circumstances of the game, strip games may encounter regulation on the grounds of clothes-wearing (or not wearing) norms, gaming and gambling, and sexual expression. Additionally, verbally coercing someone to play a strip game is often considered a form of sexual harassment.

In 2013, the concept of strip sports betting was launched in the United States by creating live internet broadcasts using models and pornstars who bet on football games and take their clothes off as they lose.

<text>Sara Bettine Storer (born 6 October 1973) is an Australian country music singer-songwriter and former teacher. She won a record breaking seven Golden Guitar awards in the Tamworth Country Music Festival in January 2004, and as of 2017, she has won 21 in total. Four of her seven studio albums have reached the top 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart, &quot;Firefly&quot; (July 2005), &quot;Lovegrass&quot; (August 2013), &quot;Silos&quot; (March 2016), and &quot;Raindance (Sara Storer album)&quot; (January 2019). &quot;Silos&quot; also won Best Country Album at the ARIA Music Awards of 2016. Storer has been a member of a country music trio, Songbirds (2007–09) alongside Beccy Cole and Gina Jeffries. Her older brother, Greg Storer, is also a country music singer-songwriter and the siblings have recorded and performed together.

==Early career==
Sara Bettine Storer was born in October 1973 in Wemen where her parents, Lindsay and Fay Storer, farmed wheat and cattle on a property. Her three brothers, including Doug and Greg Storer, became farmers, she also has two older sisters. She attended school in nearby, Robinvale.

Storer later recalled, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t much of a farmer&#x27;s daughter. Three brothers – they did everything and they enjoyed it. I would rather sit at home and help out with mum really. I was scared of cattle. I always got yelled at cos I was in the wrong spot you know, didn&#x27;t really know what I was doing. I was never very good.&quot; She completed her tertiary studies in Melbourne, becoming a teacher and then headed north in the mid-1990s. Living in Camooweal, she met a retired water buffalo shooter, Harry Chandler, whose stories inspired her to write, &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;, her first song.

Nine months later, Storer moved to Katherine, Northern Territory, where she taught kindergarten level at Casuarina Street Primary School. After a year there she taught at Kalkarindji ( southwest of Katherine), for four years. Later she co-wrote and recorded a track, &quot;Children of the Gurindji&quot;, with Kev Carmody, for her compilation album, &quot;Calling Me Home – The Best of Sara Storer&quot; (April 2010).

Carmody told Rhoda Roberts of &quot;Deadly Vibe&quot;, &quot;[Storer] came up here about 12 months ago and we did a song about the Gurindji kids together. The whole basis of the song was, when she went to teach at Kalkarindji – she taught there for a number of years – she said that she came away with the kids teaching her more than she taught them, and that was the chorus of the song.&quot;

When not teaching she started playing at parties across the territory. She won a talent quest at Adelaide River which provided a scholarship to the College of Country Music, held two weeks before the Tamworth Country Music Festival, in January 2000. There she met Garth Porter, former keyboard player with Sherbet, and a record producer of fellow singers, Lee Kernaghan and Gina Jeffreys. Porter worked with Storer to record six tracks which he showcased to ABC Music&#x27;s owners, who agreed to sign her to their label.

==Recording career==
===2000–2009===
Sara Storer released her debut studio album, &quot;Chasing Buffalo&quot;, in August 2000 via ABC Music/Universal Music Australia with Porter producing. It peaked in the ARIA Albums Chart top 100, No. 20 on the Australasian Artists, No. 8 on the Hitseekers and No. 6 on the Country albums charts. She won the Best New Talent category at the 2001 Country Music Awards of Australia for her debut single, &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;, in January of that year.

Her second album, &quot;Beautiful Circle&quot;, was released in November 2002, which was produced by Porter again. In January 2004 at the Country Music Awards of Australia she was nominated for eight Golden Guitars, and won seven of them – a then-record number of trophies at one ceremony: Vocal Collaboration, Single of the Year and Song of the Year all for &quot;Raining on the Plains&quot; (with John Williamson); Female Vocalist of the Year and Album of the Year for &quot;Beautiful Circle&quot;, Songwriter of the Year for &quot;Raining on the Plains&quot; (co-written with Porter and Greg Storer); Bush Ballad of the Year for &quot;Boss Drovers Pride&quot; and Heritage Song of the Year for &quot;Drover&#x27;s Call&quot;.

The album reached No. 50 on the ARIA Albums Chart in March 2004. It also peaked at No. 11 on the Australasian Artists, No. 1 on the Hitseekers and No. 2 on the Country albums charts. She promoted it by touring with Australian country singer, Troy Cassar-Daley, and United Kingdom singer, Charlie Landsborough, including playing to an audience of over 40,000 people at the Gympie Muster, Queensland. On 6 October 2004 she issued her first DVD, &quot;Stories to Tell&quot;, which included music videos, interview footage, acoustic performances and new tracks.

&quot;Firefly&quot;, was Storer&#x27;s third album, was released in July 2005, which peaked at No. 24 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Porter produced the work and it became her first number-one on the ARIA Country Albums Chart. She co-wrote and recorded duets on three tracks: with Greg (&quot;Chiller&#x27;s Bend&quot;), Josh Cunningham (&quot;Important Things&quot;) and Paul Kelly (&quot;Must&#x27;ve Been a Hell of a Party&quot;).

Kelly described Storer, &quot;You know she&#x27;s paid attention, heard the bush waking up in the morning, listened to the worries thrashed out at the kitchen table, smelt dry summer wheat up close, dreamed of far away places in a bedroom with a window on a big sky, driven miles on dirt and bitumen and fallen in and out of love. She&#x27;s found her own way to sing the stories that are all around her and then inside her bubbling out. She doesn&#x27;t copy over-emotive, fake sincere twangy country singers from overseas. She&#x27;s found her own restraint and steel and lets her songs do their sweet, sly work.&quot;

In December 2005 Deborah Conway established the Broad Festival project, &quot;the idea that I would pull these different women performers together from different genres and call it Broad&quot;. Storer joined Conway, Katie Noonan, Ruby Hunter and Clare Bowditch where they performed their own and each other&#x27;s songs on an Australian tour. Conway observed, &quot;Sara you&#x27;re a gorgeous surprise package, quiet and unassuming offstage; onstage, you had us pissing ourselves every night. I love that simple yet deceptive guitar playing and those haunting songs, which have such a piercing truth to them.&quot;

In March 2006 Storer played at the Queens&#x27; Lunch during the Melbourne Commonwealth Games. In February and March 2007 she performed a double-headlining tour with fellow country musician, Felicity Urquhart. In November of that year she released her fourth studio album, &quot;Silver Skies&quot;, which reached the ARIA Albums Chart top 100 and No. 3 on the Country Albums Chart. It was co-produced by Cunningham and Matt Fell for her new label, EMI Records.

Its lead single, &quot;Land Cries Out&quot;, was released in September 2007, which Andrew Tijs of &quot;Undercover News&quot; described, &quot;an achingly beautiful rumination on the bitterness of being forced to leave the land you love – an all too common scenario during the recent drought. With this heartfelt subject matter, Storer has branched away from traditional country sounds... [she] uses electric guitar and drums to complement the lament.&quot; From late January to early February 2008 she supported a tour by American singer-songwriter, Suzanne Vega.

From 2007 to 2009 she joined Beccy Cole and Gina Jeffreys to form a country music trio, Songbirds. The group released a live DVD, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend: Live in Concert&quot;, on 1 May 2009, which was accredited by ARIA as a gold album by the end of that year. It was recorded at Tamworth in January 2009. It was shown at cinemas from 29 April of that year, Storer opined, &quot;I&#x27;m really proud of the Songbirds: You&#x27;ve Got a Friend live filming but am worried how pregnant I will look shown on a big screen.&quot;

Storer had encouraged her brother Greg, a cropping farmer from &quot;Strawin&quot; north-west of Warren, New South Wales, to write music, she has performed his work, including duets with him and she is recorded on his debut single, &quot;When I Was a Boy&quot; (December 2009). He recalled, &quot;Sara started off telling me to write some lyrics and then every now and then she said I should get up and have a sing at one of her shows. It was absolutely terrifying to get up and sing in front of some great artists... [its] a bit addictive. The trick is to never put the guitar away – in between wrestling with the kids or doing something else, I can just pick up the guitar.&quot;

===2010–2020===
In April 2010, Storer released her first compilation album, &quot;Calling Me Home – The Best of Sara Storer&quot;, which reached No. 28 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No. 1 on the Country Albums Chart. She had recorded three new tracks, &quot;Calling Me Home&quot;, &quot;Children of the Gurundi&quot; (with Kev Carmody) and &quot;Tears&quot;. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 John Williamson was inducted into their Hall of Fame in October, where Storer performed his tune, &quot;Mallee Boy&quot;, in his honour.

The singer-songwriter launched her fifth album, &quot;Lovegrass&quot;, at the Gympie Music Muster in August 2013. She explained her preparation, &quot;I&#x27;m getting there early and we&#x27;re all going to catch up prior to the Muster for a rehearsal, which is a must especially when I&#x27;m releasing a new album and playing the songs with the band for the first time, really. We need a little practice run otherwise we could end up a train smash.&quot; &quot;Lovegrass&quot;, which was produced by Matt Fell, peaked at No. 25 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No. 5 on the Country Albums Chart. In 2015 Storer recorded &quot;Song for Grace&quot;, a duet with Lee Kernaghan for his album, &quot;Spirit of the Anzacs&quot; (March 2015).

In March 2016 Storer released her sixth studio album, &quot;Silos&quot;, also produced by Fell, which peaked at No. 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No. 3 on the Country Music Albums Chart. It earned the musician her sixth nomination for ARIA Award for Best Country Album and her first win in the category, at that year&#x27;s ceremony. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 2017 she received her 21st Golden Guitar – the most by any female artist.

In April 2019, Storer released her 7th studio album, &quot;Raindance&quot;.

===2020–present===
In January 2023, Sara will feature on the self-titled album by Storer, alongside her brother Greg and Greg&#x27;s daughters Bonnie &amp; Pip.

== Personal life==
When Sara Storer was 18, her parents moved from Wemen, Victoria to a farming property near Warren, New South Wales. Storer had lived in Melbourne, moved to Camooweal, North Queensland and then to Katherine and Kalkarindji, Northern Territory in the mid-1990s. By June 2009 Storer was living in Darwin. There she married David O&#x27;Hare, a cattle buyer, in April 2012 and the couple have four children. Storer took a break from song writing while focussing on parenting. O&#x27;Hare left Austrex in February 2014 after being their cattle export manager in Darwin for ten years.

As of May 2017 the family has a farm near Bowna from Albury, they also have a home in Albury. In January of that year she acknowledged her family when receiving her Golden Guitars at the Country Music Awards, &quot;Dave has been a great support when I&#x27;ve gotten down about still doing this with four little boys. I have to thank my boys as well, for giving me a little moment every now and then to get a few lines down on paper.&quot;

<text>The expansion of Flossenbürg concentration camp led to the establishment of subcamps, the first of which was established at Stulln in February 1942 to provide forced labor to a mining company. Many of them were located in the Sudetenland or across the border in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The vast majority were established after 1 March 1944. Initially, the subcamps were not involved in armaments production, which changed in the second half of 1944 due to a large influx of available prisoners and the activities of the &quot;Jägerstab&quot;, which sought to increase German aircraft production. The &quot;Jägerstab&quot;&#x27;s dispersal of aircraft production spurred the expansion of the subcamp system in 1944 and resulted in the establishment of the two largest of the subcamps, at Hersbruck and Leitmeritz. In the second half of 1944, 45 new camps were created, compared to three camps in the previous six months. The staffing these new camps was increasingly filled by Luftwaffe soldiers, &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; SS men (ethnic Germans from outside the Reich), and SS women, for the subcamps containing female prisoners. By April 1945, 80% of the prisoners were at the subcamps. Of all the concentration camp systems, Flossenbürg&#x27;s subcamp system was one of the three most important to the economy of Nazi Germany, along with those of Dachau and Mauthausen.

<text>Bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) is a semiconductor technology that integrates two semiconductor technologies, those of the bipolar junction transistor and the CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) logic gate, into a single integrated circuit. In more recent times the bipolar processes have been extended to include high mobility devices using silicon–germanium junctions.

Bipolar transistors offer high speed, high gain, and low output impedance with relatively high power consumption per device, which are excellent properties for high-frequency analog amplifiers including low noise radio frequency (RF) amplifiers that only use a few active devices, while CMOS technology offers high input impedance and is excellent for constructing large numbers of low-power logic gates. In a BiCMOS process the doping profile and other process features may be tilted to favour either the CMOS or the bipolar devices. For example GlobalFoundries offer a basic 180 nm BiCMOS7WL process and several other BiCMOS processes optimized in various ways. These processes also include steps for the deposition of precision resistors, and high Q RF inductors and capacitors on-chip, which are not needed in a &quot;pure&quot; CMOS logic design.
BiCMOS is aimed at mixed-signal ICs, such as ADCs and complete software radio systems on a chip that need amplifiers, analog power management circuits, and logic gates on chip. BiCMOS has some advantages in providing digital interfaces. BiCMOS circuits use the characteristics of each type of transistor most appropriately. Generally this means that high current circuits such as on chip power regulators use metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) for efficient control, and &#x27;sea of logic&#x27; use conventional CMOS structures, while those portions of specialized very high performance circuits such as ECL dividers and LNAs use bipolar devices. Examples include RF oscillators, bandgap-based references and low-noise circuits.

The SuperSPARC, Pentium and Pentium Pro microprocessors also used BiCMOS, but starting with Pentium II, designed with increasingly smaller (0.35μm) processes and operating at lower voltages, bipolar transistors ceased to offer performance advantages for this sort of application and were removed.

== Disadvantages ==

Some of the advantages of CMOS fabrication, for example very low cost in mass production, do not transfer directly to BiCMOS fabrication. An inherent difficulty arises from the fact that optimizing both the BJT and MOS components of the process is impossible without adding many extra fabrication steps and consequently increased process cost and reduced yield. Finally, in the area of high performance logic, BiCMOS may never offer as low a power consumption as a foundry process optimized for CMOS alone, due to the potential for higher standby leakage current.

<doc id="512529" wikidata="Q1052745" url="?curid=512529" title="Fourrée">
<text>A fourrée is a coin, most often a counterfeit, that is made from a base metal core that has been plated with a precious metal to look like its solid metal counterpart; the term is derived from the French for &quot;stuffed&quot;. The term is normally applied to ancient silver-plated coins such as the Roman denarius and Greek drachma, but the term is also applied to other plated coins.

Cicero mentions that M. Marius Gratidianus, a praetor during the 80s BC, was widely praised for developing tests to detect false coins, and removing them from circulation. Gratidianus was killed under Sulla, who introduced his own anti-forgery law (&quot;lex Cornelia de falsis&quot;), that reintroduced serrated edges on precious metal coins, an anticounterfeiting measure that had been tried earlier.

Serrated denarii, or &quot;serrati&quot;, which featured about 20 notched chisel marks on the edge of the coin, were produced to demonstrate the integrity of the coin. This effort was in vain, as examples of &quot;fourrée serrati&quot; attest.

==Production==

Production of fourrées began almost as early as the production of the first coins in Asia Minor in the 7th century BC. These coins were produced by people wishing to profit by producing a counterfeit containing less precious metal content than its purported face value. The most common method for producing a fourrée was to take a flan of copper, wrap it with silver foil, heat it, and strike it with the dies. If the coin was sufficiently heated and struck hard enough, a layer of eutectic alloy (a mixture of 72% silver and 28% copper that has the lowest melting point of any mixture of these two metals) would be produced, fusing the layers together. Sometimes eutectic was sprinkled between the layers to increase the bond. Exposure of the deception was often due to wear at the high points of the coin, or moisture trapped between the layers that caused the foil to bubble and then break as the core corroded.

A later method for making fourrées involved adding silver to the base metal coin after it had been struck. This method allowed even less silver to be used, which became more important in order to make counterfeiting profitable as the official coinage was debased. The exact method by which these coins were silvered is unclear, although possible methods include dipping the coin in molten silver, brushing the coins with molten silver, or dusting the coin with powdered silver and heating it until the silver melted.

In peripheral regions, even cruder counterfeits might pass: in the Viking-age site in Coppergate, in York, a forgery of an Arab &quot;dirham&quot; was found, struck as if for Isma&#x27;il ibn Achmad (ruling at Samarkand, 903-07/8), of copper covered by a once-silvery wash of tin.

==Detection==

The easiest way to spot a fourrée is by weight, since a fourrée with a copper core would weigh noticeably less than a solid silver coin due to the lower density of copper. The opposite would be true for a fourrée with a lead core.

Another method to determine whether a coin was plated was listening to the sound produced by dropping the coin onto a hard surface since if the coin was solid silver it would have a distinctive ring. Although this was done by contemporary merchants, it is not recommended that this method be used on ancient coin since the coin could be damaged, especially since over time silver coins can become brittle, if the silver begins to recrystallize.

The most obvious way to detect a plated coin would be if the base metal core was damaged or worn, revealing the base metal. There are often chisel or chop marks on ancient silver coins by merchants attempting to determine if a coin was solid. These &quot;banker marks&quot; are most common on Roman denarii of the 1st century BC and 1st century AD.

During the Crisis of the Third Century, constant wars required a lot of coins to be produced, leading to heavy debasing of precious metal coinage. The antoninianus was eventually debased to the point where flans (blank metal disks) were produced with 5% silver or less, and pickled to dissolve the copper from the surface producing a spongy surface of almost pure silver. When these coins struck, the force of striking would produce a thin shiny layer of silver on the surface, which would quickly wear away. These &quot;silvered&quot; coins are not considered fourrées, since they are not actually plated since the metal is actually a continuous layer and these coins were not created to deceive.

==Modern examples==
Of modern coins, the clad US quarter dollar is an example of a coin which is not a fourrée, it is made of two layers of copper nickel, with copper sandwich in between and therefore is not a plated coin. The 1982 and later US one cent piece (Lincoln penny) is an example of a fourrée since it is zinc which has been plated with copper.

The Euro 1, 2 and 5-cent coins are copper-coated steel fourrées.

Fourrée is also spelt with and without the accent (é), with one or two r&#x27;s, and with one or two e&#x27;s. The Latin term for a silver-plated copper coin is &quot;subaeratus&quot; and the Greek name is &quot;hypochalkos&quot;, both meaning &quot;copper below&quot;.

<text>Below is the list of subcamps of Gross-Rosen concentration camp, a complex of Nazi concentration camps built and operated by Nazi Germany during World War II. The camps are arranged alphabetically by their Nazi German designation. For the list of present-day locations in alphabetical order, please use table-sort buttons.

The majority of prisoners came from occupied Poland (up to 90% in some subcamps) both Christian and Jewish (usually separated). Most, were put to work as slave labour in textile, armament, mining and defence construction industries. Other nationalities included Czechs, Slovaks, Roma, Belgians, Frenchmen, Russians, Yugoslavs, Hungarians and even ethnically German and Italian inmates. Thousands were brought in from Auschwitz after the selection to work for a network of German companies which ballooned in size during this period; with dozens of subcontractors. The inmates of &quot;Dyhernfurth&quot; for example, were utilized by almost thirty Nazi German startups.

<doc id="512535" wikidata="Q160268" url="?curid=512535" title="Gross-Rosen concentration camp">
<text>Gross-Rosen was a network of Nazi concentration camps built and operated by Nazi Germany during World War II. The main camp was located in the German village of Gross-Rosen, now the modern-day Rogoźnica in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Poland, directly on the rail-line between the towns of Jawor (Jauer) and Strzegom (Striegau). Its prisoners were mostly Jews, Poles and Soviet citizens.

At its peak activity in 1944, the Gross-Rosen complex had up to 100 subcamps located in eastern Germany and in German-occupied Czechoslovakia and Poland. The population of all Gross-Rosen camps at that time accounted for 11% of the total number of inmates incarcerated in the Nazi concentration camp system.

==The camp==

KZ Gross-Rosen was set up in the summer of 1940 as a satellite camp of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp from Oranienburg. Initially, the slave labour was carried out in a huge stone quarry owned by the &quot;SS-Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke GmbH&quot; (SS German Earth and Stone Works). In the fall of 1940 the use of labour in Upper Silesia was taken over by the new Organization Schmelt formed on the orders of Heinrich Himmler. It was named after its leader &quot;SS-Oberführer&quot; Albrecht Schmelt. The company was put in charge of employment from the camps with Jews intended to work for food only.

The Gross-Rosen location close to occupied Poland was of considerable advantage. Prisoners were put to work in the construction of a system of subcamps for expellees from the annexed territories. Gross Rosen became an independent camp on 1 May 1941. As the complex grew, the majority of inmates were put to work in the new Nazi enterprises attached to these subcamps.

In October 1941 the SS transferred about 3,000 Soviet POWs to Gross-Rosen for execution by shooting. Gross-Rosen was known for its brutal treatment of the so-called &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; prisoners vanishing without a trace from targeted communities. Most died in the granite quarry. The brutal treatment of the political and Jewish prisoners was not only in the hands of guards and German criminal prisoners brought in by the &quot;SS&quot;, but to a lesser extent also fuelled by the German administration of the stone quarry responsible for starvation rations and denial of medical help. In 1942, for political prisoners, the average survival time-span was less than two months.
Due to a change of policy in August 1942, prisoners were likely to survive longer because they were needed as slave workers in German war industries. Among the companies that benefited from the slave labour of the concentration camp inmates were German electronics manufacturers such as Blaupunkt, Siemens, as well as Krupp, IG Farben, and Daimler-Benz, among others. Some prisoners who were not able to work but not yet dying were sent to the Dachau concentration camp in so-called &quot;invalid&quot; transports.

The largest population of inmates, however, were Jews, initially from the Dachau and Sachsenhausen camps, and later from Buchenwald. During the camp&#x27;s existence, the Jewish inmate population came mainly from Poland and Hungary; others were from Belgium, France, Netherlands, Greece, Yugoslavia, Slovakia, and Italy.

Following the unsuccessful Polish Warsaw Uprising of 1944, the Germans deported 3,000 Poles from the Dulag 121 camp in Pruszków, where they were initially imprisoned, to Gross-Rosen. Those Poles were mainly people of 20 to 40 years of age.

===Subcamps===
At its peak activity in 1944, the Gross-Rosen complex had up to 100 subcamps, located in eastern Germany and German-occupied Czechoslovakia and Poland. In its final stage, the population of the Gross-Rosen camps accounted for 11% of the total inmates in Nazi concentration camps at that time. A total of 125,000 inmates of various nationalities passed through the complex during its existence, of whom an estimated 40,000 died on site, on death marches and in evacuation transports. The camp was liberated on 14 February 1945 by the Red Army. A total of over 500 female camp guards were trained and served in the Gross-Rosen complex. Female SS staffed the women&#x27;s subcamps of Brünnlitz, Graeben, Gruenberg, Gruschwitz Neusalz, Hundsfeld, Kratzau II, Oberaltstadt, Reichenbach, and Schlesiersee Schanzenbau.

The Gabersdorf labour camp had been part of a network of forced labor camps for Jewish prisoners that had operated under Organization Schmelt since 1941. The spinning mill where the female Jewish prisoners worked had been &quot;Aryanized&quot; in 1939 by a Vienna-based company called Vereinigte Textilwerke K. H. Barthel &amp; Co. The prisoners also worked in factories operated by the companies Aloys Haase and J. A. Kluge und Etrich. By 18 March 1944 Gabersdorf had become a subcamp of Gross-Rosen.

One subcamp of Gross-Rosen was the Brünnlitz labor camp, situated in the Czechoslovakian town of Brněnec, where Jews rescued by Oskar Schindler were interned.

The Brieg subcamp, located near the village of Pampitz, had originally been the location of a Jewish forced labor camp until August 1944, when the Jewish prisoners were replaced by the first transport of prisoners from the Gross-Rosen main camp. The camp was mostly staffed by soldiers from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and a few SS members. Most of the prisoners were Polish, with smaller numbers of Russian and Czech prisoners. Most of the Poles had been evacuated from the Pawiak prison in Warsaw; others had been arrested within the territory controlled by the Reich or had been transported from Kraków and Radom.

Brieg&#x27;s camp kitchen was run by Czech prisoners. The three daily meals included 1 pint of &quot;mehlzupa&quot; (a soup made from water and meal), 150 grams of bread, 1 quart of soup made with rutabaga, beets, cabbage, kale or sometimes nettles, 1 pint of black &quot;coffee&quot; and a spoonful of molasses. Sometimes &quot;hard workers&quot; called &quot;zulaga&quot; would be rewarded with a piece of blood sausage or raw horsemeat sausage, jam and margarine. Prisoners also received 1 cup of Knorr soup per week.

===Camp commandants===
During the Gross-Rosen initial period of operation as a formal subcamp of Sachsenhausen, the following two &quot;SS&quot; &quot;Lagerführer&quot; officers served as the camp commandants, the &quot;SS-Untersturmführer&quot; Anton Thumann, and &quot;SS-Untersturmführer&quot; Georg Güßregen. From May 1941 until liberation, the following officials served as commandants of a fully independent concentration camp at Gross-Rosen:
# &quot;SS-Obersturmbannführer&quot; Arthur Rödl, May 1941 – September 1942
# &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; Wilhelm Gideon, September 1942 – October 1943
# &quot;SS-Sturmbannführer&quot; Johannes Hassebroek, October 1943 until evacuation

==List of Gross-Rosen subcamps with locations==

The most far-reaching expansion of the Gross-Rosen system of labour camps took place in 1944 due to accelerated demand for support behind the advancing front. The character and purpose of new camps shifted toward defense infrastructure. In some cities, as in Wrocław (Breslau) camps were established in every other district. It is estimated that their total number reached 100 at that point according to list of their official destinations. The biggest sub-camps included &quot;AL Fünfteichen&quot; in Jelcz-Laskowice, four camps in Wrocław, &quot;Dyhernfurth&quot; in Brzeg Dolny, &quot;Landeshut&quot; in Kamienna Góra, and the entire Project Riese along the Owl Mountains.

==Post-war history==
After the war, the former camp was under control of the occupying Soviet forces until April 1947, when it was taken over by Polish administration. In 1953, a memorial to the victims designed by Adam Procki was unveiled.

===War crimes trial===
On 12 August 1948, the trial of three Gross Rosen camp officials, Johannes Hassebroek, Helmut Eschner and Eduard Drazdauskas, began before a Soviet Military Court. On 7 October 1948, all were found guilty of war crimes. Eschner and Drazdauskas were sentenced to life imprisonment and Hassebroek was sentenced to death, but this was later commuted also to life imprisonment.

===Museum===
From the 1950s to 1970s, the former camp was under the care of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum and the Historic Museum of Wrocław. In 1958, the first museum exhibition was created. In 1963, the site of the former camp was added to the Registry of Cultural Property of Poland. In 1976, it became a branch of the District Museum in Wałbrzych. The Gross-Rosen State Museum was opened in 1983, after efforts by survivors from Warsaw and Wrocław.

On 10 May 2002, a ceremony to commemorate 19 officers of the Special Operations Executive murdered by Nazi Germany at Gross-Rosen in 1944, was held at the museum, with the participation of the families of the victims, various Polish officials and war veterans, and ambassadors of the United Kingdom, Canada and France.

Since its creation, the museum has been most visited by Poles, followed by Germans, according to data up to 2013.

<doc id="512539" wikidata="Q267376" url="?curid=512539" title="World tree">
<text>The world tree is a motif present in several religions and mythologies, particularly Indo-European, Siberian, and Native American religions. The world tree is represented as a colossal tree which supports the heavens, thereby connecting the heavens, the terrestrial world, and, through its roots, the underworld. It may also be strongly connected to the motif of the tree of life, but it is the source of wisdom of the ages.

Specific world trees include &quot;Égig érő fa&quot; in Hungarian mythology, &quot;Ağaç Ana&quot; in Turkic mythology, &quot;Kenac&#x27; Car&quot; in Armenian mythology, &quot;Modun&quot; in Mongol mythology, &quot;Yggdrasil&quot; in Norse mythology, &quot;Irminsul&quot; in Germanic mythology, the oak in Slavic, Finnish and Baltic, &quot;Jianmu&quot; () in Chinese mythology, and in Hindu mythology the &quot;Ashvattha&quot; (a &quot;Ficus religiosa&quot;).

==General description==
=== Diffusion ===
Scholarship states that many Eurasian mythologies share the motif of the &quot;world tree&quot;, &quot;cosmic tree&quot;, or &quot;Eagle and Serpent Tree&quot;. More specifically, it shows up in &quot;Haitian, Finnish, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Norse, Siberian and northern Asian Shamanic folklore&quot;.

=== Tripartite division of the world ===
The World Tree is often identified with the &quot;Tree of Life&quot;, and also fulfills the role of an &quot;axis mundi&quot;, that is, a centre or axis of the world. It is also located at the center of the world and represents order and harmony of the cosmos. According to Loreta Senkute, each part of the tree corresponds to one of the three spheres of the world (treetops – heavens; trunk – middle world or earth; roots – underworld) and is also associated with a classical element (top part – fire; middle part – earth, soil, ground; bottom part – water).

Its branches are said to reach the skies and its roots to connect the human or earthly world with an underworld or subterranean realm. Because of this, the tree was worshipped as a mediator between Heavens and Earth. On the treetops are located the luminaries (stars) and heavenly bodies, along with an eagle&#x27;s nest; several species of birds perch among its branches; humans and animals of every kind live under its branches, and near the root is the dwelling place of snakes and every sort of reptiles.

=== Motifs ===
The imagery of the World Tree is sometimes associated with conferring immortality, either by a fruit that grows on it or by a springsource located nearby. As George Lechler also pointed out, in some descriptions this &quot;water of life&quot; may also flow from the roots of the tree.

==== Zoological imagery ====
According to Vladimir Toporov, animal species are commonly distributed along the parts of the tree: between its roots, figure &quot;chthonic animals&quot;, such as snakes and frogs, but he also mentions aquatic animals such as otters, beavers, and fishes, as well as dragons; the middle part of the tree is reserved for hoofed animals such as deer or elk (sometimes bees), and on the topmost part perches the &quot;principal&quot; bird, or a pair of birds sat on either side of the tree crown.

A bird perches atop its foliage, &quot;often ... a winged mythical creature&quot; that represents a heavenly realm. The eagle seems to be the most frequent bird, fulfilling the role of a creator or weather deity. Its antipode is a snake or serpentine creature that crawls between the tree roots, being a &quot;symbol of the underworld&quot;.

===Similar motifs===
The World Tree has also been compared to a World Pillar that appears in other traditions and functions as separator between the earth and the skies, upholding the latter. Another representation akin to the World Tree is a separate World Mountain. However, in some stories, the world tree is located atop the world mountain, in a combination of both motifs.

A conflict between a serpentine creature and a giant bird (an eagle) occurs in Eurasian mythologies: a hero kills the serpent that menaces a nest of little birds, and their mother repays the favor – a motif comparativist Julien d&#x27;Huy dates to the Paleolithic. A parallel story is attested in the traditions of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, where the thunderbird is slotted into the role of the giant bird whose nest is menaced by a &quot;snake-like water monster&quot;.

===Relation to shamanism===
Romanian historian of religion, Mircea Eliade, in his monumental work &quot;&quot;, suggested that the world tree was an important element in shamanistic worldview. Also, according to him, &quot;the giant bird ... hatches shamans in the branches of the World Tree&quot;. Likewise, Roald Knutsen indicates the presence of the motif in Altaic shamanism. Representations of the world tree are reported to be portrayed in drums used in Siberian shamanistic practices.

Some species of birds (eagle, raven, crane, loon, and lark) are revered as mediators between worlds and also connected to the imagery of the world tree. Another line of scholarship points to a &quot;recurring theme&quot; of the owl as the mediator to the upper realm, and its counterpart, the snake, as the mediator to the lower regions of the cosmos.

Researcher Kristen Pearson mentions Northern Eurasian and Central Asian traditions wherein the World Tree is also associated with the horse and with deer antlers (which might resemble tree branches).

===Possible origins===
Mircea Eliade proposed that the typical imagery of the world tree (bird at the top, snake at the root) &quot;is presumably of Oriental origin&quot;. Likewise, Roald Knutsen indicates a possible origin of the motif in Central Asia and later diffusion into other regions and cultures.

==In specific cultures==
===Indigenous American cultures===

* Among Indigenous Mesoamerican cultures, the concept of &quot;world trees&quot; is a prevalent motif in Mesoamerican cosmologies and iconography. The Temple of the Cross Complex at Palenque contains one of the most studied examples of the world tree in architectural motifs of all Mayan ruins. World trees embodied the four cardinal directions, which represented also the fourfold nature of a central world tree, a symbolic &quot;axis mundi&quot; connecting the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial world.
* Depictions of world trees, both in their directional and central aspects, are found in the art and traditions of cultures such as the Maya, Aztec, Izapan, Mixtec, Olmec, and others, dating to at least the Mid/Late Formative periods of Mesoamerican chronology. Among the Maya, the central world tree was conceived as, or represented by, a ceiba tree, called &quot;yax imix che&quot; (&#x27;blue-green tree of abundance&#x27;) by the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel. The trunk of the tree could also be represented by an upright caiman, whose skin evokes the tree&#x27;s spiny trunk. These depictions could also show birds perched atop the trees.
* A similarly named tree, &quot;yax cheel cab&quot; (&#x27;first tree of the world&#x27;), was reported by 17th-century priest Andrés de Avendaño to have been worshipped by the Itzá Maya. However, scholarship suggests that this worship derives from some form of cultural interaction between &quot;pre-Hispanic iconography and [millenary] practices&quot; and European traditions brought by the Hispanic colonization.
* Directional world trees are also associated with the four Yearbearers in Mesoamerican calendars, and the directional colors and deities. Mesoamerican codices which have this association outlined include the Dresden, Borgia and Fejérváry-Mayer codices. It is supposed that Mesoamerican sites and ceremonial centers frequently had actual trees planted at each of the four cardinal directions, representing the quadripartite concept.
* World trees are frequently depicted with birds in their branches, and their roots extending into earth or water (sometimes atop a &quot;water-monster&quot;, symbolic of the underworld).
* The central world tree has also been interpreted as a representation of the band of the Milky Way.
* Izapa Stela 5 contains a possible representation of a world tree.

A common theme in most indigenous cultures of the Americas is a concept of directionality (the horizontal and vertical planes), with the vertical dimension often being represented by a world tree. Some scholars have argued that the religious importance of the horizontal and vertical dimensions in many animist cultures may derive from the human body and the position it occupies in the world as it perceives the surrounding living world. Many Indigenous cultures of the Americas have similar cosmologies regarding the directionality and the world tree, however the type of tree representing the world tree depends on the surrounding environment. For many Indigenous American peoples located in more temperate regions for example, it is the spruce rather than the ceiba that is the world tree; however the idea of cosmic directions combined with a concept of a tree uniting the directional planes is similar.

===Greek mythology===
Like in many other Indo-European cultures, one tree species was considered the World Tree in some cosmogonical accounts.

====Oak tree====
The sacred tree of Zeus is the oak, and the one at Dodona (famous for the cultic worship of Zeus and the oak) was said by later tradition to have its roots furrow so deep as to reach the confines of Tartarus.

In a different cosmogonic account presented by Pherecydes of Syros, male deity &quot;Zas&quot; (identified as Zeus) marries female divinity &quot;Chthonie&quot; (associated with the earth and later called Gê/Gaia), and from their marriage sprouts an oak tree. This oak tree connects the heavens above and its roots grew into the Earth, to reach the depths of Tartarus. This oak tree is considered by scholarship to symbolize a cosmic tree, uniting three spheres: underworld, terrestrial and celestial.

====Other trees====
Besides the oak, several other sacred trees existed in Greek mythology. For instance, the olive, named Moriai, was the world tree and associated with the Olympian goddess Athena.

In a separate Greek myth the Hesperides live beneath an apple tree with golden apples that was given to the highest Olympian goddess Hera by the primal Mother goddess Gaia at Hera&#x27;s marriage to Zeus. The tree stands in the Garden of the Hesperides and is guarded by Ladon, a dragon. Heracles defeats Ladon and snatches the golden apples.

In the epic quest for the Golden Fleece of &quot;Argonautica&quot;, the object of the quest is found in the realm of Colchis, hanging on a tree guarded by a never-sleeping dragon (the Colchian dragon). In a version of the story provided by Pseudo-Apollodorus in &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, the Golden Fleece was affixed by King Aeetes to an oak tree in a grove dedicated to war god Ares. This information is repeated in Valerius Flaccus&#x27;s &quot;Argonautica&quot;. In the same passage of Valerius Flaccus&#x27; work, King Aeetes prays to Ares for a sign and suddenly a &quot;serpent gliding from the Caucasus mountains&quot; appears and coils around the grove as to protect it.

===Roman mythology===
In Roman mythology the world tree was the olive tree, that was associated with Pax. The Greek equivalent of &quot;Pax&quot; is Eirene, one of the Horae. The Sacred tree of the Roman Sky father Jupiter was the oak, the laurel was the Sacred tree of Apollo. The ancient fig-tree in the Comitium at Rome, was considered as a descendant of the very tree under which Romulus and Remus were found.

===Norse mythology===
In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is the world tree. Yggdrasil is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Yggdrasil is an immense ash tree that is central and considered very holy. The Æsir go to Yggdrasil daily to hold their courts. The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations: one to the well Urðarbrunnr in the heavens, one to the spring Hvergelmir, and another to the well Mímisbrunnr. Creatures live within Yggdrasil, including the harts Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraþrór, the giant in eagle-shape Hræsvelgr, the squirrel Ratatoskr and the wyrm Níðhöggr. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the etymology of the name &quot;Yggdrasil&quot;, the potential relation to the trees Mímameiðr and Læraðr, and the sacred tree at Uppsala.

===Circumbaltic mythology===

In Baltic, Slavic and Finnish mythology, the world tree is usually an oak. Most of the images of the world tree are preserved on ancient ornaments. Often on the Baltic and Slavic patterns there was an image of an inverted tree, &quot;growing with its roots up, and branches going into the ground&quot;.

====Baltic beliefs====
Scholarship recognizes that Baltic beliefs about a World Tree, located at the central part of the Earth, follow a tripartite division of the cosmos (underworld, earth, sky), each part corresponding to a part of the tree (root, trunk, branches).

It has been suggested that the word for &quot;tree&quot; in Baltic languages (Lithuanian &quot;medis&quot;; in Latvian &quot;tree&quot; is &quot;koks&quot;, but &quot;forest&quot; is &quot;mežs&quot;), both derived from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*medh-&quot; &#x27;middle&#x27;, operated a semantic shift from &quot;middle&quot; possibly due to the belief of the &quot;Arbor Mundi&quot;.

=====Lithuanian culture=====
The world tree () is widespread in Lithuanian folk painting, and is frequently found carved into household furniture such as cupboards, towel holders, and laundry beaters. According to Lithuanian scholars Prane Dunduliene and Norbertas Vėlius, the World Tree is &quot;a powerful tree with widespread branches and strong roots, reaching deep into the earth&quot;. The recurrent imagery is also present in Lithuanian myth: on the treetops, the luminaries and eagles, and further down, amidst its roots, the dwelling place of snakes and reptiles. The World Tree of Lithuanian tradition was sometimes identified as an oak or a maple tree.

=====Latvian culture=====
In Latvian mythology the world tree () was one of the most important beliefs, also associated with the birth of the world. Sometimes it was identified as an oak or a birch, or even replaced by a wooden pole. According to Ludvigs Adamovičs&#x27;s book on Latvian folk belief, ancient Latvian mythology attested the existence of a Sun Tree as an expression of the World Tree, often described as &quot;a birch tree with three leaves or forked branches where the Sun, the Moon, God, Laima, Auseklis (the morning star), or the daughter of the Sun rest[ed]&quot;.

====Slavic beliefs====

According to Slavic folklore, as reconstructed by Radoslav Katičić, the draconic or serpentine character furrows near a body of water, and the bird that lives on the treetop could be an eagle, a falcon or a nightingale.

Scholars Ivanov and Toporov offered a reconstructed Slavic variant of the Indo-European myth about a battle between a Thunder God and a snake-like adversary. In their proposed reconstruction, the Snake lives under the World Tree, sleeping on black wool. They surmise this snake on black wool is a reference to a cattle god, known in Slavic mythology as Veles.

Further studies show that the usual tree that appears in Slavic folklore is an oak: for instance, in Czech, it is known as &quot;Veledub&quot; (&#x27;The Great Oak&#x27;).

In addition, the world tree appears in the Island of Buyan, on top of a stone. Another description shows that legendary birds Sirin and Alkonost make their nests on separate sides of the tree.

Ukrainian scholarship points to the existence of the motif in &quot;archaic wintertime songs and carols&quot;: their texts attest a tree at the center of the world and two or three falcons or pigeons sat on its top, ready to dive in and fetch mud to create land (the &quot;Earth diver&quot; cosmogonic motif).

The imagery of the world tree also appears in folk medicine of the Don Cossacks.

====Finnic mythology====

According to scholar Aado Lintrop, Estonian mythology records two types of world tree in Estonian runic songs, with similar characteristics of being an oak and having a bird at the top, a snake at the roots and the stars amongst its branches.

===Judeo-Christian mythology===

The Tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the Tree of life are both components of the Garden of Eden story in the Book of Genesis in the Bible. According to Jewish mythology, in the Garden of Eden there is a tree of life or the &quot;tree of souls&quot; that blossoms and produces new souls, which fall into the Guf, the &quot;Treasury of Souls&quot;. The Angel Gabriel reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. Then Lailah, the Angel of Conception, watches over the embryo until it is born.

===Gnosticism===
According to the Gnostic codex On the Origin of the World, the tree of immortal life is in the north of paradise, which is outside the circuit of the Sun and Moon in the luxuriant Earth. Its height is so great it reaches Heaven. Its leaves are described as resembling cypress, the color of the tree is like the Sun, its fruit is like clusters of white grapes and its branches are beautiful. The tree will provide life for the innocent during the consummation of the age.

Mandaean scrolls often include abstract illustrations of world trees that represent the living, interconnected nature of the cosmos. In Mandaeism, the date palm (Mandaic: ) symbolizes the cosmic tree and is often associated with the cosmic wellspring (Mandaic: ). The date palm and wellspring are often mentioned together as heavenly symbols in Mandaean texts. The date palm takes on masculine symbolism, while the wellspring takes on feminine symbolism.

===Armenian mythology===
Armenian professor Hrach Martirosyan argues for the presence, in Armenian mythology, of a serpentine creature named &quot;Andndayin ōj&quot;, that lives in the (abyssal) waters that circundate the World Tree.

===Georgian mythology===
According to scholarship, Georgian mythology also attests a rivalry between mythical bird Paskunji, which lives in the underworld on the top of a tree, and a snake that menaces its nestlings.

=== Hittite culture ===
A similar imagery is attested in Hittite literature: a snake encircles the base of a tree, an eagle perches atop it, and a bee occupies its middle, which Craig Melchert considers to be a version of the &quot;world tree&quot; or &quot;tree of life&quot; motif.

=== Mesopotamian traditions ===
==== Sumerian culture ====
Professor Amar Annus states that, although the motif seems to originate much earlier, its first attestation in world culture occurred in Sumerian literature, with the tale of &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld&quot;. According to this tale, goddess Innana transplants the &quot;huluppu&quot; tree to her garden in the City of Uruk, for she intends to use its wood to carve a throne. However, a snake &quot;with no charm&quot;, a ghostly figure (Lilith or another character associated with darkness) and the legendary Anzû-bird make their residence on the tree, until Gilgamesh kills the serpent and the other residents escape.

==== Akkadian literature ====
In fragments of the story of Etana, there is a narrative sequence about a snake and an eagle that live on opposite sides of a poplar tree (&quot;şarbatu&quot;), the snake on its roots, the eagle on its foliage. At a certain point, both animals swear before deity Shamash and share their meat with each other, until the eagle&#x27;s hatchlings are born and the eagle decides to eat the snake&#x27;s young ones. In revenge, the snake alerts god Shamash, who agrees to let the snake punish the eagle for the perceived affront. Later, Shamash takes pity on the bird&#x27;s condition and sets hero Etana to release it from its punishment. Later versions of the story associate the eagle with mythical bird Anzû and the snake with a serpentine being named Bašmu.

===Iranian mythology===
A world tree is a common motif in Persian mythology, the legendary bird Simurgh (alternatively, &quot;Saēna bird&quot;; &quot;Sēnmurw&quot; and &quot;Senmurv&quot;) perches atop a tree in the center of the sea Vourukasa. This tree is described as having all-healing properties and many seeds. In another account, the tree is the very same &quot;tree of the White Hōm&quot; (Haōma). &quot;Gaokerena&quot; or white Haoma is a tree whose vivacity ensures continued life in the universe, and grants immortality to &quot;all who eat from it&quot;. In the Pahlavi Bundahishn, it is said that evil god Ahriman created a lizard to attack the tree.

&quot;Bas tokhmak&quot; is another remedial tree; it retains all herbal seeds and destroys sorrow.

===Hinduism and Indian religions===
Remnants are also evident in the Kalpavriksha (&quot;wish-fulfilling tree&quot;) and the Ashvattha tree of the Indian religions. The &quot;Ashvattha&quot; tree (&#x27;keeper of horses&#x27;) is described as a sacred fig and corresponds to &quot;the most typical representation of the world
tree in India&quot;, upon whose branches the celestial bodies rest. Likewise, the Kalpavriksha is also equated with a fig tree and said to possess wish-granting abilities.

Indologist David Dean Shulman provided the description of a similar imagery that appears in South Indian temples: the &quot;sthalavṛkṣa&quot; tree. The tree is depicted alongside a water source (river, temple tank, sea). The tree may also appear rooted on Earth or reaching the realm of Patala (a netherworld where the Nāga dwell), or in an inverted position, rooted in the Heavens. Like other accounts, this tree may also function as an &quot;axis mundi&quot;.

===North Asian and Siberian cultures===
The world tree is also represented in the mythologies and folklore of North Asia and Siberia. According to Mihály Hoppál, Hungarian scholar Vilmos Diószegi located some motifs related to the world tree in Siberian shamanism and other North Asian peoples. As per Diószegi&#x27;s research, the &quot;bird-peaked&quot; tree holds the sun and the moon, and the underworld is &quot;a land of snakes, lizards and frogs&quot;.

In the mythology of the Samoyeds, the world tree connects different realities (underworld, this world, upper world) together. In their mythology the world tree is also the symbol of Mother Earth who is said to give the Samoyed shaman his drum and also help him travel from one world to another. According to scholar Aado Lintrop, the larch is &quot;often regarded&quot; by Siberian peoples as the World Tree.

Scholar Aado Lintrop also noted the resemblance between an account of the World Tree from the Yakuts and a Moksha-Mordvinic folk song (described as a great birch).

The imagery of the world tree, its roots burrowing underground, its branches reaching upward, the luminaries in its branches is also present in the mythology of Finno-Ugric peoples from Northern Asia, such as the Khanty and the Mansi.

===Mongolic and Turkic folk beliefs===
The symbol of the world tree is also common in Tengrism, an ancient religion of Mongols and Turkic peoples. The world tree is sometimes a beech, a birch, or a poplar in epic works.

Scholarship points out the presence of the motif in Central Asian and North Eurasian epic tradition: a world tree named Bai-Terek in Altai and Kyrgyz epics; a &quot;sacred tree with nine branches&quot; in the Buryat epic.

====Turkic cultures====
=====&quot;Bai-Terek&quot;=====
The &quot;Bai-Terek&quot; (also known as &quot;bayterek&quot;, &quot;beyterek&quot;, &quot;beğterek&quot;, &quot;begterek&quot;, &quot;begtereg&quot;), found, for instance, in the Altai &quot;Maadai Kara&quot; epos, can be translated as &quot;Golden Poplar&quot;. Like the mythological description, each part of tree (top, trunk and root) corresponds to the three layers of reality: heavenly, earthly and underground. In one description, it is considered the &quot;axis mundi&quot;. It holds at the top &quot;a nest of a double-headed eagle that watches over the different parts of the world&quot; and, in the form of a snake, Erlik, deity of the underworld, tries to slither up the tree to steal an egg from the nest. In another, the tree holds two gold cuckoos at the topmost branches and two golden eagles just below. At the roots there are two dogs that guard the passage between the underworld and the world of the living.

=====&quot;Aal Luuk Mas&quot;=====

Among the Yakuts, the world tree (or sacred tree) is called &quot;Ál Lúk Mas&quot; (Aal Luuk Mas) and is attested in their &quot;Olonkho&quot; epic narratives. Furthermore, this sacred tree is described to &quot;connect the three worlds (Upper, Middle and Lower)&quot;, the branches to the sky and the roots to the underworld. Further studies show that this sacred tree also shows many alternate names and descriptions in different regional traditions. According to scholarship, the prevalent animal at the top of the tree in the Olonkho is the eagle.

Researcher Galina Popova emphasizes that the motif of the world tree offers a binary opposition between two different realms (the Upper Realm and the Underworld), and Aal Luuk Mas functions as a link between both. A spirit or goddess of the earth, named Aan Alahchin Hotun, is also said to inhabit or live in the trunk of Aal Luuk Mas.

=====Bashkir=====
According to scholarship, in the Bashkir epic &quot;Ural-batyr&quot;, deity Samrau is described as a celestial being married to female deities of the Sun and the Moon. He is also &quot;The King of the Birds&quot; and is opposed by the &quot;dark forces&quot; of the universe, which live in the underworld. A similarly named creature, the bird Samrigush, appears in Bashkir folktales living atop the tallest tree in the world and its enemy is a snake named Azhdakha. After the human hero kills the serpent Azhdakha, the grateful Samrigush agrees to carry him back to the world of light.

=====Kazakh=====
Scholarship points to the existence of a bird named Samurik (Samruk) that, according to Kazakh myth, lives atop the World Tree &quot;Baiterek&quot;. Likewise, in Kazakh folktales, it is also the hero&#x27;s carrier out of the underworld, after he defeats a dragon named Aydakhara or Aydarhana. In the same vein, Kazakh literary critic and folklorist described that the Samruk bird travels between the three spheres of the universe, nests atop the &quot;cosmic tree&quot; (bәyterek) and helps the hero out of the underworld.

=====Other representations=====
An early 20th-century report on Altaian shamanism by researcher Karunovskaia describes a shamanistic journey, information provided by one Kondratii Tanashev (or Merej Tanas). However, A. A. Znamenski believes this material is not universal to all Altaian peoples, but pertains to the specific worldview of Tanashev&#x27;s Tangdy clan. Regardless, the material showed a belief in a tripartite division of the world in sky (heavenly sphere), middle world and underworld; in the central part of the world, a mountain (&quot;Ak toson altaj sip&quot;&#x27;) is located. Upon this mountain there is &quot;a navel of the earth and water ... which also serves as the root of the &#x27;wonderful tree with golden branches and wide leaves&#x27; (&quot;Altyn byrly bai terek&quot;)&quot;. Like the iconic imagery, the tree branches out to reach the heavenly sphere.

====Mongolic cultures====
Finnish folklorist Uno Holmberg reported a tale from the Kalmuck people about a dragon that lies in the sea, at the foot of a Zambu tree. In the Buryat poems, near the root of the tree a snake named Abyrga dwells. He also reported a &quot;Central Asian&quot; narrative about the fight between the snake Abyrga and a bird named Garide – which he identified as a version of Indian Garuda.

===East Asia===
====Korea====
The world tree is visible in the designs of the Crown of Silla, Silla being one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. This link is used to establish a connection between Siberian peoples and those of Korea.

====China====
In Chinese mythology, a manifestation of the world tree is the &quot;Fusang&quot; or &quot;Fumu&quot; tree. In a Chinese cosmogonic myth, solar deity Xihe gives birth to ten suns. Each of the suns rests upon a tree named &quot;Fusang&quot; (possibly a mulberry tree). The ten suns alternate during the day, each carried by a crow (the &quot;Crow of the Sun&quot;): one sun stays on the top branch to wait its turn, while the other nine suns rest on the lower branches.

===Tanzania===
An origin myth is recorded from the Wapangwa tribe of Tanzania, wherein the world is created through &quot;a primordial tree and a termite mound&quot;. As a continuation of the same tale, the animals wanted to eat the fruits of this Tree of Life, but humans intended to defend it. This led to a war between animals and humans.

===Kenya===
In the agikuyu community, the &quot;mūgumo&quot; tree is held sacred and it is a taboo to even fetch firewood from it. In the past, the tree served as an altar to offer sacrifices as well as being a place of prayer. If a mùgumo tree falls, it is believed to be an end of an era for a &quot;god&quot;/dynasty and a ritual should be done by elders to cleanse the area and the community because it might be a bad omen.

== In folk and fairy tales ==
===ATU 301: The Three Stolen Princesses===
The imagery of the World Tree appears in a specific tale type of the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index, type ATU 301, &quot;The Three Stolen Princesses&quot;, and former subtypes AaTh 301A, &quot;Quest for a Vanished Princess&quot; (or &quot;Three Underground Kingdoms&quot;) and AaTh 301B, &quot;The Strong Man and His Companions&quot; (&quot;Jean de l&#x27;Ours&quot; and &quot;Fehérlófia&quot;). The hero journeys alone to the underworld (or a subterranean realm) to rescue three princesses. He leads them to a rope that will take them to the surface and, when the hero tries to climb up the rope, his companions cut it and the hero is stranded in the underworld. In his wanderings, he comes across a tree, on its top a nest of eggs from an eagle, a griffin or a mythical bird. The hero protects the nest from a snake enemy that slithers from the roots of the tree.

Serbian scholarship recalls a Serbian mythical story about three brothers, named Ноћило, Поноћило и Зорило (&quot;Noćilo, Ponoćilo and Zorilo&quot;) and their mission to rescue the king&#x27;s daughters. Zorilo goes down the cave, rescues three princesses and with a whip changes their palaces into apples. When Zorilo is ready to go up, his brothers abandon him in the cave, but he escapes with the help of a bird. Serbian scholar Pavle Sofric (sr), in his book about Serbian folkmyths about trees, noted that the tree of the tale, an ash tree (Serbian: јасен), showed a great parallel to the Nordic tree as not to be coincidental.

While comparing Balkanic variants of the tale type ATU 301, researcher Milena Benovska-Sabkova noticed that the conflict between the snake and the eagle (bird) on the tree &quot;was very close to the classical imagery of the World Tree&quot;.

===Other fairy tales===
According to scholarship, Hungarian scholar János Berze Nágy also associated the imagery of the World Tree with fairy tales wherein a mysterious thief comes at night to steal the golden apples of the king&#x27;s prized tree. This incident occurs as an alternative opening to tale type ATU 301, in a group of tales formerly classified as AaTh 301A, and as the opening episode in most variants of tale type ATU 550, &quot;Bird, Horse and Princess&quot; (otherwise known as &quot;The Golden Bird&quot;).

Likewise, historical linguist Václav Blažek argued for parallels of certain motifs of these fairy tales (the night watch of the heroes, the golden apples, the avian thief) to Ossetian Nart sagas and the Greek myth of the Garden of the Hesperides. The avian thief may also be a princess cursed into bird form, such as in Hungarian tale &quot;Prince Árgyilus (hu) and Fairy Ilona&quot; and in Serbian tale &quot;The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples&quot; (both classified as ATU 400, &quot;The Man on a Quest for the Lost Wife&quot;). This second type of opening episode was identified by Romanian folklorist Marcu Beza as another introduction to swan maiden tales.
