<text>The voiced uvular nasal is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a small capital version of the Latin letter n; the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

The uvular nasal is a rare sound cross-linguistically, occurring as a phoneme in only a small handful of languages. It is complex in terms of articulation, and also highly marked, as it is inherently difficult to produce a nasal articulation at the uvular point of contact. This difficulty can be said to account for the marked rarity of this sound among the world&#x27;s languages.

The uvular nasal most commonly occurs as a conditioned allophone of other sounds, for example as an allophone of before a uvular plosive as in Quechua, or as an allophone of /q/ before another nasal consonant as in Selkup. However, it has been reported to exist as an independent phoneme in a small number of languages. Examples include the Klallam language, Tagalog language, the Tawellemmet and Ayr varieties of Tuareg Berber, the Rangakha dialect of Khams Tibetan, at least two dialects of the Bai language, the Papuan language Mapos Buang, and the Chamdo languages: Lamo (Kyilwa dialect), Larong sMar (Tangre Chaya dialect), Drag-yab sMar (Razi dialect). In Mapos Buang and in the Bai dialects, it contrasts phonemically with a velar nasal. In the Chamdo languages it contrasts phonemically with /ŋ/, /ŋ̊/, and /ɴ̥/. The syllable-final nasal in Japanese was traditionally said to be realized as a uvular nasal when utterance-final, but empirical studies have disputed this claim.

There is also the pre-uvular nasal in some languages such as Yanyuwa, which is articulated slightly more front compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical uvular nasal, though not as front as the prototypical velar nasal. The International Phonetic Alphabet does not have a separate symbol for that sound, though it can be transcribed as (advanced ), or (both symbols denote a retracted ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are codice_2 and codice_3, respectively.

<text>The voiced uvular trill is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a small capital version of the Latin letter r. This consonant is one of several collectively called guttural R.

==Features==
Features of the voiced uvular trill:

 Unlike in tongue-tip trills, it is the uvula, not the tongue, that vibrates.


==Occurrence==
There are two main theories regarding the origination of the uvular trill in European languages. According to one theory, the uvular trill originated in Standard French around the 17th century and spread to the standard varieties of German, Danish, Portuguese, and some of those of Dutch, Norwegian and Swedish. It is also present in other areas of Europe, but it is not clear if such pronunciations are due to French influence. In most cases, varieties have shifted the sound to a voiced uvular fricative or a voiced uvular approximant .

The other main theory is that the uvular R originated within Germanic languages by the weakening of the alveolar R, which was replaced by an imitation of the alveolar R (vocalisation). Against the &quot;French origin&quot; theory, it is said that there are many signs that the uvular R existed in some German dialects long before the 17th century.

<text>The voiced velar approximant is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

The consonant is absent in English, but may be approximated by making but with the tongue body lowered or but with the lips apart. The voiced velar approximant can in many cases be considered the semivocalic counterpart of the close back unrounded vowel . and with the non-syllabic diacritic are used in different transcription systems to represent the same sound. 

In some languages, such as Spanish, the voiced velar approximant is an allophone of – see below.

The symbol for the velar approximant originates from , but with a vertical line. Compare and for the labio-palatal approximant.

==Features==
Features of the voiced velar approximant:

 The most common type of this approximant is &quot;glide&quot; or &quot;semivowel&quot;. The term &quot;glide&quot; emphasizes the characteristic of movement (or &#x27;glide&#x27;) of from the vowel position to a following vowel position. The term &quot;semivowel&quot; emphasizes that, although the sound is vocalic in nature, it is not &#x27;syllabic&#x27; (it does not form the nucleus of a syllable). For a description of the &quot;approximant consonant&quot; variant used e.g. in Spanish, see below.


== Occurrence ==
===Pre-velar===


== Voiced velar bunched approximant ==

Some languages have a velar approximant that is produced with the body of the tongue bunched up at the velum and simultaneous pharyngealization. This gives rise to a type of retroflex resonance resembling . The extension to the IPA recommends the use of the &quot;centralized&quot; diacritic combined with the IPA sign for the alveolar approximant (as in ) to distinguish the bunched realization from the prototypical apical , which may be specified as . Typically, the diacritic is omitted, so that the sound is transcribed simply with or (in broader transcriptions: ), as if it were a coronal consonant. Just as described below, the velar bunched approximant is not specified for rounding.

In Dutch, this type of &quot;r&quot; is called &#x27;Gooi &quot;r&quot;&#x27;. It is named after het Gooi, a region of the Netherlands where Hilversum (the main centre for television and radio broadcasting) is located.

===Features===
Features of the voiced velar bunched approximant:

 The body of the tongue is bunched up at the velum, rather than just approaching it as it is the case with the prototypical velar approximant.


===Occurrence===
== Relation with and ==
Some languages have a voiced velar approximant that is unspecified for rounding, and therefore cannot be considered the semivocalic equivalent of either or its rounded counterpart . Examples of such languages are Catalan, Galician and Spanish, in which the approximant &quot;consonant&quot; (not &quot;semivowel&quot;) unspecified for rounding appears as an allophone of .

Eugenio Martínez Celdrán describes the voiced velar approximant consonant as follows:

There is a parallel problem with transcribing the palatal approximant.

The symbol may not display properly in all browsers. In that case, should be substituted. In broader transcriptions, the lowering diacritic may be omitted altogether, so that the symbol is rendered , i.e. as if it represented the corresponding fricative.

==Voiced alveolar sibilant==


The voiced alveolar sibilant is common across European languages, but is relatively uncommon cross-linguistically compared to the voiceless variant. Only about 28% of the world&#x27;s languages contain a voiced dental or alveolar sibilant. Moreover, 85% of the languages with some form of are languages of Europe, Africa, or Western Asia.

===Features===
*There are at least three specific variants of :
** Dentalized laminal alveolar (commonly called &quot;dental&quot;), which means it is articulated with the tongue blade very close to the upper front teeth, with the tongue tip resting behind lower front teeth. The hissing effect in this variety of is very strong.
** Non-retracted alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;. According to about half of English speakers use a non-retracted apical articulation.
** Retracted alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue slightly behind the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;. Acoustically, it is close to or laminal .

==Voiced alveolar non-sibilant fricative==

The voiced alveolar non-sibilant fricative is a consonantal sound. As the International Phonetic Alphabet does not have separate symbols for the alveolar consonants (the same symbol is used for all coronal places of articulation that are not palatalized), it can represent the sound as in a number of ways including or (retracted or alveolarized , respectively), (constricted ), or (lowered ).

Few languages also have the voiced alveolar tapped fricative, which is simply a very brief apical alveolar non-sibilant fricative, with the tongue making the gesture for a tapped stop but not making full contact. It can be indicated in the IPA with the lowering diacritic to show that full occlusion does not occur. Flapped fricatives are theoretically possible but are not attested.

===Features===
 However, it does not have the grooved tongue and directed airflow, or the high frequencies, of a sibilant.


===Occurrence===
==Voiced lateral-median fricative==

The voiced alveolar non-sibilant fricative (also known as a &quot;lisp&quot; fricative) is a consonantal sound. Consonants is pronounced with simultaneous lateral and central airflow.

===Features===
 However, it does not have the grooved tongue and directed airflow, or the high frequencies, of a sibilant.

This letter is also often used to represent the bilabial approximant, though that is more precisely written with a lowering diacritic, that is . That sound may also be transcribed as an advanced labiodental approximant , in which case the diacritic is again frequently omitted, since no contrast is likely. It has been proposed that either a turned , reversed or affricate can be used as a dedicated symbol for the bilabial approximant, but despite occasional usage none of them have gained general acceptance. 

It is extremely rare for a language to make a phonemic contrast between the voiced bilabial fricative and the bilabial approximant. The Mapos Buang language of New Guinea contains this contrast. Its bilabial approximant is analyzed as filling a phonological gap in the labiovelar series of the consonant system rather than the bilabial series. Proto-Germanic and Proto-Italic are also reconstructed as having had this contrast, albeit with being an allophone for another consonant in both cases. In Bashkir language, it is an intervocal allophone of , and it is contrastive with : , .

The bilabial fricative is diachronically unstable (likely to be considerably varied between dialects of a language that makes use of it) and is likely to shift to .

The sound is not the primary realization of any sound in English dialects except for Chicano English, but it can be produced by approximating the normal English between the lips; it can also sometimes occur as an allophone of after bilabial consonants.

<text>The voiced dental fricative is a consonant sound used in some spoken languages. It is familiar to English-speakers as the &quot;th&quot; sound in &quot;father&quot;. Its symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet is eth, or and was taken from the Old English and Icelandic letter eth, which could stand for either a voiced or unvoiced (inter)dental non-sibilant fricative. Such fricatives are often called &quot;interdental&quot; because they are often produced with the tongue between the upper and lower teeth (as in Received Pronunciation), and not just against the back of the upper teeth, as they are with other dental consonants.

The letter is sometimes used to represent the dental approximant, a similar sound, which no language is known to contrast with a dental non-sibilant fricative. However, the approximant can be explicitly indicated with the lowering diacritic: . 
Very rarely used variant transcriptions of the dental approximant include (retracted ), (advanced ) and ( ). It has been proposed that either a turned ⟨⟩ or reversed ⟨⟩ be used as a dedicated symbol for the dental approximant, but despite occasional usage, this has not gained general acceptance.

The fricative and its unvoiced counterpart are rare phonemes. Almost all languages of Europe and Asia, such as German, lack the sound. Native speakers of languages without the sound often have difficulty enunciating or distinguishing it, and they replace it with a voiced alveolar sibilant , a voiced dental stop or voiced alveolar stop , or a voiced labiodental fricative ; known respectively as th-alveolarization, th-stopping, and th-fronting. As for Europe, there seems to be a great arc where the sound (and/or its unvoiced variant) is present. Most of Mainland Europe lacks the sound. However, some &quot;periphery&quot; languages such as Greek have the sound in their consonant inventories, as phonemes or allophones.

Within Turkic languages, Bashkir and Turkmen have both voiced and voiceless dental non-sibilant fricatives among their consonants. Among Semitic languages, they are used in Modern Standard Arabic, albeit not by all speakers of modern Arabic dialects, and in some dialects of Hebrew and Assyrian.

==Features==
Features of the voiced dental non-sibilant fricative:

 It does not have the grooved tongue and directed airflow, or the high frequencies, of a sibilant.


==Occurrence==
In the following transcriptions, the undertack diacritic may be used to indicate an approximant .
Danish is actually a velarized alveolar approximant.

<doc id="524870" wikidata="Q862576" url="?curid=524870" title="Voiced glottal fricative">
<text>The voiced glottal fricative, sometimes called breathy-voiced glottal transition, is a type of sound used in some spoken languages which patterns like a fricative or approximant consonant &quot;phonologically&quot;, but often lacks the usual &quot;phonetic&quot; characteristics of a consonant. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

In many languages, has no inherent place or manner of articulation. Thus, it has been described as a breathy-voiced counterpart of the following vowel from a phonetic point of view. However, its characteristics are also influenced by the &quot;preceding&quot; vowels and whatever other sounds surround it. Therefore, it can be described as a segment whose only consistent feature is its breathy voice phonation in such languages. It may have real glottal constriction in a number of languages (such as Finnish), making it a fricative.

Northern Wu languages such as Shanghainese contrast the voiced and voiceless glottal fricatives. The two glottal fricatives pattern like plosives.

==Features==
Features of the voiced glottal fricative:
* Its phonation is breathy voiced, or &quot;murmured&quot;, which means the vocal cords are loosely vibrating, with more air escaping than in a modally voiced sound. It is sometimes referred to as a &quot;voiced h&quot;. Strictly speaking this is incorrect, as there is no voicing.
* In some languages, it has the constricted manner of articulation of a fricative. However, in many if not most it is a transitional state of the glottis with no manner of articulation other than its phonation type. Because there is no other constriction to produce friction in the vocal tract, most phoneticians no longer consider to be a fricative. True fricatives may have a murmured phonation &quot;in addition&quot; to producing friction elsewhere. However, the term &quot;fricative&quot; is generally retained for the historical reasons.
* It may have a glottal place of articulation. However, it may have no fricative articulation, making the term glottal mean that it is articulated by the vocal folds, but this is the nature of its phonation rather than a separate articulation. All consonants except for the glottals, and all vowels, have an individual place of articulation in addition to the state of the glottis. As with all other consonants, surrounding vowels influence the pronunciation , and accordingly has only the place of articulation of these surrounding vowels.

<text>The voiced labiodental fricative is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

The sound is similar to voiced alveolar fricative /z/ in that it is familiar to most European speakers but is a fairly uncommon sound cross-linguistically, occurring in approximately 21.1% of languages. Moreover, most languages that have /z/ also have /v/ and similarly to /z/, the overwhelming majority of languages with [v] are languages of Europe, Africa, or Western Asia, although the similar labiodental approximant /ʋ/ is also common in India. The presence of and absence of , is a very distinctive areal feature of European languages and those of adjacent areas of Siberia and Central Asia. Speakers of East Asian languages that lack this sound may pronounce it as (Korean and Japanese), or / (Cantonese and Mandarin), and thus be unable to distinguish between a number of English minimal pairs.

In certain languages, such as Danish, Faroese, Icelandic or Norwegian the voiced labiodental fricative is in a free variation with the labiodental approximant.

<doc id="524872" wikidata="Q578601" url="?curid=524872" title="Voiced palatal fricative">
<text>The voiced palatal fricative is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) that represents this sound is (crossed-tail j), and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. It is the non-sibilant equivalent of the voiced alveolo-palatal sibilant.

In broad transcription, the symbol for the palatal approximant, , may be used for the sake of simplicity.

The voiced palatal fricative is a very rare sound, occurring in only 7 of the 317 languages surveyed by the original UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Database. In Dutch, Kabyle, Margi, Modern Greek, and Scottish Gaelic, the sound occurs phonemically, along with its voiceless counterpart, and in several more, the sound occurs as a result of phonological processes.

To produce this sound, the tip of the tongue is placed against the roof of the mouth behind the upper front teeth; then, while exhaling, the space between the tongue and the palate is narrowed, creating a friction-like sound similar to the sound (IPA: ) in the English word .

There is also the voiced post-palatal fricative in some languages, which is articulated slightly more back compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical voiced palatal fricative but not as back as the prototypical voiced velar fricative. The International Phonetic Alphabet does not have a separate symbol for that sound, but it can be transcribed as , (both symbols denote a retracted ), or (both symbols denote an advanced ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are codice_2 and codice_3, respectively.

Especially in broad transcription, the voiced post-palatal fricative may be transcribed as a palatalized voiced velar fricative ( in the IPA, codice_4 or codice_5 in X-SAMPA).

==Features==
Features of the voiced palatal fricative:
 The otherwise identical post-palatal variant is articulated slightly behind the hard palate, making it sound slightly closer to the velar .

<text>The voiced palatal plosive or stop is a type of consonantal sound in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a barred dotless that was initially created by turning the type for a lowercase letter . The equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

If the distinction is necessary, the voiced alveolo-palatal plosive may be transcribed , (both symbols denote an advanced ) or (retracted and palatalized ), but they are essentially equivalent since the contact includes both the blade and body (but not the tip) of the tongue. The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are codice_2 and codice_3 or codice_4, respectively. There is also a non-IPA letter ; (&quot;d&quot; with the curl found in the symbols for alveolo-palatal sibilant fricatives ) that is used especially in Sinological circles.

 is a less common sound worldwide than the voiced postalveolar affricate because it is difficult to get the tongue to touch just the hard palate without also touching the back part of the alveolar ridge. It is also common for the symbol to be used to represent a palatalized voiced velar plosive or palato-alveolar/alveolo-palatal affricates, as in Indic languages. That may be considered appropriate when the place of articulation needs to be specified, and the distinction between plosive and affricate is not contrastive.

There is also the voiced post-palatal plosive in some languages, which is articulated slightly more back than the place of articulation of the prototypical palatal consonant but not as back as the prototypical velar consonant. The IPA does not have a separate symbol, which can be transcribed as , (both symbols denote a retracted ), or (both symbols denote an advanced ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are codice_5 and codice_6, respectively.

Especially in broad transcription, the voiced post-palatal plosive may be transcribed as a palatalized voiced velar plosive ( in the IPA, codice_7 or codice_8 in X-SAMPA).

==Features==
Features of the voiced palatal stop:
 
** The otherwise identical post-palatal variant is articulated slightly behind the hard palate, making it sound closer to the velar .
** Alveolo-palatal variant is articulated also with the blade of the tongue at or behind the alveolar ridge.

<text>The voiced pharyngeal approximant or fricative is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. Epiglottals and epiglotto-pharyngeals are often mistakenly taken to be pharyngeal.

Although traditionally placed in the fricative row of the IPA chart, is usually an approximant. The IPA symbol itself is ambiguous, but no language is known to make a phonemic distinction between fricatives and approximants at this place of articulation.

The IPA letter is caseless. Capital and lower-case are pending at Unicode U+A7CE and U+A7CF.

==Features==
Features of the voiced pharyngeal approximant fricative:


==Occurrence==

Pharyngeal consonants are not widespread. Sometimes, a pharyngeal approximant develops from a uvular approximant. Many languages that have been described as having pharyngeal fricatives or approximants turn out on closer inspection to have epiglottal consonants instead. For example, the candidate sound in Arabic and standard Hebrew (not modern Hebrew – Israelis generally pronounce this as a glottal stop) has been variously described as a voiced epiglottal fricative , an epiglottal approximant , or a pharyngealized glottal stop .

<text>The voiced postalveolar or palato-alveolar fricative is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. The International Phonetic Association uses the term &quot;voiced postalveolar fricative&quot; only for the sound , but it also describes the voiced postalveolar non-sibilant fricative , for which there are significant perceptual differences, as one is a sibilant and one is not.

==Voiced palato-alveolar fricative==
The voiced palato-alveolar fricative or voiced domed postalveolar fricative is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages.

===Transcription===
The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is the lower case form of the letter Ezh (), and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. An alternative symbol used in some older and American linguistic literature is , a &quot;z&quot; with a caron. In some transcriptions of alphabets such as the Cyrillic, the sound is represented by the digraph . 
Although present in English, the sound is not represented by a specific letter or digraph, but is formed by yod-coalescence of and in words such as measure. It also appears in some loanwords, mainly from French (thus written with and ).

The sound occurs in many languages and, as in English and French, may have simultaneous lip rounding (), although this is rarely indicated in transcription.

===Features===
Features of the voiced palato-alveolar fricative:


===Occurrence===
The sound in Russian denoted by is commonly transcribed as a palato-alveolar fricative but is actually a laminal retroflex fricative.

==Voiced postalveolar non-sibilant fricative==

The voiced postalveolar non-sibilant fricative is a consonantal sound. As the International Phonetic Alphabet does not have separate symbols for the post-alveolar consonants (the same symbol is used for all coronal places of articulation that are not palatalized), this sound is usually transcribed (retracted constricted ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_2.

===Features===
 However, it does not have the grooved tongue and directed airflow, or the high frequencies, of a sibilant.
* Its place of articulation is postalveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge.

<doc id="524878" wikidata="Q1054276" url="?curid=524878" title="Voiced uvular fricative">
<text>The voiced uvular fricative is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , an inverted small uppercase letter , or in broad transcription if rhotic. This consonant is one of the several collectively called guttural R when found in European languages.

The voiced uvular approximant is also found interchangeably with the fricative, and may also be transcribed as . Because the IPA symbol stands for the uvular fricative, the approximant may be specified by adding the downtack: , though some writings use a superscript , which is not an official IPA practice.

For a voiced pre-uvular fricative (also called post-velar), see voiced velar fricative.

==Features==
Features of the voiced uvular fricative:

 In many languages it is closer to an approximant, however, and no language distinguishes the two at the uvular articulation. 


==Occurrence==

In Western Europe, a uvular trill pronunciation of rhotic consonants spread from northern French to several dialects and registers of Basque, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, German, Judaeo-Spanish, Norwegian, Occitan, Portuguese, Swedish, some variants of Low Saxon, and Yiddish. However, not all of them remain a uvular trill today.
In Brazilian Portuguese, it is usually a velar fricative (, ), voiceless uvular fricative , or glottal transition (, ), except in southern Brazil, where alveolar, velar and uvular trills as well as the voiced uvular fricative predominate. Because such uvular rhotics often do not contrast with alveolar ones, IPA transcriptions may often use to represent them for ease of typesetting. For more information, see guttural R.

 note, &quot;There is... a complication in the case of uvular fricatives in that the shape of the vocal tract may be such that the uvula vibrates.&quot;

It is also present in most Turkic languages, except for Turkish, and in Caucasian languages. It could also come in ɣ.

<text>The voiced uvular plosive or stop is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a small capital version of the Latin letter g, and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

 is a rare sound, even compared to other uvulars. Vaux proposes a phonological explanation: uvular consonants normally involve a neutral or a retracted tongue root, whereas voiced stops often involve an advanced tongue root: two articulations that cannot physically co-occur. This leads many languages of the world to have a voiced uvular fricative instead as the voiced counterpart of the voiceless uvular plosive. Examples are Inuit; several Turkic languages such as Uyghur; several Northwest Caucasian languages such as Abkhaz; as well as several Northeast Caucasian languages such as Ingush.

There is also the voiced pre-uvular plosive in some languages, which is articulated slightly more front compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical uvular plosive, though not as front as the prototypical velar plosive. The International Phonetic Alphabet does not have a separate symbol for that sound, though it can be transcribed as (advanced ), or (both symbols denote a retracted ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are codice_2 and codice_3, respectively.

<text>The voiced velar fricative is a type of consonantal sound that is used in various spoken languages. It is not found in most varieties of Modern English but existed in Old English. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a Latinized variant of the Greek letter gamma, , which has this sound in Modern Greek. It should not be confused with the graphically-similar , the IPA symbol for a close-mid back unrounded vowel, which some writings use for the voiced velar fricative.

The symbol is also sometimes used to represent the velar approximant, which, however, is more accurately written with the lowering diacritic: or . The IPA also provides a dedicated symbol for a velar approximant, .

There is also a voiced post-velar fricative, also called pre-uvular, in some languages. For the voiced pre-velar fricative, also called post-palatal, see voiced palatal fricative.

A voiced velar tapped fricative has been reported in Dàgáárè, which is a previously unattested sound in human language.

<text>The voiceless alveolo-palatal sibilant fricative is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages.

It is the sibilant equivalent of the voiceless palatal fricative, and as such it can be transcribed in IPA with .

==Features==
Features of the voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative:


== In English ==
In British Received Pronunciation, after syllable-initial (as in &quot;Tuesday&quot;) is realized as a devoiced palatal fricative. The amount of devoicing is variable, but the fully voiceless variant tends to be alveolo-palatal in the sequence: . It is a fricative, rather than a fricative element of an affricate because the preceding plosive remains alveolar, rather than becoming alveolo-palatal, as in Dutch.

The corresponding affricate can be written with or in narrow IPA, though is normally used in both cases. In the case of English, the sequence can be specified as as is normally apical (although somewhat palatalized in that sequence), whereas alveolo-palatal consonants are laminal by definition.

An increasing number of British speakers merge this sequence with the voiceless palato-alveolar affricate : (see yod-coalescence), mirroring Cockney, Australian English and New Zealand English. On the other hand, there is an opposite tendency in Canadian accents that have preserved , where the sequence tends to merge with the plain instead: (see yod-dropping), mirroring General American which does not allow to follow alveolar consonants in stressed syllables.

<text>The voiceless dental non-sibilant fricative is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. It is familiar to most English speakers as the &#x27;th&#x27; in &quot;think&quot;. Though rather rare as a phoneme among the world&#x27;s languages, it is encountered in some of the most widespread and influential ones. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. The IPA symbol is the lowercase Greek letter theta, which is used for this sound in post-classical Greek, and the sound is thus often referred to as &quot;theta&quot;.

The dental non-sibilant fricatives are often called &quot;interdental&quot; because they are often produced with the tongue between the upper and lower teeth, and not just against the back of the upper or lower teeth, as they are with other dental consonants.

This sound and its voiced counterpart are rare phonemes, occurring in 4% of languages in a phonological analysis of 2,155 languages. Among the more than 60 languages with over 10 million speakers, only English, northern varieties of the Berber languages of North Africa, Standard Peninsular Spanish, various dialects of Arabic, Swahili (in words derived from Arabic), and Greek have the voiceless dental non-sibilant fricative. Speakers of languages and dialects without the sound sometimes have difficulty producing or distinguishing it from similar sounds, especially if they have had no chance to acquire it in childhood, and typically replace it with a voiceless alveolar fricative () (as in Indonesian), voiceless dental stop (), or a voiceless labiodental fricative (); known respectively as th-alveolarization, th-stopping, and th-fronting.

The sound is known to have disappeared from a number of languages, e.g. from most of the Germanic languages or dialects, where it is retained only in Scots, English, and Icelandic, but it is alveolar in the last of these. Among non-Germanic Indo-European languages as a whole, the sound was also once much more widespread, but is today preserved in a few languages including the Brythonic languages, Peninsular Spanish, Galician, Venetian, Tuscan, Albanian, some Occitan dialects and Greek. It has likewise disappeared from many modern vernacular varieties of Arabic, like Egyptian Arabic. Classical Arabic (used in reciting the Quran) still retains the sound.

==Features==
Features of the voiceless dental non-sibilant fricative:

 It does not have the grooved tongue and directed airflow, or the high frequencies, of a sibilant.


==Occurrence==
==Voiceless denti-alveolar sibilant==
The voiceless denti-alveolar sibilant is the only sibilant fricative in some dialects of Andalusian Spanish. It has no official symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet, though its features would be transcribed or (using the , the diacritic marking a laminal consonant, and , the diacritic marking a dental consonant). It is usually represented by an ad-hoc symbol such as , , or (advanced diacritic).

 describes this sound as follows: &quot; is a voiceless, corono-dentoalveolar groove fricative, the so-called &quot;s coronal&quot; or &quot;s plana&quot; because of the relatively flat shape of the tongue body... To this writer, the coronal , heard throughout Andalusia, should be characterized by such terms as &quot;soft,&quot; &quot;fuzzy,&quot; or &quot;imprecise,&quot; which, as we shall see, brings it quite close to one variety of ... Canfield has referred, quite correctly, in our opinion, to this as &quot;the lisping coronal-dental,&quot; and Amado Alonso remarks how close it is to the post-dental , suggesting a combined symbol to represent it&quot;.

===Features===
Features of the voiceless denti-alveolar sibilant:
*Its place of articulation is denti-alveolar, which means it is articulated with a flat tongue against the alveolar ridge and upper teeth.
*It is normally laminal, which means it is pronounced with the blade of the tongue.

<text>The voiceless glottal fricative, sometimes called voiceless glottal transition or the aspirate, is a type of sound used in some spoken languages that patterns like a fricative or approximant consonant &quot;phonologically&quot;, but often lacks the usual &quot;phonetic&quot; characteristics of a consonant. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is . However, has been described as a voiceless phonation because in many languages, it lacks the place and manner of articulation of a prototypical consonant, as well as the height and backness of a prototypical vowel:

An effort undertaken at the Kiel Convention in 1989 attempted to move glottal fricatives, both voiceless and voiced, to approximants. The fricative may be represented with the extIPA diacritic for strong articulation, .

The Shanghainese language, among others, contrasts voiced and voiceless glottal fricatives.

==Features==
Features of the &quot;voiceless glottal fricative&quot;:

* In some languages, it has the constricted manner of articulation of a fricative. However, in many if not most it is a transitional state of the glottis or an approximant, with no manner of articulation other than its phonation type. Because there is no other constriction to produce friction in the vocal tract in the languages they are familiar with, many phoneticians no longer consider to be a fricative. However, the term &quot;fricative&quot; is generally retained for historical reasons.
* It may have a glottal place of articulation. However, it may have no fricative articulation, in which case the term &#x27;glottal&#x27; only refers to the nature of its phonation, and does not describe the location of the stricture nor the turbulence. All consonants except for the glottals, and all vowels, have an individual place of articulation in addition to the state of the glottis. As with all other consonants, surrounding vowels influence the pronunciation , and has sometimes been presented as a voiceless vowel, having the place of articulation of these surrounding vowels.

<text>The voiceless labial–velar fricative is a type of consonantal sound, used in spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is or occasionally . The letter was defined as a &quot;voiceless &quot; until 1979, when it was defined as a fricative with the place of articulation of the same way that is an approximant with the place of articulation of . The IPA &quot;Handbook&quot; describes as a &quot;fricative&quot; in the introduction (IPA 1999: ix) while a chapter within characterizes it as an &quot;approximate&quot; (IPA 1999: 136).

Some linguists posit voiceless approximants distinct from voiceless fricatives. To them, English is an approximant , a labialized glottal fricative , or an sequence, not a velar fricative. Scots has been described as a velar fricative, especially in older Scots, where it was . Other linguists believe that a &quot;voiceless approximant&quot; is a contradiction in terms, and so must be the same as . Ladefoged and Maddieson were unable to confirm that any language has fricatives produced at two places of articulation, like labial and velar. They conclude that &quot;if it is a fricative, it is better described as a voiceless labialized velar fricative&quot;.

<text>The voiceless palatal fricative is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. It is the non-sibilant equivalent of the voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative.

The symbol &quot;ç&quot; is the letter &quot;c&quot; with a cedilla (◌̧), as used to spell French and Portuguese words such as &quot;façade&quot; and &quot;ação&quot;. However, the sound represented by the symbol &quot;ç&quot; in French and Portuguese orthography is not a voiceless palatal fricative; the cedilla, instead, changes the usual , the voiceless velar plosive, when is employed before or , to , the voiceless alveolar fricative.

Palatal fricatives are relatively rare phonemes, and only 5% of the world&#x27;s languages have as a phoneme. The sound further occurs as an allophone of (e.g. in German or Greek), or, in other languages, of in the vicinity of front vowels.

There is also the voiceless post-palatal fricative in some languages, which is articulated slightly farther back compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical voiceless palatal fricative, though not as back as the prototypical voiceless velar fricative. The International Phonetic Alphabet does not have a separate symbol for that sound, though it can be transcribed as , (both symbols denote a retracted ) or (advanced ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are codice_2 and codice_3, respectively.

Especially in broad transcription, the voiceless post-palatal fricative may be transcribed as a palatalized voiceless velar fricative ( in the IPA, codice_4 or codice_5 in X-SAMPA).

==Features==

Features of the voiceless palatal fricative:

===Post-palatal===
=== Voiceless approximant ===

Some scholars also posit the voiceless palatal approximant distinct from the fricative, found in a few spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , the voiceless homologue of the voiced palatal approximant.

The palatal approximant can in many cases be considered the semivocalic equivalent of the voiceless variant of the close front unrounded vowel . The sound is essentially an Australian English (as in &quot;year&quot;) pronounced strictly without vibration of the vocal cords.

It is found as a phoneme in Jalapa Mazatec and Washo as well as in Kildin Sami.

<text>The voiceless palatal plosive or stop is a type of consonantal sound used in some vocal languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

== Voiceless palato-alveolar and post-palatal plosives ==
If distinction is necessary, the voiceless alveolo-palatal plosive may be transcribed as (advanced ) or (retracted and palatalized ), but these are essentially equivalent, because the contact includes both the blade and body (but not the tip) of the tongue. The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are codice_2 and codice_3 or codice_4, respectively. There is also a non-IPA letter ; (&quot;t&quot;, plus the curl found in the symbols for alveolo-palatal sibilant fricatives ), which is used especially in sinological circles.

It is common for the phonetic symbol to be used to represent voiceless postalveolar affricate or other similar affricates, for example in the Indic languages. This may be considered appropriate when the place of articulation needs to be specified and the distinction between plosive and affricate is not contrastive.

== Voiceless post-palatal plosive ==
There is also the voiceless post-palatal plosive in some languages, which is articulated slightly more back compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical palatal consonant, though not as back as the prototypical velar consonant. The International Phonetic Alphabet does not have a separate symbol for that sound, though it can be transcribed as (retracted ) or (advanced ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are codice_5 and codice_6, respectively.

Especially in broad transcription, the voiceless post-palatal plosive may be transcribed as a palatalized voiceless velar plosive ( in the IPA, codice_7 or codice_8 in X-SAMPA).

==Features==
Features of the voiceless palatal stop:
 
** The otherwise identical post-palatal variant is articulated slightly behind the hard palate, making it sound closer to the velar .
** Alveolo-palatal variant is articulated also with the blade of the tongue at or behind the alveolar ridge.

<text>The voiceless pharyngeal fricative is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is an h-bar, , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. In the transcription of Arabic, Berber (and other Afro-Asiatic languages) as well as a few other scripts, it is often written , .

Typically characterized as fricative in the upper pharynx, it is often characterized as a whispered .

==Features==
Features of the voiceless pharyngeal fricative:


==Occurrence==
This sound is the most commonly cited realization of the Semitic letter hēth, which occurs in all dialects of Arabic, Classical Syriac, Western Neo-Aramaic, Central Neo-Aramaic, Ge&#x27;ez, Tigre, Tigrinya as well as Biblical, Mishnaic and Mizrahi Hebrew. It has also been reconstructed as appearing in Ancient Egyptian, a related Afro-Asiatic language. Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Ashkenazi Hebrew and most speakers of Modern Hebrew have merged the voiceless pharyngeal fricative with the voiceless velar (or uvular) fricative. However, phonetic studies have shown that the so-called voiceless pharyngeal fricatives of Semitic languages are often neither pharyngeal (but rather epiglottal) nor fricatives (but rather approximants).

<text>A voiceless postalveolar fricative is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. The International Phonetic Association uses the term &quot;voiceless postalveolar fricative&quot; only for the sound , but it also describes the voiceless postalveolar non-sibilant fricative , for which there are significant perceptual differences.

==Voiceless palato-alveolar fricative==
A voiceless palato-alveolar fricative or voiceless domed postalveolar fricative is a type of consonantal sound used in many languages, including English. In English, it is usually spelled , as in &quot;ship&quot;.

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , the letter esh introduced by Isaac Pitman (not to be confused with the integral symbol ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

An alternative symbol is , an &quot;s&quot; with a caron or &quot;háček&quot;, which is used in the Americanist phonetic notation and the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet, as well as in the scientific and ISO 9 transliterations of Cyrillic. It originated with the Czech orthography of Jan Hus and was adopted in Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet and other Latin alphabets of Slavic languages. It also features in the orthographies of many Baltic, Finno-Samic, North American and African languages.

===Features===
Features of the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative:



===Occurrence===
In various languages, including English and French, it may have simultaneous labialization, i.e. , although this is usually not transcribed.

Classical Latin did not have , though it does occur in most Romance languages. For example, in French &quot;singer&quot; is pronounced . is descended from Latin , where was pronounced . The in Latin &quot;science&quot; was pronounced , but has shifted to in Italian .

Similarly, Proto-Germanic had neither nor , yet many of its descendants do. In most cases, this or descends from a Proto-Germanic . For instance, Proto-Germanic *skipą (&quot;hollow object, water-borne vessel larger than a boat&quot;) was pronounced . The English word &quot;ship&quot; has been pronounced without the the longest, the word being descended from Old English &quot;&quot; , which already also had the , though the Old English spelling etymologically indicated that the old had once been present.

This change took longer to catch on in West Germanic languages other than Old English, though it eventually did. The second West Germanic language to undergo this sound shift was Old High German. In fact, it has been argued that Old High German&#x27;s was actually already , because a single had already shifted to . Furthermore, by Middle High German, that had shifted to . After High German, the shift most likely then occurred in Low Saxon. After Low Saxon, Middle Dutch began the shift, but it stopped shifting once it reached , and has kept that pronunciation since. Then, most likely through influence from German and Low Saxon, North Frisian experienced the shift.

Then, Swedish quite swiftly underwent the shift, which resulted in the very uncommon phoneme, which, aside from Swedish, is only used in Colognian, a variety of High German, though not as a replacement for the standard High German but a coronalized . However, the exact realization of Swedish varies considerably among dialects; for instance, in Northern dialects it tends to be realized as . See sj-sound for more details. Finally, the last to undergo the shift was Norwegian, in which the result of the shift was .

The sound in Russian denoted by is commonly transcribed as a palato-alveolar fricative but is actually an apical retroflex fricative.

==Voiceless postalveolar non-sibilant fricative==

The voiceless postalveolar non-sibilant fricative is a consonantal sound. As the International Phonetic Alphabet does not have separate symbols for the post-alveolar consonants (the same symbol is used for all coronal places of articulation that are not palatalized), this sound is usually transcribed (retracted constricted voiceless ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_2.

Some scholars also posit the voiceless postalveolar approximant distinct from the fricative. The approximant may be represented in the IPA as .

===Features===
 However, it does not have the grooved tongue and directed airflow, or the high frequencies, of a sibilant.
*Its place of articulation is postalveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge.

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is which is a Latin letter s combined with a retroflex hook. Like all the retroflex consonants, the IPA letter is formed by adding a rightward-pointing hook to the bottom of (the letter used for the corresponding alveolar consonant). A distinction can be made between laminal, apical, and sub-apical articulations. Only one language, Toda, appears to have more than one voiceless retroflex sibilant, and it distinguishes subapical palatal from apical postalveolar retroflex sibilants; that is, both the tongue articulation and the place of contact on the roof of the mouth are different.

Some scholars also posit the voiceless retroflex approximant distinct from the fricative. The approximant may be represented in the IPA as .

<text>The voiceless retroflex plosive or stop is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. This consonant is found as a phoneme mostly (though not exclusively) in two areas: South Asia and Australia.

==Transcription==
The symbol that represents this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is . Like all the retroflex consonants, the IPA symbol is formed by adding a rightward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of &quot;t&quot; (the letter used for the equivalent alveolar consonant).

<doc id="524898" wikidata="Q849796" url="?curid=524898" title="Voiceless uvular fricative">
<text>The voiceless uvular fricative is a type of consonantal sound that is used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , the Greek chi. The sound is represented by (ex with underdot), or sometimes by (ex with caron), in Americanist phonetic notation. It is sometimes transcribed with (or , if rhotic) in broad transcription.

Most languages claimed to have a voiceless uvular fricative may actually have a voiceless uvular fricative trill (a simultaneous and ). Ladefoged &amp; Maddieson (1996) note that there is &quot;a complication in the case of uvular fricatives in that the shape of the vocal tract may be such that the uvula vibrates.&quot;

Although they are not normally differentiated in study, languages in which they have been (Hebrew, Wolof, as well as the northern and central varieties of European Spanish) have been found to specifically possess the fricative trill. It can be transcribed as (a devoiced and raised uvular trill) in IPA. It is found as either the fortis counterpart of (which itself is voiceless at least in Northern Standard Dutch: ) or the sole dorsal fricative in Northern SD and regional dialects and languages of the Netherlands (Dutch Low Saxon and West Frisian) spoken above the rivers Rhine, Meuse and Waal (sometimes termed the Rotterdam–Nijmegen Line). A plain fricative that is articulated slightly further front, as either medio-velar or post-palatal is typical of dialects spoken south of the rivers (mainly Brabantian and Limburgish but excluding Ripuarian and the dialect of Bergen op Zoom), including Belgian SD. In those dialects, the voiceless uvular fricative trill is one of the possible realizations of the phoneme . See Hard and soft G in Dutch for more details.

The frication in the fricative trill variant sometimes occurs at the middle or the back of the soft palate (termed &quot;velar&quot; or &quot;mediovelar&quot; and &quot;post-velar&quot;, respectively), rather than the uvula itself. This is the case in Northern Standard Dutch as well as some varieties of Arabic, Limburgish and Madrid Spanish. It may thus be appropriate to call those variants voiceless (post)velar-uvular fricative trill as the trill component is always uvular (velar trills are not physically possible). The corresponding IPA symbol is (a devoiced, raised and advanced uvular trill, where the &quot;advanced&quot; diacritic applies only to the fricative portion of the sound). Thus, in cases where a dialectal variation between voiceless uvular and velar fricatives is claimed the main difference between the two may be the trilling of the uvula as frication can be velar in both cases - compare Northern Dutch &quot;acht&quot; &#x27;eight&#x27; (with a postvelar-uvular fricative trill) with Southern Dutch or , which features a non-trilled fricative articulated at the middle or front of the soft palate.

For a voiceless pre-uvular fricative (also called post-velar), see voiceless velar fricative.

<text>The National (officially CBC News: The National) is a Canadian national television news program which serves as the flagship broadcast for the English-language news division of CBC News by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It reports on major Canadian and international news stories, airing on CBC Television stations nationwide Sunday to Friday at 10:00 p.m. local time (10:30 p.m. NT).

The program is also aired on CBC News Network; on weekdays, the initial version that airs live to Atlantic Canada on the main network is simulcast on CBC News Network at 9:00 p.m. ET, with several repeat broadcasts overnight. Until August 2005, &quot;The National&quot; was seen in the United States on the defunct Newsworld International channel; the program continues to be aired occasionally on C-SPAN when that network wants to provide coverage of a major Canadian news story, or a Canadian angle for a world or American event.

&quot;The National&quot; and other CBC newscasts, including CBC owned-and-operated stations&#x27; (O&amp;Os) early-evening local newscasts, are streamed on the CBC website; those residing outside of Canada may not be able to view some content. The show is also aired in Australia on SBS and made available on SBS ON Demand.

&quot;The National&quot;&#x27;s sister French-language newscast is &quot;Le Téléjournal&quot;, aired on the Radio-Canada TV network.

==Format==
&quot;The National&quot; used to run a news headlines segment for 20 to 25 minutes without commercial interruption. This format has been relaxed or reinstated at various points over the years. Subsequent segments would consist of documentaries or other feature reports, either in the form of a separate program (&quot;The Journal&quot; or &quot;The Magazine&quot;) or as additional segments of the main program.

The opening segment generally runs 15 to 20 minutes, followed by additional segments of varying length featuring additional stories, features, or panel discussions. Long-form documentaries or feature reports are not as common as they were prior to 2009, but are featured from time to time, particularly during the Friday and Sunday editions. The broadcast contains some live inserts but some of the broadcast&#x27;s segments are taped prior to the program&#x27;s airtime. Because of the length and the story count of the first two segments, the anchor concludes the first segment of the broadcast by saying &quot;We&#x27;re back in two.&quot; and the second segment of the broadcast by saying &quot;The National breaks down the stories shaping our world, next.&quot;. Since 2023, the news segment of the show has been followed by a segment called &quot;The Breakdown&quot;. The program concludes with a final segment called &quot;The Moment&quot;.

Peter Mansbridge, as chief correspondent for CBC News, was the regular weeknight anchor, normally hosting from Monday to Thursday, but may host other nights if a significant news event has occurred. Mansbridge also regularly anchored on Fridays until the late 2000s; although CBC primetime promos on Fridays in the early 2010s often indicated that Mansbridge was the regular anchor that night as well, by that point Wendy Mesley was usually substituting, and she has since become the permanent Friday anchor. Mesley had also been the Sunday anchor since September 2010, essentially a reprisal of her tenure as anchor of &quot;Sunday Report&quot; in the early 1990s, while Asha Tomlinson was the last regular Saturday anchor.

From October 2009 to September 2012, weekday (and, on some stations, Sunday) airings on CBC O&amp;Os ended at 10:55 with the anchor handing over to 10-minute local news bulletins that overlapped the normal 11:00 start time of the competing &quot;CTV National News&quot;. On CBC News Network, the weekday editions continued to run a full hour during this period; separate final segments, both pre-taped, were used for the 55- and 60-minute versions. Private affiliates, some of which had already been airing 11:00 p.m. local newscasts prior to the implementation of the 55-minute format, had the option of carrying either the 55- or 60-minute version. On September 17, 2012, with many CBC O&amp;Os extending late local news to 30 minutes, &quot;The National&quot; reverted to a single 60-minute format on weeknights and Sundays. (Those stations which continue to produce 10-minute late local newscasts now air them starting at 11:00, followed by a condensed 20-minute version of &quot;The Exchange&quot; before rejoining the network schedule at 11:30.)

From 2009 to 2017, a 30-minute Saturday edition of &quot;The National&quot; (essentially a rebranding of the long-standing &quot;Saturday Report&quot;) generally aired on CBC Television at 6:00 p.m. ET during the season of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; (or if other live CBC Sports broadcasts are scheduled for that evening), and 6:00 local (7:00 AT, 7:30 NT) otherwise, with updated editions throughout the evening on CBC News Network. However, beginning in the early 2010s, most CBC stations in eastern Canada began to carry local newscasts in that timeslot instead, or used a local opt-out at 6:20 ET. Just before the fall 2017 relaunch, the Saturday edition was discontinued altogether in favour of additional segments of CBC News Network&#x27;s rolling coverage, with the 6:00pm ET segment, simulcast on CBC Television in western Canada, serving as the CBC&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; network TV newscast of record on Saturdays.

==History==
&quot;The National&quot; began as &quot;The National News&quot; in 1954. Since 1952, there had been a five-minute national news bulletin on the fledgling CBC Television service - each bulletin would be read by a different reader, which the CBC&#x27;s management realised resulted in a disjoined broadcast. Program director Mavor Moore decided to choose a single newsreader for the program in order to create continuity. He hired veteran radio newsman Larry Henderson to anchor the broadcast which soon expanded to a nightly thirteen-minute program airing at 11 pm. Henderson, who had hoped to become Canada&#x27;s answer to Edward R. Murrow, had spent several years travelling the world with his &quot;Headliners&quot; radio broadcast. He proved a temperamental newsreader who would occasionally swear on the air, respond in anger to cues to speed up his reading, and once walked off the set when a filmed segment was not ready on cue.

Henderson left the broadcast in 1959 and was succeeded by Earl Cameron, who had been presenter of the &quot;National News Bulletin&quot; on the CBC&#x27;s main radio service, the Trans-Canada Network, since 1944. Changes in the philosophy of CBC News led to Cameron, a professional announcer rather than a journalist, being replaced by journalist Stanley Burke, in 1966.

Though journalists were now reading the news, union regulations required a journalist acting as news anchor to leave the journalists&#x27; union and join the announcers&#x27; union and thus prohibited the anchor from doing anything other than reading a script written by others. Burke anchored the show from 1966 until 1969 when he resigned in order to launch a public campaign on the Biafran civil war. Burke was replaced by Warren Davis, at which point the show was renamed &quot;The National&quot; and the program was broadcast in colour. From 1970, the program was anchored by Lloyd Robertson until he was hired away by the CTV Television Network, the CBC&#x27;s rival, in 1976, largely as a result of Robertson&#x27;s frustration at not being able to participate in the writing of the newscast due to union rules.

Peter Kent hosted the show for two years and, because he had worked as a senior correspondent with &quot;CBC News Magazine&quot; and &quot;The National&quot;, he was allowed to report and write and anchor &quot;The National&quot; and CBC News Specials before leaving to return to work as a foreign correspondent. In 1978, Knowlton Nash—who had been director of news and current affairs, three management levels above being Kent&#x27;s supervisor—became the newscast&#x27;s new anchor, after winning an audition process whose result was upheld in arbitration. Inaccurate news reports had claimed Nash appointed himself to the role. During Nash&#x27;s tenure, the CBC was able to win formal concessions from its unions allowing working journalists to read the news, allowing Nash to assume the title of &quot;Chief Correspondent&quot; for CBC News. This allowed him to participate in the writing of the show&#x27;s script as well as act as a news editor with influence over the stories selected for the newscast and other questions of editorial judgment. Nash stepped down as chief anchor in 1988 and was replaced by Peter Mansbridge.

On January 11, 1982, &quot;The National&quot; was relaunched in the 10:00 p.m. timeslot with a modernized design and format. &quot;The Journal&quot;, a program that covered news stories in greater depth using interviews and documentaries, followed it at 10:22 p.m.

One of the hosts of &quot;The Journal&quot; from the beginning was Barbara Frum, who quickly became a symbol of CBC News as she was not afraid to tackle the toughest and most controversial of issues. Frum died of chronic leukemia on March 26, 1992. Her final interview was with Canadian author Mordecai Richler, which took place just days before her death.

That same year, the CBC, which was undergoing major changes, replaced &quot;The National&quot; and &quot;The Journal&quot; with &quot;Prime Time News&quot;, an integrated package which aired at 9:00 p.m. with two hosts, Mansbridge and Pamela Wallin. However, the show fared poorly in the ratings, resulting in the competing &quot;CTV National News&quot; overtaking the CBC in national news ratings for the first time in its history, and returned to the 10 p.m. time slot in 1994. During this time, the title &quot;The National&quot; was retained by a separate newscast on CBC Newsworld, hosted by Alison Smith.

In 1995, the main-network program reverted to the name &quot;The National&quot;, hosted by Mansbridge, and was followed by &quot;The National Magazine&quot;, hosted by Hana Gartner. Brian Stewart later took the helm of the second program, which was retitled &quot;The Magazine&quot;. It continued as a pseudo-separate program until the start of the federal election campaign of fall 2000, when the second half-hour was turned over to additional election coverage hosted by Mansbridge, under the moniker &quot;Behind the Ballot&quot;. However, &quot;The Magazine&quot; did not return after the election, and Mansbridge continued to anchor the full hour. In early 2001, this integrated format was introduced as part of a revamp of the program; for a time, the latter part of the hour was often titled &quot;Documentary&quot;, on nights when such were featured; on other occasions, feature reports and/or panel discussions would be featured instead. The program acquired a new look and format in the eventful fall of that year with the CBC&#x27;s latest corporate redesign.

Beginning in the late 1990s, in an effort to provide an 11:00 p.m. alternative to the now-dominant &quot;CTV National News&quot;, the CBC&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations would repeat the news headline portion of &quot;The National&quot; at 11:00 p.m., followed (until summer 2000) by a half-hour local newscast at 11:30. This practice ended in October 2006, when &quot;The Hour&quot; began airing in that timeslot. Most private affiliates of the CBC did not broadcast the 11 p.m. airing.

&quot;The National Online&quot; debuted on the web on March 21, 1996. The interactive website initially made &quot;available both information about the program and more in-depth content to supplement what we broadcast on television.&quot; Later that year the website added news &quot;headlines and very short summaries that got updated about once a day - but that&#x27;s how online news got started at CBC.&quot;

On January 9, 2006, &quot;The National&quot; adopted a new look as part of a major rebranding for CBC News, stemming mainly from an extensive study by the CBC into how to make news programming more relevant, particularly in the face of stiff competition from &quot;CTV National News&quot; and &quot;Global National&quot;. The rebranding had been scheduled for September 2005 but was postponed because of the lengthy lockout that had just concluded at that time. The primary colour of CBC News shifted from blue to red, not unlike BBC News.

The CBC in summer 2006 briefly and controversially aired &quot;The National&quot; at 11 p.m. on Tuesday nights in the Eastern Time Zone, in order to simulcast the American airing of &quot;The One: Making a Music Star&quot;. &quot;The One&quot; received very low ratings on both ABC and CBC, and after two weeks &quot;The National&quot; returned to airing at 10 p.m. five nights a week as of July 31, 2006.

In May 2007, &quot;The National&quot; launched a redesigned website featuring the latest broadcast, recent documentaries, and an extensive online archive that opens the floor for comments from the viewers. There is also a behind-the-scenes blog and video bios on many of the reporters.

In December 2008, it was announced that as part of a larger series of planned changes surrounding CBC News, &quot;Saturday Report&quot; and &quot;Sunday Night&quot; were to be replaced by weekend editions of &quot;The National&quot; in 2009, citing that &quot;The National&quot; had better brand awareness than other CBC News properties. These changes took effect in September 2009; as with its predecessor, a half-hour version of the Saturday-night edition was still scheduled at 6 p.m. ET during the NHL season as a lead-in to &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;″s pre-game show.

=== 2017–present: Mansbridge&#x27;s retirement, relaunch ===

In September 2016, Mansbridge announced that he would retire as anchor of the program in 2017, following the network&#x27;s Canada Day broadcast. On the future of the program following his departure, CBC News editor-in-chief Jennifer McGuire told the Canadian Press that the CBC were planning to perform a significant revamp of &quot;The National&quot; in October 2017.

On August 1, 2017, the CBC announced that Adrienne Arsenault, Rosemary Barton, Andrew Chang, and Ian Hanomansing would host a revamped version of &quot;The National&quot; beginning on November 6, 2017. The four anchors hosted from different cities, with Arsenault and Hanomansing initially hosting primarily from Toronto, Barton from Ottawa, and Chang from Vancouver, although the anchors were able to host on-location as warranted by stories. Master control and playout comes from the CBC studios in Ottawa, the national capital. During the series run the anchor duty stations shifted, with Hanomansing principally hosting from Vancouver and Chang from Toronto.

CBC News executive Jonathan Whitten stated that the new format will be designed to focus more upon in-depth and &quot;personal&quot; coverage of ongoing stories, rather than merely recapping all of the day&#x27;s headlines. Whitten explained that &quot;increasingly the audience is going to demand more at the end of the day. Some may think we&#x27;re jumping too fast into a world where we&#x27;re abandoning that six or seven, two-minute news item [model], but we think that&#x27;s what the positioning for the future&#x27;s about.&quot; There will also be a focus on expanding the presence of &quot;The National&quot; as an overarching brand for original journalism across the CBC&#x27;s television and digital platforms, rather than referring solely to the TV program (to emphasize this perspective, CBC staff have also referred to the program internally as &quot;The National Tonight&quot; rather than just &quot;The National&quot;).

The inaugural episode with the new format received mixed to negative reviews; John Doyle wrote in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that the show was no longer a newscast, but a &quot;chatty, visually bewildering assessment of some news stories of the day&quot; that felt &quot;disjointed, surreal and sadly lacking in coherence&quot;. Although acknowledging that its hosts were &quot;superb&quot; journalists, he argued that its opening story on the Sutherland Springs church shooting featured &quot;a reporter, skilled at doing traditional TV reportage, suddenly doing deep feelings and expected to be personally raw. That, with respect, is what the &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; show is for – exposed feelings and some kind of half-baked social context.&quot; Johanna Schneller wrote for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that the new format was likely an admission by the CBC that &quot;you know the news, but we&#x27;re the experts. Not the stentorian experts-on-high the way we used to be; we&#x27;re chatty experts. Your four friends who always make you go, &#x27;Huh.&#x27;&quot;

On January 22, 2020, CBC News announced revisions to the program, dropping the four-anchor format and having Arsenault and Chang co-anchor from Monday through Thursday. Ian Hanomansing serves as solo anchor for the Friday and Sunday editions. Barton became the chief political correspondent for CBC News and the host of the Sunday morning political talk show &quot;Rosemary Barton Live&quot;; she continues to host &quot;The National&quot;&#x27;s weekly &quot;At Issue&quot; political panel.

In 2022, the CBC announced further changes. Arsenault will now serve as sole weekday anchor, with Hanomansing continuing to anchor on Friday and Sunday while Chang moves to a new daily program for the CBC&#x27;s forthcoming streaming news service.

==Presentation==

The show&#x27;s name was shortened to &quot;The National&quot; in 1969. The broadcast&#x27;s original opening, used from 1969 through 1982, was known as &quot;the Bloops&quot; and featured the title of the program in a &quot;space-age&quot; font in green on the bottom of the screen, superimposed over a wide shot of the set. Sometimes the program title appeared in the centre of the screen, with a black background. Accompanied by synthesized beeps that resembled an old computer, different letters rapidly cycled from left to right until they spelled &quot;The National&quot;.

An announcer, usually Allan McFee, would intone &quot;The National, with &lt;anchorperson&gt;&quot;, followed by a cut to a shot of the anchor beside a screen. The anchor of the program would then summarize the top stories as different slides appeared for each of them on the screen.

An internal study was conducted in July 1979 on whether to move &quot;The National&quot; to the 10 p.m. slot. This study group was composed of Bill Morgan, Mark Starowicz, and Vince Carlin.

On January 11, 1982, the CBC relaunched &quot;The National&quot; with a radically different format and presentation style that looked very hi-tech for its time. The intro started with a map of the world superimposed on a cube which began to rotate, splitting into smaller cubes as it did. The final rotation revealed the title of the show in shiny chrome lettering using the font Stop. The synthesized opening music featured a fanfare played by The Canadian Brass, called &quot;The National&quot;.

During the mid-1980s, Quantel &quot;Paintbox&quot; was used to create many of the graphics for the stories.

On July 31, 1989, the CBC updated the presentation of &quot;The National&quot; with more modern computer graphics, similar to those used on CBC Newsworld at the same time. The logo used all upper-case letters in the typeface Times New Roman.

After Barbara Frum&#x27;s death in 1992, &quot;The Journal&quot;—which she hosted—was subsequently cancelled later that year and replaced with &quot;CBC Prime Time News&quot;; the name &quot;The National&quot; was retained on CBC Newsworld for its late evening news bulletin.

From 1995 to 1997, the logo used the font Palatino in upper-case for the words &quot;The National&quot;, and Frutiger in upper-case for the words &quot;CBC News&quot; underneath.

A new opening and look for the show appeared in 1997 that retained the style of the 1995 opening but used somewhat more sophisticated and modern computer animation.

In 2001, a logo was introduced that used the typeface Microgramma, centred on two lines, with the CBC News logo underneath in Frutiger. It was short-lived, lasting only a few months.

In the fall of 2001, the presentation of &quot;The National&quot; was updated along with the corporate redesign of the entire network to have one consistent branding. The New York design firm Razorfish designed the look of this and other network programs. The logo used the typeface Frutiger in upper case.

In late 2004 or early 2005, several graphics were modified, featuring more blue, less beige, and a slightly modified logo (with bolder type for &quot;The National&quot;). These changes were only implemented in selected sequences, sometimes leading to confusion - i.e., the older set of graphics was used at the start of the newscast&#x27;s opening, and the new set was used at the end of the open.

The opening sequence started with the CBC News ID which flowed into the main graphic sequence, followed by Mansbridge or the fill-in anchor saying &quot;Tonight ...&quot; followed by a verbal listing of the main headlines and accompanying video and graphics. The title sequence would then continue, and cut to an aerial view of Toronto (new shot every Monday which then ran the entire week) and Lisa Dalbello announcing up and under the theme saying &quot;&quot;The National&quot;; from the Canadian Broadcasting Centre, here is Peter Mansbridge.&quot;

In early 2006, the entire news division - including &quot;The National&quot; and CBC Newsworld - received another update, including a new theme song and new title sequences, featuring the colours red, black, and white. From 2008 to the 2009 rebranding, Tony Daniels introduced the show and the host.

After more than two years in the making, &quot;The National&quot; underwent sweeping changes on October 26, 2009. Host Peter Mansbridge began delivering all segments of the news standing up, a style pioneered in Canada by the Citytv system. The set was redesigned and the colour blue was mixed into the previous channel&#x27;s colours of red and white. A press release had stated that the 2006 theme music would remain intact; however, new music cues by Eggplant Collective were created. Most of the logos and graphic fonts were changed to use Christian Schwartz&#x27;s Stag typeface.

In 2016, the program received a new opening sequence featuring a sweeping pan of the program title followed by a flash. The lower-thirds and other graphical elements were also updated.

The regular panellists are columnists Andrew Coyne, Chantal Hébert, and Althia Raj from the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, and &quot;Toronto Star&quot; respectively, who are occasionally joined by one or more guest panellists.

<text>Cedric Antonio Kyles (born April 24, 1964), better known by his stage name Cedric the Entertainer, is an American stand-up comedian, actor and television host. He hosted BET&#x27;s &quot;ComicView&quot; during the 1993–1994 season and &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot; in 1995. He is best known for co-starring with Steve Harvey on The WB sitcom &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;, as one of &quot;The Original Kings of Comedy&quot;, and for starring as Eddie Walker in &quot;Barbershop&quot;. He hosted the 12th season of the daytime version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; in 2013–14 and starred in the TV Land original series &quot;The Soul Man&quot;, which aired from 2012 to 2016. He has also done voice work for &quot;Ice Age&quot;, the &quot;Madagascar&quot; film series, &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;, &quot;Planes&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He currently stars on the CBS sitcom &quot;The Neighborhood&quot;. In 2019, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Cedric was born on April 24, 1964, in Jefferson City, Missouri, the son of Rosetta (née Boyce), a schoolteacher, and Kittrell Kyles, an employee of The Missouri Pacific Railroad. He has a younger sister, Sharita Kyles Wilson, a communications professor at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California.

Cedric was raised in Caruthersville, Missouri, but after junior high school he moved to Berkeley, Missouri, a northern suburb of St. Louis. He is a graduate of Berkeley High School.

Cedric majored in mass communication at Southeast Missouri State University and worked as a State Farm insurance claims adjuster and substitute high school teacher before becoming a full-time comedian. He is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi.

==Career==
Cedric&#x27;s stage name came about when he felt that his real name, Cedric Kyles, sounded too formal. Inspired by an entertainer named Kodak, he came up with the name &quot;Cheerio&quot;, but received a cease and desist letter from General Mills over their cereal Cheerios. He settled on his stage name when someone introduced him as &quot;an entertainer, Cedric the entertainer&quot; and the name stuck.

In 1995, Cedric moved into acting, auditioning for and receiving his first-ever role as The Cowardly Lion in the 1995 Apollo Theater Revival of &quot;The Wiz&quot;. He expanded his career by playing Steve Harvey&#x27;s friend Cedric Jackie Robinson on &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;.

He began appearing in films, including &quot;Barbershop&quot;, &quot;Barbershop 2: Back in Business&quot;, &quot;Ride&quot;, &quot;Serving Sara&quot;, &quot;Johnson Family Vacation&quot;, &quot;Code Name: The Cleaner&quot;, &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot;, &quot;Man of the House&quot;, &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, &quot;Madagascar, , Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; and &quot;Be Cool&quot;. He was the subject of controversy when his &quot;Barbershop&quot; character made unpopular remarks about Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. These comments were spoken in character, as part of the script; he has never apologized for them. In &quot;Madagascar&quot;, he voiced Maurice the aye aye. In October 2005, he joined the Champ Car auto racing series as a part owner. He appeared in the film &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; as the voice of Golly the gander.

While his acting career grew, Cedric continued to perform stand-up comedy and traveled the country as one of the &quot;Kings of Comedy&quot; headliners with Steve Harvey, D. L. Hughley and Bernie Mac. The act was later made into a Spike Lee film, &quot;The Original Kings of Comedy&quot;. Cedric had his own sketch comedy show, &quot;Cedric the Entertainer Presents&quot;, but after being renewed for a second season, it was canceled by Fox before the season began. He took time to write a book, &quot;Grown-A$$ Man.&quot; He appeared in the 2003 video game &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004&quot;. A more recent HBO Comedy Special was &quot;Cedric The Entertainer: Taking You Higher&quot;. He recorded comedic interludes on two Nelly albums, &quot;Country Grammar&quot; (2000) and &quot;Nellyville&quot; (2002) as well as on Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;The Black Album&quot; (2003).

In the 2007 comedy film &quot;Code Name: The Cleaner&quot;, Cedric plays Jake, a janitor with amnesia who may be a secret undercover government agent involved in an illegal arms conspiracy. He starred in the 2008 films &quot;Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins&quot; and &quot;Street Kings&quot;.

Cedric appeared as the lead comedian at the White House Correspondents Dinner, but jokingly remarked that he was unprepared because he thought that he would follow a humorous speech by President George W. Bush. He instead followed First Lady Laura Bush, who called him &quot;hilarious&quot; and &quot;probably the funniest person&quot; she had ever met.

Cedric has won many awards, beginning with $500 in the Johnny Walker National Comedy Contest in 1990 and coming in first in the Miller Genuine Draft Comedy Contest in 1993. BET named him Richard Pryor Comic of the Year. He has also won four NAACP Awards.

He was inducted to the St. Louis Walk of Fame on June 7, 2008. His star is at 6166 Delmar.

He was the special guest host for &quot;WWE Raw&quot; on September 21, 2009, in Little Rock, Arkansas. During the show, he participated in a wrestling match, defeating Chavo Guerrero Jr. by pinfall. The match also featured Santino Marella as a guest referee. Cedric also got help from an unknown wrestler dubbed The Sledge Hammer (played by Imani Lee) and Hornswoggle.

In March 2010, Cedric made his directorial debut with &quot;Dance Fu&quot;, produced and funded independently by his company Bird and a Bear Entertainment with producer Eric C. Rhone. It starred comedian Kel Mitchell. Cedric made a cameo appearance in the film as a homicide detective. It was released straight to DVD on October 4, 2011.

Cedric appeared in the Broadway revival of David Mamet&#x27;s play &quot;American Buffalo&quot;.

In a June 21, 2011, interview, Cedric said his latest reality game show, &quot;It&#x27;s Worth What?&quot;, would air on NBC on July 12, 2011, but the start date was delayed by one week to July 19. Starting in 2012, he played the main character in the TV Land original series &quot;The Soul Man&quot;, featuring Niecy Nash. The series ran for five seasons and ended in 2016.

Cedric was the host of the American TV game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, beginning with its 12th season in national syndication, which premiered on September 2, 2013. On April 30, 2014, Cedric announced that he was leaving the game show after the 2013–14 season to focus on other projects. Terry Crews took over as host on September 8, 2014.

Starting in 2018, Cedric played the character of Calvin Butler in the television sitcom &quot;The Neighborhood&quot;.

He is an official commentator for the &quot;Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson&quot; boxing match.

In 2025, Cedric the Entertainer competed on season thirteen of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Honey Pot&quot; where the bees on the mask part of his costume sported his trademark fedoras. He was the first of Group A to be eliminated in the season premiere.

==Personal life==
Cedric is married to Lorna Wells. They have two children, Croix (born 2000) and Lucky Rose (born 2003). He also has a daughter, Tiara (born 1990), from a previous relationship. He continues his involvement with his high school by awarding a scholarship each year to a graduating senior through the Cedric the Entertainer Charitable Foundation, whose motto is &quot;Reaching Out...Giving Back&quot;. In May 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in fine arts and humanities by Lincoln University of Missouri (his parents&#x27; alma mater). In 2018, St. Louis honored him by renaming the street in front of the Kappa Alpha Psi Alumni House to Cedric The Entertainer Way.

<doc id="524906" wikidata="Q210709" url="?curid=524906" title="Infancy Gospel of Thomas">
<text>The Infancy Gospel of Thomas is an apocryphal gospel about the childhood of Jesus. The scholarly consensus dates it to the mid-to-late second century, with the oldest extant fragmentary manuscript dating to the fourth or fifth century, and the earliest complete manuscript being the Codex Sabaiticus from the 11th century. There are references in letters by Hippolytus of Rome and Origen of Alexandria to a &quot;Gospel of Thomas&quot;, but it is unclear whether those letters refer to the Infancy Gospel or the Gospel of Thomas, a sayings gospel discovered near Nag Hammadi, Egypt in 1945.

Early Christian writers regarded the Infancy Gospel of Thomas as inauthentic and heretical. Eusebius rejected it as a heretical &quot;fiction&quot; in the third book of his fourth-century &quot;Church History&quot;, and Pope Gelasius I included it in his list of heretical books in the fifth century.

==Date of creation==
The first known quotation of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas is from Irenaeus of Lyon around AD 180, who calls it spurious and apocryphal. Scholars generally agree on a date in the mid-to-late-2nd century AD. There are two 2nd-century documents, the &quot;Epistula Apostolorum&quot; and Irenaeus&#x27; &quot;Adversus haereses&quot;, that refer to a story of Jesus&#x27;s tutor telling him, &quot;Say alpha,&quot; and Jesus replied, &quot;First tell me what is beta, and I can tell you what alpha is.&quot; At least some period of oral transmission of the source material is generally believed to have occurred, either wholly or as several different stories before it was first transcribed and over time redacted. Thus, both of these documents and the Infancy Gospel of Thomas possibly all refer to the oral versions of this story. The area of origin for the work is unknown and many proposed locations of origin have been put forward.

Besides the difficulty in its name, given that the work is not related to the Gospel of Thomas, the work is not a gospel but possibly an appendage to the Gospel of Luke or a stand-alone work that has a dependent association to the canonical Gospel texts. This infancy story ends with Jesus in the temple at age 12 quoting parts of the gospel of Luke. (see Infancy 19:1–12 and ).

==Authorship==
The author of the gospel is unknown. In the earliest Syriac manuscripts, no author is indicated at all, indicating either a truncated introduction, an author who wished to remain anonymous, or a compilation of existing stories by an editor. In later manuscripts dating from the Middle Ages, the Gospel opens with a prologue where &quot;Thomas the Israelite&quot; introduces himself, but with no further explanation. It is possible that this was meant to hint that the author was Judas Thomas, better known as Thomas the Apostle, thought by some Christians to be a brother of Jesus and thus familiar with young Jesus&#x27;s activities.

==Manuscript tradition==
Whether the original language of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas was Greek or Syriac is unknown. The few surviving Greek manuscripts provide no clues themselves because only one small scrap on papyrus predates the 13th century, whereas the earliest authorities, according to the editor and translator Montague Rhodes James, are a much abbreviated sixth-century Syriac version, and a Latin palimpsest of the fifth or sixth century, which has never been fully translated and can be found in Vienna. Many manuscripts, translations, shortened versions, alternates, and parallels have slight, nuanced differences. James found that their large number makes the compilation of an urtext very difficult. This number of texts and versions reflects the great popularity of the work during the High Middle Ages.

Of the many different versions and alternate forms (e.g. Greek, Syriac, Latin, Slavonic, etc.), the three principal forms are commonly referred to as given by Constantin von Tischendorf. Two of those are Greek texts which are called Greek Text A (Greek A); Greek Text B (Greek B); and the third is Latin. The first known publication of the &quot;Infancy Gospel of Thomas&quot; was by J Fabricius and has come to be known as Greek A. The Greek A is the most well-known form often used and in its full form is the longer of the two Greeks, based on at least 2 manuscripts. It consists of nineteen chapters with several alternate other manuscripts with abbreviated forms. The Greek B was found by Tischendorf on a trip to Mount Sinai in 1844, which is not only shorter (11 chapters), but is a different version of the well-known A text. It has some chapters abbreviated, other entire chapters left out completely, and few new lines. The Latin translations has two distinct form of versions from the Old Latin with the Late Latin. The Latin was notable as it was the first discovered with an Egyptian prologue.

Parts of the Latin version were translated into Old Irish poetry, probably around 700 AD according to James Carney, making this translation one of the earliest of this gospel.

An earlier manuscript of the infancy gospel has since discovered, dating to the fourth or fifth century.

==Content==
The text describes the life of the child Jesus from the ages of five to twelve, with fanciful, and sometimes malevolent, supernatural events. He is presented as a precocious child who starts his education early. The stories cover how the young Incarnation of God matures and learns to use his powers for good and how those around him first respond in fear and later with admiration. One of the episodes involves Jesus making clay birds, which he then proceeds to bring to life, an act also attributed to Jesus in , and in a medieval Jewish work known as Toledot Yeshu, although Jesus&#x27;s age at the time of the event is not specified in either account. In another episode, a child disperses water that Jesus has collected. Jesus kills this first child, when at age one he curses a boy, which causes the child&#x27;s body to wither into a corpse. Later, Jesus kills another child via curse when the child apparently accidentally bumps into Jesus, throws a stone at Jesus, or punches Jesus (depending on the translation).

When Joseph and Mary&#x27;s neighbors complain, Jesus miraculously strikes them blind. Jesus then starts receiving lessons, but tries to teach the teacher, instead, upsetting the teacher who suspects supernatural origins. Jesus is amused by this suspicion, which he confirms, and revokes all his earlier apparent cruelty. Subsequently, he resurrects a friend who is killed when he falls from a roof, and heals another who cuts his foot with an axe.

After various other demonstrations of supernatural ability, new teachers try to teach Jesus, but he proceeds to explain the law to them instead. Another set of miracles is mentioned, in which Jesus heals his brother, who is bitten by a snake, and two others, who have died from different causes. Finally, the text recounts the episode in Luke in which Jesus, aged 12, teaches in the temple.

Although the miracles seem quite randomly inserted into the text, three miracles are before and three are after each of the sets of lessons. The structure of the story is essentially:
* Bringing life to a dried fish (this is present only in later texts)
* (First group)
** Three Miracles – Breathes life into birds fashioned from clay; curses a boy, who then becomes a corpse (not present in Greek B); curses a boy who falls dead and his parents become blind
** Attempt to teach Jesus, which fails, with Jesus doing the teaching
** Three Miracles – Reverses his earlier acts (this would include resurrecting the two boys and healing the blind parents), resurrects a friend who fell from a roof, heals a man who chopped his foot with an axe
* (Second group)
** Three Miracles – carries water on cloth, produces a feast from a single grain, and stretches a beam of wood to help his father finish constructing a bed
** Attempts to teach Jesus, which fail, with Jesus doing the teaching
** Three Miracles – heals James from snake poison, resurrects a child who died of illness, and resurrects a man who died in a construction accident
* Incident in the temple paralleling Luke

<text>Frederick Charles Alderdice (November 10, 1871 – February 26, 1936) was a Newfoundland businessman, politician and the last Prime Minister of Newfoundland. Alderdice was born in Belfast, Ireland and was educated at Methodist College Belfast. He moved to Newfoundland in 1886. A prominent St. John&#x27;s businessman, Alderdice was appointed to the Legislative Council of Newfoundland (the Upper House of the legislature) in 1924 and became leader of the Liberal-Conservative Progressive Party and the dominion&#x27;s Prime Minister when his cousin Walter Stanley Monroe retired from the post on August 15, 1928. Alderdice&#x27;s first term as prime minister was short-lived, however, as his government lost that year&#x27;s general election to the Liberals led by Sir Richard Squires.

Alderdice joined with Liberals dissatisfied with Squires to form the United Newfoundland Party with himself as leader. The Great Depression embroiled the dominion in a severe economic crisis which was compounded by corruption in the Squires government taking the dominion to the brink of bankruptcy. Widespread unemployment added to the crisis and resulted in an anti-government riot in St. John&#x27;s on April 5, 1932. The Squires government collapsed and Alderdice swept to power in the ensuing June election on the promise that if elected, his government would examine the possibility of suspending the constitution and having a commission administer the country until conditions improved. His United Newfoundland Party won 24 seats to only two for the Liberals.

The Alderdice government was unable to deal with the economic crisis and proposed a partial default on the dominion&#x27;s debts. Britain and Canada (whose currency was shared by Newfoundland) agreed to give the dominion financial aid in exchange for the creation of an Imperial Royal Commission to investigate the dominion&#x27;s future. The Commission recommended the suspension of responsible government and the institution of an appointed Commission of Government to rule the dominion.

Alderdice was pressured by the British to accept the recommendations without calling a new election or submitting the proposals to a referendum. Alderdice agreed and, at the end of 1933, the legislature voted to accept the recommendations and voted itself out of existence. Alderdice was appointed to the Commission of Government when it was established in February 1934 and served as Commissioner for Home Affairs and Education in the new Commission of Government as well as Vice-Chairman until his death in 1936.

<doc id="524917" wikidata="Q2910701" url="?curid=524917" title="Airstream mechanism">
<text>In phonetics, the airstream mechanism is the method by which airflow is created in the vocal tract. Along with phonation and articulation, it is one of three main components of speech production. The airstream mechanism is mandatory for most sound production and constitutes the first part of this process, which is called initiation.

The organ generating the airstream is called the &quot;initiator&quot; and there are three initiators used phonemically in non-disordered human oral languages:
* the diaphragm together with the ribs and lungs &quot;(pulmonic&quot; mechanisms),
* the glottis &quot;(glottalic&quot; mechanisms), and
* the tongue &quot;(lingual&quot; or &quot;velaric&quot; mechanisms).
There are also methods of making sounds that do not require the glottis. These mechanisms are collectively called alaryngeal speech mechanisms (none of these speech mechanisms are used in non-disordered speech):

* the cheeks &quot;(buccal&quot; mechanisms, notated {ↀ} in VoQS). See buccal speech.
* after a laryngectomy, the esophagus may be used (notated {Œ} for simple esophageal speech, {Ю} for tracheo-esophageal speech in VoQS, and notated {И} for electrolaryngeal speech). See esophageal speech.
* the pharynx, and replacing the glottis using the tongue and the upper alveolus, the palate, or the pharyngeal wall. See pharyngeal speech.

&quot;Percussive&quot; consonants are produced without any airstream mechanism.

==Types of airstream mechanism==

Any of the three principal initiators − diaphragm, glottis or tongue − may act by either increasing or decreasing the pressure generating the airstream. These changes in pressure often correspond to outward and inward airflow, and are therefore termed &quot;egressive&quot; and &quot;ingressive&quot; respectively.

Of these six resulting airstream mechanisms, four are found lexically around the world, alongside the percussive sounds produced without an airstream mechanism, for a total of five:
* &quot;pulmonic egressive,&quot; where the air is pushed out of the lungs by the ribs and diaphragm. All human languages employ such sounds (such as /b/), and nearly three out of four use them exclusively.
* &quot;glottalic egressive,&quot; where the air column is compressed as the glottis moves upward. Such consonants are called ejectives. Ejective and ejective-like consonants occur in 16% of the languages.
* &quot;glottalic ingressive,&quot; where the air column is rarefied as the glottis moves downward. Such consonants are called implosives. Implosive and implosive-like consonants occur in 13% of the world&#x27;s languages. Despite the name, the airstream may not actually flow inward: While the glottis moves downward, pulmonic air passes outward through it, but the reduction in pressure makes an audible difference to the sound. 
* &quot;lingual ingressive,&quot; &quot;velaric ingressive,&quot; where the air in the mouth is rarefied by a downward and sometimes rearward movement of the tongue. These are the click consonants. Clicks are regular sounds in ordinary (i.e. lexical) words in fewer than 2% of the world&#x27;s languages, all in Africa.
* &quot;percussive&quot;, where two organs are struck against each other. No standalone percussive occurs in any language, but alveolar clicks may have a sublingual percussive release in Sandawe, where after the click is pronounced, the tongue strikes the floor of the mouth.

That leaves pulmonic ingressive and lingual (velaric) egressive as the only two airstream mechanisms produced by the three main initiators that are not found lexically in the world.

These mechanisms may be combined into airstream contours, such as clicks which release into ejectives.

In normal vocabulary, the various Khoisan languages have pulmonic, ejective, and click consonants; the Chadic languages, some Mayan languages, and scattered Nilo-Saharan languages such as Gumuz, Uduk and Meʼen have pulmonic, implosive, and ejective consonants, and the Nguni languages of the Bantu family utilize all four, – pulmonic, click, implosive, and ejective, – as does the Dahalo language of Kenya. Most other languages utilize at most two airstream mechanisms.

In interjections, the other two mechanisms may be employed. For example, in countries as diverse as Sweden, Turkey, and Togo, a pulmonic ingressive (&quot;gasped&quot; or &quot;inhaled&quot;) vowel is used for back-channeling or to express agreement, and in France a lingual egressive (a &quot;spurt&quot;) is used to express dismissal. The only language where such sounds are known to be contrastive in normal vocabulary is the extinct ritual language Damin (also the only language outside Africa with clicks); however, Damin appears to have been intentionally designed to differ from normal speech.

==Pulmonic initiation==
Initiation by means of the lungs (actually the diaphragm and ribs) is called pulmonic initiation. The vast majority of sounds used in human languages are pulmonic egressives. In most languages, including all the languages of Europe (excluding the Caucasus), all phonemes are pulmonic egressives.

The only attested use of a phonemic pulmonic ingressive is a lateral fricative in Damin, a ritual language formerly used by speakers of Lardil in Australia. This can be written with the extended version of the International Phonetic Alphabet as . !Xóõ has ingression as a phonetic detail in one series of its clicks, which are &quot;ingressive voiceless nasals with delayed aspiration&quot;, . Peter Ladefoged considers these to be among the most difficult sounds in the world. Other languages, for example in Taiwan, have been claimed to have pulmonic ingressives, but these claims have either proven to be spurious or to be occasional phonetic detail.

In interjections, but not in normal words, pulmonic ingressive vowels or words occur on all continents. This is commonly done for back-channeling (as with in Ewe) or affirmation (as with in Swedish). In English, an audible intake of breath, , or an indrawn consonant such as or is used in a conversation to indicate that someone is about to speak or is preparing to continue speaking. In some languages, such as Finnish and Amharic, entire phrases may be uttered with an ingressive airstream. (See ingressive sound.)

==Glottalic initiation==

It is possible to initiate airflow in the upper vocal tract by means of the vocal cords or glottis. This is known as glottalic initiation.

For egressive glottalic initiation, one lowers the glottis (as if to sing a low note), closes it as for a glottal stop, and then raises it, building up pressure in the oral cavity and upper trachea. Glottalic egressives are called ejectives. The glottis must be fully closed to form glottalic egressives, or the air column would flow backwards over it; it is therefore impossible to pronounce voiced ejectives. Ejective allophones of voiceless stops occur in many varieties of English at the ends of intonation units.

For ingressive glottalic initiation, the sequence of actions performed in glottalic pressure initiation is reversed:  one raises the glottis (as if to sing a high note), closes it, and then lowers it to create suction in the upper trachea and oral cavity. Glottalic ingressives are called implosives, although they may involve zero airflow rather than actual inflow. Because the air column would flow forwards over the descending glottis, it is not necessary to fully close it, and implosives may be voiced; indeed, voiceless implosives are exceedingly rare.

It is usual for implosives to be voiced. Instead of keeping the glottis tightly closed, it is tensed but left slightly open to allow a thin stream of air through. Unlike pulmonic voiced sounds, in which a stream of air passes through a usually-fixed glottis, in voiced implosives a mobile glottis passes over a nearly motionless air column to cause vibration of the vocal cords. Phonations that are more open than modal voice, such as breathy voice, are not conducive to glottalic sounds because in these the glottis is held relatively open, allowing air to readily flow through and preventing a significant pressure difference from building up behind the articulator.

Because the oral cavity is so much smaller than the lungs, vowels and approximants cannot be pronounced with glottalic initiation. So-called glottalized vowels and other sonorants use the more common pulmonic egressive airstream mechanism.

There is no clear divide between pulmonic and glottalic sounds. Some languages may have consonants which are intermediate. For example, glottalized consonants in London English, such as the &quot;t&quot; in &quot;rat&quot; , may be weakly ejective. Similarly, fully voiced stops in languages such as Thai, Zulu, and Maidu are weakly implosive. This ambiguity does not occur with the next airstream mechanism, lingual, which is clearly distinct from pulmonic sounds.

==Lingual (velaric) initiation==

The third form of initiation in human language is lingual or velaric initiation, where a sound is produced by a closure at two places of articulation, and the airstream is formed by movement of the body of the tongue. Lingual stops are more commonly known as clicks, and are almost universally ingressive. The word &quot;lingual&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;lingua&quot;, which means tongue.

To produce a lingual ingressive airstream, first close the vocal tract at two places: at the back of the tongue, as in a velar or uvular stop, and simultaneously with the front of the tongue or the lips, as in a coronal or bilabial stop. These holds may be voiceless, voiced, or nasalized. Then lower the body of the tongue to rarefy the air above it. The closure at the front of the tongue is opened first, as the click &quot;release&quot;; then the closure at the back is released for the pulmonic or glottalic click &quot;accompaniment&quot; or &quot;efflux&quot;. This may be aspirated, affricated, or even ejective. Even when not ejective, it is not uncommon for the glottis to be closed as well, for a triply articulated consonant, and this third closure is released last to produce a glottalized click. Clicks are found in very few languages, notably the Khoisan languages of southern Africa and some nearby tongues such as Zulu. They are more often found in extra-linguistic contexts, such as the &quot;tsk tsk&quot; sound many Westerners use to express regret or pity (a dental click), or the clucking noise used by many equestrians to urge on their horses (a lateral click).

Lingual egressive initiation is performed by reversing the sequence of a lingual ingressive: the front and back of the tongue (or lips and back of the tongue) seal off the vocal cavity, and the cheeks and middle of the tongue move inward and upward to increase oral pressure. The only attested use of a lingual egressive is a bilabial nasal egressive click in Damin. Transcribing this also requires the use of the Extended IPA, .

Since the air pocket used to initiate lingual consonants is so small, it is not thought to be possible to produce lingual fricatives, vowels, or other sounds which require continuous airflow.

Clicks may be voiced, but they are more easily nasalized. This may be because the vocal cavity behind the rearmost closure, behind which the air passing through the glottis for voicing must be contained, is so small that clicks cannot be voiced for long. Allowing the airstream to pass through the nose enables a longer production.

Nasal clicks involve a combination of lingual and pulmonic mechanisms. The velum is lowered so as to direct pulmonic airflow through the nasal cavity during the lingual initiation. This nasal airflow may itself be egressive or ingressive, independently of the lingual initiation of the click. Nasal clicks may be voiced, but are very commonly unvoiced and even aspirated, which is rare for purely pulmonic nasals.

==Airstream contours==

In some treatments, complex clicks are posited to have airstream contours, in which the airstream changes between the front (click) and rear (non-click) release. There are two attested types: Linguo-pulmonic consonants, where the rear release is a uvular obstruent such as or ; and linguo-glottalic consonants, where the rear release is an ejective such as or . 

Not only are simultaneous (rather than contour) implosive clicks possible, i.e. velar (e.g. ), uvular (), and &quot;de facto&quot; front-closed palatal (), but velar implosive clicks are easier to produce than modally voiced clicks. However, they are not attested in any language.

==Percussive consonants==

Consonants may be pronounced without any airstream mechanism. These are &quot;percussive&quot; consonants, where the sound is generated by one organ striking another. Percussive consonants are not phonemic in any known language, though the extensions to the IPA for disordered speech provide symbols for a bilabial percussive (smacking lips) and a bidental percussive (gnashing teeth). The only percussive known to be used in nondisordered speech is a sublingual percussive (a tongue slap) that appears allophonically in the release of alveolar clicks in the Sandawe language of Tanzania.

<text>Ruth Shick Montgomery (June 11, 1912 – June 10, 2001) was a journalist with a long and distinguished career as a reporter, correspondent, and syndicated columnist in Washington, DC.

Later in life she transitioned to a career as a psychic and authored a number of books on metaphysical and New Age subjects. The polar shift of the early 21st century was among many predictions made by a spirit guide group from whom she regularly translated messages. She was a biographer of paranormal medium Jeane Dixon and a protégée of Arthur Ford, who claimed that he, like Edgar Cayce, could access the Akashic Records (or database) of the Universe.

== Journalism ==

Montgomery began her long journalism profession as a cub reporter for &quot;Waco-News-Tribune&quot; while receiving her education at Baylor University (1930–1935). Later she graduated from Purdue University (1934) and began work as a reporter on the &quot;Louisville Herald-Post&quot;.

In 1943, she became the first female reporter in the Washington bureau of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, and embarked on her extensive Washington, DC career. She covered notable foreign affairs (the Berlin Airlift among them), was a syndicated columnist for Hearst Headlines and United Press International and was a well-read correspondent with the International News Service.

At Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s funeral, Montgomery was the only female of the 12 invited reporters. In 1950, while a reporter for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, she was voted president of the Women&#x27;s National Press Club. In 1959, she was a member of then Vice-president Richard Nixon&#x27;s press corps on his tour of Russia. Montgomery wrote of her 25 years covering Washington in her 1970 book, “Hail to the Chiefs; My Life and Times with Six Presidents”.

Montgomery wrote annual newspaper columns listing predictions by psychic Jeane Dixon beginning in 1952. In 1962, “Once There was a Nun: Mary McCarran&#x27;s Years as Sister Mary Mercy” was published and thus began Montgomery&#x27;s long career as a non-fiction author. In 1965 her book, “A Gift of Prophecy” about Jeane Dixon was published and became a best-seller, selling over 3 million copies.

Montgomery retired from her journalism career in 1969. As part of their Texas Collection, the Archives Division at Baylor University contains a research collection which include papers of Montgomery.

She held honorary doctor of law degrees from Baylor University and Ashland College.

==New Age writing==

Soon after meeting celebrity medium Arthur Ford, Montgomery began automatic writing, first with a pencil and later with a typewriter, and said she was able to communicate with Ford after his passing. These post-mortem communications became the basis for a lengthy series of books which resulted in her achieving minor celebrity status, when Montgomery became a regular on the morning talk show circuit. During the 1960s and 1970s she became a household name.

Montgomery, whose prolific New Age writings earned her a loyal and enthusiastic following, believed her mission on Earth was to educate the public regarding her views on life after death, which is not uncommon among spiritualists. She also studied reincarnation and came to believe that mental and physical illnesses often have their origins in past lives. Montgomery wrote of such things as birth marks indicating the possible sites of past life injuries and commented that often children born with serious defects or illnesses are in fact repaying debts incurred in previous existences. Her books sometimes discussed the past lives of the famous among her contemporaries, stating that Ernest Hemingway had once been a Hun warrior and that in a previous incarnation Jacqueline Kennedy was a famed French queen.

Montgomery was a believer in the existence of extraterrestrial contact and documented meetings she had with non-human aliens on a number of occasions, particularly when she resided in Mexico in the 1970s.

With other like-minded mystics, Montgomery founded the Association for Past Life Research and Therapy. Her many books (allegedly channeled via automatic writing from her spirit guides) popularized spiritualist notions in public consciousness in the 1960s through the 1990s, and paved the way for what is now known as the New Age movement. Montgomery is particularly noted for documenting the walk-in theory whereby a person&#x27;s soul can depart a hurt or anguished body and be replaced with a new soul which overtakes the body. In her writings she presented an extensive list of present-day and historical individuals she said were examples of &quot;walk-ins&quot; including several US presidents.

== Past life regression ==

In her book &quot;A World Beyond&quot;, Montgomery revealed that in a past incarnation she had been alive during the time of Christ and known as Lazarus&#x27; third sister Ruth, who is not mentioned in the Bible. As this woman, Montgomery claims to have witnessed Jesus&#x27; circumcision.

== Predictions ==

Echoing the earlier predictions of Edgar Cayce, Montgomery believed that ancient advanced civilizations of &quot;Mu&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; had destroyed themselves thousands of years in the pre-history of modern man. Montgomery claimed we would see remnants of the lost continent of Atlantis rise from the sea after a &quot;Polar Shift&quot; which she foretold coming to pass in 1999.

Montgomery predicted in the 1970s (with the help of her supposed spirit guides) that World War III would begin in the mid-1980s when a brush-fire conflict, started by Ethiopian strongman Mengistu Haile Mariam, would spread first to the Middle East, and then Europe. Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;guides&quot; stated that humans have free will and can make their own decisions regarding their destiny, and after the failure of her predictions regarding global strife, she attributed her error to this cause.

Montgomery also predicted that Ronald Reagan would be a one-term President to be followed in 1984 by a big-spending Democrat, and that in the 1970s and 1980s, America would have a &quot;walk-in&quot; as president in the 199 (&quot;unsure which term, 1992 or 1996&quot;) before a Polar Shift, which was to happen &quot;in the last months of the century&quot; would eradicate most human life on Earth, and greatly alter existing coastlines.

The Guides predicted in her 1999 book &quot;The World To Come&quot; that the walk-in president would not come until 2008 at the earliest, and therefore the Shift would be delayed until 2010–2012 at least. The potential catastrophe of the shift was also reduced by human free will. Except for Florida and the coast of California, the Guides reported, most of America will survive, a direct contradiction of Montgomery&#x27;s earlier forecast of significant global destruction in the coming event.

==Influence in popular culture==

Montgomery&#x27;s book &quot;Aliens Among Us&quot; has been cited by Sammy Hagar as the inspiration for the 1985 Van Halen song &quot;Love Walks In&quot;. The book&#x27;s account of benevolent aliens residing on earth in human form for the purpose of assisting humanity during a critical time is the template for speculation in UFOlogy communities. Alleged extraterrestrial candidates include far-reaching public figures such as technology visionary Steve Jobs, psychic medium Danielle Egnew and the Dalai Lama.

<text>The epiglottal or pharyngeal plosive (or stop) is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is .

Esling (2010) describes the sound covered by the term &quot;epiglottal plosive&quot; as an &quot;active closure by the aryepiglottic pharyngeal stricture mechanism&quot; – that is, a stop produced by the aryepiglottic folds within the pharynx.

==Features==
Features of the epiglottal stop:

*It has no defined phonation, although it is typically voiceless, which means it is produced without vibrations of the vocal cords. Voiced epiglottal &quot;stops&quot; tend toward being epiglottal flaps.

<text>The Speak &amp; Spell line is a series of electronic hand-held child computers by Texas Instruments that consisted of a TMC0280 linear predictive coding speech synthesizer, a keyboard, and a receptor slot to receive one of a collection of ROM game library modules. The first Speak &amp; Spell was introduced at the summer Consumer Electronics Show in , making it one of the earliest handheld electronic devices with a visual display to use interchangeable game cartridges. The company Basic Fun brought back a variant of the second-gen classic Speak &amp; Spell in 2019 with a newly recorded voice and other minor changes.

The Speak &amp; Spell was named an IEEE Milestone in 2009.

== Background ==
The Speak &amp; Spell was created by a small team of engineers led by Paul Breedlove, himself an engineer, with Texas Instruments (TI) during the late 1970s. Development began in 1976 with an initial budget of $25,000, as an outgrowth of TI&#x27;s research into speech synthesis. The completed proof version of the first console utilized TI&#x27;s trademarked Solid State Speech technology to store full words in a solid state format similar to the manner in which calculators of the time stored numbers. Additional purchased cartridges (called expansion modules) could be inserted through the battery receptacle to provide new solid-state libraries and new games. This represented the first time an educational toy utilized speech that was not recorded on tape or phonograph record (as with Mattel&#x27;s See &#x27;n Say line or the earlier Chatty Cathy dolls).

== The Speak &amp; Spell console ==
The original Speak &amp; Spell was the first of a three-part talking educational toy series that also included Speak &amp; Read and Speak &amp; Math. This series was a subset of TI&#x27;s Learning Center product group and the Speak &amp; Spell was released simultaneously with the Spelling B (a non-speech product designed to help children learn to spell), and the First Watch (designed to teach children to read digital and analog timepieces). The Speak &amp; Spell was sold, with regional variations, in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan.

The toy was originally advertised as a tool for helping children ages 7 and up to learn to spell and pronounce over 200 commonly misspelled words. It shipped without a cartridge, in this configuration called simply the &quot;Basic Unit&quot; (containing the minigames &quot;Mystery Word&quot;, &quot;Secret Code&quot;, and &quot;Letter&quot;).

=== Later Speak &amp; Spell models ===

Between its release and 1983, the Speak &amp; Spell was redesigned twice under the name Speak &amp; Spell. It was completely recreated in 1982 as the Speak &amp; Spell Compact (a version lacking a visual display), and in 1989 the Super Speak &amp; Spell was released to replace the original vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) with a liquid crystal display (LCD). Between 1989 and 1992 the Super Speak &amp; Spell saw three redesigns as well. The 1992 Super Speak &amp; Spell marked the last release of the series.

Regional variations with different speech libraries and different games were released in at least 9 countries with seven language variations. Because the linguistic aspect of the games played on the Speak &amp; Spell are of central importance to Speak &amp; Spell titles, separate cartridge libraries were developed for English (including American and British), Japanese, German, French, Italian, and Spanish markets. Beyond the natural disinclination of consumers to purchase games in foreign languages, however, regional lockout does not prevent the use of expansion module cartridges in consoles for which they were not designed. Since the layout of foreign editions is nearly identical (the only major differences being graphics, color, and placement of power/headset jacks), and the cartridges lacked a lockout, cartridges often bore instructions in multiple languages despite their designation for consumer groups that might not understand the language.

In 1980, the original Speak &amp; Spell was redesigned to give it a membrane keyboard in place of raised buttons. This version was nearly identical to the first release and with backward compatible cartridge recognition common to all Speak &amp; Spells except the first version of the Super Speak &amp; Spell, the entire library of cartridges from the original release were available to the 1980 release. Outside of the United States, the 1980 release was marketed in the United Kingdom under the same name, in German as the Buddy (employing an umlaut in place of the Speak &amp; Spell&#x27;s apostrophe), and in French as La Dictée Magique (&quot;The Magical Dictation&quot;).

In 1982, the Speak &amp; Spell Compact was released at about half the size of the Speak &amp; Spell and lacking the VFD screen. The Speak &amp; Spell Compact was a dedicated console and only one other version, the Speak &amp; Write, was released for English markets. Speak &amp; Spell Compact sales were very poor in the United States, causing TI to send much of its excess stock abroad. UK Marketing Manager Martin Finn had the product retitled for the UK, and all existing units were recolored blue and repackaged as &quot;Speak &amp; Write&quot;.

In 1983, the Speak &amp; Spell was again redesigned. The change was even more minute, however, representing nothing more substantial than a redesign of the faceplate graphics. This version was marketed first in Italian as Grillo Parlante (&quot;The Talking Cricket&quot; as the character of the book for children &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;), and then later in the United States and the United Kingdom as the Speak &amp; Spell, and in France as the Dictée Magique again.

The Super Speak &amp; Spell was released in 1989 with a number of major changes. The display screen was changed to an LCD screen instead of the former VFD screen. The keyboard layout was also altered to match the standard QWERTY keyboard rather than the ABC keyboard. The general structure of the console was also altered so that the handle which had come at the top of the screen in prior Speak &amp; Spells was now found on the bottom of the toy and ergonomic features were added to the shape. Furthermore, game cartridges for the Super Speak &amp; Spell were changed so that they were incompatible with prior Speak &amp; Spells and the cartridge slot was similarly altered to prevent backward compatibility.

The following year the Super Speak &amp; Spell was again majorly redesigned to return to a considerable degree to its prior Speak &amp; Spell form. This version re-adopted the handle-on-top look of the previous models and resumed the use of the original cartridges. The use of the LCD screen and the QWERTY keyboard were retained; however, the keyboard gained an additional 5 letters (6 in some regions) to correspond with letters requiring diacritics. It was marketed first in Spanish as El Loro Parlanchín (&quot;The Chatty Parrot&quot;), and then later in the United States as the Super Speak &amp; Spell, in French as La Super Dictée Magique, and in Italian as Grillo Parlante Più (&quot;Speaking Cricket Plus&quot;).

In 1992, a third redesign of the Super Speak &amp; Spell was made for the Spanish market only. The new version was nearly identical to the prior El Loro Parlanchín save for the name which became El Loro (&quot;Professor Parrot&quot;).

===2019 Speak &amp; Spell===
In 2019, Basic Fun acquired rights to manufacture the Speak &amp; Spell; however, the updated version introduced a number of changes. Primary among these is the replacement of the original microprocessor and classic synthesized voice chip (TMS1000 and TMC0280 respectively) with recorded dialog that is processed to sound as if it&#x27;s synthesized. It also offers on-device instructions that weren&#x27;t available on previous versions. The 2019 model Speak &amp; Spell also replaces the VFD screen with a segmented LCD screen. The use of removable cartridges has also been eliminated.

== Electronics ==
The Speak &amp; Spell used the first single-chip voice synthesizer, the TMC0280, later known as the TI TMS5100, which utilized a 10th-order linear predictive coding (LPC) model by using pipelined electronic DSP logic. A variant of this chip with a very similar voice was eventually used in certain Chrysler vehicles in the 1980s as the Electronic Voice Alert.

Speech synthesis data (phoneme data) for the spoken words were stored on a pair of 128 Kbit metal gate PMOS ROMs. 128 Kbit was at the time the largest capacity ROM in use. Additional memory module cartridges could be interchangeably plugged into a slot in the battery compartment and selected via a button on the keyboard. The technique used to create the words was to have a professional speaker speak the words. The utterances were captured and processed. Originally all of the recording and processing was completed in Dallas. By 1982 when the British, French, Italian and German versions were being developed, the original voices were recorded in the TI facility near Nice in France and these full bit rate digital recordings were sent to Dallas for processing using a minicomputer. Some weeks later the processed data was returned and required significant hand editing to fix the voicing errors which had occurred during the process. The data rate was so radically cut that all of the words needed some editing. In some cases, this was fairly simple, but some words were unintelligible and required days of work and others had to be completely scrapped. The stored data were for the specific words and phrases used in the Speak &amp; Spell. The data rate was about 1,000 bits per second.

The video display employed in the Speak &amp; Spell was a vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) that was only capable of displaying 8 text characters at a time. The later Super Speak &amp; Spell model had a slimmer case and an LCD screen which could display 16 characters.

The unit could use either 4 &quot;C&quot; batteries or 6-volt DC power adapter with positive tip polarity.

== Cartridges ==
Cartridges (also known as expansion modules) are freely exchangeable ROM libraries that provide additional content without providing additional functionality. These cartridges are plugged into a slot near the battery compartment in order to introduce new software libraries. Word and game lists are of different lengths depending upon the cartridge and the word lists in models marketed for different languages reflect the language marketed for. Separate word lists also exist for regional variants such as the American and British English versions.
The word list used in each of the regional models reflects the recommendations of educators in each country. The English, French, German and Italian versions were all created by a team of non-specialists, in TI&#x27;s plant near Antibes, France, under the watchful eye of Larry Brantingham who had patented the underlying technology.

Examples of educational games that could be played using Speak &amp; Spell cartridges include:
*&quot;Say It&quot; – A word-spelling game where the player must spell ten words after hearing them &quot;spoken&quot; by the unit. The &quot;E.T. Fantasy Module&quot; tie-in (based on the toy&#x27;s appearance in the movie &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;) asked players to spell such words as &quot;geranium&quot;, &quot;universe&quot;, and &quot;creature&quot;.
*&quot;Mystery Word&quot; – An electronic version of hangman
*&quot;Secret Code&quot; – A code-generating program in which the player enters a word on the Speak &amp; Spell and the console returns the word in code.
*&quot;Letter&quot; – Another algorithm that allows the player to change a word that has been entered by shifting its letters several spaces down the alphabet.
*&quot;Drop It&quot; – A Super Speak &amp; Spell game in which the player will see how new words are made by adding prefixes and suffixes.
*&quot;Memory&quot; – A Super Speak &amp; Spell game in which letter recognition and visual memory skills are tested.
*&quot;Mystery&quot; – A Super Speak &amp; Spell game in which letter patterns in words and visual memory are developed.
*&quot;Mix Up&quot; – A Super Speak &amp; Spell game in which word patterns and the relationships between letter sounds and spelling are tested.
*&quot;Same As&quot; – A Super Speak &amp; Spell game in which homophones are tested.
*&quot;A.C.E.&quot; – A Super Speak &amp; Spell game in which abbreviations, contractions, and word endings are tested.
*&quot;Race&quot; – A Super Speak &amp; Spell game in which fast recall, accurate spelling, and touch-typing skills are tested with time limits.

The &quot;Secret Code&quot; mini-game encrypted or decrypted &quot;words&quot; (really, any string of up to 8 letters) by matching up two sets of the alphabet, slightly askew, in the form of a Caesar cipher. In the game, both C and D and P and Q match up and run in opposite directions:

: codice_1
: codice_2

== Home computer adaptations ==
Several commercial retailers offered hardware and software which allowed home computers to interface with the Speak &amp; Spell&#x27;s hardware and access its capabilities, and Larry Dighera was first to reveal how that might be accomplished.

Percom Data Company offered a PC Card named &quot;Speak-2-Me-2&quot; which was installed into the battery compartment of the Speak &amp; Spell and connected via cable to a TRS-80.

East Coast Micro Products offered hardware to interface 6502-based computers such as the Commodore 64 and Apple IIe with the Speak &amp; Spell. A program called &quot;S.peek.uP&quot; was marketed which could control this hardware.

The February 1983 issue of &quot;Computers &amp; Electronics&quot; contained instructions for interfacing a Speak &amp; Spell with a Sinclair ZX-80 a Sinclair ZX-81, or a Timex 1000.

Texas Instruments itself later adapted the Speak &amp; Spell&#x27;s technology into a speech synthesizer accessory for its popular TI-99/4A computer.

=== Emulation ===
The Speak &amp; Spell (as well as the &quot;Speak &amp; Math&quot; and &quot;Speak &amp; Read&quot;) are emulated, running the original code, by MESS.

A number of simulations of the Speak &amp; Spell (not emulations, as they don&#x27;t run the original code) have shown up online in recent years with varying degrees of functionality. Often programmed for Flash, these are often the result of nostalgic sentiment for the 1980s.

Examples of simulators generally available online include:
*SASS – A fully functional non-Flash executable simulator created by Mike Green in 1999
*Speak &amp; Spell Online – a Flash-based web application with partial functionality created by Jake Smith in 2002
*Speak &amp; Spell Emulator – a Flash-based web application with full functionality created by Kevin St.Onge in 2006
*Speak &amp; Spell JS – a Javascript-based web application with partial functionality created by Shannon Carey in 2008

== Legacy ==

=== In commercial music ===

The Speak &amp; Spell has been employed in recent years in commercial music as an instrument either in its original form or as a modified &quot;bent&quot; circuit instrument (see below). Artists like Kraftwerk have used the musical samples from the Speak &amp; Spell&#x27;s opening sequence in their songs, whereas most employed the non-musical vocal portions of the Speak &amp; Spell to create vocal parts in their songs. Speak &amp; Spell speech synthesis has featured in genres such as alternative rock (e.g. Beck, Limp Bizkit), electronic music (e.g. Jean Michel Jarre, Röyksopp, and Robyn), synthpop (e.g. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Plastics, Erasure, and Freezepop), trance music (e.g. Sōta Fujimori), electropop (e.g. TLC), Christian rock (e.g. Resurrection Band, Family Force 5), pop (e.g. Cheetah Girls), and hip hop (e.g. Naya Rivera).

The English synthpop band Depeche Mode&#x27;s 1981 debut album, &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot;, is named after it.

=== Circuit bending ===

Some musicians have also used modified &quot;circuit bent&quot; (where electronic circuits are customised to create new effects) Speak &amp; Spell units in their compositions. By opening the Speak &amp; Spell&#x27;s case, cross-wiring terminals, and installing electronic components such as switches and potentiometers, amateur hobbyists purposely disrupt the normal functioning of the Speak &amp; Spell&#x27;s membrane keyboard matrix circuit in order to create new sounds. These modifications act to overwhelm the unit&#x27;s keyboard switch matrix to produce an effect known in the field of electronics as key jamming or ghosting. This effect can be triggered in the Speak &amp; Spell without making modifications if more than 3 keys in the same row are depressed simultaneously; however, within the circuit bending culture, emphasis is given to the fact that these units are being used as instruments and thus externally manipulable components are often accentuated. Great attention may be given to enhancing the visual aesthetics of the units by adding decorations and repainting &quot;bent&quot; Speak &amp; Spells, and these units have been traded and sold online and within the circuit bender community.

Examples of artists who have used circuit-bent Speak &amp; Spells in their compositions include Beck, CocoRosie, Eisbrecher, Experimental Audio Research, Fantômas, Scrabbel, Venetian Snares, and Claude Woodward The Sonic Manipulator.

=== In popular culture ===
The Speak &amp; Spell features in various electronics museums such as the Computer History Museum and the Smithsonian National Museum of American History due to its seminal influence in the field of modern speech synthesis. The Speak &amp; Spell is also featured in the Game On exhibition as an example of a handheld video game.

The Speak &amp; Spell has shown up in various television shows, films, and game shows. A Speak &amp; Spell has a prominent role as a key component of the alien creature&#x27;s homebuilt interstellar communicator in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. Speak &amp; Spells also make appearances in movies such as Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (where the game device is a character named &quot;Mr. Spell&quot;), &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; (where the possessed doll, Chucky plays with one), in &quot;Poltergeist III&quot; (used by the character Carol Anne Freeling), and in the music videos for the songs &quot;Playgirl&quot; by the synthpop music group Ladytron, &quot;Fireflies&quot; by Owl City and &quot;Dare&quot; by Gorillaz. The speak and spell voice also appears in the video games Deltarune and TxK.

== Variants ==
=== Speak &amp; Read line ===
The Speak &amp; Read was released in 1980 with a shape identical to the Speak &amp; Spell but with different game features and a different color scheme. Where the American Speak &amp; Spell had been colored red with yellow and orange accents, the American Speak &amp; Read was yellow with blue and green accents. Game cartridges for the Speak &amp; Read were identical in shape to those of the main Speak &amp; Spell line, and they could be physically inserted into units from the wrong line; however, they did not function except in members of their own line. The Speak &amp; Read was designed to focus on reading comprehension in children of ages 4–8 with a library of over 250 basic words.

The Speak &amp; Read was very minutely redesigned in 1986, under the same name, with the new version representing nothing more substantial than a redesign of the faceplate graphics. In 1988 the Super Speak &amp; Read was released as a major redesign to feature a suitcase-like flip-open appearance. Cartridges were redesigned to be thinner and of a different shape, bearing some resemblance to the cartridges of TI&#x27;s Touch &amp; Discover line. Additionally, the keyboard was removed completely and a matrix of membrane buttons took its place similarly to the position-sensitive &quot;keyboard&quot; of the Touch &amp; Discover consoles. Each cartridge came with a work-booklet that was laid out in an open position in the center of the Super Speak &amp; Read. As questions were asked, the player pressed the appropriate portion of the work-booklet to depress the membrane button beneath. This was the last member of the Speak &amp; Read line under this name; however, the Ready... Set... Read! (sharing a highly similar design layout) and later Magic Reading Desk (featuring a modified Ready... Set... Read! layout) are considered the Speak &amp; Read&#x27;s spiritual successors. Both Ready... Set... Read! and Magic Reading Desk cartridges are identical in design to the Super Speak &amp; Read&#x27;s cartridges.

=== Speak &amp; Math line ===
The Speak &amp; Math (sold as &quot;Speak &amp; Maths&quot; in some countries) was released in 1980 with a shape identical to both the Speak &amp; Spell and the Speak &amp; Read but with a completely different keyboard layout, different game features, and a different color scheme. Where the American Speak &amp; Spell had been colored red with yellow and orange accents, the American Speak &amp; Math was gray with blue and orange highlights. The Speak &amp; Math was designed to focus on mathematics in children of ages 6–12 with a library of over 100,000 random and preprogrammed problems. It was regarded as the spiritual successor to TI&#x27;s earlier DataMan series, with the difference mainly relating to the addition of speech synthesizing software and the visual display. The Speak &amp; Math was only released to American and British markets.

In 1982, a compact version of the Speak &amp; Math was developed contemporaneously with the Speak &amp; Spell Compact. This version was only released in France as Les Maths Magique (lit. The Magical Math). A redesigned version was developed in 1985 for British markets under the name of Maths marvel. This was later released in Italian as Dotto Conta-Parla, in French as le Calcul magique (lit. Magical Calculator), and in German as Mathe-Fix.

The Speak &amp; Math was very minutely redesigned in 1986, under the same name, with the new version representing nothing more substantial than a redesign of the faceplate graphics. In 1990 the Super Speak &amp; Math was released as a major redesign similar to the first version of the Super Speak &amp; Spell. As with the Super Speak &amp; Spell, the display screen of the Super Speak &amp; Math was changed to an LCD screen instead of the former VFD screen. The keyboard was also expanded and given more functions. The general structure of the console was also altered similarly to the Super Speak &amp; Spell such that the handle which had come at the top of the screen in prior Speak &amp; Math units was now found on the bottom of the toy and ergonomic features were added to the shape.

=== Other Solid State Speech products ===
Texas Instruments&#x27; Solid State Speech technology found its way into a number of other titles also related to the Speak &amp; Spell line. Examples include:
* Speak &amp; Learn Magic Wand – A work-booklet-based electronic game featuring the use of infra-red barcode reader technology.
* Speak &amp; Music – A musical audio game allowing free-form and memory-based (rhythm memory, eidetic musical memory, etc.) gameplay.
* Ready... Set... Read! – Considered the spiritual successor to the Speak &amp; Read line.
* Magic Reading Desk – Considered the spiritual successor to the Ready... Set... Read! and Speak &amp; Read lines.
* Little Maestro – A musical audio game aimed at younger children than the Speak &amp; Music.

=== Other games ===
A number of TI&#x27;s other game lines produced during the period when it was producing Speak &amp; Spell games bore similar logically conjunctive titles and employed similar technology although they did not involve the use of Solid State Speech technology. Such games included:
* Touch &amp; Tell – A 1978 educational game aimed at children of ages 2 to 5 employing a position-sensitive keyboard. A synthesized voice asked children questions and kids touch the answers on the keyboard.
** Teddy Touch &amp; Tell – The next generation of the Touch &amp; Tell game, Teddy Touch &amp; Tell is shaped like a bear and educates children on the topics of the alphabet, numbers, colors, animals, and music.
* Touch &amp; Discover – An educational game employing a position-sensitive membrane matrix keyboard. The Touch &amp; Discover is considered the precursor to the Super Speak &amp; Read. Disney licensed their characters to Texas Instruments for this toy, and Touch &amp; Discover employed the &quot;first-ever&quot; synthesized voices of Disney characters.
** Touch &amp; Discover School Edition – The next generation of the Touch &amp; Discover console, the Touch &amp; Discover School Edition is aimed at a slightly older audience.
* Touch &amp; Talkies – A dedicated handheld series, there were four versions of Touch &amp; Talkies all aimed at very young players.
* Listen &amp; Learn – The first electronic, educational toys to be marketed to infants, the Listen &amp; Learn toys were a series of three themed, electronic toys aimed at children of between 6 and 36 months. These toys were dodecahedron (12-sided) ball-shaped, were motion and directionally sensitive. The toy reacted to which side landed on top when rolled and produced a sound corresponding to the picture on top.

<text>Smax is a fictional character from the comic book series &quot;Top 10&quot; written by Alan Moore, illustrated by Gene Ha, and originally published by the now defunct America&#x27;s Best Comics imprint of DC Comics. A &quot;Top-10&quot; spin-off mini-series also called &quot;Smax&quot; focused on the character and provided him with more of a backstory.

==Character history and description==
Jeff Smax (born Jaafs Macksun) is a gigantic, blue-skinned, white-haired, super-powered, demi-ogre policeman who lives and works at Precinct 10, in a city populated by &quot;science heroes&quot;. Smax originally hailed from a land based on fantasy myths and fairy tale legends but had left after a horrifying failure during his career as a dragon slayer. Smax is both extremely strong and invulnerable to most forms of harm, including radiation. He is gruff and guarded amongst his peers, mostly due to the frequent loss of loved ones he has experienced in life (most notably his dear friend and late partner, Stochastic Fats). Though initially reluctant to become friendly with his new partner, Robyn Slinger AKA Toybox, he eventually bonds with her, even feeling a need to protect her. The pair are not romantically involved, however; Smax has an intimate relationship with his twin sister, Rexa. This is not an unusual situation in Smax&#x27;s home dimension, which has far different laws of physics and science. Rexa eventually comes to live with Smax; the details of their unique relationship is known to Robyn, who keeps it secret. Smax is fairly resourceful in the line of duty, but he has a quick temper and is not intellectually inclined, often not thinking things through. Smax has experience using weaponry, including his Singing Sword, but he most often prefers using his fists or his Strong Light energy (which emanates from his solar plexus). 

==Publishing history==
The &quot;Smax&quot; miniseries was written by Alan Moore, and penciled by Zander Cannon, who also inked the first issue. Andrew Currie inked the rest of the miniseries.

==Mini-series plot==
The story deals with Smax and Toybox returning, via magical teleportation, to Jeff&#x27;s magically enchanted home world. Smax, now a city dweller, seems embarrassed by his unsophisticated, sword-and-sorcery roots. They attend Smax&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s funeral where Jeff introduces Robyn as his wife, though no such relationship exists. At this point Jeff&#x27;s sister Rexa Macksun is introduced, dressed in the typical garb of a female fantasy barbarian such as Red Sonja and just as tall and physically impressive as her brother with the same blue skin and white hair. 

It is revealed Jeff has been away from home for some time, having originally left his world fleeing personal and literal demons. Once a great dragon slayer, a job needed to pay the bills for his adopted dwarven family, Smax failed to stop an extremely powerful, shape-shifting dragon named Morningbright from destroying a little girl. She was burned to ashes in front of him, forever leaving a white burn mark of a hand on his chest.

Further story developments reveal sexual tension between Smax and Rexa. The two were born of an unwilling union between a monster and a human warrior woman with magical strength. Despite this, the pressure of delivering twins kills her during childbirth, but her durability is passed on to her children. Their monstrous father abused them both and molested Rexa, who found love and solace in her brother&#x27;s arms. Smax eventually killed their father so they could escape together. Though in their medieval home world their relationship wasn&#x27;t particularly frowned upon, Smax developed conflicted feelings about the propriety of their love. For various reasons, Smax, Rexa, Robyn, and other heroes venture out to destroy Morningbright. Smax&#x27;s heroic efforts cause the mark on his chest to be removed.

The series was collected into a hardcover edition () in 2004 and in paperback () on November 2, 2005.

<text>Warrnambool (; Maar: &quot;Peetoop&quot; or &quot;Wheringkernitch&quot; or &quot;Warrnambool&quot;) is a city on the south-western coast of Victoria, Australia. At the 2021 census, Warrnambool had a population of 32,894. Situated on the Princes Highway, Warrnambool (Allansford) marks the western end of the Great Ocean Road and the southern end of the Hopkins Highway.

== History ==
===Origin of name===
The name &quot;Warrnambool&quot; originated from Mount Warrnambool, a scoria cone volcano 25 kilometres northeast of the town. Warrnambool (or Warrnoobul) was the title of both the volcano and the clan of Aboriginal Australian people who lived there. In the local language, the prefix Warnn- designated home or hut, while the meaning of the suffix -ambool is now unknown. William Fowler Pickering, the colonial government surveyor who in 1845 was tasked with the initial planning of the township, chose to name the town Warrnambool. The traditional Indigenous owners of the land today are the Dhauwurd Wurrung people, also known as the Gunditjmara.

===Aboriginal Australians===
Aboriginal Australians have been occupying the site of Warrnambool for at least the last 35,000 years. The vicinity around the Merri River was inhabited by people known as the Merrigundidj, part of the larger Gunditjmara nation. They spoke a language called Bi:gwurrung, which was a dialect of the Dhauwurd Wurrung language. These people constructed large stone and timber weirs called yereroc across various waterways in the region in order to facilitate the trapping of eels. The area at the mouth of the Hopkins River was known as Moyjil. At the beginning of British colonisation of the region in 1841, there were approximately 400 Aboriginal people living around the coastal parts of the Merri River including a number of Koroitgundidj people residing in a village at what is now known as Tower Hill. There are several Maar placenames for locations in the area including: &#x27;Kunang&#x27; referring to a waterhole on present-day Koroit Street which was a celebrated place for kangaroos to drink, &#x27;Wirkneung&#x27; referring to the site of Warrnambool cemetery, &#x27;Puurkar&#x27; referring to the Western Hill area of Warrnambool, and &#x27;Peetoop&#x27; which is one of the names for the area meaning &#x27;small sandpiper&#x27;.

===European maritime exploration===
A popular legend is that the first Europeans to visit the region were Cristóvão de Mendonça and his crew who surveyed the coastline nearby and were marooned near the site of the present town as early as the 16th century, based on the unverified reports of local whalers&#x27; discovery of the wreck of a mahogany ship. The ship&#x27;s provenance has been variously attributed to France, China, Spain and Portugal. There is no physical evidence to suggest that it ever existed.

The first documented European exploration of the area occurred under Lieutenant James Grant, a Scottish explorer who sailed the along the coast in December 1800 and named several features. This was followed by that of the English navigator Matthew Flinders in the , and the French explorer Nicholas Baudin, who recorded coastal landmarks, in 1802. The area was frequented by whalers early in the 19th century.

===British settlement===
British settlement of the land in the region began in 1838 when Captain Alexander Campbell, a whaler based at nearby Port Fairy, took possession of 4,000 acres around the mouth of the Merri River. He set up a farm there and built his main hut where Warrnambool now stands. The township was planned and surveyed in 1845, with the first allotments being sold in 1847. A Post Office opened on 1 January 1849.

During the Victorian Gold Rush, Warrnambool became an important port and grew quickly in the 1850s, benefiting from the private ownership of nearby Port Fairy. It was gazetted as a municipality in 1855, and became a borough in 1863. Warrnambool was declared a town in 1883, and a city in 1918. Post Offices opened at Warrnambool South in 1937 (closed 1973), Warrnambool East in 1946, and Warrnambool North in 1947 (closed 1975).

==Climate==

Warrnambool has a temperate Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;) that closely borders the Oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), and is characterised by mild, dry summers with frequent cold fronts and cool, rainy winters with moderate cloud cover. Annual and especially winter rainfall is much higher than in Melbourne due to being west of the Otway Ranges.

During the 2009 heatwave in southeastern Australia, Warrnambool recorded a maximum temperature of on 7 February 2009 at the airport site, while the highest minimum temperature was on 21 January 1900 at the post office. Summers can also get very cold on occasion, having dropped to on 11 January 1901 near the beach.
The airport is slightly north and inland of Warrnambool, featuring warmer days and cooler nights.

==Cityscape==
The original City of Warrnambool was a 4x8 grid, with boundaries of Lava Street (north), Japan Street (east), Merri Street (south) and Henna Street (west). In the nineteenth century, it was intended that Fairy Street – with its proximity to the Warrnambool Railway Station – would be the main street of Warrnambool. However, Liebig Street has since become the main street of the central business district (CBD). The Warrnambool CBD is particularly notable for its number of roundabouts.
Outside the CBD, the Warrnambool Botanic Gardens feature wide curving paths, rare trees, a lily pond with ducks, a fernery, a band rotunda, and was designed by notable landscape architect, William Guilfoyle.

Eleven suburbs surround the CBD of Warrnambool: North, South, East and West Warrnambool, Brierly, Sherwood Park, Merrivale, Dennington, Woodford, Bushfield and Allansford, though only the four latter are recognised as localities of the city.

==Culture==

Wunta Fiesta, a festival held in Warrnambool over the first weekend of February annually, is one of south-west Victoria&#x27;s major community festivals. It incorporates a wide range of entertainment (mostly music) for all ages.

The Flagstaff Hill Maritime Museum is in Warrnambool built on Flagstaff Hill that also holds the original lighthouses and Warrnambool Garrison. Its most prized item in its collection is the Minton peacock salvaged from the &quot;Loch Ard&quot;.
Flagstaff Hill Maritime Village is built around the original lighthouses and now operates as a heritage attraction and museum of shipwreck and maritime trade artefacts.

The Lady Bay Lighthouse complex is on the Victorian heritage register due to its significance as an example of early colonial development. There has been a flagstaff on top of Flagstaff Hill since 1848, and the current lighthouses were moved to the site in 1878. They still operate as navigation aids for the channel into Warrnambool harbour.

The Warrnambool foreshore is a popular swimming area, and is adjacent to the Lake Pertobe parklands. A number of caravan parks are also located in the area.

Baritone Robert Nicholson recorded the song &quot;Back to Warrnambool&quot; in 1924.

Warrnambool is the setting and filming location of the 2015 film &quot;Oddball&quot;, starring Shane Jacobson.
Warrnambool&#x27;s Bathing History

Warrnambool has a rich history when it comes to outdoor bathing. The city has been a popular destination for beachgoers for 150 years, with the first public bathing area built in 1876 on the south end of Gilles Street, and was later moved to the current location with the advent of the railway. The sea baths were filled with water drawn from Lady Bay, initially by windmill and later by gas pump.

Over the years, Warrnambool&#x27; s outdoor bathing facilities evolved, with the introduction of new amenities and features. In 1881, the sought after Hot Sea Baths opened, and people travelled to Warrnambool to receive the benefits of bathing - noting their &#x27;wonderful creative powers&#x27;, and their being a &#x27;tonic for the feeble&#x27;. 

Today, Warrnambool continues to be a popular destination for bathing, with world class facilities available for locals and tourists alike. The Deep Blue Hot Springs offer two bathing experiences and, although no longer using salt water drawn from the sea, their Indoor Bath House and Outdoor Bathing Sanctuary offers naturally warm geothermal water, drawn from the Dilwyn Aquifer, below the earth&#x27;s surface. 

===Media===
Warrnambool is served by one daily newspaper, &quot;The Standard&quot;, which is owned by Australian Community Media. The local commercial radio stations are 94.5 3YB and 95.3 Coast FM, both owned by Ace Radio. There is also a community radio channel, 3WAY FM. The ABC also owns a radio station, ABC South West Victoria, which is based in Warrnambool.

Warrnambool is also served by local transmission of free-to-air television networks ABC, SBS, Seven, Southern Cross and WIN.

Out of those networks, WIN Television produces the only local television news bulletin, WIN News, which uses resources from their Ballarat and Warrnambool newsrooms.

===Sport===
Warrnambool is home to the Grand Annual Sprintcar Classic, a race which attracts Australian and international drivers on the Australia Day long weekend, especially because of its position in the motorsport calendar.

The city is also the finishing point of the Melbourne to Warrnambool Classic cycle race. It is the longest one-day bicycle endurance race in the world, held every October since 1895 to be the world&#x27;s second oldest bike race.

Warrnambool has a horse racing club, the Warrnambool Racing Club, which schedules around twenty race meetings a year including the Warrnambool Cup and Grand Annual Steeple three-day meeting in the first week of May. The Woodford Racing Club also holds one meeting at Warrnambool racecourse. The Grand Annual steeplechase has 33 jumps, more than any other horse race and is one of the longest steeplechases in the world.

The Warrnambool Greyhound Racing Club holds regular greyhound racing meetings on most Mondays and Thursdays. The Greyhound version of the Warrnambool Cup is held on the first Wednesday of May. The club also holds the Seaside Festival over the Christmas and New Year period providing great entertainment and value for money for both kids and kids at heart. The club is located centrally in the Warrnambool Showgrounds Precinct on Koroit Street and opened on 27 July 1978.

Warrnambool is home to the Premier Speedway, a dirt track oval speedway located approximately 5 km east of the town. As well as hosting various Victorian state championships, Premier Speedway has hosted Australian championships for Sprintcars, Super Sedans and Street Stocks. Premier Speedway has also regularly hosted rounds of the World Series Sprintcars, being one of only five tracks to host a round of every series run since its inception in 1987. Since 1973 the speedway has been home to the Grand Annual Sprintcar Classic, the biggest single sprint car racing meeting in Australia, and on occasion has outdrawn the famed Knoxville Nationals in the United States for number of competitors entered, as better known drivers enter both races. The Classic is traditionally run the weekend before the national title meeting. The speedway has hosted the Classic / Australian Championship double on six occasions - 1979, 1986, 1994, 1999, 2003 and 2011, with Sydney&#x27;s 10 time Australian Champion Garry Rush the only driver to win the double at Warrnambool in 1986 when he won his 6th Classic and a week later his 7th national title.

Gunditjmara Bulls and North Warrnambool Warriors play rugby league in NRL Victoria.

From 1 to 3 September 2008, the city hosted, along with Melbourne, the 2008 Australian Football International Cup, featuring 14 nations from around the world playing Australian rules football. The sport is highly popular in Warrnambool which has a competitive local league and is the origin of many high-profile AFL players. The city has three Australian Rules football teams playing in the Hampden Football League (North Warrnambool, South Warrnambool and Warrnambool), and many more in the Warrnambool District Football League

Golfers play either on the 18 hole course at the Warrnambool Golf Club a public access course ranked in Australia&#x27;s top 100 courses, or at the 9 hole course at the Deakin University Warrnambool campus.

== Economy ==
Warrnambool attracts many visitors each year, and is a comprehensive regional service centre. The town&#x27;s tourism benefits from the views from the Great Ocean Road, and its nearby beaches, some of which are used for surfing. In the winter months, Southern Right whales can be seen in the waters near the city at the Logan&#x27;s Beach nursery, and boats make whale-watching tours.

The mainstay of the economy is agriculture and its support industry – particularly dairy farming and associated milk processing. Other major industries and services include retail, education, health, meat processing, clothing manufacture and construction. The Fletcher Jones and Staff Pty Ltd clothing factory opened in 1948 and was closed in 2005.

==Demographics==

15.1% of Warrnambool residents were born outside Australia, which is significantly less than the Australian average of 33.1%. 89.1% speak only English at home and 2.0% are Indigenous.

==Governance==

The Local Government is the Warrnambool City Council.

At the state level, Warrnambool was within the electoral district of Warrnambool until it was abolished in 2002. Since then, Warrnambool has been in the South-West Coast electorate. This was held by former Premier Denis Napthine of the Liberal Party until his retirement in 2015, the resulting by-election electing Roma Britnell, also of the Liberal Party.

At the federal level, Warrnambool is the largest town in the division of Wannon, which has been a safe Liberal seat since 1955. However, Warrnambool booths typically receive a much stronger Labor vote than the rural areas that surround it. The seat was held by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser for 28 years, before being held by former Speaker of the lower house David Hawker for 27 years.

== Environment ==

Logan&#x27;s Beach on the eastern side of the city is recognised as a nursery site for the southern right whale &quot;Eubalaena australis&quot;, and many tourists have been attracted to opportunities for land-based observations. Most years one, two or three adult female whales arrive between late May and August, giving birth within days of their arrival. The young whale calf is then reared at the site, usually departing with its parent by mid to late September. Besides the southern right whale, the coastline is also visited by Australian fur seals, little penguins and common dolphins. During the winter and early spring albatross cruise along the coastline and can be sighted from Thunder Point, a popular coastal lookout in the town.

Middle Island has a colony of Australian little penguins (&quot;Eudyptula novaehollandiae&quot;). Fox predation reduced numbers significantly. In 2005 only four penguins were remaining in the colony. Warrnambool City Council introduced a world first program using Maremma dogs to guard the penguins. This program has supported the re-establishment of a colony of over one hundred penguins in 2009. By 2015 the population had reached almost two-hundred. The film &quot;Oddball&quot; is a dramatisation of the dogs saving the penguins.

<text>The Ordovīcēs (Common Brittonic: *&quot;Ordowīces&quot;) were one of the Celtic tribes living in Great Britain before the Roman invasion. Their tribal lands were located in present-day North Wales and England, between the Silures to the south and the Deceangli to the north-east. Unlike the latter tribes that appear to have acquiesced to Roman rule with little resistance, the Ordovices fiercely resisted the Romans. They were eventually subjugated by the Roman governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in the campaign of 77–78CE when the Romans overran their final strongholds on Anglesey.

==Etymology==
The Celtic name hammer fighters, cognate with the words for &#x27;hammer&#x27;: , (with a prothetic &quot;g-&quot;) and (with a prothetic &quot;h-&quot;) and - to fight (cf. Lemovices, Eburovices). John Edward Lloyd suggested that the name of this tribe is preserved as the element &quot;-orwig&quot;, &quot;-orweg&quot; in the place name Dinas Dinorwig (&quot;Fort of the Ordovices&quot;) in North Wales, though Melville Richards rejected the idea.

===Geology===
In 1879 the pioneering English geologist Charles Lapworth named the Ordovician geological period after the Ordovices because the rocks he was studying were found in the tribe&#x27;s former territories in North Wales.

==Territory==
South of the Brigantes, the geographer Ptolemy reported three tribes whose territories stretched from the Irish Sea to the North Sea. The Ordovices occupied the westward lands and had two noteworthy cities, Branogenium which was located 195 Roman miles from London, most likely at Leintwardine, and Mediolanum which was located 200 Roman miles from London. Neither has been conclusively located. The boundaries of the tribal territory are also unknown; they have been taken to extend through modern Powys into what is now the English Midlands, or alternatively to be limited to the land north of the rivers Dyfi and Dee.

==History== 
They were among the British tribes that resisted the Roman invasion. The initial resistance was mainly organised by the Celtic leader Caratacus, exiled in their lands after the defeat of his tribe in the Battle of the Medway. Caratacus became a warlord of the Ordovices and neighbouring Silures, and was declared a Roman public enemy in the 50s AD. In Caratacus&#x27; last battle, governor Publius Ostorius Scapula defeated Caratacus and sent him to Rome as a prisoner.

In the 70s, the Ordovices rebelled against Roman occupation and destroyed a cavalry squadron. This act of war provoked a strong response from governor Agricola. According to Tacitus, &quot;He collected a force of veterans and a small body of auxiliaries; then as the Ordovices would not venture to descend into the plain, he put himself in front of the ranks to inspire all with the same courage against a common danger, and led his troops up a hill. The tribe was all but exterminated.&quot; Agricola went on rapidly to conquer Anglesey. The location of this battle is unknown but the hill-fort Dinas Dinorwig encloses a hectare of land about 3 km from the Menai Strait.

<text>Kālacakra () is a polysemic term in Vajrayana Buddhism as well as Hinduism that means &quot;wheel of time&quot; or &quot;time cycles&quot;. &quot;Kālacakra&quot; is also the name of a series of Buddhist texts and a major practice lineage in Indian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism. The tantra is considered to belong to the unexcelled yoga (&quot;anuttara-yoga&quot;) class.

Kālacakra also refers both to a patron tantric deity or yidam in Vajrayana and to the philosophies and yogas of the Kālacakra tradition. The tradition&#x27;s origins are in India and its most active later history and presence has been in Tibet. The tradition contains teachings on cosmology, theology, philosophy, sociology, soteriology, myth, prophecy, medicine and yoga. It depicts a mythic reality whereby cosmic and socio-historical events correspond to processes in the bodies of individuals. These teachings are meant to lead to a transformation of one&#x27;s body and mind into perfect Buddhahood through various yogic methods.

The Kālacakra tradition is based on Mahayana Buddhist non-dualism, which is strongly influenced by Madhyamaka philosophy, but also draws on a wide range of Buddhist and non-Buddhist (mainly Hindu) traditions (such as Vaibhāṣika, Kashmir Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Samkhya). The Kālacakra tradition holds that Kālacakra teachings were taught in India by Gautama Buddha himself. According to modern Buddhist studies, the original Sanskrit texts of the Kālacakra tradition &quot;originated during the early decades of the 11th century CE, and we know with certainty that the &quot;Śrī Kālacakra&quot; and the &quot;Vimalaprabhā&quot; commentary were completed between 1025 and 1040 CE.&quot; Kālacakra remains an active tradition of Buddhist tantra in Tibetan Buddhism, particularly within the Jonang tradition, and its teachings and initiations have been offered to large public audiences, most famously by the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso.

== Sources ==
The &quot;Kālacakra Tantra&quot; is more properly called the &quot;Laghu-kālacakratantra-rāja&quot; (&quot;Sovereign Abridged Kālacakra&quot;) and is said to be an abridged form of an original text, the &quot;Paramādibuddhatantra&quot; of the Shambala king Sucandra, which is no longer extant. The author of the abridged tantra is said to have been the Shambala king Manjushriyasas. According to Vesna Wallace, the &quot;Vimalaprabhā&quot; (Stainless Light) of Pundarika is &quot;the most authoritative commentary on the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; and served as the basis for all subsequent commentarial literature of that literary corpus.&quot;

=== Sanskrit texts ===
The Sanskrit text of the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; was first published by Raghu Vira and Lokesh Chandra in 1966, with a Mongolian text in volume 2. This 1966 edition was based on manuscripts from the British Library and the Bir Library, Kathmandu. A critical edition of the original Sanskrit text of the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; was published by Biswanath Banerjee in 1985 based on manuscripts from Cambridge, London and Patna.

A further planned volume by Banerjee containing the &quot;Vimalaprabhā&quot; appears not to have been published. The Sanskrit texts of the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; and the &quot;Vimalaprabhā&quot; commentary were published on the basis of newly discovered manuscripts from Nepal (5) and India (1) by Jagannatha Upadhyaya (with Vrajavallabh Dwivedi and S. S. Bahulkar, 3 vols., 1986–1994). In 2010, Lokesh Chandra published a facsimile of one of the manuscripts that was not used by Jagannatha Upadhyaya et al. in their edition.

=== Tibetan translations ===
The Tibetan translation of the commentary &quot;Vimalaprabhā&quot; is usually studied from the 1733 Derge Kangyur edition of the Tibetan canon, vol. 40, text no. 1347. This was published by Dharma Publishing, Berkeley, US, in 1981.

David Reigle noted, in a discussion in the INDOLOGY forum of 11 April 2020, that, &quot;the Tibetan translation of the &quot;Kālacakra-tantra&quot; made by Somanātha and &#x27;Bro lotsawa as revised by Shong ston is found in the Lithang, Narthang, Der-ge, Co-ne, Urga, and Lhasa blockprint recensions of the Kangyur, and also in a recension with annotations by Bu ston. This Shong revision was then further revised by the two Jonang translators Blo gros rgyal mtshan and Blo gros dpal bzang po. The Jonang revision is found in the Yunglo and Peking blockprint recensions of the Kangyur, and also in a recension with annotations by Phyogs las rnam rgyal.&quot;

== Main topics ==
The &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; is divided into five chapters. The content of the five chapters is as follows:
* The first chapter deals with what is called the &quot;outer Kālacakra&quot; (the world system, &quot;loka-dhatu&quot;), which provides a cosmology based on Vaibhasika Abhidharma, Samkhya, the Puranas and Jain cosmology. The Kālacakra calendar, the birth and death of universes, our solar system and the workings of the elements are expounded. The myth and prophecy of the kingdom of Shambhala is also discussed.
* The second chapter deals with &quot;inner Kālacakra,&quot; which concerns human gestation and birth, the functions within the human body&quot;,&quot; and the subtle body aspects, mainly the channels, winds, drops and so forth. Human experience is described by four mind states: waking, dream, deep sleep, and a fourth state which is available through the energies of sexual orgasm. The potentials (drops, bindus) which give rise to these states are described, together with the processes that flow from them.
* The third chapter deals with the requirements and preparation for meditation, mainly, the initiations (&quot;abhiseka&quot;) of Kālacakra.
* The fourth chapter explains the sadhana and yoga (spiritual practices), both the meditation on the mandala and its deities in the generation stage, and the perfection stage practices of the &quot;six yogas&quot;.
* The fifth chapter describes the state of gnosis (&quot;jñāna&quot;), which is the result or fruit of the practice.

=== Cosmology ===

In the &quot;Kālacakratantra&#x27;s&quot; cosmology, &quot;samsara&quot; (cyclic existence) is made up of innumerable Buddha fields and of the five elements or properties (characterized by origination, duration and destruction). The whole cosmos arises due to the collective karma of sentient beings, which produces vital winds (&quot;vayu&quot;) that mold and dissolve the atomic particles that make up the various inanimate things of the world and the bodies of sentient beings.

A key element of the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; is the correspondence between macrocosmic processes and microcosmic processes. The &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; maps the various features and developmental processes of the world system to various features of the human body. The phrase &quot;as it is outside, so it is within the body&quot; (&quot;yatha bahye tatha dehe&quot;) is often found in the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; to emphasize the similarities and correspondence between human beings (&quot;inner Kālacakra&quot;) and the cosmos (&quot;outer Kālacakra&quot;), as well as with the enlightened Kālacakra mandala of deities (&quot;alternative&quot; &quot;Kālacakra&quot;). This correspondence comes about because both the cosmos and the bodies of sentient beings come into existence due to the efficacy of the habitual propensities of the minds of beings. In this sense, the cosmos is like a cosmic replica of a sentient being&#x27;s body. Thus, one can say that the cosmos and the individual are nondual and mutually pervasive, even in terms of their conventional existence. They are interconnected and they influence each other.

The basic reason for this exposition is that a proper understanding of conventional reality provides a basis for understanding ultimate reality. Regarding ultimate reality, Wallace further notes, In terms of ultimate reality, the cosmos and the individual are also of the same nature, the nature of gnosis (&quot;jñāna&quot;), which manifests in the form of emptiness (&quot;sunyata-bimba&quot;). Those who are free of the afflictive and cognitive obscurations nondually perceive the world as the form of emptiness in a nondual manner; that is, they perceive the world as an inseparable unity of form and emptiness. On the other hand, ordinary sentient beings, whose perception is influenced by the afflictive and cognitive obscurations, see the world in a dual fashion, as something other than themselves. They see the world as an ordinary place inhabited by ordinary sentient beings. But in reality, the entire cosmos, with Meru in its center, is a cosmic body of the Jina, a cosmic image or reflection (&quot;pratima&quot;) of the Buddha, having the nature of form. As such, it is similar to the Nirmanakaya of the Buddha. Therefore, according to this tantric system, one should attend to this cosmic image of the Buddha, as one attends to the statue of the Buddha, created for the sake of worship.The tantra&#x27;s section on cosmology also includes an exposition of Indian astrology. In Tibet, the Kālacakra text is also the basis of Tibetan astrological calendars.

Wallace also adds that this cosmological system based on the three Kālacakras is mainly seen by the Kālacakra literature &quot;as a heuristic model for meditative purposes&quot;. According to Wallace, all the different paradigms outlined in the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; are contemplative models which &quot;serve as devices for furthering one&#x27;s understanding of the interconnectedness of all phenomena and for training the mind to perceive the world in a nondual fashion&quot; and thus by using them one can &quot;diminish the habitual propensities of an ordinary, dualistic mind.&quot;

This view of interconnectedness is also applied among all human beings and all sentient beings and contains methods to train the mind so as to perceive all sentient beings as nondual from oneself. According to Wallace, the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; states that &quot;one should look at the triple world as similar to space and as unitary.&quot; The tantra also states that &quot;all six states of transmigratory existence are already present within every individual,&quot; and this is related to the doctrine of the three gunas.

=== Time and cycles ===
The &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; revolves around the concept of time (&quot;kāla&quot;) and cycles or wheels (&quot;chakra&quot;). Conventionally speaking, this refers to the cycles of the planets, to the cycles of human breathing and subtle energies in the body. Regarding the outer or external aspect of conventional reality, the wheel of time refers to the passage of days, month, and years (as well as the cycles of the zodiac) while with regard to the individual or inner aspect, it refers to &quot;the circulation of pranas [vital airs] within the wheel of the nadis [subtle channels] in the body,&quot; which is linked with the 12 aspects of dependent origination and the 12 signs of the zodiac. These different cycles are interconnected and correspond to each other.

In the first chapter, it is stated that the world emerges from emptiness and the force of time, which is a kind of power that originates the universe:Because of time (&quot;kalat&quot;), from the voids (&quot;sunyesu&quot;), originate wind, fire, water, the earth; the continents, mountains, and oceans; the constellations, the sun, the moon, the host of star-planets, and the sages; gods, bhutas, and nagas; animals that have four types of birthplace; humans and hell beings also, on the manifold earth and below -originate in the middle of void (&quot;sunyamadhye&quot;), like salt in water, and the egg-born in the middle of an egg.&quot;Chakra&quot;, in turn, refers to the universe and all things in it (i.e. the five aggregates, constituents and bases of the world), which exist as cyclical patterns powered by time. Kāla is also said to be knowledge (&quot;jñana&quot;) and chakra is the knowable (&quot;jneya&quot;). In the universal sense then, the term &quot;Kālacakra&quot; is all-inclusive and refers to the unity of the basis of reality and reality itself.

According to Wallace, from the point of view of ultimate reality, &quot;Kālacakra&quot; refers to, the nonduality of two facets of a single reality—namely, wisdom (&quot;prajña&quot;), or emptiness (&quot;sunyata&quot;), and method (&quot;upaya&quot;), or compassion (&quot;karuna&quot;). The word &quot;time&quot; refers to the gnosis of imperishable bliss (&quot;aksara-sukha-jñana&quot;), which is a method consisting of compassion; and the word &quot;wheel&quot; designates wisdom consisting of emptiness. Their unity is the Buddha Kālacakra.Thus, Kālacakra refers to the manifestations of cyclic existence and nirvana, as well as its causes. Kālacakra therefore represents a single unified reality (also called Adibuddha, Sahajakaya, Jñanakaya, Sahajananda and Vajrayoga). When this reality manifests itself as numerous phenomena, it is called samsara. Vesna Wallace notes how the idea of time as a universal creative reality has precursors in Vedic literature and in the Upanishads and that it is likely that they inspired the &quot;Kālacakratantra&#x27;s&quot; theory of the wheel of time.

However, the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; is clear that Kālacakra is itself empty of inherent existence (i.e. essence) and is not an independent phenomenon, but one which is dependent on conditions (a classic Madhyamaka position). As Wallace notes, the cosmic body and the body of the individual is made up of various cycles of dependent origination. Furthermore, &quot;each cycle of dependent origination, which comprises progressively smaller cycles of dependent origination, arises in dependence upon other cycles of dependent origination and is therefore itself empty of inherent existence.&quot;

=== View ===
The philosophical view of the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; is undoubtedly that of the Mahayana Buddhist Madhyamaka school, and the text attempts to refute all other Buddhist and non-Buddhist systems. As noted by Wallace, the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; holds that &quot;only Madhyamikas who assert the nonduality of compassion and emptiness avoid philosophical failure.&quot;

The &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; summarizes its fundamental doctrines in the following passage:Identitylessness, the maturation of karma, the three realms, the six states of existence, the origination due to the twelve-limbed dependence, the Four Truths, the eighteen unique qualities of the Buddha, the five psycho-physical aggregates, the three bodies and the Sahajakaya, and animate emptiness. The system in which these are taught is the clear and definite instruction of the Vajri.According to Vesna Wallace, the Kālacakra tradition has a unique interpretation of emptiness which is not just a mere negation of inherent existence (&quot;svabhava&quot;), but also refers to &quot;the absence of material constituents of the individual&#x27;s body and mind.&quot; This &quot;aspect of emptiness&quot; (&quot;sunyatakara&quot;), or &quot;form of emptiness&quot; (&quot;sunyata-bimba&quot;), is, according to Wallace: a form that is empty of both inherent existence and physical particles. It is a form that is endowed with all the signs and symbols of the Buddha. That form of emptiness, also known as the &quot;empty form,&quot; is also regarded as the &quot;animate emptiness&quot; (&quot;ajada-sunyata&quot;). Due to being animate, this emptiness is the cause of supreme and immutable bliss (&quot;paramacala-sukha&quot;). The non-duality of the cause and effect is the essential teaching of this tantra.

The unique Kālacakra path and goal is based on this view. Its goal is: 
the transformation of one&#x27;s own gross physical body into a luminous form devoid of both gross matter and the subtle body of pranas. The transformation of one&#x27;s own mind into the enlightened mind of immutable bliss occurs in direct dependence upon that material transformation. The actualization of that transformation is believed to be perfect and full Buddhahood in the form of Kālacakra, the Supreme Primordial Buddha (&quot;paramadi-buddha&quot;), who is the omniscient, innate Lord of the Jinas, the true nature of one&#x27;s own mind and body.

The supreme imperishable bliss is also defined as peace (&quot;santa&quot;), and pervades the bodies of sentient beings and the entire world. For beings who are in samsara, this blissful Buddha-mind also manifests as sexual bliss, during which the mind becomes free of concepts and non-dual for a brief moment. Thus, the Kālacakra tradition stresses the importance of not avoiding sexual bliss, but using it on the path, since it is a kind of facsimile of the realization of emptiness and it produces mental joy. It also stresses the importance of retaining one&#x27;s semen during sexual union, as well as the importance of proper motivation and not-grasping at blissful states.

The goal of Kālacakra is also described as access to gnosis or knowledge (jñana, also called &quot;vajra-yoga&quot;, &quot;prajñaparamita&quot;, &quot;vidya&quot; &quot;spiritual knowledge&quot; and &quot;Mahamudra&quot;) which is defined as &quot;the mind of immutable bliss,&quot; and the union of wisdom and method, or emptiness and compassion. Jñana is also the mind free of causal relations (&quot;niranvaya&quot;) and empty of inherent existence. The &quot;Adibuddhatantra&quot; (i.e. the root &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot;) describes jñana as follows:
It has passed beyond [the designations:] &quot;It exists&quot; and &quot;It does not exist.&quot; It is the cessation of existence and non-existence. It is nondual. It is the &quot;vajra-yoga&quot; that is non-differentiated from emptiness and compassion. It is the supreme bliss. It has transcended the reality of atoms. It is devoid of empty dharmas. It is free of eternity and annihilation. It is the vajra yoga that is without causal relations. Wallace 2001, p. 150.

Jñana is a pure radiant mind, devoid of any impurities of habitual tendencies (&quot;vasana&quot;). It has no form and is devoid of atomic particles and is beyond subject and object. It is free of conceptualizations, and is a self-aware (&quot;svasamvedana&quot;) natural luminosity which is partless and all-pervasive. Jñana is Buddhahood, the ultimate reality or thusness (&quot;tathata&quot;). It is the Dharmadhatu, which is the primordially unoriginated beginning (&quot;adi&quot;) or atemporal source (&quot;yoni&quot;) of all phenomena. Jñana is also beyond all classifications and transcends samsara and nirvana (though it appears/manifests as both). Since it is non-dual with emptiness, it is empty of inherent existence.

Jñana also manifests as bodies, including the four bodies of the Buddha (the Sahajakaya, Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya) and the bodies of sentient beings (each one of which are said to contain the four Buddha bodies in unmanifest forms). According to the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot;, enlightened awareness is innately present in an ordinary individual&#x27;s body:
Just as space does not disappear [from a jar] when water is poured into the jar, in the same way, the sky-vajri, who is the pervader of the universe and devoid of sense-objects, is within the body.

However, even though all beings have this enlightened awareness, it is not actualized if one does not ascertain it and this entails the absence of mental afflictions or impurities which block recognition of enlightened awareness. These mental afflictions are also closely connected to the pranas or vital winds (which are said to cause and sustain the afflictions) and thus to an individual&#x27;s psycho-physical constitution. Thus, awakening comes about through the purification of the pranas.

=== Deity and the Adibuddha ===
&quot;Kālacakra&quot; also refers to a specific deity who appears as a fierce multi-armed blue deity in sexual union (&quot;yab-yum&quot;) with a consort called Visvamata (or Kālacakri). The &quot;Kālacakratantra&#x27;s&quot; first chapter introduces the deity as follows:Homage to &quot;Kālacakra&quot;, who has as his content emptiness and compassion, without origination or annihilation of the three existences, who is regarding a consistent embodiment of knowledge and objects of knowledge as non-existence.The Kālacakra deities represent the aspects of Buddhahood: the non-dual (&quot;advaya&quot;) union of compassion and emptiness, the union of prajña and upaya, as well as the mahasukha (great bliss) of enlightenment. Since Kālacakra &quot;is&quot; time and everything is the flow of time, Kālacakra knows all. Kālacakri, his spiritual consort and complement, is aware of everything that is timeless, not time-bound or out of the realm of time. The two deities are thus temporality and atemporality conjoined. Similarly, the wheel or circle (chakra) is without beginning or end (representing timelessness), thus the term Kāla-cakra includes what is timeless and time itself. 
One of the key topics of the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; is the Adibuddha (Primordial Buddha or First Buddha). Regarding the Adibuddha, the tantra states:To the one embraced by the Bhagavati Prajña, the one who is aspectless although possessing aspect; to the one who has the bliss of the unchanging and who has abandoned the pleasures of laughter and so forth; to the progenitor of the Buddhas, without origination and annihilation, possessing the three bodies, rightly knowing the three times – the omniscient Bhagavan Paramadhibuddha, I worship that very non-duality.Vesna Wallace notes that in this tantra, the Adibuddha is spoken of in two distinct ways. The first one is the idea that there is a being who was &quot;the first to obtain Buddhahood by means of the imperishable bliss characterized by perfect awakening in a single moment.&quot; The &quot;Kālacakra&quot; literature also refers to an Adibuddha who has been awakened since beginningless time, &quot;without beginning or end&quot;. According to Wallace, this refers to &quot;the innate gnosis that pervades the minds of all sentient beings and stands as the basis of both samsara and nirvana.&quot;

Similarly, there is an ambiguity in the way the deity Kālacakra is explained in the tantra. According to Hammar, sometimes Kālacakra refers to the Adibuddha (which is uncreated, beyond time, eternal, the origin of the world, omniscient, non-dual and beyond causality), while sometimes the name Kālacakra refers specifically to the male figure in union with Visvamata. Regarding the difficult and complex term Adibuddha, Hammar concludes that one can see it as one way of describing Buddha-nature, &quot;which means that there is a Buddha-seed in human beings which is always there.&quot; It can also be another way of describing sunyata (emptiness), which is also present everywhere.

Some passages of the tantra also mention Sakyamuni Buddha. They note how he transformed himself into Kālacakra when he taught the tantra to Sucandra, the king of Shambala. Some passages from the tantra also equate Sakyamuni with Adibuddha.

=== Mandala ===

The Kālacakra deity and his consort reside in the center of the Kālacakra mandala in a palace consisting of four mandalas, one within the other: the mandalas of body, speech, and mind, and in the very center, wisdom and great bliss.

The deities of the mandala are classified into various sets of families or clans (&quot;kula&quot;) as follows:

* Three families representing body, speech, and mind; the left, right, and central channels; to the realms of desire, form, and formlessness and to the three bodies of the Buddha. 
* The four families corresponds to uterine blood, semen, mind, and gnosis; to body, speech, mind, and gnosis; to the four drops (bindu); to the four states of the mind—namely, waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and the fourth state; to the sun, moon, Rahu, and Agni (Ketu), and in terms of society, they are the four castes. 
* The five families are the five psycho-physical aggregates (skandha), and in terms of society, they are the four castes and the outcastes. With regard to ultimate reality, they are the five types of the Buddha&#x27;s gnosis manifesting as the five Buddhas—Aksobhya, Vairocana, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, and Amoghasiddhi.
* The six families are the five psycho-physical aggregates and their emptiness; and in terms of society, they are the four castes and the classes of Dombas and Candalas. With regard to ultimate reality, the six families are the five aforementioned Buddhas and the Svabhavikakaya.

=== Socio-political teaching ===

The &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; contains various ideas about society, the individual&#x27;s place in society and how they are interrelated. These provide a sociological theory which forms the framework for the &quot;Kālacakratantra&#x27;s&quot; ideas on history, prophecy and soteriology. The Kālacakra system is unique in that it is the only Buddhist tantra that explores these social and caste issues at length.

Like earlier Buddhist texts and traditions, the Kālacakra literature is sharply critical of traditional Indian caste divisions and Brahmanical views of the hierarchy and status of the castes as being divinely ordained and as having inherent moral qualities. Indian Buddhists replaced this model with the idea that all humans are roughly equal and that caste divisions are mere conventional designations. The &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; adopts these views and also interprets them through a tantric lens. In the Kālacakra system, all people are equal since they are all empty of inherent existence, are all part of the same non-dual reality, i.e. Kālacakra and thus all have the potential for Buddhahood.

The Kālacakra tradition saw attachment to caste and family as spiritual blocks and Kālacakra texts warn against social discrimination, which is based on this attachment and has negative effects on one&#x27;s practice of the path. Indeed, Kālacakra texts often see the absence of attachment to social status as a prerequisite for receiving tantric teachings. Because of this, Kālacakra texts attempts to show the insubstantiality of social class and caste and thus to refute the basis for attachment to caste. According to Wallace, &quot;to demonstrate the untenability of social discrimination, the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; at times uses a type of analysis that is similar to the one frequently applied in Buddhist refutations of the independent existence of a personal identity.&quot;

The Kālacakra system also links the soteriological implications of social relationships to socio-political events. Negative events, such as the Muslim conquests of India and the decline of Buddhism in India, are linked to social segregation and divisions (based on corrupt Puranic teaching). Meanwhile, positive events such as the defeat of &quot;the barbarian Dharma&quot; (i.e. Islam) are linked with social and spiritual unification of all castes, outcastes and barbarians into one single vajra-family. Because the Vaisnava and Saiva Dharmas promote class prejudice (&quot;jati-vada&quot;), create a false sense of identity based on caste, and thus create social divisions, the Kālacakra tradition admonishes Buddhist practitioners not to admire or follow these Dharmas. The tradition also sees caste theory as being related to false theories of a self (atman), to linguistic prejudice (based around the belief in the superiority of Sanskrit) and to theories of a creator god.

Due to these concerns, the tantric pledges found in the Kālacakra system involve transgressions of Indian social conventions, such as associating with and being in physical contact with all the various social classes without distinction, and seeing them as equal. This was often acted out in tantric ritual feasts known as ganachakras, wherein everyone was considered part of one vajra-family. This practice of social equality was also not meant to be limited to ritual contexts, as seems to have been the case within Saiva tantra.

The Kālacakra system also explains how all of society is in a way also included within the microcosm of the individual&#x27;s body, which is a manifestation of the socio-religious body. Thus, the different types of persons and castes are mapped into the physical features of a person&#x27;s body and the elements which make up a sentient being (aggregates, sense faculties, etc.). According to Wallace, the interrelatedness and mutual pervasiveness of the various components of the individual&#x27;s mind and body represent the social and ethnic integration of a socially and ethnically mixed society.&quot;

Regarding the sociology of the &quot;Kālacakratantra,&quot; Wallace concludes:

the mutual relations and influences of the individual, the cosmos, and time parallel those in the society. Thus, the organization and functions of the different members of the social body are non-dual from the structure and functions of the different members of the bodies of the individual, the cosmos, and enlightened awareness...Just as the transformation and unification of the various components of one&#x27;s own mind and body on this tantric path transform one&#x27;s experience of one&#x27;s natural environment, so it transforms one&#x27;s experience of one&#x27;s social environment. Likewise, in this tantric tradition, the unification of all the phenomenal and ultimate aspects of the vajra-family, which abolishes all dualities, is nothing other than the state of self-knowing: the state of knowing oneself as the cosmos, society, individual, and enlightened awareness; and that self-knowledge is what is meant by omniscience (&quot;sarva-jnana&quot;) in the tradition of the &quot;Kālacakratantra.&quot; 

=== Shambhala kingdom and its holy war with the barbarians ===
The &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; contains passages that refer to a Buddhist kingdom called &quot;Shambhala&quot;, which is ruled by a line of thirty-two Buddhist kings that preserve the &quot;Kālacakra&quot; teachings. This kingdom is said to be located near Mount Kailasa and its capital is Kalāpa. It also mentions how this kingdom comes into conflict with invaders called &quot;mleccha&quot; (&quot;barbarians&quot;), which most scholars agree refers to Muslims and the Muslim invasions of India.

According to John Newman, the Buddhists who composed the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; likely borrowed the Hindu concept of Kalki and adapted the concept. They combined their idea of Shambhala with Kalki to reflect the theo-political situation they faced after the arrival of Islam in Central Asia and western Tibet. The text prophesies a war fought by a massive army of Buddhists and Hindus, led by King Raudra Kalkin, against the Muslim persecutors. Then after the victory of good over evil and attainment of religious freedom, Kalki ushers in a new era of peace and Sambhala will become a place of perfection. Further battles with the barbarians are described as well in later eras.

Urban Hammar notes that a passage from the tantra mentions a series of figures who are said to be in the service of demonic snakes. These figures are &quot;Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, &quot;The white-clad one&quot;, Muhammed, and Mathani.&quot; Hammar adds that &quot;Muhammed and his teaching of Islam is presented as a barbaric teaching and consequently the main enemy of Buddhism.&quot;

According to John Newman, passages from the &quot;Vimalaprabhā&quot; also mention a year from the Islamic calendar (403 AH, 1012–1013 CE). This supports the dating of this Kālacakra tradition text to the 11th century by Tibetan and Western scholars, as well as the link to the Indian history of that era which saw conflicts with Islamic Ghaznavid invaders. Alexander Berzin also notes that Tibetan sources mention the &quot;barbarians&quot; slaughtering cattle while reciting the name of their god, the veiling of women, circumcision, and five daily prayers facing their holy land, all of which leaves little doubt that the prophecy part of the text is referring to Muslims.

According to the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot;, the battle with the barbarians will be an &quot;illusory battle&quot;. Furthermore, some passages of the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; describes the holy war against the barbarians from a microcosmic perspective as taking place within the body and mind of the Buddhist practitioner. These verses equate the barbarians with mental defilements and bad mental states such as ignorance. They equate victory in battle to the attainment of liberation and the defeat of Mara (Death).

The &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; states:The fight with the mleccha-kings is actually taking place in the body of human beings. That which in the Makha district is an illusory battle with the barbarians is no battle. The &quot;Vimalaprabhā&quot; states:The fight takes place in the body because the battle with the mleccha king is tied to the body, in the middle of the body and because the outer is the form of illusion and the mleccha-battle in the Makha-kingdom is not the battle.Hammar concludes:A radical conclusion is given in this verse. The fight is really in the body and is a way of liberation in the Buddhist sense. In the texts, it is obvious that the inner fight has a higher value of truth than the outer. Reading what is actually written in the text, it is said that the fight in the outer world is not going to take place. The famous eschatological battle between the king of Shambhala, the Kalkin, will not take place and instead it is a method of meditation. The inner way with liberation and illumination is superior. But in the end, because maya (the illusory world) is mentioned in this context, it is possible to imagine that what happens in the outer world indeed is an illusion, but it still has a certain value of reality. The explanation written in these verses is normally not given in the Kalacakra initiations where much stress is laid on the point that everybody who participates in the initiation is going to take part in the eschatological battle by the side of the twenty-fifth king of Shambhala, the Raudra Kalkin in the year 2325. Here it seems rather to be a method of meditation.

=== Subtle body ===
A key element of the Kālacakra teachings is an understanding of certain subtle energetic aspects of the human body. In Kālacakra (as in other tantric traditions), the human body is believed to contain certain subtle elements, mainly the three channels (&quot;nadis&quot;, left, right and central), the vital winds (&quot;lung, prana&quot;), the four drops (&quot;bindus&quot;) and six chakras. These elements function in a cyclical fashion, similar to how cosmological elements also have their cyclical movements. The &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; contains detailed descriptions of these subtle body elements. In the Kālacakra system, the six chakras that lie along the central channel are as follows:

# The Crown Chakra
# Forehead Chakra
# Throat Chakra
# Heart Chakra
# Navel Chakra
# Secret Place Chakra (pubic region)

These subtle elements are used during tantric meditation practice to attain immutable bliss and primordial wisdom. Alexander Berzin writes that &quot;during the Kalachakra empowerment, visualizations of different syllables and colored discs at these spots purify both the chakras and their associated elements.&quot;

According to Gen Lamrimpa: &quot;The Kālacakra Tantra emphasizes the attainment of a buddha body by means of the empty form body, which is used to attain immutable bliss, the mind of a buddha. This differs from other highest yoga tantras, in which the buddha body is attained by transforming the extremely subtle primordial energy into the illusory body.&quot;

=== Adoption of non-Buddhist content ===
According to Vesna Wallace, in the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; one finds &quot;a self-conscious absorption, or appropriation, of the modes of expression that are characteristic of the rival religious systems of India.&quot; This adoption of non-buddhist content extends to various areas of the tantra&#x27;s system, including its theory, language, medicine and cosmology. Wallace argues that this is &quot;inextricably related to Buddhist tantric conversionary efforts&quot; and is justified by the tantra &quot;as a skillful means for leading individuals of diverse mental dispositions to spiritual maturation.&quot; The tantra also warns that one should not grasp at one&#x27;s own view in a dogmatic way, but it also states that one should be careful not to fall under the influence of other teachings &quot;by familiarizing one-self with those teachings in order to refute them.&quot;

The &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; refers to and draws from many different traditions, including non-Buddhist traditions such as the Shaiva, Samkhya, Vaishnava, Jain, Vedic, and Puranic traditions. The Kālacakra mandala also includes deities which are equally accepted by Hindus, Jains and Buddhists. The ideas of these traditions are adopted and re-interpreted from a Buddhist perspective. Some examples of non-buddhist doctrines that the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; makes use of include: the Samkhya doctrines of &quot;prakrti&quot; and &quot;purusha&quot; (as well as the 25 &quot;tattvas&quot; and the three &quot;gunas&quot;), the concept of the fourth state (&quot;turiya&quot;) possibly drawn from the Saiva Agamas, and the ten avatars of Vishnu. Also, according to Wallace, the tantra &quot;incorporates into its mandala the diverse deities that were worshipped by both Buddhists and non-Buddhists.&quot;

Vesna Wallace further notes that, The fact that the conversion of heterodox groups was one of the motivations behind the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot;&#x27;s adoption of specific non-Buddhist ideas implies that its teachings pertaining to the Kalacakra worldview were not kept secret from the public; that is, they were not guarded as secret teachings intended for an initiated elite. Moreover, the Kālacakra tradition&#x27;s preference for explicitly presenting its specific tantric views is a result of its openly professed conversionary endeavors.Wallace notes that a study of the Kālacakra literature shows that the teachings were meant to be accessible to non-Buddhist groups. The &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; states that &quot;one will obtain purity and all virtues by receiving the initiation&quot; whether one is Buddhist, Saiva, Brahmana, Jaina, etc. It also says that initiation into the Kālacakra mandala is also initiation into the mandalas of all deities, including those of non-Buddhists. The tantra also states that the Kālacakra Buddha is the source and teacher of all religious systems, and thus affirms their value while also subsuming them into Buddhist tantra and providing a justification for the tantra&#x27;s adoption of non-buddhist ideas. These religious systems are of course, reinterpreted in new ways. For example, the Vedic sacrifice is reinterpreted in terms of the practice of tantric yoga.

However, while the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; adopts non-buddhist content, it criticizes the Brahmanical Puranic religion. According to Wallace, the text &quot;frequently refers to the Brahmanic teachings, especially those of the Puranas, as false teachings, devoid of reasoning, creating confusion among foolish people, and composed by corrupt Brahmanic sages for the sake of promoting their own social class.&quot;

== Practice ==

=== Initiation and preliminaries ===
Most Tibetan Buddhist lineages require initiates to practice various preliminary practices before attempting Kālacakra yoga proper. In the Jonang school for example, the common preliminaries are:
# Refuge in the three jewels and prostrations
# Awakening bodhicitta (the compassionate resolve to awaken for the sake of all beings)
# Vajrasattva meditation and recitation for purification purposes
# Mandala offerings
# Guru yoga

Geshe Lharampa Ngawang Dhargyey notes that bodhicitta is particularly essential, along with having renunciation and right view (these three common practices are also seen as necessary by Sakya Pandita). Without these foundational Buddhist elements (which are shared with common Mahayana), tantric practice will not bear fruit. Gen Lamrimpa similarly notes that without Mahayana great compassion, one will not attain Buddhahood through tantra. Lamrimpa also notes that one must have some understanding of emptiness before receiving initiation.

As in all Vajrayana practices, a disciple must undergo ritual initiation (&quot;abhiseka)&quot; under a qualified Vajra master to practice the Kālacakra methods. The &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; states that disciples must carefully investigate one&#x27;s tantric master beforehand, so as not to end up practicing a distorted teaching. The tantra also lists various qualities of a proper tantric master, such as being free of greed, having tantric pledges, and being devoid of mental afflictions (&quot;klesa&quot;). A corrupt teacher however is conceited, angry and greedy.

There are two main sets of initiations in Kālacakra: the “Entering as a child” set and the “Supreme” set of initiations. The first of these two sets concerns preparation for the generation stage meditations of Kālacakra. The second concerns preparation for the completion stage meditations known as the Six Yogas of Kālacakra. Attendees who don&#x27;t intend to carry out the practice are often only given the lower seven initiations. The tantric initiations are also said to facilitate the purification of the four drops (&quot;bindus&quot;). The initiations include a series of ritual acts, meditations and visualizations. The supreme initiations include visualizing oneself as the deity, engaging in sexual union with the deity&#x27;s consort and experiencing sexual bliss.

The tantric initiations include sets of tantric vows or pledges called samaya (such as the fourteen root downfalls etc.). If these are not kept, the practice will not bear fruit. The same applies to the bodhisattva precepts.

After the preparatory steps have been taken, one can embark on the actual practice of Kālacakra, which relies on two main methods. Vesna Wallace outlines these as follows:One is a conceptual method of familiarizing oneself with the ultimate nature of one&#x27;s own mind by means of autosuggestion, specifically by means of generating oneself in the form of the deities of the &quot;kalacakra-mandala&quot;. The other method is a non conceptual method of spontaneous and direct recognition of gnosis as the ultimate nature of one&#x27;s own mind. The first method, which is characteristic of the stage of generation (&quot;utpatti krama&quot;), is contrived and based on one&#x27;s faith in the innately pure nature of one&#x27;s own mind, and it uses primarily one&#x27;s powers of imagination. Even though it is characterized by freedom from grasping onto one&#x27;s own ordinary psycho-physical aggregates, or one&#x27;s self-identity as an ordinary being, it is still characterized by holding onto the imagined self-identity. The second method, which is characteristic of the stage of completion (&quot;sampatti krama&quot;), draws upon the experience of imperishable bliss and the direct perception of the innately pure nature of one&#x27;s own mind, which is devoid of grasping onto any identity.Unlike other anuttara-yoga tantras, the goal of Kālacakra practice is not the transformation of the vital winds (pranas) into an illusory body, rather, the Kālacakra system&#x27;s goal is the &quot;windless state&quot; (&quot;avata&quot;), which is &quot;the complete eradication of all present and future pranas.&quot; This is said to lead to the arising of the body of empty form (&quot;the form of emptiness&quot;), and the mind of immutable bliss.

=== Generation stage ===

Generation stage (&quot;bskyed rim&quot;) practices generally consist of meditative visualizations, mainly of oneself as the Kālacakra deity in union with his consort Visvamata, and of the Kālacakra mandala and attendant deities. The first part of this stage is also known as deity-yoga (&quot;devata-yoga&quot;).

This is generally preceded by classic Mahayana practices such as taking refuge, arousing bodhicitta and so on. Then the meditator &quot;imaginatively dissolves the atomic structure of his own body and the body of the universe,&quot; in a process which is supposed to mimic the dying process. Then they meditate on empty form. Then follows the meditation on the mandala and of oneself as the deities. The various features and symbols of the mandala (including the deities) correspond to various Buddhist doctrines and to aspects of the bodies of the Buddha. For example, the four sides of the mandala correspond to the four applications of mindfulness.

The visualizations are also paired with mantra recitation. There are different mantras in the system, but the main mantra is:Oṃ āḥ hūṃ ho haṃ kṣa malavaraya hūṃ phaṭThere are also various sadhanas (texts outlining the practice) of different complexities, the most complex of which can include up to 634 deities while one of the simplest ones includes nine deities. Generation stage practice is said to continue to purify the four drops.

According to Geshe Lharampa Ngawang Dhargyey, there is no need to practice &quot;samatha&quot; (&#x27;clear stillness&#x27;) separately, as the culmination of the generation stage leads to the attainment of samatha. Furthermore, this practice also facilitates the attainment of insight (&quot;vipasyana&quot;) into the impermanent, empty and blissful nature of the visualized imagery.

According to Geshe Lharampa, the main objective of the generation stage is to dispel ordinary appearances and ordinary conceptions. Everything in one&#x27;s experience (what one sees, ones thoughts, etc.) is to be seen as being the mandala and deities. There are two elements of this, divine pride (the self-confidence that one actually is the deity) and clear appearance (of the visualization).

The development of &quot;divine pride&quot; is based on some understanding of the emptiness of inherent existence of the deities that one is identifying with. Indeed, according to the &quot;Kālacakratantra,&quot; generation stage practice is based on one&#x27;s understanding of emptiness, and thus should only be done once one has had some realization into emptiness. Furthermore, it is also based on the understanding that the entire mandala is an illusion (&quot;maya&quot;) and an ideation (&quot;kalpana&quot;).

Following the practice of deity yoga visualization, there are two further yogic practices which are part of the stage of generation: the yoga of drops (&quot;bindu-yoga&quot;) and the subtle yoga (&quot;suksma-yoga&quot;). Both of these involve a sadhana on sexual bliss, most often done with an imagined consort or &quot;gnosis-consort&quot; (&quot;jnana-mudra&quot;). The yoga of drops requires generation of inner heat or candali (&quot;tummo&quot;), which incinerates the pranas in the channels and allows the seminal essence or bodhicitta to flow into the chakras, generating the four blisses. During the practice of the subtle yoga, a drop of purified bodhicitta enters the secret chakra and ascends up the central channel generating the four blisses and transforming the four drops into the four bodies of the Buddha.

=== Six Yogas of the Completion Stage ===

In Kālacakra, the yoga of the generation stage is seen as being characterized by ideation or imagination (&quot;kalpana&quot;), and thus can only indirectly induce spiritual awakening (as well as mundane siddhis). The Completion Stage yogas however are seen as free of ideation, uncontrived and non-conceptual (since their focus is the form of emptiness, not the deity&#x27;s bodily form). They are thus the most important yogas for the direct attainment of the mahamudra-siddhi (i.e. &quot;prajnaparamita&quot;) and thus of the attainment of Buddhadhood.

The Kālacakra system&#x27;s Completion Stage (&quot;rdzogs rim&quot;) practices include a set of practices known as the &quot;Six Phase Yoga&quot; (&quot;Ṣaḍaṅga&quot;-&quot;yoga, sbyor drug&quot;) also known as the &quot;Six Vajra-Yogas&quot;. This system has a close connection to previous Indian systems of six phased yogas, the first of which appears in the &quot;Maitri Upanishad.&quot; The practices of the six phased yoga are based on the subtle body system of channels (&quot;nadis&quot;), winds (&quot;lung, prana&quot;), drops (&quot;bindus&quot;) and chakras, and require a foundation of generation stage practice.

The six yogas are as follows:

* The Yoga of Retraction (&quot;pratyāhara&quot;, &quot;so sor sdud pa&quot;). This practice involves bringing the vital winds (&quot;pranas&quot;) into the central channel where they are dissolved. This is done by focusing the mind on the aperture of the central channel in the top of the forehead with eyes open and an upward gaze (the &quot;gaze of Ushnishacakri&quot;). When the vital winds cease to flow in the side channels, the connection between the five sense faculties and their objects is severed and craving for material things diminishes. When this happens, extraordinary signs which are also called empty forms arise (the sign of smoke, a mirage, fire-flies, a lamp, a flame, the moon, the sun, the supreme form, and a drop/bindu) and become more vivid the more stabilized the mind becomes. The first four signs appear when practicing at night or in a dark enclosed space and the others appear while practicing in the daytime and while meditating on open space. A drop/bindu with a Buddha at the center will appear as the tenth sign.
* Yoga of Meditation (&quot;dhyāna&quot;, &quot;bsam gtan&quot;). This yoga refers to meditative absorption of the &quot;all-pervading form&quot; (&quot;visva-bimba&quot;), which is also practiced with the gaze of Ushnishacakri. It is defined as a mind that has become unified with empty form as an object and has the five factors of wisdom (&quot;prajna&quot;), investigation (&quot;tarka&quot;), analysis (&quot;vicara&quot;), joy (&quot;rati&quot;), and immutable bliss (&quot;acala-sukha&quot;). The ten signs also may spontaneously reappear. Daytime practice of this yoga is achieved by gazing at the cloudless sky with one&#x27;s back turned to the sun until a shining black line appears in the center of the sign of the sign of the drop. The body of the Buddha will appear in the central channel, looking like the sun&#x27;s image in water with all colors.
* Yoga of Wind Control (&quot;prāṇāyāma&quot;, &quot;srog rtsol&quot;). By concentrating on the navel chakra, one draws in and stabilizes the pranas in that chakra, which is the seat of the drop associated with the fourth state of mind (&quot;turiya&quot;). Then one apprehends and moves the arisen form of Kālacakra&#x27;s sambhogakaya into the navel where it merges with the drop. The deities remain in the navel chakra, and then ascend and descend the central channel during the process of inhalation and exhalation. The external breath ceases and the meditator practices &quot;kumbhaka&quot; (breath hold). This allows one to stabilize the mind on the navel chakra, which leads to the arising of inner heat (&quot;candali&quot;, &quot;tummo&quot;) which melts the four drops. One then experiences the four blisses.
* Yoga of Retention (&quot;dharāṇā&quot;, &quot;‘dzin pa&quot;). This entails the unification of the vital winds or pranas in the navel chakra accompanied by the manifestation of Kālacakra and consort, followed by the sequential concentration on the chakras of the heart, throat, forehead and ushnisha which cause the pranas to dissolve the four elements of water, fire, wind and space associated with these chakras. This leads to the experience of the four blisses. Afterwards, the pranas cease and the mind becomes unified. One then apprehends the form of emptiness (&quot;sunyata-bimba&quot;).
* Yoga of Recollection (&quot;anusmṛiti, rjes dran&quot;). This is the non-conceptual union of the mind with empty form. One perceives innumerable rays of light consisting of five colors in the navel chakra. This results in the realization of the form of gnosis (&quot;jnana-bimba&quot;) or the empty form. One becomes purified and appears as a stainless disc of light.
* Yoga of Samādhi (&quot;ting nge ‘dzin&quot;). The red and white drops are stacked along the central channel causing immutable blisses, the cessation of all pranas and the transformation of the material body into a body that is not material, the empty form body, which is also the four bodies of the Buddha. According to Wallace: &quot;the object of gnosis (&quot;jneya&quot;) and gnosis (&quot;jnana&quot;) itself become unified and give rise to supreme, imperishable bliss. For that reason, the samadhi that is practiced here is defined as &#x27;a meditative concentration on the form of gnosis (&quot;jnana-bimba&quot;).&#x27; It is also interpreted as the imperishable bliss that arises from the union of the apprehended object (&quot;grahya&quot;) and the apprehending subject (&quot;grahaka&quot;) &quot;

== History ==
=== Origins ===
According to the Kālacakra tradition, Sakyamuni Buddha manifested as the Kālachakra deities and taught the Kālachakra root tantra at a stupa in Dharanikota (near modern Amaravathi, Andhra Pradesh). He did this while supposedly bilocating (appearing in two places at once) at the same time as he was also delivering the Prajñāpāramitā sutras at Griddhraj Parvat in Bihar.

Along with King Suchandra, ninety-six minor kings and emissaries from Shambhala were also said to have received the teachings. The &quot;Kālacakra&quot; thus passed directly to the kingdom of Shambhala, where it was held exclusively for hundreds of years. Later Kings of Shambhala, Mañjushrīkīrti and Pundarika, are said to have condensed and simplified the teachings into the &quot;Śri Kālacakra&quot; or &quot;Laghutantra&quot; and its main commentary, the &quot;Vimalaprabha&quot;, which remain extant today as the heart of the Kālacakra literature. Fragments of the original tantra have survived; the most significant fragment, the &quot;Sekkodesha&quot;, was commented upon by Naropa.

Mañjuśrīkīrti is said to have been born in 159 BCE and ruled over Shambhala and 100,000 cities. In his domain lived 300,510 mleccha barbarians with heretical beliefs in Nimai sinta (sun). He expelled all these heretics from his dominions but they accepted Buddhism and pleaded that they be allowed to return. He accepted their petitions and taught them the &quot;Kālacakra&quot; teachings. In 59 BCE he abdicated his throne to his son, Puṇḍārika, and died soon afterwards, entering the saṃbhogakāya of Buddhahood.

There are currently two main textual traditions of Kālacakra in Tibetan-Buddhism, the Ra lineage () of Ra Lotsawa and the Dro lineage () of Drolo Sherap Drak. In both traditions, the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; and its related commentaries were returned to India in 966 CE by an Indian pandit. In the Ra tradition this figure is known as Chilupa, and in the Dro tradition as Kālacakrapada the Greater. Chilupa is said to have set out to receive the Kālacakra teachings in Shambhala, along the journey to which he encountered a manifestation of Mañjuśrī, who gave him the Kālacakra initiation. He then disseminated the Kālacakra teachings in India.

According to Vesna Wallace, the propagation of the Kālacakra teachings in India date to the 11th century.

=== Spread to Tibet ===

According to Tāranātha, seventeen distinct lineages of Kālacakra that came from India to Tibet were recorded and compiled by the Jonang master, Kunpang Chenpo. The main two lineages of these that are practised today are the Dro lineage and the Ra lineage, both lineages were founded by disciples of an Indian master named Nalandapa.

The Ra lineage became particularly important in the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, where it was held by such prominent masters as Sakya Pandita (1182–1251), Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280), Butön Rinchen Drup (1290–1364), and Dölpopa Shérap Gyeltsen (1292–1361). The latter two, both of whom also held the Dro lineage, are particularly well known expositors of the &quot;Kālacakra&quot; in Tibet, the practice of which is said to have greatly informed Dölpopa&#x27;s exposition of &quot;shentong&quot; philosophy. A strong emphasis on &quot;Kālacakra&quot; practice and exposition of the shentong view were the principal distinguishing characteristics of the Jonang school that traces its roots to Dölpopa.

Today, Kālacakra is practiced by all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, although it is most prominent in Gelug and Jonang. It is the main tantric practice for the Jonangpa, whose school persists to this day with a small number of monasteries in Kham, Qinghai and Sichuan.

== Kālacakra lineages ==
Butön Rinchen Drup had considerable influence on the later development of the Gelug and Sakya traditions of Kālacakra while Dölpopa and Tāranātha were the main figures who developed the Jonang tradition on which the Kagyu, Nyingma, and the Tsarpa branch of the Sakya draw. The Jonang tradition mainly use the texts of Jonang masters Bamda Gelek Gyatso and Tāranātha to teach Kālacakra. The Nyingma and Kagyu rely on the Kālacakra works of Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso and Jamgon Kongtrul, both of whom took a strong interest in the Jonang Kālacakra tradition. The Tsarpa branch of the Sakya maintain the practice lineage for the six branch yoga of Kālacakra in the Jonang tradition.

There were many other influences and much cross-fertilization between the different traditions, and indeed the 14th Dalai Lama asserted that it is acceptable for those initiated in one Kālacakra tradition to practice in others.

=== Jonang ===

One of the main promoters of Kālacakra in Tibet were scholar-yogis of the Jonang school, such as Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292–1361) and Tāranātha (1575–1634). In fact, the Jonang tradition specializes in Kālacakra, its practice (especially that of the six vajra yogas), its philosophy and its rituals. This began with the work of Kunpang Thukje Tsöndru (1243–1313) who synthesized seventeen different transmission lineages of the Kālacakra sixfold vajrayoga into the Jonang Kālacakra tradition. Jonang is particularly important in that it has preserved this complete Kālacakra system (which has now entered other schools like Kagyu and Nyingma).

In the 17th century, the government of the 5th Dalai Lama outlawed the Jonang school, closing down or forcibly converting most of its monasteries and banning their writings. The Jonang tradition has survived and is now officially recognized by the Tibetan Government in exile as a fifth school of Tibetan Buddhism. Khenpo Kunga Sherab Rinpoche and Khentrul Rinpoche are contemporary Jonangpa Kālacakra masters.

=== Gelug ===
The Dalai Lamas have had specific interest in the Kālacakra practice, particularly the First, Second, Seventh, Eighth, and the current (Fourteenth) Dalai Lamas. The present Dalai Lama has given over thirty Kālacakra initiations all over the world, and is the most prominent Kālacakra lineage holder alive today. Billed as the &quot;Kālacakra for World Peace,&quot; they draw tens of thousands of people. Generally, it is unusual for tantric initiations to be given to large public assemblages, but the Kālacakra has always been an exception.

The 14th Dalai Lama&#x27;s 33rd Kalachakra ceremony was held in Leh, Ladakh, India, from July 3 to July 12, 2014. About 150,000 devotees and 350,000 tourists were expected to participate in the festival.

The Dalai Lama, Kalu Rinpoche, and others have stated that the public exposition of this tantra is necessary in the current degenerate age. The initiation may be received simply as a blessing for the majority of those attending, however, many of the more qualified attendees do take the commitments and subsequently engage in the practice.

Kirti Tsenshab Rinpoche (1926–2006), the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu, Jhado Rinpoche and the late Gen Lamrimpa (d. 2003) were also among prominent Gelugpa Kālacakra masters.

=== Kagyu ===
The Kālacakra tradition practiced in the Karma Kagyu and Shangpa Kagyu schools is derived from the Jonang tradition and was largely systematized by Jamgon Kongtrul, who wrote the text that is now used for empowerment. The 2nd and 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul (1954–1992) were also prominent Kālacakra lineage holders, with the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul giving the initiation publicly in North America on at least one occasion (Toronto 1990).

The chief Kālacakra lineage holder for the Kagyu lineage was Kalu Rinpoche (1905–1990), who gave the initiation several times in Tibet, India, Europe and North America (e.g., New York 1982). Upon his death, this mantle was assumed by his heart son, Bokar Tulku Rinpoche (1940–2004), who in turn passed it on to Khenpo Lodro Donyo Rinpoche. Bokar Monastery, of which Donyo Rinpoche is now the head, features a Kālacakra stupa and is a prominent retreat center for Kālacakra practice in the Kagyu lineage.

Tenga Rinpoche was also a prominent Kagyu holder of the Kālacakra; he gave the initiation in Grabnik, Poland in August, 2005. Lopon Tsechu performed Kālacakra initiations and build Kālacakra stupa in Karma Guen buddhist center in southern Spain. Another prominent Kālacakra master is the Second Beru Khyentse.

Chögyam Trungpa, while not a noted Kālacakra master, became increasingly involved later in his life with what he termed Shambhala teachings, derived in part from the Kālacakra tradition, in particular, the mind terma which he received from the Kalki.

=== Nyingma ===
Among the prominent recent and contemporary Nyingma Kālacakra masters are Dzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö (1894–1959), Dilgo Khyentse (1910–1991), and Penor Rinpoche (1932–2009). An important Nyingma Kālacakra lineage holder alive today is Sakyong Mipham.

=== Sakya ===

Sakya Trizin, the present head of the Sakya lineage, has given the Kālacakra initiation many times and is a recognized master of the practice.

The Sakya master H.E. Chogye Trichen Rinpoche is one of the main holders of the Kālacakra teachings. Chogye Rinpoche is the head of the Tsharpa School, one of the three main schools of the Sakya tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. Chogye Trichen Rinpoche is the holder of six different Kālacakra initiations, four of which, the Bulug, Jonang, Maitri-gyatsha, and Domjung, are contained within the Gyude Kuntu, the Collection of Tantras compiled by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and his disciple Loter Wangpo. Rinpoche has offered all six of these empowerments to Sakya Trizin, the head of the Sakya School of Tibetan Buddhism. Rinpoche has given the Kālacakra initiation in Tibet, Mustang, Kathmandu, Malaysia, the United States, Taiwan, and Spain, and is widely regarded as a definitive authority on Kālacakra. In 1988 he traveled to the United States, giving the initiation and complete instructions in the practice of the six-branch Vajrayoga of Kālacakra according to the Jonangpa tradition in Boston.

== Iconography ==

Tantric iconography including sharp weapons, shields, and corpses similarly appears in conflict with those tenets of non-violence but instead represent the transmutation of aggression into a method for overcoming illusion and ego. Both Kālacakra and his dharmapala protector Vajravega hold a sword and shield in their paired second right and left hands. This is an expression of the Buddha&#x27;s triumph over the attack of Mara and his protection of all sentient beings. Symbolism researcher Robert Beer writes the following about tantric iconography of weapons and mentions the charnel ground:Many of these weapons and implements have their origins in the wrathful arena of the battlefield and the funereal realm of the charnel grounds. As primal images of destruction, slaughter, sacrifice, and necromancy these weapons were wrested from the hands of the evil and turned – as symbols – against the ultimate root of evil, the self-cherishing conceptual identity that gives rise to the five poisons of ignorance, desire, hatred, pride, and jealousy. In the hands of siddhas, dakinis, wrathful and semi-wrathful yidam deities, protective deities or dharmapalas these implements became pure symbols, weapons of transformation, and an expression of the deities&#x27; wrathful compassion which mercilessly destroys the manifold illusions of the inflated human ego.

<text>The San Diego Chicken (also known as the Famous Chicken, the KGB Chicken or simply The Chicken) is a sports mascot played by Ted Giannoulas.

==History==
===Origin===
The character originated in 1974 in an animated TV commercial for KGB-FM Radio in San Diego. Writer, cartoonist, and actor Brian Narelle was working for Odyssey Productions and offered to animate an acrobatic chicken as part of a commercial contract bid. Narelle went on to direct and animate the commercial as well as create cartoon art for the campaign.
In March 1974, Giannoulas was hired to wear the first chicken suit; at the time he was a 20-year-old journalism major at San Diego State University. He was originally from Canada but had attended Hoover High School in San Diego. The Chicken&#x27;s first appearance was a KGB promotion to distribute Easter eggs to children at the San Diego Zoo. After his first appearance, Giannoulas, a lifetime baseball fan, approached the San Diego Padres front office. “I’ll bet I could get into games free in this get up,” he thought. He was allowed to wander throughout the stands at Padres games, and if someone said &quot;lay one on me,&quot; The Chicken would &quot;lay&quot; an egg containing a prize via his leggings. He soon took to the field and, he recalled, “discovered a side of my personality I did not know existed, almost a Jekyll and Hyde thing.” Once on the field, he demonstrated a remarkable ability to mime, joke with players and umpires, and connect with fans. Padres’ attendance, which had been the lowest in the league, doubled that summer.

The Chicken, whose antics entertained steadily larger crowds, began to add appearances at concerts and sporting events, while continuing to perform at more than 520 San Diego Padres games in a row. The Chicken also appeared at many San Diego Clippers basketball games before the team moved to Los Angeles. San Diego sports reporter Jack Murphy described him as an &quot;embryonic Charlie Chaplin in chicken feathers&quot;.

===Firing and afterwards===
Conflict emerged between KGB Radio and Giannoulas, and he was fired on May 3, 1979. Another unnamed employee was hired to don a chicken outfit at a Padres game. Fans, many of whom were aware that Giannoulas was not in the outfit, booed the chicken loudly, forcing him off the field. After a lawsuit was decided in Giannoulas&#x27;s favor in June 1979 by Judge Raul Rosado, Giannoulas was allowed to continue to perform in a chicken costume, although not the same one as the original. His new persona, the self-styled &quot;Famous Chicken&quot;, emerged from an egg at a &quot;Grand Hatching&quot; seen by 47,000 people at a Padres game at Jack Murphy Stadium on Friday, as the sound system played the introduction to &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;, the theme notably used in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

Beginning in 1981, Giannoulas co-starred on the Saturday morning children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Baseball Bunch&quot;, alongside noted Cincinnati Reds catcher Johnny Bench and Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda. The local Emmy Award–winning series ran for five seasons and featured The Famous Chicken as the comic foil to Bench as he attempted to mentor a fictional baseball team of Little League–aged children. In his 1984 review of the show, &quot;Miami Herald&quot; sports writer Bob Rubin praised Giannoulas&#x27; contribution to the series, writing, &quot;The Chicken may be the most gifted physical comic since Curly, Larry, and Moe.&quot;
Five years after a halftime incident at a Chicago Bulls&#x27; NBA game in January 1991, a Chicago jury ordered Giannoulas to pay $300,000 to a Bulls cheerleader injured when The Chicken tackled her on the basketball court.

In 1998, the owners of the &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; children&#x27;s television show on PBS sued Giannoulas for copyright and trademark infringement, over a sketch in which The Chicken engages in a slapstick dance contest against a Barney-like character. Giannoulas prevailed in the suit and recovered his attorneys&#x27; fees, based on the court&#x27;s determination that his sketch was a legitimate parody, and therefore protected speech.

The success of the Famous Chicken helped lead to mascots becoming widespread throughout professional sports, particularly Major League Baseball. The Chicken was named one of the 100 most powerful people in sports for the 20th century by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. The pop culture publication &quot;Spy&quot; referred to Giannoulas as the Laurence Olivier of sports mascots, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;perhaps the most influential mascot in sports history.&quot;

Giannoulas was inducted in the Baseball Reliquary Shrine of the Eternals in 2011.

===Later activities===
By 2015, The Chicken was reported to have made 5,100 appearances in 917 different facilities, 50 states, and eight countries, wearing out more than 100 chicken suits.

As of August 2016, after 42 years of playing The Chicken, Giannoulas was still making appearances across the United States, albeit at a slower pace, performing at 11 ballparks in July and August of that year. He expressed uncertainty about how long he would continue, or whether he would appoint a successor. &quot;It&#x27;s not the end,&quot; he was quoted as saying, &quot;but I can see it from here.&quot;

==Notable appearances==
*In 1975, The KGB Chicken made a promotional appearance at San Diego Comic-Con. Convention organizers gave him the grand prize in their costume contest, then asked for it to be returned when they realized he was &quot;a professional&quot;.
*Early in the first Holiday Bowl on December 22, 1978, security guards attempted to eject The Chicken from the field. He refused to leave the game, sitting on the sidelines as the issue was ironed out. Meanwhile, as Brigham Young University was working their way through the &quot;red zone&quot; for a touchdown, the crowd was chanting, &quot;We want The Chicken.&quot;
* The Chicken was on hand at Jack Murphy Stadium in , when the Oakland Raiders beat the San Diego Chargers on the infamous &quot;Holy Roller Play&quot; on September 10. After the Raiders recovered the winning touchdown in the end zone, The Chicken fell on the ground and lay motionless as though he had a heart attack.
*The Chicken appeared at &quot;WrestleMania XV&quot; and &quot;WrestleMania 2000&quot;, although the costume was worn by Pete Rose at WrestleMania XV, during which he was Tombstoned by Kane.
*The Chicken made a cameo appearance in the cult movie &quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes&quot; as one of the citizens stomping the remaining killer tomatoes in a parking lot.
*In 1979, The Chicken recorded a cover of Rod Stewart&#x27;s disco hit &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot;
*In the 1980s, The Chicken would appear in McDonald&#x27;s commercials with Ronald McDonald. McDonald&#x27;s CEO Ray Kroc was also the owner of the Padres, at whose games The Chicken appeared frequently.
*In 1982, The Chicken appeared in a Simon &amp; Simon episode titled &quot;Fowl Play&quot; where he appears as a mascot for the San Diego Pioneers, although Giannoulas was in the costume playing the part as the team mascot performing on the sidelines during the football game, however after the game was over the costume without the head was worn by the guest star Henry Gibson portraying as Herbert T. Dowd when he was being interrogated by the Simon Brothers in the locker room.
*From 1982 to 1984 Donruss sports cards sets included a card for The Chicken, with an offer on the back allowing purchasers to send the card to The Chicken himself to autograph it.

*In 1994, The Chicken was featured in &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; magazine in a piece about mascots.

The article says that Giannoulas&#x27; antics helped set a new standard compared to earlier dull mascots.

<text>Broderick Stephen Harvey Sr. (born January 17, 1957) is an American comedian, television host, actor, writer, and producer. He hosts &quot;The Steve Harvey Morning Show&quot;, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Family Feud Africa&quot;, and the arbitration-based court comedy &quot;Judge Steve Harvey&quot;, and formerly hosted the Miss Universe competition. His accomplishments include seven Daytime Emmy Awards, two Marconi Awards, and fourteen NAACP Image Awards.

Harvey began his career as a stand-up comedian in the early 1980s, and later hosted &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot; and starred in the television sitcom &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot; on The WB. In 2000, he was featured in &quot;The Original Kings of Comedy&quot; after starring in the &quot;Kings of Comedy Tour&quot;. His last standup show was in 2012. Harvey is also the host of both &quot;Family Feud&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;, holding this role since 2010. He also hosted &quot;Little Big Shots&quot;, &quot;Little Big Shots Forever Young&quot;, and &quot;Steve Harvey&#x27;s Funderdome&quot;.

As an author, Harvey has written four books, including his 2009 bestseller &quot;Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man&quot;. In 2017, he founded Steve Harvey Global, an entertainment company that houses his production company East 112 and various other ventures. Harvey launched an African version of &quot;Family Feud&quot; and also invested in the HDNet takeover along with Anthem Sports and Entertainment. He and his wife, Marjorie, are the founders of The Steve and Marjorie Harvey Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on youth education.

==Early life==
Broderick Stephen Harvey was born on January 17, 1957, in Welch, West Virginia, the son of Jesse Harvey, a coal miner, and Eloise Vera. He is the youngest of five children. His first name is Broderick, named after actor Broderick Crawford of the TV series &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;. Harvey had a severe stutter as a child, but eventually overcame it. When he was in the sixth grade, Harvey wrote that he wanted to be on TV when he grew up, after his teacher asked the class to record their personal dreams. Harvey&#x27;s teacher told his father that Harvey was being a &quot;smart aleck.&quot; His father believed in him though. After Harvey achieved his dream, he sent the teacher a TV every year for Christmas for the rest of her life. Harvey and his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, living on East 112th Street, which was renamed Steve Harvey Way in 2015. Harvey graduated from Glenville High School in 1974.

Shortly after high school, Harvey attended Kent State University, where he was a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity, but never graduated from college. He readily admits to &quot;flunking out&quot; of Kent State after two years as an advertising major in the 1970s. While Harvey has talked about overcoming his early life and educational obstacles, Harvey later conceded, &quot;It really threw my life into a downward spiral, and I regret not getting that degree.&quot;

==Career==
===Early career and comedy===

Harvey has been a boxer, an autoworker, an insurance salesman, a carpet cleaner, and a mailman. He first performed stand-up comedy on October 8, 1985, at the Hilarities Comedy Club in Cleveland, Ohio. In the late 1980s, Harvey was homeless for three years. He slept in his 1976 Ford when not performing gigs that provided a hotel, and showered at gas stations and swimming pools. Rich and Becky Liss helped Harvey during this time with a contract for carpet cleaning and credit at a travel agency.

===1990–2009: Move to television and film===

Harvey was a finalist in the Second Annual Johnnie Walker National Comedy Search performing on April 16, 1990, eventually leading to a long stint as host of &quot;It&#x27;s Showtime at the Apollo&quot;, succeeding Mark Curry in that role. Harvey&#x27;s success as a stand-up comedian led to a starring role on the short-lived ABC series &quot;Me and the Boys&quot; in 1994. He would later star on The WB network show &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;, which ran from 1996 to 2002. While popular, the show never achieved critical acclaim outside of the African-American community.

In 1997, Harvey continued his work in stand-up comedy, performing on the Kings of Comedy tour along with Cedric the Entertainer, D.L. Hughley, and Bernie Mac. The tour became the highest grossing comedy tour in history, grossing $18 million its first year and $19 million its second. The comedy act would later be put together into a film by Spike Lee called &quot;The Original Kings of Comedy&quot;. That title was also used as the name of Harvey&#x27;s comedy and variety television show (later renamed &quot;Steve Harvey&#x27;s Big Time Challenge&quot;), which aired on The WB network from 2003 until 2005.

Harvey is the host of &quot;The Steve Harvey Morning Show&quot;, a weekday morning radio program he has hosted since 2000. It was originally syndicated through Radio One, Inc. from September 2000 to May 2005. As of 2019, the show is syndicated through the United States.

Harvey appeared in the 2003 movie &quot;The Fighting Temptations&quot; alongside Cuba Gooding Jr. and Beyoncé Knowles. The same year, he played the role of Clarence Johnson in the film &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Cost a Thing&quot;. In 2004, Harvey had roles in the films &quot;Johnson Family Vacation&quot; and &quot;You Got Served&quot;; in 2005, he co-starred in the movie &quot;Racing Stripes&quot; as the voice of Buzz.

In 2006, Harvey released the stand-up special &quot;Steve Harvey: Don&#x27;t Trip... He Ain&#x27;t Through with Me Yet&quot; directed by Leslie Small. The special was filmed at MegaFest with Harvey not using profanity during the show. He hosted the Disney Dreamers Academy, a teen-focused personal and professional enrichment event that took place January 17–20, 2008, at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.

Harvey released the book &quot;Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man&quot; in 2009. The book is about how men think about women and relationships. Based on the book, the 2012 film &quot;Think Like a Man&quot; is an ensemble romantic comedy depicting characters taking advice on dating from the book. The hardcover version spent 64 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list, 23 of those weeks at No. 1.

===2010–2016: &quot;Family Feud&quot; and other ventures===

Harvey began hosting &quot;Family Feud&quot; in September 2010. The show has seen improved ratings under him, and Harvey holds the longest tenure of any &quot;Family Feud&quot; host. He also hosts &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;, where celebrities compete for a chance to donate up to $25,000 to their favorite charity. The show airs during the summer on ABC.

In August 2011, on his radio show, Harvey called Cornel West and Tavis Smiley &quot;Uncle Toms&quot; because of their criticism of President Barack Obama. Harvey later apologized for using the phrase but maintained his criticism of West and Smiley.

On August 2, 2012, Harvey performed his final stand-up act at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, ending a 27-year career as a stand-up comedian. The two-hour performance was broadcast live on pay-per-view.

The same year, Harvey debuted a self-titled syndicated talk show produced by Endemol and distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution at the NBC Tower in Chicago.

In 2013, Harvey became the first double host nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award, receiving nominations for both Outstanding Talk Show Host and Outstanding Game Show Host. He was also honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The following year, Harvey launched a new dating website called Delightful. It is a joint venture with IAC with Harvey supplying articles and videos for the site.

In December 2015, Harvey hosted the Miss Universe 2015 pageant in Las Vegas. Upon announcing the final results, he mistakenly named the first runner-up, Miss Colombia (Ariadna Gutiérrez) as the winner, as Harvey apparently mistook the envelope as the name of the final runner-up for that of the winner. A few minutes after she was crowned, Harvey announced that he had read the results incorrectly and that Miss Philippines (Pia Wurtzbach) was the new Miss Universe. Harvey apologized to Wurtzbach outside the venue and later tweeted an apology to both contestants. He also hosted the Miss Universe 2016 pageant in the Philippines on January 30, 2017, telling the Miss Universe Organization that he wanted to personally apologize to the Filipinos for the incident that occurred during the last Miss Universe pageant he hosted. Harvey returned as host for the Miss Universe 2017 pageant in Las Vegas on November 26, 2017, the Miss Universe 2018 pageant in Thailand on December 17, 2018, the Miss Universe 2019 pageant in Atlanta, Georgia on December 8, 2019, and the Miss Universe 2021 pageant in Israel on December 13, 2021. During the 2019 pageant, he mistakenly announced Miss Philippines (Gazini Ganados) as the winner of the National Costume contest when the winner was Miss Malaysia (Shweta Sekhon).

In January 2016, Harvey gave a motivational speech to audience members after the taping of an episode of &quot;Family Feud&quot;. The theme of the speech was for people to embrace the skills they were born with. He references embracing the gifts with jumping from a cliff and relying on the parachute (those gifts) to help you. The speech was the motivation for the book &quot;Jump: Take the Leap of Faith to Achieve Your Life of Abundance&quot;, published by Harvey in 2016.

In October 2016, it was announced that Harvey would host two revival specials of &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot; for Fox. The following month, the &quot;Steve Harvey&quot; talk show was cancelled, and it was announced that Harvey had reached a deal with IMG to produce a new syndicated talk show in Los Angeles with NBCUniversal. The new series, &quot;Steve&quot;, premiered in September 2017, and was described as having more of a celebrity- and comedy-oriented format with a larger amount of creative control held by Harvey, as opposed to the previous program&#x27;s larger focus on human interest subjects. To facilitate the new series, production of Harvey&#x27;s radio show and &quot;Family Feud&quot; were relocated to L.A.

Harvey is the co-creator of &quot;Little Big Shots&quot;, a series launched in 2016; executive producers are Harvey and Ellen DeGeneres. The series features children demonstrating talents and engaging in conversation with Harvey. He hosted the show until 2019.

In 2016, during a commencement ceremony at Alabama State University, President Dr. Gwendolyn Boyd awarded Harvey an honorary doctorate.

===2017–present: Steve Harvey Global===

Harvey united all of his businesses under Steve Harvey Global (SHG) in 2017. Brands under SHG include East One Twelve, Harvey&#x27;s in-house production company that is used to develop digital content, films, and television. The company also owns the rights for international versions of &quot;Family Feud&quot;, of which an African version of the show was announced to begin in 2020. He also launched the Sand and Soul Festival in 2017. The event has been held yearly and features live music, comedy, and a question and answers session with Harvey and his wife Marjorie. He also launched Harvey Events, a special events company led by his daughter Morgan Hawthorne and son-in-law Kareem Hawthorne. It has produced events such as the FroRibbean Fest in Atlanta in 2018.

In 2017, Harvey began hosting a New Year&#x27;s Eve special from Times Square for Fox (which, like his talk show, would be produced in partnership with IMG). Two days before the broadcast, Harvey was ordained in the state of New York so he could officiate an on-air wedding between Keven Undergaro and Maria Menounos during the special. The special was Fox&#x27;s most-watched New Year&#x27;s Eve broadcast to date.

In January 2017, Harvey made jokes on &quot;Steve Harvey&quot; about Asian men, ridiculing the idea that any white or black woman would want to date one. He said: &quot;Excuse me, do you like Asian men? No, thank you.&quot; Harvey went on to add, &quot;I don&#x27;t even like Chinese food.&quot; The remarks brought criticism from Asian Americans, including New York politicians and &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot; author Eddie Huang. Huang called Harvey &quot;hypocritical&quot; for speaking about issues facing the black community while denigrating Asians. Harvey apologized on his talk show and Twitter, saying: &quot;I offer my humblest apology for offending anyone, particularly those in the Asian community … It was not my intention, and the humor was not meant with any malice or disrespect whatsoever.&quot; However, he also earlier said, &quot;I ain&#x27;t been laughing that much over the past few days. They&#x27;re kinda beating me up on the internet right now for no reason. But, you know, that&#x27;s life, ain&#x27;t it?&quot;

In response to a caller from Flint, Michigan, who insulted the Cleveland Cavaliers after their loss to the Golden State Warriors in the 2017 NBA Finals, Harvey, a Cavaliers fan, told the caller to &quot;go have yourself a nice glass of brown water!&quot; in reference to the city&#x27;s water crisis. The joke was criticized by, among others, Amariyanna Copeny and Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, who demanded a public apology. Harvey responded by saying, &quot;The caller and I were talking trash about our teams and cities. Simply trash talking about sports. I made a joke directed at him, as he is from Flint, a city for which I have great affection and respect. So much so that I devoted a full hour on my daytime talk show to raising awareness for the Flint water crisis … The caller laughed, as my joke was taken in the context it was offered.&quot;

At the end of 2018, it was announced that Harvey would host the eighth annual NFL Honors. He said that he had wanted to host it for a while, going as far as to say in his opening monologue: &quot;What took y&#x27;all so long to ask me to host the show?&quot; Harvey returned to host the ninth annual show the following season.

In 2019, Harvey announced the launch of a learning hub called Vault. He also invested in the takeover of HDNet along with Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment.

In January 2022, Harvey began hosting the arbitration-based court comedy &quot;Judge Steve Harvey&quot; on ABC.

On International Day of Happiness 2022, Harvey, on behalf of the United States and the Vatican pavilions, held a talk in Dubai during Expo 2020 to discuss the relations between happiness and religion.

In March 2024, it was announced that Harvey would join Merit Street Media, an upcoming multi-platform media outlet owned and created by his longtime friend Phil McGraw, the former host of &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;.

==Philanthropy==

Harvey is the founder of the Steve &amp; Marjorie Harvey Foundation, a philanthropic organization that provides youth outreach services. It hosts a yearly camp for fatherless children and also partnered with Kent State University to provide scholarships to the school. Harvey is also a partner with Walt Disney World Resort and &quot;Essence&quot; for the Disney Dreamers Academy, a yearly workshop at Walt Disney World for 100 students.

During the 2022 Halloween Thriller Night hosted by the Heal Los Angeles Foundation, Harvey and Chris Tucker received the inaugural &quot;Man in The Mirror&quot; Award, given to influential individuals who use their platforms for good. Harvey accepted the award presented by Prince Jackson, son of Michael Jackson.

==Personal life==
Harvey has been married three times and has seven children (four biological children and three stepchildren). From his first marriage to Marcia Harvey, Harvey has two daughters (twins Brandi and Karli) and a son (Broderick Stephen Jr.). From his second marriage to Mary Shackelford, Harvey has a son named Wynton. The couple divorced in November 2005. In 2011, Collin County, Texas-based 199th District Court Judge Robert Dry expressed concern about Mary Harvey spreading false information about the divorce, with the judge suggesting that she had not been left materially destitute.

In June 2007, Harvey married Marjorie Bridges, who he says is responsible for making him a better man and changing his life. Marjorie is a mother to three children (Morgan, Jason, and Lori), all of whom Steve adopted. They have five grandchildren: three through Jason&#x27;s marriage to his wife Amanda, one through Morgan&#x27;s marriage to her husband Kareem, and one through Karli&#x27;s marriage to her husband Ben. Through 2017, Harvey and his family divided their time between Atlanta, where his radio show was broadcast and &quot;Family Feud&quot; was recorded, and Chicago, where he hosted his talk show for NBCUniversal from the company&#x27;s Chicago studios, although he would host his radio show there as well. In 2018, Harvey moved his talk show, radio show, and &quot;Family Feud&quot; to Los Angeles.

In January 2017, Harvey was met with criticism from both within and outside of the black community for his decision to meet with then-President-elect Donald Trump. He defended his decision, citing that it would help spark positive changes.

Harvey is a Christian, and has attributed his success to his faith in God. Harvey is an advocate for religious harmony, expressing reverence especially to Islam, and the belief that &quot;to get to heaven, there&#x27;s gotta be more than one route.&quot; Harvey also reports that he has followed a vegan diet for health reasons and has presented the rationale for his diet on his TV program.

<text>Minkowski 2-9, abbreviated M2-9 (also known as Minkowski&#x27;s Butterfly, Twin Jet Nebula, the Wings of a Butterfly Nebula, or just Butterfly Nebula) is a planetary nebula that was discovered by Rudolph Minkowski in 1947. It is located about 2,100 light-years away from Earth in the direction of the constellation Ophiuchus. This bipolar nebula takes the peculiar form of twin of material that emanate from a central star. Astronomers have dubbed this object as the &quot;Twin Jet Nebula&quot; because of the jets believed to cause the shape of the lobes. Its form also resembles the wings of a butterfly. The nebula was imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope in the 1990s.

The primary component of the central binary is the hot core of a star that reached the end of its main-sequence life cycle, ejected most of its outer layers and became a red giant, and is now contracting into a white dwarf. It is believed to have been a sun-like star early in its life. The second, smaller star of the binary orbits very closely and may even have been engulfed by the other&#x27;s expanding stellar atmosphere with the resulting interaction creating the nebula. Astronomers theorize that the gravity of one star pulls some of the gas from the surface of the other and flings it into a thin, dense disk extending into space. As the central binary orbits with a period of about 86 to 120 years, the wind emitting from the binary changes direction with it.

The nebula has inflated dramatically due to a fast stellar wind, blowing out into the surrounding disk and inflating the large, wispy hourglass-shaped wings perpendicular to the disk. These wings produce the butterfly appearance when seen in projection. The outer shell is estimated to be about 1,200 years old .

<text>Watkins &quot;Wat&quot; Moorman Abbitt (May 21, 1908 – July 13, 1998) was an American politician and lawyer. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Virginia from February 17, 1948 to January 3, 1973. He was a top lieutenant within the Byrd Organization, the political machine named for its leader, U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd.

==Early and family life==
Abbitt was born in Lynchburg, Virginia to George Francis Abbitt and Otway C. Moorman Abbitt. He graduated from Appomattox Agricultural High School in Appomattox, Virginia in 1925. He earned an LL.B. from the University of Richmond in 1931 and began the practice of law in Appomattox. He married Corinne Hancock on March 20, 1937, and they had a son and two daughters who survived infancy.

==Career==
Upon admission to the Virginia bar, Abbitt had a private legal practice, and was also a bank executive. In 1931 he was elected Commonwealth&#x27;s attorney for Appomattox County and served from 1932 to 1948. He also was elected member of the Virginia Constitutional Convention in 1945.

=== Congress ===
When U.S. Representative Patrick H. Drewry died in office, Abbit won the special election to fill the vacancy. A Democrat, Abbitt won a full term later that year and 11 more times after that (February 17, 1948 – January 3, 1973). He was a member of the agriculture committee, and supported farm subsidies as well as fiscal conservatism and opposed increased federal intervention in state affairs. Abbitt became known for his opposition to school desegregation in the 1950s, supporting Massive Resistance alongside other Byrd Democrats. For instance, he denounced &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; as &quot;the naked and arrogant declaration of nine men.&quot; Abbitt signed the Southern Manifesto in 1956. Abbitt voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968 as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He was a delegate to the 1964 Democratic National Convention, and chairman of the state Democratic party from 1964-1970.

Abbitt announced his retirement after being redistricted into the same congressional district as fellow Democrat Dan Daniel, and Republican Robert Daniel won the seat in a 5-candidate general election field, becoming the first Republican to represent Southside Virginia in the century.

=== Endorsement of Douglas Wilder ===
Having long since recanted his segregationist views, Abbitt endorsed L. Douglas Wilder, who became Virginia&#x27;s first black governor in 1989. According to his son, state delegate Watkins Abbitt Jr., he and his sisters played a role in his father&#x27;s change of heart. Watkins Jr. noted that in his later years, his father always worked for free for any black church that needed legal services, and a black minister spoke at the funeral.

==Death and legacy==
Abbitt was married twice. His first wife of 52 years, Corinne, died in 1989 and Abbitt later married Mary Ann Schmidt who survived him when he died from leukemia in Lynchburg, Virginia on July 13, 1998. He maintained an active law practice as late as a week before his death. A park in Appomattox, Virginia is named for him.

His son, Watkins Abbitt Jr., served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1986 to 2012.

<doc id="524948" wikidata="Q428286" url="?curid=524948" title="Catholic emancipation">
<text>Catholic emancipation or Catholic relief was a process in the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, and later the combined United Kingdom in the late 18th century and early 19th century, that involved reducing and removing many of the restrictions on Roman Catholics introduced by the Act of Uniformity, the Test Acts and the penal laws. Requirements to abjure (renounce) the temporal and spiritual authority of the pope and transubstantiation placed major burdens on Roman Catholics.

The penal laws started to be dismantled from 1766. The most significant measure was the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, which removed the most substantial restrictions on Roman Catholicism in the United Kingdom.

The Act of Settlement 1701 and the Bill of Rights 1689 provisions on the monarchy still require the monarch of the United Kingdom to not be a Catholic. The Bill of Rights asserts that &quot;it hath been found by experience that it is inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this Protestant Kingdom to be governed by a Papist Prince&quot; and requires a new monarch to swear a coronation oath to maintain the Protestant religion.

The Act of Settlement 1701 went even farther limiting the succession to the heirs of the body of Sophia of Hanover, provided that they do not &quot;profess the Popish religion&quot;, &quot;marry a Papist&quot;, &quot;be reconciled to or ... hold Communion with the See or Church of Rome&quot;.

A Roman Catholic heir can therefore only inherit the throne by changing religious allegiance. Ever since the Papacy recognised the Hanoverian dynasty in January 1766, none of the immediate royal heirs has been a Roman Catholic, and thereby disallowed by the act. Many more distantly related potential Roman Catholic heirs are listed on the line of succession to the British throne. Section 2 of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, and similar provisions in the law of other signatories to the Perth Agreement, allow marriage by such an heir to a Roman Catholic.

==Initial reliefs==
In Canada, British since 1763, the Quebec Act 1774 ended some restrictions on Roman Catholics, so much so that it was called one of the &quot;Intolerable Acts&quot; and criticised in the Petition to George III submitted in October 1774 by the First Continental Congress of the Thirteen Colonies.

In Great Britain and, separately, in Ireland, the first Relief Act, called the Papists Act 1778, was passed; subject to an oath renouncing Stuart claims to the throne and the civil jurisdiction of the pope, it allowed Roman Catholics to own property and to inherit land. Reaction against this led to riots in Scotland in 1779 and then the Gordon Riots in London on 2 June 1780.

Further relief was given by an act of Parliament of 1782 allowing the establishment of Roman Catholic schools and bishops. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 allowed the free practice of Catholicism subject to certain substantial restrictions designed to make Catholicism less visible in the communities where it was practiced. In Ireland, the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1793 was enacted by the Irish Parliament, extending the right to vote to Catholics. Since the electoral franchise at the time was largely determined by property, this relief gave the votes to Roman Catholics holding land with a rental value of £2 a year. They also started to gain access to many middle-class professions from which they had been excluded, such as the legal profession, grand jurors, universities and the lower ranks of the army and judiciary.

==Act of Union with Ireland 1800==

The issue of greater political emancipation was considered in 1800 at the time of the Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland: it was not included in the text of the Act because this would have led to greater Irish Protestant opposition to the Union. Non-conformists also suffered from discrimination at this time.

William Pitt the Younger, the Prime Minister, had promised emancipation to accompany the Act. No further steps were taken at that stage, however, in part because of the belief of King George III that it would violate his Coronation Oath. Pitt resigned when the King&#x27;s opposition became known, as he was unable to fulfil his pledge. Catholic emancipation then became a debating point rather than a major political issue.

The increasing number of Irish Catholics serving in the British army led to the army giving freedom of worship to Catholic soldiers in 1811. Their contribution in the Napoleonic Wars may have contributed to the support of Wellington (himself Irish-born, though Protestant) for emancipation.

==Developments of the 1820s==
In 1823, Daniel O&#x27;Connell started a campaign for emancipation by establishing the Catholic Association. In 1828 he stood for election in County Clare in Ireland and was elected even though he could not take his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. 

O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s manoeuvres were important, but the decisive turning point came with the change in public opinion in Britain in favour of emancipation. Politicians understood the critical importance of public opinion. They were influenced as well by the strong support for the measure by the Whigs in the House of Lords and by the followers of Lord Grenville (1759–1834). The increasing strength of public opinion, as expressed in the newspapers and elections over a twenty-year period, overcame religious bias and deference to the crown, first in the House of Commons and then in the House of Lords. As Robert Peel pointed out to George IV in 1829, every House of Commons elected beginning in 1807 expressed majority support for Catholic emancipation, except that of 1818, which voted only once on the issue, in 1819, and rejected the motion by two votes. Despite this, the votes in the House of Lords were consistently negative, in part because of the king&#x27;s own opposition. The balance of opinion in the House of Lords shifted abruptly in 1828–29 in response to public opinion and O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s election, especially reflecting fear of a religious civil war in Ireland. The Sacramental Test Act 1828 removed the barrier that required certain public officials to be members of the established Church.

Finally, the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel changed positions to support the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. This act removed many of the remaining substantial restrictions on Roman Catholics throughout the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. However, at the same time the minimum property qualification for voters was increased, rising from a rental value of forty shillings (£2) per annum to £10 per annum, substantially reducing the number of those entitled to vote, although after 1832 the threshold was again lowered in successive Reform Acts. The major beneficiaries were the Roman Catholic middle classes, who could now enter careers in the higher civil service and in the judiciary. O&#x27;Connell was then re-elected and took his seat in Westminster. The year 1829 is therefore generally regarded as marking the chief moment of Emancipation in Britain and Ireland.

The obligation, however, to pay tithes to the established Anglican church in Ireland remained, resulting in the Tithe War of the 1830s, and many other minor disabilities remained. A series of further reforms were introduced over time.

==Political results==
The slowness of liberal reform between 1771 and 1829 led to much bitterness in Ireland, which underpinned Irish nationalism until recent times. Fresh from his success in 1829, O&#x27;Connell launched his Repeal Association in the 1830s and 1840s, hoping but failing to repeal the Acts of Union 1800.

It was not until the 1920s that the last of the disabilities were removed from the statute book by MP Francis Blundell.

==Comparative reforms in Europe==
The persecution of Huguenots under Louis XV had diminished by 1764. The dechristianisation of France in 1790–1801, the anti-Catholic in Germany in the 1870s and the progress of Jewish emancipation present interesting comparisons of toleration at the European level. Protestant sentiments in Ireland, on the other hand, were greatly alarmed by the possibility of Roman Catholic political influence on future governments, which brought about equally long-lasting bitter resistance by the Orange Order, alleging that &quot;Home Rule was Rome Rule&quot;. Liberal rights came slowly to the Papal States as well, and well-publicised cases such as the Mortara affair were a concern to liberals in America and Europe in the 1860s.

==Emancipation in Canada==
Roman Catholics in Quebec had a grandfathered level of religious freedom, including the ability to serve in that colony&#x27;s legislative body without having to take a Test Oath denouncing their faith. This policy continued in both successor provinces of Lower Canada and Upper Canada. The prohibitions and restrictions on Catholic participation in legislative affairs elsewhere in British North America applied until 1823, when Laurence Kavanagh was seated in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly as the first representative of Cape Breton Island and the first English-speaking Roman Catholic to serve in a legislature in the Atlantic provinces.

==Emancipation in Newfoundland==
The granting of Roman Catholic emancipation in Newfoundland was less straightforward than it was in Ireland, and this question had a significant influence on the wider struggle for a legislature. Almost from its first settlement, Newfoundland had a significant population of Roman Catholics, largely because George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, was the founding proprietor of the Province of Avalon on Newfoundland&#x27;s Avalon Peninsula. After Calvert himself converted to Roman Catholicism in 1625, he migrated to Avalon, intending his colony there to serve as a refuge for his persecuted fellow-religionists. Newfoundland, however, like Calvert&#x27;s other colony in the Province of Maryland, ultimately passed out of the Calvert family&#x27;s control, and its Roman Catholic population became subject to essentially the same religious restrictions that applied in other areas under British control. In the period from 1770 to 1800, the Governors of Newfoundland had begun to relax restrictions on Roman Catholics, permitting the establishment of French and Irish missions. On visiting St. John&#x27;s in 1786, Prince William Henry (the future King William IV) noted that &quot;there are ten Roman Catholics to one Protestant&quot;, and the Prince worked to counter the early relaxations of ordinances against this substantial majority.
News of emancipation reached Newfoundland in May 1829, and 21 May was declared a day of celebration. In St. John&#x27;s there was a parade and a thanksgiving Mass was celebrated at the Chapel, attended by the Benevolent Irish Society and the Catholic-dominated Mechanics&#x27; Society. Vessels in the harbour flew flags and discharged guns in salute.

Most people assumed that Roman Catholics would pass unhindered into the ranks of public office and enjoy equality with Protestants. But on 17 December 1829, the attorney general and supreme court justices decided that the Roman Catholic Relief Act did not apply to Newfoundland, because the laws repealed by the act had never applied there, being a colony and not part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. As each governor&#x27;s commission had been granted by royal prerogative and not by the statute laws of the British Parliament, Newfoundland had no choice but to be left with whatever existing local regulations discriminated against Roman Catholics.

On 28 December 1829 the St. John&#x27;s Roman Catholic Chapel was packed with an emancipation meeting, where petitions were sent from O&#x27;Connell to the British Parliament, asking for full rights for Newfoundland Roman Catholics as &quot;British subjects&quot;. More than any previous event or regulation, the failure of the British government to grant emancipation renewed the strident claims by Newfoundland Reformers for a colonial legislature. There was no immediate reaction from London, but the question of Newfoundland was now before the British Colonial Office. It was not until May 1832 that the British Secretary of State for the Colonies formally stated that a new commission would be issued to Governor Cochrane to remove any and all Roman Catholic disabilities in Newfoundland.

<doc id="524949" wikidata="Q2641750" url="?curid=524949" title="Battle of Goose Green">
<text>The Battle of Goose Green () was fought from 28 to 29 May 1982 by British and Argentine forces during the Falklands War. Located on East Falkland&#x27;s central isthmus, the settlement of Goose Green was the site of a tactically vital airfield. Argentine forces were located in a well-defended position within striking distance of San Carlos Water, where the British task force had positioned themselves after their amphibious landing.

The main body of the British assault force was composed of the 2nd Battalion Parachute Regiment (2 Para), commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert Jones. BBC Radio broadcast news of the imminent attack on Goose Green. Knowing that this had likely forewarned the Argentinian defenders, the broadcast resulted in immediate criticism from Jones and other British personnel.

After the attack began in the early hours of 28 May, the 2 Para advance was stalled by fixed trenches with interlocking fields of fire. Jones was killed during a solo charge on an enemy machine-gun post. The Argentinian garrison agreed to a ceasefire and formally surrendered the following morning. As a result of their actions, both Jones and his successor as commanding officer of the battalion, Major Chris Keeble, were awarded medals. Jones received a posthumous Victoria Cross, and Keeble received the Distinguished Service Order.

==Prelude==
===Terrain and conditions===
Goose Green and Darwin are on a narrow isthmus connecting Lafonia to the south with Wickham Heights in the north. The isthmus has two settlements: Darwin to the north, and Goose Green to the south. The terrain is rolling and treeless, and is covered with grassy outcrops, as well as areas of thick gorse and peat bogs, making camouflage and concealment extremely difficult. The islands have a cold, damp climate. From May to August (which is winter in the southern hemisphere), the ground is saturated and frequently covered with salty water, making walking slow and exhausting, particularly at night. Drizzly rains occur two out of every three days, with continuous winds, and with periods of rain, snow, fog, and sun changing rapidly. Sunshine is minimal, leaving few opportunities for troops to warm up and dry off.

===Background===
The bulk of the Argentine forces on the islands were in positions around Port Stanley, to the east of the isthmus and San Carlos, the site of the main British landings. An Argentinian force had been deployed to Goose Green and Darwin and was supported by artillery, mortars, 35 mm cannons, and machine guns. British intelligence incorrectly indicated that the Argentine force presented possessed limited offensive capabilities and did not pose a major threat to the landing area at San Carlos. Consequently, the Goose Green garrison seemed to have no strategic military value for the British in their campaign to recapture the islands and the initial plans for land operations had called for Goose Green to be isolated and bypassed.

After the British landings at San Carlos on 21 May and while the bridgehead was being consolidated, British activities were limited to digging fortified positions, patrolling, and waiting; during this time Argentine air attacks caused significant damage to, and the loss of, British ships in the area around the landing grounds. These attacks and the lack of breakout by the landed forces out of the San Carlos area led to a feeling among senior commanders and politicians in the UK that the momentum of the campaign was waning. As a result, British Joint Headquarters in the UK came under increasing pressure from the British government for an early ground offensive for political and propaganda value. There was also UN pressure for a cease-fire and the UK government position was that the taking of the Darwin–Goose Green isthmus was imperative before any such cease-fire decision as it would allow British forces to control access to the entire Lafonia and thus a significant portion of East Falkland. On 25 May Brigadier Julian Thompson, ground forces commander, commanding 3 Commando Brigade, was ordered to mount an attack on Argentine positions around Goose Green and Darwin.

===Argentine defenses===
The defending Argentine forces, known as Task Force Mercedes, consisted of two companies of Lieutenant-Colonel Ítalo Piaggi&#x27;s 12th Infantry Regiment (12IR). His third company (Company B) was still deployed on Mount Kent as &quot;Combat Team Solari&quot; and only re-joined 12IR after the fall of Goose Green airfield. The task force also contained a company of the Ranger-type 25th Infantry Regiment (25th &quot;Special&quot; Infantry Regiment or 25IR). Air defence was provided by a battery of six 20 mm Rheinmetall anti-aircraft guns, manned by air force personnel and two radar-guided Oerlikon 35 mm anti-aircraft guns from the 601st Anti-Aircraft Battalion. Both the 20mm and 35mm anti-aircraft cannon could also be used in a direct fire ground support role, and this was the case in the last stages of the fighting. There was also one battery of three OTO Melara Mod 56 105 mm pack howitzers from the 4th Airborne Artillery Regiment. Pucará aircraft, based at Stanley and armed with rockets and napalm could provide close air support. The total forces under Piaggi&#x27;s command numbered 1,083 men.

Piaggi&#x27;s role was to provide a reserve battle group (Task Force Mercedes) in support of other forces deployed to the west of Stanley and secondly to occupy and defend the Darwin isthmus as well as the Military Air Base Condor at Goose Green. He deployed the two companies in an all-round defence with A Company, 12IR the key to his defence; they were deployed along a gorse hedge running across the Darwin isthmus from Darwin Hill to Boca House. He deployed his recce platoon (under Lieutenant Carlos Marcelo Morales) as an advance screen forward of 12IR&#x27;s A Company, towards Coronation Ridge, while 12IR&#x27;s C Company were deployed south of Goose Green to cover the approaches from Lafonia. To substitute for the absent B Company, he created a composite company from headquarters and other staff and deployed them in Goose Green hamlet. 25IR&#x27;s C (Ranger) Company (under Paratroop-trained First Lieutenant Carlos Daniel Esteban) provided a mobile reserve, from the schoolhouse in Goose Green. Elements were also deployed to Darwin settlement, Salinas Beach, and Boca House and the air force security cadets, together with the anti-aircraft elements, were charged with protecting the airfield. Minefields had been laid in areas deemed tactically important, to provide further defence against attack.

On paper Piaggi had a full regiment, but it consisted of units from three separate regiments from two different brigades, none of whom had ever worked together. 12IR consisted mostly of conscripts from the northern, sub-tropical province of Corrientes, while the 25IR Company was considered an elite formation and had received commando training. Some elements were well trained and displayed a high degree of morale and motivation (C Company 25IR and A Battery 4th Airborne Artillery Group); with Lieutenant Ignacio Gorriti of B Company 12IR remarking that &quot;there was no need for speeches. From the beginning, we knew how important the Malvinas were. It was a kind of love; we were going to defend something that was ours.&quot; Other units were less well-motivated, with the 12th Regiment chaplain, Santiago Mora, writing:

The conscripts of 25th Infantry wanted to fight and cover themselves in glory. The conscripts of the 12th Infantry Regiment fought because they were told to do so. This did not make them any less brave. On the whole, they remained admirably calm.

Private Esteban Roberto Avalos fought in the Falklands as a sniper in 12IR&#x27;s B Company. In all, some fifty hand-picked 12th Regiment conscripts and NCOs had received Ranger-type training from visiting &quot;Halcón 8&quot; (Falcon 8) army commandos in 1981, and then returned to their respective companies:

In my particular case, I ended up being a sharpshooter for which I had been preparing since the time we were out in the field, where I had the opportunity to shoot with a FAL. During the 45 days we spent there, we had to practice shooting three or four times a week, and those moments were taken advantage of to learn the shooting positions and familiarize ourselves with the weapon. The dealings with the superiors, in general, were excellent, although if somebody screwed up, we all paid the price. The most common punishments were taking us to the showers at night, forcing us to do push-ups or demand from us heaps of frog leaps and crawling. If someone took the wrong step, for example, it was reasonable to be pulled out of training, and they would make you &#x27;dance&#x27; a little with push-ups on the thistles or the mud. Now, going back to the subject of instruction, I would say that it was generally satisfactory, at least as far as our group was concerned, since we had basic training in the use of explosives and we were even given some classes in self-defence.&quot;
The Argentine positions were well selected, and officers well briefed. In the weeks before the British invasion, airstrikes, naval bombardment, their own poor logistic support and inclement conditions had contributed to the erosion of morale amongst conscripts. However, morale remained strong among the 4th Airborne Artillery Regiment gunners as well the officers, NCOs, and Ranger-trained conscripts of the 12th and 25th Regiments. On 19 May, an Argentine Air Force C-130 Hercules parachuted in eight tons of tinned provisions that significantly boosted the morale of Task Force Mercedes.This parachute drop of supplies, according to Private Domingo Víctor Álamo, allowed the 25th Regiment&#x27;s C Company to get two servings of rations and soft drinks on 25 May while celebrating Argentine independence day.

At the start of the battle, the Argentinian forces had about the same number of effective combatants as the British paratroopers.

===British forces===

Thompson ordered 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment (2 Para) to conduct an attack on Goose Green, as they were the unit closest to the isthmus in the San Carlos defensive perimeter. He ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert &#x27;H&#x27; Jones, the commanding officer of 2 Para, to &quot;carry out a raid on Goose Green isthmus and capture the settlements before withdrawing to be in reserve for the main thrust to the north.&quot; The &quot;capture&quot; component appealed more to Jones than the &quot;raid&quot; component, although Thompson later acknowledged that he had assigned insufficient forces to rapidly execute the &quot;capture&quot; part of the orders.

2 Para consisted of three rifle companies, one patrol company, one support company, and an HQ company. Thompson had assigned three 105 mm artillery pieces, with 960 shells from 29 Commando Regiment, Royal Artillery; one MILAN anti-tank missile platoon; and Scout helicopters as air support. Close air support was available from three Royal Air Force Harriers and naval gunfire support was to be provided by in the hours of darkness.

===Attack plan===
An SAS survey had reported that the Darwin–Goose Green area was occupied by one Argentine company. Brigade intelligence reported that enemy forces consisted of three infantry companies (two from 12IR and one from 25IR), one platoon from 8IR, plus a possible amphibious platoon together with artillery and helicopter support. Jones was not too perturbed by the conflicting intelligence reports and, incorrectly, tended to believe the SAS reports on the assumption that they were actually &quot;on the spot&quot; and were able to provide more accurate information than the brigade intelligence staff. Based on this intelligence and the orders from Thompson, Jones planned the operation to be conducted in six phases, as a complicated night-day, silent-noisy attack (see Map 1):

# C Company was to secure the start line, and then;
# A Company was to launch the attack from the start line on the left (Darwin) side of the isthmus;
# B Company would then launch their attack from the start line directly after A Company had initiated contact and would advance on the right (Boca House) side of the isthmus;
# Once A and B companies had secured their initial objectives, D Company would advance from the start line between A and B companies and were to take defence positions once having reached their objective.
# This would be followed by C Company, who would pass through D Company and neutralise any remaining Argentine reserves;
# C Company would then advance again and clear the Goose Green airfield and the settlements of Darwin and Goose Green would be secured by A and D companies respectively.

As most of the helicopter airlift capability had been lost with the sinking of , 2 Para were required to march the from San Carlos to the forming-up place at Camilla Creek House. C Company and the Commando engineers moved out from the forming-up place at 22:00 on 27 May to clear the route to the start line for the other companies. A firebase (consisting of air and naval fire controllers, mortars, and snipers) was established by Support Company west of Camilla Creek, who were in position by 02:00 on the morning of 28 May. The three guns from 8 Battery, their crew, and ammunition had been flown into Camilla Creek House by 20 Sea King helicopter sorties after last light on the evening of 27 May. The attack was to be initiated by A Company and was scheduled to start at 03:00, but because of delays in registering the support fire from , the attack only commenced at 03:35.

===Initial contact===

As part of the diversionary raids to cover the British landings in the San Carlos area on 21 May the British conducted a naval bombardment and launched air attacks on Goose Green. In addition &#x27;D&#x27; Squadron of the SAS mounted a major raid to simulate a battalion-sized attack on A Company 12IR, who were dug in on Darwin Ridge. The SAS raid was launched from their assembly point on Mount Usborne,

The following day, 22 May, four RAF Harriers armed with cluster bombs were launched from to attack the fuel dumps and Pucarás at Condor airfield at Goose Green. The Harriers met intense anti-aircraft fire during their attack. 
On the night of 26–27 May, two rifle platoons from Manresa&#x27;s A Company mounted a retaliatory raid on the SAS positions on Mount Usborne, but on reaching the summit were surprised to find that the SAS had already vacated the feature. The next day Sub-Lieutenant Ernesto Orlando Peluffo on Darwin Ridge spotted British troops conducting reconnaissance patrols and with his 12IR platoon fired on the patrol with long-range machine-gun fire in the hours before the start of the attack.

Throughout 27 May, Royal Air Force Harriers were active over Goose Green. One of them, responding to a call for help from Captain Paul Farrar&#x27;s C (Patrols) Company, was lost to 35mm fire while attacking Darwin Ridge. The preliminary fire, probing patrols and SAS raid, the Harrier attacks, the sighting of the forward British paratroopers, and the BBC announcing that the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment was poised and ready to assault Darwin and Goose Green the day before the assault alerted the Argentine garrison to the impending attack.

==Battle==
===Darwin Parks===

At 3:35am opened fire, firing a total of 22 star shells and 135 rounds of 4.5&quot; high-explosive shells during a 90-minute bombardment, signalling the start of the attack.

This is contradicted by Corporal John Geddes of &#x27;C&#x27; Company however, who stated HMS Arrow fired one star shell then signalled &#x27;gun out&#x27; and returned to the Task Force. The attacking British companies also received support from the gunners of 8 (Alma) Battery, who fired about 1,000 rounds mostly in the night action. Major Philip Neame along with his D Company examined the forward Argentine platoon positions and concluded that several Argentines had been killed in the initial parachute infantry assault or softening up bombardment, &quot;With nothing else to occupy us, we took closer stock of our immediate surroundings. Around us lay a dozen dead Argentinians – the product of B Company&#x27;s earlier advance, or perhaps the work of HMS Arrow&#x27;s gun before she cleared off.&quot;
2 PARA&#x27;s A Company, under command of Major Dair Farrar-Hockley, were first to advance after the completion of the preparatory fire from HMS &quot;Arrow&quot; (which was off-target and ineffective). They were to take Burntside House as their first objective. They came under fire from Argentine positions close to the house but managed to reach the objective without any casualties, finding that it was occupied by four Falklanders and that the house itself had never been held by the Argentine forces. They were instructed to wait at Burntside House, instead of exploiting their favourable position and advancing further.

B Company, under the command of Major John Crossland, followed in the next phase of the attack and were to secure Burntside Hill and then continue to Boca Hill. Where A Company had advanced down the left-side of the isthmus, B Company were to follow the coast on the right-side of the attack. After a significant delay, they advanced and initially encountered very little resistance in the forward trenches. Approaching Burntside Hill, they exchanged fire with the Argentine defenders and on reaching the top of the hill, they found the first positions empty. The Argentine account states that the platoons of Sub-Lieutenants Marcelo Martin Bracco and Alejandro Garra from the 12th Regiment&#x27;s A Company came under heavy probing fire and the platoons withdrew after the initial clashes. The 2nd Rifle Platoon (under Sub-Lieutenant Gustavo Adolfo Malacalza) from A Company fought a delaying action against the British paratroopers before withdrawing to new positions on Darwin Ridge. The Paras in No. 5 Platoon (under Lieutenant Geoffrey Weighell) from B Company were forced to use white phosphorus (WP) grenades against Malacalza&#x27;s men after discovering their fragmentation grenades were largely ineffective in clearing trenches in the night action.

The Coronation Ridge position temporarily halted Major Neame&#x27;s D Company as they advanced between A and B companies. They encountered heavy fire from an Argentine machine-gun which was attacked and silenced by two paratroopers, for which they would be awarded decorations for bravery. With this machine gun out of action, D Company were able to continue to clear the Argentine platoon position on Coronation Ridge (under 2nd Lieutenant Marcelo Bracco) but lost three men (Lance-Corporals Anthony Cork, Gary Bingley and Private Mark Fletcher) killed in taking the hill. According to Major Crossland, 2 PARA lost nearly 3 hours in the advance through Goose Green Parks, having to clear two Argentine platoon positions in the dark. During the night action, Major Crosland and his second-in-command (Captain John Young) were very nearly killed or seriously wounded when two Argentine artillery or mortar rounds landed between them but failed to explode.

At around 7:30 am the 1st Rifle Platoon from the 25IR C Company, under the command of 2nd Lieutenant Roberto Estévez, received orders to counterattack against 2 Para&#x27;s B Company. The Argentine platoon was able to block the British advance by taking up positions on Darwin Hill, from which, although wounded, Estévez started calling down fire support from Argentine 105mm artillery and 120mm mortars. This indirect fire held up the advance of 2 Para&#x27;s A Company, especially as they were in open ground on the forward slope of the hill as they prepared to take up their advance once again. A Company was forced to take cover in the nearby trenches. Estévez continued to direct the Argentine artillery fire until he was killed by sniper fire. 2nd Lieutenant Roberto Estévez and his radio operator, Private Fabricio Edgar Carrascul were both posthumously decorated for their actions Private Guillermo Huircapán from Estévez&#x27;s platoon describes the morning action:

Lieutenant Estévez went from one side to the other organizing the defence until all at once they got him in the shoulder. But with that and everything, badly wounded, he kept crawling along the trenches, giving orders, encouraging the soldiers, asking for everyone. A little later, they got him in the side, but just the same, from the trench, he continued directing the artillery fire by radio. There was a little pause, and then the English began the attack again, trying to advance, and again we beat them off.
The British A Company assault had been stopped by fire from a 12IR platoon (under Sub-Lieutenant Ernesto Peluffo) after their platoon sergeant (Buenaventura Jumilla) had observed the British approach and yelled out a warning. Major Farrar-Hockley then spotted Argentine reinforcements on the hills before him and shouted, &quot;Ambush! Take cover!&quot; just as the 12IR platoon&#x27;s machine-guns opened fire. British reconnaissance patrols had reported wrongly that the Argentine defenders lacked overhead cover. In reality, their trenches had good roofing and all the reports of a demoralised and unwilling enemy proved to be unfounded. &quot;All this rubbish about them not wanting to fight&quot;, Major Keeble told British reporters grudgingly. Admitting that &quot;They were fighting hard.&quot; The Royal Engineer officer attached to Farrar-Hockley&#x27;s company, Lieutenant Clive Livingstone, wrote about the initial fight for Darwin Hill:

A massive volume of medium machine-gun fire was unleashed on us from a range of about 400 metres. The light now rapidly appearing enabled the enemy to identify targets and bring down very effective fire. Although this too would work for us, the weight of fire we could produce was not in proportion to the massive response it brought. We stopped firing — our main concern was to move away whenever pauses occurred in the attention being paid to us. The two platoons were not able to suppress the trenches, which were giving us so much trouble. We took about 45 minutes to extract ourselves through the use of smoke and pauses in the firing.
The A Company Paras were in the gorse line at the bottom of Darwin Hill facing the entrenched Argentines, who were looking down the hill at them. They were pinned down by heavy machine gun and automatic rifle fire as well as sniper fire for an hour, between 9 and 10 am. 2 Para&#x27;s B Company also broke off their attacks and began to withdraw to the reverse side of Middle Hill and the base of Coronation Point. Their defence and the re-organisation of the attack was organised by 2 Para&#x27;s second-in-command. The British A and B Companies could not get across the open ground to get at the Argentine machine-guns and snipers and after five hours of fighting, their ammunition supply was becoming critical. Nevertheless, the paras with Spanish-speaking Royal Marines Captain Roderick Bell forward with them, using a loudspeaker called on the Argentines to surrender.

===Death of H. Jones===
With both A and B Companies&#x27; advance halted and the entire attack in jeopardy, the 2 Para Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jones led an unsuccessful charge up a small gully to try to regain the initiative. Three of his men, his adjutant Captain Wood, A Company&#x27;s second-in-command Captain Dent, and Corporal Hardman, were killed when they followed his charge. Shortly after that, Jones was seen to run west along the base of Darwin Ridge to a small re-entrant, followed by his bodyguard. He checked his Sterling submachine gun, then ran up the hill towards an Argentine trench. He was seen to be hit once, then fell, got up, and was hit again from the side. He fell metres short of the trench, shot in the back and the groin, and died within minutes. Jones was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

As Jones lay dying, his men radioed for urgent casualty evacuation. However, the British Scout helicopter sent to evacuate Jones was shot down by an Argentine FMA IA 58 Pucará ground-attack aircraft (this was to be the only Argentine air-to-air victory of the war). The pilot, Lieutenant Richard Nunn RM was killed and posthumously received the DFC, and the aircrewman, Sergeant Bill Belcher RM was severely wounded in both legs. While returning from this attack, the Pucará (A-537) crashed into Blue Mountain and its pilot, , was killed. His remains were not recovered until 1986 and the cause of the crash remains unknown.

Jones&#x27; death was attributed to an Argentine Army commando sniper identified as Corporal Osvaldo Faustino Olmos. However, historian Hugh Bicheno attributed Jones&#x27; death to Corporal José Luis Ríos of the 12th Regiment&#x27;s Reconnaissance Platoon that had fallen back from the earlier fighting in Darwin Parks. Ríos was later fatally wounded manning a machine-gun in his trench by Abols, who fired a 66mm rocket.

With the death of Jones, command passed to Major Chris Keeble. Following the failure of this initial attack and the death of Jones, it took Keeble an additional two hours to reorganize and resume the attack. Former Para officer and military theorist Spencer Fitz-Gibbon wrote in 1995 that despite his undoubted courage, H. Jones did more to hinder than to help 2 Para, losing sight of the overall battle picture and failing to allow his sub-unit commanders to exercise mission command, before his fatal attempt to lead A Company forward from the position where they had become bogged down.

=== Darwin Hill ===

By the time of Jones&#x27; death it was 10:30, and Major Dair Farrar-Hockley&#x27;s A Company made a third attempt to advance, but this petered out. Eventually the British company, hampered by the morning fog as they advanced up the slope of Darwin Ridge, were driven back to the gully by fire from the survivors of the 1st Platoon from 25IR&#x27;s C Company. During that morning&#x27;s fighting 2 Para&#x27;s mortar crews fired over 1,000 rounds to support the attacks, preventing the Argentines&#x27; fire from being properly aimed. Many of the Argentine fatalities during the fighting were caused by mortar fire.

The Argentines requested close air-support and were expecting a strike by 12 Argentine Air Force Skyhawk and four Dagger fighter-bombers in support of the Darwin Ridge defenders. The 12th Regiment&#x27;s A Company Sergeant-Major Juan Coelho spread out white bedsheets in front of the trenches to mark the front line of Argentine troops but was severely wounded in the process. On their approach to the islands the Argentine flight of five Skyhawks from the first wave observed the British hospital ship &quot;Uganda&quot; and lost considerable time reporting and investigating the presence of the red-cross marked ship. The Skyhawk pilots, having lost much fuel and flying in bad weather, then carried out a poorly executed bomb run in support of the Darwin defenders but mistakenly attacked Argentine positions as they released their bombs. The Skyhawks were engaged by Argentine anti-aircraft fire that damaged the lead aircraft.

It was almost noon before the British advance resumed. A Company cleared the eastern end of the Argentine position and opened the way forward towards Goose Green settlement. Sub-Lieutenant Guillermo Ricardo Aliaga&#x27;s 3rd Platoon of 8IR&#x27;s C Company held Boca Hill but by 13:47 and after fierce fighting, the position was taken by Major John Crosland&#x27;s B Company, with support from the MILAN anti-tank platoon.

About the time of the final attack on the Boca House position, A Company overcame the Argentine defenders on Darwin Hill, finally reporting taking it at 13:13 local time, and advanced to take Boca Hill. With 2nd Lieutenant Estévez killed and the other two platoon commanders (Sub-Lieutenants Peluffo and Aliaga) involved badly wounded, Corporal Osvaldo Olmos ordered the survivors of the rifle platoon from the 25th Regiment to wave a white T-shirt from a rifle and surrender, ending all resistance on the part of the Argentines holding Darwin Ridge. Under the watchful eyes of the Paras, the survivors of Estévez &#x27;s platoon were permitted to smoke from their army issued cigarette packs as well as consume the chocolate bars and caramels the Argentine soldiers had brought with them.

After securing Boca Hill, the battle for Darwin Ridge was over and the Paras had secured their interim objectives after six hours of fighting, with grievous loss: the commanding officer, the adjutant, A Company Second-in-Command, and nine non-commissioned officers and soldiers were killed and 30 wounded. Corporal David Abols later said that an Argentine sniper (Corporal Osvaldo Olmos) who killed or wounded seven Paras with head-shots during the morning fighting was mainly responsible for holding up the British battalion. &quot;This sniper fire was responsible for the deaths of at least seven paratroopers, according to Abols – &#x27;all headshots. That is the main reason A Company was stuck.&quot;

=== Attack on the airfield ===
After securing Darwin Ridge, C and D Companies began to make their way to the small airfield, as well as to Darwin School (to the east of the airfield), while B Company made their way south of Goose Green Settlement. A Company remained on Darwin Hill. C Company took heavy losses when they became the target of intense direct fire from 35mm anti-aircraft guns from Goose Green. Private Mark Hollman-Smith, a signaller in the company headquarters, was killed by anti-aircraft fire while trying to recover a heavy machine gun from wounded Private Steve Russell. C Company&#x27;s commander, Major Roger Jenner, his signaller and eight other men were also wounded.

In the airfield itself, Argentine Air Force anti-aircraft gunners (under Lieutenant Darío Del Valle Valazza) from the 1st Anti-Aircraft Group (&quot;Grupo 1 de Artillería Antiaérea&quot; or G1AA) and the 12IR platoon under Sub-Lieutenant Carlos Oslvaldo Aldao, attempted to halt the renewed advance from Boca Hill, but eventually they were forced to abandon their positions, including the five remaining 20mm Rheinmetall guns at Cóndor airfield, having earlier lost one of these guns to naval shelling as well as the Elta radar to MILAN missiles or mortar fire. A large part of the 12IR platoon was overrun and forced to surrender, but Aldao, along with a corporal, managed to escape in the confusion of the Argentine airstrikes that materialised later that afternoon. With Lieutenant Valazza wounded in the fighting, Second Lieutenant Arnaldo Favre took over the 1st Anti-Aircraft Group and ordered the anti-aircraft gunners to destroy with hand grenades their 20mm anti-aircraft guns before withdrawing to Goose Green Settlement.
Private John Graham, from Lieutenant Chris Waddington&#x27;s No. 11 Platoon, claimed that Lieutenant Barry and Corporal Sullivan, during a local truce, went forward to accept the Argentine surrender at the airfield and that the defenders suddenly opened fire without warning, killing Barry and wounding Sullivan, with one Argentine crawling forward to Sullivan and shooting him at point-blank range:
... I saw the white flag incident; I was in 11 Platoon. We were going up the hill, and the flag went up. The officer [Barry] called the sergeant [sic] and then got halfway up the hill. Bang! They let rip into them, Killed them. One guy [Corporal Paul Sullivan] was hit in the knee, and one of the bastards came forward and shot him in the head. He moved forward out of his position and shot him.
According to Sub-Lieutenant Gómez-Centurión:

I set out with thirty-six men toward the north. Passing the school, we entered a depression from which we saw the hill. I sent a scouting party ahead, and they told me that the British were advancing from the other side of the low ridge, some one hundred and fifty men. [My] men were very tense; there was a brutal cold; we shivered with cold, with fear. When they were about fifty metres away, we opened fire. We kept firing for at least forty minutes. They started to attack our flank, my soldiers had to take cover, the firing went down, and the situation started to become critical. Then we were surrounded, we had wounded, people started to lose control. I began to ask about casualties, each time, more casualties. There was no way out behind because we had been flanked, nearly surrounded. So when there was a pause in the firing, I decided that it was the time to stop, and I gave the order to disengage.
Sergeant John Meredith as second-in-command of No. 12 Platoon conducted a counterambush, saving the lives of five of his men pinned down be enemy fire. The citation for his Distinguished Conduct Medal reads:

With conspicuous gallantry and presence of mind, Meredith rapidly assumed command of the platoon, organised covering fire for the trapped men and stabilised the situation. He then personally took a machine gun and moved forward under heavy enemy fire to where he could neutralise the remainder of the enemy and give directions to extricate the trapped men. There is no doubt that these five men owe their lives to Meredith&#x27;s prompt and gallant action. Subsequently the platoon under his direction captured the enemy position.

The 25IR platoon defending the airfield fell back into the Darwin-Goose Green track and was able to escape. Sergeant Sergio Ismael Garcia of 25IR armed with a machine-gun, single-handedly covered the withdrawal of his platoon during the British counterattack. He was posthumously awarded the Argentine Nation to the Valour in Combat Medal. Under orders from Major Carlos Alberto Frontera (second in command of 12IR), Sub-Lieutenant César Álvarez Berro&#x27;s 12IR platoon took up new positions and helped cover the retreat of Gómez-Centurión&#x27;s platoon still dragging their wounded along the Darwin-Goose Green track.

Four Paras of D Company and approximately a dozen Argentines were killed in these engagements. Among the British dead were 29-year-old Lieutenant Barry and two NCOs, Lance-Corporal Smith and Corporal Sullivan, who were killed after Barry&#x27;s attempt to convince Sub-Lieutenant Gómez-Centurión to surrender was rebuffed. C Company did not lose a single man in the Darwin School fighting, but Private Steve Dixon, from D Company, died when a splinter from a 35mm anti-aircraft shell struck him in the chest. The Argentine 35mm anti-aircraft guns under the command of Sub-Lieutenant Claudio Oscar Braghini reduced the schoolhouse to rubble after sergeants Mario Abel Tarditti and Roberto Amado Fernandez reported to him that sniper fire was coming from the building.

At around this time, three British Harriers attacked the Argentine 35 mm gun positions; the army radar-guided guns were unable to respond effectively because a piece of mortar shrapnel had earlier struck the generator for the firearms and fire-control radar. This attack considerably lifted morale among the British paras. Although it was not known at the time, the Harriers came close to being shot down in their bomb run after being misidentified as enemy aircraft by Lieutenant-Commander Nigel Ward and Flight Lieutenant Ian Mortimer of 801 Squadron. According to Lieutenant Braghini&#x27;s report, and at least one British account, the Harrier strike missed their intended target, but the Argentine antiaircraft guns were already out of action anyway.

Meanwhile, the 12IR platoon—under Sub-Lieutenant Orlando Lucero, a platoon that Lieutenant-Colonel Piaggi and Major Frontera had personally organised, using survivors from the earlier fighting—took up positions on Goose Green&#x27;s outskirts and continued to resist. Supporting air force Pucará and navy Aermacchi aircraft also struck the forward British companies. The Argentine pilots did not have much effect, suffering two losses: at 5:00, when a Macchi 339A (CANA 1 squadron) was shot down by a Blowpipe missile from the Royal Marines&#x27; air defence troop, killing Sub-Lieutenant Daniel Miguel.

Just about 10 minutes later, another Argentine aircraft, a Pucará this time, was shot down by small arms fire from 2 Para, drenching several paratroopers with fuel and napalm, which did not ignite. Lieutenant Miguel Cruzado survived and was captured by British forces on the ground.

===Situation at last light on 28 May===
By last light, the situation for 2 Para was critical. A Company was still on Darwin Hill, north of the gorse hedge; B Company had penetrated much further south and had swung in a wide arc from the western shore of the isthmus eastwards towards Goose Green. They were isolated and under fire from an Argentinian platoon and unable to receive mutual support from the other companies. To worsen their predicament, Argentine helicopters—a Puma, a Chinook and six Hueys—landed southwest of their position, just after last light, bringing in the remaining Company B of 12IR (&quot;Combat Team Solari&quot;) from Mount Kent.

B Company managed to bring in artillery fire on these new Argentine reinforcements, forcing them to disperse towards the Goose Green settlement, while some re-embarked and left with the departing helicopters. For C Company, the attack had also fizzled out after the battle at the school-house, with the company commander injured, the second-in-command unaccounted for, no radio contact, and the platoons scattered with up to 1,200 metres between them. D Company had regrouped just before last light, and they were deployed to the west of the dairy—exhausted, hungry, low on ammunition, and without water. Food was redistributed, for A and C Companies to share one ration-pack between two men; but B and D Companies could not be reached. At this time, a British helicopter casualty evacuation flight took place, successfully extracting C Company casualties from the forward slope of Darwin Hill, while under fire from Argentine positions.

To Keeble, the situation looked precarious: the settlements had been surrounded but not captured, and his companies were exhausted, cold, and low on water, food, and ammunition. His concern was that the Argentine 12IR B Company reinforcements, dropped by helicopter, would either be used in an early morning counter-attack or used to stiffen the defences around Goose Green. He had seen the C Company assault stopped in its tracks by the anti-aircraft fire from Goose Green, and had seen the Harrier strikes of earlier that afternoon missing their intended targets. In an order group with the A and C Company commanders, he indicated his preference for calling for an Argentine surrender, rather than facing an ongoing battle the following morning. His alternative plan, if the Argentines did not surrender, was to &quot;flatten Goose Green&quot; with all available fire-power and then launch an assault with all forces possible, including reinforcements he had requested from Thompson. On Thompson&#x27;s orders, J Company of 42 Commando, Royal Marines, the remaining guns of 8 Battery, and additional mortars were helicoptered in to provide the necessary support.

===Surrender===
Once Thompson and 3 Brigade had agreed to the approach, a message was relayed by CB radio from San Carlos to Mr. Eric Goss, the farm manager in Goose Green—who, in turn, delivered it to Piaggi. The call explained the details of a planned delegation who would go forward from the British lines, bearing a message, to the Argentine positions in Goose Green. Piaggi agreed to receive the delegation. Soon after midnight, two Argentine Air Force warrant-officer prisoners of war (PW) were sent to meet with Piaggi and to hand over the proposed terms of surrender. The conditions read:

# That you unconditionally surrender your force to us by leaving the township, forming up aggressively, removing your helmets, and laying down your weapons. You will give prior notice of this intention by returning the PW under a white flag with him briefed as to the formalities by no later than 0830 hrs local time.
# You refuse in the first case to surrender and take the inevitable consequences. You will give prior notice of this intention by returning the PW without his flag (although his neutrality will be respected) no later than 0830 hrs local time.
# In the event and by the terms and conditions of the Geneva Convention and Laws of War, you will be held responsible for the fate of any civilians in Darwin and Goose Green, and we by these terms do give notice of our intention to bombard Darwin and Goose Green.

On receiving the terms, Piaggi concluded:
The battle had turned into a sniping contest. They could sit well out of range of our soldiers&#x27; fire and, if they wanted to, raze the settlement. I knew that there was no longer any chance of reinforcements from the 6th Regiment&#x27;s B Company (Compañía B &#x27;Piribebuy&#x27;). So I suggested to Wing Commander [Vice Commodore] Wilson Pedrozo that he talk to the British. He agreed reluctantly.

The next morning, an agreement for an unconditional surrender was reached. Pedrozo held a short parade, and those on show then laid down their weapons. After burning the regimental flag, Piaggi led the troops and officers, carrying their personal belongings, into captivity.

==Aftermath==
===Impact on the campaign===
In the week preceding the attack, the Argentinians had sunk four British ships, including the &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; containing vital air-lift helicopters essential for the re-capture of Stanley. This led the British government to question the lack of movement by their ground-forces and London needed a sign of progress. The victory at Goose Green accomplished the political purpose of sustaining public support in Britain by a badly needed victory and the success marked a turning point in the campaign, as it emphasised the Argentine failure to thwart the establishment of a beachhead and subsequent breakout into the island. The Argentines had counted on achieving at least a stalemate through air attacks and ground defences, if not stopping the landings altogether. From this point onwards, the British forces were to retain the initiative in all successive battles.

===Prisoners and casualties===
Between 45 and 55 Argentines were killed (57 according to Major Alberto Frontera, second-in-command of the 12th Regiment ) with 32 from RI 12, 13 from Company C RI 25, five killed in the platoon from RI 8, 4 Air Force staff, and one Navy service member and 86 were recorded as wounded. 
The remainder of the Argentine force was taken prisoner with 140 Argentine wounded evacuated to hospital ships via the medical post in San Carlos. Argentine dead were buried in a cemetery to the north of Darwin; military chaplain Mora and sub-lieutenants Bracco and Gómez-Centurión assisted burying the army dead with Second Lieutenant Arnaldo Favre from the 1st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group tasked with collecting the air force dead. Prisoners were used to clear the battlefield. In an incident, while moving artillery ammunition, the 2nd Rifle Platoon (under Sub-Lieutenant Leonardo Durán) from RI 12&#x27;s C Company was engulfed in a massive explosion that left 5 dead or missing and 10 seriously wounded. In an interview in April 2022, Durán clarified that the actual losses in the explosion were three men (Privates Rafael Barrios, Víctor Rodríguez and José Ramón Ferrau) killed and ten men (the officer along with Privates Raúl Vallejos, Ricardo Pinatti, Ángel Urban, Ricardo Jakuisuk, Gerardo Fernández, Luis Spinberger, Hugo Duarte, Francisco Ocampo and Martín Flores) wounded in his platoon.

After clearing the area, the prisoners were marched to, and interned in, San Carlos.

The British lost 18 killed (16 Paras, one Royal Marine pilot, and one commando sapper) and 64 wounded with nearly 50 requiring operations under general anaesthetic.
The seriously injured were evacuated to the hospital ship much to the relief of 2 Para&#x27;s medical officer (Captain Steve Hughes) who thought that 47 badly wounded Paras had succumbed to their injuries at the British field dressing station in San Carlos.
By 3 June, the Gurkhas were deployed at Darwin and Goose Green. They were used in helicopter-borne operations to find Argentine patrols operating on the southern flank of the British advance to Port Stanley. This resulted in an encounter with a 10-man army–air force patrol (under Lieutenant Jaime Enrique Ugarte from the Argentine Air Force&#x27;s 1st Anti-Aircraft Group, and Sergeant Roberto Daniel Berdugo from the 12th Regiment) that had been helicoptered to Egg Harbour House, an abandoned farmhouse in Lafonia, to shoot down British aircraft with SA-7 shoulder-launched missiles. On 7 June, a Sea King arrived with 20 Gurkhas to clear this outpost. On being ordered to lie down to be searched by the Gurkhas, all the wet and hungry Argentine soldiers, including Sergeant Berdugo, did so, except the air force officer. A Gurkha rifleman, brandishing a 10&quot; Kukri blade, threatened the air force officer with beheading, then Lieutenant Ugarte obeyed.

===Commanders===
Lieutenant-Colonel Ítalo Ángel Piaggi surrendered his forces in Goose Green on the Argentinian National Army Day (29 May). After the war, he was forced to resign from the army, and faced ongoing trials questioning his competence at Goose Green. In 1986, he wrote a book titled &quot;Ganso Verde&quot;, in which he strongly defended his decisions during the war and criticised the lack of logistical support from Stanley. In his book, he said that Task Force Mercedes had plenty of 7.62mm rifle ammunition left, but had run out of 81mm mortar rounds; and there were only 394 shells left for the 105mm artillery guns. On 24 February 1992, after a long fight in both civil and military courts, Piaggi had his retired military rank and pay reinstated, as a full colonel. He died in July 2012.

Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert &#x27;H&#x27; Jones was buried at Ajax Bay on 30 May; after the war, his body was exhumed and transferred to the British cemetery in San Carlos. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

Major Chris Keeble, who took over command of 2 Para when Jones was killed, was awarded the DSO for his actions at Goose Green. Keeble&#x27;s leadership was one of the key factors that led to the British victory, in that his flexible style of command and the autonomy he afforded to his company commanders were much more successful than the rigid control, and adherence to plan, exercised by Jones. Despite sentiment among the soldiers of 2 Para for him to remain in command, he was superseded by Lieutenant-Colonel David Robert Chaundler, who was flown in from the UK to take command of the battalion.

==BBC incident==
During the planning of the assault of both Darwin and Goose Green, the battalion headquarters were listening in to the BBC World Service, when the newsreader announced that the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment was poised and ready to assault Darwin and Goose Green. This caused great trepidation among the commanding officers of the battalion, with fears that the operation was compromised. Jones became furious with the level of incompetence and told BBC representative Robert Fox he was going to sue the BBC, Whitehall, and the War Cabinet.

==Field punishments==
In the years after the battle, Argentine army officers and NCOs were accused of handing out brutal field punishment to their troops at Goose Green, and other locations, during the war. In 2009, Argentine authorities in Comodoro Rivadavia ratified a decision made by authorities in Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego, announcing their intention to charge 70 officers and NCOs with inhumane treatment of conscript soldiers during the war.

There was, however, false testimony that was used as evidence in accusing the Argentine officers and NCOs of abandonment; and Pablo Vassel, who had denounced the alleged perpetrators, had to step down from his post as head of the human rights sub-secretariat of Corrientes Province. Other veterans were sceptical about the veracity of the accusations, with Colonel José Martiniano Duarte, an ex–601 Commando Company officer and decorated veteran of the Falklands War, saying that it had become &quot;fashionable&quot; for ex-conscripts to accuse their superiors of abandonment. Since the 2009 announcement was made, no one in the military, or among the retired officers and NCOs, has been charged, causing Vassel to comment in April 2014:

&quot;For over two years we&#x27;ve been waiting for a final say on behalf of the courts ... There are some types of crimes that no state should allow to go unpunished, no matter how much time has passed, such as the crimes of the dictatorship. Last year Germany sentenced a 98-year-old corporal for his role in the concentration camps in one of the Eastern European countries occupied by Nazi Germany. It didn&#x27;t take into account his age or rank.&quot;&quot;

<text>James Chipman Fletcher (June 5, 1919 – December 22, 1991) served as the 4th and 7th Administrator of NASA, first from April 27, 1971, to May 1, 1977, under Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, and again from May 12, 1986, to April 8, 1989, under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. As such, he was responsible for Apollo Moon missions 15, 16, and 17, the early planning of the Space Shuttle program, and later for the shuttle program&#x27;s recovery and return to flight after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; accident. Prior to this, he was president of the University of Utah from 1964 to 1971.

==Biography==
Fletcher was born in Millburn, New Jersey, to Harvey Fletcher and Lorena Chipman. His father, Harvey, is known as the &quot;Father of Stereophonic sound&quot;. Fletcher earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from Columbia College of Columbia University and a PhD in physics (1948) from the California Institute of Technology. After holding research and teaching positions at Harvard and Princeton Universities, he joined Hughes Aircraft in 1948 and later worked at the Guided Missile Division of the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation. In 1958, Fletcher co-founded the Space Electronics Corporation in Glendale, California, which, after a merger, became the Space General Corporation. He was later named systems vice president of the Aerojet General Corporation in Sacramento, California. In 1964, he became president of the University of Utah, a position he held until he was named NASA Administrator by President Richard M. Nixon in 1971.

During his first administration at NASA, Fletcher was responsible for beginning the Space Shuttle effort, as well as the Viking program that sent landers to Mars. He oversaw the Skylab missions and approved the Voyager space probes and the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project.

When he left NASA in 1977, Fletcher became an independent consultant in McLean, Virginia, and served on the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh. For nine years, he was active as an advisor to key national leaders involved in planning space policy. Among other activities, he served on an advisory board involved in developing the Strategic Defense Initiative.

In 1986, President Ronald Reagan selected Fletcher to administer NASA for a second time, to help the agency recover from the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; accident. Shuttle flights went into a two-year hiatus while Fletcher ensured that NASA reinvested heavily in the program&#x27;s safety and reliability, made organizational changes to improve efficiency, and restructured its management system. He oversaw a complete reworking of the components of the Shuttle to enhance its safety, including a redesign of the solid rocket boosters, and added an egress method for the astronauts. The Space Shuttle returned to flight on September 29, 1988. Fletcher also approved the Hubble Space Telescope program.

<doc id="524955" wikidata="Q712630" url="?curid=524955" title="Jóhannes úr Kötlum">
<text>Jóhannes úr Kötlum (born Jóhannes Bjarni Jónasson; November 4, 1899 – April 27, 1972) was an Icelandic author/poet and a member of parliament. He is one of the most loved Icelandic poets – not least for his verse for children and how beautifully his words flow in the Icelandic language making them ideal for songs. His poems have been a constant inspiration for composers, songwriters and musicians in Iceland. More than two hundred songs and compositions have been written based on his poems, some of them performed by internationally acclaimed artists such as Björk performing the song &quot;The Christmas Cat&quot;.

One of the salient figures of modern Icelandic poetry, Jóhannes mastered both the intricate traditional forms and the modern, but as an outspoken, idealistic and sometimes scathing critic of political institutions, he courted controversy and often drew the ire of political opponents. Jóhannes began his career as a neo-romantic poet in the 1920s, but later became a leading force among the radical poets of the depression era. After WWII he revolted against the traditional form, renewing his poetry through his originality and artistry. He was a spokesman for peace throughout his life and fought vigorously against Iceland&#x27;s occupation by foreign armies.

==Life==
Jóhannes was born in 1899 at Goddastaðir farmstead, near the head of Hvammsfjörður in the Dales of Northwestern Iceland. Despite poverty, Jóhannes was educated and graduated as a primary school teacher in 1921, a profession he practiced for more than a decade, first in the countryside and then in Reykjavík. From then on he worked as an editor and an author, first in Reykjavík and then in 1940 when he moved to Hveragerði, a small town in the South of Iceland which became known as the Artists Colony in the 1940s. He moved back to Reykjavík in 1959 where he lived from then on.

==Works==
In 1932, Jóhannes úr Kötlum published his best-loved children&#x27;s book: &quot;Jólin koma&quot; (Christmas is Coming – Verse for Children). One of the poems in the book, &quot;The Yuletide-Lads,&quot; reintroduced Icelandic society to Yuletide folklore and established what is now considered the canonical thirteen Yuletide-lads or Yule Lads, their personalities and connection to other folkloric characters. Since then &quot;Christmas is Coming&quot; has been an integral part of Icelandic Christmas traditions and helped preserve age-old folklore in modern culture. A seasonal bestseller from the start, few other books have been reprinted as many times in Iceland.

==Awards and nominations==
Jóhannes received awards for his celebratory verses in the Parliament Millennium Celebrations of 1930 and the Republic of Iceland Festivities in 1944. He was awarded the Silver Horse, the Icelandic Newspapers Literature Award, in 1970. He was nominated twice for the Nordic Council Literature Prize; in 1966 and 1973.

<text>Isandlwana () (older spelling &quot;Isandhlwana&quot;, also sometimes seen as &quot;Isandula&quot;) is an isolated hill in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. It is located north by northwest of Durban. The name is said to mean abomasum, the second stomach of the cow, because it reminded the Zulus of its shape.

==History==
This mountain has historical significance. On 22 January 1879, Isandlwana was the site of the Battle of Isandlwana, where approximately 22,000 Zulu warriors defeated a contingent of approximately 1,750 British and African troops in one of the first engagements of the Anglo-Zulu War. The Zulu force was primarily under the command of Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza. The battle was one of the worst defeats suffered by the British Army during the Victorian era.

Isandlwana hill (28°21′32″S 30°39′9″E) rises due east of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, a ford on the Buffalo River, a tributary of the Tugela River.

<text>The Probation Service (formerly the National Probation Service) for England and Wales is a statutory criminal justice service, mainly responsible for the supervision of offenders in the community and the provision of reports to the criminal courts to assist them in their sentencing duties. It was established in its current form by the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act in April 2001, but has existed since 1907 as a set of area-based services interacting at arm&#x27;s length with central government.

The current Probation Service was created on 26 June 2021 following the Ministry of Justice withdrawing the contracts of 21 privately-run Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs).

The service is part of His Majesty&#x27;s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) which transferred to the Ministry of Justice from the Home Office on 9 May 2007. It comprises 42 probation areas which are coterminous with police force area boundaries, served by 35 probation trusts. Trusts are funded by HMPPS and employ all staff except the chief officer; they are accountable to their boards (comprising up to fifteen members appointed by the Secretary of State) for day-to-day operations and financial management, and to HMPPS via a Regional Offender Manager with whom they have service level agreements, for performance against the targets for the offender management and interventions services for which they have been funded.

The work of probation trusts is scrutinised by HMPPS which reports independently to UK government ministers and by HM Inspectorate of Probation. There are concerns that staff shortages, failure in communication and privatisation may be weakening the probation service and putting the public at risk.

Northern Ireland has its own probation service, whilst in Scotland criminal justice social work services are managed within the social work departments of local authorities.

== History ==
The Church of England Temperance Society and other voluntary societies appointed missionaries to the London police courts during the late nineteenth century. From this developed the system of releasing offenders on the condition that they kept in touch with the missionary and accepted guidance. In 1907 this supervision was given a statutory basis which allowed courts to appoint and employ probation officers.

The service, at the start of 2004, had some 18,000 staff. Statistics for the year 2002 state that it supervised just less than 193,000 offenders and provided 253,000 pre-sentence reports to courts in England and Wales, advising them on the background of and proposing appropriate sentences for convicted offenders. In addition, it has responsibility for ensuring that victims of violent and sexual crime resulting in prison sentences of over 12 months are consulted before offenders are released from custody.

The advent of NOMS in 2004 changed the pattern of correctional services delivery in England and Wales. The Offender Management Bill, introduced in Parliament late in 2006, was intended to enable probation areas to become trusts as part of wider government policy to open up the provision of correctional services to greater competition from the voluntary, community, and private sectors. This was one of the recommendations of the Carter Report (2003): others were to introduce a system of &quot;end-to-end offender management&quot;, with one named offender manager having responsibility for an offender throughout his or her sentence (be it in custody, the community, or both), and to &quot;rebalance sentencing&quot; in order to redress the drift towards less and less serious offences resulting in imprisonment or community sentences. Carter saw the need to improve public and sentencer confidence not only in community sentences but also in the fine as credible sanctions for appropriate offenders and offences.

The Bill completed its passage through Parliament in July 2007, and the first six probation trusts came into being on 1 April 2008 (Merseyside, South Wales, Humberside, Dyfed/Powys, West Mercia and Leicestershire &amp; Rutland). Lancashire Probation Trust achieved Trust status on 1 April 2009.

==Criticism==
An article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggests privatisation of the probation service was done in haste, underfunded and is failing. Probation is being used less because judges and magistrates have lost confidence in the privatised probation system.

The probation service in London is understaffed and many probation officers are inexperienced. Probationers are seen too infrequently and some are overlooked. A proper risk assessment is not done in the majority of cases. Privatisation of probation service continues to produce &quot;troubling&quot; results. The Chief Inspector of Probation disclosed that probation supervision for one in four low-risk offenders in Gwent is no more than a phone call every six weeks. HM Inspectorate of Probation maintains half of cases have no proper assessment of risk of harm. Junior officers working for Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) sometimes manage over 200 cases each though at most 60 can be managed safely.

Not enough is done to supervise former prisoners after release from jail and discourage reoffending. Glenys Stacey, Chief Inspector of Probation said, &quot;Although there are exceptions, the community rehabilitation companies... are not generally producing good quality work, not at all.&quot;

The Justice Select Committee said the &#x27;Transforming Rehabilitation&#x27; programme had brought the probation system into a &quot;mess&quot;, staff morale was at an &quot;all-time low&quot; and newly released prisoners got &quot;wholly inadequate&quot; support. The committee said that splitting the service between a national body and 21 rehabilitation companies lead to a two-tier system, reducing voluntary sector involvement. MPs said the companies&#x27; efforts to reduce re-offending is &quot;disappointing&quot; and some staff are not trained to deal with cases they are assigned. Perpetrators of domestic abuse are inadequately supervised by private companies, putting tens of thousands of victims and their families at risk. The staff of privatised offender supervision companies do not have the skill, experience or time to supervise perpetrators. HM Inspectorate of Probation found in 71% of cases, there was insufficient victim protection. Glenys Stacey stated private Community Rehabilitation Companies were &quot;nowhere near effective enough.&quot; Katie Ghose of Women&#x27;s Aid said, &quot;This report shows that community rehabilitation companies are failing victims, with a significant lack of understanding about domestic abuse, especially coercive control. Probation officers are routinely underestimating the ongoing danger posed to the victim and not reassessing the level of risk involved when circumstances change. The findings of this report show that CRCs are currently not fit for purpose when it comes to domestic abuse cases and we call on the government to urgently change this to protect survivors&quot;. Too few perpetrators of domestic abuse are referred to courses to help them manage relationships better and those who do too frequently do not complete the course.

Serious offences committed by people supervised by the probation service have increased markedly. Richard Burgon said, &quot;All too often probation appears stretched to breaking point and struggling to fulfil its fundamental role of keeping the public safe. The Conservatives&#x27; irresponsible decision to break up and privatise much of probation has put huge pressures on the system. The government urgently needs to explain how it plans to tackle this extremely worrying rise in serious offences committed by offenders&quot;.

Suicides by people the Probation Service manages have risen by 19% from 283 in 2017–18 to 337 in 2018–19, and amounted to 31% of all deaths of offenders in the community. Deborah Coles of INQUEST said, &quot;These figures are deeply disturbing and require urgent scrutiny due to the current lack of independent investigation. What is known is that people are being released into failing support systems, poverty and an absence of services for mental health and addictions. This is state abandonment. This is the violence of austerity.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Isandlwana (alternative spelling: Isandhlwana) on 22 January 1879 was the first major encounter in the Anglo-Zulu War between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. Eleven days after the British invaded Zululand in Southern Africa, a Zulu force of some 20,000 warriors attacked a portion of the British main column consisting of approximately 1,800 British, colonial and native troops with approximately 350 civilians. The Zulus were equipped mainly with the traditional assegai iron spears and cow-hide shields, but also had a number of muskets and antiquated rifles. 

The British and colonial troops were armed with the modern Martini–Henry breechloading rifle and two 7-pounder mountain guns deployed as field guns, as well as a Hale rocket battery. The Zulus had a vast disadvantage in weapons technology, but they greatly outnumbered the British and ultimately overwhelmed them, killing over 1,300 troops, including all those out on the forward firing line. The British were unprepared for the attack from the large Zulu contingent, which had moved quickly, and were attacked along the flanks by the Zulus using their traditional &#x27;horns and chest of the buffalo&#x27; formation. The Zulu army suffered anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 killed.

The battle was a decisive victory for the Zulus and caused the defeat of the first British invasion of Zululand. The British Army had suffered its worst defeat against an indigenous foe equipped with vastly inferior military technology. Isandlwana resulted in the British taking a much more aggressive approach in the Anglo–Zulu War, leading to a heavily reinforced second invasion, and the destruction of King Cetshwayo&#x27;s hopes of a negotiated peace.

==Background==
Following the scheme by which Lord Carnarvon had brought about the Confederation of Canada through the 1867 British North America Act, it was thought that a similar plan might succeed in South Africa and in 1877 Sir Henry Bartle Frere was appointed as High Commissioner for Southern Africa to instigate the scheme. Some of the obstacles to such a plan were the presence of the independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand, both of which the British Empire would attempt to overcome by force of arms.

Bartle Frere, on his own initiative, without the approval of the British government and with the intent of instigating a war with the Zulu, had presented an ultimatum to the Zulu king Cetshwayo on 11 December 1878 with which the Zulu king could not possibly comply. When the ultimatum expired a month later, Bartle Frere ordered Lord Chelmsford to proceed with an invasion of Zululand, for which plans had already been made.

==Prelude==
Lord Chelmsford, the Commander-in-Chief of British forces during the war, initially planned a five-pronged invasion of Zululand consisting of over 16,500 troops in five columns and designed to encircle the Zulu army and force it to fight as he was concerned that the Zulus would avoid battle, slip around the British and over the Tugela, and strike at Natal. Lord Chelmsford settled on three invading columns with the main centre column, now consisting of some 7,800 men, under his direct command. The centre column comprised No. 3 Column, commanded by Colonel Richard Thomas Glyn, and Colonel Anthony Durnford&#x27;s No. 2 Column. Chelmsford moved his troops from Pietermaritzburg to a forward camp at Helpmekaar, past Greytown. On 9 January 1879 they moved to Rorke&#x27;s Drift, and early on 11 January commenced crossing the Buffalo River into Zululand.
The backbone of the British force under Lord Chelmsford consisted of twelve regular infantry companies: six each of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, the 24th Regiment of Foot (which was subsequently renamed the South Wales Borderers). These were regarded as hardened and reliable troops. In addition, there were approximately 2,500 local African auxiliaries of the Natal Native Contingent, many of whom were exiled or refugee Zulu. They were led by European officers, but were considered generally of poor quality by the British as they were prohibited from using their traditional fighting technique and inadequately trained in the European method as well as being indifferently armed. Also, there were some irregular colonial cavalry units, and a detachment of artillery consisting of six field guns and several Congreve rockets. Adding on wagon drivers, camp followers and servants, there were around 4,700 men in the No. 3 Column, and around 3,100 men in the No. 2 Column that composed the main centre column. Colonel Anthony Durnford took charge of No. 2 Column with orders to stay on the defensive near the Middle Drift of the Tugela River. Because of the urgency required to accomplish their scheme, Bartle Frere and Chelmsford began the invasion during the rainy season. This had the consequence of slowing the British advance to a crawl.
The Zulu army, while a product of a warrior culture, was essentially a militia force which could be called out in time of national danger. It had a very limited logistical capacity and could only stay in the field a few weeks before the troops would be obliged to return to their civilian duties. Zulu warriors were armed primarily with &quot;assegai&quot; thrusting spears, known in Zulu as &quot;iklwa&quot;, knobkierrie clubs, some throwing spears and shields made of cowhide. The Zulu warrior, his regiment and the army drilled in the personal and tactical use and coordination of this weapons system. Some Zulus also had old muskets and antiquated rifles stockpiled, a relatively few of which were carried by Zulu impi. However, their marksmanship was very poor, quality and supply of powder and shot dreadful, maintenance non-existent and attitude towards firearms summed up in the observation that: &quot;The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms – the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the poltroon to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.&quot; The British had timed the invasion to coincide with the harvest, intending to catch the Zulu warrior-farmers dispersed. Fortunately for Cetshwayo, the Zulu army had already begun to assemble at Ulundi, as it did every year for the &quot;First Fruits&quot; ceremony when all warriors were duty-bound to report to their regimental barracks near Ulundi.

Cetshwayo sent the 24,000 strong main Zulu impi from near present-day Ulundi, on 17 January, across the White Umfolozi River with the following command to his warriors: &quot;March slowly, attack at dawn and eat up the red soldiers.&quot;

On 18 January, some 4,000 warriors, under the leadership of Mavumengwana kaNdlela Ntuli, were detached from the main body to meet with Dabulamanzi kaMpande and attack Charles Pearson&#x27;s No. 1 Column near Eshowe. The remaining 20,000 Zulus camped at the isiPhezi ikhanda. The next day, the main force arrived and camped near Babanango Mountain, then moved the next day to a camp near Siphezi Mountain. Finally, on 21 January they moved into the Ngwebeni Valley, where they remained concealed, planning to attack the British on 23 January, but they were discovered by a scouting party on 22 January. Under the command of Ntshigwayo kaMahole the Zulu army had reached its position in easy stages. It marched in two columns within sight of each other, but a few miles apart to prevent a surprise attack. They were preceded by a screening force of mounted scouts supported by parties of warriors 200–400 strong tasked with preventing the main columns from being sighted. The speed of the Zulu advance compared to the British was marked. The Zulu impi had advanced over in five days, while Chelmsford had only advanced slightly over in 10 days.

The British under Chelmsford pitched camp at Isandlwana on 20 January, but did not follow standing orders to entrench. No laager (circling of the wagons) was formed. Chelmsford did not see the need for one, stating, &quot;It would take a week to make.&quot; But the chief reason for the failure to take defensive precautions appears to have been that the British command severely underestimated the Zulus&#x27; capabilities. The experience of numerous colonial wars fought in Africa was that the massed firepower of relatively small bodies of professional European troops, armed with modern firearms and artillery and supplemented by local allies and levies, would march out to meet the natives whose poorly equipped armies would put up a fight but in the end would succumb. Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with Martini–Henry rifles, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as Brown Bess muskets. Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied Chelmsford&#x27;s thoughts. Rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked, his main concern was managing the huge number of wagons and oxen required to support his forward advance.

Once he had established the camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent to scout ahead. They skirmished with elements of a Zulu force which he believed to be the vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was his confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, departing the camp at dawn on January 22 with approximately 2,800 soldiers—including half of the British infantry contingent, together with around 600 auxiliaries—to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle so as to achieve a decisive victory, and leaving the remaining 1,300 men of the No. 3 Column to guard the camp. It never occurred to him that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.

Chelmsford left behind approximately 600 British red coat line infantry – five companies, around 90 fighting men in each, of the 1st Battalion and one stronger company of around 150 men from the 2nd Battalion of the 24th Regiment of Foot to guard the camp, under the command of Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Henry Pulleine. Pulleine&#x27;s orders were to defend the camp and wait for further instructions to support the general as and when called upon. Pulleine also had around 700 men composed of the Natal Native Contingent, local mounted irregulars, and other units. He also had two artillery pieces, with around 70 men of the Royal Artillery. In total, over 1,300 men and two artillery guns of the No. 3 Column were left to defend the camp excluding civilian auxiliaries.
Pulleine, left in command of a rear position, was an administrator with no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Nevertheless, he commanded a strong force, particularly the six veteran regular infantry companies, which were experienced in colonial warfare. The mounted vedettes, cavalry scouts, patrolling some from camp reported at 7:00 am that groups of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Pulleine received further reports during the early morning, each of which noted movements, both large and small, of Zulus. There was speculation among the officers whether these troops were intending to march against Chelmsford&#x27;s rear or towards the camp itself.

Around 10:30 am, Colonel Anthony Durnford, whose left arm was paralyzed from wounds sustained at Bushman&#x27;s River Pass during the pursuit of Chief Langalibalele, arrived from Rorke&#x27;s Drift with 500 men of the Natal Native Contingent and a rocket battery of the No. 2 Column to reinforce the camp at Isandlwana. This brought the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition should have assumed command. However, he did not over-rule Pulleine&#x27;s dispositions and after lunch he quickly decided to take the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford&#x27;s rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.

Chelmsford had underestimated the disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and confident Zulus. The failure to secure an effective defensive position, the poor intelligence on the location of the main Zulu army, Chelmsford&#x27;s decision to split his force in half, and the Zulus&#x27; tactical exploitation of the terrain and the weaknesses in the British formation, all combined to prove catastrophic for the troops at Isandlwana. In contrast, the Zulus responded to the unexpected discovery of their camp with an immediate and spontaneous advance. Even though the indunas lost control over the advance, the warriors&#x27; training allowed the Zulu troops to form their standard attack formation on the run, with their battle line deployed in reverse of its intended order.

==Battle==
The Zulu Army was commanded by &quot;Umtwana&quot; (Prince) Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza and &quot;Umtwana&quot; Mavumengwana kaNdlela Ntuli. The &quot;inDuna&quot; Dabulamanzi kaMpande, half brother of Cetshwayo, commanded the Undi Corps after Zibhebhu kaMaphitha, the regular &quot;inkhosi&quot;, or commander, was wounded.

While Chelmsford was in the field seeking them, the entire Zulu army had outmanoeuvred him, moving behind his force with the intention of attacking the British Army on 23 January. Pulleine had received reports of large forces of Zulus throughout the morning of 22 January from 8:00am on. Vedettes had observed Zulus on the hills to the left front, and Lt. Chard, while he was at the camp, observed a large force of several thousand Zulu moving to the British left around the hill of Isandlwana. Pulleine sent word to Chelmsford, which was received by the general between 9:00 am and 10:00 am. The main Zulu force was discovered at around 11:00 am by men of Lt. Charles Raw&#x27;s troop of scouts, who chased a number of Zulus into a valley, only then seeing most of the 20,000 men of the main enemy force sitting in total quiet. This valley has generally been thought to be the Ngwebeni some from the British camp but may have been closer in the area of the spurs of Nqutu hill. Having been discovered, the Zulu force leapt to the offensive. Raw&#x27;s men began a fighting retreat back to the camp, and a messenger was sent to warn Pulleine.

The Zulu adopted their traditional pitched battle formation, known as the &#x27;horns and chest of the buffalo&#x27;, with the aim of encircling the British position. From Pulleine&#x27;s vantage point in the camp, at first only the right horn and then the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine sent out first one, then all six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu attack head-on and checking it with firepower. Durnford&#x27;s men, upon meeting elements of the Zulu centre, had retreated to a donga, a dried-out watercourse, on the British right flank where they formed a defensive line. The rocket battery under Durnford&#x27;s command, which was not mounted and dropped behind the rest of the force, was isolated and overrun very early in the engagement. The two battalions of native troops were in Durnford&#x27;s line; while all their British officers and NCOs carried rifles, only one in 10 of the native soldiers under their command had a firearm, and those few weapons were muzzle-loading muskets with limited ammunition. Many of the native troops began to leave the battlefield at this point.

Pulleine only made one change to the original disposition after about 20 minutes of firing, bringing in the companies in the firing line slightly closer to the camp. For an hour or so until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting many casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The Martini–Henry rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the Royal Artillery forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.

Durnford&#x27;s men, who had been fighting the longest, began to withdraw and their rate of fire diminished. Durnford&#x27;s withdrawal exposed the right flank of the British regulars, which, with the general threat of the Zulu encirclement, caused Pulleine to order a withdrawal back to the camp. The regulars&#x27; retreat was performed with order and discipline and the men of the 24th conducted a fighting withdrawal into the camp. Durnford&#x27;s retreat, however, exposed the flank of G Company, 2nd/24th, which was overrun relatively quickly.

=== Solar eclipse ===
There was a solar eclipse on that day, at 2:30 pm. An officer in advance of Chelmsford&#x27;s force gave this eyewitness account of the final stage of the battle at about 3:00 pm:
Nearly the same moment is described in a Zulu warrior&#x27;s account.
=== Zulu victory ===
The presence of large numbers of bodies grouped together suggests the resistance was more protracted than originally thought, and a number of desperate last stands were made. Evidence shows that many of the bodies, today marked by cairns, were found in several large groups around the camp – including one stand of around 150 men. A Zulu account describes a group of the 24th forming a square on the neck of Isandlwana. Colonial cavalry, the NMP and the carabiniers, who could easily have fled as they had horses, died around Durnford in his last stand, while nearby their horses were found dead on their picket rope. What is clear is that the slaughter was complete in the area around the camp and back to Natal along the Fugitive&#x27;s Drift. The fighting had been hand-to-hand combat and no quarter was given to the British regulars. The Zulus had been commanded to ignore the civilians in black coats and this meant that some officers, whose patrol dress was dark blue and black at the time, were spared and escaped.

Once their ammunition had been expended, surviving British soldiers had no choice but to fight on with bayonet and rifle butt. A Zulu account relates the single-handed fight by the guard of Chelmsford&#x27;s tent, a big Irishman of the 24th who kept the Zulus back with his bayonet until he was speared and the general&#x27;s Union flag captured. Both the colours of the 2nd 24th were lost, while the Queen&#x27;s colour of the 1st 24th was carried off the field by Lieutenant Melvill on horseback but lost when he crossed the river, despite Lieutenant Coghill having come to his aid. Both Melvill and Coghill were killed after crossing the river, and received posthumous Victoria Crosses in 1907 as the legend of their gallantry grew, and, after twenty-seven years of steady campaigning by the late Mrs. Melvill (who had died in 1906), on the strength of Queen Victoria being quoted as saying that &#x27;if they had survived they would have been awarded the Victoria Cross&#x27;. Garnet Wolseley, who replaced Chelmsford, felt otherwise at the time and stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t like the idea of officers escaping on horseback when their men on foot are being killed.&quot;

Of the 1,800-plus force of British troops and African auxiliaries, over 1,300 were killed, most of them Europeans, including field commanders Pulleine and Durnford. Only five Imperial officers survived (including Lieutenants Henry Curling and Horace Smith-Dorrien), and the 52 officers lost was the most lost by any British battalion up to that time. Amongst those killed was Surgeon Major Peter Shepherd, a first-aid pioneer. The Natal Native Contingent lost some 400 men, and there were 240 lost from the group of 249 amaChunu African auxiliaries. Perhaps the last to die was Gabangaye, the portly chief of the amaChunu Natal Native Contingent, who was given over to be killed by the &quot;udibi&quot; (porter or carrier) boys. The captured Natal Native Contingent soldiers were regarded as traitors by the Zulu and executed.

There was no casualty count of the Zulu losses by the British such as made in many of the other battles since they abandoned the field. Nor was there any count by the Zulu. Modern historians have rejected and reduced the older unfounded estimates. Historians Lock and Quantrill estimate the Zulu casualties as &quot;... perhaps between 1,500 and 2,000 dead. Historian Ian Knight stated: &quot;Zulu casualties were almost as heavy. Although it is impossible to say with certainty, at least 1,000 were killed outright in the assault...&quot; Historian Mike Snook estimated 1,500-2,000 Zulu dead, with a similar number wounded.

Some 1,000 Martini-Henry rifles, the two field artillery guns, 400,000 rounds of ammunition, three colours, most of the 2,000 draft animals and 130 wagons, provisions such as tinned food, biscuits, beer, overcoats, tents and other supplies, were taken by the Zulu or left abandoned on the field. Of the survivors, most were from the auxiliaries. The two field artillery guns which were taken to Ulundi as trophies, were later found abandoned by a British patrol after the Battle of Ulundi.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
The Zulus avoided the dispersal of their main fighting force and concealed the advance and location of this force until they were within a few hours&#x27; striking distance of the British. When the location of the main Zulu Impi was discovered by British scouts, the Zulus immediately advanced and attacked, achieving tactical surprise. The British, although they now had some warning of a Zulu advance, were unable to concentrate their central column. It also left little time and gave scant information for Pulleine to organise the defence. The Zulus had outmanoeuvred Chelmsford and their victory at Isandlwana was complete and forced the main British force to retreat out of Zululand until a far larger British Army could be shipped to South Africa for a second invasion.

Recent historians, notably Lock and Quantrill in &quot;Zulu Victory&quot;, argue that from the Zulu perspective the theatre of operations included the diversions around Magogo Hills and Mangeni Falls and that these diversions, which drew more than half of Chelmsford&#x27;s forces away from Isandlwana, were deliberate. Also, the main Zulu force was not unexpectedly discovered in their encampment but was fully deployed and ready to advance on the British camp. These historians&#x27; view of the expanded battlefield considers Chelmsford to have been the overall commander of the British forces and that responsibility for the defeat lies firmly with him.


Debate persists as to how and why the British lost the battle. Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the strategic lapses and failings in grand tactics on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat. The initial view, reported by Horace Smith-Dorrien, was that the British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough.&quot;The box lids were screwed down, the screws were rusty and difficult to remove, there were too few screwdrivers, standing orders insisted that until a box was empty, no other boxes were to be opened, and the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10–12 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution.

Donald Morris in &quot;The Washing of the Spears&quot; argues that the men, fighting too far from the camp, ran out of ammunition, starting first with Durnford&#x27;s men who were holding the right flank and who had been in action longer, which precipitated a slowdown in the rate of fire against the Zulus. This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line were not sufficient. A different view, supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook&#x27;s works, (the latter having written &quot;How Can Man Die Better?&quot;), suggests that, although Durnford&#x27;s men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. The discovery of the British line so far out from the camp has led Ian Knight to conclude that the British were defending too large a perimeter.

The official interrogation by Horse Guards under the direction of the Duke of Cambridge, the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief, in August 1879, concluded that the primary cause of the defeat was the &quot;under estimate formed of the offensive fighting power of the Zulu army&quot;, additionally the investigation questions Chelmsford as to why the camp was not laagered and why there was a failure to reconnoitre and discover the nearby Zulu army. Colenso calls Chelmsford&#x27;s neglecting to follow his own &quot;Regulations for Field Forces in South Africa&quot;, which required that a defensible camp be established at every halt, fatal.

Numerous messages, some quite early in the day, had been sent to Chelmsford informing him, initially, of the presence of the Zulu near the camp and, subsequently, of the attack on the camp, with increasingly urgent pleas for help. The most egregious failure to respond occurred at around 1:30 pm when a message from Hamilton-Browne stating, &quot;For God&#x27;s sake come back, the camp is surrounded, and things I fear are going badly&quot;, was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Harness of the Royal Artillery and Major Black of the 2/24. They were leading the other four RA guns as well as two companies of the 2/24 and on their own initiative immediately marched back towards Isandlwana and had gone some two miles when they were ordered to return to Mangeni Falls by an aide sent by Chelmsford.

At long last but too late, finally Chelmsford became convinced of the seriousness of the situation on his left flank and rear when at 3:30pm he joined Hamilton-Browne&#x27;s NNC and realised the camp had been taken. Meanwhile, an NNC officer, Rupert Lonsdale, who had left Chelmsford&#x27;s force to get rations for his men, had found the camp in Zulu hands and experienced a narrow escape. When Lonsdale reached Chelmsford and described the camp&#x27;s fall, Chelmsford replied, &quot;But I left over 1,000 men to guard the camp&quot;. He quickly gathered his scattered forces and marched the column back to Isandlwana but arrived at sundown long after the battle ended and the Zulu army had marched off. The British camped on the field that night but left before sunrise without any examination of the ground as Chelmsford felt that it would demoralize his troops. The column then proceeded to Rorke&#x27;s Drift.
Though Isandlwana was a disaster for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the defeat of Chelmsford&#x27;s central column, the invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and draught animals were lost. As King Cetshwayo feared, the embarrassment of the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.

The Zulus may have missed an opportunity to exploit their victory and possibly win the war that day on their own territory. The reconnaissance force under Chelmsford was more vulnerable to being defeated by an attack than the camp. It was strung out and somewhat scattered, it had marched with limited rations and ammunition it could not now replace, and it was panicky and demoralized by the defeat at Isandlwana.

Near the end of the battle, about 4,000 Zulu warriors of the unengaged reserve Undi impi, after cutting off the retreat of the survivors to the Buffalo River southwest of Isandlwana, crossed the river and attacked the fortified mission station at Rorke&#x27;s Drift. The station was defended by only 140 British soldiers, who nonetheless inflicted considerable casualties and repelled the attack. Elsewhere, the left and right flanks of the invading forces were now isolated and without support. The No. 1 column under the command of Charles Pearson was besieged for two months by a Zulu force led by kaMpande and Mavumengwana, at Eshowe, while the No. 4 column under Evelyn Wood halted its advance and spent most of the next two months skirmishing in the northwest around Tinta&#x27;s Kraal.

Following Isandlwana and Rorke&#x27;s Drift, the British and Colonials were in complete panic over the possibility of a counter invasion of Natal by the Zulus. All the towns of Natal &#x27;laagered&#x27; up and fortified and provisions and stores were laid in. Bartle Frere stoked the fear of invasion despite the fact that, aside from Rorke&#x27;s Drift, the Zulus made no attempt to cross the border. Immediately following the battle, Zulu Prince Ndanbuko urged them to advance and take the war into the colony but they were restrained by a commander, kaNthati, reminding them of Cetshwayo&#x27;s prohibiting the crossing of the border. Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of Natal, Cetshwayo, still hoping to avoid outright war, had prohibited any crossing of the border in retaliation and was incensed over the violation of the border by the attack on Rorke&#x27;s Drift.

The British government&#x27;s reasoning for a new invasion was threefold. The first was the loss of national pride as a result of the defeat, and the desire to avenge it by winning the war. The second concerned the domestic political implications at the next parliamentary elections held in Britain. However, despite the second invasion attempt, the British Prime Minister Disraeli and his Conservative Party lost the 1880 general election. The final reason concerned the Empire; unless the British were seen to win a clear-cut victory against the Zulus, it would send a signal to the outside world that the British Empire was vulnerable to the point where the destruction of a British field army could alter the policy of Britain&#x27;s government. The British government was concerned that the Zulu victory could inspire imperial unrest, particularly among the Boers, and as such sought to quash any such possibilities by swiftly defeating the Zulu Kingdom.

After Isandlwana, the British field army in South Africa was heavily reinforced and again invaded Zululand. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent to take command and relieve Chelmsford, as well as Bartle Frere. Chelmsford, however, avoided handing over command to Wolseley and managed to defeat the Zulus in a number of engagements, the last of which was the Battle of Ulundi, followed by capture of King Cetshwayo. With the fall of the Disraeli government, Bartle Frere was recalled in August 1880 and the policy of Confederation was abandoned. The British government encouraged the subkings of the Zulus to rule their subkingdoms without acknowledging a central Zulu power. By the time King Cetshwayo was allowed to return home, the Zulu Kingdom had ceased to exist as an independent entity.

The measure of respect that the British gained for their opponents as a result of Isandlwana can be seen in that in none of the other engagements of the Zulu War did the British attempt to fight again in their typical linear formation, known famously as the Thin Red Line, in an open-field battle with the main Zulu impi. In the battles that followed, the British, when facing the Zulu, entrenched themselves or formed very close-order formations, such as the square.

===Recriminations===

Chelmsford realised that he would need to account to the government and to history for the disaster. He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would hardly have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford&#x27;s decision not to entrench the camp, as it was meant to be temporary.

Wolseley wrote on 30 September 1879 when, later in the war, the Prince Imperial of France was killed by the Zulu: &quot;I think this is very unfair, and is merely a repetition of what was done regarding the Isandlwana disaster where the blame was thrown upon Durnford, the real object in both instances being apparently to screen Chelmsford.&quot;

Some historians hold that the victory at Ulundi was a token one, driven by the need for Lord Chelmsford to salvage some success after Isandhlwana, and the British withdrew quickly followed by Chelmsford&#x27;s resignation as commander of the British forces. The end of the war saw the Zulu retaining their lands.

<text>Ernst Karl Abbe (23 January 1840 – 14 January 1905) was a German businessman, optical engineer, physicist, and social reformer. Together with Otto Schott and Carl Zeiss, he developed numerous optical instruments. He was also a co-owner of Carl Zeiss AG, a German manufacturer of scientific microscopes, astronomical telescopes, planetariums, and other advanced optical systems.

== Personal life ==

Abbe was born 23 January 1840 in Eisenach, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, to Georg Adam Abbe and Elisabeth Christina Barchfeldt. He came from a humble home – his father was a foreman in a spinnery. Supported by his father&#x27;s employer, Abbe was able to attend secondary school and to obtain the general qualification for university entrance with fairly good grades, at the Eisenach Gymnasium, which he graduated from in 1857. By the time he left school, his scientific talent and his strong will had already become obvious. Thus, in spite of the family&#x27;s strained financial situation, his father decided to support Abbe&#x27;s studies at the Universities of Jena (1857–1859) and Göttingen (1859–1861). During his time as a student, Abbe gave private lessons to improve his income. His father&#x27;s employer continued to fund him. Abbe was awarded his PhD in Göttingen on 23 March 1861. While at school, he was influenced by Bernhard Riemann and Wilhelm Eduard Weber, who also happened to be one of the Göttingen Seven. This was followed by two short assignments at the Göttingen observatory and at Physikalischer Verein in Frankfurt (an association of citizens interested in physics and chemistry that was founded by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1824 and still exists today). On 8 August 1863 he qualified as a university lecturer at the University of Jena. In 1870, he accepted a contract as an associate professor of experimental physics, mechanics and mathematics in Jena. In 1871, he married Else Snell, daughter of the mathematician and physicist Karl Snell, one of Abbe&#x27;s teachers, with whom he had two daughters. He attained full professor status by 1879. He became director of the Jena astronomical and meteorological observatory in 1878. In 1889, he became a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He also was a member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences. He was relieved of his teaching duties at the University of Jena in 1891. Abbe died 14 January 1905 in Jena. He was an atheist.

== Life work ==

In 1866, he became a research director at the Zeiss Optical Works, and in 1868 he invented the apochromatic lens, a microscope lens which eliminates both the primary and secondary color distortion. By 1870, Abbe invented the Abbe condenser, used for microscope illumination. In 1871, he designed the first refractometer, which he described in a booklet published in 1874. He developed the laws of image of non-luminous objects by 1872. Zeiss Optical Works began selling his improved microscopes in 1872, including models with homogenous immersion objective by 1877 and his apochromatic objective microscopes in 1886. He created the Abbe number, a measure of any transparent material&#x27;s variation of refractive index with wavelength and Abbe&#x27;s criterion, which tests the hypothesis, that a systematic trend exists in a set of observations (in terms of resolving power this criterion stipulates that an angular separation cannot be less than the ratio of the wavelength to the aperture diameter, see angular resolution). Already a professor in Jena, he was hired by Carl Zeiss to improve the manufacturing process of optical instruments, which back then was largely based on trial and error.

Abbe was the first to define the term numerical aperture, as the sine of the half angle multiplied by the refractive index of the medium filling the space between the cover glass and front lens.

Abbe is credited by many for discovering the resolution limit of the microscope, and the formula (published in 1873)

although in a publication in 1874, Helmholtz states this formula was first derived by Joseph Louis Lagrange, who had died 61 years prior. Helmholtz was so impressed as to offer Abbe a professorship at the University of Berlin, which he declined because of his ties to Zeiss. Abbe was in the camp of the wide aperturists, arguing that microscopic resolution is ultimately limited by the aperture of the optics, but also argued that depending on application there are other parameters that should be weighted over the aperture in the design of objectives. In Abbe&#x27;s 1874 paper, titled &quot;A Contribution to the Theory of the Microscope and the nature of Microscopic Vision&quot;, Abbe states that the resolution of a microscope is inversely dependent on its aperture, but without proposing a formula for the resolution limit of a microscope.

In 1876, Abbe was offered a partnership by Zeiss and began to share in the considerable profits. Although the first theoretical derivations of were published by others, it is fair to say that Abbe was the first to reach this conclusion experimentally. In 1878, he built the first homogenous immersion system for the microscope. The objectives that the Abbe Zeiss collaboration were producing were of ideal ray geometry, allowing Abbe to find that the aperture sets the upper limit of microscopic resolution, not the curvature and placement of the lenses. Abbe&#x27;s first publication of occurred in 1882. In this publication, Abbe states that both his theoretical and experimental investigations confirmed . Abbe&#x27;s contemporary Henry Edward Fripp, English translator of Abbe&#x27;s and Helmholtz&#x27;s papers, puts their contributions on equal footing. He also perfected the interference method by Fizeau, in 1884. Abbe, Zeiss, Zeiss&#x27; son, Roderich Zeiss, and Otto Schott formed, in 1884, the Jenaer Glaswerk Schott &amp; Genossen. This company, which in time would in essence merge with Zeiss Optical Works, was responsible for research and production of 44 initial types of optical glass. Working with telescopes, he built an image reversal system in 1895.

In order to produce high quality objectives, Abbe made significant contributions to the diagnosis and correction of optical aberrations, both spherical aberration and coma aberration, which is required for an objective to reach the resolution limit of . In addition to spherical aberration, Abbe discovered that the rays in optical systems must have constant angular magnification over their angular distribution to produce a diffraction limited spot, a principle known as the Abbe sine condition. So monumental and advanced were Abbe&#x27;s calculations and achievements that Frits Zernike based his phase contrast work on them, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953, and Hans Busch used them to work on the development of the electron microscope.

During his association with Carl Zeiss&#x27; microscope works, not only was he at the forefront of the field of optics but also labor reform. He founded the social democratic Jenaische Zeitung (newspaper) in 1890 and in 1900, introduced the eight-hour workday, in remembrance of the 14-hour workday of his own father. In addition, he created a pension fund and a discharge compensation fund. In 1889, Ernst Abbe set up and endowed the Carl Zeiss Foundation for research in science. The aim of the foundation was &quot;to secure the economic, scientific, and technological future and in this way to improve the job security of their employees.&quot; He made it a point that the success of an employee was based solely on their ability and performance, not on their origin, religion, or political views. In 1896, he reorganized the Zeiss optical works into a cooperative with profit-sharing. His social views were so respected as to be used by the Prussian state as a model and idealized by Alfred Weber in the 1947 book &quot;Schriften der Heidelberger Aktionsgruppe zur Demokratie und Zum Freien Sozialismus&quot; (&quot;Writings of the Heidelberg Action Group on Democracy and Free Socialism&quot;).

The crater Abbe on the Moon was named in his honour.

<text>Josiah Gardner Abbott (November 1, 1814 – June 2, 1891) was an American politician who served in the Massachusetts General Court and as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Massachusetts.

==Early life==
Abbott was born in Chelmsford, Middlesex County, Massachusetts on 1 November 1814. He was the son of Caleb Abbott (1779–1846) and Mercy Abbott (1782–1834). His first American ancestors, George Abbott and William Fletcher, were English Puritans, who settled in Massachusetts in 1640 and 1653, respectively.

He attended the Chelmsford Academy in Concord and graduated from Harvard University in 1832 with high honors, the youngest of his class, and then attended Williams College in Williamstown. In 1862, Williams conferred on him the degree of LL.D.

==Career==
Following his schooling, Abbott worked as a teacher and a lawyer, then became a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1836. In 1837, he was admitted to the bar and began practice in Lowell, the same year, he was elected to the house of representatives of his state, the youngest member of that body. He became a member of the Massachusetts State Senate from 1841 to 1842. He was an aide to Governor Marcus Morton in 1843. From 1850 to 1855 he was a master in chancery. He also served as a member of the Massachusetts state constitutional convention, justice of the superior court for Suffolk County, an overseer of Harvard University, and several times was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for United States Senator.

In 1860, Abbott declined an appointment to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and in 1861 declined the Democratic nomination for state attorney general. He finally was victorious as a Democratic candidate for the United States House of Representatives, and served from July 28, 1876 to March 3, 1877. He was a member of the Electoral Commission created by the act of Congress approved January 29, 1877, to decide the presidential election of 1876.

Upon leaving the Congress, he returned to the practice of law. His fifty years of active practice as a lawyer connected his name with some of the most celebrated litigations of his time.

==Personal life==
Abbott was married to Caroline Livermore (1814–1887), the daughter of U.S. Congressman Edward St. Loe Livermore. Both Josiah and Caroline were descended from officers who served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Together, they were the parents of: 
* Edward Gardner Abbott (1840–1862), who died during the American Civil War.
* Henry Livermore Abbott (1842–1864), a Major in the Union Army during the Civil War who was posthumously awarded the grade of brevet brigadier general.
* Fletcher Morton Abbott (1843–1925)
* William Stackpole Abbott (1844–1846), who died young.
* Samuel Appleton Brown Abbott (1846–1931)
* Sarah Abbott (1850–1933), who married William Pickman Fay.
* Franklin Pierce Abbott (1852–1923)
* Arthur St. Loe Abbott (1853–1863)
* Grafton St. Loe Abbott (1856–1915), who married Mary Ogden Adams, a daughter of Charles Francis Adams Jr. and a descendant of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams.
* Holker Welch Abbott (1858–1930)

He died at his home in Wellesley Hills on 2 June 1891, and was interred in St. Mary&#x27;s Church Cemetery, in nearby Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts.

<text>Hunan University (HNU; ) is a public university in Yuelu, Changsha, Hunan, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction. It is also a member in the BRICS Universities League.

== History ==

Yuelu Academy was founded in the year 976, during the Song dynasty, as a Confucian &quot;shuyuan&quot;.

In 1903, during the final years of the Qing dynasty, the Hunan Institute of Higher Education was established. 

In 1926, the name of the institution was then changed to Hunan Normal College, and then Hunan Public Polytechnic School, before finally arriving at the name Hunan University.

In 1937, the academy was transformed from a provincial university into a national university, renamed the National Hunan University, and designated by the Ministry of education, becoming the fifteenth national university.

From April 1938 to May 1941, the National Hunan University suffered serious losses and, made it difficult to run the school. During the Battle of Changsha, the National Hunan University was suspended.

In 1949, the name Hunan University was again adopted, and the calligraphy of &quot;Hunan University&quot; was written by Mao Zedong in 1950 as soon as the People&#x27;s Republic of China was founded.

In 1959, Hunan University was officially restored after the national readjustment of higher education institutions.

In 1963, HNU was subordinated to the First Ministry of Machinery Industry. 

In 1978, Hunan University&#x27;s status as one of the 88 National Key Universities in China was reaffirmed.In 1996, Hunan University became one of the universities sponsored by Project 211. 

In 2000, Hunan University was selected as a member of Project 985.

In November 2010, the National Supercomputing Changsha Center was built on the Hunan University campus under the management and operation of Hunan University. It is the first National Supercomputing Center in Central China and the third of its kind apart from other two national centers situated in Tianjin and Shenzhen.

In 2011, HNU participated in the Excellence League, an alliance of 10 Chinese universities with a strong background in engineering. 

In 2015, HNU joined the BRICS Universities League, a consortium of leading research universities from BRICS countries.In 2017, Hunan University was listed in the Double First-Class Construction.

== Academics and administration ==

<text>The space marine is an archetype of military science fiction describing a kind of soldier who operates in outer space or on alien worlds.

==History==

The earliest known use of the term &quot;space marine&quot; was by Bob Olsen in his short story &quot;Captain Brink of the Space Marines&quot; (&quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, Volume 7, Number 8, November 1932), a light-hearted work whose title is a play on the song &quot;Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines&quot;, and in which the protagonists were marines of the &quot;Earth Republic Space Navy&quot; on mission to rescue celebrity twins from aliens on Titan. Olsen published a novella sequel four years later, &quot;The Space Marines and the Slavers&quot; (&quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, Volume 10, Number 13, December 1936), featuring the same characters using a spaceship with active camouflage to free hostages from Martian space pirates on Ganymede.

A more widely known early example was E. E. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Lensman&quot; series. While the first story, &quot;Triplanetary&quot; and most later sequels (&quot;Second Stage Lensmen&quot;, &quot;Children of the Lens&quot; and &quot;The Vortex Blaster&quot;) do not mention them, passing mentions of marines are made in &quot;Galactic Patrol&quot; (&quot;Astounding Stories&quot;, September 1937–February 1938) and &quot;Gray Lensman&quot; (&quot;Astounding Stories&quot;, October 1939–January 1940), and a more direct mention is made in &quot;First Lensman&quot; (1950): &quot;Dronvire of Rigel Four in the lead, closely followed by Costigan, Northrop, Kinnison the Younger, and a platoon of armed and armored Space Marines!&quot;.

The phrase &quot;space marines&quot; appears in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Misfit&quot; (1939) and is again used in &quot;The Long Watch&quot; (1949) which expands on a story from his earlier novel &quot;Space Cadet&quot; (1948), in all cases before Smith had used the phrase. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (1959) is considered the defining work for the concept, although it does not use the term &quot;space marine&quot;. The actors playing the Colonial Marines in &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986) were required to read &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; as part of their training prior to filming. Heinlein intended for the capsule troopers of the Mobile Infantry to be an amalgam of the shipborne aspect of the US Marine Corps relocated to space and coupled with the battlefield delivery and mission profile of US Army paratroopers.

As a gaming concept, space marines play a major role in the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; miniatures wargame, in which they are genetically altered super-soldiers and the most powerful fighting forces available to the Imperium of Man. In computer games, playing a space marine in action games was popularized by id Software&#x27;s &quot;Doom&quot; series, first published in 1993. It is a convenient game back-story as it excuses the presence of the character on a hostile alien world with little support and heavy weaponry. Some critics have suggested it has been overused to the point of being an action game cliché.

===Trademark controversy===

In December 2012, online retailer Amazon.com removed the e-book &quot;Spots the Space Marine&quot; by M.C.A. Hogarth at the request of games company Games Workshop. They claimed the use of the phrase &quot;space marine&quot; infringed on their trademark of the term for their game &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;. In February 2013, the row received a lot of publicity, with authors such as Cory Doctorow, Charles Stross and John Scalzi supporting Hogarth, and Amazon.com then restored the e-book for sale.

==Characteristics==
In film and television space marines often appear in squads, while in video games the protagonist Marine is usually alone or in very small squads. Depending on the mission, they may be deployed via dropship or another specialised insertion craft. Their battledress varies between media, ranging from equipment comparable to modern-day fatigues (or just being contemporary, such as the equipment of Colonial Marines in the re-imagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;) to environmentally sealed suits of powered armour. Equipment and weaponry is similarly varied, often incorporating various fictional technologies. Directed-energy weapons are common, though conventional firearms are also used, like the M41A Pulse Rifles the Colonial Marines in &quot;Aliens&quot; use (which are projectile weapons that use an electric pulse to shoot caseless ammunition). If the marines&#x27; armour is particularly bulky, their weapons may be similarly scaled up such as in &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; where Space Marines carry &quot;boltguns,&quot; effectively rocket-propelled grenade launchers, as a standard firearm.

==Non-fiction aspects==
The United States Air Force&#x27;s Project Hot Eagle considers the use of spacecraft to deliver Marines to a target on the ground. &quot;Within minutes of bursting into the atmosphere beyond the speed of sound – and dispatching that ominous sonic boom – a small squad of Marines could be on the ground and ready for action within 2 hours.&quot;

Hughley Morning Show&quot; premiered on WRKS (now WEPN), more popularly known at the time as 98.7 Kiss FM, an urban adult contemporary station in New York City. His co-hosts included former BET news correspondent Jacque Reid. Airing from 6 to 10 am, the show placed Hughley in direct competition with his fellow &quot;King of Comedy&quot; Steve Harvey, whose nationally syndicated &quot;Steve Harvey Morning Show&quot; airs in New York on WBLS (Kiss FM&#x27;s longtime rival). There were plans to take Hughley&#x27;s show into syndication as well, but a dispute regarding his salary erupted between Kiss FM&#x27;s parent company and the potential syndication company. In August 2010, Kiss FM dropped the show from its schedule, and Hughley moved on to other endeavors.

On August 12, 2013, REACH Media, the syndicator founded by Tom Joyner, announced it had finalized a deal with D.L. to host a new nationally syndicated afternoon drive show, &quot;The D.L. Hughley Show&quot;, distributed by Cumulus Media Networks.

On June 19, 2020, Hughley collapsed while performing at a club in Nashville, Tennessee; the reported cause was exhaustion. Subsequent tests revealed he was positive for COVID-19.

Hughley was initiated as an honorary member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity on July 30, 2020.

<text>Wayne Alphonso Brady (born June 2, 1972) is an American comedian, actor, and singer. He is a regular cast member on the American version of the improvisational comedy television series &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; He was the host of the daytime talk show &quot;The Wayne Brady Show&quot;, the original host of Fox&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics!&quot;, and he has hosted &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; since its 2009 revival.

Brady also performs musical theatre; he portrayed Lola/Simon in the Tony Award–winning musical &quot;Kinky Boots&quot; on Broadway from November 2015 to March 2016, and played Aaron Burr in the Chicago production of &quot;Hamilton&quot; from January 2017 to April 2017.

Brady has won five Emmy Awards. He won his first Emmy Award for his work on &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; in 2003, two more in the next year for &quot;The Wayne Brady Show&quot;, and two for &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;. He has also been nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance for his cover of the Sam Cooke song &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot;, and Best Musical Theater Album for the soundtrack of &quot;The Wiz&quot;.

== Early life ==
Brady was born in Columbus, Georgia, to West Indian parents. He was moved to Orlando, Florida, as a young child to live with his grandmother and aunt. Brady refers to his grandmother, Valerie Petersen, as his &quot;mom&quot;, since she raised him. As a child, Brady developed a stutter. This led to him being bullied by other children, which caused him a great deal of anxiety.

At 16, Brady started performing in community theater and in the Orlando improvisation troupe SAK Comedy Lab, where he first started developing his improv skills. He attended Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, from which he graduated in 1989.

Shortly thereafter, Brady gained employment at Universal Studios Florida, where he appeared in several projects, most notably two involving the character of Beetlejuice. The first was a street show called &quot;Beetlejuice: Dead in Concert&quot;, pitting the titular ghost against the Ghostbusters (this is when the park still had the rights to the franchise), where Brady played Winston Zeddemore. Later on, the &quot;ghost with the most&quot; was given his own stage show, &quot;Beetlejuice&#x27;s Rock &#x27;N Roll Graveyard Revue&quot;, where Brady portrayed Dracula.

In 1996, he moved to Los Angeles, where he continued developing his acting skills.

== Career ==

Brady first appeared on national television as a recurring contestant on the sketch comedy competition &quot;Kwik Witz&quot; from 1996 to 1999, appearing most often as partners with Frank Maciel. Brady was one of the improvisational theater performers in the original (British) version of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, along with Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie, and host Clive Anderson in 1998 when the last season was filmed in Hollywood, after which he became a regular on the American version, hosted by Drew Carey. In 2003, Brady won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program for his work on the show, the only person to win the award for a television series, as opposed to a special, since Dana Carvey in 1993.

He went on to star in his own ABC variety show in 2001, &quot;The Wayne Brady Show&quot;, and a daytime talk show of the same name in 2002, which lasted two seasons and won four Daytime Emmy Awards, two of which went to Brady for Outstanding Talk Show Host. Brady guest-starred on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; in 1999 and 2000 to take part in &quot;Drew Live&quot; and &quot;Drew Live II&quot;. On the show, Brady played several games taken from &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; with other characters.

In 2004, Brady joined the Broadway revival of &quot;Chicago&quot;, playing the role of lawyer Billy Flynn. He appeared briefly in the final episode of the 2004 season of the comedy &quot;Reno 911!&quot;. He guest-starred on the Sci Fi Channel&#x27;s hit series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; as Trelak, the first prime of Goa&#x27;uld System Lord Ares. He made an appearance on &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;, poking fun at his squeaky-clean persona. Brady co-wrote and sang the theme song for Disney&#x27;s animated series &quot;The Weekenders&quot;. In 2005, he sang and recorded Jim Brickman&#x27;s original Disney song &quot;Beautiful&quot; (a cover of All-4-One&#x27;s 2002 hit &quot;Beautiful As You&quot;) and its Christmas version. In 2006, Brady became the host of TV Land&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Talking About&quot;, a talk show discussing the role of African-Americans in the entertainment industry. From August 29 to September 29, 2006, Brady hosted the Fox show &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;.

Brady made several guest appearances on the CBS sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, playing James Stinson, the gay brother of Neil Patrick Harris&#x27;s character, Barney Stinson. Brady has also appeared as a guest star for the MTV show &quot;Wild &#x27;n Out&quot; and lent his voice to the Adult Swim show &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. Brady guest-starred in the CBC comedy &quot;Getting Along Famously&quot; alongside his &quot;Whose Line is It Anyway?&quot; costar Colin Mochrie. He appeared on the episode &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; of the television show &quot;Dirt&quot; and guest-starred on &quot;30 Rock&quot; as Steven Black, Liz Lemon&#x27;s date for the Source Awards. He co-hosted the short-lived VH1 show &quot;Vinyl Justice&quot; in 1998. In 2007, he starred in the ABC Family film &quot;The List&quot;. He starred in &quot;Flirt&quot;, a comedy pilot which was not picked up by the network. Brady guest-starred as Julius Rock&#x27;s gifted younger brother, Louis, in the sitcom &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;, and hosted a singing game show called &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics!&quot; on Fox until its cancellation in June 2009. He performed &quot;Wayne Brady: Making $%!^ Up&quot; at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada four nights a week.

He appeared on two episodes of &quot;Kevin Hill&quot;. Brady&#x27;s debut album was released on September 16, 2008. Brady&#x27;s version of Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;A Change is Gonna Come&quot; earned him a Grammy Award nomination in the Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance category. Brady started hosting an updated version of the game show &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; for CBS in October 2009, which taped at the Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas and currently tapes in Los Angeles. The show replaced the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, which ended its long run. The original host of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; was Monty Hall, who served as consultant for the new show until his death in 2017. Drew Carey currently hosts &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, and thus, both game shows in the CBS daytime lineup (as of September 2019) hold the distinction of being hosted by an alumnus of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; Brady was the guest host on the May 3, 2010, episode of &quot;WWE Raw&quot;, where he was involved in an in-ring segment with Edge and Randy Orton, eventually getting RKO&#x27;d by Orton. Later that year, in August, Brady played Tom Collins in a staged production of &quot;Rent&quot; at the Hollywood Bowl. The production was directed by Neil Patrick Harris.

Brady appeared alongside &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; announcer Jonathan Mangum in two episodes of &quot;Fast and Loose&quot;, an improvisational series on BBC2 hosted by Hugh Dennis, in January 2011. Then, with Holly Robinson Peete, he co-hosted the 42nd annual NAACP Image Awards on March 4, 2011. On May 3, 2011, he appeared on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; as the lead performer in a tribute to James Brown, celebrating what would have been Brown&#x27;s 78th birthday in the Macy&#x27;s Stars of Dance segment. He has also been a special guest of &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Improv-A-Ganza&quot; on GSN. Brady made a cameo in the 2011 song &quot;Dedication To My Ex (Miss That)&quot; by Lloyd featuring Lil Wayne and Andre 3000, narrating Lil Wayne&#x27;s section of the song. He appeared as a special guest star in the March 14, 2012, episode of the TV series &quot;Psych&quot;.

Brady starred in the 2012 ABC improvisational comedy series &quot;Trust Us with Your Life&quot; and returned for The CW&#x27;s revival of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; in the summer of 2013. Brady guest-starred as Don in the &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; episode &quot;Where&#x27;s Pinky?&quot; on June 7, 2013, and from February 9 to 13, 2015, guest-hosted &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on CBS. In November 2015, Brady replaced Billy Porter as Lola in &quot;Kinky Boots&quot; on Broadway until March 2016.

Brady assumed the lead role of Aaron Burr in the PrivateBank Theatre production of &quot;Hamilton&quot; in Chicago from January 17 to April 9, 2017. In 2018, Brady began a recurring role in the sci-fi drama &quot;Colony&quot; as Everett Kynes, the administrator of the Seattle colony and creator of an algorithm used in sorting and identifying people. On April 29, 2018, Brady won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host for &quot;Let&#x27;s Make A Deal&quot; for the first time, after seven previous nominations. In November 2018, Brady began making appearances as Dr. Reese Buckingham on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. On October 10, 2019, he was featured in a 30-minute YouTube documentary created by SoulPancake in collaboration with Funny or Die wherein a variety of comedians discuss mental health called &quot;Laughing Matters.&quot; On December 18, 2019, Brady competed on season two of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Fox&quot;. He was named the winner of that season.

Beginning in 2020, Brady plays a major recurring role during the third season of The CW superhero drama series &quot;Black Lightning&quot; as the DC Comics character Tyson Sykes / Gravedigger. It was also announced that he had created a reality competition show to air on BYU TV called &quot;Wayne Brady&#x27;s Comedy IQ&quot;, in which teens would be taught skills and compete in weekly challenges. Brady later appeared as a guest panelist in season four of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; where he also sang Maroon 5&#x27;s &quot;Memories&quot; as &quot;Mr. TV&quot; at the start of the sixth episode. On December 28, 2020, it was announced that Brady would star as Django in a benefit concert presentation of &quot;Ratatouille the Musical&quot;, an internet meme that originated on TikTok, inspired by the 2007 Disney/Pixar film. The concert streamed exclusively on TodayTix on January 1, 2021, and raised over $1 million for The Actors Fund. On September 8, 2022, Brady was announced as a contestant on season 31 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was partnered with Witney Carson and they finished in 3rd place.

== Personal life ==

Brady has been married twice. He married Diana Lasso on December 31, 1993. They divorced on September 21, 1995. On April 3, 1999, he married dancer Mandie Taketa. He and Taketa have one child, a daughter named Maile Masako Brady, born on February 3, 2003. Brady and Taketa separated on April 5, 2006, and Taketa filed for divorce on July 2, 2007. They have remained close friends and co-parents. Brady learned that he has a son named Val Henry from his ex-girlfriend Tina, with whom Brady had an intimate relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2007, Brady became an official supporter of Ronald McDonald House Charities and is a member of their celebrity board, the Friends of RMHC.

In 2013, Bill Maher compared Brady to President Barack Obama, in that, in popular culture, they were both supposedly &quot;not Black enough&quot;. Brady took issue with this statement, suggesting that Maher should &quot;be careful when [he makes] statements like that&quot; because it will allow his viewers to make the same stereotypical assumptions about Black people.

Brady has suffered from clinical depression. On his 42nd birthday, in 2014, he had a mental breakdown and later credited Taketa for helping him recover.

In August 2023, Brady came out as pansexual.

Brady is an honorary member of the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.

<text>Nehemiah Abbott (March 29, 1804 – July 26, 1877) was an American attorney and politician from Maine. Originally active in politics as a Democrat, he became a Republican when the party was founded in the mid 1850s. Among the offices in which he served were member of the Maine House of Representatives (1842–1844, 1845–1846), member of the United States House of Representatives (1857–1859), and mayor of Belfast (1865–1866).

==Biography==
Abbott was born in Sidney, Maine on March 29, 1804, a son of Asa Abbott and Hepzibah (Brooks) Abbott. He attended Litchfield Law School, was admitted to the bar in 1836 and began to practice in Calais, Maine. In 1839, he moved to Columbus, Mississippi, where he continued the practice of law. In 1840, he returned to Maine and settled in Belfast.

Originally a Democrat, in 1842, 1843, and 1845 he was elected to the Maine House of Representatives. Abbott became a Republican when the party was founded in the mid-1850s. In 1856, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives. He served one term, March 4, 1857 to March 3, 1859. During his U.S. House service, Abbott was a member of the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions. He did not run for reelection in 1858, and resumed the practice of law.

During the American Civil War, Abbott supported the Union. In 1864, he was appointed temporary chairman of the National Union Party nominating convention for Maine&#x27;s 5th congressional district. He served as mayor of Belfast from 1865 to 1866.

Abbott died in Belfast on July 26, 1877. He was buried at Grove Cemetery in Belfast.

==Family==
In 1836, Abbott married Caroline Williams Belcher. They were the parents of six children— Caroline Belcher, Howard, Emma Fuller, Clifford Belcher, Annie Gill, and Henry Fuller.

<text>An island country, island state, or island nation is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. Approximately 25% of all independent countries are island countries. Island countries are historically more stable than many continental states but are vulnerable to conquest by naval superpowers. Indonesia is the largest and most populated island country in the world.

There are great variations between island country economies: they may rely mainly on extractive industries, such as mining, fishing and agriculture, and/or on services such as transit hubs, tourism, and financial services. Many islands have low-lying geographies and their economies and population centers develop along coast plains and ports; such states may be vulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially sea level rise.

Remote or significant islands and archipelagos that are not themselves sovereign are often known as dependencies or overseas territories.

==History==
==Politics==
Historically, island countries have tended to be less prone to political instability than their continental counterparts. The percentage of island countries that are democratic is higher than that of countries.

===Island territories===
While island countries by definition are sovereign states, there are also several islands and archipelagos around the world that operate semi-autonomously from their official sovereign states. These are often known as dependencies or overseas territories and can be similar in nature to proper island countries.

==War==
Island countries have often been the basis of maritime conquest and historical rivalry between other countries.
Island countries are more susceptible to attack by large, continental countries due to their size and dependence on sea and air lines of communication.
Many island countries are also vulnerable to predation by mercenaries and other foreign invaders,
although their isolation also makes them a difficult target.

==Natural resources==
Many developing small island countries rely heavily on fish for their main supply of food.
Some are turning to renewable energy—such as wind power, hydropower, geothermal power and biodiesel from copra oil—to defend against potential rises in oil prices.

==Geography==
Some island countries are more affected than other countries by climate change, which produces problems such as reduced land use, water scarcity, and sometimes even resettlement issues. Some low-lying island countries are slowly being submerged by the rising water levels of the Pacific Ocean.
Climate change also impacts island countries by causing natural disasters such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, flash floods and droughts.

===Climate change===
==Economics==
Many island countries rely heavily on imports and are greatly affected by changes in the global economy. Due to the nature of island countries their economies are often characterised by being smaller, relatively isolated from world trade and economy, more vulnerable to shipping costs, and more likely to suffer environmental damage to infrastructure; exceptions include Japan, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.
The dominant industry for many island countries is tourism.

==Composition==
Island countries are typically small with low populations, although some, like Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines are notable exceptions.

Some island countries are centred on one or two major islands, such as Bahrain, Cuba, Iceland, Malta, New Zealand, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom. Others are spread out over hundreds or thousands of smaller islands, such as The Bahamas, Indonesia, Japan, the Maldives, the Philippines, and Seychelles. Some island countries share one or more of their islands with other countries, such as Ireland and the United Kingdom; the Dominican Republic and Haiti; and Indonesia, which shares islands with Brunei, East Timor, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea. Bahrain, Singapore, and the United Kingdom have fixed links such as bridges and tunnels to the continental landmass: Bahrain is linked to Saudi Arabia by the King Fahd Causeway, Singapore to Malaysia by the Johor–Singapore Causeway and Second Link, and the United Kingdom has a railway connection to France through the Channel Tunnel.

Geographically, the country of Australia is considered a continental landmass rather than an island, covering the largest landmass of the Australian continent. In the past, however, it was considered an island country for tourism purposes (among others) and is sometimes referred to as such.

<text>Alaska Natives (also known as Alaskan Indians, Alaskan Natives, Native Alaskans, Indigenous Alaskans, Aboriginal Alaskans or First Alaskans) are the Indigenous peoples of Alaska and include Russian Creoles, Iñupiat, Yupik, Aleut, Eyak, Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, and a number of Northern Athabaskan cultures. They are often defined by their language groups. Many Alaska Natives are enrolled in federally recognized Alaska Native tribal entities, who in turn belong to 13 Alaska Native Regional Corporations, who administer land and financial claims.

Ancestors of Native Alaskans or Alaska Natives migrated into the area thousands of years ago, in at least two different waves. Some are descendants of the third wave of migration, in which people settled across the northern part of North America. They never migrated to southern areas. Genetic studies show they are not closely related to native peoples in South America. 

Alaska Natives came from Asia. Anthropologists have stated that their journey from Asia to Alaska was made possible through the Bering land bridge or by traveling across the sea. Throughout the Arctic and the circumpolar north, the ancestors of Alaska Natives established varying indigenous, complex cultures that have succeeded each other over time. They developed sophisticated ways to deal with the challenging climate and environment. 

Historical groups have been defined by their languages, which belong to several major language families. Today, Alaska Natives or Native Alaskans constitute more than 20% of the population of Alaska.

==List of peoples==

*Nunivak Cup&#x27;ig
*Sugpiaq ~ Alutiiq
*Chugach Sugpiaq
* Koniag Alutiiq
*Aleut (Unangan)
== Demographics ==
The Alaska Natives Commission estimated there were about 86,000 Alaska Natives living in Alaska in 1990, with another 17,000 who lived outside Alaska. A 2013 study by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development documented more than 120,000 Alaska Native people in Alaska. While the majority of Alaska Natives live in small villages or remote regional hubs such as Nome, Dillingham, and Bethel, the percentage who live in urban areas has been increasing. In 2010, 44% lived in urban areas, compared to 38% in the 2000 census. As of 2018, natives constitute 15.4% of the overall Alaskan population.

==History==
The modern history of Alaska Natives begins with the first contact between Alaskan First Nations and Russians sailing from Siberia in the eighteenth century. British and American traders, coming mostly from eastern settlements in North America, generally did not reach the area until the nineteenth century. In some cases, Christian missionaries were not active in Alaska until the twentieth century.

===Russian colonial period===
Vitus Bering spotted Alaska during an expedition. Native Alaskans first came into contact with Russians in the 18th century. Time of contact with Russians varied throughout each native group since the Native Alaskan groups were spread throughout Alaska. Arriving from Siberia by ship in the mid-eighteenth century, Russians began to trade with Alaska Natives in what became known as the Aleutian Islands. They started new settlements around trading posts, and Russian Orthodox missionaries were part of these. The Russian missionaries were the first persons to translate Christian scripture into Native languages, such as Tlingit. In the 21st century, the numerous congregations of Russian Orthodox Christians in Alaska reflect this early history, as they are generally composed mostly of Alaska Natives.

Rather than hunting and harvesting marine life themselves, the Sibero-Russian &quot;promyshlenniki&quot; forced the Aleuts to do the work for them, enserfing the Aleuts. As word spread of the riches in furs to be had, competition among Russian companies increased. Catherine the Great, who became Empress in 1763, proclaimed good will toward the Aleut and urged her subjects to treat them fairly. The growing competition between the trading companies, which merged into fewer, larger and more powerful corporations, created conflicts that aggravated the relations with the indigenous populations. Over the years, the situation became catastrophic for the Aleuts, as well as other Native Alaskan people who were impacted by Russian contact.

As the animal populations declined, the Aleuts, already dependent on the new barter economy created by their fur trade with the Russians, were increasingly coerced into taking greater risks in the dangerous waters of the North Pacific to hunt for more otter. As the Shelikhov-Golikov Company and later Russian-American Company developed as a monopoly, it used skirmishes and systematic violence as a tool of colonial exploitation of the indigenous people. When the Aleut revolted and won some victories, the Russians retaliated, killing many. They also destroyed the peoples&#x27; boats and hunting gear, leaving them no means of survival.

The greatest mortality was caused by the Aleuts&#x27; encounters with new diseases: during the first two generations (1741/1759-1781/1799 AD) of Russian contact, 80 percent of the Aleut population died from Eurasian infectious diseases. These had been endemic among the Europeans for centuries, but the Aleut had no immunity against the new diseases.

==== Effects of Russian colonization ====

The Russian Tsarist government expanded into Indigenous territory in present-day Alaska for its own geopolitical reasons. It consumed natural resources of the territory during the trading years, and Russian Orthodoxy was evangelized. Their movement into these populated areas of Indigenous communities altered the demographic and natural landscape.

Historians have suggested that the Russian-American Company exploited Indigenous peoples as a source of inexpensive labor. The Russian-American Company not only used Indigenous populations for labor during the fur trade, but also held some as hostages to acquire &quot;iasak&quot;. Iasak, a form of taxation imposed by the Russians, was a tribute in the form of otter pelts. It was a taxation method the Russians had previously found useful in their early encounter with Indigenous communities of Siberia during the Siberian fur trade. Beaver pelts were also customary to be given to fur traders upon first contact with various communities.

The Russian-American Company used military force on Indigenous families, taking them hostage until male community members produced furs for them. Otter furs on Kodiak Island and Aleutian Islands enticed the Russians to start these taxations. Robbery and maltreatment in the form of corporal punishment and the withholding of food was also present upon the arrival of fur traders. Catherine the Great dissolved the giving of tribute in 1799, but her government initiated mandatory conscription of Indigenous men between the ages of 18 and 50 to become seal hunters strictly for the Russian American Company. This mandatory labor gave the Russian American Company an edge in competition with American and British fur traders. But the conscription separated men from their families and villages, thus altering and breaking down communities. With able-bodied men away on the hunt, villages were left with little protection as only women, children, and the elderly remained behind.

In addition to changes that came with conscription, the spread of disease also altered the populations of Indigenous communities. Although records kept in the period were scarce, it has been said that 80% of the pre-contact population of the Aleut people were gone by 1800.

Relationships between Indigenous women and fur traders increased as Indigenous men were away from villages. This resulted in marriages and children that would come to be known as Creole peoples, children who were Indigenous and Russian. To reduce hostilities with Aleutian communities, it became policy for fur traders to enter into marriage with Indigenous women. The Creole population increased in the territory controlled by the Russian American Company.

The growth of the Russian Orthodox Church was another important tactic in the colonization and conversion of Indigenous populations. Ioann Veniaminov, who later became Saint Innocent of Alaska, was an important missionary who carried out the Orthodox Church&#x27;s agenda to Christianize Indigenous populations. The church encouraged Creole children to follow Russian Orthodox Christianity, while the Russian American Company provided them with an education. Many Orthodox missionaries, like Herman of Alaska, defended Natives from exploitation. Creole people were believed to have high levels of loyalty toward the Russian crown and Russian American Company. After completing their education, children were often sent to Russia, where they would study skills such as mapmaking, theology, and military intelligence. In the 1850s Russia lost much of its interest in Alaska.

=== American colonialism ===

Alaska has many natural resources, which, including its gold, caught the attention of the United States. In 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from Russia. It did not consider the wishes of Native Alaskans or view them as citizens. The land that belonged to Alaska Natives was considered to be &quot;open land&quot;, which could be claimed by white settlers without redress to the Alaska Natives living there. The only schools for Alaska Natives were those founded by religious missionaries. Most white settlers did not understand the sophisticated cultures the Alaska Natives had developed to live in challenging environment and considered them to be inferior to European Americans, correlating with white supremacist beliefs.

The Klondike Gold Rush occurred in the 1896–1898, increasing white presence in Alaska as well as discriminatory practices. Americans imposed racial segregation and discriminatory laws (similar to Jim Crow laws) that limited Alaska Native opportunities and participation in culture, treating them as second-class citizens. With the imposition of discriminatory laws, segregation amongst Alaskan Natives and Americans occurred; for example, &quot;whites only&quot; signs excluded natives from entering buildings. There were also segregated schools. An 1880 court case describes a child not allowed to attend a school with Americans because his stepfather was native. A child that was part native and part American would only be allowed to attend a school with American children if the family has abandoned their culture. At the same time, a system was put in place to disrupt Alaskan Native families. Federal records indicate that the United States viewed official disruption to the native family unit as part of Federal Indian policy to assimilate Indian children. The Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative, for example, was directly responsible for intergenerational trauma by disrupting family ties in Alaskan native villages. An important outcome of deliberate Federal disruption to the Alaskan Native family unit was the removal of children from their native villages to off-reservation Indian boarding schools alongside other Indian tribes children. The Federal Government accordingly devised artificial communities of Indian children throughout the Federal Indian boarding school system, resulting in the creation of other Indian or Alaskan Native families and extended families depending on whether a child returned to his or her own native village, or located elsewhere, after completing education in a Federal Indian boarding school. Specifically this meant that Alaskan Native children could no longer speak their native language, wear traditional native clothing, be amongst other natives, eat native foods, practice any native religion, ultimately resulting in the intergenerational trauma caused by the family separation and cultural eradication.

In 1912, the Alaska Native Brotherhood (ANB) was formed to help fight for citizenship rights. The Alaska Native Sisterhood (ANS) was created in 1915. Also in 1915, the Alaska Territorial legislature passed a law allowing Alaskan Natives the right to vote – but on the condition that they give up their cultural customs and traditions. The Indian Citizenship Act, passed in 1924, gave all Native Americans United States citizenship.

ANB began to hold a great deal of political power in the 1920s. They protested the segregation of Alaska Natives in public areas and institutions, and also staged boycotts. Alberta Schenck (Inupiaq) staged a well-publicized protest against segregation in a movie theater in 1944. With the help of Elizabeth Peratrovich (Tlingit), the Alaska Equal Rights Act of 1945 was passed, ending segregation in Alaska.

In 1942, during World War II, the United States forced evacuation of around nine hundred Aleuts from the Aleutian Islands. The idea was to remove the Aleuts from a potential combat zone during World War II for their own protection, but European Americans living in the same area were not forced to leave. The removal was handled so poorly that many Aleuts died after they were evacuated; the elderly and children had the highest mortality rates. Survivors returned to the islands to find their homes and possessions destroyed or looted. Civil rights activists such as Alberta Schenck Adams and Elizabeth Peratrovich protested discriminatory laws against Native Alaskans with what were effectively sit-ins and lobbying.

The Alaska Equal Rights Act of 1945, the first anti-discrimination state law in the U.S., occurred as a result of these protests. It entitled all Alaskans to &quot;full and equal enjoyment&quot; of public areas and businesses, a ban on segregating signs, with discriminatory actions punishable by a $250 fine and up to 30 days in jail.

Alaska became part of the United States in 1959 upon President Dwight D. Eisenhower recognizing Alaska as the 49th state.

====ANCSA and since (1971 to present)====
In 1971, with the support of Alaska Native leaders such as Emil Notti, Willie Hensley, and Byron Mallott, the U.S. Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), which settled land and financial claims for lands and resources which the Alaska Natives had lost to European-Americans. It provided for the establishment of thirteen Alaska Native Regional Corporations to administer those claims. Similar to the separately defined status of the Canadian Inuit and First Nations in Canada, which are recognized as distinct peoples, in the United States, Alaska Natives or Native Alaskans are in some respects treated separately by the government from other Native Americans in the United States. This is in part related to their interactions with the U.S. government which occurred in a different historical period than its interactions during the period of westward expansion during the 19th century.

Europeans and Americans did not have sustained encounters with the Alaska Natives until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when many were attracted to the region in gold rushes. The Alaska Natives were not allotted individual title in severalty to land under the Dawes Act of 1887 but were instead treated under the Alaska Native Allotment Act of 1906.

The Allotment Act was repealed in 1971, following ANSCA, at which time reservations were ended. Another characteristic difference is that Alaska Native tribal governments do not have the power to collect taxes for business transacted on tribal land, per the United States Supreme Court decision in &quot;Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government&quot; (1998). Except for the Tsimshian, Alaska Natives no longer hold reservations but do control some lands. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, Alaska Natives are reserved the right to harvest whales and other marine mammals.

==Climate change==

Four indigenous tribes in Alaska, the Shishmaref, Kivalina, Shaktoolik and Newtok tribes, are being considered the first climate refugees for America, due to sea ice melting and increased wildfires in the regions (Bronen and Brubaker). The effects of climate change on the people of Alaska are extensive and include issues such as increased vulnerability to disease, mental health issues, injury, food insecurity, and water insecurity (Brubaker). According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the loss of sea ice will increase erosion area and further displace more native communities. The melting sea ice will also affect the migration of some animals that the tribes rely on and with the ice melting there will be no place to store the food that they do obtain (EPA). Due to the permafrost melting, the infrastructure that has been around in the past will become unstable and native villages will collapse (EPA). 
The Shishmaref, Kivalina, Shaktoolik and Newtok tribes are located on the west coast of Alaska and due to sea-level rise the villages are experiencing more severe storm surges that are eroding their coastlines (Bronen). There is no land for these tribes to move to that are already in the area they live in which forces these communities to migrate and change their whole way of living (Bronen). It is predicted that a climate event will submerge the tribes completely in less than fifteen years (Bronen).

Extreme weather conditions has increased the risk of injury, usually there are thick layers of ice all year long but due to increasing temperatures in the atmosphere and the sea the ice is becoming thinner and is increasing the number of people who fall through the ice, if a person survives falling through the ice they are faced with other health concerns (Brubaker). Increased water insecurity and failing infrastructure caused by climate change has created sanitation issues which has increased the amount of respiratory illnesses in many regions in Alaska, in 2005 pneumonia was the leading cause of hospitalizations (Brubaker). Many of the affected tribes are experiencing increased mental stress due to climate change and the problem of relocating but no policy or way to relocate (Brubaker). Stress has also increased on villages who face infrastructure damage due to melting permafrost, there are almost no regulations other than the Alaskan government recommended not building on permafrost or using extra layers of insulation that is used on foundation walls (EPA). Food insecurity has also created stress and health issues, families can not get enough food due to animals also relocating to get to a climate that is more suitable to them (Brubaker). Families also do not have a secure food system because their ways of storing food, underground ice cellar, are no longer frozen year long due to climate change, their cellars thaw in the summers leaving their food supply inedible.

==Subsistence==

Gathering of subsistence food continues to be an important economic and cultural activity for many Alaska Natives. In Utqiaġvik, Alaska, in 2005, more than 91 percent of the Iñupiat households which were interviewed still participated in the local subsistence economy, compared with the approximately 33 percent of non-Iñupiat households who used wild resources obtained from hunting, fishing, or gathering.

But, unlike many tribes in the contiguous United States, Alaska Natives or Native Alaskans do not have treaties with the United States that protect their subsistence rights, except for the right to harvest whales and other marine mammals. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act explicitly extinguished aboriginal hunting and fishing rights in the state of Alaska.

== Ethnicity by region ==

<doc id="525009" wikidata="Q1347367" url="?curid=525009" title="Aptitude">
<text>An aptitude is a component of a competence to do a certain kind of work at a certain level. Outstanding aptitude can be considered &quot;talent&quot;, or &quot;skill&quot;. Aptitude is inborn potential to perform certain kinds of activities, whether physical or mental, and whether developed or undeveloped. Aptitude is often contrasted with skills and abilities, which are developed through learning. The mass term ability refers to components of competence acquired through a combination of both aptitude and skills.

According to Gladwell (2008) and Colvin (2008), it is often difficult to set apart the influence of talent from the influence of hard training in the case of outstanding performances. Howe, Davidson, and Sloboda argue that talents are acquired rather than innate. Talented individuals generally show high levels of competence immediately in only a narrow range of activities, often comprising only a single direction or genre.

== Intelligence and aptitude ==
Aptitude and IQ are different but related concepts relating to human mental ability. Unlike the original idea of IQ, aptitude often refers to one of the many different characteristics which can be independent of each other, such as aptitude for military flight, air traffic control, or computer programming. This approach measures a variety of separate skills, similar to the theory of multiple intelligences and Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory and many other modern theories of intelligence. In general, aptitude tests are more likely to be designed and used for career and employment decisions, and intelligence tests are more likely to be used for educational and research purposes. However, there is a great deal of overlap between them, and they often measure the same kinds of abilities. For example, aptitude tests such as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery measure enough aptitudes that they could also serve as a measure of general intelligence.

A single construct such as mental ability is measured with multiple tests. Often, a person&#x27;s group of test scores will be highly correlated with each other, which makes a single measure useful in many cases. For example, the U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s General Learning Ability is determined by combining Verbal, Numerical and Spatial aptitude scores. However, many individuals have skills that are much higher or lower than their overall mental ability level. Aptitude subtests are used intra-individually to determine which tasks that individual is more skilled at performing. This information can be useful for determining which job roles are the best fits for employees or applicants. Often, before more rigorous aptitude tests are used, individuals are screened for a basic level of aptitude through a previously-completed process, such as SAT scores, GRE scores, GATE scores, degrees, or other certifications.

== Common aptitude tests ==
Examples of aptitude tests include; 

*Logical reasoning tests: Logical reasoning tests examine how you come to see the difference or similarities between patterns and shapes.
*Verbal reasoning tests: Verbal reasoning tests will determine the way you have defined or obtained information from within short passage or paragraph.
*In-tray exercises: Also called e-tray exercise, in-tray exercises is to determine your prioritization and organizational abilities required in the workplace.
*Watson Glaser critical thinking tests: The Watson Glaser critical thinking test determines your ability to analyze any set of information to see how well you understand it and draw from it a logical conclusion.
*Situational judgment tests: Situational judgment tests measure how you solve problems at work using various workplace scenarios.
*Numerical reasoning tests: Numerical reasoning tests determine how you use numbers and calculations to solve mathematical problems.
*Diagrammatic reasoning tests: Diagrammatic reasoning tests give you patterns and diagrams from which you must find the next step in the chain and provide the next step in the pattern using logic.

== Combined aptitude and knowledge tests ==
Tests that assess learned skills or knowledge are frequently called achievement tests. However, certain tests can assess both types of constructs. An example that leans both ways is the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), which is given to recruits entering the armed forces of the United States. Another is the SAT, which is designed as a test of aptitude for college in the United States, but has achievement elements. For example, it tests mathematical reasoning, which depends both on mathematical ability and education received in mathematics.

Aptitude tests can typically be grouped according to the type of cognitive ability they measure, whether that be fluid or crystallized intelligence.

<text>Garden gnomes () are lawn ornament figurines of small humanoid creatures based on the mythological creature and diminutive spirit which occur in Renaissance magic and alchemy, known as gnomes. They also draw on the German folklore of the dwarf.

Traditionally, the garden figurines depict male dwarfs wearing red pointy hats. Typically, gnomes stand between . Originating as a decoration for the wealthy in Europe, garden gnomes are now prevalent in gardens and lawns throughout the Western world, among all social classes. They are regarded by some as kitsch.

==History==
===Ancient predecessors===
In ancient Rome, small stone statues depicting the Greco-Roman fertility god Priapus, also a protector of beehives, flocks, and vineyards, were frequently placed in Roman gardens. Gnomes as magical creatures were first described during the Renaissance period by Swiss alchemist Paracelsus as &quot;diminutive figures two spans in height who did not like to mix with humans&quot;. During this period, stone &quot;grotesques&quot;, which were typically garishly painted, figurines, were commonly placed in the gardens of the wealthy. Among the figures depicted were &#x27; (Italian for hunchbacks). In particular, Jacques Callot produced 21 versions of &#x27;, which he engraved and printed in 1616.

===18th and 19th centuries===

By the late 18th century, gnome-like figurines made of wood or porcelain, known by names including &quot;dwarves&quot;, had become popular household decorations in some parts of Europe. In particular, the area surrounding the town of Brienz in Switzerland was known for their production of wooden house dwarves. In Germany, these figurines became conflated with pre-existing folk stories and beliefs about dwarves (&quot;Zwerge&quot;; singular &quot;Zwerg&quot;) that they believed helped around the mines and on the farm. 

The Dresden company Baehr and Maresch had small ceramic statues of &quot;dwarves&quot; or &quot;little folk&quot; in stock as early as 1841. Hence, while the claim has been contested, some credit Baehr and Maresch with creating the first garden gnomes.(). Within less than 10 years, statues of dwarves had spread from the provinces of Saxony and Thuringia, in particular, across Germany and into France. The manufacture of dwarves spread across Germany, with numerous other large and small manufacturers coming in and out of the business, each having its own particular style of design.

Garden gnomes spread to other countries in Europe in the 1840s and became particularly popular in France and Britain. In 1847, Sir Charles Isham, brought 21 terracotta gnomes manufactured in Germany by Philip Griebel back to Britain where they were called &quot;gnomes&quot; in English, and placed in the gardens of Isham&#x27;s home, Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire. Nicknamed &quot;Lampy&quot;, the only gnome of the original batch to survive is on display at Lamport Hall and insured for .

Use of the term &quot;garden gnome&quot; may originate from fact that German catalogues sold ornaments of dwarfs under the name &quot;gnomen-figuren&quot;, meaning miniature figurines.

From around 1860 onwards, Gräfenroda, a town in Thuringia long known for its ceramics, became increasingly associated with production of garden gnomes.

===Twentieth century===

Garden gnomes were further popularized when Sir Frank Crisp, the owner of the second largest collection of garden gnomes in the UK, opened his Friar Park, Henley-on-Thames estate to the public at least once a week from 1910 to 1919. It was here where garden enthusiasts and visitors from around the world perhaps saw garden gnomes for the first time.

The reputation of German gnomes declined after World War I, but they became popular again in the 1930s following Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, when more working-class people were able to purchase them. Tom Major-Ball (father of former British prime minister John Major) was the most notable producer at that time with his company Major&#x27;s Garden Ornaments. World War II and the years following saw a decline in the industry, causing most producers to halt their manufacture.

Garden gnomes saw a resurgence in popularity again in the 1970s with the creation of more humorous types of gnomes. In the 1990s, travelling gnome and garden gnome pranks became popular and made national news at times, where people steal a garden gnome from an unknowing person&#x27;s lawn and then send the owner photos of the gnome as a practical joke before returning it.

===Twenty-first century===
Philip Griebel&#x27;s descendants are still producing garden gnomes in Germany. , there were an estimated 25 million garden gnomes in Germany. A recent trend has introduced miniature gnomes of only a few inches in height.

==Types of garden gnomes==
Garden gnomes are typically male, often bearded, usually wear red caps and often have pipes. They are often shown pursuing leisurely pastimes such as fishing or napping.

Gnomes may be made from terracotta clay slip (runny clay) poured into molds. This is allowed to set up and the excess emptied from the center, leaving a clay shell. The gnome is removed from the mold when firm, allowed to dry and then fired in a kiln until hard. Once cooled, the gnome is painted. More modern gnomes are made from resins and similar materials.

Today, many different variations of garden gnomes exist, including humorous ones ranging from the lighthearted biker or barbecuing gnome, to the more sinister, such as one stabbed in the back or wearing an executioner&#x27;s hood.

==In popular culture and politics==
Gnomes have become controversial in serious gardening circles in the United Kingdom, and were for a time banned from the prestigious Chelsea Flower Show, as the organisers claimed that they detract from the garden designs. Gnome enthusiasts accused the organisers of snobbery, as garden gnomes are popular in the gardens of working class and suburban households. The ban was lifted during 2013 to mark the show&#x27;s centenary.

* In the Italian movie &quot;The Monster&quot; (1994), the main character Loris, played by Roberto Benigni, is accused of stealing the garden gnome Bashful.
* A subplot in the 2001 French movie &quot;Amélie&quot; revolves around a &quot;travelling&quot; garden gnome.
* A garden gnome with a long, white beard, red conical hat and blue coat is the central figure in Travelocity&#x27;s Roaming Gnome advertising campaign which was launched in January 2004.
* The 2007 video game Half-Life 2: Episode Two features the unlockable achievement &quot;Little Rocket Man&quot; that requires the player to bring a garden gnome from the start to the end and place him into a rocket. The gnome was later given the name &quot;Gnome Chompski&quot; as a reference to Noam Chomsky and has appeared in the Valve Corporation games Left 4 Dead 2 and Half-Life: Alyx. In 2020 Gabe Newell partnered with Wētā Workshop and Rocket Lab to launch a real-life garden gnome into space.
* &quot;Gnomeo and Juliet&quot; is a 2011 British-American CGI film that is inspired by the tragedy of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; featuring garden gnomes as the characters. In 2018, its sequel, &quot;Sherlock Gnomes&quot;, was released.
* The Social Democratic Party of Austria () used garden gnomes, which they called &quot;Coolmen&quot;, in their campaign for the 2014 regional elections in Vorarlberg. It was intended as an ironic pun since the historically performed poorly in elections in this part of Austria and considered itself to be a political &quot;dwarf&quot;. The campaign placed 20,000 Coolmen holding small posters with short slogans along highly frequented roads. The party made a police report after 400 of them went missing, drawing attention from the international media.
* The 2010 video game &quot;Fable III&quot; includes a side mission where a collection of garden gnomes are given magical properties, which the player character must collect throughout the world.
* In the children&#x27;s television series Pinkalicious &amp; Peterrific (based on the book series by Victoria Kann), a garden gnome named Norman, who was a bit grumpy but a gentle gnome, befriends Pinkalicious and her friends.
*A 2005 episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; titled &quot;Yard, She Blows!&quot; revolves around Bobby breaking Peggy&#x27;s newly acquired, and very rare, garden gnome. Hank, hating the gnome, attempts to use the event to eliminate it from the front lawn.

<text>James Montgomery Beggs (January 9, 1926 – April 23, 2020) was an American businessman and consultant who served as the 6th Administrator of NASA from 1981 to 1986.

==Early life and education==
James Montgomery Beggs was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 9, 1926. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1947. After leaving the navy in 1954, he earned a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1955.

== Career ==
Beggs served as an executive Vice President and director of General Dynamics. He worked with NASA between 1968 and 1969 as an Associate Administrator of the Office of Advanced Research and Technology. He was an Undersecretary of Transportation from 1969 to 1973. He had served in managerial roles for various such corporations as Summa Corporation, General Dynamics, and Westinghouse prior to his work in NASA.

===NASA Administrator===
Beggs was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as NASA Administrator on June 1, 1981, and took office on July 10. He served until December 4, 1985, when he took an indefinite leave of absence due to an indictment for contract fraud related to activities alleged by the United States Department of Defense to have taken place prior to his tenure at NASA. This indictment was later dismissed, and the United States Attorney General apologized to Beggs for any embarrassment. Deputy Administrator William Graham took over as Acting Administrator until the appointment of James C. Fletcher, who had previously served as Administrator between 1971 and 1977, to a second term.

Beggs formally resigned on February 26, 1986, in the aftermath of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. He denied knowledge of the problems related to the disaster, stating that he &quot;had no specific concerns with the joint, the O-rings or the putty&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Beggs married Mary Harrison, and they had five children. After his NASA career Beggs worked as a consultant from his offices in Bethesda, Maryland, and was involved with the NASA Alumni League and the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies. Beggs died on April 23, 2020, in his Bethesda home of congestive heart failure.

<text>Alexander Gottfried Friedrich Gode-von Aesch (October 30, 1906 – August 10, 1970) was a German-born American linguist, translator and the driving force behind the creation of the auxiliary language Interlingua.

==Biography==
Born to a German father and a Swiss mother, Gode studied at the University of Vienna and the University of Paris before leaving for the U.S. and becoming a citizen in 1927. He was an instructor at the University of Chicago as well as Columbia University, where he received his Ph.D. in Germanic Studies in 1939.

Alexander Gode died of cancer in hospital. He was preceded in death by his first wife, Johanna. Gode was survived by two daughters from his first marriage, his second wife Alison, and their two children.

==Interlingua==
Gode was involved with the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) from 1933 on, sporadically at first. In 1936 the IALA began development of a new international auxiliary language and in 1939 Gode was hired to assist in this work.

After André Martinet was brought in to head the research in 1946, the two men&#x27;s views came into conflict as Gode thought that Martinet was trying to schematize the new language too much, conflating it with Occidental. Gode saw no need to invent a language, as a product of some a-priori design. Instead, he and the former director of research, Ezra Clark Stillman, wanted to record the &quot;international vocabulary&quot; that, in their view, already existed. This would be done – and was being done before Martinet – by systematically extracting and modifying words from the existing control languages in such a way that they could be seen as dialects of a common language, with their own specific peculiarities. When Martinet resigned in 1948 over a salary dispute, Gode took up leadership and got full reign in implementing this vision. The result was Interlingua, the dictionary and of which were published in 1951.

In 1953, the role of IALA was assumed by the Interlingua Division of Science Service, and Gode became the division director. He continued his involvement with Interlingua until his death by translating scientific and medical texts into it. He won awards for this from the American Medical Writers Association and the International Federation of Translators.

==American Translators Association==
Gode was one of the founders and first president of the American Translators Association (1960–1963). In his honor, this organization awards the Alexander Gode Medal &quot;for outstanding service to the translation and interpreting professions&quot;.

<doc id="525018" wikidata="Q755988" url="?curid=525018" title="Hunky Dory">
<text>Hunky Dory is the fourth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released in the United Kingdom on 17December 1971 through RCA Records. Following a break from touring and recording, Bowie settled down to write new songs, composing on piano rather than guitar as in earlier works. Bowie assembled Mick Ronson (guitar), Trevor Bolder (bass) and Mick Woodmansey (drums), and began to record a new album in mid-1971 at Trident Studios in London. Rick Wakeman contributed piano shortly before joining Yes. Bowie co-produced the album with Ken Scott, who had engineered Bowie&#x27;s previous two records.

Compared to the guitar-driven hard rock sound of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, Bowie opted for a warmer, more melodic piano-based pop rock and art pop style on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. His lyrical concerns on the record range from the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention on &quot;Changes&quot; to occultism and Nietzschean philosophy on &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot; and &quot;Quicksand&quot;; several songs make cultural and literary references. He was also inspired by his United States tour to write songs dedicated to three American icons: Andy Warhol, Bob Dylan and Lou Reed. The song &quot;Kooks&quot; was dedicated to Bowie&#x27;s newborn son Duncan. The album&#x27;s cover artwork, photographed in monochrome and subsequently recoloured, features Bowie in a pose inspired by actresses of the Hollywood Golden Age.

RCA offered little promotion for &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; and its lead single &quot;Changes&quot;, wary that Bowie would transform his image shortly. Thus, despite very positive reviews from the British and American music press, the album initially sold poorly and failed to chart. After the commercial breakthrough of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; album in 1972, &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; garnered renewed interest, with sales peaking at number three on the UK Albums Chart. Retrospectively, &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; has been critically acclaimed as one of Bowie&#x27;s best works, and features on several lists of the greatest albums of all time. Within the context of his career, &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; is considered the album where &quot;Bowie starts to become Bowie&quot;, definitively discovering his voice and style.

== Background ==
After David Bowie completed his third studio album, &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, in May 1970, he became less active in both the studio and on stage. His contract with the music publisher Essex had expired and his new manager Tony Defries was facing prior contractual challenges. Bowie was also without a backing band, as the musicians on &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; – including its producer and bassist Tony Visconti, the guitarist Mick Ronson and the drummer Mick Woodmansey – departed in August 1970 due to personal conflicts with the artist. After hearing a demo of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Holy Holy&quot;, recorded in autumn 1970, Defries signed the singer to a contract with Chrysalis, but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects. Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis&#x27;s partner Bob Grace, who loved the demo of &quot;Holy Holy&quot; and subsequently booked time at Radio Luxembourg&#x27;s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos. &quot;Holy Holy&quot;, recorded in November 1970 and released as a single in January 1971, was a commercial flop.
&quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was released in the United States through Mercury Records in November 1970. The album sold poorly but fared better both critically and commercially in the US than in the UK. It was played on American radio stations frequently and its &quot;heavy rock content&quot; increased interest in Bowie. The critical success of the album prompted Mercury to send Bowie on a promotional radio tour of the US in February 1971. The trip inspired him to write tribute songs for three American icons: the artist Andy Warhol, the singer-songwriter Bob Dylan and the rock band the Velvet Underground, more specifically their singer Lou Reed. After the tour, Bowie returned to his apartment in Haddon Hall, Beckenham, where he recorded many of his early 1970s demos, and began writing. According to his then-wife Angela, Bowie had spent time composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would &quot;infuse the flavour of the new album&quot;. In total, he composed over three-dozen songs there, many of which would appear on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; and its follow-up album &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;. The first song Bowie wrote for &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot; in January 1971. After recording its demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to Peter Noone of Herman&#x27;s Hermits. Noone decided to record his own version and release it as his debut single.

Released in April 1971, Noone&#x27;s version of &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot; was a commercial success, reaching number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. It was the first time most listeners had heard of Bowie since &quot;Space Oddity&quot; (1969). Noone told &quot;NME&quot;: &quot;My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment ... certainly the best since Lennon and McCartney.&quot; Following the success of the single, Defries sought to extricate Bowie from his contract with Mercury, which was set to expire in June 1971. Defries felt that Mercury had not done Bowie justice financially. Although Mercury had intended to renew it on improved terms, Defries forced the label to terminate the contract in May by threatening to deliver a low-quality album. Defries then paid off Bowie&#x27;s debts to Mercury through Gem Productions, and the label surrendered its copyright on &quot;David Bowie&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;.

== Writing and recording ==
After his short-lived band Arnold Corns folded in February, Bowie returned to the studio in May 1971 to record his next album. He brought back Ronson and Woodmansey and began searching for a bass player to replace Visconti. He passed on Rick Kemp and hired Trevor Bolder, a former hairdresser and piano tuner. After Bolder was hired, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie&#x27;s new material, such as the song &quot;Andy Warhol&quot;. Bowie and his new backing trio, soon to be named the Spiders from Mars, played for the first time on 3June on BBC DJ John Peel&#x27;s radio programme &quot;In Concert&quot;. The set included debut performances of several songs Bowie had recently written such as &quot;Queen Bitch&quot;, &quot;Bombers&quot;, &quot;Song for Bob Dylan&quot; and &quot;Andy Warhol&quot;. The title &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was also announced at this session.
Bowie and the future Spiders officially started work on the new album at Trident Studios in London on 8June 1971. Ken Scott, who had engineered Bowie&#x27;s two previous records, was hired to co-produce alongside him. Scott accepted the position as a way to gain experience, although at the time he didn&#x27;t believe Bowie would become a huge star. His debut as a producer, Scott borrowed some of the acoustic sounds of George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; (1970), an album he engineered. Scott retained the role of co-producer for Bowie&#x27;s next three records: &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; and &quot;Pin Ups&quot;. Bowie played demos for Scott and the two picked which ones would be recorded for the album. On 8June, the band recorded &quot;Song for Bob Dylan&quot;, although according to Nicholas Pegg this version was scrapped and the released version was not recorded until 23June. Scott later recalled that recording went very quickly: &quot;Almost everything was done in one take.&quot; Discussing Bowie&#x27;s vocals, Scott stated: &quot;He was unique. [He is] the only singer I ever worked with where virtually every take was a master.&quot; Bolder described recording with Bowie for the first time as a &quot;nerve-wracking experience&quot;: &quot;When that red light came on in the studio it was, God, in at the deep end of what!&quot; As a co-producer Bowie took an active interest in the album&#x27;s sound and arrangements, an about-face from his generally hands-off attitude during the &quot;Man Who Sold the World&quot; sessions.
Rick Wakeman, noted session musician and member of the Strawbs, plays piano on the album; he previously played Mellotron on &quot;David Bowie&quot; (1969). In 1995 he recalled that he met with Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where he heard demos of &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; in &quot;their raw brilliance ... the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life ... I couldn&#x27;t wait to get into the studio and record them.&quot; According to Wakeman, the first few sessions started poorly as the band had not learned the songs. He recalled that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. When they returned after a week, Wakeman thought &quot;the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.&quot; This story has been contested by other band members, including Bolder, who told the biographer Kevin Cann: &quot;[That&#x27;s] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that – it definitely didn&#x27;t happen.&quot; Scott contended: &quot;I definitely don&#x27;t remember that, and it&#x27;s not something I would forget. I would definitely dispute that one.&quot;

On 9July, with Wakeman in the line-up, Bowie and the band recorded two takes of &quot;Bombers&quot; and &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot;, the latter featuring backing vocals by Dana Gillespie. Five days later, the group recorded four takes of &quot;Quicksand&quot;, the last of which appears on the finished album. On 18July, the group spent the day rehearsing and mixing. Further mixing sessions were carried out between 21 and 26July to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. By this point, the songs &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot;, &quot;Eight Line Poem&quot;, &quot;Kooks&quot;, &quot;Queen Bitch&quot; and &quot;Andy Warhol&quot; had been recorded; the mixes of &quot;Eight Line Poem&quot; and &quot;Kooks&quot; on the promotional album differed from the final versions on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. Two takes of &quot;The Bewlay Brothers&quot; were recorded on 30July, the second appearing on the final album; it was recorded on a tape that contained scrapped versions of &quot;Song for Bob Dylan&quot; and &quot;Fill Your Heart&quot;. On 6August, the band recorded &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; and &quot;Song for Bob Dylan&quot;, after which the recording process was considered finished. Before the sessions ended, Bowie asked Wakeman if he wanted to be a part of the Spiders from Mars. Wakeman declined and joined the progressive rock band Yes instead.

== Songs ==
After the hard rock sound of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; features a stylistic shift towards art pop and melodic pop rock. The songs are mostly piano-led rather than guitar-led. The biographer Marc Spitz believes the piano incites a warmer feel on this record compared to its two predecessors. Christopher Sandford states that &quot;the songs [are] characterised by the lush ambience established by Bowie&#x27;s vocal and the piano&quot; and, along with Elton John and Phil Collins, helped create music on the &quot;easy-listening continuum&quot;. Lior Phillips of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; wrote that the songs are accessible, both musically and lyrically, allowing the listener to dissect them again and again. The music journalist Peter Doggett concurs, regarding &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; as &quot;a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power&quot;. Rick Quinn described the songs in &quot;PopMatters&quot; as a fusion of &quot;British pop, orchestral works, art-rock, folk and ballads&quot; that emerge to form glam rock.

Robert Dimery, in his book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, calls it &quot;a toybox of acoustic oddities, tributes to heroes and surrealism&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic describes it as &quot;a kaleidoscopic array of pop styles, tied together only by Bowie&#x27;s sense of vision: a sweeping, cinematic mélange of high and low art, ambiguous sexuality, kitsch, and class&quot;. Michael Gallucci of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; notes that it is Bowie&#x27;s first record to include &quot;a mix of pop, glam, art and folk wrapped in an ambisexual pose that would come to define the artist&quot;. James Perone similarly describes the album as &quot;a unique blend of folk, pop, glam, and progressive rock&quot; that distinguished Bowie from other musicians at the time. Peter Ormerod of &quot;The Guardian&quot; writes that the music of &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; celebrates &quot;uncertainty, rootlessness, inner chaos, difference, otherness, doubt and impermanence&quot; and did it with &quot;beauty, style and charisma&quot;.

===Side one===

The opening track, &quot;Changes&quot;, is built around a distinctive piano riff. The lyrics focus on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream. The biographer David Buckley writes that &quot;strange fascination&quot; is a phrase that &quot;embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre&quot;. Pegg summarises the lyrics as Bowie &quot;holding a mirror to his face&quot; just as he is about to achieve stardom. Doggett notes that &quot;Changes&quot; is a &quot;statement of purpose&quot;: as the opening track, the song provided a stark contrast to the hard rock sound found on its predecessor. The song was also unlike &quot;Space Oddity&quot; and its 1969 parent album, but rather &quot;pure, unashamedly melodic, gleefully commercial, gorgeously mellifluous pop&quot;.

&quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot; was the first track written for the album. The piano style has been compared to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Martha My Dear&quot;. The lyrics reference the teachings of the occultist Aleister Crowley and his Golden Dawn and the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, particularly with the lines &quot;the homo superior&quot;, &quot;the golden ones&quot; and &quot;homo sapiens have outgrown their use&quot;. &quot;Homo Superior&quot; refers to Nietzsche&#x27;s theory of &quot;Übermensch&quot;, or &quot;Superman&quot;. The music itself provides a contrast to the darker themes. Doggett describes Bowie&#x27;s vocal performance as &quot;quite unadorned, presented so starkly ... that it [is] almost unsettling&quot;.

Designed to sound like a &quot;continuation&quot; of the previous track, &quot;Eight Line Poem&quot; is described by Pegg as the album&#x27;s most &quot;overlooked&quot; song. It features Bowie on a gentle, sporadic piano while he sings and a country-influenced guitar line from Ronson. Exactly eight lines long, the lyrics describe a room where a cat just knocked over a spinning mobile and a cactus sits in a window. Doggett believes there is a metaphor between the cactus and a prairie. At the time of the album&#x27;s release, Bowie described the song as the city that is &quot;a kind of high-life wart on the backside of the prairie&quot;.

&quot;Life on Mars?&quot; is described by Buckley as a &quot;soaring, cinematic ballad&quot;. Although Bowie was fixated on becoming Ziggy Stardust at the time of its recording, the song has no connection to Mars itself; the title was a reference to the recent media frenzy of the US and Soviet Union racing to get to the red planet. The song is a parody of singer Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;My Way&quot; and uses the same chord sequence for its opening bars. The handwritten notes on the back cover say &quot;Inspired by Frankie&quot;. Like most songs on the album, &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; is mostly piano-led, but features a string arrangement from Ronson – his first – that is described by Doggett as &quot;gargantuan&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s vocals – recorded in one take – are delivered passionately during the chorus and almost nasally in the verses. He mentions &quot;the girl with the mousy hair&quot;, whose identity commentators have debated, and who according to Greene &quot;goes to the movies as an escape from life&quot;.
A few days after his son Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones was born on 30 May 1971, Bowie completed &quot;Kooks&quot; and dedicated it to him. Performed by Bowie as early as 3 June, the &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; version features a string arrangement from Ronson and trumpet played by Bolder. &quot;Kooks&quot; is noticeably lighter than the two tracks it is sequenced between but, according to Pegg, ultimately &quot;carries a hint of [the album&#x27;s] preoccupation with the compulsion to fictionalise life, as Bowie invites his son to &#x27;stay in our lovers&#x27; story&#x27;&quot;. Doggett writes that its inclusion on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; &quot;ensured its enduring appeal among those who were less entranced by his explorations of politics, psychology and occult elsewhere on the album&quot;. In the handwritten liner notes on the LP sleeve, Bowie wrote &quot;For Small Z&quot;.

According to Pegg, &quot;Quicksand&quot; was inspired by Bowie&#x27;s trip to America in February 1971. Doggett states that the song &quot;was written &quot;about&quot; a lack of inspiration and as a means of &quot;accessing&quot; it&quot;. Writer Colin Wilson wrote in &quot;The Occult&quot; (1971) that thought was a form of quicksand that allowed consciousness to keep the unconscious beyond reach, from which Doggett concluded that Quicksand&#x27; was Bowie&#x27;s plea to search within himself to be shown the way&quot;. In the mid-1970s, Bowie described the song as &quot;a mixture of narrative and surrealism&quot; and a &quot;precursor&quot; to the music of his 1977 album &quot;Low&quot;. Throughout the track, Bowie makes numerous references to Crowley and his Golden Dawn, Winston Churchill, Heinrich Himmler and the &quot;supermen&quot; of Friedrich Nietzsche. &quot;Quicksand&quot; also evokes spiritualism through the mention of Buddhist teachings such as bardo. The instrumental track features multiple layers of acoustic guitars atop one another, which was done at Scott&#x27;s insistence.

===Side two===
&quot;Fill Your Heart&quot;, written by Biff Rose and Paul Williams, is the only track on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; not written by Bowie; it was his first recorded cover song in six years. It replaced &quot;Bombers&quot; as the side two opener late in the album&#x27;s development. &quot;Fill Your Heart&quot; is one of the more up-tempo tracks on the album, and according to Doggett is &quot;practically identical&quot; to Rose&#x27;s original version, albeit more &quot;bouncy&quot; and less &quot;swung&quot;. The piano-driven arrangement differs from Bowie&#x27;s live performances of the song in 1970 when acoustic guitar dominated. Pegg writes that the track provides a &quot;cogent counterpoint&quot; to the &quot;angst&quot; of &quot;Quicksand&quot; and the &quot;cautionary warnings&quot; of &quot;Changes&quot; and is best remembered for Bowie&#x27;s saxophone break, Ronson&#x27;s string arrangement, and Wakeman&#x27;s piano solo.
The song &quot;Andy Warhol&quot; is a tribute to the American artist, producer, and director Andy Warhol, who had inspired Bowie since the mid-1960s and was described by him as &quot;one of the leaders&quot; of &quot;the media of the streets, street messages&quot;. Originally written for Bowie&#x27;s friend Dana Gillespie, the song is based around a riff played on two acoustic guitars that heavily resembles the intro of Ron Davies&#x27; &quot;Silent Song Across the Land&quot;. The lyrics emphasise Warhol&#x27;s belief that life and art blur together. The song&#x27;s opening features Ken Scott saying &quot;This is &#x27;Andy Warhol&#x27;, and it&#x27;s take one&quot;, only for Bowie to correct his pronunciation of &quot;Warhol&quot;. When Bowie met Warhol in September 1971 and played the song for him, Warhol hated it and left the room; Bowie recalled in 1997 that he found the meeting &quot;fascinating&quot; because Warhol had &quot;nothing to say at all, absolutely nothing&quot;.

&quot;Song for Bob Dylan&quot; is a tribute song to the singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. It was described by Bowie at the time as &quot;how some see BD&quot;, and its title is a parody of Dylan&#x27;s 1962 tribute to folk singer Woody Guthrie, &quot;Song to Woody&quot;. Throughout the song, Bowie addresses Dylan by his real name &quot;Robert Zimmerman&quot;. Pegg and Doggett believe the song highlights Bowie&#x27;s struggle with identity, from his real name David Jones, to his stage name David Bowie and, very shortly, to Ziggy Stardust. The lyrics specifically present Dylan as no longer being a hero figure for rock music, and demand that he return to his roots and come to the rescue for the unfaithful. According to Doggett, Bowie initially wrote it for his friend George Underwood. The music contains Dylanesque chord changes and the chorus is derived from the titles of two Velvet Underground songs, &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot; and &quot;There She Goes Again&quot;. Buckley writes that the song is &quot;probably the weakest&quot; on the album and Pegg considers it &quot;little-regarded&quot;.
The final tribute song on the album, &quot;Queen Bitch&quot; is largely inspired by the rock band the Velvet Underground, specifically their lead singer Lou Reed. The handwritten sleeve notes on the back cover read: &quot;some V.U. White Light returned with thanks&quot;. Unlike the majority of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Queen Bitch&quot; is primarily driven by guitar rather than piano, and characterized as glam rock and proto-punk. The chorus sings about Bowie mincing his &quot;satin and tat&quot; as a reference to the dancer Lindsay Kemp. Pegg states: &quot;Part of the genius of &#x27;Queen Bitch&#x27; is that it filters the archness of Marc Bolan and Kemp through the streetwise attitude of Reed: this is a song that succeeds in making the phrase &#x27;bipperty-bopperty hat&#x27; sound raunchy and cool.&quot; Daryl Easlea of BBC Music writes that the song&#x27;s glam rock sound foreshadowed the direction Bowie took on &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;.
The album closer, &quot;The Bewlay Brothers&quot;, was a late addition and the only track that was not demoed. The instrumentation echoes the music of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, featuring &quot;sinister&quot; sound effects and Bowie&#x27;s vocal accompanied by Ronson&#x27;s acoustic guitar. The song&#x27;s obscure lyrics have caused confusion among Bowie biographers and fans. Pegg describes it as &quot;probably the most cryptic, mysterious, unfathomable and downright frightening Bowie recording in existence&quot;, and Buckley considers it &quot;one of Bowie&#x27;s most disquieting moments on tape, an encapsulation of some distant, indefinable quality of expressionistic terror&quot;. Many reviewers have perceived the track to have homoerotic undertones; others believed it to be about Bowie&#x27;s relationship with his schizophrenic half-brother Terry Burns, which Bowie confirmed in 1977. Buckley is unsure whether this account is fictionalised or real. Some of the lyrics refer to other tracks on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, including &quot;Song for Bob Dylan&quot;, &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot; and &quot;Changes&quot;. Bowie also uses the word &quot;chameleon&quot; in the song, which became an oft-used term to describe him.

== Title and artwork ==
The cover photograph was taken by Brian Ward, who was introduced to Bowie by Bob Grace at Ward&#x27;s studio in Heddon Street. An early idea was for Bowie to dress as a pharaoh, partly inspired by the media&#x27;s infatuation with the British Museum&#x27;s new Tutankhamun exhibit. According to Pegg, photos of Bowie posing &quot;as a sphinx and in a lotus position&quot; were taken – one was released as part of the 1990 &quot;Space Oddity&quot; reissue – but the idea was ultimately abandoned. Bowie recalled: &quot;We didn&#x27;t run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.&quot; Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album&#x27;s &quot;preoccupation with the silver screen&quot;. He later said: &quot;I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an Evelyn Waugh Oxbridge look.&quot; The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking past the camera while he pulls back his hair. Pegg writes that his pose was influenced by the actresses Lauren Bacall and Greta Garbo. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was recoloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, a partner at Covent Garden&#x27;s recently initiated Main Artery design studio with George Underwood; Pastor later designed the cover and sleeve for &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;. Pegg writes: &quot;Bowie&#x27;s decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol&#x27;s famous &quot;Marilyn Diptych&quot; screen-prints.&quot; Dimery writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple Marlene Dietrich prints with him to the photoshoot.

Although Bowie normally waited to name his albums until the last possible moment, the title &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was announced at the John Peel session. Grace got the idea from an Esher pub landlord. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of &quot;Alias David Bowie&quot;, that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was infused with &quot;upper-crust jargon&quot; such as &quot;prang&quot; and &quot;whizzo&quot; and &quot;everything&#x27;s hunky-dory&quot;. Grace told Bowie, who loved it. Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; that may also have played a part. Spitz states that &quot;hunky-dory&quot; is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world. The original UK cover featured Bowie&#x27;s name and the album title; in the US the title was instead printed on a sticker and placed onto the translucent wrapping. According to Cann, initial UK pressings were laminated, which enhanced the colour to create a &quot;superior finish&quot;; these pressings are now collector&#x27;s items. The back cover featured Bowie&#x27;s handwritten notes about each song from the album. It also bore the credit &quot;Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)&quot; – the &quot;actor&quot; being Bowie himself, whose &quot;pet conceit&quot;, in the words of the &quot;NME&quot; critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, was &quot;to think of himself as an actor&quot;.

== Release ==

A few months after he had terminated Bowie&#x27;s contract with Mercury, Defries showcased the newly recorded &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; to multiple labels in the US, including New York City&#x27;s RCA Records. Defries told RCA that they &quot;had nothing since the fifties&quot; but they could &quot;own the seventies&quot; if they hired Bowie. &quot;Because David Bowie is going to remake the decade, just like the Beatles did in the sixties.&quot; Its head Dennis Katz had never heard of Bowie but recognised the potential of the piano-based songs that Defries played for him and signed the artist to a three-record deal on 9September 1971; RCA would be Bowie&#x27;s label for the rest of the decade.

&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was released in the UK on 17December 1971 through RCA. By this time, the sessions for &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; were underway. The album release was supported by the single &quot;Changes&quot; on 7January 1972. The album received little promotion from RCA due to its unusual cover image and a warning that Bowie would be changing his image for his next album. Pegg writes that there were disagreements over how much money was put into the album and whether Bowie was an &quot;unproven one-hit-wonder&quot;. Marketing manager Geoff Hannington recalled in 1986: &quot;We soon knew we were in a situation where the artist was going to change like a chameleon from time to time.&quot; Because of this, the album initially sold poorly and failed to break the UK Albums Chart. According to Sandford, the album barely sold 5,000 copies in the first quarter.

It was only after the breakthrough of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; in mid-1972 that &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; became a commercial success. It climbed to number three in the UK (two places higher than &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;), and remained on the chart for 69 weeks. &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; also peaked at number 39 on the Kent Music Report in Australia. Gallucci writes that although the album did not make Bowie a star, it &quot;got him noticed&quot;, and the success of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; helped &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; garner a larger audience. RCA released &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; as a single on 22June 1973, which also made number three in Britain. A reissue returned the album to the UK chart in January 1981, where it remained for 51 weeks.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was met with very positive reviews from several British and American publications. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; called it &quot;the most inventive piece of song-writing to have appeared on record in a considerable time&quot;, while Danny Holloway of the &quot;NME&quot; described it as Bowie &quot;at his brilliant best&quot;. Holloway added that &quot;[&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; is] a breath of fresh air compared to the usual mainstream rock LP of [1972]. It&#x27;s very possible that this will be the most important album from an emerging artist in 1972, because he&#x27;s not following trends – he&#x27;s setting them&quot;. In the US, John Mendelsohn of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most engaging album musically&quot; up to that point and praised his songwriting, particularly his ability to convey ideas without employing &quot;a barrage of seemingly impregnable verbiage&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; gave the album a positive review, praising it as &quot;a heavy debut for RCA, loaded with the kind of Top 40 and FM appeal that should break him through big on the charts. Strong material, his own, for programming includes &#x27;Changes&#x27;, &#x27;Oh! You Pretty Things&#x27;, and &#x27;Life on Mars?&#x27;&quot;.

Several reviewers praised Bowie as an artist. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that with &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, Bowie became &quot;the most intellectually brilliant man yet to choose the long-playing album as his medium of expression&quot;, while &quot;Rock&quot; magazine called him &quot;the most singularly gifted artist making music today. He has the genius to be to the &#x27;70s what Lennon, McCartney, Jagger and Dylan were to the &#x27;60s.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau hailed Bowie as &quot;a singer-composer with brains, imagination, and a good idea of how to use a recording console&quot;, and the album &quot;a quick change tour de force that is both catchy and deeply felt&quot;.

&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; has continued to receive critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie&#x27;s best works. Many reviewers have praised the songwriting, with a writer for &quot;Blender&quot; calling the songs some of the best Bowie has ever written. Others, including Bryan Wawzenek of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, have commended the wide array of genres present in the songs and their ability to blend together throughout. Erlewine wrote: &quot;On the surface, [having] such a wide range of styles and sounds would make an album incoherent, but Bowie&#x27;s improved songwriting and determined sense of style instead made &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; a touchstone for reinterpreting pop&#x27;s traditions into fresh, postmodern pop music&quot;. Similarly, Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the album as &quot;the first taste of Bowie&#x27;s multifaceted genius&quot;.

In a 2013 readers&#x27; poll for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was voted Bowie&#x27;s second greatest album, behind &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;. Douglas Wolk of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewed the album&#x27;s remaster for the 2015 box set &quot;Five Years 1969–1973&quot; and gave it a 10-out-of-10 rating, believing the songs to be &quot;scattered but splendid&quot; and finding Bowie&#x27;s songwriting a &quot;huge leap&quot; from his previous works. Another &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer, Ryan Schrieber, stated: &quot;The album is by no means his most cohesive release, but it remains one of his most charming, and unquestionably, one of his best.&quot; Following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it as one of Bowie&#x27;s essential albums, writing, &quot;&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was the album where he staked his claim as the most altered ego in rock &amp; roll.&quot;

==Influence and legacy==

Many biographers and reviewers have agreed that &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; marked the beginning of Bowie&#x27;s artistic success. Pegg writes: &quot;&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; stands at the first great crossroads in Bowie&#x27;s career. It was his last album until &quot;Low&quot; to be presented purely as a sonic artefact rather than a vehicle for the dramatic visual element with which he was soon to make his name as a performer&quot;. Buckley notes that 1971 was a pivotal year for Bowie, the year in which he became &quot;something of a pop-art agent provocateur&quot;. In a time when rock musicians looked to traditions and established standards, Bowie looked to be radically different and challenge tradition, reinventing himself again and again, thereby creating new standards and conventions. Buckley further said: &quot;Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie&#x27;s future career&quot;. Spitz writes that many artists have their &quot;it all came together on this one&quot; record. &quot;For David Bowie, it&#x27;s &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;&quot;. The biographer Paul Trynka states that the record marked a &quot;new beginning&quot; for the artist and that has a &quot;freshness&quot; to it that all of Bowie&#x27;s previous studio albums lacked, primarily because when making his previous albums, Bowie was working to satisfy record executives. When making &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, Bowie was working to satisfy himself, which is reflected in the record.

BBC Music&#x27;s Daryl Easlea wrote that the album saw Bowie finding his own voice after &quot;scrabbling around stylistically&quot; for almost a decade and &quot;finally demonstrated [his] enormous potential to the listening public&quot;. Schrieber stated: &quot;&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; marked the true start of what would be one of the most successful careers in rock music, spawning millions of scarily obsessive fans.&quot; Similarly, Michael Gallucci of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; contended that &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; is &quot;where Bowie starts to become Bowie&quot;, featuring lyrical and stylistic themes he would replicate on future releases. He concludes that all Bowie&#x27;s future guises begin to find their voices with &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. &quot;NME&quot;″s Emily Barker called it Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most time-tested album&quot; and wrote, &quot;it was [his] incredible song-writing gifts on [the record] that convinced us he was beamed from the stars.&quot; Writer Colin Larkin called it his most &quot;eclectic&quot; album and served as the preparation for Bowie&#x27;s subsequent changes in musical direction. In 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Joe Lynch argued that &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; provided the &quot;blueprint&quot; for lo-fi indie pop records for the next 25 years, citing Ariel Pink as an artist influenced by the album.

Many musicians have acknowledged the album&#x27;s influence. In 1999, Dave Stewart of Eurythmics said: &quot;&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; – I love the sound of it. I still kind of use it as a sort of reference-point.&quot; In 2002, Culture Club&#x27;s Boy George cited &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; as the record that changed his life, saying: &quot;The album as a whole is so unusual, so far removed from anything you heard on the radio. It&#x27;s so complete, it all fits together.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2007, KT Tunstall declared &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; her favorite album, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s the only record where I&#x27;ve experienced total jaw-dropping awe for the whole of it because that feeling of being lost and being taken somewhere else is so strong.&quot; In an interview with &quot;NME&quot; the following year, Guy Garvey of Elbow recognised &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; as the album that had influenced him the most.

=== Reissues ===
The album has been reissued multiple times. Following its release on compact disc in the mid-1980s, &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was rereleased by Rykodisc/EMI in 1990 with bonus tracks, including the outtake &quot;Bombers&quot;. In 1999, the original album was rereleased on CD through Virgin/EMI with 24-bit digitally remastered sound. This edition was reissued in 2014 by Parlophone, having acquired the Virgin-owned Bowie catalogue. In 2015, the album was remastered for the &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot; box set. It was released in CD, vinyl, and digital formats, both as part of this compilation and separately. In 2021, to celebrate the record&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Parlophone announced a vinyl picture disc reissue of the album (2015 remaster), which was released on 7January 2022. The announcement coincided with the digital release of a new mix of &quot;Changes&quot; by Scott. In November 2022, a multi-disc box set focusing on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was released with the title &quot;Divine Symmetry: The Journey to Hunky Dory&quot;. The collection comprises home demos, BBC radio sessions, alternate mixes, and other live and studio recordings from 1971. It also includes the 2015 remaster, as well as an &quot;alternative&quot; version of &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, made up of alternate mixes; the latter was released separately on vinyl in February 2023.

=== Rankings ===
&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; has frequently appeared on several lists of the greatest albums of all time by multiple publications. In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers voted it the 43rd greatest album of all time; in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 16 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. The album ranked number 16 and number 23 in the 1998 and 2000 editions of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, respectively. In their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 107 in 2003, number 108 in the 2012 revised list, and number 88 in the 2020 revised list. In 2004, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the album 80th on their list of the 100 Best Albums of the 1970s, one place above &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;. In the same year, VH1 placed it 47th in their list of the 100 greatest albums. In 2010, &quot;Time&quot; magazine chose it as one of the 100 best albums of all time, with journalist Josh Tyrangiel praising Bowie&#x27;s &quot;earthbound ambition to be a boho poet with prodigal style&quot;. The same year, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked the album number 18 on their list of the 100 greatest albums of all time. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album third in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, behind the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; and the Smiths&#x27; &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; included it in their list of the 100 best rock albums from the 1970s. In 2021, &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it the sixth best album of 1971. Robert Dimery included the album in his 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>The Journal was a current affairs newsmagazine television program broadcast on CBC Television from 1982 to 1992. It aired weeknights at 10:22 pm, following &quot;The National&quot; at 10 pm, and expanding on stories presented on there with in-depth interviews, documentaries, and televised &quot;town hall&quot; meetings. The division of the 10:00 hour into two entirely separate programs, and the length of each, reflect the separation and political tension between the CBC&#x27;s then-separate news and public affairs production units.

The program premiered on January 11, 1982. In its first season, it was hosted by Barbara Frum and Mary Lou Finlay, and was the first network news program in the world hosted by two women without a male co-anchor. However, after the first season Frum became the program&#x27;s sole host, although Finlay remained with the program as a reporter and documentary producer. Frum anchored on her own until her death in 1992. The program was produced for its entire run by Mark Starowicz, who had produced &quot;As It Happens&quot; for CBC Radio, which also featured Frum. Guest hosts when Frum was absent from &quot;The Journal&quot; included Bill Cameron, Peter Kent, Keith Morrison, Lyn Whitham and Brian Stewart.

Interviews were generally conducted in the early years of the program using a technique known as the double-ender, wherein guests were interviewed earlier in the day on videotape and later presented as live using a split screen. As satellite television technology progressed and became more commonplace, interviews were instead conducted using satellite uplinks.

Beginning in the late 1980s, Friday night&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Journal&quot; was frequently given over to arts and literature, under the rubric Friday Night Arts. The Friday arts program was anchored by Daniel Richler or David Gilmour. At other times, an entire show—or even, in one case, an entire week of shows—would be devoted to a single topic, usually in the form of the &quot;full-edition documentary&quot;; documentary topics ranged from the serious (aboriginal land claims and the Oka crisis) to the mundane (a 30-minute exposé on feet). One of the most memorable documentaries was a two-part travelogue by Allen Abel driving from Budapest to Bucharest two days after the fall of the Ceauşescu regime in Romania.

&quot;The Journal&quot; was based on CBC Winnipeg&#x27;s successful suppertime program, &quot;24Hours&quot;. It also bore many similarities in its format to the American program &quot;Nightline&quot; which premiered three years earlier, in 1979.

==Cancellation==
Following Frum&#x27;s death in 1992, and with plans underway to move their daily news and current affairs hour to 9 pm, the CBC chose to also revamp its entire approach to TV news programming. In the fall of 1992, &quot;CBC Prime Time News&quot; debuted with Peter Mansbridge and Pamela Wallin as equal cohosts of a package that mixed news and &quot;Journal&quot;-type features into a single program. That format lasted only two years before reverting to the old &quot;National&quot;/&quot;Journal&quot; format, although the name &quot;Prime Time News&quot; persisted for another year. When the news program returned to the name &quot;The National&quot; in 1995, the current affairs program became &quot;The National Magazine&quot;. This subsequently was renamed &quot;The Magazine&quot;. It was again reintegrated into the first half news program, as &quot;The National&quot;, in 2001.
