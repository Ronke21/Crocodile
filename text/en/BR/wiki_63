<text>Michael E. Kinsley (born March 9, 1951) is an American political journalist and commentator. Primarily active in print media as both a writer and editor, he also became known to television audiences as a co-host on &quot;Crossfire&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Kinsley was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Lillian (Margolis) and George Kinsley, who practiced medicine. Kinsley is Jewish. He attended the Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, then graduated from Harvard College in 1972. At Harvard, Kinsley served as vice president of the university&#x27;s daily newspaper, &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, then returned to Harvard for law school.

== Early career ==
While a third-year law student, Kinsley began working at &quot;The New Republic&quot;. He was allowed to finish his Harvard juris doctor degree through courses at the evening program at George Washington University Law School.

Kinsley&#x27;s first exposure to a national television audience was as moderator of William Buckley&#x27;s &quot;Firing Line.&quot; In 1979, he became editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot; and wrote the magazine&#x27;s TRB column for most of the 1980s and 1990s. That column was reprinted in a variety of newspaper op-ed pages, including &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and made Kinsley&#x27;s reputation as a leading political writer. He shared the 1986 Gerald Loeb Award for Commentary.

In 1984, he wrote that &quot;A gaffe is when a politician tells the truth&quot;, giving rise to the concept of a Kinsley gaffe. In 1986, he organized a contest for readers of &quot;The New Republic&quot; to find a newspaper headline more boring than &quot;Worthwhile Canadian Initiative&quot;. The contest was won by &quot;Debate goes on over the nature of reality&quot;, and &quot;Worthwhile Canadian Initiative&quot; became a long-running joke among journalists and bloggers.

Kinsley also served as managing editor of &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; (in the mid-1970s, while still in school), editor at &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; (for a year and a half in the early 1980s), and American editor of &quot;The Economist&quot; (a short-term, honorary position).

==&quot;Crossfire&quot; and &quot;Slate&quot;==
From 1989 to 1995, Kinsley appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot;, co-hosting with conservative Pat Buchanan. Representing the liberal position in the televised political debates, Kinsley combined a dry wit with nerdy demeanor and analytical skills.

In January 1995, Kinsley had a cameo on the first episode of the TV sitcom &quot;Women of the House&quot;, in which the show&#x27;s main character, Suzanne Sugarbaker, was a guest on &quot;Crossfire&quot;. He also appeared in three movies during the 1990s: &quot;Rising Sun&quot; (1993), &quot;Dave&quot; (also 1993), and &quot;The Birdcage&quot; (1996).

After leaving &quot;Crossfire&quot; in 1995, Kinsley returned to his editorial roots, relocating to Seattle to become founding editor of Microsoft&#x27;s online journal, &quot;Slate&quot;. In 1998 he was considered for the position of editor in chief of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In 1999 he was named Editor of the Year by the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; for his work at &quot;Slate&quot;.

Kinsley stepped down from &quot;Slate&quot; in 2002, shortly after disclosing that he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Subsequent positions==

Kinsley next moved to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as editorial page editor in April 2004. He maintained his Seattle residence and often worked from there, commuting to Los Angeles on a part-time basis. During his tenure, Kinsley tried to overhaul the paper&#x27;s editorial page and led an abortive experiment with a Wikitorial, while also receiving criticism from USC professor and feminist advocate Susan Estrich alleging a dearth of editorials written by women. Kinsley announced his departure in September 2005 after a falling out with the publisher.

He returned to writing a weekly column for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Slate&quot;, and in 2006 he served briefly as American editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He also became a regular columnist for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, but in May 2009 wrote that the magazine had &quot;dumped&quot; him.

On September 9, 2010, Kinsley and MSNBC pundit Joe Scarborough joined the staff of &quot;Politico&quot; as the publication&#x27;s first opinion columnists. On April 29, 2011, Bloomberg L.P. announced that Kinsley had joined the Bloomberg View editorial board. In January 2013, Kinsley re-joined &quot;The New Republic&quot; as editor at large. In January 2014, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; announced that Kinsley would become a contributing editor and write a monthly column.

==Personal life==
In 2002, Kinsley married Patty Stonesifer, a longtime top executive at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (As a Microsoft vice president, she had managed the Microsoft news portion of the MSNBC merger, which included &quot;Slate&quot;.) Stonesifer has two adult children from a previous marriage. She is president and CEO of Martha&#x27;s Table, a non-profit that develops sustainable solutions to poverty.

In 2002, Kinsley revealed that he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and on July 12, 2006, he underwent deep brain stimulation, a type of surgery designed to reduce its symptoms.

<doc id="524600" wikidata="Q1318197" url="?curid=524600" title="Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem">
<text>The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) is one of the last remaining large, nearly intact ecosystems in the northern temperate zone of Earth. It is located within the northern Rocky Mountains, in areas of northwestern Wyoming, southwestern Montana, and eastern Idaho, and is about . Yellowstone National Park and the Yellowstone Caldera &#x27;hotspot&#x27; are within it.

The area is a flagship site among conservation groups that promote ecosystem management. It is one of the world&#x27;s foremost natural laboratories in landscape ecology and Holocene geology, and is a world-renowned recreational destination. It is also home to the diverse native plants and animals of Yellowstone.

==History==
Yellowstone National Park boundaries were drawn in 1872 with the intent to include all the known geothermal basins in the region. As landscape ecology considerations were not incorporated into original boundary, revisions were suggested to conform more closely to natural topographic features, such as the ridgeline of the Absaroka Range along the east boundary. In 1929, President Hoover signed the first bill changing the park&#x27;s boundaries: The northwest corner now included a significant area of petrified trees; the northeast corner was defined by the watershed of Pebble Creek; the eastern boundary included the headwaters of the Lamar River and part of the watershed of the Yellowstone River. In 1932, President Hoover issued an executive order that added more than between the north boundary and the Yellowstone River, west of Gardiner. These lands provided winter range for elk and other ungulates. By the 1970s, the grizzly bear&#x27;s (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;) range in and near the park became the first informal minimum boundary of a theoretical &quot;Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem&quot; that included at least . Since then, definitions of the greater ecosystem&#x27;s size have steadily grown larger. A 1994 study listed the size as , while a 1994 speech by a Greater Yellowstone Coalition leader enlarged that to .

In 1985 the United States House of Representatives Subcommittees on Public Lands and National Parks and Recreation held a joint subcommittee hearing on Greater Yellowstone, resulting in a 1986 report by the Congressional Research Service outlining shortcomings in inter-agency coordination and concluding that the area&#x27;s essential values were at risk.

==Protected areas==

Federally managed areas within the GYE include: 
* United States National Park Service (NPS) — Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway.
* United States National Forest Service (USFS) — Gallatin, Custer, Beaverhead-Deerlodge, Caribou-Targhee, Bridger-Teton, and Shoshone National Forests
* United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) — National Elk Refuge, Red Rock Lakes and Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuges

Ten distinct National Wilderness Areas have been established within the GYE&#x27;s National Forests since 1966, mandating a higher level of habitat protection than the USFS otherwise uses.

The GYE also encompasses some privately held and state lands surrounding those managed by the U.S. Government.

The Trust for Public Land has protected over about 40 projects in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

==Animals and plant diversity==
=== Large mammals ===
The GYE is home to some of North America&#x27;s most iconic wildlife. The ecosystem supports the largest free-roaming herds of American bison (Bison bison) on public land, a species central to the region&#x27;s ecological balance. Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) and gray wolves (Canis lupus) are apex predators that play crucial roles in regulating prey populations.

Elk (Cervus canadensis) are abundant and form a key component of the ecosystem, providing sustenance for predators. Other significant ungulate species include moose (Alces alces), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus).

===Birds===

The GYE is home to a variety of birds, including iconic species like Bald Eagles, Golden Eagles and Peregrine Falcons. Osprey populations around Yellowstone Lake, have experienced declines, linked to the decrease in Cutthroat Trout. Several bird species act as keystone species within the GYE. For example, the Clark&#x27;s Nutcracker plays a crucial role in the dispersal of the all-important Whitebark Pine seeds.

==Management by species==
Ecological management has been most often advanced through concerns over individual species rather than over broader ecological principles. Though 20 or 30 or even 50 years of information on a population may be considered long-term by some, one of the important lessons of Greater Yellowstone management is that even half a century is not long enough to give a full idea of how a species may vary in its occupation of a wild ecosystem.

The Yellowstone hot springs are important for their diversity of thermophilic bacteria. These bacteria have been useful in studies of the evolution of photosynthesis and as sources of thermostable enzymes for molecular biology. Although the smell of sulfur is common and there are some sulfur fixing cyanobacteria, it has been found that hydrogen is being used as an energy source by extremophile microbes.

===Flora===

Among native plants of the GYE, whitebark pine (&quot;Pinus albicaulis&quot;) is a species of special interest, in large part because of its seasonal importance to grizzly bears, but also because its distribution could be dramatically reduced by relatively minor global warming. In this case, researchers do not have a good long-term data set on the species, but they understand its ecology well enough to project declining future conservation status. A more immediate and serious threat to whitebark pines is an introduced fungal rust disease, White Pine Blister Rust (&quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot;), which is causing heavy mortality in the species. Occasional resistant individuals occur, but in the short to medium term, a severe population decline is expected.

Estimates of the decline of quaking aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;) on the park&#x27;s northern range since 1872 range from 50% to 95%. The decline has been linked to multiple stressors, such as defoliation by the forest tent caterpillar (&quot;Malacosoma disstria&quot;), aspen bark beetles (&quot;Trypophloeus populi&quot; and &quot;Procryphalus mucronatus&quot;), wood-boring beetles such as the poplar borer (&quot;Saperda calcarata&quot;) and the bronze poplar borer (&quot;Agrilus liragus&quot;), fungal disturbances such as those by the Cytospora canker (&quot;Valsa sordida&quot;), and Climate change related stressors. 

===Fauna===

Anecdotal information on grizzly bear abundance dates to the mid-19th century, and administrators have made informal population estimates for more than 70 years. From these sources, ecologists know the species was common in Greater Yellowstone when Europeans arrived and that the population was not isolated before the 1930s, but is now. Researchers do not know if bears were more or less common than now.

A 1959-1970 bear study suggested a grizzly bear population size of about 176, later revised to about 229. Later estimates have ranged as low as 136 and as high as 540; the most recent is a minimum estimate of 236, but biologists think there may be as many as 1,000 bears in the ecosystem. Although the Greater Yellowstone population is relatively close to recovery goals, the plan&#x27;s definition of recovery is controversial. Thus, even though the population may be stable or possibly increasing in the short term, in the longer term, continued habitat loss, climate change, and increasing human activities may well reverse the trend.

Yellowstone cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri&quot;) have suffered considerable declines since European settlement, but recently began flourishing in some areas. Especially in Yellowstone Lake itself, long-term records indicate an almost remarkable restoration of robust populations from only three decades ago when the numbers of this fish were depleted because of excessive harvest. Its current recovery, though a significant management achievement, does not begin to restore the species&#x27; historical abundance. Also, they declined because of invasive lake trout. An aggressive lake trout removal program has caused the cutthroats to rebound.

Early accounts of pronghorn (&quot;Antilocapra americana&quot;) in Greater Yellowstone described herds of hundreds seen ranging through most major river valleys. These populations were decimated by 1900, and declines continued among remaining herds. On the park&#x27;s northern range, pronghorn declined from 500 to 700 in the 1930s to about 122 in 1968. By 1992 the herd had increased to 536.

====Gray Wolf reintroduction====

The park is a commonly cited example of apex predators affecting an ecosystem through a trophic cascade. After the reintroduction of the gray wolf in 1995, researchers noticed drastic changes occurring. Elk, the primary prey of the gray wolf, became less abundant and changed their behavior, freeing riparian zones from constant grazing. The respite allowed willows and aspens to grow, creating habitat for beaver, moose, and scores of other species. In addition to the effects on prey species, the gray wolf&#x27;s presence also affected the park&#x27;s grizzly bear population. The bears, emerging from hibernation, chose to scavenge off wolf kills to gain needed energy and fatten up after fasting for months. Dozens of other species have been documented scavenging from wolf kills.

<doc id="524606" wikidata="Q1865060" url="?curid=524606" title="Gauntlet II">
<text>Gauntlet II is a 1986 arcade game produced by Atari Games that serves as the immediate sequel to the original &quot;Gauntlet&quot;, which was released the previous year. Like its predecessor, &quot;Gauntlet II&quot; is a fantasy-themed top down dungeon crawler game and was released as a dedicated cabinet, as well as a conversion kit, both available in 2-player and 4-player versions.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Gauntlet II&quot; is essentially an expanded version of the original &quot;Gauntlet&quot;. Like in the original game, there are four character classes to play as, with the choices being Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard and Elf. The main difference from the original game is that multiple players can now choose to play as the same character class. Because of this each player is now distinguished by the palette of their character, with red and blue being in all versions of the game, while yellow and green are featured in the 4-player version. New voice samples were added in &quot;Gauntlet II&quot;, identifying each player by their color and class (e.g. &quot;Yellow Elf&quot;, &quot;Red Wizard&quot;).

New level designs were added, including the possibility of encountering them in altered ways by having the play-field turned in steps of 90°. Other new features include the enemy &quot;It&quot;, which upon contact made a player &quot;It&quot; and drew all enemies towards them. The only way to release this curse is by touching another player or entering the exit, turning any level containing &quot;It&quot; into a fantasy filled game of tag. Other notable additions include the ability to ricochet shots off walls by means of a special pick-up, acid puddles that caused large, predetermined amounts of damage and a large dragon which occupied multiple squares and required multiple hits to destroy.

New level elements were also added, adding more variety to the original game. These included &quot;all walls are invisible&quot;, &quot;magic walls&quot; which changed into monsters or items when hit, &quot;stun tiles&quot; which stunned the player, and fake exits.

Another challenge in the game is the possibility to find a &quot;secret room&quot;. This can be found by completing specific achievements within the level (e.g., &quot;don&#x27;t be fooled&quot;, means that you must find the real exit first). The secret room contains items such as food and magic potions (extra shot power, extra shot speed, extra magic power, extra speed, extra armor and extra fight power).

==Development==
Shortly after the release of the original &quot;Gauntlet&quot;, until March 31, 1986, Atari Games held a contest where players submitted level designs, game ideas, and other suggestions for a potential &quot;Gauntlet&quot; sequel. The winners of the contest were announced in the April 1986 issue of Atari Games&#x27; newsletter, and the developers implemented some of those submissions in &quot;Gauntlet II&quot;. During the release of &quot;Gauntlet II&quot;, Atari Games held a second contest where players were tasked to find the secret rooms in the game itself. After fulfilling a certain task, the players were given a code, which they submitted to Atari Games via an entry form; the grand prize was a U.S. government saving bond valued at $5000, and the first 500 entries received a t-shirt. The contest was held until December 19.

==Releases==
&quot;Gauntlet II&quot; was ported to the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS in 1987. These versions of the game were released in North America by Mindscape and in Europe by U.S. Gold. Most versions only supported two players, but the Atari ST version supported an adaptor that allowed two further joysticks (totalling four) to be connected via that machine&#x27;s parallel port. Mindscape later ported the game to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990 and the Game Boy in 1991. The NES version of &quot;Gauntlet II&quot; was one of the earliest games for the console that supported up to four players, being compatible with either the NES Four Score or NES Satellite adapters. Unlike the NES version of the first &quot;Gauntlet&quot;, &quot;Gauntlet II&quot; was a more direct conversion of the arcade original, lacking any sort of storyline or ending.

&quot;Gauntlet II&quot; is also included in the compilations &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures 2&quot; (released for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube in 2004) and &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot; (released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2012). A stand-alone port of the game was also released by Sony Online Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 on May 3, 2007 as a downloadable game on the PlayStation Store, but has since been delisted.

==Reception==
The Game Boy version was praised by the German &quot;Play Time&quot; magazine for its technical implementation (including 8-directional scrolling), faithful recreation of graphics, and for evoking nostalgic feelings with similar sound effects; however, this version was criticized for difficult-to-recognize sprites and its technically weak theme music.

The Spectrum version of the game was well received, &quot;Sinclair User&quot; said it was &quot;a corker. Fast action and superb gameplay make &quot;Gauntlet II&quot; probably the first sequel worth the cash&quot;. &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; said it was &quot;a &#x27;must have&#x27; for all of you who asked for Gauntlet on your Desert Island Disks&quot;. Both &quot;YS&quot; and &quot;Crash&quot; gave the main weaknesses as the sound and the over-similarity to the original.

In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listed &quot;Gauntlet II&quot; as the 3rd best arcade game of all time.

== History ==
Originally, the region was divided into two provinces of Owari and Mikawa. After the Meiji Restoration, Owari and Mikawa were united into a single entity. In 1871, after the abolition of the han system, Owari, with the exception of the Chita Peninsula, was established as Nagoya Prefecture, while Mikawa combined with the Chita Peninsula and formed Nukata Prefecture. Nagoya Prefecture was renamed to Aichi Prefecture in April 1872 and was united with Nukata Prefecture on November 27 of the same year.

The government of Aichi Prefecture is located in the Aichi Prefectural Government Office in Nagoya, which is the old capital of Owari. The Aichi Prefectural Police and its predecessor organisations have been responsible for law enforcement in the prefecture since 1871.

The Expo 2005 World Exposition was held in Seto and Nagakute.

===Etymology===
In the third volume of the there is a poem by Takechi Kurohito that reads: &quot;The cry of the crane, calling to Sakurada; it sounds like the tide, draining from Ayuchi flats, hearing the crane cry&quot;. Ayuchi is the original form of the name &quot;Aichi&quot;, and the Fujimae tidal flat is all that remains of the earlier Ayuchi-gata. It is now a protected area.

For a time, an Aichi Station existed on the Kansai Line (at the time the Kansai Railway) between Nagoya and Hatta stations, but its role was overtaken by Sasashima-raibu Station on the Aonami Line and Komeno Station on the Kintetsu Nagoya Line.

<text>A chief petty officer (CPO) is a senior non-commissioned officer in many navies and coast guards, usually above petty officer.

==By country==

===Australia===
&quot;Chief Petty Officer&quot; is the second highest non-commissioned rank in the Royal Australian Navy.

===Canada===
&quot;Chief petty officer&quot; refers to two ranks in the Royal Canadian Navy. A chief petty officer 2nd class (CPO2) ( or in French) is equivalent to a master warrant officer in the Army and Air Force, and chief petty officer 1st class (CPO1) ( or ) is equivalent to a chief warrant officer in the Army and Air Force. In spoken references, chief petty officers may be addressed as &quot;chief&quot; but are never addressed as &quot;sir&quot;.

===India===

A Chief petty officer in Indian Navy is a junior-commissioned officer. This rank is equivalent to Naib subedar in Indian Army and Junior warrant officer in Indian Air force. The two highest enlisted ranks are Master Chief Petty Officer Second Class (MCPO II), equivalent to Subedar/Warrant Officer and Master Chief Petty Officer First Class (MCPO I), equivalent to Subedar Major/Master Warrant Officer in Indian Army/Indian Air Force respectively.

===Pakistan===
Fleet chief petty officer is a commissioned and gazetted rank in Pakistan Navy above chief petty officer and below master chief petty officer. It is equivalent to the Pakistan Air Force warrant officer and the Pakistan Army subedar.

===Philippines===

In the Philippine Navy, the rank of chief petty officer, is equivalent to master sergeant in the Philippine Marine Corps and Philippine Air Force.

===United Kingdom===
In the Royal Navy, the rank of chief petty officer comes above that of petty officer and below that of warrant officer class 2. It is the equivalent of colour sergeant in the Royal Marines, colour sergeant or staff sergeant in the Army, and flight sergeant in the Royal Air Force.
===United States===

Chief petty officer is an E-7 enlisted rank in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, just above petty officer first class and below senior chief petty officer. Chief petty officers are classified as senior non-commissioned officers. The grade of chief petty officer was established on April 1, 1893, for the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Congress first authorized the U.S. Coast Guard to use the promotion to chief petty officer on 18 May 1920.

Unlike petty officer first class and lower rates, advancement to chief petty officer in the U.S. Navy not only carries requirements of time in service, superior evaluation scores, and specialty examinations, but also carries an added requirement of peer review.

<text>Diplomatic recognition in international law is a unilateral declarative political act of a state that acknowledges an act or status of another state or government in control of a state (may be also a recognized state). Recognition can be accorded either on a &quot;de facto&quot; or &quot;de jure&quot; basis. Partial recognition can occur if many sovereign states refuse to recognize an entity as a peer. Recognition can be a declaration to that effect by the recognizing government or may be implied from an act of recognition, such as entering into a treaty with the other state or making a state visit. Recognition may, but need not, have domestic and international legal consequences. If sufficient countries recognise a particular entity as a state, that state may have a right to membership in international organizations, while treaties may require all existing member countries unanimously agreeing to the admission of a new member.

A vote by a country in the United Nations in favour of the membership of another country is an implicit recognition of that country by the country so voting, as only states may be members of the UN. On the other hand, a negative vote for UN membership does not necessarily mean non-recognition of the applicant as a state, as other criteria, requirements or special circumstances may be considered relevant for UN membership. Similarly, a country may choose not to apply for UN membership for its own reasons, as is the case with Vatican City, and Switzerland was not a member until 2002 because of its concerns to maintain its neutrality policy.

The non-recognition of particular acts of a state does not normally affect the recognition of the state itself. For example, the international rejection of the occupation of particular territory by a recognised state does not imply non-recognition of the state itself, nor a rejection of a change of government by illegal means.

==Recognition of states and governments==
Diplomatic recognition must be distinguished from formal recognition of states or their governments. The fact that states do not maintain bilateral diplomatic relations does not mean that they do not recognize or treat one another as states. A state is not required to accord formal bilateral recognition to any other state, and some have a general policy of not doing so, considering that a vote for its membership of an international organisation restricted to states, such as the United Nations, is an act of recognition.

===History===
Some consider that a state has a responsibility not to recognize as a state any entity that has attained the qualifications for statehood by a violation of basic principles of the UN Charter: the UN Security Council has in several instances (Resolution 216 (1965) and Resolution 217 (1965), concerning Rhodesia; Resolution 541 (1983), concerning Northern Cyprus; and Resolution 787 (1992), concerning the Republika Srpska) issued Chapter VII resolutions (binding in international law) that denied their statehood and precluded recognition. In the 2010 International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence, the ICJ ruled that &quot;general international law contains no applicable prohibition of declarations of independence.&quot; The Court carefully noted &quot;that in all of those instances the Security Council was making a determination as regards the concrete situation existing at the time that those declarations of independence were made; the illegality attached to the declarations of independence thus stemmed not from the unilateral character of these declarations as such, but from the fact that they were, or would have been, connected with the unlawful use of force or other egregious violations of norms of general international law, in particular, those of a peremptory character (jus cogens). In the context of Kosovo, the Security Council has never taken this position. The exceptional character of the resolutions enumerated above appears to the Court to confirm that no general prohibition against unilateral declarations of independence may be inferred from the practice of the Security Council.&quot;

States can exercise their recognition powers either explicitly or implicitly. The recognition of a government implies recognition of the state it governs, but even countries which have a policy of formally recognising states may not have a policy of doing the same regarding governments.

&quot;De facto&quot; recognition of states, rather than &quot;de jure&quot;, is rare. &quot;De jure&quot; recognition is stronger, while &quot;de facto&quot; recognition is more tentative and recognizes only that a government exercises control over a territory. An example of the difference is when the United Kingdom recognized the Soviet state &quot;de facto&quot; in 1921, but &quot;de jure&quot; only in 1924. Another example is the state of Israel in 1948, whose government was immediately recognized &quot;de facto&quot; by the United States and three days later &quot;de jure&quot; by the Soviet Union. Another example is the Republic of Indonesia which was whose government was recognized &quot;de facto&quot; by the Netherlands in 1946 and &quot;de jure&quot; by the international community in 1949. Also, the Republic of China, commonly known as &quot;Taiwan&quot;, is generally recognized as &quot;de facto&quot; independent and sovereign, but is not universally recognized as &quot;de jure&quot; independent due to the complex political status of Taiwan related to the United Nations&#x27; withdrawal of recognition in favor of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1971.

Renewing recognition of a government is not necessary when it changes in a normal, constitutional way (such as an election or referendum), but may be necessary in the case of a coup d&#x27;etat or revolution. Recognition of a new government by other states can be important for its long-term survival. For instance, the Taliban government of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, which lasted from 1996 to 2001, was recognized only by Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, while far more had recognized the government of ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani. The disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir under the control of India is not recognized by either Pakistan or the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and the Republic of Turkey.

Recognition can be implied by other acts, such as a visit of the head of state, or the signing of a bilateral treaty. If implicit recognition is possible, a state may feel the need to explicitly proclaim that its acts do not constitute diplomatic recognition, like when the United States commenced its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1988.

Formal diplomatic recognition can be used as a tool of political influence with examples including European Community&#x27;s conditional recognition of independence of former republics of SFR Yugoslavia in early 1990s dependent on new states commitment to protection of human and national minorities rights.

==Withdrawal of recognition ==
A state may withdraw diplomatic recognition of another state (despite doing so being specifically banned by the 1933 Montevideo Convention) or simply refuse to deal with that other country, after withdrawing from all diplomatic relations with that country, such as embassies and consulates, and requiring the other country to do the same. The state will appoint a protecting power to represent its interests in the other state.

The doctrine of non-recognition of illegal or immoral situations, like territorial gains achieved by force, is called the Stimson Doctrine, and has become more important since the Second World War, especially in the United Nations where it is a method of ensuring compliance with international law – for instance, in the case of Rhodesia in 1965. Withdrawal of recognition of a government is a more severe act of disapproval than the breaking of diplomatic relations.

== Recognition of governments ==
Besides recognizing other states, states also can recognize the governments of states. This can be problematic particularly when a new government comes to power by illegal means, such as a coup d&#x27;état, or when an existing government stays in power by fixing an election. States once formally recognized both the government of a state and the state itself, but many no longer follow that practice, even though, if diplomatic relations are to be maintained, it is necessary that there be a government with which to engage in diplomatic relations. Countries such as the United States answer queries over the recognition of governments with the statement: &quot;The question of recognition does not arise: we are conducting our relations with the new government.&quot;

==Unrecognized state==
Several of the world&#x27;s geopolitical entities lack general international recognition, but wish to be recognized as sovereign states. The degree of &quot;de facto&quot; control these entities exert over the territories they claim varies.

Most are subnational regions with an ethnic or national identity of their own that have separated from the original parent state. Such states are commonly referred to as &quot;break-away&quot; states. Some of these entities are in effect internally self-governing protectorates that enjoy military protection and informal diplomatic representation abroad through another state to prevent forced reincorporation into their original states.

The word &quot;control&quot; in this list refers to &quot;control&quot; over the area &quot;occupied&quot;, not &quot;occupation&quot; of the area &quot;claimed&quot;. Unrecognized countries may have either full control over their occupied territory (such as Northern Cyprus), or only partial control (such as Western Sahara). In the former, the &quot;de jure&quot; governments have little or no influence in the areas they claim to rule, whereas in the latter they have varying degrees of control, and may provide essential services to people living in the areas.

==Other types of recognition==

Other elements that may be recognized include occupation or annexation of territory, or belligerent rights of a party in a conflict. Recognition of the latter does not imply recognition of a state.

Formal recognition of belligerency, which is rare today, signifies that the parties to the civil war or other internal conflict &quot;are entitled to excise belligerent rights, thus accepting that the rebel group possesses sufficient international personality to support the position of such rights and duties.&quot; Extension of the rights of belligerency is usually done by other states, rather than by the government fighting the rebel group. (A 1907 report by William E. Fuller for the Spanish Treaty Claims Commission noted that &quot;A parent state never formally recognizes the insurgents as belligerents, although it may in fact treat them as such by carrying on war against them in accordance with the rules and usages of international warfare.&quot;)

Examples of recognition of belligerent status include:
*In 1823, the United Kingdom recognized the Greek revolutionaries against the Ottoman Empire as belligerents during the Greek War of Independence.
*The United Kingdom issued a soon after the outbreak of the American Civil War, which &quot;tacitly granted the Confederacy belligerent status, the right to contract loans and purchase supplies in neutral nations and to exercise belligerent rights on the high seas.&quot; Another right of significance accorded to belligerents that was seen as potentially significant at the time was the right to issue letters of marque. The British extension of belligerent recognition to the Confederacy greatly angered and concerned the United States, which strenuously and successfully worked to prevent full diplomatic recognition.
*During the Nicaraguan Civil War, the Andean Group (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela) &quot;declared that &#x27;a state of belligerency&#x27; existed in Nicaragua and that the forces of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) represented a &#x27;legitimate army. The declaration, made over the strong U.S. opposition, stated that the Sandinistas were eligible for &quot;treatment and prerogatives&quot; accorded to belligerents under international law. This declaration allowed the Andean countries to provide arms to the FSLN.
*During the Salvadoran Civil War, France and Mexico recognized the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front in El Salvador as a belligerent in August 1981.

<text>78 Derngate is a Grade II* listed Georgian house in the Cultural Quarter of Northampton, England, originally built in 1815. Its interior was extensively remodelled in 1916 and 1917 by the architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh for businessman Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke as his first marital home. Mackintosh&#x27;s designs for the house are considered to be one of the first examples of the Art Deco style to be seen in Britain. 

The rear elevation also features an extension with two elevated balconies which, in 1916, overlooked meadowland to the edge of Northampton. The design origins of this extension have been the subject of some scholarly debate and a myth of Mackintosh as a modernist pioneer in his late career has persisted. Recent research suggests that Bassett-Lowke and Alexander Ellis Anderson (a Northampton-based architect who supervised the remodelling) may also have had a hand in the design of this structure as well as Mackintosh.

In 1926 the Bassett-Lowkes moved to New Ways, a modernist house designed by Peter Behrens close to Abington Park; this house is also Grade II* listed.

Between 1964 and 1993 the building was used by Northampton High School for girls, initially as offices but later as classrooms. In 2002 work started to restore the house to Mackintosh&#x27;s original design. This work was under the direction of architects John McAslan + Partners and involved a team of specialist contractors for restoration, or replication of, the original features of the Mackintosh period scheme.

After eighteen months of restoration, the house was opened to the public in late 2003. Small group guided tours or self-guided visits are available and provide an insight into this Mackintosh-designed house in England.

A supporting museum adjoins 78 Derngate and is housed in number 80. In 2003, the Discovery Channel aired a documentary series hosted by Eric Knowles titled &quot;The House That Mackintosh Built&quot;. The series followed aspects of the property restoration as it was in progress. In May 2007 a new visitors centre at 82 Derngate was opened to provide further facilities and exhibitions for visitors. This building, also restored by John McAslan + Partners, houses a restaurant, art galleries, meeting rooms, shop, visitor reception and administration offices. A regular programme of exhibitions and events is offered and an active &#x27;Friends of 78 Derngate&#x27; group continues to raise funds for ongoing development of the project. On 3 October 2013, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, visited 78 Derngate to commemorate the 10th anniversary of its opening to the public.

On 21 March 2017 a commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the marriage of W. J. Bassett-Lowke and Florence Jane Jones was held at 78 Derngate. A centenary exhibition, &quot;Charles Rennie Mackintosh &amp; The Great War&quot; ran from 1 February – 29 April 2017. This comprised exhibits from the late career of Mackintosh and examined the wider context for his work on 78 Derngate against the background of the First World War. The exhibition was the largest display of Mackintosh design in England. A series of related events during the exhibition run featured experts giving public talks and workshops on related themes.

Artist and television presenter Lachlan Goudie featured 78 Derngate in his BBC documentary, &quot;Charles Rennie Mackintosh: Glasgow&#x27;s Neglected Genius&quot;. This was produced to mark the 150th anniversary of Mackintosh&#x27;s birth and was first broadcast on BBC Two Scotland on 5 June 2018. Goudie assessed the work on 78 Derngate as &quot;[t]he dazzling work of an artist willing to risk losing control&quot;, with the interior decor being presented as a bold &#x27;comeback attempt&#x27; by Mackintosh which was to prove to be in vain against the background of the First World War.

<text>Richard Lawrence Hatch (May 21, 1945 – February 7, 2017) was an American actor and writer. He began his career as a stage actor before moving on to television work in the 1970s. Hatch is best known for his role as Captain Apollo in the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; television series. He is also widely known for his role as Tom Zarek in the reimagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.

== Early life ==
Hatch was born on May 21, 1945, in Santa Monica, California, to John Raymond Hatch and Elizabeth Hatch (née White). He grew up with four siblings. While in high school, he aspired to become an athlete in pole vaulting, and only had a passing interest in acting, as he considered himself too shy and insecure. The assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, while Hatch had just started college, turned him towards acting; he had been enrolled in a required oral interpretation course at the time, and following the assassination, presented an article written about Kennedy upon which he said: &quot;As I began to read this article, I got so affected by what I was saying that I forgot myself. I was expressing feelings and emotions I tended to keep locked inside of myself.&quot;

== Career ==
=== Early work ===
Hatch began his theatrical career with the Los Angeles Repertory Theater, as well as shows in Chicago and Off-Broadway.

=== Television ===
Hatch began working in television in 1970 when he starred as Philip Brent in the daytime soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;, a role he played for two years. In the following years, he made guest appearances in prime time series such as &quot;Cannon&quot;; &quot;Nakia&quot;; &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;; &quot;The Rookies&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;; and &quot;The Waltons&quot;; as well as appearing in several made-for-TV movies such as &quot;F. Scott Fitzgerald and &#x27;The Last of the Belles&#x27;&quot; (1974) with Susan Sarandon;&quot;The Hatfields and the McCoys&quot; (1975) with Jack Palance; &quot;Addie and the King of Hearts&quot; (1976) with Jason Robards; and the 1978 television movie &quot;Deadman&#x27;s Curve,&quot; in which he portrayed Jan Berry of the musical duo Jan and Dean, alongside Bruce Davison as Dean Torrence.
In 1976, Hatch gained his first major television role as Inspector Dan Robbins on the detective series &quot;The Streets of San Francisco,&quot; as the replacement for Michael Douglas, who had played Inspector Steve Keller in the series, but had resigned from the cast that year. Though the role was for only one season, Hatch won Germany&#x27;s Bravo Youth Magazine Award for the role. Following this, he had a recurring role on the series &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,&quot; also for one season in 1977.

In 1978, Hatch gained a starring role in Glen A. Larson&#x27;s sci-fi series, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (1978), which aired for a single season before its high cost motivated its cancellation by ABC-TV. Hatch was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for the role. However, because Hatch held out for more money in the series&#x27; toy merchandising
with Mattel, his character was conspicuously absent in its action figure line, although Apollo would appear in subsequent revival &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; toylines over the decades.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Hatch made guest appearances on such series as &quot;Hotel;&quot; &quot;Murder, She Wrote;&quot; &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (romantically opposite 20-year-old Teri Hatcher in her first on-screen speaking role); &quot;Fantasy Island;&quot; &quot;Baywatch;&quot; &quot;Dynasty;&quot; and &quot;MacGyver.&quot; In 1990, Hatch returned to daytime soap operas and appeared on &quot;Santa Barbara,&quot; originating the character Steven Slade.

In 2013, Hatch made a guest appearance in an adult-oriented episode of &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot; on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim.

=== Films ===
Hatch made several low-key theatrical film releases, including &quot;Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen&quot; (1981) and &quot;Prisoners of the Lost Universe&quot; (1983). An abridged version of the pilot episode of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; was released in cinemas, initially overseas and then for a limited run in the U.S., as was a sequel film, &quot;Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack,&quot; which was also made from episodes of the series. He starred with Leif Garrett in &quot;Party Line&quot; (1988) and with Arte Johnson in &quot;Second Chance&quot; (1996).

=== &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; revival attempt ===

In the 1990s, Hatch attempted to revive &quot;Battlestar Galactica.&quot; He began writing novels based on the series, and also wrote, co-directed and executive-produced a trailer called &quot;Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming&quot; in the hopes of enticing Universal Studios – the rights holders for the franchise – into producing a new series. Hatch&#x27;s series would have been a direct continuation of the original 1978 series, and would have ignored the events of the failed spin-off &quot;Galactica 1980,&quot; in which Hatch had not appeared. Original actors John Colicos (Baltar), Terry Carter (Colonel Tigh) and Jack Stauffer (Bojay) appeared in the trailer with Hatch. Though the trailer won acclaim at science-fiction conventions, Universal was not interested in Hatch&#x27;s vision for the revival of &quot;Battlestar Galactica,&quot; and instead opted for a remake rather than the sequel for which Hatch had campaigned. Hatch, who had reportedly remortgaged his own house to produce the trailer, was bitterly disappointed by this turn of events and was highly critical of the prospective new series.

In 2004, he stated to Sci-Fi Pulse that he had felt resentment over the failure of his planned &quot;Galactica&quot; continuation and was left &quot;exhausted and sick... I had, over the past several years, bonded deeply with the original characters and story... writing the novels and the comic books and really campaigning to bring back the show.&quot;

=== &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; re-imagining ===

Despite his resentment, Hatch developed a respect for Ronald D. Moore, the remake show&#x27;s head writer and producer, when Moore appeared as a featured guest at Galacticon (the &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; 25th anniversary convention, hosted by Hatch) and answered questions posed by a hostile audience. Later, in 2004, Hatch was offered a recurring role in the new &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; series, which he accepted. He portrayed Tom Zarek, a terrorist turned politician who spent twenty years in prison for blowing up a government building. After Zarek&#x27;s death, Hatch commented that &quot;never did I play this character as a villain nor did I think he was one and I still feel that way,&quot; and that he considered the character to be a principled figure who is driven to violence after being &quot;blocked in every way possible&quot; by Roslin and Adama. &quot;Zarek, Adama and Roslin all wanted power for the same reason, to make a positive difference.&quot;

== Other work ==
Alongside his attempts to revive the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, Hatch created a trailer for his own space opera entitled &quot;The Great War of Magellan&quot;.

Hatch appeared in &quot;InAlienable,&quot; a 2008 science-fiction film written and produced by Walter Koenig. In 2011, Hatch worked on a new reality TV series called &quot;Who the Frak?&quot;, which he created and appeared in as himself. The series was touted as &quot;the world&#x27;s first social network reality drama.&quot; In 2012–13, Hatch appeared in the web series &quot;The Silicon Assassin Project&quot;. In 2013, he ventured into the Steampunk genre, starring in the short film &quot;Cowboys &amp; Engines&quot; alongside Malcolm McDowell and Walter Koenig. In 2014, he played the Klingon Commander Kharn in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan film &quot;Prelude To Axanar&quot; and was to appear in the subsequent fan production &quot;Star Trek: Axanar&quot; in 2015, though legal issues with Paramount Pictures prevented the project from being completed.

=== Writing ===
With various co-authors, Hatch wrote a series of seven tie-in novels set in the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; universe. The series included:
* Armageddon, published August 1, 1997,
* Warhawk, published September 1, 1998
* Resurrection, published July 1, 2001
* Rebellion, published July 1, 2002,
* Paradis, published July 1, 2003,
* Destiny, published June 29, 2004,
* Redemption, published November 25, 2005.

&quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Warhawk&quot; were both written with Christopher Golden. &quot;Resurrection&quot; was written with Stan Timmons. &quot;Rebellion&quot; was written with Alan Rodgers. &quot;Paradis&quot;, &quot;Destiny&quot;, and &quot;Redemption&quot; were all written with Brad Linaweaver.

== Death ==
Hatch died on February 7, 2017, of pancreatic cancer while he was under hospice care in Los Angeles, at age 71.

== Final film ==
In his final film performance, Hatch played director Haskell Edwards in the film &quot;Diminuendo&quot; which wrapped a few months before he learned of his pancreatic cancer. Hatch was able to see a rough cut of the film before he died, and a work-in-progress screening was held as a memorial shortly after his death. &quot;Diminuendo&quot; had its world premiere at the 20th Annual Sarasota Film Festival on April 20, 2018.

<doc id="524631" wikidata="Q7079053" url="?curid=524631" title="Offender Assessment System">
<text>OASys is the abbreviated term for the Offender Assessment System, used in England and Wales by His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service and the National Probation Service to measure the risks and needs of criminal offenders under their supervision. Initially developed in 2001, it was built upon the existing ‘What Works’ evidence base.

OASys is designed to enable a properly trained and qualified individual; often a Probation Officer, to:
* assess how likely an offender is to be re-convicted
* identify and classify offending-related needs, including basic personality characteristics and cognitive behavioural problems
* assess risk of serious harm, risks to the individual and other risks
* assist with management of risk of harm
* links the assessment to the supervision or sentence plan
* indicate the need for further specialist assessments
* measure change during the period of supervision / sentence.

OASys comprises a series of computer-based forms on which clinical evaluations are made by staff of Offenders, and supervision and sentence plans for the forthcoming period of supervision are recorded on a periodic basis - typically every 16 weeks for offenders in the community, and less frequently for imprisoned offenders.

OASys supports the &quot;What Works?&quot; initiative of the Prison and Probation Services, by providing metrics by which the characteristics of offenders and their offences (inputs) can be analysed alongside information on interventions made (inputs) to the offender, and re-conviction data for offenders (outcomes), in order to enable refinement to be made to interventions (based on a consideration of the relation between inputs and outcomes) as to improve outcomes - in other words, to decrease recidivism rates by ensuring that interventions are as appropriate and purposeful as possible.

<doc id="524632" wikidata="Q10896978" url="?curid=524632" title="Forced confession">
<text>A forced confession is a confession obtained from a suspect or a prisoner by means of torture (including enhanced interrogation techniques) or other forms of duress. Depending on the level of coercion used, a forced confession is not valid in revealing the truth. The individuals being interrogated may agree to the story presented to them or even make up falsehoods themselves in order to satisfy the interrogator and discontinue their suffering.

For centuries the Latin phrase &quot;Confessio est regina probationum&quot; (in English: &quot;Confession is the queen of evidence&quot;) justified the use of forced confession in the European legal system. During the Middle Ages, acquiring a confession prior to a trial was especially important. The methods used to acquire a confession were considered less important than the actual confession itself, thus de facto sanctioning torture and forced confessions.

By the late 18th century, most scholars and lawyers thought of the forced confession not only as a relic of past times and morally wrong but also ineffective as the victim of torture may confess to anything just to ease their suffering.

Developments in the 20th century, notably the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, greatly reduced the legal acceptance of forced confessions. However, for most of legal history they have been accepted in most of the world, and are still accepted in some jurisdictions.

==Modern-day usage==

===Bahrain===
====Mohamed Ramadan====
Bahraini authorities refused for more than two years to investigate complaints regarding the torture of Mohamed Ramadan—a father-of-three on death row who was tortured into making a false confession.

In February 2014, Ramadan was arrested from Bahrain International Airport, where he worked as a police officer. He was accused of involvement in an attack on other police officers. There is no evidence tying him to the crime, according to Reprieve, who state that Ramadan is innocent and was arrested in retaliation for his attendance at pro-democracy demonstrations.

Following his arrest, Ramadan was tortured by police into signing a false confession. During his initial detention, police officers &quot;told Mohammed outright that they knew he was innocent&quot;, but were punishing him as a traitor for attending pro-democracy demonstrations.

During his entire pre-trial detention, Ramadan was not allowed to meet with his lawyer. The day Ramadan&#x27;s trial began was the first time he saw his lawyer&#x27;s face. In that trial, he was convicted and sentenced to death almost solely on the basis of confessions extracted through prolonged torture.

====2016 Reprieve report====

In 2016, human rights organisation Reprieve published an investigative report which argued that seven Bahraini men facing the death penalty had been forced into confessing their crimes after being tortured during interrogations. The report also revealed that the Bahraini government was employing Northern Ireland Co-operation Overseas, a firm funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, to train its law enforcement personnel.

====Sami Mushaima, Ali Al-Singace, Abbas Al-Samea (2017) executed====
On 15 January 2017, Bahraini authorities executed three torture victims following authorization by King Hamad. Sami Mushaima (42), Ali Al-Singace (21) and Abbas Al-Samea (27) were executed by firing squad.

Bahrain security forces (a force that includes foreign national forces) arrested Sami Mushaima in March 2014 and held him incommunicado for at least 11 days. Security officials subjected Mushaima to beatings, electrocution, and sexual assault. His front teeth were severely damaged. Mushaima&#x27;s family believes he was coerced into falsely confessing through the use of torture.

Sami Mushaima, Ali Al-Singace, and Abbas Al-Samea are all torture victims rendered stateless and condemned to death following unfair trials. Their executions have sparked widespread protests across the country.

Maya Foa, a director of the international human rights group Reprieve, said:
The European Union also condemned the sentences: &quot;This case is a serious drawback given that Bahrain had suspended executions for ... (several) years, and concerns have been expressed about possible violations of the right to a fair process for the three convicted&quot;.

===Brazil===
====Tainá Rape (2013)====
Four men were arrested and confessed to raping and killing a girl named Tainá who was crossing in front of the theme park where they worked. Later the police found that the girl was not raped and that the four men were tortured. 13 policemen were arrested, and the police chief fled.

===China===

The People&#x27;s Republic of China systematically employed forced televised confession against Chinese dissidents and workers of various human rights groups in an attempt to discredit, smear and suppress dissident voices and activism. These scripted confessions, obtained with the person under duress and via torture, are broadcast on the state television. Notable victims includes Wang Yu, a female human rights lawyer, and Swedish citizen Peter Dahlin, an NGO worker and human rights activist. The owners of Causeway Bay BooksGui Minhai and Lam Wing-keewho were abducted by state security agents operating outside of Mainland China, also made such controversial confessions. Upon regaining his freedom, Lam detailed his abduction and detention, and recanted his confessions in Hong Kong to the media.

These televised confessions and acts of contrition have been denounced as frauds by critics. Media organisations in China and in Hong Kong, including the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, which is owned by Alibaba, have been criticised for abetting the practice by circulating the &quot;confessions&quot; and in some cases even participating in them. Safeguard Defenders released a report in April 2018 in which 45 high-profile examples of the so-called confessions were broadcast between July 2013 and February 2018. More than half of the subjects were journalists, lawyers, and other individuals involved in promoting human rights in China. The confessions were mostly imposed on the subjects outside of the formal legal framework, in the absence of a trial, and without regard for the presumption of innocence under the Chinese law. Many of those forced to record confessions later explained in detail how the videos were carefully scripted and made under the watchful eyes of the agents of the security apparatus, demonstrating their powerlessness once they are within the opaque Chinese legal system.

===Islamic Republic of Iran===
According to at least two observers (Ervand Abrahamian, Nancy Updike), the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has systematically used false confessions extracted by torture. They have been used on a much larger scale than in Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union because the confessions could be videotaped and broadcast for purposes of propaganda. During the 1980s, television &quot;recantation&quot; shows were common on Iranian state television.

Since eyewitness accounts were published documenting the use of torture in extracting confessions, the recantations and confessions have lost much (or some) of their propaganda impact. The practice of collecting confessions has continued, however, now used more to demoralize the opposition, gather information about them, and sow fear and distrust among the Iranian opposition as &quot;recanters&quot; accuse other opposition members. There were reportedly so many confessions coerced following the 2009 protest crackdown that &quot;there&#x27;s no way to film even a tiny percentage of them.&quot;

The public &quot;e&#x27;terafat&quot; in Iran are not simply confessions, but &quot;political and ideological recantation(s)&quot;. They come in a variety of forms, &quot;pretrial testimonials; in chest-beating letters; in mea culpa memoirs; press conferences, &#x27;debates&#x27;, and &#x27;roundtable discussions, but most commonly in videotaped &#x27;interviews&#x27; and &#x27;conversations&#x27; aired on prime-time television.&quot; The standard form in the time of Ayatollah Khomeini began with an introduction hailing Imam Khomeini with all of his titles (Founder of the Islamic Republic, leader of the Islamic Revolution, etc.) The recanter &quot;emphasised the interview was entirely voluntary and that the speaker had come forth willingly to warn others of the pitfalls awaiting them if they deviated from the Khatt-e Imam [line of the Imam] Then followed condemnation of the prisoner&#x27;s organisation, beliefs, comrades. Ended with thanks to the wardens [for the opportunity to] see the light. It hoped that the sincere repentance and the Imam&#x27;s compassion would pave the way for forgiveness, redemption, ... [however, if] the Imam chose not to forgive, that too would be understandable in light of the enormity of the crimes.&quot;

These recantations served as powerful propaganda not only for both the Iranian public at large but also for the recanter&#x27;s former colleagues, for whom the denunciations were demoralising and confusing. From the moment they arrived in prison, through their interrogation prisoners were asked if they were willing to give an &quot;interview&quot;. (&quot;mosahebah&quot;) &quot;Some remained incarcerated even after serving their sentences simply because they declined the honour of being interviewed.&quot;

While the constitution of the Islamic Republic explicitly outlaws &quot;shekanjeh&quot; (torture) and the use of coerced confessions, other laws are employed to allow coercion. Up to 74 lashings can be administered for &#x27;lying to the authorities&#x27;, and a defendant may be found guilty of lying by a cleric in the process of interrogating the defendant. Thus &quot;clerical interrogators can give indefinite series of 74 lashings until they obtain &#x27;honest answers.

Techniques used to extract confessions included whipping, most often on the soles of the feet; deprivation of sleep; suspension from the ceiling and high walls; twisting of forearms until they broke; crushing of hands and fingers between metal presses; insertion of sharp instruments under the fingernails; cigarette burns; submersion under water; standing in one place for hours on end; mock executions; and physical threats against family members.

According to one defendant, &quot;his interrogator kept on repeating throughout his torment &#x27;This hadd punishment will continue until you give us a videotaped interview, &quot;interview&quot; being the term used for confession sessions.

In June 2020, FIDH and its member organization Justice for Iran (JFI), in a 57-page report titled &quot;Orwellian State: The Islamic Republic of Iran’s State Media as a Weapon of Mass Suppression&quot;, reported that between 2009 and 2019, Iranian state-owned media IRIB broadcast the forced confessions of about 355 individuals and defamatory content against at least 505 individuals. The report is the outcome of more than 1,500 hours of research and analysis of over 150 programs and 13 in-depth interviews with victims of forced confessions.

===Khmer Rouge===
In the 1970s, the Khmer Rouge used torture to force confessions and false implications from approximately 17,000 persons at the former Tuol Sleng high school. All but seven were either executed or died due to the mistreatment. The leaders of the interrogation and torture system of the Khmer Rouge were Mam Nai and Tang Sin Hean.

===Soviet Union===
In the Soviet Union, a series of show trials, known as the Moscow Show Trials, were orchestrated by Joseph Stalin during the Great Purge of the late 1930s. More than 40 high-level political prisoners were sentenced either to the firing squad or to labour camps. The trials are today universally acknowledged to have used forced confessions, obtained through torture and threats against the defendants&#x27; families, to eliminate any potential political challengers to Stalin&#x27;s authority.

===Spain===
====The Crime of Cuenca (1910)====

Due to police torture, two men confessed to the murder of another man who had disappeared. Based solely on their confession, as no body had been recovered, they were convicted and sentenced to long jail terms. Years later the supposed victim reappeared in the small village, and it was proven that he had left voluntarily years before.

=== United Kingdom ===
====Birmingham Six (1974)====

The Birmingham Six were six men from Northern Ireland accused of carrying out the Birmingham pub bombings in 1974. After their arrest, four of the six confessed to the crime. These confessions were later claimed to be the result of intimidation and torture by police, including the use of dogs and mock executions. In 1991, after 17 years in prison, an appeal to their convictions was allowed. The evidence at hearing showed widespread police fabrication, suppression of evidence, and extreme irregularities in the relevant forensic evidence. All six individuals were released and awarded compensation of up to £1.2 million. As a result of this and other miscarriages of justice, a Royal Commission on Criminal Justice was established in March 1991 to create reforms and provide oversight to the process.

====Guildford Four (1974)====

As a result of the Guildford pub bombings carried out by Irish republican paramilitaries in 1974, four Irish individuals were charged and convicted of murder and terrorist activities. All had confessed to the crimes while in police custody but later retracted their statements. In their trial, they would claim that they had made false confessions, resulting from intimidation and torture by police. Seven relatives of one of the original four defendants were also convicted of terrorist activities in 1976. All of the individuals involved had their convictions quashed, by two rulings in 1989 and 1991, after having served up to 16 years in prison. These appeals investigations revealed large-scale deception and illegal activities undertaken by both the Metropolitan Police and the Crown Prosecution Service. In 2005 the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, issued a public apology for the imprisonment of these persons, describing it as an &#x27;injustice&#x27; and stating that &quot;they deserve to be completely and publicly exonerated&quot;.

===United States===

Since 2001, as part of its War on Terror the United States using the CIA operates a network of off shore prisons, called black sites, probably the most well-known of which is Guantánamo Bay detention camp. State officials have admitted to the press and in court to be using various torture techniques (authorised by the District attorney) to interrogate suspects of terrorism, sometimes after forced disappearance or extraordinary rendition by the United States.

When these systematic acts were made public by the international media, the European Union, United Nations, the international press and various human rights movements condemned their practice. The US Supreme Court did not discontinue their usage and repeatedly ruled against hearing from those that underwent forced confessions, even after they were found innocent, claiming that a trial would constitute a breach of national security.

A famous case is that of Khalid El-Masri. He appealed several times aided by different international human rights movements and lawyers, yet the US Supreme Court retained its usage of forced confession techniques, and denied a hearing of the evidence.

====&quot;Brown v. Mississippi&quot; (1936)====

The United States Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Mississippi&quot; (1936) established conclusively that confessions extracted through the use of physical brutality violate the Due Process Clause. In this case, defendants Arthur Ellington, Ed Brown and Henry Shields (three black tenant farmers) had been convicted and sentenced to death in Mississippi for the murder of Raymond Stewart (a white planter) on 30 March 1934. The convictions had been based solely on confessions obtained through violence:

The Supreme Court concluded: &quot;It would be difficult to conceive of methods more revolting to the sense of justice than those taken to procure the confessions of these petitioners, and the use of the confessions thus obtained as the basis for conviction and sentence was a clear denial of due process ... In the instant case, the trial court was fully advised by the undisputed evidence of the way in which the confessions had been procured ... The court thus denied a federal right fully established and specially set up and claimed, and the judgment must be reversed.&quot;

<doc id="524633" wikidata="Q16838253" url="?curid=524633" title="Fetus-X">
<text>Fetus-X was a weekly romantic horror comic written and drawn by Eric Millikin and Casey Sorrow. Millikin is an American artist and former human anatomy lab embalmer and dissectionist. Sorrow is an internationally known American illustrator and printmaker.

&quot;Fetus-X&quot; has been published in newspapers, books, and as a webcomic since late 1999. The first &quot;Fetus-X&quot; comics were drawn by artist Casey Sorrow, who later left to create the comic &quot;Feral Calf&quot;. The storylines of &quot;Fetus-X&quot; generally revolve around Millikin&#x27;s use of the occult in both romantic relationships and battles with various ghosts, demons, aliens, and monsters. The artwork is mixed media, combining expressionist paintings with found objects. The text is often written in free verse. Early comics are in black and white, but after 2002 most are full color.

==History==
Millikin began drawing horror comics by age one-and-a-half, when he made crayon drawings of ghosts terrorizing him during toilet-training. By second grade, he was making teachers profane birthday cards showing his school burning down.

The first &quot;Fetus-X&quot; newspaper strips were published in spring 2000 in Michigan State University&#x27;s &quot;The State News&quot;. Immediately there were problems with censorship, Catholic League protests, and threatened cancellation. 

After the Catholic League protested the comic and then MSU president M. Peter McPherson declared he wanted it banned, the comic strip was removed for being too controversial. During the controversy over the comic, many people protested on both sides of the issue.

Those who were against the comic protested on religious grounds. One said, &quot;As a born-again Christian, I just wanted to notify the writers of “Fetus-X” that the comic strip [is] very offensive. ... I pray that one day you will come to know the power of the cross.&quot; Another warned, &quot;Do you remember what happened when they said, &#x27;not even God can sink the &quot;Titanic&quot;?&#x27; There are certain things you just don’t joke about. ... keep your blasphemy to yourself.&quot;

Those in favor of the comic said that &quot;I would not hesitate to liken &#x27;Fetus-X&#x27; to the Black Sabbath of comic strips ... It is the courage, imagination and talent of both the band and the strip that will set them apart from the other flavors of the week and earn them both places in artistic history.&quot; And: &quot;It&#x27;s frustrating to see the ultimate goal of political correctness gain precedence over the basic principle that Casey Sorrow and Eric Millikin have the artistic right to their own opinions.&quot;

After six months, &quot;The State News&quot; cancelled the comic strip despite support from some readers. It continues to be published on the web and in many college newspapers and in alternative newspapers such as Detroit&#x27;s &quot;Metro Times&quot; and the &quot;University Reporter&quot;.

In the fall of 2002, &quot;Fetus-X&quot; became part of the subscription-based online alternative comics anthology Serializer, a spin-off of the successful webcomics site Modern Tales. Other comics on Serializer included &quot;Achewood Sunday Edition&quot;, &quot;The Magic Whistle&quot;, and &quot;Little Laurie Sprinkles&quot;. In the fall of 2005 &quot;Fetus-X&quot; became a free comic on Webcomics Nation.

In June 2006, Millikin was interviewed in the book &quot;,&quot; edited by award-winning syndicated editorial cartoonist Ted Rall. &quot;Attitude 3&quot; also includes other webcomics such as &quot;Cat and Girl&quot;, &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot;, &quot;Diesel Sweeties&quot;, and &quot;The Perry Bible Fellowship&quot;.

After being offline due to a server crash, Serializer relaunched in October 2006, under the editorship of Eric Millikin. &quot;Fetus-X&quot; was among the comics on the relaunched serializer, along with &quot;A Softer World&quot;, &quot;Idiot Box&quot;, and &quot;Templar, Arizona&quot;.

==Characters and plot==
Typical plots of &quot;Fetus-X&quot; comics involved the title character Fetus-X interacting with a lab rabbit named Bunny. Fetus-X was a psychic zombie fetus floating in a jar of formaldehyde who may or may not be Millikin&#x27;s missing conjoined twin or his clone from an alternate timeline or dimension.

==Critical reaction==
In their review of serializer.net, &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a pleasure to see strips like ... &quot;Fetus-X&quot; use the newspaper format for far more daring, entertainingly perverse work ... [&quot;Fetus-X&quot;] would be perfectly at home at a good alternative weekly or a great college paper.&quot; In their review of &quot;Attitude 3&quot;, the American Library Association&#x27;s Booklist wrote that &quot;the visual style of Eric Millikin’s &quot;Fetus-X&quot; &#x27;crosses Edvard Munch with an incipient victim of high-school suicide.&#x27;&quot; 

Since 2000, &quot;Fetus-X&quot; has been the target of protest campaigns organized by the Catholic League for its &quot;blasphemous treatment of Jesus&quot;. &quot;This particular comic is offensive to Catholics and Christians,&quot; Catholic League spokesman Patrick Scully said in August 2002. &quot;It completely ridicules the Catholic faith and is not funny.&quot; The &quot;Hartford Advocate&quot; has called Millikin a &quot;borderline sociopath.&quot;

&quot;Fetus-X&quot; was named one of the best webcomics of 2004 by &quot;The Webcomics Examiner&quot;, who called it &quot;one of the sharpest political commentaries available. In an era where presidents are treated as messiahs, and questioning the fatherland’s foreign policies is socially unacceptable, Eric shows how necessary it is to yell at the top of your lungs about the madness of it all.&quot;

In 2006, &quot;Fetus-X&quot; was nominated for multiple Web Cartoonist&#x27;s Choice Awards including Outstanding Comic, Outstanding Single Panel Comic, and Outstanding Romantic Comic. It (referred to as &quot;Foetus-X&quot;) was later disqualified for not meeting the Award&#x27;s defined genre criteria for romance comics. In 2007, &quot;Fetus-X&quot; was again nominated for multiple Web Cartoonist&#x27;s Choice Awards including Outstanding Romantic Comic. It was not disqualified from the romance category in 2007.

&quot;Fetus-X&quot; was used along with &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;, &quot;American Elf&quot; and &quot;Questionable Content&quot; as an example of comics using the web to create &quot;an explosion of diverse genres and styles&quot; in Scott McCloud&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;Making Comics&quot;.

==Side projects==
Eric Millikin has won awards for his illustrations for major newspapers such as &quot;The Detroit News&quot;. Casey Sorrow&#x27;s illustrations have appeared in publications like &quot;The New York Times.&quot; &quot;Feral Calf&quot; is a comic by former &quot;Fetus-X&quot; artist Casey Sorrow. It is about feral fish people doing strange things to each other and is also hosted on Webcomics Nation. Eric Millikin and Casey Sorrow also created the holiday Monkey Day (celebrated December 14) as an opportunity to educate the public about monkeys, as a holiday that supports evolution rather than religious themes, and an excuse to throw monkey-themed costume parties.

<doc id="524636" wikidata="Q3364044" url="?curid=524636" title="Richard Hatch (Survivor contestant)">
<text>Richard Holman Hatch Jr. (born April 8, 1961) is an American reality television contestant. In 2000, he became the first &quot;Survivor&quot; winner (&quot;Borneo&quot;) in its , originally broadcast on CBS. He subsequently competed in &quot;&quot; season of &quot;Survivor&quot;, the fourth celebrity edition of &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, season 17 of &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;, and season 2 of &quot;House of Villains&quot;. He was convicted with three counts related to attempted tax evasion and fraudulent tax return in January 2006. He served fifty-one months in prison and then, after failing to amend his 2000 and 2001 tax returns, an additional nine months in prison.

==Early life and education==
Hatch&#x27;s parents divorced when he was eleven years old. Also, at the time of &quot;Borneo&quot;, his mother was a registered nurse, and his father was a retired lab technician. Hatch is the oldest of four siblings.

Hatch graduated from Middletown High School (Rhode Island) in 1979. He studied oceanography and marine biology at the Florida Institute of Technology. He joined the United States Army in 1980 and became a West Point cadet within the next five years in the Army. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in Management and Applied Behavioral Sciences from the National Louis University. He pursued a master&#x27;s degree by studying education and counseling at Rhode Island&#x27;s Providence College.

After the Army, in 1985, Hatch moved to Manhattan and married an unidentified Australian woman. They were estranged throughout most of their marriage that lasted for at least ten years.

Hatch&#x27;s hometown is Newport, Rhode Island, where he resided at the time. He adopted a seven-year-old boy Christopher in 1998.

==&quot;Survivor&quot;==
===&quot;Borneo&quot;===

Hatch was a corporate trainer and consultant for his own business, Tri-Whale Training, when he first competed on &quot;Survivor&quot;. In &quot;&quot; (2000), he came out as gay onscreen, notoriously went nude on his birthday, and used resources to catch edible sea creatures underwater. Moreover, he defended, formed, and led an alliance with his remaining Tagi tribe members who seemed unable to win individually. Strategically, after the two tribes were merged into one, to ensure the all-Tagi competition, the Tagi alliance voted out every remaining member of the original Pagong tribe.

As four players remained in the season finale, Hatch, Rudy Boesch, and Sue Hawk plotted to vote Kelly Wiglesworth out, but the plan was no longer feasible when Wiglesworth won an Individual Immunity challenge called &quot;Fallen Comrades&quot;, a trivia quiz mini-game about eliminated contestants. At a Tribal Council, Hatch and Hawk received two votes each. In a tiebreaker, Hatch and Hawk were disallowed to vote; Boesch and Wiglesworth voted Hawk out and kept Hatch for the time being.

As one of three remaining players, Hatch strategically dropped out of the season&#x27;s final Immunity challenge, leaving Boesch and Wiglesworth to compete against each other. Wiglesworth beat Boesch in the challenge, (as the only player eligible to vote) voted Boesch out, and kept Hatch, hoping to beat him in the finals. Fourth-placed Sue Hawk infamously called Kelly a &quot;rat&quot; and Richard a &quot;snake&quot; in the final Council. Hawk further said that, in Mother Nature, snake would eat a rat.

Against the runner-up Wiglesworth, Hatch earned the &quot;Sole Survivor&quot; title and won $1 million and a Pontiac Aztek SUV by a 4–3 jury vote of the final Tribal Council. Hatch received votes from 3 of his original Tagi tribemates (Rudy, Susan, and Sean) and a vote from Greg. The other three jury members of the Pagong tribe origins voted for Kelly. Hatch&#x27;s victory was controversial at the time since Greg&#x27;s decisive vote seemed to be cast due to the result of a &quot;pick-a-number&quot; question, but Greg has stated that he had always intended to vote for Richard and his question was his way to poke fun at the serious nature of the Final Tribal Council.

===&quot;All-Stars&quot;===

Hatch re-competed in &quot;&quot; (2004) as part of the Mogo Mogo tribe. As before, he caught edible sea creatures with available resources. Mogo Mogo became weary about his antics, attitude, and constant nudity. Thus, he became the fourth person of the season and the first member of the tribe voted out, placing fourteenth.

Before his elimination, Hatch was involved in an incident with another former &quot;Borneo&quot; player Sue Hawk, who reappeared in the same season as part of the Chapera tribe. Hawk later claimed that, during one of tribal immunity challenges, which was a balance beam mini-game, Hatch&#x27;s genitals touched her as he passed her by on the course. The next day, Hawk resigned from the game voluntarily as she was too upset to continue. Hatch and Hawk discussed the incident in the February 27, 2004, episode of &quot;The Early Show&quot;, the following day after the &quot;Survivor&quot; episode aired the incident.

==Other appearances==
In post-&quot;Borneo&quot; era, Hatch made guest appearances as himself on &quot;One Wong Move&quot; (2000) from &quot;Becker&quot; and, alongside Sue Hawk, &quot;Penetration Island&quot; (2002) from &quot;Son of the Beach&quot;. In &quot;Becker&quot;, Hatch visits the titular character&#x27;s office for his severe stomachache and makes references to his &quot;Survivor&quot; gameplay, like eating bizarre things.

Hatch also wrote his 2000 book &quot;101 Survival Secrets: How to Make $1 Million, Lose 100 pounds and Live Happily Ever After&quot;. According to a November 2000 interview, he lost more than 100 pounds within the past two years up to &quot;Borneo&quot; and then, after the filming was completed, having his excess inelastic tissue removed from his abdomen via resection surgery on May 9, 2000.

Hatch appeared alongside three other &quot;Survivor&quot; players—Hawk, Jenna Lewis and Gervase Peterson—in &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; on the week of September 25, 2000.

In the Australian version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; in October 2000, Hatch incorrectly answered the fourth question &quot;What is 11 × 12?&quot;, resulting in his elimination without winning money. He also competed against other five &quot;Borneo&quot; players in the May 10, 2001, episode of &quot;Weakest Link&quot;. Despite correctly answering most questions, he was unanimously voted out as the &quot;weakest link&quot; in the first round.

Hatch also competed in the July 15, 2002, episode (all-reality edition) of a game show &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;. He became part of a &quot;dog pound&quot; team after losing a challenge. The team lost the $25,000 prize to &quot;Borneo&quot; player Sue Hawk.

In post-&quot;All-Stars&quot; era, Hatch also competed in the &quot;Survivor&quot; edition of &quot;Family Feud&quot;, aired on the week of February 14, 2005, alongside other &quot;Survivor&quot; players, including Rudy Boesch and Sue Hawk, who were divided into male and female teams. He also competed on &quot;Battle of the Network Reality Stars&quot; in 2005 as part of the &quot;dark blue&quot; team, which lost the $10,000 prize () to the &quot;light blue&quot; team in the finals. He also was &quot;fired&quot; in the April 3, 2011, episode of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice 4&quot;. He also was eliminated in the January 18, 2016 episode of the 17th season of &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; for not losing enough weight.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; placed him thirty-first in its 2013 list of &quot;The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time&quot; for his &quot;Survivor&quot; gameplay.

==Acquittals and convictions==
Hatch was convicted in a county district court in September 2001 with domestic assault charge one month after his former partner Glenn Boyanowski accused him of assault. Hatch said that the assault started when Boyanowski trespassed his Middletown house. Hatch was sentenced to one-year probation on September 24, 2001, and was ordered not to contact Boyanowski. He appealed his conviction and sentence, both of which were overturned in a county superior court on February 5, 2002, after two days of court hearings.

In September 2005, Hatch was indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of tax evasion, one count of filing a false tax return, two counts of wire fraud, four counts of mail fraud, and one count of bank fraud.
 The following January, he was acquitted of fraud but convicted of the three tax charges. The charges stemmed from his failure to report approximately $1.4 million in income: $1.04 million from &quot;Survivor,&quot; $321,000 in payments for radio appearances, $28,000 of rental income, and $36,000 in charitable donations misappropriated for personal use. Tax returns were prepared by two accountants that reflected his &quot;Survivor&quot; winnings that Hatch did not file. Instead, he filed a pro forma return that excluded that income.

His 51-month prison sentence reflected an enhancement for obstruction of justice.

In 2010, one year after Hatch&#x27;s release in 2009, &quot;Survivor&quot; host/producer Jeff Probst and producer Mark Burnett revealed that Hatch was a strong candidate to reappear for the twentieth season, &quot;&quot;, as a villain. However, Hatch was still under house arrest at the time and unable to re-participate because prosecutors denied him permission to do so. Hatch served an additional nine months in prison from March to December 2011 for not amending his 2000 and 2001 tax returns. The additional sentence prevented him from appearing in the live finale of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice 4&quot;. Since then, his release had been under supervision again, making him unable to leave the country, for 26 remaining months.

==Personal life==
After the &quot;All-Stars&quot; filming, Hatch dated an Argentine tourist director Emiliano Cabral, whose age was twenty-eight in early 2004. They legally married in Nova Scotia in 2005. They divorced in a Rhode Island family court in 2022 after at least fourteen years of their relationship.

According to &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, while he attended George Mason University (Virginia), Hatch donated his sperm to a sperm bank in Fairfax, Virginia, hundreds of times total for two years, twice or thrice per week average, to earn $30 per donation. Accordingly, two different women who were donated Hatch&#x27;s sperm eventually gave birth to, respectively, one daughter and one son. He met his two biological children, both age twenty-two at the time, for the first time in 2011.

A property purchased by Hatch in Sydney, Nova Scotia, following his &quot;Survivor&quot; win was included in a tax sale during a public auction in 2013. As the Cape Breton Regional Municipality tax office indicated, Hatch had not paid property taxes on the property for a period of more than six years.

<doc id="524638" wikidata="Q174684" url="?curid=524638" title="Tuzla">
<text>Tuzla (, ), , ) is the third-largest city of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the administrative center of Tuzla Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of 2013, it has a population of 110,979 inhabitants.

Tuzla is the economic, cultural, educational, health and tourist centre of northeast Bosnia. It is an educational center and is home to two universities. It is also the main industrial machine and one of the leading economic strongholds of the country with a wide and varied industrial sector including an expanding service sector thanks to its salt lake tourism.

The city of Tuzla is home to Europe&#x27;s only salt lake as part of its central park and has more than 350,000 people visiting its shores every year. The history of the city goes back to the 9th century; modern Tuzla dates back to 1510 when it became an important garrison town in the Ottoman Empire.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Tuzla is also regarded as one of the most multicultural cities in the country and has managed to keep the pluralist character of the city throughout the Bosnian War and after, with Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats and a small minority of Bosnian Jews residing in Tuzla.

==Etymology==
The name Tuzla is the Ottoman Turkish word for salt mine, &quot;tuzla&quot;, and refers to the extensive salt deposits found underneath the city, mined for export as a large source of Ottoman tax revenue. Leveraging on their shared name, the city is twinned with Tuzla, a suburb of Istanbul, Turkey.

==History==
===Early history===
Archaeological evidence suggests that Tuzla was a rich Neolithic settlement. Being inhabited continuously for more than 6,000 years, Tuzla is one of the oldest European sustained settlements. During the period of the Roman Republic (before the area was conquered by Rome), Tuzla (or Salines as it was called at the time) was ruled by the Illyrian tribe Breuci.

===Middle Ages to 20th century===
The city was first mentioned in 950 by Constantine Porphyrogenitus in his De Administrando Imperio as a fort named &quot;Salines&quot; (). The name &quot;Soli&quot; was used in the Middle Ages. It means &quot;salts&quot; in Bosnian and the city&#x27;s present name means &quot;place of salt&quot; in Ottoman Turkish. During the Middle Ages it belonged mostly to the medieval Kingdom of Bosnia.

After the fall of the kingdom to the Ottoman Empire in 1463, the region was controlled by the House of Berislavić before the Ottomans occupied the villages of &quot;Gornje Soli&quot; and &quot;Donje Soli&quot; around 1512, and took control of the entire Usora in the 1530s.

It remained under Ottoman rule for nearly 400 years, where it was administered as part of the Sanjak of Zvornik. In 1878 it was occupied by Austria-Hungary. After the dissolution of the monarchy it became the part of the newly formed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Husino uprising took place in 1920.

During the Second World War, Tuzla was included in the puppet Independent State of Croatia and controlled by the mainly Muslim Hadžiefendić Legion of the Croatian Home Guard.
Tuzla was among the first areas in Europe to be liberated, when Tito&#x27;s Yugoslav Partisans freed it from the German occupiers on 2 October 1943. Many members of the Legion deserted to the Partisans at this time.
In December 1944, the city was unsuccessfully attacked by Chetnik forces of Draža Mihailović along with the Serbian State Guard.

After the war it developed into a major industrial and cultural centre during the Communist period in the former Yugoslavia.

===Bosnian War===

In the 1990 elections the Reformists won control of the municipality being the only municipality in Bosnia where non-nationalists won. During the Bosnian War of Independence between 1992 and 1995 the town was the only municipality not governed by the SDA party-led authorities. After Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence and was recognized by the United Nations the city was besieged by Serbian forces. A few days later Serbian forces attacked Tuzla. The town was not spared the atrocities of the Bosnian War.

On 15 May 1992, troops of the 92nd Motorised Brigade of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army were ambushed by units of Bosnia&#x27;s Territorial Defence Force, while attempting to withdraw from the city. During the incident, 54 Yugoslav troops were killed and 44 were wounded. In 2009, Ilija Jurišić, a former Bosnian Croat officer, was sentenced to 12 years by a Serbian court for the attack before an appeals court acquitted him in 2015 citing a lack of evidence. 

On 25 May 1995, an attack on Tuzla killed 71 people and injured 200 persons in what is referred to as the Tuzla massacre, when shells fired from Serb&#x27;s positions on the Ozren mountain (130 mm towed field gun M-46) hit the central street and its promenade. The youngest civilian who died in that massacre was only two years old.

Following the Dayton Peace Accords, Tuzla was the headquarters of the U.S. forces for the Multinational Division (MND) during Operation Joint Endeavour IFOR and subsequent SFOR.

===Post-war independence===
In February 2014, the city was the scene of the beginning of the 2014 unrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which quickly spread to dozens of cities and towns throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. After a couple of days of calm protests, people lost patience and started burning cars in front of the canton government building, and later the building itself.

Recent years have seen economic growth as well as increases in tourism.

==Geography==
Tuzla is located in the northeastern part of Bosnia, settled just underneath the Majevica mountain range, on the Jala River. The central zone lies in an east–west oriented plain, with residential areas in the north and south of the city located on the Ilinčica, Kicelj and Gradina Hills. It is above sea level. The climate is moderate continental. There are abundant coal deposits in the region around Tuzla. 6 coal mines continue to operate around the city. Much of the coal mined in the area is used to power the Tuzla Thermal Power Plant, which is the largest power plant in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===Salt deposits===
Extractions of the city&#x27;s salt deposits, particularly in the 20th century, have caused sections of the city center to sink. Structures in the &quot;sinking area&quot; either collapsed or were demolished, and there are few structures in the city that predate the 20th century, despite the fact that the city was founded over 1000 years ago. In the northeastern part of the town is an area known as Solina, named after the salt deposits.

===Pannonian Lakes===

Tuzla is the only city in Europe that has a salt lake in its centre. The ancient Pannonian Sea dried up around 10 million years ago, but work by researchers and scientists has now enabled a level of saline water to be kept stable at the surface, and in 2003 the Pannonian Lake was opened.

A second lake that includes artificial waterfalls was inaugurated in 2008. An archaeological park and replica Neolithic lake dwellings were also incorporated into the scheme, providing information about the different cultures which left their material and spiritual mark here. The site has become an international tourist destination.

A third lake was completed in August 2012. Construction expenses for this were nearly 2 million Bosnian marks (ca. 1 million euros). This third lake also contains 2 water slides which are an attraction for the younger population.

The summer season of 2013 recorded approximately 5,000 visitors per day (c. 450,000 for 3 months).

<text>Auxerre ( , , Burgundian: &quot;Auchoirre&quot;) is the capital (prefecture) of the Yonne department and the fourth-largest city in the Burgundy historical region southeast of Paris. Auxerre&#x27;s population today is about 35,000; the urban area (&quot;aire d&#x27;attraction&quot;) comprises roughly 111,000 inhabitants. Residents of Auxerre are referred to as &quot;Auxerrois&quot;.

Auxerre is a commercial and industrial centre, with industries including food production, woodworking and batteries. Nearby areas are also noted for the production of Burgundy wine, including Chablis. In 1995 Auxerre was named a &quot;Town of Art and History&quot;.

==Geography==
Auxerre lies on the river Yonne and the Canal du Nivernais, about 150 km southeast of Paris and 120 km northwest of Dijon. The A6 autoroute (Paris–Lyon) passes northeast of the city. Auxerre-Saint-Gervais station has rail connections to Dijon, Paris, Corbigny and Avallon.

==History==
Auxerre was a flourishing Gallo-Roman centre, then called Autissiodorum, through which passed one of the main roads of the area, the Via Agrippa (1st century AD) which crossed the Yonne (Gallo-Roman Icauna) here. In the third century it became the seat of a bishop and a provincial capital of the Roman Empire. In the 5th century it received a cathedral. In the late 11th-early 12th century the existing communities were included inside a new line of walls built by the feudal counts of Auxerre.

Bourgeois activities accompanied the traditional land and wine cultivations starting from the twelfth century, and Auxerre developed into a commune with a Town Hall of its own. The Burgundian city, which became part of France under King Louis XI, suffered during the Hundred Years&#x27; War and the Wars of Religion. In 1567 it was captured by the Huguenots, and many of the Catholic edifices were damaged. The medieval ramparts were demolished in the 18th century.

In the 19th century numerous heavy infrastructures were built, including a railway station, a psychiatric hospital and the courts, and new quarters were developed on the right bank of the Yonne.

Until the early 20th century, Auxerre was one of the most prosperous cities in the department. But the local authorities of that period refused the railway that was subsequently set in the village of Migennes, and signed the economic decline of the town. 

== Archaeology ==
In June 2024, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research announced the discovery of a large Roman cemetery in Place du Maréchal Leclerc, Auxerre, France. The cemetery contains more than 250 burials of infants and stillborn babies. Some remains were buried in ceramic vessels and wooden coffins, while others were wrapped in textiles.

<text>Senior Chief Petty Officer &quot;(SCPO)&quot; is an enlisted rank in the navies of some countries.

US Navy Senior chiefpetty officerinsignia
Senior chief petty officer is the eighth of nine enlisted rates in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, just above chief petty officer and below master chief petty officer, and is a noncommissioned officer. They are addressed as &quot;Senior Chief&quot; in most circumstances, or sometimes, less formally, as &quot;Senior&quot;. The rate was established on 1 June 1958 (along with the rate master chief petty officer). 

Advancement to senior chief petty officer is similar to that of chief petty officer. It carries requirements of time in service, superior evaluation scores, and peer review. In the Navy, it is the first promotion that is based entirely on proven leadership performance; test scores do not play a part. After three years in the current grade, a chief petty officer can only advance to senior chief if a board of master chiefs approve, convened every year around March. Senior chief petty officers make up just 2.5% of the total enlisted force of the Navy and overall fall within the top 4% of the enlisted ranks.

In the Coast Guard, advancement to senior chief is similar to other advancements, in that candidates compete with other advancement-eligible chief petty officers. Advancement-eligible chief petty officers are prioritized based on written examination scores, evaluations, award points, time in service, and time in grade. Senior chief petty officers are then selected monthly from this prioritization list as positions become available.

As do chief petty officers, senior chief petty officers take on more advanced leadership duties in their new paygrade. In the Navy, their khaki uniform continues to reflect their responsibility level: It is similar to an officer&#x27;s uniform, but with different insignia. (In the Coast Guard, petty officers, chief petty officers, warrant officers, and commissioned officers all wear similar uniforms.)

Like petty officers, every chief has both a rate (rank) and rating (job, similar to an MOS in other branches). A chief&#x27;s full title is a combination of the two. Thus, a senior chief petty officer with the rating of machinist&#x27;s mate would properly be called a senior chief machinist&#x27;s mate, the abbreviation of which is &quot;MMCS&quot;.

Each rating has an official abbreviation, such as MM for machinist&#x27;s mate, QM for quartermaster, and YN for yeoman. The rating and the rate combined give the abbreviation of a senior chief&#x27;s full title, such as BMCS for senior chief boatswain&#x27;s mate. In the expanded form, the title of senior chief always precedes the rating. It is not uncommon practice to refer to a senior chief petty officer by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence (such as printing and inscription on awards).

The rating insignia for a senior chief is an eagle with spread wings above three chevrons. The chevrons are topped by a rocker that goes behind the eagle (or &quot;crow&quot;, as it is commonly called). An inverted star (similar to the stars on the sleeves of line officers) is above the eagle. This is used on the dress blue uniform. On all other uniforms, the insignia used is the one that has become universally accepted as the symbol of the chief petty officer: a fouled (entwined in the anchor chain) gold anchor superimposed with a silver &quot;USN&quot; in the Navy or a silver shield in the Coast Guard. As in the dress blue insignia, the anchor is capped by an down-pointing star.

In the Navy, officers and chiefs are referred to as &quot;khakis&quot;. This is a reference to the color of one of their most common uniforms and is a direct contrast to those in paygrades E-6 and below (&quot;blueshirts&quot;).

===Command senior chief petty officer===

As of 2005 and after a pilot program taking place on three mine countermeasures ships, the Navy started appointing senior chiefs to command roles. Until this time, senior chiefs had a senior enlisted leadership role in the submarine force as chiefs of the boat. This new effort works to formalize leadership at the senior chief level. In July 2015, the rate was formally established as a rating. Before it had been a billet instead of a rating.

The USCG also has the grade of Command Senior Chief Petty Officer (Silver Badge).

==Ireland==

===Irish Naval Service===
Senior chief petty officer (Irish: &quot;Ard-Mhion-Oifigeach Sinsearach&quot;) is a rank in the Irish Naval Service. The rank is deemed equivalent to a member of the NATO armed forces ranked E-8, making it the equivalent of a senior chief petty officer in the US Navy or a warrant officer class 2 in the Royal Navy. The rank is one grade below an Irish warrant officer.

The SCPO rank being the equivalent to Battalion or Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant causes some confusion when operating together with the Irish Army and Air Corps. The Quartermaster or logistical function is primary role of all BQMS/RQMS (OR-8) in the Irish Army and Air Corps. This is not so with the Irish Naval Service, many of their SCPOs (OR-8) have a purely line role. Line being the term used by the Irish Defence Forces to describe the default military role or non logistical role of the NCO.

All SCPOs have a specialist role such as Seaman, Engine Room Artificer, or Logistical Operator. There are only a very few Senior Chiefs, and they occupy roles of great importance within their respective branches. They are key members of the senior enlisted leadership, and are most often working directly for an Officer Commanding a large sub-unit as an advisor to Officer Commanding and as a senior personnel manager.

<text>Jón Thoroddsen (18 February 1898 – 1 January 1925) was an Icelandic poet and playwright.

== Early life ==
Jón was born in Ísafjörður in the West Fjords region of Iceland. One of thirteen children, his parents were sýslumaður Skúli Thoroddsen and poet Theodóra Guðmundsdóttir Thoroddsen. Jón graduated from Reykjavík Junior College in 1918, studied at the University of Copenhagen in 1919, and completed the law exam at the University of Iceland in 1924.

== Career ==
In 1922, Jón published &quot;Flugur&quot;, a collection of short texts that scholars have since identified as the first collection of prose poetry in the Icelandic language. Prior to the publication of &quot;Flugur&quot;, prose poetry was rare in Icelandic literature. Thus, Jón&#x27;s work was an important contribution to Icelandic modernism. The same year, he also published the three-act play &quot;María Magdalena&quot; and he published a number of other pieces in the Icelandic periodicals &quot;Eimreiðin&quot;, &quot;Iðunn&quot;, and &quot;Skírnir&quot;.

Outside of his literary activities, Jón was an active member of Iceland&#x27;s Social Democratic Party. He was the party&#x27;s candidate in the Norður-Ísafjarðarsýsla district in the 1923 parliamentary election but lost, receiving 30.67% of the vote.

== Death and legacy ==
Jón was hit by a tram in Copenhagen on 24 December 1924. He died a week later at the age of 26 on 1 January 1925. In 1933, Tómas Guðmundsson composed the elegy &quot;Jón Thoroddsen. Cand. jur. In Memoriam,&quot; which is thought to be one of Iceland&#x27;s greatest elegies.

&quot;Flugur&quot; was republished in 1986 and again in 2002 by Icelandic publisher JPV. The collection was also translated into English and published alongside the work of his mother Theodóra in 2020.

<doc id="524651" wikidata="Q2707196" url="?curid=524651" title="Latin American cuisine">
<text>Latin American cuisine is the typical foods, beverages, and cooking styles common to many of the countries and cultures in Latin America. Latin America is a highly racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse with varying cuisines. Some items typical of Latin American cuisine include maize-based dishes arepas, empanadas, pupusas, tacos, tamales, tortillas and various salsas and other condiments (guacamole, pico de gallo, mole, chimichurri, chili, aji, pebre). Sofrito, a culinary term that originally referred to a specific combination of sautéed or braised aromatics, exists in Latin American cuisine. It refers to a sauce of tomatoes, roasted bell peppers, garlic, onions and herbs. Rice, corn, pasta, bread, plantain, potato, yucca, and beans are also staples in Latin American cuisine.

Latin American beverages are just as distinct as their foods. Some of the beverages predate colonization. Some popular beverages include coffee, mate, guayusa, hibiscus tea, horchata, chicha, atole, cacao and aguas frescas.

Latin American desserts are as rich and diverse as the region’s culinary heritage. They often feature tropical fruits, creamy textures, and the sweetness of ingredients like sugar, condensed milk, and caramel. Many desserts reflect a blend of Indigenous, European, and African influences. They include dulce de leche, alfajor, rice pudding, tres leches cake, teja, beijinho, flan, and churros.

==Traditional eating customs==
There are many different kinds of traditions associated with eating in Latin America. There are a variety of special days where certain foods are consumed, as well as many holidays that are celebrated in Latin America.

===Traditions===
There are many forms of gratitude that inhabitants of Latin America employ when they discard excess food. Some people kiss the bread while others cut it before discarding it.
Other such traditions are upheld largely by the country, Argentina and Uruguay have one such tradition known as a &quot;:es:Ñoquis del 29&quot; or &quot;the Gnocchi 29&quot;, where on the 29th of each month a family eats gnocchi, sometimes placing money under their plate to wish for abundance in the next month.

There is a holiday celebrated in Latin America known as Three Kings Day (otherwise known as Epiphany) which is celebrated on January 6 of each year where families feast in honor of God&#x27;s manifestation in human form in Jesus.

In many countries of Latin America families consume lentils on the first day of the New Year because they are thought to bring prosperity.

==Cultural influences==
===Amerindian influence===
Information about Amerindian cuisine comes from a great variety of sources. Modern-day Native peoples retain a rich body of traditional foods, some of which have become iconic of present-day Native social gatherings (for example, frybread). Foods like cornbread are known to have been adopted into the cuisine of the United States from Native American groups. In other cases, documents from the early periods of contact with European, African, and Asian peoples allow the recovery of food practices which passed out of popularity in the historic period (for example, black drink). Archaeological techniques, particularly in the subdisciplines of zooarchaeology and paleoethnobotany, have allowed for the understanding of other culinary practices or preferred foods which did not survive into the written historic record. The main crops Indigenous Amerindians used in Mexico and Central America were corn and beans, which are used in contemporary dishes such as pupusas, tamales, pozole, chuchitos, and corn tortillas. The main Indigenous Amerindian crops used by Natives of South America were potatoes, corn and chuño, used mainly in modern-day Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, Chilean, Bolivian and Paraguayan dishes such as arepas, papa a la huancaína, humitas, chipa guasu, locro and many more.

===European influence===
Europeans brought their culinary traditions, but quickly adapted several of the fruits and vegetables native to the Americas into their own cuisines. Europe itself has been influenced by other cultures, such as with the al-andalus in Spain, and thus their food was already a mix of their world. The European influence for many Latin American cuisine mainly comes from Spain, Portugal, Italy, and to a lesser extent France, although some influences from cuisines as diverse as British, German and Eastern European are also evident in some countries&#x27; cuisines such as Argentina and Uruguay, which have Italian cuisine as a main influence, with great Spanish, British, German, Russian, French, Jewish, Armenian and Eastern European influence as well.

===African influence===
Africans brought and preserved many of their traditions and cooking techniques. They were often given less desired cuts of meat, including shoulder and intestines. Menudo, Mondongo, Chunchullo for example, was derived from the habit of the Spaniards of giving the slaves cow&#x27;s intestines. Enslaved Africans developed a way to clean the offal and season it to taste. African slaves in the southern United States did the same thing with pig&#x27;s intestines, creating the dish known today as chitterlings. In South America, the scraps of food the landlords did not eat were combined to create new dishes that nowadays have been adopted into the cuisines of their respective nations (such as Peruvian tacu-tacu) and (Ecuadorian guatita).

===Asian influence===

A wave of immigrants from Asia, such as China and Japan, also influenced the cuisine of Peru, Brazil, Panama, and Ecuador. The Chinese brought with them their own spices and food-styles, something that the people of Latin America accepted into their tables. Not only that, but several Asian restaurants also adapted many Latin American food-styles into their own. This case can clearly be seen in the Peruvian and Ecuadorian chifa. 

===Middle Eastern influence===

Migration from the Levant (Lebanon, Syria and Palestine) to countries like Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Argentina has made some foods like kibbeh a common staple.

==Caribbean==
Caribbean cuisine is a fusion of Amerindian, European and African cuisine. These traditions were brought from the many homelands of this region&#x27;s population. In addition, the population has created from this vast wealth of tradition many styles that are unique to the region.

Seafood is one of the most common cuisine types in the islands, though this is certainly due in part to their location. Each island will likely have its own specialty. Some prepare lobster, while others prefer certain types of fish. For example, the island of Barbados is known for its &quot;flying fish.&quot;

Another Caribbean mainstay is rice, but the rice on each island may be a little different. Some season their rice, or add peas and other ingredients such as coconut. Sometimes the yellow rice is served on the side, but it is often part of a dish. 

===Cuba===

Cuban cuisine is a distinctive fusion of Spanish, Indigenous, African and Caribbean cuisines. Cuban recipes share their basic spice palette (cumin, oregano, and bay leaves) and preparation techniques with Spanish and African cooking. The black Caribbean rice influence is in the use of local foods such as tropical fruits, root vegetables, fish, etc. A small but noteworthy Chinese influence is the daily use of steamed white rice as the main carbohydrate in a traditional Cuban meal. Rice is essential to a Cuban meal. It is usually eaten during lunch and dinner almost every day.

Unlike nearby Mexico and Central America, which have tortillas in their cuisines, the only resemblance to the use of tortillas is with &quot;casave&quot;, dating from pre-Columbian indigenous times which is called Casave. This flatbread is produced by grinding &quot;yuca&quot; (cassava) root to form a paste which, when mixed with water, becomes a dough. This is lightly cooked as a flat circular disk and air-dried to preserve it for consumption for a later time. It is traditionally reconstituted in salt water and eaten with roasted pork. The other culinary curiosity is a regional dish consisting of a roasted rodent uniquely found in Cuba, &quot;jutia&quot; (Desmarest&#x27;s hutia).

===Dominican Republic===
The cuisine of the Dominican Republic, much like its neighbors, is a fusion of Indigenous (Taino), Spanish, and African cuisines. All or nearly all food groups are accommodated in typical Dominican cuisine, as it incorporates meat or seafood; grains, especially rice, corn, and wheat; vegetables, such as beans and other legumes, potatoes, yuca, or plantains, and salad; dairy products, especially milk and cheese; and fruits, such as oranges, bananas, and mangos. However, there is heaviest consumption of starches and meats, and least of dairy products and non-starchy vegetables. Differences between Dominican cuisine and those of other parts of the West Indies include the milder spicing, which mainly uses onions, garlic, cilantro, cilantro ancho (culantro), ají cubanela (cubanelle pepper), and oregano.

Sofrito, locally known as &quot;sazón&quot;, a sautéed mix including local herbs and spices, is used in many dishes. Throughout the south-central coast bulgur, or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in quipes and tipili, two dishes brought by Levantine Middle Eastern immigrants. Other favorite foods and dishes include chicharrón, yautía, pastelitos or empanadas, batata (sweet potato), pasteles en hoja (ground roots pockets), chimichurris, plátanos maduros (ripe plantain), yuca con mojo (boiled yuca/cassava) and tostones/fritos (fried plantains

Cuisine also varies due to geographical areas. In general, most Dominican meat dishes tend to involve pork, as pigs are farmed quite heavily on the island. Meat dishes tend to be very well cooked or even stewed in Dominican restaurants, a tradition stemming from the lesser availability of refrigeration on the island. Seaside Dominican fishing villages will have great varieties of seafood, the most common being shrimp, marlin, mahi-mahi or dorado, and lobster. Most villagers more commonly dine on cheap, lesser-quality fish, usually stewed with la criolla, a type of rice. Premium seafood tends to be too expensive for the many locals, and is saved for the island&#x27;s upper class and the tourist resorts.
===Puerto Rico===

Puerto Rican cuisine has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of the Amerindian Taínos, Europe (Spain), and Africa.

In 1493, Spanish colonizers began a period of great change on the islands. The Spanish introduced foods from around the world including Europe, Asia, and Africa. They realized that not all the food they introduced to this new location were viable. So, while they had to abandon some of what was fundamental to their home country, they began to discover the local assets such as pigs and cattle. Still, some of what the Spaniards brought to Puerto Rico became of great importance to modern traditional dishes such as plantains, bananas, and coffee; all of which are now prominent in current Puerto Rican food culture.

In the latter part of the 19th century, the cuisine of Puerto Rico was greatly influenced by the United States in the ingredients used in its preparation. Puerto Rican cuisine has transcended the boundaries of the island and can be found in several countries outside the archipelago . Many crops cultivated in Puerto Rico stem from New World origins like plantains.

==Central America==
Central American cuisine is a fusion of Indigenous, Spanish and African influence. Most of the countries are within the Mesoamerica cultural and historic region. Some of its staple foods, such as maize, bell peppers, squash, beans, and tomatoes originated and are native to the region and over time have become basic staples in other international cuisines around the world.

Its cuisine varies with its geographical areas, as well as its demographics. In the Pacific coasts of the countries in Central America, the influence of its food is more of an Indigenous and European infusion. In the Caribbean coast the fusion is more of an Indigenous and African fusion. The exception being El Salvador and Belize, where they are the other two countries that do not border both the Pacific and Caribbean. However, their cuisines still possess a fusion of all three cuisines because of their own diverse history, and their neighboring countries&#x27; demographics.

Another staple in both Pacific and Caribbean cuisine of the area is rice. It is accompanied by a meat (pork, beef, and chicken), or seafood. Dishes mixed with rice are common throughout the region, an example being gallopinto. The Caribbean coasts of Central America also have a more heavy usage of dishes containing coconut (milk, oil, etc.).

===Costa Rica===

The main staple, known as &quot;gallo pinto&quot; (or simply &quot;pinto&quot;), consists of rice and black beans, which in many households is eaten at all three meals during the day.

Other Costa Rican food staples include corn tortillas, white cheese and picadillos. Tortillas are used to accompany most meals. Costa Ricans will often fill their tortillas with whatever they are eating and eat it in the form of a gallo (direct translation: rooster, however, it resembles a soft Mexican taco). White cheese is non-processed cheese that is made by adding salt to milk in production. Picadillos are meat and vegetable combinations where one or more vegetables are diced, mixed with beef and garnished with spices. Common vegetables used in picadillos are potatoes, green beans, squash, ayote, chayote and arracache. Often, picadillos are eaten in the form of gallos.

===El Salvador===

Salvadoran cuisine is a style of cooking derived from the nation of El Salvador. The traditional cuisine consists of food from the Pipil people, with a European twist in most modern dishes. Many of the dishes are made with maize (corn).

El Salvador&#x27;s most notable dish is the pupusa, a thick hand-made corn flour or rice flour tortilla stuffed with cheese, chicharrón (fried pork rinds), refried beans or loroco (a vine flower bud native to Central America). There are also vegetarian options, often with ayote (a type of squash), or garlic. Some adventurous restaurants even offer pupusas stuffed with shrimp or spinach.

Two other typical Salvadoran dishes are yuca frita and panes rellenos. Yuca frita, which is deep fried cassava root served with curtido (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with pescaditas (fried baby sardines). The yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. Panes con Pavo (turkey sandwiches) are warm turkey submarines. The turkey is marinated and then roasted with Pipil spices and handpulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with turkey, tomato, and watercress along with cucumber, onion, lettuce, mayonnaise, and mustard. A lot of Salvadoran food is served with French bread, or pan frances in Spanish.

===Guatemala===
The cuisine of Guatemala reflects the multicultural nature of Guatemala, in that it involves food that differs in taste depending on the region. Guatemala has 22 departments (or divisions), each of which has very different typical foodstuffs. Guatemalan cuisine is widely known for its candy originating from Antigua Guatemala.

There are also foods that it is traditional to eat on certain days of the week - for example, by tradition it is known that on Thursday, the typical food is &quot;paches&quot; which is like a tamal made with a base of potato, and on Saturday it is traditional to eat tamales.

===Honduras===

Honduran cuisine combines Spanish, Caribbean, and pre-Columbian influences of the indigenous Maya-Lenca population. Its most notable feature is that it uses more coconut than any other Central American cuisine in both sweet and savory dishes. Regional specialties include pollo con tajadas (fried chicken with fried green banana chips) fried fish, carne asada, and baleadas. Platano maduro fritos with sour creme are also a common dish.

In addition to the baleadas, the following are also popular: meat roasted with chismol carne asada, chicken with rice and corn, fried fish (Yojoa style) with encurtido (pickled onions and jalapeños). In the coastal areas and in the Bay Islands, seafood and some meats are prepared in many ways, some of which include coconut milk.

Among the soups the Hondurans enjoy are: conch soup, bean soup, Mondongo soup, or soup of intestine, seafood soups, beef soups, all of which are mixed with plantains, yuca, cabbage among other things, and complemented with corn tortillas.

Other typical dishes are the montucas or corn tamale, stuffed tortillas, tamales wrapped up with banana leaves, among other types of food. Also part of the Honduran typical dishes are an abundant selection of tropical fruits such as: papaya, pineapple, plums, epazotes, passionfruits, and a wide variety of bananas and plantains which are prepared in many ways.

===Nicaragua===

The cuisine of Nicaragua is a fusion of Spanish, Caribbean and pre-Columbian dishes of the indigenous peoples. When the Spaniards first arrived in Nicaragua they found that the indigenous peoples had incorporated foods available in the area into their cuisine. Despite the blending and incorporation of pre-Columbian and Spanish influenced cuisine, traditional cuisine changes from the Pacific to the Caribbean coast. While the Pacific coast&#x27;s main staple revolves around fruits and corn, the Caribbean coast makes use of seafood and the coconut.

As in many other Latin American countries, corn is a main staple. Corn is used in many of the widely consumed dishes, such as indio viejo and quesillo. Nicaragua&#x27;s most famous corn dish is the Nacatamal. Nacatamales originated from the Nicarao people. During pre-Columbian times, the Nicarao stuffed their nacatamales with hunted meats like deer and turkey, tomatoes, achiote and herbs to season and increase the nacatamal&#x27;s flavor before being wrapped in corn husks and steamed. After Spanish conquest however, nacatamales were made with introduced meats like pork. They also evolved to include flavorful ingredients like onions and potatoes, and banana leaves replaced corn husks. Corn is also an ingredient for drinks such as pinolillo and chicha as well as in some sweets and desserts. Locally grown vegetables and fruits have been in use since before the arrival of the Spaniards and their influence on Nicaraguan cuisine. Many of Nicaragua&#x27;s dishes include fruits and vegetables such as avocado, tomato, tomatillo, potato, jocote, grosella, mimbro, mango, papaya, tamarind, pipián, banana, yuca, and herbs such as cilantro, oregano and achiote.

Gallo pinto is Nicaragua&#x27;s national dish, consisting of red beans and rice. The dish has several variations including the addition of coconut oil or grated coconut which is primarily prepared on Nicaragua&#x27;s Caribbean coast. It is thought to have originated in Nicaragua; however, there is some controversy about the origins of this dish.

===Panama===

Panamanian cuisine has its own unique and rich cuisine. As a land bridge between two continents, Panama is blessed by nature with an unusual variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking. Also, as a crossroads of the world catalyzed by the Panama Canal, Panamanian cuisine is influenced by its diverse population of Hispanic, native Amerindian, European, African, Colombian, Jamaican, and Chinese migration. A common Panamanian diet includes seafood such as crab, lobster, and squid, many versions of chicken soup, and vast amounts of fruit such as papayas, coconuts, and bananas. They also drink chicha, a very common drink found in Panama.

==Mexico==

Mexican cuisine is a style of food which is primarily a fusion of indigenous Mesoamerican cooking with European (especially Spanish) cooking developed after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. The basic staples remain the native corn, beans and chili peppers but the Europeans introduced a large number of other foods, the most important of which were meat from domesticated animals (beef, pork, chicken, goat and sheep), dairy products (especially cheese) and various herbs and spices. While the Spanish initially tried to superimpose their diet on the country, this was not possible thanks largely to Mexico&#x27;s highly developed indigenous cuisines. Instead, the foods and cooking techniques of both the indigenous Mexicans and the Spanish began to be mixed contributing to the development of an even more varied and rich cuisine. Over the centuries, this resulted in various regional cuisines, based on local conditions such as those in the north, Oaxaca, Veracruz and the Yucatán Peninsula. Mexican cuisine is highly tied to the culture, social structure and its popular traditions, the most important example of which is the use of mole for special occasions and holidays, particularly in the South region of the country. For this reason and others, Mexican cuisine was added by UNESCO to its list of the world&#x27;s &quot;intangible cultural heritage&quot;.

Mexican-Americans in the United States have developed regional cuisines largely incorporating the ingredients and cooking styles of authentic Mexican cuisines. Tex-Mex is a term describing a regional American cuisine that blends food products available in the United States and the culinary creations of Mexican-Americans influenced by Mexican cuisine. Mexican cuisine varies by region, because of local climate and geography and ethnic differences among the indigenous inhabitants and because these different populations were influenced by the Spaniards in varying degrees.

Central Mexico&#x27;s cuisine is largely made up of influences from the rest of the country, but also has its authentics, such as barbacoa, pozole, menudo, tamales, and carnitas.
Southeastern Mexico, on the other hand, is known for its spicy vegetable and chicken-based dishes. The cuisine of Southeastern Mexico also has quite a bit of Caribbean influence, given its geographical location. Veal is common in the Yucatán. Seafood is commonly prepared in the states that border the Pacific Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico, the latter having a famous reputation for its fish dishes, in particular &quot;à la veracruzana&quot;.

==South America==
The richest products of South America come from the middle of the continent, the Amazonia Potatoes are frequently grown as a result of this, and also plants such as quinoa. The Peruvian capital, Lima, was declared the &quot;Gastronomic Capital of the Americas&quot; in 2006. Many plains are also on this continent, which are rich for growing food in abundance. In the Patagonian south of Argentina, many people produce lamb and venison. King crab is typically caught at the southern end of the continent. Antarctic krill has been recently discovered and is now considered a fine dish. Tuna and tropical fish are caught all around the continent, but Easter Island is where they are found in abundance. Lobster is also caught in great quantities from the Juan Fernández Islands.

=== Argentina ===

The cuisine of Argentina is strongly influenced by Italian and Spanish cuisines and cooking techniques. Indigenous gastronomies derived from groups such as the Quechua, Mapuche, and Guarani have also played a role.
There are many regional differences, specially in the provincial states of the north, west, east and central Argentina, with many plants, fruits and dishes that are not known or barely known in Buenos Aires.

Another determining factor in Argentine cuisine is that Argentina is one of the world&#x27;s major food producers. It is a major producer of meat (especially beef), wheat, corn, milk, beans, and since the 1970s, soybeans. Given the country&#x27;s vast production of beef, red meat is an especially common part of the Argentine diet. Due to the very large number of Argentines of Italian ancestry, pizza and especially pasta are also very popular, but there are food traditions from other European nations as well, including the English afternoon tea.

=== Bolivia ===

Bolivian cuisine is the result of Spanish cuisine with infusions of ancient Andean tradition and varies greatly due to the geography of Bolivia. It has been influenced by the Inca cuisine, Aymara cuisine, Spanish cuisine, and to a lesser extent the cuisines of other neighboring countries, like Argentina and Paraguay. European immigration to Bolivia is not as common when compared with other Latin American countries, and while German, Italian, Basque and other cuisines have influenced the cuisine of Bolivia, Spanish cuisine remains the primary influence.

In Western Bolivia in the Altiplano, due to the high, cold climate cuisine tends to use spices, whereas in the lowlands of Bolivia in the more Amazonian regions dishes consist of products abundant in the region: fruits, vegetables, fish and yuca.

&quot;Almuerzo&quot; is the most important meal of the Bolivian day, so much so that daily life tends to revolve around it. Long lunches are traditional throughout the country, so businesses and shops often close between the hours of 12 and 2 pm, so that the workers have time to return home for lunch. A typical Bolivian lunch would consist of several courses, including a soup, a main course of meat, rice, and potatoes, then a dessert and coffee. Lunch is taken at a leisurely pace and is traditionally followed by a nap, the oft-cited &quot;siesta&quot;.

=== Brazil ===

The cuisine of Brazil, like Brazil itself, varies greatly by region. Brazilian cuisine can be divided into several distinct locations. From the north of Brazil through the Amazonian jungle, and directly down the Brazilian coastline.

This diversity reflects the country&#x27;s mix of native Amerindians, Portuguese, Africans, Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Syrians, Lebanese and Japanese, among others. This has created a national cooking style marked by the preservation of regional differences.

Coffee, being one of the main agricultural products of Brazil, is an indispensable part of every Brazilian&#x27;s diet. &quot;Chimarrão,&quot; a caffeinated drink made of “erva mate”, and the super caffeinated &quot;cafezinho&quot; are commonly served at meals, between meals, and for snacks. The average Brazilian drinks 12-24 of these concoctions per day.

=== Chile ===

Chilean cuisine stems from the combination of traditional Spanish cuisine with indigenous ingredients.

European immigrants also brought with them various styles and traditions in cooking, heavily influencing the cuisine of Chile, including Italian, German, and French influences as well as the English afternoon tea. These mixtures have created a unique fusion. Seafood is widely used and an array of produce which historically has grown throughout the region have been implemented into Chilean gastronomy. Many recipes are accompanied and enhanced by Chilean wine such as Curanto.

=== Colombia ===

The cuisine of Colombia consists of a large variety of dishes that take into account the difference in regional climates. For example, in the city of Medellín the typical dish is the bandeja paisa. It includes beans, rice, ground meat or carne asada, chorizo, fried egg, arepa and chicharrón. It is usually accompanied by avocado, tomato and sauces.

Inland, the plates resemble the mix of cultures, inherited mainly from Amerindian and European cuisine, and the produce of the land mainly agriculture, cattle, river fishing and other animals&#x27; raising. Such is the case of the sancocho soup in Valledupar. Local species of animals like the guaratinaja, part of the wayuu Amerindian culture.

=== Ecuador ===


The food in Ecuador is diverse, varying with altitude, associated agricultural conditions, and ethnic and racial communities. Ecuadorian cuisine is an amalgamation of Spanish, Andean, and Amazonian cuisines and to a lesser degree Italian, Lebanese, African, and Chinese. Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional 3 course meal of sopa/soup and segundo/second dish then dessert and a coffee are customary. Dinner is usually lighter and sometimes just coffee or agua de remedio/herbal tea with bread.

Beef, chicken, and seafood are popular in the coastal regions and are typically served with carbohydrate-rich foods, such as rice accompanied with lentils, pasta, or plantain, whereas in the mountainous regions pork, chicken, beef and cuy (guinea pig) are popular and are often served with rice, corn, or potatoes. 

Some of the typical dishes in the coastal region are: a variety of ceviches, &quot;pan de yuca&quot; (cassava bread), &quot;corviche&quot; (plantain, peanut and fish dumplings), &quot;guatita&quot;, &quot;encebollado&quot; (fish, cassava and onion stew), &quot;empanada de viento&quot; (deep-fried flour empanada with cheese filling, served sprinkled with sugar), empanada de verde (green plantain empanada with cheese filling), mangrove crab, &quot;arroz con menestra&quot; (lentil or bean stew and rice) con asado, &quot;caldo de bola&quot; (beef soup featuring a green plantain ball filled with meat, egg, and spices). Local staples are rice, plantains and a great variety of seafood.

Typical dishes in the mountain region include: hornado, fritada, humitas, tamales, llapingachos, lomo saltado, and &quot;churrasco&quot;. Pork, chicken, beef, and &quot;cuy&quot; (guinea pig) are popular in the mountain regions and are served with a variety of grains (especially rice and corn or potatoes). A popular street food in mountain regions is &quot;hornado&quot;, consisting of potatoes served with roasted pig. Fanesca, a fish soup including several types of bean, is often eaten during Lent and Easter. During the week before the commemoration of the deceased or All Souls&#x27; Day, the fruit beverage &quot;colada morada&quot; is typical, accompanied by &quot;t&#x27;anta wawa&quot; which is stuffed bread shaped like children.

In the rainforest, a dietary staple is the yuca, elsewhere called cassava. The starchy root is peeled and boiled, fried, or used in a variety of other dishes. Across the nation it is also used as a bread, pan de yuca, which is analogous to the Brazilian pão de queijo and its often consumed alongside different types of drinkable yogurt &quot;yogur persa&quot; brought by Persian immigrants. 

Chifa (from the Mandarin words 吃饭, meaning &quot;to eat rice&quot;) Ecuadorian-Chinese fusion food is a mainstay of Ecuadorian cuisine.

=== Paraguay ===

The cuisine of Paraguay is the set of dishes and culinary techniques of Paraguay. Much like its neighboring countries, Paraguayan cuisine is a fusion of Indigenous cuisine (Guaraní), Spanish cuisine and international cuisines from those who have immigrated over the years. Meat, especially beef, is a staple of the Paraguayan diet. This is reflected in the Asado, a series of barbecuing practices and the social event that are traditional to Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay.

The cuisine of Paraguay includes unique dishes such as &quot;sopa paraguaya,&quot; kiveve prepared using a pumpkin, also known as &quot;andai&quot;, or Chipa Guasú. Chipa Guasú, an original dish to Paraguay, is a cake made with corn grains that is now widely served in Northeastern Argentina as well. The national drink of Paraguay is known as terere, in addition to fruit juices and soft drinks being very common throughout the country. Yucca and corn are two important ingredients in Paraguayan cuisine

=== Peru ===

Peru has a varied cuisine with ingredients like potato, uchu or Ají (Capsicum pubescens), oca, ulluco, avocado, fruits like chirimoya, lúcuma and pineapple, and animals like taruca (&quot;Hippocamelus antisensis&quot;), llama and guinea pig (called &quot;cuy&quot;). The combination of Inca and Spanish culinary traditions, resulted in new meals and ways of preparing them. The arrival of Africans, Chinese and Japanese immigrants in the 19th century also resulted in the development of &quot;Creole&quot; cuisine in the city of Lima, where the vast majority of these immigrants settled.

Some typical Peruvian dishes are ceviche (fish and shellfish marinated in citrus juices), the chupe de camarones (a soup made of shrimp (&quot;Cryphiops caementarius&quot;)), anticuchos (cow&#x27;s heart roasted &quot;en brochette&quot;), the olluco con charqui (a casserole dish made of ulluco and charqui), the Andean pachamanca (meats, tubers and broad beans cooked in a stone oven), the lomo saltado (meat fried lightly with tomato and onion, served with french fries and rice) that has a Chinese influence, and the picante de cuy (a casserole dish made of fried guinea pig with some spices). Peruvian food can be accompanied by typical drinks like the chicha de jora (a chicha made of tender corn dried by the sun). There are also chichas made of peanuts or purple corn, known as chicha morada.

=== Uruguay ===

The cuisine of Uruguay is traditionally based on its European roots, especially from Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, Germany and Britain. Many foods from those countries such as pasta, sausages, and desserts are common in the nation&#x27;s diet. The Uruguayan barbecue, asado, is one of the most exquisite and famous in the world. A sweet paste, Dulce de Leche is the national obsession, used to fill cookies, cakes, pancakes, milhojas, and alfajores.

The base of the country&#x27;s diet is meat and animal products: primarily beef but also chicken, lamb, pig, and sometimes fish. The preferred cooking methods for meats and vegetables are still boiling and roasting, although modernization has popularized frying (see milanesas and chivitos). Meanwhile, wheat and fruit are generally served fried (torta frita and pasteles), comfited (rapadura and ticholos de banana), and sometimes baked (rosca de chicharrones), a new modern style. Bushmeat comes from mulitas and carpinchos. Regional fruits like butia and pitanga are commonly used for flavoring caña, along with quinotos and nísperos.

=== Venezuela ===

Due to its land, diversity of agricultural resources, and the cultural diversity of the Venezuelan people, Venezuelan cuisine often varies greatly from one region to another. Its cuisine, traditional as well as modern, is influenced by its European, Amerindian and West African traditions. Food staples include corn, rice, plantain, yams, beans and several meats. Potatoes, tomatoes, onions, eggplants, squashes, spinach and zucchini are also common sides in the Venezuelan diet. Venezuela has several representative national dishes such as the arepa (a corn based bread like patty), pan de jamón, tequeño, pabellón criollo and the hallaca at Christmas time.

<doc id="524652" wikidata="Q3256906" url="?curid=524652" title="Master chief petty officer">
<text>A master chief petty officer is a senior non-commissioned officer in many navies and coast guards, usually above some grade of petty officer.

==United States==
Master chief petty officer (MCPO) is the ninth (just below the rank of MCPON) enlisted rank (with pay grade E-9) in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard, just above Senior Chief Petty Officer (SCPO). Master chief petty officers are addressed as &quot;Master Chief (last name)&quot; in colloquial contexts. They constitute the top 1.25% of the enlisted members of the maritime forces.

Prior to 1958, chief petty officer was the highest enlisted rate in both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. This changed on 20 May 1958 with the passage of Public Law 85-422, the Military Pay Act of 1958, which established two new enlisted pay grades of E-8 and E-9 in all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the Navy and Coast Guard, the new E-8 pay grade was titled Senior Chief Petty Officer and the new E-9 pay grade as Master Chief Petty Officer, with the first selectees promoting to their respective grades in 1959 and 1960.

===Advancement===
In the Navy, advancement to master chief petty officer is similar to that of chief petty officer and senior chief petty officer. It carries requirements of time in service, superior evaluation scores (based on rater giving the evaluation, fluid variables for criterion and other factors including but not limited to community involvement), and selection by a board of master chiefs. Similarly, senior chief petty officers and chief petty officers are chosen by selection boards. In the Coast Guard, advancement to master chief petty officer is done by competing in a single annual board. The board ranks all eligible senior chiefs using their career records. Master chief petty officers are then selected monthly from this prioritization list as positions become available.

Petty officers of all grades possess both a rate (the enlisted term for rank) and rating (job, similar to a military occupational specialty (MOS) in other branches). The full title (most commonly used) is a combination of the two. Thus, a master chief petty officer with the rating of fire controlman would properly be called a master chief fire controlman.

Each rating has an official abbreviation, such as FC for fire controlman, FT for fire control technician, and STS for sonar technician, submarines. When combined with the rate abbreviation (MC for master chief without rating), it produces the full rate designation, such as FCCM for fire controlman chief master (more commonly said as Master Chief Fire Controlman). It is not uncommon practice to refer to the master chief by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence (such as printing and inscription on awards). Mostly, though, they are simply called &quot;master chief&quot;, regardless of rating.

The rate insignia for a master chief is a white eagle with spread wings above three chevrons. The chevrons are topped by a rocker (arc) that goes behind the eagle. Two inverted silver stars (a reference to the stars used on the sleeves of line officers) are placed above the eagle. Between the arc and the top chevron is the specialty mark of the enlisted rating. This is used on the service dress blue, dinner dress blue jacket, and dinner dress white jacket uniforms. On other uniforms, the insignia used for shirt collars and caps is the one that has become universally accepted as the symbol of the chief petty officer. This is a gold foul anchor (though sometimes the word &quot;fouled&quot; is used, the proper term is &quot;foul anchor&quot;) superimposed with a silver &quot;USN&quot; (Navy) or a silver shield (Coast Guard). As on the rating badge, this is capped by two five-pointed stars, showing one ray down.

====Command master chief petty officer====

Master chief petty officers are generally considered to be the technical experts in their fields. They serve at sea and ashore in commands of all sizes. Some master chiefs choose to enter the command master chief petty officer program. If selected, a master chief receives additional leadership training and is assigned to a command as the command master chief (CMC). The command master chief is the senior enlisted person at a command and works as a liaison between the commanding officer and the enlisted ranks, serving as the senior enlisted leader. In this capacity, the CMC assists the commanding officer in issues of quality of life, discipline, training, and morale. On submarines, the equivalent of a CMC is called the chief of the boat or &quot;COB&quot;. The CMC insignia has a silver star in lieu of the enlisted rating insignia between the rocker and the top chevron.

====Fleet and force master chief petty officer====

Fleet and force master chiefs are appointed by the commander of a fleet or a force command to serve as their senior enlisted adviser. These two ranks are equivalent and their insignia is also the same—a master chief rating badge with two gold stars above the eagle and a gold star for the rating insignia.

A force master chief petty officer (FORCM) is a master chief who has virtually the same responsibility as command master chiefs, but for larger force commands rather than a single unit. There are 15 force master chief positions in the Navy:
*Bureau of Medicine and Surgery
*Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet
*Naval Air Forces
*Naval Education and Training Command
*Naval Facilities Engineering Command
*Naval Special Warfare
*Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet
*Naval Surface Forces
*Naval Information Forces
*Navy Expeditionary Combat Command
*Navy Installations Command
*Navy Personnel Command
*Navy Reserve Forces
*Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet
*Submarine Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet

A fleet master chief petty officer (FLTCM) is a master chief who again has virtually the same responsibility as command master chiefs, but for larger fleet commands. There are four fleet master chief positions in the Navy:
*United States Fleet Forces Command
*United States Pacific Fleet
*United States Naval Forces, Europe/Africa
*Personnel, Manpower, and Training/MyNavy HR (OPNAV N1 FLT)

====Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy====
There exists one post that is unique – Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON, pronounced ). The holder of this post is appointed by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) to serve as the most senior enlisted member in the Navy. The MCPON adds a third star above the rating insignia described earlier, and all three stars are gold (silver on the gold foul anchor collar device). Likewise, the rating specialty mark is replaced by a gold star. As of September 2022, James Honea is the current MCPON.

====Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard====
The Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard (MCPOCG) is appointed by the Commandant of the Coast Guard to serve as the most senior enlisted member in the Coast Guard. The MCPOCG adds a third star above the rating insignia described earlier, and all three stars are gold (silver on the gold foul anchor collar device). Likewise, the rating specialty mark is replaced by a gold shield. , the current master chief petty officer of the Coast Guard is Heath B. Jones.

<text>Edward Barron Chandler (August 22, 1800 – February 6, 1880) was a New Brunswick politician and lawyer from a United Empire Loyalist family. He was one of the Fathers of Confederation.

== Early life ==
Edward Barron Chandler was born in Amherst, Nova Scotia on August 22, 1800, to parents Charles Henry Chandler and Elizabeth Rice. His grandfather, Colonel Joshua Chandler, was a wealthy Connecticut legislature member-turned loyalist.

== Career ==
He later moved to New Brunswick to study law. He moved to Dorchester, New Brunswick and served in the colony&#x27;s government. In 1827 he was elected to the New Brunswick legislature as an opponent of responsible government and later served on the province&#x27;s &quot;Legislative Council&quot; (the legislature&#x27;s Upper House) and in Cabinet serving as leader of the &quot;compact&quot; government that ruled the colony from 1848 to 1854 prior to the institution of responsible government.

In 1836 Chandler became a member of New Brunswick&#x27;s Legislative Council.

Later, Chandler was a New Brunswick delegate to the conferences in London, Charlottetown, and Quebec that led to Canadian confederation. Though he supported the federal Conservatives of Sir John A. Macdonald he was a cautious supporter who opposed a strong central government.

Chandler was a supporter of railway development and was instrumental as a federally appointed commissioner overseeing construction of the Intercolonial Railway in having its surveys diverted from a direct route between Amherst and Moncton to run through his community of Dorchester. He also supported the policy of reciprocity with the United States. He refused an appointment to the Senate of Canada but accepted an appointment as the fifth Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick in 1878.

Chandler was a Freemason of Sussex Lodge, No. 480 (England).

== Personal life and death ==

In 1822, Chandler married Phoebe Milledge; they had 11 children, of which seven survived into adulthood. Chandler died in Fredericton on February 6, 1880.

Chandler&#x27;s home in Dorchester, Chandler House or Rocklyn, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1971.

<text>Command master chief petty officer (CMDCM) is an enlisted rating in the United States Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, as well as the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.

In the U.S. Navy, the command master chief petty officer is the senior enlisted advisor at a command and as such works as a liaison between the commanding officer and the enlisted ranks, serving as the senior enlisted leader. In this capacity, the CMDCM assists the commanding officer in issues of quality of life, discipline, training, and morale. Collectively, the CMDCM, commanding officer, and executive officer are referred to as the &quot;big three&quot;.

==Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force==

Japan&#x27;s navy, the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), first established their command master chief petty officer program in 2003, modelling it on that of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s.

==United States==
===United States Navy===
A command master chief petty officer is the most senior enlisted sailor in a United States Navy unit. They advise their respective commander or Commanding Officer, and provide input in the formulation, implementation, and execution of policies concerning morale, welfare, job satisfaction, discipline, utilization, family support, and training of enlisted sailors, as well as providing input and advice in matters affecting mission and operations as required. In smaller units, this position may be filled by a command senior chief petty officer (CMDCS), a command chief petty officer (CMDC), or a master chief petty officer who is not yet a command master chief. The rates force master chief petty officer (FORCM) and fleet master chief petty officer (FLTCM) are used for larger units such as U.S. Fleet Forces Command, Navy Expeditionary Combat Command, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and Submarine Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet. There are only four FLTCMs and 16 FORCMs in the U.S. Navy.

====Background====
First referenced in OPNAVINST 1306.2C dated 16 October 1995 (now 1306.2J), the Navy states that its command master chief program is ostensibly intended to stimulate free-flowing communications, and ensure the highest standards of professionalism are upheld at all levels within the chain of command. Command master chiefs strengthen the chain of command by keeping the commanding officer aware of existing or potential situations as well as procedures and practices which affect the mission, readiness, welfare and morale of the sailors in the command. CMDCMs are the senior enlisted leaders who report directly to the officer commanding the unit for which they are the CMDCM. They formulate and implement policies concerning morale, welfare, job satisfaction, discipline, utilization and training of navy personnel. By reporting directly to their commanding officer, the CMDCMs keep their chain of command aware and informed of sensitive and current issues.

The Bureau of Personnel assigns a CMDCM to commands with 250 or more enlisted manpower. All carrier-based air wing squadrons, deployable helicopter anti-submarine warfare light, helicopter combat support, and maritime patrol squadrons will have a CMDCM requirement regardless of size due to the complexity of their operations. Those commands that do not have enlisted manpower of 250 assign a CMDCM from within command resources on a collateral duty basis. In the absence of a master chief petty officer, a senior chief petty officer or chief petty officer may be assigned, such as with the s, which sometimes had the former during their lifespan with the U.S. Navy.

In 2015, the U.S. Navy formally established the rating of command senior chief petty officer (CMDCS), whereas previously it had been a billet.

====Submarines====

The equivalent of a command master chief on U.S. Navy submarines is known as the &quot;chief of the boat,&quot; or &quot;COB&quot;. The COB has similar duties to that of a command master chief in a surface, aviation, or shore unit.

====Insignia====

The rank insignia of a command master chief petty officer consists of two silver stars, one perched eagle, one silver star taking the place of rating insignia, and one rocker above three chevrons.

===United States Coast Guard===

Like the U.S. Navy, the United States Coast Guard also utilizes the title and designation of command master chief. These individuals are also informally referred to as &quot;gold badge&quot; due to the insignia they wear. Command master chiefs can be so designated either by the Commandant of the Coast Guard or the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard. One commandant-designated CMC is located at each area, each district, both maintenance and logistics commands, headquarters, the Coast Guard Academy, and the Deployable Operations Group. One commandant-designated reserve command master chief is located at each area, each district, both maintenance and logistics commands. One Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard-designated CMC is located at each training center, Coast Guard recruiting command, and the Personnel Service Center.

====Insignia====
The rate insignia of a command master chief petty officer consists of two silver stars, one perched eagle, one silver shield taking the place of rating insignia, and one rocker above three chevrons.

==In popular culture==
* In the 2014 TV series &quot;The Last Ship&quot;, the character Russell Jeter (portrayed by Charles Parnell) is the command master chief aboard the USS &quot;Nathan James&quot; and holds the rank of command master chief petty officer.

<text>Jón Thoroddsen elder (October 5, 1818 – March 8, 1868) was an Icelandic poet and novelist.

==Biography==
He was born at Reykhólar in western Iceland. He studied law at the University of Copenhagen, entered the Danish army as volunteer in 1848 in the war against the insurgents of Schleswig-Holstein, who were aided by Prussia and the other German states (see First Schleswig War). He went back to Iceland in 1850, became sheriff () of Barðastrandarsýsla, and later in Borgarfjarðarsýsla, where he died in 1868.

His son, Þorvaldur Thoroddsen, became a well-known scientist.

==Work==
He is the first novel writer of Iceland. Jónas Hallgrímsson had led the way by his short stories, but the earliest veritable Icelandic novel was Jón Thóroddsen&#x27;s &quot;Piltur og Stúlka&quot; (&quot;Boy and Girl&quot;), a picture of Icelandic country life. Later followed &quot;Maður og Kona&quot; (&quot;Man and Woman&quot;), published after his death by the Icelandic Literary Society. His poems, mostly satirical, are popular; he follows Jónas Hallgrímsson closely in his style.

Thoroddsen&#x27;s poem &quot;Krummi svaf í klettagjá&quot; makes up the lyrics of a well known folk song in Iceland.

<doc id="524664" wikidata="Q311572" url="?curid=524664" title="Pfiesteria">
<text>Pfiesteria is a genus of heterotrophic dinoflagellates that has been associated with harmful algal blooms and fish kills. &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; complex organisms (PCOs) were claimed to be responsible for large fish kills in the 1980s and 1990s on the coast of North Carolina and in tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. In reaction to the toxic outbreaks, six states along the US east coast have initiated a monitoring program to allow for rapid response in the case of new outbreaks and to better understand the factors involved in &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; toxicity and outbreaks. New molecular detection methods have revealed that &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; has a worldwide distribution.

==Discovery and naming==
&quot;Pfiesteria&quot; was discovered in 1988 by North Carolina State University researchers JoAnn Burkholder and Ed Noga. The genus was named after Lois Ann Pfiester (1936–1992), a biologist who did much of the early research on dinoflagellates.

==Species==
There are two species described, &quot;Pfiesteria piscicida&quot; (from Latin Pisces, fish; cida, killer.), which has a complex life cycle and the species &quot;Pfiesteria shumwayae&quot;, also with a complex life cycle. 
The type locality of &quot;Pfiesteria piscicida&quot; is Pamlico River Estuary, North Carolina, U.S.A.

==Feeding strategy==
Early research resulted in the hypothesis that &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; is a predatory dinoflagellate that acts as an ambush predator, utilizing a &quot;hit and run&quot; feeding strategy. Release of a toxin paralyzes the respiratory systems of susceptible fish, such as menhaden, causing death by suffocation. &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; then consumes the tissue sloughed off its dead prey.

==Controversy==
&quot;Pfiesteria&quot; biology and the role of PCOs in killing fish and sickening humans have been subject to several controversies and conflicting research results over the last few years.

*Life cycle: Early research suggested a complex lifecycle of &quot;Pfiesteria piscicida&quot;, but this has become controversial over the past few years due to conflicting research results. Especially contested is the question of whether toxic amoeboid forms exist.
*Toxicity to fish: The hypothesis of &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; killing fish via releasing a toxin in the water has been questioned as no toxin could be isolated and no toxicity was observed in some experiments. Toxicity appears to depend on the strains and assays used. The lesions observed on fish presumed killed by &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; have been attributed to water molds by some researchers. However, it has also been established that &quot;Pfiesteria shumwayae&quot; kills fish by feeding on their skin through myzocytosis. In early 2007, a highly unstable toxin produced by the toxic form of &quot;Pfiesteria piscicida&quot; was identified.
*Human illness: The effects of PCOs on humans have been questioned, leading to the &quot;&quot;Pfiesteria&quot; hysteria hypothesis.&quot; A critical review of this hypothesis in the late 1990s concluded that &quot;Pfiesteria&quot;-related illness was unlikely to be caused by mass hysteria. Concluding that there was no evidence to support the existence of &quot;Pfiesteria&quot;-associated human illness, the National Institutes of Health discontinued funding for research into the effects of &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; toxin on humans shortly after a CDC sponsored &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; conference in 2000. A subsequent evaluation, however, concluded that PCOs can cause human illness. The controversy about the risk of &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; exposure to human health is still ongoing.

==In fiction==
*A fictional &quot;Pfiesteria&quot; species dangerous to humans featured in James Powlik&#x27;s 1999 environmental thriller &quot;Sea Change&quot;.
*The fictional species &quot;Pfiesteria homicida&quot; was one of the antagonists in Frank Schätzing&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;The Swarm&quot;. They are a biological weapon created by the yrr, the main antagonists of the novel.

==Municipalities==

The Tuzla Canton comprises the following municipalities:
==History and culture==
The canton was created by the Washington Agreement in 1994, and its boundaries defined by the Dayton Agreement in 1995. Tuzla Canton was called Tuzla-Podrinje Canton until February 1999. Podrinje means ‘region near the river Drina’ but as the river did not flow through the Canton, a name change was authorised.

The Srebrenik Fortress is Bosnia&#x27;s best-preserved medieval fort, dating from 1333 and is located in Srebrenik. The Panonian lake is a famous holiday resort for tourists.

Tuzla is the hip hop center of the Balkans due to Edo Maajka, Frenkie and the first hip hop station in Bosnia, which is located in Tuzla, FMJAM. Music artist guitarist Emir Hot, pianist Bešlić, accordionist Emir Vildić and violinist Selma Dizdarević are also from Tuzla. Famous singers Selma Bajrami and Lepa Brena were both born in Tuzla.

<text>Portland Harbour is beside the Isle of Portland, Dorset, on the south coast of England. Construction of the harbour began in 1849; when completed in 1872, its surface area made it the largest human-made harbour in the world, and it remains one of the largest in the world today. It is naturally sheltered by Portland to the south, Chesil Beach to the west and mainland Dorset to the north. It consists of four breakwaters: two southern and two northern. These have a total length of and enclose approximately of water.

Portland Harbour was built by the Admiralty as a facility for the Royal Navy (though access was also available to merchant ships); on 11 December 1923 it was formally designated HM Naval Base (HMNB) Portland, and continued to serve as such until closure in 1995.

==History==

===Creation of harbour of refuge (1844–1872)===
The original harbour was naturally sheltered by the south coast of England, Chesil Beach and the Isle of Portland, providing refuge for ships against weather in all directions except east. The harbour had already been used by ships for centuries when, in the 16th century, King Henry VIII built Portland Castle and Sandsfoot Castle to defend the anchorage. Prompted by the expansion of the French naval port of Cherbourg, just across the English Channel, the Royal Navy established a base at Portland in 1845; a scheme for the harbour to be transformed into a refuge had been granted parliamentary approval the year before. Portland was the first naval anchorage specifically designed for the new steam navy. Similar harbours of refuge would be built at Alderney, Dover, Holyhead, and later (in response to the increased naval threat from Germany) at Peterhead.
Construction of the two breakwaters began in 1849 when HRH Prince Albert laid the foundation stone on 25 July. Designed by engineer James Meadows Rendel, the work was carried out under civil engineer John Towlerton Leather, with Rendel as engineer in chief (until his death in 1856), and John Coode as resident engineer. During 1848, HM Prison Portland was established to provide convict labour to quarry the stone needed to construct the breakwaters and the harbour defences. Known as the Admiralty Quarries, they provided 10,000 tons of stone per week. The breakwaters were declared complete by HRH Edward the Prince of Wales on 10 August 1872. A major government project, the construction work had become Dorset&#x27;s greatest tourist attraction of its time.

===Construction of harbour defences===
The initial southern breakwaters were built between 1849 and 1872; meanwhile, various defences were created to defend the harbour. The Verne Citadel, designed by Captain Crosman R.E., was built at Verne Hill between 1860 and 1881: the 56 acre (23 ha) fortress was designed for 1000 troops and had gun emplacements facing seawards on three sides. Below the eastern side of the citadel, East Weare Battery was built during the 1860s, along with the detention barracks East Weare Camp. On the end of the inner breakwater was the Inner Pierhead Fort, and on the outer breakwater the circular Breakwater Fort. On Weymouth&#x27;s side of the harbour, the Nothe Fort was built at the end of the Nothe Peninsula, and completed in 1872. In 1892, the Verne High Angle Battery was built in a disused quarry near the Verne Citadel, but was decommissioned in 1906.

As part of further defence works against the threat of torpedo attack, the harbour&#x27;s two northern breakwaters were built between 1893 and 1906. In 1902, additional defences were constructed, including Upton Fort at Osmington and Blacknor Fort on the western side of Portland. By 1903, the East Weares Rifle Range served the navy and other military on the eastern side of the island. In 1905, the Portland Breakwater Lighthouse was erected on the southern end of northeast breakwater, where it continues to operate today.

===Establishment of Royal Navy at Portland===

The harbour was envisaged primarily as a coaling station for the Royal Navy, being conveniently equidistant from the Royal Navy&#x27;s two principal bases at Portsmouth and Devonport; however it was also where the Channel Squadron was based, newly re-formed in 1858.

In the 20th century, Portland became increasingly renowned for its training and research facilities.

====Fuelling facilities====

Coaling facilities were initially integrated into the design of the inner breakwater. A new coaling pier was built between 1890 and 1896, and expanded coaling facilities were still being added in 1906. During the 20th century the harbour increasingly became a naval oiling depot and, beginning in the early 1900s, the tidal creek the Mere began to be filled in for a vast tank farm.

====Naval base====
Over time, Portland was successively the base for the Channel and Home Fleets, as well as part of the Reserve Fleet, and it also served as a depot for submarines. In the early years of the 20th century it served as base for the Navy&#x27;s first Torpedo Boat Destroyers.

====Naval Dockyard facilities====

In the 1850s it had been proposed that a full Royal Navy Dockyard be established, with three dry docks, three shipbuilding slips, a fitting-out basin and associated factory facilities. These plans were not carried through, however a floating dry dock was introduced in 1914, enabling Portland to function as a repair and refit facility, and by 1914 Portland was officially listed as a Naval Dockyard (remaining so until 1959). Onshore amenities included a range of storehouses, workshops and office buildings.

====Support facilities====
Support facilities for the fleet were also added over time, including a canteen and recreation ground (opened in 1903). The nearby Royal Naval Hospital in Castletown served the naval base from 1904 (replacing an earlier Sick Quarters), until 1957 when it was handed over to the NHS.

====Research facilities====
The development of both the torpedo and the submarine led to Portland Harbour becoming a centre for research into underwater warfare, beginning with the establishment of Whitehead Torpedo Works at Wyke Regis in 1891. A purpose-built pier projecting into the harbour from the factory was used for torpedo testing and practice firing. The factory closed in 1997 and was cleared to make way for a housing development named Whitehead Drive, which includes a memorial stone and plaque to commemorate the factory.

====Training facilities====
In 1862 was moored at Portland to serve as a training ship for naval cadets. She was replaced by in 1866 (following &quot;Britannia&quot;″s relocation to Dartmouth). &quot;Boscawen&quot; was herself replaced in 1873 by HMS &quot;Trafalgar&quot;, which took on the same name. In 1882 an onshore training complex was built, above the dockyard on Portland Bill. As the Royal Navy grew in size towards the end of the 19th century, additional accommodation was required for boys&#x27; training, which saw the arrival of in 1898 and in 1904; they were named &quot;Boscawen II&quot; and &quot;Boscawen III&quot; respectively. The training establishment closed in 1906; while &quot;Boscawen&quot; (ex-&quot;Trafalgar&quot;) was sold, &quot;Boscawen II&quot; and &quot;Boscawen III&quot; were transferred to Harwich and subsequently attached to .

===World War I to World War II (1914–1945)===
The increasing threat of conflict with Germany before the Great War erupted saw the arrival of the Dreadnoughts in Portland, while seaplanes began to operate in Portland&#x27;s skies. King George V watched aerial displays from the royal yacht in the harbour in May 1912. This occasion saw a biplane demonstrate the first British flight from a moving ship, and afterwards the king took the first ever royal trip in a submarine.

In 1914, the Grand Fleet assembled in Portland Harbour before sailing to Scapa Flow. As a measure against submarine attack, the battleship was scuttled across the harbour&#x27;s southern entrance in 1914.

====Anti-submarine School and ASDIC Research &amp; Development====
In 1917 the RNAS seaplane base at Portland was commissioned as . Under its command, a &#x27;listening school&#x27; was established to help develop hydrophone underwater listening devices and other anti-submarine measures, and to train personnel in their use. The school initially operated from temporary accommodation in Weymouth, before moving in 1918 to a site at East Weare, just south of the Dockyard. Meanwhile, the experimental work was carried out within the dockyard itself: namely in a pair of sheds on the inner breakwater and in what had been the Admiralty Slaughter Houses (just to the south, at Balaclava Bay), which were swiftly converted into workshops. The dockyard swimming pool was also put to use, as a testing tank.

&quot;Sarepta&quot; was decommissioned in December 1919, but the anti-submarine work continued, overseen from the cruiser , which became lead ship of a small anti-submarine flotilla, made up of R-class destroyers and P-class patrol boats, fitted with ASDIC for training and for experimental testing.

In 1924, however, Portland&#x27;s Anti-Submarine School (having been consolidated with similar units from and HM Signal School, Portsmouth) was itself commissioned as HMS &quot;Osprey&quot;, becoming an independent shore command. ( initially served as the depot ship, and was duly renamed &quot;Osprey&quot;; but in 1928 she was sold out of service and the name was transferred ashore). Its facilities included laboratories and workshops, a large water tank for conducting experiments and an inshore testing site for trials of ASDIC on the inner breakwater (by the late 1930s over 200 civilians were employed in &quot;Osprey&quot;&#x27;s ASDIC Research and Development Unit (ARDU)).

====World War II====
From 1940, the harbour came under fierce German air attack, with Portland suffering 48 air attacks, in which 532 bombs were dropped, over the course of the war. In July 1940, the anti-aircraft ship was attacked by Stuka dive-bombers and sank in the harbour. The second of only two Victoria Crosses awarded for action in the United Kingdom was posthumously bestowed on Jack Foreman Mantle, who died at his post on the ship. Although mortally wounded he continued to fire his gun against the attackers until he died. Mantle is buried in Portland&#x27;s Royal Naval Cemetery, which overlooks the harbour. In 1940–41, the Portland Naval Communication Headquarters was constructed, built into the hillside at the rear of the dockyard.

In January 1941 &quot;Osprey&quot; moved out of Portland to the relative safety of Dunoon on the west coast of Scotland; the experimental section operated as a sub-division of &quot;Osprey&quot;, known as HM Anti-Submarine Experimental Establishment, in Fairlie, North Ayrshire. In the meantime the Portland was redesignated to serve as a Coastal Forces base, commissioned under the name HMS &quot;Attack&quot;.

On 1 May 1944, the harbour was commissioned as USNAAB Portland-Weymouth. Both Portland and Weymouth were major embarkation points for American troops during D-Day, particularly the US 1st Division who embarked for Omaha Beach in June 1944. The King, Prime Minister Churchill and Free French leader General de Gaulle came to see the great D-Day preparations at Portland; activity in the harbour was continuous. After the war, Portland&#x27;s role in the liberation of Europe was marked by a ceremony in August 1945, when the American Ambassador John G. Winant unveiled a stone in Victoria Gardens commemorating the passing by the spot of 418,585 troops and 144,093 vehicles the previous June.

During both World Wars I and II, the bay was filled with neutral ships at anchor waiting to be searched for materials that might be useful to the enemy.

===Post-war role and closure of naval base (1946–1995)===
After the war, in 1946, ten Phoenix caissons of the Mulberry Harbour were towed back to Portland, eight of which were later given to the Netherlands to repair storm breaches in the dykes in 1953. The remaining two units now act as a wind-break, helping ships berth at Queen&#x27;s Pier in the harbour.

====HMS &quot;Osprey&quot;====
In 1946, the anti-submarine school returned to Portland, and re-established itself at East Weare. In 1948 the administrative command of HMS &quot;Osprey&quot; was extended to cover the Naval Base as a whole. (The depot had been designated HMS &quot;Boscawen&quot; from 1932 up until that point; previously Portland had been designated a sub-Depot of HMS &quot;Victory&quot; in Portsmouth.) The &#x27;Upper Osprey&#x27; site at East Weare was substantially rebuilt in the 1960s; subsequently much of it was given over to provide barracks accommodation for the base and its personnel.

====Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment====
HM A/S Experimental Establishment also returned to Portland in 1946. Over the next few years its headquarters on Balaclava Bay were rebuilt and extended, and it was again renamed as HM Underwater Detection Establishment (HMUDE).

At the same time, a new headquarters for the Admiralty Gunnery Establishment (AGE), which had transferred to Portland from Teddington, was built at Southwell between 1949 and 1952; it, however, transferred again in 1959 (to Portsdown Hill), allowing the building to be taken over by the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment (AUWE), formed from an amalgamation of different establishments from different parts of the UK involved in researching and developing underwater weapons and detection systems (including HMUDE, which nevertheless remained in its Balaclava Bay premises). The latter was renamed AUWE (North), to distinguish it from the new building, AUWE (South), at Southwell.

The AUWE later became infamous for espionage infiltration, known as the Portland spy ring.

====Portland Dockyard====
In February 1958 it was announced in Parliament by the First Lord of the Admiralty that Portland Dockyard was to close the following year (though the naval base would be retained). At the time, the Dockyard employed &#x27;some 1,600 industrial and non-industrial staff&#x27;. Within the same statement Sheerness Dockyard and a number of other naval establishments were also slated for closure.

====Flag Officer Sea Training====
As planned, Portland&#x27;s Royal Dockyard closed in 1959, but the Naval Base remained open &#x27;in support of the local establishments and H.M. ships using the harbour&#x27;. From 1958, the base&#x27;s main occupation was Flag Officer Sea Training, which was a major success, and the harbour soon became the world&#x27;s premier work-up and training base. Aside from the training of Royal Navy ships, many ships of NATO countries also trained and frequented at the harbour. Part of the Falklands War task force sailed from Portland in 1982. In 1984, two large accommodation blocks, totalling £25-30 million, were built in Castletown as barracks for Royal Navy personnel, along with a sports centre.

====RNAS Portland====
With the advent of the helicopter and its importance as an anti-submarine weapon, an airfield was formed following World War II. In 1946, Hoverfly R-4Bs began operating from the base&#x27;s playing fields, which were transformed into a landing ground. In 1959, RNAS Portland was officially established as part of &quot;HMS Osprey&quot;, further land having been reclaimed from the Mere the previous year to serve as a runway and landing area, and the old canteen building having been adapted to serve as a combined headquarters and control tower. It went on to become the largest naval helicopter airfield in Europe.

====Closure====
The Ministry of Defence continued to invest in HMNB Portland until the late 1980s; however in 1991 the closure was announced of both the naval base and the research establishments on Portland as part of defence spending cuts following the end of the Cold War. There was opposition against the closure from the local economy, as well as all ranks of naval personnel, who felt Portland&#x27;s surrounding coast was perfect for exercising ships.

Royal Navy operations ceased on 21 July 1995 and the harbour was sold on 29 March 1996. FOST was relocated to Devonport. Following this, RNAS Portland also closed in October 1999. The combined closure of all Portland-based establishments was believed to have cost the area 4,500 jobs, along with a loss of £40 million in the area&#x27;s economy, according to a study carried out for Weymouth and Portland Borough Council in 1995.

==Modern port==
Langham Industries bought the site from the Ministry of Defence in 1996.

, the harbour is the fourth largest human-made port in the world, after the Port of Jebel Ali in Dubai, Ras Laffan Harbour in Qatar and Cherbourg Harbour in France. The breakwaters lead to a restricted water exchange; this in turn leads to elevated water temperatures. Thus several marine species inhabit the harbour beyond the typical northern limits of their range. The harbour is designated as EU shellfish water and supports an important shellfish fishery and a marine ecosystem of high importance for biodiversity.

The harbour was sold off by the Royal Navy in 1996, allowing it to be used both as a centre for water sports and as a service facility for Channel shipping. Portland Port Ltd, formed in December 1994, took possession of the site immediately and their purchase was completed on 12 December 1996. The company aimed to develop the ship repair, leisure and tourism potential of the harbour. One of the first arrivals at the new set up was a prison ship HM Prison Weare, which remained in use until 2006. Renamed Jascon 27, the ship left Portland under tow in 2010, bound for Nigeria, to be refurbished for use as an oil industry accommodation vessel.

Portland Port Group became Statutory Harbour Authority for Portland Harbour on 1 January 1998, replacing the Queen&#x27;s Harbour Master. In 2004 changes led to Portland Harbour Authority Ltd becoming the Statutory and Competent Harbour Authority and Portland Port Ltd the Port Operator. The commercial port has expanded since its initial establishment; the Britannia Passenger Terminal was opened by HRH Prince Philip on 14 July 1999. In April 2000 the contract was signed for a new bunkering jetty and berth, which came into service in 2005. However, despite published reports in 1996 revealing that Portland Port Ltd were interested in the renovation of historic coastal fortifications in the area, no restoration of any kind has taken place.

Commercial activities on the water include specialist diving services for vessels and repairs and maintenance, as well as a bunkering (fuelling) station. The port is used by all kinds of vessels, from commercial ships such as bulkers, tankers, container carriers car carriers, survey and reefers etc. to British and foreign naval vessels. Commercial activities on the land of the dock estate include fuel storage, natural gas storage, several engineering facilities and a shellfish specialist.

The Portland Harbour Revision Order 2010 provides for the creation of new berths and hardstand areas at the port in order to allow increased commercial activities over the next 50 years. These new facilities have been identified as part of a master plan and business strategy developed by Portland Port. The development is designed to increase berthing opportunities and provide more operational land.

The four identified areas for development are:
*Britannia Terminal Area
*North of Coaling Pier Island
*Camber Quay Development
*Floating Dry Dock Development at Queen&#x27;s Pier

The port also sees various cruise ship calls bringing visitors to the Dorset area. The Britannia Cruise Terminal, which was opened in July 1999 and again refurbished in 2005, has seen the likes of Royal Caribbean, Azamara, Club Cruises, Saga and Crystal Cruises use it as a start point for excursions in the wider Dorset region and beyond. In recent years the number of cruise ship calls at the port have increased.

In September 2022, a project costing £26m for a deep-water berth upgrade was due to begin, intended to be completed by May 2023.

In April 2023, the Government of the United Kingdom announced highly controversial plans to moor the &quot;Bibby Stockholm&quot;, on charter from Bibby Marine, at the port to accommodate 500 asylum seekers.

==Recreation==
The harbour is a popular location for Kiteboarding, wind surfing, wreck diving and sailing. Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy which hosted sailing events in the 2012 Olympic Games, is located on the south-western shore of the harbour. The Royal Yachting Association had expressed interest in securing a suitable site locally for a number of decades, in order to make use of the harbour&#x27;s natural advantages. However the opportunity did not develop until the end of the 20th century, with the withdrawal of the Royal Navy. The academy was established as a not-for-profit company in 1999, and originally operated from various disused military buildings and facilities. In 2003 the academy was able to start redevelopment of the site. In 2005 WPNSA was selected to host the sailing events at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Additionally Osprey Quay became an 80 acres regeneration project commissioned by South West Regional Development Agency in 2001. By 2012 Osprey Quay had been transformed with huge investment, offering over 11 hectares, a total of 60,000 square metres of business space.

In October 2007 work commenced on a new marina and recreational boating facility. Some 250,000 tonnes of Portland stone was used in creating the 875m breakwater and associated reclaimed land. This facility was open by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in April 2009 and is situated directly adjacent to the National Sailing Academy. Apart from the usual freshwater, fuel, shore power and pump-out facilities the marina also has a bar/restaurant, 15 retail/business units and 5 larger commercial units.

In addition to , there are other dive wrecks around the harbour:

*on the inside of the harbour, against a breakwater:
**&quot;Countess of Erme&quot; – barge 30 metres north of the Eastern Ship Channel
**the Spaniard – barge 50 metres south-west of the Chequered Fort

==Listed buildings and structures==
The harbour and dockyard has various buildings and structures on the National Heritage List.

The inner breakwater, with its jetty, former victualling store and Inner Pierhead Fort, are Grade II Listed. The victualling store was built around 1850. At the south-west end of Prince Consort Walk is a carved commemorative stone for the completion of the breakwaters in 1872. The outer breakwater is also Grade II Listed.

East Weare Battery was built in the 1860s to protect the harbour. In addition to this, The &#x27;E&#x27; section of the battery is Grade II Listed and has become a scheduled monument too. East Weare Camp is Grade II Listed. One of the most dominant of the defence structures is the Portland Breakwater Fort, located on one of the outer breakwaters. It is Grade II Listed.

In 1993, the Dockyard Offices became Grade II Listed. At the end of Castletown village is the former Dockyard Police Station – also Grade II Listed. At the top of the Incline Road is the abandoned Old Engine Shed that once served the cable-operated inclined railway that ran to Castletown through the Navy Dockyard that is now Portland Port. The shed has been Grade II Listed since 2001.

==Breakwater defences==
Situated across Portland Harbour&#x27;s four breakwater arms are various defensive structures and related monuments. Many of these are still in existence today, however are derelict and remain unopened to the public. At the Breakwater Fort is a World War II 29 millimetre spigot mortar emplacement, a pillbox, and a battery observation post. Further along the same arm, towards Portland, are two World War II coast artillery searchlights.

On the northeast breakwater, at the southern end, directly opposite the fort, is the Portland Breakwater Lighthouse. The site was also the location of a coastal battery, known as A Pier Head Battery, which opened in 1901 and was armed with two 12-pounder quick-firing (QF) guns for anti-torpedo craft defence. In 1944 emplacements were constructed to replace the 12-pounder guns with 6-pounders. A World War I torpedo station was also located on &#x27;A&#x27; Head, using two 18 inch torpedo tubes which were operational from 1915 until 1918. It was put into operation again during World War II. During World War II a petroleum warfare site consisting of four flame throwers were located on &#x27;A&#x27; Head. A World War II battery observation post survives.

On the North Eastern Breakwater, within the centre area, is a World War II coastal battery with coast artillery searchlights. Further along the arm is a 29 millimetre spigot mortar emplacement. On the far end of the North Eastern Breakwater, on the Weymouth side, is the site of B Pier Head Battery. The coastal battery opened in 1901 and was armed with two 12-pounder quick-firing (QF) guns for anti-torpedo craft defence. By 1913 the battery&#x27;s armament included four 12-pounder guns and a 6-inch breech-loading (BL) Mk. VII gun. The battery was decommissioned in 1934. The same site featured a World War I torpedo station. Additionally there is a World War I battery observation post.

The Weymouth end breakwater features the C Pier Head Battery on the southern tip. The arm is known as the Bincleaves Groyne. The battery was opened in 1901 and was armed with two 12-pounder quick-firing (QF) guns for anti-torpedo craft defence. By the First World War the 12-pounder guns had been removed and replaced with a 6-inch breech-loading (BL) Mk. VII gun. The 6-inch gun was removed in 1924 and in 1934 two 12-pounder guns were transferred across from the recently decommissioned B Pier Head. In 1944 emplacements were constructed for two 6-pounder guns, but the guns were not mounted for a number of years. At the C Pier Head Battery a World War II petroleum warfare site was constructed. On site is a World War II 29 millimetre spigot mortar emplacement.

==On-shore defences==
Aside from the East Weare Battery, and other related constructions, there are a number of defences built within the harbour&#x27;s dockyard and surrounding area.

During World War II, a number of anti-invasion structures were placed at Balaclava Bay, including an anti boat landing obstacle, and a minefield. A little further south is a coast artillery searchlight. Another coast artillery searchlight was situated further south of this. A number of pillboxes were built around East Weare Battery.

As part of the defence for HMS Osprey, now demolished, a &quot;Yarnold Sanger&quot; pillbox is located on Incline Road, constructed during the Cold War. In addition to this a World War II pillbox, with a possible machine gun post, is located at Upper Osprey.

A Doctor of Divinity, Walker was joint Governor of Londonderry along with Henry Baker during the Siege of Derry in 1689, and received the thanks of the House of Commons for his work.
He was killed at the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690 (12 July New Style), whilst going to the aid of Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg, Commander-in-Chief of all Williamite forces in Ireland, who was wounded during the crossing of the river in the early part of the battle. He was originally buried at the battlefield but at the insistence of his widow, his body was later exhumed and buried inside the church at Castlecaufield, County Tyrone. His body was later rediscovered and re-interred next to that of his wife but not before a cast was taken of his skull.

The Walker Plinth on the derry city walls which was completed in 1828, remains in his memory; although the column that stood on the plinth was destroyed in an IRA bomb attack in 1973.

<doc id="524687" wikidata="Q1907851" url="?curid=524687" title="Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy">
<text>The master chief petty officer of the Navy (MCPON ) is a unique non-commissioned rank and position of office of the United States Navy, which is designated as a special paygrade above E-9. The holder of this position is the most senior enlisted member of the U.S. Navy, equivalent to the sergeant major of the Army, chief master sergeant of the Air Force, sergeant major of the Marine Corps, master chief petty officer of the Coast Guard, and chief master sergeant of the Space Force. The holder of this rank and position is the most senior enlisted sailor in the Navy, unless an enlisted sailor is serving as the senior enlisted advisor to the chairman. The current MCPON is James Honea.

The master chief petty officer of the Navy is appointed by the chief of naval operations to serve as a spokesperson to address the issues of enlisted personnel to the highest positions in the Navy. As such, they are the senior enlisted advisor to the chief of naval operations and to the chief of naval personnel. Their exact duties vary, depending on the CNO, though they generally devote much of their time to traveling throughout the Navy observing training and talking to sailors and their families. Their personnel code is N00D as the senior enlisted advisor to Chief of Naval Operations and PERS-00D in their special advisory capacity to Chief of Naval Personnel/Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Manpower, Personnel, and Training). In 1988, the MCPON&#x27;s spouse was made the Ombudsman-at-Large, authorizing them to travel around the fleet with their spouse, representing the interests of the spouses of enlisted members. The MCPON serves an appointed two-year term of office but can be reappointed by the CNO for an additional two-year term. Typically; the MCPON serves two terms. While the MCPON is a non-commissioned officer, this rank is protocoled higher than all rear admirals and equivalent to a vice admiral in billet, seating, transportation, and parking.

==Origin==
In 1966, the opportunity was given to sailors in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s two largest areas of concentration, Hampton Roads, Virginia, and San Diego County, California, to voice their concerns, complaints, and recommendations to the top levels of the U.S. Navy. The response was overwhelming; naval leaders realized that they were out of touch with the desires of enlisted sailors. To provide a permanent channel for input from the enlisted force to their senior leadership, the Navy acted on a suggestion to create a &quot;Leading Chief Petty Officer of the Navy&quot; who would have a direct dialogue channel with all enlisted sailors and represent their interests. Initially, the post was known as the senior enlisted advisor of the Navy, and on 13 January 1967 GMCM Delbert Black was selected to serve a four-year term in that capacity. On 28 April of the same year, Black&#x27;s title was changed to Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy to bring the Navy in line with the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army, which had created equivalent positions in 1957 and July 1966 respectively. MCPON Black&#x27;s duties were to the Chief of Naval Personnel. All subsequent MCPONs have reported to both the CNO and CNP.

==MCPON rate insignia==

During the MCPON&#x27;s tenure, a third silver star above the gold anchor is added onto the MCPON&#x27;s collar and cap devices, as well as a rating badge consisting of a perched eagle atop three inverted gold chevrons, one rocker, and three inverted gold stars above the eagle. The MCPON&#x27;s rating specialty mark is replaced by a single inverted gold star. The MCPON will also wear the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Badge on naval uniforms.

<doc id="524691" wikidata="Q846725" url="?curid=524691" title="University of Beira Interior">
<text>The University of Beira Interior (UBI; Portuguese: ) is a public university located in the city of Covilhã, Portugal. It was created in 1979, and has about 6,879 students distributed across a multiplicity of graduation courses, awarding all academic degrees in fields ranging from medicine, biochemistry, biomedical sciences and industrial design to aeronautical engineering, fashion design, mathematics, economics and philosophy. The university is named after the historical Beira region, meaning , the most interior area of Beira, mainly composed by the district of Guarda and the district of Castelo Branco, in today&#x27;s Centro region.

== History ==
In August 1973, following a major change in the national higher education system, the government established a polytechnical institution in Covilhã, the Polytechnic Institute of Covilhã (&quot;IPC - Instituto Politécnico da Covilhã&quot;), which was the first higher education institution in the city. Over the years, the IPC facilities, as well as the enrolment and staff, never ceased to grow. This growth and the region&#x27;s needs, led the IPC to a remarkable level of achievements that granted it, in 1979, to be promoted, by the Portuguese Ministry of Education, to a higher institutional level, university institute. Seven years later, in 1986, the University Institute of Beira Interior was granted full university status and renamed University of Beira Interior ().

The first rector was Professor Cândido Manuel Passos Morgado, from August 21, 1980 until January 19, 1996, then followed by Professor Manuel José dos Santos Silva who remained in office until June 19, 2009. On this date, the third Rector of the institution, Professor João António de Sampaio Rodrigues Queiroz, takes office, whose mandate ended on September 5, 2013. The fourth rector of the institution, who led it for two terms, was Professor António Carreto Fidalgo. The current rector of UBI is Professor Mário Lino Barata Raposo, who took office on June 8, 2021.

== Organisation ==
For teaching and research purposes, UBI is organised into five faculties. The faculties are organised in departments:

*The Faculty of Sciences includes the Department of Mathematics, Informatics, Physics, and Chemistry.
*The Faculty of Engineering Sciences includes the departments of Textile Science and Technology, Paper Science and Technology, Electromechanical Engineering, Architecture, Civil Engineering, and Aerospace Sciences.
*The Faculty of Human and Social Sciences is made up of the Department of Management and Economics, Department of Sociology, Department of Education Sciences and the Department of Sports Sciences.
*The Faculty of Arts and Letters includes the Department of Communication and Arts; and the Department of Letters
*The Faculty of Health Sciences includes the Department of Medical Sciences.

All departments of the university grant the undergraduate degree (licentiate&#x27;s degree or bachelor&#x27;s degree), which requires a three-year full-time study programme. UBI also awards postgraduate courses in the fields that are offered by its departments, granting the degrees of (master&#x27;s degree) and (PhD).

In order to supply its own needs and those of the local community itself, the university has also five centres: the Teaching and Learning Resources Centre (CREA); the Centre for Patrimonial Studies and Recovery (CEPP); the Computer Centre (CI); the Optics Centre (CO) and the Centre of Studies for Regional Development (CEDR) which establishes the interface between the university and the community providing consulting services to local institutions in the areas of regional development.

The Centro Hospitalar Universitário Cova da Beira (Cova da Beira University Hospital Center), with facilities in Covilhã and Fundão, is the teaching hospital of the University of Beira Interior. Hospitals of Castelo Branco and Guarda also collaborate with UBI&#x27;s Faculty of Health Sciences.

==UBI&#x27;s Role in European Universities==
University of Beira Interior (UBI) is one of the youngest public universities in Portugal and member of UNITA Consortium (Universitas Montium), one alliance of six european mountain universities, all romanic-speaking. This alliance is committed to promoting socioeconomic development in rural and cross-boarder áreas, with 165.000 students and 13.000 employees. The UNITA Consortium has six institutions of higher education of five countries:

*Università Degli Studi di Torino (UNITO) - Italy, 
*Universidade da Beira Interior (UBI) - Portugal, 
*Université de Pau et des Pays de L’Adour (UPPA) - France,
*Université Savoie Mont-Blanc (USMB) - France, 
*Universitatea de Vest din Timisoara (UVT) – Romania, 
*Universidade de Zaragoza (UNIZAR) - Spain.

The UNITA Consortium is based on the concepts of European identity, inter-comprehension, multiculturalism, and sustainability, and aims to develop a European Research Area focusing on three pillars: i) cultural heritage, ii) renewable energies, and iii) circular economy.

==Rankings==
In 2020, the University of Beira Interior (UBI) maintained the status of one of the best international academies founded less than 50 years ago. The Times Higher Education Young University Rankings 2020 (THE-YUR) placed UBI at 151–200, within a list that analyzed 414 institutions of higher education around the world. UBI repeated the rank of the previous ranking, although the competition is increasing. In 2019, 351 academies had been analyzed, 63 less than this year. The rise in the number of institutions, however, did not jeopardize the position of UBI among the elite of the youngest universities from 66 countries on five continents. When analyzing the performance of the Portuguese institutions included in THE-YUR, UBI is in the second best level reached by the eight national higher education institutions, with only one ahead of it. In the parameter &quot;Citations&quot; it is even the best Portuguese academy on the list, appearing in 3rd place in &quot;Internationalization&quot;. Compared to 2019, UBI improved its final score in four of the five major missions of universities, used for the construction of the study: &quot;Teaching&quot;, &quot;Research&quot;, &quot;Knowledge Transfer&quot; and &quot;Internationalization&quot;. To prepare the Times Higher Education Young University Rankings are used the same 13 performance indicators of the main rankings of THE, as the World University Ranking, in which UBI is also included. Universities are evaluated on their main missions - teaching, research, knowledge transfer and internationalization - to allow the most comprehensive and balanced comparisons possible. In THE-YUR the weighting elements are calibrated to reflect the missions of young universities, with less emphasis on reputation surveys and more on factors such as research productivity, staff-to-student ratios and doctoral training, among others.

== Rectoral team ==

The rector is elected by the General Council for a term of four years and is assisted by vice-rectors and pro-rectors in specific tasks.

* Rector: Mário Lino Raposo
* Vice-rectors: José Carlos Páscoa Marques (Internationalization and Interaction with Society); Helena Maria Baptista Alves (Teaching, academic affairs and employability); Joaquim Mateus Paulo Serra (Human Resources, Tenders and Academic Acts); Amélia Cavaca Augusto (Quality, Social Responsibility and Social Action); Silvia Cristina Marques Socorro (Research, Innovation and Development); Silvio José Simões Mariano (Heritage, Infrastructure and Sustainability)
* Pro-rectors: Anabela Rosário Leitão Dinis (Finance Area); Pedro Ricardo Morais Inácio (Digital University); João Carlos Gonçalves Lanzinha (Project Area)

== Enrolment and staff ==
Current figures show an enrolment of approximately 8997 students from all over the country plus 772 professors and lecturers.

Students coming from other European Union member-states and PALOP (&quot;&quot;) countries accounts for nearly 200.

== Teaching and learning methods ==
All courses are taught in Portuguese language, and the teaching process is undertaken using a mixture of theoretical and practical processes. Theoretical lessons are usually supported by:

* Theoretical/Practical lessons where the students guided by the teacher have the chance to discuss and resolve problems.
* Practical lessons, where the students are challenged to solve practical problems in laboratories, ateliers or computer facilities and able to apply the theoretical knowledge that they already understood and learned.

== Academic year ==
The academic year at UBI consists of two semesters. The first (autumn and winter semester) is 20 weeks long. It runs from mid-September to mid-February and includes classes, work assessment and examinations of students. The second (spring and summer semester) is 20 weeks long. It runs from mid -February to mid-July and includes classes, work assessment and examinations of students. Christmas holidays last two weeks, and Easter break is one week.

== University campus ==

Over the years, the UBI had a remarkable evolution and nowadays it is a modern university full of well-equipped laboratories, ateliers, libraries, computer rooms, research centres, and offering a wide range of activities through the students&#x27; union (&quot;Associação Académica da Universidade da Beira Interior&quot;) and university social services.

The university academic campus is well integrated in the city urban network and it has unique characteristics based on Covilhã industrial roots. The city was an important textile centre, once known as the &quot;Portuguese Manchester&quot;. By the turn of the 21st century, the city had witnessed a restructuring of this industry. However, at the same time many factories were not able to meet the requirements of the global market and had to close down. Some of their former buildings, after being renovated by the University of Beira Interior, started the 21st century serving the purpose of educating the Portuguese society.

Over 250,000 m2 of buildings are dedicated to academic activities and social services. The university campus is divided into several spaces, called , which are spread through the city establishing a real symbiosis between the city and the university as a public institution.

The synopsis below provides information about the of UBI and its libraries:
*Pólo I – The main building is a 17th-century textile factory that was renovated to house part of the university services, classrooms and offices. New buildings near have been erected over the years to keep up the continuous growth of the UBI. Due to a diligent renovation work this set of buildings are considered historical, cultural and architectonical outstanding pieces of industrial archaeology. Among this sector the following units are located: the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, the Faculty of Sciences, the Faculty of Engineering Sciences, the Wool Museum, the Computer Centre, the Optics Centre, the São Martinho Chapel, the Main Library, the Bank, the Teaching and Learning Resources Centre (Multimedia Centre) and the Centre For Heritage Studies and Recovery.
*Pólo II – On a hill, less than 1 km from Pólo I, and meeting the UBI need for constant expansion, an area was created where several central infrastructures, as the emblematic 16th century convent that nowadays houses the Rectory, the administration services and the international relations office. In the same area are also located the academic residences, Santo Antonio cafeteria, the sport halls, the social affairs centre and the centre of studies for regional development. The Department of Sports and Science is also located nearby.
*Pólo III – This is where the Faculty of Health Sciences is located. It has a total area of 16,000 m2 situated nearby the Central Hospital in a distance of 1 km far from Pólo I.
*Pólo IV – This area is located in northern part of the city and was created to facilitate the expansion of the university. It houses the Faculty of Human and Social Sciences, the Cyber Centre and a residence hall with Snack Bar.
*Libraries – UBI has three libraries. The Main Library is located in Pólo I following the aim of meeting the students&#x27; needs. All libraries of UBI have an information desk where one can obtain information and help. Once the Library Card is issued, students can use it to borrow books from any library. The Main Library offers a wide range of services spread among 3 different floors. Textbooks and course materials, scientific publications, bibliographies and reference works in all subjects taught at the university are available. Among other services, students can use the individual study and reading rooms, Inter-Library loan service, photocopy services, scanners, CD-ROM, Videos, DVD or consult the Library Database and Internet (200 computers).

== UBI residence halls ==
The UBI maintains seven residence halls. One of the residence halls is located in &quot;Pólo II&quot;, 5 minutes of walking distance from the university&#x27;s main buildings (&quot;Pólo I&quot;) and the other (&quot;Residência Pedro Álvares Cabral&quot;) is located near the &quot;Pólo IV&quot;. All the rooms are equipped with closets, desks, chairs, beds and central heating. One or two students are assigned to each room. The Students&#x27; Social Affairs Centre manages all the university housing offers.

== Students&#x27; union ==
The students&#x27; union, &quot;AAUBI – Associação Académica da Universidade da Beira Interior,&quot; is headquartered within the old part of the town, near Santa Maria church. The union also has its office in &quot;Pólo I&quot;, two floors upstairs from the bank.

The students&#x27; union (AAUBI) offers a wide range of activities concerning sports, culture and leisure. During the whole year there are many indoor events such like chess meetings or activities in sports halls as climbing, volleyball, basketball, football, badminton and table tennis.

A freshman reception week, organised by the students&#x27; union of the University of Beira Interior, takes place in November and includes a parade through town (the ) and several concerts.

== Online radio, television and journal ==
The university has an online radio, &quot;Rádio Universitária da Beira Interior&quot;, an online television, &quot;Televisão Universitária da Beira Interior&quot;, and an online journal, &quot;Urbi et Orbi&quot;.

== Athletics ==
The University of Beira Interior has two indoor sports pavilions, among other sports facilities. Competitive varsity sports teams of UBI include badminton, basketball, futsal, handball, rugby union and volleyball.

== Wool museum ==

The UBI adapted the buildings of the former (Royal Textile Factory), an important national woollens manufacturer established by Marquês de Pombal in 1764. This building served as a spinning, dyeing and weaving mill until 1885, when it was handed over to lodge the (21st Infantry Regiment), and later the (2nd Sharpshooters Battalion).

In 1975, during the recovery and adaptation works of the building, archaeological remains of the old textile mill were discovered. The vats of the former dye-house were found. The discovery was classified as a part of the national cultural heritage and it was carefully recovered and restored. According to the museum&#x27;s educational role, the discovered structures are helping to portray the dyeing processes used in Portugal in the second half of the 18th century.

Guided tours are available (free for UBI students). The museum is open on weekdays except Monday, from 09:30 to midday and from 14:30 to 18:00.

<text>The Black Brant is a family of Canadian-designed sounding rockets originally built by Bristol Aerospace, since absorbed by Magellan Aerospace in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Over 800 Black Brants of various versions have been launched since they were first produced in 1961, and the type remains one of the most popular sounding rockets. They have been repeatedly used by the Canadian Space Agency and NASA.

==History==
Black Brant was the result of research at Canadian Armament Research and Development Establishment (CARDE) during the 1950s into the nature of the upper part of the atmosphere as part of ongoing research into anti-ballistic missile systems and very-long-range communication. In 1957 CARDE contracted Bristol to produce a simple rocket fuselage, called the Propulsion Test Vehicle, for studies into high-power solid fuels. The resulting design, by Albert Fia, was quite heavy, as it was designed to be able to accommodate a wide variety of engine burning times, propellant loadings and launch angles in keeping with its role as a test vehicle for ABM systems development. The first test flight took place only two years later from the Churchill Rocket Research Range in September 1959.

CARDE&#x27;s attention later turned to long-distance communications and they found the &quot;Propulsion Test Vehicle&quot; system useful as a sounding rocket. To better suit this role, Bristol modified the design to be lighter and more tailored to the sounding rocket role. This became the Black Brant. CARDE launched a number of Black Brant rockets over the next few years, both the original &quot;Black Brant I&quot; design which could place a payload to altitude, as well as the larger &#x27; which first flew in October 1960, and the smaller but higher-altitude &#x27;.

The rocket&#x27;s design emphasized reliability over payload and range. In July 1963 the much larger &#x27; first flew, which was also used as a booster stage for the &#x27; to make the &quot;&quot;. The IV first flew in 1964, but failed, as did the next test launch. Aside from these two launches, which were corrected for, the has never had another failure, making it one of the most reliable rockets in history. Since then it has undergone continual evolution, and the current versions are the XI and XII, consisting of used as an upper stage, with Talos and Terrier boosters as lower stages. They have reached altitudes of more than , which is above the ionosphere and well above the orbits of the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.

The propellant designs developed by CARDE in the program were the highest performing solid fuels of their day. Bristol then placed this propellant in a new rocket to form the CRV7, the first rocket capable of penetrating standard Warsaw Pact aircraft hangars. The CRV7 has since gone on to become the de facto standard rocket for most Western-aligned militaries.

In 1976, Australia and Canada through the National Research Council Canada (NRCC) agreed to launch a rocket from Woomera Test Range. The rocket was launched there on 9 November for experiments in the ionosphere. Later, NASA would launch a number of .

At present, due to its 98% success rate, it remains one of the most popular sounding rockets ever built. The rockets have been used repeatedly by the Canadian Space Agency and NASA. There is a 1:1 scale model of the rocket in front of the head office of the Canadian Space Agency in Saint-Hubert, east of Montréal. A full-scale is on display in the Science Gallery of The Manitoba Museum in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

In 1995, a Black Brant XII four-stage sounding rocket from the Andøya Rocket Range off the northwestern coast of Norway caused the Norwegian rocket incident, also known as the Black Brant scare. The trajectory resembled that of a U.S. Navy submarine-launched Trident missile. Russian nuclear forces were put on high alert as a result, fearing a high-altitude nuclear attack that could blind Russian radar, and Russia&#x27;s &quot;nuclear briefcase&quot;, the Cheget, was brought to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who then had to decide whether to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike against the United States. It is the first and thus far only known incident where any nuclear-weapons state had its nuclear briefcase activated and prepared for launching an attack.

On September 19, 2009, a Black Brant XII that was launched to study clouds caused numerous calls from the northeastern U.S. reporting &quot;strange lights in the sky&quot;. NASA reported that the light came from an artificial noctilucent cloud formed by the exhaust particles of the rocket&#x27;s fourth stage at an altitude of about .

<doc id="524726" wikidata="Q221743" url="?curid=524726" title="HMS Hood (1891)">
<text>HMS &quot;Hood&quot; was a modified pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Royal Navy in the early 1890s. She differed from the other ships of the class in that she had cylindrical gun turrets instead of barbettes and a lower freeboard. She served most of her active career in the Mediterranean Sea, where her low freeboard was less of a disadvantage. The ship was placed in reserve in 1907 and later became the receiving ship at Queenstown, Ireland. &quot;Hood&quot; was used in the development of anti-torpedo bulges in 1913 and was scuttled in late 1914 to act as a blockship across the southern entrance of Portland Harbour after the start of World War I.

&quot;Hood&quot;, the last of the eight &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;-class battleships to be built, differed significantly from the other ships of her class in that she had a forward freeboard of only compared to of the other ships. The &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;s had reverted to a higher freeboard after several classes of low-freeboard vessel had been constructed, the last being the . Low freeboard had been popular for around ten years since it required less armour and made a smaller target for gunfire to hit, although it had the disadvantage that it reduced seaworthiness. This low freeboard meant that &quot;Hood&quot; was very wet in rough weather and her maximum speed reduced rapidly as the wave height increased, making her only suitable for service in the relatively calm Mediterranean. This was seen as a vindication of the barbette/high-freeboard design in the rest of her class, and all subsequent British battleship classes had high freeboard.
The lower freeboard was required by her use of armoured gun turrets—a heavy type of rotating gun mounting of the mid-and-late 19th century very different from what would later be known as &quot;turrets&quot;. &quot;Hood&quot;″s half-sisters mounted their guns exposed on top of barbettes, a much lighter arrangement that allowed their freeboard to be substantially increased. The heavy, old-fashioned type of turrets added to the amount of weight high up in the ship compared to barbettes and decreased the ship&#x27;s stability.

Because the stability of a ship is largely due to freeboard at high rolling angles, she was given a larger metacentric height (the vertical distance between the metacenter and the centre of gravity below it) of around instead of the of the rest of the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;s to make her roll less in rough seas. This had the effect of making her roll period shorter by around 7% compared to her sisters, which in turn made her gunnery less accurate. Bilge keels were fitted in 1894 which improved her manoeuvrability.

===General characteristics===
&quot;Hood&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at normal load and at deep load. Her crew numbered 690 officers and ratings.

The ship was powered by two 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller. Eight water-tube boilers provided steam to the engines, which produced a maximum of when forced. This was intended to allow them to reach a speed of . She carried a maximum of of coal, enough to steam at .

===Armament===
The ship was armed with four 32-calibre BL 13.5-inch Mk I–IV guns in two twin gun turrets, one fore and aft of the superstructure. Each gun was provided with 80 shells. &quot;Hood&quot;″s secondary armament consisted of ten 40-calibre 6-inch Mk I-III guns mounted in casemates in the superstructure. A major problem with the four of these guns mounted on the upper deck was that they were mounted low in the ship and were unusable at high speed or in heavy weather. They were removed in 1904. The ship carried 200 rounds for each gun.

Defence against torpedo boats was provided by eight QF 6-pounder guns, although the exact type of gun is not known. Four of these were mounted on the main deck in casemates on the sides of the hull and suffered from the same problems as the six-inch guns. &quot;Hood&quot; also mounted a dozen QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns mounted in the superstructure and fighting tops. Like her sisters, the ship was fitted with seven 18-inch torpedo tubes. Two of these were mounted in the bow below the waterline, four were placed in the sides of the hull, two on each broadside, and one in the stern. These last five tubes were all above water. She also was fitted with a plough-shaped underwater ram.

In 1897 one of these 3-pounder guns was mounted on each turret top and, three years later, the 3-pounders in the fighting tops were transferred to the forward superstructure. At the same time the above-water torpedo tubes were removed. About 1902–03 the 6-pounders on the main deck were removed; two were remounted on the superstructure, but the other two were not replaced. In 1905 the 3-pounders on the forward superstructure were removed while the 3-pounders in the lower fighting tops were removed while the ship was in reserve from 1907–09.

===Armour===
&quot;Hood&quot;″s protection used both compound armour and nickel steel armour. Her waterline main belt ranged in thickness between thick. It covered the middle of the ship and was high of which was below the waterline at normal load. Fore and aft bulkheads, thick respectively, closed off the ends of the central citadel at the level of the waterline. The upper strake of armour was long and protected the ship&#x27;s side between the barbette Oblique bulkheads thick connected this strake to the armour protecting the bases of the turrets. The gun turrets and their bases were protected by of armour that thinned to behind the oblique bulkheads. Below the armoured deck their armour was reduced to . The armour of the main-deck casemates was 6 inches thick and that of the forward conning tower was 14 inches thick. The armoured deck was 3 inches thick over the machinery, but thinned to outside the central citadel and ran to the ends of the ship. At the bow it dipped down to reinforce the ship&#x27;s ram.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Hood&quot; was laid down at Chatham Dockyard on 12 August 1889 and was launched on 30 July 1891, the Viscountess Hood christening her. She finished her sea trials in May 1893 and was commissioned on 1 June 1893 at the cost of £926,396. Her assignment to the Mediterranean Fleet was delayed when she sprang a leak in her forward compartments on 7 June 1893 as a result of faulty riveting and excessive strain on the hull when she had been docked. Repairs took only two days, and the ship left Sheerness for the Mediterranean on 18 June 1893. She arrived at Malta on 3 July 1893, relieving the battleship .

In May 1896, &quot;Hood&quot; steamed from Malta to Crete to protect British interests and subjects there during unrest among Cretan Greeks who opposed the Ottoman Empire′s rule of the island. In 1897 and 1898, the ship served as part of the International Squadron, a multinational force made up of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, French Navy, Imperial German Navy, Italian Royal Navy (&quot;Regia Marina&quot;), Imperial Russian Navy, and Royal Navy that intervened in the 1897-1898 Greek uprising on Crete. The squadron, which formed in February 1897, bombarded insurgent forces, put sailors and marines ashore to occupy key cities, and blockaded Crete and key ports in Greece, actions which brought organized fighting on the island to an end by late March 1897. Thereafter, the squadron maintained order on Crete until the island&#x27;s status finally was resolved by the evacuation of all Ottoman Army forces from Crete in November 1898 and the establishment of an autonomous Cretan State under Ottoman suzerainty in December 1898.

Captain Alvin Coote Corry was appointed in command of &quot;Hood&quot; in December 1898. She was ordered to return home in March 1900 and paid off into reserve at Chatham Dockyard on 29 April 1900. Seven months later, on 12 December 1900, &quot;Hood&quot; recommissioned to relieve the elderly ironclad as port guard ship at Pembroke Dock.
The ship rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1901, and Captain Robert Lowry was appointed in command on 1 May 1902. She participated in combined exercises with the Channel Squadron and the Cruiser Squadron off the coasts of Cephalonia and Morea in late 1902. Two days before the exercises ended, &quot;Hood&quot; damaged her rudder on the seabed while leaving Argostoli Harbor on 4 October 1902. She went first to Malta for temporary repairs, then on to England for permanent repairs at Chatham Dockyard, using her twin screws to steer for the entire voyage. The repairs began after she paid off on 5 December 1902 and she transferred to Devonport for a refit upon their completion.

On 25 June 1903 &quot;Hood&quot; relieved the battleship in the Home Fleet. She took part in combined exercises of the Channel Fleet, Mediterranean Fleet, and Home Fleet off the coast of Portugal from 5 to 9 August 1903. The battleship relieved &quot;Hood&quot; on 28 September 1904. &quot;Hood&quot; was placed into reserve at Devonport on 3 January 1905, where she remained until February 1907. In April 1909, the ship was refitted and partially stripped at Devonport, after which she began service as a receiving ship at Queenstown, Ireland. In September 1910 &quot;Hood&quot; recommissioned to serve as flagship of the Senior Naval Officer, Coast of Ireland Station, while continuing as a receiving ship. On 2 April 1911 the ship was in Cork Harbour for the 1911 Census.

Later in 1911, &quot;Hood&quot; was towed to Portsmouth and listed for disposal. During 1913 and 1914 she was employed as a target for underwater protection experiments and was used in secret tests of anti-torpedo bulges. Subsequently, she was photographed in dry dock at Portsmouth by the crew of Naval Airship No. 18 in June 1914, before being placed on the sale list in August 1914. On 4 November 1914 &quot;Hood&quot; was scuttled in Portland harbour to block the Southern Ship Channel, a potential access route for U-boats or for torpedoes fired from outside the harbour. Her wreck became known as &quot;Old Hole in the Wall&quot;. Despite her 1914 scuttling, the Royal Navy included &quot;Hood&quot; on its sale list in both 1916 and 1917.

The ship&#x27;s bell was later used as one of at least two bells on the battlecruiser . Before being installed on the battlecruiser, the bell was inscribed around the base with the words: &quot;This bell was preserved from HMS Hood battleship 1891–1914 by the late rear admiral, The Honourable Sir Horace Hood KCB, DSO, MVO killed at Jutland on 31st May 1916.&quot;

The party has its origins in the pre-Canadian confederation Conservative Party that opposed the granting of responsible government to the colony. It has historically followed the Red Tory tradition. From the 2010s, the party underwent a shift to Blue Toryism after the election of Blaine Higgs as leader, who was premier from 2018 to 2024.

==History==

Initially, Conservative supporters tended to be United Empire Loyalists and supporters of the business community. In the 1860s, the Conservative and Liberal parties split over the issue of Canadian confederation and were replaced by the Confederation Party and the Anti-Confederation Party. By 1870, the pro-Confederation party became generally known as the Liberal-Conservatives or just “Conservatives,&quot; and were aligned with the national Conservative Party of Sir John A. Macdonald.

The party was aligned with the historic federal Conservative party. When the federal party changed its name to the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 1942, the New Brunswick party did the same. The federal Progressive Conservative Party dissolved in 2003, to merge with the Canadian Alliance and a new Conservative Party of Canada was created. The provincial party has no formal link with the current federal Conservative Party, but several of its members and elected MLAs, including former premier Premier Lord, publicly endorsed the federal party and in some cases its candidates in the 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2015 federal elections.

Following the change of government in 2006 provincial election, Bernard Lord resigned as leader on December 13, 2006, and as the member of Moncton East. On December 19, Jeannot Volpé, MLA for Madawaska les Lacs-Edmundston, was selected as interim leader. On October 18, 2008, David Alward, MLA for Carleton, was elected leader of the party at the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick Leadership Convention in Fredericton. Alward beat his only opponent, Robert MacLeod, by a margin of 2,269 votes to 1,760.

The Progressive Conservatives won a sweeping majority, with 42 of 55 seats in the 2010 provincial election. In doing so, PC party leader David Alward became the 32nd premier of New Brunswick.

In 2013, Saint John area MLA Dr. Jim Parrott, a retired heart surgeon and former head of the New Brunswick Heart Centre, was kicked out of the caucus after criticizing his government over health issues.

The controversial backbencher had spoken out about bilingualism and duality, and written a newspaper commentary about a lack of consultation with physicians. Before the 2014 election, he was allowed to return

Alward&#x27;s government was defeated after one term in the 2014 provincial election, after which Alward announced his resignation as party leader. On October 18, 2014, Bruce Fitch was selected as interim leader of the party and Leader of the Opposition of New Brunswick.

===2016–2023===
Quispamsis MLA Blaine Higgs was elected leader of the Progressive Conservative Party on October 22, 2016, defeating former Saint John Mayor Mel Norton, 1,563 to 1,169 on the third ballot.

In the 2018 provincial election, Higgs and the PCs won the largest share of seats in the legislature, 22, compared to 21 for the governing Liberal Party of New Brunswick, which opted to attempt to remain in power as a minority government by presenting a Throne Speech in hopes of retaining the confidence of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick.

On November 2, 2018, the Progressive Conservatives and the People&#x27;s Alliance combined to defeat Premier Brian Gallant&#x27;s Liberal minority government via a non-confidence vote in the legislature.

Higgs was appointed premier on November 9, 2018. Higgs and the Progressive Conservatives were re-elected to a majority government in the 2020 provincial election held on September 14, 2020,

On March 30, 2022, Kris Austin and Michelle Conroy announced their departure from the People&#x27;s Alliance of New Brunswick to join the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick.

===Internal division (2023–2024)===

Throughout 2023 and 2024, the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick saw itself at a crossroads, with multiple PCNB cabinet ministers and MLAs breaking ranks with the party, with some politicians citing a misalignment with their own views and that of the social conservatism the party being described as exhibiting.

In April 2023, the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, led by minister Bill Hogan and premier Higgs, placed Policy 713, an educational policy setting minimum requirements for public schools and districts in the province related to individuals identifying and perceived as LGBTQ, under review, later releasing a revised version in June 2023.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC-10/26/2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The situation led to widespread criticism and internal division within the PC-led government. Shortly following the revision, long-standing cabinet ministers Dorothy Shephard and Trevor Holder. Two additional cabinet ministers, Daniel Allain and Jeff Carr, expressed their “extreme disappointment in a lack of process and transparency” in a jointly signed letter following the revision. On June 15, 2023, all four of these ministers voted with the opposition parties which favoured a Liberal motion opposing the policy revision and called for increased consultation on the policy,&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC-Ministers-6/27/2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; leading to Higgs later dismissing both Allain and Carr from their respective cabinet positions, citing a breach of cabinet solidarity due to their support for the opposition motion on the policy.

Throughout early 2024, multiple PC MLAs and/or cabinet ministers, such as Arlene Dunn, Mike Holland, Carr, Allain, Shephard as well as Holder have all made announcements either resigning or opting out of running for re-election. In April 2024, cabinet minister Gary Crossman, who previously announced that he would be retiring after his term, also announced his resigning from the Legislative Assembly. 

The party was defeated by the Liberal&#x27;s in the 2024 New Brunswick general election, with Higgs losing his own seat and resigning as leader.

==Ideology and electoral base==
The Tories have alternated power with the New Brunswick Liberal Association since Confederation. The party tends to hold a moderate Red Tory stance, being socially and fiscally centrist.

For most of New Brunswick&#x27;s history, the party had greater support among English speakers, while the Liberals were more popular among Acadians. However, initiatives by the governments of Richard Hatfield and Bernard Lord to include Acadians in the mainstream of New Brunswick life helped the party make inroads in Acadia. In fact, even though he was born in Quebec, former premier Bernard Lord is widely perceived to be an Acadian, due to his Francophone heritage and the fact that he was raised in Moncton where he attended French language schools and university.

<text>Steven Ralph Schirripa ( ; born September 3, 1957) is an American actor. He is best known for portraying Bobby Bacala on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, Leo Boykewich on &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot;, and Detective Anthony Abetemarco on &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;. Schirripa is host of two Investigation Discovery series: &quot;Karma&#x27;s A B*tch!&quot; and &quot;Nothing Personal&quot;. He is the voice of Roberto in the &quot;Open Season&quot; film series.

== Early life ==
Schirripa was born on September 3, 1957 in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. His father, Ralph Schirripa, was Italian-American. His grandparents, Ilario Schirripa and Maria Capacci, were from Riace, Calabria, Southern Italy. His mother, Lorraine Schirripa (née Bernstein), was of Jewish descent. Schirripa grew up in a low-income household with four siblings, went to Lafayette High School and graduated from Brooklyn College.

== Career ==
=== Film and television ===
Schirripa got his first taste of show business in his job as entertainment director of the Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. In the biography page of his website, Schirripa says that he had cameo appearances in comedy specials by Drew Carey and Kevin Pollak, among other comedians. That led to a role as an uncredited extra in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Casino&quot;. In the film, he portrayed a customer at the bar in the scene when Joe Pesci&#x27;s character angrily stabs a man with a pen. After this, Schirripa decided that he wanted to become an actor.

He had several minor roles in films, including &quot;The Runner&quot; (1999) and &quot;Joe Dirt&quot; (2001). His breakthrough role was in the second season (2000) of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, playing Tony Soprano&#x27;s mobster brother-in-law Bobby Baccalieri. By chance, he was in New York City in June 1999 for a friend&#x27;s wedding, and around that time he was invited for an audition in New York City, initially for Agent Skip Lipari, and later for the role of Baccalieri. He played Baccalieri for five seasons, and for the first two seasons he wore a fat suit to fit the role.

His many television appearances include &quot;Angel,&quot; &quot;Casino Cinema&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Joey&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;, &quot;Ed&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, &quot;George Lopez&quot;, &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot; and &quot;The King of Queens&quot;. In 2008, Schirripa appeared on CBS&#x27;s primetime game show &quot;Million Dollar Password&quot;, and in 2019, Schirripa appeared on the game show &quot;Pyramid&quot; alongside Jamie-Lynn Sigler. He also made an uncredited appearance along with fellow Soprano star Vincent Pastore on a sixth season episode of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; entitled &quot;She Creature&quot;.

Schirripa was a frequent guest on the Don Imus radio program. In February 2007, he began to make appearances for &quot;Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&quot;, on Spike TV, siding with Team 3D as their cousin in their ongoing battle against The Latin American Xchange. On October 30, 2007, he appeared on, &quot;The Podge and Rodge Show&quot;. He also did spots as &quot;Steve the Judgmental Bastard&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Jay Leno, and taped several episodes of &quot;The Gong Show with Dave Attell,&quot; as one of the celebrity judges.

From 2008 to 2012, Schirripa had a recurring role in the ABC Family show, &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot;, as Leo Boykewich, Ben&#x27;s dad.

In 2009, he made a cameo appearance alongside fellow &quot;Sopranos&quot; actor Frank Vincent in &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; episode &quot;Vegas&quot;. He was also in 2009&#x27;s &quot;My Fake Fiancé&quot; with Melissa Joan Hart and Joey Lawrence as the Monkey.

He has appeared on the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; more than 40 times as a guest and as a correspondent. Schirripa hosted NBC&#x27;s poker game show, &quot;Face the Ace&quot;, with the premiere episode airing on August 1, 2009. In the fall of 2010, Schirripa had a guest star role in the digital comedy short film, &quot;Lil DPC&quot;, from writer/director Michael Ratner, which also features rapper Fat Joe and Blink 182&#x27;s Mark Hoppus.

In 2011 and 2012, Schirripa hosted and narrated the television true-crime series &quot;Nothing Personal&quot;, which premiered in the US on Investigation Discovery and in the UK on History. The series featured an often humorous take on true stories and reenactments of murders-for-hire. In addition to hosting the hour-long programs, Schirripa was one of the program&#x27;s executive producers. Subsequently, Schirripa hosted &quot;Karma&#x27;s a B*tch!&quot;, also for Investigation Discovery.

He has also guest-starred in the American version of &quot;Top Gear&quot;. Schirripa played Sonny Rosselli in &quot;A Poet Long Ago&quot;, a short film written by Pete Hamill and directed by Bob Giraldi, which gained entry into a number of film festivals in 2013.

In 2014, Schirripa played Joey on the ABC series &quot;Black Box&quot;, did voice acting in an episode of &quot;American Dad!&quot; entitled &quot;Stan Goes on the Pill&quot;, and played Vito in the silver screen adaptation &quot;Jersey Boys&quot;, directed by Clint Eastwood. He will play Father Ed in &quot;Chasing Yesterday&quot;, a film by writer/director Joseph Pernice, as well as appear in the film &quot;Houses&quot; by writer/director Jenner Furst, alongside &quot;Sopranos&quot; co-stars Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia.

Starting in 2015, Schirripa has played Det. Anthony Abetemarco, an investigator who works with assistant district attorney Erin Reagan on the CBS series &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;.

In July 2017, Schirripa appeared in a segment on John Oliver&#x27;s satirical news show &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; satirizing Boris Epshteyn and the right-wing tone of mandatory segments given to member stations by the Sinclair Broadcast Group.

Schirripa co-hosted a podcast with Michael Imperioli called &quot;Talking Sopranos&quot;, which began on April 6, 2020. The two provide inside info as they follow &quot;The Sopranos&quot; series episode by episode. By September 2020, the podcast had reached over five million downloads. On September 17, 2020, Imperioli and Schirripa signed a deal with HarperCollins book imprint William Morrow and Company to write an oral history of the show; the book titled &quot;Woke Up This Morning: The Definitive Oral History of The Sopranos&quot; was released on November 2, 2021.

=== Books ===
Schirripa&#x27;s acting roles often portrayed &quot;goombas,&quot; slang for stereotypical Italian-American tough guys and often denoting connections to the Mafia. He carried that persona over into real life but with a comedic twist, especially in appearances on talk and game shows. He expanded on that persona when he wrote a series of books starting with &quot;A Goomba&#x27;s Guide to Life&quot; () in 2002. He followed up with &quot;The Goomba&#x27;s Book of Love,&quot; co-authored with Charles Fleming in 2003 (). The series continued with &quot;The Goomba Diet: Large and Loving It&quot; () in 2006, and in 2013 &quot;Big Daddy&#x27;s Rules: Raising Daughters Is Tougher Than I Look&quot; (), co-authored by Philip Lerman.

Schirripa and Fleming also collaborated on two books about Nicky Deuce, a suburban teenager who is sent to visit his grandparents in Brooklyn. &quot;Nicky Deuce: Welcome to the Family&quot; was followed by &quot;Nicky Deuce: Home for the Holidays,&quot; which was the basis for the 2013 Nickelodeon film &quot;Nicky Deuce&quot; starring Noah Munck. &quot;Nicky Deuce&quot; also featured supporting roles filled by James Gandolfini, Michael Imperioli, Tony Sirico, and Vincent Curatola of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; fame.

=== Theatre ===
On April 3, 2014, Schirripa gave a theatrical performance in a special production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; alongside Nathan Lane, Patrick Wilson, and Megan Mullally at Carnegie Hall.

=== Uncle Steve&#x27;s Italian Specialties ===
In 2014, Schirripa launched a line of organic vegan pasta sauces under the business name of Uncle Steve&#x27;s Italian Specialties Group. Schirripa appeared on the &quot;Eric Andre Show&quot; to promote the sauce.

== Personal life ==
Schirripa married Laura Lemos on April 22, 1989. They have two children, daughters Bria and Ciara.

When asked if he was bar mitzvahed, Schirripa answered no and stated that he was raised as a Catholic but that he &quot;very much identifies as being Jewish as well&quot;.

<text>Lancair International, Inc. (pronounced &quot;lance-air&quot;) is a U.S. manufacturer of general aviation aircraft kits. They are well known for their series of high-performance single-engine aircraft that offer cruise speeds that surpass many twin-engine turboprop designs. Along with the Glasair series, the early Lancair designs were among the first kitplanes to bring modern molded composites construction to light aircraft.

In early 2017 the company, including all the older aircraft designs, was sold and moved from Redmond, Oregon to Uvalde, Texas under the name Lancair International, LLC. The newest model, the Lancair Evolution, was retained by the existing company, Lancair International, Inc, which changed its name to the Evolution Aircraft Company.

==History==

===Introduction===
The company was founded by Lance Neibauer in 1981 as a producer of composite homebuilt aircraft kits. Neibauer had been introduced to aviation by his uncle Ray Betzoldt, who had collaborated with Al Meyers to build the Meyers 200. Whenever he visited his aunt and uncle, he always took a ride in the Meyers. Hooked, he went looking for an aircraft twenty years later and found nothing that he liked, and decided to join the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) and design his own.

Neibauer began working on the new design after asking every builder he could find what features they were seeking in a homebuilt design. Looking to improve performance with the latest possible features, he selected the new NASA NLF 0215-F airfoil designed by Dan Somers at Langley. The NLF, short for &quot;Natural Laminar Flow&quot;, is a series of designs that replaced the older GAW series with more forgiving laminar flow characteristics. By 1983 the aircraft&#x27;s basic parameters were fixed, and Neibauer rented a shop in Santa Paula, California and started work on the design.

Intending to introduce aircraft at Oshkosh in 1984, a minor fuel leak in the wing tanks forced them to miss the show so they could fix the problem. A modified version of the prototype, with re-shaped cowling and some changes to the wing profile, emerged as the Lancer 200 in December 1984. Equipped with a 100 hp Continental O-200 engine, the Lancer easily outflew anything powered by the same engine and generated intense interest at Oshkosh &#x27;85. However, a naming conflict forced the design to be re-christened, finally going on sale in 1985 as the Lancair 200.

The 200 was quickly replaced by the Lancair 235, equipped with the slightly more powerful Lycoming O-235. Re-engined versions quickly followed; the Lancair 320 with the 150 hp Lycoming O-320, and the Lancair 360 with the 180 hp Lycoming O-360. A new tail was introduced for the later models in order to address stability problems at low speeds with the larger engines.

The Lancair designs provided the highest performance in the single-engine GA class, and as the kit-build market was dominated by pilots looking to outperform existing &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; designs, the Lancair&#x27;s kits sold well. By the end of 1990 they had sold over 600 kits for the various two-seat models, giving them what Neibauer claimed was 30% of the kit-built market.

A Lancair 320 appeared in a 1995 exhibit at the New York Museum of Modern Art.

===New models===
Starting in 1990, Neibauer turned his attention to a four-seat design that would retain the qualities of the earlier two-seaters. These efforts culminated in the Lancair IV, a four-seat optionally pressurized (IV-P) single-engine aircraft with a high cruise speed. The IV broke the speed record for planes in its class in February 1991 when it averaged 360.3 mph between San Francisco and Denver.

Already stretching the limits of their existing facilities, the company started looking for a new factory and after examining 200 potential sites they moved to Roberts Field in Redmond, Oregon in 1992. The company became Lancair International with the move. As of August 1998, according to &quot;Flight International&quot;, Lancair had sold 1,400 kits, 300 of them the Lancair IV model. Soon after the IV was introduced, Neibauer started work on a simpler fixed-gear version that emerged as the Lancair ES.

===Columbia Aircraft===
Lancair&#x27;s designs were prominent in the homebuilt market, and in 1994 NASA and others encouraged Neibauer to develop a type certified aircraft. On 3 April 1993 he spun off a new company, Pacific Aviation Composites USA, in nearby Bend, Oregon. The new Lancair LC-40 was based on the fixed-gear Lancair ES. The first prototype flew in July 1996, followed by the certification prototype in early 1997. After a lengthy certification process, the design emerged as the Columbia 300 in 1998, followed by the turbocharged Columbia 400 in 2000. The Lancair Company was formed as a separate entity on 7 April 2000, and Pacific Aviation Composites was merged into The Lancair Company on 4 May 2000.

Deciding to focus on the Columbia models, in March 2003 Neibauer sold the kit side of the company to Joseph Bartels, a Louisiana attorney and Lancair IV-P builder and owner. Bartels had already formed Aero Cool to sell air conditioners for the various Lancair models. On 15 July 2005 Neibauer&#x27;s portion of the company became Columbia Aircraft. The Columbias competed relatively unsuccessfully with the new and first-to-market Cirrus SR22. In 2010, major stockholders, the Wolstenholme family of Colmar, Pennsylvania, purchased the company and appointed Bob Wolstenholme as CEO. Following its entry into bankruptcy in 2007, Columbia Aircraft was sold to Cessna in November 2007. Cessna introduced their models as the Cessna 350 and Cessna 400.

===Selling off older designs===
In July 2016 Lancair announced it would be selling the older Lancair lines of aircraft to concentrate on the Lancair Evolution instead. In February 2017 the 200, 360, IV, IVP, IVPT, ES, ESP, and Legacy designs were sold to Mark and Conrad Huffstutler, who now operate the company as Lancair International, LLC, in Uvalde, Texas. They purchased all the assets, intellectual property and will provide parts and other support for all the older Lancair models. They plan to resume production of some of the older models and will develop new models as well. With the sale announced Lancair changed its name to Evolution Aircraft.

<text>The voiceless uvular plosive or stop is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. It is pronounced like a voiceless velar plosive , except that the tongue makes contact not on the soft palate but on the uvula. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

There is also the voiceless pre-uvular plosive in some languages, which is articulated slightly more front compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical uvular consonant, though not as front as the prototypical velar consonant. The International Phonetic Alphabet does not have a separate symbol for that sound, though it can be transcribed as or (both symbols denote an advanced ) or (retracted ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are codice_2 and codice_3, respectively.

<text>European cuisine (also known as Continental cuisine) comprises the cuisines originating from the various countries of Europe.

The cuisines of European countries are diverse, although some common characteristics distinguish them from those of other regions. Compared to traditional cooking of East Asia, meat holds a more prominent and substantial role in serving size. Many dairy products are utilised in cooking. There are hundreds of varieties of cheese and other fermented milk products. White wheat-flour bread has long been the prestige starch, but historically, most people ate bread, flatcakes, or porridge made from rye, spelt, barley, and oats. Those better-off would also make pasta, dumplings and pastries. The potato has become a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the European colonisation of the Americas. Maize is much less common in most European diets than it is in the Americas; however, corn meal (polenta or mămăligă) is a major part of the cuisine of Italy and the Balkans. Although flatbreads (especially with toppings such as pizza or tarte flambée) and rice are eaten in Europe, they are only staple foods in limited areas, particularly in Southern Europe. Salads (cold dishes with uncooked or cooked vegetables, sometimes with a dressing) are an integral part of European cuisine.

Formal European dinners are served in distinct courses. European presentation evolved from service à la française, or bringing multiple dishes to the table at once, into service à la russe, where dishes are presented sequentially. Usually, cold, hot and savoury, and sweet dishes are served strictly separately in this order, as hors d&#x27;oeuvre (appetizer) or soup, as entrée and main course, and as dessert. Dishes that are both sweet and savoury were common earlier in Ancient Roman cuisine, but are today uncommon, with sweet dishes being served only as dessert. A service where the guests are free to take food by themselves is termed a buffet, and is usually restricted to parties or holidays. Nevertheless, guests are expected to follow the same pattern.

Historically, European cuisine has been developed in the European royal and noble courts. European nobility was usually arms-bearing and lived in separate manors in the countryside. The knife was the primary eating implement (cutlery), and eating steaks and other foods that require cutting followed. This contrasted with East Asian cuisine, where the ruling class were the court officials, who had their food prepared ready to eat in the kitchen, to be eaten with chopsticks. The knife was supplanted by the spoon for soups, while the fork was introduced later in the early modern period, ca. 16th century. Today, most dishes are intended to be eaten with cutlery and only a few finger foods can be eaten with the hands in polite company.

==History==
===Medieval===


In medieval times, a person&#x27;s diet varied depending on their social class. However, cereal grains made up a lot of a medieval person&#x27;s diet, regardless of social class. Bread was common to both classes; it was taken as a lunch for the working man, and thick slices of it were used as plates called trenchers. People of the noble class had access to finely ground flours for their breads and other baked goods. Noblemen were allowed to hunt for deer, boar, rabbits, birds, and other animals, giving them access to fresh meat and fish for their meals. Dishes for people of these classes were often heavily spiced. Spices at that time were very expensive, and the more spices used in dishes, the more wealth the person needed to purchase such ingredients. Common spices used were cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, pepper, cumin, cloves, turmeric, anise, and saffron. Other ingredients used in dishes for the nobility and clergy included sugar, almonds and dried fruits like raisins. These imported ingredients would have been very expensive and nearly impossible for commoners to obtain. When banquets were held, the dishes served would be very spectacular: another way for the noblemen to show how rich they were. Sugar sculptures would be placed on the tables as decoration and to eat, and foods would be dyed vibrant colors with imported spices.

Milan in Italy is home to the oldest restaurant in Italy and the second in Europe, the Antica trattoria Bagutto, which has existed since at least 1284. The diet of a commoner would have been much simpler. Strict poaching laws prevented them from hunting, and if they did hunt and were caught, they could have parts of their limbs cut off or they could be killed. Much of the commoners&#x27; food would have been preserved in some way, such as through pickling or by being salted. Breads would have been made using rye or barley, and any vegetables would likely have been grown by the commoners themselves. Peasants would have likely been able to keep cows, and so would have access to milk, which then allowed them to make butter or cheese. When meat was eaten, it would have been beef, pork, or lamb. Commoners also ate a dish called pottage, a thick stew of vegetables, grains, and meat.

===Early modern era===
The cuisine of early modern Europe (c. 1500–1800) was a mix of dishes inherited from medieval cuisine combined with innovations that would persist in the modern era.

The discovery of the New World, the establishment of new trade routes with Asia and increased foreign influences from sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East meant that Europeans became familiarized with a multitude of new foodstuffs. Spices that previously had been prohibitively expensive luxuries, such as pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger, soon became available to the majority population, and the introduction of new plants coming from the New World and India like maize, potato, sweet potato, chili pepper, cocoa, vanilla, tomato, coffee, and tea transformed European cuisine forever.

Though there was a great influx of new ideas, an increase in foreign trade and a scientific revolution, preservation of foods remained traditional: preserved by drying, salting, and smoking or pickling in vinegar. Fare was naturally dependent on the season: a cookbook by Domenico Romoli called &quot;Panunto&quot; made a virtue of necessity by including a recipe for each day of the year. Everywhere both doctors and chefs continued to characterize foodstuffs by their effects on the four humours: they were considered to be heating or cooling to the constitution, moistening or drying.

There was a very great increase in prosperity in Europe during this period, which gradually reached all classes and all areas, and considerably changed the patterns of eating. Nationalism was first conceived in the early modern period, but it was not until the 19th century that the notion of a national cuisine emerged. Class differences were far more important dividing lines, and it was almost always upper-class food that was described in recipe collections and cookbooks.
==Central European cuisines==

All of these countries have their specialities. Among many such specialities, Austria is famous for Wiener schnitzel, a breaded veal cutlet served with a slice of lemon; the Czech Republic for world-renowned beers; Germany for world-famous wursts, Hungary for goulash. Slovakia is famous for gnocchi-like halušky pasta. Slovenia is known for German- and Italian-influenced cuisine, Poland for pierogis which are a cross between ravioli and empanada. Liechtenstein and German-speaking Switzerland are famous for Rösti and French-speaking Switzerland for fondue and raclettes.

<text>The Curtiss SB2C Helldiver is a dive bomber developed by Curtiss-Wright during World War II. As a carrier-based bomber with the United States Navy (USN), in Pacific theaters, it supplemented and replaced the Douglas SBD Dauntless. A few survivors are extant.

Initially poor handling characteristics and late modifications caused lengthy delays to production and deployment, to the extent that it was investigated by the Truman Committee, which turned in a scathing report. This contributed to the decline of Curtiss as a company. Neither pilots nor aircraft carrier skippers seemed to like it. Nevertheless, the type was faster than the Dauntless, and by the end of the Pacific War, the Helldiver had become the main dive bomber and attack aircraft on USN carriers.

By the time a land-based variant, known as the A-25 Shrike, became available in late 1943, the Western Allied air forces had abandoned dedicated dive-bombers. A majority of A-25s delivered to the US Army Air Forces were transferred to the US Marine Corps, which used the type only in one side campaign and non-combat roles. The British Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force also cancelled substantial orders, retaining only a few aircraft for research purposes.

Nicknames for the aircraft included &quot;Big-Tailed Beast&quot; or just &quot;Beast&quot;, &quot;Two-Cee&quot;, and &quot;Son-of-a-Bitch 2nd Class&quot;; the latter nickname was derived from the name SB2C and the aircraft&#x27;s reputation for having difficult handling characteristics.

==Design and development==
The Helldiver was developed to replace the Douglas SBD Dauntless. It was a much larger aircraft, able to operate from the latest aircraft carriers and carry a considerable array of armament. It featured an internal bomb bay that reduced drag when carrying heavy ordnance. Saddled with demanding requirements set forth by both the U.S. Marines and United States Army Air Forces, the manufacturer incorporated features of a &quot;multi-role&quot; aircraft into the design.

The Model XSB2C-1 prototype initially suffered development issues connected to its Wright R-2600 &quot;Twin Cyclone&quot; engine and three-bladed propeller; further concerns included structural weaknesses, poor handling, directional instability, and bad stall characteristics. In 1939, a student took a model of the new Curtiss XSB2C-1 to the MIT wind tunnel. Professor of Aeronautical Engineering Otto C. Koppen was quoted as saying, &quot;if they build more than one of these, they are crazy&quot;. He was referring to controllability issues with the small vertical tail.

The first prototype made its maiden flight on 18 December 1940. It crashed on 8 February 1941 when its engine failed on approach, but Curtiss was asked to rebuild it. The fuselage was lengthened and a larger tail was fitted, while an autopilot was fitted to help the poor stability. The revised prototype flew again on 20 October 1941, but was destroyed when its wing failed during diving tests on 21 December 1941.

Large-scale production had already been ordered on 29 November 1940, but a large number of modifications were specified for the production model. Fin and rudder area were increased, fuel capacity was increased, self-sealing fuel tanks were added, and the fixed armament was doubled to four 0.50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in the wings, compared with the prototype&#x27;s two cowling guns. The SB2C-1 was built with larger fuel tanks, improving its range considerably.

The program suffered so many delays that the Grumman TBF Avenger entered service before the Helldiver, even though the Avenger had begun its development two years later. Nevertheless, production tempo accelerated with production at Columbus, Ohio and two Canadian factories: Fairchild Aircraft Ltd. (Canada), which produced 300 (under the designations XSBF-l, SBF-l, SBF-3, and SBF-4E), and Canadian Car and Foundry, which built 894 (designated SBW-l, SBW-3, SBW-4, SBW-4E, and SBW-5), these models being respectively equivalent to their Curtiss-built counterparts. A total of 7,140 SB2Cs and equivalent models were produced in World War II.

==Operational history==

===US Navy===
The U.S. Navy would not accept the SB2C until 880 modifications to the design and the changes on the production line had been made, delaying the Curtiss Helldiver&#x27;s combat debut until 11 November 1943 with squadron VB-17 on , when they attacked the Japanese-held port of Rabaul on the island of New Britain, north of Papua New Guinea. The first version of the SB2C-1 was kept stateside for training, its various development problems leading to only 200 being built. The first deployment model was the SB2C-1C. The SB2C-1 could deploy slats mechanically linked with landing gear actuators, that extended from the outer third of the wing leading edge to aid lateral control at low speeds. The early prognosis of the &quot;Beast&quot; was unfavourable; it was strongly disliked by aircrews due to its size, weight, and reduced range compared to the SBD it replaced.

In the Battle of the Philippine Sea, 45 Helldivers, most of which had been launched from extreme range, were lost when they ran out of fuel while returning to their carriers.

Among its major faults, the Helldiver was underpowered, had a shorter range than the SBD, was equipped with an unreliable electrical system, and its manufacturing quality control was often poor. The Curtiss-Electric propeller and the complex hydraulic system had frequent maintenance problems. One of the faults of the aircraft throughout its operational life was poor longitudinal stability, resulting from a fuselage that was too short due to the necessity of fitting onto aircraft carrier elevators. The Helldiver&#x27;s aileron response was also poor and handling suffered greatly under airspeed; since the speed of approach to land on a carrier was supposed to be , this proved problematic. The 880 changes demanded by the Navy and modification of the aircraft to its combat role resulted in a 42% weight increase, explaining much of the problem.
The solution to these problems began with the introduction of the SB2C-3 beginning in 1944, which used the R-2600-20 Twin Cyclone engine with and Curtiss&#x27; four-bladed propeller. This substantially solved the chronic lack of power that had plagued the aircraft. The Helldivers would participate in battles over the Marianas, Philippines (partly responsible for sinking the battleship ), Taiwan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa (in the sinking of the battleship ). They were also used in the 1945 attacks on the Ryukyu Islands and the Japanese home island of Honshū in tactical attacks on airfields, communications and shipping. They were also used extensively in patrols during the period between the dropping of the atomic bombs and the official Japanese surrender, and in the immediate pre-occupation period.

An oddity of the SB2Cs with 1942 to 1943-style tricolor camouflage was that the undersides of the outer wing panels carried dark topside camouflage because the undersurfaces were visible from above when the wings were folded.

In operational experience, it was found that the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair fighters were able to carry an equally heavy bomb load against ground targets and were vastly more capable of defending themselves against enemy fighters. The Helldiver, however, could still deliver ordnance with more precision against specific targets and its two-seat configuration permitted a second set of eyes. A Helldiver also has a significant advantage in range over a fighter while carrying a bombload, which is extremely important in naval operations.

The advent of air-to-ground rockets ensured that the SB2C was the last purpose-built dive bomber produced. Rockets allowed precision attack against surface naval and land targets, while avoiding the stresses of near-vertical dives and the demanding performance requirements that they placed on dive bombers.
The SB2C remained in active postwar service in active duty US Navy squadrons until 1947 and in Naval Reserve aviation units until 1950. Surplus aircraft were sold to the naval air forces of France, Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Thailand. Greek SB2Cs served in combat in the Greek Civil War with additional machine guns mounted in wing pods. French SB2Cs flew in the First Indochina War from 1951 to 1954.

===US Army and US Marine Corps service===
Built at Curtiss&#x27; St. Louis plant, 900 aircraft were ordered by the USAAF under the designation A-25A Shrike. The first ten aircraft had folding wings, while the remainder of the production order omitted this feature. Many other changes distinguished the A-25A, including larger main wheels, a pneumatic tailwheel, ring and bead gunsight, longer exhaust stubs, and other Army-specified radio equipment. By late 1943, when the A-25A was being introduced, the USAAF no longer had a role for the dive bomber, as fighter aircraft such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt had shown their ability to carry out tactical air support missions with great success.

The USAAF transferred 410 Helldivers to the US Marines. The A-standard 25As were converted to the USMC variant, SB2C-1A and one squadron, VMSB-151, based on Enjebi (a.k.a. Engebi/Enjibe; part of Enewetak Atoll) conducted bombing missions on bypassed Japanese strongpoints nearby. Otherwise, the SB2C-1A variant never saw combat, and was used primarily as a trainer and target tug.

===Australian service===

At an early stage of World War II, the Australian government noted that the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) lacked dedicated dive bombers and ordered 150 Curtiss Shrikes. These aircraft were paid for by the US Government as Lend Lease aid.

By November 1943, when the first shipment of 10 Shrikes arrived in Australia, the RAAF had decided that dive bombing was an outmoded tactic. Vultee Vengeance dive bombers, which were already in service with the RAAF, were being replaced by light bombers. As a result, the order for the remaining 140 Shrikes was cancelled.

While the 10 aircraft received were taken on strength, with the RAAF serial prefix A69, only one of these Shrikes officially took to the air in RAAF service. A69-4 was assigned to No. 1 Air Performance Unit, for performance testing, between December 1943 and April 1944. The RAAF and US Fifth Air Force already operated a joint pool of aircraft types common to both services in the South West Pacific theatre and, by mid-January 1944, the other nine Shrikes had been transferred to USAAF units. A69-4 was also transferred to the USAAF in December 1944.

===British service===
The Helldiver&#x27;s service with the British resembled Australian experience with the type. A total of 26 aircraft, out of 450 ordered, were delivered to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm, where they were known as the Helldiver I. After unsatisfactory tests by the A&amp;AEE that pinpointed &quot;appalling handling&quot;, none of the British Helldivers were used in action.

===Greek service===

American aid provided the Royal Hellenic Air Force with 48 Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldivers from surplus U.S. Navy stocks. The aircraft were delivered by the aircraft carrier USS Sicily (CVE-118) in the spring of 1949. From the 48 aircraft, 6 were used for ground instruction or spare parts and 42 were given to 336th Fighter Squadron (336 Μοίρα Διώξεως) to replace Supermarine Spitfires and the squadron&#x27;s name was changed to 336th Bomber Squadron (336 Μοίρα Βομβαρδισμού).

Greek SB2C-5 Helldivers had minor changes for their COIN operations: the hard rubber tailwheel (for carrier use) was replaced by a bigger pneumatic tire for use on landing strips; and the rear gunner station and its twin MGs were deleted, as no aerial opposition existed and weight reduction was used for bombs and extra machine guns.

Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldivers, Supermarine Spitfires, and North American T-6D/Gs were used in ground-attack missions against Communist ground forces, camps, and transports during the last stages of the Greek Civil War.

Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldivers saw a relatively brief combat service and were gradually phased out by 1953. A few were in use until 1957 as photographic aircraft. One Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldiver was restored in 1997 and is displayed in the Hellenic Air Force Museum.

===French service===

Between 1949 and 1954, France bought 110 SB2C-5 Helldiver aircraft to replace their aging SBD-5 Dauntless that had been flying in combat in Vietnam. The French &quot;Aeronavale&quot; flew the Helldiver from 1951 to 1958.

Some of these aircraft were allotted to &quot;flottilles&quot; 3F and 9F stationed on board the carriers &quot;Arromanches&quot;, &quot;Bois Belleau&quot;, and &quot;La Fayette&quot;, during the First Indochina War. The Helldivers were used to support French troops on the ground during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954.

Frazer and his passenger escaped uninjured, but the Helldiver sank in 90 ft. of water. The aircraft was discovered in February 2010 by a fisherman and recovered on 20 August 2010 for restoration.
;Wrecks
*A SB2C-4E Helldiver belonging to the United States Navy crashed and burned in foul weather on 9 October 1945, while en route from New Cumberland, Pennsylvania to its base at Naval Air Station Grosse Ile, Michigan after participating in Nimitz Day celebrations held in Washington, D.C. Pilot Frank Campbell and gunner George Cohlmia, both World War II veterans, were killed in the crash. The remains of the plane are still located at the crash site on Laurel Hill in Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania, three miles southeast of the village of Waterford.
*In January 2010, a scuba diver discovered a SB2C-1C Helldiver that was ditched in Maalaea Bay off South Maui in August 1944. The Helldiver is covered in coral and is missing its tail section. The aircraft experienced problems with its empennage after dive bombing maneuvers which forced pilot Lieutenant William Dill to ditch. It lies in 50 ft of water facing east. The site, which is protected under state and federal law, is in the process of being marked with a plaque by the U.S. Navy. A mooring may be installed at a later point in time to facilitate dives on the site.
*On 19 December 2011 scuba divers discovered an SB2C Helldiver off the coast of Jupiter, Florida. The aircraft is mostly intact and was found inverted with the landing gear retracted. In May 2012, the US Navy conducted a survey of the aircraft, recovering a data plate from the horizontal stabilizer. The Naval History and Heritage Command&#x27;s Underwater Archaeology Branch were attempting to determine if the numbers stamped on the data plate were readable to identify the aircraft.
;;SB2C-5
*83414 - On 25 March 2010, the Oregon State Police, Tillamook County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and the United States Navy announced that during a logging operation near Rockaway Beach, Oregon, the wreck of an SB2C Helldiver was located. Initial responders believe there may be human remains on the scene.

<text>A petty officer (PO) is a non-commissioned officer in many navies. Often they may be superior to a seaman, and subordinate to more senior non-commissioned officers, such as chief petty officers.

Petty officers are usually sailors that have served at least several years in their respective navies. Petty officers represent the junior and mid-grade non-commissioned officer ranks of many naval services, and are generally responsible for the day-to-day supervision of ranks junior to them. They may also serve as technical specialists within their rating (military occupation).

==Origin==

The modern petty officer dates back to the Age of Sail in the Royal Navy. Petty officers rank between naval officers (both commissioned and warrant) and most enlisted sailors. These were men with some claim to officer rank, sufficient to distinguish them from ordinary ratings, without raising them so high as the sea officers. Several were warrant officers, in the literal sense of being appointed by warrant, and like the warrant sea officers, their superiors, they were usually among the specialists of the ship&#x27;s company. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; suggests that the title derives from the Anglo-Norman and Middle French &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;of small size, small, little&quot;.

Two of the Royal Navy petty officer&#x27;s rates, midshipman and master&#x27;s mate, were a superior petty officer with a more general authority, but they remained no more than ratings. However, it was quite possible for a warrant officer (such as the armourer), in his role as a superior officer, to be court-martialed for striking a midshipman. This is because the midshipman was regarded as future sea officer, with the all-important social distinction of having the right to walk the quarterdeck. Midshipmen wore distinctive uniforms, master&#x27;s mates dressed respectably, and both behaved like officers. The master&#x27;s mate rating evolved into the rank of sub-lieutenant, and midshipman evolved into naval cadet. In the same administrative reforms of the 1860s that created the rank of Sub-lieutenant, two grades of Petty Officer were established for senior ratings — Petty Officer Second Class and Petty Officer First Class, the latter usually being achieved by men who had served as a PO 2nd Class with good conduct for six years. PO2s wore &#x27;square rig&#x27; (the traditional sailor suit worn by junior ratings) while PO1s wore &#x27;fore and aft&#x27; rig like chief petty officers and above. PO2s wore insignia of a fouled anchor (as for leading hands) but surmounted by a crown, while the insignia of a PO1 was a pair of crossed fouled anchors with a crown. The rank of Petty Officer Second Class was abolished in 1907 and the rank simply being titled as Petty Officer from then, with the uniform and insignia formerly used by PO1s.


==Grades==
* Petty officer third class
* Petty officer second class
* Petty officer first class
* Chief petty officer
* Senior chief petty officer
* Master chief petty officer

==Usage in navies==

===Canada===
There are two petty officer ranks in the Royal Canadian Navy. Petty officer, 2nd class (PO2) (&quot;maître de deuxième classe&quot; or &quot;m2&quot; in French) is equivalent to a sergeant and petty officer, 1st class (PO1) (&quot;maître de première classe&quot; or &quot;m1&quot;) is equivalent to a warrant officer.

Petty officers are normally addressed as &quot;Petty Officer Bloggins&quot; or &quot;PO Bloggins&quot;, thereafter as &quot;PO&quot;. The &quot;1st class&quot; and &quot;2nd class&quot; designations are normally only used when such a distinction needs to be made, such as on a promotion parade or to distinguish two petty officers with similar names but different ranks. The NATO rank denotion for &quot;petty officer, 2nd class&quot; is OR-6 (petty officers, 2nd class with less than 3 years seniority are considered OR-5). The NATO rank denotion for &quot;petty officer, 1st class&quot; is OR-7.

===India===
A petty officer is a non-commissioned officer in the Indian Navy, equivalent to the NATO rank enlisted grade of OR-6. They are equal in rank to a sub inspector of police in the Police, or sergeant in the Indian Army and Indian Air Force. A petty officer is superior in rank to a leading rate and subordinate to a chief petty officer, as is the case in the majority of Commonwealth navies.

A petty officer has the ability to work as a leader, capable of taking charge of a group of personnel, and taking roles in the training and recruitment of new members of the Indian Navy.

===United Kingdom===

In the Royal Navy, the rate of petty officer comes above that of leading rating and below that of chief petty officer. It is the equivalent of sergeant in the Royal Marines, British Army and Royal Air Force. Petty officer is the lowest of the senior rating grades. Petty officers, like all senior rates, wear &quot;fore and aft&quot; rig.

===United States===
The title of petty officer in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard has three separate &quot;classes&quot; (in order from junior to senior: 3rd class, 2nd class, 1st class) and three senior grades (chief petty officer, senior chief petty officer, master chief petty officer). Petty officer, first class is equivalent in paygrade to staff sergeant in the United States Army and Marine Corps, and technical sergeant in the United States Air Force and United States Space Force. Petty officer, second class is equivalent in paygrade to sergeant in the United States Army, Marine Corps, and Space Force, and staff sergeant in the United States Air Force. Petty officer, third class is equivalent in paygrade to corporal in the United States Army, corporal in the United States Marine Corps, senior airman in the United States Air Force, and specialist 4 in the United States Space Force.

In the Navy, Petty Officer, Third Class is the juniormost of the Non-Commissioned Officer ranks, and thus a sailor must demonstrate satisfactory performance in the previous rank (E-3) in the form of a favorable performance review(s) by his/her superiors, and the passing of an exam, in order to be promoted to PO3.

Enlisted rank has two components: rate (pay grade) and rating (job specialty). Both components are reflected in the title. A sailor in the rate of petty officer first class with a rating of Aviation Machinist&#x27;s Mate, would be an Aviation Machinist&#x27;s Mate 1st Class (abbreviated &quot;AD1&quot;). In the Navy, it is acceptable to refer to a Petty Officer as such, while in the Coast Guard, rating is always used.

<doc id="524766" wikidata="Q7860391" url="?curid=524766" title="Tymnet">
<text>Tymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in Cupertino, California that used virtual call packet-switched technology and X.25, SNA/SDLC, BSC and Async interfaces to connect host computers (servers) at thousands of large companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. Users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated asynchronous connections.

The business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network that allowed government agencies and large companies (mostly banks and airlines) to build their own dedicated networks. The private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network. Tymnet was also connected to dozens of international public gateways via Tymnet II protocol and other public networks in the United States and internationally via X.25/X.75 gateways.

As the Internet grew and became almost universally accessible in the late 1990s, the need for services such as Tymnet migrated to the Internet style connections, but still had some value in the Third World and for specific legacy roles. However the value of these links continued to decrease, and Tymnet shut down in 2004.

==Network==
Tymnet offered local dial-up modem access in most cities in the United States and to a limited degree in Canada, which preferred its own DATAPAC service.

Users would dial into Tymnet and then interact with a simple command-line interface to establish a connection with a remote system. Once connected, data was passed to and from the user as if connected directly to a modem on the distant system.

Tymnet was extensively used by large companies to provide dial-up services for their employees who were &quot;on the road&quot;, as well as a gateway for users to connect to large online services such as CompuServe or The Source.

===Organization and functionality===
In its original implementation, the network supervisor contained most of the routing intelligence in the network. Unlike the TCP/IP protocol underlying the internet, Tymnet used a circuit switching layout which allowed the supervisors to be aware of every possible end-point. In its original incarnation, the users connected to nodes built using Varian minicomputers, then entered commands that were passed to the supervisor which ran on a XDS 940 host.

Circuits were character oriented and the network was oriented towards interactive character-by-character full-duplex communications circuits. The nodes handled character translation between various character sets, which were numerous at that time. This did have the side effect of making data transfers quite difficult, as bytes from the file would be invisibly &quot;translated&quot; without specific intervention on the part of the user.

Tymnet later developed their own custom hardware, the Tymnet Engine, which contained both nodes and a supervisor running on one of those nodes. As the network grew, the supervisor was in danger of being overloaded by the sheer number of nodes in the network, since the requirements for controlling the network took a great part of the supervisor&#x27;s capacity.

Tymnet II was developed in response to this challenge. Tymnet II was developed to ameliorate the problems outlined above by off-loading some of the work-load from the supervisor and providing greater flexibility in the network by putting more intelligence into the node code. A Tymnet II node would set up its own &quot;permuter tables&quot;, eliminating the need for the supervisor to keep copies of them, and had greater flexibility in handling its inter-node links. Data transfers were also possible via &quot;auxiliary circuits&quot;.

==History==
===Beginnings: Tymnet===
Tymshare was founded in 1964 as a time sharing company, selling computer time and software packages for users. It had two SDS/XDS 940 computers; access was via direct dial-up to the computers. In 1968, it purchased Dial Data, another time-sharing service bureau.

In 1968, Norm Hardy and LaRoy Tymes developed the idea of using remote sites with minicomputers to communicate with the mainframes. The minicomputers would serve as the network&#x27;s nodes, running a program to route data. In November 1971, the first Tymnet Supervisor program became operational. Written in assembly code by LaRoy Tymes for the SDS 940, with architectural design contributions from Norman Hardy, the &quot;Supervisor&quot; was the beginning of the Tymnet network.
One instance of the supervisor would be running at all times and choose a path (circuit) through the network for each new interactive session.
The Varian 620i (8K of 16 bit words) was used for the TYMNET nodes. Initially, Tymshare and its direct customers were the network&#x27;s only users. In February, 1972, the National Library of Medicine became the first non-Tymshare network customer with a toxicology data base on an IBM 360.

It soon became apparent that the SDS 940 could not keep up with the rapid growth of the network. In 1972, Joseph Rinde joined the Tymnet group and began porting the Supervisor code to the 32-bit Interdata 7/32, as the 8/32 was not yet ready. In 1973, the 8/32 became available, but the performance was disappointing and a crash-effort was made to develop a machine that could run Rinde&#x27;s Supervisor.

In 1974, a second, more efficient version of the Supervisor software became operational. The new Tymnet &quot;Engine&quot; software was used on both the Supervisor machines and on the nodes. After the migration to the Tymnet Engine, they started developing Tymnet accounting and other support software on the PDP-10. Tymshare sold the Tymnet network software to TRW, who created their own private network, TRWNET.

Tymes and Rinde then developed &quot;Tymnet II&quot;. Tymnet II ran in parallel with the original network, which continued to run on the Varian machines until it was phased out over a period of several years. Tymnet II&#x27;s different method of constructing virtual circuits allowed for much better scalability.

In 1996, the third and final version of the Supervisor was written in C for a Sparc multiprocessor work station by Tymes and Romolo Raffo. Node code software was ported from the Tymnet Engine to a Sparc platform by Bill Soley. Up to 10 old-style Tymnet Engines were replaced by a single Sparc node in the network switching centers.

===Tymnet, Inc. spun off===

In about 1979, Tymnet Inc. was spun off from Tymshare Inc. to continue administration and operation of the Tymnet network and its VAN services. The network continued to grow, and customers who owned their own host computers and wanted access to them from remote sites became interested in connecting their computers to the network. This led to the foundation of Tymnet as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tymshare to run a public network as a common carrier within the United States. This allowed users to connect their host computers and terminals to the network, and use the computers from remote sites or sell time on their computers to other users of the network, with Tymnet charging them for the use of the network.

The network offered an email service called OnTyme.

===Sold to McDonnell Douglas===
McDonnell Douglas Tymshare

In 1984 Tymnet was bought by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation as part of the acquisition of Tymshare. The company was renamed McDonnell Douglas Tymshare, and began a major reorganization. A year later, McDonnell Douglas (MD) split Tymshare into several separate operating companies: MD Network Systems Company, MD Field Service Company, MD RCS, MD &quot;xxx&quot; and many more. (This is sometimes referred to the Alphabet Soup phase of the company). At this point, Tymnet had outlived its parent company Tymshare.

McDonnell Douglas acquired Microdata and created MD Information Systems Group (MDISC), expecting to turn Microdata&#x27;s desktop and server systems along with Tymshare&#x27;s servers and Tymnet data network into a major player in the Information Services market. Microdata&#x27;s systems were integrated into many parts of McDonnell Douglas, but Tymnet never was. MDC really did not seem to understand the telecommunications market. After five years, peace was breaking out in many places in the world and McDonnell Douglas sold off MDNSC and MDFSC at a profit for much needed cash.

Earlier, in 1986, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) liberalized the interconnection rules in the provinces it then regulated (Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia) and this allowed McDonnell Douglas to expand the network into select Canadian cities. The Canadian operation was part of McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company (MDCSC) as this was the only MDxxx company operating in Canada. MDCSC hired David Kingsland to spearhead this expansion into Canada.

===Sold to British Telecom===
====BT Tymnet, BT North America, BTNA====

On July 30, 1989, at the Marriott Hotel in Santa Clara, it was announced that British Telecom was purchasing McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company, and McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company was being spun off as a start-up called NovaDyne. British Telecom (BT) wanted to expand and the acquisition of Tymnet, which already a worldwide data network, was projected to help to achieve that goal. On November 17, 1989, MDNSC officially became BT Tymnet with its parochial U.S. headquarters in San Jose, California. BT brought with it the idea of continuous development with teams in America, Europe, and Asia-pacific all working together on the same projects. BT renamed the Tymnet services, Global Network Services (GNS).

British Telecom brought new life to the company with development of hardware and software for the Tymnet data network using contacts BT already had with telecommunication hardware vendors. There was a trial of &quot;next-generation&quot; nodes scattered throughout the network, called &quot;TURBO engine nodes&quot; based on the Motorola 68000 family. In the mid to late 1980s, serious node-code development was migrated from the PDP-10s to UNIX. Sun-3 (based on the Motorola 68000) and later Sun-4 (SPARC based) workstations and servers were purchased from Sun Microsystems, though the majority of PDP-10s were still around in the early &#x27;90s for legacy code, as well as documentation storage. Eventually, all of the code development trees were on the Sun-4s, and the development tools (NAD, etc.) had been ported to SunOS.

Another project begun a few months before the BT purchase was to migrate the Tymnet code repository from the PDP-10s to Sun systems. The new servers were dubbed the Code Generation Systems or CGS. They were initially six Sun-3 servers upgraded eventually to two Sun-4/690 servers for redundancy. A second pair of servers for catastrophic failover were also installed in Malvern, PA and later moved to Norristown, PA as part of later site consolidation efforts. After the migration, there was code for more than 6000 nodes and 38,000 customer interfaces.

Tymnet was still growing, and at several times reached its peak capacity when some of its customers held network intensive events. One of these of note was a live, on-line presentation and chat on America On-Line (AOL) with Michael Jackson. Tymnet usage statistics showed AOL&#x27;s call capacity was greater than its maximum volume for the duration of the event.

===Sold to MCI, Concert===
====MCI, NewCo, Concert====

In 1993 British Telecom (BT) and MCI Communications (MCI) negotiated what they called the &quot;Deal of the Century&quot;, where MCI would take ownership of the US-based portions of Tymnet and they would create a 50/50 joint venture called &quot;Concert&quot;. (The joint venture was called &quot;NewCo&quot; for more than a year while they decided on a name.) Concert was also aligned with another acquisition of BT, called Syncordia which was headquartered in Atlanta, Ga. Tymnet was then referred to as: The Packet network, the BT/MCI network and Concert Packet-switching Services (CPS). As MCI cut away at Tymnet, expecting it to die, it became a cash cow that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.

In May 1994, there were still three DEC KL-10s under TYMCOM-X. At this time, the network had approximately 5000 nodes in 30 foreign countries. A variety of protocols can be run over a single packet-switching network, and Tymnet&#x27;s most-used protocols were X.25, asynchronous (ATI/AHI), SNA.

BT and Concert also continued to develop the network, and after the failure of the &quot;Turbo nodes&quot; to take off, decided to have an outside company add Tymnet protocols to existing hardware used in their frame-relay network. Telematics International developed a subset of the Tymnet protocols to run on their ACP/PCP nodes. The Telematics nodes were connected in a mesh network via Frame Relay and appeared to Tymnet as super-nodes that were directly connected to as many as 44 other super-nodes interconnecting most of Europe, Asia and the Americas as a high-speed-data network.

MCI took a different direction and looked to migrate the network protocols to run over TCP/IP and use Sun Microsystems SPARC technology. The supervisor technology was rewritten in C to run as standard UNIX applications under Sun&#x27;s Solaris operating system. Funding for this project was at a minimum but the Tymnet engineers believed it was a superior method and proceeded anyway.

Times were changing and the Internet and World Wide Web were becoming a practical and even important part of corporate and personal life. Tymnet technology needed improvements to keep pace with TCP/IP and other internet protocols. Both BT and MCI decided not to compete with the Internet, but to convert their customer base to IP based networks and technologies. However, the Tymnet network was still bringing in much cash (in some cases more than current IP-based services), so both BT and MCI needed to keep their customers happy.

====MCI, MCI Worldcom, Worldcom vs. BT, Concert, AT&amp;T====
In 1997 talks were underway for British Telecom (BT) to acquire MCI. The deal fell through, and in September, 1998 MCI was acquired by WorldCom after they made a better offer for the company. Actually, the Worldcom offer was nearly identical to the BT offer, but where BT planned to buy out MCI shares of stock, WorldCom offered a stock-swap which was more attractive to the stockholders. Worldcom took control in September 1998 and dissolved the BT/MCI alliance as of October 15, 1998.

====Concert - headquarters in Reston, Va.====

With the alliance gone, BT and MCI/Worldcom began the process of unraveling and separating their extensive voice and data communications systems.

Concert created Project Leonardo to separate the BT and MCI/Worldcom voice and data networks. At times over the next five years, advancements were made or stalled due to BT and MCI management negotiating and renegotiating the terms of their contractual obligations to each other made during the alliance. At times, things came to a standstill, or decisions made were reversed, and some reversed again at a later time. Parts of the project were to migrate customers from X.25 to IP based networks, while others created a duplicate set of services so that both Concert and MCI could separately continue to run and manage their own portions of the network. Accounting data for network usage was also shared by the two companies and had to be separated before clients could be billed properly.

====Concert - headquarters in Atlanta, Ga.====

In 2000 BT then went searching for another alliance, and created a new &quot;Concert&quot; alliance between BT and AT&amp;T Corporation, moving the headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia. This alliance did not help the negotiations between BT and MCI Worldcom as their partners from MCI and AT&amp;T were corporate enemies. For Tymnet, the data network portion of the split, and the &quot;CPS Leonardo&quot; project, the split was never fully realized. Instead, MCI Worldcom completed their migration of services from Tymnet to IP based services in March 2003 and disconnected their supervisor nodes and their portion of the network on March 31, 2003. British Telecom continued to run the network using their own supervisor and other utility nodes until February 2004 when their last customer was able to move all of its customers to other access services. BT and AT&amp;T dissolved their Concert alliance on September 30, 2003, and the remaining BT assets were combined with BTNA assets into BT Americas, Inc. Sometime in early March 2004, without ceremony, BT Americas disconnected the last two remaining Tymnet supervisors from the network, effectively shutting it down.

====Worldcom bankruptcy====
Worldcom executives were involved in a financial scandal. In June 2002, Worldcom admitted to nearly 4 billion dollars of incorrect accounting. The scandal resulted in the CEO, Bernard Ebbers, being ousted and later brought up on federal charges for conspiracy and securities fraud. The scandal sent the stock price down to ten cents per share. A month after the revelation of accounting &quot;mishaps&quot;, Worldcom filed for bankruptcy.

====MCI name revived and sold to Verizon====
Worldcom came out of bankruptcy renamed as &quot;MCI&quot; in April 2004. In less than a year, the remains of MCI was sold for $6.7B bid to what is today known as Verizon Business, a division of Verizon. Verizon had been formed in 2000 when Bell Atlantic, one of the Regional Bell Operating Companies, merged with GTE. Prior to its transformation into Verizon, Bell Atlantic had merged with another Regional Bell Operating Company, NYNEX, in 1997.

====AT&amp;T sold to SBC====
On January 31, 2005, SBC Communications announced that it would purchase AT&amp;T Corp. for more than $16 billion. Shortly thereafter the name was changed to AT&amp;T Inc. to distinguish itself from AT&amp;T Corp.

==Electronic Data Interchange (EDI &amp; EDI*Net)==
Tymshare EDI, MD Payment Systems Company, BTNA/MCI EDI*Net Services

Tymshare was one of the pioneers in the EDI field. Under McDonnell Douglas, the Payment Systems Company continued that legacy and maintained its own EDI*Net network monitoring and support group.

EDI*Net used a fault-tolerant Tandem NonStop computer with a second synchronized remote disaster NonStop computer over 100 miles apart. Mirrors of each other, and maintaining uptimes over 99.994%, they were each connected to a high speed data links using Tymnet as the connection and translation medium. Tymshare developed a bi-sync modem interface (HSA), a translation module to translate between EBCDIC and ASCII (BBXS), and a highly customized X.25 module (XCOM). EDI*Net used these interfaces on the Tandems. EDI*Net supported &amp; contributed to many EDI standards, with the United Nations&#x27; EDIFACT and ANSI X12 dominating. As a store-and-forward service, EDI*Net supported multiple delivery protocols besides X.25 and BiSync, including FTPS, SMTPS and ZModem, and allowed the enveloping structure of supported EDI standards to extend into X.400 and SMTP envelopes.

Developed to utilize X.25 (XCOM) and BiSync (BSC), there was no TCP/IP equivalent service within Tymnet. To continue use of this service after the shutdown of Tymnet, a solution was selected. A special version of Tymnet Engine node code which allows nodes and interfaces to communicate with one another and the rest of the network was created. Instead of relying on the &quot;supervisor&quot; to validate calls, a table of permitted connections was defined per customer to allow an incoming call to be made from the HSA interface to the BBXS interface to the XCOM interface and on to the Tandem computer. In effect, a &quot;Tymnet Island&quot; consisting of a single Tymnet node that accepted calls for a pre-determined list of clients was utilized by EDI*Net. No supervisor needed.

These islands of Tymnet have not only outlived the parent company, Tymshare, and the operations company, Tymnet, but also the Tymnet Network itself. As of 2008, these Tymnet Island nodes are still running and doing their jobs.

==Operations==
===Organization===
In operation, Tymshare&#x27;s Data Networks Division was responsible for the development and maintenance of the network and Tymnet was responsible for the administration, provisioning and monitoring of the network. Each company had their own software development staff and a line was drawn to separate what each group could do. Tymshare development engineers wrote all the code which ran in the network, and the Tymnet staff wrote code running on host computers connected to the network. It is for this reason, that many of the Tymnet projects ran on the Digital Equipment Corporation DECSystem-10 computers that Tymshare offered as timesharing hosts for their customers. Tymnet operations formed a strategic alliance with the Tymshare PDP-10 TYMCOM-X operating systems group to assist them in developing new network management tools.

===Trouble tracking===
====Origins====
From its earliest days, Tymnet had an on-line and real time network trouble reporting tool called the Consolidator. That, along with the network node interrogation capabilities (known as Snap or Snapshot), provided unique and real time operation of the network. However, trouble reports were initially tracked on a traditional paper ticket system. This was until Bill Scheible, a manager at Tymnet, wrote a small FORTRAN IV program to maintain a list of problem reports and track their status in a System 1022 database (a hierarchical database system for TOPS-10 published by Software House). The program was called PAPER after the old manual way of managing trouble tickets. The program grew as features were added to handle customer information, call-back contact information, escalation procedures, and outage statistics.

====Company-wide use====
Access to PAPER became critical as more and more functionality was added. It eventually was maintained on two dedicated PDP-10 computers, model KL-1090, accessible via the Tymnet Packet Network as Tymshare hosts 23 and 26. Each computer was the size of 5 refrigerators, and had a string of disks that looked like 18 washing machines. Their power supplies produced +5 volts at 200 amps (non-switching) making them expensive to operate.

====Major upgrades====
In 1996 the DEC PDP-10s that ran Tymnet&#x27;s trouble-ticket system were replaced by PDP-10 clones from XKL, Inc. They were accessible via TCP/IP as &quot;ticket.tymnet.com&quot; and &quot;token.tymnet.com&quot;, by both TELNET and HTTP. A low-end workstation from Sun was used as a telnet gateway; it accepted logins from the Tymnet network via x.25 to IP translation done by a Cisco router forwarded to &quot;ticket&quot; and/or &quot;token&quot;. The XKL TOAD-1 systems ran a modified TOPS-20. The application was ported to a newer version of the Fortran compiler, and still used the 1022 database.

====Decommission====
In mid to late 1998, Concert produced an inter-company trouble tracking system for use by both MCI and Concert. This was adopted and the TTS PAPER data necessary for ongoing tickets was re-entered on the new system. TTS was kept up for historical information until the end of the year.

In January 1999, both XKL servers (ticket and token) were decommissioned. In late 2003 the hardware left onsite in San Jose was accidentally scrapped by the facilities manager during a scheduled cleanup.

===System 1022 (Database System)===
System-1022 was a database that ran on Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s 36-bit hardware: the DECsystem-10 and also the DECSYSTEM-20, hence the 1022 name.

1022 was a hierarchical database system which could be accessed via third-generation languages such as Fortran and COBOL; it also had its own 4GL.

====Software House====
Software House, the company that trademarked and brought 1022 to market also marketed a VAX counterpart, System-1032.

Software House was acquired by Computer Corporation of America.

====System 1032====
In 1983, Software House released
System 1032 for Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s 32-bit VAX systems. Version 1.5 (1984) added EBCDIC support.

System 1032 was acquired by Computer Corporation of America (CCA) in 1992. In 2010, Rocket Software acquired CCA&#x27;s products, including System 1032. Rocket continue to develop and maintain System 1032 for the OpenVMS operating system.

Like 1022, it had a Host Language Interface (HLI).

<doc id="524768" wikidata="Q1236127" url="?curid=524768" title="Pimiento">
<text>A pimiento or pimento or cherry pepper is a variety of large, red, heart-shaped chili pepper (&quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;) that measures long and wide (medium, elongate).

== Description and habitat ==
Pimientos can have various colors including yellow, green, red, and maroon. Like most peppers, immature pods are green and develop other colors as they reach maturity.

The flesh of the pimiento is sweet, succulent, and more aromatic than that of the red bell pepper. Some varieties of the pimiento type are hot, including the Floral Gem and Santa Fe Grande varieties. 

Peppers grow in hardiness zones 4 through 12. 

==Name==
Spanish and Portuguese both come from Latin (&quot;pigment; coloring&quot;) and came to be used for bell peppers. The English borrowed &quot;pimiento&quot; and &quot;pimento&quot; as loanwords for what is distinguished in Spanish as and in Portuguese as .

Note that in Jamaican English &quot;pimento&quot; usually refers to allspice (&quot;Pimenta dioica&quot;).

==Uses==

&quot;Sweet&quot; (i.e., neither sour nor savory) pimiento peppers are the familiar red stuffing found in prepared Spanish or Greek green olives. Originally, the pimiento was hand-cut into tiny pieces, then hand-stuffed into each olive to balance out the olive&#x27;s otherwise strong, salty flavor. Despite the popularity of the combination, this production method was very costly and time-intensive.

More recently, for ease of production, pimientos are often puréed then formed into tiny strips, with the help of a natural gum (such as sodium alginate or guar gum). This allows olive stuffing to be mechanized, speeding the process and lowering production costs.

The fruits are typically used fresh as a salad ingredient, cooked, or pickled.

Pimientos are commonly used for making pimento cheese. It is also used for making pimento loaf, a type of processed sandwich meat.

<text>Howard Earl Gardner (born July 11, 1943) is an American developmental psychologist and the John H. and Elisabeth A. Hobbs Research Professor of Cognition and Education at Harvard University. He was a founding member of Harvard Project Zero in 1967 and held leadership roles at that research center from 1972 to 2023. Since 1995, he has been the co-director of The Good Project.

Gardner has written hundreds of research articles and over thirty books that have been translated into over thirty languages. He is best known for his theory of multiple intelligences, as outlined in his 1983 book &quot;Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences&quot;.

Gardner retired from teaching in 2019. In 2020, he published his intellectual memoir &quot;A Synthesizing Mind.&quot; He continues his research and writing, including several blogs.

==Early life and education==
Howard Earl Gardner was born July 11, 1943, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Ralph Gardner and Hilde (née Weilheimer) Gardner, German Jewish immigrants who fled Germany just prior to World War II.

Gardner described himself as &quot;a studious child who gained much pleasure from playing the piano&quot;. Although Gardner never became a professional pianist, he taught piano intermittently from 1958 to 1969.

Education was of the utmost importance in the Gardner home. While his parents had hoped that he would attend Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, Gardner opted to attend a school closer to his hometown in Pennsylvania, Wyoming Seminary. Gardner had a desire to learn and greatly excelled in school.

Gardner graduated from Harvard College with highest honors in 1965 with a BA in Social Relations, and studied under the renowned Erik Erikson. After spending one year at the London School of Economics, he went on to obtain his PhD in developmental psychology at Harvard while working with psychologists Roger Brown and Jerome Bruner, and philosopher Nelson Goodman.

== Career ==
For his postdoctoral fellowship, Gardner worked alongside neurologist Norman Geschwind at Boston Veterans Administration Hospital and continued his work there for another 20 years. In 1986, Gardner became a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Since 1995, much of the focus of his work has been on The GoodWork Project, now part of a larger initiative known as The Good Project that encourages excellence, ethics, and engagement in work, digital life, and civic society.

In 2000, Gardner, Kurt Fischer, and their colleagues at the Harvard Graduate School of Education established the master&#x27;s degree program in Mind, Brain, and Education. This program was thought to be the first of its kind around the world. Many universities in both the United States and abroad have since developed similar programs. Since then, Gardner has published books on a number of topics including &quot;Changing Minds: The Art and Science of Changing Our Own and Other People&#x27;s Minds&quot;, &quot;Five Minds for the Future, Truth, Beauty and Goodness Reframed,&quot; and &quot;The App Generation&quot; (written with Katie Davis).

Since 2012, Gardner has been co-directing a major study of higher education in the United States with Wendy Fischman and several other colleagues. Information about the study, including several dozen blogs, is available on Gardner&#x27;s website. In March 2022, MIT Press published Wendy Fischman and Howard Gardner&#x27;s book &quot;The Real World of College: What Higher Education Is and What It Can Be.&quot;

At the start of 2024, Gardner was the most cited Educational Scholar in the United States, according to the Edu-Scholar Public Influence Ratings.

In 2024, Teachers College Press will publish two collections of Gardner’s papers: &quot;The Essential Howard Gardner on Education&quot; and &quot;The Essential Howard Gardner on Mind&quot;.

===Theory and criticism===
According to Gardner&#x27;s theory of multiple intelligences, humans have several different ways of processing information, and these ways are relatively independent of one another. The theory is a critique of the standard intelligence theory, which emphasizes the correlation among abilities, as well as traditional measures like IQ tests that typically only account for linguistic, logical, and spatial abilities. Since 1999, Gardner has identified eight intelligences: linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, spatial, bodily/kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic. Gardner and colleagues have also considered two additional intelligences, existential and pedagogical. Many teachers, school administrators, and special educators have been inspired by Gardner&#x27;s theory of multiple intelligences.

Gardner&#x27;s definition of intelligence has been met with some criticism in education circles as well as in the field of psychology. Perhaps the strongest and most enduring critique of his theory of multiple intelligences centers on its lack of empirical evidence, much of which points to a single construct of intelligence called &quot;g&quot;. Gardner has responded that his theory is based entirely on empirical evidence as opposed to experimental evidence, as he does not believe experimental evidence in itself can yield a theoretical synthesis.

Gardner&#x27;s theory of multiple intelligences can be seen as both a departure from and a continuation of the 20th century&#x27;s work on the subject of human intelligence. Other prominent psychologists whose contributions variously developed or expanded the field of study include Charles Spearman, Louis Thurstone, Edward Thorndike, and Robert Sternberg.

In 1967, Professor Nelson Goodman started an educational program called Project Zero at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, which began with a focus in arts education and now spans a wide variety of educational arenas. Howard Gardner and David Perkins were founding Research Assistants and later Co-Directed Project Zero from 1972 to 2000. Project Zero&#x27;s mission is to understand and enhance learning, thinking, and creativity in the arts, as well as a broad range of humanistic and scientific disciplines at the individual and institutional levels.

For over two decades, in collaboration with William Damon, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, and several other colleagues, Gardner has been directing research at The Good Project on the nature of good work, good play, and good collaboration. The goal of his research is to determine what it means to achieve work that is at once excellent, engaging, and carried out in an ethical way. With colleagues Lynn Barendsen, Courtney Bither, Shelby Clark, Wendy Fischman, Carrie James, Kirsten McHugh, and Danny Mucinskas, Gardner has developed curricular toolkits on these topics for use in educational and professional circles.

==Achievements and awards==
In 1981 Gardner was the recipient of a MacArthur Prize Fellowship. In 1990 he became the first American to receive the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Education. In 1985, The National Psychology Awards for Excellence in the Media, awarded Gardner The Book Award for &quot;Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences&quot;. In 1987, he received the William James Award from the American Psychological Association. SUNY Plattsburgh inducted Gardner selected Gardner for &quot;honoris causa&quot; membership in Omicron Delta Kappa in 1998. In 1999, Gardner received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2000 he received a fellowship from the John S. Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Four years later he was named an Honorary Professor at East China Normal University in Shanghai. In the years 2005 and 2008 he was selected by Foreign Policy and Prospect magazines as one of the top 100 most influential public intellectuals in the world. In 2011, he won the Prince of Asturias Award in Social Sciences for his development of multiple intelligences theory. In 2015, he received the Brock International Prize in Education. In 2020, Gardner received the Distinguished Contributions to Research in Education Award from the American Education Research Association.

He has received honorary degrees from 31 colleges and universities around the world, including institutions in Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, South Korea, and Spain. He is also a member of several honorary societies: American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Philosophical Society, National Academy of Education, and the American Academy of Political and Social Science.

==Personal life==
Howard Gardner is married to Ellen Winner, Professor Emerita of Psychology at Boston College. They have one child, Benjamin. Gardner has three children from an earlier marriage: Kerith (1969), Jay (1971), and Andrew (1976); and five grandchildren: Oscar (2005), Agnes (2011), Olivia (2015), Faye Marguerite (2016), and August Pierre (2019).

<text>The voiced alveolar approximant is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the alveolar and postalveolar approximants is , a lowercase letter &quot;r&quot; rotated 180 degrees. The equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

The most common sound represented by the letter &quot;r&quot; in English is the voiced postalveolar approximant, pronounced a little more back and transcribed more precisely in IPA as , but is often used for convenience in its place. For further ease of typesetting, English phonemic transcriptions might use the symbol even though this symbol represents the alveolar trill in phonetic transcription.

The bunched or molar r sounds remarkably similar to the postalveolar approximant and can be described as a &quot;voiced labial pre-velar approximant with tongue-tip retraction&quot;. It can be transcribed in IPA as or .

==Features==

==Occurrence==

===Alveolar===
===Postalveolar===

As an allophone of other rhotic sounds, occurs in Edo, Fula, Murrinh-patha, and Palauan.

<text>The alveolar and dental ejective stops are types of consonantal sounds, usually described as voiceless, that are pronounced with a glottalic egressive airstream. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, ejectives are indicated with a &quot;modifier letter apostrophe&quot; ⟨ʼ⟩, as in this article. A reversed apostrophe is sometimes used to represent light aspiration, as in Armenian linguistics ⟨p‘ t‘ k‘⟩; this usage is obsolete in the IPA. In other transcription traditions, the apostrophe represents palatalization: ⟨pʼ⟩ = IPA ⟨pʲ⟩. In some Americanist traditions, an apostrophe indicates weak ejection and an exclamation mark strong ejection: ⟨k̓ , k!⟩. In the IPA, the distinction might be written ⟨kʼ, kʼʼ⟩, but it seems that no language distinguishes degrees of ejection.

In alphabets using the Latin script, an IPA-like apostrophe for ejective consonants is common. However, there are other conventions. In Hausa, the hooked letter ƙ is used for /kʼ/. In Zulu and Xhosa, whose ejection is variable between speakers, plain consonant letters are used: &quot;p t k ts tsh kr&quot; for /pʼ tʼ kʼ tsʼ tʃʼ kxʼ/. In some conventions for Haida and Hadza, double letters are used: &quot;tt kk qq ttl tts&quot; for /tʼ kʼ qʼ tɬʼ tsʼ/ (Haida) and &quot;zz jj dl gg&quot; for /tsʼ tʃʼ cʎ̥˔ʼ kxʼ/ (Hadza).

In Oromo /tʼ/ is written as ⟨x⟩.

==Features==
Features of the alveolar ejective:
* There are four specific variants of :
** Dental, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the upper teeth, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.
** Denti-alveolar, which means it is articulated with the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, and the tip of the tongue behind upper teeth.
** Alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.
** Postalveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.

<doc id="524780" wikidata="Q874996" url="?curid=524780" title="Voiced dental and alveolar taps and flaps">
<text>The voiced alveolar tap or flap is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents a dental, alveolar, or postalveolar tap or flap is .

The terms &quot;tap&quot; and &quot;flap&quot; are often used interchangeably. Peter Ladefoged proposed the distinction that a tap strikes its point of contact directly, as a very brief stop, and a flap strikes the point of contact tangentially: &quot;Flaps are most typically made by retracting the tongue tip behind the alveolar ridge and moving it forward so that it strikes the ridge in passing.&quot; That distinction between the alveolar tap and flap can be written in the IPA with tap and flap , the &#x27;retroflex&#x27; symbol being used for the one that starts with the tongue tip curled back behind the alveolar ridge. The distinction is noticeable in the speech of some American English speakers in distinguishing the words &quot;potty&quot; (tap ) and &quot;party&quot; (retroflex ).

For linguists who do not make the distinction, alveolars and dentals are typically called &quot;taps&quot; and other articulations &quot;flaps&quot;. No language contrasts a tap and a flap at the same place of articulation.

The sound is often analyzed and thus interpreted by non-native English-speakers as an &#x27;R-sound&#x27; in many foreign languages. In languages for which the segment is present but not phonemic, it is often an allophone of either an alveolar stop (, , or both) or a rhotic consonant (like the alveolar trill or the alveolar approximant).

If the alveolar flap is the only rhotic consonant in the language, it may be transcribed with although that symbol technically represents the trill.

The voiced alveolar tapped fricative reported from some languages is actually a very brief voiced alveolar non-sibilant fricative.

== Voiced alveolar tap and flap ==
=== Features ===
Features of the voiced alveolar tap or flap:

* Its manner of articulation is tap or flap, which means it is produced with a single contraction of the muscles so that the tongue makes very brief contact.
* Its place of articulation is dental or alveolar, which means it is articulated behind upper front teeth or at the alveolar ridge. It is most often apical, which means that it is pronounced with the tip of the tongue.

<text>The voiced alveolar nasal is a type of consonantal sound used in numerous spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents dental, alveolar, and postalveolar nasals is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

The vast majority of languages have either an alveolar or dental nasal. There are a few languages that lack either sound but have , such as Yoruba, Palauan, and colloquial Samoan (however, these languages all have . An example of a language without and is Edo). There are some languages (e.g. Rotokas) that lack both and .

True dental consonants are relatively uncommon. In the Romance, Dravidian, and Australian languages, &quot;n&quot; is often called &quot;dental&quot; in the literature. However, the rearmost contact, which gives a consonant its distinctive sound, is actually alveolar or denti-alveolar. The difference between the Romance languages and English is not so much where the tongue contacts the roof of the mouth but the part of the tongue that makes contact. In English, it is the tip of the tongue (such sounds are termed apical), but in the Romance languages, it is the flat of the tongue just above the tip (such sounds are called laminal).

However, there are languages with true apical (or less commonly laminal) dental &quot;n&quot;. It is found in the Mapuche language of South America, where it is actually interdental. A true dental generally occurs allophonically before in the languages that have it, as in English &quot;tenth&quot;. Similarly, a denti-alveolar allophone occurs in languages that have denti-alveolar stops, as in Spanish &quot;cinta&quot;.

Some languages contrast laminal denti-alveolar and apical alveolar nasals. For example, in the Malayalam pronunciation of &quot;Nārāyanan&quot;, the first &quot;n&quot; is dental, the second is retroflex, and the third alveolar.

A postalveolar nasal occurs in a number of Australian Aboriginal languages, including Djeebbana and Jingulu.

==Features==
Features of the voiced alveolar nasal:
* There are four specific variants of :
** Dental, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the upper teeth, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.
** Denti-alveolar, which means it is articulated with the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, and the tip of the tongue behind upper teeth.
** Alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.
** Postalveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.

<doc id="524783" wikidata="Q918448" url="?curid=524783" title="Denomination (currency)">
<text>Denomination is a proper description of a currency amount, usually for coins or banknotes. Denominations may also be used with other means of payment such as gift cards. For example, &quot;five euros&quot; is the denomination of a five-euro note.

==Subunit and super unit==
In a currency, there is usually a main unit (base) and a subunit that is a fraction of the main unit. In some countries, there are multiple levels of subunits. In the former Ottoman Empire, 1 lira = 100 [kuruş] = 4000 para = 12000 [akçe]. Today, only a few places have more than one subunit, notably the Jordanian dinar is divided into 10 dirham, 100 qirsh/piastres, or 1000 fils. Many countries where Western European languages are spoken currently have their main units divided into 100 subunits. Some currencies that previously had subunits no longer do, because inflation has rendered the subunit useless. A prominent example is the Japanese yen, which was formerly divided into 100 sen or 1000 rin. Both subunits were demonetized at the end of 1953.

Occasionally, a super unit is used as a multiple of the main unit. Examples include Korean won = 5 yang in 1893, Iranian toman = 10 rials (used informally today). In the Ottoman Empire, lira and kuruş were super units at some point before becoming the main unit.

In the Indian subcontinent, it is common in Hindustani, as well as in both Indian and Pakistani English for large amounts of money to be discussed in lakhs and crores rather than in rupees. While they are not official denominations, they are drawn from the customary numerical system and are widely understood and utilised in the Indian, Pakistani, and Nepalese financial systems.

==Decimal vs. non-decimal==
A decimal currency is a currency where the ratio between the main unit and the subunit is an integral power of 10. Non-decimal currencies are now rare but had some advantages in daily life transactions. For example, 1 South German Gulden = 60 Kreuzer. 60 can be divided into 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 or 30 parts that are still integers, making pricing easy. This advantage (in an age without mechanical or electronic calculators) and the lack of widespread accurate weighing apparatus (meaning an item might sometimes simply be divided in 2, 4, 5 etc.) coupled with tradition were the reasons why non-decimal currencies were used.

In theory, two countries currently use non-decimal currency: Mauritania (1 ouguiya = 5 khoums) and Madagascar (1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja). In practice, however, the value of the main unit in each case is so low (less than 1/1000 of a United States dollar) that the sub-unit is not of any practical use and is rarely seen in circulation. In the case of the iraimbilanja, this is a carryover of the Madagascar&#x27;s previous currency, the Malagasy franc, which had the ariary as a super unit worth 5 francs, and iraimbilanja was an alternate term for the franc. The last major countries to use non-decimal currencies in practice were the United Kingdom (until 1971), Ireland (1971), Malta (1972) and Nigeria (1973).

The &quot;optimal denomination problem&quot; is a problem for people who design entirely new currencies: What denominations should be chosen for the coins to minimize the average effort required to change into smaller denominations. As of 2014, most decimal currencies use a 1-2-5 series of coins, but some other set of denominations would require fewer denominations of coins or a smaller average number of coins to make change or both. Denominations of 3, 15 or 25 units are also in existence, or have been until recently.

== Display on coins ==
Traditionally, denomination was not displayed on coins, although names of coins (such as drachma, ass, sestertius etc.) were used both in colloquial and official language. It was only in the 1600s that Scandinavian coins began to display relative value to the smaller units (8, 16 skilling etc.) because there were many of them in circulation.

The monetary reform of Peter the Great in the Russian Empire not only established a strictly decimal monetary system (which was rather uncommon in other states back in those times) but made the display of denomination (the &quot;face value&quot;) mandatory on all coins. By the end of the 18th century denomination appeared on most coins in Europe and the Ottoman Empire, and in the 19th century it became a common practice.

By the end of the 20th century, coins were mostly distinguished from medals or tokens by presence of denomination, either in monetary units or (for commemorative or bullion coins only) in the weight of a valuable metal. Exceptions are quite rare: for example, British commemorative crowns (or 25 pence coins after the decimal reform) traditionally do not display any face value, and are only recognized as such due to their typical size.

==Choice of name==
It is common to name a unit with a unit of weight, such as pound, lira, and baht. In most cases, these currencies were originally defined as that amount of some precious metal. Another choice of name is some form of derivative of the political entity. The Afghan afghani and European euro fall into this category. Sometimes the name is simply the name of the metal of which the coins were or are made, such as Polish złoty (&quot;golden&quot;) and Vietnamese đồng (&quot;copper&quot;), or its geographical origin, e.g. Joachimsthaler (see Dollar).

<doc id="524784" wikidata="Q113159186" url="?curid=524784" title="Voiced dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills">
<text>The voiced alveolar trill is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents dental, alveolar, and postalveolar trills is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. It is commonly called the rolled R, rolling R, or trilled R. Quite often, is used in phonemic transcriptions (especially those found in dictionaries) of languages like English and German that have rhotic consonants that are not an alveolar trill. That is partly for ease of typesetting and partly because is the letter used in the orthographies of such languages.

In many Indo-European languages, a trill may often be reduced to a single vibration in unstressed positions. In Italian, a simple trill typically displays only one or two vibrations, while a geminate trill will have three or more. Languages where trills always have multiple vibrations include Albanian, Spanish, Cypriot Greek, and a number of Armenian and Portuguese dialects.

People with ankyloglossia may find it exceptionally difficult to articulate the sound because of the limited mobility of their tongues.

==Voiced alveolar trill==

===Features===
Features of the voiced alveolar trill:
* Its place of articulation may be 
: dental (behind the upper front teeth),
: alveolar (at the alveolar ridge), or 
: post-alveolar (behind the alveolar ridge). 
* It is most often apical, which means it is pronounced with the tip of the tongue.

===Occurrence===
====Dental====
====Alveolar====
====Post-alveolar====

====Variable====
==Voiced alveolar fricative trill ==
In Czech, there are two contrasting alveolar trills. Besides the typical apical trill, written &quot;r&quot;, there is another laminal trill, written &quot;ř&quot;, in words such as &quot;rybáři&quot; &#x27;fishermen&#x27; and the common surname &quot;Dvořák&quot;. Its manner of articulation is similar to but is laminal and the body of the tongue is raised. It is thus partially fricative, with the frication sounding rather like but less retracted. It sounds like a simultaneous and , and some speakers tend to pronounce it as , , or . In the IPA, it is typically written as plus the raising diacritic, , but it has also been written as laminal . (Before the 1989 IPA Kiel Convention, it had a dedicated symbol .) The Kobon language of Papua New Guinea also has a fricative trill, but the degree of frication is variable.

===Features===
Features of the voiced alveolar fricative trill:
*Its manner of articulation is fricative trill, which means it is a non-sibilant fricative and a trill pronounced simultaneously.
* Its place of articulation is laminal alveolar, which means it is articulated with the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge.

<text>The CRV7, short for &quot;Canadian Rocket Vehicle 7&quot;, is a 2.75-inch (70 mm) folding-fin ground attack rocket produced by Bristol Aerospace in Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was introduced in the early 1970s as an upgraded version of the standard U.S. 2.75-inch air-to-ground rocket. It was the most powerful weapon of its class, the first with enough energy to penetrate standard Warsaw Pact aircraft hangars. The CRV7 remains one of the most powerful air-to-ground attack rockets to this day, and has slowly become the de facto standard for Western-aligned forces outside the United States. Beginning in 2021, 83,303 stored Canadian CRV7s are slated for disposal, having been removed from service from 2005 to 2007. In 2024 the Department of National Defence was considering donating the rockets to Ukraine as military aid to defend against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. An estimated 8,000 rockets have functioning warheads, while the remainder could be used for parts or modification.
In September 2024 Canadian defence minister Bill Blair announced Canada would be sending 80,840 rocket motors to Ukraine over the next months, in addition to the 2,100 already shipped, along with 1,300 warheads.

==Development==
The CRV7 was an offshoot of late 1950s research at CARDE (now DRDC Valcartier) into high-performance solid fuel rockets, research performed as a part of a general program studying anti-ballistic missiles. With Aerojet&#x27;s assistance, CARDE and Bristol developed the &quot;Propulsion Test Vehicle&quot; to test new fuel and engine designs. This program led to the development of the Black Brant sounding rocket, which first flew in 1960 and has had a long and successful career since then. Engineer Jose Tharayil from Bristol Aerospace is considered the driving force behind the CRV7&#x27;s development and production.

In the early 1970s, CARDE and Bristol decided to use the same propellant and engine design for a new 2.75-inch rocket to equip the Canadair CF-104 Starfighter. The resulting RLU-5001/B (C-14) engine was first delivered by Bristol in production form in 1973. It had a total impulse of 2,320 lbf·s (10.3 kN·s) and a burn time of 2.2 seconds. The empty weight of the rocket is 6.6 kg, and it is normally equipped with a 10 lb (4.5 kg) high-explosive warhead taken from U.S. rockets.
Compared to the U.S. Mk 40 FFAR &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; rockets the CRV7 replaced, the higher energy fuel and newer fuselage design led to a longer and much flatter trajectory, with twice the energy on impact. Its maximum effective range is over 4,000 m, allowing launch from beyond the envelope of most short-range anti-aircraft weapons. In comparison, the Mighty Mouse or Hydra 70 requires launches from much shorter ranges, potentially placing the launch aircraft within the range of ground-based weapons arranged around the target.

Unguided rockets are normally spin stabilized like rifle bullets. The spin is imparted by small fins at the rear of the rocket body that flip out into the airstream once the rocket leaves its launch tube. The fins take a short time to open and more time to start the rocket spinning. During this period, the rockets can drift significantly from their original aim point. The CRV7 solved this problem by adding small vanes projecting into the rocket exhaust to start the rocket spinning even before it left the launch tube, greatly increasing accuracy. A salvo of CRV7&#x27;s will impact the target area in one-third the footprint of older designs.

The weapon was originally quoted to have a dispersion of 4 milliradians, but testing with the McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet demonstrated it was even lower, at 3 milliradians. This is considerably better than the autocannon that arm most aircraft; the widely used 20mm M61 Vulcan is rated at 8 milliradians, while the much larger and considerably heavier 30mm GAU-8 Avenger is rated at 5 milliradians.

The CRV7 had just been introduced into Royal Canadian Air Force service when it was entered as a part of a general competition in France. One part of the competition required the contestants to hit a tower with unarmed rockets. The Canadian pilot hit it on his first try, but aimed as if firing the much lower-powered Mk 40 and was therefore close enough that the rocket motor was still firing. The remaining unburned propellant shattered, allowing more surface area of the rocket motor to burn, in turn increasing the pressure and rate of combustion until it became a deflagration that destroyed the tower. The pilot was disqualified because the judges refused to believe it was unarmed.

==Engine development==

The aluminium-based fuel in the C-14 engine generated considerable amounts of smoke. While suitable for high-speed aircraft that quickly clear the plume, it is not suitable for slower aircraft and helicopters which would be flying in the smoke for some period of time. This problem led to the development of the RLU-5002/B (C-15) engine, which did not include aluminium and produced considerably less smoke, with a slightly lower impulse of 2,185 lbf·s (9.7 kN·s). The original C-15 used a tail-mounted igniter that was ejected by the rocket when it was fired. In some cases the igniter would hit the aircraft, causing minor damage. To address this, the RLU-5002A/B (HEPI) was introduced, with a &quot;Head-End Permanent Igniter&quot; that is not ejected on launch.

The latest C-17 and C-18 engines for helicopter use offer somewhat lower impulse at 1,905 lbf·s (8.5 kN·s), but with almost no smoke at all.

==Warheads==

The primary warhead for the original CRV7 was the U.S. M151 High Explosive Point Detonating (HEPD) round, a simple impact-fired 10 lb (4.5 kg) high-explosive shell. Like the U.S. 2.75-inch (70 mm) weapons, the CRV7 could also be equipped with the M156 Smoke or M257/278 Illumination (flare) rounds. Bristol also introduced their own WTU-5001/B Practice round, consisting of an flat-ended soft steel rod encased in a nylon fairing, and later introduced a similar version with a hardened steel rod, the WTU-5001A/B. These rounds matched the ballistics of the M151 for training purposes and were widely used during the development and introduction of the weapon to the Canadian Forces.

Bristol followed this with the WDU-50001/B &quot;Anti-Bunkerette&quot; round, a semi-armor-piercing high-explosive incendiary (SAPHEI/HEISAP) warhead designed for use against reinforced concrete buildings, specifically hardened aircraft shelters. Its heavy steel shell allows the round to penetrate the hangar wall before the 75 g incendiary warhead is ignited. The round can penetrate of earth, of concrete, and of steel, in series.

The CRV7&#x27;s kinetic energy was so high that testers were surprised to find that practice rounds fitted with an steel rod were penetrating outdated Centurion tanks used for target practice. This resulted in the development of a dedicated antitank warhead that replaced the steel rod in the practice warhead with a tungsten rod. This new antitank warhead could penetrate a Soviet T-72 main battle tank armour from any attack angle. Further study into this effect led to the WDU-5002/B FAT warhead, &quot;Flechette Anti-Tank&quot;, containing five tungsten-reinforced steel flechettes that could penetrate a T-72&#x27;s side and top armour at a distance of . It was also found to be a useful warhead for use against medium and light armoured vehicles. Further development led to the WDU-500X/B &quot;General Purpose Flechette&quot; which releases 80 tungsten flechettes that can penetrate of roll-hardened armor for use against personnel, some light armour, thin-skinned vehicles, and helicopters.

Bristol also re-sells the RA-79 from Raufoss Ammunisjonsfabrikker, a semi-armor-piercing round designed to attack shipping.

The CRV7 Multi-Purpose Sub Munition (MPSM) contained nine M73 submunitions in each rocket. It could therefore be classified as a cluster bomb. Britain destroyed the last of its CRV7 MPSMs in July 2009 in accordance with its interpretation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

==Guided version==
In 2006 Bristol started testing a new version of the CRV7, the CRV7-PG. The weapon was introduced at Eurosatory 2006. Bristol&#x27;s current owners, Magellan Aerospace, offered it for sale starting in 2007.

The PG version, for &quot;precision guided&quot;, adds a seeker developed by Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace to the front of any version of an otherwise unmodified CRV7. The seeker uses a simple inertial guidance system through the midcourse and homes during the terminal approach using a laser designator. Other versions offer anti-radiation seeking or GPS guidance. The precision guided kit includes the addition of tail fins and an in-flight control system. Combining the laser seeker with the FAT warhead produces a capable long-range anti-tank missile that is faster and much less expensive than traditional platforms like the AGM-114 Hellfire.

A version of the CRV7-PG was also developed for special forces use, fired from a single tube mounted on a 6 x 6 vehicle.

<text>Federico Castelluccio (; ; born April 29, 1964) is an Italian-born American actor. He is best known for his role as Furio Giunta on the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Naples, Italy, Castelluccio moved with his family to Paterson, New Jersey, when he was three years old. In 1982, Castelluccio was awarded a full scholarship to the School of Visual Arts in New York City, where he earned a BFA in painting and media arts. Prior to winning the scholarship, he received an opportunity to create a painting for actor George Burns.

==Career==
Castelluccio began his career as an actor in 1986. Some of his film credits include &quot;Made&quot; with Jon Favreau, &quot;Fire&quot; with Paul Campbell and &quot;18 Shades of Dust&quot; with Danny Aiello. In television, his credits include &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; and his best known role, in the HBO hit series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, as the Neapolitan enforcer Furio Giunta.

He also appeared in &quot;A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints&quot; which debuted in 2006 at the Sundance Film Festival and received two awards, one for best dramatic directing and another for best dramatic ensemble, headed by Robert Downey Jr., Chazz Palminteri, and Rosario Dawson.

Other film projects include the biographical &quot;El Cantante&quot;; &quot;Aftermath&quot;, a crime thriller; and &quot;The Obscure Brother&quot;, filmed in southern Italy, a short film that he executive produced and acted in; 2003&#x27;s &quot;La Araña&quot;; the 2008 comedy &quot;Capers&quot;; &quot;Lucky Days&quot;; and the 2009 &quot;Forget Me Not&quot;. In television, Castelluccio played the lead role in &quot;Dragon Dynasty&quot;, a telefilm that aired on the Sci-Fi Channel. He also appeared in the episode of &quot;Kenny Vs. Spenny&quot; titled &quot;Who Can Produce The Best Commercial&quot;.

In 2014, Castelluccio acted in Don Capria&#x27;s short film &quot;Eulogy,&quot; acting alongside Michael Kaves. With the rest of the cast, they won Best Ensemble at the Queens World Film Festival.

In 2016, Castelluccio directed the feature film &quot;The Brooklyn Banker&quot;. In 2017, Castelluccio directed the TV pilot &quot;Outcall&quot;.

During the fourth season of &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, Castelluccio was asked by Donald Trump to judge which celebrity designed the best hat. Castelluccio eventually chose La Toya Jackson. She was awarded $25,000 for her charity, the AIDS Project Los Angeles.

==Painting discovery ==

Castelluccio discovered a 17th-century painting by Italian baroque painter Guercino at a Frankfurt gallery and subsequently purchased it at auction in 2014 after it had been incorrectly identified as an 18th-century painting. He purchased the painting for approximately $68,000. After restoration, insurance, shipping, and other expenses, his total costs came to $140,000. The work&#x27;s actual value was subsequently placed at approximately $10 million.

<text>Daniel Saul Goldin (born July 23, 1940) served as the 9th and longest-tenured Administrator of NASA from April 1, 1992, to November 17, 2001. He was appointed by President George H. W. Bush and also served under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He is an entrepreneur and technologist. Most recently, he is the founder of Cold Canyon AI, an innovation advisory company. His career has spanned numerous technologies and businesses in space science, aeronautics, national security, semiconductors, and artificial intelligence.

==Early life==
Born in New York City, Goldin earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from the City College of New York in 1962.

==Career==
He began his career at NASA&#x27;s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio that year (1962), and worked on electric propulsion systems for human interplanetary travel. Goldin left NASA after five years to work at the TRW Space and Technology Group in Redondo Beach, California. Goldin spent 25 years at TRW, climbing to the position of Vice President and General Manager. There, he spent much of his time on classified military and intelligence space programs. 

He was NASA Administrator from 1992 to 2001, and was known for his support for a &quot;Faster, better, cheaper&quot; philosophy. He was known as a demanding but efficient manager.

Upon joining NASA, Goldin reflected on the failed Mars Observer project and described his dissatisfaction with the agency&#x27;s workflow: &quot;so much is riding on each flight that NASA can&#x27;t afford to have them fail — leading to more caution, delay, and expense.&quot; He said to make spacecraft smaller, lighter, and inexpensive, so that NASA could take more risks and not fear making mistakes. He encouraged the team defining what would become the James Webb Space Telescope to use a larger beryllium mirror.

<doc id="524804" wikidata="Q4932101" url="?curid=524804" title="Bob Cole (sportscaster)">
<text>Robert Cecil Cole (June 24, 1933 – April 24, 2024) was a Canadian sports television announcer who worked for CBC and Sportsnet and a competitive curler. He was known primarily for his work on National Hockey League&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; and Olympic ice hockey.

==Early life==
Cole was born in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, on June 24, 1933. A knee injury suffered from playing soccer put Cole in the hospital for approximately six months as a youth. It was during this time that he would listen to Foster Hewitt calling games on the radio and developed an interest in becoming a sports announcer. In 1956, Cole made an impromptu visit to Hewitt&#x27;s office to present him with an audition tape. To Cole&#x27;s surprise, Hewitt welcomed him in, listened to his tape, and talked with him for two hours.

==Ice hockey==

===&quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;===
Cole began broadcasting hockey on VOCM radio in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, then CBC Radio in 1969 and moved to television in 1973 when &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; (&quot;HNIC&quot;) expanded its coverage. Cole was the lead play-by-play announcer for &quot;HNIC&quot; on CBC, usually working Toronto Maple Leafs games, from 1980 to 2008. Aside from the Leafs broadcasts, he was also a staple for &quot;HNIC&quot; during the annual Stanley Cup playoffs. He broadcast at least one game in every Stanley Cup Finals from 1980 until 2008, after which he was replaced by Jim Hughson.

In November 2013, Rogers Communications reached a 12-year deal to become the exclusive national television and digital rightsholder for the NHL in Canada, beginning with the 2014–15 season. Although now at the age of 82, Cole told the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; that he wanted Rogers to call and tell him if he would be a part of their hockey coverage: &quot;I still feel the same as when I was 50. I still love what I&#x27;m doing. I just want to do games.&quot; Cole later stated, &quot;I&#x27;d like to keep going. I feel good. I love the game. I still get passionate. I still get butterflies.&quot; In June 2014, Rogers confirmed that Cole would be part of their play-by-play team.

Sportsnet did not give any on-air assignments to Cole during the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs. On September 27, 2018, Sportsnet announced that he would be calling his 50th and last season with &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; and a limited schedule of games in the upcoming season.

On February 6, 2019, he received a video tribute and a standing ovation, during the Toronto Maple Leafs – Ottawa Senators game, on the occasion of calling his last game in Toronto, with his final play-by-play broadcast being the Toronto Maple Leafs-Montreal Canadiens game on April 6 at Bell Centre. That night, the Montreal Canadiens beat the Toronto Maple Leafs by a score of 6–5 in a shootout. This game also happened to hold historical significance, as Canadiens forward Ryan Poehling scored a hat trick and a shootout goal in what was his first NHL game. Cole&#x27;s broadcasting career spanned 50 years.

===Olympics===
Cole&#x27;s work during CBC&#x27;s broadcasts of the Olympic ice hockey have also become memorable among legions of Canadians. His call on the final shot of the shootout in the semi-final game of the 1998 Winter Olympics at Nagano between Canada and the Czech Republic represented Canada&#x27;s then-ongoing failure at the games and haunted fans for the next four years. With Canada scoreless in the shootout and Brendan Shanahan representing their last chance, Cole said in a panicked voice as Shanahan skated in towards Czech goalie Dominik Hasek, &quot;He&#x27;s gotta score, that&#x27;s all!&quot; But Shanahan was stopped by Hasek, prompting Cole to dejectedly say &quot;No, he can&#x27;t do it.&quot;

At the gold medal game of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City between Canada and the United States, Cole&#x27;s animated call of Joe Sakic&#x27;s second goal of the game is also one of his more memorable moments. Also, when Jarome Iginla scored Canada&#x27;s fourth goal of the game, with four minutes remaining in the third period, Cole was so excited when the goal was scored he yelled out &quot;GORE!&quot; (a hybrid of &quot;goal&quot; and &quot;score&quot;), and then proceeded to call out &quot;Goal, Canada! Goal! Wow! A lot of Canadian fans here! The place goes crazy here in Salt Lake City, and I guess coast to coast in Canada, and all around the world!&quot; When Sakic scored Canada&#x27;s fifth goal with 1:20 remaining, Cole yelled out &quot;Scores! Joe Sakic scores! And that makes it 5–2 Canada! Surely, that&#x27;s gotta be it!&quot; As the final seconds of the game ticked away, and as the crowd broke out in perfect unison singing &quot;O Canada&quot;, Cole said, &quot;Now after 50 years, it&#x27;s time for Canada to stand up and cheer. Stand up and cheer everybody! The Olympics Salt Lake City, 2002, men&#x27;s ice hockey, gold medal: Canada!&quot;

With an average Canadian audience of 10.6 million viewers, that game was the most-watched CBC Sports program, beating the previous record of 4.957 million viewers for Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals (the final game of the 1972 Summit Series between an NHL all-star team and the Soviet Union, which had been the most-watched sports program Canadian television history, was simulcast on CBC and CTV while Cole called the game on CBC Radio), in which the New York Rangers won their first Stanley Cup in 54 years, beating the Vancouver Canucks, another moment Cole himself called: &quot;Here comes the faceoff and blare it Manhattan! The New York Rangers have done it here on a hot June night in New York! The Rangers are Stanley Cup Champions!&quot;

===Colour commentators===
Cole&#x27;s long-time colour commentator on &quot;HNIC&quot; was Harry Neale, who first teamed up in the 1986–87 season. From 1987 to 2007, the pair together called 20 Stanley Cup Finals, the 1998, 2002, 2006 Winter Olympics, the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, and 2004 World Cup of Hockey for CBC. Prior to that, his usual partners included Gary Dornhoefer, Mickey Redmond, or John Davidson. Dick Irvin Jr. also often joined his broadcast team as a third man in the booth for big games. Following the departures of Neale and Irvin, Jr., his usual broadcast partners were either Garry Galley or Greg Millen.

==Curling==
Prior to his career in broadcasting, Cole was a successful curler, playing in the 1971 and 1975 Briers as the skip for the Newfoundland team. In 1971, he led his team of Les Bowering, Ken Ellis and Alex Andrews to a 4–6 record. At the 1975 Brier, he led his team of Joseph Power Jr., Andrews and Andrew Baird to a 1–10 record. He also played in the 1965 and 1973 Canadian mixed championship, playing second for Dave Pedley in 1965 and skipping in 1973. The Pedley-led rink finished with a 4–6 record at the 1965 Mixed, and Cole led Newfoundland to a 4–6 record at the 1973 Mixed.

==Death==
Cole died in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador due to natural causes on April 24, 2024; he was 90.

==Awards==
In 2007, Cole captured his first Gemini Award in the area of Sports Play-by-Play.

Cole was honoured in the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996 as the recipient of the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for broadcasting excellence.

In 2022, he was named the recipient of the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award at the 10th Canadian Screen Awards.

==Other==
Cole received an honorary Doctorate of Laws from Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John&#x27;s in October 2002.

In early 2016, Cole had a cameo at the end of Simple Plan&#x27;s album &quot;Taking One for the Team&quot;, calling a fictional hockey game involving the band; he concluded the call with, &quot;Oh my goodness, can you believe it? Just like that, Simple Plan have won the game!&quot;.

On September 23, 2016, Cole was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada.

From 2010 to 2014, Cole was the Voice of the Republic on the CBC TV series &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot;. His voice could also be heard in the CBC 2013 TV film &quot;The Magic Hockey Skates&quot; (based on the book of the same name).

<text>The Conservative Party of Newfoundland was a political party in the Dominion of Newfoundland prior to confederation with Canada in 1949.

The party was formed by members and supporters of the establishment around 1832. In the 1840s, they opposed the proposal for responsible government which was finally granted in 1855. Since the concept was opposed generally by members of the Anglican establishment, the early party was almost entirely Protestant. As politics in Newfoundland developed along sectarian lines, the Conservatives became the Protestant party (with strong links to the Orange Order), while the Liberals were the Catholic party.

Under Sir Frederick Carter, the Conservatives supported joining Canadian confederation, and campaigned on the proposal in the 1869 general election. The party was badly defeated by Charles Fox Bennett&#x27;s Anti-Confederation Party. The Conservatives returned to power in 1874, but never proposed joining Canada again.

The Conservative party later absorbed the rival Liberals, putting an end to sectarian divisions with a &#x27;denominational compromise&#x27;.

The united party collapsed in the 1880s when members of the Orange Order abandoned the government of William Whiteway, and formed a new Reform Party under Robert Thorburn. The Reform Party won the 1885 election on a platform of &#x27;Protestant Rights&#x27;.

Whiteway founded a new Liberal Party after the collapse of the Reform Party. Members of the Orange Order formed a new Tory Party, which formed two short-lived administrations in the 1890s before disappearing.

Individual Conservatives were elected as Opposition or United Opposition MHAs before being subsumed into the Newfoundland People&#x27;s Party (later the Liberal-Labour-Progressive Party) formed by Edward Patrick Morris in 1907 after he resigned from the Liberal government of Sir Robert Bond.

In 1924, the Liberal-Conservative-Progressive Party was formed by members of the LLP Party who were largely conservatives and discontented members of the ruling Liberal Reform Party. This new party won the 1924 general election, making its leader Walter Stanley Monroe the new prime minister. In practice, the party was essentially a Tory party.

The party was defeated in 1928 under new leader Frederick C. Alderdice, but returned to power in 1932 as the United Newfoundland Party (UNP). The UNP ruled for two years until the suspension of responsible government.

When responsible government was suspended, Newfoundland&#x27;s status as an independent dominion within the British Empire was brought to an end. The Government of the United Kingdom appointed a Commission of Government to govern Newfoundland, bringing an end to party politics on the island.

Party politics returned to Newfoundland when it joined Canadian confederation in 1949. At this time, the modern Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties were formed. These new parties were unrelated to the parties that existed prior to 1934.

<doc id="524813" wikidata="Q392915" url="?curid=524813" title="Broken Arrow (1996 film)">
<text>Broken Arrow is a 1996 American action-thriller film directed by John Woo, written by Graham Yost, and starring John Travolta, Christian Slater, and Samantha Mathis. The film&#x27;s main themes include the theft of two American nuclear weapons, the attempts of U.S. military authorities to recover them, and the feud between Travolta and Slater&#x27;s characters. The film was a commercial success despite mixed reviews.

==Plot==
Major Vic &quot;Deak&quot; Deakins and Captain Riley Hale, pilots from Whiteman Air Force Base, are flying a stealth bomber with two B83 nuclear bombs on a secret exercise. After evading Air Force radar, Deakins suddenly attacks Hale and ejects him from the plane. Deakins releases the bombs without activating them and then reports that Hale has gone rogue. He ejects, leaving the plane to crash in a national park in Utah.

A USAF team led by Chief Master Sergeant Rhodes is sent to find the missing warheads, and a &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; situation is declared. The team locates the warheads in a canyon, but is ambushed by mercenaries. Rhodes tries to disable the warheads, but is killed by the other search team survivor, Master Sergeant Kelly, who is a mole for Deakins. Deakins arrives with Pritchett, the mercenaries&#x27; financier. They plan to blackmail the United States government with the threat of detonating the warhead in a populated area.

Hale is arrested by park ranger Terry Carmichael, but convinces her to help him track down Deakins. Deakins&#x27; mercenaries commandeer a search-and-rescue helicopter to kill Hale, but Hale and Carmichael manage to bring it down, forcing Deakins&#x27; men to continue in Humvees.

Hale and Carmichael carjack the Humvee carrying the warheads, escaping to a nearby abandoned copper mine. Hale starts to disable one warhead, but Deakins reveals via radio that he has programmed it so that Hale&#x27;s attempts to disarm it will instead cause the bomb to &quot;activate&quot;. Hale and Carmichael take the armed warhead down the shaft, where the mine is deep enough to contain the nuclear blast. Deakins&#x27;s team arrives and secures the second warhead. After a gun battle deep in the mine, Deakins shortens the countdown of the armed warhead while leaving Hale and Carmichael trapped. However, they escape via an underground river just before the bomb detonates. The resulting nuclear electromagnetic pulse downs an approaching NEST helicopter, allowing Deakins to escape. Deakins then kills Pritchett, having grown tired of his complaints. Carmichael and Hale track the mercenaries to a motorboat used for transporting the warhead down the river. While trying to steal the boat, Carmichael is forced to hide onboard, while military forces rescue Hale.

Hale deduces that Deakins intends to use a train to transport the warhead. Colonel Max Wilkins disobeys orders to help Hale. Stowing away on the train, Carmichael tries to sabotage the warhead, but is caught by Deakins, who arms it. Catching up on a helicopter, Hale saves Carmichael before Deakins can kill her. A gunfight ensues, killing Wilkins and causing the helicopter to crash, with most of the mercenaries dying in the aftermath.

Deakins has prepared a remote control that can either disarm or detonate the warhead and prepares to leave on his own getaway helicopter. Hale sabotages the helicopter&#x27;s fuel pump, causing it to explode and leaving Deakins and Kelly stranded with the ticking bomb. With his plan falling apart, Deakins decides to shorten the countdown timer out of spite. Kelly orders Deakins at gunpoint to disarm the weapon. Hale sneaks up on them during their bickering and kicks Kelly out of the boxcar to his death before engaging in a gun battle with Deakins.

Carmichael detaches the section of the train with the bomb, but gets into a shootout with the engineer. The engineer is killed and falls on the train brakes, allowing the detached boxcars to catch up. Deakins still has the remote detonator, so he forces Hale to drop his gun and challenges him to a fight. Hale eventually overpowers Deakins despite losing a boxing match at the start, acquires the remote detonator, disarms the warhead, and leaps out of the train. Carmichael also jumps from the train before the detached boxcars catch up and collide. The hurtling warhead flies through Deakins into a stack of oil barrels, causing the train to derail and the barrels to explode, killing him.

After the explosion, Hale and Carmichael embrace and formally introduce each other for the first time.

==Music==
The original music score was composed by Hans Zimmer. An expanded double-disc limited set of the music score was released by La-La Land Records in February 2011.

The score is considered to be one of Zimmer&#x27;s best action scores by fans and film critics. The opening track, &quot;Rope-A-Dope&quot;, also known as &quot;Deakin&#x27;s Theme&quot;, has been widely used in other films and media, including &quot;Scream 2&quot; and &quot;Speed 2&quot;. The famous riff from &quot;Rope-A-Dope&quot; was played by guitarist Duane Eddy, who Zimmer brought in for the entire &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; scoring session.

While looking back at the score, Zimmer said: “It was &quot;big man&quot; music. The guitar sound as well. I always thought Ennio [Morricone] wanted to work with Duane Eddy. So I just got the real Duane Eddy. In the score, you&#x27;ll hear him plucking away. And it was great fun.“ He concludes by: “My intent was just make the film fun, when there&#x27;s no real story to tell.“

==Production==
In July 1993, it was reported that 20th Century Fox had made a deal with &quot;Speed&quot; screenwriter Graham Yost for his next script later revealed to be &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; and also produced by &quot;Speed&quot; producer Mark Gordon.

Principal photography began on April 26, 1995. Some filming took place in and around the mountain areas of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Kane County, Utah. The lake scene with Hale and Carmichael was filmed at Lake Powell. The desert sequences were shot in the Mojave Desert near Barstow, California, and in Coconino County near Page, Arizona. The final climax scenes with Deakins and his men on the train, including the action sequence with Deakins and Hale fighting in the train car, were filmed on the privately owned Central Montana Rail, Inc. (CM) in Fergus County between Lewistown, Montana, and Denton, Montana.

In July 1995, a number of elaborate train cars were sent to the location in Lewistown, including several custom-built cars. Six weeks of filming on the forty mile track were required to capture all the stunts, helicopter action, gun battles, high falls and special effects sequences. Production photography was completed on August 28, 1995.

John Travolta was originally the choice to portray Riley Hale (finally played by Christian Slater), but was chosen instead to portray Major Vic Deakins. Travolta was paid $7 million for his role.

==Release==
&quot;Broken Arrow&quot; was No. 1 at the North American box office on its opening weekend grossing $15.6 million. It stayed on top for a second week and ultimately had a domestic gross of $70,770,147 and an international gross of $79,500,000, for a total worldwide gross of $150,270,147.

==Reception==
Based on 35 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 54% of critics gave &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; a positive review (19 &quot;Fresh&quot;; 16 &quot;Rotten&quot;), with an average rating of 5.7 out of 10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;John Woo adds pyrotechnic glaze to John Travolta&#x27;s hammy performance, but fans may find &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; to be a dispiritingly disposable English-language entry for the action auteur.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 61, &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; based on 21 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The review of this movie on &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot; represents the only time that Roger Ebert convinced Gene Siskel to change his mind about his final judgment of a film. Siskel initially gave the film a marginal &quot;thumbs up&quot; but changed it to a &quot;thumbs down&quot; after hearing Ebert&#x27;s criticisms. Ebert called it &quot;a slow, talky action thriller that plays like a homage to the Fallacy of the Talking Killer.&quot; This fallacy &quot;occurs when all the bad guy has to do is pull the trigger, and his problems are over. Instead, he talks, and talks, until his target escapes from his predicament.&quot; Ebert queried the &quot;purpose of a digital readout on a bomb. Who will ever see it, except in a mad bomber movie?&quot; and summed up the film saying that it all &quot;comes down to two guys fighting on a burning train for a channel-surfer&quot;.

<text>The bilabial clicks are a family of click consonants that sound like a smack of the lips. They are found as phonemes only in the small Tuu language family (currently two languages, one down to its last speaker), in the ǂ’Amkoe language of Botswana (also moribund), and in the extinct Damin ritual jargon of Australia. However, bilabial clicks are found paralinguistically for a kiss in various languages, including integrated into a greeting in the Hadza language of Tanzania, and as allophones of labial–velar stops in some West African languages (Ladefoged 1968), as of /mw/ in some of the languages neighboring Shona, such as Ndau and Tonga.

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the place of articulation of these sounds is . This may be combined with a second letter to indicate the manner of articulation, though this is commonly omitted for tenuis clicks. An uncommon non-IPA phonetic symbol for bilabial clicks is a turned &quot;b&quot; with hook, .
In official IPA transcription, the click letter is combined with a via a tie bar, though is frequently omitted. Many authors instead use a superscript without the tie bar, again often neglecting the . Either letter, whether baseline or superscript, is usually placed before the click letter, but may come after when the release of the velar or uvular occlusion is audible. A third convention is the click letter with diacritics for voicelessness, voicing and nasalization; it does not distinguish velar from uvular labial clicks. Common labial clicks are:

The last is what is heard in the sound sample at right, as non-native speakers tend to glottalize clicks to avoid nasalizing them.
Damin also had an egressive bilabial , which may be an egressive click (if it is not buccal) and which is always followed by another consonant (, or ).

==Features==

=== Alternative sound ===
=== Standard ===
Features of ingressive labial clicks:
*The forward place of articulation is labial, which means it is articulated with the lips. The release is a noisy, affricate-like sound. Bilabial articulation, using both lips, is typical. Sometimes this may pass through a labio-dental stage as the click is released, making it noisier. In other cases, the lower lip may start out in contact with both the upper teeth and the upper lip.
 (One of the two labial clicks in Damin is lingual &quot;egressive,&quot; which means that the trapped air pocket is compressed by the tongue until it is allowed to spurt out through the lips.)

The labial clicks are sometimes erroneously described as sounding like a kiss. However, they do not have the pursed lips of a kiss. Instead, the lips are compressed, more like a than a , and they sound more like a noisy smack of the lips than a kiss.

==Symbol==
The bullseye or bull&#x27;s eye () symbol used in phonetic transcription of the phoneme was made an official part of the International Phonetic Alphabet in 1979, but had existed for at least 50 years earlier. It is encoded in Unicode as .
The superscript IPA version is .

Similar graphemes consisting of a circled dot encoded by Unicode are:
*Gothic 𐍈, hwair
*astronomical symbol ☉ &quot;Sun&quot;
*mathematical operators and 
*geometrical symbol 
*Cyrillic Ꙩ, ꙩ (monocular O)

 It was never widely used and was eventually dropped for . Still the deprecated IPA character is encoded at . Earlier it is privately encoded by SIL International at and is available in SIL supporting fonts.

==Occurrence==
English does not have a labial click (or any click consonant, for that matter) as a phoneme, but a plain bilabial click does occur in mimesis, as a lip-smacking sound children use to imitate a fish.

Labial clicks only occur in the Tuu and Kx&#x27;a families of southern Africa, and in the Australian ritual language Damin.

==Origins==
Labial clicks may have arisen historically from labialization of other places of articulation. Starostin (2003) notes that the ǂ’Amkoe words for &#x27;one&#x27; and &#x27;two&#x27;, and , have labial clicks whereas no other Khoisan language has a labial consonant of any kind in its words for these numerals, and Starostin (2007) and Sands reconstruct a series of labialized clicks in Proto-Kxʼa, which became labial clicks in ǂ’Amkoe. In Hadza, the word for &#x27;kiss&#x27;, , becomes a mimetic or in greetings.

The Knorkator song &quot;[Buchstabe]&quot; (the actual title is a glyph) on the 1999 album &quot;Hasenchartbreaker&quot; uses a similar sound (though linguolabial instead of bilabial) to replace &quot;br&quot; in a number of German words (e.g. for ).

==Phonology==
In many of the languages in which the bilabial trill occurs, it occurs only as part of a prenasalized bilabial stop with trilled release, . That developed historically from a prenasalized stop before a relatively high back vowel like . In such instances, the sounds are usually still limited to the environment of a following .

<doc id="524827" wikidata="Q956506" url="?curid=524827" title="Dental click">
<text>Dental (or more precisely denti-alveolar) clicks are a family of click consonants found, as constituents of words, only in Africa and in the Damin ritual jargon of Australia. 

In English, the &quot;tut-tut!&quot; (British spelling, &quot;tutting&quot;) or &quot;tsk! tsk!&quot; (American spelling, &quot;tsking&quot;) sound used to express disapproval or pity is an unreleased dental click, although it is not a lexical phoneme (a sound that distinguishes words) in English but a paralinguistic speech-sound. Similarly paralinguistic usage of dental clicks is made in certain other languages, but the meaning thereof differs widely between many of the languages (e.g., affirmation in Somali but negation in many varieties of Arabic, Turkish and the languages of the Balkans).

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the place of articulation of these sounds is , a vertical bar. Prior to 1989, was the IPA letter for the dental clicks. It is still occasionally used where the symbol would be confounded with other symbols, such as prosody marks, or simply because in many fonts the vertical bar is indistinguishable from a lowercase L or capital I. Either letter may be combined with a second letter to indicate the manner of articulation, though this is commonly omitted for tenuis clicks. 

In official IPA transcription, the click letter is combined with a via a tie bar, though is frequently omitted. Many authors instead use a superscript without the tie bar, again often neglecting the . Either letter, whether baseline or superscript, is usually placed before the click letter, but may come after when the release of the velar or uvular occlusion is audible.

The last is what is heard in the sound sample at right, as non-native speakers tend to glottalize clicks to avoid nasalizing them.

In the orthographies of individual languages, the letters and digraphs for dental clicks may be based on either the vertical bar symbol of the IPA, , or on the Latin of Bantu convention. Nama and most Saan languages use the former; Naro, Sandawe, and Zulu use the latter.

==Features==
Features of dental clicks:
*The forward place of articulation is typically dental (or denti-alveolar) and laminal, which means it is articulated with the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge or the upper teeth, but depending on the language may be interdental or even apical. The release is a noisy, affricate-like sound.


==Occurrence==
Dental clicks are common in Khoisan languages and the neighboring Nguni languages, such as Zulu and Xhosa. In the Nguni languages, the tenuis click is denoted by the letter &quot;c&quot;, the murmured click by &quot;gc&quot;, the aspirated click by &quot;ch&quot;, and the nasal click by &quot;nc&quot;. The prenasalized clicks are written &quot;ngc&quot; and &quot;nkc&quot;.

The Cushitic language Dahalo has four clicks, all of them nasalized: .

Dental clicks may also be used para-linguistically. For example, English speakers use a plain dental click, usually written &quot;tsk&quot; or &quot;tut&quot; (and often reduplicated &quot;tsk-tsk&quot; or &quot;tut-tut&quot;; these spellings often lead to spelling pronunciations or ), as an interjection to express commiseration, disapproval, irritation, or to call a small animal. German ( or ), Hungarian (), Persian (), Portuguese (), Russian (; sound file) Spanish () and French () speakers use the dental click in exactly the same way as English.

The dental click is also used para-linguistically in Semitic languages such as Arabic, Hebrew and Indo-European Pashto, and Persian where it is transcribed as / and is also used as a negative response to a &quot;yes or no&quot; question (including Dari and Tajiki). It is also used in some languages spoken in regions closer to, or in, Europe, such as Turkish, Albanian, Greek, Bulgarian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian or Serbo-Croatian to denote a negative response to a &quot;yes or no&quot; question. The dental click is sometimes accompanied by an upward motion of the head.

<text>The voiced labial–palatal (or labio-palatal) approximant is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages, for example, French , read as [ɥitjɛm]. It has two constrictions in the vocal tract: with the tongue on the palate, and rounded at the lips. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a rotated lowercase letter, or occasionally , which indicates with a different kind of rounding.

The labial–palatal approximant can in many cases be considered the semivocalic equivalent of the close front rounded vowel . They alternate with each other in certain languages, such as French, and in the diphthongs of some languages, and with the non-syllabic diacritic are used in different transcription systems to represent the same sound. Sometimes, is written in place of , even though the former symbol denotes an extra-short in the official IPA.

Some languages, though, have a palatal approximant that is unspecified for rounding, and therefore cannot be considered the semivocalic equivalent of either or its unrounded counterpart . An example of such a language is Spanish, in which the labialized palatal approximant (not a semivowel) appears allophonically with rounded vowels in words such as &quot;ayuda&quot; &#x27;help&#x27;. According to some sources, it is not correct to transcribe this with the symbol , which has a different kind of rounding, or with , which implies spread lips; the only suitable transcription is . See palatal approximant for more information.

There is also the labialized postpalatal approximant in some languages, which is articulated slightly more back compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical labialized palatal approximant, though not as back as the prototypical labialized velar approximant. It can be considered the semivocalic equivalent of the close central rounded vowel . The International Phonetic Alphabet does not have a separate symbol for that sound, though it can be transcribed as or (both symbols denote a retracted ), (centralized ), (advanced ) or (centralized ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4, respectively. Other possible transcriptions include a centralized and labialized ( in the IPA, codice_5 in X-SAMPA) and a non-syllabic ( in the IPA, codice_6 in X-SAMPA).

Especially in broad transcription, the labialized postpalatal approximant may be transcribed as a palatalized and labialized velar approximant ( in the IPA, codice_7 or codice_8 in X-SAMPA).

==Compressed palatal approximant==
The compressed palatal approximant is typically transcribed in IPA simply as , and that is the convention used in this article. There is no dedicated diacritic for compression in the IPA. However, the compression of the lips can be shown with the letter as (simultaneous and labial compression) or ( modified with labial compression). The spread-lip diacritic may also be used with a labialized approximant letter as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol, though technically &#x27;spread&#x27; means unrounded.

The compressed post-palatal approximant can be transcribed simply as (centralized ), and that is the convention used in this article. Other possible transcriptions include (centralized modified with labial compression) and (centralized with the spread-lip diacritic).

===Features===
Features of the compressed palatal approximant:
*Its place of articulation is palatal and in addition it is endo-labialized, which is accomplished by raising the body of the tongue toward the palate while approximating the lips.

===Occurrence===
Because the labialized palatal approximant is assumed to have compression, and few descriptions cover the distinction, some examples in the table below may actually have protrusion.

==Protruded palatal approximant==
As there are no diacritics in the IPA to distinguish protruded and compressed rounding, an old diacritic for labialization, , will be used here as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol for the protruded palatal approximant. Another possible transcription is or (a palatal approximant modified by endolabialization).

Acoustically, this sound is &quot;between&quot; the more typical compressed palatal approximant and the non-labialized palatal approximant .

===Features===
Features of the protruded palatal approximant:
*Its place of articulation is labial–palatal, which is accomplished by raising the body of the tongue toward the palate while approximating the lips.

<text>The voiced labial–velar approximant is a type of consonantal sound, used in certain spoken languages, including English. It is the sound denoted by the letter in the English alphabet; likewise, the symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , or rarely , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. In most languages it is the semivocalic counterpart of the close back rounded vowel . In inventory charts of languages with other labialized velar consonants, will be placed in the same column as those consonants. When consonant charts have only labial and velar columns, may be placed in the velar column, (bi)labial column, or both. The placement may have more to do with phonological criteria than phonetic ones.

Some languages have a voiced labial–prevelar approximant, which is more fronted than the place of articulation of the prototypical voiced labialized velar approximant, though not as front as the prototypical labialized palatal approximant.

==Features==
Features of the voiced labial–velar approximant:

 The type of approximant is &quot;glide&quot; or &quot;semivowel&quot;. The term &quot;glide&quot; emphasizes the characteristic of movement (or &#x27;glide&#x27;) of from the vowel position to a following vowel position. The term &quot;semivowel&quot; emphasizes that, although the sound is vocalic in nature, it is not &#x27;syllabic&#x27; (it does not form the nucleus of a syllable).
 Some languages, such as Japanese and perhaps the Northern Iroquoian languages, have a sound typically transcribed as where the lips are compressed (or at least not rounded), which is a true labial–velar (as opposed to labialized velar) consonant. Close transcriptions may avoid the symbol in such cases, or may use the under-rounding diacritic, .

<text>The voiced labiodental approximant is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. It is something between an English /w/ and /v/, pronounced with the teeth and lips held in the position used to articulate the letter V. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a letter &quot;v&quot; with a leftward hook protruding from the upper right of the letter, and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1 &quot;or&quot; codice_2. With an advanced diacritic, , this letter also indicates a bilabial approximant, though the diacritic is frequently omitted because no contrast is likely.

The labiodental approximant is the typical realization of in the Indian South African variety of English. As the voiceless is also realized as an approximant (), it is also an example of a language contrasting voiceless and voiced labiodental approximants.

<text>The voiced labiodental nasal is a type of consonantal sound. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is . The IPA symbol is a lowercase letter &quot;m&quot; with a leftward hook protruding from the lower right of the letter. Occasionally it is instead transcribed as an with a dental diacritic: (for example in extIPA, where the two transcriptions are presented as variants).

The labiodental pronunciation of is very similar to that of the bilabial nasal , but instead of the lips touching each other, the lower lip touches the upper teeth. The position of the lips and teeth is generally the same as for the production of the labiodental fricatives and , though air escapes between the lip and the teeth in the case of the fricatives.

Although commonly appearing in languages, it is overwhelmingly an allophone restricted to a position before the labiodental consonants and . A phonemic has only been reported for the Kukuya language, which contrasts it with and is &quot;accompanied by strong protrusion of both lips&quot;. It is before and before and , perhaps because labialization is constrained by the spread front vowels; it does not occur before the back (rounded) vowels and .

It is doubted by some scholars that true closure can be made by a labiodental gesture because of gaps between the incisors, which for many speakers would allow air to flow during the occlusion. This is particularly pertinent considering that one of the Kukuya words with this consonant, , means a &#x27;gap between filed incisors,&#x27; a practice of the local people. The might therefore be better characterized as a labiodental nasal approximant than as a nasal occlusive.

Nonetheless, is extremely common around the world phonetically, as it is the universal allophone of and a very common allophone of before the labiodental fricatives and , as for example in English &quot;comfort&quot; and &quot;circumvent&quot;, and, for many people, &quot;infinitive&quot; and &quot;invent&quot;. In the Angami language, occurs as an allophone of before . In Drubea, is reported as an allophone of before nasal vowels.

A proposal to retire the letter was made in the run-up to the Kiel Convention of 1989, with the labiodental nasal to be transcribed solely by , but the proposal was defeated in committee.

<text>The voiced alveolar lateral approximant is a type of consonantal sound used in many spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents dental, alveolar, and postalveolar lateral approximants is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

As a sonorant, lateral approximants are nearly always voiced. Voiceless lateral approximants, are common in Sino-Tibetan languages, but uncommon elsewhere. In such cases, voicing typically starts about halfway through the hold of the consonant. No language is known to contrast such a sound with a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative .

In a number of languages, including most varieties of English, the phoneme becomes velarized (&quot;dark &quot;l&quot;&quot;) in certain contexts. By contrast, the non-velarized form is the &quot;clear &quot;l&quot;&quot; (also known as: &quot;light &quot;l&quot;&quot;), which occurs before and between vowels in certain English standards. Some languages have only clear &quot;l&quot;. Others may not have a clear &quot;l&quot; at all, or have them only before front vowels (especially ).

==Features==
Features of the voiced alveolar lateral approximant:
* There are four specific variants of :
** Dental, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the upper teeth, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.
** Denti-alveolar, which means it is articulated with the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, and the tip of the tongue behind upper teeth.
** Alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.
** Postalveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.

==Occurrence==
Languages may have clear apical or laminal alveolars, laminal denti-alveolars (such as French), or true dentals, which are uncommon. Laminal denti-alveolars tend to occur in continental European languages. However, a true dental generally occurs allophonically before in languages that have it, as in English &quot;health&quot;.

==Velarized alveolar lateral approximant ==
The voiced velarized alveolar approximant ( dark &quot;l&quot;) is a type of consonantal sound used in some languages. It is an alveolar, denti-alveolar, or dental lateral approximant, with a secondary articulation of velarization or pharyngealization. The regular symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represent this sound are (for a velarized lateral) and (for a pharyngealized lateral), though the dedicated letter , which covers both velarization and pharyngealization, is perhaps more common. The latter should not be confused with belted , which represents the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative. However, some scholars use that symbol to represent the velarized alveolar lateral approximant anyway – though such usage is considered non-standard.

If the sound is dental or denti-alveolar, one could use a dental diacritic to indicate so: , , .

Velarization and pharyngealization are generally associated with more dental articulations of coronal consonants, so dark &quot;l&quot; tends to be dental or denti-alveolar. Clear (non-velarized) &quot;l&quot; tends to be retracted to an alveolar position.

The term dark &quot;l is often synonymous with hard &quot;l, especially in Slavic languages. (Cf. Hard consonants)

===Features===
Features of the dark l:
* There are four specific variants of :
** Dental, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the upper teeth.
** Denti-alveolar, which means it is articulated with the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, and the tip of the tongue behind upper teeth.
** Alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or, more rarely, the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.
** Postalveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.
*It has a secondary articulation of velarization or pharyngealization, meaning that the back or root of the tongue approaches the soft palate (velum), or the back of the throat, respectively.

<doc id="524842" wikidata="Q1806900" url="?curid=524842" title="Lateral click">
<text>The lateral clicks are a family of click consonants found only in African languages. The clicking sound used by equestrians to urge on their horses is a lateral click, although it is not a speech sound in that context. Lateral clicks are found throughout southern Africa, for example in Zulu, and in some languages in Tanzania and Namibia. The place of articulation is not known to be contrastive in any language, and typically varies from alveolar to palatal.

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents a generic lateral click is , a double vertical bar. Prior to 1989, was the IPA letter for the lateral clicks, and this is still preferred by some phoneticians, as the vertical bar may be confounded with prosody marks, two dental clicks, and in some fonts, with a double lowercase L. Either letter may be combined with a second letter to indicate the manner of articulation, though this is commonly omitted for tenuis clicks with a velar rear articulation. 

In official IPA transcription, the click letter is combined with a via a tie bar, though is frequently omitted. Many authors instead use a superscript without the tie bar, again often neglecting the . Either letter, whether baseline or superscript, is usually placed before the click letter, but may come after when the release of the velar or uvular occlusion is audible. A third convention is the click letter with diacritics for voicelessness, voicing and nasalization; it does not distinguish velar from uvular lateral clicks. Common lateral clicks are:
The last is what is heard in the sound sample above, as non-native speakers tend to glottalize clicks to avoid nasalizing them.

In the orthographies of individual languages, the letters and digraphs for lateral clicks may be based on either the vertical bar symbol of the IPA, , or on the Latin of Bantu convention. Nama and most Saan languages use the former; Naro, Sandawe, and Zulu use the latter.

== Features ==
The specific articulation of lateral clicks may vary from language to language, from dental to palatal, apical or laminal, though no contrast between such articulations has been confirmed apart from the retroflex clicks, which may have lateral release.

Features of lateral clicks:

* The release of the forward place of articulation is a noisy, affricate-like sound in southern Africa, but abrupt in Hadza and Sandawe in East Africa.

* They are lateral consonants, which means they are produced by releasing the airstream at the side of the tongue, rather than in the middle. Some speakers pronounce them on one side of the mouth, some on both.
Regarding Khoekhoe, Tindall notes that European learners almost invariably pronounce these sounds as simple laterals, by placing the tongue against the side teeth, and that this articulation is &quot;harsh and foreign to the native ear&quot;. The Namaqua instead cover the whole of the palate with the tongue, and produce the sound &quot;as far back in the palate as possible&quot;.

== Occurrence ==

English does not have a lateral click (or any click consonant, for that matter) as a phoneme, but an unreleased lateral click does occur as an interjection, usually written &quot;tchick!&quot; or &quot;tchek!&quot; (and often reduplicated &quot;tchick-tchick!&quot;), used to urge a horse to move. A form of click can also be heard by some English speakers when , but this is generally a dental click rather than a lateral click.

<text>The voiced alveolar lateral flap is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a fusion of a rotated lowercase letter with a letter .

<text>The voiced palatal lateral approximant is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a rotated lowercase letter , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

Many languages that were previously thought to have a palatal lateral approximant actually have a lateral approximant that is, broadly, alveolo-palatal; that is to say, it is articulated at a place in-between the alveolar ridge and the hard palate (excluded), and it may be variously described as alveolo-palatal, lamino-postalveolar, or postalveolo-prepalatal. None of the 13 languages investigated by , many of them Romance, has a &#x27;true&#x27; palatal. That is likely the case for several other languages listed here. Some languages, like Portuguese and Catalan, have a lateral approximant that varies between alveolar and alveolo-palatal.

There is no dedicated symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the alveolo-palatal lateral approximant. If precision is desired, it may be transcribed or ; they are essentially equivalent because the contact includes both the blade and body (but not the tip) of the tongue. There is also a non-IPA letter ; (&quot;l&quot;, plus the curl found in the symbols for alveolo-palatal sibilant fricatives ) is used especially in Sinological circles.

The voiced palatal lateral approximant contrasts phonemically with its voiceless counterpart in the Xumi language spoken in China.

<text>The voiced velar lateral approximant is a type of consonantal sound, used as a distinct consonant in a very small number of spoken languages in the world. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a small capital version of the Latin letter l (since 1989), and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

The velar laterals of the world often involve a prestopped realization .

==Features==
Features of the voiced velar lateral approximant:


The velar lateral involves no contact of the tip of the tongue with the roof of the mouth: just like for the velar stop , the only contact takes place between the back of the tongue and the velum. This contrasts with the velarized alveolar lateral approximant – also known as the dark &quot;l&quot; in English &quot;feel&quot; – for which the apex touches the alveolar ridge.

<text>The voiced alveolar lateral fricative is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents voiced dental, alveolar, and postalveolar lateral fricatives is (sometimes referred to as &quot;lezh&quot;), and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

==Features==
Features of the voiced alveolar lateral fricative:


==Occurrence==

===Dental or denti-alveolar===
===Alveolar===
In addition, a pharyngealized voiced alveolar lateral fricative is reconstructed to be the ancient Classical Arabic pronunciation of ; the letter is now pronounced in Modern Standard Arabic as a pharyngealized voiced coronal stop, as alveolar or denti-alveolar .

==Voiced lateral-median fricative==

The voiced alveolar non-sibilant fricative (also known as a &quot;lisp&quot; fricative) is a consonantal sound. Consonants is pronounced with simultaneous lateral and central airflow.

===Features===
 However, it does not have the grooved tongue and directed airflow, or the high frequencies, of a sibilant.



===Occurrence===
==Related characters==
There are several Unicode characters based on lezh (ɮ):
* is a superscript IPA letter
* is a superscript IPA letter
* is an extension to IPA for disordered speech (extIPA)

==Notation==

In 1938, a symbol shaped similarly to heng was approved as the official IPA symbol for the voiced alveolar lateral fricative, replacing . It was suggested at the same time, however, that a compromise shaped like something between the two may also be used at the author&#x27;s discretion. It was this compromise version that was included in the 1949 &quot;Principles of the International Phonetic Association&quot; and the subsequent IPA charts, until it was replaced again by at the 1989 Kiel Convention. Despite the Association&#x27;s prescription, is nonetheless seen in literature from the 1960s to the 1980s.

<text>The voiceless alveolar lateral fricative is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents voiceless dental, alveolar, and postalveolar lateral fricatives is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

The symbol is called &quot;belted l&quot; and is distinct from &quot;l with tilde&quot;, , which transcribes a different soundthe velarized (or pharynɡealized) alveolar lateral approximant, often called &quot;dark L&quot;.

Some scholars also posit the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant distinct from the fricative. More recent research distinguishes between &quot;turbulent&quot; and &quot;laminar&quot; airflow in the vocal tract. Ball &amp; Rahilly (1999) state that &quot;the airflow for voiced approximants remains laminar (smooth), and does not become turbulent&quot;. The approximant may be represented in the IPA as .

In Sino-Tibetan language group, 
 argue that Burmese and Standard Tibetan have voiceless lateral approximants and Li Fang-Kuei &amp; William Baxter contrast apophonically the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant from its voiced counterpart in the reconstruction of Old Chinese. includes the voiceless velarized alveolar lateral approximant .

However, the voiceless dental &amp; alveolar lateral approximant is constantly found as an allophone of its voiced counterpart in British English and Philadelphia English after voiceless coronal and labial stops, which is velarized before back vowels, the allophone of after voiceless dorsal and laryngeal stops is most realized as a voiceless velar lateral approximant. See English phonology.

== Features ==
Features of the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative:


== Occurrence ==
The sound is fairly common among indigenous languages of the Americas, such as Nahuatl, Tlingit and Navajo, and in North Caucasian languages, such as Avar. It is also found in African languages, such as Zulu, and Asian languages, such as Chukchi, some Yue dialects like Taishanese, the Hlai languages of Hainan, and several Formosan languages and dialects in Taiwan.

The sound is rare in European languages outside the Caucasus, but it is found notably in Welsh in which it is written . Several Welsh names beginning with this sound (Llwyd , Llywelyn ) have been borrowed into English and then retain the Welsh spelling but are pronounced with an (Lloyd, Llewellyn), or they are substituted with (pronounced ) (Floyd, Fluellen). It was also found in certain dialects of Lithuanian Yiddish.

The phoneme was also found in the most ancient Hebrew speech of the Ancient Israelites. The orthography of Biblical Hebrew, however, did not directly indicate the phoneme since it and several other phonemes of Ancient Hebrew did not have a grapheme of their own. The phoneme, however, is clearly attested by later developments: was written with , but the letter was also used for the sound . Later, merged with , a sound that had been written only with . As a result, three etymologically distinct modern Hebrew phonemes can be distinguished: written , written (with later niqqud pointing שׁ), and evolving from and written (with later niqqud pointing שׂ). The specific pronunciation of evolving to from is known based on comparative evidence since is the corresponding Proto-Semitic phoneme and is still attested in Modern South Arabian languages, and early borrowings indicate it from Ancient Hebrew (e.g. &lt; Greek &lt; Hebrew ). The phoneme began to merge with in Late Biblical Hebrew, as is indicated by interchange of orthographic and , possibly under the influence of Aramaic, and became the rule in Mishnaic Hebrew. In all Jewish reading traditions, and have merged completely, but in Samaritan Hebrew has instead merged into .

The sound is also found in two of the constructed languages invented by J. R. R. Tolkien, Sindarin (inspired by Welsh) and Quenya (inspired by Finnish, Ancient Greek, and Latin). In Sindarin, it is written as initially and medially and finally, and in Quenya, it appears only initially and is written .

=== Dental or denti-alveolar ===
=== Alveolar ===
=== Alveolar approximant ===

=== Velarized dental or alveolar approximant ===

=== Semitic languages ===
The sound is conjectured as a phoneme for Proto-Semitic language, usually transcribed as ; it has evolved into Arabic , Hebrew :

Among Semitic languages, the sound still exists in contemporary Soqotri and Mehri. In Ge&#x27;ez, it is written with the letter Śawt.

==Voiceless lateral-median fricative==

The voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative (also known as a &quot;lisp&quot; fricative) is a consonantal sound. Consonants is pronounced with simultaneous lateral and central airflow.

===Features===
 However, it does not have the grooved tongue and directed airflow, or the high frequencies, of a sibilant.



===Occurrence===
==Capital letter==

Since the IPA letter &quot;ɬ&quot; has been adopted into the standard orthographies for many native North American languages, a capital letter L with belt &quot;Ɬ&quot; was requested by academics and added to the Unicode Standard version 7.0 in 2014 at U+A7AD.

The equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1, and in the Americanist phonetic notation it is . , as in the phonological history terms &quot;yod-dropping&quot; and &quot;yod-coalescence&quot;.

The palatal approximant can often be considered the semivocalic equivalent of the close front unrounded vowel . They alternate with each other in certain languages, such as French, and in the diphthongs of some languages as and , with the non-syllabic diacritic used in different phonetic transcription systems to represent the same sound.

A voiced alveolo-palatal approximant is attested as phonemic in the Huastec language, and is represented as an advanced voiced palatal approximant , or the plus sign may be placed after the letter, .

==Phonetic ambiguity and transcription usage==
Some languages, however, have a palatal approximant that is unspecified for rounding and so cannot be considered the semivocalic equivalent of either or its rounded counterpart, , which would normally correspond to . An example is Spanish, which distinguishes two palatal approximants: an approximant semivowel , which is always unrounded (and is a phonological vowel - an allophone of ), and an approximant consonant unspecified for rounding, (which is a phonological consonant). Eugenio Martínez Celdrán describes the difference between them as follows (with audio examples added):

He also considers that &quot;the IPA shows a lack of precision in the treatment it gives to approximants, if we take into account our understanding of the phonetics of Spanish. and are two different segments, but they have to be labelled as voiced palatal approximant consonants. I think that the former is a real consonant, whereas the latter is a semi-consonant, as it has traditionally been called in Spanish, or a semi-vowel, if preferred. The IPA, though, classifies it as a consonant.&quot;

There is a parallel problem with transcribing the voiced velar approximant.

The symbol may not display properly in all browsers. In that case, should be substituted.

In the writing systems used for most languages in Central, Northern, and Eastern Europe, the letter &quot;j&quot; denotes the palatal approximant, as in German &#x27;year&#x27;, which is followed by IPA. Although it may be seen as counterintuitive for English-speakers, there are a few words with that orthographical spelling in certain loanwords in English like Hebrew &quot;hallelujah&quot; and German &quot;Jägermeister&quot;.

In grammars of Ancient Greek, the palatal approximant, which was lost early in the history of Greek, is sometimes written as , an iota with the inverted breve below, which is the nonsyllabic diacritic or marker of a semivowel.

There is also the post-palatal approximant in some languages, which is articulated slightly more back than the place of articulation of the prototypical palatal approximant but less far back than the prototypical velar approximant. It can be considered the semivocalic equivalent of the close central unrounded vowel The International Phonetic Alphabet does not have a separate symbol for that sound, but it can be transcribed as , (both symbols denote a retracted ), or (both symbols denote an advanced ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are codice_2 and codice_3, respectively. Other possible transcriptions include a centralized ( in the IPA, codice_4 in X-SAMPA), a centralized ( in the IPA, codice_5 in X-SAMPA) and a non-syllabic ( in the IPA, codice_6 in X-SAMPA).

For the reasons mentioned above and in the article velar approximant, none of those symbols are appropriate for languages such as Spanish, whose post-palatal approximant &quot;consonant&quot; (not a &quot;semivowel&quot;) appears as an allophone of before front vowels and is best transcribed , (both symbols denote a lowered and retracted ), or (both symbols denote a lowered and advanced ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are codice_7 and codice_8.

Especially in broad transcription, the post-palatal approximant may be transcribed as a palatalized velar approximant (, or in the IPA, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11 or codice_12 in X-SAMPA).

A voiced alveolar-palatal approximant is attested as phonemic in the Huastec language.

==Features==
Features of the voiced palatal approximant:

 The most common type of this approximant is &quot;glide&quot; or &quot;semivowel&quot;. The term &quot;glide&quot; emphasizes the characteristic of movement (or &#x27;glide&#x27;) of from the vowel position to a following vowel position. The term &quot;semivowel&quot; emphasizes that, although the sound is vocalic in nature, it is not &#x27;syllabic&#x27; (it does not form the nucleus of a syllable). For a description of the &quot;approximant consonant&quot; variant used e.g. in Spanish, see above.
 The otherwise identical post-palatal variant is articulated slightly behind the hard palate, making it sound slightly closer to the velar .

<text>The palatal or palato-alveolar clicks are a family of click consonants found, as components of words, only in southern Africa. The tongue is nearly flat, and is pulled back rather than down as in the postalveolar clicks, making a sharper sound than those consonants. (&#x27;Sharper&#x27; meaning that the energy is concentrated at higher frequencies.) The tongue makes an extremely broad contact across the roof of the mouth, making correlation with the places of articulation of non-clicks difficult, but Ladefoged &amp; Traill (1984:18) find that the primary place of articulation is the palate, and say that &quot;there is no doubt that should be described as a palatal sound&quot;.

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the place of articulation of these sounds is , a double-barred vertical bar. An older variant, the double-barred esh, (approximately ⨎), is sometimes seen. This base letter is combined with a second element to indicate the manner of articulation, though that is commonly omitted for tenuis clicks.

Doke noted a palatal click with a slapped release, .

In official IPA transcription, the click letter is combined with a via a tie bar, though is frequently omitted. Many authors instead use a superscript without the tie bar, again often neglecting the . Either letter, whether baseline or superscript, is usually placed before the click letter, but may come after when the release of the velar or uvular occlusion is audible. A third convention is the click letter with diacritics for voicelessness, voicing and nasalization; it does not distinguish velar from uvular palatal clicks:

In the orthographies of individual languages, palatal clicks may be written either with digraphs based on the vertical-bar letter of the IPA, or using the Latin alphabet. Khoekhoee and most Bushman languages use the former. Orthographies using the latter include multigraphs based on in Juǀʼhoansi (1987 orthography) and originally in Naro, the latter since changed to , and on . In the 19th century, was sometimes used (see click letters); this might be the source of the Doke letter for the voiceless palatal click, , apparently a &quot;v&quot; over-struck with a vertical bar.

==Features==
Features of palato-alveolar clicks:
*The forward place of articulation is broad, with the tongue flat against the roof of the mouth from the alveolar ridge to the palate. The release is a sharp, plosive sound.


==Occurrence==
Palatal clicks only occur in the southern African Khoisan languages (the Khoe, Kx&#x27;a, and Tuu families), where they are extremely common, and in Bantu languages such as Yeyi.

==Fricated palatal clicks==

Ekoka !Kung has a series of laminal postalveolar-to-palatal clicks with a noisy, fricated release which derive historically from more prototypical palatal clicks. These have been variously described as fricated alveolar clicks and (inaccurately) as retroflex clicks. Unlike typical palatal clicks, which have a sharp, abrupt release, these have a slow, turbulent anterior release that sounds much like a short inhaled ; they also have a domed tongue rather than a flat tongue like a typical palatal click. The release has also been described as lateral. Like the clicks they derive from, they do not have the retracted tongue root and back-vowel constraint typical of alveolar clicks. A provisional transcription for the tenuis click is , though this misleadingly suggests that the clicks are affricates. Another proposal is to resurrect the old ʃ-like letter for palatal clicks, .

==Percussive release==
Clement Doke noted a nasal palatal click with slapped release, , in ǃKung, analogous to the percussive alveolar clicks of Sandawe.

<text>The voiced palatal nasal is a type of consonant used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a lowercase letter &quot;n&quot; with a leftward-pointing tail protruding from the bottom of the left stem of the letter. The equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. The IPA symbol is visually similar to , the symbol for the retroflex nasal, which has a rightward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the right stem, and to , the symbol for the velar nasal, which has a leftward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the right stem.

The IPA symbol derives from and , for nasality and denoting palatalization. In Spanish and languages whose writing systems are influenced by Spanish orthography, it is represented by the letter , called &quot;eñe&quot; (). In French and Italian orthographies the sound is represented by the digraph . Occitan uses the digraph , the source of the same Portuguese digraph called &quot;ene-agá&quot; (), used thereafter by languages whose writing systems are influenced by Portuguese orthography, such as Vietnamese. In Catalan, Hungarian, Aragonese and many African languages, as Swahili or Dinka, the digraph is used. In Albanian and some countries that used to be Yugoslavia, the digraph (Nj) is used, and sometimes, for the languages with the Cyrillic script that used to be part of Yugoslavia, uses the (Њњ) Cyrillic ligature that might be part of the official alphabet. In Czech and Slovak, // is represented by letter whilst Kashubian and Polish use . In Bengali it is represented by the letter . 

The voiced alveolo-palatal nasal is a type of consonantal sound, used in some oral languages. There is no dedicated symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound. If more precision is desired, it may be transcribed or ; these are essentially equivalent, since the contact includes both the blade and body (but not the tip) of the tongue. There is a non-IPA letter, ; (, plus the curl found in the symbols for alveolo-palatal sibilant fricatives ), which is used especially in Sinological circles.

The alveolo-palatal nasal is commonly described as palatal; it is often unclear whether a language has a true palatal or not. Many languages claimed to have a palatal nasal, such as Portuguese, actually have an alveolo-palatal nasal. This is likely true of several of the languages listed here. Some dialects of Irish as well as some non-standard dialects of Malayalam are reported to contrast alveolo-palatal and palatal nasals.

There is also a post-palatal nasal (also called pre-velar, fronted velar etc.) in some languages. Palatal nasals are more common than the palatal stops .

<text>The alveolar or postalveolar clicks are a family of click consonants found only in Africa and in the Damin ritual jargon of Australia. The tongue is more or less concave (depending on the language), and is pulled down rather than back as in the palatal clicks, making a hollower sound than those consonants.

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the place of articulation of these sounds is . The symbol is not an exclamation mark in origin, but rather a vertical bar with a subscript dot, the dot being the old diacritic for retroflex consonants. Prior to 1989, (stretched c) was the IPA letter for the alveolar clicks, and this is still preferred by some phoneticians. The tail of may be the tail of retroflex consonants in the IPA, and thus analogous to the underdot of . Either letter may be combined with a second letter to indicate the manner of articulation, though this is commonly omitted for tenuis clicks.

In official IPA transcription, the click letter is combined with a via a tie bar, though is frequently omitted. Many authors instead use a superscript without the tie bar, again often neglecting the .

The last can be heard in the sound sample at right; non-native speakers tend to &quot;glottalize&quot; clicks to avoid nasalizing them. The nasal click may also be heard at the right.

In the orthographies of individual languages, the letters and digraphs for alveolar clicks may be based on either the vertical bar symbol of the IPA, , or on the Latin of Bantu convention. Khoekhoe and most Bushman languages use the former; Naro, Sandawe, and Zulu use the latter.

Features of postalveolar clicks:
*The forward place of articulation is alveolar or postalveolar, depending on the language, and apical, which means it is articulated with the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge or the roof of the mouth behind the alveolar ridge. (Damin contrasted these two articulations as separate phonemes.) The release is a sharp, plosive sound in southern Africa, but in Sandawe it may be percussive, with the underside of the tip of the tongue striking the floor of the mouth after the release of the click (see below), and in Hadza the release is often quite weak.


==Occurrence==
English does not have an alveolar click (or any other click consonant) as a phoneme, but a plain alveolar click does occur in mimesis, as a sound children use to imitate a horse trotting.

==Percussive release==

In Sandawe, alveolar clicks commonly have a ballistic release, with the underside of the tip of the tongue subsequently striking the floor of the mouth. This allophone has been called &quot;flapped&quot; and &quot;slapped&quot;. Sometimes the percussive slap is louder than the release, resulting in a sound that has been characterized as a &quot;cluck&quot;. The symbol for the sublingual percussive component is in the extensions to the IPA; a slapped click is therefore transcribed or (or ). The percussive allophones of the five Sandawe alveolar clicks are (or etc.).

(Clement Doke also noted a palatal click with slapped release, .)

Nasal clicks that fit this description are used by speakers of Gan Chinese (from Ningdu county) and of Mandarin (from Beijing and Jilin), and presumably people from other parts of the country, with varying degrees of competence in nursery rhymes for the words for &#x27;goose&#x27; and &#x27;duck&#x27;, both of which begin with in Gan and until recently began with in Mandarin as well. In Gan, the nursery rhyme is (disregarding tone),
: 天一隻鵝 &#x27;a goose in the sky&#x27;
: 地下一隻鴨 &#x27;a duck on the ground&#x27;
: 鵝生鵝蛋鵝孵鵝 &#x27;a goose lays a goose egg, a goose hatches a goose&#x27;
: 鴨生鴨蛋鴨孵鴨 &#x27;a duck lays a duck egg, a duck hatches a duck&#x27;
where the onsets are all pronounced .

==&quot;Fricated&quot; alveolar clicks==
A series of clicks in Ekoka !Kung have been variously described as retroflex or fricated palatal clicks.

<text>The voiced retroflex approximant is a type of consonant used in some languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1. The IPA symbol is a turned lowercase letter &quot;r&quot; with a rightward hook protruding from the lower right of the letter.

The velar bunched approximant found in some varieties of Dutch and American English sounds similar to the retroflex approximant but it has a very different articulation.

<text>The voiced retroflex nasal is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

Like all the retroflex consonants, the IPA symbol is formed by adding a rightward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of an en (the letter used for the corresponding alveolar consonant). It is similar to , the letter for the palatal nasal, which has a leftward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the left stem, and to , the letter for the velar nasal, which has a leftward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the right stem.

<text>The uvular ejective is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is .

==Features==
Features of the uvular ejective:


==Occurrence==
A single plain uvular ejective is found in almost all Northeast Caucasian languages, all South Caucasian languages, and some Athabaskan languages, as well as Itelmen, Quechua and Aymara.

Most Salishan languages, the Tlingit language, and Adyghe and Kabardian (Northwest Caucasian) demonstrate a two-way contrast between labialised and plain uvular ejectives.

The Akhvakh language appears to have a contrast between lax and tense uvular ejectives: (lax) vs. (tense).

Abkhaz contrasts plain, palatalised and labialised uvular ejectives, written , e.g., , , . As with Georgian, Abkhaz has no non-ejective uvular stops; the historically present uvular aspirates have merged with their corresponding fricatives, although the aspirates are preserved in Abaza.

The plain uvular ejective is one of the most common consonants in Ubykh, due to its presence in the past tense suffix . But in addition to palatalised, labialised and plain uvular ejectives, Ubykh also possesses a pharyngealised version and a concurrently labialised and pharyngealised version, making a total of five: , , , , .
