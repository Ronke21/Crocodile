<doc id="515483" wikidata="Q3280993" url="?curid=515483" title="Medusa (Trapeze album)">
<text>Medusa is the second studio album by British rock band Trapeze. Recorded in 1970 at Morgan Studios, it was produced by The Moody Blues bassist John Lodge and released in November 1970 by Threshold Records. The album was preceded by the release of the single &quot;Black Cloud&quot; in 1970.

==Background==
Following the release of Trapeze&#x27;s self-titled debut album &quot;Trapeze&quot; in early 1970, lead vocalist John Jones and keyboardist Terry Rowley left the band, leaving guitarist Mel Galley, bassist Glenn Hughes and drummer Dave Holland to continue as a trio. Four of the seven songs on &quot;Medusa&quot; were written by Galley and his brother Tom, two were written by Hughes, and one was written by the trio.

==Re-recording==

The album&#x27;s title track was re-recorded by Glenn Hughes in 2010 with Black Country Communion on their self-titled debut album.

==Reception==

Critical reception for &quot;Medusa&quot; was generally positive. A review published on AllMusic awarded the album four and a half out of five stars, with writer Jason Anderson describing the album as &quot;the finest offering from &#x27;70s outfit Trapeze&quot; and &quot;one of the decade&#x27;s most underappreciated hard rock recordings&quot;. Anderson praised Hughes&#x27;s &quot;soulful vocal delivery&quot; and Galley&#x27;s &quot;catchy and affective&quot; guitar performance, concluding that &quot;it&#x27;s a wonder that the record isn&#x27;t mentioned more when influential albums of this era are discussed&quot;.

==Criticism and controversies==
===Market manipulation===
The Indian stock exchanges BSE and NSE have witnessed several corruption scandals. At times, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred several individuals and entities from trading on the exchanges for stock manipulation, especially in illiquid smallcaps and penny stocks.

===Market operators illegal activity===
Market operators continue to operate in the Indian stock market, albeit within a regulatory framework aimed at ensuring transparency and fairness. Market operators are individuals or entities that actively engage in buying and selling securities to influence their prices for profit. They operate through various strategies, such as arbitrage, short selling, high-frequency trading, front running, churning, scalping, wash trading, spoofing, and layering, often leveraging sophisticated technology and large capital. Regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) oversee market activities to curb malpractices such as insider trading, price rigging, and market manipulation. SEBI has implemented measures, including surveillance systems, to detect and penalize unethical practices. Despite these regulations, market operators exploit loopholes to gain an edge, necessitating continuous vigilance and regulatory updates. Market operators in India often use the &quot;pump and dump&quot; strategy, despite strict regulations against such practices. The &quot;pump and dump&quot; scheme involves artificially inflating the price of a stock (pump) through false or misleading positive statements. Once the price has been significantly raised, the operators then sell off their holdings (dump) at the inflated prices, leading to a sharp price decline and substantial losses for other investors who bought in at the higher prices. Their activities have continued to impact market volatility, liquidity, and price discovery, playing a significant role in the dynamics of the Indian stock market.

===NSE co-location scam===
On 8 July 2015, Sucheta Dalal wrote an article on Moneylife alleging that some NSE employees were leaking sensitive data related to high-frequency trading or co-location servers to a select set of market participants so that they could trade faster than their competitors. NSE alleged defamation in the article by Moneylife. On 22 July 2015, NSE filed a suit against the publication. However, on 9 September 2015, the Bombay High Court dismissed the case and fined NSE in this defamation case against Moneylife. The High Court asked NSE to pay to each journalist Debashis Basu and Sucheta Dalal and the remaining to two hospitals. The Bombay High Court has stayed the order on costs for a period of two weeks, pending the hearing of the appeal filed by NSE.

The board also passed orders against 16 individuals including former managing directors and CEOs Ravi Narain and Chitra Ramakrishna ordering them to disgorge 25% of their salaries during that period along with interest. All money is to be paid into the Investor protection and education fund. These individuals have also been debarred from the markets or holding any position in a listed company for a period of five years.

In 2024, SEBI dropped the case.

<text>Trapeze is the debut studio album by British rock band Trapeze. Recorded in 1969 at Morgan Studios and Decca Studios, it was produced by the Moody Blues bassist John Lodge and released in May 1970 as the second album on Threshold Records, a record label founded by Lodge&#x27;s band. &quot;Trapeze&quot; is the band&#x27;s only album to feature founding member John Jones (vocals, trumpet); both he and Terry Rowley (organ, piano, flute) left shortly after its release. (Rowley rejoined in 1974.)

Contrary to the band&#x27;s later material, which was primarily categorised as blues and hard rock, &quot;Trapeze&quot; has been described by commentators as a progressive or psychedelic rock album, owing partly to the presence of brass instruments and keyboards on the album. Songwriting was typically led by Jones, Galley and Hughes, with Rowley also co-writing two tracks. &quot;Send Me No More Letters&quot; was released as the only single from the album in 1969, backed with fellow album track &quot;Another Day&quot;.

==Background and release==
Trapeze was formed in March 1969 by former The Montanas members John Jones (vocals, trumpet) and Terry Rowley (organ, guitar, piano, flute), along with former Finders Keepers members Mel Galley (guitar, vocals), Glenn Hughes (bass, piano, vocals) and Dave Holland (drums). The five-piece recorded their self-titled debut album later in the year at London&#x27;s Morgan Studios and Decca Studios. The recordings were produced by John Lodge, whose band the Moody Blues had earlier signed Trapeze as the first act to their new record label Threshold Records. &quot;Send Me No More Letters&quot; was released as a single in 1969, and &quot;Trapeze&quot; was released in May 1970. The album was the band&#x27;s only release to feature Jones and Rowley, both of whom left shortly after its release to return to The Montanas.

==Composition and style==
The material featured on &quot;Trapeze&quot; was primarily written by Galley, Hughes and Jones – Galley was credited on seven tracks, Hughes and Jones on five each, and Rowley on two. Despite being the band&#x27;s primary vocalist, Jones was only credited with trumpet on the album, with Hughes being credited for all vocals on the release. The style of the album has been described by commentators as a mix between progressive rock, psychedelic rock and pop rock, with AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder claiming that &quot;Those listeners who only know the subsequent albums by Trapeze may be surprised by this debut effort&quot; due to their later hard rock style. The album was compared stylistically to the work of other British rock acts of the period, including Lodge&#x27;s band the Moody Blues and Hughes&#x27;s future group Deep Purple (particularly the first three albums). In the liner notes for a 2004 reissue of the album by Lemon Recordings, journalist Nigel Williamson described &quot;Trapeze&quot; as &quot;a classic period example of English prog, mixing pastoral whimsy, swirling psychedelia, rock guitars and pop harmonies&quot;. Similarly, Eder identified that the album featured an array of &quot;lush choruses, psychedelic interludes, and hook-laden romantic ballads&quot;, amounting to &quot;high-energy music within the context of psychedelic pop/rock&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Media response to &quot;Trapeze&quot; was generally positive. Eder praised the performances of the &quot;core trio&quot; of Galley, Hughes and Holland, who he claimed &quot;[found] a good compromise with Rowley and Jones&#x27; more lyrical, psychedelic pop sensibilities&quot;, but noted that &quot;it&#x27;s clear that three of these musicians are holding back to one degree or another in these surroundings&quot;. He also highlighted &quot;Fairytale&quot; and &quot;Am I&quot; as the album&#x27;s standout songs, which he claimed &quot;[pointed] the way to [the band&#x27;s] future sound&quot; following their reduction to the aforementioned trio. &quot;Billboard&quot; hailed &quot;Trapeze&quot; as &quot;a candidate for big chart action&quot;, praising the performance in particular of Hughes, highlighting &quot;Send Me No More Letters&quot; and &quot;Fairytale&quot;, and praising the band&#x27;s &quot;strong rock personality&quot; on the record.

<doc id="515505" wikidata="Q2679573" url="?curid=515505" title="Tongue, Sutherland">
<text>Tongue ( from ) is a coastal village in northwest Highland, Scotland, in the western part of the former county of Sutherland. It lies on the east shore above the base of the Kyle of Tongue and north of the mountains Ben Hope and Ben Loyal on the A836. To the north lies the area of Braetongue.

Tongue is the main village in a series of crofting townships that runs through Coldbackie, Dalharn, Blandy, and the harbour of Scullomie to the deserted township of Slettel. The village includes a youth hostel, a craft shop, a general store and garage, a bank, a post office and two hotels, the Tongue Hotel and the Ben Loyal Hotel. It is connected to the west side of the Kyle by the Kyle of Tongue Bridge and Causeway, built in 1971.

==Toponymy==
Contrary to popular belief, the name Tongue does not refer to the shape of the Kyle of Tongue (though the kyle &quot;can&quot; be described as &quot;tongue-shaped&quot;). Rather it is a geographical term in Old Norse which refers to a piece of land shaped like a spit or tongue. That tongue of land projecting into the Kyle is the terminal moraine of the Kyle of Tongue glacier, and forms the eastern part of the Kyle of Tongue causeway.

In Gaelic, &quot;Tunga&quot; indicates the village, whereas &quot;Caol Thunga&quot; indicates the kyle. The village is also known as &quot;Ceann Tàile&quot; and formerly as &quot;Circeabol&quot;.

==History==
The area was an historic crossroad for Gaels, Picts and Vikings.

Tongue House is the historic seat of the Clan Mackay, after they abandoned Castle Varrich (&quot;Caisteal Bharraich&quot;). The ruins of the castle, built at Tongue in the eleventh century after the clan were expelled from their ancestral Province of Moray to County Sutherland, are a popular tourist attraction. A battle for succession some time around 1427 to 1433 culminated in the Battle of Drumnacoub, in which two factions of the clan fought on Carn Fada, between the Kyle and Ben Loyal.

The village saw a key battle between a Jacobite treasure ship and two ships of the Royal Navy in 1746, which resulted in the Jacobite crew trying to slip ashore with their gold. They were then caught by the Navy, supported by local people who were loyal to Hanover, which cost Bonnie Prince Charlie valuable support in the run-up to Culloden.

In the Highland Clearances, many people who were cleared from the interior of Sutherland moved to this village. The Gaelic poet Ewen Robertson (, 1842–95) lived in Tongue his entire life, and is most famous for his song &quot;Mo mhallachd aig na caoraich mhòr&quot; (&quot;My curses on the Border sheep&quot;) mocking, among others, the Duchess of Sutherland and Patrick Sellar. The song has been recorded by notable singers Julie Fowlis and Kathleen MacInnes. There is a monument to Robertson in Tongue.

== Notable people from Tongue ==

* U.S. Senator from Tennessee, treasury secretary, and diplomat George W. Campbell was born in Tongue before emigrating to North Carolina.
* Environmental scientist, Professor Anson Mackay, comes from a crofting family in Tongue and lived there until he went to University.

<doc id="515508" wikidata="Q38783" url="?curid=515508" title="Pembroke Welsh Corgi">
<text>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi (; Welsh for &quot;dwarf dog&quot;) is a cattle herding dog breed that originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales. The name &quot;Corgi&quot; is of Welsh origin, and is a compound of the words and (mutated to ), meaning &quot;dwarf&quot; and &quot;dog&quot;, respectively. It is one of two breeds known as a Welsh Corgi, the other being the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are descended from the Spitz family of dog. 

Pembroke Welsh Corgis are famous as the preferred breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who owned more than 30 Royal corgis during her reign. Although these dogs have been favoured by British royalty for more than seventy years, among the British public they have recently fallen into decline in terms of popularity and demand. However, they remain very popular in the United States. Cities such as New York, Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco hold annual &quot;Corgi Meetups&quot; in which hundreds of dogs and their owners congregate to spend the day.

The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has been ranked 11th in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, which states that the breed is considered an excellent working dog. Pembroke Welsh Corgis were ranked 11th most popular breed of dog in 2020 according to the American Kennel Club.

==Description==

===Appearance===
Pembroke Welsh Corgis differ from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi by being shorter in length, having smaller ears, and being slightly straighter of leg. 

The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has erect ears that are in proportion to the equilateral triangle of the head. The breed standard indicates that the ears should be firm, medium in size, and tapered slightly to a rounded point. The head should be &quot;fox-like&quot; in shape and appearance. The Pembroke breed usually weighs around 22 - 27 lbs(10 to 12 kilos). They often measure between 8 to 12 inches, or 20 to 30 centimeters, and on average, live to be around 13 years old.

Due to the Pembroke Welsh Corgi having a double coat, they shed heavily all year round, with peaks in the spring and autumn. With regular brushing, their coat is fairly easy to maintain, as well as naturally water- and dirt repellent (at the exception of &quot;fluffies&quot;). Intact females are also known to shed during heat. Their coat has somewhat lighter markings on each side of the withers caused by changes in the thickness, length, and direction of hair growth. The Pembroke coat also varies in color, going from a reddish, or even sand color, to brown and black. Along with these differing colors, their coats will also sometimes contain a speckling of white spots.

Breed faults exist and should not be bred on purpose; such as corgis with a very long and thinner coat coming from a recessive gene and red coats present with a bluish cast which have a diluted colour.While some outlying Pembroke Welsh Corgis are born with their tail naturally short, the majority often have their tails docked between 2–5 days old due to historical tradition or to conform to the Breed Standard. Artificial docking was not needed for the dog to do its job as a herding dog in the United Kingdom as many claim (since Cardigan Welsh corgis were also herding dogs but never docked) but rather because a non-herding dog was considered a luxury under tax law and attracted a tax, so to demonstrate that their dogs were herding dogs, owners had to ensure the dogs had docked tails. The Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club, and the FCI allow intact tails in Conformation shows. The AKC Standard states tails should be docked no longer than . In many countries including the United Kingdom, docking has been deemed illegal.

===Temperament===
Pembroke Welsh Corgis love to be involved in the family, and tend to follow wherever their owners go. They have a great desire to please their owners, thus making them eager to learn and train. The dogs can also be challenging to train due to their working background, stubbornness and intelligence – they were ranked as the eleventh most intelligent dog in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;. Besides herding, they also function as watchdogs due to their alertness and tendency to bark, which can be aggravated if they are not stimulated adequately. Most Pembrokes will seek the attention of everyone they meet and behave well around children and other pets. It is important to socialise this breed with other animals, adults, and children when they are very young to avoid any anti-social behaviour or aggression later in life. Another thing to keep in mind is that with this need for stimulation, they also have a need for exercise, as they can easily become overweight. They love to run around and dig holes, and due to their herding and – for some – prey instinct, they love to chase anything that moves, so it is best to keep them inside fenced areas. The herding instinct will also cause some younger Pembrokes to nip at their owners&#x27; ankles as this is what they were bred to do with cattle.

==Health==

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.2 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.
Pembroke Welsh Corgis are achondroplastic, meaning they are a &quot;true dwarf&quot; breed. As such, their stature and build can lead to certain non-inherited health conditions, but genetic issues should also be considered. Commonly, Pembrokes can suffer from monorchidism, Von Willebrand&#x27;s disease, hip dysplasia, degenerative myelopathy (DM), and inherited eye problems such as progressive retinal atrophy. Genetic testing is available for Pembroke Welsh Corgis to avoid these issues and enhance the genetic health pool.
Pembrokes are also prone to obesity given a robust appetite, characteristic of herding group breeds.

==History==

The Pembroke Welsh Corgi lineage has been traced back as far as AD 1107. Even with their smaller stature and shorter legs, they are very agile, and were excellent herding dogs. It is said that Flemish weavers brought the dogs with them as they travelled to reside in Wales. Some popular stories give Corgis a creation myth connected to fairies. One story states that two children were running through a forest and stumbled upon the funeral of a fairy. The mourning fairies gave the two children two small corgi puppies and the children took them home, thus giving the breed popularity. Stories also state that Corgis played the role of war horses for fairies before they became herding dogs for humans. At the base of the haunches of Corgis, there is a line of slightly rougher fur called the fairy saddle. These folktales about the Corgi breed have been hard to verify, as they do not appear in older Welsh books or older written folktales. It is speculated that the fairytales originated from breeders in more recent times. These legends are harder to trace as none of it is written and usually travels through word of mouth. 

Pembrokes and Cardigans first appeared together in 1925 when they were shown under the rules of The Kennel Club in Britain. The Corgi Club was founded in December 1925 in Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire. It is reported that the local members favoured the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year or so later. Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardised through careful selective breeding. Pembrokes and Cardigans were officially recognised by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were initially categorised together under the single heading of Welsh Corgis before the two breeds were recognised as separate and distinct in 1934.
Pembroke Welsh Corgis are becoming more popular in the United States and rank 20th (24th) in American Kennel Club registrations, as of 2015 (2012). However, corgis are now listed as a &quot;vulnerable&quot; breed in the United Kingdom; the decline has been said to be due to a 2007 ban on tail-docking (the practice of cutting off the animal&#x27;s tail) in the UK, as well as the lack of breeders in the UK In 2009, the corgi was added to The Kennel Club&#x27;s &quot;At Watch&quot; list of British breeds when annual registrations numbered between 300 and 450. In 2014, the breed was put on the Club&#x27;s &quot;Vulnerable Native Breeds&quot; list when registrations dropped under 300. In 2018, the breed came off the &quot;At-Risk&quot; list with 456 puppies registered in December 2017. The Kennel Club has credited the renewed interest in the breed to the popular Netflix television series, &quot;The Crown&quot;, and others. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has also appeared in the American television &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; as the pet dog of Captain Raymond Holt and Kevin M. Cozner and is shown to be extremely loyal. Ein, a Corgi with human-level intelligence, is one of the 5 main characters in the TV show &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;.

==Activities==
Pembroke Welsh Corgis can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Corgis, despite their dwarfism giving the illusion of small slow legs, can reach up to 25 mph if they are healthy and fit. This is because Corgis tend to use more upper body strength to run than most dogs, giving them enhanced abilities with such activities as agility and herding and racing.

==Royal corgis==

At a young age, the Queen&#x27;s passion for this breed started when her father, King George VI, brought home their first royal corgi who was later named Dookie. The Queen ceased breeding corgis around 2012 so as not to leave any behind after she died; her last corgi, Willow, died in April 2018. She was gifted two new corgi pups by her family in 2021.

On 3 April 2019, the film &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Corgi&quot; was released.

<text>Puch () is a manufacturing company located in Graz, Styria, Austria. The company was founded in 1899 by the industrialist Johann Puch and produced automobiles, bicycles, mopeds, and motorcycles. It was a subsidiary of the large Steyr-Daimler-Puch conglomerate.

==History==

===Foundation===

From 1889 Johann Puch (1862–1914) worked as an agent for Humber vehicles and manufacturer of &quot;Styria&quot; safety bicycles in a small workshop in Graz and in 1890 he founded his first company, Johann Puch &amp; Comp., employing 34 workers. Cyclists like Josef Fischer, winning the first edition of Paris–Roubaix in 1896, popularized &quot;Styria&quot; bicycles which were even exported to England and France. By 1895, Puch already employed more than 300 workers producing about 6000 bikes a year.

In 1897 Puch left the company after a dispute with his business partners. Two years later he founded the First Styrian Bicycle Factory AG (&quot;Erste Steiermärkische Fahrradfabrik AG&quot;) in Graz. Puch&#x27;s company became successful through innovation and quality handicraft, rapidly expanding over time. It soon began producing motorcycles and mopeds.

 The main production plant, later called Einser-Werk, was constructed in the south of Graz, in the district of Puntigam. Production of engines was started in 1901 and cars followed in 1904. In 1906 the production of the two-cylinder Puch Voiturette began and in 1909 a Puch car broke the world high-speed record with 130.4 km/h. In 1910, Puch is known to have produced sedans for members of the Habsburg imperial family.

In 1912 Johann Puch went into retirement and became the company&#x27;s honorary president. In that year the company employed about 1,100 workers and produced 16,000 bicycles and over 300 motorcycles and cars annually. Puch automobiles were successful at the pre-war Österreichische Alpenfahrt rally and from 1913, the four-cylinder 38 PS (horsepower) Type VIII &quot;Alpenwagen&quot; was manufactured in Graz. During World War I, Puch became an important vehicle supplier to the Austro-Hungarian Army.

The Puch green and white chequered badge is in the colours of the Steyr town flag and is very similar in concept to the BMW badge, which is in the colours of the Bavarian flag.

===Between wars===

With the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire following the War, the market for automobiles shrank and production was discontinued. However, again in 1919, the new Type XII &quot;Alpenwagen&quot; was developed.

In 1923 the Italian engineer and FIAT agent Giovanni Marcellino is said to have been sent by the banks to wind up the Puch factory in Graz. Instead of which, within a few weeks he had settled down to live in the town, designing and then producing a new version of the split-single. Taking his inspiration from industrial counter-piston engines, the new engine benefited from the improved breathing of the Italian original, to which he added asymmetric port timing. In 1931 Puch won the German Grand Prix with a supercharged split-single, though in subsequent years the split-singles of DKW did better.

In 1928 the company merged with Austro-Daimler into the new Austro-Daimler-Puchwerke. This company in its turn merged in 1934 with Steyr-Werke AG to form the Steyr-Daimler-Puch conglomerate.
===WWII===
Like all enterprises of its kind, the Puch production plants had to change to arms production during World War II. The existing capacity was insufficient, therefore a second plant was constructed and opened in 1941 in Thondorf, Graz. In the three original assembly halls, luxury vehicles for the American market were produced.
Steyr-Daimler-Puch is one of the companies known to have benefited from slave labor housed in the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp system during World War II. Slaves from the camp were used in a highly profitable system used by 45 engineering and war-effort companies, and amongst them Puch had an underground factory built at Gusen in 1943.

===Post-War years===

During the period immediately after the war, late 1945 to 1947, the factory was requisitioned and run by the British Army (R.E.M.E.) who used the facilities and what remained of the workforce for the repairing and servicing of British and American military vehicles. In 1949, an assembly cooperation agreement was signed with Fiat in Turin. The 1950s to the mid-1970s saw a sharp increase in production of motorcycles, bicycles and mopeds. Even though Puch was a part of Steyr-Daimler-Puch, it still manufactured products under its own name, as well as for Steyr-Puch and other companies. Puch gave up racing in the 1950s and split-single production ended around 1970.

==Vehicles==

===Puch scooters===
The late 1950s saw strong sales of the Puch 125cc two-stroke single motorscooters, which had three gears shifted from the left twistgrip. These machines developed a reputation for reliability and were popular for daily commuting, providing good weather protection and ease of use. In this role their moderate performance, with a top speed of around 45 mph, was not a problem. Later models had a 150cc engine and foot-operation, giving better performance of 6 hp instead of 5 hp but retaining the three gears.

===Puch mopeds===

Puch produced the Puch Maxi, Puch Newport, and MK mopeds, which were popular from the late 1970s to early 1980s. In Austria and the Netherlands, Puch mopeds played a big role in the 1960s popular culture. Puch mopeds in Sweden were, and still are, very popular despite the company ceasing production of mopeds in 1985. Many of them were named after US states, notable exceptions include the Maxi and the Monza.

Some of the more popular models were:
* VS50 50 cc 2-speed gearbox
* The Dakota (VZ 50) 50 cc fan-cooled, 3-speed gearbox. In fact, the most popular by far.
* The Florida (MV 50) 50 cc fan-cooled, 3-speed gearbox
* The Alabama (DS 50) 50 cc fan-cooled, 3- or 4-speed gearbox

The oldest mopeds often had a 50 cc fan-cooled engine with a 1- or 2-speeded gearbox (cric-crac) and
newer mopeds had many different (always 50cc) engines such as:
*Fan-cooled, 3-speed (Dakota, Dakota 3000, Nevada)
*Fan-cooled, 4-speed (Mexico)
*Air-cooled, 3-speed (Arizona, Monza M50, Montana, Monza 3C)
*Air-cooled, 4-speed (Monza 4-speed)

===Puch BMX===
Puch began making BMX bikes as early as the 1970s. Many different models appeared including the Challenger, Invader and Trak Pro. A short-lived BMX style moped, the Maxi BMX Special was produced in the mid-70s however proved unpopular. Compared to the company&#x27;s more successful models very few unmolested examples remain. In 1981 they worked with Speed Unlimited in Wayne, New Jersey to manufacture a line of high end BMX race bikes. Speed Unlimited also made bikes for Hutch and their own brand Thruster. The model they made for Puch was the Trak Pro. In 1981 Puch also began sponsoring BMX racers across the United States. The green, black and white uniform was soon showing up at BMX tracks across America, especially in the Northeast. There is a collection of Puchs at the BMX Museum - Puch Collection.

===Puch Maxi===
The Maxi is one of Puch&#x27;s most well known machines along with the Magnum and Newport models. The Puch Maxi is a moped fitted with a single cylinder, 50cc, two stroke engine .

The engine produced around 2 hp and could propel the rider at speeds of 28 mph (48 km/h).

It was started using the pedals which could be engaged and disengaged from the engine via a starting lever so it could be ridden as a normal bicycle.

Later models did not have pedals, and instead were started with a kick start mechanism.

===Puch motorcycle marketed as the &quot;Twingle&quot;===

Puch is remembered in the US for importing the SGS 250, the first and last split-single seen there. Marketed by Sears in their catalogue as the &quot;Twingle&quot;, it was styled much like a BMW of the 1950s and 60s. The layout had been popular in Europe between the wars because it improved scavenging, and hence fuel consumption, a feature considered less important in the US. New models after World War II had an internal re-arrangement which improved piston lubrication, reducing wear on the most vulnerable part of the engine, while an early system of pumping the two-stroke oil, along with the twin spark-plug ignition, greatly improved day-to-day reliability. Despite the racing heritage and performance potential of the split-single engine, this particular Puch model, with a top speed around , was at a disadvantage against the loop-scavenged two-strokes that arrived in the late 1960s. A total of 38,584 of Puch 250 SGS motorcycles were produced between 1953 and 1970.

===Puch 500===
The Puch 500 was a city car produced by Steyr-Daimler-Puch in Graz under license from Fiat. Based on the Fiat 500, it was manufactured from 1957 until 1975.

==Foreign ventures==
In 1970 Puch bought a 50% share of Spanish motorcycle and scooter manufacturer Avello located in the city of Gijón in Asturias, in northern Spain. During the following years that plant manufactured models with Puch motors and original frames and later built Puch models. Over the years, in spite of good sales, the Spanish venture was losing money and in 1983 Suzuki bought 36% from the Spanish owners so the Spanish venture became a Puch-Suzuki venture. In 1988 Suzuki bought all outstanding shares and became sole owner of the Spanish manufacturer.

==Legacy==

In the late 1980s, the company was being squeezed out by competition. In 1987, a massive restructuring of the company led to the end of the production of two-wheelers in Graz. The company&#x27;s technical know-how was always better than its marketing and commercial success. The Puch motorcycle company was sold to Piaggio, maker of the Vespa, in 1987 and still produces bikes under the name Puch. When the bicycle division of Piaggio, which also included Bianchi Bicycles was sold to the Swedish Grimaldi Industri group in 1997, Puch became part of Cycleurope. In 2011, Austrian entrepreneur Josef Faber took control of the brand, with the 2012 line of bicycles manufactured by Cycleurope in France.

Steyr-Puch, assembler of four wheel drive vehicles and parts, still exists next to the Piaggio division.

The so-called &quot;Einserwerk&quot;, the first production plant, shut down in the early 2000s. The historical assembly-hall was declared a protected industrial monument. When Graz became European Capital of Culture in 2003, a Puch museum was opened in one of the former assembly halls.

Puch sold the entire production line of Puch Maxi Plus to Hero Motors when production ended in Austria. It spawned the Hero Puch that sold extremely well in India from 1988 until the end of 2003 when production ended.

<doc id="515517" wikidata="Q208081" url="?curid=515517" title="Aneto">
<text>Aneto is the highest mountain in the Pyrenees and in Aragon, Spain&#x27;s third-highest mountain, reaching a height of . It is in the Spanish province of Huesca, the northernmost of three Aragonese provinces, south of the France–Spain border. It forms the southernmost part of the Maladeta massif.

Aneto is located in the Posets-Maladeta Natural Park, in the municipality of Benasque, Huesca province, an autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. It is part of the Maladeta massif and is located in the Benasque valley. It consists of Paleozoic terrain of a granitic nature and Mesozoic materials. Its northern side holds the largest glacier in the Pyrenees, covering in 2005; it is shrinking rapidly due to warming summer temperatures and decreasing winter precipitations over the 20th century – it covered 106.7 ha in 1981, and over 200 ha in the 19th century. It is estimated that it has lost more than half of its surface in the last 100 years, and may disappear around 2050.

==Toponym==
Initially, the mountain did not even have a name. There are indications that the shepherds and hunters from the southern valleys referred to it as Malheta or Malahita or Punta. It was also previously known as La Malahite. The first traveller who is recorded as having seen it from the port (or pass) of Benasque, Louis Ramond de Carbonnières, simply described its appearance as &quot;needles of ice&quot; in 1787.

The highest point of the Pyrenees eventually inherited the name of a village on its south-eastern side: Aneto.
The French, on hearing the Aragonese pronunciation of &quot;Aneto&quot;, retained the last two clearly accentuated phonetic syllables, &quot;&quot;ne&quot; and &quot;tu&quot;, ignoring the first syllable &quot;a&quot;&quot;. Based on such oral transcription, the French name &quot;Netou&quot; came to exist along with several historical variants: Nelto, Nettou, Anetthou, Annetton, Anelthou, Nethom or Aréthon, all used by various cartographers. Even though the summit and slopes are entirely within Spanish territory, the first extensive studies of the Pyrenees - and the only ones for the following 100 years - were French ones from the 19th century - starting with the very detailed study by Jean Daniel François Schrader (1844–1924) in 1874. So these names were the toponyms that were then used. It took Émile Belloc&#x27;s renown work on the Pyrenees (notably on its hydrology, glaciology and etymology) to establish the name of Aneto as the official toponym; by 1898, he referred to it only by this name.

==History==
Some 2 km away on its north-west fringe lies the Maladeta peak that, though not being among the five highest peaks in the environment, gave its name to the entire massif. It subsequently earned the greatest interest from climbers, especially in the early 18th century. Mainly, it was a matter of perspective, since from the natural entrance to the valley or arriving from France, its top is in the foreground, while the crest hides the true extent of its eastern neighbor, taller and with larger glaciers. Only when Friedrich von Parrot reached the top of the Maladeta in 1817, came the realisation that both Aneto as well as its neighbours the Pico del Medio, the Punta de Astorg, the Pico Maldito and la Aguja Schmidt Endell towered higher. Until then, the Monte Perdido had been considered the highest. However, the uncovering of the highest point of the Pyrenees had hardly been accomplished when the mountain began to earn a reputation, as several glacial disasters, some fatal, dissipated the interest in crowning it - notably with the death of Luchon Barrau, considered the dean and leading expert in the area. He fell into a crack in the ice on Maladeta. This caused shock among the natives, who, already fearful of venturing on the glacier, became genuinely scared of the mountain they considered cursed.

==Geography==

Aneto rises to above sea level in the centre of the Pyrenees mountain range. It lies entirely in Spain, just south of the main ridge of the Pyrenees and the border between France and Spain. The peak lies in the north-east of the province of Huesca above the town of Benasque.

Aneto occupies the eastern end of the Malditos Massif which primarily consists of a 6 km long ridge, running from north-west to south east at over 3000 m. The ridge connects Aneto towards the east with the more visible Maladeta peak, further to the west, and includes the Coronas peaks and Pico Maldito, which, together with the crest of the portillons, gives the massif its characteristic image.

Although the valley to the north is the source of the Ésera river, which flows west and then south, the northern slopes of Aneto and its glacier drain into a sinkhole called Forau de Aigualluts in the Plan de Aigualluts and flows underground to the east where it resurfaces to empty into the Aran Valley and the Garonne river, flowing north into France and the Atlantic Ocean. The waters on the western and southern sides, flow into the Coronas and Llosas lakes respectively before draining separately into the river Ballibierna, which flows into the Esera, then the Cinca before joining the Ebro and flowing to the Mediterranean. Thus although Aneto does not lie on the main ridge of the Pyrenees, it does lie on the watershed between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.

==Glaciers==
This agglomeration of summits, all markedly Alpine, is the birthplace of what were once the largest glaciers in the Pyrenees, which stretched up to the mouth of the Congosto Ventamillo with depths of ice several hundred metres thick. Today, global warming has reduced the portentous mass to eleven glaciers that total only three hundred acres. No one knows for sure when the melting process began but despite a slight advance in the &#x27;50s it has now accelerated rapidly, and it is expected that the Aneto permafrost and the glaciers of the Pyrenees could disappear around the middle of the 21st century. The Aneto-Maladeta massif sustains a total of 286 acres&#x27; surface, representing more than half of all the glaciers in Spain - all of which being located in the Pyrenees.

There are three glaciers on the slopes of the mountain: the oldest, Aneto glacier on the north side; the Barrancos, alongside the Las Tempestades on the north-east side; and the Maladetas glacier on the north side (under the Maladeta peak).

The rest cannot truly be defined as glaciers without contention, as they have lost all mobility and do not behave as such. Among these are the Cregüella, Alba and Salenques glaciers, which are in a major state of decline. However, even considering them as snowfields, their past glacier state has kept them to date and they are expected to maintain their icy heart for decades.

==Climbing==

The mountain&#x27;s ascent is usually made from the Renclusa Refuge (2,140 m). From there, the itinerary traverses the longest part of the glacier that extends to the north of the peak. The summit is defended by a short rocky passage called the Bridge of Mohammed. It is a narrow ridge of large, stable blocks, with an exposed drop on either side. At the summit is an impressive cross and a contrasting view, with the snow-covered Maladeta massif north-west and the Alto Aragon region to the south.

The usual ascent is a very easy although long (12-hour) alpine route. It is taken by many people each year, including many with little or no experience of alpine climbing or high level walking. The high number of people who come to climb Aneto each year makes a significant contribution to the local economy. The vast majority of the people staying at the Renclusa Refuge are there solely to climb Aneto. By comparison many of the adjacent peaks, which are arguably finer climbs, see relatively few ascents and are comparatively quiet.

===First ascent===
On 18 July 1842, Platon de Tchihatcheff (Чихачёв, Chikhachev), a former Russian officer vacationing in Luchon, left from Bagnères-de-Luchon accompanied by guides Pierre Sanio de Luz, Luchonnais Bernard Arrazau and Pierre Redonnet. Also in the party were Albert de Franqueville, a Norman botanist, and his guide, Jean Sors. They took the trail from the Hospice de France, crossed the Benasque Pass, then spent the night at the La Renclusa shelter, a simple construction of dry rocks that is now a large mountain refuge.

The next day, they crossed a pass towards Alba pass and lost their way on the south slope around Lake Gregueña. Late in the day, at the end of their strength, they took refuge for the night in a cabin near the Vallibierna valley.

As the sun rose the next morning, the group left for the Coroné pass. Despite a fear of crevasses, they decided to approach the summit by the glacier. After climbing a ridge only a few metres wide (named the &quot;Bridge of Muhammad&quot; by Albert de Franqueville as it is believed, according to a Muslim legend that says that the entrance to Paradise is as narrow as the blade of a scimitar on which only the righteous pass), they reached the summit on 20 July 1842, where they constructed a cairn and left a bottle containing each climber&#x27;s name. Tchihatcheff wanted to open a more direct route back across the glacier, but his companions flatly refused, forcing him to yield. Four days later he performed a second ascent with another group, pursuing the same objective that his first companions had denied him. On crossing the Portillon, in view of the cracks that furrowed the glacier, a mutiny almost started, but finally, after everyone tied themselves to a big rope, they crossed the chasms and the passage of Muhammad was defeated a second time.

Thereafter Aneto entered into the dynamics of dissemination and popularization of the Pyrenees peaks. In France, its ascension became a great classic and every spring tourist to Bagneres de Luchon had to try it. Henry Spont wrote a book reflecting on this experience, simply titled Le Néthou, describing the trip, the schedule and recommended equipment.

===First winter ascent===
The first winter ascent of the mountain was achieved on 1 March 1878 by Roger de Monts, B. Courrèges, and B. and V. Paget.

===First sea to summit ascent===
Starting from the Atlantic ocean, unresupplied and unsupported, Louis-Philippe Loncke reached the summit on day 25 of his crossing of the Pyrenees (August 19, 2020).

==Flora==

The uniqueness of the massif and its appeal has led to the virtual abandonment of farming activities, replaced by tourism. The flora of the environment, therefore, has been impeccably conserved, especially on hillsides and massifs, where the forests remain in their primary state.

=== Upper Alpine ===
This layer, which reaches 3,404 metres above sea level, is the one that presents greatest difficulties for the development of life. The harsh weather conditions that the plants have to endure at the top of the peaks, ridges and crests, require the development of an extraordinary resilience. There are a number of factors to endure such as strong insolation, low temperatures and short growing seasons in the presence of snow most of the year.

Totally devoid of woody vegetation, it is colonized by more than 100 plant species, including lichens, mosses, succulents and microscopic algae. Among the flora present are the &quot;Androsace Vandelli&quot;, which is found at 2,800 metres, and the &quot;Silene acaulis&quot;. 20% of these species are endemic to the Pyrenees.

==Air traffic boundary==
An aviation intersection called ANETO exists very close to the mountain itself, exactly on the border of France and Spain. For pilots crossing the Pyrenees this intersection marks the boundary between the Bordeaux and Barcelona airspaces.

<doc id="515531" wikidata="Q64965" url="?curid=515531" title="Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen">
<text>Prince Maria Emanuel of Saxony, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen (31 January 1926 – 23 July 2012) was the head of the Royal House of Saxony.

==Life==
Born at Prüfening Abbey in Regensburg, Bavaria, he was the eldest child of the then Hereditary Prince Frederick Christian of Saxony, later Margrave of Meissen, and Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn and Taxis.

At the age of 18 Emanuel was imprisoned and sentenced to death by the National Socialists for being opposed to their rule. The death sentence, however, was commuted. He next had to escape from the approaching Soviets as his homeland, Saxony, became a part of communist East Germany as World War II wound down. After the war he moved to Switzerland where he began working in the financial services sector. Also being a talented painter Emanuel had a number of his works exhibited.

Although Marie Vassiltchikov recounts in her book &quot;The Berlin Diaries 1940–45&quot; the story of the 16-year-old Hereditary Prince Maria Emanuel paying her a visit to seek her help in finding a bride, as he felt it was his dynastic obligation to start a family early, Emanuel would not in fact marry until his 37th birthday. His wife was Princess Anastasia of Anhalt (born 1940), whom he married (civ.) on 22 June 1962 in La Tour-de-Peilz and (rel.) on 31 January 1963 in Vevey, Switzerland. They had no children.

Maria Emanuel became head of the Royal House of Saxony upon the death of his father on 9 August 1968.

==Succession==
As Maria Emanuel fathered no legitimate children, he had acknowledged as his eventual heir Prince Alexander of Saxe-Gessaphe, the son of his eldest sister Princess Anna and her late husband Robert Afif, &quot;Prince of Gessaphe&quot; (or &quot;Assaphe&quot;/&quot;Afif-Assaf&quot;, descendants of a Lebanese Christian family which ruled the Keserwan, a province in north of Beirut). Maria Emanuel adopted Alexander on 1 June 1999, who had married Princess Gisela of Bavaria in 1987. In 1997 the surviving male dynasts of the Albertine line of Wettins consented to the Margrave&#x27;s decision, Subsequently, his brother Albert stated that he no longer accepted the decision.

The royal line of the House of Wettin applies semi-salic law, which allows for inheritance through a female. Since the death of Maria Emanuel, if Albert was the last male dynast then this would lead firstly to the children of their sisters Maria Josepha (unmarried), Maria Anna and Mathilde, but only Mathilde&#x27;s marriage indisputedly met equality requirements and her only son died in 1987. Therefore, if the Gessaphe claim is invalid, the succession would pass to the issue of the Margrave&#x27;s paternal aunts, who were Margarete Karola (1900–1962), Maria Alix (1901–1990) and Anna (1903–1976), all of whom left children. Margarete having been the eldest, the heir would be her grandson Karl Friedrich, Prince of Hohenzollern (born 1932), head of the princely line of the royal House of Hohenzollern.

The Margrave&#x27;s brother Albert, however, supported discarding equality requirements to allow his cousin Prince Timo of Saxony&#x27;s morganatic son, Rüdiger (born 1953), to eventually succeed. Rüdiger has, with his first wife Astrid Linke (1949–1989), three sons Daniel (born 1975), Arne (born 1977) and Nils (born 1978).

Although the Albertine Saxons consist only of the royal branch, there are several extant lines of the House of Wettin which ruled the various Ernestine duchies until 1918 (as well as the cadet branches of the Coburg line which held several royal crowns). In a joint statement of 23 June 2015, the heads of the three remaining branches of the senior Ernestine line of the House of Wettin, Michael, Prince of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Andreas, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Konrad, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen, declared that, according to the house law of the House of Wettin and to traditional princely succession rules, Alexander Afif, bearing the name &quot;Prince of Saxony&quot; by adoption, were neither a member of nobility nor of the House of Wettin, nor had he succeeded Maria Emanuel as head of the Albertine branch (the Royal House of Saxony), nor were he entitled to style himself Margrave of Meissen.

<text>An injury is any physiological damage to living tissue caused by immediate physical stress. Injuries to humans can occur intentionally or unintentionally and may be caused by blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, burning, toxic exposure, asphyxiation, or overexertion. Injuries can occur in any part of the body, and different symptoms are associated with different injuries.

Treatment of a major injury is typically carried out by a health professional and varies greatly depending on the nature of the injury. Traffic collisions are the most common cause of accidental injury and injury-related death among humans. Injuries are distinct from chronic conditions, psychological trauma, infections, or medical procedures, though injury can be a contributing factor to any of these.

Several major health organizations have established systems for the classification and description of human injuries.

== Occurrence ==
Injuries may be intentional or unintentional. Intentional injuries may be acts of violence against others or self-inflicted against one&#x27;s own person. Accidental injuries may be unforeseeable, or they may be caused by negligence. In order, the most common types of unintentional injuries are traffic accidents, falls, drowning, burns, and accidental poisoning. Certain types of injuries are more common in developed countries or developing countries. Traffic injuries are more likely to kill pedestrians than drivers in developing countries. Scalding burns are more common in developed countries, while open-flame injuries are more common in developing countries.

As of 2021, approximately 4.4 million people are killed due to injuries each year worldwide, constituting nearly 8% of all deaths. 3.16 million of these injuries are unintentional, and 1.25 million are intentional. Traffic accidents are the most common form of deadly injury, causing about one-third of injury-related deaths. One-sixth are caused by suicide, and one-tenth are caused by homicide. Tens of millions of individuals require medical treatment for nonfatal injuries each year, and injuries are responsible for about 10% of all years lived with disability. Men are twice as likely to be killed through injury than women. In 2013, 367,000 children under the age of five died from injuries, down from 766,000 in 1990.

== Classification systems ==
The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI). Under this system, injuries are classified by mechanism of injury, objects/substances producing injury, place of occurrence, activity when injured, the role of human intent, and additional modules. These codes allow the identification of distributions of injuries in specific populations and case identification for more detailed research on causes and preventive efforts.

The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics developed the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS). Under this system injuries are classified by nature, part of body affected, source and secondary source, and event or exposure. The OIICS was first published in 1992 and has been updated several times since. The Orchard Sports Injury and Illness Classification System (OSIICS), previously OSICS, is used to classify injuries to enable research into specific sports injuries.

The injury severity score (ISS) is a medical score to assess trauma severity. It correlates with mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization time after trauma. It is used to define the term &quot;major trauma&quot; (polytrauma), recognized when the ISS is greater than 15. The AIS Committee of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine designed and updates the scale.

== Mechanisms ==

=== Trauma ===
Traumatic injury is caused by an external object making forceful contact with the body, resulting in a wound. Major trauma is a severe traumatic injury that has the potential to cause disability or death. Serious traumatic injury most often occurs as a result of traffic collisions. Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death in people under the age of 45.

Blunt trauma injuries are caused by the forceful impact of an external object. Injuries from blunt trauma may cause internal bleeding and bruising from ruptured capillaries beneath the skin, abrasion from scraping against the superficial epidermis, lacerated tears on the skin or internal organs, or bone fractures. Crush injuries are a severe form of blunt trauma damage that apply large force to a large area over a longer period of time. Penetrating trauma injuries are caused by external objects entering the tissue of the body through the skin. Low-velocity penetration injuries are caused by sharp objects, such as stab wounds, while high-velocity penetration injuries are caused by ballistic projectiles, such as gunshot wounds or injuries caused by shell fragments. Perforated injuries result in an entry wound and an exit wound, while puncture wounds result only in an entry wound. Puncture injuries result in a cavity in the tissue.

=== Burns ===

Burn injury is caused by contact with extreme temperature, chemicals, or radiation. The effects of burns vary depending on the depth and size. Superficial or first-degree burns only affect the epidermis, causing pain for a short period of time. Superficial partial-thickness burns cause weeping blisters and require dressing. Deep partial-thickness burns are dry and less painful due to the burning away of the skin and require surgery. Full-thickness or third-degree burns affect the entire dermis and is susceptible to infection. Fourth-degree burns reach deep tissues such as muscles and bones, causing loss of the affected area.

Thermal burns are the most common type of burn, caused by contact with excessive heat, including contact with flame, contact with hot surfaces, or scalding burns caused by contact with hot water or steam. Frostbite is a type of burn caused by contact with excessive cold, causing cellular injury and deep tissue damage through the crystallization of water in the tissue. Friction burns are caused by friction with external objects, resulting in a burn and abrasion. Radiation burns are caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. Most radiation burns are sunburns caused by ultraviolet radiation or high exposure to radiation through medical treatments such as repeated radiography or radiation therapy.

Electrical burns are caused by contact with electricity as it enters and passes through the body. They are often deeper than other burns, affecting lower tissues as electricity penetrates the skin, and the full extent of electrical burns are often obscured. They will also cause extensive destruction of tissue at the entry and exit points. Electrical injuries in the home are often minor, while high tension power cables cause serious electrical injuries in the workplace. Lightning strikes can also cause severe electrical injuries. Fatal electrical injuries are often caused by tetanic spasm inducing respiratory arrest or interference with the heart causing cardiac arrest.

Chemical burns are caused by contact with corrosive substances such as acid or alkali. Chemical burns are rarer than most other burns, though there are many chemicals that can damage tissue. The most common chemical-related injuries are those caused by carbon monoxide, ammonia, chlorine, hydrochloric acid, and sulfuric acid. Some chemical weapons induce chemical burns, such as white phosphorus. Most chemical burns are treated with extensive application of water to remove the chemical contaminant, though some burn-inducing chemicals react with water to create more severe injuries. The ingestion of corrosive substances can cause chemical burns to the larynx and stomach.

=== Other mechanisms ===
Toxic injury is caused by the ingestion, inhalation, injection, or absorption of a toxin. This may occur through an interaction caused by a drug or the ingestion of a poison. Different toxins may cause different types of injuries, and many will cause injury to specific organs. Toxins in gases, dusts, aerosols, and smoke can be inhaled, potentially causing respiratory failure. Respiratory toxins can be released by structural fires, industrial accidents, domestic mishaps, or through chemical weapons. Some toxicants may affect other parts of the body after inhalation, such as carbon monoxide.

Asphyxia causes injury to the body from a lack of oxygen. It can be caused by drowning, inhalation of certain substances, strangulation, blockage of the airway, traumatic injury to the airway, apnea, and other means. The most immediate injury caused by asphyxia is hypoxia, which can in turn cause acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome as well as damage to the circulatory system. The most severe injury associated with asphyxiation is cerebral hypoxia and ischemia, in which the brain receives insufficient oxygen or blood, resulting in neurological damage or death. Specific injuries are associated with water inhalation, including alveolar collapse, atelectasis, intrapulmonary shunting, and ventilation perfusion mismatch. Simple asphyxia is caused by a lack of external oxygen supply. Systemic asphyxia is caused by exposure to a compound that prevents oxygen from being transported or used by the body. This can be caused by azides, carbon monoxide, cyanide, smoke inhalation, hydrogen sulfide, methemoglobinemia-inducing substances, opioids, or other systemic asphyxiants. Ventilation and oxygenation are necessary for treatment of asphyxiation, and some asphyxiants can be treated with antidotes.

Injuries of overuse or overexertion can occur when the body is strained through use, affecting the bones, muscles, ligaments, or tendons. Sports injuries are often overuse injuries such as tendinopathy. Over-extension of the ligaments and tendons can result in sprains and strains, respectively. Repetitive sedentary behaviors such as extended use of a computer or a physically repetitive occupation may cause a repetitive strain injury. Extended use of brightly lit screens may also cause eye strain.

== Locations ==

=== Abdomen ===
Abdominal trauma includes injuries to the stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, kidneys, gallbladder, and spleen. Abdominal injuries are typically caused by traffic accidents, assaults, falls, and work-related injuries, and physical examination is often unreliable in diagnosing blunt abdominal trauma. Splenic injury can cause low blood volume or blood in the peritoneal cavity. The treatment and prognosis of splenic injuries are dependent on cardiovascular stability. The gallbladder is rarely injured in blunt trauma, occurring in about 2% of blunt abdominal trauma cases. Injuries to the gallbladder are typically associated with injuries to other abdominal organs. The intestines are susceptible to injury following blunt abdominal trauma. The kidneys are protected by other structures in the abdomen, and most injuries to the kidney are a result of blunt trauma. Kidney injuries typically cause blood in the urine.

Due to its location in the body, pancreatic injury is relatively uncommon but more difficult to diagnose. Most injuries to the pancreas are caused by penetrative trauma, such as gunshot wounds and stab wounds. Pancreatic injuries occur in under 5% of blunt abdominal trauma cases. The severity of pancreatic injury depends primarily on the amount of harm caused to the pancreatic duct. The stomach is also well protected from injury due to its heavy layering, its extensive blood supply, and its position relative to the rib cage. As with pancreatic injuries, most traumatic stomach injuries are caused by penetrative trauma, and most civilian weapons do not cause long-term tissue damage to the stomach. Blunt trauma injuries to the stomach are typically caused by traffic accidents. Ingestion of corrosive substances can cause chemical burns to the stomach. Liver injury is the most common type of organ damage in cases of abdominal trauma. The liver&#x27;s size and location in the body makes injury relatively common compared to other abdominal organs, and blunt trauma injury to the liver is typically treated with nonoperative management. Liver injuries are rarely serious, though most injuries to the liver are concomitant with other injuries, particularly to the spleen, ribs, pelvis, or spinal cord. The liver is also susceptible to toxic injury, with overdose of paracetamol being a common cause of liver failure.

=== Face ===

Facial trauma may affect the eyes, nose, ears, or mouth. Nasal trauma is a common injury and the most common type of facial injury. Oral injuries are typically caused by traffic accidents or alcohol-related violence, though falls are a more common cause in young children. The primary concerns regarding oral injuries are that the airway is clear and that there are no concurrent injuries to other parts of the head or neck. Oral injuries may occur in the soft tissue of the face, the hard tissue of the mandible, or as dental trauma.

The ear is susceptible to trauma in head injuries due to its prominent location and exposed structure. Ear injuries may be internal or external. Injuries of the external ear are typically lacerations of the cartilage or the formation of a hematoma. Injuries of the middle and internal ear may include a perforated eardrum or trauma caused by extreme pressure changes. The ear is also highly sensitive to blast injury. The bones of the ear are connected to facial nerves, and ear injuries can cause paralysis of the face. Trauma to the ear can cause hearing loss.

Eye injuries often take place in the cornea, and they have the potential to permanently damage vision. Corneal abrasions are a common injury caused by contact with foreign objects. The eye can also be injured by a foreign object remaining in the cornea. Radiation damage can be caused by exposure to excessive light, often caused by welding without eye protection or being exposed to excessive ultraviolet radiation, such as sunlight. Exposure to corrosive chemicals can permanently damage the eyes, causing blindness if not sufficiently irrigated. The eye is protected from most blunt injuries by the infraorbital margin, but in some cases blunt force may cause an eye to hemorrhage or tear. Overuse of the eyes can cause eye strain, particularly when looking at brightly lit screens for an extended period.

=== Heart ===
Cardiac injuries affect the heart and blood vessels. Blunt cardiac injury in a common injury caused by blunt trauma to the heart. It can be difficult to diagnose, and it can have many effects on the heart, including contusions, ruptures, acute valvular disorders, arrhythmia, or heart failure. Penetrative trauma to the heart is typically caused by stab wounds or gunshot wounds. Accidental cardiac penetration can also occur in rare cases from a fractured sternum or rib. Stab wounds to the heart are typically survivable with medical attention, though gunshot wounds to the heart are not. The right ventricle is most susceptible to injury due to its prominent location. The two primary consequences of traumatic injury to the heart are severe hemorrhaging and fluid buildup around the heart.

=== Musculoskeletal ===

Musculoskeletal injuries affect the skeleton and the muscular system. Soft tissue injuries affect the skeletal muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Ligament and tendon injuries account for half of all musculoskeletal injuries. Ligament sprains and tendon strains are common injuries that do not require intervention, but the healing process is slow. Physical therapy can be used to assist reconstruction and use of injured ligaments and tendons. Torn ligaments or tendons typically require surgery. Skeletal muscles are abundant in the body and commonly injured when engaging in athletic activity. Muscle injuries trigger an inflammatory response to facilitate healing. Blunt trauma to the muscles can cause contusions and hematomas. Excessive tensile strength can overstretch a muscle, causing a strain. Strains may present with torn muscle fibers, hemorrhaging, or fluid in the muscles. Severe muscle injuries in which a tear extends across the muscle can cause total loss of function. Penetrative trauma can cause laceration to muscles, which may take an extended time to heal. Unlike contusions and strains, lacerations are uncommon in sports injuries.

Traumatic injury may cause various bone fractures depending on the amount of force, direction of the force, and width of the area affected. Pathologic fractures occur when a previous condition weakens the bone until it can be easily fractured. Stress fractures occur when the bone is overused or suffers under excessive or traumatic pressure, often during athletic activity. Hematomas occur immediately following a bone fracture, and the healing process often takes from six weeks to three months to complete, though continued use of the fractured bone will prevent healing. Articular cartilage damage may also affect function of the skeletal system, and it can cause posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Unlike most bodily structures, cartilage cannot be healed once it is damaged.

=== Nervous system ===

Injuries to the nervous system include brain injury, spinal cord injury, and nerve injury. Trauma to the brain causes traumatic brain injury (TBI), causing &quot;long-term physical, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive consequences&quot;. Mild TBI, including concussion, often occurs during athletic activity, military service, or as a result of untreated epilepsy, and its effects are typically short-term. More severe injuries to the brain cause moderate TBI, which may cause confusion or lethargy, or severe TBI, which may result in a coma or a secondary brain injury. TBI is a leading cause of mortality. Approximately half of all trauma-related deaths involve TBI. Non-traumatic injuries to the brain cause acquired brain injury (ABI). This can be caused by stroke, a brain tumor, poison, infection, cerebral hypoxia, drug use, or the secondary effect of a TBI.

Injury to the spinal cord is not immediately terminal, but it is associated with concomitant injuries, lifelong medical complications, and reduction in life expectancy. It may result in complications in several major organ systems and a significant reduction in mobility or paralysis. Spinal shock causes temporary paralysis and loss of reflexes. Unlike most other injuries, damage to the peripheral nerves is not healed through cellular proliferation. Following nerve injury, the nerves undergo degeneration before regenerating, and other pathways can be strengthened or reprogrammed to make up for lost function. The most common form of peripheral nerve injury is stretching, due to their inherent elasticity. Nerve injuries may also be caused by laceration or compression.

=== Pelvis ===
Injuries to the pelvic area include injuries to the bladder, rectum, colon, and reproductive organs. Traumatic injury to the bladder is rare and often occurs with other injuries to the abdomen and pelvis. The bladder is protected by the peritoneum, and most cases of bladder injury are concurrent with a fracture of the pelvis. Bladder trauma typically causes hematuria, or blood in the urine. Ingestion of alcohol may cause distension of the bladder, increasing the risk of injury. A catheter may be used to extract blood from the bladder in the case of hemorrhaging, though injuries that break the peritoneum typically require surgery. The colon is rarely injured by blunt trauma, with most cases occurring from penetrative trauma through the abdomen. Rectal injury is less common than injury to the colon, though the rectum is more susceptible to injury following blunt force trauma to the pelvis.

Injuries to the male reproductive system are rarely fatal and typically treatable through grafts and reconstruction. The elastic nature of the scrotum makes it resistant to injury, accounting for 1% of traumatic injuries. Trauma to the scrotum may cause damage to the testis or the spermatic cord. Trauma to the penis can cause penile fracture, typically as a result of vigorous intercourse. Injuries to the female reproductive system are often a result of pregnancy and childbirth or sexual activity. They are rarely fatal, but they can produce a variety of complications, such as chronic discomfort, dyspareunia, infertility, or the formation of fistulas. Age can greatly affect the nature of genital injuries in women due to changes in hormone composition. Childbirth is the most common cause of genital injury to women of reproductive age. Many cultures practice female genital mutilation, which is estimated to affect over 125 million women and girls worldwide as of 2018. Tears and abrasions to the vagina are common during sexual intercourse, and these may be exacerbated in instances of non-consensual sexual activity.

=== Respiratory tract ===
Injuries to the respiratory tract affect the lungs, diaphragm, trachea, bronchus, pharynx, or larynx. Tracheobronchial injuries are rare and often associated with other injuries. Bronchoscopy is necessary for an accurate diagnosis of tracheobronchial injury. The neck, including the pharynx and larynx, is highly vulnerable to injury due to its complex, compacted anatomy. Injuries to this area can cause airway obstruction. Ingestion of corrosive chemicals can cause chemical burns to the larynx. Inhalation of toxic materials can also cause serious injury to the respiratory tract.

Severe trauma to the chest can cause damage to the lungs, including pulmonary contusions, accumulation of blood, or a collapsed lung. The inflammation response to a lung injury can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome. Injuries to the lungs may cause symptoms ranging from shortness of breath to terminal respiratory failure. Injuries to the lungs are often fatal, and survivors often have a reduced quality of life. Injuries to the diaphragm are uncommon and rarely serious, but blunt trauma to the diaphragm can result in the formation of a hernia over time. Injuries to the diaphragm may present in many ways, including abnormal blood pressure, cardiac arrest, gastroinetestinal obstruction, and respiratory insufficiency. Injuries to the diaphragm are often associated with other injuries in the chest or abdomen, and its position between two major cavities of the human body may complicate diagnosis.

=== Skin ===
Most injuries to the skin are minor and do not require specialist treatment. Lacerations of the skin are typically repaired with sutures, staples, or adhesives. The skin is susceptible to burns, and burns to the skin often cause blistering. Abrasive trauma scrapes or rubs off the skin, and severe abrasions require skin grafting to repair. Skin tears involve the removal of the epidermis or dermis through friction or shearing forces, often in vulnerable populations such as the elderly. Skin injuries are potentially complicated by foreign bodies such as glass, metal, or dirt that entered the wound, and skin wounds often require cleaning.

== Treatment ==

Much of medical practice is dedicated to the treatment of injuries. Traumatology is the study of traumatic injuries and injury repair. Certain injuries may be treated by specialists. Serious injuries sometimes require trauma surgery. Following serious injuries, physical therapy and occupational therapy are sometimes used for rehabilitation. Medication is commonly used to treat injuries.

Emergency medicine during major trauma prioritizes the immediate consideration of life-threatening injuries that can be quickly addressed. The airway is evaluated, clearing bodily fluids with suctioning or creating an artificial airway if necessary. Breathing is evaluated by evaluating motion of the chest wall and checking for blood or air in the pleural cavity. Circulation is evaluated to resuscitate the patient, including the application of intravenous therapy. Disability is evaluated by checking for responsiveness and reflexes. Exposure is then used to examine the patient for external injury. Following immediate life-saving procedures, a CT scan is used for a more thorough diagnosis. Further resuscitation may be required, including ongoing blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation and nutritional support.

Pain management is another aspect of injury treatment. Pain serves as an indicator to determine the nature and severity of an injury, but it can also worsen an injury, reduce mobility, and affect quality of life. Analgesic drugs are used to reduce the pain associated with injuries, depending on the person&#x27;s age, the severity of the injury, and previous medical conditions that may affect pain relief. NSAIDs such as aspirin and ibuprofen are commonly used for acute pain. Opioid medications such as fentanyl, methadone, and morphine are used to treat severe pain in major trauma, but their use is limited due to associated long-term risks such as addiction.

=== Complications ===
Complications may arise as a result of certain injuries, increasing the recovery time, further exasperating the symptoms, or potentially causing death. The extent of the injury and the age of the injured person may contribute to the likelihood of complications. Infection of wounds is a common complication in traumatic injury, resulting in diagnoses such as pneumonia or sepsis. Wound infection prevents the healing process from taking place and can cause further damage to the body. A majority of wounds are contaminated with microbes from other parts of the body, and infection takes place when the immune system is unable to address this contamination. The surgical removing of devitalized tissue and the use of topical antimicrobial agents can prevent infection.

Hemorrhaging of blood is a common result of injuries, and it can cause several complications. Pooling of blood under the skin can cause a hematoma, particularly after blunt trauma or the suture of a laceration. Hematomas are susceptible to infection and are typically treated compression, though surgery is necessary in severe cases. Excessive blood loss can cause hypovolemic shock in which cellular oxygenation can no longer take place. This can cause tachycardia, hypotension, coma, or organ failure. Fluid replacement is often necessary to treat blood loss. Other complications of injuries include cavitation, development of fistulas, and organ failure.

== Social and psychological aspects ==
Injuries often cause psychological harm in addition to physical harm. Traumatic injuries are associated with psychological trauma and distress, and some victims of traumatic injuries will display symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder during and after the recovery of the injury. The specific symptoms and their triggers vary depending on the nature of the injury. Body image and self-esteem can also be affected by injury. Injuries that cause permanent disabilities, such as spinal cord injuries, can have severe effects on self-esteem. Disfiguring injuries can negatively affect body image, leading to a lower quality of life. Burn injuries in particular can cause dramatic changes in a person&#x27;s appearance that may negatively affect body image.

Severe injury can also cause social harm. Disfiguring injuries may also result in stigma due to scarring or other changes in appearance. Certain injuries may necessitate a change in occupation or prevent employment entirely. Leisure activities are similarly limited, and athletic activities in particular may be impossible following severe injury. In some cases, the effects of injury may strain personal relationships, such as marriages. Psychological and social variables have been found to affect the likelihood of injuries among athletes. Increased life stress can cause an increase in the likelihood of athletic injury, while social support can decrease the likelihood of injury. Social support also assists in the recovery process after athletic injuries occur.

<doc id="515538" wikidata="Q214696" url="?curid=515538" title="Mount Nyiragongo">
<text>Mount Nyiragongo ( ) is an active stratovolcano with an elevation of in the Virunga Mountains associated with the Albertine Rift. It is located inside Virunga National Park, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, about north of the town of Goma and Lake Kivu and just west of the border with Rwanda. The main crater is about wide and usually contains a lava lake. The crater presently has two distinct cooled lava benches within the crater walls – one at about and a lower one at about . 

Nyiragongo&#x27;s lava lake has at times been the most voluminous known lava lake in recent history. The depth of the lava lake varies considerably. A maximum elevation of the lava lake was recorded at about prior to the January 1977 eruption – a lake depth of about . Following the January 2002 eruption, the lava lake was recorded at a low of about , or below the rim. The level has gradually risen since then. Nyiragongo and nearby Nyamuragira are together responsible for 40% of Africa&#x27;s historical volcanic eruptions.

==Geology==

The volcano partly overlaps with two older volcanoes, Baruta and Shaheru, and is also surrounded by hundreds of small volcanic cinder cones from flank eruptions.

Nyiragongo&#x27;s cone consists of pyroclastics and lava flows. Nyiragongo&#x27;s lavas are low-silica, alkali-rich, ultramafic extrusive rocks essentially free of feldspars. They range from olivine-rich melilitites through leucites to nephelinites, containing, in various proportions mainly the minerals nepheline, leucite, melilite, kalsilite, and clinopyroxene. This very low silica composition results in eruptions with unusually fluid flows. Whereas most lava flows move rather slowly and rarely pose a danger to human life, Nyiragongo&#x27;s lava flows may race downhill at up to .

==Active history==
Not much is known about how long the volcano has been erupting, but it has erupted at least 34 times since 1882, including many periods where activity was continuous for years at a time, often in the form of a churning lava lake in the crater. The existence of the lava lake had been suspected for some time but was not scientifically confirmed until 1948. At that time, it was measured at nearly . Subsequent expeditions showed that the lake fluctuated in size, depth, and temperature over time.

The lava lake activity is ongoing. , the lake is mostly confined within a broad, steep-sided cinder cone (roughly high by wide) on the crater floor.

=== 1977 eruption ===
Between 1894 and 1977 the crater contained an active lava lake. On 10 January 1977, the crater walls fractured, and the lava lake drained in less than an hour. The lava flowed down the flanks of the volcano at speeds of up to on the upper slopes, the fastest lava flow recorded to date, overwhelming villages and killing at least 50 people in the villages of Kibati and Moniki, according to reports made at the time. 

Within 30 minutes, the lava lake had emptied, flowing north, south, and west of the volcano. Nowhere else in the world does such a steep-sided stratovolcano contain a lake of such fluid lava. Nyiragongo&#x27;s proximity to heavily populated areas increases its potential for causing a natural disaster. The 1977 eruption raised awareness of the unique dangers posed by Nyiragongo, and because of this, in 1991 it was designated a Decade Volcano, worthy of particular study.

The 1977 eruption was preceded by the creation of a new small volcanic vent, Murara, a short distance away on the slopes of Nyamuragira.

===2002 eruptions===
Lava lakes reformed in the crater in eruptions in 1982–1983 and 1994. Another major eruption of the volcano began on 17 January 2002, after several months of increased seismic and fumarolic activity. A fissure opened in the south flank of the volcano, spreading in a few hours from elevation and reaching the outskirts of the city of Goma, the provincial capital on the northern shore of Lake Kivu. Lava streamed from three spatter cones at the end of the fissure and flowed in a stream wide and up to deep through Goma. Warnings had been given and 400,000 people were evacuated from the city across the Rwandan border into neighbouring Gisenyi during the eruption. Lava covered the northern end of the runway at Goma International Airport, leaving the southern two-thirds usable, and reached Lake Kivu. This raised fears that the lava might cause gas-saturated waters deep in the lake to suddenly rise to the surface, releasing lethally large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane – similar to the disaster at Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986. This did not happen, but volcanologists continue to monitor the area closely.

About 245 people died in the eruption from asphyxiation by carbon dioxide and buildings collapsing due to the lava and earthquakes. Lava covered 13 percent of Goma, about , and nearly 120,000 people were left homeless.

Immediately after the eruption stopped, a large number of earthquakes were felt around Goma and Gisenyi. This swarm activity continued for about three months and caused the collapse of more buildings.

Six months after the start of the 2002 eruption, Nyiragongo volcano erupted again. 

===Ongoing threat===
Localized carbon dioxide toxicity, known locally as &#x27;mazuku&#x27;, has killed children even more recently. In locations where the gas seeps from the ground at relatively high levels, without the dispersing effects of wind, its effects can be deadly. On 8 March 2016, Goma Volcano Observatory discovered a new vent that opened in the northeast edge of the crater, following local reports of rumblings coming from the volcano. Some fear that this could lead to a flank eruption. Observers in 2020 witnessed a rise in the lava lake and other signs of an impending eruption. 

=== 2021 eruption ===
An eruption began on 22 May 2021. Lava approached the Goma airport and moved towards the city centre of eastern Goma. It was later confirmed by the North Kivu province&#x27;s military governor that the eruption was at around 17:00 GMT. A highway to Beni was cut off by lava, and authorities urged residents from the city of Goma to evacuate, causing thousands of people to leave their homes. There was also an electricity cut across large areas following the eruption. As of 27 May 2021, 37 people were missing and presumed dead, after a lava flow reached the outskirts of the city of Goma. The eruption resulted in at least 32 deaths, mostly caused by car crashes in the ensuing evacuation.

==Monitoring==
The volcano is continuously monitored by a team of scientists at the Goma Volcanic Observatory (GVO), with seismic data produced every four minutes and temperature data produced every ten minutes. Continued funding for the GVO is in doubt, as the World Bank decided in 2020 to terminate its contributions.

<text>Adam-ondi-Ahman (, sometimes clipped to Diahman) is a historic site in Daviess County, Missouri, about five miles south of Jameson. It is located along the east bluffs above the Grand River. According to the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an Adam-ondi-Ahman, but not necessarily the site in Daviess County, Missouri, is the site where Adam and Eve lived after being expelled from the Garden of Eden. It teaches that the place will be a gathering spot for a meeting of the priesthood leadership, including prophets of all ages and other righteous people, prior to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

The Latter Day Saints once proposed building a Temple on the site. Such efforts were halted in the 19th century as a result of the 1838 Mormon War to evict the Latter Day Saints from Missouri. Their having declared Adam-ondi-Ahman as a sacred site for a Temple was a flash point in that confrontation.

After the Latter Day Saints were evicted, residents renamed the site Cravensville. It was the site of a skirmish during the American Civil War on August 4, 1862, when Union troops attempted to stop Confederate reinforcements in the First Battle of Independence. Six Confederates were killed and 10 wounded. The Union forces had five wounded.

Today, most of the site is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and is used predominantly as farmland.

==History==
In the 1830s, Latter Day Saints who were being forced out of Jackson County, Missouri, settled just south of Daviess County in Caldwell County, in the settlement of Far West. In February 1838, Lyman Wight built a home and established a ferry on the Grand River at a spot known as &quot;Wight&#x27;s Ferry.&quot;

That spring, Joseph Smith visited the site. He proclaimed there were either two or three (depending on subsequent interpretations) altars built by Adam at the site. One altar Smith called the &quot;altar of prayer&quot;; it was located by Wight&#x27;s house on Tower Hill. It was described as &quot;sixteen feet long, by nine or ten feet wide, having its greatest extent north and south. The height of the altar at each end was some two and a half feet, gradually rising higher to the center, which was between four and five feet high—the whole surface being crowning.&quot; The other altar—called the &quot;altar of sacrifice&quot;—was said to be a mile to the north on top of Spring Hill.

On May 19, 1838, Smith formally revealed his belief that Adam-ondi-Ahman was the place where Adam and Eve went after being exiled from the Garden of Eden. On June 25, 1838, at a conference in Wight&#x27;s orchard, a Latter Day Saint settlement at Adam-ondi-Ahman was formally established. Within a few months, its population grew to 1500.

Non-Mormon settlers grew worried that the Latter-day Saints would seize political control of Daviess County. On August 6, 1838, a group of non-Mormons tried to prevent Latter Day Saint settlers from voting in the local elections at Gallatin. The Mormons fought back and defeated the mob in a skirmish that came to be known as the Gallatin Election Day Battle. This was the opening skirmish in the Mormon War.

In the course of the conflict, non-Mormon vigilantes from neighboring counties came to Daviess and burned Latter-day Saint homes. Latter-day Saint refugees gathered at Adam-ondi-Ahman for protection. Latter-day Saints responded to the attacks by leading their own forces from Caldwell County. Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs issued Missouri Executive Order 44, in which he declared that &quot;the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State&quot; and called out 2500 militiamen.

In October 1838, Smith, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball and other Latter-day Saint leaders gathered to dedicate the temple square on the highest point on the bluff. Smith, Wight and others surrendered on November 1, 1838, on charges of murder, arson, theft, rebellion, and treason. After a preliminary court hearing was held November 12 to 29 in Richmond, Smith and Wight were transferred to the jail in Liberty.

On November 7, 1838, the Latter Day Saints were told they had ten days to abandon the settlement. They moved to Far West, Missouri.

On April 9, 1839, Smith was sent to the Daviess County Jail in Gallatin for a hearing, where a grand jury indicted him. On April 15, following the granting of a change of venue, Smith was permitted by his guards to escape while en route to Boone County, Missouri, a day after getting supplies at Adam-ondi-Ahman. Most of the Latter Day Saints had left Missouri by early 1839. The refugees gathered in Illinois and later regrouped at the new Mormon center of Nauvoo. Although many Latter Day Saints were tried for their part in the war, no non-Mormon vigilantes were brought to trial.

Because the Latter-day Saints held their lands in Adam-ondi-Ahman by preemption, all of their rights and improvements were lost when they were forced to leave. Their losses are recorded in a set of &quot;Mormon Redress Petitions&quot; collected and edited by Clark V. Johnson. Most of the land in Adam-ondi-Ahman was purchased by John Cravens, who renamed the town &quot;Cravensville.&quot;

In 1947, Wilford C. Wood purchased 38 acres in the area to begin to return the land to the LDS Church, including the location identified as Tower Hill and the remains of a cabin built by Lyman Wight. Today, of Adam-ondi-Ahman is owned and maintained as a historic site by the LDS Church and remains largely undeveloped farmland.

==Religious significance==

Adam-ondi-Ahman is the subject of a revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded in the LDS Church edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, a book of scripture within the Latter Day Saint movement: “Spring Hill is named by the Lord Adam-ondi-Ahman, because, said he, it is the place where Adam shall come to visit his people, or the Ancient of Days shall sit, as spoken of by Daniel the prophet.”

Contemporaries of Smith stated that he taught that the Garden of Eden was located in the vicinity of Independence, Missouri, and that after Adam and Eve were banished from the garden, they went to Adam-ondi-Ahman.

According to a revelation declared by Smith, Adam met his children at the site three years before his death to bestow his blessing. LDS Church leader Joseph Fielding Smith has written that this is the site of a future grand council where Jesus Christ will meet with His stewards of all dispensations and receive back the keys of the kingdom in preparation for His Second Coming. Only those called to the meeting will know of its occurrence.

===Meaning of the name===
According to the belief of some Latter Day Saints, the term &quot;Adam-ondi-Ahman&quot; is part of the Adamic language. The name was also the title of a hymn that was popular in the early church.

&quot;Adam-ondi-Ahman&quot; has been speculatively translated as the &quot;Valley of God, where Adam dwelt&quot; (by Latter Day Saint apostle Orson Pratt), &quot;the valley of God in which Adam blessed his children&quot; (by John Corrill), &quot;Adam&#x27;s grave&quot; (by Community of Christ historian Heman C. Smith), or &quot;Adam with God&quot;, because elsewhere in the Doctrine and Covenants &quot;Son Ahman&quot; is said to refer to Jesus.

<doc id="515547" wikidata="Q681696" url="?curid=515547" title="Semiosis">
<text>Semiosis (, ), or sign process, is any form of activity, conduct, or process that involves signs, including the production of meaning. A sign is anything that communicates a meaning, that is not the sign itself, to the interpreter of the sign. The meaning can be intentional such as a word uttered with a specific meaning, or unintentional, such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can communicate through any of the senses, visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or taste. 

The term was introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) to describe a process that interprets signs as referring to their objects, as described in his theory of sign relations, or semiotics. Other theories of sign processes are sometimes carried out under the heading of semiology, following on the work of Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913).

==Overview==
Peirce was interested primarily in logic, while Saussure was interested primarily in linguistics, which examines the functions and structures of language. However, both of them recognized that there is more to significant representation than language in the narrow sense of speech and writing alone. With this in mind, they developed the idea of semiosis to relate language to other sign systems both human and nonhuman. Today, there is disagreement as to the operating cause and effect. One school of thought argues that language is the semiotic prototype and its study illuminates principles that can be applied to other sign systems. The opposing school argues that there is a metasign system and that language is simply one of many codes for communicating meaning, citing the way in which human infants learn about their environment before they have acquired verbal language. Whichever may be right, a preliminary definition of semiosis is any action or influence for communicating meaning by establishing relationships between signs which are to be interpreted by an audience.

==Discussion==
Semiosis is the performance element involving signs. Although a human can communicate many &quot;things&quot; unintentionally, individuals usually speak or write to elicit some kind of response. Yet there is little real explanation of how semiosis produces its effects, which is odd given that the word &quot;sign&quot; is in everyday use and most people would understand what it means. But semiotics has not offered clear technical definitions, nor is there agreement about how signs should be classified. 

As an insect (or any animal, human or otherwise) moves through its environment (sometimes termed the umwelt), all the senses collect data that are made available to the brain. However, to prevent sensory overload, only salient data will receive the full attention of the cognitive elements of the mind. This indicates that a part of the process must be controlled by a model of the real world capable of ranking data elements in terms of their significance and filtering out the data irrelevant to survival. A sign cannot function until the brain or audience distinguishes it from the background &quot;noise&quot;. When this happens, the sign then triggers cognitive activity to interpret the data input and so convert it into meaningful information. This would suggest that, in the semiosphere, the process of semiosis goes through the following cycle:
*The plant, insect, or animal with the need to communicate (e.g., to recognise an object of food) will &quot;know&quot; what needs to be &quot;said&quot; and assess the best means of &quot;saying&quot; it (e.g., starting a searching behaviour);
*This information will then be encoded and relevant muscle groups will effect transmission — although to some extent intentional in the human, the actual movements of the body are autonomic, i.e. the individual is not aware of moving individual muscles, but achieves the desired result by an act of will (see H. L. A. Hart on the nature of an action);
*The audience filters ambient data and perceives the uttered code as a grouping of signs;
*The audience then interprets the signs (sometimes termed decoding) to attribute meaning. This involves matching the signs received against existing patterns and their meanings held in memory (i.e. it is learned and understood within the community). In plants, insects and animals, the results of a successful interpretation will be an observable response to the stimuli perceived.
In biology, scout bees and ants will return home to &quot;tell&quot; the others where food is to be found, the fact of fertility must be announced to prospective mates from the same species, and the presence of danger must be passed as a warning to others in the group. Such transmission may be chemical, auditory, visual, or tactile whether singly or in combination. There is a new field of research activity termed biosemiotics, and Jesper Hoffmeyer claims that endosymbiosis, self-reference, code duality, the availability of receptors, autopoiesis, and others are the general properties of all living systems. Thomas Sebeok suggests that a similar list of properties for life may coincide with the definition of semiosis, i.e. that the test of whether &quot;something&quot; is alive, is a test to determine whether and how it communicates meaning to another of its kind, i.e., whether it has semiosis. This has been called the Sebeok&#x27;s Thesis.

For humans, semiosis is an aspect of the wider systems of social interaction in which information is exchanged. It can result in particular types of social encounter, but the process itself can be constrained by social conventions such as propriety, privacy, and disclosure. This means that no social encounter is reducible to semiosis alone, and that semiosis can only be understood by identifying and exploring all the conditions that make the transmission and reception of signs possible and effective. When two individuals meet, the ways in which they think, the specific identities they assume, the emotional responses they make, and the beliefs, motives, and purposes they have, will frame the situation as it develops dynamically and potentially test the legitimacy of the outcomes. All these elements are, to a greater or lesser extent, semiotic in nature in that prevailing codes and values are being applied. Consequently, where the line is drawn between semiosis and semiotics will always be somewhat arbitrary.

<text>USS &quot;Augusta&quot; (CL/CA-31) was a of the United States Navy, notable for service as a headquarters ship during Operation Torch, Operation Overlord, and Operation Dragoon, and for her occasional use as a presidential flagship carrying both Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman under wartime conditions (including at the Atlantic Charter). She was named after Augusta, Georgia, and was sponsored by Miss Evelyn McDaniel of that city.

==Construction==

&quot;Augusta&quot;, a &quot;Treaty&quot; cruiser of 10,000 tons normal displacement, was laid down on 2 July 1928 at Newport News, Virginia, by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co.; launched on 1 February 1930, sponsored by Evelyn McDaniel of Augusta, Georgia; and commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 30 January 1931, Captain James O. Richardson in command. Originally classified as a light cruiser, CL-31, because of her thin armor. Effective 1 July 1931, &quot;Augusta&quot; was redesignated a heavy cruiser, CA-31, because of her 8-inch guns in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930.

==Service history==
Damage to one of her turbines curtailed the ship&#x27;s original shakedown cruise, but &quot;Augusta&quot; conducted abbreviated initial training during a cruise to Colón, Panama, and back, before she was assigned duty as flagship for Commander, Scouting Force, Vice Admiral Arthur L. Willard, on 21 May 1931. During the summer of 1931, she operated with the other warships of Scouting Force, carrying out tactical exercises off the New England coast. In September, &quot;Augusta&quot; moved south to Chesapeake Bay, where she joined her colleagues in their normal fall gunnery drills until mid-November, when the cruisers retired to their home ports. &quot;Augusta&quot; entered the Norfolk Navy Yard at that time.

At the beginning of 1932 she and the other cruisers of the Scouting Force reassembled in Hampton Roads, whence they departed on 8 January on their way to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. &quot;Augusta&quot; conducted training evolutions with the Scouting Force in the vicinity of Guantanamo Bay until 18 February, when the force headed for the Panama Canal on its way to the eastern Pacific to participate in Fleet Problem XIII. She arrived in San Pedro, California, on 7 March but returned to sea three days later to execute the fleet problem. During the maneuvers &quot;Augusta&quot; and her colleagues in Scouting Force squared off against Battle Force in defense of three simulated &quot;atolls&quot; located at widely separated points on the West Coast. The exercises afforded the Fleet training in strategic scouting and an opportunity to practice defending and attacking a convoy.

The Fleet Problem ended on 18 March, but &quot;Augusta&quot; and the rest of Scouting Force did not return to the Atlantic at its conclusion as was normal. In a gesture that presaged Roosevelt&#x27;s retention of the Fleet at Pearl Harbor in 1940 after Fleet Problem XXI, the Hoover Administration kept the Fleet concentrated on the West Coast throughout 1932 in the unrealized hope that it might restrain Japanese aggression in China. In fact, Scouting Force was still on the West Coast almost a year later when the time came for Fleet Problem XIV in February 1933, and the Roosevelt Administration, which took office in March, proceeded to keep it there indefinitely. Consequently, &quot;Augusta&quot; continued to operate in the eastern Pacific until relieved of duty as Scouting Force&#x27;s flagship late in October 1933. The cruiser left the Navy Yard, Puget Sound, Washington, and sailed for China on 20 October.

===Asiatic Fleet===
Steaming along the Northern Pacific &quot;Great Circle&quot; route from Seattle to Shanghai, &quot;Augusta&quot; moored in the Huangpu River, at Shanghai, on the morning of 9 November 1933. That afternoon, Admiral Frank B. Upham, Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet (CinCAF), broke his flag on board the newly arrived cruiser, and his old flagship, , sailed for the United States.

Soon after she broke Admiral Upham&#x27;s flag and &quot;Houston&quot; sailed for home, &quot;Augusta&quot; proceeded south from Shanghai in December 1933, and, over the next few months, operated in the Philippines, interspersing training with her yearly at Cavite and Olongapo.

That spring, &quot;Augusta&quot; returned to China waters, &quot;showing the flag&quot;, and then steamed to Yokohama, Japan, arriving there on 4 June 1934. At 07:30 the following morning, Admiral Upham left the ship to attend the state funeral ceremonies for the late Fleet Admiral Heihachiro Togo; &quot;Augusta&quot; commenced firing 19 one-minute guns in honor of the Japanese naval hero at 08:30. Departing Yokohama with Admiral Upham embarked on 11 June, the cruiser then visited Kobe (12 to 15 June) before she proceeded to Qingdao, arriving there on 17 June, departing for Qinhuangdao 10 September, departing for Yantai 24 September, then departing for Shanghai 25 September, arriving 26 September.

&quot;Augusta&quot; remained in Chinese waters, then departed Shanghai for Guam on 5 October 1934, under command of Captain Chester W. Nimitz, arriving there on the 10th. Sailing the next day, she proceeded to Australian waters for the first time, reaching Sydney on the 20th. Total complement at this time was 824: 64 officers and 760 enlisted. She remained there a week, while Admiral Upham visited the capital of Australia, Canberra, on 25 and 26 October. With CinCAF back on board on the 26th, &quot;Augusta&quot; cleared Sydney the following day for Melbourne, arriving there on 29 October. She remained there, observing the city&#x27;s centenary ceremonies, until 13 November, when she sailed for Fremantle and Perth. On 20 November she sailed for the Dutch East Indies.

&quot;Augusta&quot; reached Batavia (now Jakarta) on 25 November and remained there until 3 December, when she sailed for Bali, arriving at the port of Labuhan Amok on 5 December. Underway again on the 8th, &quot;Augusta&quot; touched at Sandakan (14 to 16 December), Zamboanga (17 to 19 December), and Iloilo (20 to 21 December), before reaching Manila on the 22nd.

The heavy cruiser remained in the Philippine Islands, receiving her usual yearly overhaul at Cavite and drydocking at Olongapo, in , before she re-embarked Admiral Upham and sailed for Hong Kong on 15 March 1935. Arriving on the 16th, &quot;Augusta&quot; remained there until the 25th, while CinCAF was embarked in for a trip to Canton (17 to 20 March 1935). (The cruiser&#x27;s draft did not permit her to make the passage up the Pearl River to Canton.) &quot;Augusta&quot; got underway again on the 25th for Amoy (now Xiamen) and stayed there from 26 to 29 March, before she proceeded thence to Shanghai, arriving at that port city on the last day of March.

&quot;Augusta&quot; remained at Shanghai until 30 April, when she sailed for her second visit to Japan, reaching Yokohama on 3 May 1935. The ship remained there for two weeks. Steaming thence to Kobe, and arriving there on 18 May for a week&#x27;s sojourn, &quot;Augusta&quot; sailed for China on 25 May, and reached Nanjing, the Chinese capital, on the 29th.

The flagship remained at Nanjing until 4 June, then sailed for Shanghai, arriving the following day. &quot;Augie Maru&quot;, as her crew had affectionately nicknamed her, stayed at Shanghai until 27 June, and sailed for North China, reaching Qingdao on the 29th. She remained there, carrying out exercises and gunnery practice, for the rest of the summer.

&quot;Augusta&quot; departed Qingdao on 30 September for Shanghai, arriving on 1 October, where, four days later, Admiral Orin G. Murfin relieved Admiral Upham as CinCAF. On 8 October, with the new CinCAF embarked, &quot;Augusta&quot; departed Shanghai for points south. Admiral Murfin transferred to &quot;Isabel&quot; to visit Bangkok (15 to 22 October), while he returned to the heavy cruiser to visit Singapore (24 to 30 October). Subsequently touching at Pontianak and Jesselton on Borneo, (31 October to 1 November and from 3 to 5 November respectively), &quot;Augie Maru&quot; visited the southern Philippine ports of Zamboanga (6 to 8 November) and Iloilo (9 to 10 November), before she returned to Manila on 11 November 1935.

While &quot;Augusta&quot; underwent her annual overhaul at Cavite and Olongapo, Admiral Murfin flew his flag in &quot;Isabel&quot; from 14 December 1935 to 27 February 1936. Soon afterwards the heavy cruiser, again having CinCAF on board, sailed for the a succession of Philippine ports and places: Catbalogan, Cebu, Tacloban, Davao, Dumanquilas, Zamboanga, Tutu Bay, Jolo, and Tawi Tawi, before the ship returned to Manila on 29 March.

On 31 March &quot;Augusta&quot; sailed to Hong Kong, arriving on 2 April, remaining there until the 11th. During this time, Admiral Murfin embarked in &quot;Isabel&quot; for the trip up the Pearl River to Canton (6 to 8 April), returning on the latter date to reembark in his flagship to resume his voyage up the China coast. Visiting Amoy on 12 and 13 April, &quot;Augusta&quot; then paused briefly at Wusong on 16 April before proceeding up the Yangtze, reaching Nanjing on the following day. While &quot;Augusta&quot; navigated down the Yangtze to the Huangpu River, and Shanghai, Admiral Murfin continued up the Yangtze to Hankou (now Wuhan) in &quot;Isabel&quot;, flew to Yichang, then in to Crossing 22, and finally back to Hankou and Shanghai in &quot;Isabel&quot;, where he rejoined &quot;Augusta&quot; on 4 May.

&quot;Augusta&quot; sailed for Japan on 21 May, for her third visit to that country, arriving at Yokohama on the 25th. The Asiatic Fleet flagship remained at that port until 5 June, when she sailed for Kobe, arriving there the following day. She remained in Japanese waters until 13 June, when she got underway for Qingdao, arriving on the 16th.

&quot;Augusta&quot; remained at Qingdao, operating thence on exercises and training, for two months, then sailed for Yantai on 17 August. Arriving the same day, she departed Yantai on the 21st, and returned to Qingdao, remaining there into mid-September.

Underway for Qinhuangdao, the port at the foot of the Great Wall of China, on 14 September, &quot;Augusta&quot; reached her destination on the 15th, where Admiral Murfin disembarked to visit the old imperial city of Beiping (now Beijing). Following his inspection of the Marine Corps legation guard at that city, CinCAF returned to Qinhuangdao by train and reembarked in his flagship on 25 September. Underway from Qinhuangdao on the 28th, &quot;Augusta&quot; visited Yantai before returning to Qingdao on the following day, 29 September 1936.

&quot;Augusta&quot; stood out of Qingdao on the same day she arrived and reached Shanghai on 1 October. At the end of that month, on 30 October, Admiral Murfin was relieved as CinCAF by Admiral Harry E. Yarnell. Shortly afterwards, with her new CinCAF embarked, &quot;Augusta&quot; stood down the Huangpu River on 3 November 1936 on her annual southern cruise.

&quot;Augusta&quot; again visited a succession of ports: Hong Kong (5 to 12 November), Singapore (16 to 23 November), Batavia (25 November to 1 December), Bali (4 to 7 December), Makassar (8 to 12 December), Tawi Tawi and Tutu Bay (14 December), Dumanquilas Bay (15 December), Zamboanga (15 to 16 December), and Cebu (17 December), before she returned to Manila on 19 December. Admiral Yarnell transferred his flag to &quot;Isabel&quot; on 2 January 1937, when &quot;Augusta&quot; entered Cavite Navy Yard for repairs and alterations that included the fitting of splinter protection around the machine gun positions at the foretop and atop the mainmast. The CinCAF used &quot;Isabel&quot; as his flagship through March, rejoining &quot;Augusta&quot; at Manila on 29 March 1937.

&quot;Augusta&quot; remained in Philippine waters for the next several days, at Manila (29 March to 2 April) and Malampaya (on 3 and 4 April) before she returned to Manila on the 5th. Touching briefly at Port San Pio Quinto on 7 and 8 April, the Asiatic Fleet flagship sailed for Hong Kong on the 8th, arriving at the British Crown Colony the following day. Shifting his flag to &quot;Isabel&quot; for the trip to Canton, Admiral Yarnell returned to &quot;Augusta&quot; on 13 April, and the heavy cruiser sailed for Shantou on the 18th. The ship visited that South China port on the 19th, and Amoy the following day, before the CinCAF shifted his flag again to &quot;Isabel&quot; for a brief trip to Pagoda Anchorage (21 to 22 April), rejoining the heavy cruiser on the 23rd.

&quot;Augusta&quot; stood up the Huangpu River on 24 April and arrived at Shanghai that day, mooring just upstream from the city proper. She remained at Shanghai until 5 May, when she sailed for Nanjing. The flagship remained at that Yangtze port from 6 May to 9 May before she got underway on the latter day for Jiujiang, further up the Yangtze. Shifting his flag to &quot;Isabel&quot;, Admiral Yarnell then visited Hankou and Yichang in that ship, transferring thence on 22 May to &quot;Panay&quot; at Yichang for the voyage up the Yangtze through the gorges and rapids that lay above that port. After visiting Chongqing, the CinCAF returned to Yichang in , where he rejoined &quot;Isabel&quot; for the trip to Hankou and Nanjing. Admiral Yarnell eventually rejoined &quot;Augusta&quot; at Shanghai on 2 June 1937.

Clearing Shanghai on 7 June, &quot;Augusta&quot; sailed for North China, and reached Qinhuangdao on the 9th, where Admiral Yarnell disembarked with members of his staff to journey to Beiping by rail, where the admiral would conduct the yearly CinCAF inspection of the legation guard. The admiral rejoined the cruiser at Qinhuangdao on 22 June and the ship sailed for Yantai (visiting that port on 24 and 25 June) and Qingdao, arriving there on 26 June for the summer.

&quot;Augusta&quot; was conducting her usual training from Qingdao when events elsewhere in that region took a turn for the worse. Political relations between China and Japan had been strained for some time. The Chinese attitude toward the steady and unrelenting Japanese encroachment into North China in the wake of the 1931 seizure of Manchuria was stiffening. Chiang Kai-shek, China&#x27;s leader, asserted that China had been pushed too far, and launched strenuous efforts to improve his nation&#x27;s military posture.

On the night of 7 July 1937 Japanese and Chinese units exchanged gunfire near the ornate Marco Polo Bridge in the outskirts of Beiping. The incident quickly escalated into a state of hostilities in North China, with the Japanese taking Beiping against little resistance by the end of July. Against this backdrop of ominous developments, Admiral Yarnell considered cancelling a goodwill visit to the Soviet port of Vladivostok, but was ordered to proceed.

Keeping a wary eye on developments in China, Admiral Yarnell sailed for Vladivostok in &quot;Augusta&quot; on 24 July, accompanied by four destroyers. After passing through the edge of a typhoon, &quot;Augusta&quot; and her consorts reached that Soviet port on the 28th, and remained there until 1 August, the first United States naval vessels to visit that port since the closing of the naval radio station there in 1922. As Yarnell later wrote, &quot;The visit of this force evidently has meant a great deal to these people&quot;, as both officers and men were lavishly entertained.

Departing Vladivostok on 1 August, &quot;Augusta&quot; and the four destroyers sailed for Chinese waters, the latter returning to their base at Yantai and &quot;Augusta&quot; returning to Qingdao, where Admiral Yarnell continued to receive intelligence on the situation in North China and, as events developed around Shanghai, where increasing Chinese pressure on the comparatively small Japanese Special Naval Landing Force led to a build-up of Japanese naval units in the Huangpu River leading to that port. Hostilities commenced within days after the death of a Japanese lieutenant and his driver near a Chinese airfield on 9 August. With considerable American interests in the International Settlement of Shanghai, Admiral Yarnell deemed it best to sail there, on the morning of 13 August 1937, to make it his base of operations.

Her passage slowed by a typhoon which caused the ship to reduce her speed to five knots (9 km/h) and which produced rolls of 30 degrees and washed away the port 26-foot (8 m) motor whaleboat and its davits, &quot;Augusta&quot; reached her destination the following day, and stood up the Huangpu River. En route to her moorings she passed many Japanese warships, principally light cruisers and destroyers, which duly rendered the prescribed passing honors to &quot;Augusta&quot;″s embarked admiral.

Meanwhile, at Shanghai proper, Chinese Air Force Northrop 2E light attack bomber aircraft had tried to bomb Japanese positions in their portion of the International Settlement; the bombs fell short and caused extensive damage and heavy loss of life in the neutral portion of the settlement. One plane which had retained its bombs proceeded down the Huangpu and dropped two bombs which exploded in the water off &quot;Augusta&quot;″s starboard bow. Large American flags were then painted on top of &quot;Augusta&quot;″s three main battery gunhouses to identify her as neutral.

On 18 August &quot;Augusta&quot; unmoored, moved further upstream, and moored off the Shanghai Bund, assisted by tugs. She remained there, in a prominent position off the famous &quot;Bund&quot;, into January 1938, observing the Sino-Japanese hostilities at close range.

Initially, there was the problem of evacuating Americans from the war zone. American merchantmen called at Shanghai to do so, passengers travelling downstream to waiting steamships on the Dollar Line tender guarded by sailors from &quot;Augusta&quot;″s landing force. The flagship&#x27;s Marine Detachment, meanwhile, went ashore to aid the 4th Marines in establishing defensive positions to keep hostilities out of the neutral enclaves. On 20 August 1937, while the flagship&#x27;s crew gathered amidships on the well deck for the evening movies, a Chinese anti-aircraft shell landed among the sailors, killing Seaman 1st/Class F. J. Falgout and wounding 18 others. Ten days later Chinese planes bombed the American Dollar Line SS &quot;President Hoover&quot; off the mouth of the Huangpu, with one death and several wounded. American ships ceased calling at Shanghai as a result, and Admiral Yarnell&#x27;s attempts to get a division of heavy cruisers to carry out the evacuation met resistance from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

At Shanghai &quot;Augusta&quot;″s officers and men could observe the war. Her moorings proved a good vantage point from which Americans could size up the Japanese Navy and judge how well its ships and planes operated, an opportunity not lost on Admiral Yarnell, who sent insightful intelligence reports back to Washington, striving to alert the United States Navy to the character and capabilities of the navy many regarded as the future enemy.

On 12 December 1937 Japanese naval planes sank the US gunboat &quot;Panay&quot; and three Standard Oil tankers north of Nanjing, in the Yangtze River. Soon afterwards the ship&#x27;s survivors arrived at Shanghai in &quot;Panay&quot;″s sister ship, , which moored alongside Augusta on the 19th. They spent Christmas with Augusta&#x27;s crew.

On 6 January 1938 &quot;Augusta&quot; departed Shanghai for the Philippines for her yearly overhaul. Admiral Yarnell, however, his presence in China deemed necessary to uphold American prestige in the Orient, remained in Shanghai with a token staff on board &quot;Isabel&quot;. He ultimately rejoined &quot;Augusta&quot; when she returned to Shanghai on 9 April 1938 after her overhaul.

Proceeding north along the China coast, &quot;Augusta&quot; visited Qingdao (12 May to 13 May) and Yantai (14 May) before she arrived at Qinhuangdao on 15 May. There, Admiral Yarnell disembarked and entrained for Tianjin and Beiping, inspecting the Marine detachments in both places before ultimately returning to Qinhuangdao to reembark in his flagship on 29 May. Proceeding thence via Yantai, &quot;Augusta&quot; reached Shanghai on 6 June; the CinCAF transferred his flag to &quot;Isabel&quot; on 23 June, and sailed for Nanjing and Wuhu, returning to Shanghai and &quot;Augusta&quot; on 27 June.

Returning to Qingdao on 3 July 1938, &quot;Augusta&quot; operated in North China waters, between Qingdao and Qinhuangdao, for the remainder of the summer and through early October. Sailing for Shanghai on 10 October, the cruiser arrived at her destination two days later, and remained there through Christmas. She sailed again for the Philippines on 27 December 1938; once again, Admiral Yarnell remained in Shanghai with his flag in &quot;Isabel&quot;.

Following her yearly navy yard overhaul, and training in Philippine waters, &quot;Augusta&quot; visited Siam, French Indochina, and Singapore en route back to Shanghai, making port at her ultimate destination on 30 April 1939. Again flying Admiral Yarnell&#x27;s flag, she lay at Shanghai until 8 June, when she got underway for Qinhuangdao. Arriving there on 10 June, she touched at Yantai (24 to 25 June) and Qingdao (26 June to 16 July) before she sailed down to Shanghai, arriving on the 18th.

On 25 July 1939 Admiral Thomas C. Hart relieved Admiral Yarnell as CinCAF. The heavy cruiser then sailed for North China port Qingdao, on 2 August. She remained based there—and was moored there on the day war broke out in Europe with the German invasion of Poland—through late September 1939. During this period, the ship twice visited Shanghai (5 to 7 September and 15 to 19 September), and also visited Qinhuangdao, Yantai, and Beidaihe. Late in September, Admiral Hart disembarked at Qinhuangdao and inspected the Marine detachments at Beiping and Tianjin.

Returning to Shanghai on 12 October, &quot;Augusta&quot; remained there through mid-November; during this time Admiral Hart shifted his flag to &quot;Isabel&quot; and proceeded up the Yangtze to Nanjing on an inspection trip (3 to 7 November 1939). Sailing for the Philippines on 21 November, she visited Amoy en route (22 to 23 November 1939), and ultimately reached Manila on 25 November, remaining there through early March 1940.

&quot;Augusta&quot; operated in the Philippines through early April, visiting Jolo and Tawi Tawi. Admiral Hart wore his flag in &quot;Isabel&quot; during March, for cruises to Cebu, Iligan, Parang, Zamboanga, and Jolo, rejoining &quot;Augusta&quot; at Jolo on 19 March. Transferring his flag back to &quot;Isabel&quot; at Tawi Tawi two days later, Admiral Hart cruised to Malampaya Sound, ultimately rejoining his flagship on 26 March at Manila. &quot;Augusta&quot; then sailed for Shanghai while Admiral Hart, who had again transferred his flag to &quot;Isabel&quot; on 13 April, visited Shantou and Amoy, ultimately rejoining &quot;Augusta&quot; and breaking his flag on board the cruiser on 22 April.

Following a month at Shanghai, &quot;Augusta&quot; sailed for North China, visiting Qinhuangdao on 12 June before beginning her cycle of training operations from Qingdao soon afterwards. &quot;Augusta&quot; operated out of Qingdao into late September. Circumstances requiring Admiral Hart on several occasions to visit Shanghai, he travelled once to Shanghai in &quot;Isabel&quot; and back in &quot;Augusta&quot;; to Shanghai in and back to Qingdao in &quot;Isabel&quot;; and one round trip to Shanghai and back in . &quot;Augusta&quot; departed Qingdao for the last time on 23 September, arriving at Shanghai on the 25th.

Moving on to Manila, arriving there on 21 October, &quot;Augusta&quot; remained there into late November, to be relieved by her recently modernized sister ship &quot;Houston&quot; as Admiral Hart&#x27;s flagship on 22 November 1940. &quot;Augusta&quot; sailed for the United States, clearing Manila Bay that same day.

On 24 November 1940, she was ordered to search the waters north of the Hawaiian chain, to investigate reports of the activity of &quot;Orange&quot; (Japanese) tankers in the vicinity. At this point on her way back from the Asiatic station, the cruiser encountered bad weather—heavy swells and fresh-to-strong cross winds—that rendered searching by her aircraft &quot;impracticable.&quot; As she neared the focal point of her search (35 degrees north latitude, 165 degrees west longitude), &quot;Augusta&quot; darkened ship and set condition III. As she passed between the two designated points on her search, she posted special lookouts from dawn to dark. Although the visibility varied between 8 and 15 miles (15 and 28 km), &quot;Augusta&quot;″s Captain John H. Magruder, Jr., estimated that his ship had swept a belt approximately 25 miles (45 km) wide, maintaining radio silence until well clear of the area searched. &quot;Weather conditions were such that fueling at sea in the area would not have been practicable&quot;, Captain Magruder reported later, alluding to the reason why his ship had been dispatched to those waters, &quot;and submarine operations at periscope depth would have been difficult due to the danger of broaching.&quot;

===Refit===
After reaching Long Beach on 10 December 1940, &quot;Augusta&quot; entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for a major refit. While &quot;Augusta&quot; had been serving as the Asiatic Fleet flagship, alterations of the type accomplished in her sister ships had been deferred until her return to the United States.

During this overhaul, the ship received significant changes in her antiaircraft battery. Four additional 5 inch (127 mm) guns were mounted atop the aircraft hangar; splinter protection was fitted for the 5 inch (127 mm) guns on the hangar and on the boat deck; interim 3 inch (76 mm) antiaircraft guns were installed (ultimate armament fit called for a one-to-one replacement of these mounts with 1.1 inch (28 mm) guns); and Mark XIX directors were installed for the 5 inch (127 mm) guns. The placement of directors and rangefinders altered her silhouette, and a pedestal was fitted atop the foremast to receive a CXAM radar antenna when it became available. &quot;Augusta&quot; was one of fourteen ships to receive the early RCA CXAM-1 radar.

===Atlantic Fleet===
Departing Mare Island on 11 April 1941, &quot;Augusta&quot;, her configuration altered and repainted, sailed for San Pedro, remaining there over 12 and 13 April. She transited the Panama Canal four days later, reporting for duty with the Atlantic Fleet on 17 April. Departing the Canal Zone on the 19th, the heavy cruiser arrived at Newport, R.I., on 23 April. Admiral Ernest J. King, now Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, returned from Washington, D.C., on 2 May and broke his flag in &quot;Augusta&quot;. The cruiser remained at Newport, serving as the administrative CINCLANT flagship (although Admiral King journeyed to Washington again during this time), through most of May, until she sailed for Bermuda on the 24th of that month. Reaching her destination on the 26th, she remained there only until the 28th, at which time she sailed for Newport once more.

&quot;Augusta&quot; remained anchored at Narragansett Bay from 30 May to 23 June, when she sailed for the New York Navy Yard. She had been chosen for special duty, the inception of which had come in the developing personal relationship between US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Prime Minister of the UK (since 1939 at war with Nazi Germany), Winston Churchill. The two leaders had sought a face-to-face meeting for some time, and Harry Hopkins (President Roosevelt&#x27;s personal representative) had visited Churchill and sounded him out on the proposal as early as February 1941. The President had also discussed the idea with Admiral King earlier that spring. Original intentions had been to hold such a conference in June, but British disasters in Greece and at the Battle of Crete had forced a postponement until later in the summer.

&quot;Augusta&quot; had been chosen to serve as the President&#x27;s flagship as early as mid-June, shortly after Admiral King had visited Roosevelt in connection with the drafting of Western Hemisphere Defense Plan No. Four. On 16 June, the New York Navy Yard commandant was informed that &quot;Augusta&quot; would soon require an availability for the installation of her CXAM radar and 1.1 inch (28 mm) antiaircraft guns, &quot;incident to possible future Presidential use and other urgent work.&quot; Details of the availability assignment, however, touched off a &quot;little war&quot; between the Bureau of Ships (BuShips) and CINCLANT. Since BuShips had no word concerning the President&#x27;s plans, they issued orders to hold &quot;Augusta&quot; at New York Navy Yard for extended repairs. On 22 June, Admiral King informed BuShips, however, that alterations to the heavy cruiser &quot;for possible use by the President were initiated by the Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, after conversations with the President&quot; and that the alteration should be limited to accomplish only &quot;essential&quot; items. &quot;Augusta&quot; remained in the yard at New York from 23 June to 2 July, after which time she resumed operations along the eastern seaboard, in waters off Hilton Head and Charleston, South Carolina (4 to 5 July), Hampton Roads (6 to 7 July) before she returned to Newport on 8 July. She remained there into August.

During that time, details for the meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill were worked out and plans set in motion to bring it to pass. While Churchill was making the Atlantic crossing in the modern battleship , the President was on his way; he departed Washington, D.C. at 1100 on 3 August for the Submarine Base at New London, Connecticut, where he embarked with his party on board the Presidential yacht , which, in company with her escort, , soon sailed for Appogansett Bay. At 2223 on 4 August &quot;Potomac&quot; anchored in Menemsha Bight, Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts, joining &quot;Augusta&quot;, which had already arrived. and five destroyers lay nearby.

At 05:30 on 5 August, &quot;Potomac&quot; came alongside &quot;Augusta&quot; and moored, the President and his party embarking in the heavy cruiser at 0617. For security purposes, the President&#x27;s flag remained in &quot;Potomac&quot; while she, accompanied by &quot;Calypso&quot;, transited the Cape Cod Canal to New England waters. A Secret Serviceman, approximating the President in size and affecting his mannerisms when visible from a distance, impersonated the President. Press releases issued daily from &quot;Potomac&quot; led all who read them to believe that &quot;FDR&quot; was embarked in his yacht on a pleasure cruise.

Meanwhile, &quot;Augusta&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and their screening destroyers, stood out of Vineyard Sound at 0640, at 20 knots (37 km/h), passing the Nantucket Shoals Lightship at 1125. Increasing speed slightly during the night, the ships steamed on, darkened. Outside a brief two-hour period the following day, 6 August, when the formation encountered heavy fog which forced them to slow to 14 knots (26 km/h), the ships maintained a 20 to 21 knot (37 to 39 km/h) pace for the rest of the voyage to NS Argentia, Newfoundland. Ultimately, on the morning of 7 August 1941, &quot;Augusta&quot; and her consorts stood into Ship Harbour, Placentia Bay, and anchored to await Churchill&#x27;s arrival.

During the forenoon, the Chief Executive indulged in one of his favorite leisure activities, fishing, from &quot;Augusta&quot;″s forecastle. Roosevelt &quot;caught a large and ugly fish which could not be identified by name and which he directed be preserved and delivered to the Smithsonian Institute [sic] upon return to Washington.&quot; At 1335, the President left the ship in a whaleboat to fish in the nearby waters, taking with him members of his party and his son, Ensign Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., USNR, an officer of on temporary duty as his father&#x27;s aide. Later, after a somewhat less than successful fishing expedition, the President inspected the waterfront and the base development at Argentia.

On 9 August, Prime Minister Churchill arrived at Argentia aboard &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, the arrival of the battleship being viewed by the President and his party; Churchill visited the President at 1100 that day, and lunched with him in his cabin. Admiral King entertained members of the respective staffs at a luncheon in his cabin. The heavy cruiser also embarked Harry Hopkins, who had come across from England on board &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. The Prime Minister later dined with the President, and ultimately left &quot;Augusta&quot; at 2345.

The following day, came alongside and embarked the President and his party, transporting them to &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; for divine services, an inspection of the battleship&#x27;s topsides, and a luncheon. President Roosevelt again entertained the Prime Minister on board &quot;Augusta&quot; that evening. On 11 and 12 August, Prime Minister Churchill and members of his staff came on board the heavy cruiser for conferences with the President and his aides; from these discussions emerged the famed &quot;Atlantic Charter.&quot; On the latter day, the final draft of the &quot;Eight Points&quot; of the charter was completed. With the meeting having been completed, President Roosevelt and his staff assembled on &quot;Augusta&quot;&#x27;s quarterdeck at 1450 on 12 August to bid Prime Minister Churchill and his staff farewell. With the ship&#x27;s guard and band paraded, the parting ended with the playing of &quot;God Save the King.&quot; A little over two hours later, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; passed close aboard and rendered passing honors, after which the band stuck up &quot;Auld Lang Syne.&quot; &quot;Augusta&quot; then got under way in company with &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and their screening destroyers, en route to Blue Hill Bay, Maine, to rendezvous with &quot;Potomac&quot; and &quot;Calypso&quot;.

The following day, a dense fog prompted the ships to reduce speed, and the President and the members of his staff rested, preparing for the transfer to the &quot;Potomac&quot;. The following morning, 14 August, off Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, President Roosevelt went on deck to witness the operations of the first aircraft escort vessel (later CVE), , the prototype of a ship type that the Chief Executive had avidly pushed toward development. &quot;Long Island&quot; launched three Brewster F2A-2 Buffalos by the catapult method and six Curtiss SOCs by conventional carrier takeoff. That afternoon on board &quot;Augusta&quot;, Admiral King hosted a farewell luncheon for the President.

&quot;Augusta&quot; anchored at Blue Hill Bay at 1228 on 14 August, and &quot;Potomac&quot; moored alongside to commence the transfer of baggage and other gear, ultimately casting off at 1418 for passage to Rockland, Maine.

&quot;Augusta&quot; returned to Narragansett Bay on 15 August, and remained there for ten days, putting into the New York Navy Yard soon afterwards. She returned to Newport on 29 August. Admiral King retained &quot;Augusta&quot; as his flagship through the autumn, while she operated between Newport and Bermuda. During this time, she also briefly embarked Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox.

===World War II===

The day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 7 December 1941, found &quot;Augusta&quot; moored at Buoy 7, Newport. From that day until the 11th, she operated out of Newport; she remained in port until 11 January 1942. During this time, on 5 January 1942. Rear Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll (one of &quot;Augusta&quot;″s former commanding officers) relieved Admiral King as Commander in Chief, United States Atlantic Fleet.

&quot;Augusta&quot; stood out of Newport on 12 January, en route to Casco Bay, Maine, via the Cape Cod Canal. She arrived the next day, and after conducting training exercises, returned to Newport. On 17 January, Rear Admiral Ingersoll shifted his flag from &quot;Augusta&quot; to &quot;Constellation&quot;.

On 19 January, &quot;Augusta&quot; got underway for Bermuda, arriving two days later and joining Task Group (TG) 2.7. She operated with this unit when it proceeded to Martinique to conduct a &quot;show offeree&quot; between 22 February and 4 March, and returned to Shelley Bay, Bermuda, on 5 March.

As part of TG 22.7—consisting of , , , , and —she stood out on 13 March to patrol the Caribbean. and joined the formation on 15 March, and the following day, &quot;Augusta&quot; was detached and, with &quot;Hambleton&quot; and &quot;Emmons&quot;, steamed to New York. While on passage, &quot;Augusta&quot; sent &quot;Hambleton&quot; to investigate a dim flashing light abaft her starboard beam during a heavy storm on 18 March. The destroyer rescued six survivors of the stricken Honduran steamer &quot;Ciepa&quot;, and rejoined &quot;Emmons&quot; and &quot;Augusta&quot; after nightfall.

&quot;Augusta&quot; made landfall at New York on 19 March, and the heavy cruiser underwent repairs and alterations until 7 April, when, along with as escort, she sailed for Newport. The next morning, &quot;Wilkes&quot; was rammed by the steamer &quot;Davilla&quot; and was forced to proceed on one engine to Boston. &quot;Augusta&quot; steamed on alone to Casco Bay, arriving on 8 April. On 14 April, in company with and , she conducted experimental firings of turret guns against a drone simulating a torpedo plane approach, and returned to Casco Bay that night.

Two days later, escorted by , she transited the Cape Cod Canal and touched at Newport. Joining Task Force (TF) 36 there, of which &quot;Ranger&quot; was flagship, the cruiser departed on 22 April for Trinidad. A minor collision between &quot;Hambleton&quot; and , and frequent submarine scares, accented the voyage. joined the task force on 28 April and fueled almost all of the ships, with &quot;Augusta&quot;″s scout planes maintaining an air patrol during the dangerous fueling evolution. &quot;Ranger&quot; launched 68 Army Curtiss P-40s on 10 May, the planes bound for Accra, on Africa&#x27;s Gold Coast, where all landed safely.

The formation arrived at Trinidad on 21 May, where &quot;Augusta&quot; fueled before putting to sea with the task force the next day bound for Newport. On 26 May, &quot;Augusta&quot; and &quot;Corry&quot; were detached and proceeded together to Hampton Roads, anchoring there on 28 May. Two days later, Rear Admiral Alexander Sharp hoisted his flag on board &quot;Augusta&quot; and assumed command of TF 22. With &quot;Corry&quot; and as escorts, the heavy cruiser sailed on 31 May for Newport, arriving on 1 June and leaving the next day with &quot;Corn&quot; for calibration of radio direction finders in waters west of Brenton Reef Lightship. &quot;Ranger&quot; joined the two ships the same day and all proceeded to Argentia, Newfoundland, arriving there on 5 June. With &quot;Ellyson&quot; and &quot;Corn&quot;, she formed an anti-submarine screen off Argentia on 17 and 18 June, and two days later joined TF 22 steaming through heavy fogs to Newport, mooring on 22 June.

&quot;Augusta&quot; sailed south to New York for overhaul, arriving on 24 June. Completing repairs by 29 June, &quot;Augusta&quot; moved to Newport the following day, and on 1 July sortied with TF 22 for the Gulf of Paria, Trinidad, and arrived on 6 July. The formation departed two days later, &quot;Ranger&quot; completing her second ferry mission with Army aircraft, launching 72 Army planes off the coast of West Africa. Another reinforcement successfully accomplished, the task force reached Trinidad on 30 July.

The heavy cruiser then proceeded to Norfolk, and moored there on 5 August for limited availability. On 18 August, she conducted short range battle practice and night spotting exercises in Chesapeake Bay, and training continued until &quot;Augusta&quot; sortied with &quot;Ranger&quot;, &quot;Corry&quot;, and on 23 August, arriving at Newport two days later and returning to Norfolk with &quot;Corry&quot; on the last day of August. The task group also carried out gunnery training, shore bombardment, and antiaircraft defense exercises off the Virginia Capes from 7 to 11 September, and further training between 28 September and 1 October in Chesapeake Bay.

On 23 October 1942, Rear Admiral H. Kent Hewitt came on board &quot;Augusta&quot; and broke his flag as Commander, TF 34. Major General George S. Patton and Rear Admiral John L. Hall, Jr. also came on board the same day for passage to North Africa. &quot;Augusta&quot; stood out on 24 October with TF 34, steaming for French Morocco and participation in Operation &quot;Torch.&quot;

===Operation Torch===

With the initial element of surprise, at 0000 GMT on 8 November 1942, &quot;Augusta&quot;, under Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, reached the shores off Casablanca and the Task Force commenced disembarking the invasion troops under the command of General Patton who, at the time, was directing the assault from &quot;Augusta&quot;. The ship&#x27;s war diary contains the following entry for that morning&#x27;s Naval Battle of Casablanca:

&quot;The landing of our boats was heavily opposed by both shore installations and French troops and at 0617 the order to &quot;Play Ball&quot; was received – this meant that we were to carry out our Attack Plan and destroy to the best of our ability all resistance encountered.&quot;

At 0700 in Casablanca Harbor, five Vichy French submarines were preparing to stand out of the harbor to go on patrol. Merchantmen were beginning to load and unload their cargos, and on board the cruisers and destroyers the crews were at work scrubbing decks.

At 0730, &quot;Ranger&quot; launched her first strike of bombers with Grumman F4F Wildcat escorts. Ten minutes later they were intercepted by French fighters, and in a dogfight five American and seven French planes were shot down.

At 0804, as &quot;Ranger&quot;″s bombers were releasing their loads, opened up with salvoes of her 16 inch guns on Casablanca&#x27;s quays and ships. In the commercial harbor ten cargo and passenger ships were sunk in 10 minutes, 40 crew killed and 60 wounded. Alongside the breakwater three Vichy submarines went down at their moorings. Coastal artillery from El Hank and Oukacha returned fire along with the battleship &quot;Jean Bart&quot;, which only had one operating turret. Wreckage hurled aboard from the quayside landed down on the turret.

At 0900, the Vichy 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron under Rear-Admiral Gervais de Lafond raised sufficient steam to put to sea to head for Fedala. As his flagship &quot;Primauguet&quot; was undergoing minor engine repair, de Lafond hoisted his flag in the destroyer &quot;Milan&quot;. He steamed northwards at full speed hoping that the smoke and rising sun would blind the American naval forces. At 0920, Wildcats from &quot;Ranger&quot; strafed her decks. Every man on bridge, including Lafond, was wounded. The Vichy &quot;Boulonnais&quot;, was severely damaged. The commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Martinant de Preneuf, was killed on &quot;Albatross&quot;. The &quot;Brestois&quot;&#x27; anti-aircraft battery was put out of action.

&quot;Primauguet&quot; was now off Fedala within range of &quot;Augusta&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; to the north and &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and &quot;Wichita&quot; from the northeast. The first Vichy ship to sink was &quot;Fougueux&quot;, which was struck by shells from &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;. &quot;Milan&quot;, with her bow shattered and forward turret wrecked, beached. &quot;Boulonnais&quot; after being hit by eight 16-inch rounds while she was carrying out a torpedo run, turned turtle, and sunk with all hands. &quot;Primauguet&quot;, holed below her water line and with half of her engine room crew dead, dropped anchor near &quot;Milan&quot;. &quot;Brestois&quot; and &quot;Frondeur&quot; got back to harbor but capsized during the night. Finally, the destroyer &quot;Alcyon&quot; left harbor for survivors but was attacked by bombers and navy guns when she cleared the Casablanca breakwater. &quot;Albatross&quot; and &quot;Primauguet&quot; were hit again while trying to transfer 100 dead and 200 wounded.

For the next three days the &quot;Augusta&quot; was engaged in protecting the transport ships and the invasion troops, and combating enemy naval and coastal resistance. On 10 November 1942 the &quot;Augusta&quot; helped turn back the French units sortieing from Casablanca who were attempting to disrupt the landings. The ship&#x27;s scout observation planes played an active role in spotting the accuracy of gun splashes from ship&#x27;s gunfire against the enemy ships and coastal batteries. The &quot;Augusta&quot; was straddled by shells from &quot;Jean Bart&quot;, which had been earlier mistakenly reported to Hewitt to have been out of commission. &quot;Jean Bart&quot; was subsequently put out of action by return ship and carrier plane bombardment.

The invasion was successful and the ship and crew had the good fortune of being able to celebrate Thanksgiving Day 1942 with a special dinner with cuisine a la North Africa. A copy of the ship&#x27;s program issued to the crew for that day is reproduced here. The message to the crew for that day summed up the feelings of all:

&quot;In its five engagements, one against a shore battery and four against enemy naval forces, the ship rendered a good account of itself and contributed in a large degree to the final defeat of the opposing forces and the establishing of a second front, in North Africa. In the course of each engagement the ship was subjected to accurate and heavy fire by the opposing forces. And yet, although bracketed many times by the projectiles of the enemy, the ship miraculously escaped without damage to herself or injury to the crew. It should be apparent to all that consistent escape from harm was due not alone to skill, or to good luck, but unquestionably to the intervention of divine providence.&quot;

===Morocco and Atlantic Duties===
Arriving off Fedhala, French Morocco, on 7 November, &quot;Augusta&quot; went into general quarters at 2200. During the predawn hours of 8 November, the initial landings met with stiff opposition. At 0630, Augusta catapulted two Curtiss SOC scouting planes aloft, and at 0710, opened fire with her 8 inch (203 mm) guns at shore batteries. The nearby supported &quot;Augusta&quot;″s barrage, dodging near misses from enemy guns. A brief lull at 0730 permitted &quot;Augusta&quot; to launch her remaining two Curtiss SOC Seagulls, but 10 minutes later the enemy guns opened up again; several near misses fell within 50 to 100 yards of &quot;Augusta&quot;, the whistle of oncoming shells plainly audible to those on her bridge.

&quot;Augusta&quot; shortly left at flank speed to intercept an enemy force of two light cruisers and four destroyers north of Casablanca. Closing the range at 0915, &quot;Augusta&quot; opened fire with her 8 inch (203 mm) battery on one enemy cruiser, barring the Vichy ships&#x27; passage and turning them back into Casablanca harbor by 0950. &quot;Augusta&quot; returned to her station to assist &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, firing on shore batteries. In the sortie of French ships from Casablanca harbor, destroyers and attempted a torpedo attack on &quot;Augusta&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn&quot;. &quot;Augusta&quot;″s main battery gunfire sank the latter, and forced the other away in a damaged condition; she sank later that day. Other Vichy ships attempting to escape were forced back into the harbor by 1122, and firing ceased for a time. Around noon, &quot;Augusta&quot; turned back ″s attempt to sortie, scoring an 8 inch (203 mm) hit on the French ship&#x27;s turret 3. Vichy ships tried to sortie at 1305, only to be blocked and forced to retreat by 1350.

&quot;Augusta&quot; spent the following day, 9 November, patrolling south and southwest of the transport area off Casablanca, and continued that patrol through 10 November. At 1135 on that day, she opened fire with her 8 inch (203 mm) guns on an enemy destroyer, straddling her and forcing her to retreat. Ten minutes later, &quot;Augusta&quot; was unexpectedly taken under fire by &quot;Jean Bart&quot;, reportedly &quot;gutted by fire&quot; and harmless. Geysers of water from near-misses erupted about &quot;Augusta&quot; and drenched the cruiser with yellow-dyed spray, but American carrier planes bombed &quot;Jean Bart&quot; later in the day and silenced her for the remainder of the campaign.

A cease-fire agreement was signed by Allied forces with the French on 11 November, bringing the operation to an end, and opening Morocco to the Allies. &quot;Augusta&quot; departed on 20 November with TF 34, her part in the operation over. She touched at Bermuda on 26 November en route to Norfolk, arriving at the latter port four days later. There, Rear Admiral H. K. Hewitt left the ship, and TF 34 was dissolved. &quot;Augusta&quot; stood out of Norfolk on 9 December for extended overhaul at New York, during which time her antiaircraft battery was significantly improved. That period of yard work completed, &quot;Augusta&quot; proceeded to Newport, anchoring there on 15 February 1943.

Refresher training took &quot;Augusta&quot; to Casco Bay two days later. She conducted air operations with her four scouting planes off the coast of Maine, and on 24 March conducted experimental fragmentation test shots, operating with &quot;Ranger&quot; on 26 to 28 March. She concluded that part of her training with night illumination exercises on 30 March and night battle practice the next day.

&quot;Augusta&quot; stood out on 2 April with TF 22, flagship &quot;Ranger&quot; joining the formation on 4 April, and arrived at Little Placentia Harbor, Argentia, on 5 April. From 13 to 18 April, the heavy cruiser operated with &quot;Ranger&quot;, carried out antiaircraft practice on 22 April, and conducted flight operations with her own planes from 30 April to 1 May.

In company with TG 21.7, &quot;Augusta&quot; sailed on 6 May, under orders to escort RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; to New York. &quot;Augusta&quot; rendezvoused with the huge liner on 9 May, and after seeing her safely into the swept channel, moored at New York on 11 May. Her mission accomplished, the heavy cruiser returned to Argentia with her task group, arriving on 17 May, and engaged in further local operations through June.

&quot;Augusta&quot; closed TF 68 on 20 July and began escorting Convoy AT 54A across the submarine-infested Atlantic to the Clyde. After an uneventful passage, the convoy arrived at Greenock, Scotland, on 26 July, and &quot;Augusta&quot; continued as escort on the return voyage, relinquishing command as the convoy neared American waters, and proceeding with to Argentia, arriving on 8 August. She left the next day with &quot;Hilary P. Jones&quot; for Halifax, Nova Scotia, to rejoin TF 22, reported for duty on 10 August, and departed on 11 August for Scapa Flow, in Orkney. The British Admiralty assumed operational control of the task force, renaming it TG 112.1, as the ships neared Scotland. &quot;Augusta&quot; moored at Scapa Flow on 19 August, reporting to the British Home Fleet the same day.

&quot;Augusta&quot; operated with units of the Home Fleet on 23 August and departed with for Hvalfjörður, Iceland, arriving the next day. She acted as covering force for training exercises with &quot;London&quot; and off Iceland from 2 to 10 October, and conducted gunnery training off Eyjafjörður, Iceland on 19 October.

While returning to Scapa Flow, &quot;Augusta&quot; fired on a passing German Junkers Ju 88 bomber at 1139 on 27 October, firing 14 rounds from her 5 inch (127 mm) battery until the plane passed out of range. She moored at Scapa Flow on 31 October, proceeding to Greenock two days later, and returned to Scapa Flow on 7 November.

On 22 November, she got underway with &quot;Ranger&quot; and other ships of the task force for Hvalfjörður, arriving two days later. Operational control passed to the United States Navy on 26 November when TF 68 stood out for Boston, &quot;Augusta&quot; mooring there on 3 December 1943. She remained there, undergoing repairs and alterations through the end of the year.

Repairs completed, &quot;Augusta&quot; departed Boston on 29 January 1944 and steamed to Casco Bay for post-overhaul training exercises. She participated in bombardment, radar, illumination, and tactical exercises with TF 22 off Maine, until steaming to Boston on 7 April for limited availability.

She left President Roads, Boston, and rendezvoused with convoy UT 11 the next day. However, she was soon detached from the convoy and escorted by across the Atlantic to Belfast, Northern Ireland. Arriving on 15 April, she steamed thence to Plymouth, England, on 17 April. There, Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk, Commander, TF 122, came on board on 25 April and broke his flag. At 1300 on 25 May, King George VI of the United Kingdom came on board to lunch with Admiral Kirk, and departed the same day.

===Normandy===
In June, &quot;Augusta&quot; took part in the Normandy invasion, standing out of Plymouth on 5 June with Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, USA, and his staff, embarked. Closing the shore on 6 June, the heavy cruiser commenced firing at 0618, hurling 51 rounds from her main battery at shore installations. VOS-7, a U.S Navy Spotter Squadron flying Supermarine Spitfire VBs and Supermarine Seafire IIIs, was one of the units which provided targeting coordinates and fire control. On 10 June General Bradley and his staff left the heavy cruiser to establish headquarters ashore. &quot;Augusta&quot; was bombed at 0357 on 11 June, but escaped damage as the bomb exploded 800 yards (730 m) off her port beam. The following day, anchored as before off Omaha Beach, she fired eight 5 inch (127 mm) rounds at an enemy plane at 2343, driving it off. On 13 June at 0352 she sent 21 rounds of 5 inch (127 mm) at a German plane, and shot it down. &quot;Augusta&quot; drove off other aircraft and bombarded the shore with her heavy guns on 15 June, and provided antiaircraft defense to the forces off Normandy on 18 June. The next day, while underway to shift berths, she lost a man overboard when he was swept overboard by heavy seas.

===Operation Dragoon===
Rear Admiral Kirk shifted his flag to on 1 July, and &quot;Augusta&quot; got underway the same day for Plymouth, mooring there on 2 July. Four days later, in company with TG 120.6, she departed for Mers el Kebir, Algeria, arriving there on 10 July, only to leave two days later with &quot;Hambleton&quot; for Palermo, Sicily. She moored at that port on 14 July and reported to TF 86 for duty. Rear Admiral Lyal A. Davidson came on board and broke his flag the same day, and &quot;Augusta&quot; stood out with &quot;Macomb&quot; and &quot;Hambleton&quot; for Naples, arriving the next day. She carried out shore bombardment exercises on 23 July.

She returned to Palermo on 27 July and steamed to Naples the following day. She continued her training until 12 August, when as flagship for TF 86, she carried Brigadier General Benjamin W. Chidlaw, USA, to Propriano, Corsica, arriving the following day.

On 14 August, the heavy cruiser departed the Golfe de Valinco at 1030 for Ile du Levant, southern France and the beginning of Operation &quot;Dragoon&quot;. &quot;Augusta&quot; arrived at 2155 at the staging area, joining the Sitka Assault Group. On the morning of 15 August, &quot;Augusta&quot; trained her main battery against targets on Port Cros Island, and fired nine rounds. At 1125, she sent six.

Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal came on board at 2023 for an official visit with Admiral Davidson.

The next day, &quot;Augusta&quot; patrolled the Sitka Assault Area and Secretary Forrestal left her at 0850. The heavy cruiser fired 63 more rounds at the fort on Port Cros Island to soften it up. On 17 August, she patrolled with and poured 138 rounds from her 8 inch (203 mm) battery into the island fort, which surrendered that day. The following day, General Chidlaw left the ship to establish his headquarters on shore, and &quot;Augusta&quot; turned her fire on the remaining coastal defense batteries. She departed on 19 August for a reconnaissance-in-force of St. Mandrier Island off Toulon, France, where the battery known as &quot;Big Willie&quot; was located, bombarding shore installations, and returning to the Sitka Assault Area the same day. The Golfe Hotel, Hyeres, France, was nearly leveled by 114 rounds from &quot;Augusta&quot; on 20 August. Toulon and Marseilles surrendered eight days later. On 29 August, a landing party drawn from the Marine detachments from &quot;Augusta&quot; and &quot;Philadelphia&quot; went ashore on the islands of Ratonneau and Chateau d&#x27;If in the harbor of Marseilles and accepted the surrender of German forces on those islands, taking 730 prisoners.

In support of &quot;Dragoon&quot;, &quot;Augusta&quot; had fired over 700 rounds of 8 inch (203 mm) projectiles, and had materially aided invading Allied forces. She steamed to the Gulf of San Tropez, France, on 30 August, where Admiral Davidson shifted his flag to , and &quot;Augusta&quot; was detached from TF 86.

===Refit and Further Service===
On 1 September, the heavy cruiser sailed via Propriano to Naples, where she joined Cruiser Division (CruDiv) 7. After calling at Oran, Algeria, on 6 September, &quot;Augusta&quot;, in company with &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;, , and , stood out, bound for Philadelphia and an extensive overhaul. While undergoing these repairs and alterations, &quot;Augusta&quot; suffered an explosion of unknown origin on 20 November in her ice machine room, which killed three-yard workers and injured four crew members.

Her overhaul completed, &quot;Augusta&quot; departed Boston on 26 January 1945 with and , bound for Trinidad, tested her guns en route, and arrived on 31 January. In the first week of February, she conducted refresher training in the Gulf of Paria, Trinidad, polishing up on gunnery, night battle, radar, and antiaircraft techniques. She steamed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, calling there on 9 February. Sailing for the United States on 21 February, &quot;Augusta&quot;, along with , , and , rendezvoused with and her screen on 24 February as that cruiser steamed back to the United States with President Roosevelt embarked, following the Yalta Conference.

After &quot;Augusta&quot; and her screen had covered the approach of the President to Hampton Roads, she underwent minor emergency repairs, remaining at Norfolk until 7 March when she steamed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, arriving there three days later. She trained off Trinidad and Curaçao until 7 April, when joined her.

&quot;Augusta&quot; returned to Norfolk on 10 April, and on 14 April, in accordance with orders from the Secretary of the Navy, half-masted her colors for a period of one month in honor of the late President Roosevelt. After a brief call at Annapolis, Maryland, she sailed north to Newport on 22 April to train 11 officers and 300 men from on a cruise. The ship conducted antiaircraft defense and other exercises in Long Island Sound until 27 April when she returned to Newport and disembarked the trainees.

Three days later, &quot;Augusta&quot; sailed for New York, and arrived there on 1 May. On 7 May, in company with , she headed for Casco Bay, where the end of the war in Europe found her, and returned to New York on 2 June. On the 13th, &quot;Augusta&quot; got underway to proceed back to Norfolk. She then conducted further training exercises in Chesapeake Bay until 7 July, when President Harry S. Truman, Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, and Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy boarded her, and she stood out for Antwerp, Belgium, to carry her distinguished passengers on the first leg of their voyage to the Potsdam Conference. Met by a British escort, &quot;Augusta&quot; arrived on 14 July, and received dignitaries, including General Eisenhower. Her guests departed the same day, and &quot;Augusta&quot; got underway to proceed to Plymouth, arriving there on 28 July.

On 2 August, she embarked her distinguished passengers again, and received another visit from King George VI. Harry Truman was on the ship when he got the news that Hiroshima had been bombed by an atomic bomb. The ship then sailed for the United States, arriving at Newport on 7 August to disembark the President. A week later she moored in Casco bay. After carrying out training at Baltimore, Maryland, she arrived at Norfolk on 11 September, and conducted exercises off the Virginia Capes until steaming to Casco Bay again on 5 October for temporary duty under the direction of Commander, Operational Training Command, Atlantic, Commander TF 69. She then proceeded to New York, and participated in Navy Day observances on 27 October at New York City, where President Truman reviewed the fleet. Open to the public from 25 to 30 October, &quot;Augusta&quot; hosted 23,362 visitors.

=== Postwar ===
On 31 October, &quot;Augusta&quot; moored at the New York Naval Shipyard, to be modified for &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; operations, bringing home American servicemen from Europe. She performed this duty through the end of the year 1945. On 16 July 1946, &quot;Augusta&quot; was ultimately placed out of commission, in reserve, in a deferred disposal status at Philadelphia. She remained in the Philadelphia group of the Reserve Fleet until stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959. She was sold for scrap on 9 November 1959 to Robert Benjamin of Panama City, Florida, and her hulk removed from naval custody on 2 March 1960.

<text>The Parson Russell Terrier is a breed of small white terrier that was the original Fox Terrier of the 18th century. The breed is named after the Reverend Jack Russell, credited with the creation of this type of dog. It is the recognised conformation show variety of the Jack Russell Terrier and was first recognised in 1990 in the United Kingdom as the Parson Jack Russell Terrier. In America, it was first recognised as the Jack Russell Terrier in 1997. The name was changed to its current form in 1999 in the UK and by 2008 all international kennel clubs recognised it under the new name.

A mostly white breed with either a smooth, rough or broken coat, it conforms to a narrower range of sizes than the Jack Russell. It is a feisty, energetic terrier, suited to sports and able to get along with children and other animals. It has a range of breed-related health issues, mainly relating to eye disorders.

==History==

:&quot;This breed shares a common history with the Jack Russell Terrier until the early 1980s.&quot;
This type of small white terrier dates back to the work of the Reverend John Russell, born in 1795. In 1819 he purchased a small white and tan terrier bitch named Trump from a milkman in the hamlet of Elmsford. She formed the basis for his breeding programme, and by the 1850s the dogs were recognised as a distinct type of Fox Terrier.

In 1894, the Devon and Somerset Badger Club was founded by Arthur Blake Heinemann who created the first breed standard for this type of terrier. The club was formed with the aim of promoting badger digging, rather than fox hunting. By the turn of the 20th century, the name of John Russell had become associated with this type of terrier. The Devon and Somerset Badger Club would go on to be renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club and continued until just before World War II when the club folded.

In 1983, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club (PJRTC) was reformed with the aim of seeking Kennel Club recognition for the breed. The initial application was turned down, but after several further rejections, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier was recognised on 9 January 1990 as a variant of the Fox Terrier, with the United Kennel Club following suit in 1991. The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Jack Russell Terrier effective 1 November 1997.

On 1 August 1999, the PJRTC successfully petitioned the Kennel Club (UK) to change the name of the breed to the Parson Russell Terrier, with the name of the breed club following suit. The international kennel association, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, recognised the Parson Russell Terrier on 4 June 2001. The American Kennel Club updated the name of the recognised breed from Jack Russell Terrier on 1 April 2003. The United Kennel Club adopted the new name on 23 April 2008.

The Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC), New Zealand Kennel Club and United Kennel Club (UKC) are the only three major kennel clubs to recognise both the Jack Russell Terrier and the Parson Russell Terrier separately. In 2009, there were 18 Parsons registered with the ANKC compared to 1073 Jack Russells.

==Description==

The Parson Russell Terrier is bred to conform to a conformation show standard. Unlike its close relative, the Jack Russell Terrier, Parson Russell Terriers have noticeably longer legs that are about as tall as the length of the Terrier&#x27;s body. It is a predominantly white breed with black, tan, mustard or tricolour markings and an easy to groom coat which can be rough, smooth or broken (similar to a smooth coat, but with some longer hair on the head, face, legs or body). The breed standard does not recognise a Parson Russell with a curly or rough coat. There is a clear outline with only a hint of eyebrows and beard should the dog be broken coated. They possess moderately thick small V-shaped drop ears with the tip pointed towards the eyes. The nose of the dog should be black. The normal range of sizes is between tall at the withers, with a weight around .

The Parson Russell has a relatively square outline, with a body about as long as the dog is tall. Compared to the Jack Russell Terrier, the Parson Russell has a longer head and a larger chest along with overall a slightly larger body size. The Parson retains the flat skull but not the elongated shape of the Fox Terrier, and with lower set ears. In addition, the Jack Russell Terrier has a greater variation in size, ranging between in height at the withers.

Two hands should be able to span the chest of the dog behind its elbows, with the thumbs at the withers. This is required in show judging, with the judge lifting the dog&#x27;s front legs gently off the ground in this motion in order to measure the size of the chest. The judges fingers should meet under the chest and the thumbs on top of the spine. The American Kennel Club describes this as a &quot;significant factor and a critical part of the judging process.&quot; It is not done to measure the size of the chest, but rather to feel for the correct shape.

Under the show standard, there are several physical points which would be treated as faults in the show ring. These are for the height of the dog at the withers to be outside of the standard range, or for the dog to possess either pricked up ears, a liver or brown coloured nose, an overshot or undershot jawline or to have brindle markings.

==Temperament==

The Parson is a feisty and energetic type of Terrier. They can excel in dog sports such as flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise in order to prevent them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.

They can be playful with other dogs, and get along with horses. The breed standard requires that shyness be treated as a fault, although it states that this should not be confused with submissiveness which is not treated as such. Overt aggression towards another dog is not accepted and is a criterion for disqualification in the show ring.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.8 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

The Parson Russell Terrier is one of the more commonly affected breeds for primary lens luxation which is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation of the ADAMTS17 gene.

Other eye conditions which appear in the breed include cataracts in juveniles, corneal dystrophy, progressive retinal atrophy and posterior vitreous detachment. Non-eye breed related conditions which may affect a Parson are deafness and patella luxation.

An inherited form of ataxia has been recognised within the group of Russell terriers (Jack Russell Terrier, Parson Russell Terrier, and Russell Terrier) for more than 50 years. Myokymia and seizures are often seen alongside the condition. A 2014 study identified the KCNJ10 gene as being responsible for the spinocerebellar ataxia accompanied by myokymia and/or seizures in the breed. This condition also affects the closely related Jack Russell Terrier and Russell Terrier.

== In popular culture ==

* Uggie (2002–2015), a trained Parson Russell Terrier, was an animal actor, appearing in commercials starting in 2005 and most notably cast in &quot;Water for Elephants&quot; and &quot;The Artist&quot;, both in 2011. In the same year, based on interest following &quot;The Artist&quot;, the &quot;Consider Uggie&quot; campaign was launched, which attempted to gain the dog a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2012, Uggie was named Nintendo&#x27;s first-ever spokesdog.
* Sykes (est. 2001–2019), a dog actor from Clifton, Oxfordshire, England, who appeared as &quot;Harvey&quot; in Thinbox&#x27;s three televisions commercials and, under his real name, in five seasons of Midsomer Murders. He also appeared in several Hollywood blockbusters, as well as a UK TV movie, several series and miniseries. He retired in 2016 after a long career on the big and small screen. Sykes was also a champion agility competitor.

<doc id="515556" wikidata="Q7381819" url="?curid=515556" title="Russell Terrier">
<text>The Russell Terrier is a predominantly white working terrier with an instinct to hunt prey underground. The breed was derived from Jack Russell&#x27;s working terrier strains that were used in the 19th century for fox hunting. Russell&#x27;s fox working strains were much smaller than the Show Fox Terrier and remained working terriers. The size of the Russell Terrier (10&quot; to 12&quot;) combined with a small flexible, spannable chest makes it an ideal size to work efficiently underground. Their unique rectangular body shape with the body being of slightly longer length than the leg makes them distinctly different from the Parson Russell Terrier and the Jack Russell Terrier of the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America (JRTCA).

The Russell Terrier originated in England, but the country of development was Australia.

==History==
The name &quot;Jack Russell Terrier&quot; was never used to describe a breed of dog. Rather, it became a common name for any predominantly-white earth-working terrier after the death of the clergyman Jack Russell. The only requisite was color, the instinct combined with the will to employ earth-work, and the size to work efficiently underground. Still today, the name is widely used for working terriers of the Parsons Reverend&#x27;s style. It was in the country of development, Australia, that this 10-12 inch dog was first standardized by Kennel Club recognition with the official name &quot;Jack Russell Terrier&quot; applied to the breed. This ultimately led to recognition of the breed by FCI (Fédération Cynologique Internationale) countries, including Ireland and most recently, the US. Unfortunately, due to the previous use of the name in the US and England, the name Jack Russell Terrier is conflicting. In the US, a terrier conforming to the Australian/FCI standard is simply called a Russell Terrier.

The Russell Terrier is a very popular companion breed in the US. The breed is a working breed, not a companion breed. They are bred by dedicated fanciers to preserve their working functional conformation and the instinct to employ their original purpose as earth terriers. This makes them an excellent performance breed participating in a variety of events: natural hunting which includes earthwork, agility, rally, obedience, tracking, go-to-ground, and conformation, etc. They are also therapy and service dogs.

=== Breed development in England and Australia ===
In the early 1970s, the Jack Russell Terrier Club of Great Britain was formed, and this body instituted a very primitive form of registration. Soon, Jack Russell Terrier Clubs were being formed worldwide, including Australia. The Jack Russell Terrier Club of Australia was formed in 1972. This national organization set up a particularly comprehensive registration system, along with a formal breed standard. This club also initiated discussions with their KC regarding the possibility of the breed being accepted for registration as a pure breed. 

=== The Russell Terrier in the US ===
The Russell Terrier, also known as the FCI type Jack Russell Terrier, is a recognized Kennel Club breed and is maintained separately from the AKC Parson Russell Terrier and the UKC Parson Russell Terrier. In 2001, the United Kennel Club accepted the application from the English Jack Russell Terrier Club to give dogs in their registry the official &quot;FS&quot; designation. UKC officially recognized the breed as the Russell Terrier because the name Jack Russell Terrier was already in use for the longer legged dog in 2001. The UKC breed standard was changed in 2005 from the original standard of 2001. In 2009 the UKC changed the name to Jack Russell to go back to their original standard and align themselves with the rest of the world. The American Kennel Club AKC accepted the breed into the FSS Program on December 8, 2004 based on the FCI Jack Russell standard also submitted by the EJRTC, aka the American Russell Terrier Club. The American Rare Breed Association recognized the &quot;Russell Terrier&quot; in 2003, with the old UKC standard originally written by the UKC. This standard was based on the same standard written by Australia and used also in Ireland. The original ARBA standard was then changed by the NRTFC to a new standard in November 2008, than again on January 1, 2010. The AKC parent club for the Russell Terrier changed the FCI breed standard in 2010 and introduced their own standard which is now different from the rest of the world and FCI. The NRTFC was the first and is the only organization in the world and history of the breed to recognize only the smooth coated dog.
However, after 15 years of maintaining the Russell Terrier in the US and longer internationally as a distinctly separate breed, due to the rectangular appearance unique only to the Jack Russell/Russell Terrier, they can no longer be considered variations.

==Health==
An inherited form of ataxia has been recognised within the group of Russell terriers (Jack Russell Terrier, Parson Russell Terrier, and Russell Terrier) for more than 50 years. Myokymia and seizures are often seen alongside the condition. A 2014 study identified the KCNJ10 gene as being responsible for the spinocerebellar ataxia accompanied by myokymia and/or seizures in the breed. This condition also affects the closely related Parson Russell Terrier and Jack Russell Terrier.

<doc id="515568" wikidata="Q1254921" url="?curid=515568" title="Dragonnades">
<text>The Dragonnades was a policy implemented by Louis XIV in 1681 to force French Protestants known as Huguenots to convert to Catholicism. It involved the billeting of dragoons of the French Royal Army in Huguenot households, with the soldiers being given implied permission to mistreat the inhabitants and damage or steal their possessions. Soldiers employed as part of this policy were derisively referred to as &quot;missionary dragoons&quot;.

==Background==

With the Edict of Nantes in 1598, Henry IV of France ended the French Wars of Religion by granting a relatively high degree of toleration to French Protestants (known as Huguenots) as well as political and military privileges. The latter were abolished in 1629 under the Peace of Alès following the Huguenot rebellions, but the provisions of the Edict of Nantes granting religious tolerance were largely maintained under the governments of Cardinal Richelieu and Cardinal Mazarin.

Louis XIV, however, aimed to have religious uniformity in his kingdom. Initially he offered the Huguenots financial incentives to convert, but this had limited effect. By the late 1670s he decided upon a harsher policy. He began to order the destruction of Huguenot churches and the closure of Huguenot schools.

==Implementation==
Louis XIV combined legal persecution with a policy of terrorizing recalcitrant Huguenots who refused to convert to Catholicism by billeting both dragoons and ordinary infantrymen in their homes. The soldiers were instructed to harass and intimidate the occupants, in order to persuade them to either convert to the state religion or emigrate. As mobile mounted infantry, the 14 regiments of dragoons in the French Army of the period were sometimes used for what would now be called internal security duties, and were an effective instrument for persecuting the Huguenots.

The application of selective and coercive troop quartering had been initiated by the &quot;intendant&quot; René de Marillac in Poitou, in 1681. With the permission of the Secretary of State for War François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, Marillac systematically lodged troops with Protestants, in the expectation that existing laws exempting households newly converted to Catholicism from this practice would spur conversions. Billeted troops got so far out of hand that, after a series of reprimands in letters, the Marquis de Louvois was forced to recall Marillac from Poitou. The Marquis himself was to be subsequently blamed for originating the dragonnades but research has established that responsibility rested with more junior officials such as de Marillac, ambitious for royal favour. Louvois did not oppose the policy but was concerned with the negative impact on the discipline of the soldiers involved.

==Outcome==
The persecution of Protestants caused outrage in England and created a wave of literature in protest against the inhumane treatment of Huguenots, thousands of whom fled to England to seek asylum. The &quot;dragonnades&quot; caused Protestants to flee France, even before the Edict of Fontainebleau of 1685 revoked the religious rights granted them by the Edict of Nantes. Most Huguenot refugees sought refuge in countries such as Switzerland, the Dutch Republic (from where some migrated to the Cape Colony in southern Africa), England, and the German territories (notably Brandenburg-Prussia). Smaller numbers also fled to New France, the British colonies in North America, or Lutheran Scandinavia. Huguenots also fled to Brazil, where they founded the city of Saint-Louis-de-Maragnan (present-day São Luís, in the state of Maranhão), which is the only Brazilian capital founded by the French. Today among the remnants of the French Huguenot colonization of the city, there is a museum dedicated to the Huguenots, and the place where the Huguenots built a fort has become the city hall, but retains its original name of &quot;La Ravardière&quot;.

On 17 January 1686, Louis XIV claimed that his policies had caused the Protestant population of France to decline from 800,000–900,000 to 1,000–1,500. Though he greatly exaggerated, their numbers did decline significantly. According to Hans J. Hillerbrand, an expert on Protestantism, Huguenot numbers had been steadily declining since the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre in 1572. The campaign ultimately proved detrimental to France&#x27;s economy, as many were part of the nascent urban bourgeoisie and many others possessed skills such as silkweaving, clock-making, silversmithing, and optometry.

I think it&#x27;s tougher than expected.&quot;

According to a September 2006 profile of Wang in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, he was considered the top contender for the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs in Beijing in 2007.

In October 2010 he became the second post-handover director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. There have only been two directors for the affairs office. Wang spends most of his time in Beijing. Though he did make a three-day visit to HK in 2011 to address the Home Ownership Scheme issue. His working style is very different compared to the previous director Liao Hui who kept silent from public and worked in mystery the 13 years he was in charge of HK.

==Controversy==

===One country two systems comment===
Zhao Lianhai was a worker who defended the victims of the 2008 Chinese milk scandal. On 29 December 2010 Wang Guangya said that because of the One country, two systems Hong Kong should not interfere with the issue. He then made the controversial statement, &quot;well water should not mix with river water&quot; (). Pro-Beijing member Ip Kwok-him then tried to defend the director by saying that Hong Kong citizens were only concerned about mainland affairs, and that they do care about One country two systems as well as the mainland justice system. Chief Secretary for Administration Henry Tang was asked to interpret what the water-river statement meant. He only smiled and did not answer. The phrase was first used by former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin in December 1989 when he met the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He previously said &quot;Well water should not mix with river water, river water should not mix with well water.&quot;

<text>The Virunga Mountains (also known as Mufumbiro) are a chain of volcanoes in East Africa, in the area where Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Uganda meet. The mountain range is a branch of the Albertine Rift Mountains, which border the western branch of the East African Rift. They are located between Lake Edward and Lake Kivu. The name &quot;Virunga&quot; is an English version of the Kinyarwanda word &quot;ibirunga&quot;, which means &quot;volcanoes&quot;.

The mountain range consists of eight major volcanoes. Most of them are dormant, except Mount Nyiragongo and Mount Nyamuragira , both in the DRC. Recent eruptions occurred in 2006, 2010 and May 2021. Mount Karisimbi is the highest volcano at . The oldest mountain is Mount Sabyinyo, which rises above sea level.

The Virunga Mountains are home of the endangered mountain gorilla, listed on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species due to habitat loss, poaching, disease, and war (Butynski et al. 2003). The Karisoke Research Center, founded by Dian Fossey to observe gorillas in their native habitat, is located between Mount Karisimbi and Mount Bisoke.

<doc id="515580" wikidata="Q852957" url="?curid=515580" title="Ethnomethodology">
<text>Ethnomethodology is the study of how social order is produced in and through processes of social interaction. It generally seeks to provide an alternative to mainstream sociological approaches. In its most radical form, it poses a challenge to the social sciences as a whole. Its early investigations led to the founding of conversation analysis, which has found its own place as an accepted discipline within the academy. According to Psathas, it is possible to distinguish five major approaches within the ethnomethodological family of disciplines (see ).

Ethnomethodology is a fundamentally descriptive discipline which does not engage in the explanation or evaluation of the particular social order undertaken as a topic of study., &quot;to discover the things that persons in particular situations do, the methods they use, to create the patterned orderliness of social life&quot;. However, applications have been found within many applied disciplines, such as software design and management studies.

==Definition==
The term&#x27;s meaning can be broken down into its three constituent parts: &quot;ethno&quot; – &quot;method&quot; – &quot;ology&quot;, for the purpose of explanation. Using an appropriate Southern California example: &quot;ethno&quot; refers to a particular socio-cultural group (for example, a particular, local community of surfers); &quot;method&quot; refers to the methods and practices this particular group employs in its everyday activities (for example, related to surfing); and &quot;ology&quot; refers to the systematic description of these methods and practices. The focus of the investigation used in our example is the social order of surfing, the ethnomethodological interest is in the &quot;how&quot; (the methods and practices) of the production and maintenance of this social order. In essence ethnomethodology attempts to create classifications of the social actions of individuals within groups through drawing on the experience of the groups directly, without imposing on the setting the opinions of the researcher with regards to social order, as is the case with other forms of sociological investigation.

==Origin and scope==
The approach was originally developed by Harold Garfinkel, who attributed its origin to his work investigating the conduct of jury members in 1954. His interest was in describing the common sense methods through which members of a jury produce themselves in a jury room &quot;as a jury&quot;. Thus, their methods for: establishing matters of fact; developing evidence chains; determining the reliability of witness testimony; establishing the organization of speakers in the jury room itself; and determining the guilt or innocence of defendants, etc. are all topics of interest. Such methods serve to constitute the social order of being a juror for the members of the jury, as well as for researchers and other interested parties, in that specific social setting.

This interest developed out of Garfinkel&#x27;s critique of Talcott Parsons&#x27; attempt to derive a general theory of society. This critique originated in his reading of Alfred Schutz, though Garfinkel ultimately revised many of Schutz&#x27;s ideas. Garfinkel also drew on his study of the principles and practices of financial accounting; the classic sociological theory and methods of Durkheim and Weber; and the traditional sociological concern with the Hobbesian &quot;problem of order&quot;.

For the ethnomethodologist, participants produce the order of social settings through their shared sense making practices. Thus, there is an essential natural reflexivity between the activity of making sense of a social setting and the ongoing production of that setting; the two are in effect identical. Furthermore, these practices (or methods) are witnessably enacted, making them available for study. This opens up a broad and multi-faceted area of inquiry. John Heritage writes: &quot;In its open-ended reference to [the study of] any kind of sense-making procedure, the term represents a signpost to a domain of uncharted dimensions rather than a staking out of a clearly delineated territory.&quot;

==Theory and methods==

Ethnomethodology has often perplexed commentators, due to its radical approach to questions of theory and method. With regard to theory, Garfinkel has consistently advocated an attitude of ethnomethodological indifference, a principled agnosticism with regard to social theory which insists that the shared understandings of members of a social setting under study take precedence over any concepts which a social theorist might bring to the analysis from outside that setting. This can be perplexing to traditional social scientists, trained in the need for social theory. A multiplicity of theoretical references by Anne Rawls, in her introduction to &quot;Ethnomethodology&#x27;s Program&quot;, might be interpreted to suggest a softening of this position towards the end of Garfinkel&#x27;s life. However, the position is consistent with ethnomethodology&#x27;s understanding of the significance of &quot;member&#x27;s methods&quot;, and with certain lines of philosophical thought regarding the philosophy of science (Polanyi 1958; Kuhn 1970; Feyerabend 1975), and the study of the actual practices of scientific procedure. It also has a strong correspondence with the later philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, especially as applied to social studies by Peter Winch.

References are also made in Garfinkel&#x27;s work to Husserl (Transcendental Phenomenology), Gurwitsch (Gestalt Theory), and, most frequently, of course, to the works of the social phenomenologist Alfred Schutz (Phenomenology of the Natural Attitude), among others. On the other hand, the authors and theoretical references cited by Garfinkel do not constitute a rigorous theoretical basis for ethnomethodology. Ethnomethodology is not Durkheimian, although it shares some of the interests of Durkheim; it is not phenomenology, although it borrows from Husserl and Schutz&#x27;s studies of the lifeworld (&quot;Lebenswelt&quot;); it is not a form of Gestalt theory, although it describes social orders as having Gestalt-like properties; and, it is not Wittgensteinian, although it makes use of Wittgenstein&#x27;s understanding of rule-use, etc. Instead, these borrowings are only fragmentary references to theoretical works from which ethnomethodology has appropriated theoretical ideas for the expressed purposes of &quot;doing&quot; ethnomethodological investigations.

Similarly, ethnomethodology advocates no formal methods of enquiry, insisting that the research method be dictated by the nature of the phenomenon that is being studied. Ethnomethodologists have conducted their studies in a variety of ways, and the point of these investigations is &quot;to discover the things that persons in particular situations &quot;do&quot;, the methods &quot;they&quot; use, to create the patterned orderliness of social life&quot;. Michael Lynch has noted that: &quot;Leading figures in the field have repeatedly emphasised that there is no obligatory set of methods [employed by ethnomethodologists], and no prohibition against using any research procedure whatsoever, if it is &quot;adequate&quot; to the particular phenomena under study&quot;.

==Some leading policies, methods and definitions==

; The fundamental assumption of ethnomethodological studies: As characterised by Anne Rawls, speaking for Garfinkel: &quot;If one assumes, as Garfinkel does, that the meaningful, patterned, and orderly character of everyday life is something that people must work to achieve, then one must also assume that they have some methods for doing so&quot;. That is, &quot;...members of society must have some shared methods that they use to mutually construct the meaningful orderliness of social situations.&quot;
; Ethnomethodology is an empirical enterprise : Rawls states: &quot;Ethnomethodology is a thoroughly empirical enterprise devoted to the discovery of social order and intelligibility [sense making] as witnessable collective achievements.&quot; &quot;The keystone of the [ethnomethodological] argument is that local [social] orders exist; that these orders are witnessable in the scenes in which they are produced; and that the possibility of [their] intelligibility is based on the actual existence and detailed enactment of these orders.&quot; Ethnomethodology is not, however, conventionally empiricist. Its empirical nature is specified in the weak form of the &quot;unique adequacy requirement&quot;.
; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (weak form) : is that the researcher should have a &#x27;vulgar competence&#x27; in the research setting. That is, they should be able to function as an ordinary member of that setting.
; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (strong form) : is identical to the requirement for ethnomethodological indifference.
; Ethnomethodological indifference : This is the policy of deliberate agnosticism, or indifference, towards the dictates, prejudices, methods and practices of sociological analysis as traditionally conceived (examples: theories of &quot;deviance&quot;, analysis of behavior as rule governed, role theory, institutional (de)formations, theories of social stratification, etc.). Dictates and prejudices which serve to pre-structure traditional social scientific investigations independently of the subject matter taken as a topic of study, or the investigatory setting being subjected to scrutiny. The policy of ethnomethodological indifference is specifically not to be conceived of as indifference to the problem of social order taken as a group (member&#x27;s) concern.
; First time through : This is the practice of attempting to describe any social activity, regardless of its routine or mundane appearance, as if it were happening for the very first time. This is in an effort to expose how the observer of the activity assembles, or constitutes, the activity for the purposes of formulating any particular description. The point of such an exercise is to make available and underline the complexities of sociological analysis and description, particularly the indexical and reflexive properties of the actors&#x27;, or observer&#x27;s, own descriptions of what is taking place in any given situation. Such an activity will also reveal the observer&#x27;s inescapable reliance on the hermeneutic circle as the defining &quot;methodology&quot; of social understanding for both lay persons and social scientists.
; Breaching experiment : A method for revealing, or exposing, the common work that is performed by members of particular social groups in maintaining a clearly recognisable and shared social order. For example, driving the wrong way down a busy one-way street can reveal myriads of useful insights into the patterned social practices, and moral order, of the community of road users. The point of such an exercisea person pretending to be a stranger or boarder in their own householdis to demonstrate that gaining insight into the work involved in maintaining any given social order can often best be revealed by breaching that social order and observing the results of that breachespecially those activities related to the reassembly of that social order, and the normalisation of that social setting.
; Sacks&#x27; gloss : A question about an aspect of the social order that recommends, as a method of answering it, that the researcher should seek out members of society who, in their daily lives, are responsible for the maintenance of that aspect of the social order. This is in opposition to the idea that such questions are best answered by a sociologist. Sacks&#x27; original question concerned objects in public places and how it was possible to see that such objects did or did not belong to somebody. He found his answer in the activities of police officers who had to decide whether cars were abandoned.
; Durkheim&#x27;s aphorism : Durkheim famously recommended: &quot;our basic principle, that of the objectivity of social facts&quot;. This is usually taken to mean that we should assume the objectivity of social facts as a principle of study (thus providing the basis of sociology as a science). Garfinkel&#x27;s alternative reading of Durkheim is that we should treat the objectivity of social facts as an achievement of society&#x27;s members, and make the achievement process itself the focus of study. An ethnomethodological respecification of Durkheim&#x27;s statement via a &quot;misreading&quot; (see below) of his quote appears above. There is also a textual link/rationale provided in the literature. Both links involve a leap of faith on the part of the reader; that is, we don&#x27;t believe that one method for this interpretation is necessarily better than the other, or that one form of justification for such an interpretation outweighs its competitor.
; Accounts : Accounts are the ways members signify, describe or explain the properties of a specific social situation. They can consist of both verbal and non-verbal objectifications. They are always both indexical to the situation in which they occur (see below), and, simultaneously reflexivethey serve to constitute that situation. An account can consist of something as simple as a wink of the eye, a material object evidencing a state of affairs (documents, etc.), or something as complex as a story detailing the boundaries of the universe.
; Indexicality : The concept of indexicality is a key core concept for ethnomethodology. Garfinkel states that it was derived from the concept of indexical expressions appearing in ordinary language philosophy (1967), wherein a statement is considered to be indexical insofar as it is dependent for its sense upon the context in which it is embedded (Bar-Hillel 1954:359–379). The phenomenon is acknowledged in various forms of analytical philosophy, and sociological theory and methods, but is considered to be both limited in scope and remedied through specification operationalisation. In ethnomethodology, the phenomenon is universalised to all forms of language and behavior, and is deemed to be beyond remedy for the purposes of establishing a scientific description and explanation of social behavior. The consequence of the degree of contextual dependence for a &quot;segment&quot; of talk or behavior can range from the problem of establishing a &quot;working consensus&quot; regarding the description of a phrase, concept or behavior, to the end-game of social scientific description itself. Note that any serious development of the concept must eventually assume a theory of meaning as its foundation (see Gurwitsch 1985). Without such a foundational underpinning, both the traditional social scientist and the ethnomethodologist are relegated to merely telling stories around the campfire (Brooks 1974).
; Misreading (a text) : Misreading a text, or fragments of a text, does not denote making an erroneous reading of a text in whole or in part. As Garfinkel states, it means to denote an &quot;alternate reading&quot; of a text or fragment of a text. As such, the original and its misreading do not &quot;translate point to point&quot; but, &quot;instead, they go together&quot;. No criteria are offered for the translation of an original text and its misreadingthe outcome of such translations are in Garfinkel&#x27;s term: &quot;incommensurable.&quot; The misreading of texts or fragments of texts is a standard feature of ethnomethodology&#x27;s way of doing theory, especially in regards to topics in phenomenology.
; Reflexivity : Despite the fact that many sociologists use &quot;reflexivity&quot; as a synonym for &quot;self-reflection,&quot; the way the term is used in ethnomethodology is different: it is meant &quot;to describe the acausal and non-mentalistic determination of meaningful action-in-context&quot;. See also: Reflexivity (social theory).
; Documentary method of interpretation : The documentary method is the method of understanding utilised by everyone engaged in trying to make sense of their social world—this includes the ethnomethodologist. Garfinkel recovered the concept from the work of Karl Mannheim and repeatedly demonstrates the use of the method in the case studies appearing in his central text, &quot;Studies in Ethnomethodology&quot;. Mannheim defined the term as a search for an identical homologous pattern of meaning underlying a variety of totally different realisations of that meaning. Garfinkel states that the documentary method of interpretation consists of treating an actual appearance as the &quot;document of&quot;, &quot;as pointing to&quot;, as &quot;standing on behalf of&quot;, a presupposed underlying pattern. These &quot;documents&quot; serve to constitute the underlying pattern, but are themselves interpreted on the basis of what is already known about that underlying pattern. This seeming paradox is quite familiar to hermeneuticians who understand this phenomenon as a version of the hermeneutic circle. This phenomenon is also subject to analysis from the perspective of Gestalt theory (part/whole relationships), and the phenomenological theory of perception.
; Social orders : Theoretically speaking, the object of ethnomethodological research is social order taken as a group member&#x27;s concern. Methodologically, social order is made available for description in any specific social setting as an accounting of specific social orders: the sensible coherencies of accounts that order a specific social setting for the participants relative to a specific social project to be realised in that setting. Social orders themselves are made available for both participants and researchers through phenomena of order: the actual accounting of the partial (adumbrated) appearances of these sensibly coherent social orders. These appearances (parts, adumbrates) of social orders are embodied in specific accounts, and employed in a particular social setting by the members of the particular group of individuals party to that setting. Specific social orders have the same formal properties as identified by A. Gurwitsch in his discussion of the constituent features of perceptual &quot;noema&quot;, and, by extension, the same relationships of meaning described in his account of Gestalt Contextures (see Gurwitsch 1964:228–279). As such, it is little wonder that Garfinkel states: &quot;you can&#x27;t do anything unless you do read his texts&quot;.
; Ethnomethodology&#x27;s field of investigation : For ethnomethodology the topic of study is the social practices of real people in real settings, and the methods by which these people produce and maintain a shared sense of social order.

==Differences with sociology ==

Since ethnomethodology has become anathema to certain sociologists, and since those practicing it like to perceive their own efforts as constituting a radical break from prior sociologies, there has been little attempt to link ethnomethodology to these prior sociologies. However, whilst ethnomethodology is distinct from sociological methods, it does not seek to compete with it, or provide remedies for any of its practices. The ethnomethodological approach differs as much from the sociological approach as sociology does from psychology even though both speak of social action. This does not mean that ethnomethodology does not use traditional sociological forms as a sounding board for its own programmatic development, or to establish benchmarks for the differences between traditional sociological forms of study and ethnomethodology as it only means that ethnomethodology was not established in order to: repair, criticize, undermine, or poke fun at traditional sociological forms. In essence the distinctive difference between sociological approaches and ethnomethodology is that the latter adopts a commonsense attitude towards knowledge.

In contrast to traditional sociological forms of inquiry, it is a hallmark of the ethnomethodological perspective that it does not make theoretical or methodological appeals to: outside assumptions regarding the structure of an actor or actors&#x27; characterisation of social reality; refer to the subjective states of an individual or groups of individuals; attribute conceptual projections such as, &quot;value states&quot;, &quot;sentiments&quot;, &quot;goal orientations&quot;, &quot;mini-max economic theories of behavior&quot;, etc., to any actor or group of actors; or posit a specific &quot;normative order&quot; as a transcendental feature of social scenes, etc.

For the ethnomethodologist, the methodic realisation of social scenes takes place within the actual setting under scrutiny, and is structured by the participants in that setting through the reflexive accounting of that setting&#x27;s features. The job of the ethnomethodologist is to describe the methodic character of these activities, not account for them in a way that transcends that which is made available in and through the actual accounting practices of the individual&#x27;s party to those settings.

The differences can therefore be summed up as follows:

# While traditional sociology usually offers an analysis of society which takes the facticity (factual character, objectivity) of the social order for granted, ethnomethodology is concerned with the procedures (practices, methods) by which that social order is produced, and shared.
# While traditional sociology usually provides descriptions of social settings which compete with the actual descriptions offered by the individuals who are party to those settings, ethnomethodology seeks to describe the procedures (practices, methods) these individuals use in their actual descriptions of those settings.

== Varieties ==
According to George Psathas, five types of ethnomethodological study can be identified (Psathas 1995:139–155). These may be characterised as:

# &quot;The organisation of practical actions and practical reasoning&quot;. Including the earliest studies, such as those in Garfinkel&#x27;s seminal &quot;Studies in Ethnomethodology&quot;.
# &quot;The organisation of talk-in-interaction&quot;. More recently known as conversation analysis, Harvey Sacks established this approach in collaboration with his colleagues Emanuel Schegloff and Gail Jefferson.
# &quot;Talk-in-interaction within institutional or organisational settings&quot;. While early studies focused on talk abstracted from the context in which it was produced (usually using tape recordings of telephone conversations) this approach seeks to identify interactional structures that are specific to particular settings.
# &quot;The study of work&quot;. &#x27;Work&#x27; is used here to refer to any social activity. The analytic interest is in how that work is accomplished within the setting in which it is performed.
# &quot;The haecceity of work&quot;. Just what makes an activity what it is? e.g. what makes a test a test, a competition a competition, or a definition a definition?

Further discussion of the varieties and diversity of ethnomethodological investigations can be found in Maynard &amp; Clayman&#x27;s work.

==Relationship with conversation analysis==
The relationship between ethnomethodology and conversation analysis has been contentious at times, given their overlapping interests, the close collaboration between their founders and the subsequent divergence of interest among many practitioners. In as much as the study of social orders is &quot;inexorably intertwined&quot; with the constitutive features of talk about those social orders, ethnomethodology is committed to an interest in both conversational talk, and the role this talk plays in the constitution of that order. Talk is seen as indexical and embedded in a specific social order. It is also naturally reflexive to and constitutive of that order. Anne Rawls pointed out: &quot;Many, in fact most, of those who have developed a serious interest in ethnomethodology have also used conversation analysis, developed by Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson, as one of their research tools.&quot;

On the other hand, where the study of conversational talk is divorced from its situated context—that is, when it takes on the character of a purely technical method and &quot;formal analytic&quot; enterprise in its own right—it is not a form of ethnomethodology. The &quot;danger&quot; of misunderstanding here, as Rawls notes, is that conversation analysis can become just another formal analytic enterprise, like any other formal method which brings an analytical toolbox of preconceptions, formal definitions, and operational procedures to the situation/setting under study. When such analytical concepts are generated from within one setting and conceptually applied (generalised) to another, the (re)application represents a violation of the strong form of the &quot;unique adequacy requirement&quot; of methods.

== Links with phenomenology ==
Even though ethnomethodology has been characterised as having a &quot;phenomenological sensibility&quot;, and reliable commentators have acknowledged that &quot;there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology&quot; (Maynard and Kardash 2007:1484), some orthodox adherents to the disciplinethose who follow the teachings of Garfinkeldo not explicitly represent it as a form of phenomenology.

Garfinkel speaks of phenomenological texts and findings as being &quot;appropriated&quot; for the purposes of exploring topics in the study of social order. Even though ethnomethodology is not a form of phenomenology, the reading and understanding of phenomenological texts, and developing the capability of seeing phenomenologically is essential to the praxis of ethnomethodological studies. As Garfinkel states in regard to the work of the phenomenologist Aron Gurwitsch, especially his &quot;Field of Consciousness&quot; (1964: ethnomethodology&#x27;s phenomenological &quot;urtext&quot;): &quot;you can&#x27;t do anything unless you do read his texts&quot;.

<text>Nyamuragira, also known as Nyamulagira, is an active shield volcano in the Virunga Mountains of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, situated about north of Lake Kivu. The name is derived from the Kinyarwanda Bantu verb &quot;Kuragira nyamu&quot;, meaning to &quot;herd animals&quot;; &quot;nyamu&quot; means &quot;animal&quot; or &quot;cows&quot;.

It has been described as Africa&#x27;s most active volcano and has erupted over 40 times since 1885. As well as eruptions from the summit, there have been numerous eruptions from the flanks of the volcano, creating new smaller volcanoes that have lasted only for a short time (e.g. Murara from late 1976 to 1977).

Recent eruptions occurred on 2 January 2010, 8 November 2011 and 23 May 2021.

==Geography and geology==
Nyamuragira volcano is an active volcano near the city of Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, situated about north of Lake Kivu. It is in the Nord-Kivu Province. It is north-north-west of Nyiragongo, the volcano which caused extensive damage to the city of Goma in its 2002 eruption.

Nyamuragira has a volume of , and covers an area of . It has a low shield profile and contrasts with adjacent steep-sided Nyiragongo volcano.
Nyamuragira volcano is responsible for a large portion of the sulfur dioxide released into the atmosphere by volcanoes.
==Recent activity==

===2010 eruption===
At dawn on 2 January 2010 Nyamuragira began spewing out lava flows. There are no settlements close to the volcano, but wildlife officials feared that the eruption may threaten the chimpanzees in the area. Another danger was that the lava could have flowed into the southern sector of Virunga National Park, where there are settlements and villages.

Extensive lava flows from the 2010 eruption can be seen on satellite photographs reaching south-west to Lake Kivu, about north-west and north-north-east.

===2011 eruption===
The volcano erupted again on 5 November 2011.

That eruption produced a high column of lava, and it is said to have been its largest eruption in 100 years.

===2014 lava lake===

In 2014, a new lava lake appeared at the volcano for the first time in 75 years. The previous lava lake at the volcano was emptied in the 1938 lava flow. The formation of the new lake occurred between June and August 2014. It reached a depth of . The eruption did not affect the communities in the area but left a lot of ash and air pollution. Sulfate aerosols formed by volcanic sulfur dioxide from the eruptions were observed as far away as over the central Amazon rain forest in South America. By 2018, the lava lake had hardened and the activity appeared to have stopped. Eruptive activity continues during 2021 at the summit caldera.
===2021 lava lake===
In 2021, a lava lake appeared at the volcano based on a June 11 satellite image.

===2024 caldera overflow===
On July 26, 2024, lava began to overflow the northern caldera rim and flowed towards the northwest. This was accompanied by a large increase in effusive lava output. The flow advanced 5km in the first day.

<doc id="515587" wikidata="Q1173072" url="?curid=515587" title="Island Davaar">
<text>Island Davaar or Davaar Island () is located at the mouth of Campbeltown Loch off the east coast of Kintyre Peninsula, in Argyll and Bute, west of Scotland. It is a tidal island, linked to the mainland by a natural shingle causeway called the Doìrlinn near Campbeltown at low tide. The crossing can be made in around 40 minutes.

==History==
Davaar was known as the island of Sanct Barre between the years 1449 to 1508. The modern form &quot;Davaar&quot; is from older Do Bharre – thy St Barre. Dr Gillies in his &quot;Place Names of Argyll&quot; appears to accept the popular derivation, Double-pointed (Da-Bharr) Island.

In 1854, was built on the island&#x27;s north by the lighthouse engineers David and Thomas Stevenson. The lighthouse was automated in 1983, and today, Davaar is inhabited by the caretakers of the Island who run the holiday cottages and oversee the farming activities including Rare breed sheep, and Highland Cattle. The island is also home to feral goats.

The Lookout, a square building standing on a small knoll close to the lighthouse, was built during World War II as one of the Royal Observer Corps&#x27; (ROC)&#x27;s four Kintyre observation posts. While the men and women of the ROC watched for enemy activity around the loch, the anti-submarine net (positioned between Davaar and Trench Point) was maintained by the wrens, officers, and ratings stationed in the Boom Defence Depot on the opposite shore. Davaar&#x27;s observation post has been restored and tastefully converted into a unique place to stay.
The island is also known for its seven caves, one of which contains a life size cave painting depicting the crucifixion, painted in 1887 by local artist Archibald MacKinnon after he had a vision in a dream suggesting him to do so. The painting caused uproar in the area as it was seen as a sign from God; it is said that when the townsfolk discovered it was MacKinnon, and not God, he was exiled from the town indefinitely. Restored several times since, including twice by the original artist, the painting was vandalised in July 2006, having a red and black depiction of Che Guevara painted over the original masterpiece. It has since been restored again.

Davaar Island is one of 43 tidal islands that can be walked to from the mainland of Great Britain and one of 17 that can be walked to from the Scottish mainland.

Davaar Island is owned by Kildalloig Estate, and forms part of the farming enterprise.

== Staying on Davaar Island ==
There are four holiday cottages and cabins available for visitors to stay on Davaar Island. The Lookout (WWII Observation Post) and The Principal Lighthouse Keeper&#x27;s Cottage have been sympathetically converted into holiday cottages and in 2021 two glamping cabins were constructed on the east side of Davaar.

==Stamps==
Local stamps were issued for Davaar in the 1964. The stamps served the many visitors to the island who wished to have their mail posted there, and carried by the boatman to the nearest GPO Post Box at Campbeltown on the mainland. The boatman service ended some time in the 2000. Postage Rates were double those of the UK.

<text>Louis Segond (3 May 1810 – 18 June 1885) was a Swiss theologian who translated the Bible into French from the original texts in Hebrew and Greek.

He was born in Plainpalais, near Geneva. After studying theology in Geneva, Strasbourg and Bonn, he was pastor of the Geneva National Church in Chêne-Bougeries, then from 1872, Professor of Old Testament in Geneva.

==Biography==
Segond&#x27;s family was of modest wealth; his father was a Catholic shoemaker while his mother was a Protestant church of Geneva member, the denomination he would be baptized into. He entered into the University of Geneva in 1826, where he studied natural sciences. Afterward, he joined the theological department of the University of Strasbourg. During that time, he spent a year and a half working in Bonn and another year in Eisenach. In 1839, he became pastor of the Genevan Church in Chêne-Bougeries. 

In 1871, he returned to the University of Geneva to become a professor studying the Old Testament. The translation of the Old Testament, commissioned by the &quot;Vénérable Compagnie des Pasteurs de Genève&quot;, was published in two volumes in 1871. It was at this time that he began to work on his translation, work that would be completed in 1880. A revised edition was commissioned for and published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1910.

<text>Amadora () is a city and municipality in the northwest of the Lisbon metropolitan area and 10 km from central Lisbon. The population in 2011 was 175,136, in an area of 23.78 km2 (9.2 sq mi). It is the fourth biggest, and most densely populated, city in Portugal.

==History==
There is significant evidence of Neolithic settlements in the municipality. The Necropolis of Carenque consists of three artificial caves that served as tombs from around 3000 BCE.

Amadora was originally named &quot;Porcalhota&quot;, for being a Majorat of the daughter of a man surnamed &quot;Porcalho&quot; who was called for being a female &quot;Porcalhota&quot;.

The Aqueduto das Águas Livres, which brings water from the Sintra hills to Lisbon, and stretches , was finished in the 1770s and includes the largest masonry arch ever built, located in Campolide — the local coat of arms also displays the aqueduct (like others along its way).

At the request of its population, in 1907, a decree issued during King Carlos I reign, merged the communities of Porcalhota, Amadora and Venteira into one town named Amadora.

At the present time Amadora does not have any airfield. However, in the 1920s a small airfield (the first in Portugal) was located here. The first flight from Portugal to Brazil left from Amadora. The Captain of the airplane was Adm. Gago Coutinho, a well known Portuguese celebrity.

The municipality was formed on 11 September 1979, when it ceased being a parish of the municipality of Oeiras. A few days later, on 17 September, Amadora was granted city status.

The former Sorefame railway rolling stock factory was located in Amadora, but was closed in 2004. Most of the carriages for Portuguese Railways built during the second half of the 20th century were constructed here.

==Geography==
One of the largest urban communities in Portugal, Amadora forms a conurbation with Lisbon, sharing the same subway, bus and train networks. It is dominated by large apartment blocks, commercial parks, industrial areas and some headquarters of international companies.

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 6 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Águas Livres
* Alfragide
* Encosta do Sol
* Falagueira-Venda Nova
* Mina de Água
* Venteira

==Climate==
Amadora has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers.

==Economy==
Despite being a residential city, Amadora has commercial zones, industries and headquarters of international companies operating in Portugal.

As commercial zones, it has IKEA, Nokia, Decathlon, Alegro, Continente and &quot;Ubbo&quot; (one of the biggest shopping malls in Europe). Siemens and Roche are examples of international companies based in Amadora.

Amadora hosted Portugals national builder of railway rolling stock, Sorefame, until its demise in 2004.

==Transport==
Amadora&#x27;s public transport network is extremely far-reaching and reliable and is fully integrated with the transportation network of the Lisbon metropolitan area. It has 3 metro stations, the commuter Sintra Line with 3 stations, 2 bus services (Carris Metropolitana and Carris) and 4 motorways around the city (2ª Circular, CRIL, CREL and IC-16).

Wagner was instructed in the ways of plant microphotograph and embryology by Marion S. Cave. Wagner was a longtime faculty member at the University of Michigan. He was most respected among his colleagues and students for his genius in discerning and articulating the differences in form between plant species in the context of their variation with environmental factors.

He developed, in the early 1960s, the first algorithm for discerning phylogenetic relationships among species based upon their respective character states observed over a set of characters. This work was honored by James Farris and Arnold Kluge in their later appellation of related algorithms as &quot;Wagner parsimony.&quot;

Wagner became a pteridologist later in life, specializing in ferns, especially the Botrychiaceae. Having served in the U.S. Military in the Pacific Theater in World War II, he maintained a lifelong interest in the diversity and origin of the ferns of Hawaii. Working with his wife Florence Signaigo Wagner, an accomplished cytologist, he resolved the relationships of an array of polyploid complexes in North American ferns, first the Appalachian trio of &quot;Asplenium&quot; species, then in &quot;Dryopteris&quot; and &quot;Polystichum&quot;.

He was President of the Botanical Society of America in 1977. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1985.

Apparently among modern phylogenetic systematists, Wagner is alone in having been mentioned in a Hollywood film − &quot;A New Leaf&quot;, starring Elaine May and Walter Matthau.

<text>Orson Squire Fowler (October 11, 1809 – August 18, 1887) was an American phrenologist and lecturer. He also popularized the octagon house in the middle of the nineteenth century.

==Early life==
The son of Horace and Martha (Howe) Fowler, he was born in Cohocton, New York, He prepared for college at Ashland Academy and studied at Amherst College, graduating in the class of 1834.

==Career==
With his brother Lorenzo Niles Fowler, he opened a phrenological office in New York City. Orson wrote and lectured on phrenology, preservation of health, popular education and social reform from 1834 to 1887. Lorenzo and his wife Lydia Folger Fowler lectured frequently with Orson on the subject of phrenology. The three were &quot;in large measure&quot; responsible for the mid-19th century popularity of phrenology.

The practice of phrenology was frequently used to justify slavery and to advance a belief in African-American inferiority. Fowler wrote that coarse hair correlated with coarse fibers in the brain, and indicated coarse feelings; that, he wrote, suggested that people of African descent had poor verbal skills and traits that were best suited for nursing children or waiting on tables. At the same time, the phrenological journal edited by Fowler and his brother expressed strong abolitionist sentiments, calling slavery a &quot;a monstrous evil.&quot; Fowler&#x27;s writings were also anti-Semitic. For instance, in &quot;Hereditary Descent&quot; (1843), Fowler wrote that Jewish people were hereditarily acquisitive, deceitful, and destructive (phrenology believes that none of these &quot;organs&quot; are negative as such, but all can be used for good).

Orson edited and published &quot;The Phrenological Journal&quot;, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from 1838 to 1842. He was a partner with Fowler &amp; Wells, publishers, New York, from 1846 to 1854, residing in Fishkill, New York, and Elizabeth, New Jersey. His sister, Charlotte Fowler Wells, and her husband, were involved in the publishing house, and after it became a stock company, she served as president.

He built a home during 1848–1853, later termed Fowler&#x27;s Folly, which was an octagon house overlooking the Hudson River. He authored a book, &quot;The Octagon House: A Home For All&quot;, which claimed benefits to living in such a home, and which was instrumental in igniting a fad that spread fairly widely in the United States and Canada.

He moved his office to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1863, residing in Manchester from 1863 to 1880. He resided in Sharon, New York, from 1883 until August 18, 1887, when he died.

==Personal life==

Fowler was married three times: to Mrs. Eliza (Brevoort) Chevalier; to Mrs. Mary (Aiken) Poole; and to Abbie L. Ayres. He had three children.

Fowler was a teetotaller and vegetarian. He promoted a vegetarian diet in his book &quot;Physiology: Animal and Mental&quot; and was vice-president of the American Vegetarian Society in 1852. He defended animal rights and opposed the slaughter of animals. His magazine &quot;The American Phrenological Journal&quot; also supported vegetarianism.

==Legacy==
In 1856, followers of vegetarian Henry S. Clubb tried to establish Octagon City in Kansas.
The design was inspired by Fowler&#x27;s houses and would include octagonal houses and barns.
The pioneers could not make it through the winter.
The town of Fowler, Colorado, is named for Fowler. Fowler too had an influence on modern psychology. He is remembered as a man of universal reform who preached for education and temperance. Orson, like his sister-in-law Lydia Fowler, held forth for the equality for women at a time when women had virtually no legal rights in the United States. Orson stood for children&#x27;s rights when child labor was quite acceptable in the burgeoning industrial factories of his country. Fowler as a book seller and publisher was crucial in the original publication of Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; and other works.

<doc id="515610" wikidata="Q15489667" url="?curid=515610" title="Yana (Buddhism)">
<text>Yāna (Sanskrit: यान and Pāli: &quot;vehicle&quot;) refers to a mode or method of spiritual practice in Buddhism. It is claimed they were all taught by the Gautama Buddha in response to the various capacities of individuals. On an outwardly conventional level, the teachings and practices may appear contradictory, but ultimately they all have the same goal.

==Nomenclature, etymology and orthography==
In form, yāna is a neuter noun derived from the Sanskrit root yā- meaning to &quot;go to&quot; or &quot;move&quot; or &quot;reach&quot;. The suffix employed to form this noun may have different values: while primarily yāna is understood to refer to the means (kara.na) through which one goes to/ reaches a location, it may technically also refer to the action itself (bhāva). Yāna is therefore primarily a &quot;vehicle&quot;, in most contexts relevant to the Buddhist doctrine of three yānas.

&quot;Vehicle&quot; is often used as a preferred translation as the word that provides the least in the way of presuppositions about the mode of travel.

In specifically Buddhist contexts, the word yāna acquires many metaphorical meanings, discussed below.

==Teaching story and metaphor==
In the &quot;Mahāparinibbāna Sutta&quot; (1.33-34), Shakyamuni Buddha relates a story on &quot;vehicles&quot; of conveyance utilizing the sacred river Ganges, all of which may be engaged as a metaphor for &quot;yana&quot; and a gradual or direct path:

1.33 And then the Lord came to the River Ganges. And just then, the river was so full that a crow could drink out of it. And some people were looking for a boat, and some were looking for a raft, and some were binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. But the Lord, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again, vanished from this side of the Ganges and reappeared with his order of monks on the other shore.
1.34 And the Lord saw those people who were looking for a boat, looking for a raft, and binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. And seeing their intentions, he uttered this verse on the spot:
::&#x27;When they want to cross the sea, the lake or pond,
::People make a bridge or raft - the wise have crossed already.&#x27;
These two verses are meant to teach that all vehicles, teachings and doctrine are skillful means (Skt.&quot;upāya&quot;).

==Introduction and qualification of the term yana==
The &quot;Bodhipathapradīpa&quot; of Atisha (980-1054 CE), quoted in Gampopa&#x27;s (1079-1153 CE) Jewel Ornament of Liberation rendered into English by Günther, makes reference to people of three capacities:

Man is to be known in three ways:
As inferior, mediocre and excellent.

He who by any means whatsoever
Provides for the pleasures of Saṃsāra
For himself alone,
Is called an inferior man.

He who turns his back to the pleasures of the world
And abstains from evil deeds,
But provides only for his own peace,
Is called a mediocre man.

He who seriously wants to dispel
All the misery of others,
Because in the stream of his own being he has understood the nature of misery,
Is an excellent man.
Yana is determined by capacity and propensity of the &quot;precious human body&quot; wrought by merit, not by a specific teaching or lineage, as Gampopa states:

Therefore, because of the difficulty of its attainment, of the uneasiness of its breaking down, and of its great usefulness, we should think of the body as a boat and by its means escape from the ocean of Saṃsāra. As is written:
:Standing in the boat of the human body,
:You should cross the great flood of misery.
:Since later this boat is difficult to get,
:Do not sleep now, you fool.
Empowerment, initiation, intention and endeavour may leaven capacity and propensity as may a ful benediction of a person (in the sense of mindstream), object or place endowed or invested with holiness. In the teaching story abovementioned, Shakyamuni Buddhi and his sangha traverse the continuum directly in the body of their own experience rather than constructing a gradual vehicle for passage.

==Usage==
In Buddhism and Hinduism, both &quot;yāna&quot; and &quot;mārga&quot; (road or path) are metaphors depicting spiritual practice as a path or journey. Ancient texts in both religions discuss doctrines and practices associated with various &quot;yānas&quot;. In Buddhism, &quot;yāna&quot; often expands the metaphor of the spiritual path with the idea of various vehicles that convey a person along that path. The &quot;yāna / mārga&quot; metaphor pervasive within Buddhism and other traditions is an analogue to the Chinese metaphor of the Tao: The Tao though is the Way as the endgoal and not just the art of wayfinding. The dialogic spiritual traditions of Indian and Chinese culture hold common cultural memes.

==Vedic origins of &quot;-yāna&quot; as a spiritual journey==

The use of &quot;yāna&quot; to use as a name or to refer to a spiritual journey may date to the &#x27;, possibly composed circa 1500 BCE, whose 10th Mandala makes several references to &quot;devayāna&quot;, (translators usually render this as the &quot;path of the gods&quot; or similar) and one reference to &#x27; (&quot;path of the fathers&quot;). The first verse of the &#x27;s burial hymn (10.18) translates approximately as &quot;O Death, take the other path, which is distinct from the way of the gods&quot; (&#x27;). The &quot;other path&quot; is the &#x27;, referred to in hymn 10.2 and alluded to in 10.14 and 10.16. 

The &quot;devayāna&quot; and &#x27; evolved from the ancient Rig Vedic concern for immortality to the classical Hindu concern with ending  existence. The , which comment on the Vedas, make further reference to &quot;devayāna&quot; and &#x27;. Among other distinctions, the pitryana was said to refer the religious practices of villagers, and the devayāna was said to refer to the practices of recluses living in the forest. The (II.iv.11 and IV.v.12) also makes reference to &quot;ekayāna&quot;, notably in the phrase &quot;&quot;, where &quot;ekayānam&quot; connotes &quot;one journey&quot;. The phrase translates approximately to &quot; Sacred Vedas - intonation - (is the) one journey/destination&quot;, in the same sense that a river&#x27;s journey is to the ocean. 

== Yāna in early Buddhist texts ==
Yāna is one of ten suggested gifts (&quot;dana&quot;) that a lay person can appropriately give a monk or recluse, in the sense of providing a vehicle or transportation (e.g., see DN 7.33/PTS: A iv 59 and DN 10.177/PTS: A v 269).

The earliest explicit Buddhist use of -yāna in a metaphorical sense of a journey to awakening may be the term &quot;dhammayānam&quot;, &quot;dharma chariot&quot; (SN IV.4), where the vehicle itself serves as an extended metaphor for the Eightfold Path. Various parts of the chariot represent aspects of the Path (&quot;magga&quot;), e.g. axles represent meditation, the charioteer represents mindfulness, and so on.

Thus, metaphorical usage of yāna in the sense of a vehicle (as distinct from a path) emerged from a Buddhist context, and it did so relatively early in the evolution of Buddhism. Nevertheless, while the Pali Canon are very rich in images of wheels (&quot;cakka&quot;) and paths (&quot;magga&quot;) as metaphors for the journey to awakening, the Pali Canon rarely uses the term &quot;yāna&quot; for that purpose.

According to Fujita Kotatsu the term Three Vehicles does not occur in the Pâli tripitaka, however corresponding terms (&quot;trîni yânâni&quot;, &quot;triyâna&quot;, &quot;yânatraya&quot;) are used in the Ekottara Agama, the Mahavastu, and the Mahāvibhāṣa Śāstra. In these texts the Three Vehicles include the &quot;srâvakayâna&quot;, &quot;pratyekabuddhayâna&quot;, and &quot;buddhayâna&quot;.

==Enumeration of &quot;yānas&quot; in Mahayana texts==
Mahayana texts are very rich in images of vehicles that serve in metaphors for journeys to awakening.

===The three carts of expedient means: the parable of the burning house===
The tradition of Mahayana texts employing the image of different types of vehicles and conveyances as salient metaphor for the journey of novice to the awakening of adept may have begun with the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;. The Lotus Sūtra holds a parable of a devoted father with three small children entranced in childhood play within the family home, oblivious that tongues of flame are ravenously engulfing the house. The father entices the children from the burning home with the half-truth gilded promise of special carts for each of them. The carts though are only an expedient means for luring the children from the house.

Katō &quot;et al.&quot; render thus into English a tract of the &quot;Saddharma Puṇḍarīka&quot; pertaining to the cart of expedient means and the parable of the burning house:

&quot;Śāriputra! Even as that elder, though with power in body and arms, yet does not use it but only by diligent tact resolutely saves [his] children from the calamity of the burning house and then gives each of them great carts made of precious things, so it is with the Tathāgata; though he has power and fearlessness, he does not use them, but only by his wise tact does he remove and save all living creatures from the burning house of the triple world, preaching the three vehicles: the śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and Buddha vehicle.
In the parable, the carts are explicitly identified as corresponding to the three types of Buddha: the goat-cart represents the practices leading to the attainment of Arhatship; the deer-cart, Pratyekabuddhahood; and the bullock-cart, Samyaksambuddhahood. The sutra goes on to say these that the teachings of the three vehicles are merely expedient means (upāya). Their purpose is to direct people toward &quot;ekayāna&quot;, the one vehicle, depicted in the parable as a jeweled cart driven by a white ox.

===The relationship of Dharma (Law) and Yana===
Tamura &quot;et al.&quot; render a section of the &quot;Innumerable Meanings Sutra&quot; (Wu-liang-i ching) that relates the relationship of the Law (Dharma) and various teachings as fundamentally determined by the audience and context:

      &quot;Good sons! The Law is like water that washes off dirt. As a well, a pond, a stream, a river, a valley stream, a ditch, or a great sea, each alike effectively washes off all kinds of dirt, so the Law-water effectively washes off the dirt of all delusions of living beings.
      &quot;Good sons! The nature of water is one, but a stream, a river, a well, a pond, a valley stream, a ditch, and a great sea are different from one another. The nature of the Law is like this. There is equality and no differentiation in washing off the dirt of delusions, but the three laws, the four merits, and the two ways§ are not one and the same.
      &quot;Good sons! Though each washes equally as water, a well is not a pond, a pond is not a stream or a river, nor is a valley stream or a ditch a sea. As the Tathāgata, the world&#x27;s hero, is free in the Law, all the laws preached by him are also like this. Though preaching at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end all alike effectively wash off the delusions of living beings, the beginning is not the middle, and the middle is not the end. Preaching at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end are the same in expression but different from one another in meaning.

§ The three laws are the Four Noble Truths, the Twelve Causes, and the Six Pāramitās...; the four merits are srota-āpanna, sakṛdāgāmin, anāgāmin, and arhat...; and the two ways the great vehicle, or Mahayana, and the lesser vehicle, or Hinayana.

===Ekayāna (one yana)===

Mahayana texts such as the Lotus Sutra and the Avatamsaka Sutra sought to unite all the different teachings into a single great way. These texts serve as the inspiration for using the term &quot;Ekayāna&quot; in the sense of &quot;one vehicle&quot;. This &quot;one vehicle&quot; became a key aspect of the doctrines and practices of Tiantai and Tendai Buddhist sects, which subsequently influenced Chán and Zen doctrines and practices. In Japan, the one-vehicle teaching of the Lotus Sutra also inspired the formation of the Nichiren sect.

===Two yānas===
Traditionally, the two vehicles in Mahāyāna Buddhism consist of Śrāvakayāna and Pratyekabuddhayāna. Mahāyāna Buddhists take a vow to become the third type, namely bodhisattvas. Therefore, Mahayana Buddhist texts sometimes use terms like &quot;followers of the two vehicles&quot; to refer to Buddhists who do not accept the Mahayana sutras.

Some Mahāyāna sutras consider that the two vehicles together comprise the &quot;Hīnayāna&quot; – literally, inferior vehicle; sometimes, small vehicle. Modern texts sometimes refer to Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna as &quot;two vehicles&quot;. But referring to an &quot;inferior vehicle&quot; is often felt to be disrespectful to those Buddhists who do not consider the Mahāyāna sutras to be &quot;buddhavacana&quot;.

===Three yānas===
Mahāyāna Buddhists often express two different schemata of three yanas. First, here are three paths to liberation that culminate as one of the three types of Buddha:

*Śrāvakayāna: The Hearer vehicle: A path that meets the goals of an arhat who achieves liberation after listening to the teachings of a samyaksambuddha (fully enlightened buddha).
*Pratyekabuddhayāna: The Pratyekabuddha achieves liberation, but does not teach other beings. Pratyekabuddhas do not depend on a teacher and can discover the Dharma even if they do not encounter a buddha. They are sometimes said to remain silent and solitary.
*Bodhisattvayāna: The bodhisattva attains liberation and wishes to benefit as many beings as possible. A bodhisattva who has accomplished this goal is called a samyaksambuddha. A samyaksambuddha can establish the Dharma and lead disciples to enlightenment.

A second classification came into use with the rise of the Vajrayāna, which created a hierarchy of the teachings with the Vajrayāna being the highest path. The Vajrayāna itself became multilayered especially in Tibetan Buddhism.

* Hīnayāna
* Mahāyāna
* Vajrayāna

When the historical Buddha Shakyamuni taught, he gave teachings appropriate to the individual capacities of his students. The Hinayana was taught to those with lesser capacity with an emphasis on actions of body and speech. Mahayana was taught to those with greater capacity with an emphasis on actions of mind and Vajrayana was taught to those exceptional beings who were able to directly realise the nature of mind. Outwardly on a conventional level, these teachings and practices may appear contradictory but on an ultimate level, they all have the same goal.

===Four yānas===
Mahayana Buddhists sometimes refer to four yanas that subsume the two different schemes of the three yanas:
* Śrāvakayāna
* Pratyekabuddhayāna
* Mahāyāna
* Vajrayāna

===Five yānas===
This is a Mahāyāna list which is found in East Asian Buddhism.

* Puruṣayāna - the human vehicle. This is the very beginning of the spiritual path
* Devayāna - the practice of ethics and meditation
* Śrāvakayāna - the practice of renunciation and the Four Noble Truths
* Pratyekabuddhayāna - practice concerned with dependent arising (&quot;pratitya-samutpada&quot;)
* Bodhisattvayāna - practice of the Six Perfections

===Six yānas===
The five yānas plus the Vajrayāna. This schema is associated with Shingon Buddhism in Japan. It was invented by Kūkai in order to help to differentiate the Vajrayāna teachings that he imported from China in the early 9th century. Kūkai wanted to show that the new teachings were entirely new.

===Nine yānas===
The Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism has nine yanas, a list made by combining the first type of three yanas, and adding the six classes of tantras.
*Hīnayāna
** 1. Śrāvakayāna
** 2. Pratyekabuddhayāna
* Mahāyāna &quot; consisting of:&quot;
** 3. Bodhisattvayāna
** Vajrayāna,&quot; consisting of:&quot;
*** &quot;Outer Tantras&quot;
**** 4. Kriyatantra
**** 5. Upatantra (Tibetan spyod rgyud) ‘practice tantra’ and the Ubhayatantra (gnyis ka’i rgyud), ‘dual tantra’, because it practices the view of the next vehicle, Yogatantra, together with the action of the former.
**** 6. Yogatantra
***&quot;Inner Tantras&quot;
**** 7. Mahāyoga
**** 8. Anuyoga
****9. Atiyoga (also Dzogchen)

The head of the Nyingma school, Dudjom Rinpoche emphasizes the eight lower vehicles are intellectually fabricated and contrived:

===Twelve yānas===
Another schema associated with Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna sources:

# Śrāvakayāna
# Pratyekabuddhayāna
# Bodhisattvayāna
# Kriyayoga
# Charyayoga (or Upayoga)
# Yogatantra
# Mahayoga
# Anuyoga
# Atiyoga
## Semde
## Longdé
## Mengagde

<text>In commutative algebra, a Gorenstein local ring is a commutative Noetherian local ring &quot;R&quot; with finite injective dimension as an &quot;R&quot;-module. There are many equivalent conditions, some of them listed below, often saying that a Gorenstein ring is self-dual in some sense.

Gorenstein rings were introduced by Grothendieck in his 1961 seminar (published in ). The name comes from a duality property of singular plane curves studied by (who was fond of claiming that he did not understand the definition of a Gorenstein ring ). The zero-dimensional case had been studied by . and publicized the concept of Gorenstein rings.

Frobenius rings are noncommutative analogs of zero-dimensional Gorenstein rings. Gorenstein schemes are the geometric version of Gorenstein rings.

For Noetherian local rings, there is the following chain of inclusions.
==Definitions==

A Gorenstein ring is a commutative Noetherian ring such that each localization at a prime ideal is a Gorenstein local ring, as defined below. A Gorenstein ring is in particular Cohen–Macaulay.

One elementary characterization is: a Noetherian local ring &quot;R&quot; of dimension zero (equivalently, with &quot;R&quot; of finite length as an &quot;R&quot;-module) is Gorenstein if and only if Hom&quot;R&quot;(&quot;k&quot;, &quot;R&quot;) has dimension 1 as a &quot;k&quot;-vector space, where &quot;k&quot; is the residue field of &quot;R&quot;. Equivalently, &quot;R&quot; has simple socle as an &quot;R&quot;-module. More generally, a Noetherian local ring &quot;R&quot; is Gorenstein if and only if there is a regular sequence &quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; in the maximal ideal of &quot;R&quot; such that the quotient ring &quot;R&quot;/( &quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is Gorenstein of dimension zero.

For example, if &quot;R&quot; is a commutative graded algebra over a field &quot;k&quot; such that &quot;R&quot; has finite dimension as a &quot;k&quot;-vector space, &quot;R&quot; = &quot;k&quot; ⊕ &quot;R&quot;1 ⊕ ... ⊕ &quot;R&quot;&quot;m&quot;, then &quot;R&quot; is Gorenstein if and only if it satisfies Poincaré duality, meaning that the top graded piece &quot;R&quot;&quot;m&quot; has dimension 1 and the product &quot;R&quot;&quot;a&quot; × &quot;R&quot;&quot;m&quot;−&quot;a&quot; → &quot;R&quot;&quot;m&quot; is a perfect pairing for every &quot;a&quot;.

Another interpretation of the Gorenstein property as a type of duality, for not necessarily graded rings, is: for a field &quot;F&quot;, a commutative &quot;F&quot;-algebra &quot;R&quot; of finite dimension as an &quot;F&quot;-vector space (hence of dimension zero as a ring) is Gorenstein if and only if there is an &quot;F&quot;-linear map &quot;e&quot;: &quot;R&quot; → &quot;F&quot; such that the symmetric bilinear form (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) := &quot;e&quot;(&quot;xy&quot;) on &quot;R&quot; (as an &quot;F&quot;-vector space) is nondegenerate.

For a commutative Noetherian local ring (&quot;R&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;k&quot;) of Krull dimension &quot;n&quot;, the following are equivalent:
* &quot;R&quot; has finite injective dimension as an &quot;R&quot;-module;
* &quot;R&quot; has injective dimension &quot;n&quot; as an &quot;R&quot;-module;
* The Ext group formula_1 for &quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;n&quot; while formula_2
* formula_1 for some &quot;i&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;;
* formula_1 for all &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; and formula_2
* &quot;R&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Gorenstein ring.

A (not necessarily commutative) ring &quot;R&quot; is called Gorenstein if &quot;R&quot; has finite injective dimension both as a left &quot;R&quot;-module and as a right &quot;R&quot;-module. If &quot;R&quot; is a local ring, &quot;R&quot; is said to be a local Gorenstein ring.

==Examples==

* Every local complete intersection ring, in particular every regular local ring, is Gorenstein.
*The ring &quot;R&quot; = &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;]/(&quot;x&quot;2, &quot;y&quot;2, &quot;xz&quot;, &quot;yz&quot;, &quot;z&quot;2−&quot;xy&quot;) is a 0-dimensional Gorenstein ring that is not a complete intersection ring. In more detail: a basis for &quot;R&quot; as a &quot;k&quot;-vector space is given by: formula_6 &quot;R&quot; is Gorenstein because the socle has dimension 1 as a &quot;k&quot;-vector space, spanned by &quot;z&quot;2. Alternatively, one can observe that &quot;R&quot; satisfies Poincaré duality when it is viewed as a graded ring with &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; all of the same degree. Finally. &quot;R&quot; is not a complete intersection because it has 3 generators and a minimal set of 5 (not 3) relations.

*The ring &quot;R&quot; = &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;]/(&quot;x&quot;2, &quot;y&quot;2, &quot;xy&quot;) is a 0-dimensional Cohen–Macaulay ring that is not a Gorenstein ring. In more detail: a basis for &quot;R&quot; as a &quot;k&quot;-vector space is given by: formula_7 &quot;R&quot; is not Gorenstein because the socle has dimension 2 (not 1) as a &quot;k&quot;-vector space, spanned by &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

== Properties ==
*A Noetherian local ring is Gorenstein if and only if its completion is Gorenstein.

*The canonical module of a Gorenstein local ring &quot;R&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;R&quot;. In geometric terms, it follows that the standard dualizing complex of a Gorenstein scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field is simply a line bundle (viewed as a complex in degree −dim(&quot;X&quot;)); this line bundle is called the canonical bundle of &quot;X&quot;. Using the canonical bundle, Serre duality takes the same form for Gorenstein schemes as in the smooth case.

:In the context of graded rings &quot;R&quot;, the canonical module of a Gorenstein ring &quot;R&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;R&quot; with some degree shift.

*For a Gorenstein local ring (&quot;R&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;k&quot;) of dimension &quot;n&quot;, Grothendieck local duality takes the following form. Let &quot;E&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) be the injective hull of the residue field &quot;k&quot; as an &quot;R&quot;-module. Then, for any finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; and integer &quot;i&quot;, the local cohomology group formula_8 is dual to formula_9 in the sense that:
::formula_10

*Stanley showed that for a finitely generated commutative graded algebra &quot;R&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; such that &quot;R&quot; is an integral domain, the Gorenstein property depends only on the Cohen–Macaulay property together with the Hilbert series 
::formula_11 
:Namely, a graded domain &quot;R&quot; is Gorenstein if and only if it is Cohen–Macaulay and the Hilbert series is symmetric in the sense that
::formula_12
:for some integer &quot;s&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of &quot;R&quot;.

*Let (&quot;R&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;k&quot;) be a Noetherian local ring of embedding codimension &quot;c&quot;, meaning that &quot;c&quot; = dim&quot;k&quot;(&quot;m&quot;/&quot;m&quot;2) − dim(&quot;R&quot;). In geometric terms, this holds for a local ring of a subscheme of codimension &quot;c&quot; in a regular scheme. For &quot;c&quot; at most 2, Serre showed that &quot;R&quot; is Gorenstein if and only if it is a complete intersection. There is also a structure theorem for Gorenstein rings of codimension 3 in terms of the Pfaffians of a skew-symmetric matrix, by Buchsbaum and Eisenbud. In 2011, Miles Reid extended this structure theorem to case of codimension 4.

<text>Caniapiscau (; ) is a vast unorganized territory in the Côte-Nord region of Quebec, Canada, part of Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality.

The territory is home to the huge Caniapiscau Reservoir, the largest body of water in Quebec and the second-largest reservoir in Canada. The reservoir was named after Lake Caniapiscau that was flooded in 1981 during the formation of the reservoir. The name comes from the Cree or Innu term &quot;kaniapiskau&quot; or &quot;kaneapiskak&quot; which means &quot;rocky point&quot; or &quot;place where there is a rocky point&quot;. Albert Peter Low had noted in 1895 that &quot;a high rocky headland jutts into the lake.&quot; He probably referred to the northwest facing peninsula that gives the reservoir the shape of an arc as we know it now.

In the 19th century, Lake Caniapiscau was frequented by hunters and fur traders. In 1834, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company opened there an outpost to link its facilities in the James Bay region with those of Ungava Bay. The Kaniapiskau Post closed in 1870.

==Community==

Caniapiscau () is a small community without a permanent population, just north of the Caniapiscau Reservoir. It was formed as a temporary worksite in 1974 for workers involved in the construction of the dams and floodgates of this reservoir. The reservoir was built as part of the James Bay Project that gave rise to the La Grande hydroelectric complex. The worksite was closed after construction ended towards 1984.

Accessible only by air from 1974 to 1976, when a temporary landing strip was cleared on a nearby frozen lake, by an ice road from James Bay from 1977 to 1979 and, since late 1979, by the long gravel Trans-Taiga Road (French: &quot;Route Transtaïga&quot;) which branches off the James Bay Road (French: &quot;Route de la Baie James&quot;). The between Caniapiscau and Brisay is only recommended for four-wheel drive vehicles due to large rocks on the coarse-gravel surface.

The site is now used by an outfitter (fishing and caribou hunting) and the commercial Lac Pau Seaplane Base allows floatplanes to launch, subject to seasonal conditions.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
Caniapiscau is accessible by car via the Trans-Taiga Road. Located approximately 75 km south of Radisson, the Trans-Taiga highway is an unpaved gravel road. Along the road there are several campgrounds where users are able to spend the night. Donations are accepted, but not required. There are also several outfitters located along the way. Some are only open during certain times of the year, however Pourvoirie Mirage is open all year round at km 358. Food and gas may be purchased at this location. Caniapiscau Aerodrome is located in this region.

<doc id="515620" wikidata="Q530550" url="?curid=515620" title="Jesse James (television personality)">
<text>Jesse Gregory James (born April 19, 1969, Long Beach, California) is an American entrepreneur, automotive mechanic, and television personality. He is the founder of West Coast Choppers and former partner of Austin Speed Shop and current CEO of Jesse James Firearms Unlimited, both based in Austin, Texas.

James rose to fame as the host of the reality TV shows &quot;Monster Garage&quot; on the Discovery Channel and &quot;Jesse James Is a Dead Man&quot; on Spike TV. He also appeared in the 2004 skateboarding video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot;.

== Career ==
James played as an outside linebacker at Riverside City College in Riverside, but two injuries forced him to end his playing career. 

At age 19, he became a bouncer and then a bodyguard, notably for Slayer, Glenn Danzig, and Soundgarden.

In 1992, James founded West Coast Choppers in his mother&#x27;s garage. In addition to his work with the company, he has built and is actively racing both an off-road Trophy Truck and a Figure-8 race car.

James was the owner of the Cisco Burger restaurant, which opened on April 28, 2006, across the street from West Coast Choppers which has officially closed. James also had partial ownership in Austin Speed Shop in Austin, Texas, which he left in 2013 to focus on the re-opening of West Coast Choppers in Austin.

Other business ventures include the fan club &quot;Chopperdogs&quot; and &quot;Jesse&#x27;s Girl&quot; clothing line. James published the now-defunct custom-car magazine &quot;Garage&quot;.

In November 2013, Jesse James Firearms Unlimited unveiled its first two firearms, a 1911 pistol and an AR-15 rifle. His first rifle-caliber suppressor was a basic reworking of an original Maxim design that he claimed could impossibly bend the laws of physics by offering a 78 dB rating at the muzzle, lower than even what the De Lisle carbine achieved in testing; although James was careful to note that it only achieved that number with subsonic ammunition that does not produce a sonic boom.

, James lives in Austin, Texas, operates Jesse James Fire Arms Unlimited, and manages the intellectual properties of West Coast Choppers.

== Television ==
In 2000, the Discovery Channel made the documentary &quot;Motorcycle Mania&quot;, which chronicled James&#x27; everyday life. Following the success of the documentary, the Discovery Channel approached James with an offer to host a new show called &quot;Monster Garage&quot; where James and a crew of mechanics modified vehicles under a short deadline. James later established Payupsucker Productions, under which he produced shows like &quot;History of the Chopper&quot;, &quot;Iraq Confidential with Jesse James&quot; and &quot;Green Scream&quot;, in which James plans to break the land speed record with an eco-friendly hydrogen car.

Through James&#x27; show &quot;History of the Chopper&quot; there are also glimpses of his involvement with the Hells Angels.

He also made an appearance on the Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Sons of Guns&quot;. He appeared on the second season of &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. Each celebrity played to raise money for a favorite charity; James selected to play for the Long Beach Education Foundation. Due to his poor performance in raising funds, James was eliminated by Donald Trump on the second-to-last show (ultimately placing third) which aired May 3, 2009. Trump repeatedly cited James&#x27; stoic refusal to contact then-wife Sandra Bullock to raise funds for the show&#x27;s challenges, though other celebrities had no problem tapping high-rolling contacts for cash.

His show &quot;Jesse James Is a Dead Man&quot; premiered on Spike TV on May 31, 2009. The show features James doing death-defying stunts. The first episode set a rating record for Spike, drawing the largest audience ever for an unscripted series on the network, with 2 million viewers. The show is produced by Spike TV, BASE Productions and James&#x27; company, PayupSucker Productions. In conjunction with that appearance Marvel Comics created a special one-shot comic book where he evades death once again after considering retirement, and made it available in comic book stores for free distribution.

James appeared on an episode of &quot;Street Customs&quot; where he had his pickup truck customized by West Coast Customs.

He appeared in an advertisement for T-Mobile&#x27;s Google mobile phone with Whoopi Goldberg and Phil Jackson. Jesse James appeared on &quot;Sons of Guns&quot; on March 28, 2012. He asked the Red Jacket Firearms team to build a customized Browning Automatic Rifle for him and even assisted in the build himself.

Jesse appeared in special &quot;Biker Build-Off&quot; episodes of &quot;American Chopper&quot; in 2011 and 2012 for bike build-off competitions with Paul Teutul Jr. (representing Paul Jr. Designs) and Paul Teutul Sr. (representing Orange County Choppers), with Gas Monkey Garage (featured on the Discovery series &quot;Fast N&#x27; Loud&quot;) entering the competition in 2012.

== Personal life ==
=== Family and relationships ===
James&#x27; Discovery Channel website states that his great-great-grandfather was the notorious outlaw&#x27;s cousin.

However, Eric James, president of the James Preservation Trust, which tracks claims of being a relative of the outlaw, says it cannot find a record of him in the family tree and has asked him to provide a family genealogy and DNA sample for the trust to review; he has not provided the requested information.

James has four children: a daughter and a son with his first wife, Karla James, to whom he was married from 1991 to 2002; a daughter with his second wife, stripper/adult actress/producer Janine Lindemulder, to whom he was married from 2002 to 2004; and a son with his fifth wife, former porn actress and model Bonnie Rotten, whom he married in 2022.

On July 16, 2005, James married his third wife, actress Sandra Bullock. They met when she arranged for her ten-year-old godson, a fan, to tour the set of &quot;Monster Garage&quot;.

In October 2009, James&#x27; ex-wife Lindemulder, who had been in federal prison for six months for tax evasion, sought to regain custody of her then five-year-old daughter with James, after James had been granted sole guardianship of her. James sought to retain full guardianship, citing fear of the environment in which his daughter would be placed if returned to Lindemulder. In December, James won custody, and Lindemulder was given weekly visitation rights during the daytime.

In March 2010, a media scandal arose when several women claimed to have had affairs with James during his marriage to Bullock. Bullock canceled European promotional appearances for &quot;The Blind Side&quot; citing &quot;unforeseen personal reasons.&quot; On March 18, 2010, James responded to the rumors of infidelity by issuing a public apology to Bullock. James declared that &quot;There is only one person to blame for this whole situation, and that is me,&quot; and asked that his wife and children one day &quot;find it in their hearts to forgive me&quot; for their current &quot;pain and embarrassment.&quot; James&#x27; publicist subsequently announced on March 30, 2010, that James had checked into a rehab facility &quot;to deal with personal issues&quot; and &quot;save his marriage&quot; to Bullock. However, on April 28, 2010, it was reported that Bullock had filed for divorce on April 23 in Austin, Texas. Bullock also stated that she had planned to adopt a baby boy born in New Orleans. Bullock and James had begun an initial adoption process four years earlier. The child began living with them in January 2010, but they kept the news private until after the Oscars in March 2010. However, given the couple&#x27;s separation and then divorce, Bullock continued the adoption of the baby as a single parent. The divorce was finalized on June 28, 2010, with &quot;conflict of personalities&quot; cited as the reason.

In August 2010, tattoo artist Kat Von D confirmed reports that she and James were dating. James and Von D became engaged in January 2011. Von D announced that they had split in July 2011. However, in August 2011, James and Von D announced their engagement was back on. In September 2011, Von D announced that she and James had broken up again. Von D later accused James of cheating on her with multiple women during their relationship.

In late 2012, James became engaged to professional drag racer Alexis DeJoria. They married on March 24, 2013, at the estate of the bride&#x27;s father, entrepreneur John Paul DeJoria. In March 2020, James announced his separation from DeJoria after seven years of marriage, stating, &quot;Our lives were just headed in different directions.&quot;

Since late 2021, James has been in a relationship with former porn film star Bonnie Rotten. They married on June 25, 2022, and welcomed a son exactly one year later. It was reported on November 22, 2024, that Bonnie Rotten had filed for divorce. Both of them filed for restraining orders against each other citing abuse. 

=== Legal troubles ===
In 2007, James was fined $271,250 by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) after state officials determined that he had sold motorcycles violating California&#x27;s clean-air laws. According to authorities, James&#x27; customized bikes were emitting 11 times the legal limits of hydrocarbons. Investigators also found that the motorcycles did not have state-certified emissions equipment on their fuel tanks. The bikes were sold between 1997 and 2006. James explained that he was unaware of rule changes that required small-volume manufacturers to comply with regulations. James said the CARB refused his offer to recall and modify the uncompliant choppers. Since 2005, West Coast Choppers has built emissions-compliant choppers. James said the fines were excessive and intended to make an example of him due to his company&#x27;s fame and his celebrity marriage to actress Sandra Bullock, but CARB spokesmen stated their enforcement efforts were aimed at the entire custom industry and further that they were aware of no offer by West Coast Choppers to recall the motorcycles in question.

In July 2008, James faced a $422,680 breach of contract lawsuit from Michael Jones, a customer who hired James to build him a custom car, who contended that after paying $270,000 over two years, the car was not completed and that James informed him that it would cost between $600,000 and $700,000. That September, James faced another lawsuit from his former lawyer for $327,533 in unpaid fees.

In 2010, James was accused by Fortune Fashions Industries, LLC of working with Walmart and stealing one of Fortune Fashions Industries&#x27; executives to work on the clothing line after a failed collaboration between Jesse and Fortune Fashions. The company claimed over 6million dollars in damage, and lawyer LawrenceH. Nagler, representing the LLC, claimed &quot;Jesse has stolen the benefit of Fortune Fashions&#x27; work and manpower to put this together.&quot; James&#x27; lawyer JosephA. Yanny pointed out that James was a prolific entrepreneur, selling his West Coast Choppers brand apparel in his shop and online, long before he met Fred Kayne (owner of Fortune Fashions). The trial concluded with a verdict in favor of James. When Fortune Fashion Industries asked the judge to quash the jury decision, the judge stated they were &quot;not entitled to any proceeds from an unrelated line of clothing that came into being a year after the failed venture.&quot;

=== Controversial photos ===
After James entered rehab after giving a Nazi salute and wearing a Nazi-era cap, he explained to the ABC News show &quot;Nightline&quot; that the photo, taken in 2004 before his marriage to Bullock, was meant as a joke, and that he was not a racist. James&#x27; lawyer claimed that the hat was a gift from a Jewish mentor and that James is not a neo-Nazi. &quot;Us&quot; subsequently printed additional photos that had been posted to Facebook by former West Coast Choppers employees showing James and Nazi imagery. A friend of James explained to the magazine that the &quot;swastika deal&quot; is &quot;part of biker culture&quot;.

<text>Ston () is a settlement and a municipality in the Dubrovnik-Neretva County of Croatia, located at the south of isthmus of the Pelješac peninsula.

==History==
Because of its geopolitical and strategic position, Ston has had a rich history since ancient times. Located at the gates of the peninsula, surrounded by three seas, protected by four hills, rich in fresh water and saltwater, fertile plains, it has been an important political, cultural and ecclesiastical centre.

Initially it was an Illyrian settlement until the Romans established their own colony there, in 167 BC.

In 533, at Salona, a diocese of Sarsenterum was established for the Zachlumia (Hum) area, which belonged to the church in Ston (Pardui). Later Sarsenterum was destroyed, most likely at the time of the Avars&#x27; campaign. Since Ston was not reached by the Avars, it was spared and became the seat of the local &quot;župa&quot;.

Upon the arrival of the South Slavs in the 7th century, the area of the Neretva (from the northern Herzegovina mountains to Rijeka Dubrovačka) was organized as the principality of Zachlumia - same as Neretva, Primorje and Zahulje, which also belonged to Ston with Rat (Pelješac) and Mljet. Local rulers acknowledged the supremacy of the Byzantine Empire. 

As the secular and ecclesial powers grew, it is assumed that after the disappearance of Sarsenterum, Ston became a local ecclesiastical center. The diocese of Ston is first mentioned in 877, as an institution from an earlier time, and the bishop is listed as a suffragan of the metropolis of Split.

After Mihailo Višević, who ruled Zachlumia in the 10th century and acknowledged the authority of the Bulgarian Emperor Simeon, the territory was ruled over by different dynasties. Around 950, it was briefly ruled by the Serbian Prince Časlav. At the end of the 10th century, Samuilo was the Lord of Zachlumia, and the dukedom belonged to the Doclean King Jovan Vladimir.

With the establishment of the Archdiocese of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) in 1120, Ston became a suffragan of the latter.

In 1168, the dukedom and Zachlumia were conquered by Stefan Nemanja. Thirty years later, Zachlumia was invaded by Andrija, the Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia.

The old Ston was located on the slopes of the hills of Gorica and St. Michael, south of the Ston field. There were several early Christian churches, the largest of which was St. Stephen&#x27;s Church. The bishopric church of Mary Magdalene stood until it was bombed by the Allies in 1944. The only church that still remains is the church of St. Michael, built in the middle of the late antique castrum.
The original old town was demolished in the earthquake of 1252. With the arrival of the Republic, a new city was built on today&#x27;s location. When renovations were made at the church of St. Michael at the top of the hill, fragments of Roman decorative plaster, Roman tombstones and antique ceramics were found, confirming this assumption. According to some sources, Ston experienced a destructive civil war in 1250, and in these conflicts the city suffered a great deal of destruction.

In 1254, Béla IV of Hungary conquered Bosnia and Zachlumia. The turbulent times at the beginning of the 14th century spread across the entire country of Zahumlje. From 1304, Zachlumia was ruled by Mladen II Šubić, then again for a short period by a Serbian župan, and then became part of the medieval Bosnian state, acquired by Stjepan Kotromanić in 1325.

The usurpation by the Branivojević brothers, forced the people of Dubrovnik to fight them in 1326 with the help of Stjepan II Kotromanić. That year, Dubrovnik occupied Ston. The Dubrovnik people immediately began to build and establish a new Ston, to defend the Pelješac and protect the slaves from which they had earned big revenue. Since the conflict between the Bosnian Ban and the king of Zahumlje, Dubrovnik purchased Pelješac with Ston from both rulers in 1333, in return for paying the so-called tribute of Ston.

The first cathedral was that of St. Mary Magdalene in Gorica. The church of Our Lady of Lužina was built in the 10th century. The cathedral of St. Blaise was built in 1342 by decision of the Senate after Ston joined the Republic of Ragusa, on the site of the present damaged parish church. From then on, Ston was an integral part of the Republic until its fall, and was its second most important city.

In 1333, Dubrovnik began the planned construction of the fortresses of Ston () and Little Ston () on the present site. The cladding between the two towns along their entire length consisted of large walls which were supposed to defend Pelješac. This whole complex of fortifications, unique in Europe, was built in a short period of time.

The first Franciscan monastery in Ston was built in 1349; a female monastery was added in 1400. A Dominican convent was built in the nearby Broce in 1628.

The downfall of the Republic of Dubrovnik took place due to the sudden and often incomprehensible operations in the 19th century. The city walls of Little Ston were demolished to suppress malaria. The monumental stone fortification complex of Ston suddenly collapsed in preparation for the official visit by the Austrian Emperor, Franz Joseph - the stones became a quarry for nearby new outcrops and foundations. The restoration of the stone monuments and the reconstruction of the fortifications and the tower resumed only after 1945, however they were again damaged in the Croatian War of Independence (1991-1995), followed by the devastating earthquake of 1996. Recently, thanks to the Society of Friends of the Dubrovnik Walls, the stone forts and towers are being reconstructed, so that the monumental stonewall complex now begins to live again in its old dignity.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census, its population was 2,491, with 500 living in the town proper. In 2011 it was 2,407.

===Walls of Ston===

After the Republic of Dubrovnik acquired the Pelješac in 1334, it required the protection of Ston. First, in thirty years, one of the longest defense walls in Europe was erected on one side of the peninsula, and according to a unique project, two new towns were planned: southern Ston and northern Little Ston with the aim of encompassing people to preserve the boundaries and work in solanas the state had acquired. Between 1461 and 1464, the Florentine architect Michelozzo commissioned the building of the wall by the order of the Dubrovnik Republic. The Great Wall is 1200 m long, and was built to ensure protection from neighbours. The chronicles state that the construction of the wall lasted for 18 months and cost 12,000 ducats.

The fortress of Ston was one of the largest construction projects of the time, with an original length of 7000 m, consisting of the walls of Ston and Little Ston. The Great Wall consists of three fortresses, and the walls and fortresses are flanked by 10 rounds of 31 squares and 6 semi-circular bastions. The complex defense corps has been shaped over the course of four centuries, due to the development of weapons.

The walls were of great importance because they were defending the saltworks that gave 15,900 ducats every year to the Dubrovnik Republic, the shellfish farm and the city itself.

In 1667, about 0.5 km of walls were destroyed in a catastrophic earthquake, and the walls were significantly damaged in the earthquakes in 1979 and 1996.

In 2004, work on the restoration of obsolete walls was started, with the aim of facilitating visits to the area between Ston and Little Ston. It was assumed that the works would be completed by May 2008, but only the original part of the Ston Bridge was rebuilt. The reconstruction of the Great Wall in Ston, worth about five million kuna (€673,000), was completed, and it was announced that the stone walls with public entrance fee will be opened in May 2009. Part of the wall is open to the public since October 2009 for a fee. Until 2013, the original part of the city, the road have been restored. It takes 15 minutes to get to the first part, and 30 minutes to get from the Great to the Small Wall. Today the greater part of the walls have been restored.

<text>The Société d&#x27;énergie de la Baie James is the company in charge of building the hydroelectric development known as the James Bay Project in northern Quebec. It was established in December 1971 by the &quot;Société de développement de la Baie James&quot; (SDBJ), a Crown corporation of the province of Quebec and became a wholly owned subsididiary of Hydro-Québec in 1978.

== Origins ==
In the summer of 1971, the National Assembly of Quebec passed Bill 50, an Act establishing the Société de développement de la Baie James (SDBJ), a Crown corporation tasked with the development of natural resources as well as the general administration of the James Bay territory. The development of the hydroelectric potential was the focus of a newly created subsidiary (the SEBJ) with Hydro-Québec as a majority shareholder along with the SDBJ. Both corporations would be chaired by Pierre A. Nadeau, an insurance executive recruited by Robert Bourassa&#x27;s money man, Paul Desrochers.

The passage of Bill 50 was controversial with Hydro-Québec&#x27;s top executives, who felt the government tried to bypass the powerful utility. As the party picking up the bill, Hydro wanted control over the development of the hydroelectric project. Commissioner Robert A. Boyd, who was slated as the top Hydro-Québec executive and Nadeau&#x27;s right-hand man at the SEBJ, first declined the appointment, explaining that with no background in public works, Nadeau would have little credibility with the engineers running the operations. Conflict soon erupted between Hydro-Québec and Nadeau, who left less than a year after his appointment. He was replaced by Boyd, who kept informed of the latest development on the project by consulting with colleagues on the board on a daily basis.

<text>Scarp () is an uninhabited island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, west of Hushinish on Harris. Once inhabited, the island was the scene of unsuccessful experiments with rocket mail, since commemorated in two films.

==Geography==
Scarp has an area of , divided into 16 crofts. The majority of the land is rocky and uncultivated, and is dominated by two hills, of which the higher reaches . There is a small area of low-lying fertile land in the south-east corner of the island, and here, closest to Harris, is where the inhabitants of the island once lived. The population of Scarp peaked at 213 in 1881, and as recently as the 1940s it was reported to be over 100. The island was settled by eight farming families in 1810, and the population rose, following clearances on Harris, to over two hundred. This population could not be supported as there is little cultivatable land and no all-weather harbour, resulting in many families drifting away. Even in the 1950s the economy was still basic, relying on potatoes, cabbages, oats, turnips, milk, fish, and some lobster fishing. Scarp was one of several Scottish islands, including St Kilda and Handa, where all the men of the island would gather every morning in a so-called &quot;parliament&quot;, to agree the work to be done on that day. Such meetings would sometimes last for many hours, and on these occasions no work would be done, except by the women of the island.
Crofting was the way of life on the island, mainly comprising sheep and dairy cattle rearing and fishing, in latter years principally lobster fishing, which provided an income for around 12 families.

Islanders were deeply religious and a Church of Scotland Mission House was the focal point for Sunday worship and weekly prayer meetings.

The 1950s and 1960s saw a further decline in the island&#x27;s population. The closure of the primary school in 1967 and the post office in 1968 were final blows and by the time of the 1971 census the population had dwindled to 12. By the end of 1971, the last permanent inhabitants of Scarp had moved to Harris. However, a few houses on the island are still in occasional use as private holiday homes.

==Communication==
The island is reached by a short boat crossing across the Kyle of Scarp from Hushinish, but the sea here is very shallow and landing on Scarp can be difficult when there is a swell.

Scarp was the site of an experiment by German inventor Gerhard Zucker to deliver the island&#x27;s post by rocket mail. In July 1934 Zucker made two unsuccessful attempts at firing rocket mail between Scarp and Harris. Singed envelopes from the exploded rocket can still be seen at the island museum.

==Media and the arts==
A fictionalised account of the rocket mail experiment was used as the basis of the film, &quot;The Rocket Post&quot;, filmed on Harris and Taransay and directed by Stephen Whittaker, which was finally released in 2006. The film was originally intended to be filmed on location on Scarp but the owner later refused permission and location was moved to Taransay.

The artist Norman Adams bought a croft house on the island in 1963 with his wife Anna and two sons, and painted many of his well-known works there in his distinctive style over the next ten summers.

There are many references to the grave of Donald John MacLennan, who is buried at Scarp Burial Ground, in the book &quot;Not Forgotten&quot; (2006) by author Neil Oliver. Donald John died on 18 March 1917 when his ship struck a mine and was lost near Dunkirk during the First World War.

==Ownership==

Scarp was bought by a Panamanian company for £100 in 1978 as a speculation, sold in 1983 for £50,000 to Libco Ltd, then resold almost immediately to Orbitglen Ltd for £500,000. The last two deals were financed by the now-failed BCCI bank. Nazmudin Virani, a Ugandan businessman who was a director of BCCI, brokered the deals. Virani was jailed for fraud and when BCCI collapsed the property was resold in 1995 for £155,000 to Mr Anderson Duke Bakewell who is the current owner.

<text>Rāhu (Sanskrit: राहु, ) is one of the nine major celestial bodies (navagraha) in Hindu texts and the king of meteors. It represents the ascension of the Moon in its precessional orbit around the Earth, also referred as the north lunar node, and along with Ketu, is a &quot;shadow planet&quot; that causes eclipses. Despite having no physical existence, Rahu has been allocated the status of the planet by ancient seers owing to its strong influence in astrology.

Rahu is usually paired with Ketu, another shadow planet. The time of day considered to be under the influence of Rahu is called &quot;Rāhu kāla&quot; and is considered inauspicious.

As per Hindu astrology, Rahu and Ketu have an orbital cycle of 18 years and are always 180 degrees from each other orbitally (as well as in the birth charts). This coincides with the precessional orbit of the Moon or the ~18 year rotational cycle of the lunar ascending and descending nodes on the Earth&#x27;s ecliptic plane. This also corresponds to a saros, a period of approximately 223 synodic months (approximately 6585.3211 days, or 18 years, 11 days, 8 hours), that can be used to predict eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Rahu rules the zodiac sign of Aquarius together with Shani (traditional ruling planet).

Astronomically, Rahu and Ketu denote the points of intersection of the paths of the Sun and the Moon as they move on the celestial sphere. Therefore, Rahu and Ketu are respectively called the north and the south lunar nodes. Eclipses occur when the Sun and the Moon are at one of these points, giving rise to the understanding of swallowing of the Sun and the Moon by the snake. Rahu is responsible for causing the solar eclipse.

== Legends ==
=== Guruvansh sharma ===
Rahu is mentioned in the Puranic texts. The tales begin in the &quot;remotest periods of the earliest of time, when the devas and asuras churned the ocean of milk to extract from it the amrita, the elixir of immortality.&quot; Mohini, the female avatar of Vishnu, started distributing amrita to the devas. However, one of the asuras, Svarbhanu, sat in the row of devas and drank the amrita. Surya and Chandra noticed him and they informed Mohini; however, by that time, Svarbhanu had already become immortal. Vishnu, as Mohini, cut off Svarbhanu&#x27;s head with his discus, the Sudarshana Chakra. Svarbhanu, henceforth referred to as Rahu and Ketu, could not die, but his head was separated from his body; his head came to be known as Rahu, while his body came to be known as Ketu. Following this event, Rahu and Ketu gained the status of planets, and could influence the lives of humans on Earth. Rahu and Ketu became bitter enemies with Surya (Sun) and Chandra (Moon) for exposing his deception and leading to his decapitation. For this, Rahu pursues them and attempts to consume the Sun and Moon. Since Rahu is the head without the body, the Sun and Moon exit from his throat when he tries to swallow them. This recurring cycle creates the grahana, an eclipse of the Sun and the Moon, which represents the temporary revenge of Rahu.

=== Solar Eclipse and Atri&#x27;s sons ===
The Rig Veda mentions that during a solar eclipse, the sons of Atri were conflicted and succeeded to free Surya.

=== Jalandhara ===

Following his ascent to power, the asura Jalandhara was advised by the great sage Narada to seek out a consort. Narada hinted that the beautiful Parvati, consort of Shiva, would be an excellent choice. Infatuated with her beauty and impaired in his judgment, Jalandhara summoned his emissary Rahu, and sent him to the mountain Kailasa, to demand that Shiva give up his wife to Jalandhara. Rahu delivered the message informing Shiva that being a humble yogi who lived in the cremation grounds and the jungle as a naked ascetic, he was unworthy of the fairest goddess. He added that since Jalandhara was the powerful new lord of the heavens, the underworld, and the Earth, he was more worthy of her. Upon hearing these insults, Shiva produced a thunderous sound and a great lion-like monster from his brow named Kirtimukha. The monster chased and seized Rahu with the intention of devouring him. Rahu pleaded with Shiva for his life and retracted his claims, instead praising Shiva and seeking protection and refuge with him. In response, Shiva called off Kirtimukha’s attack and set Rahu free to relay these events back to Jalandhara.

=== Hanuman ===

When Hanuman was an infant, he was once left unattended by his earthly mother and father. He became hungry, and when the Sun rose, he believed it to be a ripe fruit. So, Hanuman leapt up towards the Sun with extreme speed. Vayu, the wind god and his celestial father, blew cold wind on him to protect him from the burning Sun. Coincidentally, Rahu was meant to swallow the Sun and eclipse it that day. As Rahu approached the Sun, he saw Hanuman about to eat it. Hanuman saw Rahu and thought Rahu to be a fruit as well, so he attempted to eat him too. Rahu fled to the court of the king of the devas, Indra, and complained that while he was meant to satisfy his hunger with the Sun, there was now a bigger Rahu who tried to consume the Sun and himself. Indra set out on Airavata, his divine elephant, to investigate alongside Rahu, who retreated once more when he saw how enormous Hanuman had grown. Hanuman was playing with the Sun&#x27;s chariot and reached for Rahu again. As Rahu cried out to Indra for help, Hanuman saw the Airavata and mistook it for yet another fruit. When he approached in his giant form, Indra struck his left jaw with a thunderbolt and injured him. Hanuman began falling back towards the Earth when he was caught by Vayu. Furious over his son&#x27;s injury, Vayu withdrew all the air from the universe until all the devas, the asuras, and men began to suffer and suffocate. They appealed to Brahma, who revealed the cause of their distress and accompanied them to the wind god in order to appease him. Brahma revived Hanuman, and the other deities took turns bestowing different blessings, boons, and powers upon him. 

=== Reincarnation during Mahabharata ===
During the events of Mahabharata, Rahu himself took incarnation as a king, Kratha. 

== Astrology ==
Since Rahu and Ketu are two opposite lunar nodes, they always appear in diametrically opposite houses in horoscopes. Both nodes are always in retrograde motion.

In Hindu astrology, Rahu represents materialism, mischief, fear, dissatisfaction, obsession and confusion. Rahu is also associated with science and occultism. Like Ketu, Rahu is also an enemy against the Sun and Moon. It is generally considered as a malefic planet in astrology.

Jyotisha is Hindu astrology, which entails the concepts of Nakshatra (see also List of Natchathara temples), Navagraha (see also List of Navagraha temples), and Saptarishi (included in the list of Hindu deities whose dedicated temples are found at various Hindu pilgrimage sites to which Hindus take yatra).

== Buddhist culture ==

Rāhu is mentioned explicitly in a pair of scriptures from the Samyutta Nikaya of the Pali Canon. In the Candima Sutta and the Suriya Sutta, Rahu attacks Surya, the Sun deity and Chandra, the Moon deity before being compelled to release them by their recitation of a brief stanza conveying their reverence for the Buddha. The Buddha responds by enjoining Rāhu to release them, which Rāhu does rather than have his &quot;head split into seven pieces&quot;. The verses recited by the two celestial deities and the Buddha have since been incorporated into Buddhist liturgy as protective verses recited by monks as prayers of protection.

<text>A constitutional court is a high court that deals primarily with constitutional law. Its main authority is to rule on whether laws that are challenged are in fact unconstitutional, i.e. whether they conflict with constitutionally established rules, rights, and freedoms, among other things.

== History ==
=== Before establishment of independent constitutional court ===

Prior to 1919, the United States, Canada and Australia had adopted the concept of judicial review by their courts, following shared principles of their similar common law legal systems, which they, in turn, had inherited from British colonial law. The Parthenopean Republic&#x27;s constitution of 1799, written by Mario Pagano, envisaged an organ of magistrates reviewing constitutional law, the &quot;eforato&quot;, but lasted only 6 months. The 1776 Constitution of Pennsylvania and 1777 Constitution of Vermont both establish a &quot;Council of Censors&quot; separate from the other branches of government, with the task of &quot;recommending to the legislature the repealing of such laws as appear to them to have been enacted contrary to the principles of the constitution,&quot; an institution somewhat similar to a modern constitutional court.

=== After establishment of independent constitutional court ===
In 1919 the First Austrian Republic established the first dedicated constitutional court, the Constitutional Court of Austria, which however existed in name only until 10 October 1920, when the country&#x27;s new constitution came into effect, upon which the court gained the power to review the laws of Austria&#x27;s federal states. The 1920 Constitution of Czechoslovakia, which came into effect on 2 February 1920, was the first to provide for a dedicated court for judicial review of parliamentary laws, but the court did not convene until November 1921. The organization and competences of both courts were influenced by constitutional theories of Hans Kelsen. Subsequently, this idea of having a separate special constitutional court that only heard cases concerning the constitutionality of the national legislature&#x27;s acts became known as the &quot;Austrian System&quot;, and it was subsequently adopted by many other countries e.g. Liechtenstein (1925), Greece (1927), Spain (1931), Germany (1949) etc.

== National Constitutional Courts ==

Following list consists countries with separate constitutional courts. Yet some other countries do not have separate constitutional courts, but instead delegate constitutional judicial authority to their ordinary court system, with the final decision-making power resting in the supreme ordinary court. Nonetheless, such courts are sometimes also called &quot;constitutional courts&quot;. For example, the Supreme Court of the United States has been called the world&#x27;s oldest constitutional court because it was one of the earliest courts in the world to invalidate a law as unconstitutional (&quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;), even though it is not a separate constitutional court, hearing as it does cases not touching on the Constitution.

=== Russia ===
Before 2020, several republics of Russia had their own constitutional courts, while in other federal subjects like &quot;oblasts&quot; and federal cities they were known as charter courts, as republics are the only federal subjects to have their own constitutions. Constitutional and charter courts were completely independent and were not subordinate courts to the Constitutional Court of Russia.

Constitutional and charter courts used to hear cases relating to conformity with regional constitutions or charters of laws adopted by regional legislatures and governors&#x27; decrees, and in this category of cases constitutional and charter courts were courts of single instance.

Constitutional and charter courts of the federal subjects were disestablished by the 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia.

As for 2020, constitutional courts remained in force in the 12 (out of 22) following republics:
*Adygea (known as the Constitutional Chamber of Adygea until 2000)
*Bashkortostan (see Constitutional Court of Bashkortostan)
*Chechnya
*Dagestan
*Ingushetia
*Kabardino-Balkaria
*Karelia
*Komi
*Mari El
*North Ossetia–Alania
*Sakha
*Tatarstan (see Constitutional Court of Tatarstan)

In the republics of Buryatia and Tuva, the constitutional courts were abolished by the republican constitutional laws in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In the republics of Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, and Sakha, the disestablished constitutional courts were transformed into constitutional councils, without any judicial powers.

Until 2020, charter courts existed in following federal subjects:
*Kaliningrad Oblast
*Saint Petersburg
*Sverdlovsk Oblast

The charter court of Chelyabinsk Oblast was disestablished in 2014.

<text>Lilith Sternin (formerly Sternin-Crane), M.D., Ph.D., Ed.D, A.P.A. is a fictional character on the American television sitcoms &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;, portrayed by Bebe Neuwirth. The character first appears as a date for Frasier Crane, though mutual hostility and discomfort causes the evening to end badly. Several months later, Lilith meets Frasier again and, with some help from Frasier&#x27;s ex-fiancée, Diane Chambers (Shelley Long), they start a romantic relationship, eventually living together, marrying, and having a son, Frederick.

In the final season of &quot;Cheers&quot;, Lilith has an affair with another man and leaves Frasier. The affair later unravels and Lilith returns, seeking reconciliation with Frasier. Although &quot;Cheers&quot; ends ambiguously with regard to Frasier and Lilith&#x27;s marriage, at the beginning of the spin-off series &quot;Frasier&quot;, their divorce has been finalized, with Lilith gaining custody of Frederick and remaining in Boston while Frasier has moved back to his hometown of Seattle. Lilith occasionally appears in &quot;Frasier&quot;, sometimes with Frederick.

==Role in &quot;Cheers&quot;==
Lilith debuts in the &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;Second Time Around&quot; (1986), as Frasier Crane&#x27;s (Kelsey Grammer) date; it does not go well, with Lilith walking out of the date with disdain at Cheers as a venue and Frasier&#x27;s activities. In &quot;Abnormal Psychology&quot; (1986), they feel mutual attraction again when he becomes accustomed to her makeover done by Diane Chambers (Shelley Long). At first reluctant to start over again, they then decide to go on another date. For years they live together, as first shown in &quot;Dinner at Eight-ish&quot; (1987). &quot;Our Hourly Bread&quot; (1988) reveals that they wed one month before the episode. In &quot;Smotherly Love&quot; (1992), they re-enact their wedding to please Lilith&#x27;s mother Betty (Marilyn Cooper), who was irritated that she had not been present for their marriage. In &quot;The Stork Brings a Crane&quot; (1989), Lilith gives birth to Frederick during the taxi ride home after false labor in the hospital.

The tenth-season &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;I&#x27;m Okay, You&#x27;re Defective&quot; (1991) features two plots: one subplot about Lilith pressuring Frasier to finalize his will and one main plot about Sam Malone&#x27;s (Ted Danson) concern that his sperm count may be low. The episode&#x27;s epilogue is described as &quot;Many years later&quot; with an elderly Lilith and adult Frederick (Rob Neukirch) sitting for the reading of Frasier&#x27;s will. The lawyer opens the sealed envelope and is surprised to find Sam&#x27;s sperm count report, which turns out stable. In response to the mix-up, Lilith bitterly remarks, &quot;That damn bar.&quot;

In the eleventh and final season (1992–93), in &quot;Teaching with the Enemy&quot; (1992), Lilith admits her affair with another man – Dr. Louis Pascal (Peter Vogt). In &quot;The Girl in the Plastic Bubble&quot; (1992), Lilith leaves Frasier, with him contemplating suicide until she promises to him that the marriage can be saved, to live with Pascal in Pascal&#x27;s experimental underground eco-pod. In &quot;Is There a Doctor in the Howe?&quot; (1993), a depressed Frasier almost has sex with Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) in their bed until Lilith unexpectedly returns. In the following episode, &quot;The Bar Manager, The Shrink, His Wife and Her Lover&quot; (1993), Lilith storms out of the room to go to Cheers, demanding the others tell her how long Frasier and Rebecca have been having an affair. The other characters have no idea as the affair has barely started that very evening. Lilith reveals that the eco-pod experiment with Pascal was a disaster – Pascal turned out to be claustrophobic, among other mental problems – and she abandons the project to return to Boston. Frasier and Rebecca, and eventually Pascal, converge on Cheers in pursuit of Lilith. Pascal, armed with a pistol, demands Lilith return to him, threatening to shoot Frasier and the others. Lilith demands that he shoot her first, which causes him to back down and surrender to police. Although Frasier initially refuses to take Lilith back, her pathetic sobbing wins him over, suggesting a reconciliation can occur.

==Role in &quot;Frasier&quot;==
In the spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;, Lilith and Frasier have divorced, and Frederick continually lives with Lilith in Boston after Frasier&#x27;s move to Seattle. In the opening scene of the 1993 pilot episode of &quot;Frasier&quot; (&quot;The Good Son&quot;), Frasier is hosting his call-in radio show and relates the following:

Six months ago, I was living in Boston. My wife had left me, which was very painful. Then she came back to me, which was excruciating. ...So I ended the marriage once and for all, packed up my things, and moved back here to my home town of Seattle.

Actress Bebe Neuwirth reprises the role of Lilith in several episodes of &quot;Frasier&quot;. In her debut &quot;Frasier&quot; episode, &quot;The Show Where Lilith Comes Back&quot; (1994), Lilith calls Frasier during his radio show, which surprises him, and mocks Frasier&#x27;s psychiatric advice to his callers, especially one who overeats and whom Lilith attempts to help. Later at his apartment, Lilith reminds him about their times together during marriage. They make love at one point, but end up regretting it, strongly indicating no chance of a lasting reconciliation. Throughout the series, Lilith reappears on occasion, often rekindling hers and Frasier&#x27;s lingering emotional bond, sometimes over concern about the future of Frederick (Trevor Einhorn), who also makes recurring appearances.

A running gag throughout &quot;Frasier&quot; is that Frasier&#x27;s father and brother, Martin Crane (John Mahoney) and Niles Crane (David Hyde Pierce), are never pleased to see Lilith. Martin finds her &quot;weird&quot; and usually shouts out in shock when he unexpectedly sees her in his and Frasier&#x27;s apartment. Niles resents her for mocking the vows at his wedding but forgives her when she apologizes. Lilith&#x27;s presence frightens Martin&#x27;s dog Eddie, terrifying the normally defiant dog into obedience. Martin&#x27;s live-in physical therapist, Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), who fancies herself as having minor psychic abilities, routinely suffers debilitating headaches when Lilith is in town, citing an evil spiritual presence.

Lilith marries her fiancé Brian (James Morrison), an MIT seismologist who appears in only one episode &quot;Adventures in Paradise, Part Two&quot; (1994). A later episode, &quot;Room Service&quot; (1998), reveals that Lilith is recently divorced from Brian after he came out of the closet. Niles, who a few episodes earlier had also just gotten divorced from Maris, ends up sleeping with Lilith after taking her home. However, the next morning, Frasier shows up and catches them. They end up having a three-way spar analyzing each other&#x27;s issues.

In &quot;Lilith Needs a Favor&quot; (2003), Lilith visits Frasier in Seattle, asking him to give her a sample of his sperm since she wants to give Freddy a sibling. However, as they arrive at the sperm bank, they both end up realizing that she really wanted to recapture Freddy&#x27;s childhood and call it off.

Her final &quot;Frasier&quot; episode is &quot;Guns &#x27;N Neuroses&quot; (2003), where Lilith&#x27;s colleague Nancy (Christine Dunford), sets Frasier up on a blind date with Lilith, having no idea of their mutual history. However, the two meet up for a drink while Lilith is in Seattle and, when it overruns, they both end up cancelling on the blind date (never learning they had been set up with each other). When the two are interrupted by a loud argument between a young married couple in the next room, Frasier and Lilith successfully resolve the couple&#x27;s dispute, then spend the night together watching television and finally falling asleep together on the couch. The next morning, they part ways as loving friends without restarting their romance.

Lilith returned in the 2023 edition of &quot;Frasier&quot;. Frasier and Lilith avoid each other in the wake of the former&#x27;s returning to Boston, only running into her by chance a few weeks later. In spite of their earlier détente, the pair immediately start sparring verbally, much to their son&#x27;s chagrin. They nonetheless attempt to share a place in Freddy&#x27;s life, but after passionately kissing on his bed, they agree to divide the holidays between them so that Freddy never has to deal with the two of them together.

==Creation and development==

A stereotypical &quot;intelligent ice queen&quot; Lilith Sternin first appeared in one single scene of a &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;Second Time Around&quot; (1986; season 4, episode 17), intended as a one-off character. However, she was brought back in the fifth season and became a recurring character thereafter. Over the years, like Diane Chambers, an educated Lilith is often mocked yet &quot;manages to put people in their place.&quot;

&quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot; writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs found the chemistry of Frasier and Lilith &quot;special&quot; enough to compare them with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy mixed with &quot;Prozac&quot; and to comfortably write stories about. Nevertheless, Neuwirth did not want to appear as a regular player, and left the role of Lilith on &quot;Cheers&quot;. Neuwirth&#x27;s career has since been focused on stage work. However, she made several guest appearances as Lilith in the spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;.

The &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;Wheels of Fortune&quot; (2002) reveals that Lilith has a half-brother, Blaine (Michael Keaton), whom Frasier despises due to Blaine&#x27;s relentless swindling.

== Reception ==
This role earned Neuwirth two Emmy Awards as an Outstanding Supporting Actress in 1990 and 1991.

According to an April 1–4, 1993, telephone survey of 1,011 people by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press (now Pew Research Center), before the &quot;Frasier&quot; premiere and the &quot;Cheers&quot; finale, Sam Malone (Ted Danson) was voted a favorite character by 26 percent, and Frasier Crane and Lilith Sternin were voted favorites by 1 percent each. In response to a question of spinning off a character, 15 percent of respondents voted Sam, 12 percent voted Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), 10 percent voted Norm Peterson (George Wendt), and 29 percent voted for no spin-offs. Only two percent of respondents voted for Frasier Crane to have his own show; his spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot; debuted in September 1993, to great subsequent success.

Bill Simmons, who at the time worked for ESPN, deemed Lilith Sternin one of his least favorite &quot;Cheers&quot; characters. Martha Nolan from &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Frasier and Lilith &quot;repressed&quot; when married together in &quot;Cheers&quot;. Josh Bell from &quot;About.com&quot; called Frasier and his ex-wife Lilith Sternin one of the &quot;best sitcom divorced couples&quot; of all time.

Steven H. Scheuer from &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot; considered Lilith&#x27;s significance to and marriage with Frasier &quot;fun&quot; to watch, especially when, in &quot;Severe Crane Damage&quot; (1990), she used comparisons between &quot;the duller good boy&quot; Frasier and &quot;the interesting bad boy&quot; Sam Malone as &quot;psychiatric examples of the good boy–bad boy syndrome&quot;. Faye Zuckerman and John Martin from &quot;The New York Times&quot; called their marriage in &quot;Cheers&quot; a hilariously &quot;[perfect mismatch]&quot;. Television critic Kevin McDonough from New York praised Kelsey Grammer and Bebe Neuwirth&#x27;s performances as &quot;repressed individuals&quot; and &quot;separate couple on TV&quot; with &quot;acidic and hilarious&quot; chemistry together.

<doc id="515649" wikidata="Q884349" url="?curid=515649" title="William Lee Knous">
<text>William Lee Knous (February 2, 1889 – December 12, 1959) was an American attorney serving as Chief Justice of the Colorado Supreme Court, the 31st Governor of Colorado and a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.

The National Governors Association states that he is the only person &quot;to have occupied the highest seat in the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of government&quot; in Colorado.

==Early life and education==
Born on February 2, 1889, in Ouray, Colorado, he was the son of John F. Knous of Pennsylvania Dutch descent. His mother, Julia Bain, was of Irish and Scottish ancestry. Both parents descended from men who fought in the Revolutionary War. In the early 1870s, John Knous moved from Iowa to Colorado, where he worked as a wagon boss and freighter that hauled supplies for the mining industry in Leadville. In Ouray, he drove a stagecoach between Ouray and Silverton. He also mined and prospected before becoming the town marshal and undersheriff.

As a boy, William Knous began a lifelong interest in fishing and hunting. He graduated from Ouray High School, where he was the class valedictorian. He began working in the mines because it paid well. He played semi-pro baseball and entered local boxing matches, from which he earned money for college. Knous received a Bachelor of Law degree with honors in 1911 from the University of Colorado Law School. He was admitted to the bar in Colorado in 1911.

==Career==

Knous entered private practice first in Ouray from 1911 to 1916, when he had fewer clients due to an economic downturn in the mining industry. He was a deputy district attorney for Ouray County, Colorado from 1913 to 1918, except a portion of one year from 1916 to 1917 when he wrote for legal publications in Rochester, New York. Realizing his preference to live in the Rocky Mountains, he returned to Colorado. He then worked with the Moynihan-Hughes-Knous law firm in Montrose, where he became a mining and irrigation legal expert. He was the Mayor of Montrose, Colorado from 1926 to 1930. He was a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from 1928 to 1930. A western conservative, he was interested in issues faced by cattle ranchers and water rights. While in Montrose, he was the Chamber of Commerce president and city attorney.

He was in private practice in Denver, Colorado to 1937. He was a member of the Colorado Senate from 1930 to 1936, serving as President pro Tem from 1935 to 1936. He was a justice of the Colorado Supreme Court from 1937 to 1947, serving as chief justice from 1946 to 1947. He helped solve a major oil workers&#x27; strike and other national issues when he served on the national War Labor Board during World War II.

He was the 31st Governor of Colorado from 1947 to 1950. Under his administration, a bill was enacted to combat specific diseases and public health units were established. Support was increased for workmen&#x27;s compensation and schools. The state system of accounts and controls was improved, and the general fund for the state increased to a significant surplus.

Knous was nominated by President Harry S. Truman on March 1, 1950, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Colorado vacated by Judge John Foster Symes. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 4, 1950, and received his commission on April 7, 1950. He served as Chief Judge from 1954 to 1959. His service terminated on December 12, 1959, due to his death.

==Personal life==
He eloped with Elsie Marie Grabow, a friend of his sister and a teacher, in 1916. They had three sons, all of whom fought in World War II.

* Robert Knous was a state senator and lieutenant governor of Colorado
* Merle Knous was a state district judge
* William Knous was a district attorney in Montrose

He died of a heart attack on December 12, 1959, and was buried at Fairmount Cemetery.

<text>Clifford C. Clavin, Jr. (born 1947 or 1949) is a fictional character on the American television show &quot;Cheers&quot; played by John Ratzenberger. A postal worker, he is the bar&#x27;s resident know-it-all. Cliff was not originally scripted in the series&#x27; pilot episode, &quot;Give Me a Ring Sometime&quot;, but the producers decided to add a know-it-all character and Ratzenberger helped flesh it out. The actor made guest appearances as Cliff on &quot;The Tortellis&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, &quot;Wings&quot;, and &quot;Frasier&quot;.

== Development ==

=== Creation ===
The original script for the 1982 pilot, &quot;Give Me a Ring Sometime&quot;, did not include Norm Peterson or Cliff Clavin. George Wendt and John Ratzenberger originally auditioned for a minor character, George, and George Wendt was hired for that role. George was Diane Chambers&#x27; first customer, had one line (consisting of the order, &quot;Beer!&quot;) and was intended for only one episode.

Since Wendt was cast as George (who evolved into Norm Peterson), Ratzenberger suggested to the producers that a know-it-all character should be added; this led to the creation of Cliff Clavin. Ratzenberger based his role on a police officer in his hometown of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Cliff was originally a security guard, but two days before the pilot&#x27;s filming he was changed to a postman; the producers thought a postman would be more knowledgeable than a security guard. Ratzenberger agreed to seven episodes of the first season, but his role expanded.
Stephen Tobolowsky told SplitSider.com that he had auditioned for Cliff.

===Other appearances===
On the &quot;Cheers&quot; 200th-episode special, host John McLaughlin asked Ratzenberger about Cliff Clavin. The actor replied that Cliff would describe himself as the &quot;wingnut that holds Western civilization together&quot;; however, Ratzenberger said he would describe Cliff simply as &quot;a winged nut&quot;. When McLaughlin asked Ratzenberger if there was any part of him in Cliff, the actor replied that although he was interested in fascinating facts, the only part of Cliff in him was that they both wear white socks.

Cliff appeared in 273 episodes of &quot;Cheers&quot; between 1982 and 1993. He also made guest appearances as an animated character (voiced by Ratzenberger) in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, in &quot;The Tortellis&quot; episode &quot;Frankie Comes to Dinner&quot;, in the &quot;Wings&quot; episode &quot;The Story of Joe&quot; and the &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;Cheerful Goodbyes&quot;.

In 2014, Ratzenberger reprised his role as Cliff in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial &quot;The &#x27;80s Called&quot;.

==Role==
Cliff is a postal worker, and Norm Peterson&#x27;s best friend. He lives with his mother, Esther Clavin (Frances Sternhagen)—first in his childhood two-story house (which was bulldozed in the sixth season&#x27;s &quot;The Last Angry Mailman&quot; after Esther sold it to a convenience-store builder), and then in a condominium (which first appears in the season 6 episode &quot;My Fair Clavin&quot;) with a sofabed. He is ridiculed by friends and enemies alike, including Carla (Rhea Perlman) and Norm, for his know-it-all attitude. He appears on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in the season-eight episode &quot;What Is... Cliff Clavin?&quot;, where he wins $22,000 in the first two rounds with questions that favor him, but loses it all with a wrong answer in Final Jeopardy (launching into a tirade which frightens host Alex Trebek). Cliff has a few relationships (mostly short-lived and hopeless) with women. He then has a relationship with fellow postal worker Margaret O&#x27;Keefe (Annie Golden) since &quot;Cheers&quot;″ seventh season (1988–89). When Margaret becomes pregnant with another man&#x27;s child in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Do Not Forsake Me O My Postman&quot;, Cliff stays by her side as the baby&#x27;s stepfather before Margaret returns to the child&#x27;s biological father.

In &quot;The Barstoolie&quot; (1985), Cliff meets his father, Cliff Clavin Sr. (Dick O&#x27;Neill), who left Cliff and his mother years earlier when Cliff was still a child. Cliff later realizes that his father is a fraudster and a fugitive from justice, and will run off again. Cliff does not want to turn his father in; Cliff Sr. disappears, leaving his son devastated.

In the 1993 series finale, Cliff finally receives a promotion. In &quot;The Show Where Sam Shows Up&quot; (1995), an episode of the &quot;Cheers&quot; spinoff &quot;Frasier&quot;, Sam (Ted Danson) tells Frasier that Cliff has not left home since he read an article about flesh-eating bacteria; however, Sam then discovers that Cliff is one of the other men with whom Sam&#x27;s fiancé Sheila (Téa Leoni) had had sex. In another &quot;Frasier&quot; episode, &quot;The Show Where Woody Shows Up&quot;, Woody tells Frasier that Cliff almost married a mail-order bride, but she decided to go back to Bosnia after spending a few days with him. In another &quot;Frasier&quot; episode, &quot;Cheerful Goodbyes&quot;, Cliff has his retirement party at the airport bar; he had planned to move to Florida, but decides to stay in Boston (to Carla&#x27;s dismay).

== Reception ==
On the &quot;NBC News&quot; website, Wendall Wittler called Cliff a &quot;classic&quot; character; however, Wittler found his friendship with Norm Peterson &quot;superficial&quot; and unworthy of comparison with the relationship between Ralph Kramden (Jackie Gleason) and Ed Norton (Art Carney) on &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;.

According to an April 1–4, 1993 telephone survey of 1,011 people by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press (now the Pew Research Center), Sam Malone was voted a &quot;favorite character&quot; by twenty-six percent of respondents and Cliff Clavin by two percent. Choosing a character for a spinoff, 15 percent voted for Sam Malone, 29 percent opposed a character spinoff, and less than 10 percent voted for Cliff.

Cliff&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in &quot;What Is... Cliff Clavin?&quot; received several reviews. In his book &quot;Hope&quot;, Andrew Razeghi described Cliff as a poster child for psychologist J. P. Guilford for a response to the Final Jeopardy! clue which Razeghi considered neither right nor wrong. Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk found the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; category topics during Cliff&#x27;s appearance (relating to the post office, beer, and other items fitting Cliff) a &quot;riot&quot;. In the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; fan community, Cliff&#x27;s losing $22,000 (won in two rounds) in Final Jeopardy! inspired &quot;Clavin&#x27;s rule&quot;, discouraging future contestants from attempting the same.

== Lawsuit ==
In 1993, Ratzenberger and Wendt sued Host International for copyright infringement, trademark infringement and violating the actors&#x27; personality rights. The company operated airport lounges styled similarly to &quot;Cheers&quot; which included two robots, one heavyset and the other a postal worker, which the actors claimed resembled Cliff Clavin and Norm Peterson. The lawsuit was declined at its first and second hearings. At the first, the judge ruled that the defendant did not violate copyright because Paramount Pictures had already granted it a license to produce &quot;Cheers&quot;-based bars. At the second, the judge ruled that the robots did not resemble the characters. In 1997, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed both rulings on the grounds that Paramount&#x27;s copyright claim might not have more weight than Ratzenberger and Wendt&#x27;s ownership of publicity and that the resemblance claim should be decided by a jury, not a judge. The case resulted in an undisclosed 2001 settlement by Host International.

<doc id="515653" wikidata="Q1274310" url="?curid=515653" title="Red-legged kittiwake">
<text>The red-legged kittiwake (Rissa brevirostris) is a seabird species in the gull family Laridae. It breeds in the Pribilof Islands, Bogoslof Island, and Buldir Island in the Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska, and the Commander Islands, Russia, and spends the winter at sea.

==Description==

The red-legged kittiwake is a very localised subarctic Pacific species. Apart from the distinguishing feature implicit in its name, it is very similar to its better-known relative, the black-legged kittiwake; other differences include the shorter bill, larger eyes, a larger, rounder head, and darker gray wings, and in the juveniles, which barely differ from the adults, lacking the black tail band and &quot;W&quot; across the wings of juvenile black-legged kittiwakes. Juveniles take three years to reach maturity. Adults are long, with an wingspan and a weight of .

Like the Pacific race of black-legged kittiwakes, the red-legged kittiwake has a well-developed hind toe. As occasional individual black-legged kittiwakes have reddish legs, any reports of red-legged away from the subarctic Pacific must record all of the other differences, not just the leg color, for acceptance by bird recording authorities.

==Behavior==
The red-legged kittiwake feeds on fish such as lanternfish (Myctophidae), squid, and invertebrates. It spends the summer at the cliff breeding colonies, nesting on ledges, and migrates out to sea in September to overwinter in the northwestern Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Alaska.

==Status==
This species is listed as &quot;vulnerable&quot; by the IUCN, as its population appears to be in decline. It has a global population in the region of 337,000 to 377,000 mature individuals and its breeding range is . Its numbers are thought to have decreased by about 35% between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s though numbers may have stabilized since. Why they have declined is unclear, but may be related to a change in the availability of prey, possibly associated excessive commercial fishing or climate change.

<text>Paramount Media Networks is the division of Paramount Global that oversees the operations of its television channels and online brands. The division was originally founded as MTV Networks in 1984, named after the MTV cable network. It would be known under this name until 2011; when it would be thereafter known as Viacom Media Networks until 2019; and ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks until 2022.

The division&#x27;s television assets are managed through three units: the MTV Entertainment Group, Showtime Networks, and the Nickelodeon Group, while also holding AwesomenessTV. Paramount&#x27;s international assets are overseen by Paramount International Networks.

==History==
=== Pre-launch: Warner Communications joint venture (1977–1984) ===
Warner Cable Communications was founded on December 1, 1977, by Warner Cable, itself a division of Warner Communications, to launch QUBE, an interactive cable television network. Seeing the potential in the creation of new cable networks, Warner Cable divested QUBE&#x27;s biggest brands, Star Channel, Pinwheel and Sight on Sound, into nationwide outlets. Star Channel began by satellite in January 1979 and was renamed The Movie Channel by the end of the year. The original Channel C-3, by then known as Pinwheel, became Nickelodeon in April 1979. As a result of these actions, Warner Cable Communications would then be rebranded as Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, becoming a joint venture between Warner Cable and American Express.

In 1980, Warner-Amex formed a joint venture with the now-defunct Cablevision&#x27;s Rainbow Media (now AMC Networks) division to launch Bravo, a cable network dedicated to arts and films, on December 1, 1980. Full control of the channel, however, was sold to Rainbow Media in 1984; NBC would acquire Bravo in 2003, and the channel is now currently owned by Comcast&#x27;s NBCUniversal.

On August 1, 1981, MTV debuted. In 1983, concerned by the strategic and financial failure of its pay-TV venture The Movie Channel (started to reap the benefits Time Inc. was having with HBO and Cinemax), WASEC established a joint venture with Viacom, merging TMC with their premium movie network Showtime to form Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc.; WASEC, however, had no operational involvement in the joint venture.

=== Launch as MTV Networks, Viacom gets full ownership (1984–2011) ===
On June 25, 1984, Warner Communications made the decision to divest Nickelodeon, MTV, and VH-1 (launched in 1985 over the channel space of Turner&#x27;s Cable Music Channel) into a new public corporation called MTV Networks. A year later, Warner would acquire the 50% stake from American Express.

On August 27, 1985, Warner sold 31% of MTV Networks to Viacom, with Warner also selling 19% of its Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc. joint to Viacom as well.

In November 1985, Viacom announced that it had plans to buy the remaining 69% of MTV Networks from Warner for $326 million, and the acquisition was completed on May 20, 1986.

In 1988, the company partnered with fellow Viacom subsidiary Viacom Enterprises to handle advertising sales of &quot;Superboy&quot;, a syndicated television series. The division was later evolved into One World Entertainment in the early 1990s, who partnered to launch a VH1 syndicated series.

In 2003, MTV Networks assumed full ownership of Comedy Central from AOL Time Warner.

On December 31, 2005, the remnants of MTV Networks and Showtime Networks were separated following Viacom&#x27;s split into two entities: CBS Corporation, which retained CBS, UPN, Simon &amp; Schuster and Showtime Networks (Showtime, The Movie Channel, and Flix), and a spun-off company under the Viacom name, which took ownership of Paramount Pictures, BET Networks and MTV Networks (Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, and VH1).

=== Expansion (2011–2019) ===
MTV Networks was renamed Viacom Media Networks in 2011. In the fall of 2012, media analysts began to report that ratings among some of Viacom&#x27;s leading brands in the U.S. were experiencing declines in viewership. MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon were of most concern to investors as the three account for roughly 50% of Viacom&#x27;s operating profit, estimated David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.

In 2017, Viacom announced a five-point restructuring plan, in which the company would pour most of its resources behind six &quot;flagship brands&quot;. These were MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr. Channel, BET, and Paramount Pictures. In February 2017, cable channels CMT and TV Land were moved from the Kids and Family Group to the Global Entertainment Group under Kevin Kay, joining up with Spike TV. During the same month, it was announced that Spike would be relaunched as Paramount Network in 2018, aligning with the namesake film studio and being positioned as Viacom&#x27;s main general entertainment outlet. BET Networks launched BET+ in September of 2017.

In October 2018, Kevin Kay was announced to be leaving his position as head of the Entertainment Group. CMT was transferred from the Entertainment Group to the Music Group under president Chris McCarthy, with his exit. Executive Kent Alterman would take charge of Paramount Network and TV Land to go with his current leadership of Comedy Central and Bellator MMA.

In 2019, after acquiring the free streaming service Pluto TV, Viacom would launch several channels on the service branded after its Media Networks and company–owned IP.

=== Reintroduction and re-merger with CBS (2019–2024) ===
In August 2019, Viacom announced that it would merge with CBS Corporation, reuniting the two entities under the ViacomCBS name. The merger closed on December 4, 2019. Announced on November 11, 2019, as part of the re–merger, the Media Networks division was renamed ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks, and reorganized.

MTV, VH1, CMT and Logo were reorganized into the &quot;Entertainment &amp; Youth Group&quot;, with the addition of Comedy Central, Paramount Network, Smithsonian Channel, and TV Land. BET Networks was merged with Showtime Networks under CEO David Nevins, who also temporarily gained oversight of Pop TV (formerly co-owned with Lionsgate); Pop TV was transferred to the Entertainment &amp; Youth Group on January 15, 2020. 

On February 16, 2022, ViacomCBS was renamed as Paramount Global, and ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks was renamed Paramount Media Networks. In 2022, MTV Entertainment Group partnered with Second Chance Studios to help formerly incarcerated individuals launch media careers. On May 9, 2023, Paramount restructured its U.S. domestic network business. 

Near the end of 2023, Paramount announced that the mobile apps for Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., MTV, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, and Showtime would cease operations at on January 31, 2024. The reason was to encourage users to sign up for Paramount+. The Nickelodeon Group shut down Noggin on July 2 of that same year for the same reason.

=== Paramount/Skydance merger (2024–present) ===

On April 29, 2024, President and CEO Bob Bakish was replaced by led by Brian Robbins, George Cheeks, and Chris McCarthy. This action was the result of Bakish&#x27;s reported opposition of the Skydance deal. McCarthy was legally designated the company&#x27;s &quot;interim principal executive officer&quot; in order to comply with SEC regulations stipulating that one person must conduct &quot;the normal course of business&quot;.

By July 2, 2024, Skydance renegotiated the deal and reached a preliminary agreement to acquire National Amusements and merge with Paramount. The deal was referred by National Amusements to Paramount&#x27;s special committee. Also, Paramount reportedly entered talks for a sale of the BET Media Group to buyers led by BET CEO Scott Mills for $1.6-$1.7 billion.

<text>Nephrosis is any of various forms of kidney disease (nephropathy). In an old and broad sense of the term, it is any nephropathy, but in current usage the term is usually restricted to a narrower sense of nephropathy without inflammation or neoplasia, in which sense it is distinguished from nephritis, which involves inflammation. It is also defined as any purely degenerative disease of the renal tubules. Nephrosis is characterized by a set of signs called the nephrotic syndrome. Nephrosis can be a primary disorder or can be secondary to another disorder. Nephrotic complications of another disorder can coexist with nephritic complications. In other words, nephrosis and nephritis can be pathophysiologically contradistinguished, but that does not mean that they cannot occur simultaneously. Types of nephrosis include amyloid nephrosis and osmotic nephrosis.

<doc id="515662" wikidata="Q2482106" url="?curid=515662" title="The Demon-Haunted World">
<text>The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark is a 1995 book by the astronomer and science communicator Carl Sagan. (Four of the 25 chapters were written with Ann Druyan). In it, Sagan aims to explain the scientific method to laypeople and to encourage people to learn critical and skeptical thinking. He explains methods to help distinguish between ideas that are considered valid science and those that can be considered pseudoscience. Sagan states that when new ideas are offered for consideration, they should be tested by means of skeptical thinking and should stand up to rigorous questioning.

==Themes==
Sagan explains that science is not just a body of knowledge, but is a way of thinking. Sagan shows how scientific thinking is both imaginative and disciplined, bringing humans to an understanding of how the universe is, rather than how they wish to perceive it. He says that science works much better than any other system because it has a &quot;built-in error-correcting machine&quot;. Superstition and pseudoscience get in the way of the ability of many laypersons to appreciate the beauty and benefits of science. Skeptical thinking allows people to construct, understand, reason, and recognize valid and invalid arguments. Wherever possible, there must be independent validation of the concepts whose truth should be proved. He states that reason and logic would succeed once the truth were known. Conclusions emerge from premises, and the acceptability of the premises should not be discounted or accepted because of bias.

===Dragon in my garage===

As an example of skeptical thinking, Sagan offers a story concerning a fire-breathing dragon who lives in his garage. When he persuades a rational, open-minded visitor to meet the dragon, the visitor remarks that they are unable to see the creature. Sagan replies that he &quot;neglected to mention that she&#x27;s an invisible dragon&quot;. The visitor suggests spreading flour on the floor so that the creature&#x27;s footprints might be seen, which Sagan says is a good idea, &quot;but this dragon floats in the air&quot;. When the visitor considers using an infrared camera to view the creature&#x27;s invisible fire, Sagan explains that her fire is heatless. He continues to counter every proposed physical test with a reason why the test will not work.

Sagan concludes by asking: &quot;Now what&#x27;s the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there&#x27;s no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists? Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true.&quot;

Continuing with concepts relevant to the &#x27;dragon in my garage&#x27; story, Sagan writes about a patient of John Mack who claimed to have scars on her body which were from encounters with aliens. Sagan writes that if the patient is asked what her scars look like, she is unable to show them because, unfortunately, they are located in the private areas of her body.

===Baloney detection kit===
Sagan presents a set of tools for skeptical thinking that he calls the &quot;baloney detection kit&quot;. Skeptical thinking consists both of constructing a reasoned argument and recognizing a fallacious or fraudulent one. In order to identify a fallacious argument, Sagan suggests employing such tools as independent confirmation of facts, debate, development of different hypotheses, quantification, the use of Occam&#x27;s razor, and the possibility of falsification. Sagan&#x27;s &quot;baloney detection kit&quot; also provides tools for detecting &quot;the most common fallacies of logic and rhetoric&quot;, such as argument from authority and statistics of small numbers. Through these tools, Sagan argues the benefits of a critical mind and the self-correcting nature of science can take place.

Sagan provides nine tools as the first part of this kit.

# There must be independent confirmation of the facts given when possible.
# Encourage debate on the evidence from all points of view.
# Realize that an argument from authority is not always reliable. Sagan supports this by telling us that &quot;authorities&quot; have made mistakes in the past and they will again in the future.
# Consider more than one hypothesis. Sagan adds to this by telling us that we must think of the argument from all angles and think all the ways it can be explained or disproved. The hypothesis that then still hasn&#x27;t been disproved has a much higher chance of being correct.
# Try to avoid clinging obdurately to your own hypothesis and so become biased. Sagan tells us to compare our own hypothesis with others to see if we can find reasons to reject our own hypothesis.
# Quantify. Sagan tells us that if whatever we are trying to explain has numerical value or quantitative data related to it, then we&#x27;ll be much more able to compete against other hypotheses.
# If there is a chain of argument, every link in that chain must be correct.
# The use of Occam&#x27;s razor, which says to choose the hypothesis that is simpler and requires the fewest assumptions.
# Ask if a given hypothesis can be falsified. Sagan tells us that if a hypothesis cannot be tested or falsified then it is not worth considering.
Sagan suggests that with the use of this &quot;baloney detection kit&quot; it is easier to critically think and find the truth.

====Logical fallacies====
There is a second part to the kit. This consists of twenty logical fallacies that one must not commit when offering up a new claim.

# &quot;Ad hominem&quot;. An arguer attacks the opposing arguer and not the actual argument.
# Argument from authority. Someone expects another to immediately believe that a person of authority or higher knowledge is correct.
# Argument from adverse consequences. Someone says that something must be done a certain way or else there will be adverse consequences.
# Appeal to ignorance. One argues a claim in that whatever has not been proved false must be true, and vice versa.
# Special pleading. An arguer responds to a deeply complex or rhetorical question or statement by, usually, saying &quot;oh you don&#x27;t understand how so and so works.&quot;
# Begging the question. An arguer assumes the answer and makes a claim such as, this happened because of that, or, this needs to happen in order for that to happen.
# Observational selection. Someone talks about how great something is by explaining all of the positive aspects of it while purposely not mentioning any of the negative aspects.
# Statistics of small numbers. Someone argues something by giving the statistics in small numbers, which isn&#x27;t very reliable.
# Misunderstanding of the nature of statistics. Someone misinterprets statistics given to them.
# Fallacy of inconsistency. An arguer is very inconsistent in their claims.
# &quot;Non sequitur&quot;. This is Latin for &quot;it doesn&#x27;t follow&quot;. A claim is made that doesn&#x27;t make much sense, such as &quot;Our nation will prevail because God is great.&quot;
# &quot;Post hoc ergo propter hoc&quot;. Latin for &quot;it happened after, so it was caused by&quot;. An arguer claims that something happened because of a past event when really it probably didn&#x27;t.
# Meaningless question. Someone asks a question that has no real meaning or doesn&#x27;t add to the argument at all.
# The excluded middle. An arguer only considers or mentions the two opposite extremes of the conversation and excludes the aspects in between the two extremes.
# Short-term vs. long-term. A subset of the excluded middle, but so important it was pulled it out for special attention.
# Slippery slope, related to excluded middle (e.g., If we allow abortion in the first weeks of pregnancy, it will be impossible to prevent the killing of a full-term infant. Or, conversely: If the state prohibits…).
# Confusion of correlation and causation. The latter causes the former.
# Straw man. Caricaturing a position to make it easier to attack. This is also a short-term/long-term fallacy.
# Suppressed evidence, or half-truth.
# Weasel word. Talleyrand said: &quot;An important art of politicians is to find new names for institutions which under old names have become odious to the public.&quot; 

Sagan provides a skeptical analysis of several examples of what he refers to as superstition, fraud, and pseudoscience such as witches, UFOs, ESP, and faith healing. He is critical of organized religion.

In a 2020 interview for &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, when Sagan&#x27;s wife Ann Druyan was asked about the origin of the phrase &quot;baloney detection kit&quot;, she said that

===Misuse of science===
Sagan indicates that science can be misused. Thus, he is highly critical of Edward Teller, the &quot;father of the hydrogen bomb&quot;, and Teller&#x27;s influence on politics, and contrasts his stance to that of Linus Pauling and other scientists who took moral positions.

Sagan also discusses the misuse of science in representation. He relates to the depiction of the mad scientist character in children&#x27;s TV shows and is critical of this occurrence. Sagan suggests an addition of scientific television programs, many of which would take a look at believed hoaxes of the past and encourage viewers to engage in critical thinking to better represent science on popular television.

====Misuse of psychiatric authority====
Sagan indicates that therapists can contribute to the growth of pseudoscience or the infusion of &quot;false stories&quot;. He is critical of John Mack and his support of abduction cases, which were represented in his patients.

Sagan writes about the story of Paul Ingram. Ingram&#x27;s daughter reported that her father had sexually abused her. He was told that &quot;sex offenders often repressed memories of their crimes.&quot; Ingram was eventually able to have a foggy visualization of the claimed events, and he suggested that perhaps &quot;a demon might be responsible.&quot; Sagan describes how once Ingram started remembering events, so did several other individuals and family members. A &quot;memory recovery&quot; technique was performed on Ingram, and he confessed to the crimes. A medical examination was done on his daughter, where none of the scars she described were actually found. Sagan writes that Ingram later tried to plead innocence once &quot;away from his daughters, his police colleagues, and his pastor.&quot;

====Hoaxes====
Hoaxes have played a valuable role in the history of science by revealing the flaws in our thinking and helping us advance our critical thinking skills. One of Sagan&#x27;s examples is the &quot;Carlos hoax&quot; by James Randi that revealed flaws in reporting by news media. Carlos was described as an ancient spirit that supposedly possessed José Alvarez and provided Alvarez with advanced knowledge about the universe. Many news outlets assumed this was true and reported it as such, which spread misinformation.

Sagan also cites crop circles as hoaxes.

==Reception and legacy==
The book was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. The contemporary skeptical movement considers it an important book. &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot; has been criticized (in &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine and &quot;The New York Times&quot;) for not incorporating certain information relevant to the items he discusses in his book. The &quot;Smithsonian&quot; article by Paul Trachtman argues that Sagan relates issues of government choices and declining scientific thinking skills to pseudoscience topics like astrology and faith healing but ignores other issues that may be causing governmental bodies and other individuals to turn away from science. One such issue is consequences of pouring governmental money into cancer research. Trachtman writes, &quot;it is not because of such beliefs that Congress now approaches the NIH budget with an ax. In fact, billions of dollars spent on years of research in the war on cancer have spawned growing professional bureaucracies and diminishing medical benefits.&quot; Trachtman argues that Sagan does not include problems like growing bureaucracies and diminishing medical benefits as reasons for a lack of scientific attention. In his review for &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times,&quot; James Gorman also argues for an unaddressed issue in Sagan&#x27;s book, saying Sagan fails to emphasize the idea that scientists should take a more active role in teaching science to the public, while he does mention the failures of the education system to do so.

The review in the &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine and a review by academic biologist Richard Lewontin in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; provide a range of opinions on Sagan&#x27;s attitude towards religious ideas. Per the &quot;New York Review&quot; article, &quot;when it comes to the Supreme Extraterrestrial he is rather circumspect.&quot; The &quot;Smithsonian&quot; article suggests Sagan was very clear about his religious beliefs in the book, for he &quot;splits his universe in two, into science and irrationality.&quot; The &quot;Smithsonian&quot; goes on to say that Sagan&#x27;s defined religious views fall within the area of an untestable claim, a type of claim he argues against in &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot;.

Lewontin&#x27;s review also claims that Sagan includes something in &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot; which he also is arguing against in that same text. The article mentions how Sagan discusses a natural predisposition people have towards science; but, the article says, &quot;He does not tell us how he used the scientific method to discover the &quot;embedded&quot; human proclivity for science.&quot; Sagan heavily discusses the importance of using the scientific method in his book, and this article claims he strays away from his own message by not including a description of his use of the scientific method on this topic.

A review by Lee Dembart in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was positive. It described Sagan&#x27;s book as &quot;a manifesto for clear thought&quot;, with the main issue being the length of eight chapters. Gorman&#x27;s review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; also criticised the length of the book.

The book has received a number of retrospective reviews. An article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, 2012, described the book as somewhat dated, though still insightful. Another article from &quot;The Verge&quot; in 2017 noted that a quote from the book regarding Sagan&#x27;s pessimistic prediction for a future America had gone viral on Twitter, which the article described as &quot;chillingly prescient&quot;. The article praised the book, stating that Sagan &quot;practiced the scientific skepticism and thinking that he preached, and that&#x27;s what helped him accurately analyze the trends of his time and forecast their eventual outcomes in ours.&quot;.

<text>Ernst Heinrich Wilhelm von Stephan (born Heinrich Stephan, January 7, 1831 – April 8, 1897) was a general post director for the German Empire who reorganized the German postal service. He was integral in the founding of the Universal Postal Union in 1874, and in 1877 introduced the telephone to Germany.

==Biography==
Stephan was born in Stolp (Słupsk), Pomerania, in the Kingdom of Prussia. He began his career as a local postal clerk in the service of the Prussian post in 1849. In 1866 he was put in charge by the Prussian government of federalizing the postal service that had long been privately run by the noble Thurn und Taxis family. In 1870 he was named director of postal services for the North German Confederation. Stephan&#x27;s career then moved quickly up the ranks, as he was named Postmaster General of the German Empire in 1876, the Undersecretary of State in charge of the post office in 1880, and the Minister of Postal Services for Germany in 1895.

When Stephan began his work as a postal worker, Germany was divided into 17 independent states, each with its own separate policies and fees. He worked early on to establish a uniform postage rate throughout Germany, to facilitate easier mailing. His general goal of standardization and internationalization is evident in his work to combine the postal service with the telegraph service in Germany, and in his efforts to organize the International Postal Conference in Bern in 1874, in which the Universal Postal Union was established. He introduced the postcard (which he had initially suggested in 1865) to Germany after Chancellor Otto von Bismarck promoted him in 1870: the postcard came into widespread use in the subsequent Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 as a method of communication between units in the field. He is also credited with having introduced the telephone to Germany.

Stephan died in 1897 in Berlin, having made a profound impact on the standardization of mail service worldwide. He was also actively engaged in cultivating purely Germanic terminology for the field of telecommunication and postal services. The German-speaking afterworld thus gained terms such as &quot;Fernsprechapparat&quot; (distance-speaking-device) for telephone, &quot;Wertzeichen&quot; (value-sign) for stamp, &quot;postlagernd&quot; (post-office-stored) for poste restante and &quot;Anschrift&quot; (towards-lettering, analogous to &quot;Ansprache&quot; or &quot;Anrede&quot; for addressing a person or a salutation) for address. The word creations mandated by von Stephan in the 1870s gained circulation at post offices and among its workforce, but many times the Greek or French original term was retained by German speakers. Thus at home people would say &quot;frankieren&quot; for putting stamps on a postcard or letter envelope (Briefumschlag) among themselves, but switch to &quot;freimachen&quot; (absolve from stamp-debt, thus permitting delivery) when at the post office. Or at home they would say &quot;Telefon&quot; in everyday speech, although the arcane official term was &quot;Fernsprecher&quot; (remote speaker) or Fernsprechapparat. His achievements in the field of postal services far outweigh this pedantic purism and it was his proposal to have the Siemens company manufacture telephones which led to the development of an entirely new business segment for the famous German company in 1878.

<text>A Wisconsin state park is an area of land in the U.S. state of Wisconsin preserved by the state for its natural, historic, or other resources. The state park system in Wisconsin includes both state parks and state recreation areas. Wisconsin currently has 51 state park units, covering more than in state parks and state recreation areas. Each unit was created by an act of the Wisconsin Legislature and is maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Division of Parks and Recreation. The Division of Forestry manages a further in Wisconsin&#x27;s state forests.

Several Wisconsin state parks contain resources that have been recognized on a national level. Chippewa Moraine State Recreation Area, Devil&#x27;s Lake State Park, and Interstate State Park are units of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve, while the Wyalusing Hardwood Forest in Wyalusing State Park is a National Natural Landmark. Two Wisconsin state parks contain National Historic Landmarks, both of which are Native American archaeological sites: Aztalan and Copper Culture. 15 state parks contain a total of 23 separate listings on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). These are the two previously mentioned National Historic Landmarks, plus Lake Farms Archaeological District at Capital Springs State Recreation Area, Copper Falls State Park, six individual buildings at Heritage Hill State Historical Park (Baird Law Office, Cotton House, Fort Howard Hospital, Fort Howard Officers&#x27; Quarters, Fort Howard Ward Building, and Tank Cottage), High Cliff Mounds at High Cliff State Park, the Seth Peterson Cottage in Mirror Lake State Park, the Raddatz Rockshelter at Natural Bridge State Park, Stonefield partially within Nelson Dewey State Park, Eagle Bluff Lighthouse in Peninsula State Park, the Roche-a-Cri Petroglyphs in Roche-a-Cri State Park, the shot tower in Tower Hill State Park, Whitefish Dunes-Bay View Site in Whitefish Dunes State Park, Wyalusing State Park Mounds Archaeological District in Wyalusing State Park, and four listings in Rock Island State Park: the Pottawatomie Lighthouse, Rock Island Historic District, Thordarson Estate Historic District, and a water tower.

== History ==
Wisconsin became the first state to have a state park in 1878 when it formed &quot;The State Park&quot;. The park consisted of in northern Wisconsin (most of present-day Vilas County). The state owned , which was less than 10% of the total area. There were few residents in the area. Lumber barons were powerful in the area, and they purchased 2/3 of the state&#x27;s land at $8 per acre. This defeated the purpose of the parks for it didn&#x27;t save the land from the ax.

In 1895, the state legislature created an act which authorized the state governor to examine some land in Polk County at the Dalles of the St. Croix River to become a state park. In 1899, the legislature approved the purchase of Interstate State Park and it was established on September 20, 1900. Architect John Nolen was hired in 1907 to draft a feasibility plan for a Wisconsin State Parks System and &quot;State Parks for Wisconsin&quot; was released later that year. The report was the guideline used to set up the state park system. It recommended the creation of four state parks: Dells of the Wisconsin River, Devil&#x27;s Lake, Door County&#x27;s Fish Creek (now Peninsula State Park) and the confluence of the Mississippi and Wisconsin Rivers (now Wyalusing State Park). Three became state parks, and the fourth became Dells Natural Area in 2005. A State Conservation Commission was formed in 1915 by combining the State Park Board, the State Board of Forestry, the Fisheries Commission, and the state Game Warden Department.

<doc id="515680" wikidata="Q2625600" url="?curid=515680" title="Good Morning, Miami">
<text>Good Morning, Miami is an American sitcom created by David Kohan and Max Mutchnick. The series ran on NBC from September 26, 2002, to December 18, 2003, and centered around the personal and professional life of Jake (Mark Feuerstein), the executive producer of an incredibly low-rated morning show in Miami, Florida. The series was one of the first on NBC to be fully originated in high definition.

The series was launched as a part of the network&#x27;s highly-rated &quot;Must See TV&quot; lineup, where it struggled in the ratings when compared to other sitcoms in the lineup, such as Kohan and Mutchnick&#x27;s own &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. Midway through the second season, NBC pulled the series after Kohan and Mutchnick sued the network. The series never returned, and the final nine episodes were ultimately left unaired. These episodes were later shown on TG4 in Ireland and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom.

==Synopsis==
Wunderkind producer Jake Silver decides to accept the job leading the lowest-rated morning show in Miami. He falls in love with the show&#x27;s beautiful, down-to-earth hairdresser, Dylan. The carnival of clowns at the station includes pompous and insulting on-air host Gavin; Jake&#x27;s sardonic assistant, Penny; and highly insecure station manager, Frank.

Early in the first season, Gavin&#x27;s morning co-host was Lucia, and Sister Brenda was the station&#x27;s nun/weather-girl. Eventually, Jake&#x27;s foul-mouthed grandmother, Claire, becomes the on-screen co-host. Both Lucia and Sister Brenda were written out early in the series as the producers were still searching for the &quot;center&quot; of their program.

During the second season, Jake and Dylan begin a relationship, even considering relocation to New York together. Victoria Hill, a new station boss, took over the show to get higher ratings, and Gavin struggled to warm up to her. Claire left the show and a new weather girl, Joni, was also introduced—much to Gavin&#x27;s dismay.

The series ended with Gavin and Penny deciding to start a relationship (as Penny is pregnant with his baby), Frank marrying Gavin&#x27;s mother as a publicity stunt, and Jake and Dylan agreeing to go their separate ways (Jake leaves the station and goes to produce at NBC in Manhattan, while Dylan returns to her home town of Omaha, Nebraska).

<text>In organic chemistry, a carbanion is an anion in which carbon is negatively charged.

Formally, a carbanion is the conjugate base of a carbon acid:

where B stands for the base. The carbanions formed from deprotonation of alkanes (at an sp3 carbon), alkenes (at an sp2 carbon), arenes (at an sp2 carbon), and alkynes (at an sp carbon) are known as alkyl, alkenyl (vinyl), aryl, and alkynyl (acetylide) anions, respectively.

Carbanions have a concentration of electron density at the negatively charged carbon, which, in most cases, reacts efficiently with a variety of electrophiles of varying strengths, including carbonyl groups, imines/iminium salts, halogenating reagents (e.g., &quot;N&quot;-bromosuccinimide and diiodine), and proton donors. A carbanion is one of several reactive intermediates in organic chemistry. In organic synthesis, organolithium reagents and Grignard reagents are commonly treated and referred to as &quot;carbanions.&quot; This is a convenient approximation, although these species are generally clusters or complexes containing highly polar, but still covalent bonds metal–carbon bonds (Mδ+–Cδ−) rather than true carbanions.

== Geometry ==
Absent π delocalization, the negative charge of a carbanion is localized in an sp&quot;x&quot; hybridized orbital on carbon as a lone pair. As a consequence, &quot;localized&quot; alkyl, alkenyl/aryl, and alkynyl carbanions assume trigonal pyramidal, bent, and linear geometries, respectively. By Bent&#x27;s rule, placement of the carbanionic lone pair electrons in an orbital with significant s character is favorable, accounting for the pyramidalized and bent geometries of alkyl and alkenyl carbanions, respectively. Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory makes similar predictions. This contrasts with carbocations, which have a preference for unoccupied nonbonding orbitals of pure atomic p character, leading to planar and linear geometries, respectively, for alkyl and alkenyl carbocations.

However, &quot;delocalized&quot; carbanions may deviate from these geometries. Instead of residing in a hybrid orbital, the carbanionic lone pair may instead occupy a p orbital (or an orbital of high p character). A p orbital has a more suitable shape and orientation to overlap with the neighboring π system, resulting in more effective charge delocalization. As a consequence, alkyl carbanions with neighboring conjugating groups (e.g., allylic anions, enolates, nitronates, etc.) are generally planar rather than pyramidized. Likewise, delocalized alkenyl carbanions sometimes favor a linear instead of bent geometry. More often, a bent geometry is still preferred for substituted alkenyl anions, though the linear geometry is only &quot;slightly&quot; less stable, resulting in facile equilibration between the (&quot;E&quot;) and (&quot;Z&quot;) isomers of the (bent) anion through a linear transition state. For instance, calculations indicate that the parent vinyl anion or ethylenide, , has an inversion barrier of , while allenyl anion or allenide, ), whose negative charge is stabilized by delocalization, has an inversion barrier of only , reflecting stabilization of the linear transition state by better π delocalization.

==Trends and occurrence==
Carbanions are typically nucleophilic and basic. The basicity and nucleophilicity of carbanions are determined by the substituents on carbon. These include
*the inductive effect. Electronegative atoms adjacent to the charge will stabilize the charge;
*the extent of conjugation of the anion. Resonance effects can stabilize the anion. This is especially true when the anion is stabilized as a result of aromaticity.

Geometry also affects the orbital hybridization of the charge-bearing carbanion. The greater the s-character of the charge-bearing atom, the more stable the anion.

Carbanions, especially ones derived from weak carbon acids that do not benefit sufficiently from the two stabilizing factors listed above, are generally oxygen- and water-sensitive to varying degrees. While some merely degrade and decompose over several weeks or months upon exposure to air, others may react vigorously and exothermically with air almost immediately to spontaneously ignite (pyrophoricity). Among commonly encountered carbanionic reagents in the laboratory, ionic salts of hydrogen cyanide (cyanides) are unusual in being indefinitely stable under dry air and hydrolyzing only very slowly in the presence of moisture.

Organometallic reagents like butyllithium (hexameric cluster, ) or methylmagnesium bromide (ether complex, ) are often referred to as &quot;carbanions,&quot; at least in a retrosynthetic sense. However, they are really clusters or complexes containing a polar covalent bond, though with electron density heavily polarized toward the carbon atom. The more electropositive the attached metal atom, the closer the behavior of the reagent is to that of a true carbanion.

In fact, true carbanions (i.e., a species not attached to a stabilizing covalently bound metal) without electron-withdrawing and/or conjugating substituents are not available in the condensed phase, and these species must be studied in the gas phase. For some time, it was not known whether simple alkyl anions could exist as free species; many theoretical studies predicted that even the methanide anion should be an unbound species (i.e., the electron affinity of was predicted to be negative). Such a species would decompose immediately by spontaneous ejection of an electron and would therefore be too fleeting to observe directly by mass spectrometry. However, in 1978, the methanide anion was unambiguously synthesized by subjecting ketene to an electric discharge, and the electron affinity (EA) of was determined by photoelectron spectroscopy to be +1.8 kcal/mol, making it a bound species, but just barely so. The structure of was found to be pyramidal (C3v) with an H−C−H angle of 108° and inversion barrier of 1.3 kcal/mol, while was determined to be planar (D3h point group).

Simple primary, secondary and tertiary sp3 carbanions (e.g., ethanide , isopropanide , and &quot;t&quot;-butanide were subsequently determined to be unbound species (the EAs of , , are −6, −7.4, −3.6 kcal/mol, respectively) indicating that α substitution is destabilizing. However, relatively modest stabilizing effects can render them bound. For example, cyclopropyl and cubyl anions are bound due to increased s character of the lone pair orbital, while neopentyl and phenethyl anions are also bound, as a result of negative hyperconjugation of the lone pair with the β-substituent (nC → σ*C–C). The same holds true for anions with benzylic and allylic stabilization. Gas-phase carbanions that are sp2 and sp hybridized are much more strongly stabilized and are often prepared directly by gas-phase deprotonation.

In the condensed phase only carbanions that are sufficiently stabilized by delocalization have been isolated as truly ionic species. In 1984, Olmstead and Power presented the lithium crown ether salt of the triphenylmethanide carbanion from triphenylmethane, &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium and 12-crown-4 (which forms a stable complex with lithium cations) at low temperatures:

Adding &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium to triphenylmethane (p&quot;K&quot;a in DMSO of = 30.6) in THF at low temperatures followed by 12-crown-4 results in a red solution and the salt complex [Li(12-crown-4)] precipitates at −20 °C. The central C–C bond lengths are 145 pm with the phenyl ring propellered at an average angle of 31.2°. This propeller shape is less pronounced with a tetramethylammonium counterion. A crystal structure for the analogous diphenylmethanide anion ([Li(12-crown-4)]), prepared form diphenylmethane (p&quot;K&quot;a in DMSO of = 32.3), was also obtained. However, the attempted isolation of a complex of the benzyl anion from toluene (p&quot;K&quot;a in DMSO of ≈ 43) was unsuccessful, due to rapid reaction of the formed anion with the THF solvent. The free benzyl anion has also been generated in the solution phase by pulse radiolysis of dibenzylmercury.

Early in 1904 and 1917, Schlenk prepared two red-colored salts, formulated as and , respectively, by metathesis of the corresponding organosodium reagent with tetramethylammonium chloride. Since tetramethylammonium cations cannot form a chemical bond to the carbanionic center, these species are believed to contain free carbanions. While the structure of the former was verified by X-ray crystallography almost a century later, the instability of the latter has so far precluded structural verification. The reaction of the putative &quot;&quot; with water was reported to liberate toluene and tetramethylammonium hydroxide and provides indirect evidence for the claimed formulation.

One tool for the detection of carbanions in solution is proton NMR. A spectrum of cyclopentadiene in DMSO shows four vinylic protons at 6.5 ppm and two methylene bridge protons at 3 ppm whereas the cyclopentadienyl anion has a single resonance at 5.50 ppm. The use of and NMR has provided structural and reactivity data for a variety of organolithium species.

==Carbon acids==
Any compound containing hydrogen can, in principle, undergo deprotonation to form its conjugate base. A compound is a carbon acid if deprotonation results in loss of a proton from a carbon atom. Compared to compounds typically considered to be acids (e.g., mineral acids like nitric acid, or carboxylic acids like acetic acid), carbon acids are typically many orders of magnitude weaker, although exceptions exist (see below). For example, benzene is not an acid in the classical Arrhenius sense, since its aqueous solutions are neutral. Nevertheless, it is very weak Brønsted acid with an estimated p&quot;K&quot;a of 49 which may undergo deprotonation in the presence of a superbase like the Lochmann–Schlosser base (&quot;n&quot;-butyllithium and potassium &quot;t&quot;-butoxide). As conjugate acid–base pairs, the factors that determine the relative stability of carbanions also determine the ordering of the p&quot;K&quot;a values of the corresponding carbon acids. Furthermore, p&quot;K&quot;a values allow the prediction of whether a proton transfer process will be thermodynamically favorable: In order for the deprotonation of an acidic species HA with base to be thermodynamically favorable (&quot;K&quot; &gt; 1), the relationship p&quot;K&quot;a(BH) &gt; p&quot;K&quot;a(AH) must hold.

These values below are p&quot;K&quot;a values determined in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which has a broader useful range (~0 to ~35) than values determined in water (~0 to ~14) and better reflect the basicity of the carbanions in typical organic solvents. Values below less than 0 or greater than 35 are indirectly estimated; hence, the numerical accuracy of these values is limited. Aqueous p&quot;K&quot;a values are also commonly encountered in the literature, particularly in the context of biochemistry and enzymology. Moreover, aqueous values are often given in introductory organic chemistry textbooks for pedagogical reasons, although the issue of solvent dependence is often glossed over. In general, p&quot;K&quot;a values in water and organic solvent diverge significantly when the anion is capable of hydrogen bonding. For instance, in the case of water, the values differ dramatically: the p&quot;K&quot;a in water of water is 14.0, while the p&quot;K&quot;a in DMSO of water is 31.4, reflecting the differing ability of water and DMSO to stabilize the hydroxide anion. On the other hand, for cyclopentadiene, the numerical values are comparable: the p&quot;K&quot;a in water is 15, while the p&quot;K&quot;a in DMSO is 18.
::
As indicated by the examples above, acidity increases (p&quot;K&quot;a decreases) when the negative charge is delocalized. This effect occurs when the substituents on the carbanion are unsaturated and/or electronegative. Although carbon acids are generally thought of as acids that are much weaker than &quot;classical&quot; Brønsted acids like acetic acid or phenol, the cumulative (additive) effect of several electron accepting substituents can lead to acids that are as strong or stronger than the inorganic mineral acids. For example, trinitromethane , tricyanomethane , pentacyanocyclopentadiene , and fulminic acid HCNO, are all strong acids with aqueous p&quot;K&quot;a values that indicate complete or nearly complete proton transfer to water. Triflidic acid, with three strongly electron-withdrawing triflyl groups, has an estimated p&quot;K&quot;a well below −10. On the other end of the scale, hydrocarbons bearing only alkyl groups are thought to have p&quot;K&quot;a values in the range of 55 to 65. The range of acid dissociation constants for carbon acids thus spans over 70 orders of magnitude.

The acidity of the α-hydrogen in carbonyl compounds enables these compounds to participate in synthetically important C–C bond-forming reactions including the aldol reaction and Michael addition.

==Chiral carbanions==
With the molecular geometry for a carbanion described as a trigonal pyramid the question is whether or not carbanions can display chirality, because if the activation barrier for inversion of this geometry is too low any attempt at introducing chirality will end in racemization, similar to the nitrogen inversion. However, solid evidence exists that carbanions can indeed be chiral for example in research carried out with certain organolithium compounds.

The first ever evidence for the existence of chiral organolithium compounds was obtained in 1950. Reaction of chiral 2-iodooctane with &quot;s&quot;-butyllithium in petroleum ether at −70 °C followed by reaction with dry ice yielded mostly racemic 2-methylbutyric acid but also an amount of optically active 2-methyloctanoic acid, which could only have formed from likewise optically active 2-methylheptyllithium with the carbon atom linked to lithium the carbanion:

On heating the reaction to 0 °C the optical activity is lost. More evidence followed in the 1960s. A reaction of the &quot;cis&quot; isomer of 2-methylcyclopropyl bromide with &quot;s&quot;-butyllithium again followed by carboxylation with dry ice yielded &quot;cis&quot;-2-methylcyclopropylcarboxylic acid. The formation of the &quot;trans&quot; isomer would have indicated that the intermediate carbanion was unstable.

In the same manner the reaction of (+)-(&quot;S&quot;)-&quot;l&quot;-bromo-&quot;l&quot;-methyl-2,2-diphenylcyclopropane with &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium followed by quenching with methanol resulted in product with retention of configuration:

Of recent date are chiral methyllithium compounds:

The phosphate 1 contains a chiral group with a hydrogen and a deuterium substituent. The stannyl group is replaced by lithium to intermediate 2 which undergoes a phosphate–phosphorane rearrangement to phosphorane 3 which on reaction with acetic acid gives alcohol 4. Once again in the range of −78 °C to 0 °C the chirality is preserved in this reaction sequence. (Enantioselectivity was determined by NMR spectroscopy after derivatization with Mosher&#x27;s acid.)

==History==
A carbanionic structure first made an appearance in the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation as correctly proposed by Clarke and Arthur Lapworth in 1907. In 1904 Wilhelm Schlenk prepared in a quest for tetramethylammonium (from tetramethylammonium chloride and 
) and in 1914 he demonstrated how triarylmethyl radicals could be reduced to carbanions by alkali metals The phrase carbanion was introduced by Wallis and Adams in 1933 as the negatively charged counterpart of the carbonium ion

<text>Lara Sophie Katy Crokaert (; born 9 January 1970), known professionally as Lara Fabian (, , ), is a Belgian, Italian and Canadian singer and songwriter. She has sold over 20 million records worldwide and is one of the best-selling Belgian artists of all time.

Born in Belgium to a Belgian father and an Italian mother, she moved to Quebec in 1991 and, since 1995, has held Canadian citizenship alongside her Belgian one. In 2003, she returned to Brussels to be close to her parents in Belgium, and in 2015, she lived in Walloon Brabant province in Belgium, just outside Brussels. In 2017, she returned permanently to Montreal, Quebec, to be with her family.

== Early life ==
Fabian was born in Etterbeek, Brussels, the only child of Pierre Crokaert, a Fleming, and Maria Luisa Serio, a Sicilian. She was raised between the Italian city of Catania and the Belgian town of Ruisbroek, speaking Italian as her first language. Fabian&#x27;s parents recognized her talent early on and enrolled her in the Royal Conservatory of Brussels when she was eight years old; she studied there for 10 years.

== Career ==
=== 1986–1993: Early music career ===

During the 1980s, Fabian entered a number of European competitions and won several prizes. She released her first single, &quot;L&#x27;Aziza est en pleurs&quot; / &quot;Il y avait,&quot; in 1986.

In 1988, the RTL TV channel in Luxembourg invited Fabian to represent the country at the 33rd Eurovision Song Contest, held that year in Dublin, Ireland. The song was a composition by Jacques Cardona and Alain Garcia entitled &quot;Croire&quot; (Believe), which reached a respectable fourth place (while Celine Dion won the contest representing Switzerland). The single became a hit in Europe, selling nearly 500,000 copies.

In 1990, Fabian and musical collaborator Rick Allison moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to embark on a career in North America. They started their own music label and publishing company, Productions Clandestines.

In August 1991, her self-titled French-language debut album, &quot;Lara Fabian&quot;, was released in Canada and sold over 100,000 copies. The success of upbeat dance-pop singles such as &quot;Le jour où tu partiras&quot;, &quot;Les murs&quot;, and &quot;Qui pense à l&#x27;amour&quot; gave Fabian radio exposure. She received several nominations at the 1993 &quot;ADISQ Awards&quot;, and a poll published around that time voted her Québec&#x27;s most promising singer.

=== 1994–1996: Breakthrough album: &quot;Carpe diem&quot; ===

Constant touring in Québec helped Fabian&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Carpe diem&quot; become her breakthrough album. The album went gold three weeks after its release, and spawned three hit singles: &quot;Tu t&#x27;en vas&quot;, &quot;Si tu m&#x27;aimes&quot;, and &quot;Leïla&quot;. The following year, the album went double platinum.

Fabian received two Félix Awards at the 1995 ADISQ gala: Best Show of The Year and Best Female Singer of The Year (a category that is voted for by the public).

In 1996, Walt Disney Studios hired Fabian as the voice of the character of Esmeralda in the Canadian French version of the animated feature &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. Disney also included &quot;Que Dieu aide les exclus&quot;, Fabian&#x27;s French version of the song &quot;God Help The Outcasts&quot;, on the film&#x27;s English soundtrack album alongside Bette Midler&#x27;s version.

Since 1996, Lara Fabian has also held Canadian citizenship alongside her original Belgian passport.

=== 1997–1999: Mainstream international success: &quot;Pure&quot; and &quot;Live&quot; ===

After the success of &quot;Carpe diem&quot;, Fabian signed a contract with the French Polydor label for several albums and &quot;Pure&quot; was released in June 1997. &quot;Pure&quot; sold more than two million copies in France; the album went platinum in less than two weeks, and spawned several hit singles: &quot;Tout&quot;, &quot;Je t&#x27;aime&quot;, &quot;Humana&quot;, &quot;Si tu m&#x27;aimes&quot;, and the anti-homophobia anthem &quot;La Différence&quot;. The album won a Félix Award for Popular Album of the Year at the 1997 ADISQ gala and was nominated for two Juno Awards in the Best Selling French Album category, and for Fabian as Best Female Singer.

In February 1998, Fabian received the Discovery of the Year award during the Victoires de la Musique Gala. Also in 1998, Polydor released &quot;Carpe diem&quot; in Europe. In November 1998, she received the Félix Award for Artist with the Most Recognition Outside Quebec at the &#x27;ADISQ Gala&#x27;. In December, she was named as Revelation of the Year by Paris Match, which put her on its cover to mark this occasion.

In March 1999, Fabian released her first live album, named &quot;Live&quot;, which debuted at 1 on the French charts. This helped seal an international recording contract with Sony Music. In May 1999, Fabian was honoured at the &quot;World Music Awards&quot; in Monaco as the best-selling Benelux artist. In July 1999, with over six million records already sold across Europe, Polydor rereleased Fabian&#x27;s self-titled debut album.

=== 1999–2001: Extension of success to the US and Latin America: &quot;Lara Fabian&quot; ===

In the summer of 1999, Fabian recorded her first English-language album, &quot;Lara Fabian&quot;, in New York and San Francisco for the Sony label. The songs were written and produced with Rick Allison and Dave Pickell, Walter Afanasieff, Glen Ballard and Patrick Leonard.

The album debuted at No.1 on the Billboard &#x27;Heatseekers&#x27; album chart, reached No.1 on the French album chart, and was No.2 on the Belgian album chart. For the Asian version of the album, Fabian collaborated with American-Taiwanese pop star Leehom Wang on the song &quot;Light of My Life&quot;.

The dance-pop song &quot;I Will Love Again&quot;, her first English single, reached No.1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play, and peaked No.32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No.10 Adult Contemporary, as well as appearing in several international charts. This included the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at No.63. The follow-up ballad, &quot;Love By Grace&quot;, entered the Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at No.24. In February 2001, &quot;Love By Grace&quot; became the theme song of the lead couple in the Brazilian soap opera &quot;Laços de Família&quot;, broadcast by Rede Globo in Brazil and Portugal. For several weeks, the song was number 1 on most Brazilian and Portuguese radio stations. The third single, the dance-pop song &quot;I Am Who I Am&quot;, remixed by Hex Hector, did not chart. In Europe, the single &quot;Adagio&quot; charted at No.5 on the French singles chart and No.3 on the Belgian singles chart.

During this period, Fabian recorded songs for several Hollywood motion picture soundtracks, including &quot;The Dream Within&quot; for the &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; soundtrack, and &quot;For Always&quot; for the &quot;AI:Artificial Intelligence&quot; soundtrack, which contained both a solo version and a duet with Josh Groban.

=== 2001–2003: &quot;O Canada 2001&quot; and return to French roots: &quot;Nue&quot;, &quot;Live 2002&quot; and &quot;En toute intimité&quot; ===

&quot;Nue&quot; (Naked), Fabian&#x27;s fourth French album, was released in the Fall of 2001 in both Québec and France. &quot;Nue&quot; is a documentation of her emotional ride in the years since success of the previous album. The album reached No.1 in Belgium and No.2 in France but had little impact in Québec. The album was also released in Portugal and reached the top 10 on the album charts during the Fall of 2001.

The first single, released in the summer of 2001, was the anthem &quot;J&#x27;y crois encore,&quot; which was a top 20 French hit. Other singles followed, including &quot;Immortelle&quot;, &quot;Aimer Déjà,&quot; and in 2002 &quot;Tu es mon autre&quot; (a duet with fellow Belgian, Maurane, which was nominated for song of the year and reached the top 5 in France).

Also in 2001, she collaborated with David Foster and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra to record the Canadian national anthem, &quot;O Canada&quot;, in an English version, a French version, and a bilingual (French/English) version, for a promotion of the Government of Canada.

In 2002, Fabian contributed to the &quot;World Soccer Championship&quot; CD release, with the song &quot;World at Your Feet&quot; written and produced by Gary Barlow.

Towards the end of 2002, Fabian released her second live album, &quot;Live 2002&quot;, from her latest tour, together with a DVD showcasing concerts recorded in December 2001 in Belgium at the Forest National and at Le Zénith in Paris.

Her 2003 stint at the Casino de Paris every Monday night consisted of concerts to small audiences, which were released as a live CD and DVD at the end of 2003, under the title &quot;En toute intimité&quot;.

=== 2004: Second English language release: &quot;A Wonderful Life&quot; ===

In June 2004, Fabian released her second English album, &quot;A Wonderful Life&quot;.

The project was commercially unsuccessful but critically praised. The more organic sound on the album is attributed to the work of French guitarist Jean-Félix Lalanne, and producers Desmond Child, Anders Bagge and the British team True North (composed of Take That singer Gary Barlow and Elliot John Kennedy). &quot;Review My Kisses&quot;, written by Desmond Child, was first recorded by LeAnn Rimes in 2002 for her album &quot;Twisted Angel&quot;.

The first single released for radio was &quot;The Last Goodbye&quot; in the US and a number of other countries (except France). In France, the song &quot;No Big Deal&quot; was the first single. Neither of the songs achieved success and the album was not promoted; and its release was cancelled in the United States.

In Brazil, the song &quot;I Guess I Loved You&quot; achieved moderate success when included on a soap opera entitled &quot;Senhora do Destino&quot; (Her own Destiny), a well-known Brazilian television series. The song also gained some popularity in Portugal, for the same reason, though it was never officially released or promoted.

In 2004, in the MGM film &quot;De-Lovely&quot;, Fabian performed the numbers &quot;Another Openin&#x27;, Another Show&quot; (with chorus) and &quot;So in Love&quot; (with Mario Frangoulis) from the Cole Porter musical &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;.

=== 2005–2006: A new musical direction: &quot;9&quot; and &quot;Un Regard 9&quot; ===

After a sabbatical in 2004, Fabian returned to the music scene spring of 2005 with her fifth French album, &quot;9&quot;. The album is performed in a new style, with smoothness, serenity and joy, a departure from the deep, dramatic style of earlier recordings.

&quot;9&quot; yielded the hit single &quot;La Lettre&quot;, a song co-written with her new partner, Jean-Félix Lalanne, with whom she produced the album&#x27;s 11 tracks. Other singles released included &quot;Ne lui parlez plus d&#x27;elle&quot;, &quot;Un Ave Maria&quot;, &quot;Il ne manquait que toi&quot; and the gospel-infused &quot;L&#x27;homme qui n&#x27;avait pas de maison&quot;.

In October 2006, Fabian released a CD and DVD of this associated tour, both titled &quot;Un regard 9 Live&quot; and recorded during the concert of 29 March 2006, at Le Zénith in Paris. The CD presents 15 live performances and a new song, &quot;Aime&quot;, recorded in a studio in Montreal, Quebec.

=== 2006–2007: An Italian collaboration and live concerts in Europe ===
In June 2007 Fabian worked in Rome and Los Angeles to record tracks for her next studio album.

In the meantime, the single &quot;Un cuore malato &quot; (with Gigi D&#x27;Alessio) reached the top of the Italian charts and No.16 in France.

In Los Angeles, Fabian worked with Dave Stewart on a multilingual album, reputed to include songs in English, Spanish, French, Italian, and a few other languages. This album was planned for release in late 2008.

Also in 2007, Fabian was in Québec to perform a two-night concert at the Olympia de Montreal. In October she was a surprise guest at a concert Gigi D&#x27;Alessio gave in France at the Olympia in Paris. Soon after, her daughter was born.

=== 2009: Return to the music scene: &quot;Toutes les femmes en moi&quot; ===

A few months after her daughter&#x27;s birth, Fabian carried out a tour of Ukraine, Russia and Greece. She also made a few TV appearances (such as 60th Anniversary of Israel where Fabian performed a Hebrew song and duetted with Israeli singer Noa).

During 2008, Fabian was in Belgium preparing to record a French album with pianist Mark Herskowitz. The album, &quot;Toutes les femmes en moi&quot;, was partly recorded in Montreal, and was released in May 2009. The first single, Soleil, Soleil, is a cover of the Nana Mouskouri song. The second single was &quot;Toutes les Femmes en moi&quot;, the only original song on the album.

=== 2010: &quot;Tour Les Femmes Font Leur Show&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle Zhivago&quot; ===

Throughout the first half of 2010, Fabian embarked on a European tour of concerts, throughout France, Switzerland, and Belgium, incorporating the main repertoire of her last album &quot;Toutes Les Femmes En Moi&quot; along with some classic and fan favorites. She also performed again in Eastern Europe, with a more acoustic set (piano-voice), and included English recordings from the album &quot;Every Woman in Me&quot;.
In September 2010, she finally released her 2009 album &quot;Toutes Les Femmes En Moi&quot; in Québec. She also recorded the album &quot;Nuit Magique&quot; with Canadian singer Coral Egan.

Later in 2010, Fabian released a concept album in Russia and Ukraine called &quot;Mademoiselle Zhivago&quot; which achieved success in Russia. It features 11 songs in different languages by Russian composer Igor Krutoy. It features stories about a woman who experiences several lives over the years and centuries. Eleven music videos, one each song, were combined to create a full-length film, produced and directed by Ukrainian film producer Alan Badoev. The album itself, containing a CD and a DVD, was first released in Ukraine in October 2010 and in Russia in November.

The whole set of songs composed by Fabian with Igor Krutoy is in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Russian. She first introduced one of these songs in 2009 during the New Wave Festival in Latvia, performing &quot;Demain n&#x27;existe pas&quot;. Later, in 2010, she returned to that same stage, performing new songs from the already finalized project. She has been promoting this project in both countries both on television and by performing a series of concerts presenting the new songs live to the eastern European public. Fabian was a guest performer on the show of 30 October of the Ukrainian X Factor, singing &quot;Mademoiselle Hyde&quot; and &quot;Demain n&#x27;existe pas&quot;, taken from the album and also her longtime classic &quot;Adagio&quot;.

In 2012, she sang &quot;Ma solitude&quot;, a duet with Greek singer George Perris, on his album &quot;Un Souhait&quot;.

=== 2013: &quot;Le Secret&quot; ===
Fabian released her new album &quot;Le Secret&quot; on 15 April 2013, which consists of 17 brand new songs. On the same day of the album release, she showcased her new songs at the Théâtre de Paris. Her first single is &quot;Deux ils, Deux elles&quot;, released 20 February 2013. The song talks about the love between two men and two women, speaks about tolerance and acceptance of the LGBT community – just like her previous song &quot;La Différence&quot;.

=== 2014: &quot;Make Me Yours Tonight&quot; / &quot;Al Götür Beni&quot; ===
Planned tour dates in early 2014 were cancelled and recording delayed while Fabian recovered from ear damage. In August she released a duet with Turkish Artist Mustafa Ceceli. The title, &quot;Make Me Yours Tonight,&quot; written by Anthony James and Yiorgos Bellapaisiotis, was released as an EP in English and Turkish versions (&quot;Al Götür Beni&quot;), as well as in additional &quot;acoustic&quot; versions.

=== 2015: Performer at the 65th Sanremo, &quot;Essential Lara Fabian&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits Tour 2015&quot; ===
On 14 December 2014, during L&#x27;Arena, broadcast on the Italian channel Rai 1, presenter Massimo Giletti and guest Carlo Conti revealed the names of the new performers at the 65th Sanremo Music Festival. Fabian was announced as being one of the 20 singers in the &quot;Big&quot; (main) category. It was the second time she has appeared on the Ariston stage (since her guest featuring in 2007 with Gigi D&#x27;Alessio) and the first time as a solo competitor. In several interviews, she dedicated her performance to her mother. Fabian called the song she decided to submit &quot;A hymn to lightness, to enthusiasm&quot;.

On the evening show on 10 February 2015, Fabian performed her new single &quot;Voce&quot; for the Italian market. It is to be included in a new greatest hits album, &quot;Essential Lara Fabian,&quot; specifically released in the country by Warner Italy.

On the evening of 12 February 2015, a visibly moved Fabian sang on the same stage &quot;Sto male&quot;, Ornella Vanoni&#x27;s Italian version of her already popular rendition of &quot;Je Suis Malade&quot;. This was the night of the Sanremo sub-competition for cover versions; she eventually lost to Nek and his &quot;Se telefonando,&quot; formerly popularized by Mina.

On the evening of 13 February, she performed &quot;Voce&quot;, once more, before losing the entire competition. She was already pending since the premiere. An article in the local San Remo Festival publication, &quot;Farewell to foreigners at Sanremo&quot;, written by Erika Cannoletta, maintained that a lack of meritocracy and obscure political issues backstage had contributed to the reasons that led to the elimination of the artist. Before this, the Italian audience and press were generally rather cold towards Fabian, especially in relation to her fame in the country. In a fairly scathing and controversial article titled &quot;Sanremo 2015, who is Lara Fabian? The international star whom nobody ever heard of&quot;, writer and music critic Michele Monina (of Il Fatto Quotidiano) questioned the fame, career and quality of the singer, generating a heated debate on its comment section.

On 15 February, she performed one last time on Domenica In, Rai 1, receiving a standing ovation. The singer will reprise her tour in support of her new release beginning from 21 February 2015, by performing at the Nokia Arena, Tel Aviv, Israel.

=== 2015: &quot;Ma vie dans la tienne&quot; ===
In November 2015, Lara released her 9th studio album, titled &quot;Ma vie dans la tienne&quot; (&quot;My Life In Yours&quot;), consisting of songs she co-wrote and co-composed with David Gategno and Elodie Hesme. The album, which was released under license by Warner Music France, included the singles &quot;Quand je ne chante pas&quot;, &quot;Ma vie dans la tienne&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;oubli&quot; and &quot;Ton désir&quot;. The album was certified &quot;Platinum&quot; in France, Gold in Belgium, and has sold over 150,000 copies worldwide.

=== 2016–2018: &quot;Camouflage&quot; and world tour ===

In 2016, Fabian began work on a new English album, her 13th studio album, planned for release in 2017 under the title &quot;Camouflage&quot;, with a Swedish-American music production team . The album consists of 12 titles and was available for pre-order on 4 August 2017. A first single, &quot;Growing Wings&quot;, was released on the same date. The second single of the album was &quot;Choose What You Love Most (And Let It Kill You).&quot; The Camouflage World Tour, produced by her new producer and manager Matt Ersin, started in Miami on 2 February 2018. She toured throughout the world, making 40 appearances, ending the tour in Paris, in June 2018. During the concert dates in Russia, producer Matt Ersin&#x27;s refusal to exclude the track &quot;La Différence&quot;, which depicts images of same-sex couples in the stage visuals, from the show, caused a legal quagmire with the Russian authorities.

=== 2018–2020: &quot;Papillon &amp; World Tour&quot; ===
In September 2018, Fabian announced the release of her new single, &quot;Papillon&quot;. Written by Fabian, Moh Denebi and Sharon Vaughn. The single was released on 5 October 2018. It&#x27;s the first single from her fourteenth album, also titled Papillon, released on 8 February 2019. To support the release of the album, Lara Fabian embarked upon the 50 World Tour with a concert in New York at the Beacon Theatre on 16 September 2019, before moving on to visit over 20 other locations across the USA, Russia and Europe. The tour celebrates her 50th birthday, three decades in the music industry and 14 studio albums. Lara Fabian claims 20 million records sold. However, according to various media, her official record sales are estimated at 12 million worldwide.

In February 2019, Fabian separated from the management company Odacity and producer/manager Matt Ersin, who managed her career since 2015. Subsequently, she entrusted the coordination of the upcoming &quot;50 World Tour&quot; to the Romanian company &quot;ICT Agency&quot; (International Creative Talents). Payment issues between Fabian and ICT culminated in her cancelling of various concerts. The remaining dates of the tour were postponed following the escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== 2020–present: &quot; Lockdown Sessions &quot; ===

On 16 December 2020, Lara Fabian discreetly unveiled a collection of 12 experimental musical tracks, the fruit of her introspection and her isolation during the COVID-19 lockdown. &quot;Lockdown Sessions&quot; came out in a limited edition without a label, and offers a unique journey of the singer accompanied again by Moh Denebi.

She takes on the role of director of &quot;Star Académie&quot; on TVA in 2021.

She has also had occasional roles as an actress, most notably in the 2022 film &quot;Arlette&quot;.

== Artistry ==
Fabian is a soprano with a vocal range that spans three octaves from C3 to G5 in live performances. Beginning 2001-2004, the French media began referring to Fabian as one of the (&quot;great Quebecois voices&quot;) at the centre of contemporary trends in popular music. Other singers grouped in this category included Isabelle Boulay, Céline Dion, Natasha St-Pier, Garou, Daniel Lavoie, Lynda Lemay, Bruno Pelletier and Roch Voisine. However, the musicologist Catherine Rudent concludes that only Boulay, Dion and St-Pier truly resemble Fabian in répertoire, voice and techniques of interpretation. These singers have in common a style inherited from soul music, in which expressive vocality takes priority over the text, making full use of registers of the chest and head, vocal ornamentation and improvisation.

In addition to her main languages, Fabian has also sung in Azerbaijani, German, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Russian and Turkish.

== Writing for other artists ==
Fabian has written for other artists, such as French female singers Chimène Badi, Nolwenn Leroy, and Myriam Abel. She also composed for Daniel Lévi and is said to be currently working with a former contestant from &quot;Nouvelle Star 3&quot;, Roland. She has often praised the voice and talent of successful female singer Amel Bent, who was also a contestant on that show.
She wrote &quot;Dis-moi comment t&#x27;aimer&quot; for Greek singer George Perris on his album Un Souhait.
&quot;Imaginer&quot; was originally written in English, under the name &#x27;Broken Vow&#x27;, by Fabian and songwriter Walter Afanasieff. They rewrote the lyrics especially for Jackie Evancho, in French, for her album &quot;Dream with Me&quot;. The original meaning of the song, about a sad love, is completely changed in the French version to describe a dream of a beautiful world without war or hunger. 
She wrote the English lyrics for the song &quot;Your Love&quot;, music by Igor Krutoy and interpreted by Dimash Qudaibergen.

== Personal life ==
Fabian is a polyglot. Raised as a native Sicilian and Italian speaker, she also learned French and some Flemish while living in Belgium, as well as English and Spanish, which she studied at school.

Fabian was in a relationship with Rick Allison, with whom she wrote her greatest hits, for 14 years until their separation in March 2003.

Fabian was in a relationship with French director, producer, and composer that lasted from 2006 to 2012. They have a daughter together, born in 2007.

She married Sicilian magician Gabriel Di Giorgio in 2013.

<text>Sedgefield District was, from 1974 to 2009, a local government district and (from 1996), borough in County Durham, in North East England. It had a population of about 87,000 (2001 UK census). It was named after Sedgefield, but its largest town was Newton Aycliffe. Other places included Shildon, Ferryhill and Spennymoor.

The borough was formed (as Sedgefield District), in 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by the merger of Sedgefield Rural District, Spennymoor and Shildon urban districts and part of Darlington Rural District.

The borough was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England.

From 1983 to 2007, most of the district was represented in parliament by Tony Blair, who became Leader of the Labour Party in 1994, and Prime Minister in 1997.

<text>Dell EMC (EMC Corporation until 2016) is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, and Round Rock, Texas, and is a subsidiary of Dell Technologies. Dell EMC sells data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing and other products and services that enable organizations to store, manage, protect, and analyze data. Dell EMC&#x27;s target markets include large companies and small- and medium-sized businesses across various vertical markets. 

The company&#x27;s stock (as EMC Corporation) was added to the New York Stock Exchange on April 6, 1986, and was also listed on the S&amp;P 500 index. EMC acquired Iomega in 2008, and a 2013 partnership with Lenovo resulted in the rebranding of Iomega as LenovoEMC. EMC was acquired by Dell in 2016, which led to the joint venture with Lenovo dissolving. At that time, &quot;Forbes&quot; noted EMC&#x27;s &quot;focus on developing and selling data storage and data management hardware and software and convincing its customers to buy its products independent of their other IT buying decisions&quot; based on &quot;best-of-breed.&quot; It was later renamed to Dell EMC. Dell uses the EMC name with some of its products.

==History==
EMC, founded in 1979 by Richard Egan and Roger Marino (the E and M of EMC), introduced its first 64-kilobyte (65,536 bytes) memory boards for the Prime Computer in 1981. EMC continued to develop memory boards for other computer types. In the mid-1980s, the company expanded beyond memory to other computer data storage types and networked storage platforms. EMC began shipping its flagship product, the Symmetrix, in 1990.

While some of EMC&#x27;s growth is credited to acquisitions of smaller companies, Symmetrix was the main factor in EMC&#x27;s rapid growth during the 1990s, from a firm valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a multi-billion dollar company.

In 2009 EMC signed a two-year deal to be the principal shirt sponsor for English Rugby Union club London Wasps in a deal worth £1 Million. This was later extended until the end of the 2013 season.

Michael Ruettgers joined EMC in 1988 and was CEO from 1992 until January 2001. Under Ruettgers&#x27; leadership, EMC revenues grew from $120 million to nearly $9 billion 10 years later, and the company shifted its focus from memory boards to storage systems. Ruettgers was named one of &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;s &quot;World&#x27;s Top 25 Executives&quot;; one of the &quot;Best Chief Executive Officers in America&quot; by &quot;Worth&quot; magazine; and one of &quot;Network World&quot;s &quot;25 Most Powerful People in Networking&quot;.

Ahead of their acquisition by Dell, EMC gained a reputation for oppressive non-compete agreements and non-compete lobbying through AIM (Associated Industries of Massachusetts)

===Acquisition by Dell===
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion, which as of 2021 remains the largest-ever acquisition in the technology sector. The combination of Dell&#x27;s enterprise server, personal computer, and mobile businesses with EMC&#x27;s enterprise storage business was a significant vertical merger of IT giants. Dell offered $24.05 per share of EMC, and $9.05 per share of tracking stock in VMware.

On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the merger, which involved the issuance of $45.9 billion in debt and $4.4 billion common stock. At the time, some analysts claimed that Dell&#x27;s acquisition of the former
Iomega could harm the LenovoEMC partnership.

==Products and services==
In addition to those of the majority-owned Pivotal company, Dell EMC sells products and services, including products from other Dell Technologies companies, designed to allow IT departments to move to a cloud computing model and to analyze big data. LenovoEMC, formerly Iomega, sells storage products.

==Major acquisitions==
The following table includes the listing and timeline of EMC Corporation&#x27;s major acquisitions of other companies since 1996.

==Big data projects==
In 2012, EMC sponsored The Human Face of Big Data, a globally crowdsourced media project focusing on the ability to collect, analyze, triangulate and visualize vast amounts of data in real-time. The Human Face of Big Data, produced by Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt, includes &quot;a number of fascinating stories ... [that] represent some of the most innovative applications of data that are shaping our future&quot;.

<text>Roaring Fork River is a tributary of the Colorado River, approximately long, in west central Colorado in the United States. The river drains a populated and economically vital area of the Colorado Western Slope called the Roaring Fork Valley or Roaring Fork Watershed, which includes the resort city of Aspen and the resorts of Aspen/Snowmass.
It rises in the Sawatch Range in eastern Pitkin County, on the west side of Independence Pass on the continental divide. It flows northwest past Aspen, Woody Creek, and Snowmass. It receives the Fryingpan River at Basalt. below Carbondale, it receives the Crystal River from the south. It joins the Colorado in Glenwood Springs. The entire area that drains into the Roaring Fork River is known as the Roaring Fork Watershed. This area is and about the same size as the state of Rhode Island. The river flows through canyons along most of its route and is a popular destination for recreation whitewater rafting. The river supplies water through the Sawatch Range to the Twin Lakes Reservoir via the Twin Lakes Tunnel. Roaring Fork Conservancy is the watershed conservation organization for the Roaring Fork River and its tributaries.

The Roaring Fork is a swift, deep, powerful river with very clear water. It is navigable by small craft throughout most of its length to its confluence with the Colorado. The mean annual flow is .

<text>Kelvinside Academy is a private day school in Glasgow, Scotland, founded in 1878. It has a capacity of over 600 pupils and spans two years of Nursery, six years of Junior School (primary school), a transition year of Senior Preparatory, and six years of Senior School (secondary school), comprising fifteen years in all. Kelvinside was founded as a private school and remained so until the late 1940s when, like many similar schools, it became &#x27;grant-aided&#x27; until 1985 when it reverted to its fully independent roots once more. Formerly for boys only, the school became fully co-educational in 1998.

==The School==

Kelvinside Academy is in the Kelvinside area of the north of Glasgow, near the Glasgow Botanic Gardens. It has a large main building, which is category A listed and was designed by James Sellars, with some modern additions. The original building was opened on 2 September 1878 and cost £21,698 11s; this included the construction of both roads and sewers.

The School crest shows Minerva with the motto &quot;ΑΙΕΝ ΑΡΙΣΤΕΥΕΙΝ&quot; which translates as &quot;Ever To Be The Best&quot;. This has also been given a &quot;modern&quot; translation of &quot;The Best You Can Be&quot;. Minerva appears prominently in carved stone above the main entrance, and in a bronze medallion set in the perimeter wall. Unlike many of the surrounding buildings, the School retains much of its original cast iron fences despite the metal shortages during the Second World War.

There is a well-established house system, which divides all the pupils into four different houses, each represented by a colour: red for Stewart House, yellow for Buchanan House, green for MacGregor House and blue for Colquhoun.

The School opened a new Nursery at its Balgray Campus in August 2013.

In 2018, Kelvinside merged with Craigholme School to form the Glasgow Schools Trust, which was created to share resources between both schools and preserve both schools due to falling pupil numbers.

<text>The Fryingpan River is a tributary of the Roaring Fork River, approximately long, in Eagle and Pitkin counties in Colorado, United States.

==History==
The name originated when all but two of a group of trappers were killed by Utes; one survivor was injured and stayed in a cave while the other went to summon help after hanging a frying pan in a tree so he could find the cave again.

==Geography==
It rises in northeastern Pitkin County, in the White River National Forest in the Sawatch Mountains along the western side of the continental divide. It flows westward along the county line between Pitkin and Eagle County. Below Meredith, it is dammed to form the Ruedi Reservoir. It joins the Roaring Fork below Basalt. A portion of the river&#x27;s water is diverted to the east side of the continental divide for irrigation and drinking water via the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project.

<text>The Crystal River is a tributary of the Roaring Fork River. It is approximately long and is located in Gunnison, Pitkin and Garfield counties in Colorado, United States.

The river is a popular fly fishing and outdoor tourism destination.

The Crystal River remains one of the few rivers in Colorado that is undammed along its length, making the segments that are upstream of large ranching irrigation diversions outside of Carbondale eligible for federal Wild and Scenic River protection. 

The Crystal Valley historically was a seasonal home and hunting ground of the Parianuche and Yampa bands of the Ute people.

==Description==
The watershed includes a series of prehistorically glaciated valleys on the west side of the Elk Mountains such as Avalanche Creek, Silver Creek, Yule Creek and the North and South Forks of the Crystal. It also drains southern portions of the east side of the Thompson Divide via Coal Basin, Perham Creek, and Thompson Creek. The village of Redstone and Coal Basin was historically a center of coal mining, while quarrying for Yule Marble in Marble continues presently. It rises in northern Gunnison County on the north side of Schofield Pass near the Maroon Bells and passes through the ghost town of Crystal City, still inhabited by a few summer residents and known for the Crystal Mill photographic attraction. It then flows north past Marble into Pitkin County and past Redstone. It joins the Roaring Fork below Carbondale in Garfield County. State Highway 133 follows the river along much of its route from Carbondale until several miles below Marble, where 133 turns southwest and crosses McClure Pass towards Paonia and Delta, Colorado.

From Crystal City to Marble the river flows through the Crystal River Canyon, a narrow valley with numerous snowslide runs, rockfalls, and other hazardous terrain. Although it is locally known as a fishing and hiking attraction the unpaved and largely un-maintained mining road, designated Gunnison County Road 3 on Mapquest, is nearly impassable to vehicles other than ATVs and off-road motorcycles. A four-wheel-drive Jeep tour is operated out of Marble, but only operates during the summer when the road is not blocked by snow, mud, or rock slides.

<doc id="515758" wikidata="Q193237" url="?curid=515758" title="Fungicide">
<text>Fungicides are pesticides used to kill parasitic fungi or their spores. Fungi can cause serious damage in agriculture, resulting in losses of yield and quality. Fungicides are used both in agriculture and to fight fungal infections in animals. Fungicides are also used to control oomycetes, which are not taxonomically/genetically fungi, although sharing similar methods of infecting plants. Fungicides can either be contact, translaminar or systemic. Contact fungicides are not taken up into the plant tissue and protect only the plant where the spray is deposited. Translaminar fungicides redistribute the fungicide from the upper, sprayed leaf surface to the lower, unsprayed surface. Systemic fungicides are taken up and redistributed through the xylem vessels. Few fungicides move to all parts of a plant. Some are locally systemic, and some move upward.

Most fungicides that can be bought retail are sold in liquid form, the active ingredient being present at 0.08% in weaker concentrates, and as high as 0.5% for less potent fungicides. Fungicides in powdered form are usually around 90% sulfur.

==Major fungi in agriculture==
Some major fungal threats to agriculture (and the associated diseases) are Ascomycetes (&quot;potato late blight&quot;), basidiomycetes (&quot;powdery mildew&quot;), deuteromycetes (various rusts), and oomycetes (&quot;downy mildew&quot;).
== Types of fungicides==

Like other pesticides, fungicides are numerous and diverse. This complexity has led to diverse schemes for classifying fungicides. Classifications are based on inorganic (elemental sulfur and copper salts) vs organic, chemical structures (dithiocarbamates vs phthalimides), and, most successfully, mechanism of action (MOA). These respective classifications reflect the evolution of the underlying science.

===Traditional===

Traditional fungicides are simple inorganic compounds like sulfur, and copper salts. While cheap, they must be applied repeatedly and are relatively ineffective. Other active ingredients in fungicides include neem oil, rosemary oil, jojoba oil, the bacterium &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;, and the beneficial fungus &quot;Ulocladium oudemansii&quot;. 

===Nonspecific ===
In the 1930s dithiocarbamate-based fungicides, the first organic compounds used for this purpose, became available. These include ferbam, ziram, zineb, maneb, and mancozeb. These compounds are non-specific and are thought to inhibit cysteine-based protease enzymes. Similarly nonspecific are N-substituted phthalimides. Members include captafol, captan, and folpet. Chlorothalonil is also non-specific.

===Specific===
Specific fungicides target a particular biological process in the fungus. 

===Nucleic acid metabolism===
*bupirimate
*metalaxyl

===Cytoskeleton and motor proteins===
*carbendazim
*pencycuron

===Respiration===
Some fungicides target succinate dehydrogenase, a metabolically central enzyme. Fungi of the class &quot;Basidiomycetes&quot; were the initial focus of these fungicides. These fungi are active against cereals.
*azoxystrobin
*binapacryl
*boscalid
*carboxin
*cyazofamid
*pydiflumetofen

===Amino acid and protein synthesis===
*blasticidin-S
*kasugamycin
*pyrimethanil

===Signal transduction===
*fludioxonil
*procymidone

===Lipid synthesis / membrane integrity===
*propamocarb
*pyrazophos
*tecnazene

===Melanin synthesis in cell wall===
*tricyclazole

===Sterol biosynthesis in membranes===
*fenpropimorph
*hexaconazole
*imazalil
*myclobutanil
*propiconazole

===Cell wall biosynthesis===
*dimethomorph
*polyoxins

===Host plant defence induction===
*acibenzolar
*fosetyl-Al
*phosphorous acid

=== Mycoviruses ===
Some of the most common fungal crop pathogens are known to suffer from mycoviruses, and it is likely that they are as common as for plant and animal viruses, although not as well studied. Given the obligately parasitic nature of mycoviruses, it is likely that all of these are detrimental to their hosts, and thus are potential biocontrols/biofungicides.

== Resistance ==

Doses that provide the most control of the disease also provide the largest selection pressure to acquire resistance.

In some cases, the pathogen evolves resistance to multiple fungicides, a phenomenon known as cross resistance. These additional fungicides typically belong to the same chemical family, act in the same way, or have a similar mechanism for detoxification. Sometimes negative cross-resistance occurs, where resistance to one chemical class of fungicides increases sensitivity to a different chemical class of fungicides. This has been seen with carbendazim and diethofencarb. Also possible is resistance to two chemically different fungicides by separate mutation events. For example, &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; is resistant to both azoles and dicarboximide fungicides.

A common mechanism for acquiring resistance is alteration of the target enzyme. For example, Black Sigatoka, an economically important pathogen of banana, is resistant to the QoI fungicides, due to a single nucleotide change resulting in the replacement of one amino acid (glycine) by another (alanine) in the target protein of the QoI fungicides, cytochrome b. It is presumed that this disrupts the binding of the fungicide to the protein, rendering the fungicide ineffective. Upregulation of target genes can also render the fungicide ineffective. This is seen in DMI-resistant strains of &quot;Venturia inaequalis&quot;.

Resistance to fungicides can also be developed by efficient efflux of the fungicide out of the cell. &quot;Septoria tritici&quot; has developed multiple drug resistance using this mechanism. The pathogen had five ABC-type transporters with overlapping substrate specificities that together work to pump toxic chemicals out of the cell.

In addition to the mechanisms outlined above, fungi may also develop metabolic pathways that circumvent the target protein, or acquire enzymes that enable the metabolism of the fungicide to a harmless substance.

Fungicides that are at risk of losing their potency due to resistance include &quot;Strobilurins&quot; such as azoxystrobin. Cross-resistance can occur because the active ingredients share a common mode of action. FRAC is organized by CropLife International.

==Safety==
Fungicides pose risks for humans.

Fungicide residues have been found on food for human consumption, mostly from post-harvest treatments. Some fungicides are dangerous to human health, such as vinclozolin, which has now been removed from use. Ziram is also a fungicide that is toxic to humans with long-term exposure, and fatal if ingested. A number of fungicides are also used in human health care.

<text>The Rumsen language (also known as Rumsien, Rumsun, &quot;San Carlos Costanoan&quot; and &quot;Carmeleno&quot;) is one of eight Ohlone languages, historically spoken by the Rumsen people of Northern California. The Rumsen language was spoken from the Pajaro River to Point Sur, and on the lower courses of the Pajaro, as well as on the Salinas and Carmel Rivers, and the region of the present-day cities of Salinas, Monterey and Carmel.

== History ==
One of eight languages within the Ohlone branch of the Utian family, it became one of two important native languages spoken at the Mission San Carlos Borroméo de Carmelo founded in 1770, the other being the Esselen language.

The last fluent speaker of Rumsen was Isabel Meadows, who died in 1939. The Bureau of American Ethnology linguist John Peabody Harrington conducted very extensive fieldwork with Meadows in the last several years of her life. These notes, still mostly unpublished, now constitute the foundation for current linguistic research and revitalization efforts on the Rumsen language. The Costanoan Rumsen Carmel Tribe has been in the process of reestablishing their language. They have begun efforts to teach their tribal members Rumsen and are working to complete a revised English - Rumsen Dictionary. 

==Rumsen-speaking tribes==
Dialects of the Rumsen language were spoken by four independent local tribes, including the &quot;Rumsen&quot; themselves, the &quot;Ensen&quot; of the Salinas vicinity, the &quot;Calendaruc&quot; of the central shoreline of Monterey Bay, and the &quot;Sargentaruc&quot; of the Big Sur Coast. The territory of the language group was bordered by Monterey Bay and the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Awaswas Ohlone to the north, the Mutsun Ohlone to the east, the Chalon Ohlone on the south east, and the Esselen to the south.

<doc id="515766" wikidata="Q170697" url="?curid=515766" title="Laura Pausini">
<text>Laura Alice Rossella Pausini (; born 16 May 1974) is an Italian singer-songwriter. She rose to fame in 1993, winning the newcomer artists&#x27; section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival with her debut single &quot;La solitudine&quot;, which became an Italian standard and an international hit. Her self-titled debut album was released in Italy on 23 April 1993 and later became an international success, selling two million copies worldwide. Its follow-up, &quot;Laura&quot;, was released in 1994 and confirmed her international success, selling three million copies worldwide.

Pausini has released fifteen studio albums, two international greatest hits albums and one compilation album for the Anglophone market only. She speaks four languages: Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and English. She mostly performs in Italian and Spanish, but has also recorded and sung songs in Portuguese, English, French, German, Latin, Chinese, Catalan, Neapolitan, Romanian, Romagnol and Sicilian.

Pausini appeared as a coach on both the Mexican and Spanish versions of international reality television singing competition franchise &quot;The Voice&quot;, was a judge on the first and second series of &quot;La banda&quot;, and is likewise a judge on the Spanish version of international franchise &quot;The X Factor&quot;. In 2016, she debuted as a variety show presenter, hosting the television show &quot;Laura &amp; Paola&quot;, with actress Paola Cortellesi.

In 2004, AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier considered Pausini&#x27;s sales &quot;an impressive feat for someone who&#x27;d never really broken into the lucrative English-language market&quot;. In 2014, FIMI certified Pausini&#x27;s sales of more than 70 million records with a FIMI Icon Award, making her the fourth best-selling female artist in Latin music, and the best-selling female non-Spanish speaking Latin music artist.

Throughout her career, she has won numerous music awards in Italy and internationally. In 2006, she won a Grammy Award, receiving the accolade for Best Latin Pop Album for the record &quot;Escucha&quot;. In 2021, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song with &quot;Io sì (Seen)&quot; from the film &quot;The Life Ahead&quot;. The single also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, making it the first Italian-language song to win the award. She has been honoured as a Commander Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and as a World Ambassador of Emilia Romagna.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
The elder of two daughters, Laura Pausini was born in Faenza, in the Province of Ravenna to Fabrizio Pausini and Gianna Ballardini. She grew up in Solarolo, a small &quot;comune&quot; in the same region.[A]
Her father is a former pianist who also played as a sessionman for ABBA&#x27;s Frida Lyngstad and entered a band whose members later founded the Italian pop group Pooh. After becoming a piano bar artist, he encouraged Pausini to start performing as a singer. Her first live performance was on 16 May 1985, when she sang together with her father in a restaurant in Bologna. Since then, her father started giving her singing lessons and she continued to perform alongside him in local piano bars. In the meanwhile, she also started singing in a church choir.

In 1987 she recorded her first demo album, produced by her father and released to promote her live shows. Titled &quot;I sogni di Laura&quot;, it consisted of eight covers and five new songs. In 1991 she participated in the Castrocaro Music Festival singing Liza Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;New York, New York&quot;, but she failed to reach the final stage of the competition. During the same year, she took part in another singing competition, Sanremo Famosi, which should have served as a selection for the newcomers&#x27; of the following Sanremo Music Festival. Despite being declared the joint winner with another contestant, Pausini was not allowed to compete in the Sanremo Music Festival 1992.

===1993: Career breakthrough===
Thanks to her performances in local singing competitions, Pausini was noticed by Italian producer and songwriter Angelo Valsiglio, who introduced her to manager Marco Marati. Valsiglio suggested to her &quot;La solitudine&quot;, a song he wrote with Pietro Cremonesi and Federico Cavalli. Pausini&#x27;s rendition convinced Valsiglio and Marati, who wanted Pausini to audition for some major labels. During one of the auditions, she met Fabrizio Giannini of Warner Music Italy&#x27;s Compagnia Generale del Disco. After impressing him with a performance of an unreleased Mia Martini song, Pausini obtained her first recording contract, becoming one of the first artists discovered by Giannini, who later launched the careers of several Italian acts, including Irene Grandi.
&quot;La solitudine&quot; was selected as one of the entries in the newcomer artists&#x27; section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival. Pausini performed it for the first time on 23 February 1993, during the first night of the contest. After being admitted to the final, held on 27 February 1993, she won the competition, receiving 7,464 votes from the juries and beating Gerardina Trovato with &quot;Ma non ho più la mia città&quot;, who took second place with 7,209 votes.
The song also became a commercial success in Italy, and it is still one of Pausini&#x27;s best-known hits.

Following the success obtained with her debut single, Pausini started working on her first professional album, &quot;Laura Pausini&quot;.
The album was recorded while Pausini was still a high school student at the &quot;Gaetano Ballardini&quot; Institute of Ceramics in Faenza, Italy, where she got her diploma a few months after the release of her debut studio set.
Released by CGD Records in May 1993, it sold 400,000 copies in Italy. The album was also promoted through an Italian outdoor tour during the summer of 1993. In September 1993, Pausini received a Telegatto for Revelation of the Year.

In late 1993, the album was released in the rest of Europe, peaking at number three on the Dutch Albums Chart and reaching the top spot in Belgium. It also achieved commercial success in South America, being certified gold in Brazil and Argentina. Worldwide sales of Pausini&#x27;s debut studio album exceed two million units. Moreover, &quot;La solitudine&quot; became a radio hit in Belgium and the Netherlands, it peaked at number five on the French Singles Chart and it reached the top spot of the Dutch Top 40 and of the Flemish Ultratop 50. The album also spawned the singles &quot;Non c&#x27;è&quot; and &quot;Perché non torna più&quot;.

===1994–1995: Spanish-language debut and international success===
In February 1994, Pausini participated for the second time in the Sanremo Music Festival, competing in the &quot;Big Artists&quot; section with her entry &quot;Strani amori&quot;.
The song ranked third in the competition, behind Aleandro Baldi&#x27;s &quot;Passerà&quot; and Giorgio Faletti&#x27;s &quot;Signor tenente&quot;, and became a hit in Italy, in the Netherlands and in Flanders. The single launched Pausini&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Laura&quot;, released in February 1994. According to CGD Records, the album sold 150,000 copies in Italy in its first week, with initial shipments of 200,000 units. It also peaked at number one on the Dutch Albums Chart and entered the charts in Belgium and Switzerland, selling three million copies worldwide and achieving gold and platinum status in Brazil and Argentina, respectively. Other singles from the album were &quot;Gente&quot;, &quot;Lui non sta con te&quot; and &quot;Lettera&quot;. During the summer of 1994, Pausini took part in the Italian itinerant TV show Festivalbar, reaching the final stage of the music competition and receiving the Premio Europa for her international success. In 1994 she was also awarded with her second Telegatto, receiving the prize for Best Female Artist. In the meanwhile, she started an Italian tour to promote her album.

During the same year, Pausini released her first Spanish-language album, &quot;Laura Pausini&quot;, a compilation of ten adapted versions of hits from her previous albums, issued by Dro Records. The record became the best-selling album of 1994 in Spain, where it was later certified diamond by the Association of Phonographic and Videographic of Spain for sales exceeding one million units. Pausini was the first non-Spanish artist to achieve this result. Following the commercial success obtained in the country, the Spanish Institute of Italian Culture awarded her a &quot;Globo de Platino&quot; for contributing in the spread of Italian culture in Spain.

The album was successful in Latin America too, being certified platinum by the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers, the Asociación Colombiana de Productores de Fonogramas and the Chilean division of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Moreover, the first four singles from the album, &quot;La soledad&quot;, &quot;Se fue&quot;, &quot;Amores extraños&quot; and &quot;Gente&quot;, entered the top 30 on the Hot Latin Songs chart compiled by &quot;Billboard&quot;. Thanks to these results, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Pausini the second female revelation of 1994, after Mariah Carey. In 1995 Pausini also received the World Music Award for Best Selling Italian Recording Artist and the Lo Nuestro Award for Best New Artist of the Year.

Pausini&#x27;s first record for the British market was a self-titled compilation album released in 1995, including nine Italian-language hits and an English-language version of her first single, &quot;La solitudine (Loneliness)&quot;, whose lyrics were adapted by Tim Rice. &quot;La solitudine (Loneliness)&quot; was initially set to be released as a single in the United Kingdom on 19 June 1995, but it was postponed and released in September of the same year. Both the album and the single obtained a very poor commercial reception, failing to enter the charts in the United Kingdom.

=== 1996–1997: &quot;Le cose che vivi&quot; ===
Following the success obtained by Pausini&#x27;s debut Spanish album, her third studio set was released on 12 September 1996 both in Italian and Spanish, under the titles &quot;Le cose che vivi&quot; and &quot;Las cosas que vives&quot;, respectively. Starting from that moment, Pausini has recorded most of her songs both in her native language and in Spanish, in a practice that, according to AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier, has &quot;come to define her career and compound her success&quot;. A special edition of the album was also released in Brazil, featuring three additional bonus tracks in Portuguese.

The album was preceded by the single &quot;Incancellabile&quot;, released to Italian radio stations on 26 August 1996 and titled &quot;Inolvidable&quot; in its version for the Hispanic market. Other singles from the album include the title-track &quot;Le cose che vivi&quot;, whose Spanish-language version topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Pop Songs chart, &quot;Ascolta il tuo cuore&quot;, &quot;Seamisai&quot; and &quot;Dos enamorados&quot;, which was not released in its Italian-language version. The album sold 3,500,000 copies worldwide and was certified Platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, for European sales exceeding 1,000,000 units. At the 9th Lo Nuestro Awards for Latin Music, Pausini was nominated for Pop Female Singer and Video of the Year for the Spanish-language version of &quot;Le cose che vivi&quot;.

In December 1996, Pausini was among the artists singing for Pope John Paul II during the &quot;Natale in Vaticano&quot; concert, a Christmas show held at the Paul VI Audience Hall. During the event, she performed a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; and the song &quot;Il mondo che vorrei&quot;.
In February 1997 she was also invited as a guest to the Viña del Mar International Song Festival in Chile. On 1 March 1997, she launched from Geneva the World Wide Tour in support of the album, giving concerts in Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, France, as well as in the United States, Canada and many other American countries, including Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Colombia and Mexico. It was Pausini&#x27;s first international tour, during which she gave concerts in indoor arenas for the first time. In August of the same year, during the last night of the Festivalbar, she received the International Award for the success she achieved abroad.

===1998–1999: &quot;La mia risposta&quot; / &quot;Mi respuesta&quot;===
In 1998, Pausini released her fourth studio album, &quot;La mia risposta&quot;, together with its Spanish-language counterpart, &quot;Mi respuesta&quot;. The album, which included a song penned by Phil Collins, was dubbed by Italian music critics as a mature work, with influences from soul music, but, despite reaching the top spot of the Italian Albums Chart, it was a moderate commercial success, selling two million copies worldwide. The lead single from the album, &quot;Un&#x27;emergenza d&#x27;amore&quot;, was released in September 1998, and was followed by &quot;In assenza di te&quot; and &quot;La mia risposta&quot;, the latter being performed during the Festivalbar in 1999.

To promote the album, Pausini began in early 1999 the La Mia Risposta World Tour &#x27;99, during which she performed in theatres throughout Europe. On 1 June 1999, she was one of the artists performing along with Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti in Modena during his annual &quot;Pavarotti and Friends&quot; concert. Pavarotti and Pausini duetted in the Italian version of the aria &quot;Dein ist mein ganzes Herz&quot;, titled &quot;Tu che m&#x27;hai preso il cuor&quot;, from Franz Lehár&#x27;s operetta &quot;Das Land des Lächelns&quot;. The live performance was later included in the album &quot;Pavarotti &amp; Friends for the Children of Guatemala and Kosovo&quot;. In 1999, she also contributed the Richard Marx composition &quot;One More Time&quot; to the &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; soundtrack. The track was produced by David Foster who was featured on piano.

===2000–2001: &quot;Tra te e il mare&quot; / &quot;Entre tú y mil mares&quot;===
In 2000, she recorded the song &quot;The Extra Mile&quot; for the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Pokémon 2000: The Power of One&quot;. The song was included in the album &quot;Tra te e il mare&quot;, released on 11 September 2000 and preceded by the homonymous single, written by Italian pop singer Biagio Antonacci. Other singles from the album include &quot;Il mio sbaglio più grande&quot;, which was a top 20 hit in Italy, and &quot;Volevo dirti che ti amo&quot;, whose Spanish-language version &quot;Quiero decirte que te amo&quot; peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Pop Songs chart.
The album also features the songs &quot;Viaggio con te&quot;, which was composed by her father and which was awarded in 2001 with an Italian Lunezia Award for Best Songwriter of the Year, and &quot;Per vivere&quot;, written from the point of view of a homeless child Pausini met in Rio de Janeiro and dedicated to two Brazilian children sponsored by her.

&quot;Tra te e il mare&quot; received a nomination for Album of the Year at the Premio Italiano della Musica, while Pausini was nominated for Best Female Artist during the same award ceremony, as well as in the first edition of the Italian Music Awards, held in February 2001.
A Spanish-language version of the album, titled &quot;Entre tú y mil mares&quot;, was released shortly before the Italian-language edition, on 11 September 2000. At the 2001 Latin Grammy Awards, the record received two nominations for Best Female Pop Vocal Album and Best Engineered Album, while Pausini and Alfredo Cerruti were in the shortlist for Producer of the Year.

Pausini&#x27;s first international greatest hits album was released in 2001, both in an Italian-language version and in a Spanish-language edition, titled &quot;The Best of Laura Pausini: E ritorno da te&quot; and &quot;Lo mejor de Laura Pausini: Volveré junto a ti&quot;, respectively. The first single, &quot;E ritorno da te&quot;—&quot;Volveré junto a ti&quot; in Spanish—was accompanied by a music video shot by Italian film director Gabriele Muccino. The album also includes the single &quot;Una storia che vale&quot; and features guest appearances by Brazilian singer Gilberto Gil in &quot;Seamisai&quot; and by Italian singer Nek, who plays bass in &quot;Non c&#x27;è&quot;.

Supported by the 2001/2002 World Tour, which started in Miami on 19 October 2001, the greatest hits became one of Pausini&#x27;s biggest commercial successes, selling 700,000 copies in Italy and 800,000 copies in France.
During the concert she gave in Milan on 2 December 2001 as part of the tour, Pausini also recorded her first live video album, titled &quot;Live 2001-2002 World Tour&quot; and released on 30 November 2002.

===2002–2003: &quot;From the Inside&quot;===
In 2001, Pausini started working with producers such as Patrick Leonard and John Shanks on her first English-language album, &quot;From the Inside&quot;. Released in Canada, Mexico and the United States by Atlantic Records on 5 November 2002, the album did not get the expected success, selling 50,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen-Soundscan. The album singles &quot;Surrender&quot; and &quot;If That&#x27;s Love&quot; reached the top spot on the Hot Dance Club Songs Chart, but Pausini, disappointed at her English-language debut being ignored in the U.S. outside the club scene, abandoned the promotion for &quot;From the Inside&quot; due to her label promoting it as a dance album instead of a pop album as she requested. The album was later released in Europe too, selling 800,000 copies worldwide.

In 2003 Luciano Pavarotti invited her for the second time to the &quot;Pavarotti and Friends&quot; concert, where they duetted again in &quot;Tu che m&#x27;hai preso il cuor&quot;.

===2004–2005: &quot;Resta in ascolto&quot; / &quot;Escucha&quot; and Grammy wins===
In October 2004, Pausini released her eighth studio album, &quot;Resta in ascolto&quot;, and its Spanish-language counterpart, &quot;Escucha&quot;. Influenced by international artists including Phil Collins and Celine Dion, the recording is on the subject of a break-up and was written in 2002, during her separation from her ex-boyfriend and producer Alfredo Cerruti.

The album features the song &quot;Mi abbandono a te&quot;, co-written by Pausini, Rick Nowels and Madonna. It also includes the Biagio Antonacci-written ballad &quot;Vivimi&quot;, whose Spanish-language version, &quot;Viveme&quot;, won a Billboard Latin Music Award in 2006 for Female Latin Pop Airplay Song of the Year, and the single &quot;Benedetta passione&quot;, penned by Italian rock-star Vasco Rossi. Well received by music critics, the album is mainly focused on themes of anger, bitterness, desire for independence and interior peace, but also features a song about the Iraq War, in which Pausini sings about Ali Ismail Abbas, a boy who was severely injured in a nighttime rocket attack near Baghdad in 2003.

The album debuted at number one on the Italian Albums Chart and sold 350,000 copies in Italy. Its Spanish version later won Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2005 and Best Latin Pop Album at the 48th Grammy Awards, making Pausini the first Italian female artist to win a Grammy Award. In January 2005, Pausini started a new tour to promote the album. The concerts she gave at the Zénith de Paris on 22 and 23 March 2005 were filmed and released as a live album in November 2005, titled &quot;Live in Paris 05&quot;.

Pausini made a guest appearance on Michael Bublé&#x27;s 2005 live album &quot;Caught in the Act&quot;, singing a duet with Bublé of Lou Rawls&#x27; hit &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Find Another Love Like Mine&quot;. The duet was placed on both the audio CD, and the full concert DVD that aired on PBS as an episode of &quot;Great Performances&quot;.

At the 2006 Lo Nuestro Award, Pausini was nominated in the sections Album of the Year for &quot;Escucha&quot;, Song of the Year and Video of the Year for &quot;Viveme&quot; and won the award for Best Female Pop Artist.

===2006–2007: &quot;Io canto&quot;===

In November 2006, Pausini released the album &quot;Io canto&quot; / &quot;Yo canto&quot;, consisting of covers of Italian pop rock songs. On the album liner notes, Pausini wrote:
&quot;here is the music I listen to when I&#x27;m at my saddest, or when I feel a moment is special, the songs I used to sing as a young girl when I first started performing, and above all those which taught me to love music, and how music can move you so deeply, regardless of its genre or style&quot;.

The album also features duets with Tiziano Ferro, Juanes and Johnny Hallyday. It debuted at number one on the Italian Albums Chart and held the top spot for 8 non-consecutive weeks. It also became the best-selling album of 2006 in Italy, selling 500,000 copies in less than two months. On 8 November 2007, the album won Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the Latin Grammy Awards.

Pausini grew up listening to Aznavour&#x27;s songs, and in a January 2009 interview on France 2&#x27;s Vivement Dimanche hosted by Michel Drucker, Aznavour said of Pausini, seated by his side after a live duet performance of &quot;Paris au mois d&#x27;août&quot;, that &quot;she knows the lyrics [to my songs] better than me.&quot; In November 2009 &quot;Primavera in anticipo&quot; went on to win Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the Latin Grammy Awards.

==Artistry==

Pausini is described as a mezzo-soprano with a classic and powerful voice. Due to her voice, Pausini has been compared by music critics to various female artists, including Milva.

At the beginning of her career, she was considered by music critics as a teen idol mainly singing about adolescent love affairs and problems. She was also strongly criticized for her songs, described as too melancholic and trivial.
Starting from her 1998&#x27;s &quot;La mia risposta&quot; / &quot;Mi respuesta&quot;, Italian music critics considered her as a more mature singer and later praised her simplicity and her voice, describing Pausini as an interpreter of her years.

Although Pausini is mainly a melodic pop singer, her musical style evolved during her career, with influences from various genres, including Latin music, soul music and rock music. In 2001, David Cazares of the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; described Pausini&#x27;s music as &quot;an assortment of glossy and sentimental pop ballads backed by light rock instrumentation and synthesized strings&quot;. In 2006, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Achy Obejas wrote that Pausini is distinguished from other Latin pop singers by her sophistication and her European sensibilities. According to &quot;Musica e dischi&quot;&#x27;s Antonio Orlando, the key elements in Pausini&#x27;s style are romanticism, optimism, melancholy and surrounding melodies.

Starting from her 1996 album &quot;Le cose che vivi&quot; / &quot;Las cosas que vives&quot;, Pausini has also co-written most of her songs and starting from her 1998&#x27;s &quot;La mia risposta&quot; / &quot;Mi respuesta&quot; she has been involved in the production of her albums.

==Personal life==

Pausini left her hometown in 1995, when she moved to Milan with her partner, manager and producer Alfredo Cerruti Jr. Their relationship ended in 2002. Between 2002 and 2005 Pausini was romantically involved with her new manager, Gabriele Parisi.

In 2005, Pausini was in a relationship with Italian guitarist, composer, music producer, and former singer Paolo Carta. At the time, the relationship was controversial as Carta was still married to his first wife, Rebecca Galli, with whom he has three children. Pausini gave birth to their daughter on 8 February 2013. After 18 years together, Pausini and Carta got married on 22 March 2023.

Pausini describes herself as a Catholic woman, but expressed doubts about the Church&#x27;s position on various themes, including contraception, abortion, divorce, premarital sex and gay rights. In September 2000 she explained her position during an interview to the Italian newspaper &quot;la Repubblica&quot;:

<text>Sir Owen Willans Richardson (26 April 1879 – 15 February 1959) was a British physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1928 for his work on thermionic emission, which led to Richardson&#x27;s law.

==Biography==
Richardson was born in Dewsbury, Yorkshire, England, the son of Joshua Henry and Charlotte Maria Richardson. He was educated at Batley Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained First Class Honours in Natural Sciences. He then got a DSc from University College London in 1904.

After graduating in 1900, he began researching the emission of electricity from hot bodies at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, and in October 1902 he was made a fellow at Trinity. In 1901, he demonstrated that the current from a heated wire seemed to depend exponentially on the temperature of the wire with a mathematical form similar to the Arrhenius equation. This became known as Richardson&#x27;s law: &quot;If then the negative radiation is due to the corpuscles coming out of the metal, the saturation current &quot;s&quot; should obey the law formula_1.&quot;

Richardson was professor at Princeton University from 1906 to 1913, and returned to the UK in 1914 to become Wheatstone Professor of Physics at King&#x27;s College London, where he was later made director of research in 1924. In 1927, he was one of the participants of the fifth Solvay Conference on Physics that took place at the International Solvay Institute for Physics in Belgium. He retired from King’s College London in 1944, and died in 1959. He is buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.

He also researched the photoelectric effect, the gyromagnetic effect, the emission of electrons by chemical reactions, soft X-rays, and the spectrum of hydrogen.

Richardson married Lilian Wilson, sister of his Cavendish colleague Harold Wilson, in 1906, and had two sons and a daughter. Richardson had two sisters. Elizabeth Mary Dixon Richardson married the prominent mathematician Oswald Veblen. Charlotte Sara Richardson married the American physicist (and 1937 Nobel laureate) Clinton Davisson, who was Richardson&#x27;s PhD student at Princeton. After Lilian&#x27;s death in 1945, he was remarried in 1948 to Henriette Rupp, a physicist.

Owen Willans Richardson had a son, Harold Owen Richardson, who specialised in Nuclear Physics and was also the chairman of the Physics Department at Bedford College, London University and later on became emeritus professor at London University.

==Honours==

Richardson was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1910. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1913, and was awarded its Hughes Medal in 1920. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1928, &quot;for his work on the thermionic phenomenon and especially for the discovery of the law named after him&quot;. He was knighted in 1939.

<doc id="515770" wikidata="Q949326" url="?curid=515770" title="Refresh rate">
<text>The refresh rate, also known as vertical refresh rate or vertical scan rate in reference to terminology originating with the cathode-ray tubes (CRTs), is the number of times per second that a raster-based display device displays a new image. This is independent from frame rate, which describes how many images are stored or generated every second by the device driving the display. On CRT displays, higher refresh rates produce less flickering, thereby reducing eye strain. In other technologies such as liquid-crystal displays, the refresh rate affects only how often the image can potentially be updated.

Non-raster displays may not have a characteristic refresh rate. Vector displays, for instance, do not trace the entire screen, only the actual lines comprising the displayed image, so refresh speed may differ by the size and complexity of the image data. For computer programs or telemetry, the term is sometimes applied to how frequently a datum is updated with a new external value from another source (for example; a shared public spreadsheet or hardware feed).

== Physical factors ==
While all raster display devices have a characteristic refresh rate, the physical implementation differs between technologies.

===Cathode-ray tubes===
Raster-scan CRTs by their nature must refresh the screen since their phosphors will fade and the image will disappear quickly unless refreshed regularly.

In a CRT, the vertical scan rate is the number of times per second that the electron beam returns to the upper left corner of the screen to begin drawing a new frame. It is controlled by the vertical blanking signal generated by the video controller, and is partially limited by the monitor&#x27;s maximum horizontal scan rate.

The refresh rate can be calculated from the horizontal scan rate by dividing the scanning frequency by the number of horizontal lines, plus some amount of time to allow for the beam to return to the top. By convention, this is a 1.05x multiplier. For instance, a monitor with a horizontal scanning frequency of 96 kHz at a resolution of results in a refresh rate of 89 Hz (rounded down).

CRT refresh rates have historically been an important factor in video game programming. In early videogame systems, the only time available for computation was during the vertical blanking interval, during which the beam is returning to the top right corner of the screen and no image is being drawn. Even in modern games, however, it is important to avoid altering the computer&#x27;s video buffer except during the vertical retrace, to prevent flickering graphics or screen tearing.

===Liquid-crystal displays===
Unlike CRTs, where the image will fade unless refreshed, the pixels of liquid-crystal displays retain their state for as long as power is provided. Consequently, there is no intrinsic flicker regardless of refresh rate. However, the refresh rate still determines the highest frame rate that can be displayed, and despite there being no actual blanking of the screen, the vertical blanking interval is still a period in each refresh cycle when the screen is not being updated, during which the image data in the host system&#x27;s frame buffer can be updated. Vsync options can eliminate screen tearing by rendering the whole image at the same time.

==Computer displays==

On smaller CRT monitors (up to about ), few people notice any discomfort between 60–72 Hz. On larger CRT monitors ( or larger), most people experience mild discomfort unless the refresh is set to 72 Hz or higher. A rate of 100 Hz is comfortable at almost any size. However, this does not apply to LCD monitors. The closest equivalent to a refresh rate on an LCD monitor is its frame rate, which is often locked at 60 fps. But this is rarely a problem, because the only part of an LCD monitor that could produce CRT-like flicker—its backlight—typically operates at around a minimum of 200 Hz.

Different operating systems set the default refresh rate differently. Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows 98 (First and Second Editions) set the refresh rate to the highest rate that they believe the display supports. Windows NT-based operating systems, such as Windows 2000 and its descendants Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, set the default refresh rate to a conservative rate, usually 60 Hz. Some fullscreen applications, including many games, now allow the user to reconfigure the refresh rate before entering fullscreen mode, but most default to a conservative resolution and refresh rate and let you increase the settings in the options.

Old monitors could be damaged if a user set the video card to a refresh rate higher than the highest rate supported by the monitor. Some models of monitors display a notice that the video signal uses an unsupported refresh rate.

== Dynamic refresh rate ==

Some LCDs support adapting their refresh rate to the current frame rate delivered by the graphics card. Two technologies that allow this are FreeSync and G-Sync.

==Stereo displays==
When LCD shutter glasses are used for stereo 3D displays, the effective refresh rate is halved, because each eye needs a separate picture. For this reason, it is usually recommended to use a display capable of at least 120 Hz, because divided in half this rate is again 60 Hz. Higher refresh rates result in greater image stability, for example 72 Hz non-stereo is 144 Hz stereo, and 90 Hz non-stereo is 180 Hz stereo. Most low-end computer graphics cards and monitors cannot handle these high refresh rates, especially at higher resolutions.

For LCD monitors the pixel brightness changes are much slower than CRT or plasma phosphors. Typically LCD pixel brightness changes are faster when voltage is applied than when voltage is removed, resulting in an asymmetric pixel response time. With 3D shutter glasses this can result in a blurry smearing of the display and poor depth perception, due to the previous image frame not fading to black fast enough as the next frame is drawn.

==Televisions==
The development of televisions in the 1930s was determined by a number of technical limitations. The AC power line frequency was used for the vertical refresh rate for two reasons. The first reason was that the television&#x27;s vacuum tube was susceptible to interference from the unit&#x27;s power supply, including residual ripple. This could cause drifting horizontal bars (hum bars). Using the same frequency reduced this, and made interference static on the screen and therefore less obtrusive. The second reason was that television studios would use AC lamps, filming at a different frequency would cause strobing. Thus producers had little choice but to run sets at 60 Hz in America, and 50 Hz in Europe. These rates formed the basis for the sets used today: 60 Hz System M (almost always used with NTSC color coding) and 50 Hz System B/G (almost always used with PAL or SECAM color coding). This accident of chance gave European sets higher resolution, in exchange for lower frame rates. Compare System M (704 × 480 at 30i) and System B/G (704 × 576 at 25i). However, the lower refresh rate of 50 Hz introduces more flicker, so sets that use digital technology to double the refresh rate to 100 Hz are now very popular. (see Broadcast television systems)

Another difference between 50 Hz and 60 Hz standards is the way motion pictures (film sources as opposed to video camera sources) are transferred or presented. 35 mm film is typically shot at 24 frames per second (fps). For PAL 50 Hz this allows film sources to be easily transferred by accelerating the film by 4%. The resulting picture is therefore smooth, however, there is a small shift in the pitch of the audio. NTSC sets display both 24 fps and 25 fps material without any speed shifting by using a technique called 3:2 pulldown, but at the expense of introducing unsmooth playback in the form of telecine judder.

Similar to some computer monitors and some DVDs, analog television systems use interlace, which decreases the apparent flicker by painting first the odd lines and then the even lines (these are known as fields). This doubles the refresh rate, compared to a progressive scan image at the same frame rate. This works perfectly for video cameras, where each field results from a separate exposurethe effective frame rate doubles, there are now 50 rather than 25 exposures per second. The dynamics of a CRT are ideally suited to this approach, fast scenes will benefit from the 50 Hz refresh, the earlier field will have largely decayed away when the new field is written, and static images will benefit from improved resolution as both fields will be integrated by the eye. Modern CRT-based televisions may be made flicker-free in the form of 100 Hz technology.

Many high-end LCD televisions now have a 120 or 240 Hz (current and former NTSC countries) or 100 or 200 Hz (PAL/SECAM countries) refresh rate. The rate of 120 was chosen as the least common multiple of 24 fps (cinema) and 30 fps (NTSC TV), and allows for less distortion when movies are viewed due to the elimination of telecine (3:2 pulldown). For PAL at 25 fps, 100 or 200 Hz is used as a fractional compromise of the least common multiple of 600 (24 × 25). These higher refresh rates are most effective from a 24p-source video output (e.g. Blu-ray Disc), and/or scenes of fast motion.

==Displaying movie content on a TV==

As movies are usually filmed at a rate of 24 frames per second, while television sets operate at different rates, some conversion is necessary. Different techniques exist to give the viewer an optimal experience.

The combination of content production, playback device, and display device processing may also give artifacts that are unnecessary. A display device producing a fixed 60 fps rate cannot display a 24 fps movie at an even, judder-free rate. Usually a 3:2 pulldown is used, giving a slight uneven movement.

While common multisync CRT computer monitors have been capable of running at even multiples of 24 Hz since the early 1990s, recent &quot;120 Hz&quot; LCDs have been produced for the purpose of having smoother, more fluid motion, depending upon the source material, and any subsequent processing done to the signal. In the case of material shot on video, improvements in smoothness just from having a higher refresh rate may be barely noticeable.

In the case of filmed material, as 120 is an even multiple of 24, it is possible to present a 24 fps sequence without judder on a well-designed 120 Hz display (i.e., so-called 5-5 pulldown). If the 120 Hz rate is produced by frame-doubling a 60 fps 3:2 pulldown signal, the uneven motion could still be visible (i.e., so-called 6-4 pulldown).

Additionally, material may be displayed with synthetically created smoothness with the addition of motion interpolation abilities to the display, which has an even larger effect on filmed material.

&quot;50 Hz&quot; TV sets (when fed with &quot;50 Hz&quot; content) usually get a movie that is slightly faster than normal, avoiding any problems with uneven pulldown.

<text>The Kwanza River, also known as the Coanza, the Quanza, and the Cuanza, is the longest river in Angola. It empties into the Atlantic Ocean just south of the national capital Luanda.

==Geography==
The river is navigable for about from its mouth, located south of Luanda. Its tributaries include the Cutato and Lucala.

==History==
The river&#x27;s navigable lower course was the original route of the Portuguese invasion of northern Angola.

The Capanda Dam in Malanje Province was finished in 2004, providing hydroelectric power to the region and assisting in its irrigation. The Cambambe Dam and the Lauca Dam were also constructed on the river. The Caculo Cabaça Dam is under construction with estimated completion in 2024. The &quot;Barra do Kwanza&quot;, the mouth of the river, is gradually being developed for tourism, including a golf course.

The Church of Nossa Senhora da Victoria stands near the banks of the Kwanza River in Massanganu, Province of Cuanza-Norte, Angola.

==Wildlife==
Rich biodiversity has been found in the Angolan river, according to research reported on the Science and Development Network website. Angola&#x27;s first biodiversity tally of the Kwanza River has so far found 50 fish species. Researchers from the National Fishing Research Institute and the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity say genetic testing may reveal new species. Sportfishing includes tarpon.

==Legacy==
Angola&#x27;s currency, the kwanza, is named after the river. The river is also the namesake of the provinces of Cuanza Norte (&quot;Cuanza North&quot;) and Cuanza Sul (&quot;Cuanza South&quot;).

<doc id="515780" wikidata="Q962305" url="?curid=515780" title="1962 Quebec general election">
<text>The 1962 Quebec general election was held on November 14, 1962, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Jean Lesage, was re-elected, defeating the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; (UN) led by Daniel Johnson, Sr.

In an unusual move, the election was called just two years after the previous 1960 general election. Lesage sought a mandate for the Nationalization of the electricity industry, with the slogan Maîtres chez nous (Masters in Our Own Home), declaring it a single issue important enough to stake his political career on it.

A few days before the election, the &quot;Union Nationale&quot;&#x27;s chief organizer André Lagarde was arrested for fraud. The Liberals claimed this was proof of lingering corruption dating from the Maurice Duplessis era, but the UN cried foul and was vindicated after the election. However, the incident may well have contributed to the UN&#x27;s defeat.

The Liberal Party won an increased number of seats and a higher percentage of the popular vote, and the nationalization program was carried out. Future &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; founder René Lévesque served as a cabinet minister in the Lesage government and spearheaded the nationalization of power utilities for a great expansion of Hydro-Québec.
&quot;Action provinciale&quot;, a new group founded by Hertel Larocque (a former secretary of Camillien Houde), fielded 11 candidates in the election but failed to gather a significant number of votes. Johnson opted not to have the UN join forces with it, keeping in mind the failure the Liberals had had in attempting the same manoeuvre with the Créditistes in 1956. However, Social Credit was still a force to reckon with even while not campaigning on the provincial scene, and Johnson did not hesitate to use its vocabulary in his speeches while on the campaign trail.

<text>The Rotopress is a waste collection vehicle manufactured by the German company Faun Umwelttechnik and formerly by KUKA. It uses a rotating drum to compact waste, and has its origin in a series of designs built by KUKA since the 1920s. The name &quot;Rotopress&quot; was first used in 1977, and has been used on subsequent models by the company, and by other companies under licence.

==Description==
The Rotopress is a continuously compacting garbage truck. A massive rotating drum compacts and stores the garbage. The outer edge of the drum acts as the loading hopper, and paddles on the drum convey the waste around an auger of decreasing pitch until it is small enough to be forced through a small ring-shaped gap between the drum and the auger, where it then enters the main section of the drum, which has helically shaped internal paddles which move the now-crushed waste towards the front of the vehicle. When emptying the drum, the direction of rotation is reversed.

==History==
The German company Keller und Knappich, Augsburg (KUKA), founded in 1898, built its first rotary waste collection vehicle in 1927. Production of the original model continued until 1949, and its replacement, the Type 210, was launched the following year. Subsequent models included the &quot;Shark&quot;, introduced to the United States in the 1960s and so-named due to the serrated loading auger which was designed to tear up garbage sacks and other large soft items as they were dragged into the drum. The first model to carry the &quot;Rotopress&quot; name was the Type 215G, in 1977, and the name has been the company&#x27;s subsequent rotary-drum designs including the 205.

Both the Shark and the Rotopress have been produced under licence by other manufacturers, including the British company, Laird Anglesey Ltd, based in Anglesey.

In 1983 KUKA&#x27;s municipal vehicles division was acquired by Faun GmbH and production was moved to Osterholz. Manufacturing of waste collection vehicles became part of Faun&#x27;s Environmental Technology sector, which was sold in 1987 to the Schmidt family (former owners of Faun) as a separate company with the name Faun Umwelttechnik. This was acquired by the Kirchhoff group in 1994. Laird Anglesey was acquired by Faun Eurotec, a subsidiary of Faun Umwelttechnik, in 1996.

By 1999, over 33,500 Rotopress bodies had been built. One of the key market niches which the Rotopress is aimed at is the collection of Green waste, as the continuous tumbling action of the rotary drum system mixes and homogonizes biodegradable material for composting.

FAUN have licensed the design to Fujicar Ltd (a division of Fuji Heavy Industries) who manufacture a smaller scale version of the rotary drum compactor specifically for the Japanese market (where the bodies are typically mounted on small truck or light van chassis). These clone versions are notable for the drum turning in the opposite direction (anticlockwise instead of clockwise) compared to the full-size European versions.

==Products==
As of 2011, the Rotopress is produced a range of sizes from smallest to largest: 008, 514, 516, 518, 520 and 522, as well as the Rotopress Dualpower hybrid vehicle, and the Rotopress 541 which is produced as either a stationary intermediate waste store or a semi-trailer.

<doc id="515788" wikidata="Q1128174" url="?curid=515788" title="Electron gun">
<text>An electron gun (also called electron emitter) is an electrical component in some vacuum tubes that produces a narrow, collimated electron beam that has a precise kinetic energy.

The largest use is in cathode-ray tubes (CRTs), used in older television sets, computer displays and oscilloscopes, before the advent of flat-panel displays. Electron guns are also used in field-emission displays (FEDs), which are essentially flat-panel displays made out of rows of extremely small cathode-ray tubes. They are also used in microwave linear beam vacuum tubes such as klystrons, inductive output tubes, travelling-wave tubes, and gyrotrons, as well as in scientific instruments such as electron microscopes and particle accelerators.

Electron guns may be classified by the type of electric field generation (DC or RF), by emission mechanism (thermionic, photocathode, cold emission, plasmas source), by focusing (pure electrostatic or with magnetic fields), or by the number of electrodes.

== Design ==

A direct current, electrostatic thermionic electron gun is formed from several parts: a hot cathode, which is heated to create a stream of electrons via thermionic emission; electrodes generating an electric field to focus the electron beam (such as a Wehnelt cylinder); and one or more anode electrodes which accelerate and further focus the beam. A large voltage difference between the cathode and anode accelerates the electrons away from the cathode. A repulsive ring placed between the electrodes focuses the electrons onto a small spot on the anode, at the expense of a lower extraction field strength on the cathode surface. There is often a hole through the anode at this small spot, through which the electrons pass to form a collimated beam before reaching a second anode, called the collector. This arrangement is similar to an Einzel lens.

An RF electron gun consists of a Microwave cavity, either single cell or multi-cell, and a cathode. In order to obtain a smaller beam emittance at a given beam current, a photocathode is used. An RF electron gun with a photocathode is called a photoinjector. 

Photoinjectors play a leading role in X-ray Free-electron lasers and small beam emittance accelerator physics facilities.

== Applications ==
The most common use of electron guns is in cathode-ray tubes, which were widely used in computer and television monitors before the advent of flat screen displays. Most color cathode-ray tubes incorporate three electron guns, each one producing a different stream of electrons. Each stream travels through a shadow mask where the electrons will impinge upon either a red, green or blue phosphor to light up a color pixel on the screen. The resultant color that is seen by the viewer will be a combination of these three primary colors.

An electron gun can also be used to ionize particles by adding electrons to, or removing electrons from an atom. This technology is sometimes used in mass spectrometry in a process called electron ionization to ionize vaporized or gaseous particles. More powerful electron guns are used for welding, metal coating, 3D metal printers, metal powder production and vacuum furnaces.

Electron guns are also used in medical applications to produce X-rays using a linac (linear accelerator); a high energy electron beam hits a target, stimulating emission of X-rays.

Electron guns are also used in travelling-wave tube amplifiers for microwave frequencies.

== Measurement and detection ==
A nanocoulombmeter in combination with a Faraday cup can be used to detect and measure the beams emitted from electron gun and ion guns.

Another way to detect electron beams from an electron gun is by using a phosphor screen which will glow when struck by an electron.
