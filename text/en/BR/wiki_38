<text>The virginals is a keyboard instrument of the harpsichord family. It was popular in Europe during the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods.

==Description==
A virginals is a smaller and simpler, rectangular or polygonal, form of harpsichord. It has only one string per note, running more or less parallel to the keyboard, on the long side of the case. Many, if not most, of the instruments were constructed without legs, and would be placed on a table for playing. Later models were built with their own stands.

==Mechanism==
The mechanism of the virginals is identical to the harpsichord&#x27;s, in that its wire strings are plucked by a set of plectra, mounted in jacks. Its case, however, is rectangular or polygonal, and the single choir of strings—one per note—runs roughly parallel to the keyboard. The strings are plucked either near one end, as with the harpsichord, or in the case of the muselar, nearer the middle, producing a more flute-like tone that&#x27;s reduced in upper harmonics.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name is obscure. It may derive from the Latin meaning a rod, perhaps referring to the wooden jacks that rest on the ends of the keys, but this is unproven. Another possibility is that the name derives from the word &quot;virgin&quot;, as it was most commonly played by young women, or from its sound, which is like a young girl&#x27;s voice (). A further view is that the name derives from the Virgin Mary, as it was used by nuns to accompany hymns in honour of the Virgin.

In England, during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, any stringed keyboard instrument was often described as a virginals, and could equally apply to a harpsichord or possibly even a clavichord or spinet. Thus, the masterworks of William Byrd and his contemporaries were often played on full-size, Italian or Flemish harpsichords, and not only on the virginals as we call it today. Contemporary nomenclature often referred to a &quot;pair of virginals&quot;, which implied a single instrument, possibly a harpsichord with two registers, or a &quot;double virginals&quot; (see below).

== History ==
Like the harpsichord, the virginals has its origins in the psaltery, to which a keyboard was applied, probably in the 15th century. The first mention of the word is in Paulus Paulirinus of Prague&#x27;s (1413–1471) &quot;Tractatus de musica&quot;, of around 1460, where he writes: &quot;The virginal is an instrument in the shape of a clavichord, having metal strings which give it the timbre of a clavicembalo. It has 32 courses of strings set in motion by striking the fingers on projecting keys, giving a dulcet tone in both whole and half steps. It is called a virginal because, like a virgin, it sounds with a gentle and undisturbed voice.&quot; The Oxford English Dictionary records its first mention in English in 1530, when King Henry VIII of England purchased five instruments so named. Small, early virginals were played either in the lap, or more commonly, rested on a table, but nearly all later examples were provided with their own stands. The heyday of the virginals was the latter half of the 16th century to the later 17th century, until the high Baroque period, when it was eclipsed in England by the bentside spinet, and in Germany, by the clavichord.

==Types==
===Spinet virginals===
Spinet virginals (not to be confused with the spinet) were made principally in Italy (), England and Flanders (). The keyboard is placed left of centre, and the strings are plucked at one end, although farther from the bridge than in the harpsichord. This is the more common arrangement for modern instruments, and an instrument described simply as a &quot;virginal&quot; is likely to be a spinet virginals. The principal differences in construction lie mainly in the placement of the keyboard: Italian instruments invariably had a keyboard that projected from the case, whilst northern virginals had their keyboards recessed in a keywell. The cases of Italian instruments were made of cypress wood and were of delicate manufacture, whilst northern virginals were usually more stoutly constructed of poplar. Early Italian virginals were usually hexagonal in shape, the case following the lines of the strings and bridges, and a few early Flemish examples are similarly made. From about 1580 however, nearly all virginals were rectangular, the Italian models often having an outer case like harpsichords from that country. There are very few surviving English virginals, all of them late. They generally follow the Flemish construction, but with a vaulted lid.

===Muselars===

Muselars (also &quot;muselaar&quot;) were made only in northern Europe. Here, the keyboard is placed right of centre and the strings are plucked about one-third the way along their sounding length. This gives a warm, rich, resonant sound, with a strong fundamental and weak overtones. However, this comes at a price: the jacks and keys for the left hand are inevitably placed in the middle of the instrument&#x27;s soundboard, with the result that any mechanical noise from these is amplified. In addition to mechanical noise, from the string vibrating against the descending plectrum, the central plucking point in the bass makes repetition difficult, because the motion of the still-sounding string interferes with the ability of the plectrum to connect again. An 18th-century commentator (Van Blankenberg, 1739) wrote that muselars &quot;grunt in the bass like young pigs&quot;. Thus the muselar was better suited to chord-and-melody music without complex left hand parts. The muselar could also be provided with a stop called the &quot;harpichordium&quot; (also &quot;arpichordium&quot;), which consists of lead hooks being lightly applied against the ends of the bass strings in such a manner that the string vibrating against the hook produces a buzzing, snarling sound.

Muselars were popular in the 16th and 17th centuries and their ubiquity has been compared to that of the upright piano in the early 20th century, but like other types of virginals they fell out of use in the 18th century.

===Ottavini===
Both Italian and northern schools produced a miniature virginals called the . were pitched an octave higher than the larger instrument. In the Flemish tradition these were often – perhaps always – sold together with a large virginals, to which the could be coupled (see Double virginals below). In the Italian tradition, an was usually a separate instrument of its own, being fitted in its own outer case, just like larger Italian instruments.

===Double virginals===
The Flemish school, in particular the Ruckers family, produced a special type of virginals known as &quot;Mother and Child&quot; (). This consisted of two instruments in one: a normal virginals (either spinet or muselar) with one 8′ register, and an with one 4′ register. The smaller was stored (rather like a drawer) under the soundboard next to the keyboard of the larger instrument, and could be withdrawn and played as a separate keyboard instrument. However, the two instruments could also be coupled together, the being placed over the strings of the larger virginals (once the jackrail was removed), so that the jacks of the latter passed through a slot in the bottom of the . The jacks of the larger instrument now activated the keys of the , so that both instruments sounded simultaneously, giving a more brilliant effect.

Among the instruments in the inventory of Henry VIII of England, drawn up by Philip Van Wilder in 1553, there are mentions of &quot;twoo pair of double virginalles&quot;, &quot;one new pair of double virginalles&quot;, and other obscure references. These predate the earliest extant Mother and Child virginal by 30 years (the 1581 Hans Ruckers), and the earliest known double manual harpsichords by about 60 years. The term may have referred to the number of stops on the instrument, or perhaps its range.

==Compass and pitch==
The keyboard compass of most virginals was C2/E2 to C6 (45 notes, 4 octaves), which allowed the performance of the music contemporarily available for the instruments. The lower octave was tuned to a short octave, so that the bottom E sounded C2, the bottom F sounded D2, and the bottom G sounded E2, thus allowing some frequently-required low bass notes to take over the positions of keys that were rarely used in the contemporary repertory and avoiding building a larger instrument. Some Italian models ranged from C2 to F6 (54 notes, octaves).

Virginals were available in various sizes. The Dutch organist and harpsichordist Class Douwes (circa 1650 – circa 1725) mentions instruments from nominal down to . The pitch differences between the models offered by the Ruckers workshops were by no means arbitrary, but corresponded to the musical intervals of a tone, a fourth, a fifth, an octave, and a ninth. Pitch assignments have been suggested for these instruments based on scalings provided by Douwes. Most modern instruments are full-sized ones at 8′ pitch or at 4′ pitch, although there are no surviving Ruckers instruments at the 4&#x27; pitch, and most probably none were ever made by his workshop.

==Decoration==


Whilst many early virginals throughout Europe were left in plain wood, they were soon provided with rich decoration, which may have contributed to the survival of many such instruments. From mouldings on case edges, jackrails and namebattens to adornment with ivory, mother-of-pearl, marble, agate, tortoiseshell or semi-precious stones, not to mention intricate painting, no expense was spared by those who could afford it.

Most Flemish virginals had their soundboards painted with flowers, fruit, birds, caterpillars, moths and even cooked prawns, all within blue scalloped borders and intricate blue arabesques. Many of these motifs appear to be resurrection symbols. Natural keys were normally covered in bone, and sharps were of oak or, less commonly, chestnut. The case exteriors were usually marbled, whilst the inside was decorated with elaborate block-printed papers. Occasionally the inside of the lid bore a decorative scene; more often it was covered with block-printed papers embellished with a Latin motto, usually connected with morality or music. Mottos could also be applied to the keywell batten. Some typical mottos include:

* (&quot;Thus passes the glory of the world&quot;)
* (&quot;Music is the sweet solace of labour&quot;)
* (&quot;Music is the gift of God&quot;)

The Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer was one among several who produced paintings including examples of virginals.

There was no such &quot;standard decoration&quot; for Italian virginals. Where there was an outer case, it was often this that was decorated, leaving the actual instrument plain (typically for Venetian virginals). Cases could be decorated with paintings of grotesques, classical scenes, or marquetry, but soundboards were rarely painted. Keytops could be of plain boxwood, or lavishly decorated (as was often the case in northern Italy) with ivory, ebony, mother-of-pearl or tortoiseshell among other materials.

Traditionally, the soundboards of both northern and Italian virginals were pierced with a rose, sometimes two or three in early days. The rose had no acoustic function, and was purely decorative. Although these were a throwback to the rose in the medieval lute, they were never carved integrally as part of the soundboard. In Italian instruments they were usually constructed by combining multiple layers of pierced parchment, so that the final result looked like a gothic rose window, or an inverted wedding cake. In Flemish instruments, the rose was usually cast from lead and gilded, and usually incorporated the maker&#x27;s initials.

==Composers and collections of works==
The word &quot;virginals&quot; could historically be applied to any stringed keyboard instrument, and since there was very rarely any indication of instrumentation on musical scores in the heyday of the virginals, there are hardly any compositions that can be said to be specifically for that instrument. Indeed, nearly all the keyboard music of the renaissance sounds equally well on harpsichord, virginals, clavichord or organ, and it is doubtful if any composer had a particular instrument in mind when writing keyboard scores. A list of composers for writing for the virginals (among other instruments) may be found under virginalist. Although the &quot;virginalist school&quot; usually refers to English composers, it would not be incorrect to use the word in connection with some continental keyboard composers of the period, such as Girolamo Frescobaldi and Giovanni Picchi, or Samuel Scheidt and Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck.

Out of the some dozen so-called English &quot;virginal books&quot;, only &quot;Elizabeth Rogers&#x27; Virginal Book&quot; actually bears the word in its original title: the other collections were attributed the name by music scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries.

<text>Artistic freedom (or freedom of artistic expression) can be defined as &quot;the freedom to imagine, create and distribute diverse cultural expressions free of governmental censorship, political interference or the pressures of non-state actors.&quot; Generally, artistic freedom describes the extent of independence artists obtain to create art freely. Moreover, artistic freedom concerns &quot;the rights of citizens to access artistic expressions and take part in cultural life—and thus [represents] one of the key issues for democracy.&quot; The extent of freedom indispensable to create art freely differs regarding the existence or nonexistence of national instruments established to protect, to promote, to control or to censor artists and their creative expressions. This is why universal, regional and national legal provisions have been installed to guarantee the right to freedom of expression in general and of artistic expression in particular. In 2013, Ms Farida Shaheed, United Nations special rapporteur to the Human Rights Council, presented her &quot;Report in the field of cultural rights: The right to freedom of expression and creativity&quot; providing a comprehensive study of the status quo of, and specifically the limitations and challenges to, artistic freedom worldwide. In this study, artistic freedom &quot;was put forward as a basic human right that went beyond the &#x27;right to create&#x27; or the &#x27;right to participate in cultural life&#x27;.&quot; It stresses the range of fundamental freedoms indispensable for artistic expression and creativity, e.g. the freedoms of movement and association. &quot;The State of Artistic Freedom&quot; is an integral report published by arts censorship monitor on an annual basis.

== Definition of artistic freedom ==

Repeatedly, the terms &quot;artistic freedom&quot; and &quot;freedom of artistic expressions&quot; are used as synonyms. Their underlying concepts &quot;art&quot;, &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;expression&quot; comprise very vast fields of discussion: &quot;Art is a very &#x27;subtle&#x27;—sometimes also symbolic—form of expression, suffering from definition problems more than any other form.&quot; As a result, &quot;[i]t is almost impossible to give a satisfying definition of the concept art. It is even more difficult to define the concepts artistic creativity and artistic expression.&quot; UNESCO&#x27;s 2005 Convention on the Diversity of Cultural Expressions defines cultural expressions as &quot;those expressions that result from the creativity of individuals, groups and societies, and that have cultural content&quot; while the latter &quot;refers to the symbolic meaning, artistic dimension and cultural values that originate from or express cultural identities.&quot; In the context of the freedom of (artistic) expressions, &quot;[t]he word expression in the first instance refers to verbalisation of thoughts.&quot; Freedom of artistic expression &quot;may mean that we have to tolerate some art that is offensive, insulting, outrageous, or just plain bad. But it is a small price to pay for the liberty and diversity that form the foundation of a free society.&quot; Officially, UNESCO defines artistic freedom as &quot;the freedom to imagine, create and distribute diverse cultural expressions free of governmental censorship, political interference or the pressures of non-state actors. It includes the right of all citizens to have access to these works and is essential for the wellbeing of societies.&quot; UNESCO puts forth that &quot;artistic freedom embodies a bundle of rights protected under international law.&quot; These include:

* The right to create without censorship or intimidation;
* The right to have artistic work supported, distributed and remunerated;
* The right to freedom of movement;
* The right to freedom of association;
* The right to the protection of social and economic rights;
* The right to participate in cultural life.

== Legal frameworks to protect and promote artistic freedom ==
Legal frameworks to protect and promote artistic freedom reflect the conviction that &quot;[c]ulture constitutes one process of, and space for, democratic debate. The freedom of artistic expression forms its backbone. There is compelling evidence that participation in culture also promotes democratic participation as well as empowerment and well-being of our citizens.&quot; Farida Shaheed wrote: &quot;Artists may entertain people, but they also contribute to social debates, sometimes bringing counter-discourses and potential counterweights to existing power centres.&quot; Moreover, she emphasized that &quot;the vitality of artistic creativity is necessary for the development of vibrant cultures and the functioning of democratic societies. Artistic expressions and creations are an integral part of cultural life,which entails contesting meanings and revisiting culturally inherited ideas and concepts.&quot; According to , &quot;[p]opulists and nationalists, who often portray human rights as a limitation on what they claim is the will of the majority, are on the rise globally. As this phenomenon rises, artists continue to play an important role in expressing alternative visions for society.&quot; This is why &quot;artists are sometimes responsible for radical criticism.&quot; As a result, artistic expressions and artists are suffering censorship and violations worldwide. Artists are among the first to be silenced by repressive regimes: the poets, playwrights and painters who challenge the status quo are often lone workers, and as such easy targets for an authoritarian state or violent oppressor. When their views fail to accord with the mainstream, the artist is also vulnerable to the censorship of the mob. 
Thù&quot; shows that &quot;[i]t is not only governments violating the right to artistic freedom. 2016 saw a worrying amount of actions by non-state actors, ranging from militant extremists to peaceful community groups, against art and artists. In some instances, authorities censored artists based on requests or the interference from civil society groups.&quot; Based on this development, &quot;[m]ajor sources of international law across the board recognize freedom of artistic creativity explicitly, or implicitly, as an inherent element of the right to freedom of expression. In these instruments, the individual right to express ideas creatively is often irrevocably linked with the right to receive them.&quot; The growing importance of artistic freedom as a specific right is reflected by the introduction of the role of the UN Special Rapporteur in the field of culture in 2009, and other rapporteurs, notably the Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression.

=== UN instruments ===
==== Artistic freedom as a specific right ====
According to Farida Shaheed, the most explicit legal provisions protecting the right to the freedom indispensable for artistic expression and creativity are the following:

* Article 15 (3) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR): States &quot;undertake to respect the freedom indispensable for ... creative activity&quot;;
* Article 19 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR): &quot;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information (...) in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.&quot;
* Article 13 and 31 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child;
* Article 13 (1) of the American Convention on Human Rights (ACHR);
* Article 14 of the ACHR Protocol in the area of Economic, Social and Cultural Provisions;
* Article 42 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights;
* Article 27 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR): the universal right &quot;to enjoy the arts&quot;;
*Article 49 of the Case of Karataş v. Turkey by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) emphasizes that the &quot;[freedom of artistic expression] (...) affords the opportunity to take part in the public exchange of cultural, political and social information and ideas of all kinds. (...) Those who create, perform, distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society. Hence there is an obligation on the State not to encroach unduly on the author&#x27;s freedom of expression.&quot;

In September 2015, 57 UN Member States reaffirmed the right to freedom of expression including creative and artistic expression through a joint statement. Additionally, in 2015, the Carthage Declaration on the Protection of Artists in Vulnerable Situations was adopted in Tunis.

==== Artistic freedom as a pillar of the right to freedom of expression ====
The following legal instruments do not specifically mention artistic freedom but rather understand it as a pillar of freedom of expression in general related to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. They aim to guarantee the right to freedom of expression or the right to participate in cultural life without specific reference to the arts.

*Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR);
* Article 9 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;
* Article 9 and 17 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights;
* Article 32 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights;
* The right &quot;to seek and develop cultural knowledge and expressions and to share them with others, as well as to act creatively and take part in creative activity&quot; formulated by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;
*Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

=== UNESCO instruments ===

==== 1980 UNESCO Recommendation Concerning the Status of the Artist ====
Artistic freedom first appeared as a distinct right in UNESCO&#x27;s 1980 Recommendation concerning the Status of the Artist underlining &quot;the essential role of art in the life and development of the individual and of society&#x27; and the duty of States to protect and defend artistic freedom.&quot; Although not a binding instrument, the Recommendation is an important reference in defining artists&#x27; rights across the spectrum worldwide. The 1980 Recommendation serves as a reference for policy development and as a basis for new formulations of cultural policies:Member States, recognizing the essential role of art in the life and development of the individual and of society, accordingly have a duty to protect, defend and assist artists and their freedom of creation. For this purpose, they should take all necessary steps to stimulate artistic creativity and the flowering of talent, in particular by adopting measures to secure greater freedom for artists, without which they cannot fulfill their mission, and to improve their status by acknowledging their right to enjoy the fruits of their work.

==== 2005 UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions ====
The 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions acknowledges that &quot;the diversity of cultural expressions can only be promoted if human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed.&quot; A guiding principle of the 2005 Convention is that &quot;cultural diversity can be protected and promoted only if human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression, information and communication, as well as the ability of individuals to choose cultural expressions, are guaranteed.&quot; In this context, governance of culture refers to policies and measures governments establish to promote and to protect all forms of creativity and artistic expressions. The most recent UNESCO Convention in the field of culture and ratified by 146 Parties, it frames the formulation and implementation of different types of legislative, regulatory, institutional and financial interventions to promote the emergence of diverse cultural and creative industry sectors around the world. As a result, it aims to ensure participation in cultural life and to support access to diverse cultural expressions (film, music, performing arts, etc.).

=== National legislative measures to promote artistic freedom ===
Similar to the aforementioned universal instruments to protect artists and artistic freedom, &quot;[i]n national constitutions (...), freedom of artistic creativity is often located within the strongly-protected right to freedom of expression.&quot; Certain countries also &quot;recognize the freedom of artistic expression within the ambit of the right to science and culture.&quot; The following national legislative measures are listed in alphabetical order. The list is to be completed.

==== Burkina Faso ====

Adopted on 23 May 2013 by &quot;Direction générale des arts (DGA)&quot;, the decree &quot;Décret portant statut de l&#x27;artiste au Burkina Faso&quot; envisages improving the social protection and the living conditions of artists, particularly the social security of employed artists and freelancers, the return of social contributions of artists and the complement dispositive for mutual accountability.

==== Canada ====

In Canada, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects artistic expression.

==== France ====

In July 2016, France amended its legislation in order to extend it with the legal protection of artistic freedom, architecture and heritage. For the first time in international law, artistic expressions are established as public goods and the &quot;dissemination of artistic creation is free&quot;. This implies not only that artists are free to create but also that the wider public has access to it. As a result, art and artistic expressions cannot be censored or simply excluded from exhibits and other events.

==== Germany ====

Article 5 of the German Basic Law contains a special paragraph that connects the right to freedom of expression with the right to freely develop the arts and sciences.&quot;

==== Indonesia ====

On 12 January 2012, Indonesia ratification UNESCO 2005 Convention. When 2017, Indonesia published Cultural Advancement Law based on principles 11 values, including guaranteeing freedom of expression, ensuring the protection of cultural expression, providing cultural facilities and infrastructure, also funding sources for cultural advancement.

==== Mexico ====

On 19 June 2017, Mexico published its &quot;Ley General de Cultura y Derechos Culturales&quot; promising strong protection for artistic freedom and artists and cultural professionals, a provision specifically needed given the alarming conditions under which Mexican artists, journalists and cultural professionals currently work.

==== Spain ====

On 6 September 2018, the Spanish Congress of Deputies unanimously ratified a proposal assigned to elaborate a &quot;Estatuto del Artista y del Profesional de la Cultura&quot;. Broadly, the decree aims to protect and promote artists with regard to taxation, their work security and legal protection.

==== Sweden ====

Article 1 (2) of the Swedish Fundamental Law explicitly includes the freedom of artistic creation as part of the key purposes of freedom of expression: &quot;The purpose of freedom of expression under this Fundamental Law is to secure the free exchange of opinion, free and comprehensive information, and freedom of artistic creation.&quot;

==== Togo ====

On 20 June 2016, Togo adopted its &quot;Statut de l&#x27;artiste&quot;. Its major objective is to acknowledge artists as individuals and their moral role in society, their contributions towards the intellectual sphere protected by copyright. It defines the rights and duties linked to artistic professions and aims to promote creativity and to protect artists socially.

==== Tunisia ====

Adopted in 2014, article 42 of the Tunisian Constitution states: &quot;The right to culture is guaranteed. The freedom of creative expression is guaranteed. The State encourages cultural creativity and supports the strengthening of national culture, its diversity and renewal, in promoting the values of tolerance, rejection of violence, openness to different cultures and dialogue between civilizations.&quot;

==== United States ====

In the U.S., the first amendment protects artistic expression. According to the Court, freedom of artistic creativity is an element of the respect for freedom of self-expression, one of the core values of the First Amendment. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has never considered artistic freedom as a distinct category akin to political or commercial speech: &quot;it rather addresses the various forms of art in their relation to the First Amendment on a contextual basis.&quot;

== Challenges to artistic freedom ==

The International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN) explains the purpose of its existence with the following statement:Writers and artists are especially vulnerable to censorship, harassment, imprisonment and even death, because of what they do. They represent the liberating gift of the human imagination and give voice to thoughts, ideas, debate and critique, disseminated to a wide audience. They also tend to be the first to speak out and resist when free speech is threatened.
Freemuse&#x27;s report (2018) demonstrates that artistic freedom &quot;&quot;&quot;is being shut down in every corner of the globe, including in the traditionally democratic West. According to Freemuse&#x27;s 2016 report, the music industry is the main target of serious violations, and second to film in overall violations, including non-violent censorship. The most serious violations included the murder of Pakistani Qawwali singer Amjad Sabri and the killing of Burundi musician Pascal Treasury Nshimirimana. In 2019, Karima Bennoune, UN Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, underlines that &quot;the freedom of artistic expression and creativity of persons with disabilities, women or older persons&quot; remains significantly restricted. She states that &quot;many cultural rights actors have not incorporated a gender perspective into their work, while many women&#x27;s rights advocates have not considered cultural rights issues.&quot; Referring to Freemuse&#x27;s 2016 report, UNESCO stresses that &quot;laws dealing with terrorism and state security, defamation, religion and &#x27;traditional values&#x27; have been used to curb artistic and other forms of free expression.&quot;

Moreover, new digital technologies, including social media platforms, are challenging artistic freedom: &quot;Art in the online and digital space continues to challenge authorities and corporations who are quick to react by closing down expression rather than using it as an opportunity to foster it.&quot; Social media and music streaming channels, like Instagram and SoundCloud are becoming the platforms on which artists publicly display and promote their work. However, they also bring with them threats to rights and freedoms. Online trolls often intimidate artists to withdraw their work. Additionally, growing digital surveillance has a corrosive effect on artistic freedom. Many platforms have established mechanisms, such as Instagram&#x27;s guidelines on &#x27;standards of behavior&#x27; whose formulations are very vague. This provides disproportionate power to individuals and organizations who use the platform&#x27;s reporting processes to get individual artworks removed, and sometimes entire accounts blocked. In addition, the impact of algorithms on diversity of content is another area of concern: platforms display a plethora of cultural offerings, but also control not only sales but also communication and the recommendation algorithms (e.g. adapting offered content to the profile of each internet user). These algorithms finally serve to promote certain contents while oppressing others.

In conclusion, new digital technologies—while providing a platform for the distribution of artistic content—may interrupt the flow of ideas of artists and curtail their artistic freedom.

In the 10th Anniversary UN Report on Cultural Rights, Ole Reitov, former executive director of Freemuse, underscores the progressive fact that &quot;artistic freedom is no longer a &#x27;marginalized&#x27; issue in the &#x27;world of freedom of expression&#x27;&quot;. Since Farida Shaheed&#x27;s report and inspired by lobbying from arts and human rights NGOs, efforts to promote artistic freedom have multiplied across the entire United Nations system: &quot;The UN Universal Periodic Review provides an opportunity for NGOs, among others, to make submissions on States&#x27; failures to meet human rights standards, including artistic freedom. New calls for a UN Action Plan on the Safety of Artists and Audiences (similar to the one for journalists) have been put forward.&quot; As UNESCO&#x27;s Global Report &quot;Re|shaping Cultural Policies&quot; (2018) shows, the number and capacity of organizations monitoring artistic freedom is increasing. &quot;In this domain as well, cities are taking valuable initiatives by providing safe havens for artists at risk.&quot; As the list above shows, &quot;measures to support the economic and social rights of artists are appearing increasingly in national legislation, especially in Africa.&quot;

== Monitoring artistic freedom ==
Despite the progress made and legal instruments established to promote and protect freedom of artistic expressions, &quot;there is urgent need for monitoring and surveillance, essential if these freedoms are to become a permanent reality.&quot;

Karima Bennoune notes that the increasing number of reported attacks perpetrated by State and non-State actors against cultural professionals reflects the boosting capacity of monitoring artistic freedom. She states the UNESCO global reports monitoring the implementation of the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of Cultural Expressions have been &quot;[o]f particular relevance&quot;. The reports provide a monitoring framework comprising four overarching goals to enhance cultural policies worldwide. One of these goals aims to &quot;Promote Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms&quot; and encompasses artistic freedom as an &quot;area of monitoring&quot; incorporating core indicators to measure achievements regarding the rights and protection of artists. Additionally, the framework relates artistic freedom to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 of the UN 2030 Agenda, which aims to &quot;&#x27;Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels&quot;. Specifically, the SDG&#x27;s target 16.10 aims to &quot;ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements&quot;.

Additionally, there are many other initiatives advocating and monitoring artistic freedom. Alongside other organizations documenting violations against freedom of artistic expression (such as Arterial Network, Artists at Risk Connection, PEN International and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions), Freemuse is an independent international organization particularly monitoring the freedom of expression of musicians and composers worldwide. &quot;Freemuse&#x27;s reports collated from all over the world show that artists are increasingly facing censorship, persecution, incarceration or death, because of their work.&quot;

There is also monitoring carried out by Koalisi Seni, an institution that advocates for arts policy in Indonesia. From the results of its monitoring, Koalisi Seni notes, in Indonesia during the pandemic, social restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 became a new excuse for the state to suppress arts activities. There are also notes that stigmatization of art often occurs because art is considered to damage people&#x27;s morals and invite immorality.

In order to monitor the actions taken to implement the 1980 Recommendation concerning the Status of the Artists, the Secretariat of the 2005 UNESCO Convention (see below) runs a global survey every four years gathering information from Members States, NGOs and INGOs and prepares a report, which is then submitted to the General Conference.

<text>The black gram or urad bean (&quot;Vigna mungo&quot;) is a bean grown in South Asia. Like its relative the mung bean, it has been reclassified from the &quot;Phaseolus&quot; to the &quot;Vigna&quot; genus. The product sold as black gram is usually the whole urad bean, whereas the split bean (the interior being white) is called white lentil. It should not be confused with the much smaller true black lentil (&quot;Lens culinaris&quot;).

Black gram originated in South Asia, where it has been in cultivation from ancient times and is one of the most highly prized pulses of India. It is very widely used in Indian cuisine. In India the black gram is one of the important pulses grown in both Kharif and Rabi seasons. This crop is extensively grown in the southern part of India and the northern part of Bangladesh and Nepal. In Bangladesh and Nepal it is known as mash daal. It is a popular &quot;daal&quot; (legume) side dish in South Asia that goes with curry and rice as a platter. Black gram has also been introduced to other tropical areas such as the Caribbean, Fiji, Mauritius, Myanmar and Africa mainly by Indian immigrants during the Indian indenture system.

==Description==
It is an erect, suberect or trailing, densely hairy, annual bush. The tap root produces a branched root system with smooth, rounded nodules. The pods are narrow, cylindrical and up to six centimetres long. The plant grows 30–100 cm with large hairy leaves and 4–6 cm seed pods. While the urad dal was, along with the mung bean, originally placed in &quot;Phaseolus&quot;, it has since been transferred to &quot;Vigna&quot;.

==Cooking==

&quot;Vigna mungo&quot; is popular in Northern India, largely used to make &quot;dal&quot; from the whole or split, dehusked seeds. The bean is boiled and eaten whole or, after splitting, made into &quot;dal&quot;; prepared like this it has an unusual mucilaginous texture.

Its usage is quite common in Dogra Cuisine of Jammu and Lower Himachal region. The key ingredient of &quot;Dal Maddhra&quot; or &quot;Maah Da Maddhra&quot; dish served in Dogri Dhaam of Jammu is &quot;Vigna mungo&quot; lentil. Similarly, another dish &quot;Teliya Maah&quot; popular in Jammu &amp; Kangra uses this lentil. Traditionally, Vigna Mungo Lentil is used for preparing Dogra style Khichdi during Panj Bhikham and Makar Sankranti festival in Jammu and Lower Himachal. Besides, fermented Vigna Mungo paste is also used to prepare &quot;Lakhnapuri Bhalle&quot; or &quot;Lakhanpuri Laddu&quot; ( a popular street food of Jammu region).

In Uttarakhand Cuisine, &quot;Vigna mungo&quot; is used for preparing traditional dish called &quot;Chainsu&quot; or &quot;Chaisu&quot;.

In North Indian cuisine, it is used as an ingredient of &quot;Dal makhani,&quot; which is a Modern restaurant style adaptation of Traditional &quot;Sabut Urad Dal&quot; of Northern India.

In Bengal, it is used in &quot;kalai ruti&quot;, &quot;biulir dal&quot;. In Rajasthan, It is one of the ingredients of &quot;Panchmel dal&quot; which is usually consumed with &quot;bati&quot;. In Pakistan, it is called Dhuli Mash ki daal and used to make laddu Pethi walay and Bhalla.

It is also extensively used in South Indian culinary preparations. Black gram is one of the key ingredients in making idli and dosa batter, in which one part of black gram is mixed with three or four parts of idli rice to make the batter. Vada or udid vada also contain black gram and are made from soaked batter and deep-fried in cooking oil. The dough is also used in making papadum, in which white lentils are usually used.

In the Telugu states, it is eaten as a sweet in the form of laddoos called Sunnundallu or Minapa Sunnundallu.

== Nutrition ==

It contains high levels of protein (25 g/100 g dry weight), potassium (983 mg/100 g), calcium (138 mg/100 g), iron (7.57 mg/100 g), niacin (1.447 mg/100 g), thiamine (0.273 mg/100 g), and riboflavin (0.254 mg/100 g). Black gram complements the essential amino acids provided in most cereals and plays an important role in the diets of the people of Nepal and India. Black gram is also very high in folate (628 μg/100 g raw, 216 μg/100 g cooked).

==Use in medieval crucible construction==
In medieval India, this bean was used in a technique to facilitate making crucibles impermeable.

<text>USS &quot;Hoel&quot; (DDG-13), named for Lieutenant Commander William R. Hoel USN (1824–1879), was a guided missile destroyer.

&quot;Hoel&quot; was laid down by Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan, on 3 August 1959, launched on 4 August 1960 by Mrs. Harry H. Long, granddaughter of Lieutenant Commander Hoel and commissioned on 16 June 1962, Commander Allen W. Slifer in command.

&quot;Hoel&quot; served as plane guard for aircraft carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in Sea Dragon operations, patrolled on Search and rescue duties and carried out Naval Gunfire Support missions during the Vietnam War.

==History==

===1960s===
After fitting out at Boston, &quot;Hoel&quot; got underway for her first homeport, San Diego, putting in at Norfolk, Virginia; Mayport and Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Guantanamo Bay; Cartagena, Colombia; Canal Zone; and Acapulco, Mexico, during the voyage. During the passage from Cartagena to the Canal Zone she came upon sailing yacht &quot;Stardrift&quot; becalmed and adrift en route to Sydney, Australia, from London. &quot;Hoel&quot; towed the craft to safety in Panama.

&quot;Hoel&quot; arrived in San Diego on 11 September 1962 and spent the ensuing months completing the various inspections, tests, and trials by the Board of Inspection and Survey. When successful firing of ASROC and Tartar missiles completed her qualification and acceptance trials, &quot;Hoel&quot; joined the ready 1st Fleet.

After a 3-week cruise to Esquimalt, British Columbia, &quot;Hoel&quot; spent April and May 1963 in Pearl Harbor conducting special exercises. She then returned to waters off San Diego to participate in the Presidential Demonstration held for President John F. Kennedy.

The months of July, August, and part of September were spent at Long Beach Naval Shipyard for the post-shakedown availability assigned each new ship approximately 1 year after commissioning. At this time improved fire-control radars were installed and tested by successful missile firings. &quot;Hoel&quot; departed Long Beach on 17 October 1963 for duty in the Western Pacific to serve as the flagship of Commander Destroyer Division 12.

In ensuing years she alternated deployments in the Far East with operations off the West Coast. Her 1966 deployment to the Western Pacific began when she departed San Diego 28 July. On September she was on search and rescue patrol off Da Nang, Vietnam. On 8 December the guided missile destroyer became naval gunfire support ship in the Corps I area. She fired 2,100 rounds destroying at least 20 enemy structures and two trench networks; damaging 61 buildings, three bunkers, eight trench networks, and five roads; and killing 24 Viet Cong while wounding seven. &quot;Hoel&quot; retired to Hong Kong 21 December but headed for Yankee Station the day after Christmas to screen the aircraft carrier . On this patrol she helped to rescue a pilot after his A-4 Skyhawk had crashed.

On 19 October 1987, &quot;Hoel&quot; was one of 4 ships participating in Operation Nimble Archer, destroying 2 militarized oil platforms in the Persian Gulf. Twenty minutes before the surface action group opened fire, USS &quot;Thach&quot; radioed the platforms, telling the crews to abandon them. At 2 pm, four U.S. destroyers opened fire: USS &quot;Hoel&quot;, USS &quot;Leftwich&quot;, USS &quot;Kidd&quot;, and USS &quot;John Young&quot;. One platform was boarded by U.S. special forces, who recovered teletype messages and other documents, then planted explosives to destroy the platform. Air cover was provided by the cruisers USS &quot;Long Beach&quot; and USS &quot;William H. Standley&quot;, two F-14 Tomcat fighters and an E-2 Hawkeye from USS &quot;Ranger&quot;. The high-explosive shells did negligible blast damage to the steel-lattice platforms, but eventually set them ablaze. &quot;Hoel&quot; fired nearly 400 rounds during this operation.

===Decommissioning===
&quot;Hoel&quot; was decommissioned on 1 October 1990, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 November 1992 and sold on 20 June 1994.

&quot;Hoel&quot; was one of seven decommissioned US naval vessels purchased by Charleston Shipbuilders Inc. (CSI) in 1994. The corporation planned to use the ships&#x27; power plants to generate electricity which they would then sell commercially. In theory, each ship would be able to generate approximately fifty megawatts of electricity, enough to supply approximately 150,000 households.

===Power Barge===
The city of Manaus, Brazil had rapidly expanded since it was declared a tax-free zone by the Brazilian government in 1967. Eletronorte, the local power utility service, had been unable to keep up with the increasing demand and Manaus experienced frequent blackouts. In 1997, CSI negotiated a thirty million dollar contract to supply power to Manaus.

The ex-&quot;Hoel&quot; was chosen as the ship to be used. However, the plans of both companies were too optimistic. Eletronorte announced that ex-&quot;Hoel&quot; would be delivering power within only a few days of its arrival in Manaus. CSI had failed to test the ship&#x27;s equipment fully before departing for Brazil and failed to appreciate how many repairs the ship&#x27;s 38-year-old power plant might require. The ship ended up needing weeks of work after its arrival in Brazil before it could begin generating power and numerous repairs after that. Repairs were much more difficult to accomplish in Brazil because the parts and technicians now had to be brought in from CSI&#x27;s headquarters back in the United States. Meanwhile, many people in Manaus had become angry over the failed power delivery and there were violent protests. The ex-&quot;Hoel&quot; was never able to generate more than a quarter of the electricity that had been promised and that only periodically. After a year of failed attempts, Eletronorte cancelled its contract with CSI.

<text>USS &quot;Buchanan&quot; (DDG-14) was a guided missile destroyer in service with the United States Navy from 1962 to 1991. She was sunk as a target in 2000.

==History==
&quot;Buchanan&quot; was named for Admiral Franklin Buchanan and was laid down by Todd-Pacific Shipbuilding at Seattle, Washington on 23 April 1959, launched on 11 May 1960, and commissioned on 7 February 1962. She was commissioned by the Commandant, Thirteenth Naval District, Rear Admiral George C. Towner.

===1962–1965===
After completing her final outfitting at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, &quot;Buchanan&quot; got underway for Long Beach Naval Shipyard, California, on 25 March 1962. She moored at her new homeport of San Diego, on 5 April. The destroyer reported for duty and was assigned to serve as the flagship of Destroyer Squadron 15, Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 7, United States First Fleet. On 25 May 1962 the destroyer put to sea for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for her shakedown cruise.

The &quot;Buchanan&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 30 May and participated in the dedication of the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial. She returned to San Diego on 6 June to continue her shakedown before proceeding to Puget Sound on 17 September 1962. &quot;Buchanan&quot; returned to San Diego on 5 November 1962, where she was placed on unrestricted availability with the fleet.

The &quot;Buchanan&quot; began operating in 1963 in the area off Southern California before departing for her first deployment to the western Pacific. She put out for Pearl Harbor with the destroyer on 4 April. Once at Pearl Harbor, she was placed in drydock for a few days (9–14 April).

The &quot;Buchanan&quot; returned to sea in company with &quot;Somers&quot; on 18 April and operated with Task Force 77.3.1, consisting of attack aircraft carrier , radar picket destroyers and , for the 21st commemoration of the Battle of the Coral Sea at Sydney, Australia. As the task force neared Sydney, &quot;Buchanan&quot; detached on 27 April and steamed independently for Melbourne, Australia. After the festivities in Sydney concluded, she rendezvoused with &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and the newly formed Task Group 77.6 en route to Guam on 13 May.

Over the next two months, the &quot;Buchanan&quot; accompanied TF 77.6 to Guam (22–26 May), Naval Station Subic Bay (27 May–1 June) and Manila, Philippines (25–29 June), Hong Kong (13–20 June), and Yokosuka (9–15 July) and Sasebo, Japan (22–29 July 1963). On 5 August, she tested her Tartar missiles in the Okinawa Missile Range before putting into Okinawa (9–12 August), Beppu (22–26), and Iwakuni, Japan (26–26 August). Afterward she returned to Yokosuka (7–21 September) for upkeep, giving her crew shore leave. The &quot;Buchanan&quot; returned to Sasebo (2–3 October) and Yokosuka (9–16 October) before putting into Subic Bay on 21 October. She departed Subic Bay to make a port call at Hong Kong on 29 October.

While at Hong Kong, the destroyer&#x27;s rest was abruptly cut short. On 1 November 1963, members of the Republic of Vietnam military staged a coup against the regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem. In response, the U.S. Navy deployed a flotilla off the mouth of the Mekong River for the potential evacuation of American citizens and service members. As part of this operation, The &quot;Buchanan&quot; departed Hong Kong escorting the aircraft carrier with &quot;Southerland&quot; and on 2 November. The coup had ended with assassination of Diệm, his brother Ngȏ Ðình Nhu, and Col. Hồ Tần Quyền, the commander of the Vietnamese navy. With reassurance from the new leadership under General Dương Văn Minh that order had been restored and alliances unchanged, the Navy reduced its presence off of South Vietnam.

The &quot;Buchanan&quot; departed the area on 5 November for Subic Bay. On 15 November 1963 she left Subic Bay for San Diego arriving on 27 November. After the holidays, &quot;Buchanan&quot; operated out of San Diego before moving to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard at Hunters Point, California (USA), for overhaul (7 May–22 September). Several days after emerging from overhaul, she rejoined Destroyer Squadron 15 to participate in fleet exercise &quot;Union Square&quot; (28 September – 1 October 1964).

===Vietnam War===
On 5 January 1965, Buchanan departed with destroyers , and for Pearl Harbor. She left for Subic Bay on 13 January with , , , , and &quot;Chevalier&quot;, putting into their destination on 26 January. On 1 February &quot;Buchanan&quot; began her tour of duty patrolling, providing escort and plane guard services in the South China Sea. As the situation worsened in Southeast Asia, President Lyndon B. Johnson began increasing the number of American troops in South Vietnam. On 8 March 1965 the 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade landed at Da Nang.

In between operations, Buchanan visited Yokosuka (28 April–7 May, 18–26 June, and 23–26 July), Hong Kong (9–13 June and 16–19 July), Subic Bay (14 June), and Okinawa (28 June). On 27 July 1965 &quot;Buchanan&quot; set course for the United States. She stopped at Pearl Harbor for a few days (2–3 August) before mooring at San Diego on 9 August. In mid-September, the destroyer entered Long Beach for overhaul (16 September–11 November) then spent the rest of the year conducting local operations. For her time in the South China Sea, Buchanan was awarded the Armed Services Expeditionary Forces Medal for supporting air strike operations over Vietnam.

During the early months of 1966, &quot;Buchanan&quot; operated out of her homeport conducting routine operations in the eastern Pacific. During April the destroyer participated in the fleet exercise &quot;Gray Ghost&quot; (12–22 April 1966). In June she was steaming for the western Pacific with &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;Southerland&quot; for another six-month deployment (11 June–21 December). On 1 July, &quot;Buchanan&quot; operated as a plane guard in Dixie Station, off the Mekong delta, for the aircraft carrier as her aircraft executed air strikes in South Vietnam. &quot;Buchanan&quot; then moved north for operations in Yankee Station off Da Nang and the coast of North Vietnam (7–21 July). She broke from her combat operations to serve as the flagship of the United States Seventh Fleet during a port visit to Bangkok, Thailand, on 25–29 July 1966. Over the next several months, &quot;Buchanan&quot; alternated her operations between Yankee and Dixie stations. Wrapping up combat duty, she put into Hong Kong for a few days&#x27; rest (21–26 November) before working her way home via Okinawa (28–29 November), Yokosuka (1–4 December), and Pearl Harbor (15 December). She put into San Diego on 21 December 1966 where she remained until shifting to Long Beach Naval Shipyard for overhaul (15 March–5 August 1967), returning to San Diego for sea trials, refresher training for her crew, and local operations.

====1967 collision====
While underway in a column formation with &quot;Southerland&quot; on the night of 14 September 1967 &quot;Buchanan&quot; collided with fishing vessel &quot;Holiday&quot;. The civilian craft claimed that the destroyer was at fault for the collision and that the Navy was culpable for the resulting damages. An ensuing investigation determined that &quot;Buchanan&quot; was the vessel with the right of way and that &quot;Holiday&quot; bore the burden to avoid the collision. Lookouts on the destroyer also indicated in subsequent interviews that there was no one in the fishing boat&#x27;s wheel house at the time of the collision. The sailors&#x27; accounts also reported bright lights on the stern of &quot;Holiday&quot; and seeing crew members working on deck, perhaps preparing bait.

Although all indications exonerated &quot;Buchanan&quot;, the ship&#x27;s crew clearly made errors that contributed to the accident. It was revealed that the officer of the deck lacked the experience and training to properly handle the situation. Lt. Victor J. Monteleon was qualified to command the ship while she operated independently but not certified to operate in formation with other ships. At the time of the accident, the sea was calm with visibility estimated to have been better than 12 km. The destroyer was steaming in a darkened condition with her navigation lights burning. As the vessels converged, &quot;Buchanan&quot;″s Combat Information Center properly and continually reported Holiday&#x27;s position, speed and bearing. Monteleon served as the junior officer of the deck, and Lt. Thomas S. Ballard, USNR, were also tracking &quot;Holiday&quot; visually from the port wing. The two officers discussed changing course but took no action. Once Monteleon realized that a collision was imminent, he ordered the conn to right full rudder with all engines ahead at full speed.

The Navy investigation into the collision determined that, although the destroyer had the right of way, Monteleon had committed several grievous errors. The most serious was the failure to notify his commanding officer, Capt. William A. Spencer, of the situation. According to Spencer&#x27;s night orders, he was to be notified of any visual or radar contacts within of the ship. Additionally, Monteleon failed to take action to avoid the collision. He also did not sound a danger signal, an option provided to him in accordance to the rules of the road. As the legalities were being sorted out, Buchanan went about her schedule. On 3 November she entered Hunters Point for alterations until 20 December 1967. &quot;Buchanan&quot; spent the rest of the year in San Diego on holiday leave and preparing for another deployment.

&quot;Buchanan&quot; departed San Diego for Southeast Asia on 27 January 1968. During her deployment, she participated in Operation Sea Dragon (25 October 1966 – 31 October 1968) to disrupt the flow of supplies going from North Vietnam to support communist operations in South Vietnam. She also provided naval gunfire support (NGFS) to ground troops fighting in South Vietnam, most notably during the first phase of the Tet Offensive and the Battle of Huế (30 January – 3 March 1968). During one tour providing NGFS, &quot;Buchanan&quot; came under fire from an enemy shore battery on 29 May. The ship sustained shrapnel damage to the heating and cooling system of the No. 1 cell of her ASROC launcher. Several of her antennae and electrical cables were damaged but no crewmembers were harmed. In response, &quot;Buchanan&quot; silenced the enemy position with 20 rounds from her 5-inch guns.

In addition to her gunnery operations, &quot;Buchanan&quot; also served as plane guard in Gulf of Tonkin for (5–11 and 14–18 March), , and (15–17 May), in addition to and (20 June–1 July 1968). Buchanan retired to Subic Bay (9–17 June) for battle damage repairs after another tour providing NGFS to the I Corps Tactical Zone (30 May–7 June). During her time in the western Pacific, &quot;Buchanan&quot; was afforded rest and recreation at Hong Kong (7–11 May, 16–21 July) and Yokosuka, Japan (26–28 July) before setting a course home, stopping at Midway Atoll on 2 August and Pearl Harbor on 5 August along the way. Once back in San Diego on 11 August 1968, her sailors were granted post-deployment leave for four weeks.

On 18 March 1969 &quot;Buchanan&quot; was once again underway for the western Pacific with &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot;, , &quot;Chevalier&quot;, and &quot;Southerland&quot;. During this deployment, the destroyer once again served as a plane guard for &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin (8–24 May) and provided NGFS for troops in the I and II Corps Tactical Zones. Her guns supported the men of the 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment and the 173rd Airborne Brigade in the area of Da Nang (16 June–16 July 1969). During these operations Buchanan sent more than five thousand 127 mm shells downrange toward the enemy. &quot;Buchanan&quot; made several port calls for upkeep and rest for her weary crewmen at Subic Bay (30 April–8 May, 2–4 September), Sasebo (28 May–8 June, 5–16 August, 25–30 August) and Hong Kong (18–24 July) before steaming for San Diego on 4 September 1969. Once back at her home port on 18 September, &quot;Buchanan&quot; underwent a survey and inspection (24–26 November), ending the year working with destroyer tender .

&quot;Buchanan&quot; spent the first half of 1970 operating in the relative calm of the eastern Pacific. She continued tender duty with &quot;Samuel Gompers&quot; (1–3 January) and (3–6 April). Installation of her new system began on 4 January and was completed by 1 February after which she put to sea to provide plane guard services for &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; (6–9 February). It was not until 13 July 1970 that &quot;Buchanan&quot; was once again deployed to the western Pacific and Southeast Asia. Once at Yankee Station, she returned to providing plane guard for &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot;. During 9–19 August, the team joined anti-submarine warfare support aircraft carrier . Several months later (21 October–5 November), &quot;Buchanan&quot; again steamed with &quot;Shangri-La&quot;.

Between plane guard and escort duties, &quot;Buchanan&quot; provided NGFS for the US Army&#x27;s Americal Division, 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized), and 1st Marine Division in the I Corps Tactical Zone (15 September–6 October). She shifted south to the IV Corps region, off the Mekong River delta, to provide gunnery support to the South Vietnamese 9th and 21st Divisions (19 November–1 December 1970). &quot;Buchanan&quot;″s sailors didn&#x27;t spend their entire deployment in the combat zone. They were given slight respites with several visits to Subic Bay, the longest being for upkeep (21 August–1 September, 1–10 October) before returning to combat duty. The crew also had the opportunity for rest and recreation at Hong Kong (13–18 October) and Singapore (9–19 November). On 4 December 1970, &quot;Buchanan&quot; set a course for her homeport from Subic Bay, making stops at Guam on 7 December, Midway on 12 December, and Pearl Harbor (14–15 December). She arrived at San Diego on 20 December 1970, giving her crew holiday leave and undergoing upkeep until 25 January 1971.

During 1971 &quot;Buchanan&quot; remained in the eastern Pacific. She operated with , fleet ballistic missile submarine , and submarine (25 January–9 February), making a brief visit to Naval Station Treasure Island, California (26–28 January). She put in for an overhaul at San Francisco Naval Shipyard (22 April–3 September 1971). &quot;Buchanan&quot; returned to her homeport for sea trials (18–17 September), Refresher Training (18 October–9 December) and local operations for the rest of 1971.

==== 1972 combat ====
&quot;Buchanan&quot; departed for the western Pacific on 17 February 1972 with &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and . She returned to combat duty off Vietnam on 17 March 1972. On 30 March, the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) launched the Easter Offensive, sending invading forces to attack multiple locations in South Vietnam. In response, the U.S. initiated Operation Freedom Train, to strike targets in southern North Vietnam and the invading forces. On 1 April, &quot;Buchanan&quot;, in concert with guided missile destroyer provided gunnery support to cover the withdrawal of the South Vietnamese 57th Regiment from Firebase Gio Linh, near Ðông Hà. The position fell into the enemy hands where it remained for the duration of the war.

As the PAVN advanced, attention shifted to the defense of Ðông Hà on 2 April. On the ground, Captain John W. Ripley, USMC, an advisor with the 3rd Vietnam Marine Corps Battalion, coordinated NGFS along with 1st Lt. Joel Eisentein, USMC, commander of Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company 1–2. The offshore task force provided one hour of sustained fire on two bridges being used by enemy troops to push back allied forces. In the heat of battle, Capt. Ripley sighted four enemy amphibious light tanks, Soviet-made PT-76, moving along the Cam Lo riverbank east of Ðông Hà. Ripley called in the coordinates to the task force. Buchanan and her compatriots quickly shifted their fire on to the new targets with great results. According to Ripley, &quot;we could see them burning clearly. My counterparts, the marine battalion commander and the tank battalion commander, were both observing this superb display of naval gunfire. When the tanks were hit and burning, both were surprised and elated in seeing the potential of naval gunfire. I was to receive many requests for naval gunfire by the Vietnamese after this attack.&quot; Ripley sent a letter to the captain of the &quot;Buchanan&quot;, CDR William James Thearle, on 8 September 1972 describing the NGF support received during the operation.
On 17 April 1972 &quot;Buchanan&quot; moved north to shell the vital bridges around the city of Vinh in North Vietnam, in company with and &quot;Hamner&quot;. Around midday, &quot;George K. Mackenzie&quot; shifted her fire toward an observation tower she had spotted on the island Hon Mat. Shortly afterward, two enemy patrol boats, presumed to be &quot;Shanghai&quot;-class motorboats, appeared in the vicinity around Dao Bien Island. &quot;George K. Mackenzie&quot; fired on the approaching boats causing them to reverse course and retreat. Just over ten minutes later, &quot;Buchanan&quot; began taking fire from a shore battery. A shell airburst put a two and half foot hole in the destroyer. SN Leonard R. Davis was killed. Lt. Robert S Nemmers, Supply Corps, SA Vincent G. Guerrero, SD3 Primicitis V. Beltran, EM Frederick J. Shortreed Jr., GM3 Danny K. Hammond, and CS3 Frank S. Musiol were wounded. Shropshire&#x27;s wound to one of his feet was severe enough for him to be transferred to guided missile cruiser for further treatment. The body of Seaman Davis was also transferred to &quot;Chicago&quot;. For her remaining time in Southeast Asia, &quot;Buchanan&quot; served as a picket ship and plane guard supporting the air strikes associated with Operation Linebacker (2 May–23 October 1972). On 29 August the destroyer put into Hong Kong (28 August–4 September) for some rest before beginning her long voyage home.

The &quot;Buchanan&quot; returned to her home port on 25 September 1972, where she conducted local operations until redeploying to Vietnam on 25 July 1973. In the Gulf of Tonkin, &quot;Buchanan&quot; provided escort services for and served as an antiaircraft picket ship (13 September – 26 October 1973). She also made port calls to Kaohsiung, Taiwan (24 September – 1 October) and Mombasa, Kenya (22–26 December). Continuing her deployment in into 1974, Buchanan visited Singapore (7–11 January), Hong Kong (2–7 February), Kaohsiung (9–10 February), and Yokosuka (15–19 February). Bringing the deployment to a close, Buchanan got underway for San Diego on 22 February 1974. With heavy weather slowing her trip home, she did not arrive until 8 March. The ship remained in the eastern Pacific for the rest of the year making only two port calls to Santa Barbara, California (28 June – 1 July), for the Santa Barbara Sports Festival, and San Francisco (26–29 September), ending the year with holiday leave (14–31 December 1974).

===1975–1991===
The first six months of 1975, &quot;Buchanan&quot; moved to Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an overhaul. During this period, her 127 mm guns and ASROC launchers were removed along with her aging Mark X Identification Friend or Foe, SAMID, and other communications equipment. The latter were replaced with a new Mark III Advanced Information Management System and up-to-date communications gear. On 28 June 1975, &quot;Buchanan&quot; underwent sea trials, tests and training to ensure she was quickly back up to fighting condition. The destroyer and her crew went on holiday leave to close out the year (19–31 December 1975). On the first day of 1976, &quot;Buchanan&quot; moved back to Long Beach for some final touches to her overhaul then remained close to home conducting routine operations for the entirety of 1976.

On 11 April 1977 &quot;Buchanan&quot; once again set a course for the western Pacific with , and , along with frigates , , and . After a brief stop at Pearl Harbor (19–20 April), she steamed with her companions for Subic Bay. While en route, Buchanan came alongside ammunition ship for replenishment. After the resupply began, &quot;Buchanan&quot; lost power in her aft engineering plant causing the ship to execute an emergency breakaway. A span wire between the vessels did not release so &quot;Shasta&quot;″s deck crew cut it away. The trailing cable wound around the destroyer&#x27;s port shaft damaging the rope guard. The shaft was locked and divers were deployed to remove the cable. Unable to free the shaft, she was rerouted to Naval Base Guam for repairs (3–15 May 1977).

&quot;Buchanan&quot; departed Guam on 16 May and was able to rejoin her task force in the South China Sea for &quot;MAULEX 3–77&quot;, a joint American-Philippine amphibious exercise. &quot;Buchanan&quot; supplied simulated gunfire support for the insertion of reconnaissance teams. A few days later, she joined in a joint anti-submarine warfare exercise with the Republic of China Navy (30 May–3 June) and then posed as a Soviet missile cruiser during &quot;MULTIPLEX 5–77&quot; (18–25 June). That same month, the destroyer got to show off her Tartar missiles system by shooting down two drones, one of which she recorded as a direct hit (26–28 June). &quot;Buchanan&quot; took part in one last multinational exercise, &quot;SEA SIAM VI&quot; (19–21 July) before tying up at Subic Bay for maintenance and repairs (29 July–21 August 1977). After the long break, she threw lines and headed back to sea to make a port call to Hong Kong (24–28 August 1977). Returning to duty, &quot;Buchanan&quot; participated in exercises &quot;MULTIPLEX 7–77&quot; (26–29 September) and &quot;ASWEX J1-78&quot; (28 October–1 November). She also served as a screen ship for Constellation (6–26 September) and provided escort service in the East China Sea (30 September–2 October) and in the northern Sea of Japan (25–27 October). Despite her busy schedule, &quot;Buchanan&quot; was afforded some breaks to visit Kaohsiung (27–28 May), Pattaya Beach, Thailand (14–18 July), Fukuoka, Japan (3–6 October 1977). While in Fukuoka, the ship opened her decks to the public and members of the crew paid a goodwill visit to a local orphanage. After one last port call at Yokosuka (2–5 November), &quot;Buchanan&quot; steamed for home, arriving on 21 November and staying in port for the rest of 1977.

The following year was comparatively quiet for &quot;Buchanan&quot; as she spent nearly the entirety of 1978 operating along the California coast when not in port at San Diego. On 20 May her crew&#x27;s dependents observed the destroyer in action while underway for a Family Cruise day. Venturing north, she made a brief port call to Seattle (27–29 May). In early November, &quot;Buchanan&quot; steamed out of American waters to visit Mazatlán, Mexico (3–5 November 1978). On her final day at the Mexican port town (5 November), an estimated 500 bales of cotton caught fire on the waterfront. &quot;Buchanan&quot;″s sailors leapt into action and helped extinguish the blaze. The local U.S. Consul and Defense Attaché Office in Mexico City commended the crew for their service to the local community. &quot;Buchanan&quot; returned to the U.S. to end the year with holiday leave (16–31 December 1978).

On 20 February 1979 &quot;Buchanan&quot; was underway once again for the western Pacific. While en route to Pearl Harbor (2–4 March), a companion guided missile frigate &quot;Brooke&quot;, suffered a failure to her main steam condenser. &quot;Buchanan&quot; came to the aid of the disabled frigate by towing her for two-and-a-half days while she was repaired. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Buchanan&quot; and her companions moved to Guam (19–28 March). On 29 March, she was underway to serve as an observer for the test launch of three UGM-27 Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Over the next several months, &quot;Buchanan&quot; participated in multiple exercises off the Korean Peninsula (7–10 May), Okinawa (16–23 July) and in the Tasman Sea (18–23 August 1979). She also made several port visits putting into Hong Kong (19–24 May), Chinae (5–6 June) and Busan, South Korea (10–15 June), before mooring at Yokosuka for upkeep and maintenance ( 18 June–5 July 1979). In early August, &quot;Buchanan&quot; opened her decks to the public while at Port Ville, New Hebrides, Vanuatu (6–9 August). In three days the destroyer received of over 500 visitors. Afterward she stopped at Auckland, New Zealand (13–17 August) before tying up at Pago Pago, American Samoa, on 28 August. The following day, &quot;Buchanan&quot; was underway for Pearl Harbor (28 August–3 September) where she embarked family members for a Tiger Cruise back to San Diego (3–9 September 1979). On 8 November, she began the first phase of an overhaul at San Diego.

To continue her overhaul, &quot;Buchanan&quot; moved to Long Beach on 1 January 1980. During this period (1 January–26 November), the destroyers guns and missile launchers were reworked. Harpoon anti-ship missile and Super Rapid Offboard Countermeasures (SRBOC) systems were installed. The addition of SRBOC to &quot;Buchanan&quot; provided her with state-of-the-art chaff and infrared countermeasures for defense against missile attacks. Following her overhaul, she remained in local waters conducting routine operations, training, and sea trials. On 19 September 1981, the destroyer set a course for the western Pacific with supply ship , ammunition ship , frigate and destroyer . The formation arrived at Subic Bay on 17 October 1981. &quot;Buchanan&quot; took part in training operations in the Sea of Siam (3–6 November), Sea of Japan (9–22 December) and gunnery exercises at Tabones Island, Philippines (16–19 November). In between duty, she visited Sattahip (2 November) and Pattaya, Thailand (7–10 November). When she was in port at Pusan (5–8 December), sailors from Buchanan and Holt delivered food and clothing to a local orphanage as part of Operation Handclasp. &quot;Buchanan&quot; also visited Sasebo (15–19 and 22–26 December) before mooring at Hong Kong to celebrate the New Year on 31 December 1981.
&quot;Buchanan&quot; began 1982 with gunnery training at Tabones Island on 11 January. She put into Singapore for a brief rest (20–24 January) before returning to sea for more exercises until 11 March when she steamed toward home. Buchanan arrived at San Diego on 23 March 1982. She returned to Asia again on 2 April 1983 where she operated in the China and Philippine seas (2 April–31 July). On 1 August she was underway with battleship for Pearl Harbor. From Hawaii, the destroyer and her mighty companion steamed to Rodman Naval Station, Panama (17 August–1 September 1983). Buchanan provided escort services to U.S. Army landing craft underway to Honduras (2–8 September). Wrapping up her deployment, she made her way home to San Diego (9–17 September) where she immediately entered a period of upkeep and giving her crew leave to be with their families. After only a few periods at sea, &quot;Buchanan&quot; was placed on restricted availability for the rest of the year on 23 November 1983.

After spending the first five months of 1984 operating out of San Diego, &quot;Buchanan&quot; moved to Hawaiian waters to take part in Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) &#x27;84, anti-submarine warfare exercises and missile tests. (30 May–15 August). She returned to San Diego and began preparing for deployment on 18 October. In December, &quot;Buchanan&quot; was steaming in the Sea of Japan. She put into Hong Kong (5–7 December) and spent the holidays at Subic Bay (18 December 1984 – 12 January 1985). In February Buchanan found herself in the middle of a diplomatic confrontation between New Zealand and the United States.

====1985 dispute with New Zealand====

In February, 1985 a port visit request by the United States for &quot;Buchanan&quot; was refused by New Zealand, as &quot;Buchanan&quot; was capable of launching nuclear depth bomb-equipped ASROCs. Following the victory of the New Zealand Labour Party led by David Lange at elections in 1984, the Parliament of New Zealand enacted a law which barred nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships from using New Zealand ports, citing the dangers of nuclear weapons and continued nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Given that the United States Navy refused to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard ships, these laws in effect refused access to New Zealand ports for all ships of the United States Navy.

After consultations with Australia and after negotiations with New Zealand broke down, the United States announced that it was suspending its ANZUS treaty obligations to New Zealand until United States Navy ships were readmitted to New Zealand ports, citing that New Zealand was &quot;a friend, but not an ally&quot;.

Despite these troubles, &quot;Buchanan&quot; continued her busy schedule unabated. She participated in multiple regional exercises in the South China Sea and the Sea of Siam (21 January–26 April 1985). While departing Sydney, she was once again involved in an anti-nuclear controversy. As Buchanan was steaming out of the port in a column formation with 13 other vessels, an ultralight aircraft dove on her to drop a &quot;paint bomb.&quot; The pilot missed the target and was later taken into custody by Australian authorities. &quot;Buchanan&quot; rounded out her deployment with port calls to Brisbane, Australia (14–17 March), Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, on 22 March, Subic Bay (2–21 April), and Manila, Philippines (27–28). She returned to Subic Bay on 30 April for upkeep before departing for Pearl Harbor on 12 May. &quot;Buchanan&quot; arrived at San Diego on 25 May and conducted local operations until shifting to Long Beach to begin another overhaul on 5 August 1985.

With her overhaul completed on 17 June, &quot;Buchanan&quot; was put through her paces in the eastern Pacific for all of 1986. During 18 June–31 July, she underwent several inspections and took part in training exercises. On 26 July, the destroyer tested her weapons at the Nanoose Range, British Columbia. &quot;Buchanan&quot; was allowed a few breaks while away from her homeport during visits at the Canadian cities Vancouver (16–20 July) and Esquimalt on 30 July. In between these visits, she stopped at Bangor, Washington (26–28 July) for upkeep before steaming back to San Diego on 31 July 1986, where she remained for the rest of the year.

While &quot;Buchanan&quot; lay at San Diego (1 January–13 July 1987) she celebrated her 25th birthday on 6 February. During this time she also prepared to be deployed the western Pacific once again but this time with a different destination. Instead of her usual stomping grounds, the destroyer was headed to the Arabian Sea. As the Iran–Iraq War raged on, Iran had become a threat to Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. In response to threat, the U.S. executed Operation Earnest Will to provide protection to the tankers and ensure that commercial shipping lanes remained open. Buchanan departed San Diego on 14 July 1987 as a member of Battle Force Echo with . The battle force put into Subic Bay (10–12 August) and Singapore (16–19 August) before arriving on station in the North Arabian Sea on 25 August. During her time in the region, &quot;Buchanan&quot; visited Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory (8–16 September), Mogadishu, Somalia (20–21 October) and Victoria, Seychelles (25–29 October 1987). On 14 November, the destroyer began work her way back to the eastern Pacific stopping at Phuket, Thailand (18–23 November), Penang, Malaysia (24–26 November), Hong Kong (2–6 December), and Subic Bay (9–11 December). She arrived in San Diego just in time to celebrate the New Year on 30 December 1987.

After spending the next 13 months in the eastern Pacific and the Southern California Operations area (1 January 1988 – 24 February 1989), &quot;Buchanan&quot; departed for what would be her last deployment to the western Pacific. She returned to the North Arabian Sea to rejoin Earnest Will on 3 June 1989. &quot;Buchanan&quot; spent only few days in the area, departing on 14 June to return home. By 24 August 1989, she was back at San Diego. &quot;Buchanan&quot; spent the rest of the year operating off the Californian coast and took part in Fleet Week at San Francisco on 7–11 October. With her career winding down, the destroyer remained in the eastern Pacific. On 26 February, she was at the Nanoose Range for Project 371 torpedo test (26 February–1 and 7–8 March). During the spring and summer of 1990, &quot;Buchanan&quot; took part in drug interdiction patrols along the U.S. western seaboard. She put into Tacoma, Washington, for the 75th Annual Daffodil Festival (6–10 April) and represented the national &quot;Just Say No To Drugs&quot; campaign at Portland, Oregon (11–13 May 1990).

While back in her homeport, &quot;Buchanan&quot; hosted HMS &quot;Ariadne&quot; (F72), when the British frigate visited San Diego (29 May–4 June). On 4 August, she got underway for a dependents cruise with &quot;Ranger&quot; to exhibit operations after which she remained in port for the rest of 1990. &quot;Buchanan&quot; never returned to sea under her own power. From 1 January until 1 October 1991, she served as a training ship for SEAL Team One and SEAL Team Five to practice boarding operations while she underwent preparations to be decommissioned. On 1 October, &quot;Buchanan&quot; was decommissioned alongside and . She was towed to Hawaii on 15 October and was stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; on 20 November 1992.

===Decommissioning and fate===

&quot;Buchanan&quot; was decommissioned on 1 October 1991 and stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; on 20 November 1992. On 13 June 2000 she was allocated to be sunk as a target during RIMPAC 2000 as part of Operation SINKEX. She remained afloat after being hit by three AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-surface missiles, three Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and a laser-guided bomb in the Pacific Ocean off Hawaii. She finally was scuttled on 14 June 2000 by the detonation of of explosives that had been placed aboard her. She lay off Hawaii in a depth of .

<text>Rob Zombie (born Robert Bartleh Cummings; January 12, 1965) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, filmmaker, and actor. His music and lyrics are notable for their horror and sci-fi themes, and his live shows have been praised for their elaborate shock rock theatricality. He has sold an estimated 15 million albums worldwide. He rose to fame as a founding member and the frontman of heavy metal band White Zombie, with whom he released four albums.

His first solo effort, the 1996 song &quot;Hands of Death (Burn Baby Burn)&quot; (with Alice Cooper), was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. His debut solo studio album, &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot;, was released in 1998; White Zombie disbanded a month later. &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot; sold over 3 million copies worldwide and spawned three singles. His second studio album, &quot;The Sinister Urge&quot;, was released in 2001 and became his second platinum album in the U.S. His third studio album, &quot;Educated Horses&quot;, was released in 2006 and marked a departure from his earlier style. It became his third album to enter the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but saw a decrease in sales compared to his previous releases. His fourth studio album, &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe 2&quot;, released in 2010 and peaked at no. 8 in the U.S. A remix album, &quot;Mondo Sex Head&quot;, released in 2012 and was followed by his fifth album &quot;Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor&quot; in 2013. In 2016, Zombie released his sixth album, &quot;The Electric Warlock Acid Witch Satanic Orgy Celebration Dispenser&quot;, and his seventh studio album, &quot;The Lunar Injection Kool Aid Eclipse Conspiracy&quot;, was released in 2021.

Zombie directed the horror film &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; in 2000, though the controversial project was not released until 2003, and has since been described as a cult classic. Zombie followed the film with two sequels in his &quot;Firefly&quot; trilogy: &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot; (2005) and &quot;3 from Hell&quot; (2019). After the success of his first two films he directed &quot;Halloween&quot; (2007), a remake of the classic 1978 horror film. The film became his highest-grossing to date, though was generally received negatively by critics. He later directed &quot;Halloween II&quot; (2009), which failed to match the commercial success of its predecessor. Zombie has also directed the films &quot;The Haunted World of El Superbeasto&quot; (2009), &quot;The Lords of Salem&quot; (2012), &quot;31&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Munsters&quot; (2022).

== Early life ==
Zombie was born Robert Bartleh Cummings in Haverhill, Massachusetts, on January 12, 1965, the oldest son of Louise and Robert Cummings. His younger brother, Michael, uses the stage name Spider One and is the lead singer of Powerman 5000. Growing up, he had a fascination with horror films and &quot;always wanted to be Alice Cooper, Steven Spielberg, Bela Lugosi, and Stan Lee&quot;. He has said of his childhood, &quot;I didn&#x27;t aspire to be anything. I was just a dopey kid. Basically everyone seemed amazing to me as a kid. I grew up in some nowhere town... anybody that even seemed remotely famous just seemed like they were on another planet.&quot;

Zombie&#x27;s parents worked at a carnival. In 1977, when he was 12, his parents chose to leave after a riot broke out at the carnival and tents were set on fire. He said of the experience, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s pulling out guns, and you could hear guns going off. I remember this one guy we knew, he was telling us where to go, and some guy just ran up to him and hit him in the face with a hammerjust busted his face wide open. My parents packed up real quick, and we took off.&quot; He later elaborated, &quot;I think someone just got ripped off for a lot of money on the gambling tents and they came back later and set the tents on fire [and] it turned into this big riot. [...] It was super violent and crazy and I think that was when my parents were like, &#x27;You know what? We might be able to find something better to be doing here.&#x27; Because me and my brother are in the middle of this. Things are on fire, people beating the crap out of each other.&quot;

Cummings graduated from Haverhill High School in 1983. He moved to New York City and began attending Parsons School of Design, where he met eventual bandmate and girlfriend Sean Yseult. Before the success of White Zombie, he worked as a production assistant for the children&#x27;s show &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. He took the stage name &quot;Rob Zombie&quot; from Bela Lugosi&#x27;s 1932 horror film &quot;White Zombie&quot;, from which he also took White Zombie&#x27;s band name. The name first shows up on White Zombie&#x27;s 1989 EP &quot;God of Thunder&quot;. He had previously used the name &quot;Rob Straker&quot; on the White Zombie LPs &quot;Soul-Crusher&quot; and &quot;Make Them Die Slowly&quot;. In 1996, he made &quot;Rob Zombie&quot; his legal name.

== Career ==
=== 1985–1998: White Zombie ===
Cummings and Yseult co-founded the band that would become known as White Zombie. They broke up after seven years of dating, but continued to work in the band together. The band released three extended plays to little success, with their debut studio album &quot;Soul-Crusher&quot; following in 1987 through the band&#x27;s own record label, Silent Explosion. They released their second studio album &quot;Make Them Die Slowly&quot; in 1989 to little commercial reaction. Yseult and Zombie ended their relationship in 1991 and Zombie began dating Sheri Moon shortly afterwards. The band caught the attention of Geffen Records following the release of their fourth extended play; their third studio album, &quot;La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume One&quot;, was released through the label in 1992. Although the album did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart until about a year after its release, it became the band&#x27;s breakout hit, going on to sell over two million copies in the United States. Two singles, &quot;Thunder Kiss &#x27;65&quot; and &quot;Black Sunshine&quot;, were released to promote &quot;La Sexorcisto&quot;.

White Zombie&#x27;s fourth and final studio album, &quot;Astro-Creep: 2000 – Songs of Love, Destruction and Other Synthetic Delusions of the Electric Head&quot; (1995), became their first and only to enter the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; it went on to sell over two million copies in the United States. Cummings directed the music video for the album&#x27;s single &quot;More Human than Human&quot; (1995) and would go on to direct all subsequent videos for the band. In 1996, Cummings legally changed his name to Rob Zombie. White Zombie released a remix album that year, marking their final release before their eventual disbandment. Zombie collaborated with Alice Cooper on the song &quot;Hands of Death (Burn Baby Burn)&quot; (1996) for &quot;Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by the X-Files&quot;. The song was nominated in the category of Best Metal Performance at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, though lost to Rage Against the Machine. White Zombie officially broke up in September 1998, with Zombie stating, &quot;Sometimes a band just breaks up because the band has run its course and the best days are behind them. White Zombie went through a lot together and did tons of great stuff, but it was time to stop. The good times were over and we were all moving in different directions.&quot; A box-set for the group was released in 2008 featuring all of their released material.

Since the break up of White Zombie, Zombie has shown no interest in reforming the band and has been quoted as saying, &quot;I have many legit reasons [for not wanting to reform White Zombie]. Just because you don&#x27;t know them does not mean they don&#x27;t exist. Everything is not everybody&#x27;s business.&quot; In a 2011 interview, Zombie stated that he had not spoken to any members of the band &quot;except John Tempesta in about 15 years.&quot;

=== 1998–2001: Solo debut and commercial success ===
Work on Zombie&#x27;s debut solo album first began in 1997, before the band had officially broken up. For the album, Zombie worked with numerous artists, including Charlie Clouser of Nine Inch Nails fame and former White Zombie bandmate John Tempesta. Zombie&#x27;s solo debut album, &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe: 13 Tales of Cadaverous Cavorting Inside the Spookshow International&quot;, was released on August 25, 1998. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first week sales of 121,000 copies. The album&#x27;s first week sales topped that of his prior albums with White Zombie. &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot; went on to become Zombie&#x27;s highest selling album to date, with sales exceeding three million copies in the United States. The album was influenced by classic horror films, with numerous songs on the album containing samples and quotes from some of Zombie&#x27;s favorite horror films. The album spawned three singles, all of which charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Numerous songs from the album were used in films and video games, mainly in the horror genre. The success of the album led to the release of Zombie&#x27;s first remix album, &quot;American Made Music to Strip By&quot; (1999). The album entered the top forty of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in its debut week.

Zombie formed his own record label, Zombie-A-Go-Go Records, in 1998. The label released the final album from American instrumental band The Bomboras, as well as the debut album from the Ghastly Ones. Both albums were released on June 2, 1998, though received little critical or commercial success. The label next released the compilation album &quot;Halloween Hootenanny&quot; (1998), featuring appearances from artists such as Reverend Horton Heat and Rocket From the Crypt. Zombie himself contributed the song &quot;Halloween (She Get So Mean)&quot; to the soundtrack, which had previously appeared on promotional releases of &quot;Dragula&quot; (1998). Zombie released the album &quot;Rob Zombie Presents The Words &amp; The Music Of Frankenstein&quot; on October 12, 1999, through Zombie-A-Go-Go Records. The album, considered a soundtrack, features the original score and some dialogue from the original &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931).

Zombie was set to make his directorial debut with the film &quot;The Crow: 2037&quot;, and even wrote the film&#x27;s script. The film was set to take place in the future, though it was never released. It was decided that the film was not suited for the franchise, but would instead serve as a standalone project. He composed the original score for the video game &quot;Twisted Metal III&quot;, released in 1998. Zombie designed a haunted attraction for Universal Studios in 1999, which was later deemed instrumental in reviving the Halloween Horror Nights annual attraction. It was during this time that Zombie began working with the studio on his directorial debut, a film titled &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;. The project began filming in May 2000 with a scheduled release date of the following year, though the studio ultimately cancelled its release due to the violent themes present throughout the film. Zombie&#x27;s song &quot;Superbeast&quot;, taken from &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot;, received a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards. Zombie contributed the song &quot;Scum of the Earth&quot; (2000) to the &quot;&quot; soundtrack.

Zombie&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Sinister Urge&quot;, was released on November 13, 2001. The album expands on the horror and shock rock elements seen in his debut album, and features collaborations with artists such as Ozzy Osbourne. The album became his second to enter the top ten in the United States, with its first week sales topping that of his previous album. The album went on to sell over one million copies in the United States, his second to accomplish this feat. The album was preceded by the single &quot;Feel So Numb&quot;, with a second single being released the following year. Despite the album&#x27;s success, it was noted as a decline in sales when compared to his first studio album. &quot;The Sinister Urge&quot; and its subsequent singles were met with a positive critical reception, with AllMusic writing &quot;It is the slow burn of [the album&#x27;s] last track that shows the most promise; after years of making good heavy metal, he finally expands the boundaries of his own sound. Few metal musicians kept their sound fresh for as long as Zombie, and this album is no exception.&quot; &quot;The Sinister Urge&quot; was voted as the fans&#x27; favorite album on Zombie&#x27;s official website. The album is the final project to feature guitarist Mike Riggs and drummer John Tempesta, who had been with Zombie since the start of his solo career.

=== 2002–2006: Marriage, directorial debut, and continued musical success ===

Following years of struggling to find a distributor and various re-shoots, Zombie confirmed that his film &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; would finally be released through Lions Gate Entertainment. The film was released theatrically on April 11, 2003. The film received a generally negative reception from critics, though it grossed over $16 million worldwide. The film was criticized for being too &quot;grotesque&quot; and &quot;violent&quot;, but has since garnered a cult following. Despite vastly negative reviews, the film garnered a warmer reception in later years, and is frequently listed as one of the &quot;best horror films ever made&quot;. Zombie worked with Scott Humphrey on the majority of the film&#x27;s soundtrack, which was released on March 25, 2003. The release features original songs from Zombie such as &quot;Pussy Liquor&quot; and &quot;Little Piggy&quot;, as well as Zombie&#x27;s own rendition of the Commodores hit single &quot;Brick House&quot; (1977), re-titled &quot;Brick House 2003&quot;. The soundtrack peaked at number fifty-three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and number four on the Top Soundtracks chart.

Zombie released his first compilation album, titled &quot;Past, Present &amp; Future&quot;, on September 23, 2003. The release featured a collection of songs taken from Zombie&#x27;s solo albums as well as his releases with White Zombie; new material is also present on the album. The album debuted at number eleven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and would go on to become Zombie&#x27;s third release to sell over one million copies in the country. Zombie guest starred on episodes of both &quot;Spider-Man: The New Animated Series&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; that year, in a voice only role for both. In November 2003, Zombie launched his &quot;Spookshow International&quot; comic book series. His second series, &quot;The Nail&quot;, spawned four issues between June and October 2004, while his &quot;Bigfoot&quot; series lasted from February to May 2005, featuring four issues. Zombie&#x27;s second film, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot;, serves as a direct sequel to &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;, and was released on July 22, 2005. The film featured a more &quot;violent Western film&quot; theme as opposed to the horror aspects of its predecessor. The film received a much more positive reception than its predecessor, though was still criticized for its violence and material. The film has been described as &quot;one giant loogie that comes straight from the heart&quot;, filled with moments of nihilism and cunning wit. Much like the first film, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot; went on to gain a cult following after its release. The film has a 53 out of 100 rating on Metacritic, meaning mixed to positive reviews. Zombie released a number of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot; comics throughout 2005 to coincide with the film.

Zombie began working on his third studio album in 2005, whilst finishing work on &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot;; the album was influenced by glam rock artists like Slade, T. Rex, and Gary Glitter. The release was described as &quot;experimental&quot; by Zombie, who claimed the project featured numerous acoustic-led songs. The album, &quot;Educated Horses&quot;, was released on March 28, 2006. It sold 107,000 copies in its first week, becoming Zombie&#x27;s third album to enter the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album received mixed critical reviews, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writing &quot;A handful of cuts are too long on sludgy instrumental grooves, but whether Zombie is out-Trent Reznoring Trent Reznor on the sitar-laden grindfest &#x27;17 Year Locust&#x27; or spitting fire amid the apocalyptic blues riffs of &#x27;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&#x27;, he sounds like a gifted schlockmeister that Strokes fans can enjoy. Or at least tolerate.&quot; The song &quot;The Lords of Salem&quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards. &quot;Educated Horses&quot; saw a further decline in sales for Zombie, selling just over 500,000 copies in the United States. The album became his first studio album as a solo artist to not receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It served as Zombie&#x27;s final studio album to be released through Geffen Records. Zombie had a cameo appearance in a voice only role for the film &quot;Slither&quot; (2006). Zombie released his first official greatest hits album, &quot;The Best of Rob Zombie&quot;, on October 10, 2006. The album was re-released only months later under the title &quot;The Best of Rob Zombie: 20th Century Masters The Millennium Collection&quot;. The project debuted at number 166 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and went on to receive a gold certification from the RIAA. The album featured no new material, and was released with little promotion on Zombie&#x27;s behalf. It remains his final album to receive an RIAA certification to date.

=== 2007–2009: Focus on film work ===

Zombie opted to focus on his career as a director in 2007, following the release of his third studio album a year prior. It was confirmed in 2006 that Zombie had signed on to write and direct a remake of the horror classic &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978). Zombie later referred to the film as a &quot;re-imagining&quot; of the original John Carpenter film. Zombie&#x27;s version of the film was officially released on August 31, 2007. Thanks to its opening weekend of $30.5 million, the film broke the box-office record for the Labor Day weekend, surpassing the record set in 2005 by &quot;Transporter 2&quot; with $20.1 million. It currently resided as the top Labor Day weekend grosser for fourteen years until Marvel&#x27;s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings in 2021. The film went on to become Zombie&#x27;s highest grossing release to date. Despite these achievements, the film was generally panned by critics upon its release. Based on 109 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Halloween&quot; received an average 25% overall approval rating based on 110 reviews, with the consensus &quot;Rob Zombie doesn&#x27;t bring many new ideas to the table in &quot;Halloween&quot;, making it another bloody disappointment for fans of the franchise.&quot; Zombie directed a fictitious trailer for a film &quot;Werewolf Women of the SS&quot;, which was featured in the film &quot;Grindhouse&quot; (2007). That same year, Zombie released his first live album, &quot;Zombie Live&quot;.

Zombie announced work on a new film, &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot;, which was slated for release in 2009; the film was ultimately scrapped. Despite previous comments made by Zombie that he would not do a sequel to &quot;Halloween&quot;, it was later announced he would both write and direct the series&#x27; next film, tentatively titled &quot;H2&quot;. &quot;H2&quot; was ultimately the reason for the postponement and eventual cancellation of &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot;. &quot;Halloween II&quot; was released on August 28, 2009. The film received a worse critical reception than Zombie&#x27;s original remake and failed to achieve the commercial success of the remake, but was a box office success nevertheless. Unlike the original &quot;Halloween II&quot; (1981), Zombie&#x27;s version of the film focused on the prior film&#x27;s survivor and the effects that the film&#x27;s events had on her mentality. Following the completion of the film, Zombie confirmed he would not make another sequel. &quot;Variety&quot; Magazine announced the weekend before the release of &quot;Halloween II&quot; that Zombie would be directing a remake of the 1950s film &quot;The Blob&quot;. Zombie later chose to back out of the film as he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to do another remake&quot;.

The day that &quot;Halloween II&quot; was released, Zombie and Jesse Dayton released the album &quot;Rob Zombie Presents Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures&quot;, based on the band featured in the film&#x27;s party scene. The album was released through Zombie&#x27;s own Zombie-A-Go-Go Records, the first album released through the label in almost ten years. There were initial reports of a film centering around Captain Clegg, though the project never materialized. Dayton later toured in character as the band as the opening act for Zombie throughout 2009 and 2010. The release of &quot;Rob Zombie Presents Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures&quot; marks the final release from Zombie-A-Go-Go Records, before Zombie formed his new Zodiac Swan label in 2013. Zombie was the executive producer of the animated film &quot;The Haunted World of El Superbeasto&quot;, based upon his comic book series &quot;The Adventures of El Superbeasto&quot;. The series previously appeared in his &quot;Spookshow International&quot; comic book. The film was released in limited showings at selected theaters on September 12, 2009, and to DVD &amp; Blu-Ray on September 22, 2009. It features the voices of Tom Papa, Paul Giamatti, Zombie&#x27;s wife Sheri Moon Zombie, and Rosario Dawson. The film received a generally mixed reaction upon its release.

===2010–2015: New label and return to music===
It was announced in 2009 that Zombie had begun working on his fourth studio album, the follow-up to his 2006 album &quot;Educated Horses&quot;. The album was originally scheduled to be released on November 17, 2009, but was delayed following Zombie&#x27;s departure from longtime label Geffen Records on October 29, 2009, after which he penned a new deal with Roadrunner Records. Zombie later claimed that Geffen had &quot;morphed into a different label&quot; and that being signed didn&#x27;t &quot;work for [him] anymore.&quot; The album was confirmed to be titled &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe 2: Noble Jackals, Penny Dreadfuls and the Systematic Dehumanization of Cool&quot;, with Zombie describing it as a sequel to his 1998 debut as they sounded similar in both &quot;vibe&quot; and &quot;attitude&quot;. &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe 2&quot; was released on February 2, 2010. The album sold 49,000 copies in its first week of release, becoming his fourth top ten album in the United States. The album received a mixed to positive critical reception upon its release. Zombie released a special edition of the album on September 28, 2010, featuring three new songs. Zombie promoted the release through his Hellbilly Deluxe 2 World Tour, which served as his first international tour since beginning his solo career. The tour featured 150 dates, spanning over a two-year time span. Zombie released the &quot;Icon&quot; greatest hits album on October 5, 2010, through Roadrunner Records.

Zombie launched his seventh and final comic book series, &quot;Whatever Happened to Baron Von Shock?&quot;, in 2010; the series spanned four issues. Zombie had another voice-only role in the 2010 film &quot;Super&quot;, portraying God. In 2011, Zombie directed a horror-themed commercial for Woolite. Zombie announced work on the horror film &quot;The Lords of Salem&quot; in 2011. The film, whose name is derived from the Rob Zombie song of the same name, is about a coven of witches in modern-day Salem, Massachusetts. In an interview Zombie said that the film would be his cinematically biggest film and described it as &quot;if Ken Russell directed &quot;The Shining&quot;&quot;. &quot;The Lords of Salem&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2012, with a limited theatrical release following in April 2013. &quot;The Lords of Salem&quot; became the last film of veteran actor Richard Lynch, who died in 2012.

Zombie later stated that &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot; would be his next released film after &quot;The Lords of Salem&quot;, though the project has since been put on hold for a second time. In 2012, it was confirmed that Zombie would be writing and directing a film titled &quot;The Broad Street Bullies&quot;, which would be based on the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team. The film will be Zombie&#x27;s first non-horror film. He has since stated that the film was in the &quot;research stages&quot;, and a release date is unknown. Much like &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot;, the film, along with Rock Bottom Creek, has been put on hold indefinitely. Zombie released a second remix album, titled &quot;Mondo Sex Head&quot;, on August 6, 2012. The album featured remixed material from Zombie&#x27;s first four studio albums, as well as his releases with White Zombie. The album was released through Geffen Records, despite Zombie having left the label. Zombie embarked on the Twins of Evil Tour with American rock band Marilyn Manson beginning on September 28, 2012. The tour concluded following a publicized feud between the artists while on tour, with the two groups often feuding while on stage. The tour officially concluded on December 12, 2012.

Recording for Zombie&#x27;s fifth studio album began in June 2012, with Zombie announcing the then-untitled project in July 2012. On the record, Zombie claimed &quot;We just want to make a dark, heavy, weird record and stick to that idea [...] If something comes up that isn&#x27;t, we won&#x27;t finish it. We&#x27;ll stick to the plan.&quot; Zombie parted ways with Roadrunner Records, instead releasing the album through his new record label Zodiac Swan through Universal Music Enterprises and T-Boy Records. On January 30, 2013, Zombie announced that the album was titled &quot;Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor&quot;. The album was released on April 23, 2013. &quot;Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor&quot; became Zombie&#x27;s fifth consecutive studio album to debut inside the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, though it boasted his lowest first week sales of his career. The album has since become Zombie&#x27;s lowest selling album to date.

Zombie designed and launched the Great American Nightmare haunted attraction in 2013. The attraction, based in Chicago, featured references to Zombie&#x27;s films and other significant horror events in pop culture. He designed the attractions &quot;Lords of Salem Total Black Out&quot;, &quot;The Haunted World of El Superbeasto 3D&quot;, and &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;, which were combined with a music festival from artists in hard rock, alternative, EDM, and more in 2013. In 2014, Zombie had the voice-only role of Ravager Navigator in the superhero film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;. He released his first video album, &quot;The Zombie Horror Picture Show&quot;, on May 19, 2014. He released his second live album, &quot;Spookshow International: Live&quot;, on February 24, 2015.

=== 2016–present: More albums and upcoming films ===

Zombie announced work on his sixth studio album as early as April 2014, having begun working on the project that January. On January 11, 2016, Zombie confirmed the title of the record to be &quot;The Electric Warlock Acid Witch Satanic Orgy Celebration Dispenser&quot;, along with the album&#x27;s cover art and track listing. The album was released on April 29, 2016. Zombie described it as &quot;seriously [their] heaviest most fucked up musical monster to date.&quot; Zombie began working on a new horror film, &quot;31&quot;, in 2014. Zombie described the film as &quot;old-school&quot;, and raised money for the film through crowdfunding. The film follows a group of individuals attempting to survive a night in a carnival filled with murderous clowns. Zombie has stated that he wanted to have a &quot;very nasty, gritty, guerilla-style approach to the filmmaking&quot; for &quot;31&quot;, as it &quot;fits the story and the vibe of the movie&quot;. &quot;31&quot; premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2016. It has been announced that Zombie signed on to direct the film &quot;Raised Eyebrows&quot;, a movie about the life of comedian and actor Julius Henry &quot;Groucho&quot; Marx. The film has yet to receive a release date. Zombie launched his &quot;Spookshow International&quot; pinball machine in February 2016. The limited edition item features ten of Zombie&#x27;s classic songs, as well as voice contributions from Zombie, Sheri Moon, and Sid Haig.

In July 2018, Zombie embarked on the Twins of Evil: The Second Coming Tour in the US with co-headliner Marilyn Manson and special guest Deadly Apples. Zombie released a trailer to his third instalment of the &quot;Firefly&quot; trilogy in June 2019.

On August 1, 2017, Zombie announced on his Instagram page that he had begun working on his seventh studio album. Guitarist John 5 described the album as &quot;his &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;&quot;, and called it &quot;the best Zombie record that he&#x27;s ever done.&quot; Zombie&#x27;s first song in four years, &quot;The Triumph of King Freak (A Crypt of Preservation and Superstition)&quot;, was released on October 30, 2020. Deemed a &quot;ferocious blast of big guitar metal&quot;, it serves as the first single from his seventh album &quot;The Lunar Injection Kool Aid Eclipse Conspiracy&quot;, released on March 12, 2021. The album was produced by Zeuss, who also produced &quot;The Electric Warlock&quot;. Zombie had focused primarily on filming in the years prior.

== Artistry ==
=== Musical style ===

Zombie&#x27;s music has been noted for its use of horror and suspense elements, which is inspired by Zombie&#x27;s love of horror films. Zombie&#x27;s music also contains elements commonly found in heavy metal music. Zombie&#x27;s music has been described as &quot;melding metal with industrial, hypnotic rhythms and haunting sounds&quot; and having a &quot;complicated beat, distinctive vocals and a killer story line&quot;. Zombie&#x27;s songs have also been known to feature quotes and samples from classic horror films. Numerous songs on his debut album, &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot;, feature quotes from classic horror films that Zombie grew up with. Zombie has classified himself as a metal musician, and stated &quot;It felt like hard rock and heavy metal had really been struggling you know, like top of the charts – it felt like they were being kicked to the curb for a long time. It was almost like you were doing something but you feel like nobody cares anymore so now you&#x27;re just chuggin&#x27; along doing what you do and it&#x27;s like the world had forgotten. However it&#x27;s felt like in the last few years that&#x27;s kind of changed and you feel it coming back.&quot;

In their review of &quot;Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor&quot; (2013), Music Enthusiast commented on Zombie&#x27;s musical style &quot;If you are a fan of Rob Zombie&#x27;s, or even if you aren&#x27;t, you can definitely recognize his style of music- that is to say, if Alice Cooper wrote songs for strip clubs. Rob Zombie albums have always had bombastic, almost danceable grooves, over the top guitar effects [...] and loads of B-movie sci-fi/horror lyrics.&quot; He is also noted for using &quot;spoken word lyrics&quot; in numerous songs, a style he began while with White Zombie. AllMusic compared the musical themes of &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot; to a White Zombie record, stating it was &quot;complete with thunderous industrial rhythms, drilling metal guitars, and B-movie obsessions.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; spoke about the album&#x27;s horror film qualities, stating it had &quot;concocted a veritable blood feast of hair-raising guitars, spine-tingling drum loops, and a cast of ghoulish characters who could be refugees from an old William Castle horror flick.&quot; Legends Magazine wrote that &quot;the songs follow the same formula of anger, sex, death, monster, demon, zombie, satanic, drug abuse kinda raw drive a tractor over your neighbor&#x27;s skull kinda hate the world so I&#x27;ll burn it all down music.&quot; AllMusic wrote in their review of &quot;American Made Music to Strip By&quot; that &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot; had a &quot;sexy, sleazy, horror-movie vibe&quot;.

While &quot;The Sinister Urge&quot; continues the themes of horror and suspense, it is noted as featuring more dance-oriented beats in songs such as &quot;Never Gonna Stop (The Red Red Kroovy)&quot;. Zombie claimed that whereas &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot; featured electronics, &quot;The Sinister Urge&quot; was recorded with a live band as to emphasize the instrumentals. With the &quot;Educated Horses&quot; album, Zombie further distanced himself from the sound of his first two albums. Zombie described the album as experimental, and explored a number of acoustic productions with John 5. Despite a shift in sound, many of the album&#x27;s lyrics feature horror elements found on his prior releases. &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe 2&quot;, Zombie&#x27;s fourth studio album, saw a return to the heavy metal sound of his early releases. The album was considered a direct sequel to his debut studio album, with which it shares a name. &quot;Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor&quot; continued these themes, and features &quot;bass-heavy&quot; beats. The record was deemed a throwback to his debut album due to similar lyrical and sonic themes.

=== Influences ===
Both Zombie&#x27;s music and film work draws influence from classic horror and suspense films, with Zombie citing the 1970s as the &quot;last great time where films were being made for the sake of the film and not for the sake of the money.&quot; Zombie has cited artists such as Alice Cooper, Kiss, Queen, and Elton John as influences during his childhood. Zombie claimed that the first record he ever bought was an Alice Cooper album. Metallica, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Slayer, Ministry, Pantera, Sepultura, Black Flag and Twisted Sister were also cited as influences by Zombie. Zombie claimed his mother would not allow him to watch horror films, namely &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974), which later served as an influence on Zombie&#x27;s films &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot;. Zombie has directed the majority of his music videos as a solo artist, with numerous releases being influenced or referencing horror films. The music video for his single &quot;Living Dead Girl&quot; is based upon the silent horror film &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920), while his video for &quot;Never Gonna Stop (The Red Red Kroovy)&quot; was heavily inspired by &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971). His film &quot;The Lords of Salem&quot; was inspired by the horror classic &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980).

== Personal life ==

Zombie dated his White Zombie bandmate Sean Yseult from 1984 until 1991, though they continued to work in the band together after their breakup. Zombie began dating actress Sheri Moon in 1993, and they were married at Graceland Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on October 31, 2002. They originally set their wedding date for November 9, but eloped 10 days before. They split their time between a home in Los Angeles and a farm in Connecticut.

Zombie&#x27;s public image has often been denoted by his long hair, large beard, industrial fashion sense, and horror-themed makeup. A self-described ethical vegan, he and his wife use their Connecticut property to house rescued farm animals. He originally became a vegetarian in 1982 after viewing footage of a slaughterhouse. He is a supporter of PETA and was thanked by the organization for his realistic portrayal of the link between childhood animal abuse and psychopathy in his remake of &quot;Halloween&quot;.

Zombie generally refrains from sharing his political and religious beliefs with the public, though he has mentioned that his mother once contemplated becoming a nun. In the same interview, he said that he avoids all alcohol and drugs because he &quot;certainly didn&#x27;t achieve anything by being wasted and fucked up&quot;. In a separate interview, he said that he does not believe in an afterlife and the concept of Heaven was &quot;insane&quot;, believing that &quot;this life is all you get&quot;. He also said that he does not believe in concepts such as UFOs, aliens, or Bigfoot. He criticized the initial cancellation of the 2020 horror film &quot;The Hunt&quot; following an outcry from U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters, stating, &quot;As far as [canceling] &quot;The Hunt&quot;, that&#x27;s just a bullshit sacrificial lamb that solves nothing in society, but they always do that. If it wasn&#x27;t that movie it would have been a video game or sometimes it was somebody&#x27;s rock album.&quot;

<text>Glia, also called glial cells (gliocytes) or neuroglia, are non-neuronal cells in the central nervous system (the brain and the spinal cord) and in the peripheral nervous system that do not produce electrical impulses. The neuroglia make up more than one half the volume of neural tissue in the human body. They maintain homeostasis, form myelin, and provide support and protection for neurons. In the central nervous system, glial cells include oligodendrocytes (that produce myelin), astrocytes, ependymal cells and microglia, and in the peripheral nervous system they include Schwann cells (that produce myelin), and satellite cells.

==Function==
They have four main functions:
*to surround neurons and hold them in place
*to supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons
*to insulate one neuron from another
*to destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons.
They also play a role in neurotransmission and synaptic connections,&lt;ref name=&quot;doi:10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06515.x&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and in physiological processes such as breathing.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi:10.1126/science.1190721&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While glia were thought to outnumber neurons by a ratio of 10:1, studies using newer methods and reappraisal of historical quantitative evidence suggests an overall ratio of less than 1:1, with substantial variation between different brain tissues.

Glial cells have far more cellular diversity and functions than neurons, and can respond to and manipulate neurotransmission in many ways. Additionally, they can affect both the preservation and consolidation of memories.

Glia were discovered in 1856, by the pathologist Rudolf Virchow in his search for a &quot;connective tissue&quot; in the brain. The term derives from Greek γλία and γλοία &quot;glue&quot; ( or ), and suggests the original impression that they were the glue of the nervous system.

==Types==

===Macroglia===
Derived from ectodermal tissue.

===Microglia===
Microglia are specialized macrophages capable of phagocytosis that protect neurons of the central nervous system. They are derived from the earliest wave of mononuclear cells that originate in yolk sac blood islands early in development, and colonize the brain shortly after the neural precursors begin to differentiate.

These cells are found in all regions of the brain and spinal cord. Microglial cells are small relative to macroglial cells, with changing shapes and oblong nuclei. They are mobile within the brain and multiply when the brain is damaged. In the healthy central nervous system, microglia processes constantly sample all aspects of their environment (neurons, macroglia and blood vessels). In a healthy brain, microglia direct the immune response to brain damage and play an important role in the inflammation that accompanies the damage. Many diseases and disorders are associated with deficient microglia, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and ALS.

===Other===
Pituicytes from the posterior pituitary are glial cells with characteristics in common to astrocytes. Tanycytes in the median eminence of the hypothalamus are a type of ependymal cell that descend from radial glia and line the base of the third ventricle. &quot;Drosophila melanogaster,&quot; the fruit fly, contains numerous glial types that are functionally similar to mammalian glia but are nonetheless classified differently.

===Total number===
In general, neuroglial cells are smaller than neurons. There are approximately 85 billion glia cells in the human brain, about the same number as neurons. Glial cells make up about half the total volume of the brain and spinal cord. The glia to neuron-ratio varies from one part of the brain to another. The glia to neuron-ratio in the cerebral cortex is 3.72 (60.84 billion glia (72%); 16.34 billion neurons), while that of the cerebellum is only 0.23 (16.04 billion glia; 69.03 billion neurons). The ratio in the cerebral cortex gray matter is 1.48, with 3.76 for the gray and white matter combined. The ratio of the basal ganglia, diencephalon and brainstem combined is 11.35.

The total number of glia cells in the human brain is distributed into the different types with oligodendrocytes being the most frequent (45–75%), followed by astrocytes (19–40%) and microglia (about 10% or less).

==Development==
Most glia are derived from ectodermal tissue of the developing embryo, in particular the neural tube and crest. The exception is microglia, which are derived from hematopoietic stem cells. In the adult, microglia are largely a self-renewing population and are distinct from macrophages and monocytes, which infiltrate an injured and diseased CNS.

In the central nervous system, glia develop from the ventricular zone of the neural tube. These glia include the oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, and astrocytes. In the peripheral nervous system, glia derive from the neural crest. These PNS glia include Schwann cells in nerves and satellite glial cells in ganglia.

===Capacity to divide===
Glia retain the ability to undergo cell divisions in adulthood, whereas most neurons cannot. The view is based on the general inability of the mature nervous system to replace neurons after an injury, such as a stroke or trauma, where very often there is a substantial proliferation of glia, or gliosis, near or at the site of damage. However, detailed studies have found no evidence that &#x27;mature&#x27; glia, such as astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, retain mitotic capacity. Only the resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells seem to keep this ability once the nervous system matures.

Glial cells are known to be capable of mitosis. By contrast, scientific understanding of whether neurons are permanently post-mitotic, or capable of mitosis, is still developing. In the past, glia had been considered to lack certain features of neurons. For example, glial cells were not believed to have chemical synapses or to release transmitters. They were considered to be the passive bystanders of neural transmission. However, recent studies have shown this to not be entirely true.

==Functions==
Some glial cells function primarily as the physical support for neurons. Others provide nutrients to neurons and regulate the extracellular fluid of the brain, especially surrounding neurons and their synapses. During early embryogenesis, glial cells direct the migration of neurons and produce molecules that modify the growth of axons and dendrites. Some glial cells display regional diversity in the CNS and their functions may vary between the CNS regions.

===Neuron repair and development===
Glia are crucial in the development of the nervous system and in processes such as synaptic plasticity and synaptogenesis. Glia have a role in the regulation of repair of neurons after injury. In the central nervous system (CNS), glia suppress repair. Glial cells known as astrocytes enlarge and proliferate to form a scar and produce inhibitory molecules that inhibit regrowth of a damaged or severed axon. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), glial cells known as Schwann cells (or also as neuri-lemmocytes) promote repair. After axonal injury, Schwann cells regress to an earlier developmental state to encourage regrowth of the axon. This difference between the CNS and the PNS, raises hopes for the regeneration of nervous tissue in the CNS. For example, a spinal cord may be able to be repaired following injury or severance.

===Myelin sheath creation===
Oligodendrocytes are found in the CNS and resemble an octopus: they have bulbous cell bodies with up to fifteen arm-like processes. Each process reaches out to an axon and spirals around it, creating a myelin sheath. The myelin sheath insulates the nerve fiber from the extracellular fluid and speeds up signal conduction along the nerve fiber. In the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells are responsible for myelin production. These cells envelop nerve fibers of the PNS by winding repeatedly around them. This process creates a myelin sheath, which not only aids in conductivity but also assists in the regeneration of damaged fibers.

===Neurotransmission===
Astrocytes are crucial participants in the tripartite synapse. They have several crucial functions, including clearance of neurotransmitters from within the synaptic cleft, which aids in distinguishing between separate action potentials and prevents toxic build-up of certain neurotransmitters such as glutamate, which would otherwise lead to excitotoxicity. Furthermore, astrocytes release gliotransmitters such as glutamate, ATP, and D-serine in response to stimulation.

== Clinical significance ==
While glial cells in the PNS frequently assist in regeneration of lost neural functioning, loss of neurons in the CNS does not result in a similar reaction from neuroglia. In the CNS, regrowth will only happen if the trauma was mild, and not severe. When severe trauma presents itself, the survival of the remaining neurons becomes the optimal solution. However, some studies investigating the role of glial cells in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease are beginning to contradict the usefulness of this feature, and even claim it can &quot;exacerbate&quot; the disease. In addition to affecting the potential repair of neurons in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, scarring and inflammation from glial cells have been further implicated in the degeneration of neurons caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

In addition to neurodegenerative diseases, a wide range of harmful exposure, such as hypoxia, or physical trauma, can lead to the result of physical damage to the CNS. Generally, when damage occurs to the CNS, glial cells cause apoptosis among the surrounding cellular bodies. Then, there is a large amount of microglial activity, which results in inflammation, and, finally, there is a heavy release of growth inhibiting molecules.

==History==
Although glial cells and neurons were probably first observed at the same time in the early 19th century, unlike neurons whose morphological and physiological properties were directly observable for the first investigators of the nervous system, glial cells had been considered to be merely &quot;glue&quot; that held neurons together until the mid-20th century.

Glia were first described in 1856 by the pathologist Rudolf Virchow in a comment to his 1846 publication on connective tissue. A more detailed description of glial cells was provided in the 1858 book &#x27;Cellular Pathology&#x27; by the same author.

When markers for different types of cells were analyzed, Albert Einstein&#x27;s brain was discovered to contain significantly more glia than normal brains in the left angular gyrus, an area thought to be responsible for mathematical processing and language. However, out of the total of 28 statistical comparisons between Einstein&#x27;s brain and the control brains, finding one statistically significant result is not surprising, and the claim that Einstein&#x27;s brain is different is not scientific (c.f. multiple comparisons problem).

Not only does the ratio of glia to neurons increase through evolution, but so does the size of the glia. Astroglial cells in human brains have a volume 27 times greater than in mouse brains.

These important scientific findings may begin to shift the neurocentric perspective into a more holistic view of the brain which encompasses the glial cells as well. For the majority of the twentieth century, scientists had disregarded glial cells as mere physical scaffolds for neurons. Recent publications have proposed that the number of glial cells in the brain is correlated with the intelligence of a species. Moreover, evidences are demonstrating the active role of glia, in particular astroglia, in cognitive processes like learning and memory.

<text>USS &quot;Berkeley&quot; (DDG-15) was a guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She was named for Major General Randolph C. Berkeley, USMC (1875–1960), a Medal of Honor recipient for actions during the U.S. occupation of Veracruz (1914).

She was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden in New Jersey on 1 June 1960, launched on 29 July 1961 sponsored by Mrs. James B. Berkeley, Major General Berkeley&#x27;s daughter-in-law; and commissioned on 15 December 1962 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

&quot;Berkeley&quot; was decommissioned on 30 September 1992 at a ceremony in San Diego, California, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. She was turned over to the Hellenic Navy on 1 October, and recommissioned as the Greek destroyer &quot;Themistoklis&quot; (D221). The ship remained in Greek service until her decommissioning on 18 February 2002 and was sold for scrap in 2004.

==Service history==

===1960s===
After fitting out at Philadelphia, &quot;Berkeley&quot; set out for her assigned homeport of Long Beach, California, mooring there on 16 March 1963 after visits to Port Royal, South Carolina; Kingston, Jamaica; and Acapulco, Mexico. Designed primarily to provide long-range anti-aircraft cover for task forces at sea, &quot;Berkeley&quot; devoted the next six weeks testing her Tartar anti-aircraft missile system&#x27;s proficiency in that role. The warship&#x27;s crew also conducted gunnery, engineering, and communication systems trials. In early May, the guided-missile destroyer demonstrated her capabilities to President John F. Kennedy, knocking down two jet drone targets with two TARTAR missiles. At the end of a short visit to the Rose Festival at Portland, Oregon, in early June, &quot;Berkeley&quot; entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard for a three-month availability. At the end of the repair period, she became a unit of Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 12 and spent the rest of the year engaged in local operations in the Long Beach area.

The warship remained in southern California waters for the first 10 weeks of 1964, preparing for a Far East deployment. On 13 March, &quot;Berkeley&quot; stood out of Long Beach in company with the cruiser and 11 other destroyers bound for her first tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. After calling at Pearl Harbor, where the aircraft carrier joined company, the task group steamed to the East China Sea for a month of training. Detached on 18 April, &quot;Berkeley&quot; proceeded to Hong Kong, where she embarked Vice Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, and sailed on to Bangkok, Thailand, for the annual Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) conference. After rejoining her task group in late April, the guided missile destroyer spent the next two months screening the carriers and and participating in a SEATO landing exercise in the Philippines.

After spending Independence Day in Sasebo, Japan, she put to sea with the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; task group on 5 July for routine operations. This quickly changed, however, when the warships received orders diverting them to the South China Sea where they joined other Navy units off the South Vietnamese coast and in the Gulf of Tonkin. As part of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s effort to limit North Vietnamese attacks on Laos and South Vietnam, the carrier launched Vought F-8 Crusader aircraft to reconnoiter suspected communist infiltration routes in eastern and southern Laos.

&quot;Berkeley&quot; continued to screen &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; throughout that summer. On 2 August, she provided anti-air protection to the task group during air strikes against North Vietnamese missile boats during the Tonkin Gulf incident. After American warships reported more attacks on 4 August, the guided missile destroyer again screened the carrier during extensive retaliatory strikes on North Vietnamese gunboats and torpedo boats on 5 August. &quot;Berkeley&quot; remained in the South China Sea during the relative lull that followed, patrolling the region during the slow buildup of American naval forces in Southeast Asia. The warship joined the aircraft carrier while there and sailed for home on 10 October, mooring at Long Beach, via Yokosuka, Japan, on 21 November.

After leave and upkeep, the guided-missile destroyer entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability. Following these repairs, &quot;Berkeley&quot; spent the next six months carrying out training missions, passing various communications and engineering inspections, and preparing for her next deployment to the Far East. This pattern of activity—combat service in Vietnamese waters followed by repairs and training to prepare for her next deployment—characterized her service for the next ten years.

Underway with the carrier in late November 1965, &quot;Berkeley&quot; made a brief stop at Subic Bay in the Philippines before proceeding to the South China Sea for combat operations off Vietnam. Upon arrival on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; on 16 December, &quot;Berkeley&quot; joined Task Force (TF) 77 in support of Operation Rolling Thunder. This naval air campaign, begun the previous March, sought to cut the flow of munitions and supplies to the Viet Cong insurgents in the south by interdicting North Vietnam&#x27;s logistics pipelines through Laos and across the demilitarized zone (DMZ). Assigned to the northern search-and-rescue (SAR) station in the Gulf of Tonkin, &quot;Berkeley&quot;, in company with the cruiser &quot;Topeka&quot; and destroyer , patrolled the area through the end of January 1966.

Following minor repairs at Sasebo in early February, and a port visit to Hong Kong, the guided missile destroyer returned to the Gulf of Tonkin for a second SAR tour on 26 February. Her first rescue mission took place on 14 March when &quot;Berkeley&quot; received notice that a McDonnell F-4C Phantom had ditched off Hon Me Island. In company with the destroyer , &quot;Berkeley&quot; coordinated rescue helicopter flights, and those of fighter aircraft from the carriers and &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, as the two warships closed the ditch site. Before they arrived, a United States Air Force HU-16 Albatross amphibian—which had landed to pick up the two Phantom crewmen—was taken under fire by North Vietnamese shore batteries. The amphibian was hit shortly thereafter, killing two crewmen and the aircraft burned and sank. &quot;Berkeley&quot; then closed Hon Me Island, drawing the enemy fire to her, and engaged in a 22-minute gunnery dual with the coastal batteries. At the same time, her combat information team directed friendly air strikes against enemy gun emplacements and coordinated three SH-3 helicopters from &quot;Yorktown&quot; and as they retrieved the six survivors from the water. Although repeatedly straddled by enemy fire during this action, &quot;Berkeley&quot; suffered only minor damage from shell fragments.

Relieved two weeks later by , the guided missile destroyer proceeded to Qui Nhon, where she joined Operation &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; for a week of call-fire missions against communist supply craft and coastal infiltration routes. After completing this mission on 8 April, she steamed to Subic Bay, where the crew began preparing the warship for visits to Australia and New Zealand. Departing the Philippines on 17 April, &quot;Berkeley&quot; crossed the equator north of the Admiralty Islands and moored at Sydney, Australia, on the 29th. Over the next three weeks, the warship&#x27;s crew took part in the annual &quot;Coral Sea Celebration&quot;—which honored the victory won by the Allied navies in May 1942—and visited Sydney, Adelaide, and Hobart in Australia as well as Auckland, New Zealand. Underway for home on 22 May, the guided missile destroyer stopped at Suva in the Fiji Islands and at Pearl Harbor before arriving at Long Beach on 6 June.

Subsequent to a leave and upkeep period, &quot;Berkeley&quot; entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability on 19 July. During that yard period, workers installed the new Standard missile system, including launch rails and guidance equipment. Upon leaving the shipyard on 25 August, the warship commenced a three-month missile development test and evaluation program. This entailed weekly cruises in southern California waters and the firing of Standard missiles at air and surface targets. Following the removal of test equipment in mid-December, the guided missile destroyer spent the rest of the month getting ready for upcoming fleet exercises.

Following the early January 1967 Exercise &quot;Snatch Block,&quot; which was devoted to SAR and electronic countermeasure (ECM) procedures, &quot;Berkeley&quot; spent the next three months preparing for another Far East deployment. This included many local evolutions—such as shore bombardment, carrier screening, and ASW exercises—as well as numerous operational readiness inspections. During this period, her engineers and technicians busied themselves maintaining and improving the warship&#x27;s complex electronic and fire-control systems, a task abetted by a three-week tender availability in early February.

Underway for the western Pacific on 29 April, the guided-missile destroyer crossed the central Pacific; and, after a short liberty period at Yokosuka, Japan, the warship headed south to Subic Bay, arriving there on 24 May. Underway again three days later, &quot;Berkeley&quot; sailed with the aircraft carrier to the Gulf of Tonkin before joining the cruiser and TU 77.1.1 for a &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; patrol. The task unit cruised off North Vietnam near Hon Me and Hon Matt Islands, searching for enemy waterborne logistics craft and firing on designated targets ashore. This pattern—small craft search in the morning followed by shore bombardment missions later in the day—became the daily routine of &quot;Berkeley&quot;&#x27;s later &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; patrols.

After routine upkeep and replenishment at Subic Bay in late June and early July, the guided-missile destroyer commenced her second &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; patrol on 12 July. Detached 10 days later, she sailed north to the Tonkin Gulf SAR station where she monitored daily strikes over North Vietnam. During three weeks on station, &quot;Berkeley&quot; participated in seven SAR incidents and helped to rescue four pilots. Relieved on 11 August by , the warship sailed to Hong Kong for a week of rest and recreation.

Following a tender availability at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, the guided-missile destroyer returned to the gunline on 22 September. &quot;Berkeley&quot; alternated duty between gunfire support for the 3d Marine Division in the I Corps area and night harassment and interdiction missions against coastal infiltration routes. Detached on 1 October, the warship visited Nagoya and Yokosuka before departing Japan on the 12th. &quot;Berkeley&quot; arrived at Long Beach on 25 October and spent the remainder of the year conducting post-deployment maintenance and preparing for various service inspections.

The guided-missile destroyer carried out local operations through April 1968 before moving into Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a maintenance overhaul. Upon completion of these repairs on 3 June, &quot;Berkeley&quot; loaded supplies and ammunition before steaming west on 5 July. After fuel stops at Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Guam—as well as a diversion south to avoid a typhoon near the Philippines—the warship arrived at Subic Bay on 28 July. Four days later, the guided missile cruiser departed for the coast of Vietnam and duty on &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; patrol. Over the next two months, &quot;Berkeley&quot; conducted three gunline patrols—firing nightly interdiction missions, searching for waterborne logistics craft, and bombarding supply routes—off both North Vietnam and the Vung Tau Peninsula. In between these missions, she retired to Subic Bay for upkeep. Her best hunting took place on the night of 10 and 11 September, when she and the destroyer combined to sink or damage 58 enemy supply boats.

After calling at Keelung, Taiwan, in late October and at Hong Kong in early November, &quot;Berkeley&quot; sailed back to Vietnam on 11 November. The rest of November passed uneventfully, with the warship on planeguard duty on &quot;Yankee Station.&quot; Departing the area on 1 December, she stopped at Guam and Pearl Harbor before mooring at Long Beach on 20 December.

Aside from a few periods of underway training, which included her annual missile-firing exercises in late February, the warship spent the first three months of 1969 preparing for an extensive overhaul. Entering the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 27 March, &quot;Berkeley&quot; received new weapons and communications systems as well as a general rehabilitation of all internal spaces in the warship. With this work completed, the guided-missile destroyer commenced sea trials and post-overhaul refresher training on 24 July. The warship also tested her new Standard missile system in September before turning to preparations for another Far East deployment which took up the remainder of the year.

===1970s===

Departing Long Beach on 13 February, the guided-missile destroyer made fuel stops at Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Guam before arriving at Yokosuka on 4 March. After two weeks of upkeep, she sailed to &quot;Yankee Station&quot;—arriving there on 23 March—and provided planeguard support for &quot;Constellation&quot; and . Then, starting on 10 May, the warship provided two weeks of naval gunfire support off South Vietnam. Between 25 May and 15 June, &quot;Berkeley&quot; visited Hong Kong and Kobe for rest and recreation before returning to South Vietnam for four weeks of gunline operations. Next came a port visit to Bangkok, Thailand, in mid-July, followed by three days of upkeep at Subic Bay. From there, the warship sailed for home on the 27th and moored at Long Beach on 14 August. The remainder of the year was dedicated to type training and upkeep in preparation for another western Pacific deployment in early 1971.

Those preparations continued into the new year, occupying her time for the first 11 weeks of 1971. &quot;Berkeley&quot; set sail on 16 March and, after brief stops at Oahu, Midway, and Guam, arrived at Subic Bay on 7 April. Following a brief upkeep period, she steamed to &quot;Yankee Station&quot; on 10 April and began escort duty for &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;. During this tour, the guided missile destroyer&#x27;s crew welcomed on board three Vietnamese midshipmen and provided them with six weeks of underway training. In May, after a brief period of PIRAZ duty with the cruiser , &quot;Berkeley&quot; steamed to Japan, arriving in Sasebo on 19 May.

Fitted out with specialized reconnaissance equipment, the warship steamed to the Sea of Japan on 10 June for service as Pacific Area Reconnaissance Program (PARPRO) picket ship. She collected intelligence off the Korean peninsula for the next 10 days before mooring at Yokosuka on 19 June. The PARPRO equipment was quickly unloaded, and the warship moved south for a visit to Hong Kong.

Returning to &quot;Yankee Station&quot; on 5 July, &quot;Berkeley&quot; spent the next two weeks working on the northern SAR station. Heading south on 18 July, the warship passed through the Strait of Malacca and moored at Penang, Malaysia, for a port visit on 23 July. Following four days there, and just over a week in Singapore for upkeep, &quot;Berkeley&quot; returned to the Vietnam war zone on 7 August. Assigned to a naval gunfire support mission, the warship cruised off Cua Viet for the next three weeks in support of friendly forces near the demilitarized zone (DMZ). During this time, she fired 2,143 5-inch rounds at enemy targets. After a brief stop at Subic Bay, the guided-missile destroyer retraced her path across the Pacific and arrived in Long Beach on 16 September.

Following a tender availability alongside , &quot;Berkeley&quot; remained in port, aside from a few type training days at sea, for the next six months. On 20 March 1972, the warship steamed to the Pacific Missile Range for three days of weapons systems exercises—including an ASW drill with the submarine —and, later that month, the warship conducted gunnery drills in the southern California operating area. These evolutions proved timely when, on 7 April, the warship received word to get ready for an emergency deployment to Vietnam. After a feverish 72 hours of preparation, &quot;Berkeley&quot; departed Long Beach on 10 April.

The guided-missile destroyer arrived in the Gulf of Tonkin, via Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Subic Bay, on 3 May. There, she joined other 7th Fleet units in heavy attacks against North Vietnamese military units pushing south along the coast. After firing numerous bombardment missions against enemy troops and tanks advancing toward Hue, &quot;Berkeley&quot; joined Operation Pocket Money, the mining of the river approaches to Haiphong, North Vietnam, on 9 May. In company with five other destroyers, the warship closed Haiphong to provide a protective barrage of 5-inch shells as A-6 Intruders and A-7 Corsairs from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; dropped magnetic-acoustic sea mines off that port.

Shortly thereafter, &quot;Berkeley&quot; moved to a surveillance position about 25 miles to the south and kept foreign merchant shipping informed of the newly cordoned waters. In mid-June, an attempt by the North Vietnamese to ferry supplies ashore was foiled when &quot;Berkeley&quot;, supported by helicopters and two other destroyers, sank over 30 small craft. After a brief upkeep period at Subic Bay in mid-July, the guided missile destroyer moved to the gunline and fired daily missions against enemy targets near the DMZ. Following a short yard period at Sasebo late in August, the warship conducted a final five-week gunfire support tour off North Vietnam.

After a five-day visit to Hong Kong in mid-October, &quot;Berkeley&quot; steamed for home—with brief stops at Subic Bay, Wake Island, Guam, and Pearl Harbor and underway refueling by the auxiliary —and arrived at Long Beach on 10 November. With the signing of the cease-fire agreement at Paris in January 1973, American involvement in the war ended; the 1972 deployment was &quot;Berkeley&quot;″s final Vietnam service. After a long holiday and post-deployment standdown period, the guided-missile destroyer&#x27;s crew began preparations for a complex overhaul scheduled for early January 1973.

On 5 January 1973, &quot;Berkeley&quot; moved to Bremerton, Washington, and, on 12 January, moved into drydock at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The overhaul gave the guided missile destroyer the new tactical data system, a sonar upgrade, new communications and electronic warfare gear, and two new 5-inch gun mounts. After five months in drydock, the warship moved pierside to finish the installations, which were finally completed on 1 November. &quot;Berkeley&quot; then spent the next eight weeks conducting sea trials, including a voyage to Victoria, British Columbia, and a joint exercise with the Canadian Navy.

Departing Bremerton on 4 January 1974, the warship sailed south to her new home port of San Diego, arriving there on the 18th after a brief stay at Long Beach. With the end of American participation in the Vietnam war following the previous year&#x27;s cease-fire agreement, the Navy concentrated on improving overall operational readiness, a routine markedly different from earlier training which had focused on preparing warships for combat duty off Vietnam. &quot;Berkeley&quot;, therefore, spent the next five months taking part in a series of fleet-wide inspections and maintenance programs. The guided-missile destroyer finally got underway to deploy on 19 June, steaming across the Pacific and arriving in Subic Bay on 10 July.

Sailing north on the 14th, &quot;Berkeley&quot; embarked American and Japanese midshipmen at Yokosuka and Kure for two weeks of training with units of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force in the Inland Sea. Returning to Subic Bay on 7 August, the warship spent the next 10 weeks operating locally with &quot;Constellation&quot;. Then, in response to the growing Soviet Navy presence in the Indian Ocean, several American warships—including &quot;Berkeley&quot;—received orders to &quot;show the flag&quot; in the region. Departing Subic Bay on 27 October, she conducted a four-day port visit to Singapore, before getting underway for the Indian Ocean on 8 November.

In company with Constellation and the rest of TG 77.6, &quot;Berkeley&quot; conducted 11 days of operations with Pakistani, Iranian, and British naval units before visiting Karachi, Pakistan, on 19 November. The task group then sailed into the Persian Gulf for another week of exercises before returning to Singapore on 6 December. After an upkeep period there, the guided-missile destroyer sailed for home, via Subic Bay, and arrived in San Diego on 28 January 1975.

Following a two-month, post-deployment standdown, &quot;Berkeley&quot; spent the next four months engaged in a series of inspections, engineering tests, and exercises aimed at improving her overall readiness. In August, she completed various weapons and engineering training requirements and, in September, concentrated on ASW exercises. Following several missile-firing exercises in October and an extensive alignment of all weapons systems in November, &quot;Berkeley&quot; began preparation for her next deployment.

On 30 January 1976, &quot;Berkeley&quot; departed San Diego and set course for Hawaii on the first leg of the voyage to the Far East. Once at Pearl Harbor, however, the warship suffered several engineering failures which kept her in that port through February. Finally repaired in early March, she got underway on 12 March and, after a fuel stop at Guam, moored at Subic Bay on 1 April. Over the next three months, the guided missile destroyer conducted several &quot;war-at-sea&quot; exercises in the Philippines, including a missile firing exercise in late May and an ASW exercise with the frigates and in mid-June. Sailing north on 14 July, she visited Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and took part in Exercise &quot;Sharkhunt XVI&quot;—an ASW exercise with naval units from Taiwan—before returning to Subic Bay on 29 July. Underway again on 3 August, &quot;Berkeley&quot; carried out another missile exercise—knocking down one drone with two missiles fired—before sailing for home on 8 August. Following stops at Guam—where she received 10 days of tender availability—and at Pearl Harbor, the warship returned to San Diego on 6 September. Save for a brief two-week planeguard exercise with &quot;Constellation&quot; in early December, the guided-missile destroyer spent the remainder of the year in port.

Over the first five months of 1977, &quot;Berkeley&quot; stood several inspections and made other preparations in anticipation of an overhaul in Bremerton. Entering the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 6 June, the warship received new turbo-generators, a satellite communications system, and upgrades to her tactical data system. Floated out of drydock on 16 December, she remained pierside until dock trials were complete on 4 May 1978. Underway for sea trials the following day, the warship finally sailed home to San Diego on 13 June, arriving there on the 23d, after stops at Seal Beach and Long Beach. She spent the rest of the year testing her weapon systems and training with the newly installed equipment.

Early in 1979, &quot;Berkeley&quot; helped to test and evaluate two new missile systems. In February, she had one of the early Tomahawk missiles test-fired at her (set to fly close by) to see if the incoming Tomahawk could be acquired; and, in April, she made eight evaluation launches of the Standard missile. After passing a combat systems readiness test in May, the warship then prepared for her first overseas deployment in almost two years. Departing San Diego on 8 August, the guided missile destroyer transited the Pacific as part of Destroyer Squadron 13 and in the company of a Canadian Destroyer Squadron and Oiler with stops in Pearl Harbor, Midway, (off Midway the destroyers practices ASW atop a Soviet submarine), Guam and Subic Bay, and arrived in Yokosuka on 1 September. There, she joined &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and put to sea for seven weeks of operations in the East China Sea. During this time, &quot;Berkeley&quot; also made port visits to Hong Kong and Subic Bay. On 22 October, following the assassination of South Korean President Park Chung Hee, the task group took up a position south of the peninsula. The crisis eased after a few weeks, and the task group resumed normal operations. On 10 November, the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; group steamed south for operations in the South China Sea. On 21 November, the warships received orders to proceed west in response to the takeover of the American embassy in Tehran, Iran. Arriving in the Indian Ocean on 5 December, the task group sailed to the Arabian Sea and took up a position south of the Iranian coast.

===1980s===
Following six weeks of contingency operations, &quot;Berkeley&quot; began her long transit home on 24 January 1980, arriving in San Diego via Subic Bay and Pearl Harbor on 19 February. Later that spring, the warship conducted several gunfire and missile-firing exercises before beginning a restricted availability at Long Beach on 5 May. During the ensuing six weeks, &quot;Berkeley&quot; received extensive engineering work, including some new boiler tubes, and equipment upgrades to her weapons and operations departments. The guided missile destroyer then spent the rest of the year conducting engineering tests and working out her new combat systems in air and surface gunnery and missile shoots.

Underway on 27 February 1981, &quot;Berkeley&quot; sailed to Pearl Harbor and then on to Guam, mooring there on 21 March. While en route to Subic Bay in early April, she conducted both antisubmarine and antiair warfare exercises, an underway routine that became the pattern for this deployment. The warship then joined other 7th Fleet units for a port visit to Pattaya Beach, Thailand, before participating in Exercise &quot;Sea-Siam 81-2.&quot; &quot;Berkeley&quot; joined Royal Thai Navy warships in a variety of maneuvers, including tactical communications, formation keeping, and antisubmarine warfare. The guided missile destroyer then moved back to Subic Bay, after diverting for stops at Sattahip, Thailand, and Hong Kong, where she joined the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; battle group. Departing on 13 May, the group sailed into the Indian Ocean for six weeks of antiair and surface warfare exercises before putting into Geraldton, Australia, for a week-long port visit in mid-July. &quot;Berkeley&quot; returned to Subic Bay on 4 August for three weeks of maintenance before steaming for home on 1 September.

Arriving in San Diego on 21 September, the warship spent the next six months engaged in local operations and preparing for a regular overhaul. This routine was only broken by a call at San Francisco in late January 1982 and four-day visit to Mazatlan, Mexico, starting on 20 February. Entering the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 29 March, &quot;Berkeley&quot; received new engineering controls, upgrades to her electronic warfare, communications, sonar, and weapons systems—including the new Harpoon weapons system. Perhaps even more important to her crew, she also received a brand new air conditioning system. Underway for sea trials on 18 March, the guided-missile destroyer carried out a series of evaluations, local operations, and refresher training over the summer and fall in preparation for her next deployment. These included underway exercises with the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; battle group in September and November.

After a flurry of preparations in the new year, she finally put to sea for the western Pacific on 13 January 1984, as part of Carrier Battle Group &quot;Bravo&quot; (CTF 37.1). Arriving in the Philippines on 30 January, &quot;Berkeley&quot; trained on the Tabones gunfire range during February; and, following a 12-day visit to Subic Bay, the guided-missile destroyer steamed to Pusan, South Korea, in early March. There, between 19 and 29 March, she participated in amphibious Exercise &quot;Team Spirit 84.&quot; She then sailed to Subic Bay, for brief repairs, before steaming west for the Strait of Malacca on 7 April.

With the establishment of the United States Central Command (CentCom) the previous year—partly in response to the outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War in 1980—Navy warships began patrolling the Arabian Sea in support of CentCom&#x27;s mission to protect American security interests in the Middle East. &quot;Berkeley&quot; arrived in the Arabian Sea on 16 April and served there for the next six weeks, helping to assure Western access to oil and seeking to stem the spread of Soviet influence in the region. During this period, she visited Al Masirah, Oman, for tender availability alongside .

After another tender availability at Diego Garcia during the second week of June, the warship sailed for home on 15 June. En route, she stopped at Fremantle, Australia; Subic Bay, Philippines; and Pearl Harbor in Hawaii before arriving in San Diego on 1 August. &quot;Berkeley&quot; spent the next nine months conducting local operations in California waters, the highlight of which was the mid-October surveillance of a Soviet intelligence gathering trawler prowling the missile-test range at San Clemente Island. The warship then operated locally that spring until entering the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 3 May 1985 for repairs to her sonar dome. Resuming local operations on 20 May, &quot;Berkeley&quot; followed the familiar duty pattern—independent steaming off southern California punctuated by regular upkeep periods in port.

The warship&#x27;s first exercise in the new year took place between 14 and 22 January 1986 when &quot;Berkeley&quot; conducted a naval gunfire support exercise at San Clemente Island. Then, after a mid-March command inspection and upkeep early in April, she took part in &quot;RimPac 86,&quot; an international naval exercise held in Hawaiian waters between 21 May and 12 June. After two more months of local training operations and other preparatory tasks, &quot;Berkeley&quot; got underway for a Far Eastern cruise on 12 August.

In a change of pace from her usual route, the guided missile destroyer followed a great circle route through the northern Pacific and the Bering Sea before arriving at Pusan, South Korea, on 1 September. After an ASW exercise with units of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force at mid-month, and another ASW exercise with South Korean warships in mid-October, &quot;Berkeley&quot; sailed south for the Philippines on 7 November. Following a brief stop at Subic Bay to refuel, the warship conducted Exercise &quot;Burgonex 86&quot; with the Royal Brunei Armed Forces between 15 and 23 November. Afterwards, she visited Pattaya Beach, Thailand, and then made a &quot;freedom-of-navigation&quot; demonstration off the coasts of Kampuchea and Vietnam in early December. &quot;Berkeley&quot; then stopped at Hong Kong and Subic Bay for port visits, before ending the year on her way to Chinhae, South Korea.

Arriving there on 3 January 1987, the warship conducted an ASW exercise in the Sea of Japan in early January before heading for home on 12 January. The next day, however, she suffered a pressure failure in her sonar dome and diverted to Guam for temporary repairs. Underway again on 24 January, &quot;Berkeley&quot; returned to San Diego, via Pearl Harbor, on 12 February. After a two-week leave and upkeep standdown, the warship resumed her familiar west coast routine. This included various weapons and supply inspections, equipment alterations in the shipyard—including more repairs to her sonar dome that summer—and training ashore for crew members. She rounded out the year with refresher training off southern California punctuated by minor repair periods alongside .

&quot;Berkeley&quot; spent the spring of 1988 preparing for her next overseas deployment, on which she embarked on 6 July. In company with the battleship and TG 70.1, the warship took the great circle route to South Korea, arriving at Pusan on 24 July. The group participated in surface warfare exercises with the South Korean Navy before heading south to Subic Bay on 5 August. Following a short availability there, &quot;Berkeley&quot; detached from the task group and continued farther south, arriving in Darwin, Australia, on 26 August. As part of Australia&#x27;s bicentennial celebration, the guided missile destroyer spent the next five weeks visiting ports on Australia&#x27;s northern and eastern coasts. Starting with a visit to Cairns from 4 to 8 September, she moved on to stops at Townsville, Mackay, and Gladstone before putting into Sydney on 26 August for a week-long naval celebration with over 60 warships from 16 countries. &quot;Berkeley&quot; then made a visit to Bell Bay in Tasmania before rendezvousing with &quot;New Jersey&quot; on 18 October for the transit home, arriving in San Diego via Pearl Harbor on 9 November.

Following a tender availability, the guided-missile destroyer spent the first nine months of 1989 conducting local training operations, standing combat systems&#x27; inspections, and undergoing a phased maintenance availability at the Continental Marine Shipyard between 17 April and 5 July. After a final series of inspections in August, &quot;Berkeley&quot; got underway on 18 September in company with the carrier and six other warships bound for the Far East once more. Steaming north to the Sea of Japan, the warship participated in &quot;PacEx &#x27;89,&quot; a joint exercise with units of the South Korean and Japanese Navies. During most of October, she carried out antiair, surface, and subsurface warfare exercises off the coasts of Korea and Japan, including four SEAL team insertions, before putting into Hong Kong on 31 October.

Sailing south, &quot;Berkeley&quot; arrived in Subic Bay on 11 November. After a two-week availability there, she moved to the Tabones training range to keep up her gunnery prowess. On 30 November, in response to a coup attempt against the Aquino government in Manila, the warship put to sea with the Enterprise battle group for contingency operations. As the crisis eased, &quot;Berkeley&quot; detached from the battle group on 12 December and sailed east to Thailand. En route, the guided missile destroyer took part in more &quot;freedom-of-navigation&quot; missions off Vietnam and Kampuchea, before arriving at Pattaya Beach on 14 November. After four days there, the warship moved on to Singapore for a week of upkeep.

Passing through the Strait of Malacca in late December, &quot;Berkeley&quot; and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; battle group sailed into the Indian Ocean and moored at Diego Garcia Island on 5 January 1990. Next, the group operated in the northern Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf—keeping an eye on the still-tense ceasefire between Iran and Iraq—until putting into Muscat, Oman, for a port visit on 20 January. Following exercises with the Sultan of Oman&#x27;s Navy, &quot;Berkeley&quot; left the battle group on 1 February and headed back east. She participated in exercises with the Royal Thai Navy on 3 February and, after a five-day visit to Phuket, Thailand, steamed into Subic Bay on 18 February. From there, the warship continued toward home and arrived at San Diego on 15 March.

After a four-week leave and upkeep period, &quot;Berkeley&quot; resumed local operations out of San Diego. In addition to her usual training activities, however, the warship made several short indoctrination cruises for midshipmen. She also got underway in mid-July for a week of law enforcement operations with the United States Coast Guard. During these missions, which were intended to help interdict drug smuggling, the warship used surface-search radars and other equipment to spot small craft, which were then boarded by Coast Guard detachments. Although no drug seizures occurred, the warship did help the Coast Guard enforce maritime safety regulations. After returning to port on 23 July, &quot;Berkeley&quot; spent the rest of the year engaged in engineering inspections and exams.

On 11 February 1991, the warship embarked on another Coast Guard law enforcement mission off Central America. &quot;Berkeley&quot; began counternarcotics patrols off Baja California in mid-February; and, save for a 22 February visit to Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala, there she remained for the next five weeks. Returning to San Diego on 8 April for maintenance, the guided-missile destroyer then set out on a two-week Coast Guard law enforcement patrol on the 26th. This was followed in mid-May by a gunnery and missile exercise.

In early June, &quot;Berkeley&quot; departed San Diego and headed north to Oregon for the Portland Rose Festival, remaining there until 12 June. The warship returned to San Diego three days later and, over the next six weeks, conducted two midshipmen training cruises and another law enforcement patrol. In August and September, the guided-missile destroyer concentrated on refresher training and, in early October, she participated in underway training while in transit to San Francisco for &quot;Fleet Week &#x27;91.&quot; Returning to San Diego on 25 October, the warship carried out a succession of engineering drills in the southern California operating area through November. Heading back to Portland on 2 December, &quot;Berkeley&quot; took part in the city&#x27;s 50th anniversary commemoration of the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

In light of the defense budget cutbacks following the end of the Cold War, the Navy made its 1990 decision to retire 54 ships. Thus, &quot;Berkeley&quot; was tapped for deactivation and eventual foreign transfer. Inactivated at San Diego on 1 May 1992, she spent the summer preparing for transfer to the Greek Navy. &quot;Berkeley&quot; was decommissioned at San Diego on 30 September 1992, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 October 1992. She was transferred to the Hellenic Navy that same day and served as &quot;Themistoklis&quot; (D221).

&quot;Berkeley&quot; received 11 battle stars for Vietnam service.

<text>The European badger (Meles meles), also known as the Eurasian badger, is a badger species in the family Mustelidae native to Europe and West Asia and parts of Central Asia. It is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List, as it has a wide range and a large, stable population size which is thought to be increasing in some regions. Several subspecies are recognized, with the nominate subspecies (&quot;M. m. meles&quot;) predominating in most of Europe. In Europe, where no other badger species commonly occurs, it is generally just called the &quot;badger&quot;.

The European badger is a powerfully built, black, white, brown, and grey animal with a small head, a stocky body, small black eyes, and a short tail. Its weight varies, being (15–29 lb) in spring, but building up to in autumn before the winter sleep period. It is nocturnal and is a social, burrowing animal that sleeps during the day in one of several setts in its territorial range. These burrows have multiple chambers and entrances, and are extensive systems of underground passages of length. They house several badger families that use these setts for decades. Badgers are fussy over the cleanliness of their burrow, carrying in fresh bedding and removing soiled material, and they defecate in latrines strategically situated outside their setts or en route to other setts.

Although taxonomically classified as a carnivoran, the European badger is an omnivore, feeding on a wide variety of plant and animal foods, including earthworms, large insects, small mammals, carrion, cereals, and tubers. Litters of up to five cubs are produced in spring. The young are weaned a few months later, but usually remain within the family group. The European badger has been known to share its burrow with other species, such as rabbits, red foxes, and raccoon dogs, but it can be ferocious when provoked, a trait which has been exploited in the now-illegal blood sport of badger-baiting. Like many wild and domesticated species of mammals, badgers can be carriers of bovine tuberculosis, which can spread between species and can be particularly detrimental to cattle. In England, badger populations are culled to try to reduce the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in cattle, although the efficacy of this practice is strongly disputed, and badger culls are widely considered cruel and inhumane.

==Nomenclature==
The source of the word &quot;badger&quot; is uncertain. The Oxford English Dictionary states it probably derives from &quot;badge&quot; + &quot;-ard&quot;, a reference to the white mark on its forehead that resembles a badge, and may date to the early 16th century. The French word (&#x27;digger&#x27;) has also been suggested as a source. A male badger is a boar, a female is a sow, and a young badger is a cub. A badger&#x27;s home is called a sett. Badger colonies are often called clans.

The far older name &quot;brock&quot; (), () is a Celtic loanword (cf. Gaelic and Welsh , from Proto-Celtic ) meaning &#x27;grey&#x27;. The Proto-Germanic term was (cf. German , Dutch , Norwegian ; Early Modern English &quot;dasse&quot;), probably from the PIE root &#x27;to construct&#x27;, which suggests that the badger was named after its digging of setts (tunnels); the Germanic term became or , in Latin glosses, replacing (&#x27;marten&#x27; or &#x27;badger&#x27;), and from these words the common Romance terms for the animal evolved (Italian , French —now is more common—, Catalan , Spanish , Portuguese ) except Asturian .

Until the mid-18th century, European badgers were variously known in English as brock, pate, grey, and bawson. The name &quot;bawson&quot; is derived from &quot;bawsened&quot;, which refers to something striped with white. &quot;Pate&quot; is a local name that was once popular in northern England. The name &quot;badget&quot; was once common, but only used in Norfolk, while &quot;earth dog&quot; was used in southern Ireland. The badger is commonly referred to in Welsh as a (&#x27;earth pig&#x27;).
==Taxonomy==
&quot;Ursus meles&quot; was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the badger in his work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. 

=== Evolution ===
The species likely evolved from the Chinese &quot;Meles thorali&quot; of the early Pleistocene. The modern species originated during the early Middle Pleistocene, with fossil sites occurring in Episcopia, Grombasek, Süssenborn, Hundsheim, Erpfingen, Koněprusy, Mosbach 2, and Stránská Skála. A comparison between fossil and living specimens shows a marked progressive adaptation to omnivory, namely in the increase in the molars&#x27; surface areas and the modification of the carnassials. Occasionally, badger bones are discovered in earlier strata, due to the burrowing habits of the species.

===Subspecies===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, several badger type specimens were described and proposed as subspecies. , eight subspecies were recognized as valid taxa, but four (&quot;canescens&quot;, &quot;arcalus&quot;, &quot;rhodius&quot;, &quot;severzovi&quot;) are now considered to belong to a distinct species, the Caucasian badger (&quot;M. canescens&quot;).

==Description==

European badgers are powerfully built animals with small heads, thick, short necks, stocky, wedge-shaped bodies and short tails. Their feet are plantigrade or semidigitigrade and short, with five toes on each foot. The limbs are short and massive, with naked lower surfaces on the feet. The claws are strong, elongated and have an obtuse end, which assists in digging. The claws are not retractable, and the hind claws wear with age. Old badgers sometimes have their hind claws almost completely worn away from constant use. Their snouts, which are used for digging and probing, are muscular and flexible. The eyes are small and the ears short and tipped with white. Whiskers are present on the snout and above the eyes.

Boars typically have broader heads, thicker necks and narrower tails than sows, which are sleeker, have narrower, less domed heads and fluffier tails. The guts of badgers are longer than those of red foxes, reflecting their omnivorous diet. The small intestine has a mean length of and lacks a cecum. Both sexes have three pairs of nipples but these are more developed in females. European badgers cannot flex their backs as martens, polecats and wolverines can, nor can they stand fully erect like honey badgers, though they can move quickly at full gallop.

Adults measure in shoulder height, in body length, in tail length, in hind foot length and in ear height. Males (or boars) slightly exceed females (or sows) in measurements, but can weigh considerably more. Their weights vary seasonally, growing from spring to autumn and reaching a peak just before the winter. During the summer, European badgers commonly weigh and in autumn.

The average weight of adults in the Białowieża Forest was in spring but up to in autumn, 46% higher than the spring low mass. In Woodchester Park, England, adults in spring weighed on average and in fall average . In Doñana National Park, average weight of adult badgers is reported as , perhaps in accordance with Bergmann&#x27;s rule, that its size decreases in relatively warmer climates. Sows can attain a top autumn weight of around , while exceptionally large boars have been reported in autumn. The heaviest verified was , though unverified specimens have been reported to and even (if so, the heaviest weight for any terrestrial mustelid). If average weights are used, the European badger ranks as the second largest terrestrial mustelid, behind only the wolverine. Although their sense of smell is acute, their eyesight is monochromatic as has been shown by their lack of reaction to red lanterns. Only moving objects attract their attention. Their hearing is no better than that of humans.
European badger skulls are quite massive, heavy and elongated. Their braincases are oval in outline, while the facial part of their skulls is elongated and narrow. Adults have prominent sagittal crests which can reach 15 mm tall in old males, and are more strongly developed than those of honey badgers. Aside from anchoring the jaw muscles, the thickness of the crests protect their skulls from hard blows. Similar to martens, the dentition of European badgers is well-suited for their omnivorous diets. Their incisors are small and chisel-shaped, their canine teeth are prominent and their carnassials are not overly specialized. Their molars are flattened and adapted for grinding. Their jaws are powerful enough to crush most bones; a provoked badger was once reported as biting down on a man&#x27;s wrist so severely that his hand had to be amputated. The dental formula is .

Scent glands are present below the base of the tail and on the anus. The subcaudal gland secretes a musky-smelling, cream-coloured fatty substance, while the anal glands secrete a stronger-smelling, yellowish-brown fluid.

===Fur===

In winter, the fur on the back and flanks is long and coarse, consisting of bristly guard hairs with a sparse, soft undercoat. The belly fur consists of short, sparse hairs, with skin being visible in the inguinal region. Guard hair length on the middle of the back is in winter. Prior to the winter, the throat, lower neck, chest and legs are black. The belly is of a lighter, brownish tint, while the inguinal region is brownish-grey. The general colour of the back and sides is light silvery-grey, with straw-coloured highlights on the sides. The tail has long and coarse hairs, and is generally the same colour as the back. Two black bands pass along the head, starting from the upper lip and passing upwards to the whole base of the ears. The bands sometimes extend along the neck and merge with the colour of the upper body. The front parts of the bands are , and widen to in the ear region. A wide, white band extends from the nose tip through the forehead and crown. White markings occur on the lower part of the head, and extend backwards to a great part of the neck&#x27;s length. The summer fur is much coarser, shorter and sparser, and is deeper in colour, with the black tones becoming brownish, sometimes with yellowish tinges. Partial melanism in badgers is known, and albinos and leucists are not uncommon. Albino badgers can be pure white or yellowish with pink eyes, while leucistic ones are the same but with normal eyes instead. Erythristic badgers are more common than the former, being characterized by having a sandy-red colour on the usually black parts of the body. Yellow badgers are also known.

==Distribution and habitat==
The European badger is native to most of Europe. Its range includes Albania, Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Crete, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine.

The distributional boundary between the ranges of European and Asian badgers is the Volga River, the European species being situated on the western bank. The boundary between the ranges of the European and Caucasian badgers is in the North Caucasus, but a clear boundary has not been defined, and they are sympatric in some regions, potentially forming a hybrid zone. They are common in European Russia, with 30,000 individuals having been recorded there in 1990. They are abundant and increasing throughout their range, partly due to a reduction in rabies in Central Europe. In the UK, badgers experienced a 77% increase in numbers during the 1980s and 1990s. The badger population in Great Britain in 2012 is estimated to be 300,000.

The European badger is found in deciduous and mixed woodlands, clearings, spinneys, pastureland and scrub, including Mediterranean maquis shrubland. It has adapted to life in suburban areas and urban parks, although not to the extent of red foxes. In mountainous areas it occurs up to an altitude of .

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Social and territorial behaviour===

European badgers are the most social of badgers, forming groups of six adults on average, though larger associations of up to 23 individuals have been recorded. Group size may be related to habitat composition. Under optimal conditions, badger territories can be as small as , but may be as large as in marginal areas. Badger territories can be identified by the presence of communal latrines and well-worn paths. It is mainly males that are involved in territorial aggression. A hierarchical social system is thought to exist among badgers and large powerful boars seem to assert dominance over smaller males. Large boars sometimes intrude into neighbouring territories during the main mating season in early spring.

Sparring and more vicious fights generally result from territorial defense in the breeding season. However, in general, animals within and outside a group show considerable tolerance of each other. Boars tend to mark their territories more actively than sows, with their territorial activity increasing during the mating season in early spring. Badgers groom each other very thoroughly with their claws and teeth. Grooming may have a social function. They are crepuscular and nocturnal in habits. Aggression among badgers is largely associated with territorial defence and mating. When fighting, they bite each other on the neck and rump, while running and chasing each other and injuries incurred in such fights can be severe and sometimes fatal. When attacked by dogs or sexually excited, badgers may raise their tails and fluff up their fur.
European badgers have an extensive vocal repertoire. When threatened, they emit deep growls and, when fighting, make low kekkering noises. They bark when surprised, whicker when playing or in distress, and emit a piercing scream when alarmed or frightened.

===Denning behaviour===


Like other badger species, European badgers are burrowing animals. However, the dens they construct (called setts) are the most complex, and are passed on from generation to generation. The number of exits in one sett can vary from a few to fifty. These setts can be vast, and can sometimes accommodate multiple families. When this happens, each family occupies its own passages and nesting chambers. Some setts may have exits which are only used in times of danger or play. A typical passage has a wide base and a height. Three sleeping chambers occur in a family unit, some of which are open at both ends. The nesting chamber is located from the opening, and is situated more than a underground, in some cases . Generally, the passages are long. The nesting chamber is on average , and are high.

Badgers dig and collect bedding throughout the year, particularly in autumn and spring. Sett maintenance is usually carried out by subordinate sows and dominant boars. The chambers are frequently lined with bedding, brought in on dry nights, which consists of grass, bracken, straw, leaves and moss. Up to 30 bundles can be carried to the sett on a single night. European badgers are fastidiously clean animals which regularly clear out and discard old bedding. During the winter, they may take their bedding outside on sunny mornings and retrieve it later in the day. Spring cleaning is connected with the birth of cubs, and may occur several times during the summer to prevent parasite levels building up.

If a badger dies within the sett, its conspecifics will seal off the chamber and dig a new one. Some badgers will drag their dead out of the sett and bury them outside. A sett is almost invariably located near a tree, which is used by badgers for stretching or claw scraping. Badgers defecate in latrines, which are located near the sett and at strategic locations on territorial boundaries or near places with abundant food supplies.

In extreme cases, when there is a lack of suitable burrowing grounds, badgers may move into haystacks in winter. They may share their setts with red foxes or European rabbits. The badgers may provide protection for the rabbits against other predators. The rabbits usually avoid predation by the badgers by inhabiting smaller, hard to reach chambers.

===Reproduction and development===

Estrus in European badgers lasts four to six days and may occur throughout the year, though there is a peak in spring. Sexual maturity in boars is usually attained at the age of twelve to fifteen months but this can range from nine months to two years. Males are normally fecund during January–May, with spermatogenesis declining in summer. Sows usually begin ovulating in their second year, though some exceptionally begin at nine months. They can mate at any time of the year, though the main peak occurs in February–May, when mature sows are in postpartal estrus and young animals experience their first estrus. Matings occurring outside this period typically occur in sows which either failed to mate earlier in the year or matured slowly. Badgers are usually monogamous; boars typically mate with one female for life, whereas sows have been known to mate with more than one male. Mating lasts for fifteen to sixty minutes, though the pair may briefly copulate for a minute or two when the sow is not in estrus. A delay of two to nine months precedes the fertilized eggs implanting into the wall of the uterus, though matings in December can result in immediate implantation. Ordinarily, implantation happens in December, with a gestation period lasting seven weeks. Cubs are usually born in mid-January to mid-March within underground chambers containing bedding. In areas where the countryside is waterlogged, cubs may be born above ground in buildings. Typically, only dominant sows can breed, as they suppress the reproduction of subordinate females.

The average litter consists of one to five cubs. Although many cubs are sired by resident males, up to 54% can be fathered by boars from different colonies. Dominant sows may kill the cubs of subordinates. Cubs are born pink, with greyish, silvery fur and fused eyelids. Neonatal badgers are in body length on average and weigh , with cubs from large litters being smaller. By three to five days, their claws become pigmented, and individual dark hairs begin to appear. Their eyes open at four to five weeks and their milk teeth erupt about the same time. They emerge from their setts at eight weeks of age, and begin to be weaned at twelve weeks, though they may still suckle until they are four to five months old. Subordinate females assist the mother in guarding, feeding and grooming the cubs. Cubs fully develop their adult coats at six to nine weeks. In areas with medium to high badger populations, dispersal from the natal group is uncommon, though badgers may temporarily visit other colonies. Badgers can live for up to about fifteen years in the wild.

===Winter sleep===
Badgers begin to prepare for winter sleep during late summer by accumulating fat reserves, which reach a peak in October. During this period, the sett is cleaned and the nesting chamber is filled with bedding. Upon retiring to sleep, badgers block their sett entrances with dry leaves and earth. They typically stop leaving their setts once snow has fallen. In Russia and the Nordic countries, European badgers retire for winter sleep from late October to mid-November and emerge from their setts in March and early April. In areas such as England and Transcaucasia, where winters are less harsh, badgers either forgo winter sleep entirely or spend long periods underground, emerging in mild spells.

===Diet===
European badgers are among the least carnivorous members of the Carnivora; they are highly adaptable and opportunistic omnivores, whose diet encompasses a wide range of animals and plants. Earthworms are their most important food source, followed by large insects, carrion, cereals, fruit and small mammals, including rabbits, mice, rats, voles, shrews, moles and hedgehogs. Insect prey includes chafers, dung and ground beetles, caterpillars, leatherjackets, and the nests of wasps and bumblebees. They are able to destroy wasp nests, consuming the occupants, combs, and envelope, such as that of &quot;Vespula rufa&quot; nests, since their thick skin and body hair protect the badgers from stings. Cereal food includes wheat, oats, maize and occasionally barley. Fruits include windfall apples, pears, plums, blackberries, bilberries, raspberries, cherries, strawberries, acorns, beechmast, pignuts and wild arum corms.

Occasionally, they feed on medium to large birds, amphibians, fish, small reptiles including tortoises and lizards, snails, slugs, fungi, tubers and green food such as clover and grass, particularly in winter and during droughts. Badgers characteristically capture large numbers of one food type in each hunt. Generally, they do not eat more than of food per day, with young specimens yet to attain one year of age eating more than adults. An adult badger weighing eats a quantity of food equal to 3.4% of its body weight. Badgers typically eat prey on the spot, and rarely transport it to their setts. Surplus killing has been observed in chicken coops.
Badgers prey on rabbits throughout the year, especially during times when their young are available. They catch young rabbits by locating their position in their nest by scent, then dig vertically downwards to them. In mountainous or hilly districts, where vegetable food is scarce, badgers rely on rabbits as a principal food source. Adult rabbits are usually avoided, unless they are wounded or caught in traps. They consume them by turning them inside out and eating the meat, leaving the inverted skin uneaten. Hedgehogs are eaten in a similar manner. In areas where badgers are common, hedgehogs are scarce. Some rogue badgers may kill lambs, though this is very rare; they may be erroneously implicated in lamb killings through the presence of discarded wool and bones near their setts, though foxes, which occasionally live alongside badgers, are often the culprits, as badgers do not transport food to their setts. They typically kill lambs by biting them behind the shoulder. Poultry and game birds are also taken only rarely. Some badgers may build their setts in close proximity to poultry or game farms without ever causing damage. In the rare instances in which badgers do kill reared birds, the killings usually occur in February–March, when food is scarce due to harsh weather and increases in badger populations. Badgers can easily breach bee hives with their jaws, and are mostly indifferent to bee stings, even when set upon by swarms.

===Relationships with other non-human predators===
European badgers have few natural enemies. While normally docile, badgers can become extremely aggressive and ferocious when cornered, making it dangerous for predators to target them. Grey wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), Eurasian lynxes (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;) and brown bears (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;), Europe&#x27;s three largest remaining land predators, and large domestic dogs (&quot;C. familiaris&quot;) can pose a threat to adult badgers, though deaths caused by them are quantitatively rare as these predators are often limited in population due to human persecution and usually prefer easier, larger prey like ungulates, while badgers may fight viciously if aware of a predator and cornered without an escape route. They may live alongside red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) in isolated sections of large burrows. The two species possibly tolerate each other out of commensalism; foxes provide badgers with food scraps, while badgers maintain the shared burrow&#x27;s cleanliness. However, cases are known of badgers driving vixens from their dens and destroying their litters without eating them. In turn, red foxes are known to have killed badger cubs in spring. Golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) are known predators of European badgers and attacks by them on badger cubs are not infrequent, including cases where they have been pulled out directly from below the legs of their mothers, and even adult badgers may be attacked by this eagle species when emerging weak and hungry from hibernation. Eurasian eagle owls (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;) may also take an occasional cub and other large raptors such as white-tailed eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;) and greater spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga clanga&quot;) are considered potential badger cub predators. Raccoon dogs may extensively use badger setts for shelter. There are many known cases of badgers and raccoon dogs wintering in the same hole, possibly because badgers enter hibernation two weeks earlier than the latter, and leave two weeks later. In exceptional cases, badger and raccoon dog cubs may coexist in the same burrow. Badgers may drive out or kill raccoon dogs if they overstay their welcome.

===Diseases and parasites===
Bovine tuberculosis (bovine TB) caused by &quot;Mycobacterium bovis&quot; is a major mortality factor in badgers, though infected badgers can live and successfully breed for years before succumbing. The disease was first observed in badgers in 1951 in Switzerland where they were believed to have contracted it from chamois (&quot;Rupicapra rupicapra&quot;) or roe deer (&quot;Capreolus capreolus&quot;). It was detected in the United Kingdom in 1971 where it was linked to an outbreak of bovine TB in cows. The evidence appears to indicate that the badger is the primary reservoir of infection for cattle in the southwest of England, Wales and Ireland. Since then there has been considerable controversy as to whether culling badgers will effectively reduce or eliminate bovine TB in cattle.

Badgers are vulnerable to the mustelid herpesvirus-1, as well as rabies and canine distemper, though the latter two are absent in Great Britain. Other diseases found in European badgers include arteriosclerosis, pneumonia, pleurisy, nephritis, enteritis, polyarthritis and lymphosarcoma.

Internal parasites of badgers include trematodes, nematodes and several species of tapeworm. Ectoparasites carried by them include the fleas &quot;Paraceras melis&quot; (the badger flea), &quot;Chaetopsylla trichosa&quot; and &quot;Pulex irritans&quot; (the human flea), the lice &quot;Trichodectes melis&quot; and the ticks &quot;Ixodes ricinus&quot;, &quot;I. canisuga&quot;, &quot;I. hexagonus&quot;, &quot;I. reduvius&quot; and &quot;I. melicula&quot;. They also suffer from mange. They spend much time grooming, individuals concentrating on their own ventral areas, alternating one side with the other, while social grooming occurs with one individual grooming another on its dorsal surface. Fleas tried to avoid the scratching, retreating rapidly downwards and backwards through the fur. This was in contrast to fleas away from their host, which ran upwards and jumped when disturbed. The grooming seems to disadvantage fleas rather than merely having a social function.

==Conservation==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature rates the European badger as being of least concern. This is because it is a relatively common species with a wide range and populations are generally stable. In Central Europe it has become more abundant in recent decades due to a reduction in the incidence of rabies. In other areas it has also fared well, with increases in numbers in Western Europe and the United Kingdom. However, in some areas of intensive agriculture it has reduced in numbers due to loss of habitat and in others it is hunted as a pest.

==Cultural significance==

Badgers play a part in European folklore and are featured in modern literature. In Irish mythology, badgers are portrayed as shape-shifters and kinsmen to Tadg, the king of Tara and foster father of Cormac mac Airt. In one story, Tadg berates his adopted son for having killed and prepared some badgers for dinner. In German folklore, the badger is portrayed as a cautious, peace-loving Philistine, who loves more than anything his home, family and comfort, though he can become aggressive if surprised. He is a cousin of Reynard the Fox, whom he uselessly tries to convince to return to the path of righteousness.

In Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, Mr. Badger is depicted as a gruff, solitary figure who &quot;simply hates society&quot;, yet is a good friend to Mole and Ratty. As a friend of Toad&#x27;s now-deceased father, he is often firm and serious with Toad, but at the same time generally patient and well-meaning towards him. He can be seen as a wise hermit, a good leader and gentleman, embodying common sense. He is also brave and a skilled fighter, and helps rid Toad Hall of invaders from the wild wood.

The &quot;Frances&quot; series of children&#x27;s books by Russell and Lillian Hoban depicts an anthropomorphic badger family.

In T. H. White&#x27;s Arthurian series &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, the young King Arthur is transformed into a badger by Merlin as part of his education. He meets with an older badger who tells him &quot;I can only teach you two things – to dig, and love your home.&quot;

A villainous badger named Tommy Brock appears in Beatrix Potter&#x27;s 1912 book &quot;The Tale of Mr. Tod&quot;. He is shown kidnapping the children of Benjamin Bunny and his wife Flopsy, and hiding them in an oven at the home of Mr. Tod the fox, whom he fights at the end of the book. The portrayal of the badger as a filthy animal which appropriates fox dens was criticized from a naturalistic viewpoint, though the inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger. A wise old badger named Trufflehunter appears in C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, where he aids Caspian X in his struggle against King Miraz.

A badger takes a prominent role in Colin Dann&#x27;s &quot;The Animals of Farthing Wood&quot; series as second in command to Fox. The badger is also the house symbol for Hufflepuff in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book series. The &quot;Redwall&quot; series also has the Badger Lords, who rule the extinct volcano fortress of Salamandastron and are renowned as fierce warriors. The children&#x27;s television series &quot;Bodger &amp; Badger&quot; was popular on CBBC during the 1990s and was set around the mishaps of a mashed potato-loving badger and his human companion.

An unnamed badger is part of Bosnian Serb writer Petar Kočić&#x27;s satirical play &quot;Badger on Tribunal&quot; in which local farmer David Štrbac attempts to sue a badger for eating his crops. It is actually highly critical towards Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the beginning of the 20th century. In honor of Kočić and his Badger, satirical theater in Banja Luka is named Jazavac (Badger).

===Heraldry===

European badger appears on the coat of arms of the municipality of Luhanka in Central Finland, referring to the former importance of the fur trade in the locality. The badger is also the title animal of the Nurmijärvi municipality in Uusimaa, Finland, where it is a very common mammal.

===Hunting===

European badgers are of little significance to hunting economies, though they may be actively hunted locally. Methods used for hunting badgers include catching them in jaw traps, ambushing them at their setts with guns, smoking them out of their earths and through the use of specially bred dogs such as Fox Terriers and Dachshunds to dig them out. Badgers are, however, notoriously durable animals; their skins are thick, loose and covered in long hair which acts as protection, and their heavily ossified skulls allow them to shrug off most blunt traumas, as well as shotgun pellets.

===Badger-baiting===

Badger-baiting was once a popular blood sport, in which badgers were captured alive, placed in boxes, and attacked with dogs. In the UK, this was outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 and again by the Protection of Animals Act 1911. Moreover, the cruelty towards and killing of the badger constitute offences under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 (c. 51), and further offences under this act are inevitably committed to facilitate badger-baiting (such as interfering with a sett, or the taking or the very possession of a badger for purposes other than nursing an injured animal to health). If convicted, badger-baiters may face a sentence of up to six months in jail, a fine of up to £5,000, and other punitive measures, such as community service or a ban from owning dogs.

===Culling===

Many badgers in Europe were gassed during the 1960s and 1970s to control rabies. Until the 1980s, badger culling in the United Kingdom was undertaken in the form of gassing, to control the spread of bovine tuberculosis (bTB). Limited culling resumed in 1998 as part of a 10-year randomized trial cull which was considered by John Krebs and others to show that culling was ineffective. Some groups called for a selective cull, while others favoured a programme of vaccination, and vets support the cull on compassionate grounds as they say that the illness causes much suffering in badgers. In 2012, the government authorized a limited cull led by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), however, this was later deferred with a wide range of reasons given. In August 2013, a full culling programme began where about 5,000 badgers were killed over six weeks in West Somerset and Gloucestershire by marksmen with high-velocity rifles using a mixture of controlled shooting and free shooting (some badgers were trapped in cages first). The cull caused many protests with emotional, economic and scientific reasons being cited. The badger is considered an iconic species of the British countryside, though is not endangered. It was claimed by shadow ministers that &quot;The government&#x27;s own figures show it will cost more than it saves...&quot;, and Lord Krebs, who led the Randomised Badger Culling Trial in the 1990s, said the two pilots &quot;will not yield any useful information&quot;. A scientific study of culling from 2013 to 2017 has shown a reduction of 36–55% incidence of bovine tuberculosis in cattle.

===Tameability===
There are several accounts of European badgers being tamed. Tame badgers can be affectionate pets, and can be trained to come to their owners when their names are called. They are easily fed, as they are not fussy eaters, and will instinctively unearth rats, moles and young rabbits without training, though they do have a weakness for pork. Although there is one record of a tame badger befriending a fox, they generally do not tolerate the presence of cats and dogs, and will chase them.

===Uses===

Badger meat is eaten in some districts of the former Soviet Union, though in most cases it is discarded. Smoked hams made from badgers were once highly esteemed in England, Wales and Ireland.

Some badger products have been used for medical purposes; badger expert Ernest Neal, quoting from an 1810 edition of &quot;The Sporting Magazine&quot;, wrote;
The flesh, blood and grease of the badger are very useful for oils, ointments, salves and powders, for shortness of breath, the cough of the lungs, for the stone, sprained sinews, collachs etc. The skin being well dressed is very warm and comfortable for ancient people who are troubled with paralytic disorders.

The hair of the European badger has been used for centuries for making sporrans and shaving brushes. Sporrans are traditionally worn as part of male Scottish highland dress. They form a bag or pocket made from a pelt and a badger or other animal&#x27;s mask may be used as a flap. The pelt was also formerly used for pistol furniture.

Back in the fighting 26 April, she remained in the war zone until returning to Yokosuka 15 June. That day her home port was changed to Pearl Harbor which she reached 26 July.

&quot;Joseph Strauss&quot; operated in the Hawaiian area until heading back for the Western Pacific 14 January 1967. She remained in the Far East until returning to Pearl Harbor on 17 June.

===Operation Praying Mantis===

On 14 April 1988, the frigate sighted three mines floating approximately one-half mile from the ship. Twenty minutes after the first sighting, as &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was backing clear of the minefield, she struck a submerged mine nearly ripping the warship in half. The crew stabilized the ship. &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was sent back to the United States for repair.

On 18 April 1988, Operation Praying Mantis took place which was an attack by U.S. Naval forces in retaliation for the Iranian mining of the Persian Gulf and damage to an American ship &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;. The battle, the largest for American surface forces since World War II, sank two Iranian warships and it also marked the first surface-to-surface missile engagement in U.S. Navy history. The Americans attacked with several groups of surface warships, plus aircraft.

In the middle of the action, &quot;Joshan&quot;, an Iranian &quot;Kaman&quot;-class fast attack craft, challenged the cruiser and Surface Action Group Charlie, firing a Harpoon missile at them. The frigate responded to the challenge by firing four Standard missiles, while &quot;Wainwright&quot; followed with two Standard missiles. The attacks destroyed the Iranian ship&#x27;s superstructure but did not immediately sink it. The three ships of SAG Charlie (&quot;Wainwright&quot;, &quot;Simpson&quot;, and ) closed on &quot;Joshan&quot;, destroying the Iranian vessel with naval gunfire. Fighting continued when the departed Bandar Abbas and challenged elements of an American surface group. The frigate was spotted by two VA-95 A-6Es while they were flying surface combat air patrol for &quot;Joseph Strauss&quot;. &quot;Sahand&quot; fired missiles at the A-6Es, and the Intruders replied with two Harpoons and four laser-guided Skipper bombs. &quot;Joseph Strauss&quot; added a Harpoon missile. Most, if not all, of the U.S. weapons hit the Iranian ship. Fires blazing on &quot;Sahand&quot;″s decks eventually reached her magazines, causing an explosion that helped sink the ship. Despite the loss of &quot;Sahand&quot;, one of Iran&#x27;s most modern ships, the Iranian navy continued to fight. Late in the day, a sister ship of &quot;Sahand&quot;, , departed from its berth and fired a surface-to-air missile at several A-6Es from VA-95. Intruder pilot Engler dropped a laser-guided bomb on &quot;Sabalan&quot;, leaving the ship dead in the water. The Iranian frigate, stern partially submerged, was taken in tow by an Iranian tugboat.

==Greek service and decommissioning==
&quot;Joseph Strauss&quot; was decommissioned on 1 February 1990, transferred to Greece on 1 October 1992 and renamed &quot;Formion&quot; (D220), for the Athenian Admiral Phormio, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 January 1995.

Greece decommissioned &quot;Formion&quot; on 29 July 2002 and the ship was sold as scrap on 19 February 2004.

<text>The internal carotid artery is an artery in the neck which supplies the anterior and middle cerebral circulation. 

In human anatomy, the internal and external carotid arise from the common carotid artery, where it bifurcates at cervical vertebrae C3 or C4. The internal carotid artery supplies the brain, including the eyes, while the external carotid nourishes other portions of the head, such as the face, scalp, skull, and meninges.

==Classification==
Terminologia Anatomica in 1998 subdivided the artery into four parts: &quot;cervical&quot;, &quot;petrous&quot;, &quot;cavernous&quot;, and &quot;cerebral&quot;. 

In clinical settings, however, usually the classification system of the internal carotid artery follows the 1996 recommendations by Bouthillier, describing seven anatomical segments of the internal carotid artery, each with a corresponding alphanumeric identifier: C1 cervical; C2 petrous; C3 lacerum; C4 cavernous; C5 clinoid; C6 ophthalmic; and C7 communicating. The Bouthillier nomenclature remains in widespread use by neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists and neurologists. 

The segments are subdivided based on anatomical and microsurgical landmarks and surrounding anatomy, more than angiographic appearance of the artery. An alternative embryologic classification system proposed by Pierre Lasjaunias and colleagues is invaluable when it comes to explanation of many internal carotid artery variants. An older clinical classification, based on pioneering work by Fischer, is mainly of historical significance.
The segments of the internal carotid artery are as follows:

* Cervical segment, or C1, identical to the commonly used cervical portion
* Petrous segment, or C2
* Lacerum segment, or C3
**C2 and C3 compose the commonly termed petrous portion
* Cavernous segment, or C4, almost identical to the commonly used cavernous portion
* Clinoid segment, or C5. This segment is not identified in some earlier classifications and lies between the commonly used cavernous portion and cerebral or supraclinoid portion.
* Ophthalmic, or supraclinoid segment, or C6
* Communicating, or terminal segment, or C7
** C6 and C7 together constitute the commonly used cerebral or supraclinoid portion.

==Course/part==
The internal carotid artery is a terminal branch of the common carotid artery; it arises around the level of the fourth cervical vertebra when the common carotid bifurcates into this artery and its more superficial counterpart, the external carotid artery.

===C1: Cervical segment===

The cervical segment, or C1, or cervical part of the internal carotid, extends from the carotid bifurcation until it enters the carotid canal in the skull anterior to the jugular foramen. 

At its origin, the internal carotid artery is somewhat dilated. This part of the artery is known as the carotid sinus or the carotid bulb. The ascending portion of the cervical segment occurs distal to the bulb when the vessel walls are again parallel.

The internal carotid runs vertically upward in the carotid sheath and enters the skull through the carotid canal. During this part of its course, it lies in front of the transverse processes of the upper three cervical vertebrae.

It is relatively superficial at its start, where it is contained in the carotid triangle of the neck, and lies behind and medial to the external carotid, overlapped by the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and covered by the deep fascia, the platysma, and integument: it then passes beneath the parotid gland, being crossed by the hypoglossal nerve, the digastric muscle and the stylohyoid muscle, the occipital artery and the posterior auricular artery. Higher up, it is separated from the external carotid by the styloglossus and stylopharyngeus muscles, the tip of the styloid process and the stylohyoid ligament, the glossopharyngeal nerve and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve. It is in relation, behind, with the longus capitis, the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk, and the superior laryngeal nerve; laterally, with the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve, the nerve lying on a plane posterior to the artery; medially, with the pharynx, superior laryngeal nerve, and ascending pharyngeal artery. At the base of the skull the glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory, and hypoglossal nerves lie between the artery and the internal jugular vein.

Unlike the external carotid artery, the internal carotid normally has no branches in the neck.

===C2: Petrous segment===
The petrous segment, or C2, of the internal carotid, is that which is inside the petrous part of the temporal bone. This segment extends until the foramen lacerum. 

The petrous portion classically has three sections: 

* an ascending, or vertical, portion; 
* the genu, or bend; and 
* the horizontal portion.

When the internal carotid artery enters the canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, it first ascends a short distance and then curves anteriorly and medially. The artery lies at first in front of the cochlea and tympanic cavity; from the latter cavity it is separated by a thin, bony lamella, which is cribriform in the young subject, and often partly absorbed in old age. Farther forward, it is separated from the trigeminal ganglion by a thin plate of bone, which forms the floor of the fossa for the ganglion and the roof of the horizontal portion of the canal. Frequently this bony plate is more or less deficient, and then the ganglion is separated from the artery by fibrous membrane. The artery is separated from the bony wall of the carotid canal by a prolongation of dura mater and is surrounded by a number of small veins and by filaments of the carotid plexus, derived from the ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk.

The named branches of the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery are:
*the vidian artery or artery of the pterygoid canal
*the caroticotympanic artery

===C3: Lacerum segment===
The lacerum segment, or C3, is a short segment that begins above the foramen lacerum and ends at the petrolingual ligament, a reflection of periosteum between the lingula and petrous apex (or petrosal process) of the sphenoid bone. The lacerum portion is still considered &quot;extradural&quot; since it is surrounded by periosteum and fibrocartilage along its course. It is erroneously stated in several anatomy textbooks that the internal carotid artery passes through the foramen lacerum. This at best has only ever been a partial truth in that it passes through the superior part of the foramen on its way to the cavernous sinus. As such it does not traverse the skull through it. The inferior part of the foramen is actually filled with fibrocartilage. The broad consensus is that the internal carotid artery should not be described as travelling through the foramen lacerum.

===C4: Cavernous segment===

The cavernous segment, or C4, of the internal carotid artery begins at the petrolingual ligament and extends to the proximal dural ring, which is formed by the medial and inferior periosteum of the anterior clinoid process. The cavernous segment is surrounded by the cavernous sinus.

In this part of its course, the artery is situated between the layers of the dura mater forming the cavernous sinus, but covered by the lining membrane of the sinus. It at first ascends toward the posterior clinoid process, then passes forward by the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, again curves upward on the medial side of the anterior clinoid process, and perforates the dura mater forming the roof of the sinus. The curve in the cavernous segment is called the carotid siphon. This portion of the artery is surrounded by filaments of the sympathetic trunk, and on its lateral side is the abducent nerve, or cranial nerve VI.

The named branches of the cavernous segment are:
* the meningohypophyseal artery
* the inferolateral trunk

The cavernous segment also gives rise to small capsular arteries that supply the wall of the cavernous sinus.

===C5: Clinoid segment===
The clinoid segment, or C5, is another short segment of the internal carotid that begins after the artery exits the cavernous sinus at the proximal dural ring and extends distally to the distal dural ring, after which the carotid artery is considered &quot;intra-dural&quot; and has entered the subarachnoid space.

The clinoid segment normally has no named branches, though the ophthalmic artery may arise from the clinoid segment.

===C6: Ophthalmic segment===

The ophthalmic segment, or C6, extends from the distal dural ring, which is continuous with the falx cerebri, to the origin of the posterior communicating artery. The ophthalmic segment courses roughly horizontally, parallel to the optic nerve, which runs superomedially to the carotid at this point.

The named branches of the ophthalmic segment are:
*the ophthalmic artery
*the superior hypophyseal artery

===C7: Communicating segment===
The communicating segment, or terminal segment, or C7, of the internal carotid artery passes between the optic and oculomotor nerves to the anterior perforated substance at the medial extremity of the lateral cerebral fissure. Angiographically, this segment extends from the origin of the posterior communicating artery to the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery.

The named branches of the communicating segment are:
*the posterior communicating artery
*the anterior choroidal artery

The internal carotid then divides to form the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery. The circle of Willis provides a collateral pathway for blood supply to the brain.

==Branches==

The following are the branches of the internal carotid artery, listed by segment:
* C1: Branches from the cervical portion - none
* C2: Branches from the petrous portion
** Caroticotympanic arteries
** Artery of pterygoid canal (vidian artery)
* C3: Branches from the lacerum portion - none
* C4: Branches from the cavernous portion
**Branches of the meningohypophyseal trunk:
*** Tentorial basal branch
*** Tentorial marginal branch
*** Meningeal branch - helps supply blood to the meninges of the anterior cranial fossa 
*** Clivus branches - tiny branches that supply the clivus
*** Inferior hypophyseal artery
** Capsular branches - supplies wall of cavernous sinus
** Branches of the inferolateral trunk:
*** Branches to trigeminal ganglion - provide blood to trigeminal ganglion
*** Artery of the foramen rotundum
*** Branches to nerves
* C5: Branches from the clinoid portion - none
* C6: Branches from the ophthalmic portion
** Ophthalmic artery
** Superior hypophyseal artery
* C7: Branches from the communicating portion
** Posterior communicating artery
** Anterior choroidal artery
** Anterior cerebral artery (a terminal branch)
** Middle cerebral artery (a terminal branch)

==Carotid plexus==

The sympathetic trunk forms a plexus of nerves around the artery known as the carotid plexus. The internal carotid nerve arises from the superior cervical ganglion, and forms this plexus, which follows the internal carotid into the skull.

== Diagnostics ==
The state and health of internal carotid arteries is usually evaluated using doppler ultrasound, CT angiogram or phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI).

Typically internal carotid artery blood flow velocities are measured in peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) and according to Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound in healthy subjects without stenosis must be below 125 cm/sec at PSV and below 40 cm/sec at EDV.

One study found that for normative males in the 20-39 age group, PSV averaged 82 cm/sec and EDV 34 cm/sec. In the male 80+ age group, PSV averaged 76 cm/sec and EDV 18 cm/sec.

<doc id="519012" wikidata="Q3546513" url="?curid=519012" title="Télé-Québec">
<text>The &#x27; (; ), branded as &#x27; () (formerly known as ), is a Canadian French-language public educational television network in the province of Quebec. It is a provincial Crown corporation owned by the Government of Quebec. The network&#x27;s main studios and headquarters are located at the corner of de Lorimier Street and East René Lévesque Boulevard in Montreal.

Télé-Québec is equivalent to Ontario&#x27;s TVOntario and their French counterpart TFO, and British Columbia&#x27;s Knowledge Network, and similar to the American Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and its affiliated state networks, in that it is somewhat modest in scope, runs mostly educational or cultural programming and does not try to compete with privately owned television networks or with the Ici Radio-Canada Télé network owned and operated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. However, unlike TFO and the anglophone educational networks, it runs commercials during its programming.

All programming on Télé-Québec is in French, although a few shows and movies are presented in the original language (predominantly English), with French subtitles.

Télé-Québec operates local offices in Val-d&#x27;Or, Trois-Rivières, Rimouski, Gatineau, Sept-Îles, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay and Carleton-sur-Mer.

Télé-Québec is one of the partners in the TV5 Québec Canada and TV5Monde consortiums. It also had a 25% stake in the French-Canadian arts specialty channel, , which it sold to the CBC in 2010.

==History==

On April 20, 1945, the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, under the mandate of Premier Maurice Duplessis, passed a law allowing Quebec to create and run a public broadcasting network, as a provincial counterpart to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

However, it never got beyond the planning stages until February 22, 1968, when the Daniel Johnson Sr. administration created a new public broadcasting agency, &quot;Radio-Québec&quot;, under the auspices of the Ministry of Education. Shortly afterward, the first Radio-Québec program, a radio program on the history of Canada called , was produced. Produced later that year was its first television program, , where space aliens taught kids how to pronounce French words and phrases properly.

In 1969, a new law was passed by the National Assembly of Quebec, creating (&quot;Quebec Office of Radio and Television Broadcasting&quot;), where Radio-Québec was placed.

Radio-Québec began broadcasting on its own on September 1, 1972, as a cable channel, which broadcast evenings on community channels in Montreal and Quebec City, then expanded in 1973 to Hull, Gatineau and Sherbrooke. As a cable network, Radio-Québec was generally on the air weeknights from 8 pm to 10 pm. The network of over-the-air transmitters was launched on January 19, 1975, with the sign-ons of CIVM-TV in Montreal and CIVQ-TV in Quebec City, making its programming available to an even wider audience. In its early days after the terrestrial network began, Radio-Québec would provide week-delay videotapes of its programming line-up to cable systems in communities not served by a Radio-Québec station. Some Radio-Québec programs were also seen on most Radio-Canada stations, not only in Quebec but throughout Canada as well; this arrangement continued into the 1980s.

In 1977, Radio-Québec opened its third station, CIVO-TV in Hull, serving the greater Ottawa area—the station was built after acquiring the facilities of a failed TVA affiliate, CFVO-TV. That same year, premiered.

Radio-Québec was off the air during most of 1978, due to a lockout of its employees in a labour dispute.

In 1979, Radio-Québec&#x27;s agency was restructured as a provincial crown corporation, (&quot;Quebec Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation&quot;). The network had also adopted the slogan, (&quot;The other television&quot;). From about 1980 to 1985, the Radio-Québec theme song that played when the station concluded its broadcast day was sung nightly by pop singer Veronique Beliveau who was also at the time the official face on television for the Simpsons department store chain in Quebec.

On January 1, 1985, Radio-Québec began providing its programming to its stations and cable systems via satellite, using Anik C-3. Also that year, the CRTC permitted Radio-Québec to show commercials during some of its programming, initially for a two-year trial run. This authorization became permanent—by the 2002–03 fiscal year, Télé-Québec&#x27;s revenues from advertising would account for 45.8% of its total revenue.

In 1994, the Quebec government announced budget cuts for Radio-Québec, in which its budget was reduced by $10 million. In 1995, Radio-Québec president Jean Fortier announced that the network was virtually bankrupt. As a result, over 150 staffers were laid off (out of over 750 people employed), with plans for further layoffs to trim the employee count to 300 staffers. Programming produced in-house would either be cancelled or transferred to independent companies. In addition, the network would adopt the &quot;Télé-Québec&quot; name the following year, in 1996, with the crown corporation renamed as . A proposal for the new Télé-Québec to carry strictly educational programming was never carried out. Instead, it retained its mixed educational-entertainment schedule.

The monetary shortfall was short-lived, as by 1997, Télé-Québec resumed productions on its own and increased its amount of original programming.

Since August 17, 2018, the children&#x27;s programs have been branded as for youths and for preschoolers, each with its own website and mobile app.

==Programming==

Over 40% of Télé-Québec&#x27;s programming is children&#x27;s programming. In 2005, &quot;Ramdam&quot; was a popular show for 2- to 11-year-olds. Other children&#x27;s shows have included , &quot;Zoboomafoo&quot;, &quot;Dora l&#x27;exploratrice&quot;, &quot;Bob le bricoleur&quot;, &quot;IDragon&quot;, &quot;Les Mélodilous&quot;, , and &quot;Toupie et Binou&quot;. For 6 to 8 year-olds, shows have included , Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Rocket Power&quot;, , and . &quot;Ramdam&quot; and &quot;Banzaï&quot; are both aimed at pre-teens (9 to 12) and &quot;ADN-X&quot; is a teen show that provides practical solutions to everyday problems.

Télé-Québec&#x27;s cultural programming reflects Quebec&#x27;s diverse cultural expression in fiction, songs, music, cinema, visual art, and drama. Télé-Québec shows such as , and help to promote Quebec artists and creators and their works. is a music show that invited 160 performers or groups in 2005–2006, who performed 230 songs by Quebec songwriters or composers. is a book show that covers books of all genres and for all audiences; in 2005–2006, 260 books were presented, 124 of which were by Quebec authors. is a magazine show on cultural activities taking place all over Quebec.

A new weekly cultural magazine-style show, , deals with a range of different creative arts, including dance, cinema, literature, sculpture, painting, television, music, and theatre. As well, a new series of &quot;living portraits&quot; will profile notable living creators such as authors, filmmakers, architects, and thinkers.

Télé-Québec presents a range of films, including &quot;auteur&quot; films by notable directors, feature-length documentaries, premiere showings, and Quebec films. All films are shown without commercial interruptions, compared to most French-language TV channels in Canada. During the last five years, Télé-Québec showed over 959 hours of documentaries, which made up 18% of its programming. Documentary topics included socio-political, cultural, historical, scientific, and travel. Between 2000 and 2006, 137 documentaries and 39 series were produced.

Télé-Québec also hosts debate and discussion-oriented shows that allow for an exchange of ideas and perspectives on social and political issues. is a show on international political issues. is a pan-Quebec magazine show on social, political, and economic issues. is a debate show.

As a community service, Télé-Québec has several shows that present a regional perspective, such as , , , , , and . Télé-Québec also has an Internet strategy, as part of its educational and cultural mission. In 2003, the extremis.tv website won a Gémeaux prize for the best Internet site. In 2004, du missionarctique.tv won the same award. The website for the teen-oriented show has interactive activities including a comic strip-creating activity.

===Programming in English===
The only regular Télé-Québec shows that were entirely in English were the weekday, hour-long, instructional program &quot;Quebec School Telecasts&quot; and its successor &quot;Quebec School Television&quot;. The series &quot;Quebec School Telecasts&quot; was first telecasted on CBC Television outlets in Quebec in the early 1960s. Radio-Québec picked up the program in 1984 and aired it under that name until September 2, 1996. It was replaced on September 3, 1996, by &quot;Quebec School Television&quot; which aired on Télé-Québec until December 1999. 

In 1985, Radio-Québec and TVOntario signed an exchange arrangement, in which English-language TVO programming would be seen on Radio-Québec, and Radio-Québec&#x27;s French-language programming would be seen on TVO.

In 2018, English Language Arts Network (ELAN) filed an intervention to CRTC licence renewals for the service, seeking that Télé-Québec be required to devote 20% of its programming and budget to programs of interest to an anglophone, indigenous, and other visible minority communities of Quebec. The proposal called for at least 10% of this quota to be put towards English-language programming. The CRTC declined the request, stating that it was beyond the scope of licence renewal, and &quot;should be the subject of a policy proceeding in which broadcasters as a whole are considered&quot;.

==Télé-Québec HD and digital conversion==
On June 12, 2008, Télé-Québec launched an HD simulcast of its Montréal station CIVM-TV called &quot;&quot;. It signed on over the air on channel 27 (Virtual channel 17) from Olympic Stadium in Montreal in January 2009, making CIVM-DT the first educational television station in Canada to broadcast digitally. After the analogue shutdown and digital conversion in Canada, scheduled for August 31, 2011, CIVM-DT moved to channel 26.

A digital terrestrial television transmitter requested and authorized for construction in Quebec City for CIVQ-TV did not sign on until August 2010, weeks before the September 25, 2010, deadline to sign on or file an extension. That transmitter broadcasts from Édifice Marie-Guyart in downtown Quebec City on channel 25 (virtual channel 15). After the digital conversion in 2011, CIVQ moved its digital signal to channel 15.

Télé-Québec intended to convert all of its transmitters to digital by the digital transition deadline of August 31, 2011, including its transmitters that are not required to transition by this deadline.

==Stations==
Télé-Québec&#x27;s network consists of 12 stations and five repeaters, originating at CIVM-DT in Montreal.


It can also be seen nationwide on Bell Satellite TV channel 138 and Shaw Direct channel 722. On terrestrial cable, however, it is generally seen only in Quebec and in communities in Ontario and New Brunswick which are within the broadcast range of a Télé-Québec transmitter. Outside of this area, few cable systems, such as MTS in Winnipeg, carry Télé-Québec in their digital tiers.

Télé-Québec (and its predecessor, Radio-Québec) was also assigned channel 2 in Rivière-du-Loup, channel 10 in Lithium Mines, and channel 21 in Mont-Laurier. As of 2009, service has yet to begin in these communities; in addition, it later lost its channel 2 slot at Rivière-du-Loup, after that channel was reallocated to Quebec City (CFAP-TV) and Rimouski (CJBR-TV). It is also unknown if the Lithium Mines transmitter was replaced by, or provided secondary service of, CIVA-TV, the Télé-Québec outlet serving nearby Val-d&#x27;Or.

<text>Renée Lynn Fleming (born February 14, 1959) is an American soprano and actress, known for performances in opera, concerts, recordings, theater, film, and at major public occasions. A recipient of the National Medal of Arts, Fleming has been nominated for 18 Grammy Awards and has won five times. In December 2023, she was one of five recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors. Other notable honors have included the Crystal Award from the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur from the French government, Germany&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit, Sweden&#x27;s Polar Music Prize and honorary membership in England&#x27;s Royal Academy of Music. Unusual among artists whose careers began in opera, Fleming has achieved name recognition beyond the classical music world. 

Fleming has a full lyric soprano voice. She has performed coloratura, lyric, and lighter spinto soprano operatic roles in Italian, German, French, Czech, and Russian, aside from her native English. A significant portion of her career has been the performance of new music, including world premieres of operas, concert pieces, and songs composed for her by André Previn, Caroline Shaw, Kevin Puts, Anders Hillborg, Nico Muhly, Henri Dutilleux, Brad Mehldau, and Wayne Shorter. In 2008, Fleming became the first woman in the 125-year history of the Metropolitan Opera (the Met) to solo headline a season opening night gala. Conductor Sir Georg Solti said of Fleming: &quot;In my long life, I have met maybe two sopranos with this quality of singing.&quot;

Beyond opera, Fleming has sung and recorded lieder, chansons, jazz, musical theatre, and indie rock, and she has performed with a wide range of artists, including Luciano Pavarotti, Lou Reed, Wynton Marsalis, Paul Simon, Andrea Bocelli, Sting and John Prine. A 2018 Tony Award nominee, Fleming has acted on Broadway and in theatrical productions in London, Los Angeles and Chicago. Fleming has also recorded songs for the soundtracks of several major films, two of which won the Academy Award for Best Picture (&quot;The Shape of Water&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;). Fleming has made numerous television appearances, and she is the only classical singer to have performed the US National Anthem at the Super Bowl.

Fleming has also become a frequent public speaker about the impact of music on health and neuroscience, winning a Research!America award for Impact on Public Opinion. In May 2023, Fleming was appointed by the World Health Organization as a Goodwill Ambassador for Arts and Health. In April 2024, Penguin Random House published Fleming&#x27;s anthology &quot;Music and Mind: Harnessing the Arts for Health and Wellness&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Fleming was born on February 14, 1959, in Indiana, Pennsylvania, the daughter of two music teachers. She has great-grandparents who were born in Prague and later emigrated to the US. She grew up in Churchville, New York and attended Churchville-Chili High School.

She studied with Patricia Misslin at the Crane School of Music at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Potsdam, and graduated with a Bachelor of Music Education in 1981. While at SUNY Potsdam, Fleming took up singing with a jazz trio at Alger&#x27;s, an off-campus bar. The jazz saxophonist Illinois Jacquet invited her on tour with his big band, but she chose instead to continue with graduate studies with voice teacher John Maloy at the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester, from which she received a Master of Music in 1983.

As a student, Fleming spent several summers at the Aspen Music Festival and School (AMFS), where she studied with Jan DeGaetani and was directed by Edward Berkeley. She appeared in the role of Anne Sexton in Conrad Susa&#x27;s &quot;Transformations&quot; (1983); gave her first performance as Countess Almaviva in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (1984), the role in which she later made most of her major opera house debuts; and sang the role of Anne in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1987). She also performed scenes from &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, and the Marschallin in that opera became one of her calling-card roles at opera houses around the globe.

She won a Fulbright Scholarship in 1985, which enabled her to work in Europe with Arleen Augér and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Fleming then sang at jazz clubs to pay for further studies at the Juilliard School. While at Juilliard, she sang in roles with the Juilliard Opera Center, appearing as Musetta in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; and the Wife in Menotti&#x27;s &quot;Tamu-Tamu&quot;, among others. Her voice teacher at Juilliard was Beverley Peck Johnson. She graduated Juilliard with an Artist Diploma in 1986.

==Career==

===1980s===
Fleming began performing professionally in smaller concerts and with small opera companies while still a graduate student at Juilliard. She sang frequently in the &quot;Musica Viva&quot; concert series sponsored by the New York Unitarian Church of All Souls during the 1980s. In 1984 she sang nine songs by Hugo Wolf in the world premiere of Eliot Feld&#x27;s ballet &quot;Adieu&quot;, which she again performed in 1987 and 1989 at the Joyce Theater. In 1986 she sang her first major operatic role, Konstanze in &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, at the State Theatre in Salzburg, Austria. Two years later she portrayed Thalie, Clarine and La Folie in Jean-Philippe Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Platée&quot; with the Piccolo Teatro dell&#x27;Opera in New York.

Her major break came in 1988 when she won the Met Auditions at age 29. That same year she sang the Countess in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; in her debut with Houston Grand Opera. She reprised the role the following year in her debut at the Spoleto Festival in Italy. Also in 1989, Fleming made her debut with the New York City Opera as Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot; under conductor Chris Nance and her debut with The Royal Opera, London, as Dircé in Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Médée&quot;. She also was awarded a Richard Tucker Career Grant and won the George London Competition.

===1990s===
In 1990 she was once again honored by the Richard Tucker Music Foundation but this time with the highly coveted Richard Tucker Award. That same year she made her debut with Seattle Opera in her first portrayal of the title role in &quot;Rusalka&quot;, a role that she has since recorded and reprised at many of the world&#x27;s great opera houses. She also sang for the 50th anniversary of the American Ballet Theatre in their production of Eliot Feld&#x27;s &quot;Les Noces&quot; and returned to the New York City Opera to sing both the Countess in &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; and Micaëla in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;. She sang the title role in the US premiere presentation of Donizetti&#x27;s 1841 opera &quot;Maria Padilla&quot; with Opera Omaha. In addition, she sang the title role in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; with the Opera Orchestra of New York.

Fleming&#x27;s first television appearance came in January 1991, singing the Cherry Duet from Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot; with Luciano Pavarotti on Live from Lincoln Center. Fleming made her Met and San Francisco Opera debut portraying Countess Almaviva in &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; in 1991. She was originally not scheduled to make her Met debut until the following season, but stepped in to replace Felicity Lott who had become ill. She returned to the Met later that year to sing Rosina in the world premiere of John Corigliano&#x27;s &quot;The Ghosts of Versailles&quot;. Continuing her progress, she made her Carnegie Hall debut performing music by Ravel with the New York City Opera Orchestra, sang &quot;Rusalka&quot; with Houston Grand Opera, and made her debut at the Tanglewood Music Festival as Ilia in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot; with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

1992 saw Fleming making her debut with Grand Théâtre de Genève in Switzerland as Fiordiligi in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, and she sang the role of Anna in Boieldieu&#x27;s &quot;La dame blanche&quot; at Carnegie Hall with the Opera Orchestra of New York and the role of Fortuna in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Il sogno di Scipione&quot; at Alice Tully Hall, as part of Lincoln Center&#x27;s &quot;Festival of Mozart Operas in Concert&quot;.

Fleming sang the role of Alaide in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;La straniera&quot; in a concert performance by the Opera Orchestra of New York; made her debut at the Rossini Opera Festival in Italy in the title role of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Armida&quot;; and debuted with the Lyric Opera of Chicago in the title role of Carlisle Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Susannah&quot;.

She also gave her New York City solo recital debut at Alice Tully Hall to great acclaim, sang her first Pamina in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; at the Met, and performed Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Three Excerpts from &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and the &quot;&quot;Lulu&quot; Suite&quot; with the Met Orchestra under James Levine.

The same season saw her singing in the world premiere of Joan Tower&#x27;s &quot;Fanfare&quot; with Pinchas Zukerman and the Aspen Chamber Symphony and in the world premiere of John Kander&#x27;s &quot;Letter From Sullivan Ballou&quot; at the Richard Tucker Awards ceremony.

In June 1993, Fleming performed recital pieces at the funeral of the American soprano Arleen Auger at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel in New York City.

During the 1993/1994 season, Fleming sang her first Desdemona in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; and her first Ellen Orford in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, both with the Met. During the following summer, she made her debut at the Glyndebourne Festival in England as the Countess in &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;. In addition, she performed the role of Madame de Tourvel in the world premiere of Conrad Susa&#x27;s &quot;The Dangerous Liaisons&quot;. The 1994/1995 San Francisco Opera&#x27;s season included her Salome in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Hérodiade&quot;.

In 1995 Fleming portrayed the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; with Houston Grand Opera; sang in Salomé in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Hérodiade&quot; with the Opera Orchestra of New York at Carnegie Hall; and sang Rusalka with the San Francisco Opera. Fiordiligi in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; with Solti at Royal Festival Hall in London followed, as did a lauded recital at the Morgan Library.

A highlight of 1996 was her signing of an exclusive recording contract with the London/Decca label, making her the first American singer in 31 years to do so, the last having been Marilyn Horne.

The title role in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Armida&quot; at the Pesaro Festival in Italy also came in 1996. Fiordiligi in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; at the Met followed, as did the soprano solo in the Verdi Requiem with Luciano Pavarotti and the Met Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. Her debut in the role of Marguerite in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; came with Chicago Lyric Opera, and she sang the role of Donna Anna in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; with the Paris Opera at the reopening of the Palais Garnier with Sir Georg Solti.

Solti chose Fleming to be the first recipient of his &quot;Solti Prize&quot;, an award given to an outstanding younger singer, and given by the &quot;Académie du disque lyrique&quot; in a ceremony equivalent to the Grammy Awards. That year, Fleming debuted at the Bayreuth Festival in Germany as Eva in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Meistersinger&quot;. Her other performances included recitals at the Edinburgh International Festival in Scotland and at Alice Tully Hall.

Her first &quot;Manon&quot; at the Opéra Bastille in France received glowing reviews in 1997. At the Bastille, she also reprised the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; as well as singing Marguerite in &quot;Faust&quot; and Rusalka at the Met.

Two concert performances occurred: first with the New York Philharmonic, first under Zubin Mehta performing a selection of opera arias; the second singing Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Exsultate, jubilate&quot; and three songs of Richard Strauss with Kurt Masur. She appeared at the Ravinia Festival with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and performed Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;&quot; with the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s under André Previn. She gave recitals as well at notable venues such as the Salzburg Festival in Austria.

Two title roles were offered to Fleming in 1998: Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Arabella&quot; with Houston Grand Opera and Carlisle Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Susannah&quot;. Also, there was Countess Almaviva in a landmark production of &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; at the Met which also starred Cecilia Bartoli, Susanne Mentzer, Dwayne Croft, Danielle de Niese, and Bryn Terfel and which was broadcast on PBS&#x27; &quot;Great Performances&quot;. She made her Carnegie Hall recital debut and sang Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Four Last Songs&quot; with Claudio Abbado and the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra at the Salzburg Festival. and later with the Berlin Philharmonic.

She originated the roles of Blanche DuBois in the world première of André Previn&#x27;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; with the San Francisco Opera in September 1998.

1999 brought appearances at the Bavarian State Opera in Germany as the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and she returned to Carnegie Hall to great success with a concert of German lieder. She also performed in recital with André Previn and made her debut at the Schleswig-Holstein Festival in Germany. Fleming&#x27;s CD, &quot;The Beautiful Voice&quot;, won her a Grammy Award that year.

Performances of two new title roles were given: Handel&#x27;s &quot;Alcina&quot; with Les Arts Florissants and conductor William Christie and with the Lyric Opera of Chicago and Charpentier&#x27;s &quot;Louise&quot; with San Francisco Opera. Fleming closed out the year by performing for President Bill Clinton at the White House for a Christmas celebration.

===2000s===

In 2000, Fleming appeared at the Met, San Francisco Opera and at Covent Garden in England as the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and sang the title role in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; with the Opera Orchestra of New York.

She appeared as Donna Anna in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at the Salzburg Festival and at the Met. She performed with the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s, under Mark Elder as part of the PBS series &quot;Live From Lincoln Center&quot; and with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Creation&quot; under James Levine. In June of that year she sang at the installation of New York Archbishop Edward Egan.

As Desdemona in &quot;Otello&quot; she opened the 2001/02 Lyric Opera of Chicago season, Manon with the Paris Opera, the Marschallin with both the San Francisco Opera and the Met, and Arabella at both the Bavarian State Opera in Germany and the Met. She also sang in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; twice, once with the London Symphony Orchestra and once with the New York Philharmonic. Fleming also sang at World Trade Center site shortly after the September 11 attacks.

Taking a rather different approach, in 2002 Fleming provided the vocals for Howard Shore&#x27;s soundtrack for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; soundtrack. Her singing can be found in the songs &quot;The End of All Things&quot;, &quot;Twilight and Shadow&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (Original Soundtrack) and &quot;The Grace Of Undómiel&quot;, &quot;Mount Doom&quot;, &quot;The Eagles&quot; and &quot;The Fellowship Reunited&quot; (The Complete Recordings). She also sang in several concerts in the United Kingdom with Bryn Terfel and gave the most extensive recital tour of her career, singing in dozens of recitals with pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet throughout the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. In addition, she portrayed the role of Rusalka with Opéra Bastille and Imogene in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Il pirata&quot; with Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris.

Met performances continued in 2004, with Fleming portraying &quot;Rodelinda&quot; in Handel&#x27;s opera and reprises of Rusalka and Violetta at the Met.

In a 2010 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article, Fleming talked about her view of the battle between opera traditionalists and those who want to reinterpret the standards, siding – with some reservations – with the latter: &quot;I&#x27;m not a reactionary. I&#x27;ve loved some of [these productions] when they&#x27;ve been well thought out. I have no problem with edgy, as long as it&#x27;s not vulgar or disrespectful of the piece.&quot; She said her &quot;classic&quot; image meant that she was unlikely to be asked to perform in such productions. In the same interview, Fleming explained her increasing preference for performing in concerts, rather than opera productions, and said, having learned more than 50 operas, that she is unlikely to learn many more.

At the Last Night of the Proms in London in 2010, Fleming performed songs by Richard Strauss, Dvořák and Smetana. In December, the Board of Directors of Lyric Opera of Chicago announced that Fleming was named Creative Consultant, a first in the company&#x27;s history.

The performance received a five-minute ovation. In the Spring of 2014, Fleming performed the role of Blanche Dubois in André Previn&#x27;s operatic adaptation of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; at Carnegie Hall in New York and later in Chicago and Los Angeles. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; theater critic Charles McNulty described Fleming as &quot;that rare opera star whose expressive vocal potential is nearly matched by a gestural eloquence&quot;, and wrote:

Renée Fleming&#x27;s magnificent Blanche dominates the stage in every scene that she&#x27;s in. The tragedy belongs to her character – and it&#x27;s personal, achingly so. Fleming is quite simply the best Blanche I&#x27;ve seen since Elizabeth Marvel brutally essayed the role in Ivo van Hove&#x27;s brilliant deconstruction at New York Theatre Workshop in 1999.
In January 2015, Fleming co-starred with Kelli O&#x27;Hara in a new production of the operetta &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; at the Met in New York. The production was directed by Susan Stroman, the winner of five Tony Awards.

[Fleming&#x27;s] creamy, disembodied voice floats through the air like thought made sound...Mr. Whishaw and Ms. Fleming are, against the odds, marvelous. They somehow lend an emotional spontaneity to ritualistic words and gestures, while conjuring an affecting relationship.
On July 24, 2019, Fleming performed the world premiere of &quot;Penelope&quot;, a collaboration between Tom Stoppard and André Previn, with the Emerson String Quartet and pianist Simone Dinnerstein. Fleming was joined by actress Uma Thurman, who provided narration for the spoken text.

In his review of the musical for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Rupert Christiansen wrote &quot;[The] first London staging is lucky to have netted Renée Fleming for the central role of Margaret ... Fleming makes the transition to Broadway style effortlessly, using her gorgeously rich middle register ... and handling the spoken dialogue with wit and assurance.&quot; Fleming performed the same role when the production was staged in Los Angeles and Chicago later in 2019.

In 2019, Fleming also premiered the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Kevin Puts&#x27; &quot;The Brightness of Light&quot;, a setting of letters between Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz. Fleming performed the work in concert at Tanglewood, Santa Fe, Aspen and the Kennedy Center.

<text>The Nezamiyeh () or Nizamiyyah () are a group of institutions of higher education established by Khwaja Nizam al-Mulk in the eleventh century in Iran. The name &quot;nizamiyyah&quot; derives from his name. Founded at the beginning of the Seljuk Empire, these Sunni Islam theological schools are considered to be the model of later Islamic universities, or schools.

Nizamiyyah institutes were among the first well organized institutions of higher learning in the Muslim world. The quality of education was among the highest in the Islamic world, and they were even renowned in Europe. They were supported financially, politically, and spiritually by the royal establishment and the elite class. Some scholars have suggested that the establishment of the Nizamiyya madrasas was in fact an attempt to thwart the growing influence of another group of Muslims, the Ismailis, in the region. Indeed, Nizam al-Mulk devoted a significant section in his famous &quot;Siyasatnama (Books of Politics)&quot; to refuting the Ismaili doctrines.

The most famous and celebrated of all the nizamiyyah schools was Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad (established 1065), where Nizam al-Mulk appointed the distinguished philosopher and theologian, al-Ghazali, as a professor. Persian poet Sa&#x27;di was a student of the Baghdad Nizamiyyah. Other nizamiyyah schools were located in Nishapur, Amol, Balkh, Herat and Isfahan.

Nizam ul-Mulk was finally assassinated en route from Isfahan to Baghdad in 1092 CE. According to several books, he was assassinated by a Nizari Ismaili (an Assassin).

According to Mughatil ibn Bakri, a staff member of the Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad, he alleges that Nizam al-Mulk converted to Shia Islam after a Sunni-Shia debate held on the orders of Sultan Malik Shah I, who also converted to Shia&#x27;ism. But it is thereafter that they were both assassinated.

The curriculum initially focused on religious studies, Islamic law, Arabic literature, and arithmetic, and later extended to history, mathematics, the physical sciences, and music.

<text>Cruft is a jargon word for anything that is left over, redundant and getting in the way. It is used particularly for defective, superseded, useless, superfluous, or dysfunctional elements in computer software.

==History==
Around 1958, the term was used in the sense of &quot;garbage&quot; by students frequenting the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In the 1959 edition of the club&#x27;s dictionary, it was defined as &quot;that which magically amounds in the Clubroom just before you walk in to clean up. In other words, rubbage&quot;. Its author Peter Samson later explained that this was meant in the sense of &quot;detritus, that which needs to be swept up and thrown out. The dictionary has no definition for &#x27;crufty,&#x27; a word I didn&#x27;t hear until some years later&quot;. In 2008 it was also used to refer to alumni who remain socially active at MIT.

The origin of the term is uncertain, but it may be derived from Harvard University&#x27;s Cruft Laboratory. Built in 1915 as a gift from a donor named Harriet Otis Cruft, it housed the Harvard Physics Department&#x27;s radar lab during World War II.

==Software==
The FreeBSD handbook uses the term to refer to leftover or superseded object code that accumulates in a folder or directory when software is recompiled and new executables and data files are produced. Such cruft, if required for the new executables to work properly, can cause the BSD equivalent of dependency hell. The word is also used to describe instances of unnecessary, leftover or just poorly written source code in a computer program that is then uselessly, or even harmfully, compiled into object code.

Cruft accumulation may result in technical debt, which can subsequently make adding new features or modifying existing features—even to improve performance—more difficult and time-consuming.

In the context of Internet or Web addresses (Uniform Resource Locators or &quot;URLs&quot;), cruft refers to the characters that are relevant or meaningful only to the people who created the site, such as implementation details of the computer system which serves the page. Examples of URL cruft could include filename extensions such as &quot;.php&quot; or &quot;.html&quot;, and internal organizational details such as &quot;/public/&quot; or &quot;/Users/john/work/drafts/&quot;.

==Computer hardware==
Cruft may also refer to unused and out-of-date computer paraphernalia, collected through upgrading, inheritance, or simple acquisition, both deliberate and through circumstance. This accumulated hardware, however, often has benefit when IT systems administrators, technicians, and the like have need for critical replacement parts. An unused machine or component similar to a production unit could allow near-immediate restoration of the failed unit, as opposed to waiting for a shipped replacement.

<doc id="519047" wikidata="Q1394961" url="?curid=519047" title="IWA–AIT">
<text>The International Workers&#x27; Association – (IWA–AIT) is an international federation of anarcho-syndicalist labor unions and initiatives.

It aims to create unions capable of fighting for the economic and political interests of the working class and eventually, to directly abolish capitalism and the state through &quot;the establishment of economic communities and administrative organs run by the workers.&quot;

At its peak the International represented millions of people worldwide. Its member unions played a central role in the social conflicts of the 1920s and 1930s. However the International was formed as many countries were entering periods of extreme repression, and many of the largest IWA unions were shattered during that period.

== Ideology ==
The IWA explicitly rejects centralism, political parties, parliamentarism and statism, including the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat, as offering the means to carry out such change, drawing heavily on anarchist critiques written both before and after the Russian revolution, most famously Mikhail Bakunin&#x27;s suggestion that: &quot;If you took the most ardent revolutionary, vested him in absolute power, within a year he would be worse than the Tsar himself.&quot;

Instead emphasis is placed on the organization of workers as the agents of social change through their ability to take direct action:

===Policies===

From an early stage, the IWA has taken an anti-militarist stance, reflecting the overwhelming anarchist attitude since the First World War that the working class should not engage with the power struggles between ruling classes - and certainly should not die for them. It included a commitment to anti-militarism in its core principles and in 1926 it founded an International Anti-Militarist Coalition to promote disarmament and gather information on war production.

The IWA also states that syndicalists recognize violence as an acceptable defense against violence of the ruling classes, to be occur through the formation of a democratic popular militia rather than through a traditional military hierarchy. This has been posited as an alternative to the dictatorship of the proletariat model.

== History ==
=== First International and revolutionary syndicalism (1864–1917) ===

The First International (International Workingmen&#x27;s Association; IWMA) aimed at uniting a variety of different left-wing socialist, communist and anarchist political groups and Labor union that were based on the working class and class struggle.

This split prompted several attempts to start specifically anarchist Internationals, notably the Anarchist St. Imier International (1872-1881) and the Black International (1881–87). However heavy repression in France of the Paris Commune, as well as in Spain and Italy, alongside the rise of propaganda of the deed within the anarchist movement and a dominant strand of social-democracy on the wider left wing in Europe, meant that serious moves to establish an anarcho-syndicalist international would not begin until the early 20th century.

After the end of the war however, with the workers&#x27; movement resurgent following the October Revolution and subsequent Russian Civil War, what was to become the modern IWA was formed, billing itself as the &quot;true heir&quot; of the original international.

=== Rejection of Bolshevism and founding of the IWA (1918–1922) ===
The success of the Bolsheviks in Russia in 1918 resulted in a wave of syndicalist successes worldwide, including the struggle of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in the USA alongside the creation of mass anarchist unions across Latin America and huge syndicalist-led strikes in Germany, Portugal, Spain, Italy and France, where it was noted that &quot;neutral (economic, but not political) syndicalism had been swept away.&quot;

For many in this new revolutionary wave, Russia seemed to offer a successful alternative to social democratic reformism, so when in 1919 the Bolshevik Party issued an appeal for all workers to join it in building a new Red International it was met with great interest. Almost all of the syndicalist unions attended the 1920 congress of the Bolsheviks’ international of communists, the Comintern, which unions in France and Italy joined immediately. In contrast, attempts to organize a conference of anarchists in February 1919 in Copenhagen had seen only the Scandinavians able to attend.

The final formation of this new international, then known as the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association, took place at an illegal conference in Berlin in December 1922, marking an irrevocable break between the international syndicalist movement and the Bolsheviks.

Signatories to the founding statement of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association included groups from around the world. The single largest anarcho-syndicalist union at the time, the CNT in Spain, was unable to attend when their delegates were arrested on the way to the conference, though they did join the following year, bringing 600,000 members into the international. Despite the CNT&#x27;s absence, the international represented well over 1 million workers at its inauguration:

* The Italian Syndicalist Union (USI): 500,000 members
* The Regional Federation of Argentine Workers (FORA): 200,000
* The General Confederation of Labour (CGT) in Portugal: 150,000
* The Free Workers&#x27; Union of Germany (FAUD): 120,000
* The Committee for the Defense of Syndicalism (CDS) in France: 100,000
* The Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden (SAC): 32,000
* The General Confederation of Workers (CGT) in Mexico: 30,000
* The National Labor Secretariat (NAS) in the Netherlands: 22,500
* The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in Chile: 20,000
* The Norwegian Syndicalist Federation (NSF) in Norway: 20,000
* The Union for Syndicalist Propaganda in Denmark: 600

The biggest syndicalist union in the US, the IWW, considered joining but eventually ruled out affiliation in 1936, citing the IWA&#x27;s policies on religious and political affiliation.

===Decline and repression (1923–1939)===

In Argentina, the FORA had already begun a process of decline by the time it joined the IWA, having split in 1915 into pro and anti-Bolshevik factions. From 1922, the anarchist movement there lost most of its membership, exacerbated by further splits, most notably around the Severino Di Giovanni affair. It was crushed by General Uriburu&#x27;s military coup in 1930.

Portugal&#x27;s CGT was driven underground after an unsuccessful attempt to break the newly installed President of Portugal, Gomes da Costa, with a general strike in 1927 which led to nearly 100 deaths. It survived underground with 15–20,000 members until January 1934, when it called a general revolutionary strike, which failed, against plans to replace trade unions with corporations. It was able to continue in a much reduced state until World War II, but was effectively finished as a fighting union.
Massive government repression repeated such defeats around the world, as anarcho-syndicalist unions were destroyed in Peru, Brazil, Columbia, Japan, Cuba, Bulgaria, Paraguay and Bolivia. By the end of the 1930s legal anarcho-syndicalist trade unions existed only in Chile, Bolivia, Sweden and Uruguay.

=== Later developments (1940–) ===
At the tenth congress in 1958, the SAC&#x27;s response to its pressures led it into a clash with the rest of the international. It withdrew from the IWA following its failure to amend the body&#x27;s statutes to allow it to stand in municipal elections and amid concerns over its integration with the state over distribution of unemployment benefits.

In the early 2000s, the organisation () was established in Slovakia and became the Slovak section of the IWA. It has published the journal &quot;Žerme bohatých&quot; (), which has reported on strike actions and trade union struggles in both Slovakia and the rest of the world.

By the 21st century, the IWA was experiencing an internal crisis. This process culminated in 2016, with the expulsion of the CNT (Spain), USI (Italy), FAU (Germany), which together represented 80-90% of the IWA&#x27;s working membership. In 2018, the expelled sections of the IWA established a new international organisation, the International Confederation of Labour (&quot;Confederación Internacional del Trabajo&quot;; ICL-CIT). Alongside the CNT, USI and FAU, other affiliated organisations included the North American Regional Administration of the IWW, FORA (Argentina), ESE (Greece), and IP (Poland). As of its founding, the ICL-CIT counted more than 10,000 members, located in both Europe and the Americas; in contrast, by 2020, the IWA&#x27;s membership had dwindled to less than 1,000 active members, mostly located in Europe.

<text>A devotional song is a hymn that accompanies religious observances and rituals. Traditionally devotional music has been a part of Hindu music, Jewish music, Buddhist music, Islamic music and Christian music.

Each major religion has its own tradition with devotional hymns. In Christianity, the devotional has been a part of the liturgy in Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Russian Orthodox Church, and others, since their earliest days. A devotional is a part of the prayer service proper and is not, in these contexts, ornamentation. Within the Reformed tradition, church music in general was hotly debated; some Puritans objected to all ornament and sought to abolish choirs, hymns, and, inasmuch as liturgy itself was rejected, devotionals.

In Eastern and Near-Eastern religions, devotionals can function as communion prayer and meditation. These are sung in particular rhythms which are sustained over a prolonged period to give practitioners a mystical experience. In Hindu music, the genre arising out of the Bhakti movement (devotion), it takes forms like Bhajan, Kirtan and Aarti.

==Kinds of devotional music==
*Bhajan: a Hindu or Sikh devotional.
*Kirtan
*Shyama Sangeet
*Borgeet: an Assamese devotional.
* Gunla Bajan
* Dapha music

==Sponsorship==
The company began a push towards sports: it acquired the naming rights and a management contract for the Videotron Centre, currently owns the Quebec Remparts of the QMJHL, has backed a proposed National Hockey League expansion franchise in Quebec City (which would bring the NHL back to the city for the first time since the Quebec Nordiques were relocated in 1995, and would play at the new arena), and launched a TVA-branded sports network in 2011.

On 20 July 2015, Quebecor officially submitted its application for an NHL expansion team in Quebec City. The application has since passed two phases of league scrutiny, with a final decision expected in early 2016.

==Corporate governance==
Former Prime Minister of Canada Brian Mulroney served as chair of the board before his death in February 2024.

Current members of the board of directors of Quebecor Inc. are: Françoise Bertrand, Jean La Couture, Sylvie Lalande, Pierre Laurin, A. Michel Lavigne, Geneviève Marcon, and Normand Provost.

<text>The space-cadet keyboard is a keyboard designed by John L. Kulp in 1978 and used on Lisp machines at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which inspired several still-current jargon terms in the field of computer science and influenced the design of Emacs. It was inspired by the Knight keyboard, which was developed for the Knight TV system, used with MIT&#x27;s Incompatible Timesharing System.

== Description ==
The space-cadet keyboard was equipped with seven modifier keys: four keys for bucky bits (, , , and ), and three shift keys, called , , and (which was labeled on the &quot;front&quot; of the key; the top was labeled ). had been introduced on the earlier Knight keyboard, while and were introduced by this keyboard. Each group was in a row, thus allowing easy chording, or pressing of several modifier keys; for example, could be pressed with the fingers of one hand, while the other hand pressed another key.

Many keys had three symbols on them, accessible by means of the shift keys: a letter and a symbol on the top, and a Greek letter on the front. For example, the key had a &quot;G&quot; and an up-arrow (&quot;↑&quot;) on the top, and the Greek letter gamma (&quot;&quot;) on the front. By pressing this key with one hand while playing an appropriate &quot;chord&quot; with the other hand on the shift keys, the user could get the following results:

Each of these might, in addition, be typed with any combination of the , , , and keys. By combining the modifier keys, it is possible to make This allowed the user to type very complicated mathematical text, and also to have thousands of single-character commands at their disposal. Many users were willing to memorise the command meanings of so many characters if it reduced typing time. This attitude shaped the interface of Emacs. Other users, however, thought that so many keys were excessive and objected to this design on the grounds that such a keyboard can be difficult to operate. Emacs uses &quot;M-&quot; as the prefix for when describing key presses: the &quot;M-&quot; stood for on the space-cadet keyboard, and when Emacs was ported to PCs, the key was used in place of .

This keyboard included a key which had limited application support. It also included four Roman Numeral keys (, , , and ) which allowed for easy interaction with lists of four or fewer choices.

<text>Shloka or śloka ( , from the root , ) in a broader sense, according to Monier-Williams&#x27;s dictionary, is &quot;any verse or stanza; a proverb, saying&quot;; but in particular it refers to the 32-syllable verse, derived from the Vedic &quot;anuṣṭubh&quot; metre, used in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and many other works of classical Sanskrit literature.

In its usual form it consists of four &quot;pādas&quot; or quarter-verses, of eight syllables each, or (according to an alternative analysis) of two half-verses of 16 syllables each. The metre is similar to the Vedic &quot;anuṣṭubh&quot; metre, but with stricter rules.

The &quot;śloka&quot; is the basis for Indian epic poetry, and may be considered the Indian verse form &quot;par excellence&quot;, occurring as it does far more frequently than any other metre in classical Sanskrit poetry. The &quot;śloka&quot; is the verse-form generally used in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the Puranas, Smritis, and scientific treatises of Hinduism such as &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot; and &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot;. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, for example, features many verse metres in its chapters, but 95% of the stanzas are &quot;ślokas&quot; of the &quot;anuṣṭubh&quot; type, and most of the rest are &quot;tristubh&quot;s.

The &quot;anuṣṭubh&quot; is found in Vedic texts, but its presence is minor, and &quot;triṣṭubh&quot; and &quot;gāyatrī&quot; metres dominate in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. A dominating presence of &quot;ślokas&quot; in a text is a marker that the text is likely post-Vedic.

The traditional view is that this form of verse was involuntarily composed by Vālmīki, the author of the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;, in grief on seeing a hunter shoot down one of two birds in love. On seeing the sorrow (śoka) of the widowed bird, he was reminded of the sorrow Sītā felt on being separated from Shri Rama and began composing the Ramayana in shlokas. For this he is called the Ādikavi (first poet.)

==Metrical pattern==
Each 16-syllable hemistich (half-verse), 
of two 8-syllable &quot;pādas&quot;, can take either a &quot;pathyā&quot; (&quot;normal&quot;) form or one of several &quot;vipulā&quot; (&quot;extended&quot;) forms. The form of the second foot of the first &quot;pāda&quot; (II.) limits the possible patterns the first foot (I.) may assume.

The scheme below, given by Macdonell, shows his understanding of the form of the &quot;śloka&quot; in the classical period of Sanskrit literature (4th–11th centuries CE):

In poems of the intermediate period, such as the Bhagavad Gita, a fourth &quot;vipulā&quot; is found. This occurs 28 times in the Bhagavad Gita, that is, as often as the third &quot;vipulā&quot;. When this &quot;vipulā&quot; is used, there is a word-break (caesura) after the fourth syllable:

:|  u  u  u  –,  |  –  u  –  u  ||

Two rules that always apply are:
:1. In both &quot;pādas&quot;, in syllables 2–3, u u is not allowed.
:2. In the second &quot;pāda&quot;, in syllables 2–4, – u – is not allowed

The &quot;pathyā&quot; and &quot;vipulā&quot; half-verses are arranged in the table above in order of frequency of occurrence. Out of 2579 half-verses taken from Kalidasa, Bharavi, Magha, and Bilhana, each of the four admissible forms of &quot;śloka&quot; in this order claims the following share: 2289, 116, 89, 85; that is, 89% of the half-verses have the regular &quot;pathyā&quot; form.

The various &quot;vipulā&quot;s, in the order above, are known to scholars writing in English as the first, second, third and fourth &quot;vipulā&quot;, or the paeanic, choriambic, molossic, and trochaic &quot;vipulā&quot; respectively. In Sanskrit writers, they are referred to as the &quot;na-&quot;, &quot;bha-&quot;, &quot;ma-&quot;, and &quot;ra-vipulā&quot;. A fifth &quot;vipulā&quot;, known as the minor Ionic, in which the first &quot;pāda&quot; ends | u u – x |, is sometimes found in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, although rarely.

Macdonell&#x27;s chart given above is in fact too restrictive with regard the first four syllables in a &quot;vipulā&quot; verse. For example, the first quarter verse of the &quot;Rāmayaṇa&quot; (critical edition) contains a &quot;na-vipulā&quot; and scans ⏑ – – – ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ – (&quot;tapaḥsvādhyāyanirataṃ&quot;). Other examples are easy to find among classical poets, e.g., &quot;Rāmacarita&quot; 1.76 &quot;manyur dehāvadhir ayaṃ&quot; – – – – ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ –. In the ma-vipulā, a caesura is not obligatory after the fifth syllable, e.g., &quot;Śiśupālavadha&quot; 2.1a &quot;yiyakṣamāṇenāhūtaḥ&quot; ⏑ – ⏑ – – – – –.

Noteworthy is the avoidance of an iambic cadence in the first &quot;pāda&quot;. By comparison, syllables 5–8 of any &quot;pāda&quot; in the old Vedic &quot;anuṣṭubh&quot; metre typically had the iambic ending u – u x (where &quot;x&quot; represents an &quot;anceps&quot; syllable).

Statistical studies examining the frequency of the &quot;vipulā&quot;s and the patterns in the earlier part of the &quot;pāda&quot; have been carried out to try to establish the preferences of various authors for different metrical patterns. It is believed that this may help to establish relative dates for the poems, and to identify interpolated passages.

==Examples==
A typical &quot;&quot; is the following, which opens the Bhagavad Gita:
: 
:

:| – – – – | u – – – |
:| u u – – | u – u – ||
:| – u – – | u – – u |
:| u u – u | u – u u ||

:&quot;(Dhṛtaraṣṭra said:) In the place of righteousness, at Kurukṣetra,
:gathered together and desiring battle,
:my sons and the sons of Pandu,
:what did they do, Sanjaya?&quot;

From the period of high classical Sanskrit literature comes this benediction, which opens Bāṇabhaṭṭa&#x27;s biographical poem &quot;Harṣacaritam&quot; (7th century CE):
:

:| u – – u | u – – u | – u – u | u – u – ||
:| – – u u | u – – u | – – – – | u – u – ||

:&quot;Praise be to Śambhu, beautified by the chowrie moon touching his lofty head;
:like a foundation pillar of a city that is the universe.&quot;

When a &quot;śloka&quot; is recited, performers sometimes leave a pause after each &quot;pāda&quot;, at other times only after the second &quot;pāda&quot;. (See External links.)

==Difference between shloka and mantra==

A Shloka has to be composed in a specific metre (chhanda), with a specific number of lines with a specific number of words per line, each word could be a mantra. For example, viṣṇu sahastranāma is in anuṣṭup chhanda (two lines of four words each).

A mantra, on the other hand, is prefixed by omkara (primordial sound) and suffixed by the essential nama (name) and the salutary word nama (salutation) between the prefix and the suffix. No metre is prescribed. The lyrics in any Vārnic or matric metres are shlokas, but stanzas from Vedic hymns are not shloka, despite it being a common mistake to think this.

<text>Abū ʿAlī Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī Ṭūsī () (1018 – 1092), better known by his honorific title of Niẓām al-Mulk (), was a Persian scholar, jurist, political philosopher and vizier of the Seljuk Empire. Rising from a low position within the empire, he became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the empire for 20 years after the assassination of Sultan Alp Arslan in 1072, serving as the archetypal &quot;good vizier&quot;. Viewed by many historians as &quot;the most important statesman in Islamic history&quot;, the policies implemented by Nizam ul-Mulk remained the basic foundation for administrative state structures in the Muslim world up until the 20th century.

One of his most important legacies was the founding of a system of madrasas in cities across the Seljuk Empire which were called the &quot;Nizamiyyas&quot; after him. He also wrote the &quot;Siyasatnama&quot; (&quot;Book of Government&quot;), a political treatise that uses historical examples to discuss justice, effective rule, and the role of government in Islamic society.

==Early life and service to the Ghaznavids==
Abu Ali Hasan was born on 10 April 1018, in a small village named Radkan, near Tus, in Iran, to a &quot;dehqan&quot; family. Growing up he studied Shafi fiqh and the Ashari school of theology. His father Ali ibn Ishak served as a financial officer to the Ghaznavids. However, when the Seljuk Turks defeated the Ghaznavids at the Battle of Dandanaqan in 1040, and conquered Khorasan, Abu Ali Hasan&#x27;s father fled to Ghazni. Hasan followed his father to Ghazni, and it is there where he first assumed a government office. He remained in Ghazni for three or four years, when he left the Ghaznavid court and entered service with the Seljuks.

==Service to the Seljuks==
===Reign of Tughril and Alp Arslan===
Around the year of 1043, Abu Ali Hasan stopped serving the Ghaznavids and entered the service of the Seljuk Turks. He later became chief administrator of the entire Khorasan province by 1059. When Tughril died childless in the city of Ray, he was succeeded by his nephew Suleiman which was contested by Alp Arslan, both of them sons of Tughril&#x27;s brother Chaghri. His cousin Kutalmish who had both been a vital part of his campaigns and later a supporter of Yinal&#x27;s rebellion also put forth a claim. Alp Arslan, with the aid of Abu Ali Hasan, defeated Kutalmish and succeeded him on 27 April 1064.

After Alp Arslan had consolidated his power in the Sejluk realm, he appointed Abu Ali Hasan as his vizier who would remain in that position throughout the reigns of Alp Arslan (1063–1072) and Malik-Shah I (1072–1092). Abu Ali Hasan was also given the title of &quot;Nizam al-Mulk&quot; (&quot;Order of the Realm&quot;).

Alp Arslan&#x27;s strength lays in the military realm. Domestic affairs were handled by Nizam al-Mulk, who also founded the administrative organization that characterized and strengthened the sultanate during the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son, Malik Shah I. Military &quot;iqtā&#x27;&quot; (fiefs), governed by Seljuk princes, were established to provide support for the soldiery and to accommodate the nomadic Turks to the established Anatolian agricultural scene. This type of military fiefdom enabled the nomadic Turks to draw on the resources of the sedentary Iranians, and other established cultures within the Seljuk realm, and allowed Alp Arslan to field a huge standing army without depending on tribute from conquest to pay his soldiers. He not only had enough food from his subjects to maintain his military, but the taxes collected from traders and merchants added to his coffers sufficiently to fund his continuous wars.

Nizam accompanied Alp Arslan in all his campaigns and journeys, except a few. In February/March 1064 Alp Arslan, along with his son Malik-Shah I and Nizam al-Mulk, campaigned in Byzantine Armenia, where they managed to capture Ani. Several minor rulers then acknowledged Seljuk authority, while Alp Arslan and Nizam continued to penetrate deeper into the Caucasus, reaching Georgia. The Georgian ruler Bagrat IV, managed to make peace with Alp Arslan by giving his niece to him in marriage.

Nizam also made some expeditions on his own and conquered the citadel of Estakhr from the Shabankara chieftain Fadluya in 1067, and made another expedition in Fars. These successful conquests are said to have greatly increased his reputation. On 26 August 1071, the decisive Battle of Manzikert was fought, which Nizam al-Mulk had missed because he had been sent to Persia with a convoy of materials.

===Reign of Malik Shah I===

Following Alp Arslan&#x27;s assassination in 1072, Malik-Shah I was challenged in battle by his uncle, Kavurt. In January 1074, their armies met near Hamadan. Kavurt&#x27;s troops consisted of the traditional Turkmen elements from Alp Arslan&#x27;s army, while Malik&#x27;s consisted of &quot;ghulams&quot; and contingents of Kurdish and Arab troops. Due to Turkmen defections to Malik&#x27;s army, Kavurt was defeated and, despite Malik&#x27;s consideration for mercy, later poisoned, presumably on the orders of Nizam al-Mulk.

Under Nizam&#x27;s excellent guidance the Seljuk armies contained the Ghaznavids in Khorasan, rolled back the Fatimids in Syria, defeated other Seljuk pretenders to the throne, invaded Georgia and reduced it to a tributary state, compelled the submission of regional governors, and kept the Abbasid Caliphs in a position of impotence.

Nizam al-Mulk left a great mark on organization of the Seljuk governmental bodies and hence the title Nizam al-Mulk which translates as &quot;Order of the Realm.&quot; He bridged political gaps among the Abbasids, the Seljuks, and their various rivals such as the Fatimids. The Seljuk military was heavily mixed of different ethnicity, including Turks, Armenians, Greeks, Arabs, and Slavs. Nizam, however, favored Iranian soldiers, such as the Dailamites, Khorasanis, and the Shabankara. He also favored non-Iranian soldiers such as the Georgians.

Nizam al-Mulk&#x27;s many political objectives included:

* Creating an employment opportunity for the Turkmens, who had immigrated to the Iranian plateau during the Seljuk successes in Persia, the nomadic way of life of the Turkmens represented a significant threat to the political and economic stability of the country.
* Demonstrating the power of the Sultan (i.e. the strength and mobility of his forces, but also his grace towards docile rebels).
* Maintaining local Sunni and Shiite rulers as vassals of the Sultan and the increased use of relatives of the Sultan as provincial governors.
* Preventing dissents over the succession of Malik-Shah I.
* Maintaining good relations with the Abbasid Caliphate.

In 1081/1082, Ibn Bahmanyar, one of the many enemies of Nizam, tried to poison him, but failed and was blinded by Nizam. After the blinding of Ibn Bahmanyar, the enemies of Nizam made false stories about him and his son. This greatly angered Nizam&#x27;s son Jamal al-Mulk, who tore out the tongue of Ja&#x27;farak, one of the perpetrators of the false stories. Malik Shah had no power to intervene in the event, but instead had Jamal poisoned.

In 1091, a group of Qarmatians sacked Basra, while the Isma&#x27;ilis under the leadership of Hassan-i Sabbah seized the fortress of Alamut. Moreover, the succession to the sultanate was complicated by the death of two of Malik-Shah&#x27;s eldest sons: Dawud (died 1082) and Ahmad (died 1088), whom both were sons of the Kara-Khanid Princess Terken Khatun. She also had a son named Mahmud (born 1087) whom she wanted to succeed his father, while Nizam and most of the Seljuk army was in favor of Berkyaruq, the oldest of all Malik-Shah&#x27;s living sons and born to a Seljuk princess. Terken Khatun then allied with Taj al-Mulk Abu&#x27;l Ghana&#x27;im to try to remove Nizam from his post. Taj even accused Nizam of corruption before the sultan. Malik Shah I, however, did not dare to dismiss Nizam. Nizam later besieged Alamut, but was forced to withdraw.

In 1092, Nizam, just before his death, knowing that his enemies were planning plots against him, made a famous speech at the court:

==Works==

Aside from his extraordinary influence as vizier with full authority, he is also well known for systematically founding a number of schools of higher education in several cities like Baghdad, Isfahan, Amol, Nishapur, Mosul, Basra, and Herat, the famous Nizamiyyah schools, which were named after him.

Nizam al-Mulk is also widely known for his voluminous treatise on kingship titled &quot;Siyasatnama&quot; (&quot;Book of Government&quot;) which was written after Malik Shah had requested that his ministers produce books on government, administration and the troubles facing the nation. However, the treatise made by Nizam was the only one to receive approval and was consequently accepted as forming &quot;the law of the constitution of the nation&quot;. The treatise uses historical examples to discuss justice, effective rule, and the role of government in Islamic society, and has been compared to Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot;. The work also discusses various aspects of state surveillance and spying, advising rulers to establish an extensive espionage network.

He also wrote a book titled &quot;Dastur al-Wuzarā&quot;, written for his son, Abu&#x27;l-Fath Fakhr al-Malik, which is not dissimilar to the famous book of Qabus nama.

==Death==

Nizam al-Mulk was assassinated en route from Isfahan to Baghdad on 10 Ramadan 485 A.H. (14 October 1092) The mainstream literature says he was stabbed by the dagger of a member of the Assassins, sent by the notorious Hassan-i Sabbah near Nahavand, as he was being carried on his litter. The killer approached him disguised as a Sufi.

This account is particularly interesting in light of a possibly apocryphal story that first appeared in English in the introduction to Edward Fitzgerald&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot;. In this story a pact is formed between a young Nizam al-Mulk (at that time known as Abdul Khassem) and his two friends, Omar Khayyam and Hassan-i-Sabbah. Their agreement stated that if one should rise to prominence, that they would help the other two to do likewise. Nizam al-Mulk was the first to do this when he was appointed vizier to the sultan Alp Arslan. To fulfill the pact he offered both friends positions of rank within the court. Omar refused the offer, asking instead to be given the means to continue his studies indefinitely. This Nizam did, as well as building him an observatory. Although Hassan, unlike Omar, decided to accept the appointment offered to him, he was forced to flee after plotting to depose Nizam as vizier. Subsequently, Hassan came upon and conquered the fortress of Alamut, from where he established the Assassins. According to Bernard Lewis, this tale is unlikely to be true because Hassan-i Sabbah died in 1124, and Omar Khayyam in 1123 at the earliest. Since Nizam al-Mulk was born in 1020 at the latest, the three were not of similar ages and were probably not students together.

==Legacy==

Nizam al-Mulk was a skilled and effective vizier, he represented the majesty, splendor and hospitality of the Barmakids, historians and poets describe him as a great organizer and an ideal soldier and scholar. Because of his talents, it was possible for the Seljuk Turks to establish a powerful empire in their new home. Nizam was not only the leader of the Persian-dominated bureaucratic (&quot;divan&quot;), but was also an &quot;atabeg&quot; who served in the royal court (&quot;dadgar&quot;) and played an important role between the politically and culturally different Iranians and Turks. He was also responsible for establishing distinctly Persian forms of government and administration which would last for centuries. Because of his excellent tutorship and close friendship with Malik-Shah, he was usually called &quot;father&quot; by him. He was even greatly respected by his &quot;ghulams&quot;, who, after the death of Nizam, took revenge on several of his rivals, such as Taj al-Mulk Abu&#x27;l Ghana&#x27;im.

Even after his death his family continued to play an important role in the Seljuk Empire. He was married to a niece or daughter of Bagrat IV of Georgia, who had previously been married or betrothed to Alp Arslan. All of his twelve sons held important offices in the Seljuk Empire, the most prominent of his sons were: Ahmad ibn Nizam al-Mulk, served as the vizier of the Seljuk Sultan Muhammad I Tapar and the Abbasid caliph al-Mustarshid; Shams al-Mulk Uthman was the governor of Merv and head of the Seljuk military; Fakhr al-Mulk served as the vizier of Berkyaruq and Muhammad I Tapar; Jamal al-Mulk (who died before Nizam) served as the governor of Balkh; Izz al-Mulk and Mu&#x27;ayyid al-Mulk served as viziers of Berkyaruq; Imad al-Mulk Abu&#x27;l-Kasim served as the vizier of the Seljuk governor of Balkh.

<doc id="519075" wikidata="Q8068156" url="?curid=519075" title="ZeD">
<text>ZeD was a Canadian variety television program and website. The series premiered on CBC Television on March 18, 2002 and ran to 2006. Hosted primarily by Sharon Lewis and Ziya Tong, &quot;ZeD&quot; publicized creative works from Canada and other countries, including a substantial portion of material created by viewers and new artists. &quot;ZeD&quot; thus considered itself to be &quot;open-source television.&quot;

The website claimed thousands of users, and the series, while somewhat obscure, was nominated for several awards and influenced some US television. A music album, &quot;ZeD: Live Off The Floor&quot;, was also spun off the series.

==Concept and creation==
The concept of &quot;ZeD&quot; was originally developed by Rae Hull, who was the regional director for CBC in Vancouver, British Columbia. and new media pioneer McLean Greaves. It was initially imagined as being &quot;, hip and fast moving, with no segment longer than a few minutes,&quot; but beyond this contributors would influence the content.

In November 2001, CBC invited Canadians to come up with cheap but intelligent creative ideas in connection with the anticipated series &quot;&quot;zed&quot;,&quot; and received 1,000 efforts. When &quot;ZeD&quot; premiered on March 18, 2002, it was still considered to be in development, and its first four weeks from March to April were experimental. It was not advertised, except for CBC informing the press, since &quot;ZeD&quot; was meant to be discovered among viewers who would then inform other viewers. CBC was still hoping to attract contributors, and Hull added, &quot;I&#x27;d be happy if people discovered &quot;ZeD&quot; and made their own decisions about it.&quot;

In March 2002, the series was called ZeD beta v 0.1. The name &quot;ZeD&quot; appears to have been chosen to suggest the series was uniquely Canadian, since &quot;zed&quot; is how Canadians pronounce the letter &quot;Z.&quot; The &quot;ZeD&quot; website was also launched at the time. Both the series and website were based in Vancouver.

==Format==
The program, which aired every weeknight on the CBC, aired music, short films, animation, visual art and spoken word pieces from around the world. The subject matter, which ranged from comedy to drama, was mature and could include nudity and profanity, and thus episodes began with a humorously worded call for viewer&#x27;s discretion. Each episode was 40 minutes long, with no advertisements during the show.

=== Interactive website ===
Its website allowed people to view certain works, and also upload their creations onto the website, which might then appear on television. The press stated that 20% of the material on television had been uploaded from the website. Altogether, in 2002 the website claimed 5,000 members. In 2005, this had increased to 45,962 members. Although some films are not available on the website, viewers of the television show could e-mail &quot;ZeD&quot; and request replays on Fridays, which were named &quot;Feedback Fridays&quot;.

=== Movies aired ===
Films seen on &quot;ZeD&quot; include &quot;Cannibalism and Your Teen&quot;, which is a humorous parody of the father-knows-best ideology, and &quot;Ryan&quot;. The anti-racism comedy &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot; was also aired more than once. Other popular short films include the animated comedy &quot;Strange Invaders&quot;, which combines the themes of extraterrestrials and parenthood and notably appeared on &quot;ZeD&quot; on March 22, 2002, as well as &quot;George Lucas in Love&quot;. Since works by viewers ranged in quality, &quot;ZeD&quot; required rigorous editing, especially to avoid copyright violations. Artists generally received $200 for each minute of work published by &quot;ZeD&quot;.

=== Music ===

Music on &quot;ZeD&quot; was sometimes presented in the form of music videos, but musical guests also appeared. Among such guests were William Clarke Brown, who was also known as Lyrical, and claimed No. 1 spot for most voted musician, and Sam Roberts, who performed &quot;Brother Down&quot; and &quot;This Is How I Live&quot; on October 15, 2002. On December 2, 2003, an album was produced by music producer Jon Siddall and Mashingaidze-Greaves, titled &quot;ZeD: Live Off The Floor&quot; which featured music taken live off &quot;ZeD&quot;. &quot;Eye Weekly&quot; critic Kevin Hainey said the music generally seemed &quot;lush&quot; and that the CD gave attention to upstart musicians such as Take 5. He especially approved of the new musicians, such as Kris Demeanor and The Floor.
Tracks included:
*&quot;This Is How I Live&quot;
*&quot;Monday Monday Monday&quot; by Tegan and Sara
*&quot;Evolution&quot; by The Cinematic Orchestra
*&quot;Big&quot; by BrassMunk
*&quot;Left and Leaving&quot; by The Weakerthans
*&quot;London Still&quot; by The Waifs
*&quot;The Centaur&quot; by Buck 65
*&quot;Untitled&quot; by The Organ

=== Halloween specials ===

Another feature of &quot;ZeD&quot; was its annual Halloween episodes, which ran longer than 40 minutes. The 2004 special, &quot;Night of the Living ZeD,&quot; was two hours long. These episodes featured some of &quot;ZeD&quot;&#x27;s more disturbing short films and art, or comedies with supernatural or gothic themes. &quot;&quot; and &quot;Flying Saucer Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll&quot; are examples of the latter. In 2004, guest musician Jorane performed a &quot;witchy acid cello&quot; and there were &quot;several freaky faux-Victorian sideshow acts in-studio.&quot;

=== Hosts ===

&quot;ZeD&quot; was originally hosted by several hosts including Bif Naked and Nobu and Mio Adilman. The program was subsequently hosted by Sharon Lewis until the 2004–2005 season, when she was replaced by Ziya Tong. Lewis also took time off to have a baby during her hosting, necessitating guest hosts such as the brothers Adilman. During this time, in March 2004, the Adilmans hosted Zed Uncut, which was a five-hour episode shot live.

==Re-formatting and cancellation==
On January 3, 2006, &quot;ZeD&quot; was revived as three television series to air weekly. Zed Real was the first, playing on Tuesdays, hosted by Jarrett Martineau and featuring documentaries. Zed Candid, airing on Wednesdays, featured short films and was hosted by Trish Williams, Suzanne Bastien and Zorana Sadiq. Finally, Zed Tunes aired on Thursdays, with a focus on music. It was hosted by Jenna Chow. All three continued to be aired on the CBC and ran for one hour, starting around 11:30 pm on their respective nights.

On May 7, 2006, the CBC announced the cancellation of the series. However, CBC said its website would still be available, and that &quot;we&#x27;re not letting go of some of the innovative ideas that the production crew have brought.&quot; Lise Lareau of the Canadian Media Guild replied that CBC was &quot;abandoning the things that make public television special.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;ZeD&quot; was nominated for an Emmy Award. The series was nominated for Gemini Awards, including for Best Music, Best Variety Program or Series, Best Visual Effects, and Best Cross Platform Project. Tong was also nominated for a 2005 Gemini Award for Viewer&#x27;s Choice for Lifestyle Host. In 2002, television critic Alex Strachan wrote that &quot;Almost everything about ZeD is exactly right, from its sense of timing... to the lack of commercials&quot; and that Sharon Lewis&#x27; style was nicely easygoing. That year, 70,000 watched the show, which was aimed at people in their twenties and thirties who were comfortable with technology. Still, the executive producer Mashingaidze-Greaves admitted that &quot;millions of Canadians&quot; did not know what &quot;ZeD&quot; was during its run.

The sexual content of the website and series was sometimes controversial. In 2002, some of CBC&#x27;s critics on the website CBC Watch preferred to see the sexual content unaired, and CBC quoted them as predicting that &quot;&quot;ZeD&quot; will mostly be remembered for taking the &#x27;L&#x27; out of public broadcasting.&quot; &quot;ZeD&quot; also received letters from viewers who thought one short film featuring a sexual scene between brothers was unusual. &quot;ZeD&quot; explained that &quot;ZeD isn&#x27;t about gratuitous nudity or being gross just for the sake of being gross. Don&#x27;t get us wrong. We&#x27;re not squeamish about anything... except outright stupidity.&quot;

Current TV, a television channel launched by politician Al Gore in 2005, was partially influenced by &quot;ZeD&quot;. This led Mashingaidze-Greaves to express &quot;ZeD&quot; had &quot;the world leaders in interactive television, without a doubt.&quot; Mashingaidze-Greaves also said he did not fear having a larger rival in &quot;Current TV&quot; and said &quot;ZeD&quot; would continually innovate itself.

<text>Rambola Dubey (; 11 August 1511 – 30 July 1623), known as Tulsidas (), was a Vaishnava (Ramanandi) Hindu saint and poet, renowned for his devotion to the deity Rama. He wrote several popular works in Sanskrit, Awadhi, and Braj Bhasha, but is best known as the author of the &quot;Hanuman Chalisa&quot; and of the epic &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;, a retelling of the Sanskrit &quot;Ramayana&quot;, based on Rama&#x27;s life, in the vernacular Awadhi language.

Tulsidas spent most of his life in the cities of Banaras (modern Varanasi) and Ayodhya. The Tulsi Ghat on the Ganges in Varanasi is named after him. He founded the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple in Varanasi, believed to stand at the place where he had the sight of the deity. Tulsidas started the Ramlila plays, a folk-theatre adaptation of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;.

He has been acclaimed as one of the greatest poets in Hindi, Indian, and world literature. The impact of Tulsidas and his works on the art, culture and society in India is widespread and is seen today in the vernacular language, Ramlila plays, Hindustani classical music, popular music, and television series.
==Transliteration and etymology==

The Sanskrit name of Tulsidas can be transliterated in two ways. Using the original Sanskrit, the name is written as &quot;Tulasīdāsa&quot;. Using the Hunterian transliteration system, it is written as &quot;Tulsidas&quot; or &quot;Tulsīdās&quot; reflecting the vernacular pronunciation (since the written Indian languages maintain the vestigial letters that are no longer pronounced). The lost vowels are an aspect of the Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages and can vary between regions. The name is a compound of two Sanskrit words: Tulasī, which is an Indian variety of the basil plant considered auspicious by Vaishnavas (devotees of god Vishnu and his avatars like Rama), and Dāsa, which means &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;servant&quot; and by extension, &quot;devotee&quot;.

===Sources===

Tulsidas himself has given only a few facts and hints about events of his life in various works. Till late nineteenth century, the two widely known ancient sources on Tulsidas&#x27; life were the &quot;Bhaktamal&quot; composed by Nabhadas between 1583 and 1639, and a commentary on &quot;Bhaktamal&quot; titled &quot;Bhaktirasbodhini&quot; composed by Priyadas in 1712. Nabhadas was a contemporary of Tulsidas and wrote a six-line stanza on Tulsidas describing him as an incarnation of Valmiki. Priyadas&#x27; work was composed around a hundred years after the death of Tulsidas and had eleven additional stanzas, describing seven miracles or spiritual experiences from the life of Tulsidas. During the 1920s, two more ancient biographies of Tulsidas were published based on old manuscripts – the &quot;Mula Gosain Charit&quot; composed by Veni Madhav Das in 1630 and the &quot;Gosain Charit&quot; composed by Dasanidas (also known as Bhavanidas) around 1770. Veni Madhav Das was a disciple and contemporary of Tulsidas and his work gave a new date for Tulsidas&#x27; birth. The work by Bhavanidas presented more narratives in greater detail as compared to the work by Priyadas. In the 1950s a fifth ancient account was published based on an old manuscript, the &quot;Gautam Chandrika&quot; composed by Krishnadatta Misra of Varanasi in 1624. Krishnadatta Misra&#x27;s father was a close companion of Tulsidas. The accounts published later are not considered authentic by some modern scholars, whereas some other scholars have been unwilling to dismiss them. Together, these five works form a set of traditional biographies on which modern biographies of Tulsidas are based.

===Incarnation of Valmiki===

He is believed by many to be a reincarnation of Valmiki. In the Hindu scripture &quot;Bhavishyottar Purana&quot;, the god Shiva tells his wife Parvati how Valmiki, who received a boon from Hanuman to sing the glory of Rama in vernacular language, will incarnate in future in the Kali Yuga (the present and last yuga or epoch within a cycle of four yugas).

Nabhadas writes in his &quot;Bhaktamal&quot; (literally, &quot;the Garland of bhakt or devotee&quot;) that Tulsidas was the re-incarnation of Valmiki in the Kali Yuga. The Ramanandi sect believes that it was Valmiki himself who incarnated as Tulsidas in the Kali Yuga.

According to a traditional account, Hanuman went to Valmiki numerous times to hear him sing the Ramayana, but Valmiki turned down the request saying that Hanuman being a monkey was unworthy of hearing the epic. After the victory of Rama over Ravana, Hanuman went to the Himalayas to continue his worship of Rama. There he scripted a play version of the Ramayana called &quot;Mahanataka&quot; or &quot;Hanuman Nataka&quot; engraved on the Himalayan rocks using his nails. When Valmiki saw the play written by Hanuman, he anticipated that the beauty of the &quot;Mahanataka&quot; would eclipse his own Ramayana. Hanuman was saddened at Valmiki&#x27;s state of mind and, being a true bhakta without any desire for glory, Hanuman cast all the rocks into the ocean, some parts of which are believed to be available today as &quot;Hanuman Nataka&quot;. After this, Valmiki was instructed by Hanuman to take birth as Tulsidas and compose the Ramayana in the vernacular.

==Early life==

===Birth===
Tulsidas was born on Saptami, the seventh day of Shukla Paksha, the bright half of the lunar Hindu calendar month Shraavana (July–August). This correlates with 11 August 1511 of the Gregorian calendar. Although as many as three places are mentioned as his birthplace, most scholars identify the place with Soron, Kasganj district in Uttar Pradesh, a city on the banks of the river Ganga. In 2012 Soron was declared officially by the government of Uttar Pradesh as the birthplace of Tulsi Das. His parents were Hulsi and Atmaram Dubey. Most sources identify him as a Saryupareen Brahmin of the Bharadwaj &quot;Gotra&quot; (lineage). Tulsidas and Sir George Grierson give the year of his birth as Vikram 1568 (1511 CE). These biographers include Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, Ramghulam Dwivedi, James Lochtefeld, Swami Sivananda and others. The year 1497 appears in many current-day biographies in India and in popular culture. Biographers who disagree with this year argue that it makes the life span of Tulsidas equal 126 years, which in their opinion is &quot;unlikely if not impossible&quot;. In contrast, Ramchandra Shukla says that an age of 126 is not impossible for a Mahatma (&quot;great soul&quot;) like Tulsidas. The Government of India and provincial governments celebrated the 500th birth anniversary of Tulsidas in the year 2011 CE, according to the year of Tulsidas&#x27; birth in popular culture.

====Childhood====

Legend goes that Tulsidas was born after staying in the womb for twelve months, he had all thirty-two teeth in his mouth at birth, his health and looks were like that of a five-year-old boy, and he did not cry at the time of his birth but uttered &quot;Rama&quot; instead. He was therefore named &quot;Rambola&quot; (literally, &quot;he who uttered Rama&quot;), as Tulsidas himself states in &quot;Vinaya Patrika&quot;. As per the &quot;Mula Gosain Charita&quot;, he was born under the Abhuktamūla constellation, which according to Hindu astrology causes immediate danger to the life of the father. Due to the inauspicious astrological configurations at the time of his birth, on the fourth night he was sent away by his parents with Chuniya (some sources call her Muniya), a female house-help of Hulsi. In his works &quot;Kavitavali&quot; and &quot;Vinayapatrika&quot;, Tulsidas attests to his family abandoning him after birth.

Chuniya took the child to her village of Haripur and looked after him for five and a half years, after which she died. Rambola was left to fend for himself as an impoverished orphan, and wandered from door to door for menial jobs and alms. It is believed that the goddess Parvati assumed the form of a Brahmin woman and looked out for Rambola every day. or alternately, the disciple of Anantacharya. Rambola was given the &quot;Virakta Diksha&quot; (Vairagi initiation) with the new name of Tulsidas. Tulsidas narrates the dialogue that took place during the first meeting with his guru in a passage in the &quot;Vinayapatrika&quot;. When he was seven years old, his Upanayana (&quot;sacred thread ceremony&quot;) was performed by Narharidas on the fifth day of the bright half of the month of Magha (January–February) at Ayodhya, a pilgrimage site related to Rama. Tulsidas started his learning at Ayodhya. After some time, Narharidas took him to a particular &quot;Varaha Kshetra&quot; Soron (a holy place with temple dedicated to Varaha – the boar avatar of Vishnu), where he first narrated the Ramayana to Tulsidas. Tulsidas mentions this in the Ramcharitmanas.


Most authors identify the Varaha Kshetra referred to by Tulsidas with the Sookarkshetra is the Soron Varaha Kshetra in modern-day Kasganj, Tulsidas further mentions in the Ramcharitmanas that his guru repeatedly narrated the Ramayana to him, which led him to understand it somewhat.

Tulsidas later came to the sacred city of Varanasi and studied Sanskrit grammar, four Vedas, six Vedangas, Jyotisha and the six schools of Hindu philosophy over a period of 15–16 years from the guru Shesha Sanatana who was based at the Pancaganga Ghat in Varanasi. Shesha Sanatana was a friend of Narharidas and a renowned scholar on literature and philosophy.

===Marriage and renunciation===

There are two contrasting views regarding the marital status of Tulsidas. According to the &quot;Tulsi Prakash&quot; and some other works, Tulsidas was married to Ratnavali on the eleventh day of the bright half of the Kartik month (October–November) in Vikram 1604 (1561 CE). Ratnavali was the daughter of Dinbandhu Pathak, a Brahmin of the Parashar gotra, who belonged to narayanpur village of Gonda district. They had a son named Tarak who died as a toddler. Once when Tulsidas had gone to a Hanuman temple, Ratnavali went to her father&#x27;s home with her brother. When Tulsidas learned of this, he swam across the Sarju river in the night to meet his wife. Ratnavali chided Tulsidas for this, and remarked that if Tulsidas was even half as devoted to God as he was to her body of flesh and blood, he would have been redeemed. Tulsidas left her instantly and left for the holy city of Prayag. Here, he renounced the grihastha (householder&#x27;s life) stage and became a sadhu (ascetic).

Some authors consider the marriage episode of Tulsidas to be a later interpolation and maintain among that he was celibate. These include Rambhadracharya, who cite two verses in the &quot;Vinayapatrika&quot; and &quot;Hanuman Bahuka&quot; that Tulsidas never married and was a sadhu from childhood.

==Later life==
=== Travels ===
After renunciation, Tulsidas spent most of his time at Varanasi, Prayag, Ayodhya, and Chitrakuta but visited many other nearby and far-off places. He travelled across India to many places, studying with different people, meeting saints and sadhus, and meditating. The &quot;Mula Gosain Charita&quot; gives an account of his travels to the four pilgrimages of Hindus (Badrinath, Dwarka, Puri and Rameshwaram) and the Himalayas. He visited Lake Manasarovar in current-day Tibet, where tradition holds he had Darshan (sight) of Kakabhushundi, the crow who is one of the four narrators in the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;.

=== Darshan of Hanuman ===
Tulsidas hints at several places in his works, that he had met face to face with Hanuman and Rama. The detailed account of his meetings with Hanuman and Rama are given in the &quot;Bhaktirasbodhini&quot; of Priyadas. According to Priyadas&#x27; account, Tulsidas used to visit the woods outside Varanasi for his morning ablutions with a water pot. On his return to the city, he used to offer the remaining water to a certain tree. This quenched the thirst of a Preta (a type of ghost believed to be ever thirsty for water), who appeared to Tulsidas and offered him a boon. Tulsidas said he wished to see Rama with his eyes, to which the Preta responded that it was beyond him. However, the Preta said that he could guide Tulsidas to Hanuman, who could grant the boon Tulsidas asked for. The Preta told Tulsidas that Hanuman comes everyday disguised as a leper to listen to his Katha, he is the first to arrive and last to leave.

That evening Tulsidas noted that the first listener to arrive at his discourse was an old leper, who sat at the end of the gathering. After the Katha was over, Tulsidas quietly followed the leper to the woods. In the woods, at the spot where the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple stands today, Tulsidas firmly fell at the leper&#x27;s feet, shouting &quot;I know who you are&quot; and &quot;You cannot escape me&quot;. At first the leper feigned ignorance but Tulsidas did not relent. Then the leper revealed his original form of Hanuman and blessed Tulsidas. When granted a boon, Tulsidas told Hanuman he wanted to see Rama face to face. Hanuman told him to go to Chitrakuta where he would see Rama with his own eyes.

At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas bows down to a particular Preta and asks for his grace (&quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;, Doha 1.7). According to Rambhadracharya, this is the same Preta which led Tulsidas to Hanuman.

=== Darshan of Rama ===
As per Priyadas&#x27; account, Tulsidas followed the instruction of Hanuman and started living in an Ashram at Ramghat in Chitrakoot Dham. One day Tulsidas went to perform the Parikrama (circumambulation) of the Kamadgiri mountain. He saw two princes, one dark and the other fair, dressed in green robes pass by mounted on horsebacks. Tulsidas was enraptured at the sight, however he could not recognise them and took his eyes off them. Later Hanuman asked Tulsidas if he saw Rama and his brother Lakshmana on horses. Tulsidas was disappointed and repentful. Hanuman assured Tulsidas that he would have the sight of Rama once again the next morning. Tulsidas recalls this incident in a song of the &quot;Gitavali&quot; and laments how &quot;his eyes turned his own enemies&quot; by staying fixed to the ground and how everything happened in a trice.

On the next morning, Wednesday, the new-moon day of Magha, Vikram 1607 (1551 CE) or 1621 (1565 CE) as per some sources, Rama again appeared to Tulsidas, this time as a child. Tulsidas was making sandalwood paste when a child came and asked for a sandalwood tilaka (a religious mark on the forehead). This time Hanuman gave a hint to Tulsidas and he had a full view of Rama. Tulsidas was so charmed that he forgot about the sandalwood. Rama took the sandalwood paste and put a tilaka himself on his forehead and Tulsidas&#x27; forehead before disappearing. This famous incidence is described in the verse &quot;&quot;.

In a verse in the &quot;Vinayapatrika&quot;, Tulsidas alludes to a certain &quot;miracle at Chitrakuta&quot;, and thanks Rama for what he did for him at Chitrakuta. Some biographers conclude that the deed of Rama at Chitrakuta referred to by Tulsidas is the Darshan of Rama.

=== Darshan of Yajnavalkya and Bharadvaja ===
In Vikram 1628 (1572 CE), Tulsidas left Chitrakuta for Prayag where he stayed during the Magh Mela (the annual festival in January). Six days after the Mela ended, he had the Darshan of the sages Yajnavalkya and Bharadvaja under a banyan tree. In one of the four dialogues in the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;, Yajnavalkya is the speaker and Bharadvaja the listener. Tulsidas describes the meeting between Yajnavalkya and Bharadvaja after a Magha Mela festival in the Ramcharitmanas, it is this meeting where Yajnavalkya narrates the Ramcharitmanas to Bharadvaja.

=== Attributed miracles ===

Most stories about Tulsidas tend to be apocryphal, and have been carried forward by word of mouth. None of them were related by Tulsi himself, thus making it difficult to separate fact from lore and fiction. In Priyadas&#x27; biography, Tulsidas is attributed with the power of working miracles. In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought a dead Brahmin back to life. While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas who addressed her as &quot;Saubhagyavati&quot; (a woman whose husband is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true. Tulsidas said that the word has passed his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everyone present to close their eyes and utter the name of Rama. On doing so, the dead man was brought back to life. Also one who was with him for a certain period of their life received moksha (spiritual liberation) from Maya (illusory world).

Tulsidas was acclaimed in his lifetime to be a reincarnation of Valmiki, the composer of the original Ramayana in Sanskrit. 

In another miracle described by Priyadas, the Mughal Emperor Akbar summoned Tulsidas on hearing of his bringing back a dead man to life. Tulsidas declined to go as he was too engrossed in creating his verses but he was later forcibly brought before Akbar and asked to perform a miracle, which Tulsidas declined by saying &quot;It&#x27;s a lie, all I know is Rama.&quot;. The emperor imprisoned Tulsidas at Fatehpur Sikri, saying &quot;We will see this Rama.&quot;. Tulsidas refused to bow to Akbar and created a verse in praise of Hanuman, the &quot;Hanuman Chalisa&quot;, and chanted it for forty days. Suddenly an army of monkeys descended upon the town and wreaked havoc in all corners of Fatehpur Sikri, entering each home and the emperor&#x27;s harem, scratching people, and throwing bricks from ramparts. An old Hafiz told the emperor that this was the miracle of the imprisoned Tulsidas. The emperor fell at Tulsidas&#x27; feet, released him, and apologised. Tulsidas stopped the menace of monkeys and asked the emperor to abandon the place. The emperor agreed and moved back to Delhi. Ever since Akbar became a close friend of Tulsidas and he also ordered a firman that followers of Rama, Hanuman, and other Hindus, were not to be harassed in his kingdom.

Priyadas narrates a miracle of Tulsidas at Vrindavan, when he visited a temple of Krishna. When he began bowing down to the idol of Krishna, the Mahant of the temple named Parshuram decided to test Tulsidas. He told Tulsidas that he who bows down to any deity except their Ishta Devata (cherished form of divinity) is a fool, as Tulsidas&#x27; Ishta Devata was Rama. In response, Tulsidas recited the following extemporaneously composed couplet:


When Tulsidas recited this couplet, the idol of Krishna holding the flute and stick in hands changed to the idol of Rama holding the bow and arrow in hands. Some authors have expressed doubts on the couplet being composed by Tulsidas.

===Literary life===

Tulsidas started composing poetry in Sanskrit in Varanasi on the Prahlada Ghat. Tradition holds that all the verses that he composed during the day, would get lost in the night. This happened daily for eight days. On the eighth night, Shiva – whose famous Kashi Vishwanath Temple is located in Varanasi – is believed to have ordered Tulsidas in a dream to compose poetry in the vernacular instead of Sanskrit. Tulsidas woke up and saw both Shiva and Parvati who blessed him. Shiva ordered Tulsidas to go to Ayodhya and compose poetry in Awadhi. Shiva also predicted that Tulsidas&#x27; poetry would fructify like the Sama Veda. In the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas hints at having the Darshan of Shiva and Parvati in both dream and awakened state.

Tulsidas is also credited with having composed a number of wise sayings and &quot;dohas&quot; containing lessons for life. A popular maxim among them is: Don&#x27;t go there, even if a mountain of gold is showered ().

====Composition of &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;====

In the year Vikram 1650 (1593 CE), Tulsidas started composing the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; in Ayodhya on Sunday, Ramnavami day (ninth day of the bright half of the Chaitra month, which is the birthday of Rama). Tulsidas himself attests this date in the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; . He composed the epic over two years, seven months and twenty-six days, and completed the work in Vikram 1633 (1577 CE) on Vivaha Panchami, which commemorates the wedding day of Rama and Sita.

Tulsidas came to Varanasi and recited the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; to Shiva (Vishwanath) and Parvati (Annapurna) at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. A popular legend goes that the Brahmins of Varanasi, who were critical of Tulsidas for having rendered the Sanskrit Ramayana in the Awadhi, decided to test the worth of the work. A manuscript of the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; was kept at the bottom of pile of Sanskrit scriptures in the sanctum sanctorum of the Vishvanath temple in the night, and the doors of the sanctum sanctorum were locked. In the morning when the doors were opened, the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; was found at the top of the pile. The words &quot;Satyam Shivam Sundaram&quot; () were inscribed on the manuscript with the signature of Shiva. The words were also heard by the people present.

Per traditional accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi were still not satisfied, and sent two thieves to steal the manuscript. The thieves tried to break into the Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion. The thieves had a change of heart and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were. Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to discover that they were guarding his home at night. He sent the manuscript of &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; to his friend Todar Mal, the finance minister of Akbar, and donated all his money. The thieves were reformed and became devotees of Rama.

====Last compositions====
Around Vikram 1664 (1607 CE), Tulsidas was afflicted by acute pain all over his body, especially in his arms. He then composed the &quot;Hanuman Bahuk&quot;, where he describes his bodily pain and suffering in several stanzas. He was relieved of his pain after this composition. Later he was also afflicted by &quot;Bartod&quot; boils (, furuncles caused by pulling out of the hair), which may have been the cause of his death.

The Vinaypatrika is considered as the last compositions of Tulsidas, believed to be written when Kali Yuga started troubling him. In this work of 279 stanzas, he beseeches Rama to give him Bhakti (&quot;devotion&quot;), and to accept his petition. Tulsidas attests in the last stanza of &quot;Vinaypatrika&quot; that Rama himself signed the manuscript of the work. The 45th stanza of the &quot;Vinaypatrika&quot; is sung as the evening arti by many Hindus.

=== Death ===
Tulsidas died at the age of 111 on 30 July 1623 (Shravan month of the year Vikram 1680) in Assi Ghat on the bank of the river Ganga. Traditional accounts and biographers do not agree on the exact date of his death.

==Works==
Twelve works are widely considered by biographers to be written by Tulsidas, six major works and six minor works. Based on the language of the works, they have been classified into two groups as follows–
* Awadhi works – Ramcharitmanas, Ramlala Nahachhu, Barvai Ramayan, Parvati Mangal, Janaki Mangal and Ramagya Prashna.
* Braja works – Krishna Gitavali, Gitavali, Sahitya Ratna, Dohavali, Vairagya Sandipani and Vinaya Patrika.
Aside from the aforementioned works, Tulsidas is also known to have composed the Hanuman Chalisa, Hanuman Ashtak, Hanuman Bahuk, Bajrang Baan and Tulsi Satsai.


===Ramcharitmanas===

&quot;Ramacharitamanas&quot; (रामचरितमानस, 1574–1576), &quot;The Mānasa lake brimming over with the exploits of Lord Rāma&quot; is an Awadhi rendering of the Ramayana narrative. It is the longest and earliest work of Tulsidas, and draws from various sources including the Ramayana of Valmiki, the Adhyatma Ramayana, the &quot;Prasannaraghava&quot; and Hanuman Nataka. The work consists of around 12,800 lines divided into 1073 stanzas, which are groups of Chaupais separated by Dohas or Sorthas. It is divided into seven books (Kands) like the Ramayana of Valmiki, and is around one-third of the size of Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana. The work is composed in 18 metres which include ten Sanskrit meters (&quot;Anushtup&quot;, &quot;Shardulvikridit&quot;, &quot;Vasantatilaka&quot;, &quot;Vamshashta&quot;, &quot;Upajati&quot;, &quot;Pramanika&quot;, &quot;Malini&quot;, &quot;Sragdhara&quot;, &quot;Rathoddhata&quot; and &quot;Bhujangaprayata&quot;) and eight Prakrit metres (&quot;Soratha&quot;, &quot;Doha&quot;, &quot;Chaupai&quot;, &quot;Harigitika&quot;, &quot;Tribhangi&quot;, &quot;Chaupaiya&quot;, &quot;Trotaka&quot; and &quot;Tomara&quot;). It is popularly referred to as &quot;Tulsikrit Ramayana&quot;, literally &quot;The Ramayana composed by Tulsidas&quot;. The work has been acclaimed as &quot;the living sum of Indian culture&quot;, &quot;the tallest tree in the magic garden of medieval Indian poesy&quot;, &quot;the greatest book of all devotional literature&quot;, &quot;the Bible of Northern India&quot;, and &quot;the best and most trustworthy guide to the popular living faith of its people.&quot; But, as he has said &quot;The story of the lord is endless as are his glories&quot; ().

Several manuscripts of the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; are claimed to have been written down by Tulsidas himself. Grierson noted that two copies of the epic were said to have existed in the poet&#x27;s own handwriting. One manuscript was kept at Rajapur, of which only the &quot;Ayodhyakand&quot; is left now, which bears watermarks. According to legend, the manuscript was stolen and thrown into Yamuna river. When the thief was being pursued, only the second book of the epic could be rescued. Grierson wrote that the other copy was at Malihabad in Lucknow district, of which only one leaf was missing. Another manuscript of the &quot;Ayodhyakanda&quot; claimed to be in the poet&#x27;s own hand exists at Soron in Kasganj district, one of the places claimed to be Tulsidas&#x27; birthplace. One manuscript of &quot;Balakanda&quot; is found in Ayodhya. It is dated back to Samvat 1661, and claimed to have been corrected by Tulsidas. Some other ancient manuscripts are found in Varanasi, including one in possession of the Maharaja of Benares that was written in Vikram 1704 (1647), twenty-four years after the death of Tulsidas.

===Other major works===

The five major works of Tulsidas apart from Ramcharitmanas include:
* &quot;Dohavali&quot; (दोहावली, 1581), literally &quot;Collection of Dohas&quot;, is a work consisting of 573 miscellaneous Doha and Sortha verses mainly in Braja with some verses in Awadhi. The verses are aphorisms on topics related to tact, political wisdom, righteousness and the purpose of life. 85 Dohas from this work are also found in the Ramcharitmanas, 35 in Ramagya Prashna, two in Vairagya Sandipani and some in &quot;Rama Satsai&quot;, another work of 700 Dohas attributed to Tulsidas.
* &quot;Sahitya ratna&quot; or &quot;ratna Ramayan&quot; (1608–1614), literally &quot;Collection of Kavittas&quot;, is a Braja rendering of the Ramayana, composed entirely in metres of the &quot;Kavitta&quot; family – Kavitta, Savaiya, Ghanakshari, and Chhappaya. It consists of 325 verses including 183 verses in the Uttarkand. Like the Ramcharitmanas, it is divided into seven Kands or books and many episodes in this work are different from the Ramcharitmanas.
* &quot;Gitavali&quot; (गीतावली), literally &quot;Collection of Songs&quot;, is a Braja rendering of the Ramayana in songs. All the verses are set to Ragas of Hindustani classical music and are suitable for singing. It consists of 328 songs divided into seven Kands or books. Many episodes of the Ramayana are elaborated while many others are abridged.
* &quot;Krishna Gitavali&quot; or &quot;Krishnavali&quot; (कृष्णगीतावली, 1607), literally &quot;Collection of Songs to Krishna&quot;, is a collection of 61 songs in honour of Krishna in Braja. There are 32 songs devoted to the childhood sports (&quot;Balalila&quot;) and Rasa Lila of Krishna, 27 songs form the dialogue between Krishna and Uddhava, and two songs describe the episode of disrobing of Draupadi.
* &quot;Vinaya Patrika&quot; (विनयपत्रिका), literally &quot;Petition of Humility&quot;, is a Braja work consisting of 279 stanzas or hymns. The stanzas form a petition in the court of Rama asking for Bhakti. It is considered to be the second best work of Tulsidas after the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;, and is regarded as important from the viewpoints of philosophy, erudition, and eulogistic and poetic style of Tulsidas. The first 43 hymns are addressed to various deities and Rama&#x27;s courtiers and attendants, and remaining are addressed to Rama.

===Minor works===
Minor works of Tulsidas include:
* &quot;Barvai Ramayana&quot; (बरवै रामायण, 1612), literally &quot;The Ramayana in Barvai metre&quot;, is an abridged rendering of the Ramayana in Awadhi. The works consists of 69 verses composed in the &quot;Barvai&quot; metre, and is divided into seven &quot;Kands&quot; or books. The work is based on a psychological framework.
* &quot;Parvati Mangal&quot; (पार्वती मंगल), literally &quot;The marriage of Parvati&quot;, is an Awadhi work of 164 verses describing the penance of Parvati and the marriage of Parvati and Shiva. It consists of 148 verses in the &quot;Sohar&quot; metre and 16 verses in the &quot;Harigitika&quot; metre.
* &quot;Janaki Mangal&quot; (जानकी मंगल), literally &quot;The marriage of Sita&quot;, is an Awadhi work of 216 verses describing the episode of marriage of Sita and Rama from the Ramayana. The work includes 192 verses in the &quot;Hamsagati&quot; metre and 24 verses in the &quot;Harigitika&quot; metres. The narrative differs from the Ramcharitmanas at several places.
* &quot;Ramalala Nahachhu&quot; (रामलला नहछू), literally &quot;The Nahachhu ceremony of the child Rama&quot;, is an Awadhi work of 20 verses composed in the &quot;Sohar&quot; metre. The Nahachhu ceremony involves cutting the nails of the feet before the Hindu Samskaras (rituals) of Chudakarana, Upanayana, Vedarambha, Samavartana or Vivaha. In the work, events take place in the city of Ayodhya, so it is considered to describe the Nahachhu before Upanayana, Vedarambha and Samavartana.
* &quot;Ramajna Prashna&quot; (रामाज्ञा प्रश्न), literally &quot;Querying the Will of Rama&quot;, is an Awadhi work related to both Ramayana and Jyotisha (astrology). It consists of seven &quot;Kand&quot;s or books, each of which is divided into seven &quot;Saptaka&quot;s or Septets of seven Dohas each. Thus it contains 343 Dohas in all. The work narrates the Ramayana non-sequentially, and gives a method to look up the Shakuna (omen or portent) for astrological predictions.
* &quot;Vairagya Sandipini&quot; (वैराग्य संदीपनी, 1612), literally &quot;Kindling of Detachment&quot;, is a philosophical work of 60 verses in Braja which describe the state of Jnana (realisation) and Vairagya (dispassion), the nature and greatness of saints, and moral conduct. It consists of 46 Dohas, 2 Sorathas and 12 Chaupai metres.

===Popularly attributed works===
The following four works are popularly attributed to Tulsidas–
* &quot;Hanuman Chalisa&quot; (हनुमान चालीसा), literally, &quot;Forty Verses to Hanuman,&quot; is a text that sings the glory of Hanuman. It is written in the Awadhi vernacular and composed of 40 &quot;chaupais&quot; and two &quot;dohas.&quot; Popular belief holds the work to be authored by Tulsidas, and it contains his signature, though some authors do not think the work was written by him. It is one of the most popularl read short religious texts in India, and is recited by millions of Hindus on Tuesdays and Saturdays. It is believed to have been uttered by Tulsidas in a state of Samadhi at the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. 
* &quot;Sankatmochan Hanumanashtak&quot; (संकटमोचन हनुमानाष्टक), literally &quot;Eight verses for Hanuman, the Remover of Afflictions&quot;, is an Awadhi work of eight verses in the &quot;Mattagajendra&quot; metre, devoted to Hanuman. It is believed to have been composed by Tulsidas on the occasion of the founding of the Sankatmochan Temple in Varanasi. The work is usually published along with &quot;Hanuman Chalisa&quot;.
* &quot;Hanuman Bahuka&quot; (हनुमान बाहुक), literally &quot;The Arm of Hanuman&quot;, is a Braja work of 44 verses believed to have been composed by Tulsidas when he suffered acute pain in his arms at an advanced age. Tulsidas describes the pain in his arms and also prays to Hanuman for freedom from the suffering. The work has two, one, five and 36 verses respectively in the &quot;Chhappaya&quot;, &quot;Jhulna&quot;, &quot;Savaiya&quot; and &quot;Ghanakshari&quot; metre.
* &quot;Tulsi Satsai&quot; (तुलसी सतसई), literally &quot;Seven Hundred Verses by Tulsidas&quot;, is a work in both Awadhi and Braja and contains 747 Dohas divided in seven &quot;Sarga&quot;s or cantos. The verses are same as those in &quot;Dohavali&quot; and &quot;Ramagya Prashna&quot; but the order is different.
Tulsidas mentioned about destruction of Ram Janmabhumi temple by Mir Baqi in his work &quot;Tulsi Doha Shatak&quot; (lit. Hundred couplets of Tulsi) and the same was quoted by Rambhadracharya during the proceedings of the Ayodhya dispute in the Allahabad High court that influenced its judgment in 2010.

==Doctrine==
The philosophy and principles of Tulsidas are found across his works, and are especially outlined in the dialogue between Kakbhushundi and Garuda in the Uttar Kand of the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;. Tulsidas&#x27; doctrine has been described as an assimilation and reconciliation of the diverse tenets and cultures of Hinduism. At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that his work is in accordance with various scriptures – the Puranas, Vedas, Upavedas, Tantra and Smriti. Ram Chandra Shukla in his critical work &quot;Hindi Sahitya Ka Itihaas&quot; elaborates on Tulsidas&#x27; &quot;Lokmangal&quot; as the doctrine for social upliftment which made this great poet immortal and comparable to any other world littérateur.

===Nirguna and Saguna Brahman===
As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with qualities) are one and the same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - unqualified Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, in existence since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – both of which have a form. Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;, Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu&#x27;s race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.

===The name of Rama===
At the beginning of the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that &quot;Rama&quot; is superior to all other names of God, and argues that &quot;ra&quot; and &quot;ma&quot; being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word &quot;Rama&quot;.

===Rama as Brahman===
At several places in Tulsidas&#x27; works, Rama is seen to be the higher than Vishnu and not as an avatar of Vishnu, which is the general portrayal of Rama.

In the episode of the delusion of Sati in &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;, Sati sees many a Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu serving Rama and bowing at his feet. When Manu and Shatarupa perform penance, they crave to see that Supreme Lord &quot;from a part of whose being emanate a number of Shivas, Brahmas and Vishnus.&quot; Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva come to them many times tempting them with a boon, but Manu and Shatarupa do not stop their penance. They are finally satisfied only by the appearance of Rama, on whose left side is Sita, from a part of whom are born &quot;countless Lakshmis, Umas (Parvatis) and Brahmanis (Sarasvatis).&quot; In the episode of marriage of Sita and Rama in Balkand, the trio of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva is present – Brahma is astounded as he finds nowhere anything that is his own handiwork, while Vishnu is enchanted with Lakhmi on seeing Rama. In the Sundarkand, Hanuman tells Ravana that Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva can create, preserve and destroy by the might of Rama. In the Lankakand, Tulsidas presents the universe as the cosmic form of Rama, in which Shiva is the consciousness, Brahma is the reason and Vishnu is his intelligence. As per Tulsidas, Rama is not only an avatar, but also the source of avatars – Krishna is also an Avatar of Rama. Thus, Tulsidas clearly considers Rama as supreme brahman and not an avatar of Vishnu.

In the opinion of Urvashi Soorati, the Rama of Tulsidas is an amalgamation of Vishnu who takes avatars, Vishnu in the abode of Ksheera Sagara, Brahman and the Para manifestation of the Pancharatra. Macfie concludes that Tulsidas makes a &quot;double claim&quot;, i.e. Rama is an incarnation of both Vishnu and Brahman. In the words of Lutgendorf, Tulsidas&#x27; Rama is at once &quot;Valmiki&#x27;s exemplary prince, the cosmic Vishnu of Puranas, and the transcendent brahman of the Advaitins.&quot;

===Vedanta, World and Maya===

In the Sundarkand of &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;, Tulsidas says that Rama is knowable by Vedanta.

As per Tulsidas, Rama is the efficient and material cause (&quot;Nimitta&quot; and &quot;Upadana&quot;) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;, Tulsidas says that the animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean that the world is real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; and &quot;Kavitavali&quot;, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is &quot;Mithya&quot; (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas&#x27; opinion the world is unreal as per the &quot;Vivartavada&quot; doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas&#x27; view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by &quot;Mithya&quot;.

In the Vinayapatrika, Tulsidas says that the world in itself is neither true (&quot;Satya&quot;), nor false (&quot;Asatya&quot;), nor both true and false together (&quot;Satyasatya&quot;) – one who casts aside all these three illusions, knows oneself. This has been interpreted to mean that as per Tulsidas, the entire world is a Lila of Rama. At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas performs Samasti Vandana (obeisance to all beings) in which he bows down to the world also, saying it is &quot;pervaded by&quot; or &quot;born out of&quot; Sita and Rama. As per some verses in Ramcharitmanas and Vinaypatrika, when a Jiva (living being) knows the self, Maya, and Rama, it sees the world as being pervaded by Rama.

In the Balkand episode of the marriage of the princes of Ayodhya with the princesses of Mithila, Tulsidas presents a metaphor in which the four brides are compared with the four states of consciousness – the waking state (&quot;Jagrat&quot;), sleep with dreams (&quot;Swapna&quot;), dreamless sleep (&quot;Sushupti&quot;) and the fourth self-conscious state (Turiya). The four grooms are compared with the presiding divinity (&quot;Vibhu&quot;) of the four states – &quot;Vishva&quot;, &quot;Taijasa&quot;, &quot;Prajna&quot; and &quot;Brahman&quot;. Tulsidas says as the four states of consciousness with their presiding divinities reside in the mind of a Jiva, so the four brides with their grooms are resplendent in the same pavilion.

Tulsidas identifies Maya with Sita, the inseparable energy of Rama which takes avatar along with Rama. In his view, Maya is of two types – Vidya and Avidya. &quot;Vidya Maya&quot; is the cause of creation and the liberation of Jiva. Avidya Maya is the cause of illusion and bondage of the Jiva. The entire world is under the control of Maya. Maya is essentially the same but the two divisions are made for cognitive purposes, this view of Tulsidas is in accordance with Vaishnava teachers of Vedanta.

===Views on other Hindu deities===

As per Tulsidas, there is no incompatibility between devotion to Rama and attachment to Shiva. Tulsidas equates the Guru as an incarnation of Shiva, and a considerable part of the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas is devoted to the narrative of Shiva including the abandonment of Sati, the penance of Parvati, the burning of Kamadeva and the marriage of Parvati and Shiva. In addition, Tulsidas venerates the whole Hindu pantheon. The Ramcharitmanas begins with reverence of Ganesh, Sarasvati, Parvati, Shiva, the Guru, Valmiki and Hanuman. At the beginning of the Vinayapatrika, he bows to Ganesh, Surya, Shiva, Devi, Ganga, Yamuna, Varanasi and Chitrakoot, asking them for devotion towards Rama.

===Bhakti===
The practical end of all his writings is to inculcate bhakti addressed to Rama as the greatest means of salvation and emancipation from the chain of births and deaths, a salvation which is as free and open to men of the lowest caste.

==Critical reception==

From his time, Tulsidas has been acclaimed by Indian and Western scholars alike for his poetry and his impact on the Hindu society. Tulsidas mentions in his work Kavitavali that he was considered a &quot;great sage&quot; in the world. Madhusūdana Sarasvatī, one of the most acclaimed philosophers of the Advaita Vedanta tradition based in Varanasi and the composer of &quot;Advaitasiddhi&quot;, was a contemporary of Tulsidas. On reading the Ramcharitmanas, he was astonished and composed the following Sanskrit verse in praise of the epic and the composer.


आनन्दकानने कश्चिज्जङ्गमस्तुल्सीतरुः ।
कविता मञ्जरी यस्य रामभ्रमरभूषिता ॥

ānandakānane kaścijjaṅgamastulsītaruḥ ।
kavitā mañjarī yasya rāmabhramarabhūṣitā ॥


Sur, a devotee of Krishna and a contemporary of Tulsidas, called Tulsidas as &quot;Sant Shiromani&quot; (the highest jewel among holy men) in an eight-line verse extolling &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; and Tulsidas. Abdur Rahim Khankhana, famous Muslim poet who was one of the Navaratnas (nine-gems) in the court of the Mughal emperor Akbar, was a personal friend of Tulsidas. Rahim composed the following couplet describing the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; of Tulsidas –


रामचरितमानस बिमल संतनजीवन प्रान । 
हिन्दुवान को बेद सम जवनहिं प्रगट कुरान ॥ 

rāmacaritamānasa bimala santanajīvana prāna । 
hinduvāna ko beda sama javanahi̐ pragaṭa kurāna ॥ 


The historian Vincent Smith, the author of a biography of Tulsidas&#x27; contemporary Akbar, called Tulsidas &quot;the greatest man of his age in India and greater than even Akbar himself&quot;. The Indologist and linguist Sir George Grierson called Tulsidas &quot;the greatest leader of the people after the Buddha&quot; and &quot;the greatest of Indian authors of modern times&quot;; and the epic Ramcharitmanas &quot;worthy of the greatest poet of any age.&quot; The work Ramcharitmanas has been called &quot;the Bible of North India&quot; by both nineteenth century Indologists including Ralph Griffith, who translated the four Vedas and Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana into English, and modern writers. Mahatma Gandhi held Tulsidas in high esteem and regarded the Ramcharitmanas as the &quot;greatest book in all devotional literature&quot;. The Hindi poet Suryakant Tripathi &#x27;Nirala&#x27; called Tulsidas &quot;the most fragrant branch of flowers in the garden of the world&#x27;s poetry, blossoming in the creeper of Hindi&quot;. Nirala considered Tulsidas to be a greater poet than Rabindranath Tagore, and in the same league as Kalidasa, Vyasa, Valmiki, Homer, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and William Shakespeare. Hindi litterateur Hazari Prasad Dwivedi wrote that Tulsidas established a &quot;sovereign rule on the kingdom of Dharma in northern India&quot;, which was comparable to the impact of Buddha. Edmour J. Babineau, author of the book &quot;Love and God and Social Duty in Ramacaritmanasa&quot;, says that if Tulsidas was born in Europe or the Americas, he would be considered a greater personality than William Shakespeare. In the words of the archaeologist F. R. Allchin, who translated Vinaypatrika and Kavitavali into English, &quot;for people of a large part of North India Tulsidas claims reverence comparable to that accorded to Luther as translator of the Bible into the native German&quot;. Allchin also mentions that the work Ramcharitmanas has been compared to not only the Ramayana of Valmiki, but the Vedas themselves, the Bhagavad Gita, the Quran and the Bible. Ernest Wood in his work &quot;An Englishman Defends Mother India&quot; considered the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; to be &quot;superior to the best books of the Latin and Greek languages.&quot; Tulsidas is also referred to as &quot;Bhaktaśiromaṇi&quot;, meaning the highest jewel among devotees.

Specifically about his poetry, Tulsidas has been called the &quot;emperor of the metaphor&quot; and one who excels in similes by several critics. The Hindi poet Ayodhyasingh Upadhyay &#x27;Hariaudh&#x27; said of Tulsidas –


कविता करके तुलसी न लसे 
कविता लसी पा तुलसी की कला । 

kavitā karake tulasī na lase 
kavitā lasī pā tulasī kī kalā । 


The Hindi poet Mahadevi Varma said commenting on Tulsidas that in the turbulent Middle Ages, India received enlightenment from Tulsidas. She further went on to say that the Indian society as it exists today is an edifice built by Tulsidas, and the Rama as we know today is the Rama of Tulsidas.

<text>Surdas was a 16th-century blind Hindu devotional poet and singer, who was known for his works written in praise of Krishna. His compositions captured his devotion towards Krishna. Most of his poems were written in the Braj language, while some were also written in other dialects of medieval Hindi, like Awadhi.

Sūrdās&#x27;s biography is most often told through the lens of the Vallabha Sampradāya aka the Puṣṭimārga. The Puṣṭimārga regards Sūrdās as an initiated disciple of Vallabha, and his hagiography is told in the &quot;Caurāsī Vaiṣṇavan kī Vārtā&quot; by Gokulnāth and Harirāy. Sūrdās&#x27; poems, along with those of other Aṣṭachāp poets, form a central part of Puṣṭimārga liturgical singing-worship. However modern scholars consider the connection between Sūrdās and Vallabha and his sect to be ahistorical.

The book &quot;Sur Sagar&quot; (Sur&#x27;s Ocean) is traditionally attributed to Surdas. However, many of the poems in the book seem to be written by later poets in Sur&#x27;s name. The Sur Sagar in its present form focuses on descriptions of Krishna as the lovely child of Gokul and Vraj, written from the &quot;gopis&quot;&#x27; perspective.

==Life and work ==

&quot;The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature&quot; suggests a birth year of 1258 into a Brahmin family of Uttar Pradesh.&quot;&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica states that his lifespan is &quot;traditionally&quot; given as 1483-1563. Sources state he was either a Sārasvata Brāhmaṇa, a Jāṭa, or a Ḍhāṛhī.

Surdas, whose name translates to &quot;servant of the sun&quot;, is celebrated as the pinnacle of poetic artistry in Braj bhasha. This language is linked to the Braj region, where Krishna is said to have spent his childhood. The hagiographer Nabha Dass, in his Bhaktamal, praised Surdas for his poetic skill, especially in depicting &quot;Hari&#x27;s playful acts&quot;, a reference to Krishna&#x27;s divine activities. Surdas also composed poems about Ram and Sita but primarily focused on Krishna&#x27;s life and deeds.

===Poetry ===
Surdas&#x27;s poetry was written in a dialect of Hindi called Braj Bhasha, until then considered to be a very plebeian language, as the prevalent literary languages were either Persian or Sanskrit. His work raised the status of the Braj Bhasha from a crude language to that of a literary one. 

Surdas&#x27;s poems are collectively known as the &quot;Sursagar&quot; or &quot;Ocean of Sur&quot; due to a large volume of poems attributed to his name. The traditional format of the Sursagar is divided into twelve parts, similar to the Hindu scripture, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;. Just as the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; describes the life and actions of Krishna, the Sursagar also takes on a similar feat with a majority of its poems dedicated to Krishna. Many of the poems found in Sursagar are &quot;pads,&quot; containing six to ten rhymed verses. Other subject matter covered include Rama and Sita, Vishnu, Shiva, heroes within Hinduism like Gajendra and King Bali, and the poet&#x27;s spiritual struggles. 

==Philosophy==
Eight disciples of Vallabha Acharya are called the &quot;Aṣṭachāp&quot;, (Eight seals in Hindi), named after the oral signature &quot;chap&quot; written at the conclusion of literary works. Sur is considered to be the foremost among them.

==Coverage==
Several films have been made about the poet&#x27;s life. These include: &quot;Surdas&quot; (1939) by Krishna Dev Mehra, &quot;Bhakta Surdas&quot; (1942) by Chaturbhuj Doshi, &quot;Sant Surdas&quot; (1975) by Ravindra Dave, &quot;Chintamani Surdas&quot; (1988) by Ram Pahwa.

The legend of the blind poet Bilwamangala (identified with Surdas) and Chintamani has also been adapted several times in Indian cinema. These films include: &quot;Bilwamangal&quot; or &quot;Bhagat Soordas&quot; (1919) by Rustomji Dhotiwala, &quot;Bilwamangal&quot; (1932), &quot;Chintamani&quot; (1933) by Kallakuri Sadasiva Rao, &quot;Chintamani&quot; (1937) by Y. V. Rao, &quot;Bhakta Bilwamangal&quot; (1948) by Shanti Kumar, &quot;Bilwamangal&quot; (1954) by D. N. Madhok, &quot;Bhakta Bilwamangal&quot; (1954) by Pinaki Bhushan Mukherji, &quot;Chintamani&quot; (1956) by P. S. Ramakrishna Rao, &quot;Chintamani&quot; (1957) by M.N. Basavarajaiah, &quot;Chilamboli&quot; (1963) by G. K. Ramu, &quot;Bilwamangal&quot; (1976) by Gobinda Roy, &quot;Vilvamangal Ki Pratigya&quot; (1996) by Sanjay Virmani.

<doc id="519091" wikidata="Q4678994" url="?curid=519091" title="Adiantum capillus-veneris">
<text>Adiantum capillus-veneris, the Southern maidenhair fern, black maidenhair fern, maidenhair fern, and venus hair fern, is a species of ferns in the genus &quot;Adiantum&quot; and the family Pteridaceae with a subcosmopolitan worldwide distribution. It is cultivated as a popular garden fern and houseplant.

==Distribution==
&quot;Adiantum capillus-veneris&quot; is native to the southern half of the United States from California to the Atlantic coast, through Mexico and Central America, to South America. It is also native to Eurasia, the Levant in Western Asia, and Australasia. There are two disjunct occurrences in the northern part of North America: at Cascade Springs in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Fairmont Hot Springs, British Columbia. In both instances, the warm microclimate created by hot mineral springs permits the growth of the plant far north of its normal range. It is similar in Zvonce spa resort (Звоначка Бања, Zvonačka Banja), near Pirot in Serbia, where hot mineral springs provide adequate heat and humidity for the survival of this species.

It is found in temperate climates from warm-temperate to tropical, where the moisture content is high but not saturating, in the moist, well-drained sand, loam or limestone of many habitats, including rainforests, shrub and woodlands, broadleaf and coniferous forests, and desert cliff seeps, and springs. It often may be seen growing on moist, sheltered and shaded sandstone or limestone formations, generally south-facing in the southern hemisphere, north-facing in the north, or in gorges. It occurs throughout Africa in moist places by streams. On moist sandstone cliffs it grows in full or partial shade, even when unprotected.


==Description==
&quot;Adiantum capillus-veneris&quot; grows from in height; its fronds arising in clusters from creeping rhizomes tall, with very delicate, light green fronds much subdivided into pinnae long and broad; the frond rachis is black and wiry.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Adiantum capillus-veneris&quot; is cultivated and widely available around the world for planting in natural landscape native plants and traditional shade gardens, for outdoor container gardens, and commonly as an indoor houseplant.

&quot;Adiantum × mairisii&quot; is a winter hardy hybrid of &quot;Adiantum capillus-veneris&quot; with another species, which is likely to be one of &quot;Adiantum raddianum&quot;, &quot;Adiantum aethiopicum&quot;, or &quot;Adiantum cuneatum&quot;.

As a houseplant, &quot;Adiantum capillus-veneris&quot; requires filtered light and very humid conditions. It should be grown in soil rich in organic matter and should be watered frequently but lightly, to keep the roots damp but not drenched. The temperature should not fall below . It is propagated by dividing, making sure each clump has a section of rhizome.

==Conservation==
The fern is listed as an endangered species in North Carolina (as southern maidenhair-fern) and threatened species in Kentucky (as venus hair fern), due to loss of Appalachian habitat.

==Traditional uses==
This plant is used medicinally by Native Americans. The Mahuna people use the plant internally for rheumatism, and the Navajo people of Kayenta, Arizona use an infusion of the plant as a lotion for bumblebee and centipede stings. The Navajo people also smoke it or take it internally to treat mental illness.

In the traditional medicine of Iran, frond infusion of &quot;Adiantum capillus-veneris&quot; is used for jaundice therapy. Along with this, they have a wide range of medicinal uses and have been used to treat coughs, cold, and to aid in kidney function.

<text>Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, or simply Cedar Fair, was an American company headquartered at its flagship Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. The company was a publicly traded master limited partnership that originally formed in 1983 following Cedar Point&#x27;s acquisition of Valleyfair, in which the name of both parks were combined to form the name &quot;Cedar Fair&quot;. By 2006, the company&#x27;s portfolio had grown to eleven amusement parks, eleven outdoor water parks, and one indoor water park in the US and Canada. The acquisition of Schlitterbahn added two more outdoor water parks in 2019.

Cedar Fair and longtime rival Six Flags merged on July 1, 2024, forming a new company and retaining the Six Flags name. Announced in November 2023 as a merger of equals, former Cedar Fair leadership remained in control of the new company, along with two former Six Flags executives. The company&#x27;s headquarters will reside in Charlotte, North Carolina, a site once occupied by Paramount Parks before its acquisition by Cedar Fair in 2006, while the company will continue to use its Sandusky office location for financial and administrative operations.

==History==
Cedar Point Amusement Park began as a bathing beach resort in the 1870s, and its growing popularity as a recreational destination led to the formation of Cedar Point Pleasure Resort Company in 1887. The company was founded with the purpose of expanding the resort commercially. An economic depression in the 1890s threatened the resort&#x27;s future, however. A newly formed business, Cedar Point Pleasure Resort Company of Indiana led by George Arthur Boeckling, purchased Cedar Point for $256,000 in 1897. It was later reorganized as the G.A. Boeckling Company.

The resort thrived under Boeckling&#x27;s leadership, which lasted through 1931. G.A. Boeckling Company continued to control operations at the amusement park for much of the 20th century. A proposal in 1974 to build an amusement park in Cambridge Township, Michigan, was contemplated and later abandoned the following year. Then in 1978, Cedar Point acquired Valleyfair amusement park. Parent company Cedar Fair Limited Partnership, commonly known as Cedar Fair, was formed in 1983. Its name was derived from both parks – &quot;Cedar&quot; representing Cedar Point and &quot;Fair&quot; representing Valleyfair. The company went public on April 29, 1987. Under Cedar Fair&#x27;s leadership, Cedar Point grew to become one of the largest amusement parks in the world, and the company increased its portfolio by acquiring other amusement properties throughout the United States.

===Dick Kinzel era===
The first acquisition of the new Cedar Fair company came in 1992 when Cedar Fair bought Dorney Park from Harris Weinstein. Cedar Fair also bought Worlds of Fun from Hunt-Midwest in 1995. One of the biggest acquisitions came in 1997 when Cedar Fair bought Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm from the Knott family. This marked the first time Cedar Fair operated a year-round amusement park. The acquisition included operations of the Camp Snoopy indoor park at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. In 2005, Cedar Fair withdrew from the lease arrangement leaving Mall of America to manage the park on its own. Mall of America formed a partnership with the Nickelodeon franchise in 2007 and continues to operate under the name Nickelodeon Universe. Several new water park properties named Knott&#x27;s Soak City opened around the southern California area since the acquisition which included Buena Park in 1999, Chula Vista in 2000 and Palm Springs in 2001. Michigan&#x27;s Adventure in Muskegon, Michigan was purchased for $27.6 million in 2001.

Cedar Fair opened its first indoor water park in November 2004, Castaway Bay. It was added to the former Radisson Hotel which was then renamed. The indoor waterpark resort is open year-round.

Larger acquisitions followed in 2004 with Six Flags Worlds of Adventure. Cedar Fair purchased the park for $145 million, reverting its name to Geauga Lake, as it was before its Six Flags branding in 2000. Subsequently, Cedar Fair stripped the park of all references to Looney Tunes and DC Comics characters which were licensed properties owned by Six Flags. The zoological and marine life portion of the complex (SeaWorld Ohio), which was annexed to the theme park in 2001, was also shuttered. Six Flags retained ownership of the animals. The amusement park remained in Cedar Fair&#x27;s portfolio through 2007, and the water park continued to operate as Wildwater Kingdom through 2016.

On May 22, 2006, Cedar Fair announced it had outbid competitors and intended to purchase all five parks in the Paramount Parks chain, including Star Trek: The Experience at the Las Vegas Hilton and the management agreement of Bonfante Gardens (now known as Gilroy Gardens). On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair announced that it had completed its acquisition of Paramount Parks from CBS Corporation in a cash transaction valued at US$1.24 billion. Shortly following the transfer of ownership, Cedar Fair began the process of integrating the two companies. With the purchase of the Paramount Parks, Cedar Fair LP announced that it would do business under the name Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Cedar Fair LP remains the legal company name.
The individual parks continued to operate under their Paramount names during the 2006 season, however Cedar Fair began removing the Paramount name and logo from the parks in January 2007. The names of the parks were changed back to their original pre-Paramount names (the Paramount&#x27;s prefix was removed) with the Cedar Fair corporate logo added. Bonfante Gardens was changed to Gilroy Gardens. Cedar Fair began removing references to Paramount Pictures. Although the acquisition granted Cedar Fair a ten-year licensing deal for Paramount names and icons, such as Star Trek, Cedar Fair opted to terminate the agreement and not pay an annual licensing fee. All references to Paramount/CBS-licensed properties were removed before the beginning of the 2008 season. This deal also included a four-year licensing deal for Nickelodeon names and icons, such as SpongeBob SquarePants and Rugrats, this agreement was retained until it expired prior to the 2010 season.

In December 2009, it was announced that Apollo Global Management would offer Cedar Fair $11.50 per share, a 28 percent premium over the market price, as part of a takeover plan which would also make Cedar Fair a private company. The deal included a cash payment of $635 million in addition to assuming Cedar Fair&#x27;s debt of over US$1.7 billion putting the total value of the transaction close to US$2.4 billion. Cedar Fair planned to hold a shareholder meeting on March 16, 2010, to vote on the transaction but postponed the meeting to April 8, 2010, implying that two-thirds of the shareholder vote needed for approval wasn&#x27;t yet secured. On April 6, 2010, the deal was terminated, and Cedar Fair paid $6.5 million to reimburse Apollo for expenses incurred from the proposed transaction. Cedar Fair also adopted a unitholder rights plan as a preventative measure to help protect unitholders in the event of any future hostile takeover.

On September 16, 2011, JMA Ventures, LLC entered into an agreement to purchase California&#x27;s Great America from Cedar Fair and take ownership of the Gilroy Gardens management contract. The agreement required approval of Santa Clara&#x27;s city council which was scheduled to vote on the matter on December 6, 2011. However, JMA canceled its plans to purchase Great America and bowed out of the agreement.

===Matt Ouimet era===
On June 20, 2011, Cedar Fair announced that long term CEO Dick Kinzel would retire on January 3, 2012, and that Matt Ouimet would take his spot as the CEO of Cedar Fair. Ouimet had been employed by The Walt Disney Company for 17 years, including serving as president of Disney Cruise Line and president of the Disneyland Resort. He officially became CEO on January 3. Cedar Fair launched new websites for their parks in 2012 as well as a new marketing campaign, &quot;Thrills Connect&quot;.

On November 20, 2012, Cedar Fair announced it had sold its &quot;Knott&#x27;s Soak City: San Diego&quot; location to SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment. About nine months later, Cedar Fair announced it had sold its &quot;Knott&#x27;s Soak City: Palm Springs&quot; location to CNL Lifestyle Properties. Cedar Fair&#x27;s portfolio, according to an SEC report filed in 2013, contained eleven amusement parks, four outdoor water parks, one indoor water park, and five hotels.

On September 5, 2016, Cedar Fair closed Wildwater Kingdom, the last operating part of the former Geauga Lake &amp; Wildwater Kingdom. A portion of the land that once contained both properties has since been redeveloped.

===Richard Zimmerman era===
On October 4, 2017, Cedar Fair announced that Ouimet would step down as CEO and be succeeded by COO Richard Zimmerman on January 1, 2018. Ouimet would remain with the company, taking the newly created position of executive chairman of the board of directors.

On March 27, 2019, Cedar Fair announced it was purchasing the land occupied by California&#x27;s Great America from the City of Santa Clara. The 112 acres beneath the park cost $150 million. Cedar Fair had been previously leasing the land from the County of Santa Clara for 6 to 7 million per year.

In April 2019, Cedar Fair announced a partnership with Feld Entertainment to bring a Monster Jam Thunder Alley Area to select Cedar Fair parks.

On June 13, 2019, it was announced that Cedar Fair had signed a $261 million deal with Schlitterbahn Waterparks and Resorts to buy their Galveston and New Braunfels locations, with the option to buy Schlitterbahn Kansas City for an additional $6 million, and the rights to the Schlitterbahn name.

On July 2, 2019, it was announced that Cedar Fair had acquired the Sawmill Creek Resort in Huron, Ohio. The property cost $13.5 million.

In October 2019, Six Flags offered to buy Cedar Fair for $4 billion, however the offer was turned down.

On July 29, 2021, Cedar Fair announced the submission of plans to the City of Sandusky to build a $28 million esports arena expansion of the Cedar Fair Sports Center. Targeted opening in the first half of 2023 

On December 31, 2021, the contract to manage Gilroy Gardens expired. Both Gilroy Gardens Inc., the nonprofit that owns the park, and Cedar Fair agreed not to renew the contract.

On February 1, 2022, news broke that SeaWorld Entertainment made an unsolicited all-cash bid to buy Cedar Fair for $3.4 billion. Exactly two weeks later, on February 15, 2022, United Parks &amp; Resorts issued a statement that the offer had been rejected.

In June 2022, the company announced that it was selling the land occupied by California&#x27;s Great America to Prologis, a real estate development company, for $310 million. Cedar Fair signed an 11-year lease from the buyer and intends to close the park at the conclusion of the lease.

On November 2, 2023, Cedar Fair announced plans to merge with Six Flags, forming a new company and retaining the Six Flags name. Described as a &quot;merger of equals&quot;, former Cedar Fair management will remain in control of the new company, which will be headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, a site once occupied by Paramount Parks before being acquired by Cedar Fair in 2006. Some financial and administrative operations will continue to reside in Sandusky, Ohio. The combined company was projected to have 27 amusement parks, 15 water parks, and 9 resort properties in its portfolio and would operate under the Six Flags name with plans to use Cedar Fair&#x27;s stock exchange ticker symbol, FUN. President and CEO of Cedar Fair, Richard Zimmerman, will serve as President and CEO of the new combined company, while Selim Bassoul, President and CEO of Six Flags, would become the executive chairman of the company&#x27;s board of directors. On July 1, 2024, the merger was successfully completed.

==Fast Lane==

Fast Lane is an expedited queue system in use at parks formerly associated with Cedar Fair. It was first announced for Kings Island on July 18, 2011. The park served as the testing park for the system. For an increased cost, visitors get a wrist band which gives them the ability to wait in a shorter queue for most attractions. Originally, it could only be used from noon to 7:00 PM, but it was soon expanded to be available all day. Fast Lane would be rolled out to all Cedar Fair parks for the 2012 season. There is also Fright Lane, which is Fast Lane for the haunted attractions during the Halloween events. For the 2016 season, Cedar Fair began testing all season Fast Lane at Valleyfair and Dorney Park. By the 2019 season, all parks offered all season Fast Lane.

<doc id="519104" wikidata="Q461843" url="?curid=519104" title="USS Essex (1799)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Essex of the [[United States Navy]] was a 36-gun or 32-gun [[sailing frigate]] that participated in the [[Quasi-War]] with France, the [[First Barbary War]], and in the [[War of 1812]]. The British captured her in 1814 and she then served asHMS &quot;Essex until sold at public auction on 6 June 1837.

==Service history==

The frigate was built by Enos Briggs, Salem, Massachusetts, at a cost of $139,362 subscribed by the people of Salem and Essex County, to a design by James Hackett. &quot;Essex&quot; was armed with mostly short-range carronades that could not hope to match the range of 18- and 24-pounder naval guns. She was launched on 30 September 1799. On 17 December 1799 she was presented to the United States Navy and accepted by Captain Edward Preble.

Quasi War: On 22 December she departed Salem, Massachusetts for Newport, Rhode Island. On 28 December she joined USS Congress at Newport. On 6 January 1800, &quot;Essex&quot;, under the command of Captain Preble, departed Newport, Rhode Island, in company with to escort a convoy of merchant ships to Batavia, Dutch East Indies. &quot;Congress&quot; was dismasted only a few days out, &quot;Essex&quot; was obliged to continue her voyage alone. Sometime in early-mid February, &quot;Essex&quot; became the first US Naval ship to cross the Equator, being 16 deg. south of the Equator by the 14th. On 11 March she sighted the Cape of Good Hope and anchored at Cape Town. Due to poor quality of masts and rigging, similar to those problems suffered by USS Congress, she spent a week effecting repairs. On 24 March a heavy gale hit Cape Town capsizing and sinking her launch, the crew was saved with difficulty by &#x27;s barge. She departed Cape Town 28 March. She was the first US man-of-war to double the Cape of Good Hope, both in March and in August 1800 prior to successfully completing her convoy mission in November. On 6 May, 1800 she encountered a former American ship that had been captured, condemned for sale in Court and had a French Captain who claimed the ship was now Dutch owned. The next day Essex took control of the ship and entered the Sunda Strait. On 16 May she arrived at Batavia, Dutch East Indies. On 16 June she departed Batavia escorting a convoy back to the U. S. After spending a few days in Mew Bay, Java she departed the Sunda Strait on 1 July. She passed the Cape of Good Hope on 27 August. On 10 September she arrived at Saint Helena Island (). St. Helena was the designated rendezvous point for her convoy of returning merchant ships if they got scattered in storms rounding Cape Horn, which they had. All were accounted for by 26 September and they departed. On 11 October they passed St. Paul&#x27;s Rocks. Returned to New York City 28 November, mooring the next day.

===First Barbary War===
She departed New York City for Hampton Roads before 14 May to rendezvous with the squadron. On the same day the Bashaw of Tripoli declared War on the United States.
Captain William Bainbridge commanded &quot;Essex&quot; on her second cruise, receiving command from Capt. Preble on 29 May, 1801, whereon she sailed for the Mediterranean with the squadron of Commodore Richard Dale clearing the Cape on 2 June. Dispatched to protect American trade and seamen against depredations by the Barbary pirates, the squadron arrived at Gibraltar on 1 July 1801. She departed Gibraltar on 4 July escorting merchantmen &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Grand Turk&quot;, Grand Turk transporting U.S. Government gifts to the Bey of Tunis. She spent the ensuing year convoying American merchantmen and blockading Tripolitan ships in their ports. She departed Gibraltar for the U. S. on 16 June, 1802. Arriving off Sandy Hook on 23 July she received Orders to proceed to Washington, she went on to New York for provisions. While there, on 25 July a near mutiny occurred among the crew who wanted to get off at New York instead of going to Washington, 18 crew were put in irons. Departed New York 29 July. She returned to Washington, D. C. 9 or 10 August, 1802 and was placed &quot;in ordinary&quot;. Following repairs at the Washington Navy Yard in 1802 she was placed in ordinary. Captain James Barron was ordered to take command in a letter dated 11 April, 1804 from the Secretary of the Navy. She arrived at Hampton Roads on 14 June. She participated in the Battle of Derne on 27 April 1805, and remained in those waters until the conclusion of peace terms in 1806.

Returning to the Washington Navy Yard in July, she was placed in ordinary until February 1809, when she was recommissioned for sporadic use in patrolling American waters and a single cruise to Europe.

===War of 1812===
When war was declared against Britain on 18 June 1812, &quot;Essex&quot;, commanded by Captain David Porter, made a successful cruise to the southward. On 11 July near Bermuda she fell in with seven British transports (&quot;Silverside&quot; being one) and by moonlight engaged and took one of them as a prize. On 13 August she encountered and captured the sloop after an engagement. By September, when she returned to New York, &quot;Essex&quot; had taken ten prizes. The youngest member of the &quot;Essex&quot; crew was 10-year-old midshipman David Glasgow Farragut, who would become the first admiral of the US Navy. Farragut, who was Captain Porter&#x27;s foster son, remained with the ship for the next two years.
&quot;Essex&quot; sailed in South Atlantic waters and along the coast of Brazil until January 1813. On 11 December 1812 she captured the Post Office Packet Service packet as &quot;Nocton&quot; was returning to England from Rio de Janeiro. The Americans removed the specie that she was carrying (about £16,000) and some of her crew.

&quot;Essex&quot; then sailed to the Pacific where she decimated the British whaling fleet there. Although her crew suffered greatly from a shortage of provisions and heavy gales while rounding Cape Horn, she anchored safely at Valparaíso, Chile, on 14 March, having seized the whaling schooner &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, and the Peruvian man-of-war &quot;Nereyda&quot; along the way. &quot;Nereyda&quot; had captured two American whalers, &quot;Walker&quot; and &quot;Barclay&quot;, only to have the British whaler and privateer &quot;Nimrod&quot; take &quot;Walker&quot;. &quot;Nereyda&quot; had sent &quot;Barclay&quot; to Callao, where Porter was able to capture her before she could enter port. He sent a disarmed &quot;Nereyda&quot; back to the Peruvian authorities as a gesture of good will. He searched for &quot;Nimrod&quot; and &quot;Walker&quot;, but was unable to find them. At Valparaiso &quot;Essex&quot; landed the crew members that she had taken off &quot;Nocton&quot;.

In the next five months, &quot;Essex&quot; captured thirteen British whalers, including , (ex-&quot;Atlantic&quot;) which cruised in company with her captor; Porter put his executive officer, John Downes, in command of &quot;Essex Junior&quot;. The two ships and nine of their prizes put in at the island of Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands on 25 October 1813 for repairs. While they were there, their crews became involved in a local dispute that resulted in the Nuku Hiva Campaign, which temporarily established the United States&#x27; first colony and naval base in the Pacific Ocean. &quot;Essex&quot; and &quot;Essex Junior&quot; departed Nuku Hiva in mid-December 1813.

In January 1814, &quot;Essex&quot; sailed into neutral waters at Valparaíso, only to be trapped there for six weeks by the British frigate (36 guns), under Captain James Hillyar, and the sloop-of-war (18 guns) commanded by Thomas Tucker. On 28 March 1814, Porter determined to gain the open sea, fearing the arrival of British reinforcements. Upon rounding the point, &quot;Essex&quot; lost her main top-mast to foul weather and was brought to action just north of Valparaíso. 

Despite Porter&#x27;s complaints to the US Navy on several occasions, &quot;Essex&quot; was armed almost entirely with powerful but short-range 32-pounder carronades that gave &quot;Phoebe&quot;, armed with long 18-pounders, a decisive advantage at long range. For hours, &quot;Phoebe&quot; and &quot;Cherub&quot; bombarded &quot;Essex&quot; from long range, where &quot;Essex&quot; could only resist with her few long 12-pounders. Fires twice erupted aboard &quot;Essex&quot;, at which point about fifty men abandoned the ship and swam for shore, only half of them landing; the British saved sixteen. Eventually, the hopeless situation forced Porter to surrender. &quot;Essex&quot; had suffered 58 dead and 31 missing of her crew of 214. The British lost four men dead and seven wounded on &quot;Phoebe&quot;, and one dead and three wounded on &quot;Cherub&quot;.

The then Lieutenant William Bolton Finch was said to have served with distinction on the &quot;Essex&quot; between 1812 and 1814.

==British service and fate==
Because &quot;Essex&quot; was stored and provisioned for six months, and capable of sailing to Europe without &quot;the slightest cause for alarm&quot;, Captain Hillyar placed Lieutenant C. Pearson in command of her for the voyage to England, supported by acting lieutenant Allen Francis Gardiner. &quot;Essex&quot; arrived in England in November. There, the Admiralty had her repaired and taken into the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Essex&quot;.

The Royal Navy never fitted her for sea, but re-classed her as a 42-gun ship. She served as a troopship on 7 July 1819. She was hulked at Cork to serve as a prison ship in Ireland in October 1823, and between 1824 and 1834 served in this capacity at Kingstown. On 6 June 1837 she was sold at public auction for £1,230.

During early 21st century resurfacing work on the east pier of Dún Laoghaire harbour, &quot;Essex&quot;″s permanent mooring anchor was discovered embedded in the pier.

==In literature and popular culture==
Herman Melville wrote about &quot;Essex&quot; in &quot;Sketch Fifth&quot; in &quot;The Encantadas&quot;, focusing on an incident off the Galápagos Islands with an elusive British ship. The story was first published in 1854 in &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

Patrick O&#x27;Brian adapted the story of &quot;Essex&quot;″s attack on British whalers for his novel &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;.

The 1950 American film &quot;Tripoli&quot; is a fictionalized account of the Battle of Derne, and USS &quot;Essex&quot; is shown in it.

<doc id="519105" wikidata="Q38084" url="?curid=519105" title="German Shorthaired Pointer">
<text>The German Shorthaired Pointer or is a German breed of continental pointing dog of Braque type. It originated in the nineteenth century in what is now Germany. It is of medium size, and is an all-purpose gun dog suitable for hunting and retrieving on both land and water. It may also be kept as a companion dog.

== History ==
The pointing dog breeds of Europe all derive from the now-extinct Old Spanish Pointer, which spread through France and the Low Countries and reached the princely houses of the German-speaking world, where at first they were used in bird-hunting with nets or falcons, and later by huntsmen with guns. Bird dogs were also brought from England; , in his &quot;Aufrichtiger Lehrprinz&quot; of 1751, describes these as taller and stronger than the local type. In the nineteenth century large numbers of dogs of Burgos Pointing Dog type were brought to Germany. In the early part of that century the resulting mixed population had no specific name – the dogs were called (&#x27;bird dogs&#x27;) or (&#x27;hunting dogs&#x27;).

In 1878, at the annual dog show of the in Frankfurt am Main, it was agreed that breed standards for German dogs would be established at the show to be held in Hannover in 1879; standards for both the Deutsch Kurzhaar and the Deutsch Langhaar were introduced in that year. The first stud-book for the Kurzhaar was published in 1897.

The Kurzhaar was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1954. In 2013 it was in twenty-second place on a list of the most-registered dog breeds world-wide. In the fifteen years from 2007 to 2021, the annual number of new registrations in Germany averaged about , with a low of and a high of .

It was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1930; a three-year-old dog of this breed was classed &quot;best in show&quot; at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 2016.

== Characteristics ==


The German Shorthaired Pointer is of medium size: dogs stand some at the withers, bitches some 3 or 4 cm less. The coat is dense, short and rough-textured. It may be either brown or black, in any of three patterns: the solid-coloured, either with or without small flecks of white on the chest and legs; the white, with coloured head and coloured flecks or patches on the body; and the roan, either dark – in which coloured hairs predominate over white – or light, in which there are more white than coloured hairs.

The head is of moderate size, with a convex profile and a long, broad, and strong muzzle suitable for carrying game; the eyes are brown, the ears are rounded and set on high, and hang close to the head. Where not prohibited, the tail of a working dog may be docked to about half its length; it is carried roughly horizontally when the dog is moving and hangs down when it is at rest.

It is a tough, healthy dog. A 2024 UK study found a median longevity of 13.4 years for the breed, slightly above the average of 12.5 for all dogs. The breed has some genetic predisposition to neurological diseases including coccygeal muscle injury, GM2 gangliosidosis, hemivertebrae, pyogranulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis and sensory neuropathy. Other disorders associated with the breed include cataract, cranial cruciate ligament rupture, eversion of the cartilage of the nictitating membrane, hereditary lupoid dermatosis, progressive retinal atrophy, nasal carcinoma, oropharyngeal neoplasia, Von Willebrand&#x27;s disease and XX sex reversal.

== Uses ==

The German Shorthaired Pointer was bred to be a versatile all-round gun dog. It is capable of working in all weathers, on all terrains and in all types of cover; of finding and pointing to game, whether feathered or furred; of retrieving gently both in water and on land; of following a blood trail to find wounded game; and of defending against poachers and predators. Registration is subject to successful completion of a working trial.

In addition to hunting and field trials, German Shorthaired Pointer performs well in many dog sports such as agility, dock diving, and obedience. German Shorthaired Pointers are also used in law enforcement for nosework, such as the detection of illicit substances.

<doc id="519107" wikidata="Q3630457" url="?curid=519107" title="Tawaif">
<text>A tawaif was a highly successful courtesan singer‚ dancer‚ and poet who catered to the nobility of the Indian subcontinent, particularly during the Mughal era. Many tawaifs (nautch girls to the British) were forced to go into prostitution due to a lack of opportunities by the time of the British Raj.

Known variously as &quot;tawaifs&quot; in North India, &quot;Baijis&quot; in Bengal and &quot;naikins&quot; in Goa these professional singers and dancers were dubbed as “nautch girl” during the British rule. Tawaifs were largely a North Indian institution central to Mughal court culture from the 16th century onwards and became even more prominent with the weakening of Mughal rule in the mid-18th century. They contributed significantly to the continuation of traditional dance and music forms. The tawaifs excelled in and contributed to music, dance (mujra), theatre, and the Urdu literary tradition, and were considered an authority on etiquette.

Indian writer and scholar Pran Nevile said: “The word ‘tawaif’ deserves respect, not disdain. A lot of them were singers and not sex workers. People think of them as prostitutes, undermining their value as great musicians.” On 12 May 2024, Pakistan&#x27;s Dawn newspaper described tawaif as &quot;cultural idols and female intellectuals&quot;.

==History==

Tawaifs have existed for centuries in the Indian subcontinent, with one of the earliest references to the profession being the character Vasantasena from the 5th century BC Sanskrit drama Mṛcchakatika. In early India, Gaṇikā referred to a courtesan or public dancing girl. Ganikas were trained in fine arts like dance and music in order to entertain kings, princes, and other wealthy patrons on religious and social occasions. Women competed to win the title of a Nagarvadhu. The most beautiful woman, and most talented in various dance forms, was chosen as the Nagarvadhu. For example, Amrapali is a famous Nagarvadhu or royal dancer.

It is believed in folkloric history that Urvashi was said to have been born on earth as a devadasi and imparted the divine knowledge of dance unto humans. The first dance of the devadasi took place in a temple in the presence of a king who honoured her with titles and gifts and she would be well versed in temple rituals and took part in temple festivals. Devadasis were well received across North India and modern-day Pakistan and Chinese pilgrim Huein Tsang who visited India in the 7th century testified to the large number of dancing girls in the Sun Temple of Multan. Al-Biruni in his famous study of India in the 11th century recorded that about 500 dancing girls were active in the Somnath temple.

The patronage of the Mughal court in the Doab region and the subsequent atmosphere of 16th century Awadh made arts-related careers a viable prospect. Mughal Emperor Akbar himself was enchanted by a Portuguese expert dancing girl whom he named &quot;Dilruba&quot; (heart warmer).

Many girls were taken at a young age and trained in both performing arts, including mujra, Kathak, and Hindustani classical music, as well as literature, poetry (particularly ghazal), thumri, and dadra. The training of young tawaifs also encompassed urdu writing and enunciation, as well as social skills employed in cultivating patrons and retaining them, particularly the complex etiquette associated with their craft, in which they were seen as experts. During the Mughal period, prostitutes were known as randi, kasbi and thakahi, some prostitutes also sing and dance, but many of them did not even have access to artistic training.

Once a trainee had matured and possessed a sufficient command over dancing and singing, she became a &quot;tawaif&quot;, high-class courtesans who served the rich and noble. Unsurprisingly then, their training in music and dance started at a very young age, under the guidance and tutelage of renowned ustaads (masters). Young girls regularly spent hours in riyaz, learning songs and dance to the exacting standards set by their teachers. The term riyaz, from Arabic, connotes abstinence, devotion, discipline and hard labour. At a mundane level, regular riyaz is necessary for a flawless performance before an audience. Many well-known tawaifs practiced and learned music throughout their careers, seeking masters from different music traditions (gharanas) to add to their performance style.

The tawaif&#x27;s introduction into her profession was marked by a celebration, the so-called &quot;missī&quot; ceremony, that customarily included the inaugural blackening of her teeth.

It is also believed that young nawabs-to-be were sent to these tawaifs to learn &quot;tameez&quot; and &quot;tehzeeb&quot; which included the ability to recognise and appreciate good music and literature, perhaps even practice it, especially the art of ghazal writing. They also became teachers for the sons of wealthy and elite families, who would often send their sons to kothas so that they could learn Urdu speaking, poetry and etiquette from tawaifs. The boys would be told to sit and observe how a tawaif goes about her interactions. The Tawaif&#x27;s contribution to society came from a tradition of families and enjoyed a hierarchy. The uppermost echelon of tawaifs was entrusted with the responsibility of teaching &quot;adab&quot; (etiquette) and &quot;qa&#x27;ida&quot; (manners) to the kings and young princes. They would also familiarize the royalty with the finer nuances of poetry, music, dance and literature. By the 18th century, they had become the central element of polite, refined culture in North India.

The kotha of a tawaif is a performance space and as a guardian of arts and culture, and is only open to the city&#x27;s elite and wealthy patrons. In these rarified spaces, tawaifs would compose poetry, sing and dance with live musical composition, as well as performing at banquets, all of which required years of rigorous training. Tawaif is a performer who thrives on sponsorship from the royal and aristocratic families, and the dancers are responsible for performing mujra dance with good manners. True mujra dance is elegant, complex, and artistic, presented in an elegant manner. At grand occasions such as a marriage or the birth of a male heir, the tawaif is also invited to perform. In such occasions, they usually perform a mythological or legendary story, like singing. The tawaifs would dance, sing (especially ghazals), recite poetry (shairi) and entertain their suitors at mehfils. 

Like the geisha tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests, and while sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. High-class or the most popular tawaifs could often pick and choose among the best of their suitors. Tawaifs performed at temples during holidays and participated in temple celebrations, which had been passed down from generation to generation. They also had the tradition of performing at the Burhwa Mangal bazaar in the spring after Holi festival. Such events provided significant platform for tawaifs, not just for the patronage but also for the opportunity it offered for tawaifs to showcase their skills to general audiences and, thereby, retain societal acceptability for their trade. As a result of their popularity many dancing girls became very wealthy, according to Portuguese traveller, Domingo Paes the dancing girls were fabulously rich and Domingo was &quot;struck by their collars of gold studded with diamonds, rubies and pearls, bracelets on their arms, girdles below and, of necessity, anklets on their feet.&quot;

There were hierarchies among the performing artists, and the tawaifs were at the top, a class distinct from street performers and prostitutes. Tawaif kothas, where the tawaifs often lived and performed, would host meetings of local intelligentsia, presided mostly by the most senior tawaif of the kotha. Tawaifs enjoyed influence among writers, journalists and poets. The poets longed for a tawaif to sing their works and asked the famous tawaif if she could sing his poems. In those days, having tawaif perform his own work was a way to ensure that poetry would be remembered and passed down from generation to generation. A Tawaif had an unconventional approach to relationships, where female performers were expected to remain unmarried but were permitted to have relationships with patrons. Tawaifs traditionally served loyal mistresses to wealthy patrons. Only once a relationship was terminated, either due to the death of their patron or a mutual decision to part ways, would a tawaif look to enter into another relationship.

However, by the time the British Raj had annexed Punjab, the services of Tawaifs were no longer valued and even the most highly trained dancing girls were reviled as lewd by the Victorian standards of the British. Despite this, British men were happy to take local women as concubines and mistresses but were uninterested in becoming patrons of the formerly well tolerated tawaifs of Lahore, and even less interested in spending lavish sums upon them.

Some of the most prominent tawaifs in history were Anarkali, Mah Laqa Bai, Bhagmati, Lal Kunwar, Qudsia Begum, Zainabadi Mahal, Mubarak Begum and Begum Samru (who rose to rule the principality of Sardhana in western Uttar Pradesh), Moran Sarkar (who became the wife of Maharaja Ranjit Singh), Wazeeran (patronised by Lucknow&#x27;s last nawab Wajid Ali Shah), Begum Hazrat Mahal (Wajid Ali&#x27;s first wife who played an important role in the Indian Rebellion), Gauhar Jaan (a notable classical singer who sang for India&#x27;s first-ever record), and Zohrabai Agrewali.

A number of television and film actresses from Pakistan were tawaifs, including Niggo, Nadira, and Naina. A number of singers from Pakistan also were tawaifs, including Zeenat Begum and Tamancha Jan.

==British colonial period==

The annexation of Oudh by the East India Company in 1856 sounded the first death-knell for this medieval-era institution. It was soon looked down upon with disfavour by the colonial government, and the tawaifs were eventually forced to go into prostitution due to a lack of employment opportunities. Social reformers in India opposed them as social decadence. But some tawaif and institutions still survived until India&#x27;s independence in 1947. Some of the famous tawaifs include:

* Begum Akhtar (7 October 1914 – 30 October 1974), Indian singer and actress, known as &quot;Mallika-e-Ghazal&quot; (Queen of Ghazals).
* Binodini Dasi (1862–1941), Indian actress, pioneering entrepreneur of the Bengali stage.
* Fatma Begum (1892–1983), Indian actress, director and screenwriter.
* Husna Bai, thumri singer.
* Jaddanbai (1892–1949), Indian master music composer, singer, actress, and film maker.
* Rattan Bai (15 July 1890 – 1 January 1986), Indian actress and singer.
* Kajjanbai (15 February 1915 – 20 December 1945) Indian singer and actress, often referred to as the &quot;Nightingale of Bengal&quot;.
* Kajjan Begum (24 January 1932 – 10 February 2000) Pakistani classical singer and playback singer.
* Malika Pukhraj (1912 – 2004), Pakistani ghazal and folk singer.
* Malka Jaan, and daughter Gauhar Jaan (1873–1930), who created the first Indian song recording in 1902.
* Mukhtar Begum (12 July 1901 – 25 February 1982), Pakistani classical, ghazal singer and actress. She was known as The Queen of Music for singing songs in films and on radio.
* Chamiyan Bai (1898 – 14 August 1998), Indian singer and classical singer. She was also known as Shamshad Begum and was known as The Queen of Music. She is the mother of Naseem Banu and grandmother of Saira Banu.
* Rasoolan Bai (1902 – 15 December 1974), Indian Hindustani classical music vocal musician.
* Roshan Ara Begum (1917 – 6 December 1982), vocalist belonging to the Kirana gharana of Hindustani classical music. She is also known by her honorific title Malika-e-Mauseeqi (The Queen of Music) in both Pakistan and India.
* Shobha Gurtu (1925–2004), Indian singer in the light Hindustani classical style, known as The Thumri Queen.
* Zareena Begum of Lucknow (1947 – 12 May 2018), Indian classical singer.
* Zohrabai (1868–1913), Hindustani classical singer of the Agra gharana.
* Zeenat Begum (11 November 1931 – 11 December 2007), Pakistani singer, known as &quot;The Queen of Yesteryear&quot; for singing songs in films and on radio.
* Tamancha Jan (10 July 1918 – 20 October 2008), Pakistani folk singer, known as &quot;The Singing Siren&quot; and &quot;The Nightingale of Lahore&quot;.

The tawaifs had actively participated in anti-British actions behind the scenes. Their buildings, known as &quot;kothas&quot;, became meeting areas and hiding places for anti-British elements. Those tawaifs who accumulated wealth provided financial support to anti-British elements. Some tawaifs suffered retaliation from colonial authorities. Their kotha was searched and their belongings confiscated. The Victorian-era morality project placed a premium on women&#x27;s chastity and domesticity. As public performers, tawaifs were equated with prostitutes and their kothas were branded as brothels. Mujra dance originally did not refer to vulgar dance, but an elegant and ceremonial dance, usually performed by tawaif. During the British colonial period, some tawaifs became prostitute. The distinction between prostitutes and tawaifs began to blur. Some prostitutes also called their erotic dances mujra dance. Mujra dance gradually became associated with sex and prostitution.

They used to be the only source of popular music and dance and were often invited to perform on weddings and other occasions. Some of them became concubines and wives of maharajas and wealthy individuals. They were the first singers to record on gramophone with the emergence of that new technology. With the emergence of movies, however, they lost popularity. With their traditional spaces and modes of music rehearsal under attack, many tawaifs found space as performers in the newly emerging industries of mass entertainment, such as the gramophone, theatre and later films. The earliest singers to record for the gramophone, in the early 20th century, came from tawaif backgrounds, as did the first actresses of Parsi theatre and, later, the ‘talkies’, films with sound. A majority of tawaifs could not make this transition, however, and continued to perform within their kothas to a dwindling group of patrons.

==Decline==
After the British colonization, although more brothels and prostitutes were operating in Heera Mandi, there were still tawaif performing activities in the area, Heera Mandi retained its reputation as a centre of the performing arts. After the partition, young and attractive tawaifs from Heera Mandi became the first choice of Pakistan filmmakers. Tawaifs from Heera Mandi joined the Lollywood industry and gained much fame and wealth. Some of the most skilled tawaifs performed as backup dancers in early Pakistan films. In Heera Mandi and surrounding areas, there were many dance classrooms and music classrooms, which were closed as the tawaifs and musicians left.

With the development of time, the tawaif in India has gradually disappeared. In the 1980s, when kothas were no longer recognized as centres for aesthetics, and society disapproved of the tawaif&#x27;s art, as they felt it was sex work in the guise of adakari (performance). It was an era when tawaifs had to dodge guns, goons and Ghalib&#x27;s ghazals. The tawaifs who are still performing no longer have the same literary education as before, but they are not sex workers, &quot;a courtesan is no less than a circus performer, balancing a bottle on her head&quot;. They are all trained in Kathak, to regale the men who visit them in the evenings. Another skill they are expected to master is singing. Tawaifs are versed in ghazals, hori and thumris, but many now know just enough to earn a livelihood. In addition to performing at kotha, tawaifs also performed during weddings at home, celebrations of child birth and other festivities, provided the entertainment of singing and dancing. The 1993 Bow Bazaar bomb blast in Calcutta brought an end to the kothas in the busy commercial district. As dance bars and disco music replaced mujras, kathak and thumri, the tawaifs abandoned the profession.

<text>A random encounter is a feature commonly used in various role-playing games whereby combat encounters with non-player character (NPC) enemies or other dangers occur sporadically and at random, usually without the enemy being physically detected beforehand. In general, random encounters are used to simulate the challenges associated with being in a hazardous environment—such as a monster-infested wilderness or dungeon—with uncertain frequency of occurrence and makeup (as opposed to a &quot;placed&quot; encounter). Frequent random encounters are common in Japanese role-playing games like &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, and the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series.

==Role-playing games==

Random encounters—sometimes called wandering monsters—were a feature of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; from its beginnings in the 1970s, and persist in that game and its offshoots to this day. Random encounters are usually determined by the gamemaster by rolling dice against a &quot;random encounter table&quot;. The tables are usually based on terrain (and/or time/weather), and have a chance for differing encounters with different numbers or types of creatures. The results may be modified by other tables, such as whether the encounter is friendly, neutral or hostile. GMs are often encouraged to make their own tables. Specific adventures often have specific tables for locations, like a temple&#x27;s hallways.

Wandering monsters are often used to wear down player characters and force them to use up consumable resources, such as hit points, magic spells and healing potions, as a way of punishing them for spending too much time in a dangerous area.

==Video games==

Random encounters were incorporated into early role-playing video games and have been common throughout the genre. Placed and random encounters were both used in 1981s &quot;Wizardry&quot; and by the mid-1980s, random encounters made up the bulk of battles in genre-defining games such as &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Random encounters happen when the player is traversing the game world (often through the use of a &quot;world map&quot; or overworld). Most often, the player encounters enemies to battle, but occasionally friendly or neutral characters can appear, with whom the player might interact differently than with enemies. Random encounters are random in the respect that players cannot anticipate the exact moment of encounter or what will be encountered, as the occurrence of the event is based on factors such as programmed probabilities; Pseudo-random number generators create the sequence of numbers used to determine if an encounter will happen. The form and frequency can vary depending on a number of factors, such as where the player is located in the game world and the statistics of the player character. In some games, items can be found to increase or decrease the frequency of random encounters, even to eliminate them outright, or increase the odds of having a particular encounter.

Random encounters often occur more frequently in dungeons, caves, forests, deserts, and swamps than in open plains. The simplest sort of random encounter algorithm would be as follows:

# Each step, set X to a random integer between 0 and 99.
# If in plains, and X &lt; 8, a random encounter occurs.
# If in swamp, desert, or forest, and X &lt; 16, a random encounter occurs.

The problem with this algorithm is that random encounters occur &quot;too&quot; randomly for the tastes of most players, as there will be &quot;droughts&quot; and &quot;floods&quot; in their distribution. Random encounters in rapid succession are considered undesirable as they lead to the player&#x27;s perception of getting &quot;bogged down&quot;, but with the simple algorithm, it is possible to have an encounter from taking only one step after an encounter. The early games in the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, for example, allow random encounters to occur one step after the other. A more elaborate random encounter algorithm (and similar to those used in many games) would be the following:

# Set X to a random integer between 64 and 255.
# For each step in plains, decrement X by 4. For each step in forest, swamp, or desert, decrement X by 8.
# When X &lt; 0, a fight ensues. Go to step 1.

This ensures that, in any terrain, the player will not experience more than one random encounter every eight steps. A game with this type of system can sometimes be taken advantage of by initiating some action that will reset the counter (pausing, opening a menu, saving), especially when using an emulator. This is a popular trick in speedruns to skip time-consuming or dangerous battles or it can be used to ensure that each battle results in a rare or valuable encounter.

Random encounters have become less popular in video games with the passage of time, as gamers often complain that they are annoying, repetitive or discouraging to exploration. The &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Tales&quot; series have abandoned random encounter systems with successive games, while relatively newer franchises such as the &quot;Chrono&quot; series and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; have never used them.

A more commonly used tactic in later RPGs (used in &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;, &quot;Radiata Stories&quot;, &quot;Fallout&quot; and &quot;Fallout 2&quot; (although the &quot;Fallout&quot; games have unlimited random encounters on the world map)), like &quot;Legend of Legaia&quot; and all &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; games have a finite number of enemies in a given area. This cuts down on grinding and does not discourage exploration to the same extent. A similar approach is spawning, where visible monsters always (re)appear at the same location, as seen in &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and most of &quot;Dragon Quest IX&quot;. Both approaches give players the opportunity to anticipate, evade, or select encounters.

<text>The Maputo River (), also called Great Usutu River, Lusutfu River, or Suthu River, is a river in South Africa, Eswatini, and Mozambique. The name &quot;Suthu&quot; refers to Basotho people who lived near the source of the river, but were attacked and displaced by the Swazis. It is also said to mean &#x27;dark brown&#x27;, a description of the river&#x27;s muddy water.

==Course==
The river rises near Amsterdam, Mpumalanga, South Africa, and flows easterly through Eswatini, where it enters the Lebombo Mountains. The 13 km gorge forms the boundary between Eswatini and South Africa. For approximately twenty kilometres, it forms the border between South Africa (province of KwaZulu-Natal) and Mozambique. There, in the Ndumo Game Reserve, it absorbs its largest tributary, the Pongola River. It then meanders through the Mozambican coastal plain and empties into southern Maputo Bay, some 85 kilometres downstream.

In Eswatini, the river is called the Great Usutu or Lusutfu and flows through the towns of Bhunya, Luyengo, Siphofaneni, and Big Bend. The town of Big Bend is near a point in which the river meanders abruptly. The Great Usutu is the largest river in Eswatini, it is the site of Eswatini&#x27;s lowest point (21 m above sea level), and is known for whitewater rafting. No large towns have been able to form along its banks because of deep narrow valleys and dense forests. It is, however, home to some golf courses, hotels, and nature reserves.

== Tributaries ==
From the origin to its mouth, in order, tributaries are the: Sihanahana, Bonnie Brook, Mpuluzi, Buhlungu, Umvenvane, Lusushwana, Sidvokodvo, Mkhondvo, Mhlamani, Mzimneni, Mzimphofu, Mhlathuzane, Mtsindzekwa, Nyetane, Funuane, and the Pongola Rivers.

<doc id="519113" wikidata="Q7240647" url="?curid=519113" title="Preparedness Movement">
<text>The Preparedness Movement was a campaign led by former Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, Leonard Wood, and former President Theodore Roosevelt to strengthen the U.S. military after the outbreak of World War I. Wood advocated a summer training school for reserve officers to be held in Plattsburgh, New York.

The movement was at first opposed by President Woodrow Wilson, who believed the United States should be in a position of neutrality in order to broker a compromise peace in Europe. Several organizations were formed around the Preparedness Movement and held parades and organized opposition to Wilson&#x27;s policies. After the &quot;Lusitania&quot; was sunk by German U-boats on May 7, 1915, and Pancho Villa launched his raid against Columbus, New Mexico, Wilson&#x27;s attitude changed. The United States Congress passed the National Defense Act of 1916 in June 1916 to authorize an increase in the size of the U.S. Army from 100,000 men in 1916 to 200,000 on active duty and 400,000 in the U.S. National Guard, by 1921. It also padded a large long-term increase in the U.S. Navy.

==The movement==

In 1915, a strong &quot;preparedness&quot; movement emerged. It argued that the United States needed to immediately build up strong naval and land forces for defensive purposes; an unspoken assumption was that the United States would fight sooner or later. General Leonard Wood (still on active duty after serving a term as Chief of Staff of the Army), ex-president Theodore Roosevelt, and former secretaries of war Elihu Root and Henry Stimson were the driving forces behind the preparedness movement, along with many of the nation&#x27;s most prominent bankers, industrialists, lawyers and scions of prominent families. There emerged an &quot;Atlanticist&quot; foreign policy establishment, a group of influential Americans drawn primarily from upper-class lawyers, bankers, academics, and politicians of the Northeastern US, committed to a strand of Anglophile internationalism.

A representative leader was Paul D. Cravath, one of New York&#x27;s foremost corporation lawyers. For Cravath, in his mid-fifties when the war began, the conflict served as an epiphany, sparking an interest in international affairs that dominated his remaining career. Fiercely Anglophile, he strongly supported US intervention in the war and hoped that close Anglo-American cooperation would be the guiding principle of post-war international organization.

The preparedness movement had a &quot;realistic&quot; philosophy of world affairs—it believed that economic strength and military muscle were more decisive than idealistic crusades focused on causes like democracy and national self-determination. Emphasizing the weak state of national defenses, the movement showed that America&#x27;s 100,000-man army, even augmented by the 112,000 National Guardsmen, was outnumbered 20 to one by the German Army, which was drawn from a smaller population. Reform to them meant UMT or &quot;universal military training&quot;, i.e. conscription. Preparedness backers proposed a national service program under which the 600,000 men who turned 18 every year would be required to spend six months in military training, and afterwards be assigned to reserve units. The small regular army would primarily serve as a training agency.

This proposal ultimately failed, but it fostered the Plattsburg Movement, a series of summer training camps that in 1915 and 1916 hosted some 40,000 men largely of elite social classes, and the later Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camps that trained some 400,000 men from 1921 to 1940.

==Opposition==

The Socialist Party was a bulwark of opposition to the preparedness movement. Antimilitarists and pacifists—strong in Protestant churches and women&#x27;s groups—protested the plan would make the United States resemble Germany, which required two years&#x27; compulsory military service from every male citizen. 

Another source of criticism of the Preparedness Movement and particularly its demands for &quot;100% Americanism&quot; came, quite understandably, from those increasingly dubbed Hyphenated Americans; America&#x27;s enormous number of White ethnic immigrants and their descendants. Criticism from White ethnic circles occasionally argued that &quot;100% Americanism&quot; really meant Anglophilia, as particularly demonstrated by escalating demands for both the &quot;Special Relationship&quot; and for tolerating only the English language in the United States. In a letter published on 16 July 1916 in the &quot;Minneapolis Journal&quot;, Edward Goldbeck, a member of Minnesota&#x27;s traditionally very large German-American community, announced that his people would, &quot;abandon the hyphen&quot;, as soon as English-Americans did so. Meanwhile, Goldbeck argued, &quot;Let the exodus of Anglo-Americans start at once! Let all those people go who think that America is a new England!&quot;

Furthermore, in June 1917, anti-war essayist Randolph Bourne also raised the possibility that the Preparedness Movement may have been one of the multiple covert operations used by both French and British Intelligence propagandists in order to bring America into the war against the Central Powers, &quot;The nerve of the war feeling centered ... In the richer and older classes of the Atlantic seaboard, and was keenest where there were French or English business and particularly social connections. The sentiment then spread out across the country as a class-phenonemon, touching everywhere those upper-class elements in each section who identified themselves with this Eastern ruling group... In every community, it was the least liberal and least democratic elements among whom the Preparedness and later the war sentiment was found.&quot;

While defenders of the Movement retorted that military &quot;service&quot; was an essential duty of citizenship, and that without the commonality provided by such service the nation would splinter into antagonistic ethnic groups. One spokesman promised that UMT would become &quot;a real melting pot, under which the fire is hot enough to fuse the elements into one common mass of Americanism.&quot; Furthermore, they promised, the discipline and training would make for a better-paid work force. The hostility to military service was so strong at the time it is difficult to imagine such a program winning approval; indeed, even in World War II, when Stimson as Secretary of War proposed a similar program of universal peacetime service, he was defeated. Underscoring its commitment, the preparedness movement set up and funded its own summer training camps (at Plattsburgh, New York, and other sites) where 40,000 college alumni became physically fit, learned to march and shoot, and ultimately provided the cadre of a wartime officer corps.

Suggestions by labor unions that talented working-class youth be invited to Plattsburgh were ignored. The preparedness movement was distant not only from the working classes but also from the middle class leadership of most of small town America. It had had little use for the National Guard, which it saw as politicized, localistic, poorly armed, ill trained, too inclined to idealistic crusading (as against Spain in 1898), and too lacking in understanding of world affairs. The National Guard on the other hand was securely rooted in state and local politics, with representation from a very broad cross section of American society. The National Guard was one of the nation&#x27;s few institutions that (at least in some northern states) accepted African-Americans on an equal footing with whites.

==Democrats==

The Democratic Party saw the preparedness movement as a threat. Roosevelt, Root and Wood were prospective Republican presidential candidates. More subtly, the Democrats were rooted in localism that appreciated the National Guard, and the voters were hostile to the rich and powerful in the first place. Working with the Democrats who controlled Congress, Wilson was able to sidetrack the preparedness forces. Army and Navy leaders were forced to testify before Congress to the effect that the nation&#x27;s military was in excellent shape. Wilson had to resist the demands for preparedness because there was a powerful anti-preparedness element of the party, led by William Jennings Bryan, women, Protestant churches, the American Federation of Labor, and Southern Democrats such as Claude Kitchin, chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. John Morton Blum, a biographer of Wilson, wrote: &quot;Wilson&#x27;s long silence about preparedness had permitted such a spread and such a hardening of antipreparedness attitudes within his party and across the nation that when he came in at late last to his task, neither Congress nor the country was amenable to much persuasion.&quot;

In July 1915, Wilson instructed the Army and Navy to formulate plans for expansion. In November, he asked for far less than the experts said was needed, seeking an army of 400,000 volunteers at a time when European armies were 10 times as large. Congress ignored the proposal and the Army remained at 100,000 soldiers. Wilson was severely handicapped by the weaknesses of his cabinet. According to Blum, his Secretaries of the Navy and War displayed a &quot;confusion, inattention to industrial preparation, and excessive deference to peacetime mores [that] dangerously retarded the development of the armed services.&quot; Even more, Wilson was constrained by the traditional American non-interventionism. Wilson believed that a massive military mobilization could only take place after a declaration of war, even though that meant a long delay in sending troops to Europe. Many Democrats felt that no American soldiers would be needed, only American money and munitions. Wilson had more success in his request for a dramatic expansion of the Navy. Congress passed the Naval Act of 1916, which encapsulated the planning by the Navy&#x27;s professional officers to build a fleet of top-rank status, but it would take several years to become operational.

==Wilson&#x27;s program==
Wilson, less fearful of the navy, embraced a long-term building program designed to make the fleet the equal of the Royal Navy by the mid-1920s. &quot;Realism&quot; was at work here; the admirals were Mahanians and they therefore wanted a surface fleet of heavy battleships second to none—that is, equal to Britain. The facts of submarine warfare (which necessitated destroyers, not battleships) and the possibilities of imminent war with Germany (or with Britain, for that matter), were simply ignored. The Administration&#x27;s proposals touched off a firestorm of antiwar protest. Secretary of War Lindley Garrison adopted many of the proposals of the preparedness leaders, especially their emphasis on a large federal reserves and abandonment of the National Guard. Garrison&#x27;s proposals not only outraged the localistic politicians of both parties, they also offended a strongly held belief shared by the liberal wing of the progressive movement. They felt that warfare always had a hidden economic motivation. Specifically, they warned the chief warmongers were New York bankers (like J. P. Morgan) with millions at risk, profiteering munition makers (like Bethlehem Steel, which made armor, and DuPont, which made powder) and unspecified industrialists searching for global markets to control. Antiwar critics such as Wisconsin&#x27;s Republican Senator La Follette blasted them, saying there was an unnamed &quot;world-wide organization&quot; that was &quot;stimulating and fomenting discord in order that it may make profit out of the furnishing of munitions of war.&quot; The only road to peace was disarmament, reiterated Bryan, speaking for the antiwar Democrats.

Garrison&#x27;s plan unleashed the fiercest battle in peacetime history over the relationship of military planning to national goals. In peacetime, War Department arsenals and navy yards manufactured nearly all munitions that lacked civilian uses, including warships, artillery, naval guns, and shells. Items available on the civilian market, such as food, horses, saddles, wagons, and uniforms were always purchased from civilian contractors.

===Peace leaders===
Peace leaders like Jane Addams of Hull House and David Starr Jordan, president of Stanford University, redoubled their efforts, and now turned their voices against Wilson because he was &quot;sowing the seeds of militarism, raising up a military and naval caste.&quot; Many ministers, professors, farm spokesmen and labor union leaders joined in, with powerful support from a band of four dozen southern Democrats in Congress who took control of the House Military Affairs Committee.

===Wilson appeals to the people===
Wilson, in deep trouble, took his cause to the people in a major speaking tour in early 1916, a warm-up for his reelection campaign that fall. Wilson seems to have won over the middle classes, but had little impact on the largely ethnic working classes and the deeply isolationist farmers. Congress still refused to budge, so Wilson replaced Garrison as Secretary of War with Newton Baker, the Democratic mayor of Cleveland and an outspoken opponent of preparedness. (Garrison kept quiet, but felt Wilson was &quot;a man of high ideals but no principles.&quot;)

===Compromise reached===
Congress reached a compromise in May 1916. The army was to double in size to 11,300 officers and 208,000 men, with no reserves, and a National Guard that would be enlarged in five years to 440,000 men. Summer camps on the Plattsburgh model were authorized for new officers, and the government was given $20 million to build a nitrate plant of its own. Preparedness supporters were downcast, the antiwar people were jubilant. The United States would now be too weak to go to war. Colonel Robert L. Bullard privately complained: &quot;Both sides [Britain and Germany] treat us with scorn and contempt; our fool, smug conceit of superiority has been exploded in our faces and deservedly.&quot; The House gutted the naval plans as well, defeating a &quot;big navy&quot; plan by 189 to 183, and scuttling the battleships. The Battle of Jutland (May 31/June 1, 1916) saw the German fleet nearly sunk by the stronger British fleet. Only brilliant seamanship and luck allowed it to escape. Arguing this battle proved the validity of Mahanian doctrine, the navalists took control in the Senate, broke the House coalition, and authorized a rapid three-year buildup of all classes of warships. A new weapons system, naval aviation, received $3.5 million, and the government was authorized to build its own armor-plate factory. The notion that armaments led to war was turned on its head: refusal to arm in 1916 led Berlin to make war on the U.S. in 1917. The very weakness of U.S. military power encouraged Berlin to start its unrestricted submarine attacks in 1917. It knew this meant war with the United States, but it could discount the immediate risk because the U.S. Army was negligible and the new warships would not be at sea until 1919 by which time the war would be over, with Germany victorious.

<doc id="519114" wikidata="Q6236654" url="?curid=519114" title="John Guy (colonial administrator)">
<text>John Guy (25 December 1568 – February 1629) was an English merchant adventurer, colonist and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1621 to 1624. He was the first proprietary governor of Newfoundland Colony, the first attempt to establish a colony on Newfoundland.

==Early life==
Guy was the eldest son and second child of Thomas Guy, a cordwainer (shoemaker) of Bristol. He was born on 25 December 1568, and baptized a week later on 1 January 1569 at St Mary le Port Church, Bristol. He spent his youth growing up amongst his siblings, and was well educated for his times, he managed in later life to write poetry in Latin. He was apprenticed to a yeoman farmer, and on his parents&#x27; deaths, he inherited the family shoemaking business, he had various farming interests, and served as a factor representing the interests of the Bristol merchant community overseas for a period in Spain, where he mastered the art of navigation. Guy became a merchant and was admitted to the corporation of the city in 1603, as a Councillor of Bristol. He was also appointed the Sheriff of Bristol for the year 1605–06. During the emergency of 1605 when the country was threatened with invasion from overseas, he was appointed one of Rear-Admirals in the Royal Navy, as Bristol was at the time of the two main naval ports in the country. In 1607 he was also appointed Surveyor of Bristol, a post which gave him the responsibility for obtaining provisions for the naval vessels that visited the port of Bristol.

==Colonist==
In 1608 Guy and other members of the Society of Merchant Venturers, decided to act upon the letter received by the mayor from Chief Justice Sir John Popham concerning the colonisation of Newfoundland. Since John Cabot had discovered the island and Sir Humphrey Gilbert had formally taken possession of it for Elizabeth I of England, the merchants of the city had a special interest in Newfoundland, but there had been little attempt to exploit and colonise the island. The merchants decided not to embark on the scheme without the co-operation of King James VI of Scotland and Elizabeth I of England, which was forthcoming. Guy visited the island in 1608 to scout possible locations for a settlement, selecting Cuper&#x27;s Cove (present day Cupids, Newfoundland and Labrador) as the site of the colony. In 1609, he put forward a proposal &quot;to animate the English to plant [or colonise] in Newfoundland.&quot; The merchants of Bristol and London took up the idea with enthusiasm and a list of contributions was made out with Guy and others subscribing twenty marks a year for five years. The idea was popular with members of the court. Amongst the 50 shareholders were John Guy and his younger brother Philip Guy, in effect, Guy had the largest shareholding invested in the venture. On 27 April 1610 James I granted a charter to Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, Keeper of the Privy Seal, and others including John Guy and his brother Philip Guy, which incorporated them as the &quot;Treasurer and Company of Adventurers and Planters of the Cities of London and Bristol, for the purpose of colonising Newfoundland, and comprehending as their sphere of action the southern and eastern parts of the new found land between 46° and 52° N. L.&quot;

Guy was appointed governor in 1610 by the London and Bristol Company and arrived at Cuper&#x27;s Cove in August of that year with colonists, grain and livestock, after a quick passage of 21 days. Thirty-nine colonists spent the winter of 1610–1611 in the colony. During his governorship the colonists built and fortified the settlement, explored the area and planted crops. Guy returned to England in 1611 leaving William Colston - one of his brothers-in-law, and distantly related to the family of Edward Colston, and his brother Philip to manage the colony, as the first two Lieutenant-Governors of the Colony. Back in England, he was elected to the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers, and he was then elected as the treasurer of the merchant venturers from 1611 to 1612 and then returned the next year with more livestock and female settlers.

In 1612, the actions of the English pirate Peter Easton convinced Guy to abandon a second colony established at Renews in the spring of that year and strengthen the fortifications at Cuper&#x27;s Cove. At one point, Guy and three other colonists in a canoe were attacked by the pirates and captured; the colonist with the musket was injured. The pirates were discussing the best way to execute John Guy and his men when they escaped with the help of a former colonist who had decided to throw in his lot with the pirates but who remembered the help John Guy had given him in the past and wasn&#x27;t prepared to stand aside whilst his former friend was possibly murdered. The colonists built a boat called the Endeavour, which Guy used to lead a voyage into Trinity Bay in the Autumn of 1612 in an attempt to contact and establish a fur trade with the Beothuk, the native inhabitants of the island. On 6 November, Guy&#x27;s party met, shared a meal and exchanged gifts with a group of Beothuk somewhere in Bull Arm, Trinity Bay.

==Politician==
Guy returned to England in April 1613. In that same year, a cousin of the first Governor, Nicholas Guy, became the father of the first son born in Newfoundland, from whom most of the current Guys now living in Canada are descended. John Guy returned to Newfoundland in 1614-15, when he had the indignity of being sent home in irons by the second Governor of the Colony, John Mason, who didn&#x27;t really want the previous Governor being around, as he felt threatened by Guy&#x27;s knowledge and respect amongst the colonists. His withdrawal was also in part the result of the troubles caused by the pirates led by Peter Easton. Five years later a visitor to Newfoundland wrote that the Bristol citizens had &quot;planted a large circuit of the country, and builded there many fine houses, and done many other good services&quot; Guy became disillusioned due to the lack of support from the London merchants, and remained in Bristol, though he later received a grant of land in Newfoundland which he named Sea Forest, and which he divided amongst his younger sons in his will in 1624.

In 1618, Guy became Mayor of Bristol, and in 1619 he was appointed an Alderman of Bristol, a post he held until his death in 1629, and he was also a member of the Bristol Merchant Venturer&#x27;s Society Court of Assistants in 1620 and 1621. John Guy in his capacity as an admiral in the Royal Navy fought against Turkish pirates operating in the English Channel during 1620, for which the grateful merchants of Bristol, provided him with a sum of money as a vote of thanks for his efforts. He was elected as one of the 2 Members of Parliament for Bristol in 1620, and remained its MP until 1621. In a debate on 27 February on the scarcity of money he spoke of the abundance of English coin in foreign parts, and recommended that the exportation of money should be forbidden. He received and wrote several letters about the interests of the merchant venturers company. His fellow MP for Bristol - John Whitson, the founder of the Red Maids School, Bristol - wrote in October 1621 on the &quot;business of Sir Ferdinando Gorges&quot; referring to the restraint of trade with New England as a result of articles and orders of the president and council for New England, which the merchants &quot;in noe sorte did like&quot;.

In February 1622, Guy wrote about his &#x27;conference with the lord treasurer and others concerning the new imposition of wines and composition of grocery. He was the Master of the Bristol Merchant Venturer&#x27;s Society for 1622-23, during which time his eldest son-in-law was admitted to the position of Junior Warden in the Bristol Merchant Venturer&#x27;s Society. In 1624, he was re-elected MP for Bristol, and remained the MP for Bristol until he decided to retire from Parliament on the death of James I. Guy was actively involved in the House of Commons - sitting on Committees and introducing a private Members Bill to reduce interest rates by 2% from 10% to 8%. He was an elected as a Member of the Court of Assistants again from 1624 to 1628 for the Bristol Merchant Venturer&#x27;s Society.

Guy was buried in St Stephen&#x27;s Church, which was known as the church for the Bristol Merchant Venturer&#x27;s Society. The register books of the church show that his burial took place on 23 February 1629. The will of his son John (who died in 1640, from the plague which he caught whilst studying at the Middle Temple) calls for the erection of a monument for his father in St Stephen&#x27;s Church. There is no monument to John Guy anywhere in Bristol, but his name is recorded in the list of mayors of Bristol in the Bristol City Council House for the year 1618. John Guy&#x27;s widow Ann survived him until 1660, by which time she had outlived all but 2 of their 10 children (five sons and five daughters) -- their eldest daughter and youngest son still remaining alive.

==Legacy==
Archaeological excavations indicate that Cuper&#x27;s Cove continued to be occupied throughout the 17th century, and was never abandoned. Today the town of Cupids has a population of about 700.
