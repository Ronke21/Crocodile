<text>In philosophy and the arts, a fundamental distinction exists between abstract and concrete entities. While there is no universally accepted definition, common examples illustrate the difference: numbers, sets, and ideas are typically classified as abstract objects, whereas plants, dogs, and planets are considered concrete objects.

Philosophers have proposed several criteria to define this distinction:

# &quot;Spatiotemporal existence&quot; – Abstract objects exist outside space-time, while concrete objects exist within space-time.
# &quot;Causal influence&quot; – Concrete objects can cause and be affected by other entities (e.g., a rock breaking a window), whereas abstract objects (e.g., the number 2) lack causal powers and do not cause anything to happen in the physical world.
# &quot;Metaphysical relation&quot; – In metaphysics, concrete objects are specific, individual things (particulars), while abstract objects represent general concepts or categories (universals).
# &quot;Ontological domain&quot; – Concrete objects belong to the physical realm (or both the physical and mental realms), whereas abstract objects belong to neither. 

Another view is that it is the distinction between contingent existence versus necessary existence; however, philosophers differ on which type of existence here defines abstractness, as opposed to concreteness. Despite this diversity of views, there is broad agreement concerning most objects as to whether they are abstract or concrete, such that most interpretations agree, for example, that rocks are concrete objects while numbers are abstract objects.

Abstract objects are most commonly used in philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and semantics. They are sometimes called abstracta in contrast to concreta. The term &quot;abstract object&quot; is said to have been coined by Willard Van Orman Quine. Abstract object theory is a discipline that studies the nature and role of abstract objects. It holds that properties can be related to objects in two ways: through exemplification and through encoding. Concrete objects exemplify their properties while abstract objects merely encode them. This approach is also known as the dual copula strategy.

==In philosophy==
The type–token distinction identifies physical objects that are tokens of a particular type of thing. The &quot;type&quot; of which it is a part is in itself an abstract object. The abstract–concrete distinction is often introduced and initially understood in terms of paradigmatic examples of objects of each kind:

Abstract objects have often garnered the interest of philosophers because they raise problems for popular theories. In ontology, abstract objects are considered problematic for physicalism and some forms of naturalism. Historically, the most important ontological dispute about abstract objects has been the problem of universals. In epistemology, abstract objects are considered problematic for empiricism. If abstracta lack causal powers and spatial location, how do we know about them? It is hard to say how they can affect our sensory experiences, and yet we seem to agree on a wide range of claims about them.

Some, such as Ernst Mally, Edward Zalta and arguably, Plato in his Theory of Forms, have held that abstract objects constitute the defining subject matter of metaphysics or philosophical inquiry more broadly. To the extent that philosophy is independent of empirical research, and to the extent that empirical questions do not inform questions about abstracta, philosophy would seem especially suited to answering these latter questions.

In modern philosophy, the distinction between abstract and concrete was explored by Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel.

Gottlob Frege said that abstract objects, such as propositions, were members of a third realm, different from the external world or from internal consciousness. (See Popper&#x27;s three worlds.)

===Abstract objects and causality===
Another popular proposal for drawing the abstract–concrete distinction contends that an object is abstract if it lacks causal power. A causal power has the ability to affect something causally. Thus, the empty set is abstract because it cannot act on other objects. One problem with this view is that it is not clear exactly what it is to have causal power. For a more detailed exploration of the abstract–concrete distinction, see the relevant &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; article.

===Quasi-abstract entities===
In the 2010s, there was some philosophical interest in the development of a third category of objects known as the quasi-abstract. Quasi-abstract objects have drawn particular attention in the area of social ontology and documentality. Some argue that the over-adherence to the platonist duality of the concrete and the abstract has led to a large category of social objects having been overlooked or rejected as nonexistent because they exhibit characteristics that the traditional duality between concrete and abstract regards as incompatible. Specifically, the ability to have temporal location, but not spatial location, and have causal agency (if only by acting through representatives). These characteristics are exhibited by a number of social objects, including states of the international legal system.

==Concrete and abstract thought in psychology==

Jean Piaget uses the terms &quot;concrete&quot; and &quot;formal&quot; to describe two different types of learning. Concrete thinking involves facts and descriptions about everyday, tangible objects, while abstract (formal operational) thinking involves a mental process.

The latter earned her two nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.

Panettiere first appeared on-screen in a commercial in 1990 at eleven months old. Her full-time acting career began in 1994 when she played Sarah Roberts in the ABC soap opera series &quot;One Life to Live&quot; until 1997. She played Lizzie Spaulding in the CBS soap opera series &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, from 1996 to 2000. For her role on the Pixar film &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998), she was nominated for a Young Artist Award and a Grammy Award, making her the 5th youngest nominee for a Grammy.

Panettiere has starred in the Lifetime Television film &quot;If You Believe&quot;, Disney football drama film &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; (2000), the final season of the Fox legal comedy-drama series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (2002), the comedy-drama film &quot;Raising Helen&quot; (2004), the Disney Channel original patriotic film &quot;Tiger Cruise&quot; (2004), the horse racing comedy film &quot;Racing Stripes&quot; (2005), the figure skating drama film &quot;Ice Princess&quot; (2005), the teen cheerleading film &quot;Bring It On: All or Nothing&quot; (2006), the romantic comedy film &quot;I Love You, Beth Cooper&quot; (2009), the true crime drama film &quot;Amanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italy&quot; (2011), and the drama film &quot;Custody&quot; (2016). She voiced Kairi and Xion in the video game series &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; (2002–2017), and Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Giddings in the video game &quot;Until Dawn&quot; (2015).

==Early life==
Panettiere was born and partly raised in Palisades, New York. She is the daughter of Lesley R. Vogel, a former soap opera actress, and Alan Lee &quot;Skip&quot; Panettiere, a captain in the New York City Fire Department. She is of English, German and Italian descent. She had one younger brother, fellow actor Jansen Panettiere, who died at age 28 from aortic valve complications from enlarged heart syndrome in 2023. Her mother&#x27;s family lives in Indiana.

After attending South Orangetown Middle School in New York, Panettiere was homeschooled and had private tutors from grade nine to the completion of high school to accommodate her acting schedule.

==Career==
===Acting===
====Television====
Panettiere first appeared in commercials at the age of eleven months, beginning with an advertisement for a Playskool toy train. She landed a role as Sarah Roberts on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 1994 to 1997, which was followed by Lizzie Spaulding on the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in 1996, and again from 1997 to 2000. While on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, Panettiere&#x27;s character Lizzie battled leukemia. The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society gave her its Special Recognition Award for drawing the attention of daytime viewers to the disease, and for improving national awareness.

For her performance in Lifetime Television&#x27;s 1999 TV film &quot;If You Believe&quot;, she was nominated for the Young Artist Award for Young Actress Age Ten or Under in the category of Best Performance in a TV Movie or Pilot. Panettiere appeared on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; as the title character&#x27;s daughter, played the daughter of a man transitioning to female in HBO Films&#x27; &quot;Normal&quot;, had a recurring guest role on &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; and guest starred in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; in two different roles.

Panettiere gained greater fame as Claire Bennet in the NBC series &quot;Heroes&quot;, which was created by Tim Kring, as a high school cheerleader with healing powers. Thanks to her role on &quot;Heroes&quot;, she became a regular on the science fiction convention circuit, invited to attend conventions around the world in 2007, including Gen Con, New York Comic Con, and Fan Expo Canada. Panettiere has complained that her acting options are sometimes limited because &quot;people look at [her] as either the popular cheerleader type or just the blonde&quot;.

In early 2007, Panettiere appeared on the MTV show &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;. The appearance was engineered by her mother and involved a male &quot;fan&quot; discussing her work with her, instigating a jealous reaction from the man&#x27;s spouse. In April 2012, she hosted an episode of the new series.

In March 2012, it was announced Panettiere had been cast opposite Connie Britton on the ABC musical drama series &quot;Nashville&quot;, where she portrayed Juliette Barnes. The show reunited Panettiere with Burgess Jenkins (who appears in the first few episodes) from &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;. The show moved from ABC to CMT for its fifth and sixth seasons, and concluded its run on July 26, 2018.

====Film====
Panettiere made her feature film debut at the age of 9, as the voice of Dot in 1998&#x27;s &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. Her first released film was the same year&#x27;s &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot; at the age of 8, in which she appears briefly as a mermaid in the school play in the opening scene. In 1999, she played the girl on a sinking sailboat in &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;. She played the daughter of the coach in the 2000 biographical film &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;. In 2004, Disney Channel gave Panettiere her first starring roles as the daughter of actor Bill Pullman&#x27;s character in &quot;Tiger Cruise&quot;, and as a teenage girl caught in a fantasy transitional realm alongside fellow child actor Ryan Kelley in fantasy film &quot;The Dust Factory&quot;.

Her last major acting credit of 2004 was the role of adolescent niece to Kate Hudson&#x27;s title character in &quot;Raising Helen&quot;, where Panettiere played the older sister to real life siblings Abigail and Spencer Breslin. In 2005, Panettiere starred alongside Michelle Trachtenberg as an ice skating rival in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Ice Princess&quot;. She played a budding jockey Channing Walsh in 2005&#x27;s film &quot;Racing Stripes.&quot; In 2006, Panettiere played a cheerleader in &quot;Bring It On: All or Nothing&quot; and had a supporting role as Adelaide Bourbon in the 2007 independent film &quot;Shanghai Kiss&quot;.

In June 2007, she signed with the William Morris Agency, after previously being represented by the United Talent Agency. &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that she earned $2 million in 2007.

In 2008, Panettiere appeared in the drama &quot;Fireflies in the Garden&quot; as a younger version of Emily Watson&#x27;s character, Jane Lawrence. In September 2008, she appeared in a satirical video, a mock-PSA for Funny or Die titled &quot;Hayden Panettiere PSA: Your Vote, Your Choice&quot;. In October, Panettiere appeared in another satirical PSA video on funnyordie.com titled &quot;Vote for McCain: He&#x27;s just like George Bush, except older and with a worse temper&quot;.

In July 2009, Panettiere starred in the teen comedy &quot;I Love You, Beth Cooper&quot;. In September 2010, she starred as Amanda Knox in the controversial &quot;Amanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italy&quot;. Panettiere provided the voice of Kate in 2010&#x27;s &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot;.

In April 2011, Panettiere appeared in the &quot;Scream&quot; sequel, &quot;Scream 4&quot;, playing Kirby Reed. The film received mixed reviews, but she received acclaim for her role and was considered to be a highlight. The same year she replaced Anne Hathaway as the voice of Red for the animated sequel &quot;Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil&quot;. In 2012, &quot;The Forger&quot;, in which she played the role of Amber, was released direct to DVD (both this and &quot;Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil&quot; were made in 2009).

In April 2015, Panettiere joined the cast of &quot;Custody&quot;, alongside Viola Davis, whom she appeared with in 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Architect&quot;.

In January 2022, Panettiere briefly reprised her role as Kirby Reed in the &quot;Scream 4&quot; sequel &quot;Scream&quot; in a photograph used in the film, revealing the character to have survived the fourth film&#x27;s events. Panettiere is credited with &quot;Special Thanks&quot; for the photograph&#x27;s use as well as a voice cameo. In May 2022, it was announced Panettiere would be returning to the &quot;Scream&quot; franchise with &quot;Scream VI&quot;, in what also marks her first on-screen film appearance since 2018 after a career hiatus.

====Video games====
Panettiere voiced Kairi in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, and &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot;. She also voiced Xion in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot;. She was replaced by Alyson Stoner for the later sequel games for the series.

Panettiere voiced and modelled the character of Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Giddings for the PlayStation 4 game &quot;Until Dawn&quot;. She reprised the role for a new post-credit scene in the remake version of the game, released on PlayStation 5 and Windows.

===Singing===
Panettiere was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1999 for &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. In 2004, she recorded a song entitled &quot;My Hero Is You&quot; with a video for the Disney Channel film she starred in, &quot;Tiger Cruise&quot;, and &quot;Someone Like You&quot;, a duet with Watt White for another film, &quot;The Dust Factory&quot; (also with an accompanying video). The next year she recorded a song entitled &quot;I Fly&quot; for the Disney film &quot;Ice Princess&quot; in which she also co-starred. She recorded a song for the Hollywood Records compilation &quot;Girl Next&quot; (2006) and another song entitled &quot;Go to Girl&quot; for &quot;Girl Next 2&quot; (2007). Also in 2007, she sang the national anthem at A Capitol Fourth and recorded a cover for &quot;Cruella De Vil&quot; for &quot;Disneymania 5&quot;, &quot;Try&quot; for the &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot; soundtrack and a ballad called &quot;I Still Believe&quot; for &quot;Cinderella III: A Twist in Time&quot;.

Panettiere&#x27;s first single not associated with an acting role, the reggae-infused &quot;Wake Up Call&quot; was digitally released on August 5, 2008. The clothing brand Candie&#x27;s announced that it was premiering an ad campaign for the single in late July. Candie&#x27;s provided additional promotion for the single with a television advertisement and a music video. Sebastian Stan, who portrayed the brother of Panettiere&#x27;s character in &quot;The Architect&quot;, played her boyfriend in the video.

She has recorded several songs for &quot;Nashville&quot;, which were released as singles and included on the show&#x27;s soundtrack albums. She also made numerous concert appearances associated with the show&#x27;s touring promotion. In 2013, Panettiere recorded a version of &quot;The Fabric of My Life&quot; for a Cotton Incorporated campaign.

== Other ventures ==

===Modeling===
In late 2006, Neutrogena made Panettiere the cover girl for their new worldwide ad campaign. In September 2007, Panettiere appeared in a &quot;Heroes&quot;-themed Got Milk? ad for which the photographs were shot by Annie Leibovitz. In February 2008, Kohl&#x27;s announced that Panettiere would be their next Candie&#x27;s spokesperson. From 2007 to 2008, Panettiere designed limited edition hand bags for Dooney &amp; Bourke and modeled their bags in magazine ads.

In 2009, Panettiere was one of the celebrities featured in the coffee table book &quot;Room 23&quot;, produced by Diana Jenkins and photographed by Deborah Anderson.

=== Activism ===
In 2007, Panettiere became an official supporter of Ronald McDonald House Charities and is a member of their celebrity board, called the Friends of RMHC.

On October 31, 2007, Panettiere joined with The Whaleman Foundation to try to disrupt the annual dolphin hunt in Taiji, Wakayama, Japan. She was involved in a confrontation between Japanese fishermen and five other surfers of the group from Australia and the United States (including former &quot;Home and Away&quot; actress Isabel Lucas). The confrontation lasted more than ten minutes before the surfers were forced to return to the beach, after which they left the country. Parts of the confrontation can be seen on the award-winning Sundance Film Festival documentary film &quot;The Cove&quot;. The fishermen consider the condemnation as an attack on their culture.

On January 28, 2008, Panettiere handed a letter of protest to the Norwegian ambassador in the U.S. arguing that Norway should stop its hunt for whales. She also delivered a letter to the Japanese ambassador calling for the end of Japan&#x27;s hunting of whales. At a 2007 Greenpeace event in Anchorage, Alaska, Panettiere defended aboriginal whaling, saying that there is a difference between commercial whaling and the whaling practiced by aboriginal tribes in the U.S.

In May 2008, Panettiere was involved in an eBay auction to benefit Save the Whales Again, a campaign of The Whaleman Foundation. The auction included tickets to a fundraising dinner hosted at the Hollywood restaurant Beso, owned by Eva Longoria, and a whale watching tour, with Panettiere, off the coast of Santa Barbara. The same month, during an interview with &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;, she explained how her fame gives her a platform for her activism: &quot;The show [&quot;Heroes&quot;] put me in a place to speak for things that I&#x27;m passionate about.&quot;

In September 2008, Panettiere launched her own line of calfskin leather bags for the company Dooney &amp; Bourke. In October, she delved into the presidential election, releasing a satirical public service announcement through the website Funny or Die. In this video, Panettiere mocked Republican candidate John McCain for his age and temper. She subsequently made clear her intention to vote for Barack Obama and urged other young people to vote.

Panettiere has long supported the statehood movement in the District of Columbia. In 2008, she appeared in a public service announcement with DC Shadow Senator Paul Strauss endorsing voting rights for Washington, D.C. In 2011, DC Mayor Vincent Gray acknowledged Panettiere&#x27;s advocacy on behalf of securing full representation in Congress for District of Columbia residents by naming a day in her honor. At the ceremony, Panettiere reflected, &quot;It seems like such (an) unfathomable fact that, you know, it&#x27;s taxation without representation in D.C., and that there&#x27;s no democracy in our democracy, at the heart of it.&quot; She participated in Strauss&#x27; &quot;51 Stars&quot; campaign which aimed to get 51 celebrities to endorse making Washington, D.C., the 51st state.

She was also a teen ambassador for the Candie&#x27;s Foundation, whose mission is to prevent teen pregnancy. On May 6, 2009, she participated in a town hall meeting in New York City alongside Bristol Palin and Major League Baseball pitcher Matt Garza on the issue of teen pregnancy.

On December 6, 2013, Panettiere and her then-fiancé Wladimir Klitschko visited the Euromaidan protests in Kyiv, Ukraine. Wladimir&#x27;s brother, Vitali, was one of the leading figures of the protests.

In July 2020, Panettiere advocated for victims of domestic abuse to come forward and share their stories, specifically after she herself had gone through abuse.

==Personal life==
Panettiere began dating her &quot;Heroes&quot; co-star Milo Ventimiglia in December 2007, when she was 18 and he was 30. They broke up in February 2009.

In 2009, Panettiere met then-world heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko at the book launch party for mutual acquaintance Diana Jenkins&#x27;s &quot;Room 23&quot;, in which both Panettiere and Klitschko were featured. They soon began dating. Panettiere was ringside for Klitschko&#x27;s knockout victory over Samuel Peter on September 11, 2010. In May 2011, she announced that they had split. Both cited the long-distance nature of their relationship as the reason, and said they would remain close friends. Panettiere confirmed reports that she and Klitschko had resumed their romantic relationship in an April 2013 interview. In October 2013, she announced her engagement to Klitschko. In December 2014, Panettiere gave birth to their daughter.

In 2015, she stated that following the birth of her daughter she experienced postpartum depression. In her September 28 appearance on &quot;Live with Kelly and Michael&quot;, she said that it is &quot;scary and needs to be talked about&quot;.

In August 2018, Panettiere&#x27;s mother confirmed Panettiere and Klitschko had broken up again, remaining on friendly terms. After she broke up with Klitschko, she started dating Brian Hickerson. In 2020, they broke up after he was arrested for corporal injury on a spouse/cohabitant, assault, and intimidating a witness (Panettiere). The charges stemmed from alleged incidents between May 2019 and June 2020.

<text>In computer programming, a function object is a construct allowing an object to be invoked or called as if it were an ordinary function, usually with the same syntax (a function parameter that can also be a function). In some languages, particularly C++, function objects are often called functors (not related to the functional programming concept).

== Description ==
A typical use of a function object is in writing callback functions. A callback in procedural languages, such as C, may be performed by using function pointers. However it can be difficult or awkward to pass a state into or out of the callback function. This restriction also inhibits more dynamic behavior of the function. A function object solves those problems since the function is really a façade for a full object, carrying its own state.

Many modern (and some older) languages, e.g. C++, Eiffel, Groovy, Lisp, Smalltalk, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala, and many others, support first-class function objects and may even make significant use of them. Functional programming languages additionally support closures, i.e. first-class functions that can &#x27;close over&#x27; variables in their surrounding environment at creation time. During compilation, a transformation known as lambda lifting converts the closures into function objects.

== In C and C++ ==
Consider the example of a sorting routine that uses a callback function to define an ordering relation between a pair of items. The following C/C++ program uses function pointers:
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

/* qsort() callback function, returns &lt; 0 if a &lt; b, &gt; 0 if a &gt; b, 0 if a == b */
int compareInts(const void* a, const void* b)
 return ( *(int *)a - *(int *)b );
...
// prototype of qsort is
// void qsort(void *base, size_t nel, size_t width, int (*compar)(const void *, const void *));
int main(void)
 int items[] = { 4, 3, 1, 2 };
 qsort(items, sizeof(items) / sizeof(items[0]), sizeof(items[0]), compareInts);
 return 0;


In C++, a function object may be used instead of an ordinary function by defining a class that overloads the function call operator by defining an codice_1 member function. In C++, this may appear as follows:
// comparator predicate: returns true if a &lt; b, false otherwise
struct IntComparator
 bool operator()(const int &amp;a, const int &amp;b) const
 return a &lt; b;
};

int main()
 std::vector&lt;int&gt; items { 4, 3, 1, 2 };
 std::sort(items.begin(), items.end(), IntComparator());
 return 0;


Notice that the syntax for providing the callback to the codice_2 function is identical, but an object is passed instead of a function pointer. When invoked, the callback function is executed just as any other member function, and therefore has full access to the other members (data or functions) of the object. Of course, this is just a trivial example. To understand what power a functor provides more than a regular function, consider the common use case of sorting objects by a particular field. In the following example, a functor is used to sort a simple employee database by each employee&#x27;s ID number.
struct CompareBy
 const std::string SORT_FIELD;
 CompareBy(const std::string&amp; sort_field=&quot;name&quot;)
 : SORT_FIELD(sort_field)
 /* validate sort_field */
 
 bool operator()(const Employee&amp; a, const Employee&amp; b) const
 if (SORT_FIELD == &quot;name&quot;)
 return a.name &lt; b.name;
 else if (SORT_FIELD == &quot;age&quot;)
 return a.age &lt; b.age;
 else if (SORT_FIELD == &quot;idnum&quot;)
 return a.idnum &lt; b.idnum;
 else
 /* throw exception or something */
};

int main()
 std::vector&lt;Employee&gt; emps;
 /* code to populate database */
 // Sort the database by employee ID number
 std::sort(emps.begin(), emps.end(), CompareBy(&quot;idnum&quot;));
 return 0;


In C++11, the lambda expression provides a more succinct way to do the same thing.
int main()
 std::vector&lt;Employee&gt; emps;
 /* code to populate database */
 const std::string sort_field = &quot;idnum&quot;;
 std::sort(emps.begin(), emps.end(), [&amp;sort_field](const Employee&amp; a, const Employee&amp; b) const { /* code to select and compare field */ });
 return 0;

It is possible to use function objects in situations other than as callback functions. In this case, the shortened term &quot;functor&quot; is normally &quot;not&quot; used about the function object. Continuing the example,
IntComparator cpm;
bool result = cpm(a, b);
In addition to class type functors, other kinds of function objects are also possible in C++. They can take advantage of C++&#x27;s member-pointer or template facilities. The expressiveness of templates allows some functional programming techniques to be used, such as defining function objects in terms of other function objects (like function composition). Much of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) makes heavy use of template-based function objects.

Another way to create a function object in C++ is to define a non-explicit conversion function to a function pointer type, a function reference type, or a reference to function pointer type. Assuming the conversion does not discard cv-qualifiers, this allows an object of that type to be used as a function with the same signature as the type it is converted to. Modifying an earlier example to use this we obtain the following class, whose instances can be called like function pointers:
// comparator predicate: returns true if a &lt; b, false otherwise
struct IntComparator
 static bool compare(const int &amp;a, const int &amp;b)
 return a &lt; b;
 using T = decltype(compare);
 operator T*() const { return compare; }

int main()
 std::vector&lt;int&gt; items { 4, 3, 1, 2 };
 std::sort(items.begin(), items.end(), IntComparator());
 return 0;


=== Maintaining state ===

Another advantage of function objects is their ability to maintain a state that affects codice_1 between calls. For example, the following code defines a generator counting from 10 upwards and is invoked 11 times.
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;iterator&gt;

class CountFrom {
 public:
 CountFrom(int count) : count_(count) {}
 int operator()() { return count_++; }

 private:
 int count_;

int main() {
 const int state(10);
 std::generate_n(std::ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(std::cout, &quot;\n&quot;), 11,
 CountFrom(state));


In C++14 or later, the example above could be rewritten as:
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;iterator&gt;

int main() {
 std::generate_n(std::ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(std::cout, &quot;\n&quot;), 11,
 [count=10]() mutable { return count++; });


== In C# ==
In C#, function objects are declared via delegates. A delegate can be declared using a named method or a lambda expression. Here is an example using a named method.
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class ComparisonClass1
 public static int CompareFunction(int x, int y)
 return x - y;

 public static void Main()
 var items = new List&lt;int&gt; { 4, 3, 1, 2 };
 Comparison&lt;int&gt; del = CompareFunction;
 items.Sort(del);
}
Here is an example using a lambda expression.
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class ComparisonClass2
 public static void Main()
 var items = new List&lt;int&gt; { 4, 3, 1, 2 };
 items.Sort((x, y) =&gt; x - y);
}
== In D ==
D provides several ways to declare function objects: Lisp/Python-style via closures or C#-style via delegates, respectively:
bool find(T)(T[] haystack, bool delegate(T) needle_test) {
 foreach (straw; haystack) {
 if (needle_test(straw))
 return true;
 return false;

void main() {
 int[] haystack = [345, 15, 457, 9, 56, 123, 456];
 int needle = 123;
 bool needleTest(int n) {
 return n == needle;
 assert(find(haystack, &amp;needleTest));


The difference between a delegate and a closure in D is automatically and conservatively determined by the compiler. D also supports function literals, that allow a lambda-style definition:
void main() {
 int[] haystack = [345, 15, 457, 9, 56, 123, 456];
 int needle = 123;
 assert(find(haystack, (int n) { return n == needle; }));


To allow the compiler to inline the code (see above), function objects can also be specified C++-style via operator overloading:
bool find(T, F)(T[] haystack, F needle_test) {
 foreach (straw; haystack) {
 if (needle_test(straw))
 return true;
 return false;

void main() {
 int[] haystack = [345, 15, 457, 9, 56, 123, 456];
 int needle = 123;
 class NeedleTest {
 int needle;
 this(int n) { needle = n; }
 bool opCall(int n) {
 return n == needle;
 }
 assert(find(haystack, new NeedleTest(needle)));


== In Eiffel ==

In the Eiffel software development method and language, operations and objects are seen always as separate concepts. However, the agent mechanism facilitates the modeling of operations as runtime objects. Agents satisfy the range of application attributed to function objects, such as being passed as arguments in procedural calls or specified as callback routines. The design of the agent mechanism in Eiffel attempts to reflect the object-oriented nature of the method and language. An agent is an object that generally is a direct instance of one of the two library classes, which model the two types of routines in Eiffel: codice_4 and codice_5. These two classes descend from the more abstract codice_6.

Within software text, the language keyword codice_7 allows agents to be constructed in a compact form. In the following example, the goal is to add the action of stepping the gauge forward to the list of actions to be executed in the event that a button is clicked.
my_button.select_actions.extend (agent my_gauge.step_forward)
The routine codice_8 referenced in the example above is a feature of a class in a graphical user interface (GUI) library to provide event-driven programming capabilities.

In other library classes, agents are seen to be used for different purposes. In a library supporting data structures, for example, a class modeling linear structures effects universal quantification with a function codice_9 of type codice_10 that accepts an agent, an instance of codice_5, as an argument. So, in the following example, codice_12 is executed only if all members of codice_13 contain the character &#x27;!&#x27;:
 my_list: LINKED_LIST [STRING]
 if my_list.for_all (agent {STRING}.has (&#x27;!&#x27;)) then
 my_action
 end


When agents are created, the arguments to the routines they model and even the target object to which they are applied can be either &quot;closed&quot; or left &quot;open&quot;. Closed arguments and targets are given values at agent creation time. The assignment of values for open arguments and targets is deferred until some point after the agent is created. The routine codice_9 expects as an argument an agent representing a function with one open argument or target that conforms to actual generic parameter for the structure (codice_15 in this example.)

When the target of an agent is left open, the class name of the expected target, enclosed in braces, is substituted for an object reference as shown in the text codice_16 in the example above. When an argument is left open, the question mark character (&#x27;?&#x27;) is coded as a placeholder for the open argument.

The ability to close or leave open targets and arguments is intended to improve the flexibility of the agent mechanism. Consider a class that contains the following procedure to print a string on standard output after a new line:
 print_on_new_line (s: STRING)
 -- Print `s&#x27; preceded by a new line
 do
 print (&quot;%N&quot; + s)
 end
The following snippet, assumed to be in the same class, uses codice_17 to demonstrate the mixing of open arguments and open targets in agents used as arguments to the same routine.
 my_list: LINKED_LIST [STRING]
 my_list.do_all (agent print_on_new_line (?))
 my_list.do_all (agent {STRING}.to_lower)
 my_list.do_all (agent print_on_new_line (?))


This example uses the procedure codice_18 for linear structures, which executes the routine modeled by an agent for each item in the structure.

The sequence of three instructions prints the strings in codice_13, converts the strings to lowercase, and then prints them again.

Procedure codice_18 iterates across the structure executing the routine substituting the current item for either the open argument (in the case of the agents based on codice_17), or the open target (in the case of the agent based on codice_22).

Open and closed arguments and targets also allow the use of routines that call for more arguments than are required by closing all but the necessary number of arguments:
my_list.do_all (agent my_multi_arg_procedure (closed_arg_1, ?, closed_arg_2, closed_arg_3)
The Eiffel agent mechanism is detailed in the Eiffel ISO/ECMA standard document.

== In Java ==
Java has no first-class functions, so function objects are usually expressed by an interface with a single method (most commonly the codice_23 interface), typically with the implementation being an anonymous inner class, or, starting in Java 8, a lambda.

For an example from Java&#x27;s standard library, codice_24 takes a codice_25 and a functor whose role is to compare objects in the List. Without first-class functions, the function is part of the Comparator interface. This could be used as follows.
List&lt;String&gt; list = Arrays.asList(&quot;10&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;20&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;21&quot;, &quot;12&quot;);
Comparator&lt;String&gt; numStringComparator = new Comparator&lt;String&gt;() {
 public int compare(String str1, String str2) {
 return Integer.valueOf(str1).compareTo(Integer.valueOf(str2));
};

Collections.sort(list, numStringComparator);
In Java 8+, this can be written as:

List&lt;String&gt; list = Arrays.asList(&quot;10&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;20&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;21&quot;, &quot;12&quot;);
Comparator&lt;String&gt; numStringComparator = (str1, str2) -&gt; Integer.valueOf(str1).compareTo(Integer.valueOf(str2));

Collections.sort(list, numStringComparator);
== In JavaScript ==
In JavaScript, functions are first class objects. JavaScript also supports closures.

Compare the following with the subsequent Python example.
function Accumulator(start) {
 var current = start;
 return function (x) {
 return current += x;
}
An example of this in use:
var a = Accumulator(4);
var x = a(5); // x has value 9
x = a(2); // x has value 11

var b = Accumulator(42);
x = b(7); // x has value 49 (current = 49 in closure b)
x = a(7); // x has value 18 (current = 18 in closure a)
== In Julia ==
In Julia, methods are associated with types, so it is possible to make any arbitrary Julia object &quot;callable&quot; by adding methods to its type. (Such &quot;callable&quot; objects are sometimes called &quot;functors.&quot;)

An example is this accumulator mutable struct (based on Paul Graham&#x27;s study on programming language syntax and clarity):
julia&gt; mutable struct Accumulator
 n::Int
 end

julia&gt; function (acc::Accumulator)(n2)
 acc.n += n2
 end

julia&gt; a = Accumulator(4)
Accumulator(4)

julia&gt; a(5)
9

julia&gt; a(2)
11

julia&gt; b = Accumulator(42)
Accumulator(42)

julia&gt; b(7)
49
Such an accumulator can also be implemented using closure:
julia&gt; function Accumulator(n0)
 n = n0
 function(n2)
 n += n2
 end
 end
Accumulator (generic function with 1 method)

julia&gt; a = Accumulator(4)
(::#1) (generic function with 1 method)

julia&gt; a(5)
9

julia&gt; a(2)
11

julia&gt; b = Accumulator(42)
(::#1) (generic function with 1 method)

julia&gt; b(7)
49
== In Lisp and Scheme ==
In Lisp family languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, and others, functions are objects, just like strings, vectors, lists, and numbers. A closure-constructing operator creates a &quot;function object&quot; from a part of the program: the part of code given as an argument to the operator is part of the function, and so is the lexical environment: the bindings of the lexically visible variables are &quot;captured&quot; and stored in the function object, which is more commonly called a closure. The captured bindings play the role of &quot;member variables&quot;, and the code part of the closure plays the role of the &quot;anonymous member function&quot;, just like operator () in C++.

The closure constructor has the syntax codice_26. The codice_27 part allows an interface to be declared, so that the function takes the declared parameters. The codice_28 part consists of expressions that are evaluated when the functor is called.

Many uses of functors in languages like C++ are simply emulations of the missing closure constructor. Since the programmer cannot directly construct a closure, they must define a class that has all of the necessary state variables, and also a member function. Then, construct an instance of that class instead, ensuring that all the member variables are initialized through its constructor. The values are derived precisely from those local variables that ought to be captured directly by a closure.

A function-object using the class system in Common Lisp, no use of closures:
(defclass counter ()
 ((value :initarg :value :accessor value-of)))

(defmethod functor-call ((c counter))
 (incf (value-of c)))

(defun make-counter (initial-value)
 (make-instance &#x27;counter :value initial-value))

;;; use the counter:
(defvar *c* (make-counter 10))
(functor-call *c*) --&gt; 11
(functor-call *c*) --&gt; 12
Since there is no standard way to make funcallable objects in Common Lisp, we fake it by defining a generic function called FUNCTOR-CALL. This can be specialized for any class whatsoever. The standard FUNCALL function is not generic; it only takes function objects.

It is this FUNCTOR-CALL generic function that gives us function objects, which are &quot;a computer programming construct allowing an object to be invoked or called as if it were an ordinary function, usually with the same syntax.&quot; We have &quot;almost&quot; the same syntax: FUNCTOR-CALL instead of FUNCALL. Some Lisps provide &quot;funcallable&quot; objects as a simple extension. Making objects callable using the same syntax as functions is a fairly trivial business. Making a function call operator work with different kinds of &quot;function things&quot;, whether they be class objects or closures is no more complicated than making a + operator that works with different kinds of numbers, such as integers, reals or complex numbers.

Now, a counter implemented using a closure. This is much more brief and direct. The INITIAL-VALUE argument of the MAKE-COUNTER factory function is captured and used directly. It does not have to be copied into some auxiliary class object through a constructor. It &quot;is&quot; the counter. An auxiliary object is created, but that happens &quot;behind the scenes&quot;.
(defun make-counter (value)
 (lambda () (incf value)))

;;; use the counter
(defvar *c* (make-counter 10))
(funcall *c*) ; --&gt; 11
(funcall *c*) ; --&gt; 12
Scheme makes closures even simpler, and Scheme code tends to use such higher-order programming somewhat more idiomatically.
(define (make-counter value)
 (lambda () (set! value (+ value 1)) value))
;;; use the counter
(define c (make-counter 10))
(c) ; --&gt; 11
(c) ; --&gt; 12
More than one closure can be created in the same lexical environment. A vector of closures, each implementing a specific kind of operation, can quite faithfully emulate an object that has a set of virtual operations. That type of single dispatch object-oriented programming can be done fully with closures.

Thus there exists a kind of tunnel being dug from both sides of the proverbial mountain. Programmers in OOP languages discover function objects by restricting objects to have one &quot;main&quot; function to &quot;do&quot; that object&#x27;s functional purpose, and even eliminate its name so that it looks like the object is being called! While programmers who use closures are not surprised that an object is called like a function, they discover that multiple closures sharing the same environment can provide a complete set of abstract operations like a virtual table for single dispatch type OOP.

== In Objective-C ==

In Objective-C, a function object can be created from the codice_29 class. Construction of a function object requires a method signature, the target object, and the target selector. Here is an example for creating an invocation to the current object&#x27;s codice_30:
// Construct a function object
SEL sel = @selector(myMethod);
NSInvocation* inv = [NSInvocation invocationWithMethodSignature:
 [self methodSignatureForSelector:sel]];
[inv setTarget:self];
[inv setSelector:sel];

// Do the actual invocation
[inv invoke];
An advantage of codice_29 is that the target object can be modified after creation. A single codice_29 can be created and then called for each of any number of targets, for instance from an observable object. An codice_29 can be created from only a protocol, but it is not straightforward. See here.

== In Perl ==

In Perl, a function object can be created either from a class&#x27;s constructor returning a function closed over the object&#x27;s instance data, blessed into the class:
package Acc1;
sub new {
 my $class = shift;
 my $arg = shift;
 my $obj = sub {
 my $num = shift;
 $arg += $num;
 bless $obj, $class;
1;
or by overloading the codice_34 operator so that the object can be used as a function:
package Acc2;
use overload
 sub {
 my $self = shift;
 sub {
 my $num = shift;
 $self-&gt;{arg} += $num;
 };

sub new {
 my $class = shift;
 my $arg = shift;
 my $obj = { arg =&gt; $arg };
 bless $obj, $class;
1;
In both cases the function object can be used either using the dereferencing arrow syntax &quot;$ref-&gt;(@arguments)&quot;:
use Acc1;
my $a = Acc1-&gt;new(42);
print $a-&gt;(10), &quot;\n&quot;; # prints 52
print $a-&gt;(8), &quot;\n&quot;; # prints 60

or using the coderef dereferencing syntax &quot;&amp;$ref(@arguments)&quot;:

use Acc2;
my $a = Acc2-&gt;new(12);
print &amp;$a(10), &quot;\n&quot;; # prints 22
print &amp;$a(8), &quot;\n&quot;; # prints 30
== In PHP ==

PHP 5.3+ has first-class functions that can be used e.g. as parameter to the function:
$a = array(3, 1, 4);
usort($a, function ($x, $y) { return $x - $y; });
PHP 5.3+, supports also lambda functions and closures. 
function Accumulator($start)
 $current = $start;
 return function($x) use(&amp;$current)
 return $current += $x;
}
An example of this in use:
$a = Accumulator(4);
$x = $a(5);
echo &quot;x = $x&lt;br/&gt;&quot;; // x = 9
$x = $a(2);
echo &quot;x = $x&lt;br/&gt;&quot;; // x = 11
It is also possible in PHP 5.3+ to make objects invokable by adding a magic method to their class:
class Minus
 public function __invoke($x, $y)
 return $x - $y;
}

$a = array(3, 1, 4);
usort($a, new Minus());
== In PowerShell ==

In the Windows PowerShell language, a script block is a collection of statements or expressions that can be used as a single unit. A script block can accept arguments and return values. A script block is an instance of a Microsoft .NET Framework type System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock.
Function Get-Accumulator($x) {
 param($y)
 return $x += $y
 }.GetNewClosure()


PS C:\&gt; $a = Get-Accumulator 4
PS C:\&gt; &amp; $a 5
9
PS C:\&gt; &amp; $a 2
11
PS C:\&gt; $b = Get-Accumulator 32
PS C:\&gt; &amp; $b 10
42
== In Python ==
In Python, functions are first-class objects, just like strings, numbers, lists etc. This feature eliminates the need to write a function object in many cases. Any object with a codice_35 method can be called using function-call syntax.

An example is this accumulator class (based on Paul Graham&#x27;s study on programming language syntax and clarity):
class Accumulator:
 def __init__(self, n) -&gt; None:
 self.n = n

 def __call__(self, x):
 self.n += x
 return self.n
An example of this in use (using the interactive interpreter):
»&gt; a = Accumulator(4)
»&gt; a(5)
9
»&gt; a(2)
11
»&gt; b = Accumulator(42)
»&gt; b(7)
49
Since functions are objects, they can also be defined locally, given attributes, and returned by other functions, as demonstrated in the following example:
def Accumulator(n):
 def inc(x):
 nonlocal n
 n += x
 return n
 return inc
== In Ruby ==
In Ruby, several objects can be considered function objects, in particular Method and Proc objects. Ruby also has two kinds of objects that can be thought of as semi-function objects: UnboundMethod and block. UnboundMethods must first be bound to an object (thus becoming a Method) before they can be used as a function object. Blocks can be called like function objects, but to be used in any other capacity as an object (e.g. passed as an argument) they must first be converted to a Proc. More recently, symbols (accessed via the literal unary indicator codice_36) can also be converted to codice_37s. Using Ruby&#x27;s unary codice_38 operator—equivalent to calling codice_39 on an object, and assuming that method exists—the Ruby Extensions Project created a simple hack.
class Symbol
 def to_proc
 proc { |obj, *args| obj.send(self, *args) }
 end
end
Now, method codice_40 can be a function object, i.e. a codice_37, via codice_42 and used via codice_43. codice_44 was officially added to Ruby on June 11, 2006 during RubyKaigi2006. 

Because of the variety of forms, the term Functor is not generally used in Ruby to mean a Function object.
Just a type of dispatch delegation introduced by the Ruby Facets project is named as Functor. The most basic definition of which is:
class Functor
 def initialize(&amp;func)
 @func = func
 end
 def method_missing(op, *args, &amp;blk)
 @func.call(op, *args, &amp;blk)
 end
end
This usage is more akin to that used by functional programming languages, like ML, and the original mathematical terminology.

== Other meanings ==

In a more theoretical context a &quot;function object&quot; may be considered to be any instance of the class of functions, especially in languages such as Common Lisp in which functions are first-class objects.

The ML family of functional programming languages uses the term &quot;functor&quot; to represent a mapping from modules to modules, or from types to types and is a technique for reusing code. Functors used in this manner are analogous to the original mathematical meaning of functor in category theory, or to the use of generic programming in C++, Java or Ada.

In Haskell, the term &quot;functor&quot; is also used for a concept related to the meaning of &quot;functor&quot; in category theory.

In Prolog and related languages, &quot;functor&quot; is a synonym for function symbol.

<text>A function pointer, also called a subroutine pointer or procedure pointer, is a pointer referencing executable code, rather than data. Dereferencing the function pointer yields the referenced function, which can be invoked and passed arguments just as in a normal function call. Such an invocation is also known as an &quot;indirect&quot; call, because the function is being invoked &quot;indirectly&quot; through a variable instead of &quot;directly&quot; through a fixed identifier or address.

Function pointers allow different code to be executed at runtime. They can also be passed to a function to enable callbacks.

Function pointers are supported by third-generation programming languages (such as PL/I, COBOL, Fortran, dBASE dBL, and C) and object-oriented programming languages (such as C++, C#, and D).

==Simple function pointers==
The simplest implementation of a function (or subroutine) pointer is as a variable containing the address of the function within executable memory. Older third-generation languages such as PL/I and COBOL, as well as more modern languages such as Pascal and C generally implement function pointers in this manner.

=== Example in C ===

The following C program illustrates the use of two function pointers:
* &quot;func1&quot; takes one double-precision (double) parameter and returns another double, and is assigned to a function which converts centimeters to inches.
* &quot;func2&quot; takes a pointer to a constant character array as well as an integer and returns a pointer to a character, and is assigned to a C string handling function which returns a pointer to the first occurrence of a given character in a character array.
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; /* for printf */
#include &lt;string.h&gt; /* for strchr */

double cm_to_inches(double cm) {
 return cm / 2.54;

// &quot;strchr&quot; is part of the C string handling (i.e., no need for declaration)
// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_string_handling#Functions

int main(void) {
 double (*func1)(double) = cm_to_inches;
 char * (*func2)(const char *, int) = strchr;
 printf(&quot;%f %s&quot;, func1(15.0), func2(&quot;Wikipedia&quot;, &#x27;p&#x27;));
 /* prints &quot;5.905512 pedia&quot; */
 return 0;


The next program uses a function pointer to invoke one of two functions (codice_1 or codice_2) indirectly from another function (codice_3, computing an approximation of the function&#x27;s Riemann integration). The program operates by having function codice_4 call function codice_3 twice, passing it a pointer to the library function codice_1 the first time, and a pointer to function codice_2 the second time. Function codice_3 in turn invokes one of the two functions indirectly by dereferencing its function pointer argument codice_9 multiple times, adding together the values that the invoked function returns and returning the resulting sum. The two sums are written to the standard output by codice_4.
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

// Function taking a function pointer as an argument
double compute_sum(double (*funcp)(double), double lo, double hi) {
 double sum = 0.0;

 // Add values returned by the pointed-to function &#x27;*funcp&#x27;
 int i;
 for (i = 0; i &lt;= 100; i++) {
 // Use the function pointer &#x27;funcp&#x27; to invoke the function
 double x = i / 100.0 * (hi - lo) + lo;
 double y = funcp(x);
 sum += y;
 return sum / 101.0 * (hi - lo);

double square(double x) {
 return x * x;

int main(void) {
 double sum;

 // Use standard library function &#x27;sin()&#x27; as the pointed-to function
 sum = compute_sum(sin, 0.0, 1.0);
 printf(&quot;sum(sin): %g\n&quot;, sum);

 // Use standard library function &#x27;cos()&#x27; as the pointed-to function
 sum = compute_sum(cos, 0.0, 1.0);
 printf(&quot;sum(cos): %g\n&quot;, sum);

 // Use user-defined function &#x27;square()&#x27; as the pointed-to function
 sum = compute_sum(square, 0.0, 1.0);
 printf(&quot;sum(square): %g\n&quot;, sum);

 return 0;


==Functors==

Functors, or function objects, are similar to function pointers, and can be used in similar ways. A functor is an object of a class type that implements the function-call operator, allowing the object to be used within expressions using the same syntax as a function call. Functors are more powerful than simple function pointers, being able to contain their own data values, and allowing the programmer to emulate closures. They are also used as callback functions if it is necessary to use a member function as a callback function.

Many &quot;pure&quot; object-oriented languages do not support function pointers. Something similar can be implemented in these kinds of languages, though, using references to interfaces that define a single method (member function). CLI languages such as C# and Visual Basic .NET implement type-safe function pointers with delegates.

In other languages that support first-class functions, functions are regarded as data, and can be passed, returned, and created dynamically directly by other functions, eliminating the need for function pointers.

Extensively using function pointers to call functions may produce a slow-down for the code on modern processors, because a branch predictor may not be able to figure out where to branch to (it depends on the value of the function pointer at run time) although this effect can be overstated as it is often amply compensated for by significantly reduced non-indexed table lookups.

==Method pointers==
C++ includes support for object-oriented programming, so classes can have methods (usually referred to as member functions). Non-static member functions (instance methods) have an implicit parameter (the &quot;this&quot; pointer) which is the pointer to the object it is operating on, so the type of the object must be included as part of the type of the function pointer. The method is then used on an object of that class by using one of the &quot;pointer-to-member&quot; operators: codice_11 or codice_12 (for an object or a pointer to object, respectively).

Although function pointers in C and C++ can be implemented as simple addresses, so that typically codice_13, member pointers in C++ are sometimes implemented as &quot;fat pointers&quot;, typically two or three times the size of a simple function pointer, in order to deal with virtual methods and virtual inheritance.

== In C++ ==
In C++, in addition to the method used in C, it is also possible to use the C++ standard library class template , of which the instances are function objects:
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;functional&gt;
using namespace std;

static double derivative(const function&lt;double(double)&gt; &amp;f, double x0, double eps) {
 double eps2 = eps / 2;
 double lo = x0 - eps2;
 double hi = x0 + eps2;
 return (f(hi) - f(lo)) / eps;

static double f(double x) {
 return x * x;

int main() {
 double x = 1;
 cout « &quot;d/dx(x ^ 2) [@ x = &quot; « x « &quot;] = &quot; « derivative(f, x, 1e-5) « endl;
 return 0;


=== Pointers to member functions in C++ ===

This is how C++ uses function pointers when dealing with member functions of classes or structs. These are invoked using an object pointer or a this call. They are type safe in that you can only call members of that class (or derivatives) using a pointer of that type. This example also demonstrates the use of a typedef for the pointer to member function added for simplicity. Function pointers to static member functions are done in the traditional &#x27;C&#x27; style because there is no object pointer for this call required.
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class Foo {

public:
 int add(int i, int j) {
 return i+j;
 int mult(int i, int j) {
 return i*j;
 static int negate(int i) {
 return -i;
};

int bar1(int i, int j, Foo* pFoo, int(Foo::*pfn)(int,int)) {
 return (pFoo-&gt;*pfn)(i,j);

typedef int(Foo::*Foo_pfn)(int,int);

int bar2(int i, int j, Foo* pFoo, Foo_pfn pfn) {
 return (pFoo-&gt;*pfn)(i,j);

typedef auto(*PFN)(int) -&gt; int;
// C++ only, same as: typedef int(*PFN)(int);

int bar3(int i, PFN pfn) {
 return pfn(i);

int main() {
 Foo foo;
 cout « &quot;Foo::add(2,4) = &quot; « bar1(2,4, &amp;foo, &amp;Foo::add) « endl;
 cout « &quot;Foo::mult(3,5) = &quot; « bar2(3,5, &amp;foo, &amp;Foo::mult) « endl;
 cout « &quot;Foo::negate(6) = &quot; « bar3(6, &amp;Foo::negate) « endl;
 return 0;


== Alternate C and C++ syntax ==
The C and C++ syntax given above is the canonical one used in all the textbooks - but it&#x27;s difficult to read and explain. Even the above codice_14 examples use this syntax. However, every C and C++ compiler supports a more clear and concise mechanism to declare function pointers: use codice_14, but &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; store the pointer as part of the definition. Note that the only way this kind of codice_14 can actually be used is with a pointer - but that highlights the pointer-ness of it.

=== C and C++ ===

// This declares &#x27;F&#x27;, a function that accepts a &#x27;char&#x27; and returns an &#x27;int&#x27;. Definition is elsewhere.
int F(char c);

// This defines &#x27;Fn&#x27;, a type of function that accepts a &#x27;char&#x27; and returns an &#x27;int&#x27;.
typedef int Fn(char c);

// This defines &#x27;fn&#x27;, a variable of type pointer-to-&#x27;Fn&#x27;, and assigns the address of &#x27;F&#x27; to it.
Fn *fn = &amp;F; // Note &#x27;&amp;&#x27; not required - but it highlights what is being done.

// This calls &#x27;F&#x27; using &#x27;fn&#x27;, assigning the result to the variable &#x27;a&#x27;
int a = fn(&#x27;A&#x27;);

// This defines &#x27;Call&#x27;, a function that accepts a pointer-to-&#x27;Fn&#x27;, calls it, and returns the result
int Call(Fn *fn, char c) {
 return fn(c);
} // Call(fn, c)

// This calls function &#x27;Call&#x27;, passing in &#x27;F&#x27; and assigning the result to &#x27;call&#x27;
int call = Call(&amp;F, &#x27;A&#x27;); // Again, &#x27;&amp;&#x27; is not required

// LEGACY: Note that to maintain existing code bases, the above definition style can still be used first;
// then the original type can be defined in terms of it using the new style.

// This defines &#x27;PFn&#x27;, a type of pointer-to-type-Fn.
typedef Fn *PFn;

// &#x27;PFn&#x27; can be used wherever &#x27;Fn *&#x27; can
PFn pfn = F;
int CallP(PFn fn, char c);
=== C++ ===
These examples use the above definitions. In particular, note that the above definition for codice_17 can be used in pointer-to-member-function definitions:

// This defines &#x27;C&#x27;, a class with similar static and member functions,
// and then creates an instance called &#x27;c&#x27;
class C {
public:
static int Static(char c);
int Member(char c);
} c; // C

// This defines &#x27;p&#x27;, a pointer to &#x27;C&#x27; and assigns the address of &#x27;c&#x27; to it
C *p = &amp;c;

// This assigns a pointer-to-&#x27;Static&#x27; to &#x27;fn&#x27;.
// Since there is no &#x27;this&#x27;, &#x27;Fn&#x27; is the correct type; and &#x27;fn&#x27; can be used as above.
fn = &amp;C::Static;

// This defines &#x27;m&#x27;, a pointer-to-member-of-&#x27;C&#x27; with type &#x27;Fn&#x27;,
// and assigns the address of &#x27;C::Member&#x27; to it.
// You can read it right-to-left like all pointers:
// &quot;&#x27;m&#x27; is a pointer to member of class &#x27;C&#x27; of type &#x27;Fn&#x27;&quot;
Fn C::*m = &amp;C::Member;

// This uses &#x27;m&#x27; to call &#x27;Member&#x27; in &#x27;c&#x27;, assigning the result to &#x27;cA&#x27;
int cA = (c.*m)(&#x27;A&#x27;);

// This uses &#x27;m&#x27; to call &#x27;Member&#x27; in &#x27;p&#x27;, assigning the result to &#x27;pA&#x27;
int pA = (p-&gt;*m)(&#x27;A&#x27;);

// This defines &#x27;Ref&#x27;, a function that accepts a reference-to-&#x27;C&#x27;,
// a pointer-to-member-of-&#x27;C&#x27; of type &#x27;Fn&#x27;, and a &#x27;char&#x27;,

<text>United State of Electronica, or U.S.E., is an American music group formed in 2002 based in Seattle, Washington. It includes the four members of the band Wonderful: Jason Holstrom (guitar, vocals), Jon e. Rock (drums, vocals), Peter Sali (guitar, vocals), and Noah Star Weaver (keyboards, vocoder), as well as Derek Chan (bass guitar), Carly Nicklaus (vocals), and Amanda Khanjian (vocals).

==History==
U.S.E. was formed when the members of Wonderful and Shane Tutmarc posed as an imaginary electronica band from Mannheim, Germany at a Seattle-area nightclub. When the group noticed the audience&#x27;s enthusiasm about their improvised dance songs, they decided to form a side project that would take dance music more seriously. Carly Nicklaus, Amanda Okonek and Derek Chan joined the members of Wonderful to develop that project, which would become the United State of Electronica.

U.S.E. released its debut self-titled, self-recorded album with handpainted covers in 2004. With no distribution, U.S.E turned to the Internet and gave the album to the world for free via http://www.mannheimworldwide.com. The album was released nationally through Sonic Boom Recordings in early 2005 and released in Japan in 2005 on Side-Out Records. U.S.E continued to tour the U.S. extensively with The Presidents of the United States of America, Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, The Hold Steady, Aqueduct, Schoolyard Heroes, The Divorce and many more. After &quot;IT IS ON!&quot; reached No. 4 on the Japanese music charts, U.S.E made three trips to Japan in 2005, including the 2005 Fuji Rock Festival and played the Sasquatch! Music Festival in Central Washington.

After another trip to Japan and tours to SXSW in 2006 and 2007, the U.S.E. album was again re-released in the U.K. by The Original Electronic Recording Company.

U.S.E&#x27;s second full length &quot;LOVEWORLD&quot; was recorded in Seattle at Avast! Recording studios with engineer Cameron Nicklaus and with U.S.E at the Cabana. The songs &quot;All The World&quot;, &quot;Get That Feeling&quot;, &quot;River of Love&quot;, live favorites &quot;Dance With Me&quot; and &quot;Party People&quot; are among others to be on the new LP. It was released on August 26, 2009.

Their song &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; was used at E3 2008 for the New Xbox Experience Promo.

After more than 10 years of silence, the entire band came together to play a New Years Eve show at the end of 2019, along with Aqueduct and 52 kings.

<text>The École Supérieure des Sciences Economiques et Commerciales, more commonly known as ESSEC Business School or simply ESSEC, is a business school and &quot;grande école&quot; based in France. Founded in 1907, its main campus is located in Cergy in the île-de-France region but also has locations in La Défense, Rabat, and Singapore, which are used in particular for the ESSEC Global BBA and ESSEC Executive MBA programs.

Founded by Jesuits in response to the creation of HEC Paris, it remained independent of any chamber of commerce and industry before 1981. It was then under the control of the Versailles, which became the CCI of Paris Île-de-France in 2013. Today, ESSEC is a member of the CY Alliance, formerly the Université Paris-Seine.

The ESSEC group delivers numerous training courses in administration and management through its post-preparatory class course called the &quot;Grande École Program&quot; conferring a master&#x27;s degree. Moreover, it offers a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) through the ESSEC Global BBA program, a specialized masters (SM), a master&#x27;s degree in business administration (MBA), and doctorates.

The historical rival of HEC Paris and ESCP Business School, ESSEC forms the group the &quot;three Parisians&quot; designating the three most prestigious business schools in France.

== History ==

=== Foundation (1907–1913) ===
The École Supérieure des Sciences Economiques et Commerciales (ESSEC) was founded in 1907 under the name of &quot;Economic Institute&quot; by Ferdinand Le Pelletier in Paris. Its creation followed the movement of other private business schools created under Catholic guardianship in the early twentieth century such as HEC Nord (which later became EDHEC) by the Catholic Institute of Lille or ESSCA by the Institute Catholic of Angers.

The establishment of Falloux Laws in 1854 allowed the development of religious secondary education. Following the Dreyfus affair (1895) and the law of separation of Church and State (1905), the Church sought to regain influence, in particular by disseminating its moral values in the economic world and by training a new generation of business leaders. ESSEC became the Catholic Church response to the creation of HEC in the context of struggle of religious congregations, especially between Jesuits against the secular and republican ideology of the state. The goal of the new institution was to &quot;train leaders for a commercial and economic career, which requires competent men, imbued with Christian and human values&quot;. The school was located at the École Sainte Geneviève (created by Jesuits in 1854) in the Latin Quarter. The first class had seven students and studies lasted two years. In 1909, an optional third year was introduced.

The original course was structured around general subjects including law, accounting, languages and techniques. With the introduction of Christian moral values students began to attend the apologetics conference every week in the chapel of the École Sainte Geneviève. Technical education (calligraphy, shorthand, drafting of commercial documents) was complemented with scientific education (physics, chemistry, factory visits).

=== 1913–1940 ===
With the application of the law of separation of State and Church of 1905, the school premises were confiscated in 1913, obliging ESSEC to be absorbed by Catholic Institute of Paris or ICP. As a consequence, the school resources were significantly reduced. For instance, it only had one amphitheater borrowed from ICP and the elementary section was abolished. During this time, the disciplines taught, which remained the close standard until 1960, including: languages, history of trade, commercial geography, political economy, law and accounting. An emphasis was given to language teaching, with a duration of 10 hours per week (4 hours of English and German, 1 hour of Italian and Spanish).

The school experienced difficulty surviving during the First World War. In 1914, it had only four students in the first year and two in the second year. It temporarily closed its doors and only reopened in 1915. The third optional year was dropped, and the school did not regain financial stability until 1920 when it welcomed more than 50 students in the first year. In 1923, the students&#x27; association was created with a solidarity fund for war widows and orphans. In 1926, the first directory of graduates was published and three years later, the first courses in business ethics were given. By 1930, the number of students increased to 150 people.

Against the crisis of the 1930s, ESSEC had to reduce its tuition fees to attract students who had preferences toward public service or regular law studies. Due to the gap years of 1914-1918 and the economic crisis, the situation became even more difficult. The school was forced to accept high school graduates, uncertified examiners, and even freelance auditors who took uncertified courses.

In 1932, the Student Office was created and in 1937, the first scholarships were distributed, marking the start of a social assistance policy

=== 1940–1960 ===
The reform was done under the effort of Camille Donjon from 1939, with the introduction of selection at the school entrance. A preparatory class for the exam was set up in 1941. During this time, ESSEC refused to join the unified system of &quot;écoles de commerce&quot; established by the decree of 3 December 1947 which mentioned that the State now supports the implementation of preparatory classes on the territory.

As HEC and ESCP joined this system, ESSEC positioned itself as a challenger and kept its own preparatory classes. To level its competition, ESSEC altered its school tenure from two to three years starting from 1947. This lasted until 1951, when ESSEC closed its own preparatory classes and opened to candidates of public preparatory classes. In 1950, the first compulsory internship was set up, lasted for a period of three months and took place at the end of studies.

=== 1960–1970 ===
In 1960, Gilbert Olivier replaced Father Donjon as the dean of ESSEC. His arrival, coupled with developments linked to competition, would sway the Christian identity of the school. He began the transformation by launching a survey for students on the content of courses and the pedagogy. The result showed that only minority of students were satisfied with the teaching. Teaching was judged &quot;Scholarly, serious and lacking in openness&quot;.

Given the results of this survey, a gradual reform was put in place. Technical subjects such as chemistry and physics were abandoned, teaching content adapted to the company demand and the human factor was taken into account with the introduction of courses in sociology and human resources. In 1965, marketing classes was introduced. Diverse methods of teaching such as conferences were set up, similar to what HEC Paris and Sciences Po offered. During this time, the school adopted the teaching style of United States schools. Furthermore, the recruitment was diversified with the introduction of the &quot;Admis on Title&quot; in 1966, which also marked the opening of the school to women. However, preparatory classes were not yet being open to women students.

Associative life also began in the early 1960s with the creation of the &quot;ESSEC Mardis&quot; in 1961 and the &quot;Junior Enterprise&quot; in 1967. The former is a student forum of ESSEC which occasionally invited speakers from French art, sports, politics and economic spaces every year. It also hosted debates led by two students from the association.

The entrance exam was reformatted in 1969, with the elimination of the chemistry and physics test and remodeling of the oral exam which now aimed to test the logical reasoning of the candidates and not only their general knowledge. Psychometric tests and personality interviews were also introduced. Gilbert Olivier also tried to reform the program of preparatory classes to bring them closer to commercial education but gave up due to opposition from HEC and other business schools.

=== 1970–1990 ===

With the reform in place, the number of students grew, and the school was starting to run out of space. The school occupied three amphitheaters at the ICP and later, in 1971, administrative services would be moved to Raspail Boulevard. In 1965, a commission was set up to consider the possibilities of moving the school to a new location. Projects were planned in Bagneux or Gentilly, which were ultimately abandoned. On 5 July 1967, a decision was taken by ESSEC to move to a new site in the town of Cergy-Pontoise where the current campus is located.

During this time, ESSEC was able to break free from the ICP. In 1968, the latter recognized the financial and administrative independence of the school. In 1969, the ESSEC group was founded, consisting of the school, CERESSEC, a Research Center and ISSEC, an institute for executives. ICP, however, retained one third of the seats of the Board of Directors and the appointment of the director of the school must still be approved by the rector of the ICP.

The acceptance of the move to Cergy-Pontoise by the community was polarized. It was less well received by students due to lack of public transportation to the area. Some teachers fueled the controversy, aware that such a move would entail a potential replacement of faculty members. The new school extended and included a large amphitheater of 300 seats, eight small amphitheatres with 80 seats equipped with closed circuit television, a computer center, a large language laboratory, a library, a sports hall, a restaurant university and 48 classrooms. Its reception areas (foyers, cafeterias, and chapel) were to be available to the public in Cergy. In exchange, the students could live in housing around the city.

Before 1971, ESSEC relied mainly on executives working in companies as its teaching staff. However, the school started to set up its permanent faculty. The grants awarded by FNEGE to finance studies of young professors or executives in the United States, who wished to return to teaching to fill the French &quot;management gap&quot;, allowed ESSEC to build a pool of qualified teachers. In 1972, out of 20 professors, there were 9 former ESSECs who completed their training in the United States. The arrival of FNEGE Fellows, who had come back from the United States, would stimulate a reform in curriculum. A common core curriculum was set up in the first year and was based on fundamentals while a course &quot;à la carte&quot; was introduced from the second year. This format is still in effect today. A minimum duration of 12 months of internship was also introduced. Furthermore, the ESSEC selectivity increased significantly when application numbers grew from 700 candidates in 1960, to 2,800 in 1973.

The decision to move to Cergy without support of public funds resulted in heavy debt to the Caisse d&#x27;Epargne and ANFESP (National Association for the Financing of Private School Equipment), the Council General of Val d&#x27;Oise. This resulted in an obligation to repay an amount up to 4-5 million francs a year. These financial expenses represented 11.7% of the ESSEC budget in 1975 (compared to 5% for INSEAD). The operating budget exploded from 6 million francs in 1972 to 28 million in 1979. At one point, tuition fees increased until it doubled that of HEC. In 1979, the financial crisis erupted, exacerbated by an environment of high interest rates and an economic slowdown related to the oil shock. Ultimately, the school hit a deficit of 10.4 million francs during this year. The apprenticeship tax, introduction of continuing education and the donation of student&#x27;s parents were used as sources of funding. The consideration of the nationalization of ESSEC and possible attachment to the larger university were put on the table, with those ideas coming within the field of possibilities with the election of François Mitterrand to the presidency of the Republic.

Gilbert Olivier strongly opposed the plan, seeing it as a failure of the initial project of the school to emancipate itself from the higher education system. Financial conditions ultimately improved, permitting the school to operate without taking such actions. The rescue was made possible by the Versailles Chamber of Commerce, which injected 10 million francs to cover the deficit of ESSEC, bought 51% of ESSEC&#x27;s ownership for 12 million francs and committed to pay an annual subsidy of 6 million of francs from 1982 to 1989. In exchange, ESSEC retained its legal autonomy (and did not become a service of the chamber like the case of HEC Paris and ESCP with the Paris Chamber of Commerce), but had a governance system with a management board and supervisory board. This intrusion of supervision as well as the absence of representation of the students and the professors in the general assembly triggered strikes and the launching of petitions against the plan. The agreement was finally signed on 6 April 1981. The fear of control of the school and its pedagogy would ultimately prove to be unfounded.

=== 2000–present ===
In 1999, the school decided to rename Grande Ecole program as an MBA (Master of Business Administration), an Anglo-Saxon standard normally reserved for executives who already have many years of experience. ESSEC intended to highlight its accreditation from the AACSB (American accreditation body) and the mandatory 18 months of internships of its students. The move was followed by other business schools, such as ICN Nancy and ESC Grenoble. ESSEC then reviewed its international agreements to bring the program to the MBA or Master level.

The repositioning of the program was heavily criticized by HEC Paris, EM Lyon and Université Paris-Dauphine, so much so that Ali Laïdi in his book” Secrets of the Economic War” (2004) said that HEC Paris would have mounted a destabilization operation toward ESSEC by attacking its MBA position. The case led to an opening of an investigation and resolution by the Paris Chamber of Commerce.

In 2005, ESSEC expanded its campus with the inauguration of the Nautile building and further, in 2007, with the multipurpose room, the Dome, which has a capacity of 2,700 people, and the Galion. The buildings were designed by Marc Seifert, son of Ivan Seifert who designed the original campus in 1973. In 2008, the library was expanded. Renovation of the restaurant area followed the following year.

In March 2006, ESSEC Business School inaugurated its new campus in Singapore within the National Library, the ESSEC Asian Center.

In 2010, ESSEC presented its strategic plan for 2010–2015. The program portfolio was repositioned: the EPSCI (post-baccalaureate program) became the bachelor of ESSEC, the name of MBA was abandoned and replaced with MSc in Management. The group&#x27;s communication was unified under the name ESSEC Business School. A fundraising strategy of 150 million euros was announced. The school also aimed to be one of the 20 best Business Schools in the world, to join the 10 best schools in Asia and to make it into the top 5 in Europe. The abandonment of the name of MBA from its Grand Ecole program was a strategy pushback for the school. As a result, this program did not appear in the Financial Times ranking of Masters in Management since its creation in 2005, nor in the MBA because of its hybrid nature. The dean of the time, Pierre Tapie, however, did not regret this decision, because he believed that the school had gained reputation. In fact, in 2007, the Wall Street Journal ranked ESSEC Grande École program 7th in the world, ahead of HEC and INSEAD.

During this time, the school expanded its double-degree agreements with the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad in 2006, Centrale Paris, University of Keio in 2009, École du Louvre, ENSAE and Saint-Cyr in 2010, ENS in 2011, University of Queensland, three South Korean institutions in 2014 and Bocconi University in 2015.

In 2014, Jean-Michel Blanquer, the new dean of the school, announced the strategic plan &quot;ESSEC 3I 2020&quot; (Internationalisation, Innovation and Involvement). The internationalization went through, a new ESSEC Asia-Pacific campus was established, which opened in 2015, an ESSEC Africa campus was opened in 2017, collaboration through a strategic alliance with CentraleSupélec and involvement of students to create their own courses and mentorship program, among other things. The school also launched its first MOOCs, inaugurated its startup incubator, ESSEC Ventures and established an experimental research laboratory, K-Lab.

== Grande école degrees ==

ESSEC Business School is a &quot;grande école&quot;, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and often connected to, the main framework of the French public university system. &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process, and a significant proportion of their graduates occupy the highest levels of French society. Similar to Ivy League schools in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, graduation from a grande école is considered the prerequisite credential for any top government, administrative and corporate position in France.

The degrees are accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France). Higher education business degrees in France are organized into three levels facilitating international mobility: the &quot;Licence&quot; / Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and the Master&#x27;s and Doctorat degrees. The Bachelors and the Masters are organized in semesters: 6 for the Bachelors and 4 for the Masters. Those levels of study include various &quot;parcours&quot; or paths based on UE (Unités d&#x27;enseignement or Modules), each worth a defined number of European credits (ECTS). A student accumulates those credits, which are generally transferable between paths. A bachelor&#x27;s is awarded once 180 ECTS have been obtained (bac + 3); a Masters is awarded once 120 additional credits have been obtained (bac +5). The highly coveted PGE (Grand Ecole Program) ends with the degree of Master&#x27;s in Management (MiM)

== Campuses ==

ESSEC has 4 campuses: Cergy, Singapore, La Défense and Rabat. An Africa-Indian Ocean campus project in Mauritius was announced in 2016 but was canceled in 2017.

===Cergy campus===
The main ESSEC campus is located in Cergy. Inaugurated in 1973, the site is located in the city and open to the public, mixing students and inhabitants in the area. 
In 2007, two new buildings were constructed: the Dome and the Galion, both significantly increased Cergy campus&#x27;s grounds. The Dome, which acts as a multipurpose room, can accommodate up to 2,700 people. It is used for business forums (Career Fairs), conferences, exam site, and cultural and social activities. The Galion is an administrative and educational building. It houses 54 offices and meeting rooms, 8 amphitheaters, and 12 classrooms as well as open work spaces.
At the end of 2018, the Campus 2020 project was announced, which intends to modernize the Cergy campus by 2023, for a total cost of 35 million euros (private and public funding). Among the main lines of this project are the construction of a sports center of nearly 2,000 m2, the redevelopment of the old gymnasium and the existing administrative building into spaces intended for research activities.

===La Defense campus===
ESSEC has had premises in the CNIT in La Défense since 1989, mainly used for continuing education and the MBA program.

===Singapore campus===
The ESSEC Asia-Pacific campus in Singapore was announced in October 2012, by Pierre Tapie shortly before his departure. The new campus was inaugurated in May 2015, by Jean-Michel Blanquer. ESSEC has been present in Asia since 1980 with a permanent office in Japan and Singapore since 2005 through the ESSEC Asian Centre located in the National Library Building. After considering Tokyo, Shanghai and Singapore, among others, the school finally chose Singapore latter in 2005, in particular for its position as a gateway to Asia.
Located in Nepal Hill, the campus spans five levels, 6,500 m2, can accommodate 1,500 students per year and cost 24 million euros, fully funded by ESSEC. It was designed by Singaporean architect, Dr. Liu Thai Ker (former architect planning Singapore).

===Rabat campus===
The creation of this campus was announced in November 2015, by Jean-Michel Blanquer and was inaugurated in April 2017. Morocco was chosen for the already effective presence of ESSEC&#x27;s partner CentraleSupélec, its proximity to France and the large number of Moroccan alumni.
Located 15 km from Rabat, the campus covers 6,000 m2 and has a capacity of 480 students. The campus is located right in the Casablanca - Rabat - Kenitra axis.
The campus was built specifically for ESSEC by the Addoha real estate group to which the school pays rent (proportional to the number of students hosted during the first three years, then €360,000 / year beyond), with the possibility of purchasing the premises after nine years.
At its first school year, the campus had seventy students, including eighteen Moroccans.

==Programs==

===ESSEC Global BBA===

The undergraduate program was initially created in 1975 by ESSEC Group to prepare students to meet the needs of French firms launching operations on the international market. It was formerly known as EPSCI, &quot;École des Practiciens du Commerce International&quot;, and is now referred to as &quot;ESSEC Global BBA&quot;.

The Global BBA lasts for four years and is designed for candidates graduated from high school (in France &quot;Baccalauréat&quot;).

At the end of the program, each student will have completed a minimum of 12 months of coursework abroad (each student will do two exchange programs abroad), a one-month humanitarian project and between 11 and 18 months of professional experience, which may also take place abroad.

=== Master in Management - &quot;Grande École&quot; program ===

ESSEC&#x27;s postgraduate programme is its Master in Management (also called &quot;&quot;Grande École&quot; program&quot;), designed for students with no professional experience (instead of managers with 3–5 years of experience like US MBA programs). It is the flagship program of the school.

The ESSEC MSc in management has been historically designed for candidates who have completed French preparatory classes after getting a high school diploma and passing a competitive entrance examination known as the &quot;concours&quot;, or have a university degree (Bachelor or Master). Applications are now open to non-French students: students with a university degree of three years or more received outside of France can also apply. Students from &quot;classe préparatoire&quot; will spend two to three years after Baccalauréat only to prepare for the national entrance examination of Grandes Ecoles which includes a written part (lasting three weeks) as well as an oral part (one to four days for each grande école). It is commonly considered the most prestigious path after High School in France (only 5% of a generation will be admitted to a &quot;prépa&quot;) with Law and Medicine, and consists of intensive courses in Mathematics, History and Geography, Economy, Literature, Philosophy, and two foreign languages. In 2015, among more than 20,000 students enrolled in classe préparatoire (business section), 5,614 applied to ESSEC concours (considered one of the most difficult), only 890 were invited to oral examination and 380 were eventually admitted. This means an acceptance rate of 6.77%. Going outside during lesson time is also forbidden on school grounds.

ESSEC offer an &quot;à la carte&quot; program – whether following courses at ESSEC or at a partner institution, going abroad or focusing on an associative project etc.

===Master in Finance===
The &quot;Master in Finance&quot; replaced the old Master &quot;Techniques Financières&quot; since 2016. The Master in Finance is recognized by the French Higher Education and Research Ministry as master&#x27;s degree.

There are three specialized tracks:

* Corporate Finance: M&amp;A, Private Equity, ECM, DCM, Equity Research, Leveraged and Project Finance;
* Financial Markets: Sales, Trading, Risk Management and Portfolio Management;
*FinTech &amp; Analytics: Quantitative Asset and Risk Management, Data-based Market Making and Trading and Quant Hedge Funds (with a solid Math/Physics degree).

The Master in Finance has a partnership with the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA).

===ESSEC M.S. Advanced Masters===
The Advanced master&#x27;s degrees are accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Ecoles&quot; in France. These programs are specialised to allow students finishing their studies or young professionals to complete their initial training (usually scientific or engineering) by acquiring complementary knowledge.

===ESSEC Global MBA===
The Global MBA at ESSEC Business School is a 12-month, full-time MBA program with an emphasis on emerging markets and experiential learning. It offers two Majors allowing students to specialise in the following areas: Luxury Brand Management, Strategy and Digital Leadership.

===PhD in Business Administration===
The PhD trains future professors, researchers and consultants. Before starting their dissertation work, students must follow a two-year program of courses and seminars that ends with preliminary examinations and a dissertation proposal. The curriculum starts with an intensive period of interdisciplinary training common to all students. This is followed by research training for the chosen field of specialization.

===ESSEC Executive Education===
More than 5,000 managers participate in ESSEC Exec Ed programs every year, primarily at La Défense campus, located in the heart of Paris&#x27; financial district and ESSEC&#x27;s Singapore campus.

===ESSEC &amp; Mannheim Executive MBA===
ESSEC and Mannheim Business School launched their joint Executive MBA Program in 2004. Building on the first established Executive MBAs in Europe by ESSEC since 1994, several modules are proposed in Mannheim, Paris, Singapore and various other locations worldwide in partner business schools.

== International partnerships ==

ESSEC has developed partnerships with universities all over the world for exchange and double degree programs, including UC Berkeley, University of Chicago, Dartmouth College, Brandeis University, Cornell University, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Seoul National University, Keio University, National University of Singapore, IIM Ahmedabad, IE Business School, University of Mannheim, King&#x27;s College London, Esic Business &amp; Marketing School, Fundação Getúlio Vargas&#x27; EAESP, among many others.

== ESSEC alumni ==
The association of graduates of the ESSEC or ESSEC Alumni group was founded in 1923, with the mission of connecting the 60,000+ graduates of ESSEC. It spans 75 countries and five continents and organizes more than a thousand events per year through its two hundred volunteers and employees. The network partners with 60 corporations, consists of 17 regional clubs and 73 chapters around the world. The association also publishes the alumni magazine, Reflets, five times a year.

<doc id="510008" wikidata="Q1351307" url="?curid=510008" title="John Comyn III of Badenoch">
<text>John Comyn III of Badenoch, nicknamed the Red ( 1274 – 10 February 1306), was a leading Scottish baron and magnate who played an important role in the First War of Scottish Independence. He served as Guardian of Scotland after the forced abdication of his uncle, King John Balliol (1292–1296), in 1296, and for a time commanded the defence of Scotland against English attacks. Comyn was stabbed to death by Robert the Bruce before the altar at the church of the Greyfriars at Dumfries.

His father, John Comyn II, known as the Black Comyn, had been one of the competitors for the Crown of Scotland, claiming his descent from King Donald III. His mother was Eleanor Balliol, sister of King John Balliol. He had, moreover, links with the royal house of England: in the early 1290s, he married Joan de Valence, cousin of King Edward I.

==Comyn family==

On the eve of the Wars of Independence, the Comyns were one of the dominant families of Scotland, with extensive landholdings in both the north and south of the country, and political influence and family connections with the crown. This Anglo-Norman family first made an appearance in Scotland during the reign of David I. In the thirteenth century they acquired the lordship of Badenoch, with extensive landholdings also in Lochaber, as well as the earldom of Buchan. On the death of Alexander III, John Comyn&#x27;s father was appointed to the panel of Guardians to await the arrival of the infant Margaret, Maid of Norway, granddaughter of Alexander III. Her death in 1290 immersed the nation in crisis, finally solved in 1292 when John Balliol emerged as king, with the support of his Comyn kinsmen, a solution that was never accepted by the other main claimant, Robert Bruce of Annandale, grandfather of the future king. The Comyns were supporters of King John as was William Wallace.

==Comyn at war==
With the outbreak of war between England and Scotland, Comyn, his father, and his cousin, John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, crossed the border and attacked Carlisle, defended for King Edward by Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, the father of the future king. The Wars of Scottish Independence thus began in a clash between the Bruces and Comyns. Having no siege equipment, the Comyns drew off and subsequently joined the main Scottish host at Haddington, which had been assembled to meet the advance of the English army along the east coast. On 27 April, the Scots were overwhelmed at the Battle of Dunbar, with John being among the many prisoners taken. While his father and cousin retreated north in the company of King John, he was sent south, to be imprisoned in the Tower of London.

John remained in prison for some months; but with the war in Scotland seemingly over he was finally released on condition that he take up service with Edward in Flanders, the main theatre of operations in his war against the French. While there he learned of the rising of William Wallace and Andrew Moray and their victory over the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. In March 1298, John was among Scots who deserted the English, finally ending up in Paris, where they appealed for aid to Philip IV of France. The only help they managed to get was a ship back to Scotland, arriving before the summer.

==Battle of Falkirk==
Earlier that year William Wallace emerged as Guardian after Moray died at Stirling or shortly after. The main task facing the Guardian was to gather a national army to meet an invasion by Edward, anxious to reverse the victory of Stirling Bridge. For cavalry, by far the weakest element of the Scottish host, Wallace depended on the Comyns and the other noble families. On 22 July Wallace&#x27;s army was destroyed at the Battle of Falkirk, the light horse being driven off at an early stage by the heavy English cavalry. 

It is possible that John Comyn was present at the battle, though the evidence is far from conclusive. The main Scottish sources, the chronicles of John Fordun and John Barbour, were composed decades after the event, long after the Comyns had been expelled from Scotland, and had a specific agenda, namely to magnify the later King, Robert the Bruce, and diminish John Comyn. According to Fordun, John and his kin hated Wallace and appeared on the battlefield only with premeditated treachery in mind – &quot;For, on account of the ill-will, begotten of the sprig of envy, which the Comyns had conceived towards the aforesaid William, they, with their accomplices, forsook the field, and escaped unhurt.&quot; This is set alongside a commendation of Robert the Bruce, who, in Fordun&#x27;s account, fought on the side of the English and &quot;was the means of bringing about the victory.&quot; This is contested as no Bruce appears on the Falkirk roll of nobles present in the English army, and ignoring Blind Harry&#x27;s 15th claim that Wallace burned Ayr Castle in 1297, two 19th-century antiquarians, Alexander Murison and George Chalmers, stated that Bruce did not participate in the battle and the following month decided to burn Ayr Castle to prevent it being garrisoned by the English. The contemporary English record of the &quot;Lanercost Chronicle&quot; simply blames the inadequacy of the Scottish cavalry in general. Soon after the defeat, John Comyn and Robert the Bruce were named as joint Guardians of the Realm in place of Wallace.

==Guardian of Scotland==
With no independent power base, Wallace, whose prestige had always been based on the success of his army, resigned or was removed as Guardian after Falkirk. In his place an unusual and difficult balancing act: John Comyn and Robert the Bruce, who had now joined the patriot party. The Scots were still fighting on behalf of the absent King John, so Bruce must have paid lip service to the cause, though his royal ambitions were openly known. The records give little or nothing in the way of insight into the feelings and motives of these men. At a meeting of a council of the magnates at Peebles in August 1299, an argument broke out relative to the property of Wallace, who was then in France. Comyn is said to have seized Bruce by the throat.

William Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews, was appointed as a third Guardian. Lamberton was a personal friend of both Wallace and Bruce. Bruce resigned before May 1300, when the restoration of King John was looking increasingly likely, leaving only Comyn and Lamberton. When parliament assembled at Rutherglen it elected Sir Ingram d&#x27;Umphraville to be one of the guardians of the realm in place of Bruce.

This was obviously an arrangement that suited Comyn, because Umphraville was a close political associate and a kinsman of King John. With the Guardianship taking Scotland one way Robert Bruce went the other, making his peace with Edward by February 1302 in a document in which he expressed the fear that &quot;the realm of Scotland might be removed from the hands of the king, which God forbid, and delivered to John Balliol, or to his son.&quot;

The new triumvirate lasted to May 1301, when John de Soules emerged as senior Guardian, seemingly appointed by Balliol himself pending his return. The following year, with Soules leaving for France on a diplomatic mission, Comyn (who may have resigned the guardianship during Soules&#x27;s tenure in 1301–2) became sole Guardian, occupying the position for the next two years. Comyn became Lord of Badenoch following his father&#x27;s death that same year.

==Defiance and surrender==
There was a certain inevitability to the Comyn domination of Scottish government in the years before 1304: they were the most powerful of the noble families, having more military resources and more control, particularly in the north, than any other family. English invasions in 1298, 1300, and 1301 had been confined to the south of the country, leaving the north as the chief recruiting ground, and supply base, of the Scottish army. The Guardian&#x27;s prestige increased still further when he and Sir Simon Fraser defeated an English reconnaissance force at the Battle of Roslin in February 1303.

Politically, however, the outlook was bleak. Philip of France entered into a final peace with Edward, from which Scotland was excluded. John Balliol, whose star had risen briefly above the horizon, now sank into the twilight of history. In a mood of desperation the Scottish diplomats in Paris, who included Comyn&#x27;s cousin Buchan, wrote words of encouragement; &quot;For God&#x27;s sake do not despair...it would gladden your hearts if you would know how much your honour has increased in every part of the world as a result of your recent battle with the English.&quot; However, for the first time since 1296 Edward was preparing an offensive that would take him deep into the north of Scotland. Unable to mount an effective resistance, and with his main base threatened with destruction, Comyn entered into peace negotiations, which concluded at Strathord near Perth on 9 February 1304.

Echoing the Treaty of Birgham, it was stipulated that laws, usages, and customs in place in the time of Alexander III should be retained. Comyn insisted that there should be no reprisals or disinheritance, which Edward accepted, with notable exceptions. Edward maintained his particular hatred for one former Guardian. Comyn was thus obliged to adhere to a condition in which he and other named individuals were to &quot;capture Sir William Wallace and hand him over to the king, who will watch to see how each of them conducts himself so that he can do most favour to whoever shall capture Wallace...&quot; There is no evidence to suggest Comyn made any effort to fulfil this condition.

==Death in Dumfries==

On 10 February 1306 Robert the Bruce participated in the killing of John Comyn before the high altar of the Greyfriars Church in Dumfries. Legend, possibly apocryphal, says Robert the Bruce called Comyn to a meeting. After Sir Richard Edgar encouraged Robert to slay the Red Comyn, Robert stabbed him and rushed out to tell Roger de Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick went in to finish the job uttering: &quot;You doubt! I mak siccar!&quot; (&quot;I make sure!&quot;) while Sir Robert Fleming decapitated Comyn, presenting the head to Robert, stating: &quot;Let the deed shaw&quot; (&quot;Let the deed show&quot;).

Apart from these bare facts, nothing certain can be gathered from contemporary accounts. While later Scottish sources all try to justify the crime by amplifying earlier accusations of malevolence and treachery against Comyn, the English sources portray Robert as a villain who lured Comyn inside a church – taken as a guarantee of safety – to commit a premeditated and sacrilegious murder before the Real Presence.

Some sources state that Bruce and Comyn had previously signed a pact, whereby one would take the crown in return for the lands of the other. As they stood before the high altar, Bruce accused Comyn of having betrayed by planning to hand him over to the English and struck Comyn with a dagger. It is unknown if this account is true.

Bruce&#x27;s companions struck him with their swords. Sir Robert Comyn, rushing to aid his nephew, was killed by a blow to the head by Bruce&#x27;s brother-in-law, Christopher Seton.

Thirteen days after the event, a garbled version of the facts reached the court of Edward I at Winchester, where the murder was reported as &quot;the work of some people who are doing their utmost to trouble the peace and quiet of the realm of Scotland.&quot; Once the picture became clear, Edward reacted in fury, authorising Aymer de Valence, Comyn&#x27;s brother-in-law, to take extraordinary action against Bruce and his adherents by granting no quarter to them. King Edward also emphasised his blood relationship with the Comyns by ordering his cousin, Joan, to send John&#x27;s young son and namesake to England, where he was placed in the care of Sir John Weston, guardian of the royal children. John IV Comyn grew to manhood in England, not returning to Scotland until 1314, when he was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn. The assassination of his father plunged Scotland into a brief but bloody civil war, largely concluded by 1308, but with political reverberations that were to last for decades.

<text>Vaala is a municipality in Finland. It is located in the North Ostrobothnia region. Established in 1954 (predecessor municipality &quot;Säräisniemi&quot;, established in 1867), the municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . Previously Vaala was part of the Kainuu region but was transferred to Northern Ostrobothnia on 1 January 2016.

Half of Oulujärvi, the fifth largest lake of Finland is located in Vaala.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

Vaala is also an old Finnish word, which means the phase in a river just before rapids.

== History ==
The original center of the area was Manamansalo, the largest island in the Oulujärvi with a village by the same name. Both it and Säräisniemi were first mentioned in 1555 when they were parts of the large Liminka parish. The parish of Oulujärvi, covering all of Kainuu with its center in Manamansalo, was separated from Liminka in 1559, but merged back into Liminka in the 1580s after Russians raided the island. In 1599, the area became a parish again, this time with its center in Paltaniemi, due to which the parish was now known as Paltamo.

Säräisniemi acquired its own church under Paltamo in 1779 and became a separate parish and municipality in 1864. Vuolijoki was separated from Säräisniemi as a parish in 1896 and as a municipality in 1915. Some parts of Kajaanin maalaiskunta were also used in the municipality&#x27;s formation. The village of Vaala was transferred from Utajärvi to Säräisniemi in 1954, becoming the new administrative center of the municipality. The municipality itself was also renamed Vaala in the process.

Vaala was transferred from Kainuu to North Ostrobothnia in 2016.

== Dialect ==

Vaala is located on the border between the Northern Ostrobothnian and Savonian (Kainuu) dialects.

<text>The public sphere () is an area in social life where individuals can come together to freely discuss and identify societal problems, and through that discussion influence political action. A &quot;Public&quot; is &quot;of or concerning the people as a whole.&quot; Such a discussion is called public debate and is defined as the expression of views on matters that are of concern to the public—often, but not always, with opposing or diverging views being expressed by participants in the discussion. Public debate takes place mostly through the mass media, but also at meetings or through social media, academic publications and government policy documents.

The term was originally coined by German philosopher Jürgen Habermas who defined the public sphere as &quot;made up of private people gathered together as a public and articulating the needs of society with the state&quot;. Communication scholar Gerard A. Hauser defines it as &quot;a discursive space in which individuals and groups associate to discuss matters of mutual interest and, where possible, to reach a common judgment about them&quot;. The public sphere can be seen as &quot;a theater in modern societies in which political participation is enacted through the medium of talk&quot; and &quot;a realm of social life in which public opinion can be formed&quot;.

==History==
Describing the emergence of the public sphere in the 18th century, Habermas noted that the public realm, or sphere, originally was &quot;coextensive with public authority&quot;, while &quot;the private sphere comprised civil society in the narrower sense, that is to say, the realm of commodity exchange and of social labor&quot;. Whereas the &quot;sphere of public authority&quot; dealt with the state, or realm of the police, and the ruling class, or the feudal authorities (church, princes and nobility) the &quot;authentic &#x27;public sphere, in a political sense, arose at that time from within the private realm, specifically, in connection with literary activities, the world of letters. This new public sphere spanned the public and the private realms, and &quot;through the vehicle of public opinion it put the state in touch with the needs of society&quot;. &quot;This area is conceptually distinct from the state: it [is] a site for the production and circulation of discourses that can in principle be critical of the state.&quot; The public sphere &quot;is also distinct from the official economy; it is not an arena of market relations but rather one of the discursive relations, a theater for debating and deliberating rather than for buying and selling&quot;. These distinctions between &quot;state apparatuses, economic markets, and democratic associations... are essential to democratic theory&quot;. The people themselves came to see the public sphere as a regulatory institution against the authority of the state. The study of the public sphere centers on the idea of participatory democracy, and how public opinion becomes political action. 

The ideology of the public sphere theory is that the government&#x27;s laws and policies should be steered by the public sphere and that the only legitimate governments are those that listen to the public sphere. &quot;Democratic governance rests on the capacity of and opportunity for citizens to engage in enlightened debate&quot;. Much of the debate over the public sphere involves what is the basic theoretical structure of the public sphere, how information is deliberated in the public sphere, and what influence the public sphere has over society.

==Definitions==

Jürgen Habermas claims &quot;We call events and occasions &#x27;public&#x27; when they are open to all, in contrast to closed or exclusive affairs&quot;.
This &#x27;public sphere&#x27; is a &quot;realm of our social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed. Access is guaranteed to all citizens&quot;.

This notion of the public becomes evident in terms such as public health, public education, public opinion or public ownership. They are opposed to the notions of private health, private education, private opinion, and private ownership. The notion of the public is intrinsically connected to the notion of the private.

Habermas stresses that the notion of the public is related to the notion of the common. For Hannah Arendt, the public sphere is therefore &quot;the common world&quot; that &quot;gathers us together and yet prevents our falling over each other&quot;.

Habermas defines the public sphere as a &quot;society engaged in critical public debate&quot;.

Conditions of the public sphere are according to Habermas:

* The formation of public opinion
* All citizens have access
* Conference in unrestricted fashion (based on the freedom of assembly, the freedom of association, the freedom to expression and publication of opinions) about matters of general interest, which implies freedom from economic and political control.
* Debate over the general rules governing relations.

==Jürgen Habermas: bourgeois public sphere==

Most contemporary conceptualizations of the public sphere are based on the ideas expressed in Jürgen Habermas&#x27; book &quot;The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere – An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society&quot;, which is a translation of his &quot;Habilitationsschrift,&quot; &quot;Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit:Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft&quot;. The German term &quot;Öffentlichkeit&quot; (public sphere) encompasses a variety of meanings and it implies a spatial concept, the social sites or arenas where meanings are articulated, distributed, and negotiated, as well as the collective body constituted by, and in this process, &quot;the public&quot;. The work is still considered the foundation of contemporary public sphere theories, and most theorists cite it when discussing their own theories.

Through this work, he gave a historical-sociological account of the creation, brief flourishing, and demise of a &quot;bourgeois&quot; public sphere based on rational-critical debate and discussion: Habermas stipulates that, due to specific historical circumstances, a new civic society emerged in the eighteenth century. Driven by a need for open commercial arenas where news and matters of common concern could be freely exchanged and discussed—accompanied by growing rates of literacy, accessibility to literature, and a new kind of critical journalism—a separate domain from ruling authorities started to evolve across Europe. &quot;In its clash with the arcane and bureaucratic practices of the absolutist state, the emergent bourgeoisie gradually replaced a public sphere in which the ruler&#x27;s power was merely represented before the people with a sphere in which state authority was publicly monitored through informed and critical discourse by the people&quot;.

In his historical analysis, Habermas points out three so-called &quot;&#x27;institutional criteria&quot; as preconditions for the emergence of the new public sphere. The discursive arenas, such as Britain&#x27;s coffee houses, France&#x27;s salons, and Germany&#x27;s &quot;Tischgesellschaften&quot; &quot;may have differed in the size and compositions of their publics, the style of their proceedings, the climate of their debates, and their topical orientations&quot;, but &quot;they all organized discussion among people that tended to be ongoing; hence they had a number of institutional criteria in common&quot;:

# Disregard of status: Preservation of &quot;a kind of social intercourse that, far from presupposing the equality of status, disregarded status altogether. ... Not that this idea of the public was actually realized in earnest in the coffee houses, salons, and the societies; but as an idea, it had become institutionalized and thereby stated as an objective claim. If not realized, it was at least consequential.&quot; (&quot;loc. cit.&quot;)
# Domain of common concern: &quot;... discussion within such a public presupposed the problematization of areas that until then had not been questioned. The domain of &#x27;common concern&#x27; which was the object of public critical attention remained a preserve in which church and state authorities had the monopoly of interpretation. ... The private people for whom the cultural product became available as a commodity profaned it inasmuch as they had to determine its meaning on their own (by way of rational communication with one another), verbalize it, and thus state explicitly what precisely in its implicitness for so long could assert its authority.&quot; (&quot;loc. cit.&quot;)
# Inclusivity: However exclusive the public might be in any given instance, it could never close itself off entirely and become consolidated as a clique; for it always understood and found itself immersed within a more inclusive public of all private people, persons who – insofar as they were propertied and educated – as readers, listeners, and spectators could avail themselves via the market of the objects that were subject to discussion. The issues discussed became &#x27;general&#x27; not merely in their significance, but also in their accessibility: everyone had to be able to participate. ... Wherever the public established itself institutionally as a stable group of discussants, it did not equate itself with the public but at most claimed to act as its mouthpiece, in its name, perhaps even as its educator – the new form of bourgeois representation&quot; (&quot;loc. cit.&quot;).

Habermas argued that the bourgeois society cultivated and upheld these criteria. The public sphere was well established in various locations including coffee shops and salons, areas of society where various people could gather and discuss matters that concerned them. The coffee houses in London society at this time became the centers of art and literary criticism, which gradually widened to include even the economic and the political disputes as matters of discussion. In French salons, as Habermas says, &quot;opinion became emancipated from the bonds of economic dependence&quot;. Any new work, or a book or a musical composition had to get its legitimacy in these places. It not only paved a forum for self-expression but in fact had become a platform for airing one&#x27;s opinions and agendas for public discussion.
The emergence of a bourgeois public sphere was particularly supported by the 18th-century liberal democracy making resources available to this new political class to establish a network of institutions like publishing enterprises, newspapers and discussion forums, and the democratic press was the main tool to execute this. The key feature of this public sphere was its separation from the power of both the church and the government due to its access to a variety of resources, both economic and social.

As Habermas argues, in due course, this sphere of rational and universalistic politics, free from both the economy and the State, was destroyed by the same forces that initially established it. This collapse was due to the consumeristic drive that infiltrated society, so citizens became more concerned about consumption than political actions. Furthermore, the growth of capitalistic economy led to an uneven distribution of wealth, thus widening economic polarity. Suddenly the media became a tool of political forces and a medium for advertising rather than the medium from which the public got their information on political matters. This resulted in limiting access to the public sphere and the political control of the public sphere was inevitable for the modern capitalistic forces to operate and thrive in the competitive economy.
==Counterpublics, feminist critiques and expansions==
Although &quot;Structural Transformation&quot; was (and is) one of the most influential works in contemporary German philosophy and political science, it took 27 years until an English version appeared on the market in 1989. Based on a conference on the occasion of the English translation, at which Habermas himself attended, Craig Calhoun (1992) edited &quot;Habermas and the Public Sphere&quot; – a thorough dissection of Habermas&#x27; bourgeois public sphere by scholars from various academic disciplines. The core criticism at the conference was directed towards the above stated &quot;institutional criteria&quot;:

# Hegemonic dominance and exclusion: In &quot;Rethinking the Public Sphere,&quot; Nancy Fraser offers a feminist revision of Habermas&#x27; historical description of the public sphere, and confronts it with &quot;recent revisionist historiography&quot;. She refers to other scholars, like Joan Landes, Mary P. Ryan and Geoff Eley, when she argues that the bourgeois public sphere was in fact constituted by a &quot;number of significant exclusions.&quot; In contrast to Habermas&#x27; assertions on disregard of status and inclusivity, Fraser claims that the bourgeois public sphere discriminated against women and other historically marginalized groups: &quot;... this network of clubs and associations – philanthropic, civic, professional, and cultural – was anything but accessible to everyone. On the contrary, it was the arena, the training ground and eventually the power base of a stratum of bourgeois men who were coming to see themselves as a &quot;universal class&quot; and preparing to assert their fitness to govern.&quot; Thus, she stipulates a hegemonic tendency of the male bourgeois public sphere, which dominated at the cost of alternative publics (for example by gender, social status, ethnicity and property ownership), thereby averting other groups from articulating their particular concerns.
# Bracketing of inequalities: Fraser makes us recall that &quot;the bourgeois conception of the public sphere requires bracketing inequalities of status&quot;. The &quot;public sphere was to be an arena in which interlocutors would set aside such characteristics as a difference in birth and fortune and speak to one another &quot;as if&quot; they were social and economic peers&quot;. Fraser refers to feminist research by Jane Mansbridge, which notes several relevant &quot;ways in which deliberation can serve as a mask for domination&quot;. Consequently, she argues that &quot;such bracketing usually works to the advantage of dominant groups in society and to the disadvantage of subordinates.&quot; Thus, she concludes: &quot;In most cases, it would be more appropriate to unbracket inequalities in the sense of explicitly thematizing them – a point that accords with the spirit of Habermas&#x27; later communicative ethics&quot;.
# The problematic definition of &quot;common concern&quot;: Nancy Fraser points out that &quot;there are no naturally given, a priori boundaries&quot; between matters that are generally conceived as private, and ones we typically label as public (i.e. of &quot;common concern&quot;). As an example, she refers to the historic shift in the general conception of domestic violence, from previously being a matter of primarily private concern, to now generally being accepted as a common one: &quot;Eventually, after sustained discursive contestation we succeeded in making it a common concern&quot;.

Nancy Fraser identified the fact that marginalized groups are excluded from a universal public sphere, and thus it was impossible to claim that one group would, in fact, be inclusive. However, she claimed that marginalized groups formed their own public spheres, and termed this concept a &quot;subaltern counter public&quot; or counter-public.

Fraser worked from Habermas&#x27; basic theory because she saw it to be &quot;an indispensable resource&quot; but questioned the actual structure and attempted to address her concerns. She made the observation that &quot;Habermas stops short of developing a new, post-bourgeois model of the public sphere&quot;. Fraser attempted to evaluate Habermas&#x27; bourgeois public sphere, discuss some assumptions within his model, and offer a modern conception of the public sphere.

In the historical reevaluation of the bourgeois public sphere, Fraser argues that rather than opening up the political realm to everyone, the bourgeois public sphere shifted political power from &quot;a repressive mode of domination to a hegemonic one&quot;. Rather than rule by power, there was now rule by the majority ideology. To deal with this hegemonic domination, Fraser argues that repressed groups form &quot;Subaltern counter-publics&quot; that are &quot;parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs&quot;.

Benhabib notes that in Habermas&#x27; idea of the public sphere, the distinction between public and private issues separates issues that normally affect women (issues of &quot;reproduction, nurture and care for the young, the sick, and the elderly&quot;) into the private realm and out of the discussion in the public sphere. She argues that if the public sphere is to be open to any discussion that affects the population, there cannot be distinctions between &quot;what is&quot; and &quot;what is not&quot; discussed. Benhabib argues for feminists to counter the popular public discourse in their own counter public.

The public sphere was long regarded as men&#x27;s domain whereas women were supposed to inhabit the private domestic sphere. A distinct ideology that prescribed separate spheres for women and men emerged during the Industrial Revolution.

The concept of heteronormativity is used to describe the way in which those who fall outside of the basic male/female dichotomy of gender or whose sexual orientations are other than heterosexual cannot meaningfully claim their identities, causing a disconnect between their public selves and their private selves. Michael Warner made the observation that the idea of an inclusive public sphere makes the assumption that we are all the same without judgments about our fellows. He argues that we must achieve some sort of disembodied state in order to participate in a universal public sphere without being judged. His observations point to a homosexual counter public, and offers the idea that homosexuals must otherwise remain &quot;closeted&quot; in order to participate in the larger public discourse.

==Rhetorical==
Gerard Hauser proposed a different direction for the public sphere than previous models. He foregrounds the rhetorical nature of public spheres, suggesting that public spheres form around &quot;the ongoing dialogue on public issues&quot; rather than the identity of the group engaged in the discourse.

Rather than arguing for an all-inclusive public sphere, or the analysis of tension between public spheres, he suggested that publics were formed by active members of society around issues. They are a group of interested individuals who engage in vernacular discourse about a specific issue. &quot;Publics may be repressed, distorted, or responsible, but any evaluation of their actual state requires that we inspect the rhetorical environment as well as the rhetorical act out of which they evolved, for these are the conditions that constitute their individual character&quot;. These people formed rhetorical public spheres that were based in discourse, not necessarily orderly discourse but any interactions whereby the interested public engages each other. This interaction can take the form of institutional actors as well as the basic &quot;street rhetoric&quot; that &quot;open[s] a dialogue between competing factions.&quot; The spheres themselves formed around the issues that were being deliberated. The discussion itself would reproduce itself across the spectrum of interested publics &quot;even though we lack personal acquaintance with all but a few of its participants and are seldom in contexts where we and they directly interact, we join these exchanges because they are discussing the same matters&quot;. In order to communicate within the public sphere, &quot;those who enter any given arena must share a reference world for their discourse to produce awareness for shared interests and public opinions about them&quot;. This world consists of common meanings and cultural norms from which interaction can take place.
The rhetorical public sphere has several primary features:
# it is discourse-based, rather than class-based.
# the critical norms are derived from actual discursive practices. Taking a universal reasonableness out of the picture, arguments are judged by how well they resonate with the population that is discussing the issue.
# intermediate bracketing of discursive exchanges. Rather than a conversation that goes on across a population as a whole, the public sphere is composed of many intermediate dialogs that merge later on in the discussion.

The rhetorical public sphere was characterized by five rhetorical norms from which it can be gauged and criticized. How well the public sphere adheres to these norms determine the effectiveness of the public sphere under the rhetorical model. Those norms are:

# &quot;permeable boundaries&quot;: Although a public sphere may have a specific membership as with any social movement or deliberative assembly, people outside the group can participate in the discussion.
# &quot;activity&quot;: Publics are active rather than passive. They do not just hear the issue and applaud, but rather they actively engage the issue and the publics surrounding the issue.
# &quot;contextualized language&quot;: They require that participants adhere to the rhetorical norm of contextualized language to render their respective experiences intelligible to one another.
# &quot;believable appearance&quot;: The public sphere must appear to be believable to each other and the outside public.
# &quot;tolerance&quot;: In order to maintain a vibrant discourse, others opinions need to be allowed to enter the arena.
In all this Hauser believes a public sphere is a &quot;discursive space in which strangers discuss issues they perceive to be of consequence for them and their group. Its rhetorical exchanges are the bases for shared awareness of common issues, shared interests, tendencies of extent and strength of difference and agreement, and self-constitution as a public whose opinions bear on the organization of society.&quot;

This concept that the public sphere acts as a medium in which public opinion is formed as analogous to a lava lamp. Just as the lamp&#x27;s structure changes, with its lava separating and forming new shapes, so does the public sphere&#x27;s creation of opportunities for discourse to address public opinion, thereby forming new discussions of rhetoric. The lava of the public which holds together the public arguments is the public conversation.

==Media==
Habermas argues that the public sphere requires &quot;specific means for transmitting information and influencing those who receive it&quot;.

Habermas&#x27; argument shows that the media are of particular importance for constituting and maintaining a public sphere. Discussions about the media have therefore been of particular importance in public sphere theory.

===As actors in the political public sphere===

According to Habermas, there are two types of actors without whom no political public sphere could be put to work: professionals in the media system and politicians.
For Habermas, there are five types of actors who make their appearance on the virtual stage of an established public sphere:

(a) Lobbyists who represent special interest groups;

(b) Advocates who either represent general interest groups or substitute for a lack of representation of marginalized groups that are unable to voice their interests effectively;

(c) Experts who are credited with professional or scientific knowledge in some specialized area and are invited to give advice;

(d) Moral entrepreneurs who generate public attention for supposedly neglected issues;

(e) Intellectuals who have gained, unlike advocates or moral entrepreneurs, a perceived personal reputation in some field (e.g., as writers or academics) and who engage, unlike experts and lobbyists, spontaneously in public discourse with the declared intention of promoting general interests.

Libraries have been inextricably tied to educational institutions in the modern era having developed within democratic societies. Libraries took on aspects of the public sphere (as did classrooms), even while public spheres transformed in the macro sense. These contextual conditions led to a fundamental conservative rethinking of civil society institutions like schools and libraries.

===YouTube===

Habermas argues that under certain conditions, the media act to facilitate discourse in a public sphere. The rise of the Internet has brought about a resurgence of scholars applying theories of the public sphere to Internet technologies.

For example, a study by S. Edgerly et al.
focused on the ability of YouTube to serve as an online public sphere. The researchers examined a large sample of video comments using the California Proposition 8 (2008) as an example. The authors argue that some scholars think the online public sphere is a space where a wide range of voices can be expressed due to the &quot;low barrier of entry&quot; and interactivity. However, they also point at a number of limitations. Edgerly et al. say that the affirmative discourse presupposes that YouTube can be an influential player in the political process and that it can serve as an influential force to politically mobilize young people. YouTube has allowed anyone and everyone to be able to get any political knowledge they wish. The authors mention critiques that say YouTube is built around the popularity of videos with sensationalist content. It has also allowed people to broadcast themselves for a large public sphere, where people can form their own opinions and discuss different things in the comments. The research by Edgerly, et al. found that the analyzed YouTube comments were diverse. They argue that this is a possible indicator that YouTube provides space for public discussion. They also found that YouTube videos&#x27; style influences the nature of the commentary. Finally, they concluded that the video&#x27;s ideological stances influenced the language of the comments. The findings of the work suggest that YouTube is a public sphere platform.

Additional work by S. Buckley reflected on the role that news content, specifically US cable news, contributed towards the formation of the public sphere. His research analysed a total of 1239 videos uploaded by five news organisations and investigated the link between content and user engagement. Through both content and sentiment analysis, it was suggested that the sentiment of the language used in the titles of the videos had an impact upon the public, with negatively sentimented titles generated more user engagement. Buckley suggested that due to the aspect of emotionality that is present in news content that due to the ongoing process of media hybridization, a new conceptual framework of the public sphere that acknowledges how both thoughtful discussions as well as ones which express feelings in an overt way needs to be developed.

===Limitations of media and the internet===

Some, like Colin Sparks, note that a new global public sphere ought to be created in the wake of increasing globalization and global institutions, which operate at the supranational level. However, the key questions for him were, whether any media exists in terms of size and access to fulfil this role. The traditional media, he notes, are close to the public sphere in this true sense. Nevertheless, limitations are imposed by the market and concentration of ownership. At present, the global media fail to constitute the basis of a public sphere for at least three reasons. Similarly, he notes that the internet, for all its potential, does not meet the criteria for a public sphere and that unless these are &quot;overcome, there will be no sign of a global public sphere&quot;.

German scholars Jürgen Gerhards and Mike S. Schäfer conducted a study in 2009 in order to establish whether the Internet offers a better and broader communication environment compared to quality newspapers. They analyzed how the issue of human genome research was portrayed between 1999 and 2001 in popular quality newspapers in both Germany and the United States in comparison to the way it appeared on search engines at the time of their research. Their intention was to analyze what actors and what sort of opinions the subject generated in both print and the Internet and verify whether the online space proved to be a more democratic public sphere, with a wider range of sources and views. Gerhards and Schäfer say they have found &quot;only minimal evidence to support the idea that the internet is a better communication space as compared to print media&quot;. &quot;In both media, communication is dominated by (bio- and natural) scientific actors; popular inclusion does not occur&quot;. The scholars argue that the search algorithms select the sources of information based on the popularity of their links. &quot;Their gatekeeping, in contrast to the old mass media, relies mainly on technical characteristics of websites&quot;. For Gerhards and Schäfer the Internet is not an alternative public sphere because less prominent voices end up being silenced by the search engines&#x27; algorithms. &quot;Search engines might actually silence societal debate by giving more space to established actors and institutions&quot;. Another tactic that supports this view is astroturfing. &quot;The Guardian&quot; columnist George Monbiot said that Astroturfing software, &quot;has the potential to destroy the internet as a forum for constructive debate. It jeopardizes the notion of online democracy&quot;.

===Virtual===
There has been an academic debate about how social media impacts the public sphere. The sociologists Brian Loader and Dan Mercea give an overview of this discussion. They argue that social media offers increasing opportunities for political communication and enable democratic capacities for political discussion within the virtual public sphere. The effect would be that citizens could challenge governments and corporations&#x27; political and economic power. Additionally, new forms of political participation and information sources for the users emerge with the Internet that can be used, for example, in online campaigns.
However, the two authors point out that social media&#x27;s dominant uses are entertainment, consumerism, and content sharing among friends. Loader and Mercea point out that &quot;individual preferences reveal an unequal spread of social ties with a few giant nodes such as Google, Yahoo, Facebook and YouTube attracting the majority of users&quot;. They also stress that some critics have voiced the concern that there is a lack of seriousness in political communication on social media platforms. Moreover, lines between professional media coverage and user-generated content would blur on social media.

The authors conclude that social media provides new opportunities for political participation; however, they warn users of the risks of accessing unreliable sources. The Internet impacts the virtual public sphere in many ways, but is not a free utopian platform as some observers argued at the beginning of its history.

===Mediated publicness===

John Thompson criticises the traditional idea of public sphere by Habermas, as it is centred mainly in face-to-face interactions. On the contrary, Thompson argues that modern society is characterized by a new form of &quot;mediated publicness&quot;, whose main characteristics are:

* Despatialized (there is a rupture of time/space. People can see more things, as they do not need to share the same physical location, but this extended vision always has an angle, which people do not have control over).
* Non dialogical (unidirectional. For example, presenters on TV are not able to adapt their discourse to the reactions of the audience, since they are visible to a wide audience but that audience is not directly visible to them. However, internet allows a bigger interactivity).
* Wider and more diverse audiences. (The same message can reach people with different education, different social class, different values and beliefs, and so on.)

This mediated publicness has altered the power relations in a way in which not only the many are visible to the few but the few can also now see the many:

 &quot;Whereas the Panopticon renders many people visible to a few and enables power to be exercised over the many by subjecting them to a state of permanent visibility, the development of communication media provides a means by which many people can gather information about a few and, at the same time, a few can appear before many; thanks to the media, it is primarily those who exercise power, rather than those over whom power is exercised, who are subjected to a certain kind of visibility&quot;. 

However, Thompson also acknowledges that &quot;media and visibility is a double-edged sword&quot; meaning that even though they can be used to show an improved image (by managing the visibility), individuals are not in full control of their self-presentation. Mistakes, gaffes or scandals are now recorded therefore they are harder to deny, as they can be replayed by the media.

===The public service model===

Examples of the public service model include BBC in Britain, and the ABC and SBS in Australia. The political function and effect of modes of public communication has traditionally continued with the dichotomy between Hegelian State and civil society. The dominant theory of this mode includes the liberal theory of the free press. However, the public service, state-regulated model, whether publicly or privately funded, has always been seen not as a positive good but as an unfortunate necessity imposed by the technical limitations of frequency scarcity.

According to Habermas&#x27;s concept of the public sphere, the strength of this concept is that it identifies and stresses the importance for democratic politics of a sphere distinct from the economy and the State. On the other hand, this concept challenges the liberal free press tradition form the grounds of its materiality, and it challenges the Marxist critique of that tradition from the grounds of the specificity of politics as well.

From Garnham&#x27;s critique, three great virtues of Habermas&#x27;s public sphere are mentioned. Firstly, it focuses on the indissoluble like between the institutions and practices of mass public communication and the institutions and practices of democratic politics. The second virtue of Habermas&#x27;s approach concentrate on the necessary material resource base for ant public. Its third virtue is to escape from the simple dichotomy of free market versus state control that dominates so much thinking about media policy.

==Non-liberal theories==

Oskar Negt &amp; Alexander Kluge took a non-liberal view of public spheres, and argued that Habermas&#x27; reflections on the bourgeois public sphere should be supplemented with reflections on the &quot;proletarian public spheres&quot; and the &quot;public spheres of production&quot;.

===Proletarian===

The distinction between bourgeois and proletarian public spheres is not mainly a distinction between classes. The proletarian public sphere is rather to be conceived of as the &quot;excluded&quot;, vague, unarticulated impulses of resistance or resentment. The proletarian public sphere carries the subjective feelings, the egocentric malaise with the common public narrative, interests that are not socially valorized
:&quot;As extraeconomic interests, they exist—precisely in the forbidden zones of fantasy beneath the surface of taboos—as stereotypes of a proletarian context of living that is organized in a merely rudimentary form.&quot;
The bourgeois and proletarian public spheres are mutually defining: The proletarian public sphere carries the &quot;left-overs&quot; from the bourgeois public sphere, while the bourgeois public is based upon the productive forces of the underlying resentment:
:&quot;In this respect, they &quot; [i.e. the proletarian public spheres] &quot; have two characteristics: in their defensive attitude toward society, their conservatism, and their subcultural character, they are once again mere objects; but they are, at the same time, the block of real life that goes against the valorization interest. As long as capital is dependent on living labor as a source of wealth, this element of the proletarian context of living cannot be extinguished through repression.&quot;

===Production===

Negt and Kluge furthermore point out the necessity of considering a third dimension of the public spheres: The public spheres of production. The public spheres of production collect the impulses of resentment and instrumentalizes them in the productive spheres. The public spheres of production are wholly instrumental and have no critical impulse (unlike the bourgeois and proletarian spheres). The interests that are incorporated in the public sphere of production are given capitalist shape, and questions of their legitimately are thus neutralized.

===Biopolitical public===

By the end of the 20th century, the discussions about public spheres got a new biopolitical twist. Traditionally the public spheres had been contemplated as to how free agents transgress the private spheres. Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have, drawing on the late Michel Foucault&#x27;s writings on biopolitics, suggested that we reconsider the very distinction between public and private spheres. They argue that the traditional distinction is founded on a certain (capitalist) account of property that presupposes clear-cut separations between interests. This account of property is (according to Hardt and Negri) based upon a scarcity economy. The scarcity economy is characterized by an impossibility of sharing the goods. If &quot;agent A&quot; eats the bread, &quot;agent B&quot; cannot have it. The interests of agents are thus, generally, clearly separated.

However, with the evolving shift in the economy towards an informational materiality, in which value is based upon the informational significance, or the narratives surrounding the products, the clear-cut subjective separation is no longer obvious. Hardt and Negri see the open source approaches as examples of new ways of co-operation that illustrate how economic value is not founded upon exclusive possession, but rather upon collective potentialities. Informational materiality is characterized by gaining value only through being shared. Hardt and Negri thus suggest that the commons become the focal point of analyses of public relations. The point being that with this shift it becomes possible to analyse how the very distinctions between the private and public are evolving.

<doc id="510018" wikidata="Q4930760" url="?curid=510018" title="Blunderbore">
<text>Blunderbore (also recorded as Blunderboar, Thunderbore, Blunderbus, or Blunderbuss) is a giant of Cornish and English folklore. A number of folk and fairy tales include a giant named Blunderbore, most notably &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;. The stories usually associate him with the area of Penwith.

Cornish folklore remembers Blunderbore as living in Ludgvan Lese (a manor in Ludgvan), where he terrorized travelers heading north to St Ives. In &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot; he is the second or third giant (along with his brother Rebecks) killed by the hero Jack. Under the influence of that story, the name &quot;Blunderbore&quot; is frequently appropriated by other legendary giants; the later fairy tale &quot;Tom the Tinkeard&quot;, a local Cornish variant of &quot;Tom Hickathrift&quot;, contains a similar account of the hero&#x27;s battle with a giant named Blunderbore. Likewise, it is usually given as the name of the ogre in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;.

==Appearances==
Blunderbore first appears in the fairy tale &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;. In the version recorded by Joseph Jacobs, Blunderbore lives in Penwith, where he kidnaps three lords and ladies, planning to eat the men and make the women his wives. When the women refuse to eat their husbands with the giant, he hangs them by their hair in his dungeon and leaves them to starve. Shortly, the hero Jack stops along the highway from Penwith to Wales to get a drink from a fountain and take a nap. Blunderbore discovers the sleeping Jack. Recognizing him by his labeled belt and having known of him killing Cormoran, carries him to his castle and locks him in a cell. While off inviting his friend Rebecks to come help him eat Jack, Jack creates nooses from some rope. When the giants arrive, he drops the nooses, slides down the rope, and slits their throats.

A giant named Blunderbore appears in the similar Cornish fairy tale &quot;Tom the Tinkeard&quot; (or &quot;Tom the Tinkard&quot;), a local variant of the more famous &quot;Tom Hickathrift&quot;. Here, Blunderbore has built a hedge over the King&#x27;s Highway between St Ives to Marazion, claiming the land as his own. The motif of the abduction of women appears in this version, as Blunderbore has kidnapped at least twenty women as his wives. The hero Tom awakes the giant from a nap while taking a wagon and oxen back from St Ives to Marazion. Blunderbore tears up an elm to swat Tom off his property, but Tom slides one of the axles from the wagon and uses it to fight and eventually fatally wound the giant. In his dying breaths, the giant confers all his wealth to Tom and requests a proper burial.

==In popular culture==
Blunderbore appears as a monster type in the computer game &quot;Diablo II&quot;.

<doc id="510019" wikidata="Q995161" url="?curid=510019" title="Bryant–Denny Stadium">
<text>Saban Field at Bryant–Denny Stadium is an outdoor stadium in the Southeastern United States, on the campus of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. It is the home field of the Alabama Crimson Tide football team of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). 

Opened 95 years ago in 1929, it was originally named Denny Stadium in honor of George H. Denny, the school&#x27;s president from 1912 to 1932. In 1975, the state legislature added longtime head coach and alumnus Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant to the stadium&#x27;s name. Bryant led the Tide for seven more seasons, through 1982, and is one of the few in Division I to have coached at a venue bearing his name. In 2024, Alabama announced that the playing field will be named after long-time head coach Nick Saban. Saban led the Crimson Tide to 6 national championships between 2007 and 2023. 

With a seating capacity of 100,077, it is the fourth-largest stadium in the Southeastern Conference, the eighth-largest stadium in the United States, and the tenth-largest stadium in the world.

== Construction history ==
The replacement for Denny Field, Denny Stadium opened in 1929, with 6,000 in attendance for a 55–0 victory over Mississippi College on September 28. It was officially dedicated the following week at homecoming ceremonies against Ole Miss, a 22–7 Crimson Tide victory. Originally, the stadium had a capacity of 12,000—the lower half of the current stadium&#x27;s east grandstand. However, President Denny initially envisioned a full bowl stadium capable of seating 66,000.

Before the 1937 season, permanent seats were built along the east sideline, increasing the capacity to 24,000.
Further expansions in 1946 (bleachers in both end zones), 1961 (new seats in west grandstand), and 1966 (both end zones fully enclosed, new seats in east grandstand) raised capacity to 31,000, 43,000, and 60,210, respectively. An upper deck was added to the west side in 1988 and raised the seating by nearly 10,000 to 70,123. During the construction, the Crimson Tide played its entire 1987 home schedule at Legion Field in Birmingham, northeast of Bryant–Denny.

===East upper deck (1998)===
In September 1995, the University of Alabama System Board of Trustees approved the construction of the east upper deck. Designed by the architectural firm of Heery-Chambless-Adams, the construction was financed by the university and $4.65 million from the city of Tuscaloosa, the city of Northport, and Tuscaloosa County. The localities contributed to construction costs in return for the university pledging to move all Crimson Tide home games to Bryant–Denny and not play any at Legion Field.

The new upper deck provided 10,000 additional bleacher seats and 81 skyboxes on two levels—63 16-seat and 18 24-seat capacity boxes. In 1999, four additional skyboxes were built to bring the total number of skyboxes to 85. A JumboTron scoreboard with video display capabilities was erected in the south end zone and was at the time the largest in collegiate sports. Additionally, a new east side entrance tower, a brick façade and reception areas for the Scholarship and A-Club level patrons was also added during the 1998 expansion.

The stadium&#x27;s eastern upper deck was opened in 1998 and raised its official seating capacity to 83,818 at a final cost of $35 million for the addition. The newly expanded venue debuted on September 5, and Alabama defeated BYU 38–31 as running back Shaun Alexander set a Tide single-game record with five touchdowns.

===North end zone expansion (2006)===

Following the 2004 season, the university spent approximately $47 million on an expansion to the north end zone, which was completed days before the 2006 opener against Hawaii. It added a new upper deck to the North end zone area, complete with three different levels of skyboxes, which collectively are known as &quot;The Zone&quot;, which brought the number of skyboxes in the stadium to 123. Two large display screens by Daktronics were placed in each corner of the north end zone, and LCD ribbon screens, tall by wide, were placed along the front edge of the east and west upper decks.
Massive changes were made to the grounds of the north side of the stadium with the addition of a Walk of Champions. Building the Walk of Champions required the demolition of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity house and the grading of the hill it sat upon. The Walk of Champions comprises a brick plaza leading from University Boulevard to the north end zone entrances. The plaza features 16 granite monuments set into the walkway commemorating the Crimson Tide&#x27;s SEC and national championship teams throughout the years. Along the west side of the plaza are five roughly , tall bronze statues, one for each Alabama football coach who has led the Crimson Tide to a national championship. Each statue has a semicircular wall behind it bearing the coach&#x27;s name and the year(s) that he led the team to a national championship. The first four statues, unveiled during the opening in 2006, included Wallace Wade, Frank Thomas, Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant, and Gene Stallings. The fifth statue, that of Nick Saban, was unveiled prior to the A-Day game on April 16, 2011. It commemorates Saban guiding Alabama to its 13th National Championship with a 37–21 win over the Texas Longhorns.

Finally, there is a bronze statuary group of two anonymous Alabama football players at the entrance to the north end zone, with the one on the left holding a large Alabama Crimson Tide flag upright on a flagpole. This player is wearing the number 18 and a helmet, with the player on the right wearing the number 92 and pointing into the distance. The jersey numbers represent 1892, the first season of Crimson Tide football.

The north end zone was opened for the 2006 season opener versus Hawaii, which set a new record attendance of 92,138. The Crimson Tide was victorious, 25–17.

===South end zone expansion (2010)===

The University of Alabama Board of Trustees approved a study for further expansion of Bryant–Denny on September 19, 2008. The Physical Properties Committee of the University of Alabama Board of Trustees heard a presentation from the UA athletic department on November 13, 2008 regarding the proposed $80.6 million expansion of the south end zone upper deck and suite level of Bryant–Denny Stadium. The proposed expansion would bring the stadium&#x27;s capacity to approximately 101,600, therefore making it the second largest stadium in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and the fifth largest stadium in college football. The committee unanimously approved the project to move into the third of four stages, the fourth being final approval to begin construction.

On February 6, 2009, the university&#x27;s board of trustees voted unanimously and without discussion to give the final approval for construction to commence on the south end zone expansion. With the approval of the board of trustees, construction began in the spring of 2009 and continued throughout the 2009 football season. The expansion was finished in time for the first game of the team&#x27;s 2010 season.

&quot;The Tuscaloosa News&quot; reported on April 17, 2009 that due to the economic climate and resultant lowered construction costs, the stadium expansion cost $15 million less than expected, coming in around $65.6 million.

The expanded south end zone now includes a two level South Zone club with a total of 1,700 seats and 36 skyboxes to bring the total number of skyboxes in Bryant–Denny Stadium to 159, as well as an 8,500 seat upper deck. The entire stadium&#x27;s audio/visual system was upgraded to include two new video boards in both corners of the south end zone.

Prior to the 2009 season, the large south scoreboard was disassembled to make way for the construction of the new stadium expansion. During this process, some welding equipment started a fire that burned the inside of the scoreboard. Also, during this time, four new play clocks and down/distance indicators were installed (one behind each corner of the end zones) and a new LED game clock was placed behind the south goalpost.

The expansion was completed in mid-summer 2010 and held an official capacity of 101,821 making it the fifth largest college football stadium in the country. The new seats were all sold out quickly for the entire 2010 football season. Subsequent expansions included stores and other extra amenities on the bottom of the end zone.

===Renovations (2019–2024)===
As part of a larger, 10-year $600 million plan to upgrade campus athletic facilities, the university is planning $92.5 million in upgrades to the stadium, including new social spaces, improved circulation, additional premium seating and upgraded spaces for athletes and recruits. The Walk of Champions will be extended into a new game day locker room via a new tunnel clad with video boards. The project will be funded with $48.4 million in bonds and $35 million from the Crimson Tide Foundation, the fundraising arm of UA athletics. Construction began shortly after the 2019 season.

New LED lights for the stadium were unveiled on the night of August 12, 2019, including a crimson-hued light display by the new installations.

In 2024 a new sign was added to the east and west upper deck that says Saban Field at Bryant–Denny Stadium, to honor legendary head coach Nick Saban who served as the head coach from 2007–2024.

===Expansion timeline===

==Football lore==

Since its opening in 1929 through 2023, the Crimson Tide owns a record at Bryant–Denny Stadium. Nick Saban is the leader in wins at the stadium, with an all-time record of since 2007, as 3 home game wins were vacated by the NCAA that year.

Despite its success at Bryant–Denny, most of Alabama&#x27;s &quot;home&quot; football history from the 1920s through the 1980s occurred at Birmingham&#x27;s Legion Field. Well into the 1980s, Legion Field seated almost 20,000 more people than Bryant-Denny. As such, until the late 1990s, Legion Field hosted most of Alabama&#x27;s important home games. The most notable of these games was the Iron Bowl with rival Auburn. Legion Field was considered a neutral site from 1948 through 1987. When the Iron Bowl became a home-and-home series in 1988, Alabama continued to host its home games in the series at Legion Field in even-numbered years through 1998. The Crimson Tide hosted Tennessee in odd-numbered years in Birmingham until 1999, and LSU in even-numbered years from 1964 through 1986, except for 1980. Usually, Bryant–Denny hosted three or four games per season, mostly non-conference games, although the Tide always played Mississippi State in Tuscaloosa, save for 1987, due to the close distance between Tuscaloosa and Starkville. However, in 1998, when Bryant–Denny was expanded to a capacity exceeding Legion Field, the more important home games started to move to Bryant–Denny, culminating with the move of the Tennessee series to Tuscaloosa in 1999 and the Iron Bowl a year later. From 1998 to 2003, Alabama continued to play two or three minor games in Birmingham. Finally, in 2003, Alabama played its final game at Legion Field against the South Florida Bulls, and now Bryant–Denny is the sole home of Alabama football.
However, despite the majority of past big games being played at Legion Field, Bryant–Denny Stadium has hosted many memorable games, such as the 1994 shootout between Alabama&#x27;s Jay Barker and Georgia&#x27;s Eric Zeier, Marvin Constant&#x27;s goal-line stop against LSU quarterback Josh Booty as time expired in 1999, Tyrone Prothro&#x27;s reception over the back of Southern Miss defensive back Jasper Faulk in 2005, a 31–3 victory over No. 5 Florida in 2005, the Roman Harper-forced fumble against Tennessee in 2005 that helped the Crimson Tide to victory, Alabama&#x27;s 36–0 shutout victory against Auburn in 2008 thus breaking the six-game losing streak and first ever Iron Bowl victory in Bryant–Denny Stadium, and Terrence Cody&#x27;s field goal block against Tennessee as time expired in 2009. In recent years, Bryant–Denny Stadium has become a feared place to play again. Also Bryant–Denny has been put on many lists ranking it one of the best places to watch football. NCAA Football 11 ranked Alabama&#x27;s Bryant–Denny as the fourth toughest place to play in the nation and third in the SEC behind Florida and LSU. &quot;Sporting News&quot; ranks it first while Bleacher Report has it ranked as the 5th toughest and the 2nd best stadium in the country.

==Field design==

Until the turn of the millennium, the field at Bryant–Denny Stadium had only the necessary markings required for play. As more and more stadiums began to add other designs to the field, such as logos, Alabama chose to remain traditional with the field design. In fact, even into the 2002 season, Bryant–Denny still had no logo at midfield and no logos at the 25-yard lines, which are now commonplace in many stadiums. The end zone design simply consisted of &quot;ALABAMA&quot; in a white, block-style font. During the 1992 season, however, a special logo was used at midfield to commemorate the centennial season of Alabama football.

During the 2002 season, however, a large white script “A” was added to midfield. The field design underwent full-scale changes beginning with the 2004 season. At midfield, the large white script “A” was replaced with the crimson script “A” logo, encircled by a crimson ring which has &quot;Alabama Crimson Tide&quot; written around it. In addition, the end zone designs were changed to a crimson block-style font outlined in white.

For the 2006 season, two identical logos commemorating the 175th anniversary of the university were also added to the field on the 25-yard lines. One was added on the south end of the stadium, on the west side of the playing field, while the other was on the north end of the stadium, on the east side of the playing field.
For the 2007 season, two identical logos commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) were added to home field of every SEC team. These were in the same places as the 175th logos were during the 2006 season.

For the 2008 season, two identical SEC logos were added to the home field of every SEC team. Alabama&#x27;s crimson was used as the primary color for the logos at Bryant–Denny. These logos were located in the same places as the previous logos and remain there today.

For the 2009 A-day game, the end zones were changed back to the original white block-style font that was used prior to the 2004 season, except that the background was shaded crimson. The north end zone displayed &quot;ALABAMA&quot;, while the south end zone displayed &quot;CRIMSON TIDE&quot;. This design layout has remained in use since the 2009 season.

For the 2011 season, two identical houndstooth awareness ribbons recognizing the ongoing relief efforts following the April 27, 2011 tornado were added to the field on the 25 yard lines.

==Locker rooms==
In 2008, the visitors&#x27; locker room was officially named &quot;The Fail Room&quot; after alumnus and donor James M. Fail. He commented, &quot;Earlier this year, when I saw the visitors&#x27; locker room as a potential naming right, I figured it was the most appropriate opportunity I would ever have to use my name.&quot;

==High school championships==
Beginning in 2009, Bryant–Denny Stadium and Auburn University&#x27;s Jordan–Hare Stadium became the homes of the Alabama High School Athletic Association state football championship games, known as the Super 7 (named for the number of AHSAA enrollment classes in football). The newly opened Protective Stadium in Birmingham was added to the Super 7 rotation in 2021. Under the current cycle, which ends in 2032, Birmingham hosts the event every third year from 2021 to 2030, with Bryant–Denny and Jordan–Hare alternating hosting duties in other years. Previously, the Super 6, reflecting the former AHSAA football classification structure, was held at Legion Field in Birmingham.

<doc id="510022" wikidata="Q1049276" url="?curid=510022" title="7 (Enrique Iglesias album)">
<text>7 is the third English studio album and seventh studio album overall (hence the title) released by Enrique Iglesias. The album was released on 25 November 2003. Coming off from the massive success of his 2001 release &quot;Escape&quot; that established him as one of the most important and biggest selling Latin figures of the music industry worldwide alongside Ricky Martin and Shakira. None of its singles cracked the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, though the second and last single &quot;Not in Love&quot; was a moderated hit in Europe. The album received mixed reviews, with critics comparing it negatively with his 2001 album saying it did not live up to the expectations that &quot;Escape&quot; had created. After this album, Enrique took a three-year break from music business.

==Background==
Enrique Iglesias wrote or co-wrote and co-produced every track on the album. Jimmy Iovine was the executive producer of the album alongside Iglesias. Iglesias told the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; that he took special care with the songwriting on the album. &quot;I concentrated a lot on the lyrical content of this album and just tried to be as honest as possible. I wanted to write songs that I won&#x27;t feel silly singing 10 years from now.&quot; &quot;7&quot; reached number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has sold 49,000 copies according to Nielsen Soundscan. While the first single &quot;Addicted&quot; reached number 38 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart, the Spanish version &quot;Adicto&quot; reached the Latin Top Ten. The second single &quot;Not in Love&quot; has reached the top of dance track charts in the US. The album made the UK and Australian top 100 albums in November 2003. &quot;Addicted&quot; made the top 40 charts in a number of countries including Germany, Australia, Portugal and Argentina.

==Singles==
&quot;Addicted&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on 14 October 2003. Iglesias claimed he wrote the song while on tour in East Germany, on a dismal day, when he was inspired by the gothic Architecture. It was a modest hit on the UK Singles Chart, where it charted within the top twenty, though it failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The Spanish version, titled &quot;Adicto&quot;, peaked inside the top ten on the Hot Latin Tracks Chart.

&quot;Not in Love&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second and last single on 7 February 2004. The song was written by Iglesias, Paul Barry, Mark Taylor and Fernando Garibay. The album version features Iglesias&#x27;s vocals only, however, the radio and single mix features an extra verse and chorus performed by Kelis. It peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart, however, again failed to make the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

<doc id="510026" wikidata="Q1425915" url="?curid=510026" title="Heptaméron">
<text>The Heptaméron is a collection of 72 short stories written in French by Marguerite de Navarre (1492–1549), published posthumously in 1558. It has the form of a frame narrative and was inspired by &quot;The Decameron&quot; of Giovanni Boccaccio. It was originally intended to contain one hundred stories covering ten days like &quot;The Decameron&quot;, but at Marguerite’s death it was completed only as far as the second story of the eighth day.

Many of the stories deal with love, lust, infidelity, and other romantic and sexual matters. One was based on the life of Marguerite de La Rocque, a French noblewoman who was punished by being abandoned with her lover on an island off Quebec. In 1973, the French director Claude Pierson (1930-1997) made an adaptation of this work, entitled &quot;:fr:Ah! Si mon moine voulait…&quot;, with Alice Arno in the cast.

==History of the text==

The collection first appeared in print in 1558 under the title &quot;Histoires des amans fortunez&quot; edited by Pierre Boaistuau, who took considerable liberties with the original version; he used only 67 of the stories, many in abbreviated form, and omitted much of the significant material between the stories. He also transposed stories and ignored their grouping into days as envisaged by the author. A second edition by Claude Gruget appeared only a year later in which the editor claimed to have &quot;restored the order previously confused in the first impression&quot;. Also the prologues and epilogues to each short story left out by Boaistuau were put back and the work was given, for the first time, the title &quot;Heptaméron&quot; (from the Greek ἑπτά – &quot;seven&quot; and ἡμέρα – &quot;day&quot;) due to the seven-day time frame into which the first 70 short stories are grouped.

The first complete English translation, by Arthur Machen, appeared in 1886. The most recent translation is by Paul Chilton in 1984 for Penguin Books.

==Summary of the &quot;Prologue&quot;==

In the &quot;Prologue&quot; to &quot;The Heptameron&quot;, Parlamente, having obtained her husband Hircan&#x27;s permission to do so, makes bold to ask Lady Oisille to devise an appropriate means by which the company of stranded guests, who are waiting for the building of a bridge to be completed and are beset by a series of natural calamities and criminal actions which keep them virtual prisoners in an abbey, may amuse themselves. A devout Christian, the lady suggests that they read the Bible. However, Hircan says that they are young enough to need other diversions as well. Parlamente suggests that those who want to write stories after the manner of Boccaccio, do so, sharing them with the others in the afternoon, after Scriptures are read in the morning. (Marguerite herself was a protector of François Rabelais, who dedicated the third volume of his book, &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;, to her.) It will take 10 days to complete the bridge, and, each day, in a shady grove in a meadow, the writers will share 10 tales, telling a total of 100 stories. The stories will be published, if the audience likes them, and be presented to the listeners as presents.

Lady Oisille agrees to Parlamente&#x27;s recommendation, provided that the stories are true.

==Sample story summarized==
Saffrendent tells the third story, which is set in Naples, Italy, during the reign of King Alfonso.

During a carnival, the king visits his subjects’ homes as they vie to provide him the best hospitality. As he visits a happily married young couple, he is smitten by the wife’s beauty, and he sends her husband to Rome for a couple weeks on trumped-up business. While the husband is away, the king succeeds in seducing the wife. After a while, the husband becomes suspicious of his wife’s fidelity. He bides his time in silence, hoping for the opportunity to avenge himself.

He convinces the queen that he loves her and that she deserves to be treated better by her husband, who dishonors her in cuckolding him. They agree to an adulterous affair between themselves, so that the nobleman cuckolds the king who has cuckolded him. Whenever the nobleman visits his country estates, the king visits his wife. Instead of going to his estates, the nobleman now goes to the castle to dally with the queen, while the king commits adultery with his wife. The affairs continue for years, well into the couples’ old age.

Like many stories of this sort, Saffredent’s tale deals with the theme of cuckoldry and depends on both dramatic and situational irony for its plot and effects.

<text>Pierre François André Méchain (; 16 August 1744 – 20 September 1804) was a French astronomer and surveyor who, with Charles Messier, was a major contributor to the early study of deep-sky objects and comets.

==Life==
Pierre Méchain was born in Laon in northern France, the son of the ceiling designer and plasterer Pierre François Méchain and Marie–Marguerite Roze. He displayed mental gifts in mathematics and physics but had to give up his studies for lack of money. However, his talents in astronomy were noticed by Jérôme Lalande, for whom he became a friend and proof-reader of the second edition of his book &quot;L&#x27;Astronomie&quot;. Lalande then secured a position for him as assistant hydrographer with the Naval Depot of Maps and Charts at Versailles, where he worked through the 1770s engaged in hydrographic work and coastline surveying. It was during this time—approximately 1774—that he met Charles Messier, and apparently, they became friends. In the same year, he also produced his first astronomical work, a paper on an occultation of Aldebaran by the Moon, and presented it as a memoir to the Academy of Sciences.

In 1777, Méchain married Barbe-Thérèse Marjou whom he knew from his work in Versailles. They had two sons: Jérôme, born 1780, and Augustin, born 1784, and one daughter. He was admitted to the French Académie des sciences in 1782, and was the editor of &quot;Connaissance des Temps&quot; from 1785 to 1792; this was the journal which, among other things, first published the list of Messier objects. In 1789 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Méchain participated in the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) to measure by trigonometry the precise distance between the Paris Observatory and the Royal Greenwich Observatory. This project had been initiated by César-François Cassini de Thury, who died in 1784, and in 1787 Méchain visited Dover and London with Cassini de Thury’s son Dominique, comte de Cassini and Adrien-Marie Legendre to facilitate its progress. The three men also visited the astronomer William Herschel at Slough, who had discovered Uranus in 1781.

With his surveying skills, Méchain worked on maps of Northern Italy and Germany after this, but his most important mapping work was geodetic: the determination of the southern part of the meridian arc of the Earth&#x27;s surface between Dunkirk and Barcelona beginning in 1791. This measurement would become the basis of the metric system&#x27;s unit of length, the meter. He encountered numerous difficulties on this project, largely stemming from the effects of the French Revolution. He was arrested after it was suspected his instruments were weapons, he was interned in Barcelona after war broke out between France and Spain, and his property in Paris was confiscated during The Terror. He was released from Spain to live in Italy, then returned home in 1795.

A particularly intriguing fact about this project was that Méchain was uncertain of the precision of his measurements owing to anomalous results in verifying his latitude by astronomical observation. Ultimately, the distance from the pole to the equator, which Méchain and his associate Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre had intended to be exactly ten million meters (or ten thousand kilometres), was determined in the late 20th century by space satellites to be 10,002,290 meters. This small error of 2,290 meters equals 1.423 statute miles; the error in such a large measurement amounts to 14½ inches per statute mile. It represents in each meter an error of approximately 0.23 millimetres – slightly more than the width of a single strand of human hair. This discrepancy is sometimes mentioned as &quot;Méchain&#x27;s error&quot;, with the suggestion that the tiny variation in the length of the meridian (not detected for nearly two hundred years) can be attributed to Méchain&#x27;s calculations. But analysis of Méchain&#x27;s figures reveals that Méchain consistently kept the discrepancy very tiny, essentially forcing his individual reported measurements to appear more precise and consistent than would be reasonably expected of a survey involving more than a hundred measurements of mostly rough country using 18th-century equipment; Méchain&#x27;s putative error did not affect the final value of the length of the meter nor the measurement of the meridian.

From 1799, he was the director of the Paris Observatory.

Continuing doubts about his measurements of the Dunkirk-Barcelona arc led him to return to that work. This took him back to Spain in 1804, where he caught yellow fever and died in Castellón de la Plana.

==Discoveries==

Méchain discovered either 25 or 26 deep-sky objects, depending on how one counts M102. Méchain disavowed the M102 observation in 1783, claiming it was a mistaken re-observation of M101. Since that time, others have proposed that he did in fact observe another object, and suggested what they might be. 



He independently discovered four others, originally discovered by someone else but unknown to him at the time and included in the Messier catalogue: M71, discovered by Jean-Philippe de Chéseaux in the 1740s; M80, discovered by Messier about two weeks earlier than Méchain&#x27;s observation; and M81 and M82, discovered originally by Johann Bode.

Six other discoveries are &quot;honorary Messier objects&quot; added to the list in the 20th century:

He also discovered NGC 5195, the companion galaxy that makes M51 (the Whirlpool Galaxy) so distinctive.

Méchain never set out to observe deep-sky objects. Like Messier, he was solely interested in cataloguing objects that might be mistaken for comets; having done so, he was the second-most successful discoverer of comets of his time, after Messier himself.

All together, he originally discovered eight comets, and co-discovered three.

His sole discoveries are:

* C/1781 M1 (Méchain), &quot;1781 I&quot;
* C/1781 T1 (Méchain), &quot;1781 II&quot;
* C/1785 E1 (Méchain), &quot;1785 II&quot;
* 2P/Encke, discovered in 1786
* C/1787 G1 (Méchain), &quot;1787 I&quot;
* 8P/Tuttle, discovered in 1790
* C/1799 P1 (Méchain), &quot;1799 II&quot;
* C/1799 Y1 (Méchain), &quot;1799 III&quot;

Méchain&#x27;s co-discoveries are:

* C/1785 A1 (Messier-Méchain), &quot;1785 I&quot;
* C/1792 II Gregory-Méchain, &quot;1792 II&quot;
* C/1801 Pons (Pons-Messier-Méchain-Bouvard), &quot;1801 I&quot;

Note that only the two named comets have been connected to periodic comets that have computed orbits and in neither case was he an observer when they were computed, so by that technical definition (commonly used for comets since the 19th century) Méchain did not discover any of these nine.

==Legacy==
On 24 June 2002, Asteroid 21785 Méchain was named in his honour, discovered by Miloš Tichý at Kleť Observatory on 21 September 1999, and provisionally designated 1999 SS2.

<text>Region Skåne is the regional council of Skåne County in Scania, Sweden. Region Skåne was formed on 1 January 1999 by the amalgamation of the county councils of Malmöhus County and Kristianstad County and some of the tasks handled by Malmö Municipality.

The regional assembly is the highest political body in the region and its members are elected by the population of Skåne Country, as opposed to the County Administrative Board (&quot;länsstyrelsen&quot;) which represents the interests of the state within the county, under the chairmanship of the county governor.

The region&#x27;s main responsibility is for the public healthcare system, public transport and development within the region, which includes co-ordination of development of commerce, communication, culture and collaboration with other regions both in and outside of Sweden.

By devolution the newly formed region assumed some powers from the Skåne County Administrative Board, the state authority in Skåne County.

Before Region Skåne was formed in 1999 on a trial basis, the regional development was the responsibility of a Regional Association, comprising the 33 municipalities together with the then current health services principals, namely the Kristianstad and Malmöhus county councils and the Health Services authority in the City of Malmö.

Similar provisions had also been extended to the Region Västra Götaland and the Region Gotland during a trial period.

==Regional assembly==
The regional assembly (, formerly &quot;landstingsfullmäktige&quot;) meets at Skåne Town Hall in Kristianstad. Elections are held every fourth year in conjunction with the national and municipal elections, on the third Sunday of September.

The executive body of the Region Skåne is the Regional Executive Committee (&quot;regionstyrelsen&quot;). The current chair of the executive committee is Carl Johan Sonesson of the Moderate Party, who succeeded Henrik Fritzon of the Social Democratic Party following the 2018 elections.

<text>The national flag of Somalia was adopted on October 12, 1954, and was designed by Mohammed Awale Liban. The flag was initially used within the Trust Territory of Somaliland before being adopted by the short-lived State of Somaliland and the Somali Republic. It is an ethnic flag for the Somali people; the flag&#x27;s five-pointed star represents the five regions in which Somalis reside.

==History==

Beginning in the mid-19th century, areas in the Horn of Africa populated by Somalis were divided among Ethiopia, France, Britain, and Italy. Soon after the creation of the UN Trust Territory of Somaliland during 1950, the Somali Youth League persistently advocated for the creation of a national flag. This was rejected by Italian administrators of the Trusteeship until 1954, when a debate was opened in the territorial council. The SYL, being the most popular political organization in the country initially sought to use the Leagues flag but was rejected outright by rival parties. A deadlock ensued until it was broken by the Somali scholar Mohammed Awale Liban who suggested a different symbol from the ones proposed. Liban personally conceived of and designed the flag, and was also used in the short-lived independent State of Somaliland between 26 June 1960 and 1 July 1960.

=== In Somaliland ===
Public display of the Somali flag is strictly prohibited in Somaliland.

==Characteristics==
As an ethnic flag, the five-pointed white &quot;Star of Unity&quot; in its center represents the areas where the Somali ethnic group form the majority: Djibouti, Somaliland (former British protectorate), the Somali region in Ethiopia, the North Eastern Province in Kenya, and Somalia (Italian Somaliland). However, the flag does not represent all the Somali regions anymore, going from an ethnic flag to the national flag of Somalia only. It now officially denotes the sky as well as the Gulf of Aden, Guardafui Channel and the Somali Sea, which flank the country. The blue color of the flag was selected in tribute to the United Nations who helped to form the country of Somalia during its status as a trust territory from 1950–1960.

<doc id="510040" wikidata="Q611939" url="?curid=510040" title="Douglas TBD Devastator">
<text>The Douglas TBD Devastator was an American torpedo bomber of the United States Navy. Ordered in 1934, it first flew in 1935 and entered service in 1937. At that point, it was the most advanced aircraft flying for the Navy, being the first metal monoplane in the United States Navy; however, by the time of the US entry into World War 2, the TBD was already outdated.

The Devastator performed well early in the war, most notably in the Battle of the Coral Sea, but earned infamy for a catastrophic performance during the Battle of Midway in which 41 Devastators recorded zero torpedo hits with only six surviving to return to their carriers. Although much of the Devastator&#x27;s dismal performance was later attributed to the many well-documented defects in the US Mark 13 torpedo, the aircraft was withdrawn from frontline service after Midway, being replaced by the Grumman TBF Avenger.

==Design and development==


The Douglas XTBD-1 was ordered on 30 June 1934 after being one of the winners of a US Navy competition for new bombers to operate from its aircraft carriers. Other aircraft also ordered for production as a result of the competition included the Brewster SBA, the Vought SB2U Vindicator, and the Northrop BT-1, the last of which would evolve into the Douglas SBD Dauntless. The Great Lakes XB2G, Great Lakes XTBG, Grumman XSBF, Hall XPTBH and Vought XSB3U were also tendered to the specification but were not developed beyond prototype status.

The XTBD Devastator flew for the first time on 15 April 1935 while marking a number of &quot;firsts&quot; for the US Navy. It was the first American carrier-based monoplane to be widely used, the first all-metal naval aircraft, the first with a completely enclosed cockpit, the first with power-actuated (hydraulically) folding wings. A semi-retractable landing gear was fitted, with the wheels protruding below the wings to potentially limit damage to the aircraft in a &quot;wheels-up&quot; landing. A crew of three was normally carried beneath a large &quot;greenhouse&quot; canopy almost half the length of the aircraft. The pilot sat in front; a rear gunner/radio operator took the rearmost position, while the bombardier occupied the middle seat. During a bombing run, the bombardier lay prone, sliding into position under the pilot to sight through a window in the bottom of the fuselage, using the Norden bombsight.

The normal TBD offensive armament consisted of either a Bliss-Leavitt Mark 13 aerial torpedo or a bomb carried semi-recessed in the fuselage. Alternatively, three general-purpose bombs (one under each wing root and one inside the fuselage), or twelve fragmentation bombs (six under each wing root), could be carried. This weapons load would often be used when attacking Japanese targets on the Gilbert and Marshall Islands in 1942. Defensive armament consisted of a Browning machine gun for the rear gunner. Fitted in the starboard side of the cowling was either a or M2 Browning machine gun.

The powerplant was a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830-64 Twin Wasp radial engine, a development of the prototype&#x27;s Pratt &amp; Whitney XR-1830-60/R-1830-1. Other changes from the 1935 prototype included a revised engine cowling and a raised cockpit canopy to improve visibility.

The XTBD had a flat canopy that was replaced on production models by a higher, domed canopy with a rollover bar. Other than requests by test pilots to improve pilot visibility, the prototype easily passed its acceptance trials that ran from 24 April to 24 November 1935 at NAS (Naval Air Station) Anacostia and Norfolk bases. After successfully completing torpedo drop tests, the prototype was transferred to the for carrier certification. The extended service trials continued until 1937 with the first two production aircraft retained by the company exclusively for testing.

The US Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) purchased 129 examples, and began to equip the carriers , , , , , and starting in 1937. Even prewar, TBD units were being shifted to training duties with at least one aircraft being converted to target tug duty. By 1940, the US Navy was aware that the TBD had become outclassed and a replacement, the Grumman TBF Avenger, was in the works, but it was not yet operational when the US entered World War II. Attrition had by then reduced their numbers to just over 100 aircraft. When the US Navy assigned popular names to its aircraft in late 1941, the TBD became the Devastator, although its nickname &quot;torpecker&quot; was still commonly used.

==Operational history==

In the early days of the Pacific war, the TBD acquitted itself well during February and March 1942, with TBDs from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; attacking targets in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, Wake and Marcus Islands, while TBDs from &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; struck Japanese shipping off New Guinea on 10 March. In the Battle of the Coral Sea Devastators helped sink the Japanese aircraft carrier on 7 May, but failed to hit another carrier, the , the next day.

Many faults were discovered with the Mark 13 torpedo at this point. Many were seen to hit the target yet failed to explode; there was also a tendency to run deeper than the set depth. It took over a year for the defects to be corrected. These problems were not fixed by the time of the Battle of Midway on 4 June 1942.

At Midway, a total of 41 Devastators, the majority of the type still operational, were launched from &quot;Hornet&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; to attack the Japanese fleet. The sorties were not well coordinated, in part because Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance ordered a strike on the enemy carriers immediately after they were discovered, rather than spending time assembling a well-coordinated attack involving the different types of aircraft – fighters, bombers, torpedo planes – reasoning that attacking the Japanese would prevent a counterstrike against the US carriers. The TBDs from &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; lost contact with their escort and started their attacks without fighter protection.

The Devastator proved to be a death trap for its crews: slow and hardly maneuverable, with poor armor for the era; its speed on a glide-bombing approach was a mere , making it easy prey for fighters and defensive guns alike. The aerial torpedo could not even be released at speeds above . Torpedo delivery requires a long, straight-line attack run, making the aircraft vulnerable, and the slow speed of the aircraft made them easy targets for the Mitsubishi A6M Zeros. Only four TBDs made it back to &quot;Enterprise&quot;, none to &quot;Hornet&quot; and two to &quot;Yorktown&quot;, without scoring a torpedo hit.

Nonetheless, their sacrifice was not completely in vain, as several TBDs managed to get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before dropping their torpedoes, being close enough to be able to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to take sharp evasive maneuvers. By obliging the Japanese to keep their flight decks clear and to continually cycle and reinforce their combat air patrols, they prevented any Japanese counter-attacks against the American carriers, just as Spruance had anticipated. These windows of opportunity were exploited by the late-arriving Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers led by Lieutenant Commanders C. Wade McClusky and Max Leslie, which dive-bombed and fatally damaged three of the four Japanese carriers about one hour after the first TBD torpedo attacks had developed. While the Devastators faced the stiff defenses of the carriers and their fighters, their attacks served to distract the Japanese attention from the Dauntless dive bombers&#x27; strikes, resulting in relatively lighter resistance from the IJN carriers&#x27; defensive fighter patrols, and more effective American attacks that crippled the IJN carrier forces.

===Obsolescence===
The Navy immediately withdrew the 39 remaining TBDs from frontline units after the failure at Midway. The surviving Devastators in VT-4 and VT-7 remained in service briefly in the Atlantic and in training squadrons until 1944. Many were relegated to training duties for pilots and mechanics or were destroyed following use as instructional airframes for firefighting training. By late 1944, no TBD Devastators were left in the US Navy inventory. The original prototype finished its career at NAS Norman, Oklahoma; the last TBD in the US Navy was used by the Commander of Fleet Air Activities-West Coast. When his TBD was scrapped in November 1944, there were no more. None survived the war and there are none known to exist on dry land today.

In fairness to the Devastator, the newer TBF Avengers were similarly ineffective in 1942, losing five out of six aircraft without scoring a hit during the Battle of Midway. The Avengers&#x27; only successes in 1942 would be against the light carrier and the battleship . In the initial part of the Pacific War, the poor performance of US torpedo bombers was due to the vulnerability of that type in general against fire from anti-aircraft artillery and defending fighters, plus the inexperience of American pilots and lack of coordinated fighter cover, as well as serious defects in US torpedoes which were not discovered and corrected until the fall of 1943. It took growing American air superiority, improved attack coordination, and more experienced pilots, before the Avengers were able to successfully accomplish their roles in subsequent battles against Japanese surface forces.

==Surviving aircraft==
No TBD’s survive in museums or private collections, nor are there any currently under restoration. However, below are eleven underwater aircraft that are known to exist and are the closest to a complete airframe. An expedition has been proposed to recover several TBDs from the wreck of the USS &quot;Lexington&quot;. Note that these aircraft exist in varying degrees of intactness due to circumstances of their loss and subsequent saltwater corrosion. For example, the pair at Jaluit, a shallow warm-water atoll, have reef creatures growing on their exteriors; several of those lost at Coral Sea have broken wings and fuselages due to avgas explosions and their free-fall to the deep sea floor.

On 4 March 2018, Paul G. Allen&#x27;s R/V Petrel team discovered the wreck of the USS &quot;Lexington&quot; at 3,000 meters (about two miles) below the surface, resting on the floor of the Coral Sea more than 500 miles off the eastern coast of Australia. Near the wreck were the remains of seven Devastators, as well as an F4F-3 Wildcat. An attempt by A and T Recovery to recover at least four of the wrecks, including the Devastator, is currently underway as of January 2023.

==Replica==

On 19 September 2019, the USS Midway Museum acquired a 1:1 scale replica used in the World War II movie, &quot;Midway&quot;. The plane was donated from Lionsgate following the conclusion of filming and will become an exhibit on &#x27;s hangar.

==Specifications (TBD-1)==

==Notable appearance in media==
&quot;Dive Bomber&quot; (1941) was an American film directed by Michael Curtiz. It is notable for both its Technicolor photography of pre-World War II United States Navy aircraft featuring the TBD Devastator, and scenes on the aircraft carrier as well as the NAS North Island in San Diego.

The 2014 film &quot;Against the Sun&quot; depicts a real-life story of the survival of a Devastator&#x27;s crew after it had to ditch due to running out of fuel. The crew survived 34 days adrift.

The 2019 film &quot;Midway&quot; featured the Devastator, most notably the disastrous attack by VT-8, including its only survivor, Ensign George Gay, using his plane&#x27;s seat cushion to conceal himself from the Japanese as he watched the SBDs bomb the IJN Carrier force.

<doc id="510046" wikidata="Q607241" url="?curid=510046" title="Clergy house">
<text>A clergy house is the residence, or former residence, of one or more priests or ministers of a given religion, serving as both a home and a base for the occupant&#x27;s ministry. Residences of this type can have a variety of names, such as manse, parsonage, rectory, or vicarage.

==Function==
A clergy house is typically owned and maintained by a church, as a benefit to its clergy. This practice exists in many denominations because of the tendency of clergy to be transferred from one church to another at relatively frequent intervals. Also, in smaller communities, suitable housing is not always available. In addition, such a residence can be supplied in lieu of salary, which may not be able to be provided (especially at smaller congregations).

Catholic clergy houses in particular may be lived in by several priests from a parish. Clergy houses frequently serve as the administrative office of the local parish, as well as a residence. They are normally located next to, or at least close to, the church their occupant serves.

Partly because of the general conservation of churches, many clergy houses have survived and are of historic interest or importance. In the United Kingdom, the 14th-century Alfriston Clergy House was the first property to be acquired by the National Trust. It was purchased in a state of near ruin in 1896 for £10, the vicarage having moved elsewhere long before.

In some countries where the clergy houses were often rather grand, many of them have now been sold off by the churches and replaced by more modest properties. Numerous clergy houses have been acquired by families for use as private homes. Others have been adapted as offices or used for various civic functions. In many villages in England, the former clergy house is called the &quot;Old Vicarage&quot; or the &quot;Old Rectory&quot;. In Scotland, a former clergy house may be known as the &quot;Old Manse&quot;.

==Nomenclature==
There are a number of more specific terms whose use depends on the rank of the occupant, the denomination, and the locality. Above the parish level, a bishop&#x27;s house was traditionally called a &quot;Bishop&#x27;s palace&quot;, a dean&#x27;s residence is known as a deanery, and a canon lives in a canonry or &quot;canon&#x27;s house&quot;. Other clerical titles have different names for their houses.

A parsonage is where the parson of a church resides; a parson is the priest/presbyter of a parish church. A rectory is the residence of an ecclesiastical rector, although the name may also be applied to the home of an academic rector (e.g., a Scottish university rector), or other person with that title. In North American Anglicanism, a far greater proportion of parish clergy were (and still are) titled as rector than in Britain, so the term rectory is more common there.

The names used for homes of ordinary parish clergy vary considerably and include the following:
* The Anglican Communion uses the terms vicarage or (more informal and old-fashioned) parsonage, and rectory if appropriate. 
* Roman Catholics use the terms priory, clergy house, parochial house (mostly in Ireland), chapel house (in Scotland), presbytery, and rectory (especially in Massachusetts) if appropriate. In the Philippines, the term convent is used, a direct calque of the Spanish &quot;convento&quot;. An &quot;ecclesiastical residence&quot;, sometimes called a presbytery, is the residence of a cleric in their diocese or parish.
* Manse (cognate with mansion) is a Scottish term that is used in Scottish Presbyterianism, and also in other parts of the British Isles by Non-conformist churches such as the Methodists and the United Reformed Church. This name is also commonly used by Baptists in the United Kingdom and in some Commonwealth countries.
* Pastorium is the usual term in the Southern United States, especially among Baptists.
* Lutheran churches often use parsonage.
* The name &quot;parish house&quot; is used by many denominations.

<text>The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is a public research university in Birmingham, Alabama, United States. Founded in 1969 and part of the University of Alabama System, UAB has grown to be the state&#x27;s largest employer, with more than 24,200 faculty and staff and over 53,000 jobs at the university. The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

UAB offers 140 programs of study in 12 academic divisions leading to bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, doctoral, and professional degrees. In the fall of 2020, UAB enrolled 22,563 students from more than 110 countries. The UAB Health System, one of the largest academic medical centers in the United States, is affiliated with UAB.

The UAB athletic teams known as the Blazers compete in 18 varsity-level sports in the NCAA Division 1 - American Athletic Conference. Its official varsity colors are green and gold. The Blazers have won 11 conference championships to date.

== History ==
In 1936, in response to the rapid growth of the Birmingham metropolitan area and the need for the population to have access to a university education, the University of Alabama established the Birmingham Extension Center. The center operated in an old house in downtown Birmingham at 2131 6th Avenue North and enrolled 116 students. In 1945, UA&#x27;s newly established four-year School of Medicine moved from Tuscaloosa to Birmingham and took over management of Jefferson and Hillman hospitals. In 1957 enrollment at the extension center stood at 1,856. By 1959, research grants, training grants, and fellowships exceeded $1 million, and ground was broken for a new Children&#x27;s Hospital.

By the 1960s, it grew apparent that the extension center was becoming a university in its own right. An engineering building was built close to the medical center in 1962. In September 1966, the Extension Center was renamed the College of General Studies and elevated to a full four-year program. That November, the College of General Studies and the School of Medicine were merged into the University of Alabama in Birmingham, with Dr. Joseph Volker as &quot;Vice President for Birmingham Affairs&quot;–reflecting that it was still treated as an offsite department of the main campus in Tuscaloosa. An Advisory Board for UAB was created in 1967. In 1969, the legislature created the University of Alabama System. UAB became one of three four-year institutions within the new system, which also included UA and the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) in Huntsville. Volker became UAB&#x27;s first president.

== Campus ==

UAB is located on the Southside neighborhood of downtown Birmingham, Alabama, occupying more than 100 city blocks and surrounded by three historic district neighborhood including the Five Point South, Glen Iris, and the Southside. There is a blend of public and private property inside the university limits. I-65, 10th, 11th, and 12th Avenues South, 22nd Street South, and 2nd Avenue South are the boundaries of UAB campus. The campus has more than 216 academic, residential, and recreational facilities spread across around 636 acres, or roughly 16 million square feet of building area.

The UAB strategic plan&#x27;s pillars are supported by the campus master plan, which places an emphasis on innovative facilities and improved growth management. The campus master plan also includes the creation of eight zones concentration locations: Academics, Athletics &amp; Recreation, Cultural, Hospital/Highlands, Residential, Research, Southern Research, and Support with overlapping zone areas of collaboration such as Academic, Research, and Hospital. Honors Hall, the Collat School of Business, the School of Nursing, University Hall, Gold Hall, McMahon Hall, McCallum Basic Health Science Building, Early Learning Center, and the Technology Innovation Center are amongst the recently completed building construction projects on the university. The Science and Engineering Complex&#x27;s second phase project, the Altec/Styslinger Genomic Medicine &amp; Data Sciences Building, the Marnix E. Heersink Institute for Biomedical Innovation Conference Center, Biomedical Research and Psychology Building, Unity Park, Department of Art and Art History, Cooper Green Mercy Health, University Emergency Department, Rehabilitation Pavilion, 14th Street Parking Deck, and the Southern Research Biotechnology Building are among the ongoing constructions in the university. Since 2013, about 1.1 million gross square feet of new facilities have been added to UAB&#x27;s footprint through the completion or ongoing development of 17 major university construction projects.

===UAB Campus Green===

UAB&#x27;s Campus Green, also referred to as &quot;the Green&quot;, is an open green area and a quadrangle intended for usage by members of the university community and visitors. It was built in 2008 and considered to be the focal point of the campus. The university&#x27;s long-term master plan, which describes Campus Green as &quot;the signature open space and the center of the academic core,&quot; includes the quadrangle as a key element. The Green is surrounded by green grasses, plants, shrubs, trees and walkways, that include 10th Avenue South, University Boulevard, the Chemistry Building, University Dining Facility, Camp Hall, Blazer Hall, Heritage Hall, University Hall (UAB College of Arts &amp; Sciences) and the Campus Recreation Center.

<doc id="510056" wikidata="Q1431280" url="?curid=510056" title="Carduus nutans">
<text>Carduus nutans is a biennial plant in the daisy and sunflower family Asteraceae with the common names musk thistle, nodding thistle, and nodding plumeless thistle. It is native to regions of Europe, Central Asia, and North Africa, where it is a scattered pasture plant. The musk thistle has been declared as invasive in North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.

==Description==
&quot;Carduus nutans&quot; is a monocarpic herb and is classified as a biennial thistle, though it can have varying phenology depending on climate and habitat. Mature plants can reach in height with multi-branched stems. The leaves are prickly and jagged and can reach up to in length. The leaves are dark green, coarsely bipinnately lobed, with a smooth, waxy surface and sharp yellow-brown to whitish spines at the tips of the lobes. They are more or less hairy on top, and wooly on the veins below. The stem is cottony/hairy, The plants develop a rosette, with large leaves up to about long. The seeds are able to germinate between 15 °C to 30 °C, thriving in conditions that offer moist soil and an alternating day/night temperature. A single plant is able to produce around 100 seeds per flower, up to about 20,000 seeds per plant. Seeds are mainly wind dispersed and can survive in the soil seed bank for up to 20 years.

===Flowers===


The plant bears showy flowers that range from a deep rose to violet color, rarely white. The large globose flower heads, containing hundreds of tiny individual flowers, are (rarely to 7 cm) in diameter and occur at the tips of stems. The flower heads commonly droop to a 90° to 120° angle from the stem when mature, hence its alternate name of &quot;nodding thistle&quot;. Each plant may produce thousands of straw-colored seeds adorned with plume-like bristles. They are 4 to 6 cm across, with purple-red bracts.

The number of flower heads per plant is site-dependent and ranges from about 20–50 on good sites and 1–20 on poor sites. Flowering occurs from June to October, and seed dissemination occurs approximately one month after the flowers form.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Carduus nutans&quot; is native to Europe, Western Siberia, Asia, and North Africa. It has become invasive in North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Southern Africa. It is abundant in the North American Rocky Mountains. The plant can grow at least to an elevation of . It typically grows in meadows and grasslands, in heavily grazed land in areas such as pastures, and on open disturbed soil such as roadsides and building sites. It is found in neutral to acidic soils. It spreads rapidly in areas subjected to frequent natural disturbances such as landslides and flooding, but does not grow well in excessively wet, dry, or shady conditions.

== Uses ==

=== Medicinal ===
Herbal decoctions have historically included &quot;Carduus nutans.&quot; Turkish folk medicine has used parts of the flowering branches to treat prostate disease. It has also been documented that it has been used for treatment of liver disease, malaria, constipation, and kidney stones.

== Ecology ==
Climate and habitat play a large role in phenology of &quot;Carduus nutans&quot;. Classified as a biennial, it can also act as a summer or winter annual, as well as a perennial, depending on varying environmental conditions.

== Invasive species ==
&quot;C. nutans&quot; is an invasive species in various regions around the world, including in disturbed and agricultural settings, pastures, rangelands, along roadsides, and in natural habitats. The first report of &quot;C. nutans&quot; in the United States was in Pennsylvania in 1953. It is declared a noxious weed in many U.S. states, Canadian provinces, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. The plant is especially fertile, producing up to 20,000 seeds per plant, that allows it to take root quickly and replace natural vegetation. Pastures and rangelands suffer from decreased productivity and the sharp spines of the plant make an unsuitable grazing area for livestock.

=== Biological control ===
Several biological control agents have been released in attempt to control &quot;C. nutans.&quot; In Australia, some of those that have been released include &quot;Rhinocyllus conicus, Urophora solstitialis,&quot; and &quot;Trichosirocalus horridus.&quot; In the United States there has been success with &quot;Rhinocyllus conicus, Trichosirocalus horridus, and Puccinia carduorum.&quot; Previous populations in Southern California were eradicated, but it remains in northern California. When biological control is successful, natural plants are shown to return to the habitat.

== Effects on biodiversity ==
&quot;C. nutans&quot; reduces forage biomass availability for livestock through competition for nutrients The spiny plants affect movement of animals through the area, further decreasing availability of forage biomass. It also causes soil erosion on roadways and wastelands.

<doc id="510060" wikidata="Q1050633" url="?curid=510060" title="Intermediate-mass black hole">
<text>An intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) is a class of black hole with mass in the range of one hundred to one hundred thousand (102–105) solar masses: significantly higher than stellar black holes but lower than the hundred thousand to more than one billion (105–109) solar mass supermassive black holes. Several IMBH candidate objects have been discovered in the Milky Way galaxy and others nearby, based on indirect gas cloud velocity and accretion disk spectra observations of various evidentiary strength.

== Observational evidence ==
The gravitational wave signal GW190521, which occurred on 21 May 2019 at 03:02:29 UTC, and was published on 2 September 2020, resulted from the merger of two black holes. They had masses of 85 and 65 solar masses and merged to form a black hole of 142 solar masses, with 8 solar masses radiated away as gravitational waves.

Before that, the strongest evidence for IMBHs came from a few low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. Due to their activity, these galaxies almost certainly contain accreting black holes, and in some cases the black hole masses can be estimated using the technique of reverberation mapping. For instance, the spiral galaxy NGC 4395 at a distance of about 4 Mpc appears to contain a black hole with mass of about solar masses.

The largest up-to-date sample of intermediate-mass black holes includes 305 candidates selected by sophisticated analysis of one million optical spectra of galaxies collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. X-ray emission was detected from 10 of these candidates confirming their classification as IMBH.

Some ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in nearby galaxies are suspected to be IMBHs, with masses of a hundred to a thousand solar masses. The ULXs are observed in star-forming regions (e.g., in starburst galaxy M82), and are seemingly associated with young star clusters which are also observed in these regions. However, only a dynamical mass measurement from the analysis of the optical spectrum of the companion star can unveil the presence of an IMBH as the compact accretor of the ULX.

A few globular clusters have been claimed to contain IMBHs, based on measurements of the velocities of stars near their centers; the figure shows one candidate object. However, none of the claimed detections has stood up to scrutiny. For instance, the data for M31 G1, the object shown in the figure, can be fit equally well without a massive central object.

Additional evidence for the existence of IMBHs can be obtained from observation of gravitational radiation, emitted from a binary containing an IMBH and a compact remnant or another IMBH.

Finally, the M–sigma relation predicts the existence of black holes with masses of 104 to 106 solar masses in low-luminosity galaxies. The smallest black hole from the M–sigma relation prediction is the nucleus of RGG 118 galaxy with only about 50,000 solar masses.

== Potential discoveries ==
In November 2004 a team of astronomers reported the discovery of GCIRS 13E, the first intermediate-mass black hole in the Milky Way galaxy, orbiting three light-years from Sagittarius A*. This medium black hole of 1,300 solar masses is within a cluster of seven stars, possibly the remnant of a massive star cluster that has been stripped down by the Galactic Center. This observation may add support to the idea that supermassive black holes grow by absorbing nearby smaller black holes and stars. However, in 2005, a German research group claimed that the presence of an IMBH near the galactic center is doubtful, based on a dynamical study of the star cluster in which the IMBH was said to reside. An IMBH near the galactic center could also be detected via its perturbations on stars orbiting around the supermassive black hole.

In January 2006 a team led by Philip Kaaret of the University of Iowa announced the discovery of a quasiperiodic oscillation from an intermediate-mass black hole candidate located using NASA&#x27;s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. The candidate, M82 X-1, is orbited by a red giant star that is shedding its atmosphere into the black hole. Neither the existence of the oscillation nor its interpretation as the orbital period of the system are fully accepted by the rest of the scientific community, as the periodicity claimed is based on only about four cycles, meaning that it is possible for this to be random variation. If the period is real, it could be either the orbital period, as suggested, or a super-orbital period in the accretion disk, as is seen in many other systems.

In 2009, a team of astronomers led by Sean Farrell discovered HLX-1, an intermediate-mass black hole with a smaller cluster of stars around it, in the galaxy ESO 243–49. This evidence suggested that ESO 243-49 had a galactic collision with HLX-1&#x27;s galaxy and absorbed the majority of the smaller galaxy&#x27;s matter.

A team at the CSIRO radio telescope in Australia announced on 9 July 2012 that it had discovered the first intermediate-mass black hole.

In 2015 a team at Keio University in Japan found a gas cloud (CO-0.40-0.22) with very wide velocity dispersion. They performed simulations and concluded that a model with a black hole of around 100,000 solar masses would be the best fit for the velocity distribution. However, a later work pointed out some difficulties with the association of high-velocity dispersion clouds with intermediate mass black holes and proposed that such clouds might be generated by supernovae.
Further theoretical studies of the gas cloud and nearby IMBH candidates have been inconclusive but have reopened the possibility.
In 2017, it was announced that a black hole of a few thousand solar masses may be located in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. This was based on the accelerations and distributions of pulsars in the cluster; however, a later analysis of an updated and more complete data set on these pulsars found no positive evidence for this.

In 2018, the Keio University team found several molecular gas streams orbiting around an invisible object near the galactic center, designated HCN-0.009-0.044, suggested that it is a black hole of 32,000 solar masses and, if so, is the third IMBH discovered in the region.

Observations in 2019 found evidence for a gravitational wave event (GW190521) arising from the merger of two stellar-mass black holes, with masses of 66 and 85 times that of the Sun. In September 2020 it was announced that the resulting merged black hole weighed 142 solar masses, with 9 solar masses being radiated away as gravitational waves.

In 2020, astronomers reported the possible finding of an intermediate-mass black hole, named 3XMM J215022.4-055108, in the direction of the Aquarius constellation, about 740 million light years from Earth.

In 2021 the discovery of a 100,000 solar-mass intermediate-mass black hole in the globular cluster B023-G78 in the Andromeda Galaxy was posted to arXiv in a preprint.

In 2023, an analysis of proper motions of the closest known globular cluster, Messier 4, revealed an excess mass of roughly 800 solar masses in the center, which appears to not be extended, and could thus be considered as kinematic evidence for an IMBH (even if an unusually compact cluster of compact objects, white dwarfs, neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes cannot be completely discounted).

A study from July 10, 2024, examined seven fast-moving stars from the center of the globular cluster Omega Centauri, finding that these stars were consistent with being bound to an intermediate-mass black hole of at least 8,200 solar masses.

==Origin==
Intermediate-mass black holes are too massive to be formed by the collapse of a single star, which is how stellar black holes are thought to form. Their environments lack the extreme conditions—i.e., high density and velocities observed at the centers of galaxies—which seemingly lead to the formation of supermassive black holes. There are three postulated formation scenarios for IMBHs. The first is the merging of stellar mass black holes and other compact objects by means of accretion. The second one is the runaway collision of massive stars in dense stellar clusters and the collapse of the collision product into an IMBH. The third is that they are primordial black holes formed in the Big Bang.

Scientists have also considered the possibility of the creation of intermediate-mass black holes through mechanisms involving the collapse of a single star, such as the possibility of direct collapse into black holes of stars with pre-supernova helium core mass &gt; (to avoid a pair instability supernova which would completely disrupt the star), requiring an initial total stellar mass of &gt; , but there may be little chance of observing such a high-mass supernova remnant. Recent theories suggest that such massive stars which could lead to the formation of intermediate mass black holes may form in young star clusters via multiple stellar collisions.

<doc id="510075" wikidata="Q295364" url="?curid=510075" title="Ben Wallace (basketball)">
<text>Ben Camey Wallace (born September 10, 1974) is an American basketball executive and former professional player who played most of his career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Detroit Pistons. Nicknamed &quot;Big Ben&quot;, he is often regarded as the greatest undrafted player in NBA history, and is known for his shot-blocking, rebounding, and overall defensive play. 

A native of Alabama, Wallace attended Cuyahoga Community College and Virginia Union University. In an NBA career that spanned from 1996 to 2012, he played with the Washington Bullets/Wizards, Orlando Magic, Chicago Bulls, and Cleveland Cavaliers as well as the Pistons. Wallace won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award four times, a record he shares with Dikembe Mutombo and Rudy Gobert. In nine seasons with the Pistons (2000–2006; 2009–2012), Wallace made two NBA Finals appearances (2004 and 2005) and won a championship in 2004. The Pistons retired his jersey No. 3 in 2016. Wallace was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in the class of 2021.

Wallace has served as a basketball operations and team engagement advisor for the Pistons since 2021.

==Early life ==
Ben Camey Wallace was born on September 10, 1974, in White Hall, Alabama, a small town in Lowndes County. He is the tenth of eleven children. He attended Central High School in Hayneville where he received all-state honors in basketball, baseball, and football (as a linebacker). Former NBA player Charles Oakley was Wallace&#x27;s mentor, having discovered Wallace at a 1991 basketball camp, and later recommended Wallace to his previous college, Virginia Union.

==College career==
Wallace first played college basketball on the junior college level at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland for two years. There, staples of Wallace&#x27;s defensive prowess were shown as he averaged 17.0 rebounds and 6.9 blocks per game. He then transferred to Virginia Union, an NCAA Division II school, where he studied criminal justice. Wallace averaged 13.4 points per game and 10.0 rebounds per game as a member of the Virginia Union Panthers, whom he led to the Division II Final Four and a 28–3 record. As a senior, Wallace was named by the head coaches of Virginia Union&#x27;s conference, the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association, to the All-CIAA first team, and was also selected as a first-team Division II All-American by the National Association of Basketball Coaches.

== Professional career ==

=== Viola Reggio Calabria (1996) ===
After leaving Virginia Union and going undrafted, he travelled to Italy for a tryout with the Italian team Viola Reggio Calabria, where he played only one game in the 1996–97 Italian Basketball Cup against Faber Fabriano on August 29, 1996.

===Washington Bullets / Wizards (1996–1999)===
Wallace appeared in only 34 games for Washington in the 1996–97 season and did not play many minutes. The following year, he appeared in 67 games and started in 16, but did not average many points (3.1) or rebounds (4.8). He did manage to average 1.1 blocks throughout the season, however, and his defensive play solidified his identity and his minutes increased significantly in the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, as he started in 16 of 46 games and averaged 6.0 points, 8.3 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game. Washington was unable to make the playoffs for three straight years.

===Orlando Magic (1999–2000)===
On August 11, 1999, Wallace was traded to the Orlando Magic in a multiplayer deal for Isaac Austin. In the 1999–2000 season, he solidified his role as a starter, starting in all 81 games that he appeared in. He averaged 4.8 points, 8.2 rebounds and 1.6 blocks for the Magic as they won 41 games. However, the Magic failed to make the playoffs and following the season, the Magic traded Wallace, along with Chucky Atkins, to the Detroit Pistons as compensation in a sign-and-trade deal for superstar forward and free agent Grant Hill.

===Detroit Pistons (2000–2006)===

====Rise to defensive dominance (2000–2003)====
The trade for Hill was considered one-sided, but in the 2000–01 season, Wallace had his most productive season yet, averaging 6.4 points per game while placing second in rebounds with 13.2 per game and tenth in blocks per game with 2.3, but the Pistons could not make the playoffs. The 2001–02 season would be even better for Wallace, as he averaged his most points per game for a season yet at 7.6 points, while leading the league in rebounding with 13.0 per game and shot blocking with 3.5. His strong defensive play earned him the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, while also being named to the All-Defensive First Team and the All-NBA Third Team. The Pistons won 50 games and the Central Division, and would defeat the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the playoffs before falling to the Paul Pierce-led Boston Celtics in the conference semifinals. Wallace opened the playoffs with a 19-point, 20-rebound effort against Toronto, and he managed to grab 20 or more rebounds two more times in 10 total playoff games, his first experience in the playoffs.

The 2002–03 season would result in another Defensive Player of the Year Award for Wallace, as well as another selection to the All-Defensive team along with being named to the All-NBA Second Team, as he increased his rebounding to 15.4 per game. The Pistons won 50 games and the Central Division again, and defeated Orlando in a grueling seven-game first-round series that included coming back from a 3–1 deficit. Detroit would go on to defeat the Philadelphia 76ers in six games, but the Pistons were swept by the defending Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Nets in the Conference Finals. Wallace increased his rebounding to 16.3 per game in the playoffs, and reached 20 or more rebounds four times.

====NBA champion and return to the NBA Finals (2003–2005)====

The 2003–04 season saw Wallace continue to rank among the league leaders in rebounding (12.4 per game) and blocks (3.2 per game). Despite losing out on a third straight Defensive Player of the Year Award to Ron Artest, Wallace increased his scoring average to 9.5 points per game, and was named again to the All-Defensive First Team and the All-NBA Second Team. The season also featured new head coach Larry Brown, and he would lead the Pistons to 54 wins for the season, which included a late season acquisition of star power forward Rasheed Wallace to further improve the team&#x27;s defense and scoring. In the playoffs, the Pistons handily defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in five games in the first round, before facing New Jersey for the second straight year. Despite taking a two-game lead to open the series, the Nets would put up a fight against the Pistons to win three straight games, and the Pistons responded with an 81–75 road win in New Jersey (in which Wallace grabbed 20 rebounds) before wrapping up the series with a 90–69 Game 7 win. The Pistons would then face the Jermaine O&#x27;Neal and Ron Artest-led, league-leading Indiana Pacers, and the two teams traded wins in the first four games. The Pistons won the next two games of the series, allowing them to advance to the Finals with Wallace scoring 12 points and grabbing 16 rebounds in the closing game of the series.

Detroit had not reached the Finals since 1990. The Pistons dominated in Game 1 with an 87–75 win in Los Angeles against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers would respond in Game 2 with late-game heroics by team leaders Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal before the series moved to Detroit, but the combined defensive effort and near-perfect offensive execution at home brought the Pistons an 88–68 win in Game 3. The Lakers were unable to respond in Game 4, as the Pistons held their own and continued to dominate on defense and rebounding to beat the Lakers 88–80. Los Angeles needed one win to return the series to their home court, but the Pistons proved to be far too dominating again in Game 5, as Detroit won the game 100–87 to win the NBA championship led by Wallace who posted his best game of the series with 18 points and 22 rebounds. It would be the third NBA title for the franchise and its first since 1990. Wallace held his own against the likes of Indiana&#x27;s Jermaine O&#x27;Neal and then Shaquille O&#x27;Neal in the Finals, posting averages of 10.3 points per game with 14.3 rebounds and 2.4 blocks. In the 2003–04 season and 2004 playoffs, Wallace posted individual Defensive Ratings of 87 and 84, respectively. Among players with a comparable number of games and minutes played, both of these marks are the lowest individual defensive ratings posted in a regular season or playoffs. The Pistons also began a tradition of sounding a deep chime whenever &quot;Big Ben&quot; scored or recorded a block on Detroit&#x27;s home court, The Palace of Auburn Hills—an allusion to the original Big Ben in London.

The defending champions looked forward to defending their title in the 2004–05 season, but the season would take an unexpected turn near the end of a November 19 game against the Indiana Pacers, in which Wallace and Ron Artest sparred with each other before the infamous brawl named &quot;The Malice at the Palace&quot; involving both players and spectators took place. Wallace was suspended for six games, and his brother David Wallace received a year of probation and community service for punching Indiana&#x27;s Fred Jones in the stands. Wallace continued to dominate on defense (2.4 blocks per game) and rebounding (12.2 per game), and increased his scoring production on his way to winning another Defensive Player of the Year Award along with yet another selection to the All-Defensive First Team and the All-NBA Third Team. In the playoffs, the Pistons dominated the Philadelphia 76ers before defeating their rival Pacers in the semifinals in six games. The Conference Finals would feature a matchup with the resurgent Miami Heat, who had acquired Shaquille O&#x27;Neal from the Lakers, and were led in scoring by Dwyane Wade. The teams traded victories before Miami won game 5 to take a 3–2 series lead, but the Pistons responded and took advantage of an injury to Wade in game 6 before grinding out a difficult 88–82 Game 7 win on the road in Miami to advance to their second straight Finals. Wallace once again held his own against O&#x27;Neal throughout the series.

This time in the Finals, Detroit would face the San Antonio Spurs, led by superstar Tim Duncan, and international players such as Tony Parker and Manu Ginóbili. The Spurs won the first two games at home before the Pistons matched them with two wins in Detroit, setting up a crucial Game 5 in which San Antonio managed a one-point victory. Detroit would respond with a win on the road in Game 6, but had no answer for Duncan and the Spurs&#x27; attack and lost the series in Game 7. Wallace averaged 10 points and 11.3 rebounds throughout the 2005 playoffs.

====Final season in Detroit (2005–2006)====
Despite the disappointing Finals&#x27; loss, the Pistons returned with a vengeance in the 2005–06 season, with Wallace winning another consecutive Defensive Player of the Year Award, a fifth straight selection to the All-Defensive First Team and another selection to the All-NBA Third Team. He was named an All-Star for the fourth straight season, and led the league in total offensive rebounds with 301. Detroit was dominant throughout the season, winning 64 games and earning the top seed in the conference. The playoffs featured a dominating win over Milwaukee in the first round followed by a grueling seven-game series win against the young Cleveland Cavaliers led by All-Star forward LeBron James. This set up a conference finals rematch with Miami, who had retooled their roster in the off-season. The Pistons struggled throughout the series with the impressive play of Dwyane Wade, who dominated offensively on the way to a 4–2 victory. Miami would go on to win that year&#x27;s NBA title. Wallace&#x27;s production fell significantly as compared to previous seasons in the playoffs, as he only averaged 4.7 points per game, 10.5 rebounds and just 1.2 blocks. In the off-season, he would test free agency and eventually signed with the younger Chicago Bulls, thereby ending an era of Detroit Pistons basketball which had relied on him as a defensive and rebounding anchor. In each of the five years that the Pistons made the playoffs with Wallace, Detroit allowed the fewest points per game out of all 16 playoff teams. The same year, Wallace had an altercation with Flip Saunders during Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals that drew him even further away from re-signing with the team, as Saunders made the controversial decision to bench him in the entire fourth quarter in that game. Without Wallace, the Pistons fell to third in points per game allowed in the 2007 and 2008 playoffs.

===Chicago Bulls (2006–2008)===

In July 2006, Wallace agreed to a four-year, $60 million deal with the Chicago Bulls. Chicago Bulls coach Scott Skiles had a strict &quot;no-headband&quot; policy, but decided to make an exception for Wallace when his teammates voted in favor of allowing him to keep the signature headband. Wallace continued to be relied upon as a defensive stopper and rebounder, as the Bulls already featured scoring from Kirk Hinrich, Ben Gordon, and Luol Deng. While his overall averages decreased from previous years, he still managed to average double figure rebounds (10.7 per game) and posted 2.0 blocks per game for the season. The Bulls won 49 games, and entered the playoffs with a first round matchup against the defending champion Miami Heat. The series would mark the fourth straight year that Wallace faced off with Shaquille O&#x27;Neal in the playoffs, and while the Heat were more experienced they also had played an inconsistent regular season with Dwyane Wade missing games due to injury. The Bulls on the other hand were ready to take on the older Heat, and shocked Miami with a four-game sweep with an average win margin of 11 points. Wallace posted 13 points with 11 rebounds in the close out game in Miami, and the Bulls advanced to face his former Pistons team. Despite no longer featuring Wallace and being older, the Pistons dominated the first three games to take a 3–0 lead before Chicago responded at home in game 4 with Wallace scoring 11 points with 17 rebounds. Chicago also went on to win Game 5 in Detroit, but could not extend the series to a seventh game as the Pistons proved too experienced for the younger team. Wallace averaged 8.7 points with 9.5 rebounds in 10 playoff games.

The Bulls started the 2007–08 season with a 9–16 record before Skiles was removed as head coach. During his nearly two-year run in Chicago, Wallace battled with various knee injuries and averaged 5.7 points, 9.7 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 2.0 blocks per game.

===Cleveland Cavaliers (2008–2009)===

In February 2008, Wallace was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in a three-team deal involving the Seattle SuperSonics, in which the Cavaliers received Wallace, as well as Bulls teammate Joe Smith and Seattle&#x27;s Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West. The Bulls received Shannon Brown, Larry Hughes, Cedric Simmons, and Drew Gooden from the Cavaliers, and the Sonics received Cleveland&#x27;s Ira Newble and Donyell Marshall and Chicago&#x27;s Adrian Griffin.

The Cavaliers already featured Zydrunas Ilgauskas as the team&#x27;s starting center, so coach Mike Brown moved Wallace to the power forward position. Wallace played in 22 regular season games (all starts) and averaged 4.2 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.7 blocks per game. Wallace had a Cavalier regular season high of 12 points on February 24, 2008, against the Memphis Grizzlies, and had regular season Cavaliers&#x27; highs of 15 rebounds against the Charlotte Bobcats and four blocks against the Orlando Magic. In the playoffs, Wallace played in 13 games (all starts) and averaged 3.2 points, 6.5 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per game. He had his playoff high of 12 rebounds in Game 4 win against the Washington Wizards in the first round of the playoffs as the Cavaliers swept the Wizards. The following series would be against the resurgent Boston Celtics. The series would go to seven games, with the Celtics winning the final game at home and Wallace failing to register double figure rebounds in the series.

On June 25, 2009, Wallace was traded to the Phoenix Suns with Sasha Pavlović, a second-round draft pick and $500,000 for Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. On July 13, 2009, the Suns bought out Wallace&#x27;s $14 million contract, saving $8 million in the process. Wallace actually received $10 million but Phoenix was in luxury tax so the savings were effectively doubled.

===Return to Detroit (2009–2012)===
On August 7, 2009, Wallace agreed to re-sign with the Pistons as a free agent to a one-year deal. He formerly wore jersey No. 3 with the Pistons, but changed his jersey to No. 6 upon his return, allowing Rodney Stuckey to keep that number. On July 11, 2010, Wallace agreed to a two-year deal with the Pistons.

On August 4, 2010, Wallace was re-signed by the Pistons. On November 30, 2010, in a 90–79 road loss to the Orlando Magic, Wallace surpassed the 10,000-rebound mark for his career, becoming the 34th player in NBA history to achieve that mark.

On December 22, 2010, in a 115–93 road win over the Toronto Raptors, Wallace played his 1,000th game and became the 95th player in NBA history to achieve this record. On February 14, 2012, Wallace played his 1,055th game, surpassing the record held by Avery Johnson for most games by an undrafted player.

On January 16, 2016, the Pistons retired Wallace&#x27;s No. 3 jersey.

==Player profile==

Wallace was listed at , though he has stated that he is closer to . Even though his height was more suited for the power forward position, he primarily played as center due to his strength and athleticism. Wallace became known for his prolific rebounding and shot blocking. He was voted the NBA Defensive Player of the Year four times in five years, finishing as a close runner-up in the other season. He is one of only five players to collect more blocks than personal fouls (minimum 150 games) and the only player among those to also have more steals than turnovers.

However, Wallace was never a potent scorer, averaging 5.7 points per game in his career. The majority of his points came from offensive put-backs, baskets in transition, or other high-percentage field goals. Wallace also holds the record for worst free-throw shooting percentage in NBA history, at under 42 percent (minimum 1,000 free-throw attempts).

==Executive career==
In 2018, Wallace joined the Pistons&#x27; NBA G League affiliate, the Grand Rapids Drive, as an ownership partner, serving in that role until they became an affiliate of the Denver Nuggets and renamed the Gold. In 2021, he was named the Pistons&#x27; basketball operations and team engagement advisor.

==Personal life==
Wallace is married to Chanda Wallace and is the father of two sons, Ben Jr. and Bryce, and one daughter, Bailey.

Wallace appeared on the cover of &quot;ESPN NBA 2K5&quot;. An inflatable basketball training aid of Wallace&#x27;s likeness, called the Inflatable Defender, was manufactured by PlayAir Systems. His sneaker, the &quot;Big Ben&quot;, was released on November 5, 2007, under Stephon Marbury&#x27;s Starbury label and sold for US$14.98 ($ with inflation) at Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s stores.

In 2011, Wallace was arrested and charged with DWI and carrying a concealed weapon. He was sentenced to a year of probation.

In March 2014, Wallace was sentenced to a year of jail, with all but two days suspended, after he pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident in Richmond, Virginia, on February 8, 2014.

In 2022, Wallace launched his line of cannabis products named &quot;Undrafted&quot; developed in partnership with the cannabis company Rair. Wallace stated: &quot;Cannabis has helped me safely relieve the aches and pains and different stressors that have built up from the many years as an athlete. There&#x27;s no denying that marijuana has a healing upside for athletes or anyone struggling with pain — so alongside launching the Undrafted brand, the Rair team and I will continue to push to end this stigma associated with cannabis use.&quot; That year, he also purchased a minority stake in Green Door Distilling.

<text>Rhaponticum repens, synonyms including Acroptilon repens and Leuzea repens, with the common name Russian knapweed, is a species of bushy rhizomatous perennial, up to 80 cm tall. Stems and leaves are finely arachnoid-tomentose becoming glabrous and green with age. The rosette leaves are oblanceolate, pinnately lobed to entire, 2–3 cm wide by 3–8 cm long. The lower cauline leaves are smaller, pinnately lobed; the upper leaves become much reduced, sessile, serrate to entire. The heads are numerous terminating the branches. Flowers are pink to purplish, the marginal ones not enlarged. The outer and middle involucral bracts are broad, striate, smooth with broadly rounded tips; the inner bracts are narrower with hairy tips. Pappus present with bristles 6–11 mm long. Fruit is a whitish, slightly ridged achene.

Russian knapweed is a deep-rooted long-lived perennial. Some stands have been in existence for 75 years. It forms dense colonies in cultivated fields, orchards, pastures, and roadsides.

A native to Eurasia, Russian knapweed was introduced into North America in the late 19th century. Absent only from southeastern U.S., it has become widespread in other regions, especially in the western United States.

Nigropallidal encephalomalacia, also called &quot;chewing disease&quot;, a movement disorder similar to Parkinson&#x27;s disease, is caused in horses ingesting Russian knapweed for prolonged periods. A sesquiterpene lactone, repin, in the plant is likely responsible for this toxicity.
==Taxonomy==
The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1763 as &quot;Centaurea repens&quot;. Augustin Pyramus de Candolle separated it from the genus &quot;Centaurea&quot; in 1838, placing it in the genus &quot;Acroptilon&quot;. The genus name derives from &quot;acro-&quot; (high, here meaning tip) and &quot;ptilo-&quot; (feather). A 1995 molecular phylogenetic study, the structure of the flower, and the chromosome number support separating it from the genus &quot;Centaurea&quot;. Some sources then continue to place it as the sole member of the monotypic genus &quot;Acroptilon&quot;. A phylogenetic study published in 2006 concluded that &quot;Acroptilon&quot; belongs in the genus &quot;Rhaponticum&quot;.

<text>In computer science, computer engineering and programming language implementations, a stack machine is a computer processor or a virtual machine in which the primary interaction is moving short-lived temporary values to and from a push down stack. In the case of a hardware processor, a hardware stack is used. The use of a stack significantly reduces the required number of processor registers. Stack machines extend push-down automata with additional load/store operations or multiple stacks and hence are Turing-complete.

== Design ==
Most or all stack machine instructions assume that operands will be from the stack, and results placed in the stack. The stack easily holds more than two inputs or more than one result, so a rich set of operations can be computed. In stack machine code (sometimes called p-code), instructions will frequently have only an opcode commanding an operation, with no additional fields identifying a constant, register or memory cell, known as a zero address format. A computer that operates in such a way that the majority of its instructions do not include explicit addresses is said to utilize zero-address instructions. This greatly simplifies instruction decoding. Branches, load immediates, and load/store instructions require an argument field, but stack machines often arrange that the frequent cases of these still fit together with the opcode into a compact group of bits. The selection of operands from prior results is done implicitly by ordering the instructions. Some stack machine instruction sets are intended for interpretive execution of a virtual machine, rather than driving hardware directly.

Integer constant operands are pushed by or instructions. Memory is often accessed by separate or instructions containing a memory address or calculating the address from values in the stack. All practical stack machines have variants of the load–store opcodes for accessing local variables and formal parameters without explicit address calculations. This can be by offsets from the current top-of-stack address, or by offsets from a stable frame-base register.

The instruction set carries out most ALU actions with postfix (reverse Polish notation) operations that work only on the expression stack, not on data registers or main memory cells. This can be very convenient for executing high-level languages because most arithmetic expressions can be easily translated into postfix notation.

For example, consider the expression &quot;A&quot;*(&quot;B&quot;-&quot;C&quot;)+(&quot;D&quot;+&quot;E&quot;), written in reverse Polish notation as &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; - * &quot;D&quot; &quot;E&quot; + +. Compiling and running this on a simple imaginary stack machine would take the form:

 # stack contents (leftmost = top = most recent):
 push A # A
 push B # B A
 push C # C B A
 subtract # B-C A
 multiply # A*(B-C)
 push D # D A*(B-C)
 push E # E D A*(B-C)
 add # D+E A*(B-C)
 add # A*(B-C)+(D+E)

The arithmetic operations &#x27;subtract&#x27;, &#x27;multiply&#x27;, and &#x27;add&#x27; act on the two topmost operands of the stack. The computer takes both operands from the topmost (most recent) values of the stack. The computer replaces those two values with the calculated difference, sum, or product. In other words the instruction&#x27;s operands are &quot;popped&quot; off the stack, and its result(s) are then &quot;pushed&quot; back onto the stack, ready for the next instruction.

Stack machines may have their expression stack and their call-return stack separated or as one integrated structure. If they are separated, the instructions of the stack machine can be pipelined with fewer interactions and less design complexity, so it will usually run faster.

Optimisation of compiled stack code is quite possible. Back-end optimisation of compiler output has been demonstrated to significantly improve code, and potentially performance, whilst global optimisation within the compiler itself achieves further gains.

=== Stack storage ===
Some stack machines have a stack of limited size, implemented as a register file. The ALU will access this with an index. A large register file uses a lot of transistors and hence this method is only suitable for small systems. A few machines have both an expression stack in memory and a separate register stack. In this case, software, or an interrupt may move data between them. Some machines have a stack of unlimited size, implemented as an array in RAM, which is cached by some number of &quot;top of stack&quot; address registers to reduce memory access. Except for explicit &quot;load from memory&quot; instructions, the order of operand usage is identical with the order of the operands in the data stack, so excellent prefetching can be accomplished easily.

Consider . It compiles to ; ; . With a stack stored completely in RAM, this does implicit writes and reads of the in-memory stack:
* Load X, push to memory
* Load 1, push to memory
* Pop 2 values from memory, add, and push result to memory
for a total of 5 data cache references.

The next step up from this is a stack machine or interpreter with a single top-of-stack register. The above code then does:
* Load X into empty TOS register (if hardware machine) or Push TOS register to memory, Load X into TOS register (if interpreter)
* Push TOS register to memory, Load 1 into TOS register
* Pop left operand from memory, add to TOS register and leave it there
for a total of 3 data cache references, worst-case. Generally, interpreters don&#x27;t track emptiness, because they don&#x27;t have to—anything below the stack pointer is a non-empty value, and the TOS cache register is always kept hot. Typical Java interpreters do not buffer the top-of-stack this way, however, because the program and stack have a mix of short and wide data values.

If the hardwired stack machine has 2 or more top-stack registers, or a register file, then all memory access is avoided in this example and there is only 1 data cache cycle.

== History and implementations ==
Description of such a method requiring only two values at a time to be held in registers, with a limited set of pre-defined operands that were able to be extended by definition of further operands, functions and subroutines, was first provided at conference by Robert S. Barton in 1961.

===Commercial stack machines===

Examples of stack instruction sets directly executed in hardware include
* the Z4 (1945) computer by Konrad Zuse had a 2-level stack.
* the Burroughs large systems architecture (since 1961)
* the English Electric KDF9 machine. First delivered in 1964, the KDF9 had a 19-level deep pushdown stack of arithmetic registers, and a 17-level deep stack for subroutine return addresses
* the Collins Radio Collins Adaptive Processing System minicomputer (CAPS, since 1969) and Rockwell Collins Advanced Architecture Microprocessor (AAMP, since 1981).
* the Xerox Dandelion, introduced 27 April 1981, and the Xerox Daybreak utilized a stack machine architecture to save memory.
* the UCSD Pascal p-machine (as the Pascal MicroEngine and many others) supported a complete student programming environment on early 8-bit microprocessors with poor instruction sets and little RAM, by compiling to a virtual stack machine.
* MU5 and ICL 2900 Series. Hybrid stack and accumulator machines. The accumulator register buffered the memory stack&#x27;s top data value. Variants of load and store opcodes controlled when that register was spilled to the memory stack or reloaded from there.
* HP 3000 (Classic, not PA-RISC)
* HP 9000 systems based on the HP FOCUS microprocessor.
* Tandem Computers T/16. Like HP 3000, except that compilers, not microcode, controlled when the register stack spilled to the memory stack or was refilled from the memory stack.
* the Atmel MARC4 microcontroller

* ZPU A physically-small CPU designed to supervise FPGA systems.
*Some technical handheld calculators use reverse Polish notation in their keyboard interface, instead of having parenthesis keys. This is a form of stack machine. The Plus key relies on its two operands already being at the correct topmost positions of the user-visible stack.

===Virtual stack machines===
Examples of virtual stack machines interpreted in software:
* the Whetstone ALGOL 60 interpretive code, on which some features of the Burroughs B6500 were based
* the UCSD Pascal p-machine; which closely resembled Burroughs
* the Niklaus Wirth p-code machine

* the Lua (programming language) C API
* the TON Virtual Machine (TVM) for The Open Network smart contratcs

===Hybrid machines===
Pure stack machines are quite inefficient for procedures which access multiple fields from the same object. The stack machine code must reload the object pointer for each pointer+offset calculation. A common fix for this is to add some register-machine features to the stack machine: a visible register file dedicated to holding addresses, and register-style instructions for doing loads and simple address calculations. It is uncommon to have the registers be fully general purpose, because then there is no strong reason to have an expression stack and postfix instructions.

Another common hybrid is to start with a register machine architecture, and add another memory address mode which emulates the push or pop operations of stack machines: &#x27;memaddress = reg; reg += instr.displ&#x27;. This was first used in DEC&#x27;s PDP-11 minicomputer. This feature was carried forward in VAX computers and in Motorola 6809 and M68000 microprocessors. This allowed the use of simpler stack methods in early compilers. It also efficiently supported virtual machines using stack interpreters or threaded code. However, this feature did not help the register machine&#x27;s own code to become as compact as pure stack machine code. Also, the execution speed was less than when compiling well to the register architecture. It is faster to change the top-of-stack pointer only occasionally (once per call or return) rather than constantly stepping it up and down throughout each program statement, and it is even faster to avoid memory references entirely.

More recently, so-called second-generation stack machines have adopted a dedicated collection of registers to serve as address registers, off-loading the task of memory addressing from the data stack. For example, MuP21 relies on a register called &quot;A&quot;, while the more recent GreenArrays processors relies on two registers: A and B.

The Intel x86 family of microprocessors have a register-style (accumulator) instruction set for most operations, but use stack instructions for its x87, Intel 8087 floating point arithmetic, dating back to the iAPX87 (8087) coprocessor for the 8086 and 8088. That is, there are no programmer-accessible floating point registers, but only an 80-bit wide, 8-level deep stack. The x87 relies heavily on the x86 CPU for assistance in performing its operations.

===Computers using call stacks and stack frames===
Most current computers (of any instruction set style) and most compilers use a large call-return stack in memory to organize the short-lived local variables and return links for all currently active procedures or functions. Each nested call creates a new stack frame in memory, which persists until that call completes. This call-return stack may be entirely managed by the hardware via specialized address registers and special address modes in the instructions. Or it may be merely a set of conventions followed by the compilers, using generic registers and register+offset address modes. Or it may be something in between.

Since this technique is now nearly universal, even on register machines, it is not helpful to refer to all these machines as stack machines. That term is commonly reserved for machines which also use an expression stack and stack-only arithmetic instructions to evaluate the pieces of a single statement.

Computers commonly provide direct, efficient access to the program&#x27;s global variables and to the local variables of only the current innermost procedure or function, the topmost stack frame. &#x27;Up level&#x27; addressing of the contents of callers&#x27; stack frames is usually not needed and not supported as directly by the hardware. If needed, compilers support this by passing in frame pointers as additional, hidden parameters.

Some Burroughs stack machines do support up-level refs directly in the hardware, with specialized address modes and a special &#x27;display&#x27; register file holding the frame addresses of all outer scopes. Currently, only MCST Elbrus has done this in hardware. When Niklaus Wirth developed the first Pascal compiler for the CDC 6000, he found that it was faster overall to pass in the frame pointers as a chain, rather than constantly updating complete arrays of frame pointers. This software method also adds no overhead for common languages like C which lack up-level refs.

The same Burroughs machines also supported nesting of tasks or threads. The task and its creator share the stack frames that existed at the time of task creation, but not the creator&#x27;s subsequent frames nor the task&#x27;s own frames. This was supported by a cactus stack, whose layout diagram resembled the trunk and arms of a Saguaro cactus. Each task had its own memory segment holding its stack and the frames that it owns. The base of this stack is linked to the middle of its creator&#x27;s stack. In machines with a conventional flat address space, the creator stack and task stacks would be separate heap objects in one heap.

In some programming languages, the outer-scope data environments are not always nested in time. These languages organize their procedure &#x27;activation records&#x27; as separate heap objects rather than as stack frames appended to a linear stack.

In simple languages like Forth that lack local variables and naming of parameters, stack frames would contain nothing more than return branch addresses and frame management overhead. So their return stack holds bare return addresses rather than frames. The return stack is separate from the data value stack, to improve the flow of call setup and returns.

==Comparison with register machines==

Stack machines are often compared to register machines, which hold values in an array of registers. Register machines may store stack-like structures in this array, but a register machine has instructions which circumvent the stack interface. Register machines routinely outperform stack machines, and stack machines have remained a niche player in hardware systems. But stack machines are often used in implementing virtual machines because of their simplicity and ease of implementation.

=== Instructions ===
Stack machines have higher code density. In contrast to common stack machine instructions which can easily fit in 6 bits or less, register machines require two or three register-number fields per ALU instruction to select operands; the densest register machines average about 16 bits per instruction plus the operands. Register machines also use a wider offset field for load-store opcodes. A stack machine&#x27;s compact code naturally fits more instructions in cache, and therefore could achieve better cache efficiency, reducing memory costs or permitting faster memory systems for a given cost. In addition, most stack-machine instructions are very simple, made from only one opcode field or one operand field. Thus, stack-machines require very little electronic resources to decode each instruction.

A program has to execute more instructions when compiled to a stack machine than when compiled to a register machine or memory-to-memory machine. Every variable load or constant requires its own separate Load instruction, instead of being bundled within the instruction which uses that value. The separated instructions may be simple and faster running, but the total instruction count is still higher.

Most register interpreters specify their registers by number. But a host machine&#x27;s registers can&#x27;t be accessed in an indexed array, so a memory array is allotted for virtual registers. Therefore, the instructions of a register interpreter must use memory for passing generated data to the next instruction. This forces register interpreters to be much slower on microprocessors made with a fine process rule (i.e. faster transistors without improving circuit speeds, such as the Haswell x86). These require several clocks for memory access, but only one clock for register access. In the case of a stack machine with a data forwarding circuit instead of a register file, stack interpreters can allot the host machine&#x27;s registers for the top several operands of the stack instead of the host machine&#x27;s memory

In a stack machine, the operands used in the instructions are always at a known offset (set in the stack pointer), from a fixed location (the bottom of the stack, which in a hardware design might always be at memory location zero), saving precious in-cache or in-CPU storage from being used to store quite so many memory addresses or index numbers. This may preserve such registers and cache for use in non-flow computation.

=== Temporary / local values ===
Some in the industry believe that stack machines execute more data cache cycles for temporary values and local variables than do register machines.

On stack machines, temporary values often get spilled into memory, whereas on machines with many registers these temps usually remain in registers. (However, these values often need to be spilled into &quot;activation frames&quot; at the end of a procedure&#x27;s definition, basic block, or at the very least, into a memory buffer during interrupt processing). Values spilled to memory add more cache cycles. This spilling effect depends on the number of hidden registers used to buffer top-of-stack values, upon the frequency of nested procedure calls, and upon host computer interrupt processing rates.

On register machines using optimizing compilers, it is very common for the most-used local variables to remain in registers rather than in stack frame memory cells. This eliminates most data cache cycles for reading and writing those values. The development of &quot;stack scheduling&quot; for performing live-variable analysis, and thus retaining key variables on the stack for extended periods, helps this concern.

On the other hand, register machines must spill many of their registers to memory across nested procedure calls. The decision of which registers to spill, and when, is made statically at compile time rather than on the dynamic depth of the calls. This can lead to more data cache traffic than in an advanced stack machine implementation.

===Common subexpressions===
In register machines, a common subexpression (a subexpression which is used multiple times with the same result value) can be evaluated just once and its result saved in a fast register. The subsequent reuses have no time or code cost, just a register reference. This optimization speeds simple expressions (for example, loading variable X or pointer P) as well as less-common complex expressions.

With stack machines, in contrast, results can be stored in one of two ways. Firstly, results can be stored using a temporary variable in memory. Storing and subsequent retrievals cost additional instructions and additional data cache cycles. Doing this is only a win if the subexpression computation costs more in time than fetching from memory, which in most stack CPUs, almost always is the case. It is never worthwhile for simple variables and pointer fetches, because those already have the same cost of one data cache cycle per access. It is only marginally worthwhile for expressions such as . These simpler expressions make up the majority of redundant, optimizable expressions in programs written in languages other than concatenative languages. An optimizing compiler can only win on redundancies that the programmer could have avoided in the source code.

The second way leaves a computed value on the data stack, duplicating it as needed. This uses operations to copy stack entries. The stack must be depth shallow enough for the CPU&#x27;s available copy instructions. Hand-written stack code often uses this approach, and achieves speeds like general-purpose register machines. Unfortunately, algorithms for optimal &quot;stack scheduling&quot; are not in wide use by programming languages.

===Pipelining===
In modern machines, the time to fetch a variable from the data cache is often several times longer than the time needed for basic ALU operations. A program runs faster without stalls if its memory loads can be started several cycles before the instruction that needs that variable. Complex machines can do this with a deep pipeline and &quot;out-of-order execution&quot; that examines and runs many instructions at once. Register machines can even do this with much simpler &quot;in-order&quot; hardware, a shallow pipeline, and slightly smarter compilers. The load step becomes a separate instruction, and that instruction is statically scheduled much earlier in the code sequence. The compiler puts independent steps in between.

Scheduling memory accesses requires explicit, spare registers. It is not possible on stack machines without exposing some aspect of the micro-architecture to the programmer. For the expression A B -, B must be evaluated and pushed immediately prior to the Minus step. Without stack permutation or hardware multithreading, relatively little useful code can be put in between while waiting for the Load B to finish. Stack machines can work around the memory delay by either having a deep out-of-order execution pipeline covering many instructions at once, or more likely, they can permute the stack such that they can work on other workloads while the load completes, or they can interlace the execution of different program threads, as in the Unisys A9 system. Today&#x27;s increasingly parallel computational loads suggests, however, this might not be the disadvantage it&#x27;s been made out to be in the past.

Stack machines can omit the operand fetching stage of a register machine. For example, in the Java Optimized Processor (JOP) microprocessor the top 2 operands of stack directly enter a data forwarding circuit that is faster than the register file.

===Out-of-order execution===
The Tomasulo algorithm finds instruction-level parallelism by issuing instructions as their data becomes available. Conceptually, the addresses of positions in a stack are no different than the register indexes of a register file. This view permits the out-of-order execution of the Tomasulo algorithm to be used with stack machines.

Out-of-order execution in stack machines seems to reduce or avoid many theoretical and practical difficulties. The cited research shows that such a stack machine can exploit instruction-level parallelism, and the resulting hardware must cache data for the instructions. Such machines effectively bypass most memory accesses to the stack. The result achieves throughput (instructions per clock) comparable to load–store architecture machines, with much higher code densities (because operand addresses are implicit).

One issue brought up in the research was that it takes about 1.88 stack-machine instructions to do the work of one instruction on a load-store architecture machine. Competitive out-of-order stack machines therefore require about twice as many electronic resources to track instructions (&quot;issue stations&quot;). This might be compensated by savings in instruction cache and memory and instruction decoding circuits.

===Hides a faster register machine inside===
Some simple stack machines have a chip design which is fully customized all the way down to the level of individual registers. The top of stack address register and the N top of stack data buffers are built from separate individual register circuits, with separate adders and ad hoc connections.

However, most stack machines are built from larger circuit components where the N data buffers are stored together within a register file and share read/write buses. The decoded stack instructions are mapped into one or more sequential actions on that hidden register file. Loads and ALU ops act on a few topmost registers, and implicit spills and fills act on the bottommost registers. The decoder allows the instruction stream to be compact. But if the code stream instead had explicit register-select fields which directly manipulated the underlying register file, the compiler could make better use of all registers and the program would run faster.

Microprogrammed stack machines are an example of this. The inner microcode engine is some kind of RISC-like register machine or a VLIW-like machine using multiple register files. When controlled directly by task-specific microcode, that engine gets much more work completed per cycle than when controlled indirectly by equivalent stack code for that same task.

The object code translators for the HP 3000 and Tandem T/16 are another example. They translated stack code sequences into equivalent sequences of RISC code. Minor &#x27;local&#x27; optimizations removed much of the overhead of a stack architecture. Spare registers were used to factor out repeated address calculations. The translated code still retained plenty of emulation overhead from the mismatch between original and target machines. Despite that burden, the cycle efficiency of the translated code matched the cycle efficiency of the original stack code. And when the source code was recompiled directly to the register machine via optimizing compilers, the efficiency doubled. This shows that the stack architecture and its non-optimizing compilers were wasting over half of the power of the underlying hardware.

Register files are good tools for computing because they have high bandwidth and very low latency, compared to memory references via data caches. In a simple machine, the register file allows reading two independent registers and writing of a third, all in one ALU cycle with one-cycle or less latency. Whereas the corresponding data cache can start only one read or one write (not both) per cycle, and the read typically has a latency of two ALU cycles. That&#x27;s one third of the throughput at twice the pipeline delay. In a complex machine like Athlon that completes two or more instructions per cycle, the register file allows reading of four or more independent registers and writing of two others, all in one ALU cycle with one-cycle latency. Whereas the corresponding dual-ported data cache can start only two reads or writes per cycle, with multiple cycles of latency. Again, that&#x27;s one third of the throughput of registers. It is very expensive to build a cache with additional ports.

Since a stack is a component of most software programs, even when the software used is not strictly a stack machine, a hardware stack machine might more closely mimic the inner workings of its programs. Processor registers have a high thermal cost, and a stack machine might claim higher energy efficiency.

=== Interrupts ===
Responding to an interrupt involves saving the registers to a stack, and then branching to the interrupt handler code. Often stack machines respond more quickly to interrupts, because most parameters are already on a stack and there is no need to push them there. Some register machines deal with this by having multiple register files that can be instantly swapped but this increases costs and slows down the register file.

=== Interpreters ===
Interpreters for virtual stack machines are easier to build than interpreters for register machines; the logic for handling memory address modes is in just one place rather than repeated in many instructions. Stack machines also tend to have fewer variations of an opcode; one generalized opcode will handle both frequent cases and obscure corner cases of memory references or function call setup. (But code density is often improved by adding short and long forms for the same operation.)

Interpreters for virtual stack machines are often slower than interpreters for other styles of virtual machine. This slowdown is worst when running on host machines with deep execution pipelines, such as current x86 chips.

In some interpreters, the interpreter must execute a N-way switch jump to decode the next opcode and branch to its steps for that particular opcode. Another method for selecting opcodes is threaded code. The host machine&#x27;s prefetch mechanisms are unable to predict and fetch the target of that indexed or indirect jump. So the host machine&#x27;s execution pipeline must restart each time the hosted interpreter decodes another virtual instruction. This happens more often for virtual stack machines than for other styles of virtual machine.

One example is the Java programming language. 
Its canonical virtual machine is specified as an 8-bit stack machine. However, the Dalvik virtual machine for Java used on Android smartphones is a 16-bit virtual-register machine - a choice made for efficiency reasons. Arithmetic instructions directly fetch or store local variables via 4-bit (or larger) instruction fields. Similarly version 5.0 of Lua replaced its virtual stack machine with a faster virtual register machine.

Since Java virtual machine became popular, microprocessors have employed advanced branch predictors for indirect jumps. This advance avoids most of pipeline restarts from N-way jumps and eliminates much of the instruction count costs that affect stack interpreters.

<doc id="510079" wikidata="Q732838" url="?curid=510079" title="Mount Elgon">
<text>Mount Elgon is an extinct shield volcano on the border of Uganda and Kenya, north of Kisumu and west of Kitale. The mountain&#x27;s highest point, named &quot;Wagagai&quot;, is located entirely within Uganda. Although there is no verifiable evidence of its earliest volcanic activity, geologists estimate that Mount Elgon is at least 24 million years old, making it the oldest known extinct volcano in East Africa. The mountain&#x27;s name originates from its Maasai name, “Ol Doinyo Ilgoon” (Breast Mountain).

==Physical features==
Mount Elgon is a massive solitary volcanic mountain on the border of eastern Uganda and western Kenya. Its vast form, in diameter, rises above the surrounding plains. Its cooler heights offer respite for humans from the hot plains below, and its higher altitudes provide a refuge for flora and fauna.

Mt. Elgon consists of five major peaks:
* Wagagai (), in Uganda
* Sudek () on the Kenya/Uganda border
* Koitobos (), a flat-topped basalt column in Kenya
* Mubiyi () in Uganda
* Masaba () in Uganda

Other features of note are:
* The caldera — Elgon&#x27;s is one of the largest intact calderas in the world.
* Subsidiary craters to the Southwest: All about 25 km across, Bududu, and manafwa rings intersect the caldera and Bububo with a central plug sits at its edge. The smaller Tororo marks the plain almost 50 km from Elgon’s peak.

* The warm springs by the Suam River
* Endebess Bluff ()
* Ngwarisha, Makingeny, Chepnyalil, and Kitum caves: Kitum Cave is over wide and penetrates . The cave contains salt deposits and it is frequented by wild elephants that lick the salt exposed by gouging the walls with their tusks. Richard Preston&#x27;s book &quot;The Hot Zone&quot; (1994) described the cave&#x27;s association with the Marburg virus after two people who had visited it (one in 1980 and another in 1987) contracted the disease and died.

The mountain soil is red laterite. The mountain is the catchment area for several rivers such as the Suam River, which becomes the Turkwel downstream and drains into Lake Turkana, and the Nzoia River and the Lwakhakha River, which flow to Lake Victoria. The town of Kitale is in the foothills of the mountain. The area around the mountain is protected by two Mount Elgon National Parks, one on each side of the international border.

== Fauna ==
A population of African bush elephants is present around the mountain that ventures deep into caves to access salt licks. This population was formerly present around the entire mountain, but has since been reduced to the Kenyan side, where they venture into Kitum Cave.

There are several disjunct populations of mammal species that are restricted to Mount Elgon, including the Elgon shrew (&quot;Crocidura elgonius&quot;), Rudd&#x27;s mole-rat (&quot;Tachyoryctes ruddi&quot;), and Thomas&#x27;s pygmy mouse (&quot;Mus sorella&quot;). There are also several disjunct populations of rare bird species, including Sharpe&#x27;s longclaw (&quot;Macronyx sharpei&quot;), Hunter&#x27;s cisticola (&quot;Cisticola hunteri&quot;), Jackson&#x27;s spurfowl (&quot;Pternistis jacksoni&quot;), and the Elgon francolin (&quot;Scleroptila elgonensis&quot;).

An endemic subspecies of the bushbuck (&quot;Tragelaphus scriptus heterochrous&quot;) is restricted to the mountain. The possibly extinct Du Toit&#x27;s torrent frog (&quot;Arthroleptides dutoiti&quot;), considered an EDGE species due to its evolutionary distinctiveness, is known only from a single specimen collected on the Kenyan side of the mountain.

==Flora==

Some rare plants are found on the mountain, including &quot;Ardisiandra wettsteinii&quot;, &quot;Carduus afromontanus&quot;, &quot;Echinops hoehnelii&quot;, &quot;Ranunculus keniensis&quot;, and &quot;Romulea keniensis&quot;.

==Local ethnicities==

Mount Elgon and its tributaries are home to five tribes: the Bagisu, the Mbay, Sor, Sapiiny, Koony, Someek, Pook, and the Ogiek, better known in the region under the derogatory umbrella term Ndorobo.

<text>Medina was a non-metropolitan district with the status of a borough on the Isle of Wight in England from 1974 to 1995.

The district was formed by the Local Government Act 1972, and was a merger of the municipal boroughs of Newport and Ryde along with the urban district of Cowes. It was one of two districts on the Island formed in 1974 - the other was South Wight.

&quot;Medina&quot; was an older name for Newport which has been preserved in the River Medina.

Following a review by the Local Government Commission for England, the borough was abolished on 1 April 1995, when a single Isle of Wight Council replaced the Isle of Wight County Council and the island&#x27;s two district councils.

<text>Prenatal and perinatal psychology explores the psychological and psychophysiological effects and implications of the earliest experiences of the individual, before birth, prenatal, as well as during and immediately after childbirth, perinatal. Prenatal and perinatal psychology can be seen as a part of developmental psychology, although historically it was developed in the heterogenous field of psychoanalysis. Prenatal and perinatal psychology are often discussed together to group the period during pregnancy, childbirth, and through the early stages of infancy. The role of prenatal and perinatal psychology is to explain the experience and behavior of the individual before birth, postnatal consequences, and the lasting effects on development that occur during this time period.

Although there are various perspectives on the topic, a common thread is the importance of prenatal and perinatal experiences in the shaping the future psychological development. There is a debate among scientists regarding the extent to which newborn infants are capable of forming memories, the effects of any such memories on their personality, and the possibility of recovering them from an unconscious mind, which itself is the subject of argument in the field. A widespread assumption concerning the prenatal phase was that the fetus is almost completely shielded from outside stimuli. Thus, perception and consciousness would develop after birth. Meanwhile, there is a great number of scientific studies which show clearly that behaviour, perception and learning is already developed before birth. This also holds for nonhuman species, as for rat fetuses acoustic conditioning can be demonstrated.

== Psycho-physiological aspects of the prenatal and perinatal phases ==

The physiological development while in the prenatal phase – especially that of the brain – is of particular importance for prenatal psychology. In the first eight weeks after insemination, the developing child is called an embryo. After the inner organs have developed (from the ninth week on) it is called a fetus. There are three stages of fetal development. The first stage is the germinal stage begins at conception and is the shortest stage. The second stage is the embryonic stage which begins around the third week of pregnancy and ends at the eighth week. The final stage is the fetal stage which begins at the ninth week of pregnancy and lasts until birth. Another way to measure pregnancy is by trimesters. The first trimester is from conception to 12 weeks of pregnancy, the second trimester is from 13 to 28 weeks of pregnancy, and the third trimester is from 29 weeks until birth. During the prenatal phase, the fetus is developing the structures to carry out cognitive functions, such as brain cells, brain waves, and forming the lobes and other structures of the brain. 

=== Prenatal development ===
The basis of perception, experience, and behaviour is the brain. This is dependent on the presence of the structures in the brain that must be formed during gestation. While in gestation, a giant neuronal net is developing, delivering the condition for any mental process. About half of the developing neurons become destroyed again during the development of the brain because of the &quot;programmed cell death&quot; (apoptosis). At birth the infantile brain contains 100 billion neurons – as many as in the brain of an adult. In order to have this many neurons at birth, the fetus&#x27;s brain must produce neurons at the rate of 250,000 per minute. At birth, every cortical neuron is connected with about 2500 neurons; after a year, with about 15 000. Synapses develop, and are destroyed, over the whole life span – a process called neuroplasticity.

In the first trimester, the 3 to 4 weeks following conception, the neural groove closes into the neural tube that the human brain develops from to create the hindbrain, midbrain, and the forebrain. These three structures are vital for human development. The hindbrain regulates unconscious automatic functions, the midbrain is a relay center for sensory and motor nerve impulses, and the forebrain is essential for processing incoming information. The spinal cord will also develop from this neural tube in the first trimester. If this neural tube does not close completely, the fetus may have a birth disorder called spina bifida. In the case of spina bifida myelomeningocele, the fetus may experience changes to their brain structure among other developmental problems. The second trimester is also essential for perinatal brain development. By week 20 of pregnancy, the area of the brain that is responsible for the awareness of the fetus&#x27;s five sense begins to develop. In the fifth month of pregnancy, the fetal senses can be stimulated which results in the growth of synapses. The fetus, while not able to make sense of and process what they are hearing, has the ability to hear, feel pressure and different temperatures. The third trimester has many perinatal brain development milestones. In the 30th week, the fetus can control its own body heat. In the 31st week, the fetus is able to process more stimuli and information. While the other structures and organs of the fetus are mostly formed by this point, the brain continues to develop and only weighs two-thirds of what it should at birth. 

Maternal care during pregnancy has a lot of impact throughout prenatal development. One factor of improper maternal care is the use of substances throughout pregnancy which has several different effects on the fetus. Those who are pregnant and use substances during pregnancy have an association with also delaying or not seeking prenatal care, and those who delay prenatal care typically do not participate in follow up services. This is most likely to occur in younger pregnancy situations with alcohol abuse. This not only causes the fetus to be vulnerable to negative physiological and psychological effects as a result of no prenatal care, but it also creates insecure attachment of the mother towards the fetus during the prenatal stage which can then translate to insecure attachment in the perinatal stage. 

Perinatal Development

The development that occurs during the perinatal period is extremely impactful and predictive of the ability to emotionally regulate later in life. Secure attachment is essential to healthy development in the early infancy and perinatal stages. Improper attachment during these early stages can result in negative psychiatric manifestations including reactive attachment disorder (RAD), post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), personality disorders, or disinhibited social engagement disorder. John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth developed the attachment theory that describes the differences in avoidant-insecure attachment, disorganized-insecure attachment, secure attachment, and ambivalant-insecure attachment as well as the formation of attachment. The process of forming attachment begins at birth in the pre-attachment stage which lasts from birth to six weeks. In this stage, there is indiscriminate attachment where the infant will seek comfort in any caregiver. The next stage is attachment in the making occurring from the first six weeks to six months of the infants life. This stage is when the infant is more aware of a distinct caregiver and will seek comfort and trust in them. Following this stage is the clear-cut attachment stage which begins at six months old in the infant and lasts until they are about two years old. This is the stage in which the attachment style is most clear and will reflect the formation of reciprocal relationships stage from two years old and onwards. 

There are several factors that could influence parental and child attachment types such as the status of the parental relationship. Parents and guardians who are in stable relationships have greater capability to respond to infants needs and provide more secure attachments in turn. Another factor of insecure attachment in the perinatal stage is the environment. Regardless of the parent or guardians ability to provide emotional support, if an infant is in an unsafe environment this often leads to attachment issues as a result of feeling unsafe, in pain, or feelings of distress. Maternal depression has the ability to result in attachment issues between mother and infant as depression causes the parent to be unable to respond to the infants cues. Parents and guardians who are depressed are less likely to make eye contact with their infant, show variety in facial expressions, or convey emotional activity. Lack of exposure to emotional variety especially conveying positive emotions towards an infant results in emotional disregulation and disorganized or anxious insecure attachment. 

=== Motor development ===
In the 1930s the physiologist Davenport Hooker examined reflexes or reactions, respectively of aborted fetuses extrauterine. Currently, the motor skills of embryo and fetus can be examined with ultrasound techniques quite easily. From the eighth week on the embryo moves the rump, shortly after that his extremities. With the means of sonography one could demonstrate that these were not simple reflexes, but also endogenously provoked movements. According to Alessandra Piontelli the fetus shows all patterns of movement, which later can be found in the newborn.

The first movements in the fetus occur around the seven to eighth week of pregnancy. During this time, slight bending of the head and lower extremities can be picked up on. As the pregnancy progresses, so does movement of the fetus. General movements occur around the ninth and tenth week followed by more concise and complex movements. At the twelve to thirteen week milestone, the fetus can bring their hands towards their face. The thirteen to fourteen week mark shows evidence of the ability to swallow. The fifteenth week the fetus has the ability to suck their fingers. Eye movements are shown to exist from the 18th week on, from the 23rd week on there are rapid-eye-movements (REM-phases). These are connected with sleeping patterns and dreaming. Breath movements can be seen from the 19th week on, with the fetus taking amniotic fluid into his lungs. Fetuses drink amniotic fluid and urinate into it.

Fetal activity and motor development can be altered by a variety of maternal factors. There is higher fetal activity when the mother is laying down and a decrease in activity when the mother is active or during exercise. Use of substances while pregnant can also affect activity and development of the fetus. Use of opiates or alcohol while pregnant results in a decrease in amount and duration of movements of the fetus while nicotine can result in a decrease in movement of the fetus, especially breathing movements. 

=== Development of perception and prenatal learning ===

The sense modalities of the fetus develop prenatally and are functioning very well at birth. The examination of such abilities is connected with experimental examination of behaviour, provoked by stimuli. Ray examined vibro-acoustic conditioning of human fetuses. According to Hepper it rested uncertain, if such conditioning was successful. Hepper claims to have repeat such conditioning experiments successfully, with the earliest vibro-acoustic conditioning in the 32nd week of gestation.

Prenatal learning often is examined by using the habituation paradigm. The fetus gets exposed to a stimulus, e.g. an acoustic one. Afterwards the experimenter watches the extinction of the reaction while repeating the same stimulus again and again. This procedure becomes completed by the use of a new stimulus and the recording of the according reaction. When the new stimulus is identified by the fetus as different from the old one, it releases a new pattern of reaction, e.g. accelerated frequency of the heart. If this does not happen, the new stimulus cannot be distinguished from the old focal stimulus. In 1991 a study demonstrated the acoustic habituation by recording the heart frequency of foetuses in the 29th week of gestation. Such studies can be used for examining memory. Fetuses older than 34 weeks of gestation can reproduce learned content over a period of 4 weeks. The earliest vibro-acoustic conditioning is successful at 22-week-old fetuses. Maybe habituation to taste is possible even earlier. Such habituation was also demonstrated in fetal rats.

Babies remember musical patterns they once heard in the womb, as W. Ernest Freud – a grandson of Sigmund Freud – could demonstrate. The empirical proof used the registration of heart frequency and motorical activity.

Also the development of speech is based on prenatal learning, as the study of DeCasper and Fifer from 1980 seems to demonstrate. This study used operant conditioning as a paradigm. 
Several empirical studies demonstrated that prenatal learning exists.

== Historical development of psychoanalytical and depth psychological theories concerning prenatal life==
Most psychoanalytical theories assume that the development of objects, the self and even consciousness begins after birth. Nevertheless, some psychoanalysts explicitly write that pre- and perinatal aspects are responsible for certain symptom formations, among them Otto Rank, Nandor Fodor, Francis J. Mott, Donald Winnicott, Gustav Hans Graber and Ludwig Janus. They think that the structuring of the unconscious psyche starts in the prenatal phase. The fetus already has early, emotionally relevant experiences. They assume the existence of perception in several sense modaliaties, states of asphyxia, fears and stress, which are stored and can be remembered after birth under certain circumstances. In psychoanalysis pre- and perinatal topics usually are seen as fantasies. The manifest prenatal content of dreaming or fantasizing of swimming under water while breathing, being inside of a cave, fighting with underwater monsters – are interpreted as re-projections in time onto the early phase. Janus assumes that in many psychoanalytical approaches there can be found contentual and phenomenological aspects close to prenatal psychology – but without explicit references. Janus wrote of the &quot;hidden attendance of the prenatal existence&quot; in the works of psychoanalysts such as Sandor Ferenczi, Carl Gustav Jung, Melanie Klein, Bela Grunberger, Françoise Dolto and others.

In 1924 Otto Rank (1884–1939), one of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s disciples, published his book &quot;The Trauma of Birth&quot; (German: &quot;Das Trauma der Geburt und seine Bedeutung für die Psychoanalyse&quot;). There he stated that the emotional shock of being born is an individual&#x27;s first source of anxiety. Because of this book the friendship between Freud and Rank came to an end. Rank was of the opinion that birth is connected with an overwhelming experience of fear of the fetus. He also presumed that this trauma was the cause of later anxieties. He also claimed that aspects of the later prenatal phase can be remembered. So already Rank himself had developed the outlines of a true prenatal psychology. In the light of such assumptions he interpreted cultural aspects, e.g. he understood Christian fantasies of the hell as being based on aversive intrauterine situations. In his book, he treated the interpretation of symbols, art and myths by using pre- and perinatal assumptions. Rank believed that a &quot;primal fixation&quot; with the prenatal state is the root of all neuroses and character disorders and developed a process of psychoanalysis based on birth experiences.
Donald Winnicott (1896–1971) tried to understand very early forms of symbol formation. He described in several case studies the reenactment of perinatal experiences in psychotherapies, especially of children. A five-year-old boy climbed into Winnicott&#x27;s jacket and then slit down the pants onto the ground. He repeated this again and again. Winnicott interpreted this game as a regression and a repeating of birth. He presumed that some babies developed a paranoid attitude by having problems at birth, e.g. in the case of asphyxia. Also psychosomatic symptoms (headaches, breast- and breathing problems and feelings of getting choked) were interpreted as possible consequences of birth experiences by Winnicott. Nevertheless, he rejected the assumption of a universal birth trauma.

In his book &quot;The Search for the Beloved: A Clinical Investigation of the Trauma of Birth and Prenatal Condition&quot; of 1949 the British-American psychoanalyst Nandor Fodor (1895–1964) traced certain forms of anxiety back to unprocessed and repressed birth experiences following Rank&#x27;s assumptions, who had been his psychoanalyst. Fodor interpreted dreams, experiencing the lack of oxygen, claustrophobia and sexual disorders and their etiology, which he explained by assuming specific pre- and perinatal experiences.

Francis John Mott (1901–1980) was a disciple of Fodor and the first author who concentrated on the placenta as the first object of the fetus. He wrote, that the fetus fears his placenta as a &quot;blood sucker&quot; or experience it as a &quot;feeder&quot; or &quot;life-giver&quot;. His work an prenatal aspects is connected with his speculative assumptions on a quasi-religious design of the universe.

Material emerging from sessions of psychedelic psychotherapy using LSD and other hallucinogenic drugs was the foundation for research into the enduring effects of pre- and perinatal experiences in adult life conducted by Frank Lake, Athanasios Kafkalides (1919–1989) and Stanislav Grof. Grof went on to formulate an extensive theoretical framework for the analysis of pre- and perinatal experiences, based on the four constructs he called Basic Perinatal Matrices. Lake and Grof independently developed breathing techniques, following Wilhelm Reich (1897–1957) as an alternative to the use of psychedelic drugs, which was subject to considerable legal difficulty from the mid-1960s onwards. A related technique called Rebirthing was developed by psychotherapist Leonard Orr in the 1970s, and Core Process psychotherapy trainees relive presumed birth trauma as part of their training.
The US-American social scientist Lloyd deMause (born 1931) compiled in his essay from 1981 the psychoanalytic approaches to prenatal mental life as well as the physiological findings of the human ontogenesis concerning fetal development. He took several assumptions from the works of Grof and Mott, but left away their metaphysical implications completely. In his own approach he assumes, that the placenta becomes the first object of the fetus, namely in two split versions: a positive and a negative one, he called the &quot;nurturing&quot; and the &quot;poisonous placenta&quot;. DeMause presumed that in every gestation – especially at the end of this period – there are problems of supply with oxygen for the fetus. Because of physiological conditions the placenta would not be able anymore to supply the growing fetus with enough oxygen. This would give rise to states of pain and deprivation. Pre- and perinatal experiences lead to a mental script, a kind of pattern, to which later experiences would be connected with and internalized. He calls the experience of successive good and painful states the &quot;fetal drama&quot;, long precursing the well known &quot;oedipal drama&quot; sensu Freud. Besides these theories about prenatal psychology deMause also developed approaches in the field of psychohistory – a system of cultural psychological assumptions, which explain historical processes and phenomenons by using psychological theories. Especially aspects of childhood history and prenatal psychology play an important role.

In 1992 the Italian child neuropsychiatrist Alessandra Piontelli (born 1945) published a study in her book &quot;From Fetus to Child: An Observational and Psychoanalytic Study&quot; (1992). Using sonography she examined the behaviour of 11 fetuses. The fetuses showed a very complex behavioural repertoire and were quite different concerning their forms of activities. They reacted to stimuli in complex ways. Piontelli&#x27;s study suggested that certain prenatal experiences determined later mental life. Psychological traits, e.g. enhanced oral activity, were recognizable in the prenatal phase, and also after birth. Piontelli interpreted her observations in psychoanalytical terms. Piontelli saw a remarkable continuity between pre- and postnatal mental development. Her study is important, because it combines the assessment of empirical data with the observation of single case studies in the postnatal phase and also in infancy. Her study use equally the methods of academic psychology together with the hermeneutics of psychoanalysis, what makes it unique in the scientific landscape.

<text>The genus Tamarix (tamarisk, salt cedar, taray) is composed of about 50–60 species of flowering plants in the family Tamaricaceae, native to drier areas of Eurasia and Africa. The generic name originated in Latin and may refer to the Tamaris River in Hispania Tarraconensis (Spain).

==Description==
They are evergreen or deciduous shrubs or trees growing to in height and forming dense thickets. The largest, &quot;Tamarix aphylla&quot;, is an evergreen tree that can grow to tall. They usually grow on saline soils, tolerating up to 15,000 ppm soluble salt, and can also tolerate alkaline conditions.

Tamarisks are characterized by slender branches and grey-green foliage. The bark of young branches is smooth and reddish brown. As the plants age, the bark becomes gray-brown, ridged and furrowed.

The leaves are scale-like, almost like that of junipers, 1–2 mm (1/20&quot; to 1/10&quot;) long, and overlap each other along the stem. They are often encrusted with salt secretions.

The pink to white flowers appear in dense masses on 5–10 cm (2&quot; to 4&quot;) long spikes at branch tips from March to September, though some species (e.g., &quot;T. aphylla&quot;) tend to flower in the summer until as late as November.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Tamarix aphylla&quot; can spread both vegetatively, by submerged stems producing adventitious roots, and sexually, by seeds. Each flower can produce thousands of tiny (1 mm; 1/20&quot; diameter) seeds that are contained in a small capsule usually adorned with a tuft of hair that aids in wind dispersal. Seeds can also be dispersed by water. Seedlings require extended periods of soil saturation for establishment. Tamarisk trees are most often propagated by cuttings.

These trees grow in disturbed and undisturbed streams, waterways, bottom lands, banks, and drainage washes of natural or artificial water bodies, moist rangelands and pastures.

Whether &quot;Tamarix&quot; species are fire-adapted or not is unclear, but in many cases a large proportion of the trees are able to resprout from the stump after fires, although not notably more so than other riverine species. They likely cannot resprout from root suckers. In some habitats where they are native, wildfire appears to favour the establishment of riverine trees such as &quot;Populus&quot;, to the detriment of &quot;Tamarix&quot;. Conversely, they do appear to be more flammable, with more dead wood produced and debris held aloft. In the southwestern USA, most stands studied appear to be burning at faster intervals than they can fully mature and die of natural causes.

&quot;Tamarix&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Coleophora asthenella&quot; which feeds exclusively on &quot;T. africana&quot;.

=== As an invasive species ===
In some specific riparian habitats in the Southwestern United States and California, &quot;Tamarix ramosissima&quot; has naturalized and become a significant invasive plant species. In other areas, the plants form dense monocultures that alter the natural environment and compete with native species already stressed by human activity. Recent scientific investigations have generally concluded that the primary human-caused impact to desert riparian ecosystems within the Colorado River Basin is the alteration of the flood regime by dams; &quot;Tamarix ramosissima&quot; is relatively tolerant of this hydrologic alteration compared to flood-dependent native woody riparian species such as willow, cottonwood, and box elder.

==== Competition with native plants ====
Research on competition between tamarisk seedlings and co-occurring native trees has found that &quot;Tamarix&quot; seedlings are not competitive over a range of environments, but stands of mature trees effectively prevent native species&#x27; establishment in the understory, due to low light, elevated salinity, and possibly changes to the soil biota. Box elder (&quot;Acer negundo&quot;, a native riparian tree) seedlings survive and grow under higher-shade conditions than &quot;Tamarix&quot; seedlings, and mature &quot;Tamarix&quot; specimens die after 1–2 years of 98% shade, indicating a pathway for successional replacement of &quot;Tamarix&quot; by box elder. Anthropogenic activities that preferentially favor tamarisk (such as changes to flooding regimens) are associated with infestation. To date, &quot;Tamarix&quot; has taken over large sections of riparian ecosystems in the western United States that were once home to native cottonwoods and willows, and are projected by some to spread well beyond the current range.

In a 2013 study which examined if native plant growth was hindered by the microbiota associated with the presence of &quot;Tamarix&quot;, a relatively new invasive plant to the northern United States, &quot;Elymus lanceolatus&quot; and other native plants in fact grew better when a small soil sample from areas where &quot;Tamarix&quot; trees grew was mixed in with the potting soil, as opposed to samples without these plants. This was thought to indicate the presence of beneficial mycorrhizae. The presence of &quot;Tamarix&quot; plants has also been shown to boost soil fertility in a number of studies, and it also increases soil salinity. Two studies found that &quot;Tamarix&quot; plants are able to limit the recruitment of &quot;Salix&quot; and &quot;Populus&quot; tree species, in the latter case possibly due to interfering with the trees ability to form symbiotic relationships with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, in contrast to the grass and legume species studied in 2013.

Because it is much more efficient at both obtaining water from drying soil and conserving water during drought, it can outcompete many native species, especially after the habitat is altered by controlling flood regimes and disturbance of water sources. Because the trees are able to concentrate salts on the outside of their leaves, dense stands of the tree will form a layer of high salinity on the topsoil as the leaves are shed. Although this layer is easily washed off during flooding events, in areas where the rivers are channelled and floods are controlled, this salty layer inhibits the germination of a number of native plants. However, a study involving more than a thousand soil samples across gradients of both flood frequency and &quot;Tamarix&quot; density concluded that &quot;flooding may be the most important factor for assessing floodplain salinity&quot; and &quot;soils under &quot;Tamarix&quot; canopies had lower surface soil salinity than open areas deprived of flooding suggesting that surface evaporation may contribute more to surface soil salinity than &quot;Tamarix&quot;&quot;.

==== Investigation of effects of invasion ====
&quot;Tamarix&quot; species are commonly believed to disrupt the structure and stability of North American native plant communities and degrade native wildlife habitat, by outcompeting and replacing native plant species, salinizing soils, monopolizing limited sources of moisture, and increasing the frequency, intensity, and effect of fires and floods . While individual plants may not consume larger quantities of water than native species, large, dense stands of tamarisk do consume more water than equivalent stands of native cottonwoods. An active and ongoing debate exists as to when the tamarisk can out-compete native plants, and if it is actively displacing native plants or it just taking advantage of disturbance by removal of natives by humans and changes in flood regimens.

==== Controls ====
Pest populations of tamarisk in the United States can be dealt with in several ways. The National Park Service has used the methods of physically removing the plants, spraying them with herbicides, and introducing northern tamarisk beetles (&quot;Diorhabda carinulata&quot;) in the national park system. Various attempts to control tamarisk have been implemented on federal lands including Dinosaur National Monument, San Andres National Wildlife Refuge, and White Sands Missile Range. After years of study, the USDA Agricultural Research Service found that the introduced tamarisk beetles (&quot;Diorhabda elongata&quot;) eat only the tamarisk, and starve when no more is available, not eating any plants native to North America.

==Uses==
*Tamarisk species, notably &quot;T. ramosissima&quot; and &quot;T. tetrandra&quot;. are used as ornamental shrubs, windbreaks, and shade trees:
*In the Southwest of the United states of America, tamarisk was introduced to help erosion control.
*In Greece recipes may call for tamarix (salt cedar) – known locally as almyriki –  for cooking and eating as a wild green vegetable. 
*On the steppes of Asia, the Saka may have used tamarisk wood (combined with horn) to produce tremendously powerful bows hundreds of years before the common era.
*The wood may be used for carpentry or firewood: it is a possible agroforestry species.
*At certain times of year, scale insects feeding upon the tender twigs of tamarisk plants excrete a sweet substance known as honeydew, which has been gathered for use as a food source and sweetener for thousands of years. The substance is also known locally as &quot;manna&quot;, and some scholars have suggested that this substance is the biblical manna that fed the Israelites during their flight from Egypt, though others dispute this interpretation.
*Tamarisks play a role in anti-desertification programs in China.

=== In North America ===
The tamarisk was introduced to the United States as an ornamental shrub, a windbreak, and a shade tree in the early 19th century. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, tree-planting was used as a tool to fight soil erosion on the Great Plains, and different trees were planted by the millions in the Great Plains Shelterbelt, including salt cedars.

Eight species are found in North America. They can be divided into two subgroups:

; Evergreen species
&quot;Tamarix aphylla&quot; (Athel tree), a large evergreen tree, does not sexually reproduce in the local climate and is not considered a seriously invasive species. The Athel tree is commonly used for windbreaks on the edge of agricultural fields and as a shade tree in the deserts of the Southwestern United States.

; Deciduous species
The second subgroup contains the deciduous tamarisks, which are small, shrubby trees, commonly known as &quot;saltcedars&quot;. These include &quot;T. pentandra&quot;, &quot;T. tetrandra&quot;, &quot;T. gallica&quot;, &quot;T. chinensis&quot;, &quot;T. ramosissima&quot; and &quot;T. parviflora&quot;.

==In culture==
* A disputation poem dating to the 18th century BC, Tamarisk and Palm, features a personified tamarisk debating the date-palm over who is better.

* In Genesis 21:33, Abraham is recorded to have &quot;planted a tamarisk at Beer-sheba&quot;. He had built a well there, earlier. In 1 Samuel 22:6, Saul is sitting under a tamarisk tree on a hill at Gibeah when he learns that David has returned to Judah.

* In 1 Samuel 31:13, Saul&#x27;s bones are buried under a tamarisk tree in Jabesh.

* In the Quran 34:16, the people of Saba were punished when &quot;[Allah] converted their two garden (rows) into gardens producing bitter fruit and tamarisks...&quot;.

* Wedgwood made a &quot;Tamarisk&quot; china pattern.

* In the Iliad 10:465 Odysseus buries the spoils from a captured Trojan spy under a tamarisk tree, and marks their spot with reeds and tamarisk shoots. The spoils (a polecat cap, wolfskin cloak, long spear and bow) are dedicated to the goddess Athena.

<text>South Wight was a non-metropolitan district with the status of a borough on the Isle of Wight in England from 1974 to 1995.

The district was formed by the Local Government Act 1972, and was a merger of Sandown-Shanklin and Ventnor urban districts and Isle of Wight Rural District. It was one of two districts on the island formed in 1974 – the other was Medina.

Following a review by the Local Government Commission for England, the borough was abolished on 1 April 1995, when a single Isle of Wight Council replaced the island&#x27;s county council and two district councils.

<text>Base station (or base radio station, BS) is – according to the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s (ITU) Radio Regulations (RR) – a &quot;land station in the land mobile service.&quot;

A base station is called &quot;node B&quot; in 3G, &quot;eNB&quot; in LTE (4G), and &quot;gNB&quot; in 5G.

The term is used in the context of mobile telephony, wireless computer networking and other wireless communications and in land surveying. In surveying, it is a GPS receiver at a known position, while in wireless communications it is a transceiver connecting a number of other devices to one another and/or to a wider area.
In mobile telephony, it provides the connection between mobile phones and the wider telephone network. In a computer network, it is a transceiver acting as a switch for computers in the network, possibly connecting them to a/another local area network and/or the Internet. In traditional wireless communications, it can refer to the hub of a dispatch fleet such as a taxi or delivery fleet, the base of a TETRA network as used by government and emergency services or a CB shack.

== Land surveying ==

In the context of external land surveying, a base station is a GPS receiver at an accurately-known fixed location which is used to derive correction information for nearby portable GPS receivers. This correction data allows propagation and other effects to be corrected out of the position data obtained by the mobile stations, which gives greatly increased location precision and accuracy over the results obtained by uncorrected GPS receivers.

== Computer networking ==
In the area of wireless computer networking, a base station is a radio receiver/transmitter that serves as the hub of the local wireless network, and may also be the gateway between a wired network and the wireless network. It typically consists of a low-power transmitter and wireless router.

== Wireless communications ==

In radio communications, a base station is a wireless communications station installed at a fixed location and used to communicate as part of one of the following:

* a push-to-talk two-way radio system, or;
* a wireless telephone system such as cellular CDMA or GSM cell site.
* Terrestrial Trunked Radio

Base stations use RF power amplifiers (radio-frequency power amplifiers) to transmit and receive signals. The most common RF power amplifiers are metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), particularly LDMOS (power MOSFET) RF amplifiers. RF LDMOS amplifiers replaced RF bipolar transistor amplifiers in most base stations during the 1990s, leading to the wireless revolution.

=== Two-way radio ===

==== Professional ====

In professional two-way radio systems, a base station is used to maintain contact with a dispatch fleet of hand-held or mobile radios, and/or to activate one-way paging receivers. The base station is one end of a communications link. The other end is a movable vehicle-mounted radio or walkie-talkie. Examples of base station uses in two-way radio include the dispatch of tow trucks and taxicabs.

Professional base station radios are often one channel. In lightly used base stations, a multi-channel unit may be employed. In heavily used systems, the capability for additional channels, where needed, is accomplished by installing an additional base station for each channel. Each base station appears as a single channel on the dispatch center control console. In a properly designed dispatch center with several staff members, this allows each dispatcher to communicate simultaneously, independently of one another, on a different channel as necessary. For example, a taxi company dispatch center may have one base station on a high-rise building in Boston and another on a different channel in Providence. Each taxi dispatcher could communicate with taxis in either Boston or Providence by selecting the respective base station on his or her console.

In dispatching centers it is common for eight or more radio base stations to be connected to a single dispatching console. Dispatching personnel can tell which channel a message is being received on by a combination of local protocol, unit identifiers, volume settings, and busy indicator lights. A typical console has two speakers identified as &quot;select&quot; and &quot;unselect&quot;. Audio from a primary selected channel is routed to the select speaker and to a headset. Each channel has a busy light which flashes when someone talks on the associated channel.

Base stations can be local controlled or remote controlled. Local controlled base stations are operated by front panel controls on the base station cabinet. Remote control base stations can be operated over tone- or DC-remote circuits. The dispatch point console and remote base station are connected by leased private line telephone circuits, (sometimes called &quot;RTO circuit&quot;s), a DS-1, or radio links. The consoles multiplex transmit commands onto remote control circuits. Some system configurations require duplex, or four wire, audio paths from the base station to the console. Others require only a two-wire or half duplex link.

 Interference could be defined as receiving any signal other than from a radio in your own system. To avoid interference from users on the same channel, or interference from nearby strong signals on another channel, professional base stations use a combination of:
* minimum receiver specifications and filtering.
* analysis of other frequencies in use nearby.
* in the US, coordination of shared frequencies by coordinating agencies.
* locating equipment so that terrain blocks interfering signals.
* use of directional antennas to reduce unwanted signals.

Base stations are sometimes called &quot;control&quot; or &quot;fixed&quot; stations in US Federal Communications Commission licensing. These terms are defined in regulations inside Part 90 of the commissions regulations. In US licensing jargon, types of base stations include:
* A fixed station is a base station used in a system intended only to communicate with other base stations. A &quot;fixed&quot; station can also be radio link used to operate a distant base station by remote control. (No mobile or hand-held radios are involved in the system.)
* A control station is a base station used in a system with a repeater where the base station is used to communicate through the repeater.
* A temporary base is a base station used in one location for less than a year.
* A repeater is a type of base station that extends the range of hand-held and mobile radios.

==== Amateur and hobbyist use ====

In amateur radio, a base station also communicates with mobile rigs but for hobby or family communications. Amateur systems sometimes serve as dispatch radio systems during disasters, search and rescue mobilizations, or other emergencies.

An Australian UHF CB base station is another example of part of a system used for hobby or family communications.

=== Wireless telephone ===

Wireless telephone differ from two-way radios in that:

* wireless telephones are circuit switched: the communications paths are set up by dialing at the start of a call and the path remains in place until one of the callers hangs up.
* wireless telephones communicate with other telephones usually over the public switched telephone network.

A wireless telephone base station communicates with a mobile or hand-held phone. For example, in a wireless telephone system, the signals from one or more mobile telephones in an area are received at a nearby base station, which then connects the call to the land-line network. Other equipment is involved depending on the system architecture. Mobile telephone provider networks, such as European GSM networks, may involve carrier, microwave radio, and switching facilities to connect the call. In the case of a portable phone such as a US cordless phone, the connection is directly connected to a wired land line.

=== Emissions issues ===

While low levels of radio-frequency power are usually considered to have negligible effects on health, national and local regulations restrict the design of base stations to limit exposure to electromagnetic fields. Technical measures to limit exposure include restricting the radio frequency power emitted by the station, elevating the antenna above ground level, changes to the antenna pattern, and barriers to foot or road traffic. For typical base stations, significant electromagnetic energy is only emitted at the antenna, not along the length of the antenna tower.

Because mobile phones and their base stations are two-way radios, they produce radio-frequency (RF) radiation in order to communicate, exposing people near them to RF radiation giving concerns about mobile phone radiation and health. Hand-held mobile telephones are relatively low power so the RF radiation exposures from them are generally low.

The World Health Organization has concluded that &quot;there is no convincing scientific evidence that the weak RF signals from base stations and wireless networks cause adverse health effects.&quot;

The consensus of the scientific community is that the power from these mobile phone base station antennas is too low to produce health hazards as long as people are kept away from direct access to the antennas. However, current international exposure guidelines (ICNIRP) are based largely on the &quot;thermal&quot; effects of base station emissions, NOT considering the &quot;non-thermal&quot; effects harmless.

=== Emergency power===
Fuel cell backup power systems are added to critical base stations or cell sites to provide emergency power.

<doc id="510118" wikidata="Q145781" url="?curid=510118" title="Cytisus scoparius">
<text>Cytisus scoparius (syn. &quot;Sarothamnus scoparius&quot;), the common broom or Scotch broom, is a deciduous leguminous shrub native to western and central Europe. In Great Britain and Ireland, the standard name is broom; this name is also used for other members of the Genisteae tribe, such as French broom or Spanish broom; and the term &quot;common broom&quot; is sometimes used for clarification. In other English-speaking countries, the most common name is &quot;Scotch broom&quot; (or Scots broom); however, it is known as English broom in Australia.

Though this plant is native to Europe, it has spread to many other parts of the world. Scotch broom is now common in certain areas of North America and South America. This is because people started introducing Scotch broom to different areas of the world. 

After it was introduced in North America, Scotch broom was frequently planted in gardens. Later, it was used for erosion control along highway cuts and fills.

There are other problems with Scotch broom as well. It is slightly toxic and unpalatable to livestock. It also has seeds that are viable for up to ten years, making them able to grow even after years of extermination.

== Description ==
Plants of &quot;C. scoparius&quot; typically grow to tall, rarely to , with main stems up to thick, rarely . Stems are ridged and green. The shrubs have green shoots with small deciduous trifoliate leaves long, and in spring and summer are covered in profuse golden yellow flowers from top to bottom and 15–20 mm wide. Flowering occurs after 50–80 growing degree-days. The seed pods have long hairs only along their seams. In late summer, its legumes (seed pods) mature black, long, broad and 2–3 mm thick; they burst open, often with an audible crack, forcibly throwing seed from the parent plant. This species is adapted to Mediterranean and coastal climates, and its range is limited by cold winter temperatures. It also adapts to windy oceanic climates. The seeds, seedlings, and young shoots are sensitive to frost; adult plants are hardier, and branches affected by freezing temperatures regenerate quickly. &quot;C. scoparius&quot; contains toxic alkaloids that depress the heart and nervous system.

A legume, this shrub can fix nitrogen in the soil through a symbiotic relationship with &quot;Rhizobium&quot; bacteria.

=== Phytochemicals ===
One of the main alkaloids of this plant is cytisine. The characteristic constituents are biogenic amines (mostly tyramine in the young shoots), flavonoids (spiraeoside and scoparoside), isoflavones and their glycosides (genistin), as well as allelopathic quinolizidine alkaloids (mostly sparteine, lupanine, scoparin and hydroxy-derivatives), which defend the plant against insect infestation and herbivores (with the exception of the resistant aphid species &quot;Aphis cytisorum&quot;).

== Classification ==
The two subspecies of &quot;Cytisus scoparius&quot; are: 
* &quot;Cytisus scoparius&quot; subsp. &quot;scoparius&quot; - throughout the species&#x27; range.
* &quot;Cytisus scoparius&quot; subsp. &quot;maritimus&quot; (Rouy) Heywood - Western European maritime cliffs and associated environments; differs with prostrate growth; not over 0.4 m tall; downy young shoots.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Cytisus scoparius&quot; is native to western and central Europe, being common in Great Britain and Republic of Ireland. It is found in sunny sites, usually on dry, sandy soils at low altitudes, tolerating very acidic soil conditions.

Outside of its native range, it is an ecologically destructive colonizing invasive species in grassland, shrub and woodland, and other habitats.

==Ecology==

=== As an invasive species ===

&quot;Cytisus scoparius&quot; has been introduced into several other countries and continents, outside of its native range, and is commonly classified as a noxious invasive species in western North America, mainly in British Columbia (including on Vancouver Island), California, Oregon, Washington (west of the Cascades), the Sierra Nevada range, fragmented areas of North America&#x27;s eastern seaboard, as well as Australia (where it is a declared weed), New Zealand, and in India. These shrubs are sometimes utilized for civic and public landscaping projects in the American west due to their hardiness, and will seasonally reseed themselves, growing in disturbed areas, and along utility and transportation rights-of-way. The prolific growth of the plants after timber harvest or wildfire events clearly inhibits reforestation efforts, the sprouts competing with native plant seedlings and trees. It is estimated that broom is responsible for US$47 million in lost timber production each year in the state of Oregon. In New Zealand, broom is estimated to cost the forestry industry NZ$90 million, and to cost farmers an additional NZ$10 million in losses.

Biological control for broom has been investigated since the mid-1980s, with a number of insect species being tested. Some of the tested invertebrates include the broom twig miner (&quot;Leucoptera spartifoliella&quot;), broom seed beetles (&quot;Bruchidius villosus&quot;), broom gall mites (&quot;Aceria genistae&quot;), sap-sucking broom psyllids (&quot;Arytainilla spartiophila&quot;), the Scotch broom seed weevil (&quot;Exapion fuscirostre&quot;) and recently, the broom leaf beetle (&quot;Gonioctena olivacea&quot;) and broom shoot moths (&quot;Agonopterix assimilella&quot;).

==== Eradication ====
The method used to remove broom is dependent on its prolific seed cycle. Care should be taken to avoid disturbing (aerating, loosening, etc.) the adjacent ground, the sprouting and seedling plants between late spring and mid-fall; late fall through winter (possibly to mid-spring) are preferred times to eradicate mature plants. There are several methods, cutting, pulling, burning, herbicide or introducing chickens and goats. Drought areas respond well to cutting while the seed pods are young and still green. In cooler, wetter areas pulling is the preferred method, and hand-operated broom pullers are available. Low temperature fires, such as a grass fire, will increase seed germination and new sprouts may form on the burned stumps of mature broom. A spring fire followed by drought conditions will reduce seedling survival. Often new plants will grow from roots or seed, requiring repeated treatments.

== Cultivation ==
&quot;Cytisus scoparius&quot; is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant, with several cultivars selected for variation in flower colour, including &quot;Moonlight&quot; with deep yellow flowers, &quot;Andreanus&quot; and &quot;Firefly&quot; with dark orange-red flowers, and growth habit, including &quot;Pendula&quot; with pendulous branchlets.

== Uses ==
Broom contains scoparin, which is a diuretic. The plant also is used as a cathartic and as a cardiac stimulant, which is credited to the presence of sparteine. A decoction or infusion of broom can be used to treat dropsy due to its diuretic action. An ointment can be made from the flowers to treat gout. Oxysparteine, produced from the action of acid on the sparteine, is useful as a cardiac stimulant and has the advantage over digoxin that it does not accumulate in the body. A medicinal beer was brewed from this herb, called broom ale, as a remedy for dropsy.

==Culture==
In Welsh mythology, Blodeuwedd is the name of a woman made from the flowers of broom, meadowsweet (&quot;Filipendula ulmaria&quot;) and the oak by Math fab Mathonwy and Gwydion to be the wife of Lleu Llaw Gyffes. Her story is part of the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi, the tale of &quot;Math son of Mathonwy&quot;.

Broom was considered a sign of plenty when it bore many flowers. However a traditional rhyme from Sussex warns: &quot;Sweep the house with blossomed broom in May/sweep the head of the household away.&quot; Broom was also used in a decorated bundle of broom at weddings in place of rosemary when that was scarce, and its strong smell was said to be able to tame wild horses and dogs.

In Italy, the shrub was burnt with the intent of stopping witches.

=== Royal symbols ===
The name of the House of Plantagenet, rulers of England in the Middle Ages, may have been derived from common broom, which was then known as planta genista in Latin. The plant was used as a heraldic badge by Geoffrey V of Anjou and five Plantagenet kings of England as a royal emblem. The &quot;broomscod&quot;, or seed-pod, was the personal emblem of Charles VI of France.

<text>The Uganda Railway was a metre-gauge railway system and former British state-owned railway company. The line linked the interiors of Uganda and Kenya with the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa in Kenya. After a series of mergers and splits, the line is now in the hands of the Kenya Railways Corporation and the Uganda Railways Corporation.

== Construction ==

===Background===
Before the railway&#x27;s construction, the Imperial British East Africa Company had begun the Mackinnon-Sclater road, a ox-cart track from Mombasa to Busia in Kenya, in 1890.

In July 1890, Britain was party to a series of anti-slavery measures agreed at the Brussels Conference Act of 1890. In December 1890, a letter from the Foreign Office to the treasury proposed constructing a railway from Mombasa to Uganda to disrupt the traffic of slaves from its source in the interior to the coast.

With steam-powered access to Uganda, the British could transport people and soldiers to ensure dominance of the African Great Lakes region.

In December 1891 Captain James Macdonald began an extensive survey which lasted until November 1892. At the time there was only one caravan route across the length of the country, forcing Macdonald and his party to march across unknown routes with limited supplies of water or food. The survey led to the first general map of the region.

The Uganda Railway was named after its ultimate destination, for its entire original length actually lay in what would become Kenya. Construction began at the port city of Mombasa in British East Africa in 1896 and finished at the line&#x27;s terminus, Kisumu, on the eastern shore of Lake Victoria, in 1901.

===Engineering===

The railway is gauge and virtually all single-track with passing loops at stations. 200,000 individual rail-lengths and 1.2 million sleepers, 200,000 fish-plates, 400,000 fish-bolts and 4.8 million steel keys plus steel girders for viaducts and causeways had to be imported from India, necessitating the creation of a modern port at Kilindini Harbour in Mombasa. The railway was a huge logistical achievement and became strategically and economically vital for both Uganda and Kenya. It helped to suppress slavery, by removing the need for humans in the transport of goods. 

===Management===

In August 1895, a bill was introduced at Westminster, becoming the (59 &amp; 60 Vict. c. 38), which authorised the construction of a railway from Mombasa to the shores of Lake Victoria. The man tasked with building the railway was George Whitehouse, an experienced civil engineer who had worked across the British Empire. Whitehouse acted as the Chief Engineer between 1895 and 1903, also serving as the railway&#x27;s manager from its opening in 1901. The consulting engineers were Sir Alexander Rendel of Sir A. Rendel &amp; Son and Frederick Ewart Robertson.

===Workers===
Nearly all the workers involved on the construction of the line came from British India. An agent was appointed in Karachi responsible for recruiting coolies, artisans and subordinate officers and a branch office was located in Lahore, the principal recruiting centre. Workers were sourced from villages in the Punjab and sent to Karachi on specially chartered steamers belonging to the British India Steam Navigation Company. Shortly after recruitment began, a plague broke out in India, seriously delaying the advancement of the railway. The Government of India only permitted recruitment and emigration to resume on the creation of a quarantine camp at Budapore, financed by the Uganda Railway, and where recruits were required to spend fourteen days in quarantine before departure.

A total of 35,729 coolies and artisans were recruited along with 1,082 subordinate officers, totalling 36,811 persons. Each coolie signed a contract for three years at twelve rupees per month with free rations and return passage to their place of enlistment. They received half-pay when in hospital and free medical attendance. Recruitment continued between December 1895 and March 1901, and the first coolies began to return to India after their contracts ended in 1899. 2,493 workers died during the construction of the railway between 1895 and 1903 at a rate of 357 annually. While most of the surviving Indians returned home, 6,724 decided to remain after the line&#x27;s completion, creating a community of Indians in East Africa.
===Law and order===
To maintain law and order, the railway instituted a police department. The force was uniformed and drilled and armed with Martini-Henry rifles. The force was composed of Indians and two officers were lent by the Indian government to drill and superintend the force. A maximum of 400 constables were recruited, and the force was handed over to the Protectorate government on completion of the railway.

=== Resistance ===
At the turn of the 20th century, the railway construction was disturbed by the resistance by Nandi people led by Koitalel Arap Samoei. He was killed in 1905 by Richard Meinertzhagen, ending the Nandi resistance.

==Tsavo man-eating lions==

The incidents for which the building of the railway may be most noted are the killings of a number of construction workers in 1898, during the building of a bridge across the Tsavo River. Hunting mainly at night, a pair of maneless male lions stalked and killed at least 28 Indian and African workers – although some accounts put the number of victims as high as 135.

==Lunatic Express==

The Uganda Railway faced a great deal of criticism in Parliament, with many parliamentarians decrying it as exorbitantly expensive. Whilst the concept of cost-benefit analysis did not exist in public spending in the Victorian Era, the huge capital sums of the project nevertheless made many sceptical of the value of the investment. This, coupled with the fatalities and wastage of the personnel constructing it through disease, tribal activity, and hostile wildlife led the Uganda Railway to be dubbed a &quot;Lunatic Line&quot;:

Political resistance to this &quot;gigantic folly&quot;, as Henry Labouchère called it, surfaced immediately. Such arguments along with the claim that it would be a waste of taxpayers&#x27; money were easily dismissed by the Conservatives. Years before, Joseph Chamberlain had proclaimed that, if Britain were to step away from its &quot;manifest destiny&quot;, it would by default leave it to other nations to take up the work that it would have been seen as &quot;too weak, too poor, and too cowardly&quot; to have done itself. Its cost has been estimated by one source at £3 million in 1894 money, which is more than £170 million in 2005 money, and £5.5 million or £650 million in 2016 money by another source.

Because of the wooden trestle bridges, enormous chasms, prohibitive cost, hostile tribes, men infected by the hundreds by diseases, and man-eating lions pulling railway workers out of carriages at night, the name &quot;Lunatic Line&quot; certainly seemed to fit. Winston Churchill, who regarded it &quot;a brilliant conception&quot;, said of the project: &quot;The British art of &#x27;muddling through&#x27; is here seen in one of its finest expositions. Through everything—through the forests, through the ravines, through troops of marauding lions, through famine, through war, through five years of excoriating Parliamentary debate, muddled and marched the railway.&quot;

The modern term &quot;Lunatic Express&quot; was coined by Charles Miller in his 1971 &quot;The Lunatic Express: An Entertainment in Imperialism&quot;. The term &quot;The Iron Snake&quot; comes from an old Nandi prophecy by Orkoiyot Kimnyolei: &quot;An iron snake will cross from the lake of salt to the lands of the Great Lake to quench its thirst..&quot;

== Extensions and branches ==
Disassembled ferries were shipped from Scotland by sea to Mombasa and then by rail to Kisumu where they were reassembled and provided a service to Port Bell and, later, other ports on Lake Victoria (&quot;see section below&quot;). An rail line between Port Bell and Kampala was the final link in the chain providing efficient transport between the Ugandan capital and the open sea at Mombasa, more than away.

Branch lines were built to Thika in 1913, Lake Magadi in 1915, Kitale in 1926, Naro Moro in 1927 and from Tororo to Soroti in 1929. In 1929 the Uganda Railway became Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours (KURH), which in 1931 completed a branch line to Mount Kenya and extended the main line from Nakuru to Kampala in Uganda. In 1948 KURH became part of the East African Railways Corporation, which added the line from Kampala to Kasese in western Uganda in 1956. and extended to it to Arua near the border with Zaïre in 1964.

==Inland shipping==

===Lake Victoria===

Almost from its inception the Uganda Railway developed shipping services on Lake Victoria. In 1898 it launched the 110 ton at Kisumu, having assembled the vessel from a &quot;knock down&quot; kit supplied by Bow, McLachlan and Company of Paisley in Scotland. A succession of further Bow, McLachlan &amp; Co. &quot;knock down&quot; kits followed. The 662 ton sister ships and (1902 and 1903), the 1,134 ton (1907) and the 1,300 ton sister ships and (1914 and 1915) were combined passenger and cargo ferries. The 812 ton SS &quot;Nyanza&quot; (launched after &quot;Clement Hill&quot;) was purely a cargo ship. The 228 ton launched in 1913 was a tugboat. Two more tugboats from Bow, McLachlan were added in 1925: and .

===Lake Kyoga, Lake Albert and the Nile===
The company extended its steamer service with a route across Lake Kyoga and down the Victoria Nile to Pakwach at the head of the Albert Nile. Its Lake Victoria ships were unsuitable for river work so it introduced the stern wheel paddle steamers (1910) and (1913) for the new service. In the 1920s the company added (1925) and the side wheel paddle steamer (1927).

== Safari tourism ==

As the only modern means of transport from the East African coast to the higher plateaus of the interior, a ride on the Uganda Railway became an essential overture to the safari adventures which grew in popularity in the first two decades of the 20th century. As a result, it usually featured prominently in the accounts written by travelers in British East Africa. The rail journey stirred many a romantic passage, like this one from former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who rode the line to start his world-famous safari in 1909: 

Passengers were invited to ride a platform on the front of the locomotive from which they might see the passing game herds more closely. During Roosevelt&#x27;s journey, he claimed that &quot;on this, except at mealtime, I spent most of the hours of daylight.&quot;

== Current status ==
After independence, the railways in Kenya and Uganda fell into disrepair. In summer 2016, a reporter for &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine took the Lunatic Express from Nairobi to Mombasa. He found the railway to be in poor condition, departing 7 hours late and taking 24 hours for the journey. The last metre-gauge train between Mombasa and Nairobi made its run on 28 April 2017. The line between Nairobi and Kisumu near the Kenya–Uganda border has been closed since 2012.

From 2014 to 2016, the China Road and Bridge Corporation built the Mombasa–Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) parallel to the original Uganda Railway. Passenger service on the SGR was inaugurated on 31 May 2017. The metre-gauge railway is still used to transport passengers between the new SGR Nairobi Terminus and the old metre-gauge train station in Nairobi city centre.

Research has shown that expectations and hopes for the transformations that the Uganda railway would bring about are similar to contemporary visions about the changes that would happen once East Africa became connected to high-speed fibre-optic broadband.

==In popular culture==
A documentary on the construction of the line, &quot;The Permanent Way&quot;, was made in 1961. John Halkin&#x27;s 1968 novel, &quot;Kenya&quot;, focuses on the construction of the railway and its defence during the First World War. The construction also serves as the backdrop to the novel &quot;Dance of the Jakaranda&quot; (Akashic Books, 2017) by Peter Kimani, and appears early in the novel &quot;A History of Burning&quot; by Janika Oza (2023).

The Tsavo man-eating lions at Tsavo feature in a factual account by Patterson&#x27;s 1907 autobiographical book &quot;The Man-eaters of Tsavo&quot;. They are part of the plot of the 1956 film &quot;Beyond Mombasa&quot;, &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; in 1996, and &quot;Chander Pahar&quot;, a 2013 Bengali movie based on the 1937 novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay.

Several other films have featured the Uganda Railway, including &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;, made in 1952. In addition, the 1985 film &quot;Out of Africa&quot; utilizes its railway equipment in several scenes, albeit out of place.

<text>The contrabass clarinet (also pedal clarinet, after the pedals of pipe organs) and contra-alto clarinet are the two largest members of the clarinet family that are in common usage. Modern contrabass clarinets are transposing instruments pitched in B♭, sounding two octaves lower than the common B♭ soprano clarinet and one octave below the bass clarinet. Some contrabass clarinet models have extra keys to extend the range down to low written E♭, D or C. This gives a tessitura written range, notated in treble clef, of C – F, which sounds B♭ – E♭. Some early instruments were pitched in C; Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Fünf Orchesterstücke&quot; specifies a contrabass clarinet in A, but there is no evidence such an instrument has ever existed.

The smaller E♭ contra-alto clarinet is sometimes referred to as the &quot;E♭ contrabass clarinet&quot; and is pitched one octave lower than the E♭ alto clarinet.

Two models of subcontrabass clarinet (the octocontra-alto and octocontrabass) were built as prototypes by Leblanc in the 1930s and survive in the Leblanc museum.

==History==

===Contrabass===
The earliest known contrabass clarinet was the &quot;contre-basse guerrière&quot; invented in 1808 by a goldsmith named Dumas of Sommières; little else is known of this instrument. The &quot;batyphone&quot; (also spelled &quot;bathyphone&quot;, Ger. and Fr. &quot;batyphon&quot;) was a contrabass clarinet which was the outcome of W. F. Wieprecht&#x27;s endeavor to obtain a contrabass for the reed instruments. The batyphone was made to a scale twice the size of the clarinet in C, the divisions of the chromatic scale being arranged according to acoustic principles. For convenience in stopping holes too far apart to be covered by the fingers, crank or swivel keys were used. The instrument was constructed of maple-wood, had a clarinet mouthpiece of suitable size connected by means of a cylindrical brass crook with the upper part of the tube and a brass bell. The pitch was two octaves below the clarinet in C, the compass being the same, and thus corresponding to the modern bass tuba. The tone was pleasant and full, but not powerful enough for the contrabass register in a military band. The batyphone had besides one serious disadvantage: it could be played with facility only in its nearly related keys, G and F major. The batyphone was invented and patented in 1839 by F.W. Wieprecht, director general of all the Prussian military bands, and E. Skorra, the court instrument manufacturer of Berlin. In practice the instrument was found to be of little use, and was superseded by the bass tuba.

A batyphone bearing the name of its inventors formed part of the Snoeck collection which was acquired for Berlin&#x27;s collection of ancient musical instruments at the Hochschule für Musik. Soon after Wieprecht&#x27;s invention, Adolphe Sax created his &quot;clarinette-bourdon&quot; in B.

In 1889, Fontaine-Besson began producing a new &quot;pedal clarinet&quot; (see photograph).
This instrument consists of a tube long, in which cylindrical and conical bores are combined.
The tube is doubled up twice upon itself. 
There are 13 keys and 2 rings on the tube, and the fingering is the same as for the B clarinet except for the eight highest semitones. 
The tone is rich and full except for the lowest notes, which are unavoidably a little rough in quality, but much more sonorous than the corresponding notes on the contrabassoon. 
This is an octave lower than a bass clarinet and two octaves lower than a B♭ clarinet.
The upper register resembles the chalumeau register of the B clarinet, being reedy and sweet. Besson exhibited a new pedal clarinet in London in 1892.
None of these instruments saw widespread use, but they provided a basis for contrabass clarinets made beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by several manufacturers, notably those designed by for Leblanc, which were more successful.

===Contra-alto===

The contra-alto clarinet is higher-pitched than the contrabass and is pitched in the key of E rather than B. The unhyphenated form &quot;contra alto clarinet&quot; is also sometimes used, as is &quot;contralto clarinet&quot;, but the latter is confusing since the instrument&#x27;s range is much lower than the contralto vocal range; the more correct term &quot;contra-alto&quot; is meant to convey, by analogy with &quot;contrabass&quot;, that the instrument plays an octave lower than the alto clarinet. It is also referred to as the E contrabass clarinet. It is the second-largest member of the clarinet family in regular use, larger than the more common bass clarinet but not as large as the B contrabass clarinet.

Like other clarinets, the contra-alto clarinet is a wind instrument that uses a reed to produce sound. The keys of the contra-alto are similar to the keys on smaller clarinets, and are played in the same way. Some contra-alto clarinet models have a range extending down to low (written) E, sounding as the lowest G on the piano (aka G1), while others can play down to low (written) C, sounding E1.

The earliest contra-alto clarinets were developed in the first half of the nineteenth century; these were usually pitched in F and were called &quot;contrabasset horns,&quot; being an octave lower than the basset horn. Albert (probably E. J. Albert, son of Eugène Albert) built an instrument in F around 1890. In the late 19th and early 20th century contra-alto clarinets in E finally attained some degree of popularity.

The contra-alto clarinet is used mostly in concert bands and clarinet choirs, where it usually, though not always, plays the bass line of a piece of music. While there are few parts written specifically for it, the contra-alto can play the baritone saxophone part and sounds the same pitch; it is also possible to read parts written in the bass clef for instruments pitched in C (such as bassoon or tuba) as if the part were in the treble clef, while adjusting the key signature and any accidentals as necessary by adding three sharps to the music. It is occasionally used in jazz, and a few solo pieces have been written for it. The contra-alto clarinet is also used in a few Broadway pit orchestras, with its parts being written in reed books as a doubled instrument (e.g. with soprano clarinet and bass clarinet).

==Subcontrabass (octocontra-alto, octocontrabass)==

In 1935, Belgian instrument maker at Leblanc built a single prototype B♭ , a full octave below the B♭ contrabass and standing high. It was exhibited at the World&#x27;s Fair that year. Its lowest note, C (written D), is the lowest note on a 32′ pedal organ stop. This instrument survives in non-playable condition in the Leblanc collection of the &quot;&quot; in La Couture-Boussey, France.

Houvenaghel also built two slightly smaller prototype clarinets in E♭ for Leblanc in the 1930s, pitched a fifth below the B♭ contrabass and one octave below the E♭ contra-alto clarinet. Only one was ever finished with key work, in 1971 to low C (sounding E♭). Leblanc announced a &quot;retail price of $3700&quot; for the instrument, though none were apparently sold. This instrument was restored to playable condition in 2011 by Cyrille Mercadier, and is also on permanent exhibit in the Leblanc museum.

Although these enormous &quot;octo&quot; clarinets are mentioned in some texts (e.g. Baines, 1991) neither were manufactured by Leblanc beyond the prototype stage. There are some contemporary efforts to recreate them using modern materials and 3D printing technology.
Beginning in late 2018, instrument maker and woodwind technician Jared De Leon began work on prototypes for B♭ octocontrabass and E♭ octocontra-alto clarinets, using PVC piping and salvaged keywork.
In January 2025 he demonstrated a working E♭ octocontra-alto clarinet using a new 3D printed design, after he deemed his PVC prototypes ultimately unsuccessful.
In 2023, German instrument maker Foag Klarinetten developed a fully working all-metal prototype B♭ octocontrabass clarinet, with range to low C.

At least three pieces of music have been written specifically for octocontrabass by Norwegian composer Terje Lerstad (&quot;Trisonata&quot;, Op. 28; &quot;De Profundis&quot;, Op. 139; and &quot;Mirrors in Ebony&quot; for clarinet choir, Op. 144). There are no known recordings of these pieces.

== Development ==
Since 2012, a research team led by Ernesto Molinari (professor at the Bern University of the Arts), Jochen Seggelke (clarinet maker) and Daniel Debrunner (mechatronics engineer) has been developing various prototypes of a new double bass clarinet called CLEX&#x27; (Contrabass Clarinet Extended) as a mechatronic solution. The motorised keys are remotely controlled by the musician&#x27;s fingers via keys equipped with electronic sensors. This type of instrument opens up new musical perspectives for instrumentalists and composers. The positioning of the holes on the clarinet body is completely free of traditional mechanical constraints.

In June 2016, Molinari presented the first of three working prototypes at two concert events.

In a video posted in December 2021, Jared De Leon cited the CLEX project as an inspiration for a new theoretical prototype octocontrabass clarinet that would utilize mechatronic keywork.

==Performers==

Probably the best-known musician who has made significant use of the contrabass clarinet as a solo instrument is Anthony Braxton. Other performers (most of whom use the instrument in the genres of jazz and free improvised music) include James Carter, Brian Landrus, Douglas Ewart, Vinny Golia, Mwata Bowden, Ernst Ulrich Deuker, Paolo Ravaglia, Hamiet Bluiett, Edward &quot;Kidd&quot; Jordan, Harry Sparnaay (NL), Armand Angster (F) and Jason Alder. Leroi Moore of the Dave Matthews Band played a contrabass clarinet on the song &quot;So Right&quot; from the 2001 album &quot;Everyday&quot; and John Linnell of They Might Be Giants utilizes the contra-alto clarinet on their 2013 album &quot;Nanobots&quot;, as well as subsequent releases by the band. Colin Stetson makes use of the instrument on his 2015 collaboration album &quot;Never Were the Way She Was&quot; with violinist Sarah Neufeld and Jochen Seggelke. In 2020, Sarah Watts, a bass clarinet specialist who also plays an active role in commissioning and performing new works for the contrabass clarinet, released a solo album featuring works for contrabass clarinet and piano entitled &quot;Into the Depths&quot;.

== Use in contemporary classical music ==
The contrabass clarinet has a relatively modest yet increasing presence in modern compositions. It is most commonly used in works for wind band, clarinet choir, and solo contrabass clarinet, though there exist pieces for orchestra and other ensembles that call for the contrabass clarinet, and the contrabass clarinet is heavily featured in many film scores.

Some notable composers who have written for the contrabass or contra-alto clarinet include Alfred Reed, Vincent Persichetti, John Adams, Philip Glass, David Maslanka, John Mackey, Daniel Dorff, Franco Donatoni, and David Bennett Thomas.

A catalog of compositions featuring the contrabass clarinet was compiled in 2017 by performer Sarah Watts and may be downloaded without a fee from her website.

=== Concert band ===
The modern concert band (also known as a wind band or wind orchestra) is the ensemble in which the contrabass clarinet is most often found. Most modern concert band scores have parts for either contrabass or contra-alto clarinet, and the contrabass clarinet is useful within a balanced band instrumentation to solidify the low range of the woodwind section. The increasing consistency of the contrabass clarinet&#x27;s inclusion in the modern concert band allows contemporary band composers to score exposed passages or solos for the instrument, which are not typically seen in other ensembles that may include the contrabass clarinet.

Some notable band works that feature the contrabass clarinet include &quot;Blue Shades&quot; by Frank Ticheli, which features a contrabass clarinet solo, and &quot;One Life Beautiful&quot; by Julie Giroux, which calls for either a contrabass clarinet in B♭ or a contra-alto clarinet in E♭. It is specified by the composer that this part is not optional.

=== Clarinet choir ===
The contrabass clarinet forms the lowest bass voice of a modern clarinet choir. While not all contemporary compositions for clarinet choir include parts for the contrabass clarinet, many do, especially more recent pieces.

Some notable works for clarinet choir that call for contrabass clarinet include &quot;Gather at The Rock&quot; by Jenni Brandon and &quot;Dusk&quot; by Steven Bryant.

=== Solo repertoire ===
The contrabass clarinet as a solo instrument has only been explored relatively recently, mirroring the relative recency of the instrument&#x27;s modern development. The body of works for solo contrabass clarinet, encompassing works for unaccompanied contrabass clarinet, contrabass clarinet and piano, and contrabass clarinet and orchestra, is expanding rapidly as contemporary composers continue to explore its unique characteristics and capabilities.

Some notable works for solo contrabass clarinet include Lucien Goethals&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Contrabass Clarinet and Orchestra&quot;, &quot;Soul Searching - Contrabass Clarinet Concerto&quot; by Martin Georgiev, &quot;Ombra I&quot; and &quot;Ombra II&quot; by Franco Donatoni, and &quot;Into the Depths&quot; by Elizabeth Kelly.

=== Orchestra ===
The contrabass clarinet is a very rare visitor to the standard symphony orchestra as a member of the clarinet section, and most orchestra pieces that call for contrabass clarinet feature the instrument as a soloist. Still, there have been occasional additions to the orchestral repertoire that feature the contrabass clarinet, including &quot;On the Transmigration of Souls&quot; by John Adams, &quot;Amériques&quot; by Edgard Varèse, and &quot;La Terre est un homme&quot; by Brian Ferneyhough, which all call for contrabass clarinet as a part of their expanded woodwind sections.

=== Notable appearances in opera and film ===

* &quot;Prometeo&quot;, an unconventional opera by Luigi Nono, features the contrabass clarinet.
* Kepler, an opera by Philip Glass, features a part for contrabass clarinet doubling bass clarinet.
* A prominent contra-alto/contrabass clarinet solo may be heard in a song from the score for the 1968 film &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot;.
* Composer Colin Stetson uses the contrabass clarinet extensively in the score for the 2018 film &quot;Hereditary&quot;.
* Composer Howard Shore features the contrabass clarinet in the score for the 2002 film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;.

<text>The 2S5 &quot;Giatsint-S&quot; () is a Soviet 152 mm self-propelled gun. &quot;2S5&quot; is its GRAU designation. It has nuclear, biological, and chemical protection. The 2S5 is capable of engaging targets at longer ranges and at a higher rate of fire than the more widely produced 2S3 Akatsiya 152 mm self-propelled gun, and is capable of firing nuclear projectiles.

== Production history ==

Production of the 2S5 Giatsint-S (Hyacinth) started in 1976 along with the towed version the 2A36 Giatsint-B. It uses a chassis modified from the SA-4 Krug surface-to-air missile system with good cross-country mobility and is powered by a V-59 diesel engine which develops 520 hp. Giatsint-S can carry 30 152 mm rounds with a range of 28 kilometers, or 33-40 kilometers for rocket-assisted projectiles. In addition to high explosives, the gun can also fire HEAT, cluster, smoke and nuclear projectiles. Deploying to fire the gun takes 3 minutes, and it can sustain a rate of fire of 5 to 6 rounds per minute. Most of the crew, with the exception of the gunner, deploys outside of the vehicle while firing. It is usually accompanied by an ammunition carrier with an additional 30 rounds of ammunition.

The 2S5 was introduced into service in 1978, replacing the 130 mm M46 field gun battalions in Soviet artillery brigades at the Army and Front level, and has also been known as the M1981 by the United States. Production ceased in 1991.

== Operational history ==
The 2S5 was first used in combat by the Soviet Union in Soviet–Afghan War. Later, Russian forces used it in the First Chechen War and Second Chechen War.

The 2S5 has been employed by the Ukrainian Army and Russian Army in the war in Donbas.

<text>Pinamalayan, officially the Municipality of Pinamalayan (), is a municipality in the province of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 90,383 people.

==Etymology==
The town of Pinamalayan is close to the shore at the mouth of the river of the same name. The town&#x27;s name was said to be taken from the word “Ipinamalay na” which means to make aware or to show the way or it has been made known to us. According to an old story, the early settlers of this town came from Marinduque. While they were on their way to Mindoro in their big bancas (boats), they encountered turbulent weather and lost their way. They prayed to the God Almighty for deliverance and guidance, whereupon, the weather cleared and a rainbow appeared on the horizon, and guided them towards safety and to a place where they discovered abundant resources and endless promises. The crew shouted “ipinamalay na” (it was made known).

They followed the direction of the rainbow believing that at its en lies a pot of gold and good fortune. They finally landed at what is now Barangay Lumambayan and established the first settlement which they named Pinamalayan. They found good fortune in the new land which brought them prosperity because of the good soil and abundant resources.

Some other sources attribute the name Pinamalayan simply to the fact that the area was once a vast area planted to rice, hence the name “pinagpalayan” or “Pinamalayan”. Since then the place grew and became a town. However, during the entire 18th century, Pinamalayan was one of the coastal areas frequently attacked by Moro Pirates. People were decimated and many field to the interior for safety. In spite of all these, the town site remained in that place until 1916 when it was transferred by the Americans to its present site.

== History ==
The town of Pinamalayan is one of the oldest in the province of Oriental Mindoro. Its territory once went as far as the old settlements of Sumagui and Anilao which are now part of the towns Bansud and Bongabong respectively. The Town of Pinamalayan was also a former part of Pola until it got its permanent township status in the early years of American Colonization while Gloria was separated from Pinamalayan in 1964.

===Spanish colonial era===
The history of the town has its ancient beginning antedating far back with the advent of the Marinduque settlers in the early part of the 18th century who landed on the shores of the old settlement at Lumang-bayan. The first village was implanted there by the newcomers pushing back the pagans into the interior. In the course of time and subjected by the ravages of Moro piracy, the natives had to fight back the buccaneers as well as the tulisanes at the end of the 19th century. The old Lumang-bayan was the town up to its transfer to the present site on or about 1914. The Recollect Order first established a part of the second ecclesiastic district of Naujan and extend as far as Bongabon, assigning St. Agustine as its titular (Patron Saint).

The pattern of this town&#x27;s territorial expansion dated back during the Spanish time when the villagers of Pinamalayan, Pola, Sumagui, Anilao and Bongabon belonged to one ministry district. That pattern was closely adhered to in the later part of the Spanish regime from 1888 to 1890. It was organized as a permanent settlement with Juan Morente, Sr. as gobernadorcillo and succeeded by his son, Juan Morente, Jr., as Captain (Mayor) in 1890–1894. When the revolution broke out against Spain, Pinamalayan took up arms and underwent some government changes under the provisional Malolos government headed by Juan Medina in 1898. When the Spaniards surrendered, Morente Jr. became governor of the province of Mindoro while Cornelio Nable was appointed as the municipal president.

===American invasion era===
In the Filipino-American War, the American forces took possession of the town, placed it under a military regime from 1901 to 1902; appointed Cornelio Nable as its first President under the new civil government. Reorganized on April 28, 1904, under Act No. 1135 of the Philippine Commission, the municipalities of Bongabon and Pola were annexed to Pinamalayan as barrios. In the following year, on January 4, 1905, under Act No. 1280, the municipality of Pola was annexed to Pinamalayan as a barrio. In 1914, Pinamalayan was organized as a regular municipality. Since then, a new town site has been proposed, selected and surveyed for expansion. This new town site was planned by Governor Juan Morente, Jr. and Mr. Thomas I. Weeks. The American planners made sure that this new town will be laid out properly according to a planning system of wide symmetrical vertical and horizontal roads with proper drainage facilities. A big plaza was further constructed in front of the municipal building. Pinamalayan still stands as a model in town planning to all the municipalities in Oriental Mindoro.

In 1914 to 1916, during these years under review, the national high way to Pinamalayan has also been proposed and completed in 1931.

In January 1912, Pola was separated from Pinamalayan as township and in 1920, Bongabon was separated from Pinamalayan as a municipal district under Act No. 2824 of March 15, 1919. Agriculture and business developments gradually increased with opening of roads. More people immigrated since then; this position of publics land has hastened; homesteading increased and greater areas of uncultivated lands were turned to production.

===Japanese occupation era===
On or about January 20, 1942, the Japanese Army from Calapan occupied the town and appointed Carlos Aguilocho and M. Medina as occupation Mayors. On or about January 15, 1945, the American Army from San Jose landed at Pinamalayan and liberated it from the enemy. Substantial progress has been made in the rehabilitation of the town since 1946. Municipal roads were repaired and extended, three big bridges were constructed (Balete, Nabuslot, and Lumambayan), a water system and a new market were constructed, a puericulture center and the beautification of the town plaza were undertaken. In 1948, Quinabigan was declared a national sub-port. The town is composed of six big barrios, namely; Lumang-bayan, Quinabigan, Nabuslot, Panggulayan, Maligaya, and Balete.

===Contemporary===
====Typhoon Melor====

On December 15, 2015, Pinamalayan is hit by Typhoon Nona (Melor), which made its fifth landfall. The town is badly damaged by the typhoon, with 15,000 homes devastated, about 83% of the 18,000 houses destroyed in Oriental Mindoro, and 24,000 families evacuated.

==Geography==
The town of Ipinamalay (now Pinamalayan) is close to the shore on the river of the same name about 2-3/4 miles- south-westward of Bugot Point. The Pinamalayan River whose source originates from the mountains north of the town empties at the mouth of the old Lumang-Bayan River. Stretching from Mount Dumali in the north-eastern part of the island high and prominent, the coastal trends southward with a succession of sweeping curves towards Pinamalayan Bay to Duyagan Point.

The town is bounded on the north by Babahurin Hill and extends towards the north-west which meets the town of Pola. Towards the south and north, the town lies on an extensive plain and is low and flat towards the south direction to Balete and up to the boundary of Bongabon. About 90% of its area is located on its level plain which extends into the interior. It is intersected by three rivers, namely; the Lumangbayan, the Balete and the Pula Rivers which are short and never navigable. The town is exposed to the north-east monsoon, but with the mountain facing north, it is safe from that direction.

Pinamalayan is from Calapan.

<doc id="510131" wikidata="Q7593916" url="?curid=510131" title="St Kilda West, Victoria">
<text>St Kilda West is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 5 km south of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Port Phillip local government area. St Kilda West recorded a population of 2,951 at the 2021 census.

St Kilda West is bounded by Albert Park and Canterbury Road in the north-east and south-east, West Beach Road, Scoops Lane and Beaconsfield Parade in the south-west, Port Phillip Bay in the west, and Fraser Street in the north and north-west. Fraser Street was the western boundary of the former City of St Kilda, now part of the City of Port Phillip.

It is an almost exclusively residential area characterised by a mix of Victorian terraces, modest Edwardian villas, interwar and post war walk-up flats, as well as some 1960s-70s hi-rise towers facing Port Phillip bay. The suburb&#x27;s community and commercial facilities (including schools and shops) are located in nearby suburbs, and it is well served by public transport.

==History==

The area of St Kilda West was formerly part of a large swamp which included what is now Middle Park, which was drained in the early 1870s, and streets laid out in regular grid plan, subdivided in stages, but only built in sparsely at first. Wider tree lined boulevards were planned for Mary Street and Park Street. Similar to the rest of St Kilda, by the 1890s large terrace houses and large villas had been built along Beaconsfield Parade, Park Street and Mary Street. In the Edwardian era, some terraces were built, but the remaining areas further away from the beach and Fitzroy Street filled up with modest red brick houses, the same type that was quickly filling Middle Park. At the same time, like the rest of St Kilda some of the larger mansions and terraces became guest houses. The Catani Gardens on the beachfront were developed as part of the Edwardian beatification of the foreshore.

St Kilda West Post Office opened around March 1879 (from 1886 until 1970 it was known as St Kilda Railway Station office).

The St Kilda railway line, Melbourne&#x27;s second which opened in 1857, ran along the northern edge of the area, terminating at the northeast corner at Fitzroy Street. Cable trams were built along that street in the 1880s, which was electrified in the 1920s. A new electric tram line from the city was built through Middle Park along Park Street, which opened on 31 October 1925. It originally turned south at Mary Street, then ran along Beaconsfield Parade to terminate at Fitzroy Street. On 8 November 1959 the track was straightened in favour of a short extension along Park Street to Fitzroy Street, now the terminus of Route 12.

Beginning just before World War I with the construction of the Canterbury in 1914, flats began to be built in the still vacant lots in St Kilda West, sometimes replacing earlier houses. This trend continued in the post-war period, including a number of high rise apartment towers on Beaconsfield Parade and on Canterbury Road.

By the 1980s the majority of St Kilda West had become a heritage precinct, and so there has been little redevelopment since. One notable change was the sale of the railway reservation along the other side Canterbury Road which was sold off in the 1990s, and developed as a row of townhouses.

==Landmarks==
* Beaconsfield Hotel, (1880) closed in 2004, the building is a notable landmark with its Italianate towers and has been proposed to be converted into apartments.
* The beach foreshore and Catani Gardens (1906) was planned by Italian civil engineer Carlo Catani with its Edwardian style central rotunda.
* The Canterbury flats built on Canterbury Road (1914-1919) by architects H.W. &amp; F.B Tompkins is one of Melbourne&#x27;s earliest apartment buildings.
* The West Beach Bathers Pavilion at West Beach (1928) was adaptively reused as a cafe and opened in 2004.
* The Gatwick Private Hotel was previously a boarding house, but was bought and renovated by the television show &quot;The Block&quot;.
* The former Cowderoy Dairy on Cowderoy Street (1932) is an art deco building that has been converted into a popular cafe adjacent to a small central park.
* St Kilda War Memorial was erected at Catani Gardens following World War II.
* Newman House on Canterbury Road (200) by architect Cassandra Fahey became a pop architecture icon when completed for local celebrity Sam Newman featuring an image of Pamela Anderson&#x27;s face. Sam did not first obtain council permission, however permits were issued retrospectively when it became a major local landmark and won the award for Best New Residential Building in the Australian Institute of Architects Victorian Architecture awards. Newman never lived in the house and sold it for $1.1 million in mid-2002.

==Open and recreational space==
The suburb has several parks, most notably Catani Gardens and the West Beach foreshore. Other smaller parks include Johnson Reserve on Canterbury Road and the Jacoby Reserve, all of which have playground facilities for children. The Cummins linear reserve on the median of Beaconsfield Parade has public toilets at the Cowderoy Street end. Just outside the suburb are the Albert Park and Lake running along the suburb&#x27;s border to the north east and Cleve Gardens and St Kilda foreshore gardens to the south.

==Transport==
The main thoroughfares are Canterbury Road and Beaconsfield Parade. Both are dual carriageways. Park Street runs along the spine of the suburb and is a single carriageway.

Before conversion to light rail (route 96) in 1987, the rail reserve parallel to Canterbury Road served as the St Kilda railway line, with services to Flinders Street via Middle Park, Albert Park and South Melbourne.

St Kilda West is serviced by four tram routes:

<text>A tap (also spigot or faucet: see usage variations) is a valve controlling the release of a fluid.

==Nomenclature==

===United Kingdom===
* Tap is used in the United Kingdom and most of the Commonwealth for any everyday type of valve, particularly the fittings that control water supply to bathtubs and sinks.

===United States===
* Faucet is the most common term in the US, similar in use to &quot;tap&quot; in British English, e.g. &quot;water faucet&quot; (although the term &quot;tap&quot; is also used in the US).
* Spigot is used by professionals in the trade (such as plumbers), and typically refers to an outdoor fixture.
* Silcock (and sillcock), same as &quot;spigot&quot;, referring to a &quot;cock&quot; (as in stopcock and petcock) that penetrates a foundation sill.
* Bib (bibcock, and hose bib or hosebibb), usually a freeze-resistant version of a &quot;spigot&quot;.
* Wall hydrant, same as &quot;hosebibb&quot;.
* Tap generally refers to a keg or barrel tap, though also commonly refers to a faucet that supplies either hot or cold water and not both. It also appears as a descriptor in &quot;tap water&quot; (i.e. water purified for domestic use). A single temperature tap is commonly found in a commercial or public restroom where the temperature of the water will be controlled by a separate temperature regulating valve that mixes hot and cold water. The regulating valve may be under the handwashing sink or in a separate mechanical room or service closet. These single taps are less prone to breakage from heavy use or vandalism.

==Types==

===Liquid===
Water for baths, sinks and basins can be provided by separate hot and cold taps; this arrangement is common in older installations, particularly in public washrooms/lavatories and utility rooms/laundries. In kitchens and bathrooms, mixer taps are commonly used. In this case, hot and cold water from the two valves is mixed before reaching the outlet, allowing the water to emerge at any temperature between that of the hot and cold water supplies. Mixer taps were invented by Thomas Campbell of Saint John, New Brunswick, and patented in 1880.

For baths and showers, mixer taps frequently incorporate some sort of pressure balancing feature so that the hot/cold mixture ratio will not be affected by transient changes in the pressure of one or other of the supplies. This helps avoid scalding or uncomfortable chilling as other water loads occur (such as the flushing of a toilet).
Rather than two separate valves, mixer taps frequently use a single, more complex, valve controlled by a single handle (single handle mixer). The handle moves up and down to control the amount of water flow and from side to side to control the temperature of the water. Especially for baths and showers, the latest designs are thermostatic mixing valves that do this using a built-in thermostat, and can be mechanical or electronic. There are also taps with color LEDs to show the temperature of the water.

When two pipes are installed, the hot tap generally has a red indicator while the cold tap generally has a blue or green indicator. In the United States, the taps are frequently also labeled with an &quot;H&quot; or &quot;C&quot;. In countries with Romance languages, the letters &quot;C&quot; for hot and &quot;F&quot; for cold are used (from French &quot;chaud&quot;/Italian &quot;caldo&quot;/Spanish &quot;caliente&quot; (hot) and French &quot;froid&quot;/Italian &quot;freddo&quot;/Spanish &quot;frio&quot; (cold)). Portuguese would use Q (for &quot;quente&quot;, hot) and F. This can create confusion for English-speaking visitors. Mixer taps may have a red-blue stripe or arrows indicating which side will give hot and which cold.

In most countries, there is a standard arrangement of hot/cold taps. For example, in the United States and many other countries, the hot tap is on the left by building code requirements. Many installations exist where this standard has been ignored (called &quot;crossed connections&quot; by plumbers). Mis-assembly of some single-valve mixer taps will exchange hot and cold even if the fixture has been plumbed correctly.

In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act provide requirements for faucets, such as requiring less than five pounds of force to operate, and requiring that the user does not have to twist their wrist.
Most handles in homes are fastened to the valve shafts with screws, but on many commercial and industrial applications they are fitted with a removable key called a &quot;loose key&quot;, &quot;water key&quot;, or &quot;sillcock key&quot;, which has a square peg and a square-ended key to turn off and on the water; the &quot;loose key&quot; can be removed to prevent vandals from turning on the water. Before the &quot;loose key&quot; was invented it was common for some landlords or caretakers to take off the handle of a tap, which had teeth that would meet up with the gears on the valve shaft. This tooth and cog system is still used on most modern taps. &quot;Loose keys&quot; may also be found outside homes to prevent passers-by from using them.

Taps are normally connected to the water supply by means of a &quot;swivel tap connector&quot;, which is attached to the end of the water pipe using a soldered or compression fitting, and has a large nut to screw onto the threaded &quot;tail&quot; of the tap, which hangs down underneath the bath, basin or sink. A fibre washer (which expands when wet, aiding the seal) is used between the connector and the tap tail. Tap tails are normally  &quot; or 12 mm in diameter for sinks and  &quot; or 19 mm for baths, although continental Europe sometimes uses a  &quot; (still imperial) size. The same connection method is used for a ballcock.

The term &quot;tap&quot; is widely used to describe the valve used to dispense draft beer from a keg, whether gravity feed or pressurized.

===Gas===

A gas tap is a specific form of ball valve used in residential, commercial, and laboratory applications for coarse control of the release of fuel gases (such as natural gas, coal gas, and syngas). Like all ball valves its handle will parallel the gas line when open and be perpendicular when closed, making for easy visual identification of its status.

==Physics==
Water and gas taps have adjustable flow: gate valves are more progressive; ball valves more coarse, typically used in on-off applications. Turning a valve knob or lever adjusts flow by varying the aperture of the control device in the valve assembly. The result when opened in any degree is a choked flow. Its rate is independent of the viscosity or temperature of the fluid or gas in the pipe, and depends only weakly on the supply pressure, so that flow rate is stable at a given setting. At intermediate flow settings the pressure at the valve restriction drops nearly to zero from the Venturi effect; in water taps, this causes the water to boil momentarily at room temperature as it passes through the restriction. Bubbles of cool water vapor form and collapse at the restriction, causing the familiar hissing sound. At very low flow settings, the viscosity of the water becomes important and the pressure drop (and hissing noise) vanish; at full flow settings, parasitic drag in the pipes becomes important and the water again becomes silent.

==Mechanisms==

The first screw-down tap mechanism was patented and manufactured by the Rotherham brass founders Guest and Chrimes in 1845. Most older taps use a soft rubber or neoprene washer which is screwed down onto a valve seat in order to stop the flow. This is called a &quot;globe valve&quot; in engineering and, while it gives a leak-proof seal and good fine adjustment of flow, both the rubber washer and the valve seat are subject to wear (and for the seat, also corrosion) over time, so that eventually no tight seal is formed in the closed position, resulting in a leaking tap. The washer can be replaced and the valve seat resurfaced (at least a few times), but globe valves are never maintenance-free.

Also, the tortuous S-shaped path the water is forced to follow offers a significant obstruction to the flow. For high pressure domestic water systems this does not matter, but for low pressure systems where flow rate is important, such as a shower fed by a storage tank, a &quot;stop tap&quot; or, in engineering terms, a &quot;gate valve&quot; is preferred.

Gate valves use a metal wedge with a circular face, usually the same diameter as the pipe, which is screwed into place perpendicularly to the flow, cutting it off. There is little resistance to flow when the tap is fully open, but this type of tap rarely gives a perfect seal when closed. In the UK this type of tap normally has a wheel-shaped handle rather than a crutch or capstan handle.

Cone valves or ball valves are another alternative. These are commonly found as the service shut-off valves in more-expensive water systems and usually found in gas taps (and, incidentally, the cask beer taps referred to above). They can be identified by their range of motion—only 90°—between fully open and closed. Usually, when the handle is in line with the pipe the valve is open, and when the handle is across the pipe it is closed. But it could move in either direction CW or CCW perpendicular to the pipe. S=shut and O=open. A cone valve consists of a shallowly tapering cone in a tight-fitting socket placed across the flow of the fluid. In UK English this is usually known as a &quot;taper-plug cock&quot;. A ball valve uses a spherical ball instead. In either case, a hole through the cone or ball allows the fluid to pass if it is lined up with the openings in the socket through which the fluid enters and leaves; turning the cone using the handle rotates the passage away, presenting the fluid with the unbroken surface of the cone through which it cannot pass. Valves of this type using a cylinder rather than a cone are sometimes encountered, but using a cone allows a tight fit to be made even with moderate manufacturing tolerances. The ball in ball valves rotates within plastic (usually PTFE) seats.

Hands free infrared proximity sensors are replacing the standard valve. Thermostatically controlled electronic dual-purpose mixing or diverting valves are used within industrial applications to automatically provide liquids as required.

Foot controlled valves are installed within laboratory and healthcare/hospitals, as well as in industrial settings where extremely dirty hands operating taps might leave residues on them.

Modern taps often have aerators at the tip to limit water flow and introduce air in the form of bubbles to reduce splashing. Without an aerator, water usually flows out of the tap in one big stream. An aerator spreads the water flow into many small droplets. In sanitary settings such as hospitals or laboratories &quot;laminar flow devices&quot; are used in place of aerators. Laminar flow devices restrict flow and direct the water into a smooth stream without introducing the surrounding air which could contain hazardous bacteria or particles.

Modern bathroom and kitchen taps often use ceramic or plastic surfaces sliding against other spring-loaded ceramic surfaces or plastic washers. These taps exploit the uniquely low value of the coefficient of friction of 2 ceramic surfaces in contact, especially in the presence of water as a lubricant. These taps tend to require far less maintenance than traditional globe valves, and when maintenance is required the entire interior of the valve is usually replaced, often as a single pre-assembled &quot;cartridge&quot;.

Of three manufacturers in North America, Moen and American Standard use cartridges (Moen&#x27;s being O-ring based, American Standard&#x27;s being ceramic), while Delta uses rubber seats facing the cartridges. Each design has its advantages: Moen cartridges tend to be easiest to find, American Standard cartridges have nearly infinite lifespan in sediment-free municipal water, and Delta&#x27;s rubber seats tend to be most forgiving of sediment in well water.

===Backflow prevention===
Most US jurisdictions now require hose spigots, hosebibbs, and wall hydrants to have a vacuum breaker or backflow preventer, so that water cannot return through the spigot from the hose. This prevents contamination of the building or public water system should there be a pressure drop. In the UK, water regulations require a double check valve; this is often incorporated within the body of the tap itself.

<doc id="510134" wikidata="Q6841517" url="?curid=510134" title="Middle Park, Victoria">
<text>Middle Park is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 5 km south of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Port Phillip local government area. Middle Park recorded a population of 4,000 at the 2021 census.

It is located between Port Phillip and Albert Park Lake, which is about halfway across the western side of the Albert Park Reserve (a state park), hence the name &quot;Middle&quot; Park. It is bordered by Canterbury Road to the east, Mills Street to the north, Fraser Street to the south and Beaconsfield Parade to the west.

Middle Park, along with neighbouring Albert Park, contains some of the best preserved terrace house and Victorian architecture in Melbourne and is part of a strict heritage-conservation area. Many of the terraces line Canterbury Road, along the former railway line, which now has several more tram light rail stops since it was converted to tram use in 1987. Others are along the main shopping street, Armstrong Street. The fine old buildings and development restrictions in the area and new developments are generally sympathetic to the prevailing style, driving up real-estate prices dramatically, in marked contrast with neighbouring St Kilda.

==Demographics==

In Middle Park 71.0% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were England 5.1%, Greece 3.2%, New Zealand 2.5%, Italy 1.1% and United States of America 1.1%.

==Landmarks==
*Middle Park Hotel is a large Victorian hotel building on the corner of Canterbury Road and Armstrong Street. Built in 1889, it features wrought-iron lacework. The building was modified in the 1950s: decorative urns were removed, new doors were added, and windows were bricked up. Following a refurbishment in 2001, it was renamed the Gunn Island Brew Bar Hotel, in a reference to the island within nearby Albert Park Lake. Following another refurbishment in 2009, the hotel resumed trading under its original name. It provides bars, dining and accommodation facilities. It had a further refurbishment in early 2020. It is the only hotel in Middle Park.
*The Carmelite Roman Catholic Church was built in November 1891 by the Carmelites. It is a red and buff brick building with cement facings, built in Gothic style with a tall belfry at the south-east corner. The church features a large pipe organ  to accompany the singing of High Mass on Sunday mornings. It is the only Christian church in Middle Park as all the Protestant churches closed over the last few decades. The Carmelite Library located in the Carmelite Hall holds Australia&#x27;s finest collection of books in the area of spirituality and mysticism.

<text>Albert Park is an inner suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District. The suburb is named after Albert Park, a large lakeside urban park located within the City of Port Phillip local government area. Albert Park recorded a population of 6,044 at the 2021 census.

The suburb of Albert Park extends from the St Vincent Gardens to Beaconsfield Parade and Mills Street. It was settled residentially as an extension of Emerald Hill (South Melbourne). It is characterised by wide streets, heritage buildings, terraced houses, open air cafes, parks and significant stands of mature exotic trees, including Canary Island Date Palm and London Planes.

The Albert Park Circuit has been home to the Australian Grand Prix since 1996, with the exception of 2020–2021 due to the COVID-19 lockdowns.

==History==
Indigenous Australians first inhabited the area that is now Albert Park around 40,000 years ago. The area was a series of swamps and lagoons. The main park after which the suburb was named was declared a public park and named in 1864 to honour Queen Victoria&#x27;s consort, Prince Albert.

Albert Park was used as a garbage dump, a military camp and for recreation before the artificial lake was built. In 1854 a land-subdivision survey was done from Park Street, South Melbourne, to the northern edge of the parkland (Albert Road). St Vincent Gardens were laid out and the surrounding streets home to the city&#x27;s most successful citizens. Street names commemorated Trafalgar and Crimean War personalities.

Heritage Victoria notes that Albert Park&#x27;s St Vincent Gardens &quot;is historically important as the premier &#x27;square&#x27; development in Victoria based on similar models in London. It is significant as the largest development of its type in Victoria and for its unusual development as gardens rather than the more usual small park&quot; and &quot;was first laid out in 1854 or 55, probably by Andrew Clarke, the Surveyor-General of Victoria. The current layout is the work of Clement Hodgkinson, the noted surveyor, engineer and topographer, who adapted the design in 1857 to allow for its intersection by the St Kilda railway line. The precinct, which in its original configuration extended from Park Street in the north to Bridport Street in the south and from Howe Crescent in the east to Nelson Road and Cardigan Street in the west, was designed to emulate similar &#x27;square&#x27; developments in London, although on a grander scale. The main streets were named after British naval heroes. The development of the special character of St Vincent Place has been characterised, since the first land sales in the 1860s, by a variety of housing stock, which has included quality row and detached houses and by the gardens which, although they have been continuously developed, remain faithful to the initial landscape concept.&quot;

St Vincent&#x27;s is a garden of significant mature tree specimens. It is registered with the National Trust and is locally significant for the social focus the gardens provide to the neighbourhood. Activities in the park range from relaxing walks, siestas to organised sports competition. The Albert Park Lawn Bowls Club was established in 1873 and the Tennis Club established 1883, on the site of an earlier croquet ground.

==Geography==

Albert Park features part of the massive Albert Park and Lake (formerly South Park in the 19th century until it was also renamed after Prince Albert) and is located nearby. It is a significant state park managed by Parks Victoria. It is also known as the site of the Albert Park Circuit.

===Commercial centres===

Commercial centres include Bridport Street, with its cafes and shops and Victoria Avenue, known for its cafes, delicatessens and boutiques.

===Beach areas===
Albert Park has a long beach frontage, with several distinctive features, including many grand buildings (such as the Victoria Hotel, a grand hotel and former coffee palace, now café bar, built in 1887) and Victorian terrace homes; Kerferd Kiosk, an iconic Edwardian bathing pavilion and Kerferd Pier, which terminates Kerferd Road and is a jetty onto Port Phillip, used for fishing by many and sharks have occasionally been found around it.

===Albert Park and Lake===

The lake is popular with strollers, runners and cyclists. Dozens of small yachts sail around the lake on sunny days. Only the north eastern part of the park and lake is actually in the suburb, the rest is in the neighbouring suburbs of South Melbourne, Melbourne, Middle Park and St Kilda.

==Demographics==

At the , Albert Park had a population of 6,215. 66.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 5.4%, Greece 4.0% and New Zealand 2.5%. 74.2% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek at 8.0%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 39.3% and Catholic 18.4%.

==Housing==
Albert Park is composed mainly of Victorian terrace and semi-detached housing. Many residential areas are in heritage overlays to protect their character. Boyd Street, a leafy backstreet near Middle Park, is a fine example of this.

==Transport==

Beaconsfield Parade is the main beachside thoroughfare, between St Kilda and Port Melbourne, which runs along the Port Phillip foreshore. Richardson Street and Canterbury Road follows a similar inland route south to St Kilda. The main road arterial is Kerferd Road, a wide boulevard lined with elm trees and a central reservation, which connects from South Melbourne&#x27;s Albert Road. Pickles Street, Victoria Avenue and Mills Street are the main roads running west and east toward South Melbourne.

Several tram routes service Albert Park; Route 1 along Victoria Avenue, Route 12 along Mills Street and Route 96 on a reservation parallel to Canterbury Road.

Until 1987, Albert Park was serviced by the St Kilda railway line, with Albert Park railway station being located at Bridport Street. The line has since been converted to serve trams, and forms a large part of the Route 96 tram line.

CDC Melbourne&#x27;s Route 606 runs through the suburb. There are segregated cycle facilities along the beach and Canterbury Roads, with marked bicycle lanes elsewhere.

==Sport==

The suburb has been home to the Formula One Australian Grand Prix since 1996. The Albert Park Circuit runs on public roads. The choice of Albert Park as a Grand Prix venue was controversial, with protests by the Save Albert Park group. In preparing the Reserve for the race existing trees were cut down and replaced during landscaping, roads were upgraded, and facilities were replaced. Both major political parties support the event. The Melbourne Supercars Championship is also held on the same circuit.

Albert Park is the home of soccer club South Melbourne FC who play out of Lakeside Stadium; aptly named due to its positioning next to Albert Park Lake. Lakeside Stadium (known then as Bob Jane Stadium) was redeveloped in 2010 to include an international standard athletics track, as well as new grandstands and administrative facilities, and is also the home of the Victorian Institute of Sport. The stadium was built on the site of the old Lake Oval, which was an historic Australian rules football venue for the South Melbourne Football Club.

The Melbourne Sports &amp; Aquatic Centre (MSAC) is a large swimming centre, which hosted squash, swimming, diving events and table tennis during the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The MSAC is also the home of the Melbourne Tigers that play in the NBL1 South.

In December 2006 polo returned to Albert Park Reserve after an absence of 100 years.

Albert Park is home to a parkrun event. The event at Albert Park is held at 8am every Saturday and starts in the Coot Picnic area, opposite the MSAC.

<doc id="510148" wikidata="Q7225723" url="?curid=510148" title="Pollokshaws">
<text>Pollokshaws () is an area on the South side of the city of Glasgow, Scotland. It is bordered by the residential neighbourhoods of Auldhouse to the east, Eastwood and Hillpark to the south and Shawlands to the north, with the Glasgow South Western Line railway and the open lands of Pollok Country Park to the west. The White Cart Water flows through the area.

The housing stock consists of some sandstone tenement housing, modern brick tenement-style buildings, low-rise social housing and high rise/multi-storey tower blocks. Previously eight tower blocks stood in an area known as the Shawbridge Corridor; the last of these blocks was demolished in March 2016. Four other tower blocks remain, near Pollokshaws East railway station.

According to the 2001 Census, Pollokshaws had a population of 4,295. Its residents are a mixture of working class and middle class social groups, and the area also had a large South Asian community.

==History==

Pollokshaws was originally a village predominantly dedicated to weaving in the 17th century. A group of Flemish weavers were brought to the area in the 19th century by the landowners, the Maxwells of Pollok, on account of their exceptional weaving skills.

Pollokshaws was granted a charter to become a Burgh of Barony in 1812. It became a police burgh in 1858 and remained a burgh of Renfrewshire until 1912 when it was annexed to the City of Glasgow. Though it had been an industrial area, this changed in 1957 when it was proposed as the second Comprehensive Development Area in Glasgow (the first was Hutchesontown). The area was demolished and rebuilt anew.
 
Several residential tower blocks were built as part of the CDA plan in the 1960s. Most of these were later demolished between 2008 and 2016 in the Shawbridge Corridor regeneration. The blowdowns of the first two towers in July 2008 was filmed in detail by an American company and can be seen as part of the documentary series &quot;The Detonators&quot;. Low-rise, mainly private housing has replaced the blocks. A group of four towers at Shawhill remain standing going into the 2020s, along with a single block at Cartcraigs on the southern periphery of the district.

==Landmarks==
Pollokshaws Burgh Hall on Pollokshaws Road, built in 1895–98 by architect Robert Rowand Anderson in the Scots renaissance style, was originally the municipal headquarters of the independent burgh before passing into the ownership of Glasgow Corporation following annexation. Now a Category A listed building, it was closed by the council in the 1990s but subsequently reopened for community use by a charitable trust.
Sir John Stirling Maxwell Primary School, located on Bengal Street / Christian Street, was a standalone red sandstone building by architect John H Hamilton, completed in 1907. The site of the school was previously donated by local philanthropic landowner Sir John Stirling Maxwell, after whom it was named. The school was closed in June 2011 and despite local pressure and campaigns the building was allowed to rot and stood derelict for some years. It was demolished in 2023 after being deemed structurally unsafe beyond repair, with the council promising to save and re-use some of its features in a future project.

Pollokshaws Clock Tower, located on Pleasance Street, is the surviving part of the old Town House, built in 1803. There was a ground-floor school with a court-room and a police cell above it. From 1818, the Town House building also housed a library. 
The Pollokshaws Burgh Charter empowered the council to hold courts for the trial both of civil actions and criminal offences. A jail to incarcerate local wrongdoers was built in 1845. After the 1912 annexation of Pollokshaws Burgh to the City of Glasgow, most of the Town House was demolished and only a public campaign managed to save the remaining Clock Tower.
The Round Toll is a circular building now located on the central island of the roundabout of the same name (junction of B762 Barrhead Road / Nether Auldhouse Road and B769 Pollokshaws Road / Thornliebank Road). Built around 1820 as a tollbooth, it is the only surviving example of this type of building in the area, others having been lost to road development, and a rare example of an older building in Pollokshaws following 20th century slum clearance and redevelopment. It is now Category B listed. Following the abolition of road tolls in the 1880s it served as a carriage hire premises, a pub, and latterly as a private house up until the 1950s. It was subsequently used for council storage but is now vacant and isolated on the roundabout.

==Sport==
Pollokshaws Bowling Club was formed in 1854 and was originally across from Pollokshaws West railway station. On the club&#x27;s centenary, the clubhouse and greens moved into Pollok Park rent free thanks to Sir John Stirling Maxwell.

The Pollokshaws Races, an informal horse racing event staged annually from around 1750 until 1883, took place on a racecourse to the southwest of the village, on land now occupied by Kennishead Road and Cowglen Golf Club. The races initially developed in conjunction with the local holiday, the Pollokshaws Fair, and were viewed more as an excuse for drinking and socialising rather than a serious sporting event.

Pollok F.C.&#x27;s Newlandsfield Park is in the area, adjacent to Pollokshaws East railway station.

<doc id="510149" wikidata="Q398845" url="?curid=510149" title="Agusta">
<text>Agusta was an Italian helicopter manufacturer. It was based in Samarate, Northern Italy. The company was founded by Count Giovanni Agusta in 1923, who flew his first airplane in 1907. The MV Agusta motorcycle manufacturer began as an offshoot of the Agusta aviation company at the end of the Second World War, as a means to save the jobs of employees of the Agusta firm.

In July 2000, Agusta merged with Westland Helicopters to form AgustaWestland S.p.A., a multinational helicopter design and manufacturing company, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Leonardo S.p.A.

== History ==
From 1952, the company became involved in helicopter manufacturing, first building Bell helicopters under licence, but later Sikorsky, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas products as well. The company also had ambitions to design and build its own helicopters. The Agusta A.101 and the Agusta A.106 can be considered the best of its earlier attempts. Others included the AB.102, A.103, A.104, and A.115. It also produced a small line of aero engines such as the GA.70 and GA.140.

Developed in the 1970s, the Agusta A109 is a commercial and military twin-turbine helicopter, of which the latest variants are still in production.

In 1983, the Agusta A129 Mangusta anti-tank helicopter partook in its first official flight engagement. It was the first attack helicopter to be designed and produced in Western Europe. However, this helicopter has been a limited commercial success so far, seeing service with the Italian Army, and has also been a modernized variant being developed for the Turkish Army.

The 1980s saw the start of several collaborative projects for Agusta. In 1981 Agusta and Westland of Britain started the EH101 medium-lift naval helicopter project in order to satisfy the requirements of the Royal Navy and the Italian Navy. In 1985 the company started a collaborative programme with the aeronautic industries of France, Germany and the Netherlands in order to develop and produce the NHIndustries NH90, a nine-ton twin-engine multi-role medium helicopter in order to satisfy the requirements of their respective countries’ armed forces.

1990s projects include the Agusta A109 Power, an improved version of the A109C series (1994) and the Agusta A119 Koala (1997), a single-engine design based on the A109.

Agusta became involved in the Belgian bribery scandal when it was revealed that the company had paid the two Belgian socialist parties who were then (1988/1989) in the government to assist the company in getting the contract for attack helicopters for the Belgian Army.

In 1998, Agusta formed a joint venture with Bell Helicopter Textron called the Bell/Agusta Aerospace Company. Its aim was to develop the Bell/Agusta AB139 helicopter and the Bell/Agusta BA609 tiltrotor aircraft. Bell later withdrew from the BA609 project, which is now known as the AgustaWestland AW609.

In July 2000, Finmeccanica and GKN plc agreed to merge their respective helicopter subsidiaries (Agusta and GKN-Westland Helicopters), forming AgustaWestland.

It was reported on 12 February 2013 that the chief executive, Giuseppe Orsi, was arrested on corruption charges. Prosecutors allege he paid bribes to ensure the sale of 12 helicopters to the Indian government, when he was head of the group&#x27;s AgustaWestland unit.

On 13 February 2013, Finmeccanica&#x27;s Board of Directors named Alessandro Pansa as chief executive officer and resolved to confer the role of vice chairman to Admiral Guido Venturoni.

Shortly after Pansa&#x27;s appointment, Italian investigators discovered a case of bribery by Finmeccanica in its deal with India following which the government of India issued a show cause notice to the company.

A complaint was filed seeking an investigation into the sale of 21 civil helicopters worth over Rs 7,000 crore (US$1.6 billion) by AgustaWestland between 2005 and 2013 in India. As per the complaint Agusta Westland has been selling civil helicopters in India through. Tax authorities in India have been asked to probe the possibility of tax evasion by Sharp Ocean on the commission received for the sale of helicopters and foreign exchange deprivation to the country by off-shoring payments for the sale of helicopters in India.

Separately, the comptroller and auditor general, in its latest report, has indicted the Chhattisgarh government for overpaying Rs.65 lakh (US$120,000) for the purchase of a VVIP helicopter -an Agusta A-109 Power helicopter. Both companies are promoted by twin brothers Nayan Jagjivan and Nakul Jagjivan.

<doc id="510150" wikidata="Q890166" url="?curid=510150" title="Boeing 314 Clipper">
<text>The Boeing 314 Clipper was an American long-range flying boat produced by Boeing from 1938 to 1941. One of the largest aircraft of its time, it had the range to cross the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. For its wing, Boeing re-used the design from the earlier XB-15 bomber prototype. Twelve Clippers were built, nine of which served with Pan Am. It was the first aircraft to carry a sitting American president, when in 1943 Franklin D. Roosevelt flew from Miami to the Casablanca Conference in Morocco, via Trinidad, Brazil, and The Gambia.

==Development==
===Background===
As early as 1935 Pan American had identified that a truly trans-Pacific flying boat with unprecedented range and double the passenger payload of the airline&#x27;s Martin M-130 would be required particularly if they were to provide a service across the longer more difficult Atlantic route and requested proposals from a number of American manufacturers.

In February 1936, not long after the M-130s were introduced into service, Pan American launched a design competition for the first transoceanic airliner. Boeing, Douglas, Consolidated, Martin and Sikorsky were requested to provide preliminary studies and proposals for a long-range, four engine, marine aircraft. The new plane had to be able to transport up to 10,000 pounds of payload with a minimum range of 2,400 miles and cruise speed of 150 mph at an altitude of 10,000 feet. Pan American was also adamant about providing comfort, space, and luxury for their passengers, as well as providing the ultimate in safety.
Martin proposed a larger modified version of their M-130 called the M-156 which would offer a longer range and bigger payload with either a 53 day or 26 sleeper configuration.
Sikorsky proposed their S-45 whose six engines promised a 52,000 lb payload, but the first aircraft would not be available until late 1939 or early 1940 and it would cost more than the other proposals.

===Boeing’s submission===
After receiving the Pan American request on February 28, 1936, Boeing decided to not submit a proposal, as at the time the company&#x27;s resources were committed on simultaneous contracts for the United States Army Air Corps. The deadline had passed when a young Boeing engineer, Wellwood E. Beall, became aware of the Pan American project, and thought that Boeing should consider submitting a bid.

Beall had had just returned to the United States in 1935 from serving as the company&#x27;s Far Eastern manager with responsibility for selling the company&#x27;s fighter and transport planes to the Chinese Government. During his time in China he had often thought about the design of a large flying boat and he now worked in his spare time on a preliminary design.

As Pan American had specified the engines and propellers in advance, Beall proposed to use the wing of the cancelled XB-15 bomber, which had already been designed and wind-tunnel tested; this would allow Boeing to confine the design effort to the hull and the flotation stability and tail assemblies. To supplement his preliminary design study, his then wife, well-known artist and muralist Jean Cory Beall, produced color paintings of the cabin interiors. His proposal was accepted by Boeing management, and he was given permission to request an extension from Pan American, which was granted. 

Beall was transferred to the engineering department and allocated 11 engineers to work on the project. The engineering team calculated that the optimum wingspan for the flying boat needed to compared with the XB-15’s . The shortfall was overcome by adding to the width of the fuselage. He combined the wing with more powerful Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone engines, each of which produced 50% more power than the of the XB-15&#x27;s Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp engines. The XB-15&#x27;s engine nacelles were also retained, as they had originally been designed to house Allison V-3420 liquid-cooled W engines, which since these were not ready, had been replaced on the bomber by the smaller and less powerful Pratt &amp; Whitneys. The engineers estimated that their proposed design would weigh 40,000 lbs and could carry a payload of up to 42,500 lbs.

Sufficient work was completed by May 1936 for Beall, company president Claire Egtvedt, aerodynamicist Ralph LaVenture Cram (1906-1939) to depart on May 9, 1936 from Seattle to New York, where they made a presentation of their proposal to Pan American.
Pan American accepted Boeing’s proposal, awarding it a $4.8 million contract on July 21, 1936 for six aircraft with an option for six more. This order represented the first that Pan American had placed with the company. The first aircraft was to be delivered by December 21, 1937. An amendment to the contract on January 20, 1937 granted a three month extension to the specified delivery date for the first six aircraft.

The aircraft&#x27;s introduction was impacted by the complexity of the design and testing and the passage of the Civil Aeronautics Act in 1938, establishing the Civil Aeronautics Board, which had the power to review and certify new aircraft. Boeing missed its contracted delivery date by 13 months.

===Testing===
There was no dedicated prototype; instead, the first production unit, NX-18601, was used for testing. Once completed it was launched into the Duwamish Waterway and towed to Elliott Bay on Puget Sound for taxi and flight tests. Its wingspan was so great that it had to be turned diagonally to pass through the supports of bridges spanning the waterway. From here it commenced its first taxiing run on 3 June with test pilot Edmund T. Allen at the controls, but he soon identified that it was too lightly loaded when a gust of wind lifted one wing and dipped the other and after increasing the engine power failed to correct the situation it became necessary for all spare crew members to climb out onto the raised wing to balance the aircraft and allow it to safely return to shore. Following the installation of temporary ballast further taxiing tests continued for a week.

The first test flight was undertaken by Allen on the June 7, 1938, and once airborne it was immediately identified that the aircraft had insufficient rudder control. He was only able to turn the aircraft by increasing the power of the engines on one wing and decreasing that of the engines on the other. This first flight lasted 38 minutes. This directional instability had been observed during wind tunnel tests but Boeing management had rejected any changes to the original single fin configuration to correct it. Someone else who had identified the issue was George S. Schairer, at the time a young engineer at Consolidated Aircraft. After seeing a photograph of NX-18601 with its original tail configuration on the cover of an aviation magazine he had written to Boeing, stating that he believed the tail was too small. NX-18601 was immediately modified into a twin fin configuration, but this was still found to be insufficient and so the centerline vertical fin was restored, which resolved the issue and this three fin arrangement became the production configuration.

Months of extensive testing continued and on January 26, 1939, the 314 was approved the Civil Aeronautics Board for commercial airworthiness.

==Design==
The 314 was a high wing flying boat which used a series of heavy metal ribs and spars to create a robust fuselage and cantilevered wing, eliminating the need for external drag-inducing struts to brace the wings. It was metal skinned with the exception of the control surfaces. 
The aircraft were assembled at Boeing&#x27;s Plant 1 on the Duwamish River in Seattle. The design required the production of 6,000 engineering drawings, 50,000 separate parts, 11 miles of electrical wiring, 576,000 rivets and 15,200 bolts.

===Engines===
The original six 314s were powered by four air-cooled, supercharged Wright Aeronautical Corporation Cyclone 14 GR2600A2, two-row, 14-cylinder radial engines.
The six 314A’s had the more powerful Cyclone 14 GR2600A2A engines. These engines were subsequently retrofitted to the original 314s during engine overhauls.

Commonly known as &quot;Twin Cyclones&quot;, these engines were the first to use 100 octane gasoline in commercial service. The 314 was the first use of this engine, which at the time was not only the largest engine installed on a commercial aircraft, but also offered the lowest specific fuel consumption.

The engines drove Hamilton Standard hydromatic full-feathering constant-speed propellers through reduction gears. The development of these propellers had been fostered by Pan American. In a first for commercial operation, these offered both variable pitch and full-feathering which meant that in the event of an engine fault the three blades of the diameter propellers could be turned directly into the airflow, and so would not rotate and risk further damaging the engine by “windmilling”. Turning the blades into the airflow also reduced drag which was important on long flights over water. On the GR2600A2 engines, the propellers had a diameter of , while on the GR2600A2A, they had a diameter of . When installed in 1940, they featured the first NACA propeller aerofoil sections on a commercial aircraft.

The 314 featured the first use of rate of flow fuel meters when they were installed in 1939 at the engineer’s station as a permanent fitting on an aircraft. Previously they had been only installed as a temporary device during testing. Pan American had supported their development.

====Fuel capacity====
To fly the long ranges needed for trans-Pacific service, the 314 carried of gasoline. The later 314A model carried a further . A capacity of of oil was required for operation of the radial engines.

===Wings===
The wings were constructed in five sections of an aluminum outer skin formed over spars constructed out of bolted square aluminum alloy tube trusses while the ribs were formed out of aluminum alloy tubes and channels. They had a NACA 0018 airfoil profile at their root which changed to a NACA 0010 profile at their tip. The outer ends of the wings were made watertight, which allowed them to provide flotation if the aircraft heeled over in rough conditions.

The wings were thick enough to incorporate a crawlspace, through which each engine nacelle could be accessed by a flight engineer. After removing the two sections of the stainless-steel firewall behind each engine, they could service and if possible repair it in flight, as the fully-feathering propellers made it possible for an engine to be completely shut down. Between June 1939 and June 1941, 431 in-flight engine repairs were performed. The most common problem was fouled spark plugs.

Each nacelle had a side access door on either side which opened downwards and which could be used as work platforms. Each aircraft also carried portable work platforms that could be hung on the outside, forward of the access doors to allow work on the engines.
The center sections of each wing contained two fuel tanks as well as compartments for transport of cargo, in particular mail.

The wings were fitted with metal-framed fabric-covered &quot;split&quot; type flaps located under each wings trailing edge. When taking off the flaps were set to 20 degrees and when landing their full deflection of 60 degrees was typically used.
The metal-framed fabric-covered ailerons were of the Frieze type, each having a single trim tab divided into two separate units to reduce any binding of the aileron’s hinge when the wing flexed under load.

===Hull===
The wide hull was of all metal construction and differed from previous flying boats in that the lower central section was constructed as an integral section with the wings and inner engine nacelles. The remaining parts of the hull were separately constructed in sections and then attached to it. Instead of the hull being split into numerous watertight compartments the hull had only two full height watertight bulkheads, a front collision bulkhead ahead of the flight deck and a compartmented double bottom.

The 314 had a transverse hydroplane step just to the rear of the center of gravity with a second step, farther aft which terminated on the original 314’s at a rudder for steering the flying boat when it was in the water. This rudder was subsequently removed and was not fitted to the 314As as it was found in service that the aircraft could be steered in the water by varying the power to the engines on each side.

The lower mid hull of the 314 was fitted with Dornier-style sponsons. These sponsons, broad lateral extensions at the waterline on both sides of the hull, served several purposes: They provided a wide platform to stabilize the craft while on the water, they acted as a platform for boarding and exiting, and they possessed an intentional air foil shape which contributed additional aerodynamic lift in flight. Each was divided into five compartments, two of which were used as fuel tanks. Each sponson had sufficient reserve buoyancy to maintain stability if one of the compartments filled with water.
The fuselage drew of water.

The tail section consisted of a metal-skinned horizontal stabilizer on those center was a single central metal-frame fabric covered fin and on each outboard end, a metal-skinned outboard fully cantilevered fin. The metal skinned stabilizer was built as a single unit and was bolted directly to the top of the hull with a streamline fairing for it. The metal-frame fabric-covered elevators fitted to on each end of the stabilizer were so large and heavy that in a first they were fitted with separate control and trim tabs on each side. The control tab had twice the effectiveness of the trim tab. Springs, which gave a degree of &quot;feel&quot; proportional to elevator movement were incorporated in the connections to the pilot&#x27;s controls moved the tabs, which in turn moved the elevators. At high angles of movement, the spring became rigid and further elevator movement was directly from the control column. While not aerodynamically balanced, the elevators were statically balanced to 85% by a counterweight in the hull and by smaller weights on their outboard ends. The metal-frame fabric covered rudders used the same spring-controlled tab system as the elevators, and incorporated a small degree of aerodynamic balance.

===Interior===
At the front was a bow compartment containing a pound anchor and of rope for tie off the aircraft. Access was via a hatch on each side of the nose, while a smaller top hatch allowed a crewman to attach either a towing line, mooring line or anchor line to two removable vertical mooring posts. From this compartment a gangway led up to the cockpit on the upper deck. 
At the rear of the compartment there were four tube and canvas bunks for the crew that folded up into the walls of the collision bulkhead.

Behind it were two decks, an upper and a lower deck. 

====Upper deck====
On the upper deck was the flight deck, cargo hold, crew quarters, a toilet and baggage compartments. On the roof of the flight deck were two pitot tubes and a retractable spotlight.

The large flight deck was long and wide with full headroom throughout. At the front was the cockpit. The captain sat in the left and the co-pilot to the right. Between the pilots was a hatch leading down into the bow compartment.
Behind the cockpit (which could be closed off by heavy curtains at night to prevent light from the rest of the flight deck reducing the pilot&#x27;s night vision) was the flight operations room. On the left-hand side of the flight operations room was the navigator&#x27;s long chart table, followed by a small table and chair for the watch officer. On the right side was a circular staircase that led down to the lower deck. Behind this was the radio operator&#x27;s station, followed by the flight engineer&#x27;s station.

On either side of the flight operations room were oval hatches that led to the crawl spaces in the respective wings. On the rear bulkhead was the door to the cargo hold located in the center of the wing over the center of gravity. The heaviest cargo was stored here, with space left for the crew to pass through. Outside access to the cargo compartment was via a hatch in the top of the wing, the hatch also incorporating a celestial observation dome. The navigator used this dome to make sightings on the stars with a sextant. The dome&#x27;s location at the 314&#x27;s center of gravity assisted in making these sightings as steady as possible, while the red light in this compartment allowed reading of the sextant without impacting on the navigator’s night vision. If clouds prevented a reading then a straight course could be maintained by employing dead reckoning. To compensate for wind blowing the aircraft sideways the drift could be estimated by dropping a flare into the water through a small hatch in each wing root. By carefully watching the flare to see if it stayed in line with the tail of the aircraft or moved to one side or the other, the navigator could estimate the drift. 

Behind the cargo compartment was the crew quarters where the crew had the use of three tube and canvas bunks on which to sleep. Behind the upper deck&#x27;s crew quarters was an area for storage of the passengers&#x27; luggage.

====Passenger deck====
The lower deck was divided into eleven sections: five standard passenger compartments, a deluxe compartment, a dining lounge, gallery, ladies&#x27; restroom and men&#x27;s room. The aft compartments had a step between each as their floor level rose due to the curvature of the bottom of the aircraft. 

Each standard compartment could seat ten or sleep six, with four sleeping on the right (starboard) side in two upper and lower berths, while on the left (port) side there was a single upper and lower, each fitted with a privacy curtain. It took a steward 30 minutes to convert each compartment into its sleeping configuration.

The deluxe compartment, which was also known as the &quot;bridal suite&quot;, was located at the extreme rear of the deck, and contained a three-cushion davenport that could be converted into upper and lower sleeping berths. Also, there was a love seat, a coffee table, a small leather covered dressing and writing table, a beige stool, a mirror, a wardrobe and a concealed wash basin.

The ladies&#x27; restroom contained a mirror, a sink with hot and cold running water, towels, tissues, two leather upholstered swivel stools and, behind a door, a separate toilet. The men&#x27;s room had an outlet for an electric razor, while its attached toilet room had both a toilet and a urinal. Water for flushing of the toilets was from an overhead tank, with all waste flushed overboard.

The dining lounge had seating for 11 passengers during daytime with small pullout tables on which to accommodate their drinks and snacks. In the evening the furniture converted into a formal dining configuration which could seat 14 passengers at five tables, with meals served with linen tablecloths, crystal glasses, and full waiter service. Two drinking fountains were provided on each aircraft.

The square galley had a linoleum covered floor, a 12-inch (300 mm) by 10-inch (250 mm) aluminum sink, a drip coffee maker, an aluminum icebox, a combination stove and steamer, a cabinet containing a two-tiered dish rack capable of accommodating 200 fine China plates, two glass and cup racks, a saucer rack, eight drawers and a waste bin. A separate cabinet held 350 Gorham sterling-silver &quot;Moderen&quot; pattern cutlery, a silver-plated tea set, and ten pairs of sterling salt and pepper shakers. There were approximately 1,000 serving items, which weighed a total of , with typically of food carried. Valuables and passenger passports were housed in one of three lockable cabinets.

Norman Bel Geddes, who had designed the interior of Pan American’s Martin M-130, was employed to design the interior of the 314. Wherever possible, efforts were made to reduce weight. Duralumin was used in the furniture frames, and plastic in the portholes rather than glass. Lightweight carpet was used to assist in noise damping. The cushions were made of latex mixed with horsehair from Australia. Howard Ketcham, a color expert from New York assisted in the selection of colors that would complement Bel Geddes’ design and also reflect light, yet control brightness and create the impression of openness to reduce any feelings of claustrophobia. This resulted in the use of colors called Miami Sand Beige, Pan American Blue and Skyline Green. Window blinds were of an accordion pleated roller design, and manufactured by Claude D. Carver Company of New York that used a washable material called &quot;Tontine&quot;.

===Auxiliary equipment===
The aircraft’s electrical system was of the direct current type, powered by two 15 volt generators supported by two 12 volt batteries to provide both 12 volts and 24 volts. 
The 314 had an extensive suite of radio equipment, which was housed in three different locations. Normally powered by the main electrical system it could in the event of a loss of this supply be powered from a self-contained emergency generator. The radio equipment as well as other specialised equipment was provided by Pan American, with their staff at the Boeing’s factory assisting in its installation and commissioning.
The aircraft was fitted with a heating and cooling system that could deliver 360,000 BTUs per hour from manifolds around engine exhausts and 170,000 cubic feet of air per hour. The aircraft was fitted with a system that could detect any leakage of carbon dioxide from the engines into the interior of the aircraft.

===Safety features===
The aircraft had 15 different methods of exiting the aircraft in an emergency, with each passenger compartment having two. With the exception of the fuel tank hatches, all hatches on the aircraft could be opened without threatening the structural integrity of the aircraft.
Emergency equipment was stored in the nose compartment including at least two weeks of canned food for all the passengers, stored water, life rafts, and fishing and hunting tackle.
Each passenger seat had a lifejacket, with the aircraft equipped with axes, flares, ring-type life preservers and rope. There were also eight 10-person life rafts, four of which could be accessed from outside of the aircraft.
To reduce the risk of fire Boeing made efforts wherever possible to use fireproof materials in the cabins, most notably in the insulation, upholstery and wall linings.

===Service levels===
Pan American&#x27;s &quot;Clippers&quot; were built for &quot;one-class&quot; luxury air travel, a necessity given the long duration of transoceanic flights. In 1940, Pan American&#x27;s scheduled time from San Francisco to Honolulu was 19 hours, with a cruising speed of , although flights at maximum gross weight were typically flown at . Clipper service catered to elite businessmen and the wealthy traveler. The 314s had a lounge and dining area, and the galleys were crewed by chefs from four-star hotels. Men and women were provided with separate dressing rooms, and white-coated stewards served five and six-course meals with gleaming silver service. The seats could be converted into 36 bunks for overnight accommodation. The standard of luxury on Pan American&#x27;s Boeing 314s has rarely been matched on heavier-than-air transport since then. A round trip from New York to Southampton was $675 (), while a one-way ticket from San Francisco to Hong Kong via the &quot;stepping-stone&quot; islands cost $760 (). The Pan American Boeing 314 Clippers brought exotic destinations like the Far East within reach of air travelers and came to represent the romance of flight. Most of the flights were transpacific, while transatlantic flights to neutral Lisbon and Ireland continued after war broke out in Europe in September 1939 (and until 1945), but military passengers and cargoes necessarily got priority, and the service was more spartan.

===Crew===
Equally critical to the 314&#x27;s success was the proficiency of its Pan American flight crews, who were extremely skilled at long-distance, over-water flight operations and navigation. For training, many of the transpacific flights carried a second crew. Only the very best and most experienced flight crews were assigned Boeing 314 flying boat duty. Before coming aboard, all Pan American captains as well as first and second officers had thousands of hours of flight time in other seaplanes and flying boats. Rigorous training in dead reckoning, timed turns, judging drift from sea current, celestial navigation, and radio navigation were conducted. In conditions of poor or no visibility, pilots sometimes made successful landings at fogged-in harbors by landing out to sea, then taxiing the 314 into port.

The 314 normally had a crew of 10 but to address crew fatigue on long ocean flights the aircraft this could increase up to 16, divided into two shifts with a shift consisting of a pilot, co-pilot, navigator, radio operator, flight engineer, watch officer (also known as the &quot;Master&quot;) and two stewards. The stewards were always men as their work on board was considered too strenuous for women, given that bunks had to be configured for overnight flights and that in an emergency they had to be able to handle heavy large-capacity life rafts. 

===Maintenance===
Major maintenance and repairs were undertaken by manoeuvring the flying boat onto a 20 ton beaching cradle and pulling it up a ramp onto land and into a hangar. When overhauls were required, two three-story high 15-ton working platforms were wheeled into position, one for each wing, to allow access to all parts of the aircraft. Taking a year to design they each cost $10,000 and provided of working area equipped with work benches, telephones, compressed air, electricity supplies, floodlights, spare parts and on the lowest level, offices for the foreman and inspectors. At the end of the overhaul the aircraft would be subjected to a four hour test flight.
A 314 would typically spend two days between flights on an overhaul, which involved washing the aircraft, inspection, maintenance and repair. Replacement of an engine took four hours. A replacement sponson cost $24,000.

Pan American’s major maintenance facilities were located at La Guardia, New York and on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay, California.

==Operational history==


===Entry into service===
The first aircraft to be delivered was NC18602 which was christened &quot;California Clipper&quot;. This aircraft was flown on January 27, 1939 by Boeing test pilot Earl Ferguson and Wellwood Bell as co-pilot from Lake Washington to Astoria in Oregon. It was delivered to Pan American in Oregon in order to avoid a Washington state tax, which had been introduced during the Depression to increase state revenues. It was accepted by Captains Harold E. Gray and Charles Vaughn and flown by them to Pan American&#x27;s base at San Francisco. The remaining five aircraft were delivered at approximately monthly intervals, the last on June 16, 1939.

&quot;California Clipper&quot; and the former NX-18601, which was christened &quot;Honolulu Clipper&quot; were assigned to the Pacific and the other four to the Atlantic.

As with all new designs there were a number of issues which required modifications to the aircraft. As a result it wasn&#x27;t until the end of July 1939 before the 314s were able to offer a full service on the Pacific routes.

The &quot;California Clipper&quot; inaugurated the first 314 flight on the San Francisco-Hong Kong route when it departed Alameda on February 23, 1939, arriving in Hong Kong on March 3, after stops in Hawaii, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam Island, Manila, and Macao on what was 18,000 mile round trip route. On March 29, the &quot;California Clipper&quot; commenced a regular passenger and mail service on the same route. A one-way trip on this route took over six days to complete. Commercial passenger service lasted less than three years, ending when the United States entered World War II in December 1941. Passengers and their baggage were weighed, with each passenger allowed up to free baggage allowance (in the later 314 series) but then charged () for exceeding the limit.

The &quot; Yankee Clipper&quot; flew across the Atlantic on a route from Southampton to Port Washington, New York with intermediate stops at Foynes in Ireland, Botwood in Newfoundland, and Shediac, New Brunswick. The inaugural trip occurred on June 24, 1939.

===Introduction of the 314A===
Pan American had an option to purchase further 314s. Confident that the problems that had occurred with the first order had been resolved, and having found the 314 to be more reliable in service than the Martin M-130, they exercised this option, ordering six. The order was placed two days before its expiry date of 1 October 1939. Planned delivery was in 1941, with the goal of doubling the service on both Atlantic and Pacific routes by retiring its remaining two Martin 130s, and allocating six of the 314s to the Pacific and the other six to the Atlantic. 

However, the fall of France in 1940 caused some doubt about whether the Atlantic service could continue; passenger numbers were already reduced by the war, and if Spain or Portugal were to join the Axis, then the flights to Lisbon would be forced to stop. Pan American began to consider reducing its order and, in August 1940, reached an agreement to sell two of the six under construction to the United Kingdom for $1,035,400 each with an option to purchase a third if Pan American stopped its Lisbon service. This option for a third aircraft was soon exercised. The purchase of the three aircraft included 12 spare GR2600A2A engines at a cost of $16,753 each and $21,750 for 19 Hamilton propellers. The aircraft were to be operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and were primarily intended for the UK–West Africa route, as existing flying boats could not travel this route without stopping in Lisbon. The sale made a small net profit for Pan American – priced at cost plus 5% – and provided a vital communications link for Britain, but was politically controversial. In order to arrange the sale, the junior minister Harold Balfour had to agree to the contract with no government approval, leading to stern disapproval from Winston Churchill and lengthy debate by the Cabinet over the propriety of the purchase. 

Pan American provided training for BOAC staff and delivered the aircraft to La Guardia in New York, where 33 days were spent changing their registration and painting them in a new color scheme.

Churchill later flew on the &quot;Bristol&quot; and &quot;Berwick&quot; in January 1942 from Washington, D.C. to England, and he praised the plane intensely, adding to the Clippers&#x27; fame during the war.

At the outbreak of the war in the Pacific in December 1941, the &quot;Pacific Clipper&quot; was en route to New Zealand from San Francisco. Rather than risk flying back to Honolulu and being shot down by Japanese fighters, it was directed to fly west to New York City. Starting on December 8, 1941 at Auckland, New Zealand, the &quot;Pacific Clipper&quot; covered over via locations including Surabaya, Karachi, Bahrain, Khartoum and Leopoldville. The &quot;Pacific Clipper&quot; landed at Pan American&#x27;s LaGuardia Field seaplane base at 7:12 on the morning of January 6, 1942.

===Wartime service===
Following the entry of the United States into World War II in December 1941, Pan American&#x27;s fleet of 314s was requisitioned on December 14, 1941 by the American War Department, who assigned them to the United States Army and Navy. The aircraft were then leased back to Pan American for a dollar, with the understanding that all would be operated by the Navy once four-engined replacements for the Army&#x27;s four Clippers were in service. Only the markings on the aircraft changed. Since the Pan American&#x27;s civilian personnel had both extensive expertise in using flying boats for extreme long-distance over-water flights and in maintaining them, they continued to be flown and maintained by the company. 

The Army gave the aircraft the designation C-98, but the Navy—which used a different designation system at the time—disregarded this designation and operated the aircraft under the company designation B-314. 

Throughout the war the flying boats were employed to transport high-priority passengers (such as high ranking officers, scientists, war correspondents and USO entertainers), mail and vital military cargo on long distance international routes to the European and Pacific fronts, and to Africa. On outbound flights, the cargo could be as important as vital blood plasma, medical supplies, while on the return they could be vital materials such as beryllium, mica, and raw rubber. The 314 was then the only aircraft in the world that could make the crossing over the South Atlantic. This allowed passengers and military cargo to be carried via Natal, Brazil to Liberia, to connect with the British forces in Egypt and even the Soviets, via the Persian Corridor. 

In February 1942, forty women were hired by Pan American to replace male mechanics in the hangars at LaGuardia to perform service, repair and overhaul of the Clippers for the European service. Maintenance demands were such that it took &quot;141 mechanics, working three 8-hour shifts, to perform in two days the complete inspection of servicing routine which must be carried out before a Clipper just in from Europe can be sent on the return trip.&quot; In January 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt traveled most of the way to and from the Casablanca Conference in a Pan-Am crewed &quot;Dixie Clipper&quot;.

While attempting to land at Cabo Ruivo Seaplane Base, in Lisbon, Portugal on February 22, 1943 the &quot; Yankee Clipper&quot; NC18603 crashed killing four passengers and crew. Among that flight&#x27;s passengers were prominent American author and war correspondent Benjamin Robertson, who was killed, and the American singer and actress Jane Froman, who was seriously injured.

From the time of America&#x27;s entry into World War II in December 1941 through to October 31, 1944, the Pan American 314s flew 9.9 million miles during which they carried 72,621 passengers completing 1,299 flights over the Pacific and 1,595 crossings of the Atlantic.

===Immediate post war===
Following the end of the war, the Clippers though still owned by the American government, were still being used by Pan American to transport civilian passengers up until their last scheduled service on April 8-9, 1946, when the &quot;American Clipper&quot; flew from Honolulu to San Francisco. They were then offered to Pan American by the War Assets Administration (WAA) at an asking price of $50,000 each.

The last Pan American 314 to be retired, the &quot;California Clipper&quot; NC18602 had accumulated more than a million flight miles by 1946. Of the 12 Boeing 314 Clippers built, three were lost to accidents, although only one of those resulted in fatalities, the loss of &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot;.

By this point, the 314s operated by Pan American had each accumulated more than 18,000 flight hours, and together had completed approximately 5,000 ocean crossings and flown more than 12.5 million miles. However, even before hostilities had ended, the 314 had become obsolete, which was recognised by Pan American, and they declined to take up the option to purchase them. The flying boat&#x27;s advantage had been that it did not require long concrete runways, but during the war many such runways had been built for heavy bombers. New long-range airliners such as the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-4 were not only faster but relatively easy to fly, and did not require the extensive pilot training programs mandated for flying boat operations. One of the 314&#x27;s most experienced pilots said, &quot;We were indeed glad to change to DC-4s, and I argued daily for eliminating all flying boats. The landplanes were much safer. No one in the operations department... had any idea of the hazards of flying boat operations. The main problem now was lack of the very high level of experience and competence required of seaplane pilots.&quot;

That last flight by the &quot;American Clipper&quot; had carried 24 passengers and taken 16 hours and 39 minutes, compared with a Lockheed L-049 on that same day transporting 42 passengers, and taking nine hours and nine minutes to cover the same route.

After being taken out of service &quot;Anzac Clipper&quot;, &quot;Atlantic Clipper&quot;, &quot;Capetown Clipper&quot; and &quot;Pacific Clipper&quot; were stored at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn and were advertised for sale by the WAA at the end of January 1946. &quot;California Clipper&quot; and &quot;Dixie Clipper&quot; were stored at Alameda near San Francisco and were soon joined by &quot;American Clipper&quot; and &quot;Atlantic Clipper&quot;, with these four also being offered for sale in April 1946. All seven were offered for sale with a large quantity of spare parts, including engines, instruments and servicing equipment.”

The four Alameda-stored aircraft were flown south to the milder weather conditions of San Diego which would reduce the deterioration from corrosion. Initially they were anchored in the bay; once their beaching cradles arrived, they were moved out of the water onto the seaplane ramp at the Convair facility at Lindbergh Field in San Diego.

===Universal Airlines===
All seven WAA owned aircraft were purchased for $325,000 by Universal Airlines, a non-scheduled carrier and mortgaged to the brokerage firm General Phoenix Corporation of Baltimore. By the time of the sale, the wing tip of the &quot;Pacific Clipper&quot; had been badly damaged in a windstorm; as it was unflyable, it was intended that it would be used for parts. At the time, the airline was flying passengers and cargo between New York City, Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Within a year the airline was in financial trouble, and was declared bankrupt on May 28, 1947.

With the &quot;Pacific Clipper&quot; by now broken down into parts the six remaining aircraft were purchased in a bankruptcy auction in 1947 by American International Airways of New York for $500,000. Being a registered contract air carrier, they could only charter out the planes to other airlines. They completely overhauled and refurbished the &quot;Capetown Clipper&quot;, which they renamed &quot;Bermuda Sky Queen&quot;. While on a leased flight from the United Kingdom strong headwinds forced it to put down in the North Atlantic Ocean on October 14, 1947. After being badly damaged while an attempt was made by the U.S. Coast Guard to tow her, she was sunk by gunfire. The loss of the &quot;Bermuda Sky Queen&quot; resulted in American-International Airways losing their operating license. When this occurred, the &quot;Anzac Clipper&quot; was still on the east coast, while the other four were still in San Diego.

===BOAC===
Separately, BOAC following the end of the war had removed the camouflage paint from its three 314s in July 1945, and continued to use them to provide a transatlantic service until &quot;Bristol&quot; made its last crossing on March 7, 1946, with &quot;Bangor&quot; and &quot;Berwick&quot; being used to provide a twice-weekly service between Baltimore, Maryland and Darrell&#x27;s Island in Bermuda. This was maintained up until January 27, 1948, when &quot;Bristol&quot;, with 55 passengers on board, flew the final flight before they were withdrawn from service. During their six and a half years of service with BOAC, the 314s had flown 4,250,000 miles while carrying 40,042 passengers. They were replaced on the route by Lockheed Constellations flying from New York and Baltimore to Bermuda.

All three were then sold to the aircraft brokerage firm General Phoenix Corporation of Baltimore on April 29, 1948, which stored on their beaching cradles at Harbor Field in Baltimore.

===World Airways===
The former owner of American International Airways, J. Stuart Robinson who was by now president of start-up airline World Airways using the insurance money he had received from the loss of &quot;Bermuda Sky Queen&quot; to purchase the three BOAC 314s for $6,949.74 each in April 1948. He then raised a mortgage from the General Phoenix Corporation, which he used to purchase the &quot;American Clipper&quot;, &quot;Anzac Clipper&quot;, &quot;Atlantic Clipper&quot; &quot;California Clipper&quot; and &quot;Dixie Clipper&quot;. As a result by 1948 World Airways now owned all of the remaining Clippers. The General Phoenix Corporation gave permission for &quot;Anzac Clipper&quot;, &quot;American Clipper&quot; and &quot;Dixie Clipper&quot; to be dismantled for parts to keep the other aircraft flying on routes along the eastern seaboard between New York and San Juan. At some point after this NC18606 &quot;American Clipper&quot; had been transferred to Harbor Field in Baltimore where by April 1950 it was being dismantled to be sold for scrap.
By early 1949, World Airways was bankrupt, leaving the &quot;Bangor&quot;, &quot;Berwick&quot; and &quot;Bristol&quot; in Baltimore, while the &quot;Atlantic Clipper&quot; &quot;California Clipper&quot; and &quot;Dixie Clipper&quot; were still in San Diego. 
Robinson had meanwhile approved the dismantling of &quot;Berwick&quot;, with its remains sold for scrap in late 1949 to Baltimore’s Tomke Aluminum Co. Separately he had sold the &quot;Bangor&quot; and &quot;Bristol&quot; to the Baltimore Lumber Company, who it is believed intended to use them as fire-fighting aircraft. When this failed to materialize, they sold the &quot;Bangor&quot; for $2,000 to the Tomke Aluminum Company for scrap, producing of metal. Tomke also purchased &quot;Bristol&quot; which they believe could be made flyable. They sold it in 1950 to Jesse Lee Boland who anchored it in Baltimore Harbour while he and his sons began refurbishing it. During a storm on 7 April 1951 the &quot;Bristol&quot; broke free from its moorings and sunk in of water, half a mile off Harbor Field. Boland rejected a quote of $20,000 from a salvage company to raise it and attempted to do it himself. He eventually abandoned the aircraft and it was declared to be derelict by harbour officials, who arranged for it to be raised and scrapped. The &quot;Bristol&quot; had been the last 314 to fly on January 27, 1948.

Meanwhile, within a year World Airways had been reorganized under new ownership and was still the registered owner of NC18604&quot;Atlantic Clipper&quot;, NC18602 &quot;California Clipper&quot; and NC18605&quot;Dixie Clipper&quot;, though with General Phoenix Corporation still having a mortgage over the aircraft. They were reports of them still being at Lindbergh Field on San Diego as late as 1951, before they were eventually scrapped.

==Variants==
;Model 314
:Initial production version with GR2600A2 Twin Cyclone engines, six built for Pan American at an average of $668,908 at a time when a DC-3 cost $115,000. In addition, Pan American purchased $756,450 of spares. 
;Model 314A
This improved version featured:
* An increased gross take-off weight of , an increase of . Following reinforcement of their airframes the earlier 314s were also cleared to have this higher take-off weight.
* An improved engines, the GR2600A2A which gave more power and which drove larger diameter propellers with a improved blade design.
* The step on the bottom of the hull was moved further back to prevent the porpoising that had troubled the 314.
* An increase in fuel capacity from 4,200 gallons to 5,448 gallons. This offered improved security on more turbulent winter flights. This improvement was retrofitted to the original 314s. 
* The oil capacity was decreased from 206 to 300 gallons due to the use of more efficient hopper oil tanks, which as well as reducing the oil load, improved cold weather engine starting.
* A revised interior.
* The 314A dispensed with the recessed steps that led up the side of the nose.

Each 314A cost Pan American $800,000.

===Military designations===
Those pressed into service with the U.S. military were given the following designations:
;B-314
:Five Model 314s who served with the U.S. Navy.
;C-98
:Four Model 314s who served with the U.S. Army Air Forces.

==Operators==

* Universal Airlines
* American International Airways
* World Airways
* British Overseas Airways Corporation


==Surviving aircraft==
None of the dozen 314s built between 1939 and 1941 survived beyond 1951, with all 12 being cannibalized for parts, scuttled, scrapped, or otherwise written off. Underwater Admiralty Sciences, a non-profit oceanographic exploration and science research organization based in Kirkland, Washington, announced in 2005, at the 70th Anniversary of the first &quot;China Clipper&quot; flight in San Francisco, its plans to survey, photograph, and possibly recover the remains of the hulls of two sunken 314s: NC18601 (&quot;Honolulu Clipper&quot;), scuttled in the Pacific Ocean in 1945; and NC18612 (&quot;Bermuda Sky Queen&quot;, formerly &quot;Cape Town Clipper&quot;), sunk in the Atlantic by the Coast Guard in 1947. UAS has also spent significant time at Pan American reunions and with individual crewmembers and employees of Pan American conducting videotaped interviews for the mission&#x27;s companion documentary. However, as of 2014, no search or recovery had been attempted, with the most recent news from 2011 suggesting that the company was still in need of at least US$8 million to get the plan under way.

There is a life-size 314 mockup at the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, Foynes, County Limerick, Ireland, located on the site of the original transatlantic flying-boat terminus.

==Specifications (314A Clipper)==

==Cultural influence==
Inspired by the airplane, Smith Corona designed, manufactured, and marketed a typewriter model it called the &quot;Clipper&quot; from 1945–1960. The logo prominently featured the Boeing 314 Clipper on the typewriter&#x27;s body which served as a reminder of the luxury and design of the original airplane.

<text>Lutsk (, ; see below for other names) is a city on the Styr River in northwestern Ukraine. It is the administrative center of Volyn Oblast and the administrative center of Lutsk Raion within the oblast. Lutsk has a population of Historically it was a cultural and religious center in Volhynia.

==Names and etymology==
Lutsk is an ancient Slavic town, mentioned in the Hypatian Chronicle as Luchesk in the records of 1085. The etymology of the name is unclear. There are three hypotheses: the name may have been derived from the Old Slavic word &quot;luka&quot; (an arc or bend in a river), or the name may have originated from &quot;Luka&quot; (the chieftain of the &quot;Dulebs&quot;), an ancient Slavic tribe living in this area. The name may also have been created after &quot;Luchanii&quot; (Luchans), an ancient branch of the tribe mentioned above.

The city of Lutsk is also historically known by different names in other languages – , ; ; as well as a number of other names.

==History==
According to the legend, Luchesk dates from the 7th century. The first known documentary reference dates were from the year 1085. In the 11th century, along with the region of Volhynia, the town was contested by the Kyivan Rus&#x27; and Poland. The town served as the capital of the Principality of Halych-Volynia (founded in 1199) until the rise of Volodymyr. The town grew around a wooden stronghold built by a local branch of the Rurik Dynasty. At certain times the location functioned as the capital of the principality, but the town did not become an important centre of commerce or culture. 

===Grand Duchy of Lithuania===
In 1240, Mongols seized and looted the nearby town but left the castle unharmed. In 1321, George, son of Lev, the last prospective heir of Halych-Volynia, died in a battle with the forces of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and Lithuanian forces seized the castle. In 1349, the forces of King Casimir III of Poland captured the town, then Lithuania soon retook it, but it remained contested by Lithuania and Poland until 1382.
The town began to prosper during the period of Lithuanian rule. Prince Lubart (died 1384), son of Gediminas, erected Lubart&#x27;s Castle as part of his fortification programme. From 1385, it was part of the Polish-Lithuanian union, yet it remained an object of Lithuanian-Polish rivalry. Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło appointed Polish starosts, brought in Dominican monks and staffed the Catholic bishopric, intending to connect it to the Polish Archdiocese of Lwów, while Lithuanian Duke Vytautas sought to diminish Polish influence and develop the city to become Lithuania&#x27;s second capital after Vilnius. Vytautas invited colonists (mostly Jews, Tatars, and Crimean Karaites). In 1427 he transferred the Catholic bishopric from Volodymyr to Luchesk. Vytautas was the last monarch to use the title of &quot;Duke of Volhynia&quot; and to reside in Lubart&#x27;s Castle. 

The town grew rapidly, and by the end of the 15th century, there were 19 Orthodox and two Catholic churches. It was the seat of two Christian bishops, one Catholic and one Orthodox. Because of that, the town was sometimes nicknamed &quot;the &quot;Volhynian Rome&quot;.&quot; The cross symbol of Lutsk features the highest Lithuanian Presidential award, the Order of Vytautas the Great.

In 1429 Lutsk was the meeting place selected for a conference of monarchs hosted by Władysław II Jagiełło and Sophia of Halshany to deal with the Tatar threat. Those invited to attend included Sigismund, King of Hungary and Bohemia; Grand Duke Vasili II of Russia; Eric of Pomerania, king of Denmark, Norway and Sweden; the Grand Master of the Livonian Order Zisse von Rutenberg; the Duke of Szczecin Kazimierz V; Dan II, the &quot;Hospodar&quot; of Wallachia; and Prince-electors of most of the countries of the Holy Roman Empire.

===Kingdom of Poland===
In 1432, Volhynia became a fief of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and Lutsk became the seat of the governors, and later the Marshalls of the Land of Volhynia. That same year, the city was granted Magdeburg rights by King Władysław II Jagiełło. It was one of the minor centers of Armenians in Poland, with an Armenian church. In 1497, Alexander Jagiellon confirmed the city&#x27;s old privileges. In 1569, Volhynia was fully incorporated into the Polish kingdom and the town became the capital of both the Łuck powiat and Volhynian Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province. After the Union of Lublin, the local Orthodox bishop converted to Eastern Catholicism.

The city continued to prosper as an important economic centre of the region. By the mid-17th century, Łuck had approximately 50,000 inhabitants and was one of the largest towns in the area. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the town was seized by the forces of Colonel Kolodko. Up to 4,000 people were slaughtered, approximately 35,000 fled, and the city was looted and partially burnt. It never fully recovered. In 1781, the city was struck by a fire which destroyed 440 houses, both cathedrals, and several other churches. In 1788, Łuck was the 25th largest city of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The city embraced the Constitution of 3 May 1791.

===Russian Empire===
In 1795, as a result of the Third Partition of Poland, the Russian Empire annexed Lutsk. The Voivodeship was liquidated and the town lost its significance as the capital of the province (which was moved to Zhytomyr). After the November Uprising (1830–1831), efforts increased to remove Polish influence. Polish schools were closed in 1831 and Catholic monasteries were seized in 1840–1853. Russian became the dominant language in official circles. Though, the Ukrainian population continued to speak Ukrainian; the Polish population spoke Polish; and the Jewish population spoke Yiddish (only in private circles). The Greek Catholic churches was turned into Orthodox Christian ones, which led to the self-liquidation of the Uniates here. In 1845, another great fire struck the city, resulting in further depopulation.

In 1850, three major forts were built around Lutsk, and the town became a small fortress called &quot;Mikhailogorod&quot;. Neglected under Russian rule, by the late 19th century, the city lost its leading economic position in Volhynia to Rivne, Kovel and Zdolbuniv.
During the First World War, the town was seized by Austria-Hungary on 29 August 1915. The town sustained a small amount of damage. During more than a year of Austro-Hungarian occupation, Lutsk became an important military centre with the headquarters of the IV Army under Archduke Josef Ferdinand stationed there. A plague of epidemic typhus decimated the city&#x27;s inhabitants.

On 4 June 1916, four Russian armies under general Aleksei Brusilov started what later became known as the Brusilov Offensive. After up to three days of heavy artillery barrage, the Battle of Lutsk began. On 7 June 1916 the Russian forces reconquered the city. After the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1917, the city was seized by Germany on 7 February 1918. On 22 February 1918 the town was transferred by the withdrawing German army to the forces loyal to Symon Petlura.

===Second Polish Republic===
During the Polish-Bolshevik War, on 16 May 1919, Lutsk was taken over by the forces of Poland&#x27;s Blue Army after a heavy battle with the Red Army. The city was devastated and largely depopulated. It witnessed the Soviet counter-offensive of 1920 and was taken on 12 July 1920. It was recaptured by Poland&#x27;s 45th Rifles regiment and field artillery on 15 September 1920. According to American sociologist Alexander Gella &quot;the Polish victory [over the Red Army] had gained twenty years of independence not only for Poland but at least for an entire central part of Europe. Łuck was designated by the newly-reborn nation of Poland as the capital of the Wołyń Voivodeship.
The city was connected by railroad to Lviv (then Lwów) and Przemyśl. Several brand new factories were built both in Łuck and on its outskirts producing farming equipment, wood, and leather products among other consumer goods. New mills and breweries opened. An orphanage was built, and a big new bursary. The first high school was soon inaugurated. In 1937, an airport was established in Łuck with an area of . 

The 13th &quot;Kresowy&quot; Light Artillery Regiment was stationed in the city, together with a &quot;Łuck&quot; National Defense (Poland) Battalion. In 1938, construction of a large modern radio transmitter began in the city (see Polish Radio Łuck). As of 1 January 1939 Łuck had 39,000 inhabitants (approximately 17,500 Jews and 13,500 Poles). The powiat formed around the town had 316,970 inhabitants, including 59% Ukrainians, 19.5% Poles, 14% Jews and approximately 23,000 Czechs and Germans.

===World War II===

On Thursday 7 September 1939, at about 5 p.m., the Polish government, which had left Warsaw the day before, arrived at Łuck. German intelligence quickly found out about it, and the city was twice bombed by the Luftwaffe, on 11 and 14 September. After panzer units of the Wehrmacht had crossed the Bug river, on 14 September the government of Poland left Łuck and headed southwards, to Kosów Huculski, which at that time was located near the Polish–Romanian border.

As a result of the invasion of Poland from both sides and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Łuck, along with the rest of western Volyn, was annexed by the Soviet Union. Most of the factories (including the almost-finished radio station) were dismantled and sent east to Russia. Approximately 10,000 of the city&#x27;s Polish inhabitants (chiefly ethnic Poles, but also Polish Jews) were deported in cattle trucks to Kazakhstan and 1,550 were arrested by the NKVD.
After the start of Operation Barbarossa the city was captured by the Wehrmacht on 25 June 1941. Thousands of Polish and Ukrainian prisoners were shot by the retreating NKVD responsible for political prisons. The inmates were offered amnesty and in the morning of ordered to exit the building en masse. They were gunned down by Soviet tanks. Some 4,000 captives including Poles, Jews and Ukrainians were massacred. 

Upon Nazi occupation, most of the Jewish inhabitants of the city were forced into a new Łuck Ghetto and then murdered at the execution site on Górka Połonka hill not far from the city. In total, more than 25,000 Jews were executed there at point-blank range, men, women and children. The Łuck Ghetto was liquidated entirely through &quot;the Holocaust by bullets&quot;. In 1941–1942, the German occupiers also operated a forced labour camp for Jews in the city. During the massacres of Poles in Volhynia approximately 10,000 Poles were murdered by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the area. It was captured by the Red Army on 2 February 1944.

===Postwar===

After the end of the war, the remaining Polish inhabitants of the city were expelled, mostly to the areas that are sometimes referred to as the Polish Regained Territories. The city became an industrial centre in the Ukrainian SSR. The major changes in the city&#x27;s demographics had the final result that by the end of the war, the city was almost entirely Ukrainian. During the Cold War, the city hosted the Lutsk air base.

As one of the largest cities in western Ukraine, Lutsk became the seat of the General Consulate of Poland in 2003.

On 21 July 2020, a hostage crisis took place, involving a man armed with a firearm and explosives who stormed a bus and took 16 people hostage at about 9:25 a.m. Police said that they had identified the hostage-taker and that he had expressed dissatisfaction with &quot;Ukraine&#x27;s system&quot; on social media. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that shots gas had been heard and that the bus had been damaged. The incident led to police blocking off the city centre. The standoff was eventually resolved after several hours, with all of the hostages being freed and the hostage taker being arrested.

On 11 March 2022, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian army fired four missiles at Lutsk military airfield killing two Ukrainian servicemen and wounding six. On 28 March, Lutsk was struck by another Russian missile.

<text>Port Melbourne is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-west of the Melbourne central business district, located within the Cities of Melbourne and Port Phillip local government areas. Port Melbourne recorded a population of 17,633 at the 2021 census.

The area to the north of the West Gate Freeway is located within the City of Melbourne, with The area to the south located within the City of Port Phillip. The suburb is bordered by the shores of Hobsons Bay and the lower reaches of the Yarra River. Port Melbourne covers a large area, which includes the distinct localities of Fishermans Bend, Garden City and Beacon Cove.

Historically it was known as Sandridge and developed as the city&#x27;s second port, linked to the nearby Melbourne CBD.

The formerly industrial Port Melbourne has been subject to intense urban renewal over the past three decades. As a result, Port Melbourne is a diverse and historic area, featuring industrial and port areas along the Yarra, to open parklands, bayside beaches, exclusive apartments and Bay Street&#x27;s restaurants and cafes. The suburb also forms a major transport link from east to west, home to one end of the West Gate Bridge.

==History==


The most prominent early resident of the area now known as Port Melbourne was Captain Wilbraham Frederick Evelyn Liardet, who arrived in 1839 and established a hotel, jetty, and mail service. Liardet later stated that before his arrival the surveyor William Wedge Darke and his family had camped on the beach in their two roomed, carpeted wooden caravan known as &#x27;Darke&#x27;s Ark&#x27;. Liardet credited Wedge with cutting the first track to the beach through the tea tree scrub and hoisting a barrel on a pole, on a high section of ground, to point the way back to the Melbourne settlement. From this signpost its first official name, &#x27;Sandridge&#x27;, was said to have originated. The area also became commonly known as &#x27;Liardet&#x27;s Beach&#x27; but Liardet himself was said to have preferred &#x27;Brighton&#x27;. It became Port Melbourne in 1884.

The area came into prominence during the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s. With an increasing number of ships looking to berth, Sandridge became a thriving transport hub. To alleviate the high costs of shipping goods via small vessels up the Yarra River to Melbourne the Port Melbourne railway line was built in 1854 to connect Sandridge to Melbourne. The disused Sandridge Bridge takes its name from this historic railway line.

In 1860, Port Melbourne was an early area of Victoria to gain Municipal status with the Sandridge Borough, which later became the City of Port Melbourne.

In the early years of Port Melbourne, the suburb was separated from neighbouring Albert Park by a large shallow lagoon. This was gradually filled in over the years, with the last of it completed in 1929. Today the area is largely covered by the eponymous Lagoon Reserve, a public park to the east of the Esplanade between Liardet Street and Graham Street, although the original extent of the lagoon was much greater.

As a transport hub, Port Melbourne had numerous hotels. Early industries included a sugar refining, soap production, candle works, chemical works, rice and flour mills, gasworks, a distillery and a boot factory. Station and Princes Piers were major places of arrival to Australia for immigrants prior to the availability of affordable air travel.

For many years Port Melbourne was a focus of Melbourne&#x27;s criminal underworld, which operated smuggling syndicates on the docks. The old Ships Painters and Dockers Union was notorious for being controlled by gangsters. The Waterside Workers Federation, on the other hand, was a stronghold of the Communist Party of Australia.

With the amalgamation of the local Council into the City of Port Phillip in 1994, many of Port Melbourne&#x27;s civic institutions were adaptively reused. As a result, the Port Melbourne Town Hall is now a public library.

As the importance of the Port has declined, and as manufacturing industries have moved out of the inner city area, Port Melbourne has increasingly become a residential suburb. The area where Port Melbourne originally developed, around Station Pier and Princes Pier, has been redeveloped with a mixture of apartment complexes and medium-density housing, the best known of which is the Beacon Cove development.

==Demographics==

In the 2016 census, there were 16,175 people in Port Melbourne. 63.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 5.4%, New Zealand 2.6%, Greece 2.0%, United States of America 1.0% and Italy 1.0%. 72.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek 4.8%, Italian 1.7%, Mandarin 1.3%, French 0.8% and Russian 0.8%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 38.3% and Catholic 21.8%.

==Transport==
===Road===
Two major freeways run through Port Melbourne; the West Gate Freeway, which runs east–west from the West Gate Bridge and CityLink, which runs north toward the Bolte Bridge. Other main roads include Bay Street, Williamstown Road, Lorimer Street (which runs along the Yarra River), Graham Street, Salmon Street, Ingles Street and Beach Street (which runs toward Beaconsfield Parade and St Kilda). Port Melbourne&#x27;s roads are a mix of planning styles and as a result can be difficult to navigate.

Port Melbourne is serviced by an extensive bus network operated by CDC Melbourne which connects it to Melbourne CBD and surrounding suburbs.

===Rail===

Port Melbourne is serviced by Melbourne tram route 109, which has been run as a high patronage high frequency light rail service since the heavy rail line was converted to light rail in 1987. While there are several disused freight rail links, the light rail is the only used rail connection to Port Melbourne. There have been a number of proposals for tram and light rail extension in Port Melbourne.

St Kilda-Port Melbourne link

A five kilometre tram link between St Kilda and Port Melbourne along Beaconsfield Parade was first raised by the City of Port Phillip in 2005. The City of Port Phillip&#x27;s 2007 feasibility study into the route found that the high density population could sustain around 200,000 annual commuter trips and that the link would be financially viable if tourists were charged $6 per one-way trip.

To address residents concerns over possible loss of beachfront views, the Council investigated the possibility of a new high-tech line, involving wire-free operation. Critics argued that it would be duplicating the route 12 tram route, with the two routes running in parallel just 200 metres apart for about 2 kilometres along Beaconsfield Parade. However, a direct tram journey between St Kilda and Port Melbourne is not possible and currently requires a change of routes at Southbank, which is a 10-kilometre round trip.

===Port===

Today, Port Melbourne still serves as a transport hub for passenger and cargo vessels. Many luxury liners, naval vessels and ferries arrive at Station Pier. Cargo traffic takes place further west, near the mouth of the Yarra River, principally at Webb Dock.

==Housing==
Houses in Port Melbourne range from single-fronted Victorian timber worker&#x27;s cottages to new apartments and housing developments. Port Melbourne has undergone a major demographic shift in the past twenty years, from one of the cheapest and poorest suburbs in the city to one of the most expensive and wealthiest. Many large apartment developments in Port Melbourne occupy large blocks of land, taking over large factories and warehouses, such as HM@S project in Beach Street, ID Apartments in Pickles and Rouse Streets, and Bayshore and Bayview Apartments in Bay Street. Each of these developments comprise multiple buildings, and many of the redevelopments have preserved the heritage buildings. The Port Melbourne population now combines significant numbers of wealthy people, with those who live in public housing and other &quot;old Port&quot; locales. The area has many residents whose families came from Greece in the 1940s and 1950s, as well as more recent arrivals from Africa and Asia.

==Commerce==
Bay Street is Port Melbourne&#x27;s main and historic commercial area.

Toyota Australia&#x27;s Head Office is in Port Melbourne.

The Maritime Union of Australia maintains a strong presence in the area.

===Trugo===
There are two clubs for the indigenous casual game of trugo in Melbourne: the Port Melbourne Trugo Club and the Sandridge Trugo Club.

==Localities within Port Melbourne==

Port Melbourne features three distinctive localities, with identities separated from the main section of the neighbourhood.
===Garden City===
Garden City is a locality within Port Melbourne and the City of Port Phillip. It started in the 1920s as a planned &quot;garden suburb&quot;, similar to those built in Britain a few years earlier during the Garden City Movement. The early development was built as low-cost housing by the State Bank, with later additions of public housing by the Housing Commission of Victoria. It comprises semi-attached single and double-storey houses arranged around a series of public open spaces, in a distorted Beaux-Arts layout. Contrary to popular belief, the &quot;Bank Houses&quot; were never public housing and have always been in private hands. The &quot;Bank Houses&quot; area later became known as &quot;nobs hill&quot;, a reference to relative wealth of their occupants compared to the residents of the clinker brick public housing that was added later. The Housing Commission area was known as &#x27;Little Baghdad&#x27;.

The Garden City post office in Centre Avenue has been open since 1945. ()

===Beacon Cove===

Beacon Cove is a locality within Port Melbourne and the City of Port Phillip. It comprises approximately 1100 dwellings in a mixture of low-rise medium density and high-rise housing, with a small supermarket, some commercial space, a small number of cafes and restaurants and a leisure complex including a gym, swimming pool and tennis courts. It was developed over the decade from 1996 by Australian developer Mirvac, following the collapse of the &quot;Sandridge City&quot; scheme for a gated community featuring canalside housing. The site was formerly an industrial facility. Beacon Cove features a waterfront promenade, palm-lined boulevards and a layout that allows the retention of two operational shipping beacons. Most of the low-rise housing is arranged around a series of small parks, in a postmodern scaled-down Beaux-Arts plan, similar in layout to nearby St Vincent Gardens in Albert Park. Along the foreshore is a series of 11–14-storey high-rise apartment towers with a small amount of very upmarket low-rise housing at the western end, directly fronting Sandridge Beach. The layout re-routed Beach Street away from the foreshore and the apartments along the waterfront have direct access to the promenade. The development was completed in stages, working west from Princes Street, and this is reflected in the different styles of architecture.
As of 2013 the owner of the leisure complex has proposed replacing it with a 19-storey apartment complex, and the City of Port Phillip has instead proposed rezoning the site for mixed use with a 10-storey height limit. A number of community groups oppose both proposals.

===Fishermans Bend===

Fishermans Bend (formerly Fishermen&#x27;s Bend) is a locality within Port Melbourne and the City of Melbourne. It is positioned immediately to the east of the West Gate Bridge, on the south bank of the Yarra River, adjacent to the suburb of Port Melbourne and opposite Coode Island, on the north shore of the Yarra River.

Fishermans Bend originally included the area now known as Garden City, which was renamed in 1929.

From the 1850s, the site was a location for Bay fishermen of European descent. Some thirty families lived on the Bend, frequently finding additional work in the docks and cargo ships; ballast was loaded onto ships returning to Europe. Habitation was in rough shacks along the Bend, made from corrugated iron, flattened kerosene tins or wood. There were no roads, shops, or sewerage. Water was collected from hanging out sail canvases, and stored in iron tanks or casks milk came from a nearby farm. Fishing continues on the Bay, but today only two fishing licences belong to descendants of these early pioneer settlers. The last remaining shack on the Bend was demolished in 1970, to make way for Webb Dock. The new Surf Life Saving Club headquarters stand on the site (Meiers 2006).

The neighbourhood of Fishermans Bend also has a significant place in Australian aviation history, being the home of several prominent historical Australian aircraft design and manufacturing companies, including the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, Holden, Smorgon Steel, Government Aircraft Factories, the Aeronautical Research Laboratory and regional facilities for Boeing. Fishermen&#x27;s Bend Aerodrome remained in use until 1957.

Fishermans Bend is a primary industrial centre at the foot of the West Gate Bridge and contains major establishments for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Holden, Hawker de Havilland, GKN Aerospace Engineering Services, the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures, Kraft Foods, Toyota Australia, port security and a campus of RMIT University.

It also has a marina, known as d&#x27;Albora Marinas Pier 35, and several container ship ports.

Fishermans Bend has a single large reserve known as Westgate Park, a large artificial wetland established in 1985.

<doc id="510158" wikidata="Q441499" url="?curid=510158" title="Parts of Lindsey">
<text>The Parts of Lindsey are a traditional division of Lincolnshire, England, covering the northern part of the county. The Isle of Axholme, which is on the west side of the River Trent, has normally formed part of it. The district&#x27;s name originated from the Kingdom of Lindsey of Anglo-Saxon times, whose territories were merged with that of Stamford to form Lincolnshire.

As with the other historic divisions of Lincolnshire, Lindsey is no longer a local government unit, although its name survives in that of two districts of the county council area Lincolnshire (East and West Lindsey), and it is still recognised as a geographical area.

==Local government==
When the English shires were established, Lindsey became part of Lincolnshire. It, and each of Kesteven and Holland, acquired the formal designation of Parts of Lincolnshire. Thus it became the Parts of Lindsey.

Lindsey was itself divided into three ridings: the North, West and South Ridings, which in turn were divided into wapentakes. The West Riding covered the western part, including Gainsborough, Scunthorpe and Spital. The North Riding covered the north-east, including Barton upon Humber, Caistor, Cleethorpes, Brigg, Grimsby and Market Rasen. The South Riding covered the rest, in the south-east, including Louth, Mablethorpe and Skegness. The point at which the Ridings all touched was somewhere near Lissington.

Lindsey, like the other parts of Lincolnshire, had long had a separate county administration (Quarter Sessions). In 1889, this division was followed in the establishment of the administrative county of Lincolnshire, Parts of Lindsey, which had an elected county council. Lincoln and Grimsby were independent county boroughs.

Within the rest of Lindsey there were various urban districts and rural districts, established by the Local Government Act 1894. The rural districts were Caistor, Gainsborough, Glanford Brigg, Grimsby, Horncastle, Isle of Axholme, Louth, Spilsby, Welton. A rural district of Sibsey also existed until 1936, when it was merged into Spilsby.

The administrative county of Parts of Lindsey was abolished on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972. Its area was divided between two new non-metropolitan counties: the northern area of Lindsey was placed in Humberside while the remainder passed to Lincolnshire. In 1996 the unpopular decision was all but reversed, in that Lincolnshire status was reinstated for the areas that had become South Humberside, however the Lindsey name was not.

Lindsey was divided between six non-metropolitan districts, as follows

===Present authorities===

In 1996 the Humberside districts were re-grouped into unitary authorities; units which performed the duties of both county and administrative district. One is North Lincolnshire (centred on Scunthorpe). This comprises the former districts of Glanford and Scunthorpe, as well as the Isle of Axholme which formed the southern part of Boothferry district. The second is North East Lincolnshire, comprising the former districts of Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes. The two unitary authorities represent the most urbanised part of traditional Lincolnshire.

The remaining parts of Lindsey largely correspond to the 1974 Lincolnshire County Council districts of West Lindsey and East Lindsey.

<text>Jean-Baptiste-Louis Gresset (August 29, 1709 – June 16, 1777) was a French poet and dramatist, best known for his poem &quot;Vert-Vert&quot;.

==Life==
Gresset was born at Amiens. During the last twenty-five years of his life, he regretted the frivolity of his youth, which enabled him to produce his most famous poem. He was brought up by the Jesuits of Amiens. Accepted as a novice at the age of seventeen, he was sent to study at the Collège Louis le Grand in Paris. After completing his course he was appointed, at the age of nineteen, to a post as assistant master in a college at Rouen.

Gresset published &quot;Vert-Vert&quot; at Rouen in 1734. It is the humorous story of a parrot, the delight of a convent whose talk was all of prayers and pious ambitions, and how it was conveyed to another convent as a visitor to please the nuns. On the way it falls among bad companions, forgets its convent language, and shocks the sisters on arrival by profane swearing. It is sent back in disgrace, punished by solitude and plain bread, repents, reforms and is finally killed by kindness. The treatment of the subject, the atmosphere which surrounds it, and the delicacy with which the little prattling ways of the nuns, their jealousies and trifling concerns, are presented, takes the reader entirely by surprise. The poem stands absolutely unrivalled, even among French &quot;contes en vers&quot;.

Gresset, now famous, left Rouen for Paris, where he found refuge in the same garret which had sheltered him when a boy at the Collège Louis le Grand, and there wrote his second poem, &quot;La Chartreuse&quot;. It was followed by the &quot;Carême impromptu&quot;, the &quot;Lutrin vivant&quot; and &quot;Les Ombres&quot;. Soon, complaints were made to the fathers of the alleged licentiousness of his verses, the real cause of complaint being the ridicule which &quot;Vert-Vert&quot; seemed to throw upon the religious community and the anti-clerical tendency of the other poems. Gresset was transferred to the Jesuit school of La Flèche, and soon after (30 September 1735) left the Order, without having been ordained priest. Gresset, who had never been taught to stand alone, was devastated: he wrote a moving &quot;Adieux aux Jésuites&quot;.

He went to Paris in 1740 and there produced &quot;Edouard III&quot;, a tragedy (1740) and &quot;Sidnei&quot; (1745), a comedy. These were followed by &quot;Le Méchant&quot; which was qualified by Ferdinand Brunetière as the best verse comedy of the French 18th century theatre, even surpassing the &quot;Métromanie&quot; of Alexis Piron. Gresset was admitted to the Académie française in 1748. After his marriage, in 1751, to the daughter of a former mayor of Amiens, he withdrew to that city, where he carried on his literary activities through the &#x27;Académie d&#x27;Amiens&#x27; which he had founded. However, going through a moral crisis and religious awakening he disowned the more frivolous writings of the past.

He died at Amiens on the 16 June 1777.

<text>The Ulster Special Constabulary (USC; commonly called the &quot;B-Specials&quot; or &quot;B Men&quot;) was a quasi-military reserve special constable police force in what would later become Northern Ireland. It was set up in October 1920, shortly before the partition of Ireland. The USC was an armed corps, organised partially on military lines and called out in times of emergency, such as war or insurgency. It performed this role most notably in the early 1920s during the Irish War of Independence and the 1956–1962 IRA Border Campaign.

During its existence, 95 USC members were killed in the line of duty. Most of these (72) were killed in conflict with the IRA in 1921 and 1922. Another 8 died during the Second World War, in air raids or IRA attacks. Of the remainder, most died in accidents but two former officers were killed during the Troubles in the 1980s.

The force was almost exclusively Ulster Protestant and as a result was viewed with great mistrust by Catholics. It carried out several revenge killings and reprisals against Catholic civilians in the 1920–22 conflict. See The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922) and Timeline of the Irish War of Independence. Unionists generally supported the USC as contributing to the defence of Northern Ireland from subversion and outside aggression.

The Special Constabulary was disbanded in May 1970, after the Hunt Report, which advised re-shaping Northern Ireland&#x27;s security forces to attract more Catholic recruits and demilitarizing the police. Its functions and membership were largely taken over by the Ulster Defence Regiment and the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

==Formation==
The Ulster Special Constabulary was formed against the background of conflict over Irish independence and the partition of Ireland.

The 1919–21 Irish War of Independence, saw the Irish Republican Army (IRA) launch a guerrilla campaign in pursuit of Irish independence. Unionists in Ireland&#x27;s northeast were vehemently against this campaign and against Irish independence. However, once it became apparent that the British government was committed to implementing Dominion Status for all of Ireland outside Ulster in response to Sinn Féin&#x27;s demands, which were far more radical than those of the defunct Irish Parliamentary Party, Unionists in most of the province of Ulster directed their energies into the partition of Ireland by the creation of Northern Ireland as an autonomous region in the United Kingdom. The new region would consist of two thirds of Ulster, the six counties that Unionists could control. The other three counties (Donegal, Monaghan, and Cavan) had disproportionately Catholic and nationalist majorities and would become part of the Irish Free State. Partition was enacted by the British Parliament in the Government of Ireland Act 1920.

Two main factors were behind the formation of the Ulster Special Constabulary. One was the desire of Unionists, led by Sir James Craig (then a junior minister in the British Government, and later the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland), that the apparatus of government and security should be placed in their hands long before Northern Ireland was formally established.

A second reason was that violence in the north was increasing after the summer of 1920. The IRA began extending attacks to the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), RIC barracks, and revenue offices in Northern Ireland. There had been serious rioting between Catholics and Protestants in Derry in May and June and in Belfast in July, which had left up to 40 people dead. (See The Troubles in Northern Ireland (1920–1922) and Timeline of the Irish War of Independence.)

With police and troops being drawn towards combating insurgency in the south and west, Unionists wanted a force that would be dedicated to taking on the IRA. At a 2 September 1920 meeting of government Ministers in London Craig said that the loyal population was losing faith in the government&#x27;s ability to protect them and that loyalist paramilitary groups threatened, in the words of Craig, &quot;a recourse to arms, which would precipitate civil war&quot;. Craig proposed to the British cabinet a new &quot;volunteer constabulary&quot; which &quot;must be raised from the loyal population&quot; and organised, &quot;on military lines&quot; and &quot;armed for duty within the six county area only&quot;. On 23 July 1920 Craig informed the British cabinet that the &quot;Specials&quot; would &quot;prevent mob law and the Protestants from running amok.&quot; He recommended that &quot;the organisation of the Ulster Volunteers (UVF), (the unionist militia formed in 1912) should be used for this purpose&quot;. Wilfrid Spender, the former UVF quartermaster in 1913–14, and by now a decorated war veteran, was appointed by Craig to form and run the USC. UVF units were &quot;incorporated en masse&quot; into the new USC.

The idea of a volunteer police force in the north appealed to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George for several practical reasons; it freed up the RIC and military for use elsewhere in Ireland, it was cheap, and it did not need new legislation. Special Constabulary Acts had been enacted in 1832 and 1914, meaning that the administration in Dublin Castle only had to use existing laws to create it. The formation of the Ulster Special Constabulary was therefore announced on 22 October 1920.

On 1 November 1920, the scheme was officially announced by the British government.

==Composition==
The composition of the USC was overwhelmingly Protestant and Unionist, for a number of reasons. Several informal &quot;constabulary&quot; groups had already been created, for example, in Belfast, Fermanagh and Antrim. The Ulster Unionist Labour Association had established an &quot;unofficial special constabulary,&quot; with members drawn chiefly from the shipyards, tasked with &#x27;policing&#x27; Protestant areas.

In April 1920, Captain Sir Basil Brooke (future Prime Minister of Northern Ireland), had set up &quot;Fermanagh Vigilance&quot;, a vigilante group to provide defence against incursions by the IRA. Brooke himself had been personally affected by the organisation, as his son had been a victim of kidnapping. In Ballymacarrett, a Protestant rector named John Redmond had helped form a unit of ex-servicemen to keep the peace after the July riots.

There was a willingness to arm or recognise existing Protestant militias. Wilfrid Spender, head of the Ulster Volunteer Force, encouraged his members to join. For these groups, was an immediate and illicit supply of arms available, especially from the Ulster Volunteers. Charles Wickham, Chief of Police for the north of Ireland, favoured incorporation of the Ulster Volunteers into &quot;regular military units&quot; instead of having to &quot;face them down&quot;. A number of these groups were absorbed into the new Ulster Special Constabulary.

Nationalists pointed out that the composition of the USC was overwhelmingly Protestant and loyal, claiming the government was arming Protestants to attack Catholics. In addition, a number of Special Constables, newly appointed by the Lisburn Urban Council, had been charged with rioting and looting committed over three days and nights following the assassination of RIC Inspector Oswald Swanzy. During that same time period, members of the Dromore UVF were said to have supervised the expulsion of Catholic families from Dromore. A further detail was that many UVF units joined the new Constabulary, with their commanders being appointed to senior positions. 
Unsuccessful efforts were made to attract more Catholics into the force, but these largely failed. One reason for this was that Catholic members were more easily targeted by the IRA for intimidation and assassination. The government suggested that, with enough Catholic recruits, special constabulary patrols made up of Catholics only could be extended into Catholic areas. However, the Nationalist Party and Ancient Order of Hibernians discouraged their members from joining.

The IRA issued a statement which said that any Catholics who joined the Specials would be treated as traitors and would be dealt with accordingly.

==Organisation==
The USC was initially financed and equipped by the British government and placed under the control of the RIC. The USC consisted of 32,000 men divided into four sections, all of whom were armed:
* A Specials – full-time and paid, worked alongside regular RIC men, but could not be posted outside their home areas (regular RIC officers could be posted anywhere in the country); usually served at static checkpoints (originally 5,500 members)
* B Specials – part-time, usually on duty for one evening per week and serving under their own command structure, and unpaid, although they had a generous system of allowances (which were reduced following the reorganisation of the USC a few years later), served wherever the RIC served and manned Mobile Groups of platoon size; (originally 19,000 members) 
* C Specials – unpaid, non-uniformed reservists, usually rather elderly and used for static guard duties near their homes (originally 7,500 members) 
** C1 Specials – non-active C class specials who could be called out in emergencies. The C1 category was formed in late 1921, incorporating the various local unionist militias such as the Ulster Volunteers into a new special class of the USC, thus placing them under the control and discipline of the Stormont Government.

The units were organised on military lines up to company level. Platoons had two officers, a Head Constable, four sergeants and sixty special constables.
The Belfast units were constructed differently from those in the counties. The districts were based on the existing RIC divisions. The constables drew pistols and truncheons before going on patrol and considerable efforts were made to use them only in Protestant areas. This did free up regular policemen who were generally more acceptable to most Ulster Catholics.

By July 1921, more than 3,500 &#x27;A&#x27; Specials had been enrolled, and almost 16,000 &#x27;B&#x27; Specials. By 1922 recruiting had swelled the numbers to: 5,500 A Specials, 19,000 B Specials and 7,500 C1 Specials. Their duties would include combatting the urban guerrilla operations of the IRA, and the suppression of the local IRA in rural areas. In addition they were to prevent border incursion, smuggling of arms and escape of fugitives.

===Opposition===
From the outset, the formation of the USC came in for widespread criticism, mostly from Irish nationalists and the Dublin government but also from some elements of the British military and administrative establishment in Ireland and in the British press, which saw the USC as a potentially divisive and sectarian force. In the British House of Commons, the leader of the Nationalist Party of Northern Ireland, Joseph Devlin, formerly a leading member of the now defunct Irish Parliamentary Party, made his feelings on the creation of the USC clear: &quot;The Chief Secretary is going to arm pogromists to murder Catholics...we would not touch your special constabulary with a 40 foot pole. Their pogrom is to be made less difficult. Instead of paving stones and sticks they are to be given rifles.&quot;

Sir Nevil Macready, General Officer Commanding-in-chief of the British Army in Ireland, along with his supporters in the Irish administration, refused to approve the new force but were overridden; Lloyd George approved of it from the beginning. Macready and Henry Hughes Wilson argued that the concept of a special constabulary was a dangerous one.

Wilson warned the formation of a partisan constabulary &quot;would mean; taking sides, civil war and savage reprisals.&quot; John Anderson, the Under Secretary for Ireland (head of the British Administration in Dublin) shared his fears, &quot;you cannot, in the middle of a faction fight, recognise one of the contending parties and expect it to deal with disorder in the spirit of impartiality and fairness essential in those who have to carry out the order of the Government.&quot;

The Irish nationalist press was less reserved. The &quot;Fermanagh Herald&quot; noted the opposition of Irish nationalists:

Vice Admiral Sir Arthur Hezlet in the official &quot;History of the Ulster Special Constabulary&quot;, contended that &quot;Sinn Fein regarded the Specials as an excuse for arming the Orangemen and an act even more atrocious than the creation of the &#x27;Black and Tans&#x27;! Their fury was natural as they saw that the Specials might well mean that they would be unable to intimidate and subdue the North by Force. Their skilful propaganda set about blackening the image of Special Constables, trying to identify them with the worst elements of the Protestant mobs in Belfast. They sought to magnify and distort every incident and to stir up hatred of the force even before it started to function.&quot;

==Training, uniform, weaponry and equipment==


The standard of training was varied. In Belfast, the Specials were trained in much the same way as the regular police whereas in rural areas the USC was focused on counter-guerrilla operations. In 1922, B Specials received two weeks training and A Specials were initially given six weeks training. The amount of training was clearly inadequate for a conflict that warranted the deployment of professionally trained soldiers.

Uniforms were not available at the outset so the men of the B Specials went on duty in their civilian clothes wearing an armband to signify they were Specials. Uniforms did not become available until 1922. Uniforms took the same pattern as RIC/RUC dress with high collared tunics. Badges of rank were displayed on the right forearm of the jacket.

The Special Constables were armed with Webley .38 revolvers and also Lee–Enfield rifles and bayonets. By the 1960s Sten and Sterling submachine guns were also used. In most cases these weapons were retained at home by the constables along with a quantity of ammunition. One of the reasons for this was to enable rapid call out of platoons, via a runner from the local RUC station, without the need to issue arms from a central armoury.

&#x27;A Special&#x27; platoons were fully mobile using a Ford car for the officer in charge, two armoured cars and four Crossley Tenders (one for each of the sections).

B Specials generally deployed on foot but could be supplied with vehicles from the police pool.

==Irish War of Independence (1920–22)==
Deployment of the USC during the Anglo-Irish War provided the Northern Ireland government with its own territorial militia to fight the IRA. The use of Specials to reinforce the RIC also allowed for the re-opening of over 20 barracks in rural areas which had previously been abandoned because of IRA attacks. The cost of maintaining the USC in 1921–22 was £1,500,000.

Their conduct towards the Catholic population was criticised on a number of occasions. In February 1921, Specials and UVF men burned down ten Catholic houses in the County Fermanagh village of Roslea after a Special who lived in the village was shot and wounded. Following the death of a Special Constable near Newry on 8 June 1921, it was alleged that Specials and an armed mob were involved in the burning of 161 Catholic homes and the death of 10 Catholics. An inquest advised that the Special Constabulary &quot;should not be allowed into any locality occupied by people of an opposite denomination.&quot; The government suggested the recruitment of more Catholics to form &quot;Catholic only&quot; patrols to cover Catholic areas, but this was not acted upon.

After the Truce between the IRA and the British on 11 July 1921, the USC was demobilised by the British and the IRA was given official recognition while peace talks were ongoing. However, the force was remobilised in November 1921, after security powers were transferred from London to the Northern Ireland Government.

Michael Collins planned a clandestine guerrilla campaign against Northern Ireland using the IRA. In early 1922, he sent IRA units to the border areas and arms to northern units. On 6 December the Northern authorities ordered an end to the Truce with the IRA.
The Special Constabulary was, as well as an auxiliary to the police, effectively an army under the control of the Northern Ireland administration. By incorporating the former UVF into the USC as the C1 Specials, the Belfast government had created a mobile reserve of at least two brigades of experienced troops in addition to the A and B Classes who, between them, made up at least another operational infantry brigade, which could be used in the event of further hostilities, and were in early 1922.

===1922: Border conflict and reprisals===
The USC&#x27;s most intense period of deployment was in the first half of 1922, when conditions of a low-intensity war existed along the new Irish border between the Free State and Northern Ireland.

The Anglo-Irish Treaty had agreed the partition of Ireland, between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. The IRA, although now split over the Treaty, continued offensive operations in Northern Ireland, with the co-operation of Michael Collins, leader of the Free State, and Liam Lynch, leader of the Anti-Treaty IRA faction. This was despite the Craig-Collins Agreement which was signed by the leaders of Northern Ireland and the Free State on 30 March, and envisaged the end of IRA activity and a reduced role for the USC.

The renewed IRA campaign involved attacking barracks, burning commercial buildings and making a large-scale incursion into Northern Ireland, occupying Belleek and Pettigo in May–June, which was repulsed after heavy fighting, including British use of artillery on 8 June.

The British Army was only used in the Pettigo and Belleek actions. Therefore, the main job of counter-insurgency in this border conflict fell to the Special Constabulary while the RIC/RUC patrolled the interior. Forty-nine Special Constables were killed during the period of the &quot;Border War&quot;, out of a total of eighty-one British forces killed in Northern Ireland. Their biggest single loss of life came at Clones in February 1922, when a patrol which entered the Free State refused to surrender to the local IRA garrison and took four dead and eight wounded in a firefight.

In addition to action against the IRA, the USC may have been involved in a number of attacks on Catholic civilians in reprisal for IRA actions, for example, in Belfast, the McMahon Murders of March 1922, in which six Catholics were killed, and the Arnon Street killings a week later which killed another six. On 2 May 1922, in revenge for the IRA killing of six policemen in counties Londonderry and Tyrone, Special Constables killed nine Catholic civilians in the area.

The conflict never formally ended but petered out in June 1922, with the outbreak of the Irish Civil War in the Free State and the wholesale arrest and internment of IRA activists in the North. Collins continued to arrange the supply of arms covertly to the Northern IRA until shortly before his death in August 1922.

Assessments of the USC&#x27;s role in this conflict vary. Unionists have written that the Special Constabulary, &quot;saved Northern Ireland from anarchy&quot; and &quot;subdued the IRA&quot;, while nationalist authors have judged that their treatment of the Catholic community, including, &quot;widespread harassment and a significant number of reprisal killings&quot; permanently alienated nationalists from the USC itself and more broadly, from the Northern Irish state.

== 1920s to 1940s ==
After the end of the 1920–22 conflict, the Special Constabulary was re-organised. The regular Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) took over normal policing duties.

The &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; categories of the USC were dispensed with, leaving only the B-Specials, who functioned as a permanent reserve force, and armed and uniformed in the same manner as the RUC.

The Special Constabulary were called out during the 12 July period in Belfast in 1931 after sectarian rioting broke out. The B Specials were tasked to relieve the RUC from normal duties, to allow them and the British Army to deal with the disturbances.

In 1936 the British advocacy group - the National Council for Civil Liberties characterized the USC as &quot;nothing but the organised army of the Unionist party&quot;.

During the Second World War, the USC was mobilised to serve in Britain&#x27;s Home Guard, which unusually, was put under the command of the police rather than the British Army.

== 1950s – IRA Border Campaign ==
Between 1956 and 1962, the Special Constabulary was again mobilised to combat a guerrilla campaign launched by the IRA.

Damage to property during this period was £1 million and the overall cost of the campaign was £10 million to the UK exchequer. Historian Tim Pat Coogan said of the USC, &quot;The B Specials were the rock on which any mass movement by the IRA in the North has inevitably floundered.&quot; Six RUC and eleven IRA men (but no Special Constables) were killed in this campaign.

The IRA called off their campaign in February 1962.

==1969 deployment==
The USC were deployed in 1969 to support the RUC in the 1969 Northern Ireland riots. The B Specials&#x27; role in these events led to its disbandment the following year.

Northern Ireland had been destabilised by disturbances arising out of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association&#x27;s agitation for equal rights for Catholics. The USC were mobilised when the regular RUC were overstretched by riots in Derry (known as the Battle of the Bogside). The NICRA called for protests elsewhere to support those in Derry, leading to the violence spreading throughout Northern Ireland, especially in Belfast.

The USC were largely held in reserve in July and only hesitantly committed in August. The General Officer Commanding of the British Army in Northern Ireland refused to allow the Army to become involved until the Belfast administration has used &quot;all the forces at its disposal&quot;. This meant that the B Specials had to be deployed, although they were not trained or equipped for public order situations. The unsuitability of the use of the B Specials in such situations was clear: &quot;The &#x27;Specials&#x27;, untrained for such a job, contained no Catholic members, were inevitably regarded as sectarian, and their presence tended to heighten rather than lower tension in Catholic areas.&quot; In August 1969 the IRA Chief of Staff Cathal Goulding issued a statement saying that his men were deployed in Belfast in a defensive capacity protecting Catholics who had been &quot;terrorized by mobs backed by armed B-Specials.&quot; Goulding also stated that British troops would be in a &quot;very perilous situation&quot; until the B-Specials were disarmed and disbanded.

The two main centres of disturbance were in Belfast and Derry. A total of 300 Special Constables were also mobilised into the RUC during the disturbances. Some Constables were used to restrain a Protestant crowd in Derry, but others in this area joined in an exchange of petrol bombs and missiles with a Catholic crowd while another group led an attack on the Rossville Street area of the Catholic Bogside on 12 August.

In Belfast, the USC were successful in restoring order in the predominantly Protestant Shankill area, where they performed their patrol duties unarmed. On one occasion, the Comber Platoon was petrol-bombed by a hostile Protestant crowd at Inglis&#x27;s bakery as it tried to protect Catholics who were going to work. They also successfully protected Catholic owned public houses in the area, many of which were looted after they were withdrawn. However, on 14 August they did not hold back Protestants who attacked the Catholic Dover and Percy streets in the Falls/Divis district, and instead &quot;fought back&quot; Catholics there.

===USC shootings===
The USC&#x27;s most controversial conduct in the 1969 riots came in provincial towns, where the Special Constabulary formed the main response to the rioting. The Specials, who were armed and not trained for riot duty, used deadly force on a number of occasions.

The USC shot and wounded a number of people in Dungiven and Coalisland. In Dungannon, they killed one and wounded two. In the following Scarman Tribunal, the findings said &quot;...the Tribunal has been at a loss to find any explanation for the shooting, which it is satisfied was a reckless and irresponsible thing to do.&quot;

When Jack Lynch, the Taoiseach of Ireland, moved Irish Army troops up to the border in response to the rioting, platoons of Specials were deployed to guard border police stations.

Arising out the disturbances, the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced that the B Specials would be &quot;phased out of their current role&quot;. The British Government commissioned three reports into the policing response to the 1969 riots. These ultimately led to the disbanding of the Ulster Special Constabulary.

===The Cameron Report===
Sir John Cameron was requested to submit a report on the disturbances in Northern Ireland.

He found some evidence of cross-membership of the USC and loyalist paramilitary organisations. He reported that in Major Ronald Bunting&#x27;s Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV), there was definite evidence of dual membership by Special Constables, of which he said &quot;we consider highly undesirable and not in the public interest&quot;. He also remarked that although &quot;recruitment is open to both Protestant and Roman Catholic: in practice we are in no doubt that it is almost if not wholly impossible for a Roman Catholic recruit to be accepted.&quot; The Cameron Report described the B-Specials as &quot;a partisan and paramilitary force recruited exclusively from Protestants.&quot;

Cameron recommended that the purposes of the USC as a reserve civilian police force, as well as a counter-insurgency reserve, be properly made known in recruitment and training so that it would be more attractive to Catholics.

===The Scarman Report===
The Hon Justice Scarman, in his report on the rioting, was critical of the RUC&#x27;s senior officers and of the way the B Specials were deployed into areas of civil disturbance which they had no training to deal with, which in some occasions led to a worsening of the situation. He also pointed out that the B Specials were the only reserve available to the RUC and that he could see no other way of quickly reinforcing the over-stretched RUC in the circumstances. He praised the Specials where he felt it was due.

Scarman concluded in his report on the civil disturbance in the region in 1969 that: &quot;Undoubtedly mistakes were made and certain individual officers acted wrongly on occasions. But the general case of a partisan force co-operating with Protestant mobs to attack Catholic people is devoid of substance, and we reject it utterly.&quot;

Scarman went on to criticise the Command and Control of the RUC for deploying armed Special Constables in areas where their very presence would &quot;heighten tension&quot;, as he was in no doubt that they were &quot;Totally distrusted by the Catholics, who saw them as the strong arm of the Protestant ascendancy&quot;.

Scarman concluded that it would have been very difficult for Catholics to gain membership in 1969, even if they had applied to join.

===The Hunt Report===
The abolition of the B Specials was a central demand of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement in the late 1960s.

On 30 April 1970, the USC was finally stood down, as a result of the Hunt Committee Report.
Hunt concluded that the perceived bias of the Special Constabulary, whether true or not, had to be addressed. One of his other major concerns was the use of the police force for carrying out military style operations. His recommendations included:
: (47) A locally recruited part-time force, under the control of the G.O.C., Northern Ireland, should be raised as soon as possible for such duties as may be laid upon it. The force, together with the police volunteer reserve, should replace the Ulster Special Constabulary (paragraph 171).

==Disbandment==

The Ulster Special Constabulary was disbanded in May 1970. It has been argued that their failure to deal with the 1969 disturbances was due to a failure on behalf of the Northern Ireland government to modernise their equipment, weaponry, training and approach to the job.

On the disbandment of the USC, many of its members joined the newly established Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), the part-time security force which replaced the B Specials. Unlike the Special Constabulary, the UDR was placed under military control. Other B Specials joined the new Part Time Reserve of the RUC. The USC continued to do duties for a month after the formation of the UDR and RUC Reserve to give both of the new forces time to consolidate.

In the final handover to the Ulster Defence Regiment, the B Specials had to surrender their weapons and uniforms. Despite the government&#x27;s concerns about the handover of weapons and equipment, every single uniform and every single weapon was handed in.

After implementation of the Hunt report, the last night of duties for most B Men was 31 March 1970. On 1 April 1970 the Ulster Defence Regiment began duties. Initially, the Regiment had 4,000 members who worked part-time while the new special constabulary, the RUC Reserve which replaced the B-Specials, initially consisted of 1,500 members.

==Continuing influence==
Since disbandment the USC has assumed a place of &quot;almost mythic proportions&quot; within unionist folklore, whereas in the Nationalist community they are still reviled as the Protestant only, armed wing of the unionist government &quot;associated with the worst examples of unfair treatment of Catholics in Northern Ireland by the police force&quot;. An Orange lodge was formed to commemorate the disbandment of the force called &quot;Ulster Special Constabulary LOL No 1970&quot;. An Ulster Special Constabulary Association was also set up soon after the disbandment.

<text>Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely was, from 1965 to 1974, an administrative and geographical county in East Anglia in the United Kingdom. In 1974 it became part of an enlarged Cambridgeshire.

==Formation==

The Local Government Act 1888 created four small neighbouring administrative counties in the east of England: Cambridgeshire, Isle of Ely, Huntingdonshire, and the Soke of Peterborough. Following the Second World War, a Local Government Boundary Commission was formed to review county-level administration in England and Wales. The commission was of the opinion that counties needed to have a population of between 200,000 and 1 million to provide effective services. Accordingly, they recommended the amalgamation of all four counties into a single entity. The commission&#x27;s recommendations were not carried out, however.

The reform of local government was returned to in 1958, with the appointment of a Local Government Commission for England. The four counties were included in the East Midlands General Review Area, and the LGCE made its draft proposals in April 1960. The commission identified particular problems in the administration of Cambridgeshire, where the city of Cambridge had 50% of the population and over two-thirds of the rateable value of the county. Cambridge was large enough to qualify for county borough status and be removed from the administrative county, but it was felt that this would render the remainder of Cambridgeshire, which would consist of three rural districts, too small to effectively deliver local services. The LGCE made draft proposals to constitute Cambridge a county borough and create a new administrative county by merging the remainder of the county with the Isle of Ely, Huntingdonshire and the Soke of Peterborough. There was considerable opposition to the draft proposals, and the LGCE instead opted in its final report in 1961 to create two counties: Huntingdon and Peterborough, and Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely, with Cambridge continuing to form part of the latter county.

The Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely Order was made on 14 February 1964, and placed before the House of Commons on 9 March 1964. The amalgamation was opposed by Sir Harry Legge-Bourke, member of parliament (MP) for the Isle of Ely, noting that his constituents &quot;in general were in favour of continuing with an independent county council with which they were entirely satisfied.&quot; Legge-Bourke asked why the Isle was to be abolished as a county, when Rutland was being retained, and went on to state that some parts of the area had more interests in common with Peterborough than with Cambridge. The MP for Cambridge, Sir Hamilton Kerr, also objected to the creation of the new county, advocating the original draft proposals and the elevation of his constituency to become a county borough. Nevertheless, the order was approved by 144 votes to 84.

The new county was formed on 1 April 1965 from the areas of the administrative counties of Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely (with minor boundary changes) less Thorney Rural District. As well as becoming an administrative county, Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely also became a county for other statutory purposes. Accordingly, the Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire was retitled Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely. A High Sheriff was also appointed to the new county, and a single commission of peace and court of quarter sessions established.

On the creation of the county, an order under the Police Act 1964 came into force creating the Mid-Anglia Constabulary by merging the Cambridge City Police, Cambridgeshire County Constabulary, Isle of Ely Constabulary, Huntingdonshire Constabulary, and the Peterborough Combined Police Force. On further local government reform in 1974, this became the present Cambridgeshire Constabulary with the same boundaries.

The county ranked 33 out of 46 by population.

==Districts==
The county was divided into twelve districts: two municipal boroughs, four urban districts and six rural districts. The districts, which were transferred from the previous administrative counties, were:
† Formerly in Cambridgeshire
‡ Formerly in Isle of Ely

==Coat of arms==
The county council was granted armorial bearings by the College of Arms on 1 September 1965. The coat of arms was a combination of those of the two merged county councils. The blazon of the arms was as follows:

&quot;Or a double tressure flory counter flory gules, overall on a bend wavy azure three crowns or; the shield ensigned by a mural crown or. Supporters: on either side a great bustard proper, the exterior leg resting on a closed book gules, garnished or. Badge: Within an annulet issuant therefrom four fleurs-de-lys in cross an open crown or.&quot;

The gold field and red &quot;tressure flory counter flory&quot; were taken from the royal arms of Scotland. This was in reference to the fact that the Earldom of Cambridge was held by David I of Scotland in the twelfth century. The blue wave represented the River Cam on which were three crowns from the arms of the Diocese of Ely. The supporters were great bustards, a bird extinct in England, whose last habitat was said to have been in the county. The birds were differenced from those supporting the previous Cambridgeshire arms by the placing of a red book beneath their feet. The book came from the arms of the University of Cambridge. The Latin motto adopted also referred to the university, and was &quot;Sapientes Simus&quot; or &quot;Let us be men of understanding&quot;.

==Abolition==
The county had only a brief existence: the Local Government Act 1972 reformed all administrative structures in England and Wales outside Greater London. On 1 April 1974, Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely was merged with Huntingdon and Peterborough to form a new non-metropolitan county of Cambridgeshire, bringing into effect the amalgamation originally proposed in 1947.

<text>Lyle Rains was a senior executive at the arcade game company Atari and is sometimes, with Ed Logg, listed as a co-developer of the video game &quot;Asteroids&quot;. In fact, Rains called Logg into his office and said &quot;Well, why don’t we have a game where you shoot the rocks and blow them up?&quot;. Rains also served as Executive Producer for a large number of Atari coin-op games. An avid gamer, he wrote a popular online FAQ for the Atari coin-op game &quot;KLAX&quot;.

He joined old compatriot video game designers in a new company called Innovative Leisure headed by Seamus Blackley in 2012 to design games for phones.

<text>George Edward &quot;Ed&quot; Logg (born 1948 in Seattle) is a retired American arcade video game designer, first employed at Atari, Inc. and later at Atari Games. He currently resides in San Jose, California. He was educated at University of California, Berkeley and also attended Stanford University.

==Career==

Logg was impressed with the Atari 2600 (then known as &quot;Atari Video Computer System&quot;) and joined Atari&#x27;s coin-op division and worked on &quot;Dirt Bike&quot;, which was never released due to an unsuccessful field test. He co-developed with Ed Rotberg &quot;Super Breakout&quot; after hearing that Nolan Bushnell, co-founder of Atari, wanted &quot;Breakout&quot; updated. He co-developed the video game &quot;Asteroids&quot; with Lyle Rains. Other games designed or co-designed by Logg include &quot;Centipede&quot;, &quot;Millipede&quot;, the &quot;Gauntlet&quot; series (with inspiration from John Palevich&#x27;s &quot;Dandy&quot;), &quot;Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 3D Hockey&quot; and the home versions of the &quot;San Francisco Rush&quot; series.

==Legacy==
In 2011, Logg was awarded a Pioneer Award by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences for being among those who &quot;laid the foundations of the multi-billion dollar videogame industry.&quot; Logg was listed at number 43 in &quot;IGN&quot; top 100 game creators of all time.
